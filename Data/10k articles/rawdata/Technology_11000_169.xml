[[File:SSDTR-ASIC technology.jpg|thumb|A tray of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips]]

An '''Application-Specific Integrated Circuit''' ('''ASIC''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|s|ɪ|k}}) is an [[integrated circuit]] (IC) customized for a particular use, rather than intended for general-purpose use. For example, a chip designed to run in a [[digital voice recorder]] or a high-efficiency [[Bitcoin mining|Bitcoin miner]] is an ASIC. Application-specific standard products (ASSPs) are intermediate between ASICs and industry standard integrated circuits like the [[7400 series]] or the [[4000 series]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/76935560|title=ASIC Design in the Silicon Sandbox: A Complete Guide to Building Mixed-signal Integrated Circuits|last=Barr|first=Keith|date=2007|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=|isbn=9780071481618|location=New York|pages=|oclc=76935560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As feature sizes have shrunk and design tools improved over the years, the maximum complexity (and hence functionality) possible in an ASIC has grown from 5,000 [[logic gate]]s to over 100 million. Modern ASICs often include entire [[Central processing unit|microprocessors]], [[memory]] blocks including [[Read-only memory|ROM]], [[RAM]], [[EEPROM]], [[flash memory]] and other large building blocks. Such an ASIC is often termed a SoC ([[system-on-chip]]). Designers of digital ASICs often use a [[hardware description language]] (HDL), such as [[Verilog]] or [[VHDL]], to describe the functionality of ASICs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGA) are the modern-day technology for building a [[breadboard]] or prototype from standard parts; programmable logic blocks and programmable interconnects allow the same FPGA to be used in many different applications. For smaller designs or lower production volumes, FPGAs may be more cost effective than an ASIC design, even in production. The [[non-recurring engineering]] (NRE) cost of an ASIC can run into the millions of dollars. Therefore, device manufacturers typically prefer FPGAs [[FPGA prototyping|for prototyping]] and devices with low production volume and ASICs for [[Mass production|very large production volumes]] where NRE costs can be [[Amortized cost|amortized]] across many devices. 

==History==
The initial ASICs used [[gate array]] technology. An early successful commercial application was the gate array circuitry found in the low-end 8-bit [[ZX81]] and [[ZX Spectrum]] [[Personal computer|personal computers]], introduced in 1981 and 1982. These were used by [[Sinclair Research]] (UK) essentially as a low-cost [[Input/output|I/O]] solution aimed at handling the [[Computer graphics|computer's graphics]].

Customization occurred by varying a metal interconnect mask. Gate arrays had complexities of up to a few thousand gates; this is now called [[mid-scale integration]]. Later versions became more generalized, with different [[Die (integrated circuit)|base dies]] customized by both metal and [[Polycrystalline silicon|polysilicon]] layers. Some base dies also include [[random-access memory]] (RAM) elements.

==Standard-cell designs==
{{Main|Standard cell}}

In the mid-1980s, a designer would choose an ASIC manufacturer and implement their design using the design tools available from the manufacturer. While third-party design tools were available, there was not an effective link from the third-party design tools to the [[Integrated circuit layout|layout]] and actual semiconductor process performance characteristics of the various ASIC manufacturers.  Most designers used factory-specific tools to complete the implementation of their designs.  A solution to this problem, which also yielded a much higher density device, was the implementation of [[standard cell]]s.  Every ASIC manufacturer could create functional blocks with known electrical characteristics, such as [[propagation delay]], capacitance and inductance, that could also be represented in third-party tools.  Standard-cell design is the utilization of these functional blocks to achieve very high gate density and good electrical performance.  Standard-cell design is intermediate between {{Section link||Gate-array and semi-custom design|nopage=y}} and {{Section link||Full-custom design|nopage=y}} in terms of its non-recurring engineering and recurring component costs as well as performance and speed of development (including [[time to market]]).

By the late 1990s, [[logic synthesis]] tools became available.  Such tools could compile [[Hardware description language|HDL]] descriptions into a gate-level [[netlist]].  Standard-cell [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) are designed in the following conceptual stages referred to as [[Design flow (EDA)|electronics design flow]], although these stages overlap significantly in practice:
#[[Requirements engineering|'''Requirements engineering''']]: A team of design engineers starts with a non-formal understanding of the [[Requirement|required functions]] for a new ASIC, usually derived from [[requirements analysis]].
#'''[[Register-transfer level]] (RTL) design''': The design team constructs a description of an ASIC to achieve these goals using a [[hardware description language]].  This process is similar to writing a computer program in a [[High-level programming language|high-level language]].
#'''[[Functional verification]]''': Suitability for purpose is verified by functional verification. This may include such techniques as [[logic simulation]] through [[Test bench|test benches]], [[formal verification]], [[Hardware emulation|emulation]], or creating and evaluating an equivalent pure [[software]] model, as in [[Simics]].  Each verification technique has advantages and disadvantages, and most often several methods are used together for ASIC verification.  Unlike most [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGAs]], ASICs cannot be [[Reconfigurable computing|reprogrammed]] once [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] and therefore ASIC designs that are not completely correct are much more costly, increasing the need for full [[test coverage]]. 
#'''Logic synthesis''': [[Logic synthesis]] transforms the RTL design into a large collection called of lower-level constructs called standard cells.  These constructs are taken from a [[Library (electronics)|standard-cell library]] consisting of pre-characterized collections of [[Logic gate|logic gates]] performing specific functions.  The standard cells are typically specific to the planned manufacturer of the ASIC.  The resulting collection of standard cells and the needed electrical connections between them is called a gate-level [[netlist]].
#'''Placement''': The gate-level netlist is next processed by a [[placement (EDA)|placement]] tool which places the standard cells onto a region of an [[Die (integrated circuit)|integrated circuit die]] representing the final ASIC.  The placement tool attempts to find an [[Mathematical optimization|optimized]] placement of the standard cells, subject to a variety of specified constraints.
#'''Routing''': An electronics [[Routing (electronic design automation)|routing]] tool takes the physical placement of the standard cells and uses the netlist to create the [[Electrical connection|electrical connections]] between them.  Since the [[Optimization problem#Search space|search space]] is large, this process will produce a “sufficient” rather than “[[Global optimum|globally optimal]]” solution.  The output is a file which can be used to create a set of [[photomask]]s enabling a [[Semiconductor fabrication plant|semiconductor fabrication facility]], commonly called a 'fab' or 'foundry' to [[Manufacturing|manufacture]] physical [[Integrated circuit|integrated circuits]]. Placement and routing are closely interrelated and are collectively called [[place and route]] in electronics design.
#'''Sign-off''': Given the final layout, [[circuit extraction]] computes the [[Parasitic element (electrical networks)|parasitic resistances and capacitances]].  In the case of a [[digital circuit]], this will then be further mapped into [[Propagation delay|delay information]] from which the circuit performance can be estimated, usually by [[static timing analysis]].  This, and other final tests such as [[design rule checking]] and [[power analysis]] collectively called [[Signoff (electronic design automation)|signoff]] are intended to ensure that the device will function correctly over all extremes of the process, voltage and temperature.  When this testing is complete the [[photomask]] information is released for [[chip fabrication]].

These steps, implemented with a level of skill common in the industry, almost always produce a final device that correctly implements the original design, unless flaws are later introduced by the physical fabrication process.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The design steps, also called [[Design flow (EDA)|design flow]], are also common to standard product design. The significant difference is that standard-cell design uses the manufacturer's cell libraries that have been used in potentially hundreds of other design implementations and therefore are of much lower risk than full custom design. Standard cells produce a [[Transistor density|design density]] that is cost effective, and they can also integrate [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|IP cores]] and [[static random-access memory]] (SRAM) effectively, unlike gate arrays.

==Gate-array and semi-custom design==
[[File:S-MOS Systems ASIC SLA6140.jpg|thumb|Microscope photograph of a gate-array ASIC showing the predefined logic cells and custom interconnections. This particular design uses less than 20% of available logic gates.]]

[[Gate array]] design is a manufacturing method in which diffused layers, each consisting [[Transistor|transistors]] and other [[Active element|active devices]], are predefined and [[Wafer (electronics)|electronics wafers]] containing such devices are "held in stock" or unconnected prior to the [[metallizing|metallization]] stage of the [[fabrication process]].  The [[Physical design (electronics)|physical design]] process defines the interconnections of these layers for the final device.  For most ASIC manufacturers, this consists of between two to nine metal layers with each layer running perpendicular to the one below it. Non-recurring engineering costs are much lower than full custom designs, as [[Photolithography|photolithographic]] masks are required only for the metal layers.  Production cycles are much shorter, as metallization is a comparatively quick process; thereby accelerating [[time to market]]. 

Gate-array ASICs are always a compromise between rapid design and [[Computer performance|performance]] as mapping a given design onto what a manufacturer held as a stock wafer never gives 100% [[circuit utilization]].  Often difficulties in [[Routing (electronic design automation)|routing]] the interconnect require migration onto a larger array device with consequent increase in the piece part price.  These difficulties are often a result of the layout [[Electronic design automation|EDA]] software used to develop the interconnect.

Pure, logic-only gate-array design is rarely implemented by circuit designers today, having been almost entirely replaced by [[Field-programmability|field-programmable]] devices. Most prominent of such devices are [[field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGAs) which can be programmed by the user and thus offer minimal tooling charges non-recurring engineering, only marginally increased piece part cost, and comparable performance. 

Today, gate arrays are evolving into [[Structured ASIC platform|structured ASICs]] that consist of a large [[IP core]] like a [[central processing unit|CPU]], [[digital signal processor]] units, [[peripheral]]s, standard [[computer bus|interfaces]], integrated [[Computer memory|memories]], [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]], and a block of [[Reconfigurable computing|reconfigurable]], uncommitted logic. This shift is largely because ASIC devices are capable of integrating large blocks of [[Systems engineering|system]] functionality, and [[System on a chip|systems on a chip]] (SoCs) require [[glue logic]], [[Communications system|communications subsystems]] (such as [[Network on a chip|networks on chip]]), [[Peripheral|peripherals]] and other components rather than only [[Functional unit|functional units]] and basic interconnection. 

In their frequent usages in the field, the terms "gate array" and "semi-custom" are synonymous when referring to ASICs. [[Process engineering|Process engineers]] more commonly use the term "semi-custom", while "gate-array" is more commonly used by logic (or gate-level) designers.

==Full-custom design==
{{Main|Full custom}}
[[File:VLSI VL82C486 Single Chip 486 System Controller HV.jpg|thumb|Microscope photograph of custom ASIC (486 chipset) showing gate-based design on top and custom circuitry on bottom]]

By contrast, full-custom ASIC design defines all the photolithographic layers of the device. Full-custom design is used for both ASIC design and for standard product design.

The benefits of full-custom design include reduced area (and therefore recurring component cost), [[Computer performance|performance]] improvements, and also the ability to integrate [[Analog signal|analog]] components and other [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|pre-designed]]—and thus fully verified—components, such as [[microprocessor]] cores, that form a [[system on a chip]].  

The disadvantages of full-custom design can include increased manufacturing and design time, increased non-recurring engineering costs, more complexity in the [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) and [[electronic design automation]] systems, and a much higher skill requirement on the part of the design team.

For digital-only designs, however, "standard-cell" cell libraries, together with modern CAD systems, can offer considerable performance/cost benefits with low risk. Automated layout tools are quick and easy to use and also offer the possibility to "hand-tweak" or manually optimize any performance-limiting aspect of the design.

This is designed by using basic logic gates, circuits or layout specially for a design.

==Structured design==
{{Main|Structured ASIC platform|Platform-based design}}

''Structured ASIC design'' (also referred to as "''platform ASIC design''") is a relatively new trend in the semiconductor industry, resulting in some variation in its definition. However, the basic premise of a structured ASIC is that both manufacturing cycle time and design cycle time are reduced compared to cell-based ASIC, by virtue of there being pre-defined metal layers (thus reducing manufacturing time) and pre-characterization of what is on the silicon (thus reducing design cycle time). 

One definition states that&lt;blockquote&gt;In a "structured ASIC" design, the logic mask-layers of a device are predefined by the ASIC vendor (or in some cases by a third party). Design differentiation and customization is achieved by creating custom metal layers that create custom connections between predefined lower-layer logic elements. "Structured ASIC" technology is seen as bridging the gap between field-programmable gate arrays and "standard-cell" ASIC designs. Because only a small number of chip layers must be custom-produced, "structured ASIC" designs have much smaller non-recurring expenditures (NRE) than "standard-cell" or "full-custom" chips, which require that a full mask set be produced for every design.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is effectively the same definition as a gate array. What distinguishes a structured ASIC from a gate array is that in a gate array, the predefined metal layers serve to make manufacturing turnaround faster. In a structured ASIC, the use of predefined metallization is primarily to reduce cost of the mask sets as well as making the design cycle time significantly shorter. 

For example, in a cell-based or gate-array design the user must often design power, clock, and test structures themselves. By contrast, these are predefined in most structured ASICs and therefore can save time and expense for the designer compared to gate-array based designs. Likewise, the design tools used for structured ASIC can be substantially lower cost and easier (faster) to use than cell-based tools, because they do not have to perform all the functions that cell-based tools do. In some cases, the structured ASIC vendor requires that customized tools for their device (e.g., custom physical synthesis) be used, also allowing for the design to be brought into manufacturing more quickly.

==Cell libraries, IP-based design, hard and soft macros==
[[Library (electronics)|Cell libraries]] of logical primitives are usually provided by the device manufacturer as part of the service. Although they will incur no additional cost, their release will be covered by the terms of a [[non-disclosure agreement]] (NDA) and they will be regarded as intellectual property by the manufacturer. Usually their physical design will be pre-defined so they could be termed "hard macros".

What most engineers understand as "[[intellectual property]]" are [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|IP cores]], designs purchased from a third-party as sub-components of a larger ASIC. They may be provided in the form of a [[hardware description language]] (often termed a "soft macro"), or as a fully routed design that could be printed directly onto an ASIC's mask (often termed a "hard macro"). Many organizations now sell such pre-designed cores — CPUs, Ethernet, USB or telephone interfaces — and larger organizations may have an entire department or division to produce cores for the rest of the organization. The company [[ARM (company)|ARM]] (Advanced [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] Machines) ''only'' sells IP cores, making it a [[Fabless manufacturing|fabless manufacturer]].

Indeed, the wide range of functions now available in structured ASIC design is a result of the phenomenal improvement in electronics in the late 1990s and early 2000s; as a core takes a lot of time and investment to create, its [[Code reuse|re-use]] and further development cuts product cycle times dramatically and creates better products. Additionally, [[open-source hardware]] organizations such as [[OpenCores]] are collecting free IP cores, paralleling the [[Open-source software|open-source]] software movement in hardware design.

Soft macros are often process-independent (i.e. they can be fabricated on a wide range of manufacturing processes and different manufacturers). Hard macros are process-limited and usually further design effort must be invested to migrate (port) to a different process or manufacturer.

==Multi-project wafers==
Some manufacturers offer multi-project wafers (MPW) as a method of obtaining low cost prototypes. Often called shuttles, these MPW, containing several designs, run at regular, scheduled intervals on a "cut and go" basis, usually with very little liability on the part of the manufacturer. The contract involves the assembly and packaging of a handful of devices. The service usually involves the supply of a physical design database (i.e. masking information or pattern generation (PG) tape). The manufacturer is often referred to as a "silicon foundry" due to the low involvement it has in the process.

==Application-specific standard product==
An '''application specific standard product''' or '''ASSP''' is an [[integrated circuit]] that implements a specific [[Function (engineering)|function]] that appeals to a wide market. As opposed to ASICs that combine a collection of functions and are designed by or for one [[customer]], ASSPs are available as off-the-shelf components. ASSPs are used in all industries, from automotive to communications.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} As a general rule, if you can find a [[design]] in a data [[book]], then it is probably not an ASIC, but there are some exceptions.

For example, two ICs that might or might not be considered ASICs are a controller chip for a PC and a chip for a [[modem]]. Both of these examples are specific to an application (which is typical of an ASIC) but are sold to many different system vendors (which is typical of standard parts). ASICs such as these are sometimes called Application-Specific Standard Products (ASSPs).

Examples of ASSPs are encoding/decoding chip, standalone USB interface chip, etc.

[[IEEE]] used to publish an ASSP magazine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=26080 IEEE ASSP Issue 2, Part 1 - April 1984]&lt;/ref&gt; which was renamed to IEEE Signal Processing Magazine in 1990.

'''Audio over IP''' ('''AoIP''') is the distribution of digital audio across an [[IP network]] such as the [[Internet]]. It is being used increasingly to provide high-quality audio feeds over long distances. The application is also known as '''audio contribution over IP''' ('''ACIP''') in reference to the programming contributions made by field reporters and remote events. [[Audio quality]] and [[Latency (audio)|latency]] are key issues for contribution links.

In the past, these links have made use of [[ISDN]] services but these have become increasingly difficult or expensive to obtain in some parts of Europe and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=BBCWP&gt;{{citation|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP170.pdf |title=BBC white paper |author1=P. A. Stevens |author2=M. Zemack |publisher=BBC |year=2008 |archivedate=2010-09-30 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5t8FdTXFJ?url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP170.pdf |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 28, 2013 Verizon announced it would no longer be taking new orders for ISDN service in the Northeastern United States starting on May 18 of that year. Though they still service existing active installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.talkers.com/2013/03/28/verizon-no-longer-taking-orders-for-isdn-service-in-northeast-starting-may-18/|title=Verizon: No Longer Taking Orders for ISDN Service in Northeast Starting May 18|date=2013-03-28|work=TALKERS magazine - “The bible of talk media.”|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many proprietary systems came into existence for transporting high-quality audio over IP based on [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP), [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) or [[Real-time Transport Protocol]] (RTP). An interoperable standard for audio over IP using RTP now exists.

Within a single building or [[music venue]], [[audio over Ethernet]] (AoE) is more likely to be used instead, avoiding [[audio data compression]] and, in some cases, IP [[encapsulation (networking)|encapsulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Steve Church |author2=Skip Pizzi |title=Audio Over IP |isbn=978-0-240-81244-1 |publisher=[[Focal Press]] |date=2010 |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
The [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) together with many equipment manufacturers defined a common framework for audio contribution over IP in order to achieve interoperability between products. The framework defines RTP as a common protocol and media payload type formats according to [[IETF]] definitions. [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) is used as signalling for call setup and control. The recommendation is currently published as EBU Tech 3326-2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tech.ebu.ch/webdav/site/tech/shared/techreview/trev_2008-Q1_coinchon.pdf |title=Streaming audio contributions over IP |accessdate=2010-12-27 |last=Jonsson |first=Lars |author2=Mathias Coinchon |year=2008 |format=PDF |work=EBU Technical Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More advanced audio codecs are capable of sending audio over unmanaged IP networks like the internet using automated [[jitter buffer]]ing, [[forward error correction]] and [[error concealment]] to minimise latency and maximise packet streaming stability in live broadcast situations over unmanaged IP networks.

In the face of [[IPv4 address exhaustion]], [[IPv6]] capability ensures codecs are capable of connecting over new Internet infrastructure. IPv6 infrastructure is being widely deployed to deliver a virtually inexhaustible supply of IP addresses. IPv6 addressing makes it much easier for broadcast codecs to connect to each other directly and perform flexible multi-point connections over IP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://radioworld.com/article/why-ipv6-matters-to-your-station/23533 |title=Why IPv6 Matters to Your Station |author=Glenn Davies |date=2011-05-19|accessdate=2013-05-18 |publisher=[[Radio World]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of use ==
The [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] began using audio contribution over IP in Scotland as part of the [[BBC Pacific Quay]] development in [[Glasgow]]. A similar system has been installed in the [[Regions of England]] and will be installed in Wales and Northern Ireland. The audio packets are sent using UDP over the BBC’s [[Multilayer switch#Layer 3 Switching|Layer-3]] network. To reduce the chance that the audio is corrupted, [[quality of service]] (QoS) is set to ensure that the packets are given priority over other network traffic.

A '''backhoe loader''', also called a '''loader backhoe''', '''digger''' in layman's terms, or colloquially shortened to '''backhoe''' within the industry, is a [[heavy equipment (construction)|heavy equipment]] vehicle that consists of a [[tractor]] like unit fitted with a [[Loader (equipment)|loader]]-style [[shovel]]/[[bucket (excavator)|bucket]] on the front and a [[backhoe]] on the back. Due to its (relatively) small size and versatility, backhoe loaders are very common in [[urban engineering]] and small construction projects (such as building a small house, fixing urban roads, etc.) as well as developing countries. This type of machine is similar to and derived from what is now known as a TLB (Tractor-Loader-Backhoe), which is to say, an agricultural tractor fitted with a front loader and rear backhoe attachment.

The true development of the backhoe actually began in 1947 by the inventors that started the Wain-Roy Corporation of Hubbardston, Massachusetts. In 1947 Wain-Roy Corporation developed and tested the first actual backhoes. In April 1948 Wain-Roy Corporation sold the very first all hydraulic backhoes, mounted to a [[Ford Model 8N]] tractor, to the Connecticut Light and Power Company for the sum of $705.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digrock.com/originalbackhoe.html|title=History and origin of the first hyadraulic Backhoe 1948, and the first Tractor Loader Backhoe 1951|website=www.digrock.com|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:60 Jahre Unimog - Wörth 2011 040 (5797928784).jpg|thumb|left|Modern [[Unimog]] as a backhoe loader]]
Evolving in parallel to development in the U.S., backhoes were first produced in the UK in 1953 by [[JCB (company)|JCB]], but it was just a prototype. The world's first backhoe loader with factory warranty was introduced in the U.S. by J.I. Case in 1957. Their Model 320 was the world's first serial backhoe loader. Although based on a tractor, a backhoe loader was and is almost never called a ''tractor'' when both the [[Loader (equipment)|loader]] and the [[backhoe]] are permanently attached. Backhoe loaders are also not generally used for towing and usually do not have a [[power take-off]] (PTO) as often this is used to drive the hydraulic pump operating the attachments. When the backhoe is permanently attached, the machine usually has a seat that can swivel to the rear to face the [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] controls. Removable [[backhoe]] attachments almost always have a separate seat on the attachment itself.
[[File:Koparko ladowarka.JPG|thumb|A typical European backhoe-loader; these usually have a side-shift backhoe mount and vertical stabilizers.]]

In Britain and [[Ireland]] they are commonly referred to simply as JCBs; they are comparably called "Shinrai" in [[India]] due to the company being the major supplier. In the United States, they are often referred to as "backhoes", although the term '[[backhoe]]' only refers to one component. In [[Russia]] they are referred as [[excavator]]-[[loader (equipment)|loader]]s.

In 1970, Hy-Dynamic, now a division of [[Bucyrus-Erie]], manufacturer of the Dynahoe, was the first company to incorporate a [[four-wheel drive]] system into their backhoe loaders, allowing these models to go over almost any terrain with little difficulty. Since the backhoe was invented, several companies such as Caterpillar and John Deere have changed the backhoe's  back arm to be slightly curved like that of an [[excavator]], which can allow more maneuverability.

==Use==
Backhoe loaders are very common and can be used for a wide variety of tasks: construction, small demolitions, light transportation of [[building material]]s, powering building equipment, digging holes/[[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]], [[landscaping]], breaking [[asphalt]], and paving roads. Often, the backhoe bucket can also be replaced with powered attachments such as a [[breaker (hydraulic)|breaker]], [[grapple (construction)|grapple]], [[auger (drill)|auger]], or a [[stump grinder]]. Enhanced [[Articulated vehicle|articulation]] of attachments can be achieved with intermediate attachments such as the [[tiltrotator]]. Many backhoes feature [[quick coupler]] (quick-attach) mounting systems and auxiliary [[hydraulic]] circuits for simplified attachment mounting, increasing the machine's [[utilization]] on the job site. Some loader buckets have a retractable bottom or "clamshell", enabling it to empty its load more quickly and efficiently. Retractable-bottom loader buckets are also often used for grading and scraping. The front assembly may be a removable attachment or permanently mounted.

Because digging while on tires intrinsically causes the machine to rock, and the swinging weight of the backhoe could cause the vehicle to tip, most backhoe loaders use hydraulic [[outriggers]] or stabilizers at the rear when digging and lower the loader bucket for additional stability. This means that the bucket must be raised and the outriggers retracted when the vehicle needs to change positions, reducing efficiency. For this reason many companies offer miniature tracked excavators, which sacrifice the loader function and ability to be driven from site to site, for increased digging efficiency.

Their relatively small frame and precise control make backhoe-loaders very useful and common in [[civil engineering|urban engineering]] projects such as construction and repairs in areas too small for larger equipment. Their versatility and compact size makes them one of the most popular urban [[construction vehicle]]s. For larger projects, a [[caterpillar tracks|tracked]] [[excavator]] is generally used.

In recent years, small compact tractors have become very popular with private homeowners. Subcompact tractors, the size between a compact tractor and lawn tractor, are also often sold in backhoe loader setup, sometimes with a belly-mounted [[mower]] also included. These tractors offer private homeowners the ability to perform minor excavation projects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5711">'''Bioproducts engineering''' or '''bioprocess engineering''' refers to engineering of [[bio-product]]s from [[renewable]] [[bioresources]]. This pertains to the design and development of processes and technologies for the sustainable manufacture of bioproducts (materials, chemicals and energy) from renewable biological resources.

Bioproducts engineers harness the molecular building blocks of renewable resources to design, develop and manufacture environmentally friendly industrial and consumer products. From [[biofuel]]s, [[renewable energy]], and [[bioplastic]]s to paper products and "green" building materials such as bio-based composites, Bioproducts engineers are developing sustainable solutions to meet the world's growing materials and [[energy demand]]. Conventional bioproducts and emerging bioproducts are two broad categories used to categorize bioproducts. Examples of conventional bio-based products include building materials, [[pulp and paper]], and [[forest products]]. Examples of emerging bioproducts or [[biobased product]]s include [[biofuels]], [[bioenergy]], starch-based and cellulose-based [[ethanol]], bio-based adhesives, biochemicals, biodegradable plastics, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Bowyer, J.L., Ramaswamy, S., 2005: "Redefining undergraduate education for the 21st Century: Minnesota moves aggressively to strengthen program" Forest Products Journal, July-Aug 2005, 55 (7-8): 4-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramaswamy, S., Tschirner, U., Chen, Y., 2007: "Transforming Academic Curricula: Pulp and Paper to Biobased Products - Providing Education and Research Training for the Conventional and Emerging Biobased Products Industry and the Bioeconomy" ACS Symposium Series Chapter 4, Section 1, Materials, Chemicals and Energy from Forest Biomass Ed. by Argyropoulos&lt;/ref&gt; Bioproducts Engineers play a major role in the design and development of "green" products including biofuels, bioenergy, biodegradable plastics, biocomposites, building materials, paper and chemicals. Bioproducts engineers also develop energy efficient, environmentally friendly manufacturing processes for these products as well as effective end-use applications. Bioproducts engineers play a critical role in a sustainable 21st century bio-economy by using renewable resources to design, develop, and manufacture the products we use every day. The career outlook for bioproducts engineers is very bright with employment opportunities in a broad range of industries, including pulp and paper, alternative energy, renewable plastics, and other fiber, forest products, building materials and chemical-based industries.

Commonly referred to as [[bioprocess]] engineering, [[bioprocess engineering]] is a specialization of [[biotechnology]], [[biological engineering]], [[chemical engineering]] or of [[agricultural engineering]]. It deals with the design and development of equipment and processes for the manufacturing of products such as food, feed, pharmaceuticals, [[nutraceuticals]], chemicals, and polymers and paper from biological materials. Bioprocees engineering is a conglomerate of mathematics, biology and industrial design, and consists of various spectrums like designing of fermentors, study of [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentors]] (mode of operations etc.). It also deals with studying various biotechnological processes used in industries for large scale production of biological product for optimization of yield in the end product and the quality of end product. Bio process engineering may include the work of mechanical, electrical and industrial engineers to apply principles of their disciplines to processes based on using living cells or sub component of such cells.&lt;ref&gt;Bioprocess engineering- Basic concepts; Shular, Michael A., kargi, Fikret, Prentice Hall of India, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Moving from [[Category:Movie film formats]] to [[Category:Motion picture film formats]] using [[c:Help:Cat-a-lot|Cat-a-lot]]</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5349">In '''bipack color photography''' for motion pictures, two strips of black-and-white 35&amp;nbsp;mm film, running through the camera [[photographic emulsion|emulsion]] to emulsion, are used to record two regions of the color [[visible spectrum|spectrum]], for the purpose of ultimately printing the images, in [[complementary colors]], superimposed on one strip of film. The result is a multicolored projection print that reproduces a useful but limited range of color by the [[subtractive color]] method. Bipack processes became commercially practical in the early 1910s when [[Eastman Kodak Company|Kodak]] introduced [[duplitized film]] print stock, which facilitated making two-color prints.

Bipack photography was, from about 1935 to 1950, the most economical means of 35&amp;nbsp;mm [[natural color]] cinematography available, used when color was wanted but the budget could not bear the much higher cost of three-strip [[Technicolor]] or the less well-known alternative three-color processes sometimes available outside the US. After 1950, when economical "monopack" color negative and print stocks such as [[Eastmancolor]] and [[Ansco Color]] were introduced, the use of bipack photography and printing rapidly declined. By 1955 all two-color motion picture processes were commercially extinct in the US.

Bipack and three-element tripack sandwiches of [[photographic plate|plates]] and films were used in some early color processes for still photography, the field in which the concept originated.

==How it works==
[[Image:bipack.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A diagram showing the configuration of the bipack color system in the camera. Note the red-dyed orthochromatic stock being used as a red filter in front of the panchromatic stock in bipack.]] Bipack color refers to the type of camera load that is used for the effect.  [[Bipack]] photography refers to two strips running through the camera at once, for the purpose of recording two different spectra of light, generally.

Color photography begins with any standard camera.  Special magazines or adapters must be provided to accommodate two separate rolls of film.  Two films are loaded, passing through the photographing aperture with the emulsions towards each other.  The front film is [[orthochromatic]], to record the blue-green portion of the picture.  On the surface of its emulsion is a red-dye layer equivalent to a [[Wratten number|Wratten 23A]] filter.  The rear film is [[panchromatic film|panchromatic]], and being photographed through the red coating of the front film, records only the red-orange components of the picture.  No filtering is necessary either for exterior or interior photography, as all necessary color corrections are made by adjusting the development of the two negatives during printing.

Since the image must be focused on the plane of contact of the two negatives used, lenses and focusing screens used in bipack photography would be readjusted to throw the plane of focus .006" behind that of the standard black-and-white plane.

Care would be taken to avoid photographing objects of purple, lavender or pink coloring, as bipack color generally cannot reproduce these colors in printing.

After processing the two negatives, the red and cyan records were printed separately on a single strip of Eastman or DuPont duplitized stock. Since the red negative was reversed in camera (that is, its emulsion away from the lens), there was no optical printing required to focus the image, and thus contact printing on both emulsions took place.  Both sides were [[Film tinting|toned]] by floating each side in a tank with the complementary colors (cyan for the side exposed with the red negative and vice versa) using toning chemicals or through dye mordanting.

==Bipack color processors==
Over the years, a great number of bipack color processors existed, largely due to the lack of holding patents on processing in this method.  These systems included:

*[[Kodachrome]] (1915), Eastman-Kodak's first color system
*[[Prizma]] (1918–1928)
*[[Brewster Color]] (1913-193?)
*[[Magnacolor]] (1928-194?), by Consolidated Film, a direct offshoot of Prizma
*Colorcraft (1929)
*Harriscolor (1929)
*[[Multicolor]] (1929–1932), a company financed by [[Howard Hughes]]
*Photocolor (1930)
*Sennettcolor (1930)
*DuPack Process (1932)
*[[Cinecolor]] (1932–1954), the most popular bi-pack processor, an offshoot of Multicolor
*Polychrome
*Kesdacolor
*Douglass Color (second process)
*Dascolor
*Cinefotocolor
*Colorfilm process

In addition, Consolidated Film also owned the [[Trucolor]] color system, which was shot as bipack color, but processed with special duplitized stock produced by the Eastman Kodak company that carried a dye-coupler.

For the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]], the [[Technicolor|Technicolor Corporation]] devised a bipack color filming process – dubbed "Technichrome" – whereby hundreds of hours of film documented the Olympics in color, without having to ship expensive and heavy Technicolor cameras to London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/oldcolor/technicolor1.htm Widescreen Museum entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1470">The '''Boston Society of Civil Engineers''', now the ''Boston Society of Civil Engineers Section of the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]'' was established in 1848.  It claims to be the oldest engineering society in the [[United States]] by four years, and has over 4,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsces.org/index.cfm/page/About-Us/pid/10251 About Us] Boston Society of Civil Engineers Section&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ASCE 150th anniversary publication in 2002, the BSCE founding members, including [[James Laurie]] met at the ''U.S. Hotel'' in [[Boston]] on April 26, 1848, four years before the founding of the ASCEA.  Laurie became the first president if the ASCEA (which originally included Architects in its name) in 1852.  From 1855  - 57, when the [[American Institute of Architects]] was formed out of the AFSCEA,  and until 1867,  that organization  did little.

In 1867, the AFSCEA found its five shares of the [[New York Central Railroad]] on which enough dividends had accrued and went back into business.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cLj2TN9gBU8C&amp;pg=PA191 Civil Engineering Magazine 150th Anniversary Edition: Celebrating the Greatest Profession]  Anne Elizabeth Powell; ASCE Publications, Jan 1, 2002 ; 340 pages; page 191&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company was established by [[Charles Wang]] and [[Russell Artzt]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eweek.com/enterprise-apps/ca-changes-name-to-ca-technologies|title=CA Changes Name to CA Technologies|work=eWEEK|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite web |website=WSJ.com Wall Street Journal

CA-SORT's [[sorting algorithm]]s and the product's performance (mostly on the [[DOS/360 and successors|DOS/VS]] [[computing platform]]), combined with modest pricing, led to rapid growth in the North American market. 

===1980s===
Throughout the decade, the company grew rapidly via several acquisitions.

In 1987, CA's stock began trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] using the ticker symbol "CA" following its time on the [[NASDAQ]] (1981-1987) using the stock symbol "CASI". As the decade ended, CA became the first software company after Microsoft to exceed $1 billion in sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/04/nyregion/big-employer-on-li-agrees-to-stay-there.html|title=Big Employer On L.I.

===1990s===
Early in the decade, CA was forced to address criticism of the company as well as a sharp decline in its stock price, which fell more than 50% during 1990. The ensuing changes included a push into foreign markets (Japan, Canada, [[Africa]], [[Latin America]]), reform in how the company charged its customers for software maintenance, and improved compatibility with products from other vendors such as [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP), [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]], and [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC). In 1994, CA acquired the [[ASK Group]] and continued to offer the [[Ingres (database)|Ingres]] database management system under a variety of brand names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|date=1999 |isbn=0309062780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CA continued its expansion through acquisitions. Legent Corporation was acquired for $1.78 billion in 1995, at that time the biggest-ever acquisition in the software industry, and Cheyenne Software for $1.2 billion in 1996. CA executed the software industry's then-largest acquisition ($3.5 billion) via [[Platinum Technology]] International in 1999.

===2000s===
By 2000, CA had acquired about 200 companies. At this time, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] limited CA's acquisitions. The company refinanced large amounts of debt, and a [[proxy fight|proxy battle]] between the board and shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E4DE1630F932A15755C0A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Entrepreneur to Begin Proxy Fight for Computer Associates, '&amp;#39;New York Times,'&amp;#39; June 21, 2001 |work=New York Times |date=June 21, 2001 |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |first=Alex |last=Berenson}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also questions regarding executive compensation, accounting methods, and insider-trading by its then CEO and chairman, [[Sanjay Kumar (business executive)|Sanjay Kumar]].

In 2000, Sanjay Kumar replaced [[Charles Wang]] as [[Chief Executive Officer]]. In 2002, Kumar became [[Chairman]] of Computer Associates' [[board of directors]].  In 2006, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison and fined $8 million for his role in a massive accounting fraud at Computer Associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Controversies==
In 1992, the company was sued by [[Electronic Data Systems]] (EDS), a CA customer. EDS accused CA of breach of contract,  misuse of copyright and violations of anti-trust laws. CA filed a counter-claim, also alleging breach of contract, including copyright infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets.&lt;ref name="CA-Technologies-Mar-1994-10-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2718/4073094000002/filing-main.htm |title=CA Technologies, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Mar 29, 1994 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The companies reached a settlement in 1996.&lt;ref name="CA_History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ca.com/us/about/content.aspx?cid=120941 |title=CA History |publisher=Ca.com |date=September 22, 2008 |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111023256/http://www.ca.com/us/about/content.aspx?cid=120941 |archivedate=January 11, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Funding_Universe_History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Computer-Associates-International-Inc-Company-History.html |title=Company History |publisher=Fundinguniverse.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1998, an unsuccessful and hostile takeover bid by CA for computer consulting firm [[Computer Sciences Corporation]] (CSC) prompted a bribery suit by CSC's chairman Van Honeycutt against CA's founder and then CEO, [[Charles Wang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1998/0518/6110098a_print.html |title=A pain in the posterior, '&amp;#39;Forbes,'&amp;#39; May 18, 1998 |work=Forbes |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Wang received the largest bonus in history at that time from a public company. The receipt of a $670 million stock grant that dated to the vesting of a 1995 [[stock option]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corporatenarc.com/cascandal.php |title=Computer Associates Accounting Scandal |publisher=Corporatenarc.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929074250/http://www.corporatenarc.com/cascandal.php |archive-date=September 29, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; occurred while the company faced a slowdown in European markets and an economic slump in Asia, both of which had affected CA's earnings and stock price. In total, the company took a $675 million after-tax charge for $1.1 billion in payouts to Wang and other top CA executives.&lt;ref name="Funding_Universe_History" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_16/b3625017.htm |title=Executive Pay: Up, Up and Away, '&amp;#39;Business Week'&amp;#39; Online, April 19, 1999 |work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |date=April 19, 1999 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3414">'''CHEMKIN''' is a [[proprietary software]] tool for solving complex chemical [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]] problems.  It is used worldwide in the [[combustion]],&lt;ref&gt;
Daly, D. and Nag, P., "Combustion Modeling of Soot Reduction in Diesel and Alternate Fuels using CHEMKIN®," SAE Technical Paper 2001-01-1239, 2001, {{doi|10.4271/2001-01-1239}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[chemical]] processing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/0010-2180(86)90018-0 | volume=65 | title=Kinetic modeling and sensitivity analysis of nitrogen oxide formation in well-stirred reactors | journal=Combustion and Flame | pages=177–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[microelectronics]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} and [[automotive]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} industries, and also in atmospheric science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brady | first1 = BB | last2 = Martin | first2 = LR | year = 1995 | title = Use of SURFACE CHEMKIN to model multiphase atmospheric chemistry: Application to nitrogen tetroxide spills | doi = 10.1016/1352-2310(94)00304-4 | journal = Atmospheric Environment | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 715–726}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally developed at [[Sandia National Laboratories]] and is now developed by a US company, [[Reaction Design]].

CHEMKIN solves thousands of reaction combinations to develop a comprehensive understanding of a particular process, which might involve multiple chemical species, concentration ranges, and gas temperatures.

Chemical kinetics simulation software allows for a more time-efficient investigation of a potential new process compared to direct laboratory investigation{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}.

One important driver for the development and use of CHEMKIN is the reduction of pollutants, such as [[NOx]].  As these pollutants become more tightly regulated through agreements by agencies such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and the California Air Resource Board (CARB), researchers are making increasing use of [[simulation]] technology{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}.

One limitation of CHEMKIN is that it assumes the reaction vessel has a relatively simple geometry{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}, whereas sometimes this is not the case.  For that reason, a related program called KINetics is often used in conjunction with [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] tools.  CFD programs are better able to account for geometric complexity, at the expense of being more limited in their treatment of the underlying chemistry of the reactive process being studied{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}.

Reaction Design was acquired by ANSYS in 2014 so Chemkin and related products are now available through ANSYS. &lt;ref&gt;Quickie: ANSYS to acquire Reaction Design http://schnitgercorp.com/2013/12/04/quickie-ansys-acquire-reaction-design/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CM''' (formerly called CM Telecom) is a mobile services company based in the [[Netherlands]]. The company was formed in 1999, and provides a number of different software solutions for direct messaging, [[:Category:VoIP companies|VoIP messaging]], [[ecommerce]] payments and digital identification. In 2006, it was ranked by [[Deloitte]] as one of the fastest growing Dutch tech companies.

In recent years, CM has acquired a number of messaging and media startups. CM is the main sponsor of football club [[NAC Breda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NAC Breda en hoofdsponsor langer met elkaar door|url=http://www.fcupdate.nl/voetbalnieuws/292022/nac-breda-en-hoofdsponsor-langer-met-elkaar-door/?via=indexdotco|publisher=FCUpdate.nl|date=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
CM was founded in February 1999 by Jeroen van Glabbeek and Gilbert Gooijers. In the company's first year, it was known as ClubMessage B.V. The company's main product at the time GroupText, used by event organisers to distribute information to clubbers and event attendees. The software was predominantly used across the [[Benelux]] by large nightlife venues to promote their nights and DJ events.

'''Catalyst poisoning''' refers to the partial or total deactivation of a [[catalyst]].  Poisoning is caused by [[chemical compound]]s. Although usually undesirable, poisoning may be helpful when it results in improved selectivity.  For example, [[Lindlar's catalyst]] is poisoned so that it selectively catalyzes the reduction of alkynes.  On the other hand [[Lead]] from leaded gasoline deactivates [[Catalytic converter#Damage|catalytic converters]].

Poisoning is one of several mechanisms for the deactivation of a catalyst.  Other mechanisms include [[sintering]], [[coking]], and [[Phase transition|solid-state transformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Catalyst Deactivation|authors=Forzatti, P.; Lietti, L.|journal=Catalysis Today|year=1999|volume=52|pages=165-181|doi=10.1016/S0920-5861(99)00074-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bartholomew|first1=Calvin H|title=Mechanisms of Catalyst Deactivation|journal=Applied Catalysis A: General|volume=212|issue=1–2|pages=17–60|doi=10.1016/S0926-860X(00)00843-7|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poisoning process==
Poisoning often involves compounds that [[Chemical bond|bond chemically]] to the active surface sites of a catalyst. Poisoning decreases the number of catalytic sites or the fraction of the total surface area that has the capability of promoting reaction always decreases, and the average distance that a reactant molecule must diffuse through the pore structure before undergoing reaction may increase.&lt;ref name=Hill1977&gt;Charles G. Hill, ''An Introduction To Chemical EngineDesign'', John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., 1977 {{ISBN|0-471-39609-5}}, page 464&lt;/ref&gt; Poisoned sites can no longer accelerate the reaction with which the catalyst was supposed to catalyze.&lt;ref name=hagen06&gt;Jens Hagen, ''Industrial catalysis: a practical approach '',Wiley-VCH, 2006 {{ISBN|3-527-31144-0}}, page 197&lt;/ref&gt; Large scale production of substances such as [[ammonia]] in the [[Haber–Bosch process]] include steps to remove potential poisons from the product stream.

When the poisoning reaction rate is slow relative to the rate of diffusion, the poison will be evenly distributed throughout the catalyst and will result in [[homogeneous]] poisoning of the catalyst. Conversely, if the reaction rate is fast compared to the rate of diffusion, a poisoned shell will form on the exterior layers of the catalyst, a situation known as "pore-mouth" poisoning, and the rate of catalytic reaction may become limited by the rate of diffusion through the inactive shell.&lt;ref name=Hill1977/&gt;

==Common catalyst poisons==
Organic functional groups and inorganic anions often have the ability to strongly adsorb to metal surfaces, i.e. they are poisons. Common catalyst poisons include the following: carbon monoxide, halide, cyanide, sulfide, sulfite, and phosphite and organic molecules such as nitriles, nitros, oximes and nitrogen-containing heterocycles. Agents vary their catalytic properties because of the nature of the transition metal.

==Selective poisoning==
If the catalyst and reaction conditions are indicative of a low effectiveness factor, selective poisoning may be observed, which is a phenomenon where poisoning of only a small fraction of the catalyst surface gives a disproportionately large drop in activity. Mathematical models exist which describe the cases where the interaction of the poisoning process with the influence of the intraparticle diffusion on the rates of the primary and poisoning reactions leads to an interesting relations between observed catalytic activity and the fraction of surface poisoned.&lt;ref name=Hill1977/&gt;

By combining a material balance over a differential element of pore length and the [[Thiele modulus]], the equation is found:

:&lt;math&gt; \eta =\frac{\tanh h_{\rm p}}{h_{\rm p}} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''η'' is the effectiveness factor of the poisoned surface and ''h&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the Thiele modulus for the poisoned case.

When the ratio of the reaction rate for the poisoned pore to the unpoisoned pore is considered, the following equation can be found:

:&lt;math&gt; F =\frac{\sqrt{1-\alpha} \tanh \left (h_{\rm T}  \sqrt{1-\alpha} \right) }{\tanh h_{\rm T}} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''F'' is the ratio of rates of poisoned and unpoisoned pores, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is the Thiele modulus for the unpoisoned case, and ''α'' is the fraction of the surface that is poisoned.

The above equation simplifies depending on the value of ''h''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;. When ''h''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is small, meaning that the surface is available, the equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; F = 1 - \alpha &lt;/math&gt;

This represents the "classical case" of nonselective poisoning where the fraction of the activity remaining is equal to the fraction of the unpoisoned surface remaining.

When ''h''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is very large, it becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; F = \sqrt{1- \alpha} &lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the catalyst effectiveness factors are considerably less than unity, and the effects of the portion of the poison adsorbed near the closed end of the pore are not as apparent as when ''h''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is small.

Delving further into the mathematical relationships of selective poisoning, or "Pore-Mouth" poisoning, looking at the steady-state conditions, the rate of diffusion of the reactant through the poisoned region is equal to the rate of reaction. The rate of diffusion is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \vec{v}_{\rm diffusion} = -\pi  \langle r^2 \rangle  D  \vec{\nabla} c &lt;/math&gt;

And the rate of reaction within a pore is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; v = \eta \pi \langle r \rangle (1-\alpha)  \langle L \rangle k_1'' c_{\rm c} &lt;/math&gt;

Through further manipulation and substitution, the fraction of the catalyst surface available for reaction can be obtained from the ratio of the poisoned reaction rate to the unpoisoned reaction rate:

:&lt;math&gt; F =\frac{v_{\rm poisoned}}{v_{\rm unpoisoned}} &lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt; F = \frac{\tanh[(1-\alpha)  h_{\rm T}]}{\tanh h_{\rm T}}  \frac{1}{1 + \alpha h_{\rm T}  \tanh[(1-\alpha) h_{\rm T}]} &lt;/math&gt;

where, as before, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is the Thiele modulus for the unpoisoned case, and ''α'' is the fraction of the surface that is poisoned.&lt;ref name=Hill1977/&gt;{{rp|465}}

==Benefits of selective poisoning==
Usually, catalyst poisoning is undesirable as it leads to a loss of usefulness of expensive noble metals or their complexes. However, poisoning of catalysts can be used to improve selectivity of reactions. Poisoning can allow for selective intermediates to be isolated and final products with desirable stereochemistry to be achieved.

==Examples==

===Palladium catalyst===
Poisoning of palladium and platinum catalysts has been extensively researched. As a rule of thumb, [[platinum]] (as [[Adams' catalyst]], platinum oxide finely divided on carbon) is less susceptible. Common poisons for these two metals are sulfur and nitrogen-heterocycles like pyridine and quinoline.

====Intentional palladium catalyst poisoning====

In some cases, a highly active catalyst can lead to undesirable secondary reactions with the desired product.  In some of these cases, the addition of a small amount of a catalyst poison increases the yield of the desired product by lower the catalyst activity. For example, in the classical "[[Rosenmund reduction]]" of an [[acyl chloride]] to the corresponding [[aldehyde]], the [[palladium]] catalyst (over [[barium sulfate]] or [[calcium carbonate]]) is intentionally poisoned by the addition of [[sulfur]] or [[quinoline]] in order to lower the catalyst activity and thereby prevent further reduction of the aldehyde product to yield a primary alcohol.  In the case of [[Lindlar's catalyst]], [[palladium]] is poisoned with a [[lead]] salt to allow reduction of an alkyne to the corresponding alkene while preventing reduction of the alkene product to the corresponding alkane.

===Hydrodesulfurization catalysts===

In the purification of crude petroleum products the process of hydrodesulfurization is utilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/adma.200600912| title = MoS2–Ni Nanocomposites as Catalysts for Hydrodesulfurization of Thiophene and Thiophene Derivatives| journal = Advanced Materials| volume = 18| issue = 19| pages = 2561| year = 2006| last1 = Cheng| first1 = F. Y| last2 = Chen| first2 = J| last3 = Gou| first3 = X. L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thiol containing hydrocarbons, such as thiophene, are reduced using H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in order to produce H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and different length chains of hydrocarbons. Common catalyst used are tungsten and molybdenum sulfide particles. By adding cobalt and nickel &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1006/jcat.2001.3203| title = Promoting Synergy in CoW Sulfide Hydrotreating Catalysts by Chelating Agents| journal = Journal of Catalysis| volume = 200| pages = 194| year = 2001| last1 = Kishan| first1 = G| last2 = Coulier| first2 = L| last3 = Van Veen| first3 = J.A.R| last4 = Niemantsverdriet| first4 = J.W}}&lt;/ref&gt; nuclei to either edge s or partially incorporating them into the crystal lattice structure can create more efficient catalyst. The synthesis of the catalyst creates a supported hybrid that prevents poisoning of the cobalt nuclei that may be unstable in the mono-nuclear form.

===Catalytic converter===
A [[catalytic converter]] for an automobile can be poisoned if the vehicle is operated on [[gasoline]] containing lead additives. [[Fuel cell]]s running on hydrogen must use very pure reactants, free of sulfur and carbon compounds.[[File:Magnaflow catalytic converter.JPG|thumbnail|left|Example of Catalytic Converter used in the Automotive Industry]]

===Nickel===
[[Raney nickel]] catalysts have reduced activity when it is in combination with mild steel. The loss in activity of the catalyst can be overcome by having a lining of epoxy or other substances.

[[File:Bending.jpg|thumb|Probing for "bends" using a jeweler's screwdriver and alligator clips]]
'''Circuit bending''' is the creative, chance-based customization of the circuits within electronic devices such as low-[[voltage]], battery-powered [[guitar effects]], children's [[toy]]s and [[digital synthesizer]]s to create new musical or visual instruments and sound generators.

Emphasizing spontaneity and randomness, the techniques of circuit bending have been commonly associated with [[noise music]], though many more conventional contemporary musicians and musical groups have been known to experiment with "bent" instruments. Circuit bending usually involves dismantling the machine and adding components such as switches and [[potentiometer]]s that alter the circuit.

== Experimental process ==

[[Image:1989 Kawasaki Electronic Digital Guitar by Remco circuit bend 2.jpg|thumb|right|A 1989 Kawasaki toy guitar used in a circuit bending project]]
Circuit bending is experimenting with second-hand electronics in a DIY fashion. Inexpensive keyboards, [[drum machine]]s, and electronic children's toys (not necessarily designed for music production) are commonly used. Typically, this is done with battery-powered devices. Random modifications to devices plugged into the wall can result in fire or electrocution.

Aesthetic value, immediate usability and highly randomized results are often factors in the process of successfully "bending" electronics. Although the history of [[electronic music]] is often associated with unconventional sonic results, innovators like [[Robert Moog]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4811694|title=Robert Moog: Music Pioneer|date=23 August 2005|work=NPR.org|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Léon Theremin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uh.edu/engines/epi1818.htm|title=No. 1818: Leon Theremin|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; were [[electrical engineers]], and were typically more concerned with the consistency of their instruments. In contrast, circuit bending is typified by inconsistencies in instruments built in an unscientific manner. While many pre-fitted circuit bent machines are sold on auction sites such as [[eBay]], this somewhat contravenes the intention of most practitioners. Machines bent to a repeated configuration are more analogous to the well known practice of "mods", such as the Devilfish mod for the [[Roland TB-303]], the famous [[Speak &amp; Spell (toy)|Speak &amp; Spell]] toys or various [[Analogman]] or Pedaldoc guitar pedal circuit modifications.

Circuit bending an audio device typically involves removing the rear panel of the device and connecting any two circuit locations with a "jumper" wire, sending current from one part of the circuit into another.  Results are monitored through either the device's internal speaker or by connecting an amplifier to the speaker output. If an interesting effect is achieved, this connection would be marked for future reference or kept active by either soldering a new connection or bridging it with [[crocodile clip]]s.  Often other components are inserted at these points such as pushbuttons or switches, to turn the effect on or off; or components such as [[resistor]]s or [[capacitor]]s, to change the quality of the audio output. This is repeated on a trial and error basis.  Other components added into the circuit can give the performer more expressiveness, such as [[potentiometer]]s, [[photoresistor]]s (for reaction to light) and pressure sensors.

[[File:Yamaha PSR-6 circuit bended @ Dorkbot Helsinki 2007.jpg|thumb|right|A Yamaha PSR-6 used in a circuit bending project.]]
The simplest input, and the one most identified with circuit bending, is the body contact,&lt;ref name="Ghazala-BC"&gt;[[Reed Ghazala]]: http://www.anti-theory.com/soundart/circuitbend/cb14.html&lt;/ref&gt; where the performer's touch causes the circuit to change the sound.  Often metal knobs, plates, screws or studs are wired to these circuit points to give easier access to these points from the outside the case of the device.
  
Since creative experimentation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anti-theory.com/soundart/circuitbend/cb06.html|title=circuit-bending|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a key element to the practice of circuit bending, there is always a possibility that short circuiting may yield undesirable results, including component failure. In particular, connecting the power supply or a capacitor directly to a computer chip lead can destroy the chip and make the device inoperable. Before beginning to do circuit bending, a person should learn the basic risk factors about working with electrical and electronic products, including how to identify capacitors (which can give a person a serious shock due to the electrical charge that they store), and how to avoid risks with [[AC power plugs and sockets|AC power]]. For safety reasons, a circuit bender should have a few basic electronics tools, such as a [[multimeter]] (an electronic testing device which measures voltage, resistance and other factors). It is advised that beginner circuit benders should ''never'' "bend" any device that gets its power from [[mains electricity]] (household AC power), as this would carry a serious risk of electrocution. Circuit bending can also be carried out in interactive electronic [[audio games]]. People modify their electronic games to enhance the quality of recordings used for fan-made projects or to change the speed of the game which results in a pitch change. This makes the gameplay easier, especially if the game gets impossibly fast.  Adding a knob or a switch to change the pitch of the game can lead to some disadvantages which include the game can change its pitch slightly when its lights are turned on, and it can cause the batteries to drain out quickly on high speeds.

== Innovators==
Although similar methods were previously used by other musicians and engineers, this method of music creation is believed to have been pioneered by [[Reed Ghazala]] in the 1960s. Ghazala's experience with circuit-bending began in 1966 when a toy [[transistor]] [[amplifier]], by chance, shorted-out against a metal object in his desk drawer, resulting in a stream of unusual sounds.&lt;ref name="Ghazala"&gt;[[Reed Ghazala]]: ''Circuit-Bending, Build Your Own Alien Instruments'', [[Extreme Tech]], 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  While Ghazala says that he was not the first circuit bender, he coined the term Circuit Bending &lt;ref name="Ghazala-EMI"&gt;[[Reed Ghazala]]: "Circuit-Bending and Living Instruments," EMI Volume VIII #1, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and whole-heartedly promoted the proliferation of the concept and practice through his writings and internet site, earning him the title "Father of Circuit Bending".

[[Serge Tcherepnin]], designer of the [[Serge modular synthesizer]]s, discussed&lt;ref&gt;Vail, Mark: ''Vintage Synthesizers: Pioneering Designers, Groundbreaking Instruments, Collecting Tips, Mutants of Technology'', Backbeat Books; 2.00 edition (15 March 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; his early experiments in the 1950s with the [[transistor radio]], in which he found sensitive circuit points in those simple electronic devices and brought them out to "body contacts" on the plastic chassis. Prior to Mark's and Reed's experiments other pioneers also explored the body-contact idea, one of the earliest being [[Thaddeus Cahill]] (1897) whose [[telharmonium]], it is reported, was also touch-sensitive.

Since 1984, Swiss duo [[Voice Crack]] created music by manipulating common electronic devices in a practice they termed "cracked everyday electronics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paristransatlantic.com/magazine/monthly2008/12dec_text.html#3|title=YULE 2008|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Chicago is host to a longtime community of circuit bending innovation, including the performance/teaching duo Roth Mobot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rothmobot.com/ |website=Roth Mobot |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who introduced such techniques as the voltage starving Waldeck Interruptor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://getlofi.com/waldeck-interrupter-circuit-bending-without-opening-the-toy/ |website=GetLofi |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were nominated for Prix Ars Electronica's Digital Communities award in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Flamm |first1=Terrence |title=Roth Mobot: Circuit Bending for |url=https://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/roth-mobot-circuit-bending-all |website=Built in Chicago |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roth Mobot's Patrick McCarthy hosted a long-running circuit bending class at the Old Town School of Folk Music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Roach |first1=Michael |title=Trick out your toys |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/g00/news/ct-xpm-2006-01-19-0601180241-story.html?i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%3D&amp;i10c.ua=1&amp;i10c.dv=14 |website=Chicago Tribune |publisher=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and currently runs the Museum of Science and Industry's Fab Lab, incorporating digital fabrication techniques alongside creative circuitry experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WEAVING CONNECTIONS: PATRICK MCCARTHY AND EXPERIMENTAL ELECTRONICS |url=https://voicedjournal.wordpress.com/2016/09/12/weaving-connections-patrick-mccarthy-and-experimental-electronics/ |website=TAD Studio Journal |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent local innovators include Chicago Art Institute professor [[Nicolas Collins]], author of the influential text Handmade Electronic Music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nicolascollins.com/handmade.htm |website=Handmade Electronic Music |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Alex Inglizian, chief engineer at Experimental Sound Studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Margasak |first1=Peter |title=How will ESS replace Lou Mallozzi? |url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/experimental-sound-studio-executive-director-lou-mallozzi-resignation/Content?oid=21684346 |publisher=Chicago Reader |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Et baal.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[flame]]s caused as a result of a [[fuel]] undergoing combustion (burning)]]
[[File:Regenerative thermal oxidizer.jpg|thumb|[[Regenerative thermal oxidiser|Air pollution abatement equipment]] provides combustion control for [[industry|industrial processes]].]]
'''Combustion''', or '''burning''',&lt;ref&gt;colloquial meaning of burning is combustion accompanied by flames&lt;/ref&gt; is a high-temperature [[exothermic]] [[redox]] [[chemical reaction]] between a [[fuel]] (the reductant) and an [[oxidant]], usually atmospheric [[oxygen]], that produces oxidized, often gaseous products, in a mixture termed as [[smoke]]. Combustion in a [[fire]] produces a [[flame]], and the [[heat]] produced can make combustion self-sustaining. Combustion is often a complicated sequence of [[elementary reaction|elementary]] [[Radical (chemistry)|radical reactions]]. [[Solid fuel]]s, such as [[wood]] and [[coal]], first undergo [[endothermic]] [[pyrolysis]] to produce gaseous fuels whose combustion then supplies the heat required to produce more of them. Combustion is often hot enough that [[incandescence|incandescent]] [[light]] in the form of either [[Smouldering|glowing]] or a [[flame]] is produced. A simple example can be seen in the combustion of [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] into [[water]] [[vapor]], a reaction commonly used to fuel [[rocket engine]]s. This reaction releases 242&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol of heat and reduces the [[enthalpy]] accordingly (at constant temperature and pressure):

: 2{{chem|H|2}}(g) + {{chem|O|2}}(g) → 2{{H2O}}(g)

Combustion of an organic fuel in air is always exothermic because the double bond in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is much weaker than other double bonds or pairs of single bonds, and therefore the formation of the stronger bonds in the combustion products {{CO2}} and {{H2O}} results in the release of energy.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr 15"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidt-Rohr | first1 = K | year = 2015 | title = Why Combustions Are Always Exothermic, Yielding About 418 kJ per Mole of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; | doi = 10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00333 | journal = J. Chem. Educ. | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 2094–2099 | bibcode = 2015JChEd..92.2094S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bond energies in the fuel play only a minor role, since they are similar to those in the combustion products; e.g., the sum of the [[bond energy|bond energies]] of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is nearly the same as that of {{CO2}}. The [[heat of combustion]] is approximately -418 kJ per mole of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; used up in the combustion reaction, and can be estimated from the elemental composition of the fuel.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-Rohr 15" /&gt;

Uncatalyzed combustion in air requires fairly high temperatures. Complete combustion is [[stoichiometric]] with respect to the fuel, where there is no remaining fuel, and ideally, no remaining oxidant. Thermodynamically, the [[chemical equilibrium]] of combustion in air is overwhelmingly on the side of the products. However, complete combustion is almost impossible to achieve, since the chemical equilibrium is not necessarily reached, or may contain unburnt products such as [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen]] and even [[carbon]] ([[soot]] or ash). Thus, the produced [[smoke]] is usually toxic and contains unburned or partially oxidized products. Any combustion at high temperatures in [[Atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[air]], which is 78 percent [[nitrogen]], will also create small amounts of several [[nitrogen oxides]], commonly referred to as {{NOx}}, since the combustion of nitrogen is thermodynamically favored at high, but not low temperatures. Since combustion is rarely clean, flue gas cleaning or [[catalytic converter]]s may be required by law.

[[Fire]]s occur naturally, ignited by [[lightning]] strikes or by [[volcanic]] products. Combustion ([[fire]]) was the first controlled chemical reaction discovered by humans, in the form of [[campfire]]s and [[bonfire]]s, and continues to be the main method to produce energy for humanity. Usually, the fuel is [[carbon]], [[hydrocarbon]]s or more complicated mixtures such as [[wood]] that contains partially oxidized hydrocarbons. The thermal energy produced from combustion of either [[fossil fuel]]s such as [[coal]] or [[oil]], or from [[renewable fuel]]s such as [[firewood]], is harvested for diverse uses such as [[cooking]], production of [[electricity]] or industrial or domestic heating. Combustion is also currently the only reaction used to power [[rocket]]s. Combustion is also used to destroy ([[incineration|incinerate]]) waste, both nonhazardous and hazardous.

Oxidants for combustion have high oxidation potential and include atmospheric or pure [[oxygen]], [[chlorine]], [[fluorine]], [[chlorine trifluoride]], [[nitrous oxide]] and [[nitric acid]]. For instance, [[hydrogen]] burns in [[chlorine]] to form [[hydrogen chloride]] with the liberation of heat and light characteristic of combustion. Although usually not catalyzed, combustion can be catalyzed by [[platinum]] or [[vanadium]], as in the [[contact process]].

==Types==

===Complete and incomplete===
{{see also|pyrolysis}}

====Complete====
[[File:Combustion reaction of methane.jpg|thumb|370px|The combustion of [[methane]], a [[hydrocarbon]].]]
In complete combustion, the reactant burns in oxygen, and produces a limited number of products. When a [[hydrocarbon]] burns in oxygen, the reaction will primarily yield carbon dioxide and water.  When elements are burned, the products are primarily the most common oxides. Carbon will yield [[carbon dioxide]], sulfur will yield [[sulfur dioxide]], and iron will yield [[iron(III) oxide]]. Nitrogen is not considered to be a combustible substance when oxygen is the [[Oxidizing agent|oxidant]], but small amounts of various nitrogen oxides (commonly designated [[NOx|{{chem|NO|''x''}}]] species) form when the air is the oxidant.

Combustion is not necessarily favorable to the maximum degree of oxidation, and it can be temperature-dependent. For example, [[sulfur trioxide]] is not produced quantitatively by the combustion of sulfur. NOx species appear in significant amounts above about {{convert|2800|F|C}}, and more is produced at higher temperatures. The amount of NOx is also a function of oxygen excess.&lt;ref name="NOx formation"&gt;[http://www.alentecinc.com/papers/NOx/The%20formation%20of%20NOx_files/The%20formation%20of%20NOx.htm The formation of NOx]. Alentecinc.com. Retrieved on 2010-09-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most industrial applications and in [[fire]]s, [[air]] is the source of oxygen ({{chem|O|2}}).  In the air, each mole of oxygen is mixed with approximately {{val|3.71|ul=mol}} of nitrogen.  Nitrogen does not take part in combustion, but at high temperatures some nitrogen will be converted to [[NOx#Thermal|{{chem|NO|''x''}}]] (mostly [[Nitric oxide|{{chem|NO}}]], with much smaller amounts of [[Nitrogen dioxide|{{chem|NO|2}}]]). On the other hand, when there is insufficient oxygen to completely combust the fuel, some fuel carbon is converted to [[carbon monoxide]] and some of the hydrogen remains unreacted. A more complete set of equations for the combustion of a hydrocarbon in the air, therefore, requires an additional calculation for the distribution of oxygen between the carbon and hydrogen in the fuel.

The amount of air required for complete combustion to take place is known as theoretical air. However, in practice, the air used is 2-3x that of theoretical air.

====Incomplete====
Incomplete combustion will occur when there is not enough oxygen to allow the fuel to react completely to produce carbon dioxide and water. It also happens when the combustion is quenched by a heat sink, such as a solid surface or flame trap. Same as complete combustion, water is produced by incomplete combustion. However, [[carbon]], [[carbon monoxide]], and/or hydroxide are the products instead of carbon dioxide.

For most fuels, such as diesel oil, coal or wood, [[pyrolysis]] occurs before combustion. In incomplete combustion, products of pyrolysis remain unburnt and contaminate the smoke with noxious particulate matter and gases. Partially oxidized compounds are also a concern; partial oxidation of ethanol can produce harmful [[acetaldehyde]], and carbon can produce toxic carbon monoxide.

The quality of combustion can be improved by the designs of combustion devices, such as [[Oil burner|burners]] and [[internal combustion engines]]. Further improvements are achievable by [[catalytic]] after-burning devices (such as [[catalytic converter]]s) or by the simple partial return of the [[exhaust gas]]es into the combustion process. Such devices are required by [[environmental legislation]] for cars in most countries and may be necessary to enable large combustion devices, such as [[thermal power station]]s, to reach legal [[emission standards]].

The degree of combustion can be measured and analyzed with test equipment. [[HVAC]] contractors, [[Firefighter|firemen]] and [[engineers]] use combustion analyzers to test the [[Fuel efficiency|efficiency]] of a burner during the combustion process. In addition, the efficiency of an internal combustion engine can be measured in this way, and some U.S. states and local municipalities use combustion analysis to define and rate the efficiency of vehicles on the road today.

===== Incomplete combustion produced carbon monoxide =====
Carbon monoxide is one of the products from [[incomplete combustion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incomplete combustion process|url=https://www.greenfacts.org/glossary/ghi/incomplete-combustion-processes.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon is released in the normal incomplete combustion reaction, forming soot and dust. Since carbon monoxide is considered as a poisonous gas, complete combustion is more preferable, as carbon monoxide may also lead to respiratory troubles when breathed since it takes the place of oxygen and combines with hemoglobin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burning showing incomplete combustion|url=https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/747-what-is-fire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Problems associated with incomplete combustion=====
:Environmental problems:&lt;ref name="education.seattlepi.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Problems associated with incomplete combustion |url= http://education.seattlepi.com/environmental-problems-associated-combustion-hydrocarbons-5621.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These oxides combine with [[water]] and [[oxygen]] in the atmosphere, creating [[nitric acid]] and [[sulfuric acids]], which return to Earth's surface as acid deposition, or "acid rain." Acid deposition harms aquatic organisms and kills trees. Due to its formation of certain nutrients which are less available to plants such as calcium and phosphorus, it reduces the productivity of ecosystem and farms. An additional problem associated with [[nitrogen oxides]] is that they, along with [[hydrocarbon]] pollutants, contribute to the formation of [[tropospheric ozone]], a major component of smog.

:Human health problems:&lt;ref name="education.seattlepi.com"/&gt;
Breathing [[carbon monoxide]] causes headache, dizziness, vomiting, and nausea. If carbon monoxide levels are high enough, humans become unconscious or die. Exposure to moderate and high levels of carbon monoxide over long periods of time are positively correlation with risk of heart disease. People who survive severe [[CO poisoning]] may suffer long-term health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon Monoxide Poisoning|url=https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showCoRisk.action}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon monoxide from air is absorbed in the lungs which then binds with [[hemoglobin]] in human's red blood cells. This would reduce the capacity of red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body.

===Smouldering===
[[Smouldering]] is the slow, low-temperature, flameless form of combustion, sustained by the heat evolved when oxygen directly attacks the surface of a condensed-phase fuel. It is a typically incomplete combustion reaction. Solid materials that can sustain a smouldering reaction include coal, [[cellulose]], [[wood]], [[cotton]], [[tobacco]], [[peat]], [[Plant litter|duff]], [[humus]], synthetic foams, charring [[polymers]] (including [[polyurethane foam]]) and [[dust]]. Common examples of smoldering phenomena are the initiation of residential fires on [[upholstered furniture]] by weak heat sources (e.g., a cigarette, a short-circuited wire) and the persistent combustion of biomass behind the flaming fronts of [[wildfire]]s.

===Rapid===
{{Disputed section|1=Explosion = detonation? Internal combustion engine: no explosion?|date=July 2016}}
[[File:15. Ослободување на големо количество енергија при согоровуање етанол.webm|thumb|right|280px|An experiment that demonstrates the large amount of energy released on combustion of ethanol. A mixture of alcohol (in this case, ethanol) vapour and air in a large plastic bottle with a small neck is ignited, resulting in a large blue flame and a 'whoosh' sound.]]
Rapid combustion is a form of combustion, otherwise known as a [[fire]], in which large amounts of heat and [[light]] energy are released, which often results in a [[flame]]. This is used in a form of machinery such as [[internal combustion engine]]s and in [[thermobaric weapon]]s. Such a combustion is frequently called an [[explosion]], though for an internal combustion engine this is inaccurate.{{Disputed inline|1=Explosion = detonation? Internal combustion engine: no explosion?|date=July 2016}} An internal combustion engine nominally operates on a controlled rapid burn. When the [[Air–fuel ratio|fuel-air mixture]] in an internal combustion engine explodes, that is known as [[Engine knocking|detonation]].{{Disputed inline|1=Explosion = detonation? Internal combustion engine: no explosion?|date=July 2016}}

===Spontaneous===
[[Spontaneous combustion]] is a type of combustion which occurs by self-heating (increase in temperature due to [[exothermic]] internal reactions), followed by thermal runaway (self-heating which rapidly accelerates to high temperatures) and finally, ignition.
For example, phosphorus self-ignites at room temperature without the application of heat.  Organic materials undergoing bacterial [[composting]] can generate enough heat to reach the point of combustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soilandmulchproducernews.com/index.php/frontpage-articles-hidden/160-a-perfect-storm-mulch-fire-dynamics-and-prevention |title=A Perfect Storm: Mulch Fire Dynamics and Prevention |publisher=Soilandmulchproducernews.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turbulent===
Combustion resulting in a turbulent flame is the most used for industrial application (e.g. [[gas turbine]]s, [[gasoline engine]]s, etc.) because the turbulence helps the mixing process between the fuel and [[oxidizer]].

===Micro-gravity===
[[Image:Microgravity Burning.jpg|thumb|Colourized gray-scale composite image of the individual frames from a video of a backlit fuel droplet burning in microgravity.]]

The term 'micro' gravity refers to a gravitational state that is 'low' (i.e., 'micro' in the sense of 'small' and not necessarily a millionth of Earth's normal gravity) such that the influence of [[buoyancy]] on physical processes may be considered small relative to other flow processes that would be present at normal gravity.  In such an environment, the thermal and [[flow transport dynamics]] can behave quite differently than in normal gravity conditions (e.g., a [[candle]]'s flame takes the shape of a sphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/history/shuttle-mir/science/mg/nm21460011.htm Shuttle-Mir History/Science/Microgravity/Candle Flame in Microgravity (CFM) – MGBX].  Spaceflight.nasa.gov (1999-07-16). Retrieved on 2010-09-28.&lt;/ref&gt;). Microgravity combustion research contributes to the understanding of a wide variety of aspects that are relevant to both the environment of a spacecraft (e.g., fire dynamics relevant to crew safety on the [[International Space Station]]) and terrestrial (Earth-based) conditions (e.g., droplet combustion dynamics to assist developing new fuel blends for improved combustion, [[materials fabrication processes]], [[Thermal management (electronics)|thermal management of electronic systems]], multiphase flow boiling dynamics, and many others).

===Micro-combustion===
Combustion processes which happen in very small volumes are considered [[micro-combustion]]. The high surface-to-volume ratio increases specific heat loss. [[Quenching]] distance plays a vital role in stabilizing the flame in such [[combustion chamber]]s.

==Chemical equations==

===Stoichiometric combustion of a hydrocarbon in oxygen===

Generally, the [[chemical equation]] for [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] combustion of a [[hydrocarbon]] in oxygen is:
: &lt;chem&gt;C_\mathit{x}H_\mathit{y}{} + \mathit{z}O2 -&gt; \mathit{x}CO2{} + \frac{\mathit{y}}{2}H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;z = x + \frac{y}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, the stoichiometric burning of [[propane]] in oxygen is:
: &lt;chem&gt;\underset{propane\atop (fuel)}{C3H8} + \underset{oxygen}{5O2} -&gt; \underset{carbon\ dioxide}{3CO2} + \underset{water}{4H2O}&lt;/chem&gt;

===Stoichiometric combustion of a hydrocarbon in air===

If the stoichiometric combustion takes place using air as the oxygen source, the [[nitrogen]] present in the air ([[Atmosphere of Earth]]) can be added to the equation (although it does not react) to show the stoichiometric composition of the fuel in air and the composition of the resultant flue gas. Note that treating all non-oxygen components in air as nitrogen gives a 'nitrogen' to oxygen ratio of 3.77, i.e. (100% - O2%) / O2% where O2% is 20.95% vol:
: &lt;math chem&gt;\ce{C}_{x} \ce{H}_{y} + z\ce{O2} + 3.77z\ce{N2 -&gt;} \ x\ce{CO2} + \frac{y}{2} \ce{H2O} + 3.77z\ce{N2}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;z = x + \frac{1}{4}y&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, the stoichiometric combustion of propane (&lt;chem&gt;C3H8&lt;/chem&gt;) in air is:
: &lt;math chem=""&gt;\ce{\underset{fuel}{C3H8} + \underset{oxygen}{5O2}} + \underset{\ce{nitrogen}}{18.87\ce{N2}} \ce{-&gt; \underset{carbon\ dioxide}{3CO2} + \underset{water}{4H2O}} + \underset{\ce{nitrogen}}{18.87\ce{N2}}&lt;/math&gt;
The stoichiometric composition of propane in air is 1 / (1 + 5 + 18.87) = 4.02% vol

===Trace combustion products===

Various other substances begin to appear in significant amounts in combustion products when the [[Adiabatic flame temperature|flame temperature]] is above about {{val|1600|ul=K}}. When excess air is used, nitrogen may oxidize to {{chem|link=nitric oxide|NO}} and, to a much lesser extent, to {{chem|link=nitrogen dioxide|NO|2}}. {{chem|link=carbon monoxide|CO}} forms by [[disproportionation]] of {{CO2}}, and {{chem|link=hydrogen|H|2}} and {{chem|link=hydroxyl radical|OH}} form by disproportionation of {{H2O}}.

For example, when {{val|1|ul=mol}} of propane is burned with {{val|28.6|ul=mol}} of air (120% of the stoichiometric amount), the combustion products contain 3.3% {{chem|O|2}}. At {{val|1400|ul=K}}, the [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] combustion products contain 0.03% {{chem|NO}} and 0.002% {{chem|OH}}. At {{val|1800|ul=K}}, the combustion products contain 0.17% {{chem|NO}}, 0.05% {{chem|OH}}, 0.01% {{chem|CO}}, and 0.004% {{chem|H|2}}.&lt;ref name="EquiWeb"&gt;[http://www.crct.polymtl.ca/equiweb.php] Equilib-Web&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diesel engines]] are run with an excess of oxygen to combust small particles that tend to form with only a stoichiometric amount of oxygen, necessarily producing [[NOx|nitrogen oxide]] emissions. Both the United States and European Union [[Emission standard|enforce limits]] to vehicle nitrogen oxide emissions, which necessitate the use of special [[catalytic converter]]s or treatment of the exhaust with [[urea]] (see [[Diesel exhaust fluid]]).

===Incomplete combustion of a hydrocarbon in oxygen===

The incomplete (partial) combustion of a [[hydrocarbon]] with oxygen produces a gas mixture containing mainly {{chem|CO|2}}, {{chem|CO}}, {{H2O}}, and {{chem|H|2}}. Such gas mixtures are commonly prepared for use as protective atmospheres for the [[Heat treating|heat-treatment]] of metals and for [[Carburizing|gas carburizing]].&lt;ref&gt;ASM Committee on Furnace Atmospheres, ''Furnace atmospheres and carbon control'', Metals Park, OH [1964].&lt;/ref&gt; The general reaction equation for incomplete combustion of one [[Mole(unit)|mole]] of a hydrocarbon in oxygen is:

: &lt;chem&gt;\underset{fuel}{C_\mathit{x} H_\mathit{y}} + \underset{oxygen}{\mathit{z} O2} -&gt; \underset{carbon \ dioxide}{\mathit{a}CO2} + \underset{carbon\ monoxide}{\mathit{b}CO} + \underset{water}{\mathit{c}H2O} + \underset{hydrogen}{\mathit{d}H2}&lt;/chem&gt;

When ''z'' falls below roughly 50% of the stoichiometric value, [[Methane|{{chem|CH|4}}]] can become an important combustion product; when ''z'' falls below roughly 35% of the stoichiometric value, elemental [[carbon]] may become stable.

The products of incomplete combustion can be calculated with the aid of a [[material balance]], together with the assumption that the combustion products reach [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Exothermic atmospheres | journal = Industrial Heating | page = 22 | date = June 2013 | url = http://www.industrialheating.com/articles/91142-exothermic-atmospheres  | accessdate = 5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ExoCalc"&gt;[http://www.industrialheating.com/ExoCalc] ExoCalc&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the combustion of one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of propane ({{chem|C|3|H|8}}) with four moles of {{chem|O|2}}, seven moles of combustion gas are formed, and ''z'' is 80% of the stoichiometric value. The three elemental balance equations are:
* Carbon: &lt;math&gt;a + b = 3&lt;/math&gt;
* Hydrogen: &lt;math&gt;2c + 2d = 8&lt;/math&gt;
* Oxygen: &lt;math&gt;2a + b + c = 8&lt;/math&gt;

These three equations are insufficient in themselves to calculate the combustion gas composition.
However, at the equilibrium position, the [[water-gas shift reaction]] gives another equation:

: &lt;chem&gt;CO + H2O -&gt; CO2 + H2&lt;/chem&gt;; &lt;math&gt;K_{eq} = \frac{a \times d}{b \times c}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, at {{val|1200|ul=K}} the value of ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' is 0.728.&lt;ref name="ReacWeb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crct.polymtl.ca/reacweb.htm |title=Reaction-Web |publisher=Crct.polymtl.ca |date= |accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solving, the combustion gas consists of 42.4% {{H2O}}, 29.0% {{CO2}}, 14.7% {{chem|H|2}}, and 13.9% {{chem|CO}}. Carbon becomes a stable phase at {{val|1200|ul=K}} and {{val|1|ul=atm}} pressure when z is less than 30% of the stoichiometric value, at which point the combustion products contain more than 98% {{chem|H|2}} and {{chem|CO}} and about 0.5% {{chem|CH|4}}.

==Fuels==
Substances or materials which undergo combustion are called [[fuel]]s. The most common examples are natural gas, propane, kerosene, diesel, petrol, charcoal, coal, wood, etc.

===Liquid fuels===

Combustion of a [[liquid fuel]] in an oxidizing atmosphere actually happens in the gas phase. It is the vapor that burns, not the liquid. Therefore, a liquid will normally catch fire only above a certain temperature: its [[flash point]]. The flash point of a liquid fuel is the lowest temperature at which it can form an ignitable mix with air. It is the minimum temperature at which there is enough evaporated fuel in the air to start combustion.

=== Gaseous fuels ===
Combustion of gaseous fuels may occur through one of four distinctive types of burning: [[diffusion flame]], [[premixed flame]], [[autoignitive reaction front]], or as a [[detonation]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradley|first=D|date=2009-06-25|title=Combustion and the design of future engine fuels|journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part C: Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science|language=en|volume=223|issue=12|pages=2751–2765|doi=10.1243/09544062jmes1519}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of burning that actually occurs depends on the degree to which the [[fuel]] and [[oxidizer]] are mixed prior to heating: for example, a diffusion flame is formed if the fuel and oxidizer are separated initially, whereas a premixed flame is formed otherwise. Similarly, the type of burning also depends on the pressure: a detonation, for example, is an autoignitive reaction front coupled to a strong shock wave giving it its characteristic high-pressure peak and high [[detonation velocity]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Solid fuels===

The act of combustion consists of three relatively distinct but overlapping phases:
* '''Preheating phase''', when the unburned [[fuel]] is heated up to its flash point and then [[fire point]]. Flammable gases start being evolved in a process similar to [[dry distillation]].
* '''Distillation phase''' or '''gaseous phase''', when the mix of evolved flammable gases with oxygen is ignited. Energy is produced in the form of heat and light. [[Flame]]s are often visible. Heat transfer from the combustion to the solid maintains the evolution of flammable vapours.
* '''Charcoal phase''' or '''solid phase''', when the output of flammable gases from the material is too low for persistent presence of flame and the [[charring|charred]] fuel does not burn rapidly and just glows and later only [[Smouldering|smoulders]].

[[File:disfig1.svg|thumb|centre|upright=1.5|A general scheme of [[polymer]] combustion]]

==Combustion management==
Efficient [[Industrial process furnaces|process heating]] requires recovery of the largest possible part of a fuel’s [[heat of combustion]] into the material being processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Calculating the heat of combustion for natural gas | journal = Industrial Heating | page = 28 | date = September 2012 | url =  http://www.industrialheating.com/articles/90561-calculating-the-heat-of-combustion-for-natural-gas | accessdate = 5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HeatCalc"&gt;[http://www.industrialheating.com/HeatCalc] HeatCalc&lt;/ref&gt; There are many avenues of loss in the operation of a heating process. Typically, the dominant loss is [[sensible heat]] leaving with the [[Exhaust gas|offgas]] (i.e., the [[flue gas]]). The temperature and quantity of offgas indicates its heat content ([[enthalpy]]), so keeping its quantity low minimizes heat loss.

In a perfect [[furnace]], the combustion air flow would be matched to the fuel flow to give each fuel molecule the exact amount of oxygen needed to cause complete combustion. However, in the real world, combustion does not proceed in a perfect manner. Unburned fuel (usually {{chem|CO}} and {{chem|H|2}}) discharged from the system represents a heating value loss (as well as a safety hazard). Since combustibles are undesirable in the offgas, while the presence of unreacted oxygen there presents minimal safety and environmental concerns, the first principle of combustion management is to provide more oxygen than is theoretically needed to ensure that all the fuel burns. For methane ({{chem|CH|4}}) combustion, for example, slightly more than two molecules of oxygen are required.

The second principle of combustion management, however, is to not use too much oxygen. The correct amount of oxygen requires three types of measurement: first, active control of air and fuel flow; second, offgas oxygen measurement; and third, measurement of offgas combustibles. For each heating process, there exists an optimum condition of minimal offgas heat loss with acceptable levels of combustibles concentration. Minimizing excess oxygen pays an additional benefit: for a given offgas temperature, the [[NOx]] level is lowest when excess oxygen is kept lowest.&lt;ref name="NOx formation" /&gt;

Adherence to these two principles is furthered by making material and heat balances on the combustion process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Making a material balance | journal = Industrial Heating | page = 20 | date = November 2012 | url =  http://www.industrialheating.com/articles/90764-making-a-material-balance | accessdate = 5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MatBalCalc"&gt;[http://www.industrialheating.com/MatBalCalc] MatBalCalc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Making a heat balance | journal = Industrial Heating | page = 22 | date = December 2012 | url =  http://www.industrialheating.com/articles/90812-making-a-heat-balance | accessdate = 5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HeatBalCalc"&gt;[http://www.industrialheating.com/HeatBalCalc] HeatBalCalc&lt;/ref&gt; The [[material balance]] directly relates the [[air/fuel ratio]] to the percentage of {{chem|O|2}} in the combustion gas. The heat balance relates the heat available for the charge to the overall net heat produced by fuel combustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Available combustion heat | journal = Industrial Heating | page = 22 | date = April 2013 | url =  http://www.industrialheating.com/articles/91014-available-combustion-heat | accessdate = 5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AvailHeatCalc"&gt;[http://www.industrialheating.com/availheatcalc] AvailHeatCalc&lt;/ref&gt; Additional material and heat balances can be made to quantify the thermal advantage from preheating the combustion air,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Making a system balance (Part 2) | journal = Industrial Heating | page = 24 | date = March 2012 | url =  http://www.industrialheating.com/articles/90954-making-a-system-balance-part-2 | accessdate = 5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SysBalCalc2"&gt;[http://www.industrialheating.com/SysBalCalc2] SysBalCalc2&lt;/ref&gt; or enriching it in oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Making a system balance (Part 1) | journal = Industrial Heating | page = 22 | date = February 2012 | url =  http://www.industrialheating.com/articles/90897-making-a-system-balance-part-1 | accessdate = 5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SysBalCalc"&gt;[http://www.industrialheating.com/sysbalcalc] SysBalCalc&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction mechanism==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
Combustion in oxygen is a [[chain reaction]] in which many distinct [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] intermediates participate. The high energy required for initiation is explained by the unusual structure of the [[dioxygen]] molecule. The lowest-energy configuration of the dioxygen molecule is a stable, relatively unreactive diradical in a [[triplet oxygen|triplet spin state]]. Bonding can be described with three bonding electron pairs and two antibonding electrons, whose [[Spin (physics)|spins]] are aligned, such that the molecule has nonzero total angular momentum. Most fuels, on the other hand, are in a singlet state, with paired spins and zero total angular momentum. Interaction between the two is quantum mechanically a "[[forbidden transition]]", i.e. possible with a very low probability. To initiate combustion, energy is required to force dioxygen into a spin-paired state, or [[singlet oxygen]]. This intermediate is extremely reactive. The energy is supplied as [[heat]], and the reaction then produces additional heat, which allows it to continue.

Combustion of hydrocarbons is thought to be initiated by hydrogen atom abstraction (not proton abstraction) from the fuel to oxygen, to give a hydroperoxide radical (HOO). This reacts further to give hydroperoxides, which break up to give [[hydroxyl radical]]s. There are a great variety of these processes that produce fuel radicals and oxidizing radicals. Oxidizing species include singlet oxygen, hydroxyl, monatomic oxygen, and [[hydroperoxyl]]. Such intermediates are short-lived and cannot be isolated. However, non-radical intermediates are stable and are produced in incomplete combustion. An example is [[acetaldehyde]] produced in the combustion of [[ethanol]]. An intermediate in the combustion of carbon and hydrocarbons, [[carbon monoxide]], is of special importance because it is a [[Poison|poisonous gas]], but also economically useful for the production of [[syngas]].

Solid and heavy liquid fuels also undergo a great number of [[pyrolysis]] reactions that give more easily oxidized, gaseous fuels. These reactions are endothermic and require constant energy input from the ongoing combustion reactions. A lack of oxygen or other poorly designed conditions result in these noxious and carcinogenic pyrolysis products being emitted as thick, black smoke.

The rate of combustion is the amount of a material that undergoes combustion over a period of time. It can be expressed in grams per second (g/s) or kilograms per second (kg/s).

Detailed descriptions of combustion processes, from the chemical kinetics perspective, requires the formulation of large and intricate webs of elementary reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Law|first1=C.K.|title=Combustion Physics|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521154215}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, combustion of hydrocarbon fuels typically involve hundreds of chemical species reacting according to thousands of reactions.

Inclusion of such mechanisms within computational flow solvers still represents a pretty challenging task mainly in two aspects. First, the number of degrees of freedom (proportional to the number of chemical species) can be dramatically large; second, the source term due to reactions introduces a disparate number of time scales which makes the whole [[dynamical system]] stiff. As a result, the direct numerical simulation of turbulent reactive flows with heavy fuels soon becomes intractable even for modern supercomputers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goussis|first1=D.|last2=Maas|first2=U.|title=Turbulent Combustion Modeling|date=2011|publisher=Springer Science|pages=193–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kinetic modelling===

The kinetic modelling may be explored for insight into the reaction mechanisms of thermal decomposition in the combustion of different materials by using for instance [[Thermogravimetric analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reyes|first1=J.A.|last2=Conesa|first2=J.A.|last3=Marcilla|first3=A.|title=Pyrolysis and combustion of polycoated cartons recycling. kinetic model and ms analysis|journal=Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis|date=2001|volume=58-59|pages=747-763|doi=10.1016/S0165-2370(00)00123-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temperature==
[[File:Zoom lunette ardente.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Lavoisier]] conducting an experiment related to combustion generated by amplified sun light.]]
Assuming perfect combustion conditions, such as complete combustion under [[adiabatic]] conditions (i.e., no heat loss or gain), the adiabatic combustion temperature can be determined. The formula that yields this temperature is based on the [[first law of thermodynamics]] and takes note of the fact that the [[heat of combustion]] is used entirely for heating the fuel, the combustion air or oxygen, and the combustion product gases (commonly referred to as the ''[[flue gas]]'').

In the case of fossil fuels burnt in air, the combustion temperature depends on all of the following:
* the [[Heat of combustion|heating value]];
* the [[air-fuel ratio|stoichiometric air to fuel ratio]] &lt;math&gt;{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;;
* the [[specific heat capacity]] of fuel and air;
* the air and fuel inlet temperatures.

The adiabatic combustion temperature (also known as the ''[[adiabatic flame temperature]]'') increases for higher heating values and inlet air and fuel temperatures and for stoichiometric air ratios approaching one.

Most commonly, the adiabatic combustion temperatures for coals are around {{convert|2200|C|0|abbr=on}} (for inlet air and fuel at ambient temperatures and for &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 1.0&lt;/math&gt;), around {{convert|2150|C|0|abbr=on}} for oil and {{convert|2000|C|0|abbr=on}} for [[natural gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Adiabatic flame temperature | journal = Industrial Heating | page = 20 | date = May 2013 | url =  http://www.industrialheating.com/articles/91062-adiabatic-flame-temperature | accessdate = 5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AFTCalc"&gt;[http://www.industrialheating.com/AFT-Calc] AFTCalc&lt;/ref&gt;

In industrial [[furnace|fired heaters]], [[power station]] [[steam generator]]s, and large [[gas turbine|gas-fired turbines]], the more common way of expressing the usage of more than the stoichiometric combustion air is ''percent excess combustion air''. For example, excess combustion air of 15 percent means that 15 percent more than the required stoichiometric air is being used.

==Instabilities==

Combustion instabilities are typically violent pressure oscillations in a combustion chamber. These pressure oscillations can be as high as 180&amp;nbsp;dB, and long-term exposure to these cyclic pressure and thermal loads reduce the life of engine components. In rockets, such as the F1 used in the Saturn V program, instabilities led to massive damage to the combustion chamber and surrounding components. This problem was solved by re-designing the fuel injector. In liquid jet engines, the droplet size and distribution can be used to attenuate the instabilities. Combustion instabilities are a major concern in ground-based gas turbine engines because of NOx emissions. The tendency is to run lean, an equivalence ratio less than 1, to reduce the combustion temperature and thus reduce the NOx emissions; however, running the combustion lean makes it very susceptible to combustion instability.

The [[Thermoacoustic hot air engine|Rayleigh Criterion]] is the basis for analysis of thermoacoustic combustion instability and is evaluated using the Rayleigh Index over one cycle of instability&lt;ref&gt;John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh, Sc.D., F.R.S., Honorary Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge; "The Theory of Sound", §322h, 1878:&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;G(x)=\frac{1}{T}\int_{T}q'(x,t)p'(x,t)dt&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

where q' is the heat release rate perturbation and p' is the pressure fluctuation.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Putnam and W. C. Dennis (1953) "Organ-pipe oscillations in a flame-filled tube," ''Fourth Symposium (International) on Combustion'', The Combustion Institute, pp. 566–574.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. C. Fernandes and M. V. Heitor, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Je_hG6UfnogC&amp;printsec=copyright&amp;dq=rayleigh+thermoacoustic+&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;source=gbs_toc_s&amp;cad=1#PPA4,M1 "Unsteady flames and the Rayleigh criterion"] in F. Culick,  M. V. Heitor, and J. H. Whitelaw, ed.s, ''Unsteady Combustion'' (Dordrecht, the Netherlands:  Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;
When the heat release oscillations are in phase with the pressure oscillations, the Rayleigh Index is positive and the magnitude of the thermo acoustic instability is maximised. On the other hand, if the Rayleigh Index is negative, then thermoacoustic damping occurs. The Rayleigh Criterion implies that a thermoacoustic instability can be optimally controlled by having heat release oscillations 180 degrees out of phase with pressure oscillations at the same frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Dowling, A. P. (2000a). "Vortices, sound and flame – a damaging combination". ''The Aeronautical Journal of the RaeS''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00102202.2012.714020 |title=Temperature Response of an Acoustically Forced Turbulent Lean Premixed Flame: A Quantitative Experimental Determination |year=2013 |last1=Chrystie |first1=Robin S. M. |last2=Burns |first2=Iain S. |last3=Kaminski |first3=Clemens F. |journal=Combustion Science and Technology |volume=185 |pages=180–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; This minimizes the Rayleigh Index.

'''Computer-aided inspection''' (CAI) is the use of computer-based software tools that assist quality engineers, machinists and inspectors in manufacturing product components. Its primary purpose is to create a faster production process and components with more precise dimensions and material consistency. CAI is a software tool that makes it possible to inspect physical models using [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) programs. CAM creates real life versions of components designed within a [[Application software|software package]]. CAM was first used in 1971 for car body design and tooling.

Founded in 1983, the '''Computer Press Association''' (CPA) was established to promote excellence in the field of computer journalism. The association was composed of working editors, writers, producers, and freelancers who covered issues related to computers and technology. The CPA conducted the annual Computer Press Awards, which was the preeminent editorial awards of the computer and technology media. The CPA Awards honored outstanding examples in print, broadcast and electronic media. Awards were given for print publications, such as [[PC Magazine]]; online news media, such as Newsbytes News Network (both were multiple winners); individual columns and features by well-known journalists such as [[Steven Levy]] (author of “[[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]]”); broadcast awards such as “Best Radio Program”; as well as book awards in categories such as Best Product Specific Book.  CPA President [http://answerguy.com/about-the-answerguy/yablon/ Jeff Yablon] (1994-1996) developed an updated code of ethics for technology journalists that was adopted by many major trade show groups, most notably [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Blenheim.aspx Bruno Blenheim]. The Computer Press Association disbanded in 2000.

'''Convia, Inc.''', based in [[Buffalo Grove, Illinois]], is an American [[manufacturer]] of [[Electronic component|components]] which provide an integrated [[energy management]] platform that allows for the control and [[Light meter|metering]] of [[lighting]], [[Plug load meter|plug-loads]] and [[HVAC]]. It is notable as one of the first companies to deliver and control power while at the same time monitoring energy and adapting its use in real-time.

==History==
In the late 1990s, Herman Miller, Inc., Convia’s [[parent company]], realized that they could not create truly flexible environments until the [[infrastructure]] of the building became more flexible. They decided that if a building infrastructure embraced technology then the applications, including [[systems furniture]], could also take advantage of that infrastructure and become more intelligent. The need for intelligent infrastructure led Herman Miller to partner with a leading technology [[think tank]] called [[Applied Minds]] in [[Glendale, California]] and their founder [[Danny Hillis]]. Danny Hillis is considered a pioneer of the [[parallel computing]] industry and is the lead designer of Convia. Convia was launched in 2004.

==Partners==
In 2009, Herman Miller, Inc., and [[Legrand (company)|Legrand North America]], an innovative{{cn|date=January 2018}} manufacturer of [[Electrical infrastructure|electrical]] and network infrastructure [[solution]]s, announced a strategic alliance designed to broaden the reach of energy management strategies to fuel the adoption of flexible, sustainable spaces, ultimately reducing [[real estate]] and building [[operating cost]]s while improving worker [[productivity]]. Under the terms of the agreement, technology from Herman Miller’s Convia, Inc. subsidiary is embedded into Wiremold wire and [[cable management]] systems from Legrand. These include [[Modular power supply|modular power]] and lighting distribution systems, floor boxes, poke-thru devices and architectural columns, which provide flexible, accessible [[power distribution]] to building owners and managers. Convia technology integrates a facility's [[power delivery]] and other infrastructure and technology applications, including lighting, HVAC, and occupancy and [[daylight harvesting]] sensors into an energy efficient, easy-to manage platform. Under the new alliance, “Convia-enabled” Wiremold systems enhanced this capability by adding control and monitoring of office plug loads (the amount of energy drawn by devices from an [[electrical outlet]]) and lighting loads.

Also in 2009, recognizing that workers spend approximately 50 percent of their time away from their desks, Convia developed the Energy Manager for Herman Miller to bring energy management strategies to the [[workstation]]. The system connects building power with the modular power in a cluster of Herman Miller workstations—including Vivo interiors, My Studio Environments, Ethospace system, Prospects, and [[Action Office]] system.

[[File:Roku XDS with Remote.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Roku]] XD/S digital media players works with popular streaming media sites like [[Amazon.com]] and [[Netflix]] as well as locally stored content]]
A '''digital media player''' ('''DMP''') is a home entertainment [[consumer electronics]] device that can connect to a [[home network]] to [[streaming media|stream]] [[digital media]] such as music, photos or digital video.  Digital media players can stream files from a [[personal computer]], [[network-attached storage]] or another networked [[media server]], to play the media on a [[television]] or [[video projector]] display for [[home cinema]]. Most digital media players utilize a [[10-foot user interface]], and many are navigated via a [[remote control]].&lt;ref&gt;https://gizmodo.com/5827779/roku-2-same-old-same-old Roku 2: Same Old (But Still Good), Same Old&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dlna.org/dlna-for-industry/digital-living/how-it-works/dlna-device-classes/digital-media-player Digital Media Player - DLNA Device Classes&lt;/ref&gt; Some digital media players also have [[smart TV]] features, such as allowing users to stream media such as digital versions of movies and TV shows from the Internet or streaming services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=J. Vaughan-Nichols|first=Steven|title=Half-a-billion internet-connected devices and counting|url=http://www.zdnet.com/half-a-billion-internet-connected-devices-and-counting-7000012958/|publisher=ZDnet|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital media players were first introduced in 2000. In the 2010s, the main difference between most digital media players and modern [[set-top box]]es was the obligation to have a [[Tuner (radio)#Television|TV tuner]]. Set-top boxes generally contain at least one TV tuner and are as such capable of receiving [[broadcasting]] [[signal (information theory)|signals]] from [[cable television]], [[satellite television]], [[over-the-air television]] or [[IPTV]].

==Overview==
In the 2010s, with the popularity of [[portable media player]]s and [[digital camera]]s, as well as fast Internet download speeds and relatively cheap mass storage, many people came into possession of large collections of digital media files that cannot be played on a conventional analog [[HiFi]] without connecting a computer to an amplifier or television. The means to play these files on a network-connected digital media player that is permanently connected to a television is seen as a convenience. The rapid growth in the availability of online content has made it easier for consumers to use these devices and obtain content.  [[YouTube]], for instance, is a common plug-in available on most networked devices.  [[Netflix]] has also struck deals with many consumer-electronics makers to make their interface available in the device's menus, for their streaming subscribers.  This symbiotic relationship between Netflix and consumer electronics makers has helped propel Netflix to become the largest subscription video service in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Narcisse | first = Evan | coauthors = | title = Netflix Becoming Largest Subscription Entertainment Company | work = | pages = | publisher = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 25 April 2011 | url = http://techland.time.com/2011/04/25/netflix-becoming-largest-subscription-entertainment-company/ | accessdate = 2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; using up to 20% of U.S. bandwidth at peak times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Liedtke |first=Michael |coauthors= |title=Netflix expects video streaming to drown out DVDs |work= |pages= |agency=Associated Press |date=22 November 2010 |url=http://www.valleynewslive.com/Global/story.asp?S=13551980&amp;clienttype=printable |accessdate=7 February 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media players are often designed for compactness and affordability, and tend to have small or non-existent hardware displays other than simple [[LED]] lights to indicate whether the device is powered on. Interface navigation on the television is usually done with an [[infrared]] [[remote control]], while more-advanced digital media players come with high-performance [[remote control]]s which allow control of the interface using integrated touch sensors. Some remotes also include [[accelerometer]]s for [[air mouse]] features which allow basic motion gaming.  Most digital media player devices are unable to play physical audio or video media directly, and instead require a user to convert these media into playable digital files using a separate computer and software. They are also usually incapable of recording audio or video. In the 2010s, it is also common to find digital media player functionality integrated into other consumer-electronics appliances, such as [[DVD player]]s, [[set-top box]]es, [[smart TV]]s, or even [[video game console]]s.

==Terminology==
Digital media players are also commonly referred to as a "digital media extender", "digital media streamer", "digital media hub", "digital media adapter", or "digital media receiver" (which should not be confused with ''[[AV Receiver]]'' that are also called ''Digital Media Renderer'').&lt;ref&gt;https://us.en.kb.sony.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/35234 What are the differences in DLNA device classes?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hometheater.about.com/od/interactivetelevision/a/Dlna-Certifications-The-Role-Of-Each-Network-Media-Component-In-Media-Sharing.htm DLNA Certifications - The Role of Each Network Media Component in Media Sharing&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
By November 2000, an audio-only digital media player was demonstrated by a company called SimpleDevices, which was awarded two patents covering this invention in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|US|7130616}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|US|6993289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed under the SimpleFi name by [[Motorola]] in late 2001, the design was based on a Cirrus Arm-7 processor and the wireless [[HomeRF]] networking standard which pre-dated 802.11b in the residential markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Motorola Simplefi review |work= CNet |date= 16 August 2002 |url= http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-audio-receivers-dars/motorola-simplefi/4505-6470_7-9050945.html |accessdate= 14 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early market entrants in 2001 included the [[AudioTron|Turtle Beach AudioTron]], [[Rio Receiver]] and [[Squeezebox (network music player)#SliMP3 .282001.29|SliMP3]] digital media players. An early version of a video-capable digital media player was presented by F.C. Jeng et al. in the International Conf. on Consumer Electronics in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;F.C. Jeng, M. Jeanson, S-Y Zhu, and K. Konstantinides, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F7922%2F21838%2F01013945.pdf%3Farnumber%3D1013945&amp;authDecision=-203 "Design of a home media center with network and streaming capabilities"], IEEE Intern. Conf. on Consumer Electronics, 2002, pp. 102-103.&lt;/ref&gt; It included a network interface card, a media processor for audio and video decoding, an analog video encoder (for video playback to a TV), an audio digital to analog converter for audio playback, and an IR (infrared receiver) for remote-control-interface.

A concept of a digital media player was also introduced by Intel in 2002 at the [[Intel Developer Forum]] as part of their “Extended Wireless PC Initiative."  Intel’s digital media player was based on an Xscale PXA210 processor and supported 802.11b wireless networking. Intel was among the first to use the Linux embedded operating system and [[UPnP]] technology for its digital media player. Networked audio and DVD players were among the first consumer devices to integrate digital media player functionality. Examples include the Philips [[Streamium]]-range of products that allowed for remote streaming of audio, the GoVideo D2730 Networked DVD player which integrated DVD playback with the capability to stream Rhapsody audio from a PC, and the Buffalo LinkTheater which combined a DVD player with a digital media player.  More recently, the Xbox 360 gaming console from Microsoft was among the first gaming devices that integrated a digital media player. With the Xbox 360, Microsoft also introduced the concept of a [[Windows Media Center Extender]], which allows users to access the Media center capabilities of a PC remotely, through a home network.  More recently, Linksys, D-Link, and HP introduced the latest generation of digital media players that support 720p and 1080p high resolution video playback and may integrate both Windows Extender and traditional digital media player functionality.

==Typical features==
A digital media player can connect to the home network using either a wireless (IEEE 802.11a, b, g, and n) or wired [[Ethernet]] connection. Digital media players includes a user interface that allows users to navigate through their digital media library, search for, and play back media files. Some digital media players only handle music; some handle music and pictures; some handle music, pictures, and video; while others go further to allow internet browsing or controlling Live TV from a PC with a TV tuner.

Some other capabilities which are accomplished by digital media players include:
* Play, catalog, and store local [[hard disk]], [[USB flash drive|flash drive]], or [[memory card]] music [[CD]]s and view CD album art, view digital photos, and watch [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] or other videos.
* Stream movies, music, photos (media) over the wired or wireless network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airplay|url=https://www.apple.com/airplay/|publisher=apple.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* View digital pictures (one by one or as picture [[slideshow]]s)
* Stream online video to a TV from services such as [[Netflix]] and [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google TV|url=http://www.google.com/tv/apps.html|publisher=google.com|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Play video games such as [[Angry Birds]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Charlie|title=Now You Can Play Angry Birds On a Roku 2 [PICS]|url=http://mashable.com/2011/08/06/roku-2-xs-review/|publisher=mashable.com|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Browse the Internet, check email and access [[social networking]] sites like [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[LinkedIn]] on TV through downloadable applications.
*Video conference by connecting a [[webcam]] and microphone.&lt;ref name="amkette1"/&gt;

In the 2010s, there are stand-alone digital media players on the market from AC Ryan, Asus, Apple (e.g., [[Apple TV]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barlow|first=Graham|title=Apple TV review|url=http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/av-accessories/apple-tv-900409/review|publisher=techradar.com|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), NetGear (e.g., NTV and NeoTV models), Dune, iOmega, Logitech, Pivos Group, Micca, Sybas (Popcorn Hour), [[Amkette EvoTV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Almeida|first=Aaron|title=Amkette EvoTV Review|url=http://tech2.in.com/reviews/hd-media-players/amkette-evotv-review/323422|publisher=tech2.in.com|accessdate=17 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712161933/http://tech2.in.com/reviews/hd-media-players/amkette-evotv-review/323422|archivedate=12 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; D-Link,  EZfetch, [[Android TV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwald|first=Will|title=Sony Internet Player With Google TV (NSZ-GS7)|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2413422,00.asp|publisher=pcmag.com|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinnacle, [[Xtreamer]], and [[Roku]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Biddle|first=Sam|title=Roku 3 Review: The New Best Streaming Box|url=https://gizmodo.com/5991159/roku-3-review-the-new-best-streaming-box|publisher=gizmodo.com|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; just to name a few. The models change frequently, so it is advisable to visit their web sites for current model names.

===Processors===
These devices come with low power consumption processors or [[System on a chip|SoC (System on Chip)]] and are most commonly either based on [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] or [[ARM architecture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cortex-A9 Processor|url=http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-a/cortex-a9.php|publisher=arm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; processors combined with integrated [[Digital signal processing|DSP]] [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] in a [[System on a chip|SoC]] (or [[MPSoC]]) package. They also include [[RAM]]-memory and some type of built-in [[Flash memory|type of non-volatile computer memory (Flash memory)]].&lt;ref name="amkette1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Amkette|url=http://amkette.com/product.jsp?id=185|publisher=Amkette|accessdate=17 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524194023/http://amkette.com/product.jsp?id=185|archive-date=24 May 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal hard-drive capabilities===
''HD media player'' or ''HDD media player'' (''HDMP'') is a generic term used for a category of consumer product that combines digital media player with a [[hard drive]] (HD) [[disk enclosure|enclosure]] with all the hardware and software for playing [[Content (media and publishing)|audio]], [[video]] and photos to a television. All these can play computer-based media files to a television without the need for a separate computer or network connection, and some can even be used as a conventional external hard-drive. These types of digital media players are sometimes sold as empty shells to allow the user to fit their own choice of hard drive (some can manage unlimited hard disk capacity and other only a certain capacity, i.e. 1TB, 2TB, 3TB, or 4TB), and the same model is sometimes sold with or without an internal hard drive already fitted.

=== Formats, resolutions and file systems ===
Digital media players can usually play [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] (SD and [[high resolution|HD]]), [[MPEG-4 Part 2]] (SD and HD), [[MPEG-1]], [[MPEG-2]] [[.mpg]], [[MPEG-2]] .[[MPEG transport stream|TS]], [[VOB]] and [[ISO image]]s video, with [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]], [[MP3]] and [[Dolby AC-3|AC3]] audio tracks. They can also display images (such as [[JPEG]] and [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]]) and play music files (such as [[FLAC]], [[MP3]] and [[Ogg]]).

===Operating system===
{{main article|List of smart TV platforms and middleware software}}
While most media players have traditionally been running [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] or [[Open-source model|open source]] [[software framework]]s versions based [[Linux]] as their operating systems, many newer network connected media players are based on the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform which gives them an advantage in terms of applications and games from the [[Google Play]] store. Even without Android some digital media players still have the ability to run applications (sometimes available via an 'app store' [[digital distribution]] [[platform (computing)|platform]]), interactive on-demand media, personalized communications, and social networking features&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Devindra Hardawar |url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/12/08/why-your-tv-is-the-new-app-battleground/ |title=Why your TV is the new app battleground |publisher=Venturebeat.com |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10132877 BBC News&amp;nbsp;– Google launches smart TV service]. bbc.co.uk (20 May 2010).

== Connections ==
[[File:Dighub3.jpg|thumb|300px|An example of a Digital media player in a network]]
There are two ways to connect an extender to its central [[Home theater PC|media center]] or [[HTPC]] server - wired, or wireless. A wireless connection can be established between the media extender and its central media center. On the downside, interference may cause a "less than optimal" connection and cause network congestion, resulting in stuttering sound, missing frames from video, and other anomalies. It is recommended{{By whom|date=September 2013}} that an [[802.11a]] or better be used, and over as short of a distance as possible.
[[File:Digital media receiver - network music player.jpg|thumb|A wireless media extender from [[Arctic (company)|Arctic]] for music streaming and multi-room entertainment&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arctic.ac/en/p/living/multi-room-system/463/audio-relay.html?c=2327 "Audio Relay"] Retrieved 11 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Streaming and communication protocols===
While early digital media players used proprietary communication protocols to interface with media servers, today most digital media players either use standard-based protocols such [[Server Message Block|SMB/CIFS/SAMBA]] or [[Network File System|NFS]], or rely on some version of [[UPnP]] (Universal Plug and Play) and [[DLNA]] (Digital Living Network Alliance) standards. DLNA-compliant digital media players and Media Servers is meant to guarantee a minimum set of functionality and proper interoperability among digital media players and servers regardless of the manufacturer, but unfortunately not every manufacturer follows the standards perfectly which can lead to incompatibility.

===Media server===
Some digital media players will only connect to specific media server software installed on a PC to stream music, pictures and recorded or live TV originating from the computer. Apple iTunes can, for example, be used this way with the Apple TV hardware that connects to a TV. Apple has developed a tightly integrated device and content management ecosystem with their [[iTunes Store]], personal computers, [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] [[List of iOS devices|devices]], and the [[AppleTV]] [[digital media receiver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/10/01/how-apple-took-the-high-ground-in-the-battle-for-the-global-digital-living-room/ | title=How Apple took the high ground in the battle for the global digital living room | first=Philip | last=Elmer-DeWitt | date=1 October 2010 | publisher=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] | accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most recent version of the AppleTV, at $99, has lost the hard-drive that was included in its predecessor and fully depends on either streaming internet content, or another computer on the home network for media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bostonherald.com/business/technology/reviews/view/20110124apples_web_tv_packs_big_bang_for_the_buck/srvc=home&amp;position=also | title=Apple’s Web TV packs big bang for the buck | first=Brendan| last=Lynch | date=24 January 2011 | publisher=[[Boston Herald]] | accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connection ports===
[[File:Apple TV back.jpg|thumb|Back of 1st generation Apple TV]]
[[File:Apple TV 2nd Generation back.jpg|thumb|Back of 2nd &amp;amp; 3rd generation Apple TV]]
Television connection is usually done via; composite, [[SCART]], Component, [[HDMI]] video, with Optical Audio (TOSLINK/SPDIF), and connect to the local network and [[broadband]] internet using either a wired [[Ethernet]] or a wireless [[wifi]] connection, and some also have built-in [[Bluetooth]] support for remotes and game-pads or joysticks. Some players come with [[USB]] ([[USB 2.0]] or [[USB 3.0]]) ports which allow local media content playback.

=== Market impact on traditional television services ===
The convergence of content, technology, and broadband access allows consumers to stream television shows and movies to their high-definition television in competition with [[pay television]] providers. The research company SNL Kagan expects 12 million households, roughly 10%, to go without cable, satellite or telco video service by 2015 using [[Over-the-top content|Over The Top]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://blogs.forbes.com/dorothypomerantz/2011/07/20/12-million-households-expected-to-cut-the-cord-by-2015 | title=12 Million Households Expected to Cut the Cord By 2015 | date=20 July 2011 | publisher=[[Forbes]] | accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents a new trend in the broadcast television industry, as the list of options for watching movies and TV over the Internet grows at a rapid pace. Research also shows that even as traditional television service providers are trimming their customer base, they are adding [[Broadband]] Internet customers. Nearly 76.6 million U.S. households get broadband from leading cable and telephone companies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leichtmanresearch.com/press/051711release.html |title=Nearly 1.3 Million Add Broadband in the First Quarter of 2011 |date=17 May 2011 |publisher=Leichtman Research Group |accessdate=17 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713200733/http://www.leichtmanresearch.com/press/051711release.html |archivedate=13 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although only a portion have sufficient speeds to support quality video steaming.&lt;ref name=Forrester&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.forrester.com/rb/Research/online_video_on_tv_leads_to_cord-cutting/q/id/57160/t/2/ | title=Online Video On TV Leads To Cord-Cutting By 2012 | first=James L. | last=McQuivey, Ph.D. | date=14 March 2011 | publisher=[[Forrester Research]] | accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convergence devices for home entertainment will likely play a much larger role in the future of broadcast television, effectively shifting traditional revenue streams while providing consumers with more options.&lt;ref name=Forrester/&gt;

According to a report from the researcher NPD In-Stat, only about 12 million U.S. households have their either Web-capable TVs or digital media players connected to the Internet, although In-Stat estimates about 25 million U.S. TV households own a set with the built-in network capability. Also, In-Stat predicts that 100 million homes in North America and western Europe will own digital media players and television sets that blend traditional programs with Internet content by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2012/03/100-million-tvs-will-be-internet-connected-by-2016.html|title=100 million TVs will be Internet-connected by 2016|work=latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Fully-loaded" set-top boxes have been subject to legal controversies, especially noting that their user experiences made them accessible to end-users who may not always realize that they are actually streaming pirated content.&lt;ref name="ars-fullyloadedkodi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc-pirateboxes" /&gt; In the United Kingdom, the [[Federation Against Copyright Theft]] (FACT) has taken court actions on behalf of rightsholders against those who market digital media players pre-loaded with access to copyrighted content. In January 2017, an individual seller plead not guilty to charges of marketing and distributing devices that [[Anti-circumvention|circumvent]] [[technological protection measures]].&lt;ref name="bbc-notguilty"&gt;{{cite web|title=Not guilty plea in landmark Kodi box trial|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38769045|website=BBC News|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-fullyloadedtest"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sale of Kodi 'fully-loaded' streaming boxes faces legal test|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37474595|website=BBC News|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arsuk-fivearrests"&gt;{{cite web|title=Five suspects arrested for sale of "fully loaded" Kodi streaming boxes|url=https://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2017/02/five-suspects-arrested-for-sale-of-fully-loaded-kodi-streaming-boxes/|website=Ars Technica UK|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, the [[High Court of Justice]] ruled that [[BT Group]], [[Sky plc]], [[TalkTalk TV|TalkTalk]], and [[Virgin Media]] must block servers that had been used on such set-top boxes to illegally stream [[Premier League]] football games.&lt;ref name="ars-kodicrackdown"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kodi crackdown: Premier League wins High Court order to block illegal streams|url=https://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2017/03/kodi-crackdown-premier-league-high-court-order-block-illegal-streams/|website=Ars Technica UK|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the month, [[Amazon UK]] banned the sale of "certain media players" that had been pre-loaded with software to illegally stream copyrighted content.&lt;ref name="arsuk-amazonban"&gt;{{cite web|title=Amazon bans "certain" media streamers, but are Kodi-loaded boxes barred?|url=https://arstechnica.co.uk/gadgets/2017/04/amazon-uk-kodi-media-streamer-ban/|website=Ars Technica UK|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 April 2017, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled that the distribution of set-top boxes with access to unauthorized streams of copyrighted works violated the exclusive rights to communicate them to the public.&lt;ref name="ars-fullyloadedkodi"/&gt; In September 2017, a British seller of such boxes pled guilty to violations of the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988|Copyright, Designs and Patents Act]] for selling devices that can circumvent effective [[technical protection measures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/landmark-kodi-trial-dissolved-due-to-guilty-plea/|title=Landmark loaded Kodi box trial dissolves with guilty plea|last=Osborne|first=Charlie|work=ZDNet|access-date=26 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, it was initially believed that these set-top boxes fell within a legal grey area, as the transient nature of streaming content did not necessarily mean that the content was being downloaded in violation of [[Canadian copyright law]].&lt;ref name="cbc-freetv"/&gt; However, on 1 June 2016, a consortium of Canadian media companies ([[BCE Inc.]], [[Rogers Communications]], and [[Videotron]]) obtained a temporary federal injunction against five retailers of Android-based set-top boxes, alleging that their continued sale were causing "irreparable harm" to their television businesses, and that the devices' primary purpose were to facilitate copyright infringement. The court rejected an argument by one of the defendants, who stated that they were only marketing a hardware device with publicly available software, ruling that the defendants were "deliberately encourag[ing] consumers and potential clients to circumvent authorized ways of accessing content."&lt;ref name="cbc-freetvcourt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc-freetvcourt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cable companies launch court battle against 'free TV' Android box vendors|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/free-tv-loaded-android-box-cable-1.3633331|website=CBC News|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 11 additional defendants were subsequently added to the suit. The lawyer of one of the defendants argued that retailers should not be responsible for the actions of their users, as any type of computing device could theoretically be used for legal or illegal purposes.&lt;ref name="cbc-moredefendants"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cable companies take more Android box dealers to court to stamp out 'free TV'|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/free-tv-android-box-cable-companies-challenge-1.3660656|website=CBC News|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, the [[Federal Court of Appeal]] blocked an appeal requesting that the injunction be lifted pending the outcome of the case.&lt;ref name="cbc-boxappeal"&gt;{{cite web|title='Free TV' Android box dealers lose court appeal to lift sales ban|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/android-box-free-tv-bell-rogers-1.4033741|website=CBC News|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the software is free to use, the developers of Kodi have not endorsed any add-on or Kodi-powered device intended for facilitating copyright infringement.  Nathan Betzen, president of the XBMC Foundation (the non-profit organization which oversees the development of the Kodi software), argued that the reputation of Kodi had been harmed by third-party retailers who "make a quick buck modifying Kodi, installing broken piracy add-ons, advertising that Kodi lets you watch free movies and TV, and then vanishing when the user buys the box and finds out that the add-on they were sold on was a crummy, constantly breaking mess." Betzen stated that the XBMC Foundation was willing to enforce its [[trademark]]s against those who use them to promote Kodi-based products which facilitate copyright infringement.&lt;ref name="tf-legalaction"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kodi Announces Legal Action to Smash Piracy Links|url=https://torrentfreak.com/kodi-announces-legal-action-to-smash-piracy-links-160215/|website=TorrentFreak|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="engadget-sellerskodi"/&gt;

Following a lawsuit by [[Dish Network]] against TVAddons, a website that offered streaming add-ons that were often used with Kodi and on such devices, in June 2017, the group shut down its add-ons and website. A technology analyst speculated that the service could eventually re-appear under a different name in the future, as have [[torrent tracker]]s.&lt;ref name="cbc-dishlawsuit"&gt;{{cite web|title=Streaming apps for 'free TV' Android box disappear following U.S. lawsuit threat|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/streaming-box-lawsuit-tvaddons-1.4165325?|website=CBC News|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, the service's operator was also sued by the Bell/Rogers/Videotron consortium for inducing copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://torrentfreak.com/tvaddons-returns-ugly-war-canadian-telcos-kodi-addons-170801/|title=TVAddons Returns, But in Ugly War With Canadian Telcos Over Kodi Addons - TorrentFreak|date=1 August 2017|work=TorrentFreak|access-date=2 August 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, [[Televisa]] was granted a court order banning the sale of all [[Roku]] products in Mexico, as it was alleged that third-parties had been operating subscription television services for the devices that contain unlicensed content. The content is streamed through unofficial apps that are added to the devices through hacking. Roku objected to the allegations, stating that these services were not certified by the company or part of its official Channels platform, whose terms of service require that they have rights to stream the content that they offer. Roku also stated that it actively cooperates with reports of channels that infringe copyrights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/roku-sales-banned-mexico-piracy-1202484188/|title=Roku Device Sales Banned in Mexico Over Piracy|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=30 June 2017|work=Variety|access-date=3 July 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] sent letters to the CEOs of [[Amazon.com]] and [[eBay]], asking for their help in removing such devices from their marketplaces. The letter cited malware risks, fraudulent use of FCC certification marks, and how their distribution through major online marketplaces may incorrectly suggest that they are legal and legitimate products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/29/fcc-asks-amazon-and-ebay-to-stop-selling-fake-pay-tv-boxes/|title=FCC asks Amazon and eBay to stop selling fake pay TV boxes |website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tobii Dynavox''' (formerly DynaVox Mayer-Johnson) is a [[United States|U.S.]]-based developer, manufacturer and distributor of [[speech generating device]]s headquartered in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania. The company was formed in 1983 and has since become the leading provider of speech communication devices and symbol-adapted special education software{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} used to assist individuals in overcoming speech, language and learning challenges. DynaVox Mayer-Johnson's stated mission is to enable children and adults to reach their educational potential and experience a greater quality of life by maximizing each person’s ability to communicate and learn.  The company's best-known products include the Maestro and EyeMax System communication solutions, and the Boardmaker Software Family, a suite of tools that allow educational curriculum and activities to be adapted to meet a range of student learning, cognitive and physical needs.

== History ==

Founded as Sentient Systems Technology, Inc. in 1983, the company’s first product was the EyeTyper.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, M. B., G. Kiliany, M. Dzmura, D. Anderson. "The Eyetracker Communication System," [[Johns Hopkins]] APL Technical Digest, vol. 3, no. 3, 1982. 250–252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, M.B., Kiliany, G. and Dzmura, M. (1985) An Eye Gaze Controlled Keyboard. Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on [[Rehabilitation engineering|Rehabilitation Engineering]], 446–447.&lt;/ref&gt;  Created as a student project at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] to help a young woman with [[cerebral palsy]] to communicate, the EyeTyper allowed individuals spell messages with their eyes.  These messages were then “spoken” by a computerized voice.

The [[EyeTyper]] made it possible for some people with [[cerebral palsy]] to communicate effectively. Killiany formed the company with CMU professor Mark Friedman and business partner Tilden Bennett. The patent for this technology was sold to the US Navy and all revenue went back into further development of communication applications that could be used by more people with significant speech disabilities.  In 1991 the first DynaVox branded product was released.  The DynaVox was the first speech-generating device to feature [[touchscreen]] technology.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The company changed its name to DynaVox Systems Inc. when was acquired by Sunrise Medical Inc. in 1998.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sunrise+Medical+Announces+Acquisition+of+Sentient+Systems+Technology,...-a020234659 Sunrise Medical Announces Acquisition of Sentient Systems Technology, Inc. – Free Online Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; before being spun out again several years later.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vestarcapital.com/en/news/145/&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004 DynaVox acquired Enkidu Research Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://speech-language-pathology-audiology.advanceweb.com/article/dynavox-acquires-enkidu.aspx DynaVox Acquires Enkidu on ADVANCE for Speech-Language Pathologists and Audiologists&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and Mayer-Johnson.  In 2009 DynaVox Mayer-Johnson acquired BlinkTwice, and incorporated that company's product, the Tango AAC device, into the DynaVox product line.  DynaVox acquired Eye Response Technologies in January 2010.

The company floated on the stock market in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2010/01/04/daily23.html?page=all | title=DynaVox files IPO}}&lt;/ref&gt; although as of September 2011, its stock had fallen by 29.8% year in the last year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestreet.com/story/11266707/1/dynavox-inc-stock-downgraded-dvox.html DVOX Stock | DynaVox Inc. Stock Downgraded (DVOX) – TheStreet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, after continued falling stock prices, Dynavox was warned by Nasdaq that if shares continued to be valued below $1 the company would be dropped from the exchange. "The company intends to consider available options to resolve the noncompliance with the minimum bid price requirement," DynaVox said in a recent SEC filing. "No determination regarding the Company's response has been made at this time." In a separate and unrelated matter, DynaVox said in a separate SEC filing that JoAnn A. Reed would not seek re-election to the company's Board of Directors when her term expires on Dec. 5, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bizpedia.net/d/dynavox-inc/filings/12410015 SEC Filing FORM 8-K from December 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 10, 2013, Dynavox announced that it received notification on April 5, 2013 that The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ("NASDAQ") had determined to delist the Company's Class A common stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market, effective with the open of business on April 16, 2013. As previously disclosed, on October 2, 2012, the Company received a notice from NASDAQ indicating it was not in compliance with NASDAQ's $1.00 minimum bid price requirement. The delisting is the result of the Company's failure to regain compliance with this requirement. The Company did not appeal the NASDAQ staff's determination.
The Company has been advised by OTC Markets Group Inc. that its Class A common stock will be immediately eligible for trading on the OTCQB marketplace effective with the open of business on April 16, 2013. The Company's Class A common stock will continue to trade under the symbol DVOX.

As of April 2014, the company found itself grappling with restructuring its assets and debts estimated at between $10 million and $50 million. DynaVox Intermediate LLC, became the focus of a threatened collateral sale by JEC Capital Partners LLC and Fondren Management LP.

JEC and Fondren bought DynaVox's secured debt March 2014, the culmination of a process that saw the troubled Pittsburgh company searching for a deal or refinancing to bail it out of financial trouble.

April 8, 2014 DynaVox Systems, LLC ("DynaVox"), announced on their website clarifications regarding the Chapter 11 filings made by certain related entities and then on April 09th began giving away a free app to SLP's - “DynaVox Compass for Professionals gives SLPs free access to the DynaVox Compass app to use on their own iPad or Windows tablet, along with a comprehensive set of training and support tools, to help them better evaluate and serve their clients,”

On May 22, 2014, it was announced that competitor Tobii acquired DynaVox, and integrated them into Tobii's integrated Assisted Technology division.  The company was renamed Tobii Dynavox LLC.  The US division remains in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tobiidynavox.com/en-us/about/press-releases/2014/5/tobii-acquires-aac-leader-dynavox-systems-llc/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product scope ==
DynaVox devices assist individuals who are unable to communicate reliably with their own voices due to [[cognitive]], language and physical impairments. According to the 2005 US disability census, cognitive illnesses alone affect over 16 million people over the age of 15, while 35 million American’s were described as having a severe disability.&lt;ref&gt;Americans with Disabilities: 2005, Household Economic Studies, US Census Bureau  (https://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/p70-117.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

The devices produced by DynaVox closely resemble touch screen tablet computers. DynaVox uses a [[Microsoft Windows]]-based configuration as a platform to run proprietary InterAACt communiciation software.

DynaVox devices, like almost all [[Speech generating device]], use a hierarchical set of pages that contain different vocabulary for different contexts or situations. DynaVox's particular system of organising these pages is called 'InterAACT'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.speechbubble.org.uk/vocabulary/interaact/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speech generating devices==
Dynavox produce a range of speech generating devices, including the very small 'Xpress', and the 'Tango', which was designed particularly for children.  Its newest device is called the Maestro, which, like the older V+ and VMax+ and M&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, provides options for multiple communication channels including [[Mobile phone|cell phone]], [[Short message service|text messaging]] and [[e-mail]].  The larger Vmax is typically selected for those using wheelchairs (the device can be mounted) or for individuals with [[visual impairment]]s.  All Dynavox devices can be accessed in a variety of ways to compensate for limited physical abilities.  The M&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is physically similar to the V+  and provides a limited number of prerecorded messages, and is often used by individuals with limited or no literacy skills.

===Access systems===
DynaVox also produced the [[EyeMax]], which is an accessory which allows someone with limited or no fine motor skills to use their eyes to control their device.&lt;ref&gt;http://mashable.com/2011/10/05/tech-disabled/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augie Nieto]], founder of Life Fitness, member of DynaVox's board of directors,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressreleasepoint.com/dynavox-mayerjohnson-names-augie-nieto-its-board-directors DynaVox Mayer-Johnson Names Augie Nieto to its Board of Directors | PressReleasePoint&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the former "King of Fitness", was diagnosed with [[ALS]], and has slowly lost movement in most of his body and his ability to speak. Nieto has been able to continue communicating with his family, friends, and the world using the EyeMax technology. The EyeMax Systems' camera tracks the person’s eye movements on the screen.  The user makes a selection by blinking or pausing on the desired vocabulary.  Nieto says, “I can type up to 20 words per minute with the DynaVox” using only his eyes.

A '''Dynamic trimming''' system operates seagoing vessels to achieve minimum water [[Drag (physics)|resistance]] under all circumstances. It is based on [[multidimensional analysis]] of [[real-time data]] collected on vessel attitude ([[Sailing ballast|trim]]).

Dynamic trimming automates data retrieval from [[sensor network]]s, for vessel management [[software application]]s. The core of the method is a multidimensional analysis model, which continuously calculates the key forces affecting the vessel attitude.

The system helps officers ensure that their vessels are operated efficiently. The key metrics are graphically displayed to facilitate decision-making.
The system aims to continuously optimize vessel trim, thus minimizing water resistance and reducing fuel consumption.

[[Image:Samfax.jpg|thumb|300px|A fax machine from the late 1990s]]
'''Fax''' (short for '''[[facsimile]]'''),  sometimes called '''telecopying''' or '''telefax''' (the latter short for '''telefacsimile'''), is the telephonic transmission of scanned printed material (both text and images), normally to a telephone number connected to a printer or other output device. The original document is scanned with a '''fax machine''' (or a '''telecopier'''), which processes the contents (text or images) as a single fixed graphic image, converting it into a [[bitmap]], and then transmitting it through the telephone system in the form of audio-frequency tones. The receiving fax machine interprets the tones and reconstructs the image, printing a paper copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/fax|title=What is fax?|last=Rouse|first=Margaret|date=June 2006 |publisher=SearchNetworking |accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early systems used direct conversions of image darkness to audio tone in a continuous or analog manner. Since the 1980s, most machines modulate the transmitted audio frequencies using a digital representation of the page which is compressed to quickly transmit areas which are all-white or all-black.

== History ==

=== Wire transmission ===
Scottish inventor [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] worked on chemical mechanical fax type devices and in 1846 was able to reproduce graphic signs in laboratory experiments.  He received British patent 9745 on May 27, 1843 for his "Electric Printing Telegraph".&lt;ref&gt;“Mr. Bain’s Electric Printing Telegraph,” Mechanics' Magazine April 13, 1844, 268–70&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frederick Bakewell]] made several improvements on Bain's design and demonstrated a telefax machine. The [[Pantelegraph]] was invented by the Italian physicist [[Giovanni Caselli]].  He introduced the first commercial telefax service between Paris and Lyon in 1865, some 11 years before the invention of the [[telephone]].&lt;ref name="italianunivbio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itisgalileiroma.it/shed/shed0/shed0/caselli.htm |title=Istituto Tecnico Industriale,  Italy. Italian biography of Giovanni Caselli |publisher=Itisgalileiroma.it |date= |accessdate=2014-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hebrewuniversity"&gt;[http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/caselli.html The Hebrew University of Jerusalem – Giovanni Caselli biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506000000/http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/caselli.html |date=May 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, English inventor [[Shelford Bidwell]] constructed the ''scanning phototelegraph'' that was the first telefax machine to scan any two-dimensional original, not requiring manual plotting or drawing. Around 1900, German physicist [[Arthur Korn]] invented the ''[[:de:Bildtelegrafie|Bildtelegraph]]'', widespread in continental Europe especially, since a widely noticed transmission of a wanted-person photograph from Paris to London in 1908, used until the wider distribution of the radiofax. Its main competitors were the ''Bélinographe'' by [[Édouard Belin]] first, then since the 1930s the ''[[Hellschreiber]]'', invented in 1929 by German inventor [[Rudolf Hell]], a pioneer in mechanical image scanning and transmission.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

The 1888 invention of the [[telautograph]] by [[Elisha Gray]] marked a further development in fax technology, allowing users to send signatures over long distances, thus allowing the verification of identification or ownership over long distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faxauthority.com/fax-history/|title=The History of Fax – from 1843 to Present Day|publisher=Fax Authority|accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 1924, scientists of the AT&amp;T Corporation "by a new process of transmitting pictures by electricity" sent 15 photographs by telephone from Cleveland to New York City, such photos being suitable for newspaper reproduction. Previously, photographs had been sent over the radio using this process.&lt;ref&gt;The Montreal Gazette, May 20, 1924, page 10, column 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western Union "Deskfax" fax machine, announced in 1948, was a compact machine that fit comfortably on a desktop, using special [[spark printer]] paper.&lt;ref name=Ridings1949&gt;G. H. Ridings, [http://massis.lcs.mit.edu/archives/technical/western-union-tech-review/03-1/p017.htm A Facsimile transceiver for Pickup and Delivery of Telegrams], [http://massis.lcs.mit.edu/archives/technical/western-union-tech-review/03-1/readpg.htm Western Union Technical Review, Vol. 3, No, 1] (January 1949); page 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wireless transmission ===
{{Main|Radiofax}}
[[File:Krant per fax - Faxed newspaper (4193509648).jpg | 300px | thumb | right | Children read a wirelessly-transmitted newspaper in 1938.]] 
As a designer for the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA), in 1924, [[Richard H. Ranger]] invented the wireless photoradiogram, or transoceanic [[radiofax|radio facsimile]], the forerunner of today’s "fax" machines. A photograph of President [[Calvin Coolidge]] sent from New York to London on November 29, 1924, became the first photo picture reproduced by transoceanic radio facsimile. Commercial use of Ranger’s product began two years later. Also in 1924, [[Herbert E. Ives]] of [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] transmitted and reconstructed the first color facsimile, a natural-color photograph of silent film star [[Rudolph Valentino]] in period costume, using red, green and blue color separations.&lt;ref name="Sipley"&gt;Sipley, Louis Walton (1951). ''A Half Century of Color''. Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1930s, the Finch Facsimile system was used to transmit a "radio newspaper" to private homes via commercial AM radio stations and ordinary radio receivers equipped with Finch's printer, which used thermal paper. Sensing a new and potentially golden opportunity, competitors soon entered the field, but the printer and special paper were expensive luxuries, AM radio transmission was very slow and vulnerable to static, and the newspaper was too small. After more than ten years of repeated attempts by Finch and others to establish such a service as a viable business, the public, apparently quite content with its cheaper and much more substantial home-delivered daily newspapers, and with conventional spoken radio bulletins to provide any "hot" news, still showed only a passing curiosity about the new medium.&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;Schneider, John (2011). [http://www.theradiohistorian.org/Radiofax/newspaper_of_the_air1.htm "The Newspaper of the Air: Early Experiments with Radio Facsimile"]. theradiohistorian.org. Retrieved 2017-05-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1940s, radiofax receivers were sufficiently miniaturized to be fitted beneath the dashboard of [[Western Union]]'s "Telecar" [[telegram]] delivery vehicles.&lt;ref name=Ridings1949 /&gt;

In the 1960s, the [[United States Army]] transmitted the first photograph via satellite [[facsimile]] to [[Puerto Rico]] from the [[Deal Test Site]] using the [[Courier 1B|Courier satellite]].

Radio fax is still in limited use today for transmitting weather charts and information to ships at sea. Also, it is also widely used within the medical field to transmit confidential patient information. {{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=== Telephone transmission ===
In 1964, Xerox Corporation introduced (and patented) what many consider to be the first commercialized version of the modern fax machine, under the name (LDX) or Long Distance Xerography.  This model was superseded two years later with a unit that would truly set the standard for fax machines for years to come.  Up until this point facsimile machines were very expensive and hard to operate. In 1966, Xerox released the Magnafax Telecopiers, a smaller, 46-pound facsimile machine.  This unit was far easier to operate and could be connected to any standard telephone line.  This machine was capable of transmitting a letter-sized document in about six minutes. The first sub-minute, digital fax machine was developed by [[Dacom]], which built on digital data compression technology originally developed at [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] for satellite communication.&lt;ref name="etd.ohiolink.edu"&gt;[https://etd.ohiolink.edu/rws_etd/document/get/ohiou1183661772/inline ''The implementation of a personal computer-based digital facsimile information distribution system''] – Edward C. Chung, [[Ohio University]], November 1991, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fax 1971, Pages 112-114"&gt;''Fax: The Principles and Practice of Facsimile Communication'', Daniel M. Costigan, Chilton Book Company, 1971, pages 112–114, 213, 239&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1970s, many companies around the world (especially Japanese firms) had entered the fax market.  Very shortly after this, a new wave of more compact, faster and efficient fax machines would hit the market.   Xerox continued to refine the fax machine for years after their ground-breaking first machine. In later years it would be combined with copier equipment to create the hybrid machines we have today that copy, scan and fax.  Some of the lesser known capabilities of the Xerox fax technologies included their Ethernet enabled Fax Services on their 8000 workstations in the early 1980s.

Prior to the introduction of the ubiquitous fax machine, one of the first being the [[ExxonMobil|Exxon]] Qwip&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/22/business/an-exxon-sale-to-harris-unit-the-exxon-corporation-said.html An Exxon Sale To Harris Unit] – [[The New York Times]], February 22, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-1970s, facsimile machines worked by optical scanning of a document or drawing spinning on a drum. The reflected light, varying in intensity according to the light and dark areas of the document, was focused on a [[photocell]] so that the current in a circuit varied with the amount of light. This current was used to control a tone generator (a [[modulator]]), the current determining the frequency of the tone produced. This audio tone was then transmitted using an [[acoustic coupler]] (a speaker, in this case) attached to the microphone of a common [[Handset|telephone handset]]. At the receiving end, a handset’s speaker was attached to an acoustic coupler (a microphone), and a [[fax demodulator|demodulator]] converted the varying tone into a variable current that controlled the mechanical movement of a pen or pencil to reproduce the image on a blank sheet of paper on an identical drum rotating at the same rate.

=== Computer facsimile interface ===
In 1985, [[Hank Magnuski]], founder of [[GammaLink]], produced the first computer fax board, called [[GammaFax]]. Such boards could provide voice telephony via [[Analog Expansion Bus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Perratore |first=Ed |date=September 1992|title= GammaFax MLCP-4/AEB: High-End Fax, Long-Range Potential|magazine=Byte|publisher=McGraw-Hill|issn=0360-5280|volume=17|number=9|pages=82, 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fax in the 21st century==
Although businesses usually maintain some kind of fax capability,{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} the technology has faced increasing competition from [[Internet]]-based alternatives. In some countries, because [[electronic signature]]s on contracts are not yet [[Electronic signature#Enforceability of electronic signatures|recognized by law]], while faxed contracts with copies of signatures are, fax machines enjoy continuing support in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adamsdrafting.com/2007/11/07/fax-and-scanned-signatures/|title=Enforceability of Fax and Scanned Signature Pages|last=Adams|first=Ken|date=7 November 2007|publisher=AdamsDrafting|accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Japan]], faxes are still used extensively for cultural and graphemic reasons and are available for sending to both domestic and international recipients from over 81% of all convenience stores nationwide. Convenience-store fax machines commonly print the slightly re-sized content of the sent fax in the electronic confirmation-slip, in [[A4 paper]] size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawson.co.jp/service/counter/fax.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210112224/http://www.lawson.co.jp/service/counter/fax.html |archive-date=2015-02-10 |title=FAXサービス｜サービス｜ローソン |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fackler|first=Martin|title=In High-Tech Japan, the Fax Machines Roll On|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/world/asia/in-japan-the-fax-machine-is-anything-but-a-relic.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0&amp;ref=world|accessdate=14 February 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oi |first=Mariko |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19045837 |title=BBC News – Japan and the fax: A love affair |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-07-31 |accessdate=2014-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many corporate environments, freestanding fax machines have been replaced by [[fax server]]s and other computerized systems capable of receiving and storing incoming faxes electronically, and then routing them to users on paper or via an [[email]] (which may be secured). Such systems have the advantage of reducing costs by eliminating unnecessary printouts and reducing the number of inbound analog phone lines needed by an office.

The once ubiquitous fax machine has also begun to disappear from the small office and home office environments. Remotely hosted fax-server services are widely available from VoIP and e-mail providers allowing users to send and receive faxes using their existing e-mail accounts without the need for any hardware or dedicated fax lines. Personal computers have also long been able to handle incoming and outgoing faxes using analog modems or [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]], eliminating the need for a stand-alone fax machine. These solutions are often ideally suited for users who only very occasionally need to use fax services.  In July 2017 the United Kingdom's [[National Health Service]] was said to be the world's largest purchaser of fax machines because the digital revolution has largely bypassed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Digital doldrums: NHS remains world’s largest purchaser of fax machines|url=http://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/Health-Care-News/digital-doldrums-nhs-remains-worlds-largest-purchaser-of-fax-machines|accessdate=1 March 2018|publisher=National Health Executive|date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2018 the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] said that the NHS had at least 11,620 fax machines in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NHS 'Struggling To Keep Up' As It Holds On To Thousands Of Fax Machines |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/nhs-fax-machines-labour_uk_5b1e5f83e4b09d7a3d7508e7 |accessdate=11 June 2018 |publisher=Huffington Post |date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capabilities ==
There are several indicators of fax capabilities: group, class, data transmission rate, and conformance with [[ITU-T]] (formerly [[CCITT]]) recommendations. Since the 1968 [[Carterphone decision]], most fax machines have been designed to connect to standard [[PSTN]] lines and telephone numbers.

=== Group ===

==== Analog ====
Group 1 and 2 faxes are sent in the same manner as a frame of [[analog television]], with each scanned line transmitted as a continuous analog signal. Horizontal resolution depended upon the quality of the scanner, transmission line, and the printer. Analog fax machines are obsolete and no longer manufactured.  ITU-T Recommendations T.2 and T.3 were withdrawn as obsolete in July 1996.

* Group 1 faxes conform to the ITU-T Recommendation T.2. Group 1 faxes take six minutes to transmit a single page, with a vertical resolution of 96 [[scan line]]s per inch. Group 1 fax machines are obsolete and no longer manufactured.
* Group 2 faxes conform to the ITU-T Recommendations T.3 and T.30. Group 2 faxes take three minutes to transmit a single page, with a vertical resolution of 96 scan lines per inch. Group 2 fax machines are almost obsolete, and are no longer manufactured.  Group 2 fax machines can interoperate with Group 3 fax machines.

==== Digital ====
[[File:Dacom DFC-10.jpg|thumb|300 px|The Dacom DFC-10—the first digital fax machine.&lt;ref name="etd.ohiolink.edu"/&gt;]]
[[File:Faxchip.jpg|thumb|300 px|The chip in a fax machine. Only about one quarter of the length is shown. The thin line in the middle consists of photosensitive [[pixel]]s. The read-out circuit is at left.]]
[[File:MN8051 Matsushita CCD side+ cm.jpg|thumb|300 px|CCD MN8051 Matsushita CCD side, monochrome 2048-bit linear sensor +cm (centimeters)]]
A major breakthrough in the development of the modern facsimile system was the result of digital technology, where the analog signal from scanners was digitized and then compressed, resulting in the ability to transmit high rates of data across standard phone lines. The first digital fax machine was the [[Dacom]] Rapidfax first sold in late 1960s, which incorporated digital data compression technology developed by [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] for transmission of images from satellites.&lt;ref name="etd.ohiolink.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fax 1971, Pages 112-114"/&gt;

Group 3 and 4 faxes are digital formats, and take advantage of digital compression methods to greatly reduce transmission times.

* Group 3 faxes conform to the ITU-T Recommendations T.30 and T.4. Group 3 faxes take between six and fifteen seconds to transmit a single page (not including the initial time for the fax machines to handshake and synchronize). The horizontal and vertical resolutions are allowed by the T.4 standard to vary among a set of fixed resolutions:
** Horizontal: 100 scan lines per inch
*** Vertical: 100 scan lines per inch ("Basic")
** Horizontal: 200 or 204 scan lines per inch
*** Vertical: 100 or 98 scan lines per inch ("Standard")
*** Vertical: 200 or 196 scan lines per inch ("Fine")
*** Vertical: 400 or 391 (note not 392) scan lines per inch ("Superfine")
** Horizontal: 300 scan lines per inch
*** Vertical: 300 scan lines per inch
** Horizontal: 400 or 408 scan lines per inch
*** Vertical: 400 or 391 scan lines per inch ("Ultrafine")
* Group 4 faxes conform to the ITU-T Recommendations T.563, T.503, T.521, T.6, T.62, T.70, T.411 to T.417. They are designed to operate over 64 kbit/s digital [[ISDN]] circuits. The allowed resolutions, a superset of those in the T.4 recommendation, are specified in the T.6 recommendation.&lt;ref name="T6"/&gt;

Fax Over IP ([[FoIP]]) can transmit and receive pre-digitized documents at near realtime speeds using [[T.38 ITU-T recommendation|ITU-T recommendation T.38]] to send digitised images over an [[IP network]] using [[JPEG]] compression. T.38 is designed to work with [[VoIP]] services and often supported by [[analog telephone adapter]]s used by legacy fax machines that need to connect through a VoIP service. Scanned documents are limited to the amount of time the user takes to load the document in a scanner and for the device to process a digital file. The resolution can vary from as little as 150 DPI to 9600 DPI or more. This type of faxing is not related to the e-mail to fax service that still uses fax modems at least one way.

=== Class ===
Computer modems are often designated by a particular fax class, which indicates how much processing is offloaded from the computer's CPU to the fax modem.

* Class 1 fax devices do fax data transfer where the T.4/T.6 data compression and T.30 session management are performed by software on a controlling computer. This is described in ITU-T recommendation T.31.&lt;ref name=peterson2000&gt;{{cite book| first=Kerstin Day | last=Peterson | year=2000| title=Business telecom systems: a guide to choosing the best technologies and services| pages=191–192| publisher=Focal Press| isbn=1578200415| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W79R0niNU5wC&amp;pg=PA191| accessdate=2011-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Class 2 fax devices perform T.30 session management themselves, but the T.4/T.6 data compression is performed by software on a controlling computer. The relevant ITU-T recommendation is T.32.&lt;ref name=peterson2000/&gt;
* Class 2.0 is different from Class 2.
* Class 2.1 is an improvement of Class 2.0.  Class 2.1 fax devices are referred to as "super G3"; they seem to be a little faster than Class 1/2/2.0.
* Class 3 fax devices are responsible for virtually the entire fax session, given little more than a phone number and the text to send (including rendering ASCII text as a raster image). These devices are not common.{{cn|date=November 2018}}&lt;!-- does a multifunction printer/fax supporting PostScript count? --&gt;

=== Data transmission rate ===
Several different telephone line modulation techniques are used by fax machines. They are negotiated during the fax-[[modem]] [[handshaking|handshake]], and the fax devices will use the highest data rate that both fax devices support, usually a minimum of 14.4 kbit/s for Group 3 fax.

Note that "Super Group 3" faxes use V.34bis modulation that allows a data rate of up to 33.6 kbit/s.

=== Compression ===
As well as specifying the resolution (and allowable physical size of the image being faxed), the ITU-T T.4 recommendation specifies two compression methods for decreasing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted between the fax machines to transfer the image. The two methods defined in T.4 are:&lt;ref name="T4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.4/en|title=T.4: Standardization of Group 3 facsimile terminals for document transmission|publisher=ITU-T|date=2011-03-14|accessdate=2013-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Modified Huffman coding|Modified Huffman]] (MH), and
*[[Modified READ]] (MR) (''Relative Element Address Designate''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1456020&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F5%2F31291%2F01456020.pdf%3Farnumber%3D1456020 ''International digital facsimile coding standards],'' Hunter, R., and Robinson, A.H., Proceedings of the IEEE Volume 68 Issue 7, pp 854–867, July 1980&lt;/ref&gt;), optional
An additional method is specified in T.6:&lt;ref name="T6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.6/en|title=T.6: Facsimile coding schemes and coding control functions for Group 4 facsimile apparatus|publisher=ITU-T|date=November 1988|accessdate=2013-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Group 4 compression|Modified Modified READ]] (MMR)
Later, other compression techniques were added as options to ITU-T recommendation T.30, such as the more efficient [[JBIG]] (T.82, T.85) for bi-level content, and [[JPEG]] (T.81), T.43, [[Mixed raster content|MRC]] (T.44), and T.45 for grayscale, palette, and colour content.&lt;ref name="T30"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.30|title=T.30: Procedures for document facsimile transmission in the general switched telephone network|publisher=ITU-T|date=2014-05-15|accessdate=2013-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fax machines can negotiate at the start of the T.30 session to use the best technique implemented on both sides.

==== Modified Huffman ====
{{Main|Modified Huffman coding}}
Modified Huffman (MH), specified in T.4 as the one-dimensional coding scheme, is a codebook-based run-length encoding scheme optimised to efficiently compress whitespace.&lt;ref name="T4"/&gt; As most faxes consist mostly of white space, this minimises the transmission time of most faxes. Each line scanned is compressed independently of its predecessor and successor.&lt;ref name="T4"/&gt;

==== Modified READ ====
Modified READ (MR), specified as an optional two-dimensional coding scheme in T.4, encodes the first scanned line using MH.&lt;ref name="T4"/&gt; The next line is compared to the first, the differences determined, and then the differences are encoded and transmitted.&lt;ref name="T4"/&gt;  This is effective as most lines differ little from their predecessor.  This is not continued to the end of the fax transmission, but only for a limited number of lines until the process is reset and a new 'first line' encoded with MH is produced.  This limited number of lines is to prevent errors propagating throughout the whole fax, as the standard does not provide for error-correction.  MR is an optional facility, and some fax machines do not use MR in order to minimise the amount of computation required by the machine. The limited number of lines is two for 'Standard' resolution faxes, and four for 'Fine' resolution faxes.

==== Modified Modified READ ====
{{Main|Group 4 compression}}
The ITU-T T.6 recommendation adds a further compression type of Modified Modified READ (MMR), which simply allows for a greater number of lines to be coded by MR than in T.4.&lt;ref name="T6"/&gt;  This is because T.6 makes the assumption that the transmission is over a circuit with a low number of line errors such as digital [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]]. In this case, there is no maximum number of lines for which the differences are encoded.

==== JBIG ====

In 1999, ITU-T recommendation T.30 added [[JBIG]] (ITU-T T.82) as another [[lossless]] [[Binary image|bi-level]] compression algorithm, or more precisely a "fax profile" subset of JBIG (ITU-T T.85). JBIG-compressed pages result in 20% to 50% faster transmission than MMR-compressed pages, and up to 30-times faster transmission if the page includes [[halftone]] images.

[[JBIG]] performs [[adaptive compression]], that is both the encoder and decoder collect statistical information about the transmitted image from the pixels transmitted so far, in order to predict the probability for each next pixel being either black or white. For each new pixel, JBIG looks at ten nearby, previously transmitted pixels. It counts, how often in the past the next pixel has been black or white in the same neighborhood, and estimates from that the probability distribution of the next pixel. This is fed into an [[arithmetic coder]], which adds only a small fraction of a bit to the output sequence if the more probable pixel is then encountered.

The ITU-T T.85 "fax profile" constrains some optional features of the full JBIG standard, such that codecs do not have to keep data about more than the last three pixel rows of an image in memory at any time. This allows the streaming of "endless" images, where the height of the image may not be known until the last row is transmitted.

ITU-T T.30 allows fax machines to negotiate one of two options of the T.85 "fax profile":
* In "basic mode", the JBIG encoder must split the image into horizontal stripes of 128 lines (parameter L0=128), and restart the arithmetic encoder for each stripe.
* In "option mode", there is no such constraint.

==== Matsushita Whiteline Skip ====
A proprietary compression scheme employed on Panasonic fax machines is Matsushita Whiteline Skip (MWS). It can be overlaid on the other compression schemes, but is operative only when two Panasonic machines are communicating with one another. This system detects the blank scanned areas between lines of text, and then compresses several blank scan lines into the data space of a single character. (JBIG implements a similar technique called "typical prediction", if header flag TPBON is set to 1.)

=== Typical characteristics ===
Group 3 fax machines transfer one or a few printed or handwritten pages per minute in black-and-white (bitonal) at a [[Optical resolution|resolution]] of 204×98 (normal) or 204×196 (fine) dots per square inch. The transfer rate is 14.4&amp;nbsp;kbit/s or higher for modems and some fax machines, but fax machines support speeds beginning with 2400 bit/s and typically operate at 9600 bit/s. The transferred image formats are called [[ITU-T]] (formerly CCITT) fax group 3 or 4. Group 3 faxes have the [[Filename extension|suffix]] &lt;code&gt;.g3&lt;/code&gt; and the [[MIME type]] &lt;tt&gt;image/g3fax&lt;/tt&gt;.

The most basic fax mode transfers in black and white only. The original page is scanned in a resolution of 1728 [[pixel]]s/line and 1145 lines/page (for [[A4 paper size|A4]]). The resulting raw data is [[data compression|compressed]] using a modified [[Huffman coding|Huffman code]] optimized for written text, achieving average compression factors of around 20. Typically a page needs 10&amp;nbsp;s for transmission, instead of about 3 minutes for the same uncompressed raw data of 1728×1145 bits at a speed of 9600&amp;nbsp;bit/s. The compression method uses a Huffman codebook for run lengths of black and white runs in a single scanned line, and it can also use the fact that two adjacent scanlines are usually quite similar, saving bandwidth by encoding only the differences.

Fax classes denote the way fax programs interact with fax hardware. Available classes include Class 1, Class 2, Class 2.0 and 2.1, and Intel CAS. Many modems support at least class 1 and often either Class 2 or Class 2.0. Which is preferable to use depends on factors such as hardware, software, modem firmware, and expected use.

===Printing process===
Fax machines from the 1970s to the 1990s often used direct [[thermal printer]]s with rolls of thermal paper as their printing technology, but since the mid-1990s there has been a transition towards plain-paper faxes: [[thermal transfer printer]]s, [[inkjet printer]]s and [[Laser printing|laser printers]].

One of the advantages of inkjet printing is that inkjets can affordably print in [[color]]; therefore, many of the inkjet-based fax machines claim to have color fax capability. There is a standard called ITU-T30e (formally ITU-T Recommendation T.30 Annex E &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=tsbmail |url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.30-200509-I/en |title=T.30 : Procedures for document facsimile transmission in the general switched telephone network |publisher=Itu.int |date= |accessdate=2014-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;) for faxing in color; however, it is not widely supported, so many of the color fax machines can only fax in color to machines from the same manufacturer.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Stroke speed ===
Stroke speed in facsimile systems is the rate at which a fixed line perpendicular to the direction of [[Image scanning|scanning]] is crossed in one direction by a scanning or [[recording spot]]. Stroke speed is usually expressed as a number of strokes per minute. When the fax system scans in both directions, the stroke speed is twice this number. In most conventional 20th century mechanical systems, the stroke speed is equivalent to drum speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C MS188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fax paper ===
[[File:ThermalPaperG3-TMG.JPG|thumb|[[Thermal paper|Paper]] roll for [[thermal printing|direct thermal]] fax machine]]
As a precaution, thermal fax paper is typically not accepted in archives or as documentary evidence in some courts of law unless photocopied. This is because the image-forming coating is eradicable and brittle, and it tends to detach from the medium after a long time in storage.&lt;ref&gt;"4.12 Filing rules: 19.Newspaper extracts or thermal facsimile paper should not be preserved as archives. Such extracts should be photocopied and the copy preserved. The original can then be destroyed." Office of Corporate &amp; Legal Affairs, University College Cork, Ireland&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet fax ==
{{see also|Internet fax}}
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
One popular alternative is to subscribe to an [[Internet fax]] service, allowing users to send and receive faxes from their [[personal computer]]s using an existing [[email account]]. No software, fax server or fax machine is needed. Faxes are received as attached [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]] or [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] files, or in proprietary formats that require the use of the service provider's software. Faxes can be sent or retrieved from anywhere at any time that a user can get Internet access. Some services offer secure faxing to comply with stringent [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] and [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] requirements to keep medical information and financial information private and secure. Utilizing a fax service provider does not require paper, a dedicated fax line, or consumable resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.efax.com/blog/online-fax-2/five-reasons-to-adopt-online-fax|title=Online Fax vs Traditional Fax|date=16 May 2013|publisher=eFax|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another alternative to a physical fax machine is to make use of computer [[software]] which allows people to send and receive faxes using their own computers, utilizing [[fax server]]s and [[unified messaging]]. A virtual (email) fax can be printed out and then signed and scanned back to computer before being emailed. Also the sender can attach a digital signature to the document file.

With the surging popularity of mobile phones, virtual fax machines can now be downloaded as applications for Android and iOS. These applications make use of the phone's internal camera to scan fax documents for upload or they can import from various cloud services.

'''FinTech Awards''' are several award ceremonies, most of them unrelated, which are held all over the world to recognize excellence in [[financial technology]] as assessed by public vote and panels of judges. As a rule, there are many categories and prizes. Hundreds of companies, mostly [[startup company|startups]], participate as candidates.

As of 2016, major fintech awards ceremonies are held in [[India]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[South Africa]], [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[United States]]. Two ceremonies are not national but continental: the African FinTech Awards and Conference, and the European Fintech Awards.

==Awards by country and continent==

===Africa===

The first ''African FinTech Awards and Conference'' will be held within the Finance Indaba Africa conference and expo in [[Johannesburg]] in October 2016. It will gather [[Africa]]'s leading FinTech entrepreneurs, bankers, investors and advisors.&lt;ref name=Africa&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.fintechafrica.co.za/awards.html |title = FinTech Awards &amp; Conference Africa: Meet the African FinTech 100 |publisher = FinTech Africa |date = 2016 |accessdate = 16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===

The 1st ''Annual Australian FinTech Awards'' will be held on 23 June 2016. The awards will be given in thirteen categories. The project, product, research paper, campaign, or activity that is entered must have been created, developed or released in the 18 months before the awards to be a valid entry.&lt;ref name=Fintech&gt;{{cite web |url = http://fintechawards.net/ |title = 1st Annual Australian FinTech Awards 2016 |publisher = FinTech Awards |date = 2016 |accessdate = 16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded by Glen Frost, the founder of  FinTech Summit, and sponsored by [[Ashurst LLP|Ashurst]], the awards celebrate the achievements of the people and businesses comprising the [[fintech]] sector.&lt;ref name=Leader&gt;{{cite web |url = http://thoughtleadership.grantthornton.com.au/post/102dbdl/recognising-the-achievements-of-the-fintech-sector |title = Recognising the achievements of the Fintech sector! |author = Madeleine Mattera |publisher = Thought Leadership |date = 19 April 2016 |accessdate = 24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Summit&gt;{{cite web |url = http://fintechsummit.com.au/ |title = FinTech Summit 2016 |publisher = FinTech Summit |accessdate = 24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=Meetup&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.meetup.com/en-AU/FinTech-Sydney/messages/boards/thread/49813040 |title = FinTech Awards 2016: now FREE to enter |author = Glen Frost |publisher = FinTech Sydney |date = 4 May 2016 |accessdate = 24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

The Canadian FinTech Awards were created in 2014 by the Digital Finance Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalfinanceinstitute.org|title=Digital Finance Institute|website=www.digitalfinanceinstitute.org|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; a prominent global think tank for FinTech created in 2013, that has helped build the Canadian FinTech ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalfinanceinstitute.org/?page_id=330|title=FinTech – Digital Finance Institute|website=www.digitalfinanceinstitute.org|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Canadian FinTech Awards were held on October 19 2015, in Toronto as part of the  Digital Finance Institute's Annual National Conference in [[Toronto]].

===Europe===

The ''European FinTech Awards'' is an organization that aims to disrupt traditional financial intuitions by providing a platform for fintech [[entrepreneur]]s to collaborate with one another.&lt;ref name=Week&gt;{{cite web |url = http://paymentweek.com/2016-5-5-blockchain-firm-wins-eu-fintech-award-10432/ |title = Blockchain Firm Wins EU Fintech Award |author = Ryan Kennedy |publisher = Payment Week |date = 5 May 2016 |accessdate = 24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Dutch and African awards, the European awards are the result of an initiative of Alex van Groningen BV, a Dutch financial publisher.&lt;ref name=Holland&gt;{{cite web |url = http://hollandfintech.com/dutch-isnt-holland-fintech/ |title = Why Dutch isn’t the same as Holland in FinTech |publisher = Holland Fintech |date = 5 December 2015 |accessdate = 16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The awards start with the ''European FinTech 100'', a selection of innovative companies with ground-breaking ideas and technologies. The wide batch is chosen by the vote of more than 55,000 fintech enthusiasts from all over Europe (as of 2016). Then a panel of fintech experts reduces the selection to one hundred companies. The one hundred, in turn, are the pool from which the finalists are chosen. The finalists have the opportunity to pitch during the conference.&lt;ref name=Egg&gt;{{cite web |url = https://eggsplore.eu/en/blog/2016/04/european-fintech-awards-conference-2016 |title = European FinTech Awards &amp; Conference 2016 |publisher = Eggsplore |date = 5 April 2016 |accessdate = 16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Euro&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.fintech.nl/videos-european-fintech-awards--conference-14-april-2016.html |title = Videos European FinTech Awards &amp; Conference |publisher = European FinTech Awards |date = 2016 |accessdate = 16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first European FinTech Awards &amp; Conference was held in [[Amsterdam]] on 14 April 2016. 413 companies from 34 European countries were nominated. 30% of all nominees were from [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Baltic&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/good_for_business/?doc=120075 |title = For the first time, Latvian agency enters European Fintech Awards as TOP3 Innovative Banking company |publisher = The Baltic Course |date = 28 April 2016 |accessdate = 24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bilan&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bilan.ch/techno-plus-de-redaction/meilleures-startups-de-scene-fintech-europe |title = Quelles sont les meilleures start-up de la scène fintech en Europe? |publisher = Bilan |language = french |date = 15 March 2016 |accessdate = 24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviosec was the winner of the award for the Best European FinTech Company 2016. Winners in the 9 sub-categories were: [[Monese]] (Challenger Banks), Funding Circle (Alternative Finance), Ebury (Payments), Wikifolio (PFM), Everledger (Blockchain), Kreditech (Financial Inclusion), Knip (InsurTech), Backbase (Innovative Banking Software), and Behaviosec (Risk, Intelligence &amp; Security).&lt;ref name=Euro2&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.fintech.nl/blog/winners-of-european-fintech-awards-2016-announced |title = Winners of European FinTech Awards 2016 announced |publisher = European FinTech Awards |date = 15 April 2016 |accessdate = 16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
FinTech Awards is an event organized by the India FinTech Forum along with several startup accelerators. The winners are decided by a panel of industry stalwarts. The event focuses on actual working product demonstrations to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship.

===Italy===

The ''Italian Fintech Awards'' originated from the Grand Prix for Italian startups, held in 2014. The Grand Prix and the Fintech Awards, both organized by CheBanca!, have been geared towards the best Italian fintech startups. The 2016 edition had a call for submission till 31 March. 12 finalists were chosen among the candidates.&lt;ref name=Italia&gt;{{cite web |url = http://smartmoney.startupitalia.eu/chebanca-italian-fintech-awards-2016 |title = CheBanca! Italian Fintech Awards 2016 |publisher = StartupItalia! |language = italian |date = 2016 |accessdate = 16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winner is awarded 25,000 euros, personalized workshops with startup coaches, and a visit to a startup bootcamp in London. In 2016, the co-winners of the ceremony in [[Milan]] were Ovalmoney and eXrade.&lt;ref name=Economy&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.economyup.it/startup/4341_italian-fintech-awards-vincono-la-startup-di-benedetta-arese-lucini-e-trakti.htm |title = Italian Fintech Awards, vincono eXrade e la startup di Benedetta Arese Lucini |publisher = EconomyUp |language = italian |date = 7 May 2016 |accessdate = 24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luxembourg===

The first Fintech Lion Awards in Luxembourg, where held on 21 June 2016. Among the candidates, 15 start-ups from Luxembourg were chosen to pitch their projects at the semi-finals in May. Ten of them were chosen for the finals, which will be held under the patronage of Prime Minister [[Xavier Bettel]].&lt;ref name=Luxe&gt;{{cite web |url = http://paperjam.lu/news/fintech-awards-a-vos-dossiers |title = Fintech Awards: à vos dossiers |author = Xavier Bettel |publisher = Paperjam |language = french |date = 10 April 2016 |accessdate = 24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===

The first ''Dutch Fintech Awards'' took place at the headquarters of host [[ABN AMRO]] in [[Amsterdam]] in 2015. A 40-member jury gave awards in seven categories.&lt;ref name=RTL&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/economie/home/adyen-wint-fintech-awards |title = Adyen wint Fintech Awards |author = Frederieke Hegger| publisher = RTL Nieuws |language = dutch |date = 20 April 2015 |accessdate = 16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards were attended by some 400 national and international fintech investors, companies, experts and executives.&lt;ref name=Emerce&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.emerce.nl/nieuws/adyen-fintech-company-the-year-2015 |title = Adyen is FinTech Company of the Year 2015 |publisher = Emerce |language = dutch |date = 20 April 2015 |accessdate = 24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Adyen was the overall winner, receiving the award for a lasting breakthrough in the current payment industry. The winners in particular categories were: AcceptEmail (Payments), Five degrees (Banking IT), Bux (Personal Finance), Bitonic (Bitcoin), Sparkholder (Intelligence &amp; Analytics), Symbid (SME).&lt;ref name=Emerce /&gt;

===Switzerland===

The call for submissions for the first ''Swiss Fintech Award'' was published in October 2015. Any company founded by a Swiss citizen or headquartered in Switzerland could participate. A jury of 16 experts chose the top ten enterprises that would be trained in boot camps. The second round was a [[speed dating]] event with the jury and award sponsors in early February 2016. The three finalists pitched their ideas at the financial and economic forum "Fintech 2016" on 31 March 2016. The winner won a cash prize and a stay at the [[Accenture]] Fintech Innovation Lab in London.&lt;ref name=Swiss&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.netzwoche.ch/de-CH/News/2015/10/02/Registrierungsbeginn-fuer-Swiss-Fintech-Award.aspx |title = Registrierungsbeginn für Swiss Fintech Award |publisher = Netzwoche |language = german |date = 2 October 2015 |accessdate = 24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

The ''UK Fintech Awards'' ceremony was held in London on 13 April 2016. Sponsored by Bobsguide, the awards recognized achievements across the global financial technology industry.&lt;ref name=Bob&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bobsguide.com/guide/news/2016/Apr/21/imagines-innovative-expertise-celebrated-at-2016-fintech-awards/ |title = Imagine's Innovative Expertise Celebrated at 2016 FinTech Awards |publisher = Bobs Guide |date = 21 April 2016 |accessdate = 24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Bogdanovich Kistiakowsky''' (November 18, 1900&amp;nbsp;– December 7, 1982) ({{lang-uk|Георгій Богданович Кістяківський}}, {{lang-ru|Георгий Богданович Кистяковский}}) was a [[Ukrainian-American]] [[physical chemistry]] professor at [[Harvard]] who participated in the [[Manhattan Project]] and later served as President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s [[President's Science Advisory Committee|Science Advisor]].

Born in [[Kiev]] in the old [[Russian Empire]], into "an old Ukrainian [[Cossack]] family which was part of the intellectual elite in pre-revolutionary Russia",&lt;ref&gt;''The Ukrainian Review'', v. 7 (1959), p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Kistiakowsky fled his homeland during the [[Russian Civil War]]. He made his way to Germany, where he earned his [[PhD]] in physical chemistry under the supervision of [[Max Bodenstein]] at the [[University of Berlin]]. He emigrated to the United States in 1926, where he joined the faculty of [[Harvard University]] in 1930, and became a citizen in 1933.

During World War II, Kistiakowsky was the head of the [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC) section responsible for the development of explosives, and the technical director of the Explosives Research Laboratory (ERL), where he oversaw the development of new explosives, including [[RDX]] and [[HMX]]. He was involved in research into the [[hydrodynamic]] theory of explosions, and the development of [[shaped charge]]s. In October 1943, he was brought into the Manhattan Project as a consultant. He was soon placed in charge of X Division, which was responsible for the development of the [[explosive lens]]es necessary for an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]]. In July 1945, he watched as the first one was detonated in the [[Trinity test]]. A few weeks later another [[Fat Man]] implosion-type weapon was dropped on [[Nagasaki]].

From 1962 to 1965, Kistiakowsky chaired the [[National Academy of Sciences]]'s [[Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy]] (COSEPUP), and was its vice president from 1965 to 1973. He severed his connections with the government in protest against the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]], and became active in an antiwar organization, the [[Council for a Livable World]], becoming its chairman in 1977.

== Early life ==
George Bogdanovich Kistiakowsky was born in [[Kiev]], in the [[Kiev Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (now part of [[Ukraine]]), on November 18, 1900.{{sfn|Dainton|1985|pp=379–380}}  George's grandfather Oleksandr Fedorovych Kistiakovsky was a professor of law and an attorney of the Russian Empire who specialized in [[criminal law]].{{sfn|Heuman|1998|pp=7–8, 213}} His father Bogdan Kistiakovsky was Professor of Legal Philosophy at the University of Kiev,{{sfn|Dainton|1985|pp=379–380}} and was  elected a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] in 1919.{{sfn|Heuman|1998|pp=37–38}} Kistiakowsky's mother was Maria Berendshtam, and he had a brother, Alexander.{{sfn|Dainton|1985|pp=379–380}} George's uncle Ihor Kistiakovsky was the Minister of Internal Affairs of the [[Ukrainian State]].{{sfn|Heuman|1998|pp=37–38}}

Kistiakowsky attended private schools in Kiev and [[Moscow]] until the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] broke out in 1917. He then joined the anti-Communist [[White Army]]. In 1920 he escaped from Russia in a commandeered French ship. After spending time in Turkey and [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes|Yugoslavia]], he made his way to [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], where he enrolled at the [[University of Berlin]] later that year.{{sfn|Dainton|1985|pp=379–380}} In 1925, he earned his [[PhD]] in [[physical chemistry]] under the supervision of [[Max Bodenstein]], writing his thesis on the [[photochemical]] decomposition of [[chlorine monoxide]] and [[ozone]]. He then became Bodenstein's graduate assistant.&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hua08001 |title=Kistiakowsky, George B. (George Bogdan), 1900– Papers of George B. Kistiakowsky : an inventory |publisher=[[Harvard University]] |accessdate=May 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dainton|1985|pp=379–380}} His first two published papers were elaborations of his thesis, co-written with Bodenstein.{{sfn|Dainton|1985|p=401}}

In 1926, Kistiakowsky traveled to the United States as an [[International Education Board]] fellow. [[Hugh Stott Taylor]], another student of Bodenstein,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academictree.org/chemistry/tree.php?pid=52121&amp;pnodecount=4&amp;cnodecount=2&amp;fontsize=3 |title=Chemistry Tree&amp;nbsp;— Max Ernst August Bodenstein Family Tree |publisher=Chemistry Tree |accessdate=May 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; accepted  Bodenstein's assessment of Kistiakowsky, and gave him a place at [[Princeton University]]. That year, Kistiakowsky married a Swedish woman, Hildegard Moebius.{{sfn|Dainton|1985|pp=379–380}} In 1928, they had a daughter, [[Vera Kistiakowsky|Vera]], who later became a [[Professor Emerita]] of Physics at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="Vera"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.cambridgema.gov/historic/cwhp/bios_k.html |title=Vera   Kistiakowsky |publisher=Cambridge Women's Heritage Project |accessdate=7 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kistiakowsky's two-year fellowship ran out in 1927, he received a Research Associate and DuPont Fellowship. On October 25, 1928, he became an associate professor at Princeton.&lt;ref name="Harvard" /&gt;{{sfn|Dainton|1985|pp=379–380}} Taylor and Kistiakowsky  published a series of papers together.{{sfn|Dainton|1985|p=401}} Encouraged by Taylor, Kistiakowsky also published an [[American Chemical Society]] [[monograph]] on photochemical processes.{{sfn|Dainton|1985|p=401}}{{sfn|Dainton|1985|pp=379–380}}

In 1930, Kistiakowsky joined the faculty of [[Harvard University]], an affiliation that continued throughout his career. At Harvard, his research interests were in [[thermodynamics]], [[spectroscopy]], and [[chemical kinetics]]. He became increasingly involved in consulting for the government and industry. He became an associate professor again, this time at Harvard in 1933. That year he also became an American citizen. In 1938, he became the Abbott and James Lawrence Professor of Chemistry.{{sfn|Dainton|1985|p=382}}

== World War II ==

=== National Defense Research Committee ===
[[File:George Kistiakowsky ID badge.png|thumb|right|Kistiakowsky's Los Alamos wartime security badge|alt=Head and shoulders mug shot of middle-aged man in suit and tie. Lettering reads "C 16"]]
Foreseeing an expanded role for science in [[World War II]], which the United States had not yet joined, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] created the [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC) on June 27, 1940, with [[Vannevar Bush]] as its chairman. [[James B. Conant]], the President  of Harvard,{{sfn|Stewart|1948|p=7}} was appointed head of Division B, which was responsible for bombs, fuels, gases and chemicals. He appointed Kistiakowsky to head its Section A-1, which was concerned with explosives.{{sfn|Stewart|1948|p=10}} In June 1941, the NDRC was absorbed into the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] (OSRD). Bush became Chairman of the OSRD, Conant succeeded him as Chairman of the NDRC, and Kistiakowsky became head of Section B.{{sfn|Stewart|1948|pp=52–54}} In a reorganization in December 1942, Division B was broken up, and he became head of Division 8, which was responsible for explosives and propellants, remaining in this position until February 1944.{{sfn|Stewart|1948|p=88}}

Kistiakowsky was unhappy with the state of American knowledge of explosives and propellants.{{sfn|Dainton|1985|p=383}} Conant established the Explosives Research Laboratory (ERL) near the [[Experimental Mine, U.S. Bureau of Mines|laboratories]] of the [[United States Bureau of Mines|Bureau of Mines]] in [[Bruceton, Pennsylvania]] in October 1940,{{sfn|Noyes|1948|p=25}} and Kistiakowsky initially supervised its activities, making occasional visits; but Conant did not formally appoint him as its Technical Director until the spring of 1941.{{sfn|Noyes|1948|p=27}} Although initially hampered by a shortage of facilities, the ERL grew from five staff in 1941 to a wartime peak of 162 full-time laboratory staff in 1945.{{sfn|Noyes|1948|p=28}} An important field of research was [[RDX]]. This powerful explosive had been developed by the British before the war. The challenge was to develop an industrial process that could produce it on a large scale. RDX was also mixed with TNT to produce Composition B, which was widely used in various munitions, and [[torpex]], which was used in torpedoes and depth charges. Pilot plants were in operation by May 1942, and large-scale production followed in 1943.{{sfn|Noyes|1948|pp=36–42}}

In response to a special request for an explosive that could be smuggled through Japanese checkpoints by Chinese guerrillas, Kistakowsky mixed [[HMX]], a non-toxic explosive produced as a by-product of the RDX process, with flour to create "[[Aunt Jemima]]", after a brand of pancake flour. This was an edible explosive, which could pass for regular flour, and even be used in cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.military-history.org/articles/back-to-the-drawing-board-aunt-jemima.htm |journal=Military History Monthly |title=Back to the Drawing Board&amp;nbsp;– Aunt Jemima |date=June 12, 2012  |first=George |last=Clode |accessdate=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Noyes|1948|p=51}}

In addition to research into synthetic explosives like RDX and HMX, the ERL investigated the properties of [[detonation]]s and [[shock wave]]s. This was initiated as a pure research project, without obvious or immediate applications. Kistiakowsky visited England in 1941 and again in 1942, where he met with British experts, including [[William Penney]] and [[G. I. Taylor|Geoffrey Taylor]]. When Kistiakowsky and [[Edgar Bright Wilson, Jr.]], surveyed the existing state of knowledge, they found several areas that warranted further investigation. Kistiakowsky began to look into the [[Chapman–Jouguet condition|Chapman–Jouguet model]],{{sfn|Noyes|1948|pp=58–64}} which describes the way the [[shock wave]] created by a detonation propagates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chapman |first=David Leonard |authorlink=David Chapman (scientist)|title=On the Rate of Explosion in Gases |journal=Philosophical Magazine |location=London |series=Series 5 |volume=47 |issue=284 |pages=90–104 |date=January 1899 |issn=1941-5982 |lccn=sn86025845 |doi=10.1080/14786449908621243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, the efficacy of the Chapman–Jouguet model was still in doubt, and it was the subject of studies by [[John von Neumann]] at the [[Princeton Institute for Advanced Study]]. Kistiakowsky realized that the deviations from [[hydrodynamic]] theory were the result of the speed of the chemical reactions themselves. To control the reaction, calculations down to the microsecond level were needed.{{sfn|Noyes|1948|pp=58–64}} Section 8 was drawn into the investigation of [[shaped charge]]s, whose mechanism was explained by Taylor and [[James L. Tuck|James Tuck]] in 1943.{{sfn|Noyes|1948|p=73}}

=== Manhattan Project ===
At the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], research into [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] had been proceeding under [[Seth Neddermeyer]], but his division had worked with cylinders and small charges, and had only produced objects that looked like rocks. Their research was accorded a low priority, owing to expectations that a [[gun-type nuclear weapon]] design would work for both [[uranium-235]] and [[plutonium]], and implosion technology would not be required.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=130–133}}

In September 1943, the Los Alamos Laboratory's director, [[Robert Oppenheimer]], arranged for von Neumann to visit Los Alamos and investigate implosion with a fresh set of eyes. After reviewing Neddermeyer's studies, and discussing the matter with [[Edward Teller]], von Neumann suggested the use of high explosive in [[shaped charge]]s to implode a sphere, which he showed could not only result in a faster assembly of [[fissile]] material than was possible with the gun method, but which could greatly reduce the amount of material required. The prospect of more efficient nuclear weapons impressed Oppenheimer, Teller and [[Hans Bethe]], but they decided that an expert on explosives was required. Kistiakowsky's name was immediately suggested, and he was brought into the project as a consultant in October 1943.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=130–133}}

[[File:Implosion nuclear weapon design - explosive lenses.svg|left|thumb|250px|In an implosion-type nuclear weapon, polygonal [[explosive lens]]es are arranged around the spherical [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|pit]].|alt=Cut away diagram of soccer ball like arrangement, with an inner and an outer ball.]]
Kistiakowsky was initially reluctant to come, "partly because", he later explained, "I didn't think the bomb would be ready in time and I was interested in helping to win the war".{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=137}} At Los Alamos, he began reorganizing the implosion effort. He introduced techniques such as photography and X-Rays to study the behavior of shaped charges. The former had been extensively employed by the ERL, while the latter had been described in papers by Tuck, who also suggested using three-dimensional [[explosive lens]]es. As with other aspects of the Manhattan Project, research into explosive lenses followed multiple lines of inquiry simultaneously because, as Kistiakowsky noted, it was "impossible to predict which of these basic techniques will be the more successful."{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=137}}

Kistiakowsky brought with him to Los Alamos a detailed knowledge of all the studies into shaped charges, of explosives like Composition B, and of the procedures used at the ERL in 1942 and 1943. Increasingly, the ERL itself would be drawn into the implosion effort; its deputy director Duncan MacDougall also took charge of the Manhattan Project's Project Q.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=166}} Kistiakowsky replaced Neddermeyer as head of E (for explosives) Division in February 1944.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=130–133}}

The implosion program acquired a new urgency after [[Emilio Segrè]]'s group at Los Alamos verified that plutonium produced in the [[nuclear reactor]]s contained [[plutonium-240]], which made it unsuitable for use in a gun-type weapon.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=236–240}}  A series of crisis meetings in July 1944 concluded that the only prospect for a working plutonium weapon was implosion. In August, Oppenheimer reorganized the entire laboratory to concentrate on it. A new explosives group, X Division, was created under Kistiakowsky to develop the lenses.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=241–247}}

Under Kistiakowsky's leadership, X-Division designed the complex explosive lenses needed to compress the fissile plutonium [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|pit]]. These employed two explosives with significantly different [[explosive velocity|velocities of detonation]] in order to produce the required wave form. Kistiakowsky chose [[Baratol]] for the slow explosive. After experimenting with various fast explosives, X-Division settled on Composition B. Work on molding the explosives into the right shape continued into 1945. The lenses needed to be flawless, and techniques for casting Composition B and Baratol had to be developed. The ERL managed to accomplish this by devising a procedure for preparing Baratol in a form that was easy to cast.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=294–299}} In March 1945, Kistiakowsky became part of the Cowpuncher Committee, so-called because it rode herd on the implosion effort.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=316}} On July 16, 1945, Kistiakowsky watched as the first device was detonated in the [[Trinity test]].{{sfn|Dainton|1985|p=384}} A few weeks later a [[Fat Man]] implosion-type nuclear weapon was dropped on [[Nagasaki]].{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=394–396}}

Along with his work on implosion, Kistiakowsky contributed to skiing in Los Alamos by using rings of explosives to fell trees for a ski slope&amp;nbsp;— leading to the establishment of Sawyer's Hill Ski Tow Association.{{sfn|Gibson|Michnovicz|Michnovicz|2005|p=78}} He divorced Hildegard in 1942 and married Irma E. Shuler in 1945. They were divorced in 1962, and he married Elaine Mahoney.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|1687977|George Kistiakowsky|section=bio}}. Accessed May 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== White House service ==
In 1957, during the Eisenhower Administration, Kistiakowsky was appointed to the [[President's Science Advisory Committee]], and succeeded [[James R. Killian]] as chairman in 1959. He directed the [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] from 1959 to 1961, when he was succeeded by [[Jerome B. Wiesner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/about/leadershipstaff/previous |accessdate=May 10, 2013 |title=Previous Science Advisors |publisher=[[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527085230/http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/about/leadershipstaff/previous |archivedate=May 27, 2013 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Atlas missile launch.jpg|right|thumb|upright| [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas]], a first-generation [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]|alt=A rocket takes off from the launch pad. ]]
In 1958, Kistiakowsky suggested to President Eisenhower that inspection of foreign military facilities was not sufficient to control their nuclear weapons. He cited the difficulty in monitoring missile submarines, and proposed that the arms control strategy focus on disarmament rather than inspections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1960, as part of arms control planning and negotiation, he suggested the "threshold concept". Under this proposal, all nuclear tests above the level of seismic detection technology would be forbidden. After such an agreement, the US and USSR would work jointly to improve detection technology, revising the permissible test yield downward as techniques improved. This example of the "national means of technical verification", a euphemism for sensitive intelligence collection used in arms control, would provide safeguards, without raising the on-site inspection requirement to a level unacceptable to the Soviets. The US introduced the threshold concept to the Soviets at the Geneva arms control conference in January 1960 and the Soviets, in March, responded favorably, suggesting a threshold of a given seismic magnitude. Talks broke down as a result of the [[U-2 Crisis of 1960]] in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB94/ |title=The Making of the Limited Test Ban Treaty, 1958–1963 |publisher=[[George Washington University]] |editor-first=William     |editor-last=Burr  |editor2-first=Hector L. |editor2-last=Montford |accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as the early nuclear arms control work, the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], General [[Nathan F. Twining]], sent a memorandum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Up to that point, the Army, Navy, and Air Force had done their own target planning. This had led to the same objectives being targeted multiple times by the different services. The separate service plans were not mutually supporting as in, for example, the Navy destroying an air defense facility on the route of an Air Force bomber going to a deeper target. While Twining had sent the memo to McElroy, the members of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] disagreed on the policy during early 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Eisenhower said he would not "leave his successor with the monstrosity" of the uncoordinated and un-integrated forces that then existed. In early November 1960, he sent Kistiakowsky to SAC Headquarters in Omaha to evaluate its war plans. Initially, Kistiakowsky was not given access, and Eisenhower sent him back, with a much stronger set of orders for SAC officers to cooperate. Kistiakowsky's report, presented on November 29, described uncoordinated plans with huge numbers of targets, many of which would be attacked by multiple forces, resulting in overkill. Eisenhower was shocked by the plans, and focused not just on the creation of the [[Single Integrated Operational Plan]] (SIOP), but on the entire process of picking targets, generating requirements, and planning for nuclear war operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB130/ |title=The Creation of SIOP-62 More Evidence on the Origins of Overkill |publisher=[[George Washington University]] |editor-first=William |editor-last=Burr  |accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life ==
Between his work for the Manhattan Project and his White House service, and again after he left the White House, Kistiakowsky was a professor of physical chemistry at Harvard. When asked to teach a freshmen class in 1957, he turned to [[Hubert Alyea]], whose lecture style had impressed him. Alyea sent him some 700 {{convert|4|by|6|in|cm|1|adj=on}} [[index card]]s containing details of lecture demonstrations. Aside from the cards, Kistiakowsky  never prepared the demonstrations. He later recalled:{{quote|I didn't think that was giving mother Nature a sporting chance. I would come into the lecture hall, glance at the chemicals and pile of cards and announce to the students "let's see what Alyea has for us today". I never used a text book, only your cards. I would glance at the instructions and carry out the experiment. If it worked we would bless you and pass on to the next demonstration. If it didn't work we would curse you, and spend the rest of the lecture trying to make it work.{{sfn|Dainton|1985|p=382}} }} He retired from Harvard as professor emeritus in 1972.&lt;ref name="LANL" /&gt;

From 1962 to 1965, Kistiakowsky chaired the National Academy of Science's [[Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy]] (COSEPUP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Origins of COSEPUP |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/cosepup/About%20COSEPUP.html |accessdate=September 22, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423030409/http://www7.nationalacademies.org/cosepup/About%20COSEPUP.html |archivedate=April 23, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was its vice president from 1965 to 1973.{{sfn|Dainton|1985|p=386}} He received several awards over the years, including the [[Department of the Air Force Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service]] in 1957. He was awarded the [[Medal for Merit]] by President Truman, the [[Medal of Freedom (1945)|Medal of Freedom]] by President Eisenhower in 1961, and the [[National Medal of Science]] by President [[Lyndon Johnson]] in 1967. He was also a recipient the [[Charles Lathrop Parsons Award]] for public service from the [[American Chemical Society]] in 1961,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Charles Lathrop Parsons Award|url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/funding-and-awards/awards/national/bytopic/charles-lathrop-parsons-award.html|website = American Chemical Society|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Priestley Medal]] from the American Chemical Society in 1972, and the [[Franklin Medal]] from Harvard.{{sfn|Dainton|1985|p=400}}&lt;ref name="BAS" /&gt;

In later years, Kistiakowsky was active in an antiwar organization, the [[Council for a Livable World]]. He severed his connections with the government in protest against the US involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. In 1977, he assumed the chairmanship of the Council, campaigning against nuclear proliferation.&lt;ref name="LANL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanl.gov/history/people/G_Kistiakowsky.shtml |title=George B.

[[File:Greekfire-madridskylitzes1.jpg|thumb|300px|A Byzantine ship uses Greek fire against a ship of the rebel, [[Thomas the Slav]], 821. 12th century illustration from the [[Madrid Skylitzes]]]]
'''Greek fire''' was an [[incendiary device|incendiary]] weapon used by the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]] that was first developed {{c.|672}}. The Byzantines typically used it in [[Naval warfare|naval battles]] to great effect, as it could continue burning while floating on water. It provided a technological advantage and was responsible for many key Byzantine military victories, most notably the salvation of [[Constantinople]] from [[List of sieges of Constantinople|two Arab sieges]], thus securing the Empire's survival.

The impression made by Greek fire on the western European [[Crusades|Crusaders]] was such that the name was applied to any sort of incendiary weapon, including those used by Arabs, the [[China|Chinese]], and the [[Mongols]]. However, these were different mixtures and not the same formula as the Byzantine Greek fire, which was a closely guarded [[Classified information|state secret]]. Byzantines also used pressurized nozzles or ''siphōns'' to project the liquid onto the enemy, in a manner resembling a modern [[flamethrower]].

Although usage of the term "Greek fire" has been general in English and most other languages since the Crusades, original Byzantine sources called the substance a variety of names, such as "sea fire" ([[Medieval Greek]]: πῦρ θαλάσσιον ''pŷr thalássion''), "Roman fire" ({{lang|grc|πῦρ ῥωμαϊκόν}} ''pŷr rhōmaïkón''), "war fire" ({{lang|grc|πολεμικὸν πῦρ}} ''polemikòn pŷr''), "liquid fire" ({{lang|grc|ὑγρὸν πῦρ}} ''hygròn pŷr''), "sticky fire" ({{lang|grc|πῦρ κολλητικόν}} ''pŷr kollētikón'') or "manufactured fire" ({{lang|grc|πῦρ σκευαστόν}} ''pŷr skeuastón'').{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=608–609}}{{sfn|Forbes|1959|p=83}}

The composition of Greek fire remains a matter of speculation and debate, with various proposals including combinations of [[pine resin]], [[naphtha]], [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]], [[calcium phosphide]], [[sulfur]], or [[niter]].
In [[Titus Livy]]'s [[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|history of Rome]], priestesses of [[Bacchus]] are said to have dipped fire into the water, which did not extinguish, "for it was sulphur mixed with lime."

==History==
{{further|Early thermal weapons|Byzantine navy}}
Incendiary and flaming weapons were used in warfare for centuries prior to the invention of Greek fire. They included a number of sulfur-, [[petroleum]]-, and [[bitumen]]-based mixtures.{{sfn|Leicester|1971|p=75}}{{sfn|Crosby|2002|pp=88–89}} Incendiary arrows and pots containing combustible substances surrounded by caltrops or spikes, or launched by catapults, were used as early as the 9th century BC by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]] and were extensively used in the Greco-Roman world as well. Furthermore, [[Thucydides]] mentions that in the [[Battle of Delium|siege of Delium]] in 424 BC a long tube on wheels was used which blew flames forward using a large [[bellows]].{{sfn|Partington|1999|pp=1–5}}{{sfn|Forbes|1959|pp=70–74}}&lt;ref&gt;Thuc. 4.100.1&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman author Julius Africanus, writing in the 3rd Century AD, records a mixture that ignited from adequate heat and intense sunlight, used in grenades or night attacks:&lt;blockquote&gt;Automatic fire also by the following formula. This is the recipe: take equal amounts of sulphur, rock salt, ashes, thunder stone, and pyrite and pound fine in a black mortar at midday sun. Also in equal amounts of each ingredient mix together black mulberry resin and Zakynthian asphault, the latter in a liquid form and free-flowing, resulting in a product that is sooty colored. Then add to the asphalt the tiniest amount of quicklime. But because the sun is at its zenith, one must pound it carefully and protect the face, for it will ignite suddenly. When it catches fire, one should seal it in some sort of copper receptacle; in this way you will have it available in a box, without exposing it to the sun. If you should wish to ignite enemy armaments, you will smear it on in the evening, either on the armaments or some other object, but in secret; when the sun comes up, everything will be burnt up.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Africanus, ''The Cestus'', D25, 116-117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In naval warfare, the Eastern Roman Emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] (r. 491–518) is recorded by chronicler [[John Malalas]] to have been advised by a philosopher from [[Athens]] called Proclus to use sulfur to burn the ships of Vitalianus.{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=5}} Greek fire proper, however, was developed in c. 672 and is ascribed by the chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] to [[Callinicus of Heliopolis|Kallinikos]] (Latinized Callinicus), an architect from [[Heliopolis (Syria)|Heliopolis]] in the former [[Roman province|province]] of [[Phoenice (Roman province)|Phoenice]], by then overrun by the [[Muslim conquests]]:{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=607–609}}

{{quote|At that time Kallinikos, an artificer from Heliopolis, fled to the Romans. He had devised a sea fire which ignited the Arab ships and burned them with all hands. Thus it was that the Romans returned with victory and discovered the sea fire.{{sfn|Theophanes|Turtledove|1982|p=53}}}}

The accuracy and exact chronology of this account is open to question: Theophanes reports the use of fire-carrying and ''siphōn''-equipped ships by the Byzantines a couple of years before the supposed arrival of Kallinikos at Constantinople.{{sfn|Theophanes|Turtledove|1982|p=52}} If this is not due to chronological confusion of the events of the siege, it may suggest that Kallinikos merely introduced an improved version of an established weapon.{{sfn|Roland|1992|p=657}}{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=608}} The historian [[J. R. Partington|James Partington]] further thinks it likely that Greek fire was not in fact the creation of any single person but "invented by chemists in Constantinople who had inherited the discoveries of the [[Alexandria]]n chemical school."{{sfn|Partington |1999|pp=12–13}} Indeed, the 11th-century chronicler [[George Kedrenos]] records that Kallinikos came from [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] in [[Egypt]], but most scholars reject this as an error.{{sfn|Forbes|1959|p=80}} Kedrenos also records the story, considered rather implausible by modern scholars, that Kallinikos' descendants, a family called ''Lampros'', "brilliant," kept the secret of the fire's manufacture and continued doing so to Kedrenos' time.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=608}}

Kallinikos' development of Greek fire came at a critical moment in the Byzantine Empire's history: weakened by its long [[Roman–Persian Wars|wars]] with [[Sassanid Persia]], the Byzantines had been unable to effectively resist the onslaught of the [[Muslim conquests]]. Within a generation, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt had fallen to the Arabs, who in {{c.|lk=no|672}} set out to conquer the imperial capital of [[Constantinople]]. Greek fire was used to great effect against the Muslim fleets, helping to repel the Muslims at the [[Siege of Constantinople (674–678)|first]] and [[Siege of Constantinople (718)|second]] Arab sieges of the city.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=26–27, 31–32}} Records of its use in later naval battles against the [[Saracen]]s are more sporadic, but it did secure a number of victories, especially in the phase of Byzantine expansion in the late 9th and early 10th centuries.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=61–62, 72}} Utilisation of the substance was prominent in Byzantine civil wars, chiefly the revolt of the thematic fleets in 727 and the large-scale rebellion led by [[Thomas the Slav]] in 821–823. In both cases, the rebel fleets were defeated by the Constantinopolitan Imperial Fleet through the use of Greek fire.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=32, 46, 73}} The Byzantines also used the weapon to devastating effect against the various [[Rus' people|Rus']] raids on the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus]], especially those of [[Rus'–Byzantine War (941)|941]] and [[Rus'–Byzantine War (1043)|1043]], as well as during the [[Rus'–Byzantine War (970–971)|Bulgarian war of 970–971]], when the fire-carrying Byzantine ships blockaded the Danube.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=86, 189}}

The importance placed on Greek fire during the Empire's struggle against the Arabs would lead to its discovery being ascribed to divine intervention. The Emperor [[Constantine VII|Constantine Porphyrogennetos]] (r. 945–959), in his book ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', admonishes his son and heir, [[Romanos II]] (r. 959–963), to never reveal the secrets of its composition, as it was "shown and revealed by an angel to the great and holy first Christian emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]]" and that the angel bound him "not to prepare this fire but for Christians, and only in the imperial city." As a warning, he adds that one official, who was bribed into handing some of it over to the Empire's enemies, was struck down by a "flame from heaven" as he was about to enter a church.{{sfn|Moravcsik|Jenkins|1967|pp=68–71}}{{sfn|Forbes|1959|p=82}} As the latter incident demonstrates, the Byzantines could not avoid capture of their precious secret weapon: the Arabs captured at least one fireship intact in 827, and the Bulgars captured several ''siphōns'' and much of the substance itself in 812/814. This, however, was apparently not enough to allow their enemies to copy it (see [[#General characteristics|below]]). The Arabs, for instance, employed a variety of incendiary substances similar to the Byzantine weapon, but they were never able to copy the Byzantine method of deployment by ''siphōn'', and used catapults and grenades instead.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=609–611}}{{sfn|Roland|1992|pages=660, 663–664}}

Greek fire continued to be mentioned during the 12th century, and [[Anna Komnene]] gives a vivid description of its use in a naval battle against the [[Pisa]]ns in 1099.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=110}} However, although the use of hastily improvised [[fireships]] is mentioned during the [[Siege of Constantinople (1203)|1203 siege]] of Constantinople by the [[Fourth Crusade]], no report confirms the use of the actual Greek fire.  This might be because of the general disarmament of the Empire in the 20 years leading up to the sacking, or because the Byzantines had lost access to the areas where the primary ingredients were to be found, or even perhaps because the secret had been lost over time.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=630–631}}{{sfn|Haldon|2006|p=316}}

Records of a 13th-century event in which "Greek fire" was used by the Saracens against the Crusaders can be read through the Memoirs of the Lord of Joinville during the [[Seventh Crusade]].  One description of the memoir says "the tail of fire that trailed behind it was as big as a great spear; and it made such a noise as it came, that it sounded like the thunder of heaven. It looked like a dragon flying through the air. Such a bright light did it cast, that one could see all over the camp as though it were day, by reason of the great mass of fire, and the brilliance of the light that it shed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/greek-fire.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, it is reported that an [[Armenians|Armenian]] by the name of Kavafian approached the government of the [[Ottoman Empire]] with a new type of Greek fire he claimed to have developed. Kavafian refused to reveal its composition when asked by the government, insisting that he be placed in command of its use during naval engagements. Not long after this, he was poisoned by imperial authorities, without their ever having found out his secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{hy icon}} [[Hrachia Adjarian|Adjarian, Hrachia]]. "Հայոց դերը Օսմանյան կայսրության մեջ," [The role of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire] ''Banber Erevani Hamalsarani'' 1967; trans. in Charles Issawi, ''The Economic History of Turkey, 1800-1914'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture==

===General characteristics===
{{Byzantine Military}}
As Constantine Porphyrogennetos' warnings show, the ingredients and the processes of manufacture and deployment of Greek fire were carefully guarded military secrets. So strict was the secrecy that the composition of Greek fire was lost forever and remains a source of speculation.{{sfn|Haldon|2006|p=290}} Consequently, the "mystery" of the formula has long dominated the research into Greek fire. Despite this almost exclusive focus, however, Greek fire is best understood as a complete weapon system of many components, all of which were needed to operate together to render it effective. This comprised not only the formula of its composition, but also the specialized [[dromon]] ships that carried it into battle, the device used to prepare the substance by heating and pressurizing it, the ''siphōn'' projecting it, and the special training of the ''siphōnarioi'' who used it.{{sfn|Roland|1992|pp=660, 663}} Knowledge of the whole system was highly [[Compartmentalization (information security)|compartmentalised]], with operators and technicians aware of the secrets of only one component, ensuring that no enemy could gain knowledge of it in its entirety.{{sfn|Roland|1992|pp=663–664}} This accounts for the fact that when the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] took [[Nesebar|Mesembria]] and [[Debeltos]] in 814, they captured 36 ''siphōns'' and even quantities of the substance itself,{{sfn|Theophanes|Turtledove|1982|p=178}} but were unable to make any use of them.{{sfn|Roland|1992|p=663}}{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=609}}

The information available on Greek fire is exclusively indirect, based on references in the [[Byzantine military manuals]] and a number of secondary historical sources such as [[Anna Komnene]] and Western European chroniclers, which are often inaccurate. In her ''[[Alexiad]]'', Anna Komnene provides a description of an incendiary weapon, which was used by the Byzantine garrison of [[Dyrrhachium]] in 1108 against the [[Normans]]. It is often regarded as an at least partial "recipe" for Greek fire:{{sfn|Partington|1999|pp=19, 29}}{{sfn|Ellis Davidson|1973|p=64}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir James Sibbald David Scott, 3rd Baronet|Scott, James Sibbald David]], (Sir), (1868)[https://archive.org/details/britisharmyitsor02scotuoft ''The British army: its origin, progress, and equipment'', p. 190.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This fire is made by the following arts. From the pine and the certain such evergreen trees inflammable resin is collected. This is rubbed with sulfur and put into tubes of reed, and is blown by men using it with violent and continuous breath. Then in this manner it meets the fire on the tip and catches light and falls like a fiery whirlwind on the faces of the enemies.&lt;/blockquote&gt; At the same time, the reports by Western chroniclers of the famed ''ignis graecus'' are largely unreliable, since they apply the name to any and all sorts of incendiary substances.{{sfn|Haldon|2006|p=290}}

In attempting to reconstruct the Greek fire system, the concrete evidence, as it emerges from the contemporary literary references, provides the following characteristics:
* It burned on water, and, according to some interpretations, was ignited by water. In addition, as numerous writers testify, it could be extinguished only by a few substances, such as sand (which deprived it of oxygen), strong vinegar, or old urine, presumably by some sort of chemical reaction.{{sfn|Roland|1992|pp=657–658}}{{sfn|Cheronis|1937|pp=362–363}}{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=617}}

* The discharge of Greek fire was accompanied by "thunder" and "much smoke."{{sfn|Roland|1992|pp=657–658}}{{sfn|Cheronis|1937|pp=362–363}}&lt;ref&gt;Leo VI, ''[[Tactica of Emperor Leo VI the Wise|Tactica]]'', XIX.59, transl. in {{harvnb|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories on composition===
The first and, for a long time, most popular theory regarding the composition of Greek fire held that its chief ingredient was [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]], making it an early form of [[gunpowder]].{{sfn|Haldon|Byrne|1977|p=92}}{{sfn|Ellis Davidson|1973|pp=69–70}} This argument was based on the "thunder and smoke" description, as well as on the distance the flame could be projected from the ''siphōn'', which suggested an explosive discharge.{{sfn|Roland|1992|p=659}} From the times of [[Isaac Vossius]],{{sfn|Forbes|1959|p=83}} several scholars adhered to this position, most notably the so-called "French school" during the 19th century, which included chemist [[Marcellin Berthelot]].{{sfn|Roland|1992|pp=658–659}}{{sfn|Ellis Davidson|1973|p=69}} This view has been rejected since, as saltpeter does not appear to have been used in warfare in Europe or the Middle East before the 13th century, and is absent from the accounts of the Muslim writers—the [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|foremost chemists]] of the early medieval world{{sfn|al-Hassan|2001|pp=41–83}}—before the same period.{{sfn|Partington|1999|pp=21–22}} In addition, the nature of the proposed mixture would have been radically different from the ''siphōn''-projected substance described by Byzantine sources.{{sfn|Forbes|1959|pp=83–84}}

A second view, based on the fact that Greek fire was inextinguishable by water (some sources suggest that water intensified the flames) suggested that its destructive power was the result of the explosive reaction between water and [[quicklime]]. Although quicklime was certainly known and used by the Byzantines and the Arabs in warfare,{{sfn|Partington|1999|pp=6–10, 14}} the theory is refuted by literary and empirical evidence. A quicklime-based substance would have to come in contact with water to ignite, while Emperor Leo's ''[[Tactica of Emperor Leo VI the Wise|Tactica]]'' indicate that Greek fire was often poured directly on the decks of enemy ships,&lt;ref&gt;Leo VI, ''[[Tactica of Emperor Leo VI the Wise|Tactica]]'', XIX.67, transl. in {{harvnb|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=509}}&lt;/ref&gt; although admittedly, decks were kept wet due to lack of sealants. Likewise, Leo describes the use of grenades,&lt;ref&gt;Leo VI, ''[[Tactica of Emperor Leo VI the Wise|Tactica]]'', XIX.63, transl. in {{harvnb|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=509}}&lt;/ref&gt; which further reinforces the view that contact with water was not necessary for the substance's ignition.{{sfn|Roland|1992|p=660}} Furthermore, C. Zenghelis pointed out that, based on experiments, the actual result of the water–quicklime reaction would be negligible in the open sea.{{sfn|Zenghelis|1932|p=270}} Another similar proposition suggested that Kallinikos had in fact discovered [[calcium phosphide]], which can be made by boiling bones in urine within a sealed vessel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin McEvedy]] (1992), ''The New Penguin Atlas of Medieval History'', New York:  Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; On contact with water, calcium phosphide releases [[phosphine]], which ignites spontaneously. However, extensive experiments with it also failed to reproduce the described intensity of Greek fire.{{sfn|Cheronis|1937|p=363}}{{sfn|Ellis Davidson|1973|p=70}}

Although the presence of either quicklime or saltpeter in the mixture cannot be entirely excluded, they were consequently not the primary ingredient.{{sfn|Ellis Davidson|1973|p=70}}{{sfn|Roland|1992|p=659}} Most modern scholars agree that Greek fire was based on [[petroleum]], either crude or refined; comparable to modern [[napalm]]. The Byzantines had easy access to crude oil from the naturally occurring wells around the [[Black Sea]] (e.g., the wells around [[Tmutorakan]] noted by Constantine Porphyrogennetos) or in various locations throughout the Middle East.{{sfn|Haldon|Byrne|1977|p=92}}{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=4}}{{sfn|Forbes|1959|pp=82–84}} An alternate name for Greek fire was "[[Medes|Median]] fire" ({{lang|grc|μηδικὸν πῦρ}}),{{sfn|Forbes|1959|p=83}} and the 6th-century historian [[Procopius]] records that crude oil, called "[[naphtha]]" (in Greek: {{lang|grc|νάφθα}} ''naphtha'', from [[Old Persian]] {{lang|peo|[[wikt:𐎴𐎳𐎫|𐎴𐎳𐎫]]}} ''naft'') by the Persians, was known to the Greeks as "Median oil" ({{lang|grc|μηδικὸν ἔλαιον}}).&lt;ref&gt;Procopius, ''De bello Gothico'', IV.11.36, cited in {{harvnb|Partington|1999|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to corroborate the use of naphtha as a basic ingredient of Greek fire.{{sfn|Ellis Davidson|1973|p=62}} Naphtha was also used by the [[Abbasids]] in the 9th century, with special troops, the ''naffāṭūn'', who wore thick protective suits and used small copper vessels containing burning oil, which they threw onto the enemy troops.{{sfn|Partington|1999|p=22}} There is also a surviving 9th century [[Latin]] text, preserved at [[Wolfenbüttel]] in Germany, which mentions the ingredients of what appears to be Greek fire and the operation of the ''siphōn''s used to project it. Although the text contains some inaccuracies, it clearly identifies the main component as naphtha.{{sfn|Forbes|1959|p=83}}{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=614–616}} Resins were probably added as a thickener (the ''[[Praecepta Militaria]]'' refer to the substance as {{lang|grc|πῦρ κολλητικόν}}, "sticky fire"), and to increase the duration and intensity of the flame.{{sfn|Haldon|2006|p=310}}{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=618}} A modern theoretical concoction included the use of [[pine tar]] and animal fat along with other ingredients.&lt;ref name="video"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/the-link/videos/greek-fire/ | title = The Link: Greek Fire | publisher = National Geographic | accessdate = 22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 12th century treatise prepared by [[Mardi bin Ali al-Tarsusi]] for [[Saladin]] records an Arab version of Greek fire, called ''naft'', which also had a petroleum base, with sulfur and various resins added. Any direct relation with the Byzantine formula is unlikely.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=610–611}} An [[Isabella Cortese|Italian]] recipe from the 16th century has been recorded for recreational use; it includes coal from a willow tree, alcohol, incense, sulfur, wool and camphor as well as two undetermined components (burning salt and ''pegola''); the concoction was guaranteed to "burn under water" and to be "beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cortese|first1=Isabella|title=I Segreti della signora|date=1565|publisher=Giovanni Bariletto|location=Venice|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n2Ga_v5kpI4C&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=fuoco+greco+secreti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=fuoco%20greco%20secreti&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of deployment==
[[File:Hand-siphon for Greek fire, medieval illumination.jpg|thumb|Use of a ''cheirosiphōn'' ("hand-''siphōn''"), a portable flamethrower, used from atop a flying bridge against a castle. Illumination from the ''[[Poliorcetica]]'' of [[Hero of Byzantium]].]]
The chief method of deployment of Greek fire, which sets it apart from similar substances, was its projection through a tube (''siphōn''), for use aboard ships or in sieges. Portable projectors (''cheirosiphōnes'', χειροσίφωνες) were also invented, reputedly by Emperor Leo VI. The [[Byzantine military manuals]] also mention that jars (''chytrai'' or ''tzykalia'') filled with Greek fire and [[caltrop]]s wrapped with [[tow]] and soaked in the substance were thrown by catapults, while pivoting [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s (''gerania'') were employed to pour it upon enemy ships.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=378–379, 609}}{{sfn|Forbes|1959|pp=86–87}} The ''cheirosiphōnes'' especially were prescribed for use at land and in sieges, both against [[siege machines]] and against defenders on the walls, by several 10th-century military authors, and their use is depicted in the ''[[Poliorcetica]]'' of [[Hero of Byzantium]].{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=617–619}}{{sfn|Haldon|2006|p=295}} The Byzantine [[dromon]]s usually had a ''siphōn'' installed on their prow under the forecastle, but additional devices could also on occasion be placed elsewhere on the ship. Thus in 941, when the Byzantines were facing the vastly more numerous Rus' fleet, ''siphōn''s were placed also amidships and even astern.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=203, 618}}

===Projectors===
The use of tubular projectors (σίφων, ''siphōn'') is amply attested in the contemporary sources. Anna Komnene gives this account of beast-shaped Greek fire projectors being mounted to the bow of warships:{{sfn|Dawes|1928|p=292}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;As he [the Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios I]]] knew that the [[Pisa]]ns were skilled in sea warfare and dreaded a battle with them, on the prow of each ship he had a head fixed of a lion or other land-animal, made in brass or iron with the mouth open and then gilded over, so that their mere aspect was terrifying. And the fire which was to be directed against the enemy through tubes he made to pass through the mouths of the beasts, so that it seemed as if the lions and the other similar monsters were vomiting the fire.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some sources provide more information on the composition and function of the whole mechanism. The Wolfenbüttel manuscript in particular provides the following description:{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=614–616}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;...having built a furnace right at the front of the ship, they set on it a copper vessel full of these things, having put fire underneath. And one of them, having made a bronze tube similar to that which the rustics call a ''squitiatoria'', "squirt," with which boys play, they spray [it] at the enemy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another, possibly first-hand, account of the use of Greek fire comes from the 11th-century ''[[Yngvars saga víðförla]]'', in which the [[Viking]] [[Ingvar the Far-Travelled]] faces ships equipped with Greek fire weapons:{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=616–617}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;[They] began blowing with smiths’ bellows at a furnace in which there was fire and there came from it a great din. There stood there also a brass [or bronze] tube and from it flew much fire against one ship, and it burned up in a short time so that all of it became white ashes...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The account, albeit embellished, corresponds with many of the characteristics of Greek fire known from other sources, such as a loud roar that accompanied its discharge.{{sfn|Ellis Davidson|1973|p=72}} These two texts are also the only two sources that explicitly mention that the substance was heated over a furnace before being discharged; although the validity of this information is open to question, modern reconstructions have relied upon them.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=628–629}}{{sfn|Haldon|2006|p=315}}

[[File:Greek Fire mechanism after Haldon and Byrne.jpg|thumb|left|Proposed reconstruction of the Greek fire mechanism by Haldon and Byrne]]
Based on these descriptions and the Byzantine sources, John Haldon and Maurice Byrne designed a hypothetical apparatus as consisting of three main components: a bronze pump, which was used to pressurize the oil; a brazier, used to heat the oil (πρόπυρον, ''propyron'', "pre-heater"); and the nozzle, which was covered in bronze and mounted on a swivel (στρεπτόν, ''strepton'').{{sfn|Haldon|Byrne|1977|p=93}} The brazier, burning a match of linen or flax that produced intense heat and the characteristic thick smoke, was used to heat oil and the other ingredients in an airtight tank above it,{{sfn|Haldon|Byrne|1977|p=94}} a process that also helped to dissolve the resins into a fluid mixture.{{sfn|Haldon|2006|p=310}} The substance was pressurized by the heat and the usage of a force pump. After it had reached the proper pressure, a valve connecting the tank with the swivel was opened and the mixture was discharged from its end, being ignited at its mouth by some source of flame.{{sfn|Haldon|Byrne|1977|p=95}} The intense heat of the flame made necessary the presence of heat shields made of iron (βουκόλια, ''boukolia''), which are attested in the fleet inventories.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=624–626}}

The process of operating Haldon and Byrne's design was fraught with danger, as the mounting pressure could easily make the heated oil tank explode, a flaw which was not recorded as a problem with the historical fire weapon.{{sfn|Haldon|Byrne|1977|p=96}}{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=627–628}} In the experiments conducted by Haldon in 2002 for the episode "Fireship" of the television series ''Machines Times Forgot'', even modern welding techniques failed to secure adequate insulation of the bronze tank under pressure. This led to the relocation of the pressure pump between the tank and the nozzle. The full-scale device built on this basis established the effectiveness of the mechanism's design, even with the simple materials and techniques available to the Byzantines. The experiment used crude oil mixed with wood resins, and achieved a flame temperature of over {{convert|1000|C}} and an effective range of up to {{convert|15|m|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed description, cf. {{harvnb|Haldon|2006|pp=297–315}} An interesting characteristic displayed during these tests was that, contrary to expectations due to the flame's heat, the stream of fire projected through the tube did not curve upwards but downwards, as the fuel was not completely vaporized as it left the nozzle. This fact is important because medieval galleys had a low profile, and a high-arcing flame would miss them entirely.{{harvnb|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hand-held projectors===
[[File:Hand-siphon for Greek fire, medieval illumination (detail).jpg|thumb|Detail of a ''cheirosiphōn'']]
The portable ''cheirosiphōn'' ("hand-''siphōn''"), the earliest analogue to a modern [[flamethrower]], is extensively attested in the military documents of the 10th century, and recommended for use in both sea and land. They first appear in the ''[[Tactica of Emperor Leo VI the Wise|Tactica]]'' of emperor [[Leo VI the Wise]], who claims to have invented them.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=617}} Subsequent authors continued to refer to the ''cheirosiphōnes'', especially for use against [[siege towers]], although [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] also advises their use in field armies, with the aim of disrupting the enemy formation.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=617–619}} Although both Leo VI and Nikephoros Phokas claim that the substance used in the ''cheirosiphōnes'' was the same as in the static devices used on ships, Haldon and Byrne consider that the former were manifestly different from their larger cousins, and theorize that the device was fundamentally different, "a simple syringe [that] squirted both liquid fire (presumably unignited) and noxious juices to repel enemy troops." The illustrations of Hero's ''Poliorcetica'' show the ''cheirosiphōn'' also throwing the ignited substance, {{sfn|Haldon|Byrne|1977|p=97}}{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=627}} but such illustrations were ''narrative'' in intent, so that showing the device throwing the ignited substance may have seemed preferable to trying to clearly illustrate throwing the unignited substance and then igniting it.

===Grenades===
[[Image:Liquid fire granades Chania.jpg|thumb|Ceramic grenades that were filled with Greek fire, surrounded by [[caltrop]]s, 10th–12th century, [[National Historical Museum (Greece)|National Historical Museum]], Athens, Greece]]
In its earliest form, Greek fire was hurled onto enemy forces by firing a burning cloth-wrapped ball, perhaps containing a flask, using a form of [[Catapult|light catapult]], most probably a seaborne variant of the Roman light catapult or [[onager (siege weapon)|onager]]. These were capable of hurling light loads, around {{convert|6|to|9|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, a distance of {{convert|350|-|450|m|yd|abbr=on}}.

==Effectiveness and countermeasures==
Although the destructiveness of Greek fire is indisputable, it did not make the [[Byzantine navy]] invincible. It was not, in the words of naval historian John Pryor, a "ship-killer" comparable to the [[naval ram]], which, by then, had fallen out of use.{{sfn|Pryor|2003|p=97}} While Greek fire remained a potent weapon, its limitations were significant when compared to more traditional forms of artillery: in its ''siphōn''-deployed version, it had a limited range, and it could be used safely only in a calm sea and with favourable wind conditions.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=384}}

The Muslim navies eventually adapted themselves to it by staying out of its effective range and devising methods of protection such as felt or hides soaked in vinegar.{{sfn|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=617}}

==In literature==
In [[C. J. Sansom]]'s historical mystery novel ''[[Dark Fire (Sansom novel)|Dark Fire]]'', [[Thomas Cromwell]] sends the lawyer [[Matthew Shardlake]] to recover the secret of Greek fire, following its discovery in the library of a dissolved London monastery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/06/featuresreviews.guardianreview22 A wherry across the Thames] The Guardian, 6 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Michael Crichton]]'s sci-fi novel ''[[Timeline (novel) |Timeline]]'', [[Timeline (novel)#Professor Edward Johnston|Professor Edward Johnston]] is stuck in the past in 14th century Europe, and claims to have knowledge of Greek fire.

In [[Mika Waltari]]'s novel ''[[The Dark Angel (novel) |The Dark Angel]]'', some old men who are the last ones who know the secret of Greek fire are mentioned as present in the last Christian services held in [[Hagia Sophia]] before the [[Fall of Constantinople]].  The narrator is told that in the event of the city's fall, they will be killed so as to keep the secret from the Turks.

In [[George R. R. Martin]]'s fantasy series of novels ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', and its adaptation ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', Wildfire is similar to Greek fire, it was used in naval battles as it could remain lit on water and it was an extremely secretive recipe and was protected immensely.

[[File:Hobcarts.jpg|right|thumb|300px|David Smith and John Casey using their Hobcarts in the late 1960s.]]
A '''hobcart''' was a type of [[mobility device]] designed in the late 1960s by Dr. Steven Perry of [[Albrighton, Bridgnorth|Albrighton]], [[Shropshire]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]. In his practice he had two young children, both of whom had [[spina bifida]]. He considered that the [[wheelchair]]s the children were provided with were liable to set them apart from other children of their age, so set about designing a mobility device, that would look like a [[go-kart]]. The end result was the hobcart, which when it was first made, was produced at a local [[borstal]]. The idea behind this was to try to provide the inmates of the borstal the opportunity to be involved in a project which they could see was doing some good. Hobcarts were still being made into the 1980s.

'''IEEE&amp;nbsp;488''' is a short-range digital communications [[8-bit]] [[parallel communication|parallel]] [[Multi-master bus|multi-master]] [[Interface (computing)|interface bus]] specification. IEEE&amp;nbsp;488 was created as '''HP-IB''' ('''Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus''') and is commonly called '''GPIB''' ('''General Purpose Interface Bus'''). It has been the subject of several [[#Standards|standards]].

Although originally created in the late 1960s to connect together [[automated test equipment]], it also had some success during the 1970s and 1980s as a [[peripheral bus]] for early [[microcomputer]]s, notably the [[Commodore PET]]. Newer standards have largely replaced IEEE&amp;nbsp;488 for computer use, but it still sees some use in the test equipment field.

==Origins==
In the late 1960s, [[Hewlett-Packard|Hewlett-Packard (HP)]]&lt;ref&gt;This part of HP was later (c. 1999) spun off as [[Agilent Technologies]], and in 2014 Agilent's test and measurement division was spun off as [[Keysight Technologies]].&lt;/ref&gt; manufactured various automated test and measurement instruments, such as digital [[multimeter]]s and [[logic analyzer]]s. They developed the ''HP Interface Bus (HP-IB)'' to enable easier interconnection between instruments and controllers (computers and other instruments).

The bus was relatively easy to implement using the technology at the time, using a simple parallel [[Bus (computing)|bus]] and several individual control lines. For example, the HP 59501 Power Supply Programmer and HP 59306A Relay Actuator were both relatively simple HP-IB peripherals implemented only in [[Transistor–transistor logic|TTL]], using no microprocessor.

HP licensed the HP-IB patents for a nominal fee to other manufacturers. It became known as the General Purpose Interface Bus (GPIB), and became a [[de facto standard]] for automated and industrial instrument control. As GPIB became popular, it was formalized by various [[standards organization]]s.

==Standards==
In 1975, the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] standardized the bus as ''Standard Digital Interface for Programmable Instrumentation'', '''IEEE&amp;nbsp;488'''; it was revised in 1978 (producing IEEE&amp;nbsp;488-1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=IEEE Standard Digital Interface for Programmable Instrumentation |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |year=1987 |id=ANSI/IEEE Std 488.1-1987 |isbn=0-471-62222-2 &lt;!-- This is the ISBN on the document --&gt; |doi= }}, p.&amp;nbsp;iii&lt;/ref&gt; The standard was revised in 1987, and redesignated as '''IEEE&amp;nbsp;488.1''' (IEEE&amp;nbsp;488.1-1987).  These standards formalized the mechanical, electrical, and basic protocol parameters of GPIB, but said nothing about the format of commands or data.

In 1987, IEEE introduced ''Standard Codes, Formats, Protocols, and Common Commands'', '''IEEE&amp;nbsp;488.2'''. It was revised in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=IEEE Standard Codes, Formats, Protocols, and Common Commands for Use With IEEE Std 488.1-1987, IEEE Standard Digital Interface for Programmable Instrumentation |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |year=1992 |id=IEEE Std 488.2-1992 |isbn=1-55937-238-9 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; IEEE&amp;nbsp;488.2 provided for basic syntax and format conventions, as well as device-independent commands, data structures, error protocols, and the like. IEEE&amp;nbsp;488.2 built on IEEE&amp;nbsp;488.1 without superseding it; equipment can conform to IEEE&amp;nbsp;488.1 without following IEEE&amp;nbsp;488.2.

While IEEE&amp;nbsp;488.1 defined the hardware and IEEE&amp;nbsp;488.2 defined the protocol, there was still no standard for instrument-specific commands. Commands to control the same class of instrument, ''e.g.'', multimeters, would vary between manufacturers and even models.

The United States Air Force,&lt;ref&gt;Project Mate in 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and later Hewlett-Packard, recognized this problem. In 1989, HP developed their TML language&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the forerunner to [[Standard Commands for Programmable Instrumentation]] (SCPI). SCPI was introduced as an industry standard in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|access-date=2010-02-06
}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCPI added standard generic commands, and a series of instrument classes with corresponding class-specific commands. SCPI mandated the IEEE&amp;nbsp;488.2 syntax, but allowed other (non-IEEE&amp;nbsp;488.1) physical transports.

The [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] developed their own standards in parallel with the IEEE, with '''IEC&amp;nbsp;60625-1''' and '''IEC&amp;nbsp;60625-2''' (IEC&amp;nbsp;625), later replaced by [[IEC&amp;nbsp;60488]].

[[National Instruments]] introduced a backward-compatible extension to IEEE&amp;nbsp;488.1, originally known as '''HS-488'''. It increased the maximum data rate to 8 [[megabyte|Mbyte]]/s, although the rate decreases as more devices are connected to the bus. This was incorporated into the standard in 2003 (IEEE&amp;nbsp;488.1-2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Characteristics ==
IEEE&amp;nbsp;488 is an [[8-bit]], electrically [[parallel communication|parallel]] bus. The bus employs sixteen signal lines — eight used for bi-directional data transfer, three for handshake, and five for bus management — plus eight ground return lines.

Every device on the bus has a unique 5-bit primary [[Physical address|address]], in the range from 0 to 30 (31 total possible addresses).&lt;ref name="NI-488.2"&gt;{{Cite book

The standard allows up to 15 devices to share a single physical bus of up to 20 meters total cable length. The physical topology can be linear or star (forked).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

|access-date=2010-02-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active extenders allow longer buses, with up to 31 devices theoretically possible on a logical bus.

Control and data transfer functions are logically separated; a controller can address one device as a "talker" and one or more devices as "listeners" without having to participate in the data transfer. It is possible for multiple controllers to share the same bus; but only one can be the "Controller In Charge" at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the original protocol, transfers use an interlocked, three-wire ''ready–valid–accepted'' [[handshaking|handshake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

IEEE&amp;nbsp;488 specifies a 24-pin [[Amphenol]]-designed [[micro ribbon]] connector. Micro ribbon connectors have a D-shaped metal shell, but are larger than [[D-subminiature]] connectors. They are sometimes called "Centronics connectors" after the 36-pin [[micro ribbon]] connector [[Centronics]] used for their printers.

One unusual feature of IEEE&amp;nbsp;488 connectors is they commonly use a "double-headed" design, with male on one side, and female on the other. This allows stacking connectors for easy [[daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy-chaining]]. Mechanical considerations limit the number of stacked connectors to four or fewer, although a workaround involving physically supporting the connectors may be able to get around this.

They are held in place by screws, either [[Unified Thread Standard|UTS]] (now largely obsolete) or [[ISO metric screw thread|metric]] M3.5×0.6 [[screw thread|thread]]s. Early versions of the standard suggested that metric screws should be blackened to avoid confusion with the incompatible UTS threads.  However, by the 1987 revision this was no longer considered necessary because of the prevalence of metric threads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=IEEE Standard Digital Interface for Programmable Instrumentation |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |year=1987 |id=ANSI/IEEE Std 488.1-1987 |isbn=0-471-62222-2|page=v|quote=The "helpful note" on metric threads found in previous editions has been deleted since metric thread use is common IEEE 488 practice. Consequently, the recommendation to coat such parts in black material to call attention to metric threads is also considered unnecessary.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IEC&amp;nbsp;60625 standard prescribes the use of 25-pin [[D-subminiature]] connectors (the same as used for the [[parallel port]] on [[IBM PC compatible|IBM-PC]]s). This connector did not gain significant market acceptance against the established 24-pin connector.

==Use as a computer interface==

HP's designers did not specifically plan for IEEE&amp;nbsp;488 to be a peripheral interface for general-purpose computers; the focus was on instrumentation. But when HP's early [[microcomputer]]s needed an interface for peripherals ([[disk drive]]s, [[tape drive]]s, [[computer printer|printers]], [[plotter]]s, etc.), HP-IB was readily available and easily adapted to the purpose.

HP computer products which used HP-IB included the [[HP series 80]], [[HP 9800 series]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; HP computer peripherals which did not utilize the RS-232 communication interface often used HP-IB including disc systems like the [[HP 7935]]. Some of HP's advanced pocket calculators of the 1980s, such as the [[HP-41]] and [[HP-71B]] series, also had IEEE&amp;nbsp;488 capabilities, via an optional [[HP-IL]]/HP-IB interface module.

Other manufacturers adopted GPIB for their computers as well, such as with the [[Tektronix 405x]] line.

The [[Commodore PET]] (introduced 1977) range of personal computers connected their peripherals using the IEEE&amp;nbsp;488 bus, but with a non-standard card edge connector. Commodore's following 8-bit machines utilized a serial bus whose protocol was based on IEEE&amp;nbsp;488.&lt;ref&gt;Bagnall, Brian (2006). ''On the Edge: The Spectacular Rise and Fall of Commodore'', Variant Press. Page 221. {{ISBN|0-9738649-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Commodore marketed an IEEE&amp;nbsp;488 cartridge for the VIC-20 &lt;ref&gt;Commodore drawing for VIC-1112 - Drawing no. 1110010 Rev:A&lt;/ref&gt; and the Commodore 64 ([http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/schematics/cartridges/c64/ieee-488/index.html Reverse-engineered schematics for Commodore C64 IEEE interface]). Several third party suppliers of [[Commodore 64 peripherals]] made a cartridge for the C64 that provided an IEEE&amp;nbsp;488-derived interface on a card edge connector similar to that of the PET series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/schematics/cartridges/c64/ieee-488/index.html Link to schematic for one such converter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, faster, more complete standards such as [[SCSI]] superseded IEEE&amp;nbsp;488 for peripheral access.

== Comparison with other interface standards ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}

Electrically, IEEE&amp;nbsp;488 used a hardware interface that could be implemented with some discrete logic or with a microcontroller. The hardware interface enabled devices made by different manufacturers to communicate with a single host. Since each device generated the asynchronous handshaking signals required by the bus protocol, slow and fast devices could be mixed on one bus. The data transfer is relatively slow, so [[transmission line]] issues such as impedance matching and line termination are ignored. There was no requirement for [[galvanic isolation]] between the bus and devices, which created the possibility of [[Ground loop (electricity)|ground loops]] causing extra noise and loss of data.

Physically, the IEEE&amp;nbsp;488 connectors and cabling were rugged and held in place by screws. While physically large and sturdy connectors were an advantage in industrial or laboratory set ups, the size and cost of the connectors was a liability in applications such as personal computers.

Although the electrical and physical interfaces were well defined, there was not an initial standard command set. Devices from different manufacturers might use different commands for the same function.&lt;ref&gt;Early devices might respond to an &lt;code&gt;ID&lt;/code&gt; command with an identification string; later standards had devices respond to the &lt;code&gt;*ID&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/ref&gt; Some aspects of the command protocol standards were not standardized until [[Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments]] (SCPI) in 1990.  Implementation options (e.g. end of transmission handling) can complicate interoperability in pre-IEEE&amp;nbsp;488.2 devices.

More recent standards such as [[USB]], [[FireWire]], and [[Ethernet]] take advantage of declining costs of interface electronics to implement more complex standards providing higher bandwidth. The multi-conductor (parallel data) connectors and shielded cable were inherently more costly than the connectors and cabling that could be used with serial data transfer standards such as [[RS-232]], [[RS-485]], USB, FireWire or Ethernet. Very few mass-market personal computers or peripherals (such as printers or scanners) implemented IEEE&amp;nbsp;488.

'''Interstellar Probe''' is the name of a 1999 space probe concept by [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] intended to travel out 200&amp;nbsp;AU in 15 years.&lt;ref name="ipjpl" /&gt; This 1999 study by [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) is noted for its circular 400 meters diameter, [[solar sail]] as a propulsion method (1 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) combined with a 0.25 AU flyby of the Sun to achieve higher solar light pressure, after which the sail is jettisoned at 5 AU distance from the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/read/11135/chapter/6#31|title=4 An Interstellar Probe to the Boundaries of the Heliosphere and Nearby Interstellar Space - Exploration of the Outer Heliosphere and the Local Interstellar Medium: A Workshop Report - The National Academies Press|publisher=|doi=10.17226/11135}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Solar sail==
Solar sails work by converting the energy in light into a momentum on the spacecraft, thus propelling the spacecraft.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18141-propelled-by-light-the-promise-and-perils-of-solar-sailing/|title=Propelled by light: the promise and perils of solar sailing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Felix Tisserand noted the effect of light pressure on comet tails in the 1800s.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

The study by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, proposed using a solar sail to accelerate a spacecraft to reach the [[interstellar medium]]. It was planned to reach as far as 200 AU within 10 years at a speed of 14 AU/year (about 70&amp;nbsp;km/s, and function up to 400+ AU.&lt;ref name=ipjpl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://interstellar.jpl.nasa.gov/interstellar/probe/index.html |title=Interstellar Probe |publisher=Interstellar.jpl.nasa.gov |date=2002-02-05 |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A critical technology for the mission is a large 1 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; solar sail.&lt;ref name=ipjpl/&gt; 
{{pquote|This great journey requires advanced propulsion, and the 200-kg Interstellar Probe is designed to use a 200-m radius solar sail to achieve a velocity of 14 AU/year. After exiting the heliosphere within a decade of launch, it would be capable of continuing on to ~400 AU. Interstellar Probe would serve as the first step in a more ambitious program to explore the outer solar system and nearby galactic neighborhood.|Interstellar Probe, 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interstellar.jpl.nasa.gov/interstellar/probe/introduction/intro.html|title=NASA IP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the following years there were additional studies, including the [[Innovative Interstellar Explorer]] (published 2003), which focused on a design using RTGs powering an ion engine rather than a solar sail. Another project in this field for advanced spaceflight during this period was the [[Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program]] which ran from 1996 through 2002.

Later examples of solar sail-propelled spacecraft include [[IKAROS]], Nanosail-D2, and [[LightSail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/lightsail-space-mission-will-shine-global-spotlight-solar-sails-n361601|title=LightSail Space Mission Will Shine Global Spotlight on Solar Sails|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Near-Earth Asteroid Scout]] is a planned light sail-propelled mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/nea-scout.htm|title=NEA-Scout|website=space.skyrocket.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, the LightSail spacecraft uses a sail 5 micron in thickness, whereas they predict a sail with 1 micron thickness would be needed for interstellar travel.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"/&gt;

==Other design features==
The probe would use an advanced [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] (RTG) for electrical power, [[Ka band]] radio for communication with Earth, a [[Delta 2]] rocket for Earth launch, and a 25&amp;nbsp;kg instrument package using 20 watts.&lt;ref name=ipjpl/&gt;

==Objectives==

The '''L Prize''' (aka the '''Bright Tomorrow Lighting Prize''') is a competition run by the [[United States Department of Energy]] aimed to "spur lighting manufacturers to develop high-quality, high-efficiency [[solid-state lighting]] products to replace the common [[incandescent light bulb]]".&lt;ref name="Lsite"&gt;[http://www.lightingprize.org/index.stm www.lightingprize.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The competition, launched in May 2008 [http://www.lightingprize.org/lightfair08.stm at Lightfair], offers two prizes for the replacement of two types of bulb, an [[A19 light bulb|A19]] 60-watt incandescent light bulb and a [[PAR 38]] [[Halogen lamp|halogen]] incandescent bulb. The prize fund for the 60&amp;nbsp;W replacement is up to a maximum of [[United States dollar|US$]]10 million and for the PAR 38 up to US$5 million.&lt;ref name="Require"&gt;[http://www.lightingprize.org/pdfs/LPrize-Revision1.pdf LPrize-Revision1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
There is a third category, yet to be publicly defined, called the 21st-century lamp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightingprize.org/requirements.stm L-Prize Requirements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506170912/http://www.lightingprize.org/requirements.stm |date=2011-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The competition has set out various qualifying requirements for the replacement bulbs summarized in the table below:

==Winner==
It was announced on 3 August 2011, that the winner of the 60 W replacement bulb competition was a bulb made by [[Philips]].&lt;ref name="philwin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightingprize.org/philips-winner.stm |title=DOE Announces Philips as First Winner of the L Prize Competition |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60jS9wT6Q?url=http://www.lightingprize.org/philips-winner.stm |archivedate= 6 August 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philwinPDF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightingprize.org/pdfs/LPrize-winner_media-kit.pdf |title=LPrize-winner_media-kit.pdf |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60jSDijaj?url=http://www.lightingprize.org/pdfs/LPrize-winner_media-kit.pdf |archivedate= 6 August 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The winning bulb was a [[LED lamp]] using less than 10 watts and emitting the equivalent amount of light as a traditional 60-watt incandescent bulb. That amounts to an 83% energy savings. It was announced that Philips would be given the US$10 million cash prize.&lt;ref name="philwin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="philwinPDF" /&gt; The bulb was released commercially in February 2012 through several online sellers. The widespread launch at retail stores, however, was not until [[Earth Day]], April 22.&lt;ref name=philipscatalog&gt;{{cite web|title=Award Winning LED Bulb|url=http://www.usa.ecat.lighting.philips.com/l/professional-lamps/led-lighting-systems/led-bulb/62693/cat/|work=Philips Lighting Catalog|publisher=Philips|accessdate=8 February 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121217165422/http://www.usa.ecat.lighting.philips.com/l/professional-lamps/led-lighting-systems/led-bulb/62693/cat/#|archive-date=2012-12-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the subsidized price was expected to be $22 in the first year, $15 in the second and $8 in the third, the bulb was initially selling for $50–$60 (without rebates) as of July 2012. As of March, 2013 Home Depot began offering the bulbs for $15 in stores.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.homedepot.com/buy/philips-10-watt-60w-led-a19-soft-white-2700k-light-bulb-e-l-prize-award-winner--423244.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many stores sold out, and according to Philips customer service the L-prize bulb has been discontinued.

===Technology===

The winning bulb is able to achieve all of the required specifications by using red and blue LEDs that excite yellow phosphors, which emits the required color of light. This is in contrast to most other LED lights, which use white LEDs to emit light that lacks all of the required characteristics for the L-Prize.

===PAR 38 floodlight===
The rules for the PAR 38 lightbulb competition were retooled in July, 2012, keeping the same main specifications. As of June 13, 2014, the competition has been suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lightingprize.org/PAR38.stm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217021220/http://www.lightingprize.org/PAR38.stm |archivedate=2015-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st Century Lamp===
On August 1, 2011, [[Cree_Inc.|Cree]] announced that they had created a bulb that would exceed the DOE specifications for a 21st-century lamp. It emitted 1,300 lumens at 152 lumens per watt with a CRI of 91.2 and a color temperature of 2800 K.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cree.com/news-and-events/cree-news/press-releases/2011/august/110801-21st-century-lamp&lt;/ref&gt; They also stated at the time that they would not be bringing the bulb to market. As of March, 2013 they had not brought the bulb or any bulb like it to market.

"[[Fun Dip]]" is a type of [[candy]] in the United States, where a solid candy "dipping stick" is used to convey flavored sugar to the eater's mouth. The dipper is first licked to provide moisture, and then dredged through a small pouch with the flavored sugar, so that the sugar sticks to the dipping stick.

Some single-serve ice cream is sold with a flat wooden spade, often erroneously called a "spoon", to lift the product to one's mouth.

Prepackaged tuna salad or cracker snacks may contain a flat plastic spade for similar purposes.

'''London Decca''' is a manufacturer of [[phonograph]] tonearms and [[Magnetic cartridge|pick-up cartridges]]. The London Decca cartridges may be unique in that they do not employ a "proper" cantilever, neither are they "moving magnet" (MM) nor "moving coil" (MC) designs. These products are critically acclaimed for their sonic detail.

'''Meal powder''' is the fine dust left over when [[black powder]] ([[gunpowder]]) is corned and screened to separate it into different grain sizes.  It is used extensively in various [[pyrotechnic]] procedures, usually to prime other compositions.  It can also be used in many [[fireworks]] to add power and substantially increasing the height of the firework. It is also used in most [[firearm]] ammunition.

'Mill meal' powder is a mixture of [[potassium nitrate]], [[charcoal]] and [[sulfur]] in the correct proportions (75% potassium nitrate:15% charcoal:10% sulfur) which has been ball-milled to mix it intimately.  It is used in the same way as commercial meal powder or can be pressed and corned to produce true black powder.

To make meal powder or black powder, a chemist mixes the ingredients by mass, never by volume. These ingredients are processed in a [[ball mill]], basically a spinning drum with non-sparking ceramic or lead balls. The more time left in the mill, the more "explosive" the powder will be. One main reason to ball mill as opposed to other methods is because it presses sulfur and KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; into the porous charcoal.

'''MySensors''' is a [[free and open source]] DIY ([[Do it yourself|do-it yourself]]) software framework for [[wireless]] IoT ([[Internet of things|Internet of Things]]) devices allowing devices to communicate using [[Transmitter|radio transmitters]]. The library was originally developed for the [[Arduino]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Vivek S.|year=2015|title=Low Cost Standard Internet of Things|url=http://ijesat.org/Volumes/2015_Vol_05_Iss_02/IJESAT_2015_05_02_07.pdf|journal=International Journal of Engineering Science &amp; Advanced Technology|volume=05|pages=17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emre|first=Ünsal|year=2016|title=LOW COST WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS FOR ENVIRONMENT MONITORING|url=http://www.tojsat.net/journals/tojsat/volumes/tojsat-volume06-i02.pdf#page=70|journal=The Online Journal of Science and Technology|volume=6|pages=64|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|degree=M.Sc.|last= Ramljak|first= Dario|date=2015|title=Sustav nadzora kvalitete zraka u zatvorenim prostorima koristeći bežične senzorske mreže|publisher=University of Zagreb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282855975_Design_of_a_Low_Cost_Multipurpose_Wireless_Sensor_Network |title=Design of a Low Cost Multipurpose Wireless Sensor Network|last1=Guarnieri Calò Carducci|first1=Carlo|date=2015|location=Coimbra, Portugal|conference=IEEE International Workshop on Measurement and Networking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MySensors devices create a virtual radio network of nodes that automatically forms a self healing mesh like structure. Each node can relay messages for other nodes to cover greater distances using simple short range transceivers. Each node can have several sensors or actuators attached and can interact with other nodes in the network.

The radio network can consist of up to 254 nodes where one node can act as a gateway to the internet or a home automation controller. The controller adds functionality to the radio network such as id assignment and time awareness.

== Supported hardware platforms ==

The framework can natively be run on the following platforms and [[Microcontroller|micro controllers]]. 
* [[Linux]] / [[Raspberry Pi]]
* [[ATmega328|ATMega 328P]]
* [[ESP8266]] 
* [[ARM Cortex-M|ARM Cortex M0]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/mysensors/ArduinoHwSAMD|title=mysensors/ArduinoHwSAMD|website=GitHub|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (mainly Atmel SAMD core as used in Arduino Zero)

== Communication options ==

MySensors supports over-the-air communication using the following transceivers:
* NRF24L01
* RFM69
* RFM95 ([[LPWAN|LoRa]])
* WiFi (ESP8266)
Wired communication over:
* [[MQTT]] 
* [[USB|Serial USB]] 
* [[RS-485|RS485]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mysensors.org/build/rs485|title=Building a wired RS485 sensor network {{!}} MySensors - Create your own Connected Home Experience|last=hek|website=MySensors|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Security ==

The wireless communication can be signed using truncated [[HMAC-SHA256]] either through hardware with [http://www.atmel.com Atmel] [http://www.atmel.com/devices/ATSHA204A.aspx ATSHA204A] or compatible software emulation and optionally encrypted. The implementation is timing neutral with [[Software whitening|whitened]] random numbers, attack detection-and-lockout and protects against [[timing attacks]], [[replay attack|replay attacks]] and [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man in the middle attacks]].

== Over the air firmware updates ==

The [[firmware]] of a MySensor node can be updated over the air using a few different bootloader options:
* In place overwriting of flash memory using MySensorsBootloaderRF24.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/mysensors/MySensorsBootloaderRF24|title=mysensors/MySensorsBootloaderRF24|website=GitHub|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Using external flash with the DualOptiBoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/mysensors/DualOptiboot|title=mysensors/DualOptiboot|website=GitHub|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For ESP8266 nodes using  the built in OTA feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://esp8266.github.io/Arduino/versions/2.0.0/doc/ota_updates/ota_updates.html|title=OTA Update · ESP8266 Arduino Core|website=esp8266.github.io|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NFPA 921''', "Guide for Fire and Explosion Investigations", is a peer reviewed document that is published by the [[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA).   Its purpose is "to establish guidelines and recommendations for the safe and systematic investigation or analysis of fire and explosion incidents" (section 1.2.1). Familiarity with NFPA 921 is strongly recommended by [[National Association of Fire Investigators]] and the [[International Association of Arson Investigators]] (IAAI). NFPA 921 forms a large basis of the information which a professional fire investigator must know to pass the various Fire Investigator Certification (NAFI and IAAI) examinations.

While not every recommendation in NFPA 921 will apply to any particular fire or explosion investigation, the document itself recommends that if a particular fire investigator does not apply certain sections to an investigation where they are called-for, the investigator must be prepared to justify the exclusion.

This standard was long resisted in legal circles, with civil and criminal [[arson]] investigations leading to convictions later proven wrongful,&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/judge-bad-science-led-murder-arson-sentence-144735103.html&lt;/ref&gt; such as that of [[Cameron Todd Willingham]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24073">'''Passive cooling''' is a building design approach that focuses on heat gain control and heat dissipation in a building in order to improve the indoor [[thermal comfort]] with low or no energy consumption.&lt;ref name=santamouris&gt;{{cite book|last=Santamouris|first=M.|last2=Asimakoupolos|first2=D.|title=Passive cooling of buildings|year=1996|publisher=James &amp; James (Science Publishers) Ltd|location=35-37 William Road, London NW1 3ER, UK|isbn=978-1-873936-47-4|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=samuel&gt;{{cite journal|first=D.G.|last=Leo Samuel|first2=S.M.|last2=Shiva Nagendra|first3=M.P.|last3=Maiya|title=Passive alternatives to mechanical air conditioning of building: A review|journal=Building and Environment|date=August 2013|volume=66|pages=54–64|doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.04.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach works either by preventing heat from entering the interior (heat gain prevention) or by removing heat from the building (natural cooling).&lt;ref&gt;Limb M.J., 1998: "[http://www.aivc.org/resource/bib-08-annotated-bibliography-passive-cooling-technology-office-buildings-hot-dry-and Passive Cooling Technologies for office buildings. An Annotated Bibliography]". [[Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre|Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre (AIVC)]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Natural cooling utilizes on-site energy, available from the natural environment, combined with the architectural design of building components (e.g. [[building envelope]]), rather than mechanical systems to dissipate heat.&lt;ref name=niles&gt;{{cite book|last=Niles|first=Philip|last2=Kenneth|first2=Haggard|title=Passive Solar Handbook|year=1980|publisher= California Energy Resources Conservation|asin=B001UYRTMM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, natural cooling depends not only on the architectural design of the building but on how the site's natural resources are used as [[heat sink]]s (i.e. everything that absorbs or dissipates heat). Examples of on-site heat sinks are the upper atmosphere (night sky), the outdoor air (wind), and the earth/soil.

==Overview==
Passive cooling covers all natural processes and techniques of heat dissipation and modulation without the use of energy.&lt;ref name=santamouris /&gt; Some authors consider that minor and simple mechanical systems (e.g. [[heat pump|pumps]] and economizers) can be integrated in passive cooling techniques, as long they are used to enhance the effectiveness of the natural cooling process.&lt;ref name=givoni1&gt;{{cite book|last=Givoni|first=Baruch|title=Passive and Low Energy Cooling of Buildings|year=1994|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=605 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10158-0012, USA|isbn=978-0-471-28473-4|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such applications are also called ‘hybrid cooling systems’.&lt;ref name=santamouris /&gt; The techniques for passive cooling can be grouped in two main categories:

*'''Preventive techniques''' that aims to provide protection and/or prevention of external and internal heat gains.
*'''Modulation''' and '''heat dissipation techniques''' allow the building to store and dissipate heat gain through the transfer of heat from heat sinks to the climate. This technique can be the result of [[thermal mass]] or natural cooling.

==Preventive techniques==
Protection from or prevention of heat gains encompasses all the design techniques that minimizes the impact of [[solar gain|solar heat gains]] through the building’s envelope and of internal heat gains that is generated inside the building due occupancy and equipment. It includes the following design techniques:&lt;ref name=santamouris /&gt;

*'''Microclimate and site design''' - By taking into account the local climate and the site context, specific cooling strategies can be selected to apply which are the most appropriate for preventing overheating through the envelope of the building.  The microclimate can play a huge role in determining the most favorable building location by analyzing the combined availability of sun and wind. The bioclimatic chart, the solar diagram and the wind rose are relevant analysis tools in the application of this technique.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=G.Z.|last2=DeKay|first2=Mark|title=Sun, wind, and light: architectural design strategies|year=2001|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=605 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10158-0012, USA|isbn=978-0-471-34877-1|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Solar control''' - A properly designed shading system can effectively contribute to minimizing the [[solar heat gain]]s. Shading both transparent and opaque surfaces of the building envelope will minimize the amount of [[sunlight|solar radiation]] that induces overheating in both indoor spaces and building’s structure. By shading the building structure, the heat gain captured through the windows and envelope will be reduced.
*'''Building form and layout''' - Building orientation and an optimized distribution of interior spaces can prevent overheating. Rooms can be zoned within the buildings in order to reject sources of internal heat gain and/or allocating heat gains where they can be useful, considering the different activities of the building. For example, creating a flat, horizontal plan will increase the effectiveness of cross-ventilation across the plan. Locating the zones vertically can take advantage of temperature stratification. Typically, building zones in the upper levels are warmer than the lower zones due to stratification. Vertical zoning of spaces and activities uses this temperature stratification to accommodate zone uses according to their temperature requirements.&lt;ref name=brown /&gt; Form factor (i.e. the ratio between volume and surface) also plays a major role in the building’s energy and thermal profile. This ratio can be used to shape the building form to the specific local climate. For example, more compact forms tend to preserve more heat than less compact forms because the ratio of the internal loads to envelope area is significant.&lt;ref name=caldas1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caldas|first=L.|title=Generation of energy-efficient architecture solutions applying GENE_ARCH: An evolution-based generative design system|journal=Advanced Engineering Informatics|date=January 2008|volume=22|issue=1|pages=54–64|doi=10.1016/j.aei.2007.08.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=caldas2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caldas|first=L.|last2=Santos|first2=L.|title=Generation of energy-efficient patio houses with GENE_ARCH: combining an evolutionary Generative Design System with a Shape Grammar|journal=Proceedings of the 30th ECAADe Conference - Digital Physicality|date=September 2012|volume=1|series=eCAADe|pages=459–470|url=http://cumincad.architexturez.net/system/files/pdf/ecaade2012_267.content.pdf|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Thermal insulation]]''' - Insulation in the building’s envelope will decrease the amount of heat transferred by [[radiation]] through the facades. This principle applies both to the opaque (walls and roof) and transparent surfaces (windows) of the envelope. Since roofs could be a larger contributor to the interior heat load, especially in lighter constructions (e.g. building and workshops with roof made out of metal structures), providing thermal insulation can effectively decrease heat transfer from the roof.
*'''Behavioral and occupancy patterns''' - Some building management policies such as limiting the number of people in a given area of the building can also contribute effectively to the minimization of heat gains inside a building. Building occupants can also contribute to indoor overheating prevention by: shutting off the lights and equipment of unoccupied spaces, operating shading when necessary to reduce solar heat gains through windows, or dress lighter in order to adapt better to the indoor environment by increasing their thermal comfort tolerance.
*'''Internal gain control''' - More energy-efficient lighting and electronic equipment tend to release less energy thus contributing to less internal heat loads inside the space.

==Modulation and heat dissipation techniques==
The modulation and heat dissipation techniques rely on natural heat sinks to store and remove the internal heat gains. Examples of natural sinks are night sky, earth soil, and building mass.&lt;ref name=lechner&gt;{{cite book|last=Lechner|first=Norbert|title=Heating,Cooling, Lighting: sustainable design methods for architects|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=605 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10158-0012, USA|isbn=978-0-470-04809-2|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, passive cooling techniques that use heat sinks can act to either modulate heat gain with [[thermal mass]] or dissipate heat through natural cooling strategies.&lt;ref name=santamouris /&gt;
* '''Thermal mass - '''Heat gain modulation of an indoor space can be achieved by the proper use of the building’s thermal mass as a heat sink. The thermal mass will absorb and store heat during daytime hours and return it to the space at a later time.&lt;ref name="santamouris" /&gt; Thermal mass can be coupled with night ventilation natural cooling strategy if the stored heat that will be delivered to the space during the evening/night is not desirable.
* '''Natural cooling''' - Natural cooling refers to the use of ventilation or natural heat sinks for heat dissipation from indoor spaces. Natural cooling can be separated into five categories different categories: ventilation, night flushing, [[radiative cooling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hossain|first=Md Muntasir|last2=Gu|first2=Min|date=2016-02-04|title=Radiative cooling: Principles, progress and potentials|journal=Advanced Science|language=en|volume=3|issue=7|pages=1500360|doi=10.1002/advs.201500360|pmid=27812478|pmc=5067572|issn=2198-3844}}&lt;/ref&gt; evaporative cooling, and [[Ground-coupled heat exchanger|earth coupling]].

=== Ventilation===
Ventilation as a natural cooling strategy uses the physical properties of air to remove heat or provide cooling to occupants.  In select cases, ventilation can be used to cool the building structure, which subsequently may serve as a heat sink.

*'''Cross ventilation''' - The strategy of cross ventilation relies on wind to pass through the building for the purpose of cooling the occupants. Cross ventilation requires openings on two sides of the space, called the inlet and outlet. The sizing and placement of the ventilation inlets and outlets will determine the direction and velocity of cross ventilation through the building. Generally, an equal (or greater) area of outlet openings must also be provided to provide adequate cross ventilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grondzik|first=Walter T.|last2=Kwok|first2=Alison G.|last3=Stein|first3=Benjamim|last4=Reynolds|first4=John S.|title=Mechanical and Electrical Equipment For Building|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=

*'''Stack ventilation''' - Cross ventilation is an effective cooling strategy, however, wind is an unreliable resource. [[stack effect|Stack ventilation]] is an alternative design strategy that relies on the buoyancy of warm air to rise and exit through openings located at ceiling height. Cooler outside air replaces the rising warm air through carefully designed inlets placed near the floor.

One specific application of natural ventilation is night flushing.

=== Night flushing ===
Night flushing (also known as night ventilation, night cooling, night purging, or nocturnal convective cooling) is a passive or semi-passive cooling strategy that requires increased air movement at night to cool the structural elements of a building.&lt;ref name=Blondeau&gt;{{cite journal|first=Patrice|last=Blondeau|first2=Maurice|last2=Sperandio|first3=Francis|last3=Allard|title=Night ventilation for building cooling in summer|journal=Solar Energy|date=1997|volume=61|issue=5|pages=327–335|doi=10.1016/S0038-092X(97)00076-5|accessdate=11 November 2015|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X97000765}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heiselberg&gt;{{cite journal|first=Nikolai|last=Artmann|first2=Heinrich|last2=Manz|first3=Per Kvols|last3=Heiselberg|title=Climatic potential for passive cooling of buildings by night-time ventilation in Europe|journal=Applied Energy|date=February 2007|volume=84|issue=2|pages=187–201|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2006.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[free cooling]], which assists in chilling water, night flushing cools down the [[thermal mass]]. To execute night flushing, the building envelope typically stays closed during the day, causing excess heat gains to be stored in the building's thermal mass. The building structure acts as a sink through the day and absorbs heat gains from occupants, equipment, solar radiation, and conduction through walls, roofs, and ceilings. At night, when the outside air is cooler and not too humid, the envelope is opened, allowing cooler air to pass through the building so the stored heat can be dissipated by convection.&lt;ref name=SW&amp;L&gt;{{cite book |last=DeKay |first=Mark |last2=Brown |first2=Charlie |date= December 2013 |title=Sun, Wind, and Light: Architectural Design Strategies |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vMVFp_7zlaIC&amp;pg=PR3|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-118-33288-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process reduces the temperature of the indoor air and of the building's thermal mass, allowing convective, conductive, and [[radiant cooling]] to take place during the day when the building is occupied.&lt;ref name=Blondeau /&gt; Night flushing is most effective in climates with a large diurnal swing, i.e. a large difference between the daily maximum and minimum outdoor temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Givoni|first=Baruch|title=Performance and applicability of passive and low-energy cooling systems|journal=Energy and Buildings|year=1991|volume=17|issue=3|pages=177–199|doi=10.1016/0378-7788(91)90106-D}}&lt;/ref&gt; For optimal performance, the nighttime outdoor air temperature should fall below the daytime comfort zone limits of {{convert|22|C|F}} and 60% relative humidity.&lt;ref name=Autodesk&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sustainabilityworkshop.autodesk.com/buildings/night-purge-ventilation |title= Night-Purge Ventilation|website= Autodesk Sustainability Workshop|publisher= Autodesk Education Community|access-date=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the night flushing strategy to be effective at reducing indoor temperature and energy usage, the thermal mass must be sized sufficiently and distributed over a wide enough surface area to absorb the space's daily heat gains. Also, the total air change rate must be high enough to remove the internal heat gains from the space at night.&lt;ref name=SW&amp;L /&gt;&lt;ref name=MEEB&gt;{{cite book |last=Grondzik |first=Walter |last2=Kwok |first2=Alison |last3=Stein |first3=Benjamin |last4=Reynolds |first4=John |date= January 2011 |title=Mechanical and Electrical Equipment for Buildings |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-118-03940-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are three ways night flushing can be achieved in a building:
*'''Natural night flushing''' by opening windows at night, letting wind-driven or buoyancy-driven airflow cool the space, and then closing windows during the day.&lt;ref name=Herkel&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jens|last=Pfafferott|first2=Sebastian|last2=Herkel|first3=Martina|last3=Jaschke|title=Design of passive cooling by night ventilation: evaluation of a parametric model and building simulation with measurements|journal=Energy and Buildings|date=December 2003|volume=35|issue=11|pages=1129–1143|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2003.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Mechanical night flushing''' by forcing air mechanically through ventilation ducts at night at a high airflow rate and supplying air to the space during the day at a code-required minimum airflow rate.&lt;ref name=Heiselberg /&gt;
*'''Mixed-mode night flushing''' through a combination of [[natural ventilation]] and [[mechanical ventilation]], also known as [[mixed-mode ventilation]], by using fans to assist the natural nighttime airflow.
There are numerous benefits to using night flushing as a cooling strategy for buildings, including improved comfort and a shift in peak energy load.&lt;ref name=capeluto&gt;{{cite journal|first=Edna|last=Shaviv|first2=Abraham|last2=Yezioro|first3=Isaac|last3=Capeluto|title=Thermal mass and night ventilation as passive cooling design strategy|journal=Renewable Energy|date=2001|volume=24|issue=3–4|pages=445–452|doi=10.1016/s0960-1481(01)00027-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Energy is most expensive during the day. By implementing night flushing, the usage of mechanical ventilation is reduced during the day, leading to energy and money savings.

There are also a number of limitations to using night flushing, such as usability, security, reduced indoor air quality, and poor room acoustics. For natural night flushing, the process of manually opening and closing windows every day can be tiresome, especially in the presence of insect screens. This problem can be eased with automated windows or ventilation louvers, such as in the [[Manitoba Hydro Place]]. Natural night flushing also requires windows to be open at night when the building is most likely unoccupied, which can raise security issues. If outdoor air is polluted, night flushing can expose occupants to harmful conditions inside the building. In loud city locations, the opening of windows can create poor acoustical conditions inside the building.

=== Radiative cooling ===
All objects constantly emit and absorb radiant energy. An object will cool by radiation if the net flow is outward, which is the case during the night. At night, the long-wave radiation from the clear sky is less than the long-wave infrared radiation emitted from a building, thus there is a net flow to the sky. Since the roof provides the greatest surface visible to the night sky, designing the roof to act as a radiator is an effective strategy. There are two types of [[radiative cooling]] strategies that utilize the roof surface: direct and indirect:&lt;ref name=lechner/&gt;
*'''Direct radiant cooling''' - In a building designed to optimize direct radiation cooling, the building roof acts as a heat sink to absorb the daily internal loads. The roof acts as the best heat sink because it is the greatest surface exposed to the night sky. Radiate heat transfer with the night sky will remove heat from the building roof, thus cooling the building structure. Roof ponds are an example of this strategy. The roof pond design became popular with the development of the Sky thermal system designed by Harold Hay in 1977. There are various designs and configurations for the roof pond system but the concept is the same for all designs. The roof uses water, either plastic bags filled with water or an open pond, as the heat sink while a system of movable insulation panels regulate the mode of heating or cooling. During daytime in the summer, the water on the roof is protected from the solar radiation and ambient air temperature by movable insulation, which allows it to serve as a heat sink and absorb the heat generated inside through the ceiling. At night, the panels are retracted to allow nocturnal radiation between the roof pond and the night sky, thus removing the stored heat. In winter, the process is reversed so that the roof pond is allowed to absorb solar radiation during the day and release it during the night into the space below.&lt;ref name=givoni1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharifi|first1=Ayyoob|last2=Yamagata|first2=Yoshiki|title=Roof ponds as passive heating and cooling systems: A systematic review|journal=Applied Energy|date=December 2015|volume=160|pages=336–357|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.09.061}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Indirect radiant cooling''' - A heat transfer fluid removes heat from the building structure through radiate heat transfer with the night sky. A common design for this strategy involves a plenum between the building roof and the radiator surface. Air is drawn into the building through the plenum, cooled from the radiator, and cools the mass of the building structure. During the day, the building mass acts as a heat sink.

=== Evaporative cooling ===
{{Main|Evaporative cooling}}
This design relies on the evaporative process of water to cool the incoming air while simultaneously increasing the relative humidity. A saturated filter is placed at the supply inlet so the natural process of evaporation can cool the supply air. Apart from the energy to drive the fans, water is the only other resource required to provide conditioning to indoor spaces. The effectiveness of evaporative cooling is largely dependent on the humidity of the outside air; dryer air produces more cooling. A study of field performance results in Kuwait revealed that power requirements for an evaporative cooler are approximately 75% less than the power requirements for a conventional packaged unit air-conditioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=G.P.|last=Maheshwari|first2=F.|last2=Al-Ragom|first3=R.K.|last3= Suri|title=Energy-saving potential of an indirect evaporative cooler|journal=Applied Energy|date=May 2001|volume=69|issue=1|pages=69–76|doi=10.1016/S0306-2619(00)00066-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for interior comfort, a study found that evaporative cooling reduced inside air temperature by 9.6&amp;nbsp;°C compared to outdoor temperature.&lt;ref name=amer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amer|first=E.H.|title=Passive options for solar cooling of buildings in arid areas|journal=Energy|date=July 2006|volume=31|issue=8–9|pages=1332–1344|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2005.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; An innovative passive system uses evaporating water to cool the roof so that major portion of solar heat does not come inside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebetterindia.com/93603/summer-heat-cooling-solution-low-cost-easy/ Beat the Heat with an Easy Cooling Solution That Costs a Tenth of an AC]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Earth coupling ===
{{Main|Ground-coupled heat exchanger}}
[[Ground-coupled heat exchanger|Earth coupling]] uses the moderate and consistent temperature of the soil to act as a heat sink to cool a building through [[Thermal conduction|conduction]]. This passive cooling strategy is most effective when earth temperatures are cooler than ambient air temperature, such as in hot climates.
*'''Direct coupling''' or [[earth sheltering]] occurs when a building uses earth as a buffer for the walls. The earth acts as a heat sink and can effectively mitigate temperature extremes. Earth sheltering improves the performance of building envelopes by reducing heat losses and also reduces heat gains by limiting infiltration.&lt;ref name=kwok&gt;{{cite book|last=Kwok|first=Alison G.|last2=Grondzik|first2=Walter T.|title=The Green Studio Handbook. Environmental strategies for schematic design|year=2011|publisher=Architectural Press|location=
30 Corporate Drive, Suite 400, Burlington, MA 01803, USA|isbn=978-0-08-089052-4|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Indirect coupling''' means that a building is coupled with the earth by means of earth ducts. An earth duct is a buried tube that acts as avenue for supply air to travel through before entering the building. The supply air is cooled by conductive heat transfer between the tubes and surrounding soil. Therefore, earth ducts will not perform well as a source of cooling unless the soil temperature is lower than the desired room air temperature.&lt;ref name=kwok /&gt; Earth ducts typically require long tubes to cool the supply air to an appropriate temperature before entering the building. A fan is required to draw the air from the earth duct into the building. Some of the factors that affect the performance of an earth duct are: duct length, number of bends, thickness of duct wall, depth of duct, diameter of the duct, and air velocity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3370">In [[digital electronics]], the '''power–delay product''' ('''PDP''') is a figure of merit correlated with the [[energy efficiency (electricity)|energy efficiency]] of a [[logic gate]] or [[logic family]].&lt;ref name="Gaudet_2014"/&gt; Also known as '''switching energy''', it is the product of [[power consumption]] ''P'' (averaged over a switching event) times the input–output delay or duration of the switching event ''D''.&lt;ref name="Gaudet_2014"/&gt; It has the dimension of energy and measures the energy consumed per switching event.

In a [[CMOS]] circuit the switching energy and thus the PDP for a 0-to-1-to-0 computation cycle is C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;middot;V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, lowering the supply voltage V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt; lowers the PDP.&lt;ref name="Gaudet_2014"/&gt;

{{anchor|EDP}}Energy-efficient circuits with a low PDP may also be performing very slowly, thus '''energy–delay product''' ('''EDP'''), the product of ''E'' and ''D'' (or ''P'' and ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), is sometimes a more preferable metric.&lt;ref name="Gaudet_2014"/&gt;

In CMOS circuits the delay is inversely proportional to the supply voltage V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt; and hence EDP is proportional to V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt;. Consequently, lowering V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt; also benefits EDP.&lt;ref name="Gaudet_2014"/&gt;

Based on biological models (e.g. the floating ferns ''Salvinia'', backswimmer ''Notonecta''), biomimetic Salvinia-surfaces are used as drag reducing coatings (up to 30% reduction were previously measured on the first prototypes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Barthlott, W., Mail, M., &amp; C.

Such surfaces require an extremely water repellent super-hydrophobic surface and an elastic hairy structure in the millimeter range to entrap air while submerged. The Salvinia effect was discovered by the biologist and botanist Wilhelm Barthlott (University of Bonn) and his colleagues and has been investigated on several plants and animals since 2002. Publications and patents were published between 2006 and 2016.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Barthlott, W., Wiersch, S., Čolić, Z., &amp; K.

Three of the ten known Salvinia species show a paradoxical chemical heterogenity: hydrophilic hair tips, in addition to the super-hydrophobic plant surface, further stabilizing the air layer.&lt;ref name="Trichome"&gt;Ditsche-Kuru, P., Schneider, E.S., Melskotte, J.-E., Brede, M., Leder, A., &amp; W.

== ''Salvinia'', ''Notonecta'' and other organisms with air retaining surfaces ==
Immersed in water, extremely water repellent ([[Hydrophobe|super-hydrophobic]]), structured surfaces trap air between the structures and this air-layer is maintained for a period of time. A silvery shine, due to the reflection of light at the interface of air and water, is visible on the submerged surfaces.

Long lasting air layers also occur   in aquatic arthropods which breathe via a physical gill (plastron) e. g. the water spider (''[[Argyroneta]]'') and the saucer bug (''Aphelocheirus'') Air layers are presumably also conducive to the reduction of friction in fast moving animals under water, as is the case for the back swimmer [[Notonectidae|''Notonecta'']].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Amabili, M., Giacomello, A., Meloni, S.,&amp; C. M. Casciola, (2015) Unraveling the Salvinia Paradox: Design Principles for Submerged Superhydrophobicity.  ''Advanced Materials Interfaces''. 2(14).  DOI:10.1002/admi.201500248.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known examples for long term air retention under water are the floating ferns of genus ''[[Salvinia]]''. About ten species of very diverse sizes are found in lentic water in all warmer regions of the earth, one widely spread species ([[Salvinia natans|''S. natans'']]) found in temperate climates can be even found in Central Europe. The ability to retain air is presumably a survival technique for these plants. The upper side of the floating leaves is highly water repellent and possesses highly complex and species-specific very distinctive hairs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some species present multicellular free-standing hairs of 0.3–3&amp;nbsp;mm length (e. g. [[Salvinia natans|''S.'']] ''cucullata'') while on others, two hairs are connected at the tips (e. g. [[Salvinia|''S. oblongifolia'']]). S. minima and S. natans have four free standing hairs connected at a single base. The Giant Salvinia ([[Salvinia|''S. molesta'']]''),'' as well as ''S. auriculata,'' and other closely related species, display the most complex hairs: four hairs grow on a shared shaft; they are connected at their tips. These structures resemble microscopic eggbeaters and are therefore referred to as “eggbeater trichomes”. The entire leaf surface, including the hairs, is covered with nanoscale wax crystals which are the reason for the water repellent properties of the surfaces. These leaf surfaces are therefore a classical example of a “hierarchical structuring“.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The egg-beater hairs of ''Salvinia molesta'' and closely related species (e. g. [[Salvinia|Salvinia ''auriculata'']]) show an additional remarkable property. The four cells at the tip of each hair (the anchor cells),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as opposed to the rest of the hair, are free of wax and therefore [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]]; in effect, wettable  islands surrounded by a super-hydrophobic surface. This chemical heterogeneity,&lt;ref name="Trichome" /&gt; the ''Salvinia'' paradox, enables a pinning of the air water interface to the plant and increases the pressure and longtime stability of the air layer.&lt;ref name="Trichome" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BMBF"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/weeds/publications/guidelines/wons/pubs/s-molesta.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The air retaining surface of the floating fern does not lead to a reduction in friction. The ecological extremely adaptable Giant Salvinia (S. molesta) is one of the most important invasive plants in all tropical and subtropical regions of the earth and is the cause of economic as well as ecological problems.&lt;ref name="Solga"&gt;Konrad, W., Apeltauer, C., Frauendiener, J., Barthlott, W., &amp; A. Roth-Nebelsick, (2009) Applying methods from differential geometry to devise stable and persistent air layers attached to objects immersed in water. Journal of Bionic Engineering 6(4), pp 350–356, DOI: 10.1016/S1672-6529(08)60133-X&lt;/ref&gt; Its growth rate might be the highest of all vascular plants. In the tropics and under optimal conditions, ''S. molesta'' can double its biomass within four days. The Salvinia effect, described here, most likely plays an essential role in its ecological success; the multilayered floating plant mats presumably maintain their function of gas exchange within the air-layer.

[[File:Backswimmer Notonecta.JPG|thumb|Backswimmer (Notonecta glauca) under water: the silvery gleam is from the light reflecting off the interface between the air-layer on the wing and the surrounding water.|190x190px]]The Salvinia effect defines surfaces which are able to permantently keep relatively thick air layers as a result of their hydrophobic chemistry, in combination with a complex architecture &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;BMBF-Projekt PTJ-BIO/311965A: "Superhydrophobe Grenzflächen&amp;nbsp;– ein mögliches Potenzial für hydrodynamische technische Innovationen", Bonn 2002–2007.&lt;/ref&gt; in nano- and microscopic dimensions.

DOI:10.1007/s00339-015-9439-y.&lt;/ref&gt; An additional optimizing criterion is the chemical heterogeneity of the hydrophilic tips (Salvinia Paradox&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;). This is a prime example of a hierarchical structuring on several levels.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In plants and animals, air retaining salvinia effect surfaces are always fragmented in small compartments with a length of 0.5 to 8&amp;nbsp;cm and the borders are sealed against loss of air by particular microstructures.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balmert, A., Bohn, H.F., Ditsche-Kuru, P. &amp; W. Barthlott. (2011) Dry under water: Comparative morphology and functional aspects of air-retaining insect surfaces. ''Journal of Morphology''. 272(4), pp 442–451, DOI:10.1002/jmor.10921.&lt;/ref&gt; Compartments with sealed edges are also important for technical applications.

The working principle is illustrated in for the Giant Salvinia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The leaves of ''S. molesta'' are capable of keeping an air layer on its surfaces for a long time when submerged in water. If a leaf is pulled under water, the leaf surface shows a silvery shine. The distinctive feature of ''S. molesta'' lies in the long term stability. While the air layer on most [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] surfaces vanishes shortly after submerging, ''S. molesta'' is able to stabilize the air for several days to several weeks. The time span is thereby just limited by the lifetime of the leaf.

[[File:Funktionsprinzip Salvinia Effekt.jpg|thumb|Schematic illustration of the stabilization of underwater air layers retained by the hydrophilic Anchor cells (“Salvinia paradox”)|242x242px]]

The high stability is a consequence of a seemingly paradoxical combination of a [[Hydrophobe|superhydrophobic]] (extremely water repellent) surface with [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] (water attractive) patches on the tips of the structures.

When submerged under water, no water can penetrate the room between the hairs due to the hydrophobic character of the surfaces. However, the water is pinned to the tip of each hair by the four wax free (hydrophilic) end cells. This fixation results in a stabilization of the air layer under water. The principle is shown in the figure.

Two submerged, air retaining surfaces are schematically shown: on the left hand side: a hydrophobic surface. On the right hand side: a hydrophobic surface with hydrophilic tips.

If [[wikt:negative pressure|negative pressure]] is applied, a bubble is quickly formed on the purely hydrophobic surfaces (left) stretching over several structures. With increasing negative pressure the bubble grows and can detach from the surface. The air bubble rises to the surface and the air layer decreases until it vanishes completely.

In case of the surface with hydrophilic anchor cells (right) the water is pinned to the tips of every structure by the hydrophilic patch on top. These linkages allow the formation of a bubble stretching over several structures; bubble release is suppressed because several links have to be broken first. This results in a higher energy input for the bubble formation. Therefore an increased negative pressure is needed to form a bubble able to detach from the surface and rise upwards.

If a transfer of the effect to a technical surface is successful, ship hulls could be coated with this surface to reduce friction between ship and water resulting in less fuel consumption, fuel costs and reduction of its negative environmental impact (antifouling effect by the air layer).&lt;ref&gt;Klein, S.

The underlying principle is schematically shown in a figure. Two flow profiles of laminar flow in water over a solid surface and water flowing over an air retaining surface are compared here.

If water flows over a smooth solid surface, the velocity at the surface is zero due to the friction between water and surface molecules. If an air layer is situated between the solid surface and the water the velocity is higher than zero. The lower [[viscosity]] of air (55 times lower than the viscosity of water) reduces the transmission of [[Friction|friction forces]] by the same factor.

[[File:Skizze Reibungsreduktion.jpg|thumb|292x292px|Schematic illustration comparing the fluid dynamics of water along a solid surface and an air retaining surface: Directly at the solid surface the velocity of the water is zero due to the friction of water molecules and surface (left). In the case of the air retaining surface (right) the air layer serves as a slip agent. Due to the low viscosity of the air, the water is able to move on the air-water-interface which means a drag reduction and a velocity higher than zero.]]

[[File:Sanitary towel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Sanitary napkins]]
A '''sanitary napkin''', '''sanitary towel''', '''sanitary pad''', '''menstrual pad''', or '''pad''' is an [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]] item worn in the [[Undergarment|underwear]] by women who are [[menstruation|menstruating]], [[lochia|bleeding after giving birth]], recovering from gynecologic surgery, experiencing a [[miscarriage]] or [[abortion]], or in any other situation where it is necessary to absorb a flow of [[blood]] from the [[vagina]].

A menstrual pad is a type of [[feminine hygiene]] product that is worn externally, unlike [[tampon]]s and [[menstrual cup]]s which are worn inside the vagina. The frequency a woman will need to change her pad will vary depending on whether her menstrual flow is heavy or light.  

Menstrual pads are made from a range of materials, differing depending on style, country of origin, and brand. US brands include [[Kotex]], [[Always (brand)|Always]], [[List of Wal-Mart brands#Equate|Equate]], and [[Stayfree]]. [[Lil-lets]] are available in several other English-speaking countries. 

These pads are not to be confused with generally higher absorbency [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]] pads, which are worn by people who have [[urinary incontinence]] problems or experience stress incontinence. Although menstrual pads are not made for this use, some people use them for this purpose.

Although producers are generally reluctant to reveal the exact composition of their products, the main materials will usually be [[bleaching|bleached]] [[rayon]] ([[cellulose]] made from [[wood pulp]]), [[cotton]] and [[plastics]]. In addition, [[fragrance]] and [[antibacterial]] agents can be included. The plastic parts are the backsheet and [[polymer]] powder as an additional powerful [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]] ([[superabsorbent polymer]]s) that turns into a [[gel]] when moistened. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raisingnaturalkids.com/the-scary-truth-about-whats-in-your-maxi-pads-and-tampons-and-alternative-options/|title=The Scary Truth About What’s in Your Maxi-Pads and Tampons (and alternative options) - Raising Natural Kids|author=|date=7 April 2015|website=raisingnaturalkids.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|hGmA71o7p5s}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] are advertising a proprietary material called infinicel as the core of their napkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iresolve.eu/index.php/component/k2/item/92-infinicel-what-is-made-of|title=iResolve - Infinicel - what is made of?|date=|website=iresolve.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In general, the layering is as follows: "an absorbent core material placed between a flexible liquid-pervious topsheet and a liquid-impervious plastic backsheet that has an adhesive on the outside for attaching the napkin to an undergarment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/258/410/2480393/|title=Hemphill v.

Environmentally more friendly solutions can be found in 100% cotton pads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biggreenpurse.com/seven-ways-to-green-your-period/|title=Seven Ways to "Green" Your Period - Big Green Purse|author=|date=30 August 2010|website=biggreenpurse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several different types of [[disposable]] menstrual pads:

* [[pantiliner|Panty liner]] – Designed to absorb daily vaginal discharge, light menstrual flow, "[[Metrorrhagia|spotting]]", slight [[urinary incontinence]], or as a backup for [[tampon]] or [[menstrual cup]] use.
* Ultra-thin – A very compact (thin) pad, which may be as absorbent as a Regular or Maxi/Super pad but with less bulk.
* Regular – A middle range absorbency pad.
* Maxi / Super – A larger absorbency pad, useful for the start of the [[menstrual cycle]] when menstruation is often heaviest.
* Overnight – A longer pad to allow for more protection while the wearer is lying down, with an absorbency suitable for overnight use.
* Maternity – These are usually slightly longer than a maxi/Super pad and are designed to be worn to absorb [[lochia]] (bleeding that occurs after childbirth) and also can absorb urine.

The shape, absorbency and lengths may vary depending on manufacturer, but usually range from the short slender panty liner to the larger and longer overnight.  Long pads are offered for extra protection or for larger people whose [[undergarment]]s might not be completely protected by regular length pads, and also for overnight use.

Other options are often offered in a manufacturer's line of pads, such as wings or tabs that wrap around the sides of underwear to add additional leak protection and help secure the pad in place.  Deodorant is also added to some pads, which is designed to cover menstrual [[odor]] with a light [[Aroma compound|fragrance]].  There are even [[panty liner]]s specifically designed to be worn with a thong/[[G-string]].

[[File:Clothpad.jpg|thumb|Reusable cloth menstrual pad with [[Kokopelli]] motif.]]

===Reusable (cloth) ===
{{Main|Cloth menstrual pad}}
Alternatively, some people use a washable or reusable [[cloth menstrual pad]]. These are made from a number of types of fabric — most often cotton flannel, or hemp (which is highly absorbent and not as bulky as cotton). Most styles have wings that secure around the underpants, but some are just held in place (without wings) between the body and the underpants.  Some (particularly the older styles) are available in belted styles. [[Cloth menstrual pad|Washable menstrual pads]] do not need to be disposed of after use and therefore offer a more economical alternative. [[Cloth menstrual pad|Reusable menstrual pads]] can be found on a number of websites, or are made at home (instructions are available online). They have become a popular alternative because they are allergen- and perfume-free, and can be more comfortable for people who suffer from irritations from using disposable pads.

[[Cloth menstrual pad]]s made a comeback around the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mum.org/collectionwash.htm|title=From the Collection of MUM: Washable Menstrual Pads and Underpants|author=|date=|website=www.mum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; with their popularity increasing in the late 80s and early 90s. Reasons women choose to switch to cloth menstrual pads include comfort, savings over time, environmental impact and health reasons.

There are many styles of cloth menstrual pads available today, ranging from pantyliners to overnight pads. Popular styles of cloth menstrual pads include all-in-one, or AIO pads, in which the absorbent layer is sewn inside the pad, 'inserts on top' style pads, which have absorbent layers that can be secured on top of the pad as needed, envelope or pocket style pads, which have absorbent layers that can be inserted inside the pad as needed, and a foldable style, in which the pad folds around the absorbent layers. Cloth menstrual pads can have waterproof lining, which provides more leak protection but may also be less breathable.

==Uses==
Menstrual pads are worn to absorb menstrual discharge (and thereby protect clothing and furnishings). They are usually individually wrapped so they are easier and more discreet to carry in a purse or bag.  This wrapper may be used to wrap the soiled pads before disposing of them in appropriate receptacles.  Some people prefer to wrap the pads with toilet paper instead of (or as well as) using the wrapper, which, often being made of slick plastic with a small tape tab, may not adequately stick.  Menstrual pads of any type should not be flushed down the toilet as they can cause blockages. In [[developed countries]], public toilets almost always include a purpose-made receptacle in which to place soiled pads. In first aid, they make excellent dressings for heavy bleeding due to their high absorbency if gauze is unavailable or inadequate.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Many people who experience [[urinary incontinence]] use menstrual pads to manage bladder leaks. However, since menstrual pads are designed to absorb menstrual flow, they are not as effective in absorbing urinary leaks; [[Incontinence pad|incontinence pads]] are designed for this purpose.

If a woman does not have sanitary napkins on hand, she might use [[toilet paper]] as a temporary substitution.

[[Disposable]] menstrual pads grew from a [[Benjamin Franklin]] invention created to help stop wounded soldiers from bleeding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.menstruation-info-with-doc.com/sanitary-napkin.html|title=The Sanitary Napkin Or Menstrual Pad|website=Menstruation Info with Doc|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but appear to have been first commercially available from around 1888 with the Southall's pad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mum.org/southall.htm|title=Ads for early Southall's disposable menstrual pads in the U.K. at MUM|author=|date=|website=www.mum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercially available American disposable napkins were Lister's Towels created by [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] in 1888. Disposable pads had their start with nurses using their wood pulp bandages to absorb their menstrual flow, creating a pad that was made from easily obtainable materials and inexpensive enough to throw away after use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mum.org/collection.htm|title=Ads for Hartmann's menstrual pad (1890s)|publisher=Museum of Menstruation and Women's Health|author=|date=|website=www.mum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kotex]]'s first advertisement for products made with this wood pulp (Cellucotton) appeared in January 1921.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mum.org/CuradsKotexads.htm|title=Inside the Museum of Menstruation 6|author=|date=|website=www.mum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the first disposable pad manufacturers were also manufacturers of bandages, which could give an indication of what these products were like.

Until disposable sanitary pads were created, cloth or reusable pads were widely used to collect menstrual blood. Women often used a variety of home-made menstrual pads which they crafted from various fabrics,  or other absorbent materials, to collect menstrual blood.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mum.org/whatwore.htm|title=What European and American women in the past wore when menstruating|publisher=Museum of Menstruation and Women's Health|author=|date=|website=www.mum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after disposable pads were commercially available, for several years they were too expensive for many women to afford.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanitary-product.com/sanitary-napkins/Dry-Weave-Surface-Regular-With-Wings.htm|title=dry-weave sanitary napkin, sanitary napkin with wings, disposable sanitary napkin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=sanitary-product.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509155108/http://www.sanitary-product.com/sanitary-napkins/Dry-Weave-Surface-Regular-With-Wings.htm|archivedate=2008-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When they could be afforded, women were allowed to place money in a box so that they would not have to speak to the clerk and take a box of [[Kotex]] pads from the counter themselves.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; It took several years for disposable menstrual pads to become commonplace.  However, they are now used nearly exclusively in most of the industrialized world.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

The first of the [[disposable]] pads were generally in the form of a [[cotton wool]] or similar fibrous rectangle covered with an absorbent liner. The liner ends were extended front and back so as to fit through loops in a special girdle or belt worn beneath undergarments. This design was notorious for slipping either forward or back of the intended position.

Later an adhesive strip was placed on the bottom of the pad for attachment to the crotch of the panties, and this became a favoured method with women. The belted sanitary napkin quickly disappeared during the early 1980s.

The ergonomic design and materials used to make pads also changed through the 1980s to today. With earlier materials not being as absorbent and effective, and early pads being up to two centimetres thick, leaks were a major problem. Some variations introduced were quilting of the lining, adding "wings" and reducing the thickness of the pad by utilising products such as [[sphagnum]] and polyacrylate superabsorbent gels derived from petroleum. The materials used to manufacture most pads are derived from the petroleum industry and forestry. The absorbent core, made from chlorine bleached wood pulp, could be reduced to make slimmer products with the addition of [[polyacrylate]] gels which sucks up the liquid quickly and holds it in a suspension under pressure.

'''Soil pH''' is a measure of the [[acidity]] or [[basicity]] (alkalinity) of a  [[soil]]. [[pH]] is defined as the negative [[logarithm]] (base&amp;nbsp;10) of the [[activity (chemistry)|activity]] of [[hydronium]] ions ({{chem|H|+}} or, more precisely, {{chem|H|3|O|+|aq}}) in a [[aqueous solution|solution]]. In soils, it is measured in a slurry of soil mixed with water (or a salt solution, such as 0.01 M {{chem|Ca|Cl|2}}), and normally falls between 3 and 10, with 7 being neutral. Acid soils have a pH below 7 and [[Alkali soil|alkaline soils]] have a pH above 7. Ultra-acidic soils (pH &lt; 3.5) and very strongly alkaline soils (pH &gt; 9) are rare.&lt;ref name="Slessarev2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slessarev|first1=E.

'''Soil pH''' is considered a master variable in soils as it affects many chemical processes.  It specifically affects [[Plant nutrition|plant nutrient]] availability by controlling the chemical forms of the different nutrients and influencing the chemical reactions they undergo. The optimum pH range for most plants is between 5.5 and 7.5;&lt;ref name="QueenslandGovt2017"/&gt; however, many plants have adapted to thrive at pH&amp;nbsp;values outside this range.

==Classification of soil pH ranges==

The United States Department of Agriculture [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] classifies soil pH ranges as follows:

==Determining pH==
Methods of determining pH include:
*Observation of soil profile: Certain profile characteristics can be indicators of either acid, saline, or sodic conditions.  Examples are:&lt;ref&gt;Buol, S. W., R. J. Southard, R.C. Graham and P.A. McDaniel. Soil Genesis and Classification. (5th) Edition, Ia. State Press p.&amp;nbsp;494. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
**Poor incorporation of the organic surface layer with the underlying mineral layer – this can indicate strongly acidic soils;
**The classic [[podzol]] horizon sequence, since podzols are strongly acidic: in these soils, a pale eluvial (E) horizon lies under the organic surface layer and overlies a dark B horizon;
**Presence of a [[caliche]] layer indicates the presence of calcium carbonates, which are present in alkaline conditions;
**Columnar [[Soil structure|structure]] can be an indicator of sodic condition.
*Observation of predominant flora. [[Calcifuge]] plants (those that prefer an acidic soil) include ''[[Erica]]'', ''[[Rhododendron]]'' and nearly all other [[Ericaceae]] species, many [[birch]] (''Betula''), foxglove (''[[Digitalis]]''), [[gorse]] (''Ulex'' spp.), and [[Scots Pine]] (''Pinus sylvestris''). [[Calcicole]] (lime loving) plants include ash trees (''[[Fraxinus]]'' spp.), [[honeysuckle]] (''Lonicera''), ''[[Buddleja]]'', dogwoods (''[[Cornus (plant)|Cornus]]'' spp.), lilac (''[[Syringa]]'') and ''[[Clematis]]'' species.
*Use of an inexpensive pH testing kit, where in a small sample of soil is mixed with [[pH indicator|indicator]] solution which changes colour according to the acidity.
*Use of [[litmus paper]]. A small sample of soil is mixed with distilled water, into which a strip of [[litmus paper]] is inserted. If the soil is acidic the paper turns red, if basic, blue.
*Use of a commercially available electronic [[pH meter]], in which a glass or solid-state electrode is inserted into moistened soil or a mixture (suspension) of soil and water; the pH is usually read on a digital display screen.
* Recently, spectrophotometric methods have been developed to measure soil pH involving addition of an indicator dye to the soil extract.&lt;ref&gt;Bargrizan S, Smernik R, Mosley LM (2017). Development of a spectrophotometric method for determining pH of soil extracts and comparison with glass electrode measurements. Soil Science Society of America Journal 81, 1350-1358. doi:10.2136/sssaj2017.04.0119  &lt;/ref&gt; These compared well to glass electrode measurements but offer substantial advantages such as lack of drift, liquid junction and suspension effects

Precise, repeatable measures of soil pH are required for scientific research and monitoring. This generally entails laboratory analysis using a standard protocol; an example of such a protocol is that in the USDA Soil Survey Field and Laboratory Methods Manual.&lt;ref name="USDA2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Soil Survey Staff|editor1-last=R. Burt and Soil Survey Staff|title=Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory Methods Manual.

===Summary of Method===
&lt;poem&gt;
The pH is measured in soil-water (1:1) and soil-salt (1:2 &lt;chem&gt;CaCl2&lt;/chem&gt;) solutions. For convenience, the pH is initially measured in water and then measured in &lt;chem&gt;CaCl2&lt;/chem&gt;. With the addition of an equal volume of 0.02 M CaCl2 to the soil suspension that was prepared for the water pH, the final soil-solution ratio is 1:2 0.01 M &lt;chem&gt;CaCl2&lt;/chem&gt;.
A 20-g soil sample is mixed with 20 mL of reverse osmosis (RO) water (1:1 w:v) with occasional stirring. The sample is allowed to stand 1 h with occasional stirring. The sample is stirred for 30 s, and the 1:1 water pH is measured. The 0.02 M &lt;chem&gt;CaCl2&lt;/chem&gt; (20 mL) is added to soil suspension, the sample is stirred, and the 1:2 0.01 M CaCl2 pH is measured (4C1a2a2).

==Factors affecting soil pH==
The pH of a natural soil depends on the mineral composition of the [[parent material]] of the soil, and the weathering reactions undergone by that parent material. In warm, humid environments, [[soil acidification]] occurs over time as the products of [[weathering]] are leached by water moving laterally or downwards through the soil. In dry climates, however, soil weathering and leaching are less intense and soil pH is often neutral or alkaline.&lt;ref name="USDA-NRCS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=USDA-NRCS|title=Soil pH|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs142p2_053293.pdf|website=Guides for Educators: Soil Quality Kit|accessdate=15 May 2017|location=www.nrcs.usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Breemen|first1=N.|author-link1=Nico van Breemen|last2=Mulder|first2=J.|last3=Driscoll|first3=C. T.|title=Acidification and alkalinization of soils|journal=Plant and Soil|date=October 1983|volume=75|issue=3|pages=283–308|doi=10.1007/BF02369968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources of acidity ===
Many processes contribute to soil acidification. These include:&lt;ref name="VanBreemen1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Breemen|first1=N.|last2=Driscoll|first2=C. T.|last3=Mulder|first3=J.|title=Acidic deposition and internal proton sources in acidification of soils and waters|journal=Nature|date=16 February 1984|volume=307|issue=5952|pages=599–604|doi=10.1038/307599a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Donald; Environmental Soil Chemistry. 2003, Academic Press, London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Rainfall:  Acid soils are most often found in areas of high rainfall. Rainwater has a slightly acidic pH (usually about 5.7) due to a reaction with {{chem|link=carbon dioxide|C|O|2}} in the atmosphere that forms [[carbonic acid]]. When this water flows through soil it results in the leaching of basic cations from the soil as bicarbonates; this increases the percentage of {{chem|Al|3+}} and {{chem|H|+}} relative to other cations.  
* Root [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and decomposition of organic matter by microorganisms releases {{chem|C|O|2}} which increases the carbonic acid ({{chem|H|2|C|O|3}}) concentration and subsequent leaching.
* Plant growth: Plants take up nutrients in the form of ions (e.g. {{chem|N|O|3|-}}, {{chem|N|H|4|+}}, {{chem|Ca|2+}}, {{chem|H|2|P|O|4|-}}), and they often take up more [[cation]]s than [[anion]]s.  However plants must maintain a neutral charge in their roots.  In order to compensate for the extra positive charge, they will release {{chem|H|+}} ions from the root.  Some plants also exude organic acids into the soil to acidify the zone around their roots to help solubilize metal nutrients that are insoluble at neutral pH, such as iron (Fe).
* Fertilizer use: [[Ammonium]] ({{chem|N|H|4|+}}) fertilizers react in the soil by the process of [[nitrification]] to form nitrate ({{chem|N|O|3|-}}), and in the process release {{chem|H|+}} ions.
* [[Acid rain]]: The burning of fossil fuels releases oxides of sulfur and nitrogen into the atmosphere. These react with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric and nitric acid in rain.
* [[Weathering#Oxidation|Oxidative weathering]]: Oxidation of some primary minerals, especially sulfides and those containing {{chem|Fe|2+}}, generate acidity. This process is often accelerated by human activity: 
** [[Acid mine drainage|Mine spoil]]:  Severely acidic conditions can form in soils near some mine spoils due to the oxidation of [[pyrite]].
** [[Acid sulfate soil]]s formed naturally in waterlogged coastal and estuarine environments can become highly acidic when drained or excavated.

=== Sources of alkalinity===
Total soil alkalinity increases with:&lt;ref name="Bloom2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=Paul R.|last2=Skyllberg|first2=Ulf|editor1-last=Huang|editor1-first=Pan Ming|editor2-last=Li|editor2-first=Yuncong|editor3-last=Sumner|editor3-first=Malcolm E.|title=Handbook of soil sciences : properties and processes|date=2012|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=9781439803059|pages=19-1 to 19-14|edition=2nd|chapter=Soil pH and pH buffering}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oosterbaan2003"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oosterbaan|first1=R.J.|title=Soil Alkalinity (Alkaline-sodic soils)|url=https://www.waterlog.info/pdf/acidalka.pdf|website=www.waterlog.info|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Weathering of [[Silicate mineral|silicate]], [[aluminosilicate]] and [[carbonate mineral|carbonate]] minerals containing {{chem|Na|+}}, {{chem|Ca|2+}}, {{chem|Mg|2+}} and {{chem|K|+}};
* Addition of silicate, aluminosilicate and carbonate minerals to soils; this may happen by deposition of material eroded elsewhere by wind or water, or by mixing of the soil with less weathered material (such as the [[Liming (soil)|addition of limestone]] to acid soils);
* Addition of water containing dissolved [[bicarbonate]]s (as occurs when [[Irrigation|irrigating]] with high-bicarbonate waters).

The accumulation of alkalinity in a soil (as carbonates and bicarbonates of Na, K, Ca and Mg) occurs when there is insufficient water flowing through the soils to leach soluble salts. This may be due to arid conditions, or poor internal soil [[drainage]]; in these situations most of the water that enters the soil is transpired (taken up by plants) or evaporates, rather than flowing through the soil.&lt;ref name="Bloom2012"/&gt;

The soil pH usually increases when the total [[alkalinity]] increases, but the balance of the added cations also has a marked effect on the soil pH. For example, increasing the amount of sodium in an alkaline soil tends to induce dissolution of [[calcium carbonate]], which increases the pH. [[Calcareous]] soils may vary in pH from 7.0 to 9.5, depending on the degree to which {{chem|Ca|2+}} or {{chem|Na|+}} dominate the soluble cations.&lt;ref name="Bloom2012"/&gt;

== Effect of soil pH on plant growth ==

=== Acid soils ===
Plants grown in acid soils can experience a variety of stresses including [[aluminium]]&amp;nbsp;(Al), [[hydrogen]]&amp;nbsp;(H), and/or [[manganese]]&amp;nbsp;(Mn) toxicity, as well as nutrient deficiencies of [[calcium]]&amp;nbsp;(Ca) and [[magnesium]]&amp;nbsp;(Mg).&lt;ref&gt;Brady, N. and Weil, R. The Nature and Properties of Soils.  13th ed. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aluminium#Effect on plants|Aluminium toxicity]] is the most widespread problem in acid soils.  Aluminium is present in all soils, but dissolved Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is toxic to plants; Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is most soluble at low pH; above pH&amp;nbsp;5.0, there is little Al in soluble form in most soils.&lt;ref name="Kopittke2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kopittke|first1=Peter M.|last2=Menzies|first2=Neal W.|last3=Wang|first3=Peng|last4=Blamey|first4=F. Pax C.|title=Kinetics and nature of aluminium rhizotoxic effects: a review|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|date=August 2016|volume=67|issue=15|pages=4451–4467|doi=10.1093/jxb/erw233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansson et al (2011) Differences in soil properties in adjacent stands of Scots pine, Norway spruce and silver birch in SW Sweden. Forest Ecology and Management 262 522–530&lt;/ref&gt; Aluminium is not a plant nutrient, and as such, is not actively taken up by the plants, but enters plant roots passively through osmosis.  Aluminium inhibits root growth; lateral roots and root tips become thickened and roots lack fine branching; root tips may turn brown. In the root, the initial effect of Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is the inhibition of the expansion of the cells of the rhizodermis, leading to their rupture; thereafter it is known to interfere with many physiological processes including the uptake and transport of calcium and other essential nutrients, cell division, cell wall formation, and enzyme activity.&lt;ref name="Kopittke2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rout|first1=GR|last2=Samantaray|first2=S|last3=Das|first3=P|title=Aluminium toxicity in plants: a review|journal=Agronomie|date=2001|volume=21|issue=1|pages=4–5|url=http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/88/61/01/PDF/hal-00886101.pdf|accessdate=11 June 2014|ref=Rout 2011|doi=10.1051/agro:2001105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion) stress can also limit plant growth. The proton pump, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase, of the plasmalemma of root cells works to maintain the near-neutral pH of their cytoplasm. A high proton activity (pH within the range 3.0–4.0 for most plant species) in the external growth medium overcomes the capacity of the cell to maintain the cytoplasmic pH and growth shuts down.&lt;ref name="Shavrukov2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shavrukov|first1=Yuri|last2=Hirai|first2=Yoshihiko|title=Good and bad protons: genetic aspects of acidity stress responses in plants|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|date=January 2016|volume=67|issue=1|pages=15–30|doi=10.1093/jxb/erv437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In soils with a high content of [[manganese]]-containing minerals, Mn toxicity can become a problem at pH 5.6 and lower.  Manganese, like aluminium, becomes increasingly soluble as pH drops, and Mn toxicity symptoms can be seen at pH levels below 5.6.  Manganese is an essential plant nutrient, so plants transport Mn into leaves.  Classic symptoms of Mn toxicity are crinkling or cupping of leaves.

===Nutrient availability in relation to soil pH===
[[File:Soil-pH.svg|thumb|right|Nutrient availability in relation to soil pH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arnold |last=Finck |location=Kiel |year=1976 |title=Pflanzenernährung in Stichworten |publisher=Hirt |isbn=3-554-80197-6 |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Soil pH affects the availability of some [[Plant nutrition|plant nutrients]]:

As discussed above, aluminium toxicity has direct effects on plant growth; however, by limiting root growth, it also reduces the availability of plant nutrients. Because roots are damaged, nutrient uptake is reduced, and deficiencies of the [[macronutrients]] (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium) are frequently encountered in very strongly acidic to ultra-acidic soils (pH&lt;5.0).&lt;ref name="Sumner2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sumner|first1=Malcolm E.|last2=Yamada|first2=Tsuioshi|title=Farming with acidity|journal=Communications in Soil Science and Plant Analysis|date=November 2002|volume=33|issue=15–18|pages=2467–2496|doi=10.1081/CSS-120014461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plant nutrition#Molybdenum|Molybdenum]] availability is increased at higher pH; this is because the molybdate ion is more strongly sorbed by clay particles at lower pH.&lt;ref name="Huang2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bolan|first1=N|last2=Brennan|first2=R.|editor1-last=Huang|editor1-first=Pan Ming|editor2-last=Li|editor2-first=Yuncong|editor3-last=Sumner|editor3-first=Malcolm E.|title=Handbook of soil sciences: resource management and environmental impacts|date=2011|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=9781439803073|pages=11-1 to 11-80|edition=2nd|chapter=Bioavailability of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Si, and Micronutrients}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plant nutrition#Zinc|Zinc]], [[Plant nutrition#Iron|iron]], [[Plant nutrition#Copper|copper]] and [[Plant nutrition#Manganese|manganese]] show decreased availability at higher pH (increased sorbtion at higher pH).&lt;ref name="Huang2011"/&gt;

The effect of pH on [[Plant nutrition#Phosphorus|phosphorus]] availability varies considerably, depending on soil conditions and the crop in question. The prevailing view in the 1940s and 1950s was that P availability was maximized near neutrality (soil pH 6.5–7.5), and decreased at higher and lower pH.&lt;ref name="Truog1946"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Truog|first1=Emil|title=Science in farming, USDA Yearbook, 1941–1947|date=1946|pages=566–576|chapter=The Liming of Soils}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sumner1986"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sumner|first1=M.E.|last2=Farina|first2=M.P.W.|editor1-last=Stewart|editor1-first=B.A.|title=Advances in Soil Science|date=1986|publisher=Springer New York|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4613-8660-5|pages=201–236|chapter=Phosphorus interactions with other nutrients and lime in field cropping systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactions of phosphorus with pH in the moderately to slightly acidic range (pH 5.5–6.5) are, however, far more complex than is suggested by this view. Laboratory tests, glasshouse trials and field trials have indicated that increases in pH within this range may increase, decrease, or have no effect on P availability to plants.&lt;ref name="Sumner1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haynes1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haynes|first1=R. J.|title=Effects of liming on phosphate availability in acid soils|journal=Plant and Soil|date=October 1982|volume=68|issue=3|pages=289–308|doi=10.1007/BF02197935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Water availability in relation to soil pH ==
{{Further|Water content|Water potential|Alkali soil}}
Strongly alkaline soils are [[Sodic soil|sodic]] and [[Dispersion (geology)|dispersive]], with slow [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]], low [[hydraulic conductivity]] and poor [[available water capacity]].&lt;ref name="Ellis Foth 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Ellis | first=Boyd | last2=Foth | first2=Henry | title=Soil Fertility, Second Edition | pages=73–74 | website=Google Books | date=2017-03-09 | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Soil_Fertility_Second_Edition.html?id=URT1qVstE0kC | accessdate=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant growth is severely restricted because [[aeration]] is poor when the soil is wet; in dry conditions, plant-available water is rapidly depleted and the soils become hard and cloddy (high soil strength).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sodic soils|url=http://plantsinaction.science.uq.edu.au/edition1/?q=content/17-1-2-sodic-soils|website=plantsinaction.science.uq.edu.au|accessdate=19 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many strongly acidic soils, on the other hand, have strong aggregation, good [[drainage|internal drainage]], and good water-holding characteristics. However, for many plant species, [[Aluminium#Effect on plants|aluminium toxicity]] severely limits root growth, and [[moisture stress]] can occur even when the soil is relatively moist.&lt;ref name="Kopittke2016"/&gt;

==Plant pH preferences==
In general terms, different plant species are adapted to soils of different pH ranges. For many species, the suitable soil pH range is fairly well known. Online databases of plant characteristics, such ''USDA PLANTS''&lt;ref name="USDA2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=USDA PLANTS Database|title=PLANTS Database Advanced Search using minimum and maximum pH|url=https://plants.usda.gov/adv_search.html|website=plants.usda.gov|publisher=USDA NCRS|accessdate=2 June 2017|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Plants for a Future''&lt;ref name="PFAF2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Plants for a Future|title=Plant Database Search|url=http://www.pfaf.org/USER/plantsearch.aspx|website=www.pfaf.org|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to look up the suitable soil pH range of a wide range of plants. Documents like ''Ellenberg's indicator values for British plants''&lt;ref name="Hill1999"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=M.O.|last2=Mountford|first2=J.O.|last3=Roy|first3=D.B.|last4=Bunce|first4=R.G.H.|title=Ellenberg's indicator values for British plants. ECOFACT Volume 2. Technical Annex|date=1999|publisher=Institute of Terrestrial Ecology|isbn=1870393481|url=http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/6411/1/ECOFACT2a.pdf|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; can also be consulted.

However, a plant may be intolerant of a particular pH in some soils as a result of a particular mechanism, and that mechanism may not apply in other soils. For example, a soil low in [[molybdenum]] may not be suitable for [[soybean]] plants at pH 5.5, but soils with sufficient molybdenum allow optimal growth at that pH.&lt;ref name="Sumner2002"/&gt; Similarly, some calcifuges (plants intolerant of high-pH soils) can tolerate calcareous soils if sufficient phosphorus is supplied.&lt;ref name="Lee1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=J.A.|title=The calcicole-calcifuge problem revisited.|journal=Advances in Botanical Research|date=1998|volume=29|page=13|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=1YigNjS78xsC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another confounding factor is that different varieties of the same species often have different suitable soil pH ranges. Plant breeders can use this to breed varieties that can tolerate conditions that are otherwise considered unsuitable for that species – examples are projects to breed aluminium-tolerant and manganese-tolerant varieties of cereal crops for food production in strongly acidic soils.&lt;ref name="Scott1989"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=B.J.|last2=Fisher|first2=J.A.|editor1-last=Robson|editor1-first=A.D.|title=Soil acidity and plant growth|date=1989|publisher=Academic Press|location=Sydney|isbn=0125906552|pages=167–203|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Soil_Acidity_and_Plant_Growth.html?id=KL8gWPuOET0C&amp;pg=PA167|accessdate=5 June 2017|chapter=Selection of genotypes tolerant of aluminium and manganese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The table below gives suitable soil pH ranges for some widely cultivated plants as found in the ''USDA PLANTS Database''.&lt;ref name="USDA2017"/&gt; Some species (like ''[[Pinus radiata]]'' and ''[[Opuntia ficus-indica]]'') tolerate only a narrow range in soil pH, whereas others (such as ''[[Vetiveria zizanioides]]'') tolerate a very wide pH range.

==Changing soil pH ==

===Increasing pH of acidic soil===
Finely ground [[agricultural lime]] is often applied to acid soils to increase soil pH ([[Liming (soil)|liming]]). The amount of limestone or chalk needed to change pH is determined by the mesh size of the lime (how finely it is ground) and the [[Soil#Buffering of soils|buffering capacity]] of the soil. A high mesh size (60 mesh = 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm; 100 mesh = 0.149&amp;nbsp;mm) indicates a finely ground lime that will react quickly with soil acidity. The buffering capacity of a soil depends on the clay content of the soil, the type of clay, and the amount of organic matter present, and may be related to the soil [[cation exchange capacity]].  Soils with high clay content will have a higher buffering capacity than soils with little clay, and soils with high organic matter will have a higher buffering capacity than those with low organic matter.  Soils with higher buffering capacity require a greater amount of lime to achieve an equivalent change in pH.&lt;ref name="Aitken1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aitken|first1=R.L.|last2=Moody|first2=P.W.|last3=Mckinley|first3=P.G.|title=Lime requirement of acidic Queensland soils. I. Relationships between soil properties and pH buffer capacity|journal=Australian Journal of Soil Research|date=1990|volume=28|issue=5|pages=695–701|doi=10.1071/SR9900695|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/sr/SR9900695|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amendments other than agricultural lime that can be used to increase the pH of soil include wood ash, industrial calcium oxide ([[burnt lime]]), [[magnesium oxide]], [[basic slag]] ([[calcium silicate]]), and [[oyster]] shells.  These products increase the pH of soils through various [[acid-base reaction]]s. [[Calcium silicate]] neutralizes active acidity in the soil by reacting with H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;ions to form [[Silicic acid|monosilicic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), a neutral solute.&lt;ref name="VonUexkull1986"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Von Uexkull|first1=H.R.|title=Efficient Fertilizer Use in Acid Upland Soils of the Humid Tropics|date=1986|publisher=Food &amp; Agriculture Org.|isbn=9789251023877|pages=16–22|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=SoaQz9u65lwC|accessdate=5 June 2017|language=en|chapter=Lime and liming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decreasing the pH of alkaline soil===
The pH of an alkaline soil can be reduced by adding acidifying agents or acidic organic materials. Elemental sulfur (90–99% S) has been used at application rates of 300–500&amp;nbsp;kg/ha – it slowly oxidizes in soil to form sulfuric acid. Acidifying fertilizers, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate and urea, can help to reduce the pH of a soil because ammonium oxidises to form nitric acid. Acidifying organic materials include peat or sphagnum peat moss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/publication/AG_Soils_2003-02.pdf|title=SOLUTIONS TO SOIL PROBLEMS|last=Cox|first=Loralie|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in high-pH soils with a high calcium carbonate content (more than 2%), it can be very costly and/or ineffective to attempt to reduce the pH with acids. In such cases, it is often more efficient to add phosphorus, iron, manganese, copper and/or zinc instead, because deficiencies of these nutrients are the most common reasons for poor plant growth in calcareous soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs142p2_052208.pdf|title=Soil Quality Indicators: pH|last=|first=|date=|website=NCRS.USDA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.extension.org/pages/63500/solutions-to-soil-problems:-high-ph|title=Solutions to Soil Problems: High pH – eXtension|access-date=2017-02-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''telecommand''' is a command sent to control a remote system or systems not directly connected (e.g. via wires) to the place from which the telecommand is sent. The word is derived from ''tele'' = remote ([[Greek language|Greek]]), and ''command'' = to entrust/order ([[Latin language|Latin]]). Systems that need remote measurement and reporting of information of interest to the system designer or operator require the counterpart of telecommand, [[telemetry]]. The ''telecommand'' can be done in [[Real-time Control System|real time]] or not depending on the circumstances (in space, delay may be of days), as was the case of [[Rover (space exploration)#Marsokhod|Marsokhod]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/213/50.shtml |title=Советский грунт с Марса |publisher=Novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304232912/http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/213/50.shtml |archivedate=March 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
*Control of a TV from the sofa
*Remote guidance of weapons or missiles
*Control of a satellite from a ground station
*Flying a [[radio-controlled airplane]]

== Transmission of commands ==
For a Telecommand (TC) to be effective, it must be compiled into a pre-arranged format (which may follow a standard structure), modulated onto a carrier wave which is then transmitted with adequate power to the remote system. The remote system will then demodulate the digital signal from the carrier, decode the TC, and execute it.  Transmission of the carrier wave can be by ultrasound, infra-red or other electromagnetic means.

=== Infrared ===
[[Infrared]] light makes up the invisible section of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].&lt;ref name="howstuffworks1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Layton |first=Julia |url=http://www.howstuffworks.com/remote-control1.htm |title=HowStuffWorks "How Remote Controls Work" |publisher=Howstuffworks.com |date=2005-11-10 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This light, also classified as heat, transmits signals between the transmitter and receiver of the remote system.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks1"/&gt; Telecommand systems usually include a physical remote, which contains four key parts: buttons, [[integrated circuit]], button contacts, and a [[light-emitting diode]].&lt;ref name="softpedia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/How-Infrared-Remote-Controls-Work-81034.shtml |title=How Infrared Remote Controls Work |publisher=News.softpedia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the buttons on a remote are pressed they touch and close their corresponding contacts below them within the remote.&lt;ref name="softpedia1"/&gt; This completes the necessary circuit on the circuit board along with a change in [[Electrical resistance and conductance|electrical resistance]], which is detected by the integrated circuit. Based on the change in electrical resistance, the integrated circuit distinguishes which button was pushed and sends a corresponding [[binary code]] to the light-emitting diode (LED) usually located at the front of the remote.&lt;ref name="softpedia1"/&gt; To transfer the information from the remote to the receiver, the LED turns the electrical signals into an invisible beam of infrared light that corresponds with the binary code and sends this light to the receiver.&lt;ref name="softpedia1"/&gt; The receiver then detects the light signal via a [[photodiode]] and it is transformed into an electrical signal for the command and is sent to the receiver’s integrated circuit/[[microprocessor]] to process and complete the command.&lt;ref name="softpedia1"/&gt; The strength of the transmitting LED can vary and determines the required positioning accuracy of the remote in relevance to the receiver.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks1"/&gt; Infrared remotes have a maximum range of approximately 30 feet and require the remote control or transmitter and receiver to be within a [[Sightline|line of sight]].&lt;ref name="howstuffworks1"/&gt;

=== Ultrasonic ===
Ultrasonic is a technology used more frequently in the past for telecommand. Inventor [[Robert Adler]] is known for inventing the [[remote control]] which did not require batteries and used ultrasonic technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curiosity.discovery.com/question/how-infrared-remote-control-work |title=How does an infrared remote control work? - Curiosity |publisher=Curiosity.discovery.com |date=2011-07-07 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four aluminum rods inside the transmitter that produce high frequency sounds when they are hit at one end. Each rod is a different length, which enables them to produce varying sound pitches, which control the receiving unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/rstartinventions/a/remote_control.htm |title=History of the Television Remote Control |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology was widely used but had certain issues such as dogs being bothered by the high frequency sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modellbahnott.com/tqpage/ultrasonic.html |title=Ultrasonic Control |publisher=Modellbahnott.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New applications ==
Often the smaller new remote controlled airplanes and helicopters are incorrectly advertised as radio controlled devices (see [[Radio control]]) but they are either controlled via infra-red transmission or electromagnetically guided. Both of these systems are part of the telecommand area.

== Encryption ==
To prevent unauthorised access to the remote system, TC [[encryption]] may be employed. [[Secret sharing]] may be used.

'''Trinitrotriazine''', or '''2,4,6-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine''', is a theoretical [[explosive]] compound. Synthesis of this compound has been elusive despite its simple structure,&lt;ref&gt;G. D. Hartman, R. D. Hartman and J. E. Schwering. ''Tetrahedron Letters''. 1983; 24: 1011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. D. Coburn, C. L. Coon, H. H. Hayden and A. R. Mitchell. ''Synthesis''. 1986: 490.&lt;/ref&gt; as conventional [[nitration]] of [[triazine]] becomes increasingly more difficult as more nitro groups are added. A successful route would more likely proceed by trimerisation of nitryl cyanide.&lt;ref&gt;Korkin AA. Bartlett RJ. Theoretical Prediction of 2,4,6-Trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (TNTA).

'''Walkability''' is a measure of how friendly an area is to [[walking]]. Walkability has health, environmental, and economic benefits.{{Citation|title=Walkability Is Good for You|url=https://www.citylab.com/design/2014/12/growing-evidence-shows-walkability-is-good-for-you-and-for-cities/383612/}} Factors influencing walkability include the presence or absence and quality of [[footpath]]s, [[sidewalk]]s or other pedestrian [[right of way (public throughway)|rights-of-way]], traffic and road conditions, land use patterns, building accessibility, and safety, among others.&lt;ref name="TDM encyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.vtpi.org/tdm/tdm92.htm Online TDM Encyclopedia chapter on pedestrian improvements]&lt;/ref&gt;  Walkability is an important concept in [[sustainable]] [[urban design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=8642022&amp;q=walkability+sustainability&amp;uid=1015422&amp;setcookie=yes S. Grignaffini, S. Cappellanti, A. Cefalo, "Visualizing sustainability in urban conditions", ''WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment'', Vol. 1, pp. 253-262, 10 Jun 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
[[File:Bitola 2007.JPG|thumb|right|Mixed use pedestrian friendly street in [[Bitola]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].]]
One proposed definition for walkability is: "The extent to which the built environment is friendly to the presence of people living, shopping, visiting, enjoying or spending time in an area".&lt;ref&gt;Abley, Stephen. [http://www.levelofservice.com/walkability-research.pdf "Walkability Scoping Paper"]  21 March 2005. Retrieved 4/21/08&lt;/ref&gt; Factors affecting walkability include, but are not limited to:
* [[Permeability (spatial and transport planning)|Street connectivity]] 
* [[Land use]] mix
* Residential density (residential units per area of residential use)
* Presence of trees and vegetation
* Frequency and variety of buildings
* Entrances and other sensations along street frontages
* Transparency, which includes amount of glass in windows and doors, orientation and proximity of homes, and buildings to [[Surveillance|watch over]] the street
* Plenty of places to go to near the majority of homes
* Placemaking, such as street designs that work for people, not just cars 
* Retail [[floor area ratio]] &lt;ref name="JAPA article2"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.planning.org/japa/pdf/JAPAFrank06.pdf|title = Many Pathways from Land Use to Health|author = Frank|publisher = Journal of the American Planning Association|date = Winter 2006|page = 77|format = PDF|display-authors = etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Major [[infrastructure|infrastructural]] factors include access to [[mass transit]], presence and quality of [[footpaths]], buffers to moving traffic (planter strips, on-street [[parking]] or [[bike lanes]]) and [[pedestrian crossing]]s, [[aesthetics]], nearby local destinations, air quality, shade or sun in appropriate seasons, [[street furniture]], traffic volume and speed.&lt;ref name="TDM encyclopedia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ajpm-online.net/article/PIIS0749379706003059/fulltext|title=Indicators of Activity-Friendly Communities: An Evidence-Based Consensus Process|publisher=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|author=Ramirez|date=December 2006|pages=515–24|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wind conditions.

Walkability is also examined based on the surrounding [[built environment]]. Reid Ewing and [[Robert Cervero]]'s five D's of the built environment—density, diversity, design, destination accessibility, and distance to transit—heavily influence an area's walkability.&lt;ref&gt;Ewing, Reid and Cervero, Robert. "Travel and the Built Environment: A Meta-Analysis", ''Journal of the American Planning Association'', vol 76, no 3 (2010): 265-294.&lt;/ref&gt; Combinations of these factors influence an individual's decision to walk.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Ke.

Before cars and bicycles were mass-produced, walking was the main way to travel. It was the only way to get from place to place for much of human history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/magazine/the-history-of-a-city-underfoot.html?_r=0|title = The History of a City Underfoot

Cars were also becoming more affordable, leading to the rise of the automobile during the [[Post–World War II economic expansion]].&lt;ref&gt;Hendee, Caitlin. "More on the cover story: A short history of walkable urbanism and transit-oriented development". Denver Business Journal.[http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2014/09/02/more-on-the-cover-story-tuesday.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The detrimental effects of automobile emissions soon led to public concern over pollution.  Alternatives, including improved [[public transportation]] and walking infrastructure, have attracted more attention from planners and policymakers.

===Health===
Walkability indices have been found to correlate with both [[Body Mass Index]] (BMI) and physical activity of local populations.&lt;ref name="JAPA article2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Linking objectively measured physical activity with objectively measured urban form: Findings from SMARTRAQ|author=Frank|url=http://www.ajpm-online.net/article/PIIS0749379704003253/fulltext|publisher=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|date=February 2005|pages=117–25|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical activity can prevent chronic diseases, such as [[cardiovascular disease]], [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]], [[obesity]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Gase, Lauren N., Paul A. Simon, et al.. "Public Awareness of and Support for Infrastructure Changes Designed to Increase Walking and Biking in Los Angeles County."

Due to discrepancies between residents' health in [[inner city]] neighborhoods and [[suburb]]an neighborhoods with similar walkability measures, further research is needed to find additional built environment factors in walkability indices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ehjournal.net/content/5/1/25|title=Obesity, physical activity, and the urban environment: public health research needs|author=Lopez, Russel P. and H. Patricia Hynes|publisher=Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source|year=2006|doi=10.1186/1476-069X-5-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental===
One of most important benefits of walkability is the decrease of the automobile footprint in the community. Carbon emissions can be reduced if more people choose to walk rather than drive or use public transportation. The benefits of less emissions include improved health conditions and quality of life, less [[smog]], and less of a contribution to [[Global warming|global climate change]].

===Socioeconomic===
Walkability has also been found to have many economic benefits, including accessibility, cost savings both to individuals and to the public, increased efficiency of land use, increased livability, economic benefits from improved public health, and economic development, among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trb.metapress.com/content/m1573875u76t4223/ Todd Littman, "Economic Value of Walkability", ''Transportation Research Board of the National Academies'', Vol. 1828, 2003.], {{cite news|last=Litman|first=Todd Alexander|url=http://www.vtpi.org/walkability.pdf|title=Economic Value of Walkability|format=PDF|date=2004-10-12|publisher=Victoria Transport Policy Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of walkability are best guaranteed if the entire system of public corridors is walkable - not limited to certain specialized routes. More sidewalks and increased walkability can promote tourism and increase property value.&lt;ref name="The Benefits of Creating a Walking Community"&gt;[http://www.ipa.udel.edu/healthyDEtoolkit/walkability/benefits.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the demand for housing in a walkable urban context has increased. The term "[[Missing Middle Housing]]" as coined by Daniel Parolek of Opticos Design, Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parolek|first1=Daniel|title=Missing Middle Housing: Responding to the Demand for Walkable Urban Living|url=http://opticosdesign.com/missing-middle-housing-responding-to-the-demand-for-walkable-urban-living-2/|website=Opticos Design, Inc.|accessdate=April 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to multi-unit housing types (such as duplexes, fourplexes, bungalow courts, and mansion apartments not bigger than a large house), which are integrated throughout most walkable Pre-1940s neighborhoods, but became much less common after World War II, hence the term "missing." These housing types are often integrated into blocks with primarily single-family homes, to provide diverse housing choices and generate enough density to support transit and locally-serving commercial amenities.

Auto-focused street design diminish walking and needed "eyes on the street"&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Jane (1961) ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities'', p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; provided by the steady presence of people in an area. Walkability increases social interaction, mixing of populations, average number of friends and associates where people live, reduced crime (with more people walking and watching over neighborhoods, open space and main streets), increased sense of pride, and increased volunteerism.

Socioeconomic factors contribute to willingness to choose walking over driving. Income, age, race, ethnicity, education, household status, and having children in a household all influence walking travel.&lt;ref&gt;Joh, Kenneth, Sandip Chakrabarti, Marlon G Boarnet, and Ayoung Woo. "The Walking Renaissance: A Longitudinal Analysis of Walking Travel in the Greater Los Angeles Area, USA." Sustainability 7, no. 7 (2015): 8985-9011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Increasing walkability==
[[Image:WRA brick row.jpg|thumb|right|A brick paved [[sidewalk]] in [[Hudson, Ohio]].]]
Many communities have embraced [[pedestrian]] mobility as an alternative to older building practices that favor automobiles. Reasons for this shift include a belief that dependency on automobiles is ecologically unsustainable. Automobile-oriented environments engender dangerous conditions to both motorists and pedestrians, and are generally bereft of aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln and London|pages=263–300|url=http://www.greenillusions.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tool that some American cities, like [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, OH]], are employing to improve walkability is a type of zoning called [[Form-based code|Form-based coding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://formbasedcodes.org/codes/cincinnati-form-based-code/|title=Cincinnati Form-Based Code|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Form-Based Codes Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2014/01/21/heres-how-cincinnatis-form-based.html?page=all|title=Here's how Cincinnati's form-based codes are designed to spur redevelopment|last=Yung|first=John|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several ways to make a community more walkable:
* Sidewalks can be implemented where there are "sidewalk gaps", with priority to areas where walking is encouraged, such as around schools or transit stations. Campaigns such as Atlanta, Georgia's safe routes to transit are providing safer access to transit stops for pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://peds.org/issues/safe_crossings/ safe routes to transit]&lt;/ref&gt; When implementing new sidewalks, there are several aspects to consider such as sidewalk width. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that sidewalks be at least five feet in width.&lt;ref&gt;"Accessible Rights-of-Way: A Design Guide," [http://www.access-board.gov/prowac/guide/PROWGuide.htm] 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
* Moving obstructions, like sign posts and utility poles, can increase the walkable width of the sidewalk. Quality maintenance and proper lighting of sidewalks reduces obstructions, improves safety, and encourages walking. 
* Buffers, areas of grass between the street and the sidewalk, also make sidewalks safer. Vegetation from buffers absorbs the carbon dioxide from automobile emissions{{citation needed|date = December 2012}} and assists with water drainage.
* Improving crosswalk safety also increases walkability. [[Curb extension]]s decrease the radii of the corners of the curb at intersections, calm traffic and decrease the distance pedestrians have to cross. On streets with parking, curb extensions allow pedestrians to see oncoming traffic better where they otherwise would be forced to walk into the street to see past parked cars. Striped crosswalks, or [[zebra crossing]]s, also provide safer crossings because they provide better visibility for both drivers and pedestrians.
* New infrastructure and [[pedestrian zone]]s replace roads for better walkability. Cities undertake pedestrian projects for better traffic flow by closing automobile access and only allowing pedestrians to travel through. Projects such as the [[High Line]] and the [[The 606 Trail|606 Trail]] increase walkability by connecting neighborhoods, using landscape architectural elements to create visually aesthetic green space, and allow for physical activity. Towns can also be modified to be [[pedestrian village]]s.
* Monitoring and improving safety in neighborhoods can make walking a more attractive option. Safety is a main concern among children when choosing how to get to and from school.&lt;ref&gt;Banerjee, Tridib et al. "Walking to School: The Experience of Children in Inner City Los Angeles and Implications for Policy." Journal of Planning Education and Research 34, no 2 (2014): 123-140.&lt;/ref&gt; Ensuring safer walking areas by keeping paths well-maintained and well-lit can encourage walkability.
* Walkability increases with density. Density allows for the creation of affordable housing that is closer to an individuals workplace, and other basic needs. This encourages people to walk from place to place which increases their [[health]], and decreases their [[carbon footprint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sustainability Principles and Practice|last=Robertson|first=Margaret|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9780203768747|location=|pages=ppl: 208–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denser cities also create a higher chance for the creating social interactions with communities and social events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD |last=Mariana Darling |first=Emily|year=2017 |title=Space for Community: Cohousing as an Alternative Density Model for Housing Seattle |publisher=University Of Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring walkability ==
{{advert section|date=September 2017}}
One way of assessing and measuring walkability is to undertake a [[walking audit]]. An established and widely used walking audit tool is PERS (Pedestrian Environment Review System) which has been used extensively in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walk21.com/papers/TfL%20TRL%20Walk21%20NYC%202009%20paper%20-%20Identifying%20and%20prioritizing%20walking%20investment%20through%20PERS%20audit%20tool.pdf Davies, A. and Clark, S. (2009) Identifying and prioritising walking investment through the PERS audit tool - Walk21 Proceedings, 10th International Conference for Walking, New York, USA, October 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple way to determine the walkability of a block, corridor or neighborhood is to count the number of people walking, lingering and engaging in optional activities within a space.&lt;ref&gt;Gehl, J. and Gemzoe, L. (1996). ''Public spaces and public life''. Copenhagen: Danish Architectural Press&lt;/ref&gt;  This process is a vast improvement upon pedestrian level of service (LOS) indicators, recommended within the Highway Capacity Manual.&lt;ref&gt;Transportation Research Board (2000). ''Highway capacity manual: HCM2000''. Washington D.C.: National Research Council&lt;/ref&gt; However it may not translate well to non-Western locations where the idea of "optional" activities may be different.&lt;ref&gt;Hutabarat Lo, R. (2009). [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a913307752~tab=content~order=page "Walkability: what is it?"], ''Journal of Urbanism'' Vol. 2, No. 2, pp 145-166.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the diversity of people, and especially the presence of children, seniors and people with disabilities, denotes the quality, completeness and health of a walkable space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Zehner|first = Ozzie|title = Green Illusions|year = 2012|publisher = University of Nebraska Press|location = Lincoln and London|pages = 250–51, 265–66|url = http://www.greenillusions.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of commercial walkability scores also exist:
* [[Walk Score]] is a walkability index based on the distance to amenities such as grocery stores, schools, parks, libraries, restaurants, and coffee shops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceosforcities.org/research/walking-the-walk/ ceosforcities.org, Walking the Walk (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; Walk Score's algorithm awards maximum points to amenities within 5 minutes' walk (.25&amp;nbsp;mi), and a decay function assigns points for amenities up to 30 minutes away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walkscore.com/methodology.shtml Walk Score Methodology]&lt;/ref&gt; Scores are normalized from 0 to 100.
* Walkability is a customizable set of three walk rating indexes with an algorithm that considers factors including street type, intersection complexity, point-of-interest accessibility, population density, freeways and bodies of water.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maponics.com/products/gis-map-data/context/walkability&lt;/ref&gt; Add-on scores include other factors like crime, weather, or public transit, among others.
* Walkonomics is a web app that combines [[open data]] and [[crowdsourcing]] to rate and review the walkability of each street. As of 2011, Walkonomics claimed to have ratings for every street in England (over 600,000 streets) and New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://walkonomics.com/blog/2011/06/rating-walkability-open-data-crowdsourcing/ Rating Walkability by combining Open Data and Crowdsourcing - Walkonomics Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;
* RateMyStreet is a website that uses [[crowdsourcing]], [[Google Maps]] and a five star rating system to allow users to rate the walkability of their local streets. Users can rate a street using eight different categories: Crossing the street, pavement/sidewalk width, trip hazards, wayfinding, safety from crime, road safety, cleanliness/attractiveness, and disabled peoples' access.
* Walkability App developed by Clean Air Asia allows users to rate the walkability of a street qualitatively through 9 parameters. The individual scores are converted to a total out of 100. The average of all the street scores in a city becomes the city score. The parameters assessed include modal conflict, disability infrastructure, perception of safety, availability of crossing points, and motorist behavior, among others.
* State of Place is a predictive analytics software that forecasts the benefits of making places more walkable and livable and allows users to prioritize changes most likely to maximize their specific development goals. The algorithm aggregates over 290 urban design features into an index from 0-100, and breaks that down into individual scores for 10 urban design dimensions known to impact people’s location and consumption choices. The forecast helps cities and developers make the data-driven case for developing better places by quantifying their [[Return on investment|ROI]]. State of Place’s IP includes proprietary algorithms and forecasting models, as well as a growing database of 1.7 million data points and counting across 7000+ blocks.

==Mapping walkability==
A newly developing concept is the transit time map (sometimes called a transit shed map), which is a type of [[isochrone map]].&lt;ref&gt;Dovey, K., Woodcock, I. &amp; Pike, L. (2017) 'Isochrone Mapping of Urban Transport', Planning Practice &amp; Research, 32(4): 402-416. doi: 10.1080/02697459.2017.1329487&lt;/ref&gt;  These are maps (often online and interactive) that display the areas of a metropolis which can be reached from a given starting point, in a given amount of travel time. Such maps are useful for evaluating how well-connected a given address is to other possible urban destinations, or conversely, how large a territory can quickly get to a given address. The calculation of transit time maps is [[computational geometry|computationally intensive]], and considerable work is being done on more efficient [[algorithm]]s for quickly producing such maps. To be useful, the production of a transit time map must take into consideration [[GTFS|detailed transit schedules]], [[headway|service frequency]], time of day, and day of week.&lt;ref name="TTMap"&gt;{{cite web|title=Transit Time Map: Bay Area, 9:00am|url=http://www.walkscore.com/transit-map.php|work=Walk Score|publisher=Walk Score|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mapnificent"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wehrmeyer|first=Stefan|title=Dynamic Public Transport Travel Time Maps|url=http://www.mapnificent.net|work=Mapnificent|publisher=Stefan Wehrmeyer|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roth"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roth|first=Matthew|title=Walk Score Updates Transit Travel Map for Bay Area|url=http://sf.streetsblog.org/2009/03/12/walk-score-updates-transit-travel-map-for-bay-area/|work=sf.streetsblog.org|publisher=streetsblog.org|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite web|last=Walker|first=Jarrett|title=Beyond "transit scores": an exchange with Matt Lerner|url=http://www.humantransit.org/2011/01/beyond-transit-scores-an-exchange-with-matt-lerner.html|work=Human Transit|publisher=humantransit.org|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wehrmeyer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wehrmeyer|first=Stefan|title=A Mapnificent World|url=http://blog.stefanwehrmeyer.com/post/1448498820/a-mapnificent-world|work=On the Things I Do|publisher=stefanwehrmeyer.com|accessdate=25 February 2013|date=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
