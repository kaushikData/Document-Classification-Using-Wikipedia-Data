'''''(I Am) Nobody's Lunch''''' is a 2006 play with music produced by [[The Civilians]], an investigative theater company in New York City. Based on interviews conducted in 2003, the play explores the compromised issues of trust and truth that arose between the American government and its people during the lead-up to the Iraq War. ''(I Am) Nobody's Lunch'' was written and directed by Steve Cosson from interviews by the company, with music and lyrics by [[Michael Friedman (composer)|Michael Friedman]].&lt;ref&gt;Cosson, Steve. ''(I am) Nobody's Lunch/Gone Missing''. Oberon Books, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conception==
''(I Am) Nobody's Lunch'' grew from interviews with people from all over America about what they believe regarding their current government and public culture. When writing about the motivation to create such a work, writer and director Steve Cosson said &lt;blockquote&gt;
"If a democracy depends in part on there being some common understanding of what is actually taking place in the world, then we wanted to know if in fact if such a consensus existed, and if not, then just how are people parsing reality?"&lt;ref name="Cosson 2008"&gt;Cosson, Steve. "(I Am) Nobody's Lunch." ''The Civilians: An Anthology of Six Plays''. New York: Playscripts, Inc., 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Process==
''(I Am) Nobody's Lunch'' is marked by [[The Civilians]]' characteristic journalistic approach to theater, in which the play's foundation is built from a series of individual interviews, usually conducted by the cast members themselves. These interviews are not recorded, and transcribed later from memory. The dialogue from the interviews is then woven verbatim into the script, producing a kind of theater that Brian Logan from The Guardian describes thus: "[[The Civilians]] co-mingle docudrama with cabaret, spinning their interviewees' responses into improbable, inquisitive song-and-soliloquy revues."&lt;ref&gt;Logan, Brian. "True Lies." The Guardian (Thursday, August 10, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Play==
''(I Am) Nobody's Lunch'' takes on the question that was on the minds of many Americans as the Bush Administration began to launch the Iraq War: Who, or what, do we believe? It presents a dynamic range of real-life perspectives from across the country, from an Arab-American cab driver to a staffer at the Department of Homeland Security, everyone in the phone book listed under the name Jessica Lynch, an elderly Jewish woman, and even an alien.&lt;ref name="Cosson 2008"/&gt; According to Sam Marlowe, in his review of ''(I Am) Nobody's Lunch'' when it played at the SoHo Theater in London, the play "considers the impossibility of certainty in a world stuffed with lies." &lt;ref&gt;Marlowe, Sam. "The Trouble With Asian Men/(I am) Nobody's Lunch." The Times (Monday, September 11, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The scenes and monologues from Cosson's script are interspersed with composer [[Michael Friedman (composer)|Michael Friedman]]'s musical numbers, producing a cabaret-like piece of theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Terry. "Satire with a Side of Ham in 'Lunch'." The Boston Herald (Friday, April 28, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production history==
An early version of the play opened in September 2004 and was produced by [[The Civilians]] and presented by Performance Space 122. ''(I Am) Nobody's Lunch'' had its official U.S. Premiere by The Civilians at 59E59 Theaters, New York City, January 19, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Zinoman, Jason. "They Feel a Homeland Security Song Coming On." The New York Times (January 29, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The play then received its London Premiere by The Civilians at Soho Theatre on September 6, 2006, after playing an award-winning run at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival earlier that year.&lt;ref&gt;Quirke, Kieron. "Critic's Choice: Top Five Plays." The Evening Standard (September 15, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; ''(I Am) Nobody's Lunch'' also  toured along the East Coast during April 2006, playing shows at the Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia, PA (April 19 – 23, 2006) and the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, MA (April 25 – 30, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Louise. "Theater troupe gets creative with the facts: For Civilians, interviews are just the start." The Boston Globe (April 23, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public response and recognition==
''(I Am) Nobody's Lunch'' garnered favorable reviews from such publications as ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Isherwood, Charles. "A Funny and Sad Look at Facts, Myths and Spin." The New York Times (January 23, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Boston Globe]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Ed. "Turning the sad truth into spirited satire." The Boston Globe (April 27, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Robert Dawson. "(I am) Nobody's Lunch." The Times (August 18, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The play also won a coveted First Fringe award at the [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]] in 2006 &lt;ref&gt;Eaton, Andrew."Equals among firsts." The Scotsman (December 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; and was named as a Critic's Choice: Top Five Plays selection by The Evening Standard.&lt;ref&gt;Quirke, Kieron. "Critic's Choice: Top Five Plays." The Evening Standard (September 15, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast==
U.S. Premiere: Quincy Tyler Bernstine, Matt Dellapina, Brad Heberlee, Daoud Heidami, Caitlin Miller, Jennifer R. Morris, and Andy Boronson.

London Premiere: Matt Dellapina, Daoud Heidami, Brandon Miller, Caitlin Miller, Lexy Fridell, and Andy Boroson on piano.

Human infections by ''Elizabethkingia anophelis'' involve the bloodstream.&lt;ref name="WDHS1"/&gt; Signs and symptoms can include fever, shortness of breath, chills, and [[cellulitis]].&lt;ref name="WDHS1"/&gt; Confirmation requires a laboratory test.&lt;ref name="WDHS1"/&gt;

Statewide surveillance of the situation in Wisconsin was organized on January 5, 2016.&lt;ref name="WISN12"&gt;WISN 12 News: "[http://www.wisn.com/health/dhs-investigates-bacterial-blood-infection-outbreak/38309806 Cases of blood infection reported in Southeast Wisconsin | 44 cases of ''Elizabethkingia anophelis'' reported since Nov. 1]", March 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Cases had been reported from [[Columbia County, Wisconsin|Columbia]], [[Dane County, Wisconsin|Dane]], [[Dodge County, Wisconsin|Dodge]], [[Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]], [[Jefferson County, Wisconsin|Jefferson]], [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee]], [[Racine County, Wisconsin|Racine]], [[Sauk County, Wisconsin|Sauk]], [[Sheboygan County, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]], [[Washington County, Wisconsin|Washington]], [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha]], and [[Winnebago County, Wisconsin|Winnebago]] counties); Illinois; and western [[Michigan]] as of April 13, 2016.&lt;ref name="WISN12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sarahkaplan"/&gt;

The severity of the outbreak is reflected in a statement by the CDC that "the agency sees a handful of ''Elizabethkingia'' infections around the country each year, but the outbreaks rarely involve more than a couple of cases at a time. To have dozens of cases at once — and more than a third of them possibly fatal — is startling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/cdc-offers-new-call-arms-nightmare-bacteria/ |title=CDC offers new call to arms on nightmare bacteria |website=PBS NewsHour |date= |accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11803">The '''2018 Washington Veterans Day Parade''' (colloquially called "Trump's military parade") was a planned military parade that would have taken place in [[Washington, D.C.]] on 10 November 2018 in honor of the [[Veterans Day]] holiday (which will take place on 11 November). On August 16, 2018, it was announced that the military parade would be postponed until 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=News |first1=ABC |title=Trump's military parade is postponed until 2019 |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-military-parade-estimated-cost-92-million/story?id=57218363 |accessdate=17 August 2018 |work=ABC News |date=16 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cancelling the parade for 2018, Trump cited the projected high costs for the parade and blamed Washington DC city officials for the high projected costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna901576|title=Trump cancels military parade, blames D.C. officials for high cost|date=August 17, 2018|publisher=[[NBC News]]|first=Dartunorro|last=Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The parade was expected to include members of all five armed services; the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] and the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], with other units that were to be dressed in period uniforms representing earlier times in the United States military history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/18/trump-military-parade-plans-unravel-over-costs.html|title=Trump military parade plans unravel over costs|date=2018-08-18|work=Fox News|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memo from [[Joseph Dunford|General Joseph Dunford]] reported that the parade was to have focused on historic battles and conflicts such as the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://abc7news.com/politics/trumps-military-parade-could-cost-$12-million-official/3783554/|title=Trump's military parade could cost $12 million: Official|date=2018-07-18|work=ABC7 San Francisco|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 5,000 and 7,000 service members were to have taken part in the parade, which was to begin at the [[U.S. Capitol]] and end at the [[White House]]. The evolution of women in the service was also to be highlighted in the parade, along with an emphasis on the price of freedom.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ausa.org/news/details-emerging-dc-veterans-day-parade|title=Details Emerging on D.C.

This Year; Pentagon Looking At Dates In 2019|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Medal of Honor]] recipients would have been included in reviewing the parade with the President and would have marched in the parade.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The parade would also have coincided with the 100th anniversary of the end of [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was to have been the first full scale parade in the nation's capital since [[National Victory Celebration|1991]] involving the men and women of the active and reserve components of the [[United States Armed Forces]] and veterans' organizations and the first national Veterans' Day parade in years. U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] requested the military parade following his admiration of the [[Bastille Day military parade]] at the [[Champs-Élysées]] in [[Paris]] which he attended in 2017. 

=== Cancellation of 2018 parade ===
On August 17, 2018 U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] stated he canceled the parade due to the "ridiculous" $92 million price tag.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2018/08/17/Trump-slams-92M-tab-for-canceled-Veterans-Day-parade-in-Washington/2111534512756/?rc_fifo=1|title=Trump slams D.C. officials for parade's 'ridiculous' $92M price tag|work=UPI|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Twitter he blamed local politicians for the price and suggested hosting another parade in 2019, and ended his tweets with; "Maybe we will do something next year in D.C. when the cost comes WAY DOWN. Now we can buy some more jet fighters!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-45225102|title=Trump cancels military parade over costs|date=2018-08-17|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of Trump's statements, Budget Director [[Mick Mulvaney]] claimed that the cancellation was not just for reasons of cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mulvaney on canceled military parade: It wasn’t just the money|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/19/mulvaney-trump-military-parade-788157|first= Rebecca |last =Morin|date=August 19, 2018|publisher=[[Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cost ==
A Pentagon official estimated the cost of the parade between $3 million and $50 million, earlier in 2018.&lt;ref name="nola.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/estimated-5000-7000-service-members-march-trumps-military/story?id=56715855|title=5,000 to 7,000 service members to march in Trump's military parade: Source|last=McLaughlin|first=Elizabeth|date=July 20, 2018|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/policy/defense/398109-thousands-of-service-members-to-participate-in-trumps-military-parade-report|title=Thousands of service members to participate in Trump's military parade: report|last=Bowden|first=John|date=20 July 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/09/592528659/trumps-military-parade-is-set-for-veterans-day|title=Trump's Military Parade Is Set For Veterans Day|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggestion of the cost was closer to $92 million, with at least $50 million being used to cover Pentagon costs for aircraft, equipment, personnel, and other support. This number was refuted by Defense Secretary [[Jim Mattis]] who stated; "I'm not dignifying that number ($92 million) with a reply."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/washington-dc/articles/2018-08-16/official-says-trumps-military-parade-would-cost-about-92m|title=Pentagon Delays Trump's Military Parade Until at Least 2019|last=Baldor|first=Lolita|date=August 16, 2018|website=U.S. News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The $92 million estimate was to be divided between the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] and the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], which would have contributed $50 million and $42 million respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Separately DC City officials estimated expenses related to the parade would have been $21.6 million with an expectation for reimbursement from the Federal government, with the Mayor of Washington DC [[Muriel Bowser]] reporting that $13 million would have been used alone to cover police costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/the-latest-trump-blames-dc-for-military-parade-cancellation/2018/08/17/f3f8a6b0-a27a-11e8-a3dd-2a1991f075d5_story.html|title=The Latest: Trump blames DC for military parade cancellation|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opinion of parade ==

=== Support ===
In February 2017, few lawmakers backed the idea of a military parade. [[David Perdue|Senator David Perdue]] a Republican of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] told reporters "He's the President of the United States. Personally, I would prefer not to do it. But he's the president."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/us/politics/trump-military-parade-america.html|title=Trump Wants a Military Parade. But Not Everyone Is in Step.|last=Gibbons-Neff|first=Thomas|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Lindsey Graham]] a Republican of [[South Carolina]], supported the parade if it honored the military itself, and not the  "...[[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-style hardware display."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[AMVETS]] an group that advocates for military veterans felt that potentially the parade would inspire more Americans to join the armed forces.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/02/07/584059931/veterans-are-divided-on-response-to-trumps-desire-for-military-parade|title=Veterans Are Divided On Response To Trump's Desire For Military Parade|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Against ===
Other politicians spoke out against the parade. Representative [[Adam Smith (politician)|Adam Smith]] a Democrat of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and members of the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Armed Services Committee]] released a statement that highlighted "A military parade like this - one that is unduly focused on a single person - is what [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian regimes]] do, not democracies."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Senator [[John Kennedy (Louisiana politician)|John Kennedy]] a Republican of [[Louisiana]] told reporters "We're not [[North Korea]], we're not [[Russia]], and we're not [[China]] and I don't want to be." while speaking out against the proposed parade.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/the-conversation/sd-trump-military-parade-has-put-america-odds-20180208-htmlstory.html|title=What veterans in San Diego and elsewhere think of a Trump military parade|last=Gomez|first=Luis|work=sandiegouniontribune.com|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert J. O'Neill (U.S. Navy SEAL)|Robert O'Neill]] a former [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] tweeted in February 2018 that any military parade would be "...third world bullshit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/mchooyah/status/961644132119859200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=https://www.vox.com/world/2018/2/8/16991644/trump-military-parade-navy-seal-tweet|title=Robert J. O'Neill on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other military veterans echoed the sentiment with calls for the money to be spent on housing, employment and mental health care to better support the troops.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A veteran of the [[War in Afghanistan]] highlighted that it would seem unreasonable to hold a parade in celebration while a 17 year-old war (per 2018) was still on going.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Events==
===June===
The 416 Fire started around 10:00 a.m. on June 1, 2018, approximately 10 miles north of [[Durango, Colorado]] and west of [[U.S. Route 550|Highway 550]]. By the morning of June 2, the fire had expanded into the [[San Juan National Forest]] and had burned an estimated {{Convert|1100|acre|ha|0}}. The highway was closed between milemarkers 34 and 48 for public safety and to allow firefighters to keep the fire from crossing the highway. County Road 250 was also closed. Evacuation orders were put in place for residents of Baker's Bridge at County Road 250 north to Electra Lake Road, where 825 structures are threatened.&lt;ref name="InciWeb62am"&gt;{{cite web |title=416 Fire Update for June 2, 2018&amp;nbsp;— InciWeb the Incident Information System |url=https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/5822/43050/ |website=InciWeb |publisher=United States Forest Service |access-date=5 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the evening of June 3, the fire had grown to {{Convert|2255|acre|ha|0}} and was 10 percent contained. It expanded Hermosa Creek, prompting officials to issue pre-evacuation orders to the community of Hermosa.&lt;ref name="InciWeb63pm"&gt;{{cite web |title=416 Fire Update June 3, 2018 pm&amp;nbsp;— InciWeb the Incident Information System |url=https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/5822/43076/ |website=InciWeb |publisher=United States Forest Service |access-date=5 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the fire showed significant activity due to winds. Highway 550 was again closed due to heavy smoke and fire teams focused on building defensible spaces around buildings and using controlled burns as needed.&lt;ref name="IW64PM"&gt;{{cite web |title=416 Fire Update for June 4, 2018 pm&amp;nbsp;— InciWeb the Incident Information System |url=https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/5822/43080/ |website=InciWeb |publisher=United States Forest Service |access-date=5 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire is at 10 percent containment.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=Blair |title=416 Fire burning in southwest Colorado remains 10% contained at 2,400 acres |url=https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/wildfire/416-fire-burning-in-southwest-colorado-remains-10-contained-at-2-400-acres |website=7NEWS |access-date=5 June 2018 |date=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 5, new pre-evacuation orders were put in place for areas east of Hermosa due to southerly winds keeping the flames on the ridgeline on the slopes near the community. Temperatures were hotter than average and Forest Service personnel cited increased drought conditions as creating additional challenges.&lt;ref name="InciWeb65PM"&gt;{{cite web |title=416 Fire Evening Update June 5, 2018&amp;nbsp;— InciWeb the Incident Information System |url=https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/5822/43102/ |website=InciWeb |publisher=United States Forest Service |access-date=6 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crews continued to fight the fire using aerial support.&lt;ref name="IW627"&gt;{{cite web |title=June 27, 2018- Evening 416 Fire Update&amp;nbsp;— InciWeb the Incident Information System |url=https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/5822/43503/ |website=inciweb.nwcg.gov |access-date=29 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burrow Fire began on the opposite side of the Hermosa Creek Wilderness Area on June 8th&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/5822/43503/|title=June 27, 2018- Evening 416 Fire Update&amp;nbsp;— InciWeb the Incident Information System|last=helpdesk@dms.nwcg.gov|first=InciWeb developed and maintained by USDA Forest Service, Fire and Aviation Management,|website=inciweb.nwcg.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As of July 2, 2018 the fire had spread to within 10 miles of the 416 fire and burned over {{Convert|4000|acre|ha|0}}&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

By June 29, the 416 fire had expanded to {{Convert|41617|acre|ha|0}} and was 37 percent contained. The fire continued moving north, with crews clearing and chipping brush piles along the [[Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad]]. Burnouts continued in the southwest in No Buck Creek.&lt;ref name="IW628"&gt;{{cite web |title=June 29, 2018- 416 Fire Morning Update&amp;nbsp;— InciWeb the Incident Information System |url=https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/5822/43524/ |website=inciweb.nwcg.gov |access-date=29 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===July===
By July 1, the fire had grown to {{Convert|49301|acre|ha|0}} and was 37 percent contained. Temperatures enabled crews to focus on containment in the south and southwestern side of the fire, while northwest winds caused smokey conditions for communities along Highway 550, including [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] and Hermosa Creek. Concerns about the fire impacting the [[Purgatory Resort]] were reduced, however hotshot crews remained in the area to protect the resort, if needed.&lt;ref name="IW7118" /&gt;

== Impact ==
Over 1300 homes and businesses were forced to evacuate due to the fire&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2018/06/09/416-fire-wildfire-durango-june-9-weekend/|title=1,300 homes evacuated as 416 fire north of Durango grows|date=2018-06-09|work=The Denver Post|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As of July 2, no businesses or homes have been destroyed by the fire.

The fire forced the closure of [[Purgatory Resort|Purgatory Ski Resort]], [[Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad|Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad]], and the [[San Juan National Forest]], as well as sporadic closures of [[U.S. Route 550|Highway 550]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.firehouse.com/operations-training/wildland/news/21008878/san-juan-national-forest-closes-co-416-wildfire-grows|title=CO Blaze Shuts Down San Juan National Forest|work=Firehouse|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.durango.org/current-fire-information-and-updates/|title=Current Fire Information and Updates {{!}} Official Tourism Site of Durango, Colorado|website=www.durango.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theknow.denverpost.com/2018/06/05/durango-and-silverton-narrow-gauge-railroad-2018-fire-cancelations/186507/|title=More Narrow Gauge Railroad rides canceled as fire burns near Durango|date=2018-06-05|work=The Know|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.codot.gov/news/2018/june/us-550-closed-north-of-durango-due-to-the-416-fire|title=US 550 Closed North of Durango Due to "The 416 Fire" —|website=www.codot.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The July 4th cancelations and highway, rail, and trail closures have devastated the tourism industry of Silverton, and has had a substantial impact on the economies of Durango and elsewhere in southwest Colorado&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kob.com/new-mexico-news/416-fire-affecting-durango-silverton-economy/4942486/|title=416 Fire affecting Durango, Silverton economy|work=KOB 4|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''IEEE International Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (ARITH)''' is a conference in the area of computer arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arithsymposium.org/  ARITH Symposium Website]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The symposium was established in 1969, initially as three-year event, then as a
biennial event, and, finally, from 2015 as an annual symposium.

ARITH topics span from theoretical aspects and [[algorithm]]s for operations, to hardware implementations of arithmetic units and applications of computer arithmetic.

ARITH symposia are sponsored by [[IEEE Computer Society]].

The videos projected simultaneously that comprise [[Kimsooja]]’s ''A Needle Woman'' (1999) presents the artist wearing precisely the same clothes, standing precisely the same way, and, it would seem, at the same time of day in various urban environments.&lt;ref name=Madoff&gt;Madoff, Steven Henry, “Gnomon of Place, Gnomon of foreignness.” Host &amp; Guest catalogue for group exhibition at Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
== History ==
A Needle Woman premiered at CCA Kitakyushu in 1999. In the Kitakyshu version the artist presented a video channel where she lied on top of a rock formation, as Kimsooja explained “When I was invited to make a new commissioned work at the Center for Contemporary Art in Kitakyushu, Japan, I thought I would do a performance piece - one in the city of Tokyo, and the other one in nature. Then I would juxtapose them together. (…) As a result one was standing still in the middle of a crowd, while the other was lying down on a rock, facing nature. Verticality and horizontality were a metaphor for a dynamic balance between urban and natural forces.” &lt;ref&gt;Ingrid Commandeur, Kimsooja: Black holes, Meditative Vanishings and Nature as a Mirror of the Universe, in Windflower, Perceptions of Nature, NAI and Kroller-Muller Museum ,2012&lt;/ref&gt;In further installations of ''A Needle Woman'' Kimsooja focused on the urban aspect of the work and shot a number of new videos where she stood absolutely still, her back facing the camera, amid passing crowds of inhabitants in Patan, Nepal; Havana, Cuba; N’Djamena, Chad; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Sana’a, Yemen; Jerusalem, Israel.&lt;ref name=Madoff/&gt; 

Kimsooja in these videos is often described as a nomadic figure traveling across the world to come to rest in a crowded thoroughfare. The Needle referred to in the title is Kimsooja theorizing herself as a needle passing through the fabric of a place and its people. A common feature of the locations visited in the work is that they are all places of violence, disrepair or unresolved conflict; lending to the needle a metaphoric function as an instrument of suture and healing.&lt;ref name=Madoff/&gt; Subsequent versions of ''A Needle Woman'' were shown at [[MoMA PS1]] Contemporary art center in 2001, at the [[Kunsthalle Bern]] in Bern Switzerland in 2001, for the 51st [[Venice Biennale]] as part of the [[Arsenale]] in 2005, and was projected as a single channel public art project for La Nuit Blanche on the facade of [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hotel de Ville]], Paris in 2009 &lt;ref&gt;Kimsooja Biography: http://www.kimsooja.com/biography.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6623">'''Art cycling in Millstatt''' (German: "KUNSTradln in Millstatt") is an international [[art exhibition]] in [[Millstatt]] am See ([[Carinthia]]/[[Austria]]). It takes the form of various art stations throughout Millstatt connected by a cycle route.

== Concept and organization ==
The exhibition debuts 2018 from May 11 to October 28, and will be repeated in the following years. It has 25 stops at various locations in the community of Millstatt. These art stations form a loop through Millstatt, which can be visited by art-interested visitors, either walking or cycling the trail (hence the name "Art cycling in Millstatt"). Works by approximately 65 internationally known artists from [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[United States]], [[Switzerland]], [[Croatia]], [[Poland]], [[Greece]], [[South Korea]] and [[Guatemala]] are connected in the exhibition.

For the first time, this exhibition concept also combines the various existing art and cultural institutions in Millstatt in a joint program. In addition, the concept opens up a number of new and sometimes unusual places in Millstatt as a presentation opportunity for [[modern art]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kleinezeitung.at/kultur/5444177/Kunstradln-in-Millstatt_Fuer-die-Kunst-in-die-Pedale-treten Newspaper article in the Austrian statewide journal "Kleine Zeitung" (in German)], accessed July 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The access to modern art at [[art museum]]s, [[art exhibition]]s and [[Art gallery|art galleries]] is often characterized by the fact that only an art-interested and art-oriented [[audience]] is able or wanting to participate.&lt;ref&gt;see Bresler, Liora (ed.): International Handbook of Research in Arts Education, Dordrecht 2007; Springer, {{ISBN|9781402029981}}, vol. 2, pp. 941ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The project "Art cycling in Millstatt" provides a low-threshold mediating of art as follows:
#by giving access over a long period (6 months)
#by using Millstatt as a whole as [[Arts centre|art space]] for residents and guests alike
#by inviting a non-predefined art audience to participate, including randomly passing people (and cyclists too), who can and may come into contact with art in this way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ktn.gv.at/Service/News?nid=28432 Informations by the culture department of the Austrian federal state of Carinthia], accessed July 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stations and artists ==
There are 25 stations and 65 artists represented at the project.&lt;ref&gt;see the guidebook of the project: [https://www.yumpu.com/de/KUNSTradln Brochure „KUNSTradln“ (in German), accessed June 1, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4346">'''Brumalia''' ({{lang-la|Brumalia}}, {{IPA-la|bruːˈmaːlɪ.a|}}, "winter festivals")  was an [[ancient Roman]], [[winter solstice]] [[festival]] honouring [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]/[[Cronus]] and [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]]/[[Demeter]], and [[Bacchus]] in some cases. By the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine era]], celebrations commenced on 24 November and lasted for a month, until [[Saturnalia]] and the "Waxing of the Light". The festival included night-time feasting, drinking, and merriment. During this time, prophetic indications were taken as prospects for the remainder of the winter. The festival was celebrated as late as the 6th century, until emperor [[Justinian]]'s [[Justinian I#Suppression of religions|repression of paganism]].{{sfn|Mazza|2011|pp=172-193}}{{sfn|John the Lydian|2009}}{{sfn|Crawford|1914}}

==Etymology==
The name of Brumalia comes from {{lang|la|[[wikt:bruma#Latin|brvma]]}}, {{IPA-la|ˈbruːma|}}, "Winter solstice", "Winter cold"; a shortening of {{lang|la|[[wikt:brevis#Latin|*brevima]]}}, {{IPA-la|ˈbrɛwɪma|}}, presumed obsolete superlative form of {{smallcaps|''[[wikt:brevis#Latin|brevis]]''}}, later {{lang|la|[[wikt:brevissimus#Latin|brevissima]]}} ("smallest", "shallowest", "briefest").

==Overview==
Roman life, during [[classical antiquity]], centred on the [[Roman army|military]], [[Roman agriculture|agriculture]], and hunting. The short, cold days of [[winter]] would halt most forms of work. Brumalia was a festival celebrated during this ''dark'', interludal period. It was [[chthonic]] in character and associated with [[crops]], of which seeds are [[sown]] in the ground before sprouting.{{sfn|John the Lydian|2009}}

Farmers would [[animal sacrifice|sacrifice]] pigs to Saturn and Ceres. [[viticulture|Vine-growers]] would sacrifice goats in honor of [[Bacchus]]—for the goat is an enemy of the vine; and they would skin them, fill the skin-bags with air and jump on them. Civic officials would bring offerings of [[firstfruits]] (including wine, olive oil, grain, and honey) to the priests of Ceres.{{sfn|John the Lydian|2009}}

Although Brumalia was still celebrated as late as the 6th century, it was uncommon and celebrants were ostracised by the Christian church. However, some practices did persist as November and December time customs.{{sfn|John the Lydian|2009}}

In later times, Romans would greet each other with words of blessing at night, "{{lang|la|Vives annos}}", "Live for years".{{sfn|John the Lydian|2009}}

==Contemporary celebration==

|motive=(presumed:) Hatred for ''Hebdo's'' cartoons joking about [[Islam]]ic leaders; attempting to shut down ''Charlie Hebdo''. (Presumably inspired by [[Islamic extremism|extremist Islamic]] group [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]].)}}

&lt;!-- Per MOS:BOLDTITLE and WP:SBE, neither the article's title nor related text appears in bold. --&gt;On 7 January 2015 at about 11:30 local time, two brothers, Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, forced their way into the offices of the French [[List of satirical magazines|satirical weekly newspaper]] ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' in Paris. Armed with rifles and other weapons, they killed 12 people and injured 11 others. The gunmen identified themselves as belonging to the [[Islamist]] terrorist group [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula|Al-Qaeda's branch in Yemen]], which took responsibility for the attack. [[January 2015 Île-de-France attacks|Several related attacks]] followed in the [[Île-de-France]] region on 7–9 January 2015, including the [[Hypercacher kosher supermarket siege]] where a terrorist held 19 hostages, of whom he murdered 4 [[Jews]].

France raised its [[Vigipirate]] terror alert and deployed soldiers in Île-de-France and [[Picardy]]. A major [[Manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] led to the discovery of the suspects, who exchanged fire with police. The brothers took hostages at a signage company in [[Dammartin-en-Goële]] on 9 January and were shot dead when they emerged from the building firing.

On 11 January, about two million people, including more than 40 world leaders, met in Paris for a [[Republican marches|rally of national unity]], and 3.7 million people joined demonstrations across France. The phrase ''[[Je suis Charlie]]'' became a common slogan of support at the rallies and in social media. {{anchor|charlie-hebdo-issue-after-shooting}} The staff of ''Charlie Hebdo'' continued with the publication, and [[Charlie Hebdo issue No. 1178|the following issue]] print ran 7.95 million copies in six languages, compared to its typical print run of 60,000 in only French.

''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' ({{IPA-fr|ʃaʁli ɛbdo|}}; French for ''Charlie Weekly'') is a [[France|French]] [[List of satirical magazines|satirical weekly newspaper]] that features cartoons, reports, [[polemic]]s, and jokes.

''Charlie Hebdo'' has a history of attracting controversy.

===''Laïcité'' and blasphemy===
{{see also|Laïcité|Islam and blasphemy}}
In France, [[Blasphemy law#France|blasphemy law]] ceased to exist with progressive emancipation of the Republic from the Catholic church between 1789 and 1830.  In France, the principle of ''[[laïcité]]''&amp;nbsp;– the [[separation of church and state]]&amp;nbsp;– was enshrined in the [[1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]], and in 1945 became part of the constitution.  Under its terms, the government and all public administrations and services must be religion-blind and their representatives must refrain from any display of religion, but private citizens and organisations are free to practise and express the religion of their choice where and as they wish (although discrimination based on religion is prohibited).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000508749|title=Loi du 9 décembre 1905 concernant la séparation des Eglises et de l'Etat. Version consolidée au 08 avril 2015|publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there has been a trend towards a stricter interpretation of laïcité which would also prohibit users of public services from expressing their religion (e.g. the 2004 law which bans school pupils from wearing "blatant" religious symbols&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/2004/21/MENG0401138C.htm|title=Bulletin Officiel du Ministère de l'Education Nationale du 27 mai 2004. RESPECT DE LA LAÏCITÉ Port de signes ou de tenues manifestant une appartenance religieuse dans les écoles, collèges et lycées publics|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or even ban citizens from expressing their religion in public even outside the administration and public services (e.g. a 2015 law project prohibiting the wearing of religious symbols by the employees of private crèches). This restrictive interpretation is not supported by the initial law on laïcité and is challenged by the representatives of all the major religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-croix.com/Actualite/France/Laicite-la-France-en-plein-doute-2015-03-11-1290093|title=Laïcité, la France en plein doute|publisher=La Croix|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors, humorists, cartoonists and individuals have the right to satirise people, public actors and religions, a right which is balanced by defamation laws. These rights and legal mechanisms were designed to protect [[freedom of speech]] from local powers, among which was the then-powerful [[Roman Catholicism in France|Catholic Church in France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewashingtonreview.org/articles/secularism-in-turkey-france-and-the-united-states.html |title=Secularism in Turkey, France, and the United States |date=September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930103454/http://www.thewashingtonreview.org/articles/secularism-in-turkey-france-and-the-united-states.html |archivedate=30 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack==

===''Charlie Hebdo'' headquarters===
On the morning of 7 January 2015, a Wednesday, Charlie Hebdo staff were gathered at 10 [[Rue Nicolas-Appert]] in the [[11th arrondissement of Paris]] for the weekly editorial meeting starting around 10:30.  The magazine had moved into an unmarked office at this address following the 2011 firebombing of their previous premises.

Around 11:30, two armed and hooded men burst first into the wrong address at number 6 Rue Nicolas-Appert, shouting "Is this ''Charlie Hebdo''?" and threatening people.  After realising their mistake and firing a bullet through a glass door, the two men left for number 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2015/01/08/vous-allez-payer-car-vous-avez-insulte-le-prophete_4551820_3224.html | title=Attentat à "Charlie Hebdo" : "Vous allez payer car vous avez insulté le Prophète"|publisher=Le Monde|date=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, they encountered cartoonist [[Coco (cartoonist)|Corinne "Coco" Rey]] outside. They used threats to force her to key in the passcode to the door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Charlie Hebdo: Le témoignage de la dessinatrice Coco|url=https://www.humanite.fr/charlie-hebdo-le-temoignage-de-la-dessinatrice-coco-562041|work=[[L'Humanité]] |date=7 January 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Escape===
[[File:Charlie-Hebdo-2015-1.JPG|thumbnail|Police vans arrive on the scene]]
An authenticated video surfaced on the Internet that shows two gunmen and a police officer, Ahmed Merabet, who is wounded and lying on a sidewalk after an exchange of gunfire. This took place near the corner of [[Boulevard Richard-Lenoir]] and Rue Moufle, {{Convert|180|m}} east of the main crime scene. One of the gunmen ran towards the policeman and shouted, "Did you want to kill us?" The policeman answered, "No, it's fine, boss", and raised his hand toward the gunman, who then gave the policeman a fatal shot to the head at close range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lci.tf1.fr/france/faits-divers/attentat-a-charlie-hebdo-le-scenario-de-la-tuerie-8543818.html |title=Attentat à Charlie Hebdo: le scénario de la tuerie |author=S.L |date=7 January 2015 |work=MYTF1NEWS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304045858/http://lci.tf1.fr/france/faits-divers/attentat-a-charlie-hebdo-le-scenario-de-la-tuerie-8543818.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sam Kiley, of [[Sky News]], concluded from the video that the two gunmen were "military professionals" who likely had "combat experience", saying that the gunmen were exercising infantry tactics such as moving in "mutual support" and were firing aimed, single-round shots at the police officer. He also stated that they were using military gestures and were "familiar with their weapons" and fired "carefully aimed shots, with tight groupings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qblm57WWMbU|title=What Videos Tell Us About Charlie Hebdo Paris Attack Gunmen|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gunmen then left the scene, shouting (according to witnesses), "We have avenged the Prophet Muhammad.

===Motive===
''Charlie Hebdo'' had attracted attention for its controversial [[depictions of Muhammad]].
Hatred for ''Charlie Hebdo''{{'}}s cartoons, which made jokes about Islamic leaders as well as the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], is considered to be the principal motive for the massacre.  [[Michael Morell]], former deputy director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], suggested that the motive of the attackers was {{nobreak|"absolutely}} clear: trying to shut down a media organisation that lampooned the Prophet Muhammad".&lt;ref name="nytimes2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/world/europe/charlie-hebdo-paris-shooting.html?_r=0|title=Terrorists Strike Charlie Hebdo Newspaper in Paris, Leaving 12 Dead|date=7 January 2015|work=The New York Times|accessdate=8 January 2015|first1=Dan|last1=Bilefsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, [[Al-Qaeda]]'s branch in Yemen, commonly known as [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]] (AQAP), released a hit list in an edition of their English-language magazine ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]]''. The list included [[Charb|Stéphane Charbonnier]] (mentioned above in this article as Charlie Hebdo editor who died in this shooting) and others whom AQAP accused of insulting Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Has al-Qaeda Struck Back?

|date=8 January 2015|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theage-aqap" /&gt;
On 9 January, AQAP claimed responsibility for the attack in a speech from AQAP's top Shariah cleric [[Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari]], citing the motive as "revenge for the honor" of Muhammad.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Al-Qaeda Group Claims Responsibility for Paris Terror Attack|url=http://time.com/3661650/charlie-hebdo-paris-terror-attack-al-qaeda/|date=9 January 2015|accessdate=14 January 2015|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon leaving prison, Chérif Kouachi married and got a job in a fish market on the outskirts of Paris. He became a student of Farid Benyettou, a radical Muslim preacher at the Addawa Mosque in the [[19th arrondissement of Paris]].

French judicial documents state Amedy Coulibaly and Chérif Kouachi travelled with their wives in 2010 to central France to visit Djamel Beghal. In a police interview in 2010, Coulibaly identified Chérif as a friend he had met in prison and said they saw each other frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/01/08/world/europe/ap-eu-france-attack-suspects.html|title=French Probe Terror Suspect Links; New Attacks May Be Ahead|work=The New York Times|accessdate=23 February 2015|date=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Kouachi brothers were named in connection with a plot to break out from jail another Islamist, Smaïn Aït Ali Belkacem.

From 2009 to 2010, Saïd Kouachi visited Yemen on a student visa to study at the [[San'a Institute for the Arabic Language]]. There, according to a Yemeni reporter who interviewed Saïd, he met and befriended [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]], the perpetrator of the attempted bombing of [[Northwest Airlines Flight 253]] later in 2009.

Neighbours described him as solitary.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The weapons used in the attack were supplied via the Brussels [[Black market|underworld]]. According to the Belgian press, a criminal sold Amedy Coulibaly the rocket-propelled grenade launcher and Kalashnikov rifles that the Kouachi brothers used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/world/1.637034 Belgian arms dealer confesses to supplying Paris attackers] ''Haaretz''. 14 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview between Chérif Kouachi and Igor Sahiri, one of France's BFMTV journalists, Chérif stated that "We are not killers. We are defenders of the prophet, we don’t kill women. We kill no one. We defend the prophet. If someone offends the prophet then there is no problem, we can kill him. We don’t kill women. We are not like you.

==== After the attack: Manhunt (8 and 9 January) ====
A massive [[Manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] began immediately after the attack. One suspect left his [[National identity card (France)|ID card]] in an abandoned getaway car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/charlie-hebdo-attack-hunt-continues-for-three-gunmen-who-massacred-12-journalists-and-police-9963499.html|title=Charlie Hebdo attack: Paris police name three suspects in manhunt as Kouachi brothers and surrendered 18-year-old 'accomplice'|work=The Independent | location=London|first1=Lizzie|last1=Dearden|first2=John|last2=Lichfield|first3=Cahal|last3=Milmo|date=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3657314/paris-shooting-charlie-hebdo/|title=Police Identify Suspects in Paris Shooting That Killed 12|date=7 January 2015|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police officers searched apartments in the Île-de-France region, in [[Strasbourg]] and in [[Reims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/societe/charlie-hebdo-perquisitions-a-reims-strasbourg-pantin-et-gennevilliers-07-01-2015-1894796_23.php|title="Charlie Hebdo": perquisitions à Reims, Strasbourg, Pantin et Gennevilliers|author=Le Point, magazine|work=Le Point.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/attentat-a-charlie-hebdo-les-policiers-de-l-anti-gang-investissent-deux-appartements-07-01-2015-4426801.php#xtref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.fr%2F|title=Attentat à Charlie Hebdo|date=7 January 2015|work=Le Parisien|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police detained several people during the manhunt for the two main suspects. A third suspect voluntarily reported to a police station after hearing he was wanted, and was not charged. Police described the assailants as "armed and dangerous".  France raised its [[Vigipirate|terror alert]] to its highest level and deployed soldiers in [[Île-de-France]] and [[Picardy]] [[Regions of France|regions]].

At 10:30 CET on 8 January, the day following the attack, the two primary suspects were spotted in [[Aisne]], north-east of Paris. Armed security forces, including the [[National Gendarmerie Intervention Group]] (GIGN) and the [[Force d'intervention de la police nationale]] (FIPN), were deployed to the department to search for the suspects.&lt;ref name="guardian_policeop"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Willsher |first1=Kim |last2=Topping |first2=Alexandra |date=8 January 2015 |title=Police converge on area north-east of Paris in hunt for Charlie Hebdo gunmen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/08/police-security-cordon-paris-hunt-charlie-hebdo-killers |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=8 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that day, the police search concentrated on the Picardy, particularly the area around [[Villers-Cotterêts]] and the village of [[Longpont]], after the suspects robbed a petrol station near Villers-Cotterêts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/08/europe/charlie-hebdo-paris-shooting/|title=Charlie Hebdo attack: Hunt for killers focuses on northern France|date=8 January 2015|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; then reportedly abandoned their car before hiding in a forest near Longpont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/charlie-hebdo/attentat-a-charlie-hebdo-deux-suspects-localises-dans-l-aisne-08-01-2015-4428657.php|title=Attentat à Charlie Hebdo: la traque se concentre près de Villers-Cotterêts|date=8 January 2015|work=Le Parisien|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Searches continued into the surrounding [[Forest of Retz|Forêt de Retz]] (130&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), one of the largest [[List of forests in France#Picardy|forests of France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/charlie-hebdo-attack-seven-arrested-as-french-police-continue-manhunt-for-two-suspected-gunmen-9964137.html|title=Charlie Hebdo attack: Hundreds of elite armed police comb woodland in hunt for two suspects|author1=John Lichfield |author2=Rose Troup Buchanan |author3=Cahal Milmo |work=The Independent|date=8 January 2015|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manhunt continued with the discovery of the two fugitive suspects early in the morning of 9 January. The Kouachis had hijacked a [[Peugeot 206]] near the town of [[Crépy-en-Valois]]. They were chased by police cars for approximately {{convert|27|km|mi|abbr=off}} south down the N2 trunk road. At some point they abandoned their vehicle and an exchange of gunfire between pursuing police and the brothers took place near the commune of [[Dammartin-en-Goële]], {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=off}} northeast of Paris. Several blasts went off as well and Saïd Kouachi sustained a minor neck wound. Several others may have been injured as well but no one was killed in the gunfire. The suspects were not apprehended and escaped on foot.&lt;ref name="BBClive"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-30722098|title=Charlie Hebdo attack: Manhunt – live reporting|publisher=BBC News|date=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dammartin-en-Goële hostage crisis, death of Chérif and Saïd (9 January)====
At around 9:30&amp;nbsp;am on 9 January, 2015, the Kouachi brothers fled into the office of Création Tendance Découverte, a signage production company on an industrial estate in Dammartin-en-Goële&lt;!-- , at {{Coord|49.063122|2.694095|type:landmark_scale:5000}} --&gt;. Inside the building were owner Michel Catalano and a male employee, 26-year-old graphics designer Lilian Lepère. Catalano told Lepère to go hide in the building and remained in his office himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2015/01/10/01016-20150110ARTFIG00123-dammartin-en-goele-le-gerant-raconte-son-face-a-face-avec-les-freres-kouachi.php|title="J'ai vécu un moment incroyable" : le récit du gérant de l'imprimerie, otage des frères Kouachi |publisher=Figaro.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after, a salesman named Didier went to the printworks on business. Catalano came out with Chérif Kouachi who introduced himself as a police officer. They shook hands and Kouachi told Didier, "Leave. We don't kill civilians anyhow." These words were what caused Didier to guess that Kouachi was a terrorist and he alerted the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11335161/Frenchman-says-he-came-face-to-face-with-Charlie-Hebdo-attacker-I-shook-his-hand.html|title=Frenchman says he came face to face with Charlie Hebdo attacker: 'I shook his hand' |work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London|date=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kouachi brothers remained inside and a lengthy standoff began.

An Interior Ministry spokesman announced that the Ministry wished first to "establish a dialogue" with the suspects.

On the night of 8 January, police commissioner Helric Fredou, who had been investigating the attack, committed [[suicide]] in his office in [[Limoges]] while he was preparing his report shortly after meeting with the family of one of the victims.

===Denmark===
{{Main article|2015 Copenhagen shootings}}
On 14 February 2015 in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, a public event called "Art, blasphemy and the freedom of expression", was organised to honour victims of the attack in January against the French satirical newspaper ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]''. A series of shootings took place that day and the following day in Copenhagen, with two people killed and five police officers wounded. The suspected perpetrator was later shot dead by police on 15 February.

===United States===
{{Main article|Curtis Culwell Center attack}}
On 3 May 2015, two men attempted an attack on the [[Curtis Culwell Center]] in [[Garland, Texas]]. The center was hosting an exhibit featuring cartoons depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The event was presented as a response to the attack on ''Charlie Hebdo'', and organised by the group [[Stop Islamization of America|American Freedom Defense Initiative]] (AFDI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pearce|first1=Matt|title=Outside Muhammad cartoon contest in Texas, 2 gunmen are killed and guard is shot|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-texas-shooting-20150503-story.html#page=1|accessdate=5 May 2015|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both gunmen were killed by police. A Garland Independent School District police officer was injured by a shot to the ankle but survived.

===Security===
Following the attack, France raised [[Vigipirate]] to its highest level: terror alert and deployed soldiers in Paris to the public transport system, media offices, places of worship and the [[Eiffel Tower]]. The [[British Foreign Office]] warned its citizens about travelling to Paris. The [[New York City Police Department]] ordered extra security measures to the offices of the [[Consulate General of France in New York]] in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper East Side]] as well as the [[Lycée Français de New York]], which was deemed a possible target due to the proliferation of attacks in France as well as the level of hatred of the United States within the extremist community.&lt;ref name="abcnews" /&gt; In Denmark, which was the centre of a [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|controversy over cartoons of Muhammad in 2005]], security was increased at all media outlets.&lt;ref name="rydermadi" /&gt;

Hours after the shooting, [[Ministry of the Interior (Spain)|Spanish Interior Minister]] [[Jorge Fernández Díaz]] said that Spain's anti-terrorist security level had been upgraded, and that the country was sharing information with France in relation to the attacks. Spain increased security in public places such as railway stations and increased the police presence on streets throughout the country's cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In wake of Paris shooting, Spain worries about terror attacks on its home soil|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2015/01/08/in-wake-paris-shooting-spain-worries-about-terror-attacks-on-its-home-soil/|author=Andrew O'Reilly|publisher=[[Fox News Latino]]|date=8 January 2015|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Transport Police]] confirmed on 8 January that they would establish new armed patrols in and around [[St Pancras International railway station]] in London, following reports that the suspects were moving north towards [[Eurostar]] stations. They confirmed that the extra patrols were for the reassurance of the public and to maintain visibility and that there were no credible reports yet of the suspects heading towards St Pancras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamhigh.co.uk/news/armed_police_step_up_patrols_at_st_pancras_in_wake_of_charlie_hebdo_paris_massacre_1_3910282|title=Armed police step up patrols at St Pancras in wake of Charlie Hebdo Paris massacre|author=Paul Wright|work=Hampstead Highgate Express|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Belgium, the staff of ''[[P-Magazine]]'' were given police protection, although there were no specific threats. ''P-Magazine'' had previously published a cartoon of Muhammad drawn by the Danish cartoonist [[Kurt Westergaard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Politiebescherming voor redactie P-Magazine|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20150108_01464332|author=Andrew O'Reilly|publisher=nieuwsblad.be|date=8 January 2015|accessdate=9 January 2015|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of the day of the attack, demonstrations against the shootings were held at the [[Place de la République]] in Paris&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/charlie-hebdo-twitter-rundschau-je-suis-charlie-hitzige-debatten-auf-twitter/11196864.html |work=Tages Spiegel|date=7 January 2015|title="Je suis Charlie": Hitzige Debatten auf Twitter|author=Fabian Federl}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in other cities including [[Toulouse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=Le Figaro |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2015/01/07/97001-20150107FILWWW00382--charlie-hebdo-10000-personnes-rassemblees-a-toulouse.php |title=Charlie Hebdo: 10.000 personnes rassemblées à Toulouse}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nice]], [[Lyon]], [[Marseille]] and [[Rennes]].

The phrase ''[[Je suis Charlie]]'' (French for "I am Charlie") came to be a common worldwide sign of solidarity against the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/01/13/world/muhammad-holds-je-suis-charlie-sign-charlie-hebdo-front-page/ |title=Muhammad holds 'Je suis Charlie' sign on Charlie Hebdo front page |author=AFP, JIJI, japantimes |work=Japan Times|location=Japan |date=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many demonstrators used the slogan to express solidarity with the magazine. It appeared on printed and hand-made placards, and was displayed on mobile phones at vigils, and on many websites, particularly media sites such as ''[[Le Monde]]''. The [[hashtag]] #jesuischarlie quickly trended at the top of [[Twitter]] hashtags worldwide following the attack.&lt;ref name="Top hashtag"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jesuischarlie-sign-of-solidarity-after-paris-terror-attack-charlie-hebdo |title=#JeSuisCharlie: Signs of solidarity after Paris terror attack |publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a rally in the [[Place de la République]] in the wake of the shooting, [[List of mayors of Paris|mayor of Paris]] [[Anne Hidalgo]] said, "What we saw today was an attack on the values of our republic; Paris is a peaceful place.

Two Islamist newspapers in Turkey ran headlines that were criticised on social media as justifying the attack.

===Schools===
''[[Le Figaro]]'' reported that in a [[Seine-Saint-Denis]] primary school, up to 80% of the pupils refused&lt;ref name="lefigaro 2015-01-09" /&gt; to participate in the minute of silence that the French government decreed for schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linfo.re/france/societe/659812-charlie-hebdo-la-minute-de-silence-dans-les-ecoles-embarrasse-des-parents|title=Charlie Hebdo&amp;nbsp;: La minute de silence dans les écoles embarrasse des parents|publisher=Linfo.re|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A student told a teacher, "I'll drop you with a Kalashnikov, mate." Other teachers were told ''Charlie Hebdo'' "had it coming", and "Me, I'm for the killers". One teacher requested to be transferred.&lt;ref name="lefigaro 2015-01-09"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2015/01/09/01016-20150109ARTFIG00338-ces-minutes-de-silence-qui-ont-derape-dans-les-ecoles.php|title=Charlie Hebdo : ces minutes de silence qui ont dérapé dans les écoles|work=Le Figaro|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They also reported that students from a vocational school in Senlis tried to attack and beat students from a neighbouring school while saying "we will kill more Charlie Hebdos". The incident is being investigated by authorities who are handling 37 proceedings of "terrorism glorification" and 17 proceedings of threats of violence in schools.&lt;ref name="FAZ_Schools"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Charlie Hebdo: Hass in Frankreichs Klassenzimmern|trans-title="Charlie Hebdo: Hate in France's Schools"| last=Wiegel| first=Michaela| work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]| date=16 January 2015| accessdate=16 January 2015| url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/nach-pariser-anschlaegen-herrscht-hass-in-frankreichs-schulen-13372074.html| language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[La Provence]]'' reported that a fight broke out in the l'Arc à Orange high school during the minute of silence, as a result of a student post on a social network welcoming the atrocities. The student was later penalised for posting the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laprovence.com/actu/faits-divers-en-direct/3212237/un-lyceen-condamne-pour-apologie-des-attentats.html|title=Un lycéen condamné pour apologie des attentats|author=La Provence|publisher=LaProvence.com|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Le Point]]'' reported on the "provocations" at a grade school in [[Grenoble]], and cited a girl who said "Madame, people won't let the insult of a drawing of the prophet pass by, it is normal to take revenge.  This is more than a joke, it's an insult!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/societe/le-desarroi-d-une-prof-qui-parle-de-charlie-a-ses-eleves-09-01-2015-1895173_23.php|title=Le désarroi d'une prof qui parle de "Charlie" à ses élèves|author=Laureline Dupont|work=Le Point.fr|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Le Monde]]'' reported that the majority of students they met at Saint-Denis condemned the attack. For them, life is sacred, but so is religion. Marie-Hélène, age 17, said "I didn't really want to stand for the one minute silence, I didn't think it was right to pay homage to a man who insulted Islam and other religions too". Abdul, age 14, said "of course everyone stood for the one minute silence, and that includes all Muslims... I did it for those who were killed, but not for Charlie. I have no pity for him, he had no respect for us Muslims". It also reported that for most students at the Paul Eluard high school in Saint-Denis, freedom of expression is perceived as being "incompatible with their faith". For Erica, who describes herself as Catholic, "there are wrongs on both sides". A fake bomb was planted in the faculty lounge at the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2015/01/10/a-saint-denis-collegiens-et-lyceens-ne-sont-pas-tous-charlie_4553048_3224.html|title=A Saint-Denis, collégiens et lycéens ne sont pas tous " Charlie "|author=Mattea Battaglia et Benoit Floc'h|work=Le Monde.fr|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[France Télévisions]] reported that a fourth-grade student told her teacher, "We will not be insulted by a drawing of the prophet, it is normal that we take revenge." It also reported that the fake bomb contained the message "I Am Not Charlie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francetvinfo.fr/faits-divers/attaque-au-siege-de-charlie-hebdo/minute-de-silence-pour-charlie-hebdo-la-difficile-tache-des-profs-dans-certains-colleges_792855.html|title=On ne va pas se laisser insulter par un dessin du prophète, c'est normal qu'on se venge|author=Francetv info|work=francetv info|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American journalist [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] wrote an article titled "I Am Not Charlie Hebdo" in ''[[The New York Times]]'', arguing that the magazine's humor was childish, but necessary as a voice of satire. He also criticised many of those in America who were ostensibly voicing support for free speech, noting that were the cartoons to be published in an American university newspaper, the editors would be accused of "hate speech" and the university would "have cut financing and shut them down." He called on the attacks to be an impetus toward tearing down speech codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/opinion/david-brooks-i-am-not-charlie-hebdo.html?_r=0|title=I Am Not Charlie Hebdo|last=Brooks|first=David|date=8 January 2015|work=The New York Times|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American linguist and philosopher [[Noam Chomsky]] views the popularisation of the ''[[Je suis Charlie]]'' slogan by politicians and media in the West as hypocritical, comparing the situation to the [[NATO bombing of the Radio Television of Serbia headquarters]] in 1999, when 16 employees were killed. ''"There were no demonstrations or cries of outrage, no chants of  &amp;#39;We are RTV&amp;#39; [...]''", he noted. Chomsky also mentioned other incidents where US military forces have caused higher civilian death tolls, without leading to intensive reactions such as those that followed the [[January 2015 Île-de-France attacks|2015 Paris attacks]].&lt;ref name=Chomsky2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|title=Chomsky: Paris attacks show hypocrisy of West's outrage|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/19/opinion/charlie-hebdo-noam-chomsky/|accessdate=20 January 2015|publisher=CNN|date=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German politician [[Sahra Wagenknecht]], the deputy leader of the party [[The Left (Germany)|Die Linke]] in the German Parliament, has compared the US drone attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan or Yemen with the terrorist attacks in Paris. ″If a drone controlled by the West extinguishes an innocent Arab or Afghan family, which is just a despicable crime as the attacks in Paris, and it should fill us with the same sadness and the same horror". We should not operate a double standard. Through the drone attacks had been "murdered thousands of innocent people", in the concerned countries, this created helplessness, rage and hatred: "Thereby we prepare the ground for the terror, we officially want to fight." The politician stressed that this war is also waged from German ground. Regarding the Afghanistan war with German participation for years, she said: "Even the Bundeswehr is responsible for the deaths of innocent people in Afghanistan." As the most important consequence of the terrorist attacks in Paris, Wagenknecht demanded the end of all military operations of the West in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/wagenknecht-101.html "Drohnenangriffe wie Pariser Anschläge"], Tagesschau, 17 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.screen.yahoo.com/blumio---rap-da-news/blumio-rap-da-news-episode-154614306.html Blumio – Rap da News! – Episode 110], Yahoo!!, 19 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Donohue]], president of the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|US Catholic League]], said ''Charlie Hebdo'' had a "long and disgusting record" of mocking religious figures and that Charb "didn't understand the role he played in his tragic death.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;Had he not been so narcissistic, he may still be alive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dolan|first=Eric W.|title=Catholic League chief: Charlie Hebdo editor got himself murdered by being a narcissist|date=7 January 2015|work=Rawstory |url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2015/01/catholic-league-chief-charlie-hebdo-editor-got-himself-murdered-by-being-a-narcissist/|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartoonist-journalist [[Joe Sacco]] expressed grief for the victims in a comic strip, and wrote &lt;blockquote&gt;but&amp;nbsp;... tweaking the noses of Muslims&amp;nbsp;... has never struck me as anything other than a [[wikt:vapid|vapid]] way to use the pen&amp;nbsp;... I affirm our right to "[[wikt:take the piss|take the piss]]"&amp;nbsp;... but we can try to think why the world is the way it is&amp;nbsp;... and [retaliating with violence against Muslims] is going to be far easier than sorting out how we fit in each other's world.&lt;ref name=sacco-09&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2015/jan/09/joe-sacco-on-satire-a-response-to-the-attacks?CMP=ema_565 On Satire – a response to the Charlie Hebdo attacks] (9 January 2015), cartoon by [[Joe Sacco]], ''The Guardian''. "Graphic artist and journalist Joe Sacco on the limits of satire – and what it means if Muslims don't find it funny."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Japanese famous film director, [[Hayao Miyazaki]] expressed his opinion about the attack and gave his opinion about the magazine decision to publish the content cited as the trigger for the incident. He said, "I think it's a mistake to caricaturize the figures venerated by another culture. You shouldn't do it." He assert, "Instead of doing something like that, you should first make caricatures of your own country's politicians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11417395/Hayao-Miyazaki-Charlie-Hebdo-Mohammed-cartoons-were-a-mistake.html|title=Hayao Miyazaki: Charlie Hebdo Mohammed cartoons were 'a mistake'|date=17 February 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=19 February 2015|location=London|first=Rebecca|last=Hawkes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rocketnews24.com/2015/02/17/hayao-miyazaki-on-charlie-hebdo-attacks-drawings-of-muhammad-were-a-mistake/|title=Hayao Miyazaki on Charlie Hebdo attacks: Drawings of Muhammad were "a mistake"|author=Casey Baseel|date=17 February 2015|work=RocketNews24|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an open letter titled "[[To the Youth in Europe and North America]]", [[Iran's Supreme Leader]] [[Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]] urged young people in Europe and North America not to judge Islam by the attacks, but to seek their own understanding of the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2015/01/22/Khamenei-urges-young-in-West-to-discover-Islam-for-themselves/2341421947850/ | title=Khamenei urges young in West to discover Islam for themselves | work=UPI | date=22 January 2015 | accessdate=17 May 2015 | author=Adamczyk, Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Holly Dagres]] of [[Al-Monitor]] wrote that Khamenei’s followers "actively spammed Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google+ and even Tumblr with links" to the letter with the aim of garnering the attention of people in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/02/letters4u-iran-khamenei-instagram.html | title=Khamenei's fans take to Instagram | date=3 February 2015 | accessdate=17 May 2015 | author=Dagres, Holly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Choi is the daughter of [[Choi Tae-min]], the leader of a [[cult]] combining various elements of [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], and traditional [[Korean Shamanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/10/29/499864915/swirling-scandal-involving-shamanistic-cult-threatens-s-korean-president|title=Swirling Scandal Involving Shamanistic Cult Threatens S.

Choi Soon-sil was born on June 23, 1956 as the 5th daughter in Choi Tae-min’s family. Her mother’s name is Im Sun-ie (임선이). She entered Dankook University in 1975, but was reported as an auditor. She married Kim Young-ho (김영호) in 1982 and had a son in 1983. They divorced in 1986. She married Choi Tae-min’s former secretary Chung Yoon-hoi in 1995 and had a daughter named Chung Yoo-ra. Soon-sil and Yoon-hoi divorced in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20161028500090&lt;/ref&gt;

Choi’s relationship with Park Geun-hye is estimated to trace back to 1977. At that time, the National College Student Union, which started from a new mindset to “establish an uptight identity, a determined patriotism and an independent value system”, was founded, and Choi was the president. On June 10, 1977, the union held an opening meeting in Hanyang University. During this event the governor of the Saemaul peace corps was sitting on Park Geun-hye’s right side and President Lee Myung-bak was sitting on her left side.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/politics/bluehouse/762715.html|title=이것만 보면 다 안다, 최순실 게이트 총정리|date=2016-09-26|language=ko|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1980s, Choi started managing real estate business and operating kindergartens. In 1983, she acquired 45-pyong (about 149 square meters) of land in Yeoksam-dong, Seoul; in September 1985, she acquired 108-pyong (about 347 square meters) of land in Sinsa-dong and built a 4-story building. A kindergarten used to be operated in this building. In July 1988, she bought a 200-pyong (about 661 square meters) space of land in Sinsa-dong under a joint-contract with someone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2016/11/06/2016110601616.html|title=[TV조선 단독] 최순실 마지막 은신처…정유라 이름 70평 아파트|language=ko|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she bought back the joint shares and became the sole owner of the property. From 1992 to 1996, Choi established and operated Jubel GmbH jointly with Chung Yoon-hoi. In July 2003, a building (referred to as M building) with 7 floors above ground and 2 floors underground was constructed with Choi’s investment. Chung Yoon-hoi’s company was a tenant in this building. In February 2008, Choi sold the kindergarten building to a savings bank. In 1989, Choi translated a child-care instruction book called “How To Hold Your Children’s Habit Upright ” with Kim Kwang-Ung (김광웅). This book introduced Choi as the vice president of research center affiliated to the Korea Institute of Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pub.chosun.com/client/news/viw.asp?cate=C01&amp;mcate=M1001&amp;nNewsNumb=20170122684&amp;nidx=22685|title=입주 건물도 최순실이 직접 고른 한국문화재단의 실체|website=pub.chosun.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Park was attacked by a person with a razor when attending the election campaign for the Seoul mayor as the representative of Grand National Party (now known as Saenuri Party). Choi Soon-sil looked after Park when she was hospitalized. After leaving hospital, Park continued to receive treatment at Choi Soon-sil’s older sister Choi Soon-deuk’s house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ichannela.com/news/main/news_detailPage.do?publishId=81047342-1|title=채널A 뉴스|website=www.ichannela.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is confirmed that Choi operates a cafe and an Italian restaurant “Testa Rossa" in Nonhyeon-dong (in Gangnam-gu, Seoul). The remodeled building has been running since December 2014 (with the first and second floor selling various drinks and sandwiches while the third floor is Choi’s private office.) An insider gave testimony saying that Choi has been contacting and meeting with politicians, influential businessmen and business tycoons on the 2nd and 3rd floors of this building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.khan.co.kr/khan_art_view.html?artid=201612081738037&amp;code=710100|title=[Hearing on the Park Geun-hye, Choi Soon-sil Scandal] "I Recommended a Minister to Choi and It Went Through...

As of November 20, Choi Soon-sil was officially charged by the prosecutors for intervening in state affairs and forcing [[chaebol]]s to donate tens of millions of dollars to foundations and businesses over which she had control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigstory.ap.org/article/55f42fd8578e401194e3cc3b7e084131/s-korean-prosecutors-say-park-conspired-her-friend/ ''AP'', Nov. 20, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38363075|title=South Korea corruption suspect Choi Soon-sil in court|publisher=BBC News|date=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June 2017, the Seoul Central District Court found Choi guilty and sentenced her to three years of imprisonment on charges on obstruction of duty by using her presidential ties to get her daughter admitted to [[Ewha Womans University]] and receive good grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=23 June 2017|title=South Korea: Choi Soon-sil handed three-year jail term|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/06/south-korea-choi-sil-handed-year-jail-term-170623034840900.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea or Duklja''''' ({{lang-sh|Ljetopis popa Dukljanina}}) is the usual name given to an alleged medieval [[chronicle]] written by an anonymous priest from [[Duklja]]. Its oldest preserved copy is from the 17th century, while it has been variously claimed by modern historians to have been compiled between the late 12th and early 15th century. Historians have largely discounted the work based on inaccuracies and fiction, nevertheless it contains some semi-mythological material on the early history of the Western [[South Slavs]]. The section of ''The Life of St. [[Jovan Vladimir]]'', is however believed to be a novelization of an earlier work.

==Authorship and date==

The work was allegedly made by an anonymous "priest of Duklja" (''presbyter Diocleas'', known in Serbian as ''pop Dukljanin''). The work is only preserved in its Latin [[redaction]]s from the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0PmrXKnczUC&amp;pg=PA27|title=The Legend of Basil the Bulgar-Slayer|author=Stephenson|first=Paul|date=7 August 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-521-81530-7|location=Cambridge, UK|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S. Bujan, 2008"&gt;S. Bujan, ''La Chronique du pretre de Dioclee. Un faux document historique'', Revuedes etudes byzantines 66 (2008) 5–38&lt;/ref&gt; Serbian historian [[Tibor Živković]], in the monograph ''Gesta regum Sclavorum'', concluded that its main parts dated to ca. 1300–10.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Gesta regum Sclavorum, I–II|year=2009|last1=Živković|last2=Kunčer|first1=T.|first2=D.|pages=362–365|location=Београд}}. https://www.scribd.com/document/27256865/Gesta-Regum-Sclavorum-II&lt;/ref&gt; Dmine Papalić, a nobleman from [[Split, Croatia|Split]], found the text which he transcribed in 1509–10, which was then translated by [[Marko Marulić]] into Latin in 1510, with the title ''Regnum Dalmatiae et Croatiae gesta''.&lt;ref name="Bešić1967"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zarij M. Bešić|title=Istorija Crne Gore: od najstarijih vremena do kraja XII vijeka|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XWAeAAAAMAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Pedakt︠s︡ija za istoriju t︠s︡rne gore|page=423}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mavro Orbin]], a [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]]n historian, included the work (amongst other works) in his ''Il regno de gli Slavi'' (ca. 1601); [[Johannes Lucius]] did the same in ca. 1666.&lt;ref name="S. Bujan, 2008"/&gt; These Latin redactions claim that the original was written in Slavic.&lt;ref&gt;{{quote|Requested by you, my beloved brethren in Christ and honorable priests of the holy Archbishopric See of the Church in Duklja, as well as by some elders, but especially by the youth of our city who find pleasure not only in listening to and reading about the wars, but in taking part in them also, to translate from the Slavic language into Latin the Book of Goths, entitled in Latin ''Regnum Sclavorum'' in which all their deeds and wars have been described...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chronicle, written in Latin, was completed between 1299 and 1301 in the town of [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] (in [[Montenegro]]), then part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian Kingdom]]. Its author was ''presbyter'' Rudger (or Rudiger), the Catholic [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar|Archbishop of Bar]] (''Antivari''), who was probably of [[Czechs|Czech]] origin.{{sfn|Живковић|2009|p=379}} He is thought to have lived around 1300 because the perception of Bosnian borders coincides with an anonymous text, the ''Anonymi Descriptio Europae Orientalis'' (Cracow, 1916), that has been dated to the year 1308.&lt;ref name="Z2010"&gt;Tibor Živković: ''On the Beginnings of Bosnia in the Middle Ages'', 2010; in Spomenica akademika Marka Šunjića (1927-1998), University of Sarajevo, p. 172, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/46910715/On-the-Beginnings-of-Bosnia]; in the Yearbook of the Center for Balkan Studies of the [[Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], p. 155, in Serbian, [http://www.anubih.ba/godisnjak/izdanja/Godisnjak%2039.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Latest research shows that he flourished in ca. 1296–1300.&lt;ref name=Z2010/&gt;

Chapters 1–33 of the chronicle are based on oral traditions and its author's constructions, and are for the most part dismissed by historians.{{sfn|Живковић|2006|pp=66–72}}{{sfn|Живковић|2009|p=260}} However, the next three chapters possess invaluable historical data about this time period.&lt;ref name="Nikčević2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite its hagiographic nature, Chapter 36 (on Saint [[Jovan Vladimir]]), a summary of an older hagiography dating between 1075 and 1089 (when the [[Vojislavljević dynasty]] endeavored to obtain the royal insignia from the Pope, and to elevate the Bar Bishopric to an archbishopric), contains a lot of reliable historical data.{{sfn|Живковић|2006|pp=66–72}} The previous two chapters, Chapters 34 and 35, which deal with Vladimir's father and uncles, are probably based on the prologue of this 11th-century hagiography.{{sfn|Живковић|2009|p=260}}

Other, obsolete and refuted theories include that the author lived in the second half of the 12th century.&lt;ref name=Z2010/&gt; Some Croatian historians put forward the theory,&lt;ref name="Šanjek1996"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6zgQAQAAIAAJ|title=Kršćanstvo na hrvatskom prostoru: pregled religiozne povijesti Hrvata (7-20. st.)|author=Šanjek|first=Franjo|date=|publisher=Kršćanska sadašnjost|year=1996|isbn=978-953-151-103-2|location=|pages=|quote=Anonimni svećenik iz Bara, Pop Dukljanin ili - prema nekim istraživanjima - Grgur Barski, u drugoj polovici 12. stoljeća piše zanimljivo historiografsko djelo poznato kao Libellus Gothorum ili Sclavorum regnum (Ljetopis Popa Dukljanina), ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[E.

==Content==
''Regnum Sclavorum'' (1601) can be divided into the following sections:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ltRWy32dG7oC&amp;pg=PA573|title=The Poetics of Slavdom: Part III: Njegoš|author=Zlatar|first=Zdenko|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8204-8135-7|volume=2|location=|pages=573–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Introduction (''Auctor ad lectorem'')
* ''Libellus Gothorum'', chapters I–VII
* Constantine's Legend (or "Pannonian Legend"), chapters VIII and beginning of IX
* Methodius (''Liber sclavorum qui dicitur Methodius''), rest of chapter IX
* Travunian Chronicle, chapters X–XXXV, in two parts
* The Life of St. [[Jovan Vladimir]], chapter XXXVI
* History of Dioclea, chapters XXXVII–LXVII

The author attempted to present an overview of ruling families over the course of over two centuries&amp;nbsp;— from the 10th century up to the time of writing, the 12th century.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} There are 47 chapters in the text, of different sizes and varying subject matter.

==Folklore and translations==
The work is actually a number of separate but similar manuscripts, stemming from an original source that [[Lost work|does not survive]] but assumed to have been written by the Priest of Duklja himself (or other monk-scribes giving a helping hand).

It has been generally agreed that this Presbyter included in his work [[folklore]] and literary material from Slavic sources which he translated into Latin. Among the material he translated, rather than created, is "The Legend of Prince Vladimir" which is supposed to have been written by another clergyman, also from Duklja, more specifically, Zečanin from Krajina in Zeta or Duklja (an earlier name for Zeta). &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=V3HTDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT112&amp;dq=Ze%C4%8Danin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifk_bJ8LTeAhXGxVkKHcOTCgEQ6AEIOTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Ze%C4%8Danin&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;In its original version, it was a [[hagiographic]] work, a "Life of St. Vladimir" rather than a "Legend." Prince Vladimir, the protagonist of the story, as well as King Vladislav, who ordered Vladimir's execution, were historical persons, yet "The Legend of Prince Vladimir" contains non-historical material.

The chronicle was also added to by a bishop of Bar intent on demonstrating his diocese' superiority over that of [[Bishop of Split]].

==Assessment==

===Historical value, fiction===
Various inaccurate or simply wrong claims in the text make it an unreliable source. Modern historians have serious doubts about the majority of this work as being mainly fictional, or [[wishful thinking]]. Some go as far as to say that it can be dismissed in its entirety, but that is not a majority opinion, rather, it is thought to have given us a unique insight into the whole era from the point of view of the indigenous [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] population and it is still a topic of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.historiografija.hr/prikazi.php?id=235953 | language = Croatian | title = Ljetopis popa Dukljanina pred izazovima novije historiografije, Zagreb, 3. ožujka 2011. godine | publisher = Historiografija.hr | date = 2011-07-11 | accessdate = 2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work describes the local [[Slavs]] as a peaceful people imported by the Goth rulers, who invaded the area in the 5th century, but it doesn't attempt to elaborate on how and when this happened. This information contradicts the information found in the Byzantine text ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]''.

The ''Chronicle'' also mentions one [[Svätopluk (disambiguation)|Svetopeleg or Svetopelek]], the eighth descendant of the original Goth invaders, as the main ruler of the lands that cover [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]] ([[Duklja]]) and [[Serbia]]. He is also credited with the [[Christianization]] of the people who are Goths or Slavs&amp;nbsp;— a purely fictitious attribution. These claims about a unified kingdom are probably a reflection of the earlier glory of the [[Great Moravia|Moravian kingdom]]. He may also have been talking about [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]].

The priest's parish was located at the seat of the [[archbishopric]] of [[Duklja]]. According to Bishop Gregory's late 12th-century additions to this document, this Archbishopric covered much of the western [[Balkans]] including the bishoprics of Bar, [[Budva]], [[Kotor]], [[Ulcinj]], [[Svač]], [[Skadar]], [[Drivast]], [[Pulat]], [[Travunia]], [[Zahumlje]].

Further, it mentions [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] (Bosnam) and [[Rascia]] (Rassa) as the two Serbian lands, while describing the southern [[Dalmatia]]n Hum/''[[Zahumlje]]'', [[Travunia]] and [[Duklja|Dioclea]] (most of today's [[Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], as well as parts of [[Croatia]] and [[Albania]]) as Croatian lands ("[[Red Croatia]]"), which is a description inconsistent with all other historical works from the same period.

The archbishop of Bar was later named ''Primas Serbiae''. Ragusa had some claims to be considered the natural ecclesiastical centre of South Dalmatia but those of Dioclea (Bar) to this new metropolitan status were now vigorously pushed especially as the Pope intended Serbia to be attached to Dioclea.

In his 1967 reprint of the work, Yugoslav historian [[Slavko Mijušković]] stated that the chronicle is a purely fictional literary product, belonging to the late 14th or early 15th century.&lt;ref name="Henrik Birnbaum 1974 304"/&gt;

===Region of Bosnia===
The region of Bosnia is described to span the area west of the river [[Drina]], "up to the Pine mountain" ({{lang-la|ad montem Pini}}, {{lang-hr|do gore Borave}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Edin Mutapčić | title = Oblast – Zemlja Soli u srednjem vijeku | journal = Baština sjeveroistočne Bosne | number = 1 | year = 2008 | issn = 1986-6895 | publisher = JU Zavod za zaštitu i korištenje kulturno-historijskog i prirodnog naslijeđa Tuzlanskog kantona | page = 18 | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/80491216/Ba%C5%A1tina-sjeveroisto%C4%8Dne-Bosne-broj-1-2010 | accessdate = 2012-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of this Pine mountain is unknown.
In 1881, Croatian historian [[Franjo Rački]] wrote that this refers to the mountain of "Borova glava" near the [[Livno field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www26.us.archive.org/stream/hrvatskaprijexii00raki/hrvatskaprijexii00raki_djvu.txt | language = Croatian | title = Hrvatska prije XII vieka: glede na zemljišni obseg i narod | year = 1881 | journal = [[Rad (journal)|Rad]] | volume = LVI | publisher = [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] | page = 36 | accessdate = 2012-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Croatian historian [[Luka Jelić]] wrote the mountain was located either between [[Maglaj]] and [[Skender Vakuf]], northwest of [[Žepče]], or it was the mountain Borovina located between [[Vranica]] and [[Radovan]], according to [[Ferdo Šišić]]'s 1908 work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jelić|first=Luka|date=September 1909|title=Duvanjski sabor|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=76530&amp;lang=en|journal=Journal of the Zagreb Archaeological Museum|language=Croatian|publisher=[[Zagreb Archaeological Museum]]|volume=10|page=138|pages=|issn=0350-7165|accessdate=2012-09-12|via=|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1935, Serbian historian [[Vladimir Ćorović]] wrote that the toponym refers to the mountain of Borova glava, because of etymology and because it is located on the watershed ([[drainage divide]]).&lt;ref name="Mrgić-2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Ćorović, ''Teritorijalni razvoj bosanske države u srednjem vijeku'', Glas SKA 167, Belgrade, 1935, pp. 10-13&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1936, Slovene ethnologist [[Niko Županič]] had also interpreted that to mean that the western border of Bosnia was at some drainage divide mountains, but placed it to the southeast of [[Dinara]].&lt;ref&gt;Niko Županič, Značenje  barvnega  atributa  v  imenu „Crvena Hrvatska". Lecture at the IV Congress of Slavic geographers and ethnographers, Sofia, 18 August 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;
Croatian historian [[Anto Babić]], based on the work of [[Dominik Mandić]] in 1978, inferred that the term refers roughly to a place of the drainage divide between the [[Sava]] and [[Adriatic Sea]] watersheds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=120730&amp;lang=en | language = Croatian | title = Bijeli Hrvati u banskoj Hrvatskoj i županijska Hrvatska | author = Ivan Mužić | journal = Starohrvatska prosvjeta | volume = III | number = 37 |date=December 2010 | publisher = Museum of Croatian Archaeological Monuments | location = Split, Croatia | issn = 0351-4536 | page = 270 | accessdate = 2012-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Mandić, ''Državna i vjerska pripadnost sredovječne Bosne i Hecegovine.'' II. edition, Ziral, Chicago–Rome 1978, pp. 408&amp;ndash;409.&lt;/ref&gt;
In her discussion of Ćorović, Serbian historian [[Jelena Mrgić-Radojčić]] also points to the existence of a mountain of "Borja" in today's northern Bosnia with the same etymology.&lt;ref name="Mrgić-2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=2004|title=Rethinking the territorial development of the medieval Bosnian state|url=https://fvm.academia.edu/JelenaMrgi%C4%87/Papers/781171/Rethinking_the_territorial_development_of_the_medieval_Bosnian_state|journal=Historical Review|publisher=[[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] - Institute of History|volume=LI|pages=52-53|issn=0350-0802|accessdate=2012-09-12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concert performances are commonly presented in concert halls without a theater stage, but occasionally also in [[opera house]]s when a scenic production is deemed too difficult or expensive. During a concert performance in an opera house, the orchestra does not play in the [[orchestra pit]]. Instead they play on the stage, with the choir behind them and the soloists standing in front of them.

Since 1960, concert performances have been a part of the annual [[Salzburg Festival]] alongside scenic productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salzburgerfestspiele.at/konzert|title=Salzburger Festspiele / Konzert|work=salzburgerfestspiele.at}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Theater an der Wien]], concert performances are presented regularly since 2006, particularly baroque operas with elaborate set designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theater-wien.at/index.php/de/spielplan|title=Theater an der Wien - Spielplan|work=theater-wien.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Concussion]]s and other types of repetitive play-related head blows in [[American football]] have been shown to be the cause of [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE), which has led to player deaths and other debilitating symptoms after retirement, including memory loss, [[depression (mood)|depression]], anxiety, headaches, and also sleep disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=concussions|last=Meehan III|first=William|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=9781440838941|location=Santa Barbara, California|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[List of NFL players with chronic traumatic encephalopathy|list of ex-NFL players]] that have either been diagnosed ''post-mortem'' with [[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy|CTE]] or have reported symptoms of CTE continues to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/sports/nfl/article58501703.html|title=The grim list of football players with CTE continues to grow|work=kansascity|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/04/sports/football/ken-stabler-nfl-cte-brain-disease.html?nytmobile=0|title=Ken Stabler, a Magnetic NFL Star, Was Sapped of Spirit by C.T.E.|last=Branch|first=John|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Boston University CTE Center, CTE is a brain degenerative disease found in athletes, military veterans, and others with history of repetitive brain trauma. Although CTE is highly controversial and misunderstood; it is believed that a protein called Tau forms clumps that slowly spread throughout the brain, killing brain cells.

==Concussions in the National Football League==
{{see also|list of NFL players with post-concussion syndrome}}

=== History ===
A [[concussion]], from the Latin word [[wiktionary:concussio|''concussio'']], is a frequent injury among football players. Concussions occur when the head is subject to a large impact force, resulting in a minor brain injury.  There has been a growing concern about concussions since the early 1900s.  In 1906, a Harvard student athlete died from a head injury and the team doctors released a report titled "The Physical Aspect of American Football" in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal describing the type, severity, and number of injuries the team sustained in the 1905 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harrison|first1=Emily|title=The First Concussion Crisis; Head Injury and Evidence in Early American Football|journal=Public Health Then and Now|date=May 2014|volume=104|issue=5|page=825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL first began to review the subject formally in 1994, then [[NFL Commissioner]] [[Paul Tagliabue]] approved the creation of the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) Committee with the stated goal of studying the effects of concussions and sub-concussive injury in NFL players. Tagliabue appointed [[rheumatologist]] Elliot Pellman to chair the committee.&lt;ref name="Peter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Peter|first=Peter|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3644940|title=Elliot Pellman, the NFL's top medical adviser, claims it's okay for players with concussions to get back in the game. Time for a second choice|publisher=ESPN Sports|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pellman's appointment was met with harsh criticism, because he is not a neurologist or [[neuropsychologist]] and often admitted ignorance about head injuries.&lt;ref name="Peter"/&gt; The concussion data collected by the league from 1996 to 2001 has been shown to understate the actual number of diagnosed concussions by ten percent. The league legal representation has been shown to have had ties to the tobacco industry legal defense.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Schwarz, Walt Bogdanich and Jacqueline Williams. (24 March 2016). "In NFL, Deeply Flawed Concussion Research and Ties to Big Tobacco " The New York Times. (New York). Retrieved 24 March 2016. [http://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/in-nfl-deeply-flawed-concussion-research-and-ties-to-big-tobacco/ar-BBqRt5G?ocid=spartandhp MSN website]&lt;/ref&gt; {{Importance inline}}

The same year, the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) reported a statistically significant increase in the risk of [[neurological]] disorders such as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) in retired football players, which furthered public knowledge about the risk of long-term neurocognitive disease related to repeated head impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/hhe/reports/pdfs/1988-0085-letter.pdf|title=Concussion in professional football: helmet testing to assess impact performance – part 11|publisher=[[United States Public Health Service]] [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|date=2004-01-10|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the NIOSH study, Pellman and the MTBI Committee drew their own conclusions that continued to contradict these findings and those of other organizations. Biomechanical engineers and neurosurgeons informed the Committee that the helmet safety standard at that time was insufficient to minimize the risk of concussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Concussion in professional football: helmet testing to assess impact performance – part 11|date=January 2006|pmid=16385332|volume=58|vauthors=Pellman EJ, Viano DC, Withnall C, Shewchenko N, Bir CA, Halstead PD |pages=78–96; discussion 78–96|journal=Neurosurgery|doi=10.1227/01.neu.0000196265.35238.7c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MTBI Committee began studying the nature of [[Tackle (American football)|tackle]] plays resulting in concussive impacts and developing its own biomechanical analysis of the effect of these forces on the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Practice parameter: the management of concussion in sports (summary statement).

A six-year study by the Committee concluded that, "Players who are concussed and return to the same game have fewer initial signs and symptoms than those removed from play. Return to play does not involve a significant risk of a second injury either in the same game or during the season."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Concussion in professional football: players returning to the same game – part 7 |pmid=15617589 | volume=56|vauthors=Pellman EJ, Viano DC, Casson IR, Arfken C, Feuer H |pages=79–90; discussion 90–92|journal=Neurosurgery|doi=10.1227/01.neu.0000150180.16552.8d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
Other organizations continued to publish study results that linked repeated concussions and long-term health problems contrary to reports by the MTBI Committee. A 2003 report by the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes at the [[University of North Carolina]], for example, found a connection between numerous concussions and depression among former professional football players. Further, the Center's follow-up study in 2005 associated both brain impairment and Alzheimer's disease with retired NFL players who had histories of concussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Association between recurrent concussion and late-life cognitive impairment in retired professional football players. |pmid=16239884 | volume=57|date=Oct 2005|pages=719–26|journal=Neurosurgery|doi=10.1227/01.NEU.0000175725.75780.DD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 doctoral dissertation by Don Brady examined NFL Players' knowledge of concussions, studying both active and retired National Football League Players' knowledge of concussions. Brady's findings concluded: that many NFL players lacked accurate and essential knowledge pertaining to various aspects of a concussion; that the preponderance of credible experimental and clinical evidence pertaining to the adverse effects of concussion indicates that the brain is injured as a result of a concussion; that the altered cell functioning and cell death along with subtle to more visible neurological, neurocognitive, psychological, and other medical problems reflect a diverse range of lifelong negative consequences of a concussion / brain injury; and that sports team health-care personnel need to focus primarily on the athletes' health and well-being, and not minimize an injury or primarily concentrate on the players' capacity to perform on the field. This expanded focus of health care is necessary in order to avoid any real or perceived conflicts of interest emerging in the concussion research, concussion management and related return to play decision-making process.&lt;ref name=Brady04&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |first=Don |last=Brady |title=A Preliminary Investigation of Active and Retired NFL Players' Knowledge of Concussions |publisher=The Union Institute and University |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During November 2014, Brady filed objections to the proposed NFL concussion settlement offer. Brady sent a cover letter and detailed objections on behalf of NFL retired players to the presiding US district court judge, Anita Brody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballvets.org/blog/2014/11/dr-don-brady-files-objection/|title= Dr. Don Brady Files Objection to NFL Concussion Settlement Offer|work=Footballvets.org|date=November 19, 2014|accessdate=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the studies that continued to contradict the work of the MTBI Committee, renowned experts and sports journalists wrote critical reviews of the Committee's studies. Robert Cantu of the [[American College of Sports Medicine]] noted bias in the committee's extremely small sample size and held that no conclusions should be drawn from the NFL's studies. In an ESPN Magazine article titled "Doctor Yes," Peter Keating criticized Pellman and the MTBI Committee's work and argued that the "... Committee has drawn a number of important conclusions about head trauma and how to treat it that contradict the research and experiences of many other doctors who treat sports concussions, not to mention the players who have suffered them."&lt;ref name="Peter"/&gt;

More studies continued to associate repetitive head injuries with neurological problems later in life. [[Kevin Guskiewicz]], Director of the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes in the Department of Exercise and Sport Science at the University of North Carolina, analyzed data from a 2007 study of nearly 2,500 former NFL players. He found about 11 percent of the study participants suffered from [[clinical depression]], with a threefold increased risk in former players who had a history of three or four concussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Associated Press|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/sports/football/31concussions.html?pagewanted=all|title = NFL Study Links Concussions, Depression|publisher = New York Times|date = 2007-05-31|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the NFL commissioned the [[University of Michigan Institute for Social Research]] to conduct a study involving more than 1,000 former NFL players. The results reported that Alzheimer's disease or similar diseases appear to have been diagnosed in former NFL players vastly more often than in the general population at a rate of 19 times the normal rate for men ages 30 through 49. The NFL responded to these results by claiming the study was incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Ken Belson|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/sports/football/actuarial-reports-in-nfl-concussion-deal-are-released.html|title = Dementia Risk Seen in Players in NFL Study|work = New York Times|date = 2014-09-12|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 2014, researchers with [[Boston University]] announced that in autopsies of 79 brains of former NFL players, 76 had tested positive for CTE.&lt;ref name="Breslow"&gt;{{cite web|last=Breslow|first=Jason|date=30 September 2014|title=76 of 79 Deceased NFL Players Found to Have Brain Disease|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/sports/concussion-watch/76-of-79-deceased-nfl-players-found-to-have-brain-disease/|publisher=PBS|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2017, that number had grown to 90 out of 94.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/cte/our-research/case-studies/|title=Case Studies »  CTE Center  {{!}} Boston University|website=www.bu.edu|access-date=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in ''[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' in July 2017 showed that 110 of 111 former NFL players whose brains were examined were found to have suffered from CTE.&lt;ref name="110of111"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Joe|last2=Williams|first2=Josh|last3=Manchester|first3=Sam|title=111 NFL Brains.

With continued pressure to protect players, the NFL began preventing players knocked unconscious by a concussion from returning to a game or practice, a policy that applied to [[Detroit Lions]] running back [[Jahvid Best]] in {{NFL Year|2009}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|agency=Associated Press|url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2011-08-22/lions-rb-jahvid-best-misses-second-practice-with-concussion|title=Lions RB Jahvid Best misses second practice with concussion|work=The Sporting News|date=2011-08-22|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various players have filed lawsuits against the league for the concussions, accusing the league of hiding information that linked head trauma to permanent brain damage, [[Alzheimer's disease]], and [[dementia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/07/nfl-concussion-brain-trauma-lawsuit-players_n_1577497.html|title=NFL Concussions Mega-Lawsuit Claims League Hid Brain Injury Links From Players|publisher=Huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=2012-06-27|date=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freeman|first=Mike|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/19085374/concussion-lawsuit-plaintiffs-an-eye-opening-cross-section-of-nfl-past|title=Concussion lawsuit plaintiffs an eye- opening cross section of NFL past|publisher=Cbssports.com|date=2012-05-18|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some teams chose not to draft certain players in the [[NFL Draft]] due to their past concussion history. According to an Outside the Lines report, the head impact telemetry system (HITS) was in question by the League, although Kevin Guskiewicz, a professor at the University of North Carolina, said the system is functional.&lt;ref name=HITS /&gt; The technology could detect and measure the impact of blows to the head in real time during a game, but no such measurement exists in the league at this time.&lt;ref name=ESPN12&gt;{{cite news|title=OTL: Football At A Crossroads: The Hit System|url=http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=8085758|newspaper=[[ESPN]]|date=22 June 2012|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Pittsburgh Steelers receiver and current NBC Sports analyst [[Hines Ward]] stated the use of the system would be "opening a Pandora's Box," and that the data recorded by the system could be used by team owners to give players lower salaries.&lt;ref name=HITS /&gt;

In November 2011, the Cleveland Clinic Center for Spine Health created an online study released by the ''[[Journal of Neurosurgery]]'' in which various [[football helmet]]s were compared with each other via [[crash test dummy|crash test dummies]]. It was also found that leather helmets provided similar results to modern helmets, and in some cases, the leather helmets proved to have superior protection against concussive blows. However, the leather helmets did not provide as much protection against skull fractures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/story/2011-11-03/leather-helmets-concussion-prevention/51070952/1 Study reveals leather helmets may help reduce concussions], ''USA Today'', Erik Brady, 11/4/2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthland.time.com/2011/11/07/in-football-leather-helmets-could-provide-a-better-defense-against-concussion/#ixzz1u20uvfQf Why Leather Football Helmets Could Provide a Better Defense Against Concussion], ''Time'' magazine, Sean Gregory, November 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2011.9.JNS111059?prevSearch=helmets&amp;searchHistoryKey= Impact test comparisons of 20th and 21st century American football helmets], Abstract, ''Journal of Neurosurgery'', Adam Bartsch, Ph.D., Edward Benzel, M.D., Vincent Miele, M.D., and Vikas Prakash, Ph.D., Jan. 2012 (published online November 4, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concussion protocol process ===
When a [[American football|football]] player sustains a [[concussion]] in the NFL, he is required to go through the concussion protocol the league has in place by the NFL Head, Neck and Spine Committee:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2013/10/01/0ap2000000254002.pdf|title=NFL Head, Neck and Spine Committee's Protocols Regarding Diagnosis and Management of Concussion|last=|first=|date=|website=NFL|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Preseason evaluation ====
Before the NFL season starts, all players and coaching staff of an organization are required to be educated on concussions and the importance of promptly reporting any concussion symptoms. All players in the league are also mandated to take a baseline [[neurological]] and [[Physical examination|physical exam]]. The baseline neurological exam is either a computerized or paper and pencil exam that will test different brain functions. The exam tests attention span, memory, language, speech skills, reasoning, planning, and organizational skills. The results of this test are used as a baseline if a player suffers a head injury at any point throughout the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/brain/neuropsychological-tests#1|title=Neuropsychological Tests|work=WebMD|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preseason physical examination allows the team physician and athletic trainer the opportunity to review and answer any questions the player might have. This also gives the physician and athletic trainer the time to go over any previous concussions, discuss the importance of reporting any symptoms of a concussion, and explain the concussion protocol that is in place for the current season.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/nfl-concussion-protocol-policy-history|title=What is the NFL's concussion protocol?|last=Flynn|first=Erin|work=SI.com|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In-game identification ====
Current NFL concussion protocol creates positions in each organization's medical staff who are specifically charged with identifying and diagnosing concussions. One of these roles involves an unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant who work with other team physicians and [[athletic trainer]]s to conduct evaluations. Another position involves athletic trainers who are positioned in the booth at every game to spot potential concussions in players from both teams. These spotters review film throughout the game that could possibly result in concussions and are capable to call "medical timeouts" to relay that information to the medical personnel on the sidelines so that further evaluation can be conducted. These spotters have been in use since the [[2011 NFL season|2011 season]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== In-game evaluation ====
If a player shows to have a concussion or concussion symptoms, it is mandatory that the individual be removed from the game. If the player is diagnosed with a concussion, they are prohibited from re-entering the game or practice that day. According to the league's protocol, signs of a concussion include: loss of consciousness, lack of balance, holding head after contact, absentmindedness, lethargy, confusion or a visible facial injury in combination with any of the other factors. If the medical staff rule the player clear from a concussion, then the video of that hit must be reviewed before the player can re-enter the game or practice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Post-game ====
After a concussion has occurred, the player must be monitored and examined on a daily basis in a training room by the team medial staff until fully cleared from concussion. Along with the continuous examination prior to a concussion, the player must meet standards that are in place by the league in order to return a game or contact practice. The player may not return to football activities until he has returned to his baseline [[cognitive function]]. Next, the player must go through a graduated exercise challenge, followed by a gradual return to practice and play. If player is feeling any setback or post- concussion symptoms, evaluation then starts from the beginning. Finally, the team doctor and an unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant must both clear him for return to play.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== NFL litigation ==

===A league of denial===
The NFL spent years trying to deny and cover up any link that emerged connecting head injuries sustained while playing football with long-term brain disorders. The NFL Mild Traumatic Brain Committee, first formed in 1994, reported in December 1999 that the number of head injuries had remained "remarkably the same over the course of four years."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ezell, Lauren. "Timeline: The NFL's Concussion Crisis." PBS.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee went a step further in 2004 when it suggested in an article published in ''Neurosurgery'' that "NFL players have evolved to a state where their brains are less susceptible to injury." Two months after that, MTBI publishes another article that concludes "Players who are concussed and return to the same game have fewer initial signs and symptoms than those removed from play. Return to play does not involve a significant risk of a second injury either in the same game or during the season."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, when Dr. [[Bennet Omalu]] examined the brain of former Pittsburgh Steeler [[Mike Webster]], he discovered a new brain disease, which he called [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]], or CTE. He outlined his findings in a scientific paper published in ''Neurosurgery'' in July 2005.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The NFL's MTBI committee wrote in May 2006 that the article be retracted. Dr. Omalu instead wrote a second paper in the same magazine, this time about former Pittsburgh Steeler [[Terry Long (American football)|Terry Long]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Dr. Ira Casson, who was then co-chair of MTBI, denied in a televised interview that there was any link between head injuries sustained playing in the NFL and long-term brain damage. His repeated denials won him the nickname "Dr. No."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In September 2009, ''The New York Times'' published an article of an NFL-funded study stating that former players are 19 times more likely than the general population to have dementia, Alzheimer's or other memory-related diseases. The NFL's spokesperson, Greg Aiello, publicly said, "the study did not formally diagnose dementia, that it was subject to shortcomings of telephone surveys."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Two months later, Aiello told ''New York Times'' reporter [[Alan Schwarz]] that "it's quite obvious from the medical research that's been done that concussions can lead to long-term problems."&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Alan. "N.F.L Acknowledges Long-Term Concussion Effects." The New York Times, December 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time any League official had acknowledged a link between the two.

Things got worse for the NFL when investigative reporters [[Steve Fainaru]] and his brother [[Mike Fainaru-Wada]] learned from an anonymous source that the NFL Retirement Board had awarded "disability payments to at least three former players after concluding that football caused their crippling brain injuries - even as the league's top medical experts for years consistently denied any link between the sport and long-term brain damage."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Fainaru, Steve, and Mark Fainaru-Wada. "NFL Board Paid $2M to Players While League Denied Football-Concussion Link." PBS.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the cases was that of Mike Webster, who filed a claim in 1999. In 2005,  three years after his death, his family received $1.8 million from the Retirement Board. "That same year," write the Fainuru brothers, "the NFL published the 10th installment in its series on concussions research in the medical journal ''Neurosurgery.'' The paper, whose authors included three members of the League's [MTBI], asserted that chronic brain injury 'has never been reported in American football players.'"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Since Aiello's admittance, the link between head injuries in football and long-term brain damage have become more accepted in the NFL In a roundtable discussion with the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] Committee on Energy and Commerce, Jeff Miller, the NFL's senior vice-president for health and safety, admitted that "there is a link between football-related head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy."&lt;ref&gt;Fainuru, Steve. "NFL acknowledges, for first time, link between football, brain disease." ESPN.&lt;/ref&gt; However, public relations issues continue to plague the League. A report from the Democratic members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce said that "the NFL rescinded a gift to the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) for concussion research when it learned the study's findings would be detrimental to the league's image."&lt;ref&gt;Vasilogambros, Matt. "The NFL's Concussion Cover-Up." The Atlantic, May 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The N.F.L had tried to funnel the funds it gave to the NIH towards its own studies. The League rejected the accusations.&lt;ref&gt;Fainaru, Steve, and Mark Fainaru-Wada. "Congressional report says NFL waged improper campaign to influence government study." ESPN.&lt;/ref&gt;

To mitigate the public relations (PR) nightmare, the NFL has taken several steps to better assure player safety and bring awareness to head injuries in football players of all ages. Several rule changes took place between 2007 and 2014. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell issued a memo in December 2009 to all 32 teams stating that a player who sustains a concussion cannot return to play if he shows signs or symptoms, such as inability to remember assignments or plays, a gap in memory and persistent dizziness. This move changed the 2007 rule saying a player cannot return only if he has lost consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;NFL "Goodell issues memo changing return-to-play rules for concussions."&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, new rules regarding "crown of the helmet" tackles have been installed where a runner or a tackler cannot initiate forcible contact with the crown of the helmet outside the tackle box so as to protect players' heads.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael David. "NFL officiating video stresses new "crown of the helmet" rule." NBC Sports.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, the NFL and [[USA Football]] launched the [https://usafootball.com/programs/heads-up-football/ Heads Up Football] initiative, which "emphasizes a smarter and safer way to play and teach youth football, including proper tackling and taking the head out of the game."&lt;ref&gt;NFL "NFL celebrates USA Football Month with launch of USA Football's Heads Up Football initiative."&lt;/ref&gt; A mobile application was also launched with help from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] where information about concussion protocols and player health and safety can be easily reached by parents and coaches.

The PR issues surrounding the NFL's cover-up of concussions are far from over, and it is too early to tell how and to what extent these events will impact the NFL or football playing. Robert Boland, professor of sports management at [[New York University]] and former college football player says, "In the short-run, [the NFL] is still thriving," but downward trends in youth football players shows that future generations "might have less of an intimate attachment to the sport."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Drummond, Katie. "Can the NFL survive its concussion crisis?." The Verge.&lt;/ref&gt; Boland says this in light of [[Pop Warner]] football enrollment dropping by 9.5 percent between 2010 and 2012, likely linked to the high-profile concussion problem.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===Federal NFL concussion litigation===
In April 2011, attorneys [[Sol H. Weiss]] and [[Larry E. Coben]] from the Philadelphia law firm of Anapol Weiss filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of [[Ray Easterling]], [[Jim McMahon]] and five other players. Thousands of former NFL players have since filed lawsuits against the League after suffering repeated concussions throughout their careers.

The multidistrict litigation (MDL) titled In re: National Football League Players' Concussion Injury Litigation (MDL 2323) was filed on January 31, 2012 in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania]]. Judge [[Anita B. Brody]] presides over the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dockets.justia.com/docket/pennsylvania/paedce/2:2012md02323/457890/|title=MDL-2323 IN RE: NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE PLAYERS' CONCUSSION INJURY LITIGATION|date=2012-01-31|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The master administrative long-form [[complaint]], filed by Plaintiff's Co-Lead Counsel Sol Weiss and [[Christopher A. Seeger|Christopher Seeger]] on June 7, 2012, alleges the League "... was aware of the evidence and the risks associated with repetitive traumatic brain injuries virtually at the inception, but deliberately ignored and actively concealed the information from the Plaintiffs and all others who participated in organized football at all levels." The master complaint argues the NFL knew or should have known players who sustain repetitive head injuries are at risk of suffering "... early-onset of Alzheimer's Disease, [[dementia]], depression, deficits in [[cognitive function]]ing, reduced processing speed, attention, and reasoning, loss of memory, sleeplessness, moods swings, personality changes, and the debilitating and latent disease known as [[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] ('CTE')."

In April 2012, Easterling was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/five-nfl-players-whove-died-self-inflicted-gunshot-002000760--nfl.html|title=Five NFL Players Who've Died from a Self-Inflicted Gunshot Wound|publisher=Yahoo Sports|date=2012-07-30|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; An autopsy report concluded Easterling's brain had evidence of CTE, a degenerative brain disease associated with frequent blows to the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/27/sports/football/ray-easterling-autopsy-found-signs-of-brain-disease-cte.html|title=Football Player Who Killed Himself Had Brain Disease|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=2012-07-26|accessdate=2013-09-03|first=Mike|last=Tierney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One month later, former [[San Diego Chargers]] player [[Junior Seau]] also died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and a brain autopsy showed he suffered from CTE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/8830344/study-junior-seau-brain-shows-chronic-brain-damage-found-other-nfl-football-players|title=Doctors: Junior Seau's brain had CTE|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2013-01-13|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Easterling and Seau, an autopsy of Bears safety [[Dave Duerson]]'s brain after he committed [[suicide]] earlier that year revealed he also suffered from the same degenerative brain disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/sports/football/03duerson.html?_r=0|title=Duerson's Brain Trauma Diagnosed|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=2011-05-13|accessdate=2013-09-03|first=Alan|last=Schwarz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The autopsy results following these players' suicides heightened existing concerns regarding the connection between player deaths and concussions.

In August 2012, the number of players involved in suits against the NFL increased to 3,402, and the League sued three dozen insurance companies in an attempt to force them to cover the costs of defending claims of not protecting players.

However, the proposal was met with criticism from players like running backs [[Matt Forte]], [[Emmitt Smith]] and [[Marshall Faulk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Larry|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-1/Matt-Forte-calls-proposed-new-rule-absurd/c120925a-70ee-44b5-8adb-e974e44af1b1|title=Matt Forte calls proposed new rule absurd|publisher=[[Chicago Bears]]|date=2013-03-18|accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A federal hearing was held on April 9, 2013 in Philadelphia to discuss the League's motion to dismiss the lawsuits brought on behalf of more than 4,500 former players On July 8, 2013, Judge Brody ordered representatives of both sides of the litigation to explore a possible settlement in the litigation. Judge Brody ordered a report on or before September 3, 2013 regarding the results of the mediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nflconcussionmdl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Order-on-mediation-7-8-13.pdf|title=Mediation Order|accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposed settlement was reached in the litigation on August 29, 2013. Under the agreement, the NFL will contribute $765 million to provide medical help to more than 18,000 former players. Retired players who suffer severe neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) diseases in the future will also be eligible to apply for medical help. In addition, $10 million will fund brain injury research as well as safety and education programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=John|url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-08-31/news/41622052_1_retired-players-former-players-ray-easterling|title=NFL ex-players reach $765 million deal in concussion case|publisher=[[Philly.com]]|date=2013-08-29|accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement says it should not be interpreted as a statement of legal liability on the part of the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=NFL, Retired Players Resolve Concussion Litigation; Court-Appointed Mediator Hails Historic Agreement|publisher=Alternative Dispute Resolution Center|date=August 29, 2013|url=http://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/press-release-2.pdf|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement, which is projected to protect retired players for nearly 65 years, will compensate injured former players who need immediate help and will provide baseline assessments and medical benefits to those who are symptom-free or beginning to show signs of neurological problems.

"I think it's more important that the players have finality, that they're vindicated, and that as soon as the court approves the settlement they can begin to get screening, and those that are injured can get their compensation. I think that's more important than looking at some documents," attorney Weiss said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2013/08/29/nfl-players-reach-proposed-765m-settlement-concussion-related-lawsuits/|title=NFL players reach proposed $765M settlement of concussion-related lawsuits|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=2013-08-29|accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement also allows a player diagnosed with CTE the eligibility to up to 4 million dollars in compensation. This has been met with criticism of the settlement's structure as it only applies to players diagnosed before the settlements preliminary agreement and disallows those diagnosed after the approval of the deal in July.&lt;ref name="Breslow"/&gt;

The NFL has paid nearly $1 billion in settlements from claims alleging long-term injuries from repeated blows to the head. Courts have examined these claims using a "Trigger" process. This trigger process includes 4 triggers: The "exposure" trigger, the "manifestation" trigger, the "injury-in-fact" trigger, and the "continuous" trigger. Reiter, Thomas M., and Lucas J. Tanglen.

===Kansas City Chiefs concussion lawsuit===
On December 3, 2013, five former NFL players filed a lawsuit against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] organization: former Chiefs players [[Alexander Cooper (American football)|Alexander Cooper]], [[Leonard Griffin (American football)|Leonard Griffin]], [[Christopher Martin (American football)|Christopher Martin]], [[Joe Phillips (American football)|Joe Phillips]], and [[Kevin Porter (American football)|Kevin Porter]]. They wish to know what the Chiefs knew about concussions and when they knew it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paylor|first=Terez|title=Five Former Players Sue Chiefs over Consusisons|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2013/12/03/4666316/five-former-players-suing-chiefs.html#storylink=cpy|publisher=The Kansas City Star|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This lawsuit is unique and different from the thousands of lawsuits previously filed against the NFL. These players are not suing the NFL, and are instead suing the Chiefs.

From 1987 to 1993 there was no [[Collective Bargaining Agreement]] established in the NFL. With no existence of a CBA in these years, players who played during this time for the Chiefs can sue the team for many of the same reasons the NFL has been sued. The $765 million settlement in August 2013 between the NFL and former players only protected the NFL. "I think all of our clients were disappointed," McClain said of his clients reaction to the settlement with the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paylor|first=Terez|title=Five Former Players Suing Chiefs over Concussions|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2013/12/03/4666316/five-former-players-suing-chiefs.html|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The players currently suing the Chiefs have all opted-out of the settlement from the previous mediation with the NFL.

A law unique to Missouri allows certain former NFL players to sue the individual team. The current Missouri law states that employees can sue employers in civil court if the employees declined worker's compensation. The Independence attorney for the five ex-Chiefs, Ken McClain said, "The lawsuit is allowed in Missouri after a state workers' compensation statute was amended in 2005 to exclude cases of occupational injury that occur over an extended time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drapper|first=Bill|title=Five ex-Chiefs sue Kansas City over concussions|url=http://www.delcotimes.com/sports/20131203/five-ex-chiefs-sue-kansas-city-over-concussions|publisher=Daily Times|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendment of the 2005 law is set to be changed at the end of December 2013. Martin and McClain have both encouraged former players who are eligible to join the lawsuit before their window of opportunity expires.

On December 1, 2012, [[Jovan Belcher]], current member of the Kansas City Chiefs, shot and killed his fiancée, Kassandra Perkins, before committing suicide in the Arrowhead practice facility parking lot. On behalf of Belcher's and Perkin's daughter, lawyers have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the Chiefs. Belcher's mother has filed a similar suit accusing the Chiefs of ignoring Belcher's cries for help as he complained of concussion like symptoms. The first occurrence came against Jacksonville in 2009 where Belcher was knocked unconscious and failed to receive adequate treatment. The second occurrence was against the Bengals in November 2012. The lawsuits allege, Belcher "suffered what should have been recognized as an acute concussion." However, one lawsuit continues, "despite exhibiting obvious symptoms, Decedent was never removed from play for evaluation and recovery." The lawsuits also claims Belcher exhibited signs of CTE, including changes in his mood and behavior.&lt;ref name="Delsohn"&gt;{{cite web|last=Delsohn|first=Steve|title=OTL:Belcher's Brain Had CTE Signs|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/11612386/jovan-belcher-brain-showed-signs-cte-doctor-says-report|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 2014, it was announced that the brain of former Kansas City Chiefs player, Jovan Belcher, contained neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein; which is associated with Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. The tangles were distributed throughout Belcher's hippocampus, an area of the brain involved with memory, learning and emotion. If the findings of CTE come to be true, Belcher's daughter and mother are eligible for up to $4 million under the National Football League's current Collective Bargaining Agreement.&lt;ref name="Delsohn"/&gt;

===Cook County, Illinois Riddell concussion litigation===
On March 11, 2016, the family of deceased San Diego Charger defensive back [[Paul Oliver (American football)|Paul Oliver]] sued helmet-maker [[Riddell Sports Group, Inc.|Riddell]] along with its related corporate entities, in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois.  Shortly thereafter, NFL hall of fame running back and Super Bowl champion [[Paul Hornung]], represented by [[The Brad Sohn Law Firm]] and [[Corboy &amp; Demetrio]], filed a related case against these defendants.  Now, some 100 former professional players have sued Riddell in the consolidated litigation in Cook County, which alleges Riddell to have conspired with the NFL in creating false science.  Riddell's attempt at the same federal labor preemption defense attempted by the NFL failed.  The NFL remains subject to discovery in this case, even though it is a non-party.

The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], like the NFL, has been criticized for its handling of concussions, with numerous players having retired from football due to concussions, or have filed lawsuits against the association for failing to protect student-athletes from concussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Post Comment|url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2013/09/04/former-football-players-sue-ncaa-over-concussions/2762575/|title = Former college football player sues NCAA in federal court over concussions|publisher = USA Today|date = 2013-09-04|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, former players Derek Owens and Alex Rucks filed lawsuits against the association for failing to cover the players' safety.

The panel also had recommended for an athlete to be sidelined after any concussion-related injury until he/she has been cleared by a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=4746679|title=NCAA recommends stricter rules on concussions|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2009-12-15|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the new plan, all student-athletes must sign statements saying that they will report all signs and symptoms of concussions to their coaches.  In addition, all athletes must have baseline cognitive testing while the post-injury cognitive testing is strongly recommended.  The athletes diagnosed with concussions must be removed from sports for a minimum of one day and can only return when decided by a team physician.

==Concussions in other leagues==

===Canadian Football League===
In the [[2010 CFL season|2010 season]] for the [[Canadian Football League]], there have been 50 reported concussions; 44.8 percent of players reported having a concussion or concussion-like symptoms, 16.9 percent had confirmed that they had a concussion, and 69.6 percent of all players who suffered from concussions that year suffered from more than one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reactcanada.org/EN/resources/articles/sport_specific/CFL_DELANEY.pdf|title=Concussions During the 1997 Canadian Football League Season|work=[[Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine]]|format=PDF|accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the average of 0.59 concussions per game is lower than the 0.67 recorded by the NFL in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/football/cfl/argos/article/971336--cfl-concussions-not-always-revealed-to-fans|title=CFL concussions not always revealed to fans|work=The Star|date=2011-04-07|accessdate=2012-06-27|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league eventually started a concussion-awareness program with the help of [[Football Canada]], [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] (CIS), the [[Canadian School Sport Federation]], the [[Canadian Football League Players Association]] (CFLPA), the [[Canadian Football League Alumni Association]] (CFLAA), and the [[ThinkFirst]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/football/article/985088--canadian-football-tackles-concussions-head-on|title=Canadian football tackles concussions head-on|work=The Star|date=2011-05-03|accessdate=2012-06-27|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league eventually pointed out eight protocols:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/article/working-to-promote-concussion-awareness|title=Official Site of the Canadian Football League|publisher=CFL.ca|date=2011-05-03|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Team physicians and therapists are to use a SCAT2 (a medical protocol), to diagnose concussions and preventing athletes from playing until they have been cleared to play.
* All players are to be submitted to IMPACT, which is a form of cognitive testing, during training camp.
* All player concussion assessments in the CFL are to only be used by team physicians and therapists.
* All coaches and players will receive educational items to aid in recognizing signs of a concussion.
* Administrators are to report a change from the expectation that a player returns to the game to one that encourages players to be honest about symptoms.
* The formation of certification programs that teach coaches how to recognize the symptoms of concussions.
* The formation of training programs for coaches that emphasize that players should never use their helmets to tackle.
* A new rule in the amateur football rulebook was implemented that requires officials to report suspected concussed players to the coaching or medical staff during games.

In 2012, ThinkFirst founder and [[Toronto Western Hospital]] neurosurgeon Charles Tator led a study that was conducted by the [[University of Toronto]], which examined the brains of 20 former players with a history of concussions, and compared them to 20 other players without a history of head injury. A separate group of 20 without football experience served as a control group. Also in 2012, the league and Tator announced a partnership to work in a study that would perform postmortem tests on former CFL players to look for signs of CTE.&lt;ref name="Study"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cflaa.ca/2012/may-5-2012-former-cfl-players-to-be-studied-for-long-term-concussion-effects/|title=Former CFL players to be studied for long term concussion effects|publisher=Canadian Football League Alumni Association|date=May 5, 2012|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arena Football League===
In the [[Arena Football League]], despite the league's intense play, very few lawsuits have been filed for concussions. The most notable lawsuit against the league was a lawsuit filed by former [[Colorado Crush]] kicker [[Clay Rush]] in 2010, who claimed that he suffered from permanent brain damage due to repeated blows to the head during games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/sports/football/19concussions.html|title=Lawsuit Cites Mishandling of Football Concussions|author=Alan Schwarz|date=18 March 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the NFL, the AFL prohibits players who suffered from concussions from practicing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sports/more-sports/arena-football-league-adopts-strict-guidelines-on-concussions-296455/?p=0|title=Arena Football League adopts strict guidelines on concussions|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=2012-03-29|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, during the original league's [[2008 Arena Football League season|final season]], the "Shockometer" made its debut at two season-opening games ([[Dallas Desperados]] vs. [[Georgia Force]]/[[San Jose SaberCats]] vs. [[Chicago Rush]]) on 40 player helmets. The device is projected to sell for $30 if it is to become available on the market.&lt;ref name=Shockometer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/afl/news/story?id=3269214|title=Indicator on AFL helmets to warn of potentially dangerous hits|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2008-02-28|accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The players that were given the device play positions that are suspectible to hard hits, such as wide receivers, defensive backs, running backs, and linebackers. AFL Players Association regional director James Guidry stated that the red light doesn't mean that the player has a concussion, but as a warning for team examiners to inspect the player. Guidry also said that the device could be used to prevent players who do not want to show any signs of weakness after sustaining any concussion-like symptoms from continuing to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nflplayers.com/Articles/Public-News/AFL-Test-Drives-Schutt%e2%80%99s-Shockometer/|title=AFL-Test-Drives-Schutt's-Shockometer / News|publisher=NFLPlayers.com|date=2008-05-22|accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth football===
Youth athletes make up 70% of football players in the United States. Every year there are 23,000 nonfatal traumatic brain injuries stemming from playing football that required an emergency visit to the hospital.  Of those visits, 90% of them are children between the ages of 5–18 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=L. Syd|title=Return to Play Guidelines Cannot Solve the Football-Related Concussion Problem|journal=Journal of School Health|volume=82|pages=180–185|doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.2011.00684.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted from 2010-2104 showed that of the 529 million emergency room visits; 819,000 were contact sport related. This accounted for 0.15% of all emergency visits. This number although small, may effect and cause ramifications in the American healthcare system. Theses figures are represented with nearly 80-90% of that of the youth population {ages 7-18).  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGinity|first=Michael|date=2018|title=The impact of tackle football injuries of the American healthcare system|url=http://link.galegroup.com.exproxy.jccc.edu/apps/doc/A5376681/AONE?u=jcl_jccc&amp;sid=AONE&amp;xid=5a1116f7|journal=Academic OneFile|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first studies of its kind was performed during the Fall 2011 football season when researchers from [[Virginia Tech]], receiving permission from parents, placed [[accelerometer]]s (which measure [[g force]]s) inside the helmets of seven youth players. These seven players were 7- and 8-year-old boys participating in a community youth league who were chosen because they were expected to have high participation and also because they wore at least a youth medium [[Riddell Sports Group, Inc.|Riddell]] Revolution helmet (enabling the accelerometers, [[battery (electricity)|battery]], and wireless transmitter to fit inside the helmet within the padding). That is, these seven were not a random selecting of players. Rather, the purpose of this study was to establish a baseline of what range of hits are generally expected.&lt;ref name=VirginiaTech2011YouthFootballStudy&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Daniel | first1 = R.

As way of comparison, a collision of 80g is a big hit in a college football game of which there might be only six per game. And the range of 80, 90, or 100g is generally where risk of acute injury and [[concussion]] begins to occur (concussion being symptoms such as feeling foggy or woozy and not necessarily loss of consciousness). An example of a lesser force of 40g is heading a [[soccer ball]], and even with blows in this 30 to 40g range, it is not known whether these pose a cumulative risk of injury.&lt;ref name=VirginiaTech2011YouthFootballStudy/&gt;

This 2011 study measured a total 753 impacts among these seven players with a median impact of 15g. It did, however, observe 38 impacts of 40g or greater, and six impacts of greater than 80g. Fortunately, none of these youth players experienced a concussion. There is also a concern that since many young players have less developed chest and neck muscles than older players, almost every impact potentially acts likes a surprise hit.&lt;ref name=VirginiaTech2011YouthFootballStudy/&gt;

A Virginia Tech doctor stated that reducing the number of higher hits during practice sessions constitutes a real opportunity. Of the 38 impacts of 40g or greater, 29 took place during practice. And of the six impacts greater than 80g, all took place during practice.&lt;ref name=VirginiaTech2011YouthFootballStudy/&gt;

The Center for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC's) has developed the "Heads Up concussion in Youth Sports." It helps youth coaches, players, and parents be more aware of a concussion. Heads up provides important information on preventing, recognizing and responding to a concussion. 63% of youth coaches viewed concussions being more serious, 72% said they are educating others about concussions, and 50% had learned something new.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.jccc.edu/pqrl/docview/1001027749/AB20FED092AE4579PQ/1?accountid=2200#center|title=Educating Coaches About Concussion in Sports: Evaluation of the CDC's "Heads Up: Concussion in Youth Sports" Initiative|last=Covassin, Elbin, Sarmiento.|first=Tracey, R J, Kelly|date=May 2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concussions in high school football===
Concussions are frequent in high school football. Football has the highest rate of concussion among high school sports, with about 11 concussions occurring per 10,000 athletic exposures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Breslow|first1=Jason|title=High School Football Players Face Bigger Concussion Risk|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/sports/league-of-denial/high-school-football-players-face-bigger-concussion-risk/|website=Frontline|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 50 high school or younger football players across the country were killed or sustained serious head injuries on the field since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2007/09/16/sports/20070916_CONCUSSION_GRAPHIC.html?ref=headinjuries&amp;_r=1&amp;|title=Young Players, Serious Injuries|work=New York Times|date=2007-09-16|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many concussions that occur during high school football often go untreated and are not monitored. This is a big concern because repeated trauma to the head, especially injuries with concussion like symptoms, puts a young athlete health at serious risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Unreported Concussion in High School Football Players: Impli... : Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine|url=http://journals.lww.com/cjsportsmed/Abstract/2004/01000/Unreported_Concussion_in_High_School_Football.3.aspx|journal=LWW|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2013 study by Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center found that, despite knowing the risk of serious injury from continuing to play with a concussion, half of high school football players would still play if they had a headache from an injury sustained on the field. Researchers surveyed 120 high school football players. Of those students, 30 reported having suffered a concussion. More than 90 percent recognized the risk of serious injury if they returned to play too quickly, but more than half of those aware of the risks responded they would "always or sometimes continue to play with a headache sustained from an injury," and only 54 percent indicated they would "always or sometimes report symptoms of a concussion to their coach."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-05/cchm-src050113.php|title=Study raises concerns that teen athletes continue to play with concussion symptoms|publisher=Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center|date=2013-05-06|accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that 15.8% of football players who sustain a concussion severe enough to cause loss of consciousness return to play the same day. Due to the fact that only 42% of high schools have access to athletic training services, there has been a large debate regarding the risks that high school football players face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics on Youth Sports Safety|url=http://www.clearedtoplay.org/concussion-information/concussions-by-the-numbers|website=Cleared to Play|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven high schools in North Central Florida agreed to take a written questionnaire evaluating the varsity football teams knowledge about concussions. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Research Subjects by the University of Florida. The review consisted of three sections. First was to identify symptoms of a concussion, second what they believed were possible consequences from not getting the proper treatment of a concussion, and the last section was to indicate if they have ever received information about concussions. 25% of them had never received information about concussion and only 54% had talked about the issue of a concussion with a parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4208870/|title=Concussion Knowledge in High School Football Players|last=Janie Cournoyer, MSc, ATC, CAT(C) and Brady L.

==Prevention efforts==
Numerous efforts have attempted to identify potential concussions quickly. Helmet [[shock data logger]]s and [[impact sensor]]s help monitor impacts a player receives.  One example is a device created by [[Schutt Sports]] during the [[Arena Football League]]'s 2008 season known as the "Shockometer"—a triangle-shaped object with adhesive on its side that sticks to players' helmets. When a player gets hit by a [[g-force]] which exceeds 98, a capsule with a green light in it will change to a red light. Doctors have determined that a g-force of approximately 100 will increase the risk of a concussion, even though a quarterback that gets sacked would normally register a g-force of 150 g. A possible flaw to the Shockometer is that fan activity could accidentally trigger the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/afl/news/story?id=3269214|title = Indicator on AFL helmets|work = ESPN|date = |accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Riddell Sports Group, Inc.|Riddell]] created the Head Impact Telemetry System (HITS) and Sideline Response System (SRS) to help record the frequency and severity of player impacts during practices and games. Every HITS helmet features MX Encoders, which would automatically record every hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riddell.com/innovation/hits-technology/|title=HITS™ Technology|publisher=Riddell|accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight NFL teams had planned to use the system in the {{NFL Year|2010}} season, but it was ultimately not used.&lt;ref name=HITS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/06/24/failure-to-use-hit-system-exposes-league-to-future-concussion-liability/|title=Failure to use HIT system exposes league to future concussion liability|publisher=Profootballtalk.nbcsports.com|date=June 24, 2012|accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Reebok]] developed the Head Impact Indicator, which is a [[quarter (United States coin)|quarter]]-sized device placed on a player's skull, which activates a red/yellow light if the player is hit too hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Sauser|first = Brittany|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/news/408643/a-helmet-that-detects-hard-hits/|title = A helmet that detects hard hits|publisher = [[National Football League]]|date = 2007-09-10|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to Reebok's Impact Indicator, Battle Sport Science has released the Impact Indicator 2.0.

Vicis, a Seattle-based firm, has created a new unique type of helmet that is very flexible due to the many layers that make up this new intricate helmet. This helmet consists of four layers, beginning with the Lode Shell. This layer absorbs the shock from the hit, which then leads to the Core Layer contorting and bending in all directions. This technology alleviates stress from the impact, which consists of all the linear and rotational forces involved in the hit. The Arch Shell exists directly under the Core Layer and is precisely designed to fit a player's head shape. The last layer, the Form Liner, works with the Arch Shell to apportion pressure evenly around the perimeter of the head. Instead of measuring a player's head the conventional way by taking the circumference, Vicis measures the length and width of the head to get more accurate data. A better fit of the helmet allows for the technology to work more advantageously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/zero-1-football-helmet-helps-prevent-concussions/|title=Flexible football helmet absorbs hits like a car bumper, could put an end to concussions|author=|date=4 April 2017|website=digitaltrends.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several NFL players have tried this new helmet and have provided great feedback. Cliff Avril from the Seattle Seahawks said, "You don't feel the thuds as hard as they normally are." In the NFL's 2017 Helmet Laboratory Testing Performance Results, the Vicis helmet finished first out of the 33 helmets that could have been worn in 2017 NFL season. Concussion-preventing technology continues to improve the safety in the game of football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geekwire.com/2017/seattle-seahawks-players-talk-experience-wearing-new-high-tech-vicis-helmet/|title=Seattle Seahawks players talk about their experience wearing new high-tech Vicis helmet|author=|date=28 August 2017|website=geekwire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NFL===

The National Football League has made numerous rule changes to reduce the number of concussions suffered by players while making the game safer.

In 2010, the NFL reworded the League's rules to prohibit a player from "launching himself off the ground and using his helmet to strike a player in a defenseless posture in the head or neck." Violations of this rule only result in the imposition of a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty. In the same season, the NFL mandated that once a player loses his helmet on the playing field, the current play must immediately be whistled dead.&lt;ref name="Thomas 425–452"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Drysdale|date=13 December 2013|title=Helmet-to-Helmet Contact: Avoiding a Lifetime Penalty by Creating a Duty to Scan Active NFL Players for Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy|journal=Journal of Legal Medicine|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis ltd|volume=34|issue=4|pages=425–452|doi=10.1080/01947648.2013.859969}}&lt;!--|accessdate=17 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2010, the NFL mandated that during field goals or extra point attempts, defenders must line up with their entire bodies on the outside of the snapper's body to protect the snapper while he is in a position of vulnerability. Violations of this rule, however, result in only a five-yard penalty for illegal formation.&lt;ref name="Thomas 425–452"/&gt;

The Competition Committee reviews all competitive aspects of the game, including playing rules, roster regulations, technology, game-day operations and player protection. The process for modifying or adopting rules and regulations is systematic and consensus-oriented.&lt;ref&gt;playsmartplaysafe.com Coaching For Change:Rule Changes Designed to Improve Health and Safety. website.&lt;/ref&gt;

To reinforce the seriousness of the rule changes, in the middle of the 2010 season, Commissioner Goodell issued a memo to all NFL teams stating that "more significant discipline, including suspensions, will be imposed on players that strike an opponent in the head or neck area in violation of the rules."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81b7b9ef/article/goodell-issues-memo-enforcing-player-safety-rules|title=Goodell issues memo enforcing player safety rules|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=2012-07-26|accessdate=2014-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most drastic step the NFL has taken to reduce head injuries was the 2010 change to the NFL kickoff rules. To reduce what has been referred to as one of the most violent plays in the game, the kickoff was moved up from the 30-yard line to the 35-yard line. The NFL also outlawed the use of the three-man wedge on kickoffs, while allowing the two-man wedge to remain a legal play. Consequently, players on the kicking team must now line up closer to midfield, reducing the amount of space the players have in which to get a running start.&lt;ref name="Thomas 425–452"/&gt;

In 2011, the NFL also mandated that certified athletic trainers be available in press boxes during all NFL games. These athletic trainers assist medical personnel located on the sidelines in identifying potential concussions because the symptoms are often difficult to spot and assess from the field level.&lt;ref name="Thomas 425–452"/&gt;

On March 20, 2013, the NFL voted to introduce yet another new rule aimed at player safety. Starting in the 2013-2014 season, if a running back lowers the crown of his helmet while he is inside the tackle box or while he is less than three yards downfield and makes contact with a defender, the team will be given a 15-yard penalty.&lt;ref name="Thomas 425–452"/&gt;

After three years of declines in reported cases, the 2015 regular season contained a spike in concussions even after making several improvements the previous year. The total cases reported for the practices, pre-season, and regular season was 271, a 31.6 percent spike. The 2015 cases reported for regular season games was 182, a 58.3 percent spike.&lt;ref&gt;Shpigel, Ben. (29 January 2016). Diagnoses of Concussions Increase by Nearly a Third Over Last Season.

In the 2016 offseason, the NFL implemented a new policy to their concussion protocol. The NFL can now punish teams that do not follow their concussion protocol by imposing a monetary fine or taking away their draft picks. The first violation can be a fine up to $150,000 and the second violation can be a fine no less than $100,000 and a possible removal of draft picks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/nfl-concussion-protocol-policy-history|title=What is the NFL's concussion protocol?|author=|date=|website=si.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Seattle Seahawks were under much scrutiny for violating the NFL's concussion protocol by allowing [[Russell Wilson]] to return to the game against the Arizona Cardinals without the proper treatment.

=== WFA ===
The Women's Football Alliance has come a long way when it comes to the guidelines on making the game safer for its players.

from 2012 to 2017 they have since made it illegal to send a player back into the game with suspicions of a concussion unless cleared by a certified health official.

===Youth football===

Return to play guidelines (RTPs), such as Washington State's  Lystedt Law, have been legally mandated since 2009.  All 50 states, including Washington D.C, have now passed legislation to help reduce the number of traumatic brain injuries in youth football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bachynski|first1=Kathleen|title=Youth Sports &amp; Public Health:  Framing Risks of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in American Football and Ice Hockey|journal=Journal of Law, Medicine &amp;Ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator Dick Durbin, from Illinois, introduced the Protecting Student Athletes from Concussions Act on September 25, 2013 to the U.S. Senate.  This act would require athletes, parents, coaches and school officials to be informed of the risks of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and it would also require the "when in doubt, sit it out" policy to be used  with athletes that have been suspected of having a concussion and be removed from the field of play.  A press release from Senator Durbin stated that many major U.S. sports organizations, including the NFL and NHL, endorsed the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bachynski|first1=Kathleen|title=Youth Sports &amp; Public Health: Framing Risks of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in American Football and Ice Hockey|journal=Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics|issue=Fall 2014|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[Pop Warner Little Scholars|Pop Warner]] league banned kickoffs in an attempt to reduce high-speed collisions that result in concussions.&lt;ref name=Belson&gt;{{cite news |last1=Belson |first1=Ken |title=Pop Warner Bans Kickoffs in Hopes of Protecting Its Youngest Players |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/sports/football/pop-warner-bans-kickoffs-concussions-nfl.html |accessdate=June 23, 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Screening procedure==
{{Dubious|1=Screening procedures|reason= NPOV, dubious, hyperbole, promotional, FDA smackdown|date=April 2015}}

In September 2015, researchers with the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] and [[Boston University]] announced that they had identified CTE in 96 percent of NFL players that they had examined and in 79 percent of all football players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Breslow|first=Jason|title=New: 87 Deceased NFL Players Test Positive for Brain Disease|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/new-87-deceased-nfl-players-test-positive-for-brain-disease/|accessdate=9 January 2016|publisher=Frontline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of February 2015, Gary Small and colleagues have been called into question by the [[FDA]] for their overzealous commercialization and promotion of clinically unproven screening that fellow peer researchers deem fit only for research and they have responded by withdrawing related materials from their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-brain-scan-warning-taumark-20150410-story.html|title= FDA forces UCLA researchers to stop touting experimental dementia scan|first= Alan |last= Zarembo|date= Apr 10, 2015|publisher= LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date= Feb 15, 2015|url= http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/EnforcementActivitiesbyFDA/WarningLettersandNoticeofViolationLetterstoPharmaceuticalCompanies/UCM436520.pdf|title= Warning Letters and Notice of Violation Letters|publisher= FDA|quote= Restrict promotional claims of safety or effectiveness of the drug for a use for which it is under investigation and to preclude commercialization of the drug before it is approved for commercial distribution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, all screening procedures that examine football players for brain damage have been post mortem. In 2013, Gary Small and colleagues developed an in vivo chemical tracer that can detect tau protein build up in living players. Small and his team invented this new chemical tracer, 2-(1-&lt;nowiki/&gt;{6-[(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile, or FDDNP, that could be used in [[Positron Emission Tomography]] (PET) scans.&lt;ref name="Small 2013 138-144"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Small|first=G.W.|title=PET Scanning of Brain Tau in Retired National League Football Players: Preliminary Findings|journal=American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry|year=2013|volume=21|issue=2|pages=138–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new tracer measures for tau protein and amyloid plaque accumulation in human brains; symptoms of repetitive brain trauma among other things. Although tracers have been developed to screen for the build-up of tau proteins in the human brain, FDDNP is the first PET tracer that can be used in vivo in human trials. FDDNP was originally developed in an effort to detect Alzheimer's in elderly individuals, thus the article was published in the [[The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry|journal]] of the [[American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry]]. However, because there are similarities between Alzheimer's and the effects of [[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy|Chronic Traumatic Encephelopathy]] (CTE), FDDNP was used to study the extent of brain trauma in consenting, retired NFL players.

Small and colleagues performed a controlled experiment on retired NFL players and an equal number of control participants. Unfortunately the sample size was very small as only 5 players of the 19 contacted were eligible for the study. Though the sample size was small, a good range of positions were represented (linebacker, quarterback, offensive lineman, defensive lineman, and a center) and all players had played in the league at least 10 years. The players had to be at least 45 years of age and currently exhibit symptoms of cognitive and mood disruption. Control participants had to meet certain criteria as well to ensure that they were as similar as possible to the NFL players in order to eliminate any biases or confounding variables. Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), years of education, and family history of dementia were all selected as the selection criteria for control participants. All participants received intravenous injections of the FDDNP tracer and were tested over 4 weeks using PET imaging technology.
	
The injection of the FDDNP tracer was successful, and the results of the study showed significant differences between the NFL players and control participants. The NFL players had significantly higher FDDNP signals than control participants, indicating a greater amount of tau protein accumulation. The cortical regions of all the participants studied showed no significant difference, but the NFL players had FDDNP levels that were significantly higher in the caudate, putamen, thalamus, sub thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellar white matter regions of the brain as compared to the control participants.&lt;ref name="Small 2013 138-144"/&gt; In addition, a positive correlation was found between the number of head injuries the players sustained and the levels of FDDNP binding. This suggests that players with a more severe history of head trauma will likely have significantly more accumulation of tau protein. This, in turn, gives rise to the suggestion that a more severe history of head trauma will result in greater deterioration of the brain, cognitive functioning, and mood regulation.

The findings of the study were consistent with previous autopsy studies of individuals with CTE. The important distinction to make, however, is that the patients in Small's study were not on the slab and walked out after testing was completed. This is monumental in the field of brain trauma and concussion research.

Based on recent new blood tests; evidence is revealing no change in blood plasma tau and serum neurofilament light concentrations following sport related concussions. However these levels did rise in more severe concussion sport related injuries. This can can potentially suggest that a new blood test be developed and help aid in identifying the severity of concussion, and assist in concussion protocols. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 2018|title=New Biomarkers Study Results Reported from University of British Columbia (No change in plasma tau and serum concentrations in adolescent athletes following sport-related concussions.|url=http://link.galegroup.com.ezproxy.jccc.edu/apps/doc/A561840507/AONE?u=jcl_jccc&amp;sid=AONE&amp;xid=811a449a|journal=Obesity, Fitness &amp; Wellness|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recovery efforts==
Concussions are proven to cause loss of brain function. This can lead to physical and emotional symptoms such as attention disorders, depression, headaches, nausea, and amnesia. These symptoms can last for days or week and even after the symptoms have gone, the brain still won't be completely normal. Players with multiple concussions can have drastically worsened symptoms and exponentially increased recovery time.

Researchers at UCLA used a brain-imaging tool to identify a certain protein found in five retired NFL players. The presence and accumulation of tau proteins found in the five living players, are associated with [[Alzheimer's]] disease. Previously, this type of exam could only be performed with an autopsy. Scientists at UCLA created a chemical marker that binds to the abnormal proteins and they are able to view this with [[Positron Emission Tomography]] (PET) scan. Researcher at UCLA, Gary Small explains, "Providing a non-invasive method for early detection is a critical first step in developing interventions to prevent symptom onset and progression in [[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy|CTE]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Imaging Study of Concussion-Related Abnormal Brain Proteins In Retired NFL Players|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/255241.php|publisher=Medical News Today|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-Concussive Symptoms (PCS) is an area of recovery that is often not discussed. New evidence suggest that new recovery protocols have been recommended and designed to more adequately and efficiently recover from concussions. PCS is a concussion symptom lasting longer than 14 days. Current protocols suggest that the athlete refrain from any physical activity until symptoms free. However, according to the Journal of Athletic Training "A physiological approach to prolonged recovery from sport-related concussion" suggests some aerobic activity may be beneficial to more appropriate healing from concussion, and may lessen the reoccurrence of repeated concussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leddy|first=John|date=no. 3, 2017|title=A physiological approach to prolonged recovery from sport-related concussion|url=|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|volume= 52|pages= 299+|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been promising evidence that blood flow restriction based exercises can be used to improve Post-Concussion Syndrome (PCS). "The leading theory supporting this is that human growth hormone is released in response to increased lactate production from exercise, enhancing the brain function and recovery". This exercise based program could potentially be used in conjunction with aerobic therapy to better improve concussion symptoms during the recovery process. Wu, Yi-Ning, "Stable recovery after aerobic exercise with limb blood flow restriction and cooling in individuals with post-concussion syndrome", Physical medicine and rehabilitation clinics of North America, p. 437-54. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;==

The designs for all three dresses were entrusted by Siti to the duo.&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - EH2"/&gt; For the first dress, they used a red [[Net (textile)|net cloth]] that comes with [[Motif (textile arts)|motifs]] sewn into it.&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - EH2"/&gt; For the second dress, inspired from the first time Siti worked with them, they used red [[lace]] and net to make the dress.&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - EH2"/&gt; For the final dress, which was a striped sequin gold dress with a red base and side panels,&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - Budiey2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenangan Indah di Konsert Dato’ Siti Nurhaliza &amp; Friends|trans-title=The Sweet Memories of Dato' Siti Nurhaliza &amp; Friends Concert|url=http://www.budiey.com/ulasan-konsert-dato-siti-nurhaliza-friends/|language=ms|author=Budiey Isma|date=April 4, 2016|work=Budiey.com|accessdate = 10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; they used fabrics that are full of [[sequins]] to make it.&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - EH2"/&gt; Few adjustments were done to the designs after they saw her during the full rehearsals of the concert, including changing the colours of her [[Tudong|tudungs]].&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - EH2"/&gt; All three dresses were made from imported fabrics and materials.&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - EH2"/&gt; It took them three weeks to finish designing and creating all the dresses.&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - EH2"/&gt;

===Synopsis===
[[File:Siti Nurhaliza Performing Memories - Dato' Siti Nurhaliza &amp; Friends.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Siti Nurhaliza performing "Memories" for the first time at the ''Dato' Siti Nurhaliza &amp; Friends Concert''.]]
''Dato' Siti Nurhaliza &amp; Friends Concert'' has three main segments. The first segment saw her performing her songs as "[[Acoustic music|unplugged]]" while the second and her last segment saw her being accompanied by a live band and a full orchestra respectively.&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - The Sun"&gt;{{cite web|title=Siti at her best|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/1752253|author=Bissme S.|date=April 6, 2016|work=[[The Sun (Malaysia)|The Sun]]|accessdate = 10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-hour concert began close to 9 p.m. with an opening dance routine by a young girl which is said "to represent Siti as a young girl who dreamt of becoming an entertainer".&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - The Sun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - NST"&gt;{{cite web|title=Siti Nurhaliza gave her fans a night to remember|url=http://www.nst.com.my/news/2016/04/136849/siti-nurhaliza-gave-her-fans-night-remember|author=Bibi Nurshuhada Ramli|date=April 3, 2016|work=[[New Straits Times]]|accessdate = 10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siti later appeared on the stage to begin the "unplugged" segment of her concert with the acoustic rendition of "Aku Cinta Padamu". She later performed "Percayalah", "[[Jaga Dia Untukku]]", and "[[Terbaik Bagimu]]".&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - Budiey2"/&gt;

In the next segment with live band, accompanied by Sonaone and [[Too Phat|Joe Flizzow]], she performed a medley of her upbeat songs – "Ku Mahu", "Ku Milikmu", and "Destinasi Cinta".&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - Kosmo2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pesona 20 tahun Siti Nurhaliza|trans-title=The Charm[ing] 20 years of Siti Nurhaliza|url=http://kosmo.com.my/kosmo/content.asp?y=2016&amp;dt=0404&amp;pub=Kosmo&amp;sec=Hiburan&amp;pg=hi_01.htm|language=ms|author=Izwan Mohd Isa|date=April 4, 2016|work=[[Kosmo!]]|accessdate = 10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later invited on stage [[Anggun]] to perform a duet with Anggun's own song, "[[Snow on the Sahara (song)|Snow on the Sahara]]".

For the second half of the concert, she was accompanied by a full orchestra for the remaining songs of the set list.&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - The Sun"/&gt; The orchestra segment began with the performance of "Memories", a previously unreleased song by [[Whitney Houston]].&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - MS2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Memukau, Konsert Lima Bintang Siti Nurhaliza Sebelum Berehat Panjang|trans-title=Impressive.

She first sang with [[Hafiz (Malaysian singer)|Hafiz Suip]] for "[[Muara Hati]]" before proceeding with another duet with Cakra Khan for "[[Seluruh Cinta]]".&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - SH"/&gt; She then proceeded the show with the performance of "Menatap dalam Mimpi" and a medley of "Seindah Biasa" and "Kau Sangat Bererti".&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - MS2"/&gt; After the medley, she called on stage [[Faizal Tahir]] for the duet performance of "Bagaikan Sakti". After the duet, she briefly recalled the memories of her late father before tearing up since he was not there "to witness this momentous moment" with her.&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - MG2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Siti Nurhaliza menangis kenang arwah abah|trans-title=Siti Nurhaliza Cried [when] she remembers [her] late father|url=http://www.malaysiagazette.com/ms/hiburan/siti-nurhaliza-menangis-kenang-arwah-abah|language=ms|author=Malaysia Gazette Staff|date=April 4, 2016|work=MalaysiaGazette.com|accessdate = 10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Original:"''untuk menyaksikan detik bersejarah ini''"}} After the brief recollection, she was joined by [[Afgansyah Reza]] for the performance of "[[Biarlah Rahsia]]" before closing the orchestra segment of the concert with solo performance of "[[Lebih Indah]]".&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - SH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - MS2"/&gt; After she exited the stage, she later was accompanied by all her guest artists including [[Jaclyn Victor]] to the stage for the encore performance of "[[Kau Ilhamku]]".&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - SH"/&gt;

Throughout the concert, for every break and Siti's dress change, prerecorded video interviews with individuals who are closed with Siti were shown on the large screen at the back.&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - The Sun"/&gt; Individuals who were interviewed were including her close family members, friends, colleagues, and even her former school teachers.&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - The Sun"/&gt; At the end of the concert, music video for "Memories" was also shot and recorded for later release.&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - BH5"&gt;{{cite web|title=Siti Nurhaliza buktikan keunggulan dalam konsert istimewa|trans-title=Siti Nurhaliza proves [her] greatness in a special concert|url=http://www.bharian.com.my/node/139947|language=ms|author=Zaidi Mohamad|date=April 3, 2016|work=[[Berita Harian]]|accessdate = 10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
Vocal performances and overall showmanship of Siti and her duet partners were subjects of critics' appraisals. Although this concert marked Siti's first collaboration with Anggun, their duet performances were highly praised. Nadia Azam of ''[[Malaysiakini]]'' reviewed that Siti's duet with Anggun was "the most awaited performance of the night"&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - MK"/&gt;{{efn|Original:"''Bahagian paling menarik pada persembahan malam tadi [...]''"}} and Nor Amirah Mahmuddin of ''[[BERNAMA|Youth Bernama]]'' called the pair as a "unique combination".&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - YBernama2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Konsert Dua Dekad Siti Nurhaliza Cipta Sejarah|trans-title=Siti Nurhaliza's Two Decade Concert Creates A History|url=http://youth.bernama.com/v2/news.php?id=1232498|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413090453/http://youth.bernama.com/v2/news.php?id=1232498|archivedate=April 13, 2016|author=Nor Amirah Mahmuddin|date=April 6, 2016|work=[[BERNAMA|Youth BERNAMA]]|accessdate = 13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Original:"''gabungan unik''"}} Izwan Mohd Isa of ''[[Kosmo!]]'' commented that their vocals for the two duets of "[[Snow on the Sahara (song)|Snow on the Sahara]]" and "Bukan Cinta Biasa" were "utterly breathtaking".&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - Kosmo2"/&gt;{{efn|Original:"''sangat memukau''"}} Bissme S. of ''The Sun'' also shared the same sentiment. He commented, "Sometimes, when you have a duet with two skilled singers, things can go terribly wrong. They may try to upstage one other. Thankfully, that did not happen here. Anggun and Siti complemented each other perfectly. It was just two good friends having a good time on stage."&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - The Sun"/&gt; He also favoured Siti's duet with another Indonesian singer, Afgansyah Reza for "[[Biarlah Rahsia]]". He commented, "The combination of his raspy voice and her powerful vocals provided a unique and interesting flavour for the evening."&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - The Sun"/&gt; He also reviewed that Siti's duet with Faizal Tahir for "Bagaikan Sakti" was "memorable" and he "managed to put his own personality into the song."&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - The Sun"/&gt; Siti's duets with Cakra Khan and [[Hafiz (Malaysian singer)|Hafiz Suip]] for "[[Seluruh Cinta]]" and "[[Muara Hati]]" respectively were reviewed positively by Nor Amirah Mahmuddin of ''Youth Bernama'' who stated that Siti's vocals blended really well with her singing partners.&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - YBernama2"/&gt;

Siti's "digital duet" with Whitney Houston for the debut live performance of "Memories" was reviewed favourably by the critics. Siti Athirah Dzulkifly of ''[[Utusan Malaysia]]'' called the duet as "unique",&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - Utusan2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Signifikan dua dekad Siti Nurhaliza|trans-title=Siti Nurhaliza's Two Decades of Significance|url=http://www.utusan.com.my/hiburan/selebriti/signifikan-dua-dekad-siti-nurhaliza-1.232728|language=ms|author=Siti Athirah Dzulkifly|date=April 10, 2016|work=[[Utusan Malaysia]]|accessdate = 13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bissme S. of ''The Sun'' reviewed it as "one of the highlights of the night",&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - The Sun"/&gt; and Jemang Rahman of ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|mStar]]'' praised it as "Siti continues to spellbind thousands of her audience with her impressive vocals"&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - MS2"/&gt;{{efn|Original:"''Siti terus memukau ribuan penonton dengan vokal mantapnya [...]''"}} and "will be remembered by the audience".&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - MS2"/&gt;{{efn|Original:"''amat terkesan diingatan penonton''"}} Bissme S. of ''The Sun'', however, reviewed negatively the opening act of the dancing young girl. He criticized the routine as "tame, lame and dull" and "I think the concept didn’t work out as intended. Instead of enchanting everyone, this act made the crowd restless. We couldn’t wait for the dancing to stop and the music to begin."&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - The Sun"/&gt; He later added that Siti "saved the day" when she appeared on the stage and "from that point on, the concert was a roller coaster ride of pure entertainment."&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - The Sun"/&gt;

Overall, ''Dato Siti Nurhaliza &amp; Friends Concert'' received positive reviews and feedback from critics and concert reviewers. Haslina Kamaludin of ''[[Sinar Harian]]'' in her review stated, "IMPRESSIVE! That is what [one] can say after watching the ''Dato Siti Nurhaliza &amp; Friends Concert''. Overall, this concert deserves to be given five stars. From the aspect of its lighting, musicians, music arrangements, and her vocals, there are nothing left to be argued."&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - SH"/&gt;{{efn|Original:"''MANTAP! Hanya itu yang boleh diungkapkan usai menonton Konsert Datuk Siti Nurhaliza &amp; Friends. Secara keseluruhan, konsert ini layak diberikan lima bintang. Daripada segi pencahayaan, pemuzik, susunan muzik dan vokal penyanyi ini tidak ada yang perlu dipertikaikan lagi.''"}} A number of reviewers also echoed Haslina's review that the event is a 5-star concert.&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - Budiey2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - MS2"/&gt; Izwan Mohd Isa of ''Kosmo!'' in his review stated, "[...] In the 20 years that she has steered her career as a vocalist, this 37 years old woman has also never failed in placing herself among the best, until the point she was able to receive the "seal of approval" as the nation's number one singer by the public."&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - Kosmo2"/&gt;{{efn|Original:"''[...] dalam tempoh 20 tahun menakhodakan karier sebagai pelantun suara, wanita berusia 37 tahun itu juga belum pernah gagal meletakkan dirinya antara yang terbaik, sehingga melayakkan beliau menerima ‘cop mohor’ sebagai penyanyi nombor satu negara daripada khalayak.''"}} He concluded his review with:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
From the music arrangements, sound [system], stage organization and lighting techniques, Yonder Music has successfully created a fresh environment to visualize Siti's 20 years in the industry. This concert henceforth has become a benchmark for Siti as a credible entertainer who deserves to fly high in the music stratosphere for more than 20 years. May she live long with her career [continues] to 'mature' and [becomes more] profound.&lt;ref name="S&amp;F - Kosmo2"/&gt;{{efn|Original:"''Dari segi susunan muzik, bunyi, susun atur pentas dan teknik pencahayaan, pihak Yonder Music berjaya mewujudkan suasana segar bagi menggambarkan usia 20 tahun Siti bergelar anak seni. Konsert ini sekali gus menjadi penanda aras buat Siti sebagai penghibur berkredibiliti yang memang layak terbang tinggi di angkasa seni selama 20 tahun. Semoga Siti lanjut usia dengan karier yang lebih ‘masak’ dan hebat.''"}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Delmart "Mike" Vreeland''' (born March 20, 1966 in [[Mason, Michigan]]){{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} became notable for claiming to predict the events of [[September 11, 2001]].

Vreeland, wanted by police in eight Michigan jurisdictions for crimes like fraud and burglary was arrested in [[Iowa]]'s [[Franklin County, Iowa|Franklin County]] on October 20, 2004. According to Sheriff's Deputies, Vreeland ran an identity theft ring in the [[Detroit]] area for a few years and had felony convictions for breaking and entering and receiving stolen property. Shortly after the September 11 attacks, Vreeland apparently claimed that he wrote a note that foreshadowed those events while he was in prison.

Vreeland is reported to be a folk hero among [[conspiracy theorists]] who believe he is a spy for the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]].

'''Free tekno''', also known as '''freetekno''' and '''hardtek''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://techno.org/electronic-music-guide/hardtechno.swf|title=Ishkur's guide|author=Ishkur|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the name given to the music predominantly played at [[Free party|free parties]] in Europe. The spelling of the word tekno is made to deliberately differentiate the musical style from that of [[techno]]. The music is fast, normally 170 to 200 [[beats per minute|bpm]] and characterised by a pounding repetitive [[bass drum|kick drum]].&lt;ref&gt;Dover, Wanz [http://www.dallasobserver.com/music/10-dance-music-documentaries-that-will-make-you-an-expert-7081404 10 Dance Music Documentaries That Will Make You an Expert] ''Dallas Observer''. July 25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, bass drum distortion by [[clipping (audio)|clipping]] is used less often as in the related genre of [[mainstream hardcore|mainstyle hardcore]]. Nowadays, some tekno producers also use drum sets that rather sound [[trance (music)|trancey]], since many members of the tekno subculture as well as the [[psytrance]] subculture frequently attend the same [[rave|raves]] and the two scenes are closely connected. 

==History==
Tekno evolved in tandem with the [[teknival]] movement in the early 1990s since many of the teknival organisers and DJs were also making music. The music drew on influences such as [[Hardcore (electronic dance music genre)|hardcore]], [[rave]], [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]], [[early hardcore]] and [[techno]], with the producers taking the sound in a darker direction. Spiral tribe were the first to start making and widely disseminating this genre taking it to France and Eastern Europe after the Criminal Justice act was implemented in the UK. An emphasis is placed on samples from TV shows, films and popular culture which are placed at strategic moments in the tracks. The music was produced with whatever was available: [[drum machines]], [[synthesisers]] and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] as well as computer programs such as audio/MIDI sequencers and [[Music tracker|Trackers]], sometimes even hitting a random table with a pen. Starting from year 2001 there has been a trend using laptop and laptops for live performances, because the capabilities of both the hardware and software were improving very quick.

With the evolution of the genre it has come to be known by a number of names, including '''spiral tekno''', '''hardtek''', '''tribetek''', tribe and lately evolved in many other subgenres like pumping tek, hardfloor and French core which is a sort of mixture between mainstream Hardcore and Hardtekno, with funny and pumping samples taken from different media supports.

Tekno producers come from numerous places, particularly in [[Europe]], including the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and the [[Czech Republic]]. Some of the most active artist who from the early 90's up till the mid 2000s were [[Spiral Tribe]], Crystal Distortion, Lego, Liqitex, 69db, Ixy, Kaos, Jack Acid, Curley, Unit Moebius, Les Boucles Etranges, Yale, FKY, Babyon Joke, Arobass, Gotek, Floxytek, Suburbass, Zone-33, Mat Weasel Buster, Narkotek, Kernel Panik, Revolt99, Infrabass, Vinka, Banditos, Diablo (LSDF), Teknambul, Spiralheadz, Asphalt-Pirates, Aya Soundsystem, Puissance K, Guigoo, Billx, Maissouille, Key Gen, Psychospores, Fractal, Sceletor, and Lyzor-sak.

Many record labels contributed spreading the sound mostly via underground distribution operated mostly by record shops / labels such as Hokus Pokus (Paris) and Toolbox Records (Paris), and record labels such as Tek No Logique (TNL), Narkotek and Astrofonik.
Here a list of some of the most active record labels
[[Network 23 (record label)|Network 23]] record label [[Spiral Tribe]] [[Sound system (DJ)|sound system]], Hokus Pokus, Passe Muraille, Perce Oreille, Infrabass, KGB Records, OQP Crue Production, dSP records, Tek No Logique, Narkotek, Astrofonik, Le Diable Au Corps.

Artists within this genre usually follow a very different ideology when compared to more modern and mainstream producers:
* Artists often use many pseudonyms, as they are not interested in mainstream success or recognition
* Most are not interested in profit
* They also support the free distribution of their works, as they do not see it as their own material, but as something that belongs to the fans and the community
This is described as "returning to the roots".

==Subgenres==

'''Jungletek''' and '''Raggatek''' is a subgenres derived directly from Hardtek. These well known genres collide to create fast energetic 190 BPM dance floor smashers. Kicked of around 2008 here in the UK Mandidextrous &amp; Vandal were among the first producers to start writing this genre of music. It breathed new life into the underground rave scene not only here in the UK but also picking up a strong following in Italy, Spain and Austria to mention a few.  Massive influence for this music also came from the Techno scene in Europe where some of the first underground music lovers started to up the bpm and add variations in structure thus becoming Tekno. Techno in the UK in the early 90’s was based on a bpm of 130-140. By the 00’s music on its never ending journey of progression had gained more speed and Hardtek was starting to dominate UK raves especially in the South and London.. Even Trance had progressed from sweeping delicate melody’s to whats now known as Hardtrance a faster, harder more bouncy music to its predecessor. Music all over the underground was getting harder and faster. In today’s world the most recent and noticeable evaluation in music is the progression of DnB into Neuro Funk, very similar to DnB but with grittier and harsher bass and synth sounds often using masses of compression to get those tearing bass line which is now worlds apart from one of the original DnB genres pioneered by Carl Cox Jungletechno.

'''Raggatek''' is predominantly influenced by Reggae and Ragga music, incorporating Jungle, DnB, Dancehall, Reggae, Ragga and Techno music. Well known MC’s such as YT and Top Cat are a massive influence on the world of Raggatek. Producers loving this type of sound wanted to bring it to the dance floors of the underground. Upping the bpm to between 180 – 200 adding amen breaks and the basic structure of Hardtek that kick bass kick bass format was the formula for a  new hybrid music. The big sounding Ragga style vocals are often a massive presence on Raggatek productions.

'''Jungletek''' works on exactly the same formula as Raggatek just replace the Ragga with Jungle &amp; DnB. Being less known for the vocal arrangements and more about the bass lines. Jungletek takes the basics of the bass line from well known Jungle and DnB tracks and recreates them in a Hardtek format. Original productions also use the simple format of kick bass with amen breaks. European Raggatek and Jungletek is often recognisable by the high energy eletro sounds in the bass lines and synth melody’s.

[[File:Fur bearing trout. Very rare. (3793949065).jpg|thumb|A mounted "fur-bearing trout" like the one once displayed in the [[National Museum of Scotland]]]]
The '''fur-bearing trout''' (or '''furry trout''') is a [[legendary creature|fictional creature]] purportedly found in [[North America]] and [[Iceland]].  According to tales, the [[trout]] has created a thick coat of [[fur]] to maintain its body heat. Tales of furry fish date to the 17th-century and later the "shaggy trout" of  Iceland. The earliest known American publication dates from a 1929 ''Montana Wildlife'' magazine article by J.H. Hicken. A [[taxidermy]] furry trout produced by Ross C. Jobe is a specimen at the [[Royal Museum of Scotland]]; it is a trout with white rabbit fur "ingeniously" attached.

There are no real examples of any fur-bearing trout species, but two examples of hair-like growths on fish are known. The "cotton mold", ''[[Saprolegnia]]'', can infect fish, which can result in the appearance of fish covered in the white "fur".  A real fish, ''[[Mirapinna esau]]'', also known as the "Hairy Fish", has hair-like outgrowths and wings.

== Commonalities ==
Fur-bearing trout are [[legendary creature|fictional creatures]] that are purportedly found in [[Arkansas]], northern [[North America]], and [[Iceland]].&lt;ref name="moh" /&gt; The basic claim (or [[tall tale]]) is that the waters of lakes and rivers in the area are so cold that they [[evolved]] a thick coat of [[fur]] to maintain their body heat.&lt;ref name="moh" /&gt; Another theory says that it is due to four jugs - or two bottles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanfolklore.net/folklore/2010/08/furbearing_trout.html|title=Fur-Bearing Trout: From Tall tales at Americanfolklore.net|publisher=American Folklore|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; - of [[hair tonic]] being spilled into the [[Arkansas River]].&lt;ref name="moh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/photos/furtrout.html|title=The Fur-Bearing Trout|publisher=The Museum of Hoaxes|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins vary, but one of the earlier claims date to a 17th-century Scottish immigrant's letter to his relatives referring to "furried animals and fish" being plentiful in the New World. It was followed by a request to procure a specimen of these "furried fish" and one was sent home.&lt;ref name="moh" /&gt; A publication in 1900 recounts the Icelandic Lodsilungur, another haired trout, as being a common folklore.&lt;ref name=type /&gt; The earliest known American publication dates from a 1929 ''Montana Wildlife'' magazine article by J.H. Hicken.&lt;ref name="fmca" /&gt;

The "cotton mold" ''[[Saprolegnia]]'' will sometimes infect fish, causing tufts of fur-like growth to appear on the body. A heavy infection will result in the death of the fish, and as the fungus continues to grow afterwards, dead fish that are largely covered in the white "fur" can occasionally be found washed ashore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tdsfb.org/fungus.htm | title=Fish Fungus Saprolegnia &amp; Ulcerative Dermal Necrosis (UDN) | publisher=Tay District Salmon Fisheries Board | accessdate=1 May 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502033447/http://www.tdsfb.org/fungus.htm | archivedate=May 2, 2014 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A real fish, ''[[Mirapinna esau]]'' known as the "Hairy Fish", has hair-like outgrowths and wings. It was discovered in the [[Azores]] in 1956.&lt;ref name=type /&gt;

== Icelandic Lodsilungur ==
According to Icelandic legend, the Lodsilungur (''{{illm|Loðsilungur|is}}'') is a furry trout that is the creation of demons and giants. The Lodsilungur are described as inedible fish that overwhelm rivers and are a form of punishment for human wickedness.&lt;ref name=type&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=QNFR4xHHIegC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Beasts+that+Hide+from+Man:+Seeking+the+World%27s+Last+Undiscovered+Animals#v=snippet&amp;q=trout&amp;f=false | title=The Beasts That Hide from Man: Seeking the World's Last Undiscovered Animals | publisher=Cosimo, Inc. | author=Shuker, Karl | year=2003 | pages=130–131 | isbn=978-1-931044-64-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, ''The Scottish Review'' featured an account of the Lodsilungur as a poisonous "Shaggy trout" of northern Iceland.

== United States furry trout ==
An account of a furry trout appeared in 1929 in ''Montana Wildlife'' magazine and was first noted by J.H. Hicken. Hicken's account states that when the fish is caught "the change of temperature from this water to atmosphere is so great that the fish explodes upon being taken from the water, and fur and skin come off in one perfect piece, making it available for commercial purposes, and leaving the body of the fish for refrigerator purposes or eating, as desired."&lt;ref name="fmca"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fmca.com/conventions/past-conventions/gillette-2013/3649-roaming-wyoming-furry-fish-are-cool-very-cool?tmpl=component&amp;print=1&amp;page= | title=Roaming Wyoming: Furry fish are cool.

[[My Ten Years in a Quandary, and How They Grew]], A 1936 bestselling book by [[Robert Benchley]], contains the humorous essay "Bad News" about a report of fur-bearing trout used as a [[goiter]] cure &lt;ref name="guta"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks07/0700431h.html | title=My Ten Years in a Quandary AND HOW THEY GREW | author = Benchley, Robert | publisher=gutenberg.net.au | accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another fur-bearing trout story originated with Wilbur Foshay, secretary of the Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref name=ch /&gt;&lt;ref name=fbt1&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.furbearingtrout.com/cheiftan.html | title=Furry Fin Flappers and Pelted Piscatorial Prizes Puebloan Cheiftan, November 1938 | publisher=Furbearingtrout.com | accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foshay promoted the story so convincingly that it was picked up by the ''Salida Record'' newspaper.&lt;ref name="ch"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chieftain.com/news/region/upperark/2457868-120/fur-trout-salida-bearing | title=Fur-bearing trout | publisher=Chieftain.com | date=April 11, 2014 | accessdate=May 1, 2014 | author=Harmon, Tracy}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to its Foshay, the trout grew fur due to the cold temperatures of the [[Arkansas River]] and shed the fur as the water temperatures warmed in the summer.&lt;ref name=ch /&gt; In November 1938, a story in the ''Puebloan Cheiftan'' recounted the hairy trout history and stated that "[o]ld-timers living along the Arkansas River near Salida have told tales for many years of the fur-bearing trout indigenous to the waters of the Arkansas near there."&lt;ref name=fbt1 /&gt; In 2014, ''[[Mysteries at the Museum]]'' visited the Salida Museum and {{As of|2014|05||lc=y}} is expected to be part of a segment in late 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.themountainmail.com/free_content/article_15bacc52-844d-11e3-9f0e-001a4bcf6878.html | title=Film crew visits Salida Museum | publisher=The Mountain Mail | date=January 23, 2014 | accessdate=May 1, 2014 | author=Shovald, Arlene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[tall tale]] was recounted by S.E. Schlosser, it states that hairy trout were the result of two bottles or four jugs of spilled hair tonic. To catch hairy trout, fisherman would act as barbers and lure fish from the waters with the offer of a free trim or shave.&lt;ref name="moh" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanfolklore.net/folklore/2010/08/furbearing_trout.html|title=Fur-Bearing Trout: From Tall tales at Americanfolklore.net|publisher=American Folklore|accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An intentionally fantastical story in Maine and claimed hairy trout were under [[catch and release]] policy that was enforced by wardens' carrying [[Brannock Device]]s. If a fish was caught, the warden would measure it against the fisher's foot. If the fish's length matched the fisher's foot size, the fish could be eaten and the pelt made into furry [[slippers]].&lt;ref name=odd&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.furbearingtrout.com/mythick.html | title=There's P.R.O.O.F. in Mythick Mythick county's Preservation Restoration Of Oddities Forever | publisher=Furbearingtrout.com | accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canada ==
The Canadian fur-bearing trout is another example of the furry trout hoax. According to the story, a trout with white fur was caught in [[Lake Superior]] off Gros Cap in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], [[Ontario]], [[Algoma District]], Canada, and its taxidermist was Ross C. Jobe of Sault Ste. Marie.&lt;ref name=type /&gt; The purchaser of the fish learned of the hoax after presenting it to the [[Royal Museum of Scotland]]. The white fur of a rabbit was described as being "ingeniously" attached to the fish.&lt;ref name=type /&gt; A fictional description of the Canadian "Hairy" Trout was published by Takeshi Yamada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.furbearingtrout.com/hairytrout.html | title=The Canadian "Hairy" Trout Takeshi Yamada | publisher=Furbearingtrout.com | accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kathmandu International Mountain Film Festival (KIMFF)''' has been held in [[Kathmandu]] since 2000. Starting out as a biennial festival, KIMFF turned annual and competitive in 2007. KIMFF typically takes places around 11 December to coincide with the [[Mountain Day|International Mountain Day]].

==Modes==
KIMFF uses [[Movie theater|cinema]]s, other [[visual arts|visual art forms]], workshops and discussion forums to inform and educate as wide and as large a variety of audience on particular issues within the duration of the festival. After the completion of festival in Kathmandu, a special package of films is taken to various locations within Nepal as a part of ''Travelling KIMFF''.
Extreme sports, adventure, religion, or distinct cultural practices, human beings relate with mountains in a myriad of ways. In a world whose character and landscapes are rapidly changing, our relationship with mountains is only getting broader, subtler, and more intricate. The growing diversity and complexity of this relationship is what Kathmandu International Mountain Film Festival (KIMFF) seeks to explore.

KIMFF, the only festival of its kind east of Suez, brings to Kathmandu Valley some of the most recent and exciting films about mountains, mountain environment, mountain cultures and communities from various corners of the world. KIMFF screens films produced during the last three years and features discussion forums, on-demand screenings, as well as exhibitions of books and photography celebrating mountains. The festival is organized with the conviction that human experiences in the world’s highlands, especially those in the developing countries, is worth documenting and sharing. KIMFF hopes not only to encourage a deeper understanding of the social and cultural realities of those regions but also to create a sense that the significance of those regions is often far-flung.
Organized by Himal Association, KIMFF started as a non-competitive, biennial festival in 2000. A wide selection of films – alpine documentation, archival footage, adventure cinema, experimental shorts, commentaries, anthropological narratives, feature films, etc. – have been screened in the previous four festivals. These movies have dealt with issues regarding cultural practices, lifestyles, conflict, wildlife, mountain-climbing, environment, globalization, and gender, among many others.

Over the years, the festival has attracted not only filmmakers, film enthusiasts, and critics, but also scholars, journalists, activists, and mountaineers. It is the interest of this creative and intellectual community that has sustained KIMFF and placed Kathmandu Valley on the map of international film festivals. The impetus for the festival has always been the trust of this community in the capability of the audio-visual medium in creating social and economic transformations.

==International==
KIMFF is also one of the member of [[Mountain film|International Alliance for Mountain Film]] (IAMF)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mountainfilmalliance.org/|title= International Alliance for Mountain Film}}&lt;/ref&gt;  among others like [[Banff Mountain Film Festival]], [[Trento|Trento Film Festival]], [[Autrans]] and others.

== History ==
The Les Femmes Underground International Film Festival originated in September 2016 at [[Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center]] in [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice, CA]]. It was founded the previous year, after filmmaker Edda Manriquez attended a [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media]] seminar at [[CalArts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.filminquiry.com/interview-edda-manriquez-les-femmes-undergound-international-film-festival/|title=Interview With Edda Manriquez, Director Of The Les Femmes Undergound International Film Festival {{!}} Film Inquiry|website=www.filminquiry.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the festival was held at Digital Gym Cinema in [[San Diego|San Diego, CA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/247944/2nd-annual-les-femmes-underground-international-film-fest-casts-its-spell-on-san-diego/|title=2nd Annual Les Femmes Underground International Film Fest Casts its Spell on San Diego - Dread Central|website=www.dreadcentral.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thedailyaztec.com/83895/artsandculture/les-femmes-international-film-festival-comes-to-san-diego/|title=Les Femmes International Film Festival comes to San Diego|last=Dyer|first=Danny|work=The Daily Aztec|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2018, it is set to be held at Phoenix Center for the Arts in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix, AZ]].

'''MV ''Tampa''''' is a [[roll-on/roll-off]] [[container ship]] completed in 1984 by [[Hyundai Heavy Industries|Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd.]] in South Korea for the Norway-based firm, [[Wilh. Wilhelmsen|Wilhelmsen Lines Shipowning]].

==Tampa affair==
{{main|Tampa affair}}
[[File:ABC Tampa.ogv|right|thumb|[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] news report of the ''Tampa affair'' and its political context, October 2001.]]
In August 2001, under Captain [[Arne Rinnan]], a diplomatic dispute brewed between Australia, [[Norway]], and [[Indonesia]] after ''Tampa'' rescued 438 Afghans from a distressed fishing vessel in international waters. The Afghans wanted passage to nearby [[Christmas Island]]. The [[Howard Government|Australian government]] sought to prevent this by refusing ''Tampa'' entry into Australian waters, insisting on their disembarkment elsewhere, and deploying the [[Australian Special Air Service Regiment|Special Air Service Regiment]] to board the ship.  At the time of the incident, ''Tampa'' carried cargo worth {{A$|20 million}}, and 27 crew.

The crew of ''Tampa'' received the [[Nansen Refugee Award]] for 2002 from the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) for their efforts to follow international principles of saving people in distress at sea.

==Cocaine smuggling bust==
In October 2006, MV ''Tampa'' was one of two Wilhelmsen ships involved in a [[cocaine]]-smuggling operation intercepted by the [[New Zealand Customs Service]] and the [[Australian Federal Police]]. Twenty-seven kilograms of cocaine was allegedly attached to the side of the two cargo ships bound for Australia in purpose-built metal pods, although New Zealand authorities stated they did not believe the ship's crew or owners were involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Crewdson |first=Patrick |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/tampa-one-of-two-ships-named-in-cocaine-bust/2006/10/26/1161749257097.html |title=''Tampa'' one of two ships named in cocaine bust |work=The Age |date=27 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== MythBusters test model==
In the 2006 episode [[List of MythBusters episodes#Season 4: 2006|"Whirlpool/Snowplow"]] of the TV show ''[[MythBusters]]'', a 1:550 scale model of MV ''Tampa'' was assembled, weighted with lead shot to simulate a full load of cargo, and used as a scale scientific [[test bed]] vehicle for determining whether ocean [[whirlpool]]s are capable of sinking a large container ship.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3366">The '''Navajo song ceremonial complex''' is a spiritual practice used by certain [[Navajo]] [[Medicine man|ceremonial people]] to restore and maintain balance and harmony in the lives of the people. One half of the ceremonial complex is the Blessing Way, while the other half is the Enemy Way ({{spell-nv|Anaʼí Ndááʼ}}).

==The Blessing Way==
{{about|the Navajo ceremonial complex|the novel|The Blessing Way|the episode of ''The X-Files''|The Blessing Way (The X-Files)}}
The rites and prayers in the Blessing Way are concerned with healing, creation, harmony and peace. The song cycles recount the elaborate Navajo creation story ({{spell-nv|[[Diné Bahaneʼ]]}}).

One of most important Blessing Way rites is the ''Kinaaldá'' ceremony, in which a young girl makes the transition to womanhood upon her [[menarche]].&lt;ref name="McCloskey"&gt;Joanne McCloskey, ''Living Through the Generations: Continuity And Change in Navajo Women's Lives'', University of Arizona Press, 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BsGUczNokhUC&amp;pg=PA159 pp. 159–162], {{ISBN|0-8165-2631-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of the ceremony, the girl enacts the part of Changing Woman ({{spell-nv|[[Asdzą́ą́ Nádleehé]]}}),&lt;ref name="McCloskey"/&gt; the powerful spirit woman responsible for [[fertility]] entering the world. The ''Kinaaldá'' ceremony includes the girl demonstrating endurance by ritualised running, each dawn over a period of several days, as well as a hair-combing ritual and the baking of a large corn cake.&lt;ref name="McCloskey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nash"&gt;Alice N. Nash and Christoph Strobel, ''Daily Life of Native Americans from Post-Columbian Through Nineteenth-Century America'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ghv-E7OuBlMC&amp;pg=PA152 p. 152], {{ISBN|0-3133-3515-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Enemy Way==
The Enemy Way ({{spell-nv|Anaʼí Ndááʼ}}) is a traditional ceremony for countering the harmful effects of ghosts (''{{spell-nv|[[chindi|chʼį́įdii]]}}''), and has been performed for returning military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Robert F. Murphy (ed), ''American Anthropology, 1946-1970: Papers from the American Anthropologist'', University of Nebraska Press, 2002, p. 111, {{ISBN|0-8032-8280-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Enemy Way ceremony involves song, [[sandpainting]], dance, and the powerful mythical figure [[Navajo mythology|Monster Slayer]].&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Crapanzano, ''The Fifth World of Forster Bennett: Portrait of a Navajo'', University of Nebraska Press, 2003, p. 238, {{ISBN|0-8032-6431-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony lasts for several days and includes the enacting of a battle.&lt;ref name="Laubin"&gt;Reginald Laubin and Gladys Laubin, ''Indian Dances of North America: Their Importance to Indian Life'', University of Oklahoma Press, 1989, p. 423, {{ISBN|0-8061-2172-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated with the Enemy Way is a Girl's Dance, to which young men are invited by marriageable young women.&lt;ref&gt;Clyde Kluckhohn, Dorothea Cross Leighton, Lucy H. Wales, and Richard Kluckhohn, ''The Navaho'', Harvard University Press, 1974, p. 228, {{ISBN|0-674-60603-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This derives from an aspect of the Monster Slayer myth, in which two captive girls are liberated.&lt;ref name="Laubin"/&gt;

'''Numantia'''  ('''''Numancia''''' in Spanish) was an ancient [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] settlement, whose remains are located 7&amp;nbsp;km north of the city of [[Soria]], on a hill known as Cerro de la Muela in the municipality of [[Garray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/246523 |title=Places: 246523 (Numantia) |last=Keay, S., R. Mathisen, H. Sivan |publisher=Pleiades |access-date=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numantia is famous for its role in the [[Celtiberian Wars]].
In the year 153 BC Numantia experienced its first serious conflict with Rome.
After 20 years of hostilities, in the year 133 BC the Roman Senate gave [[Scipio Aemilianus Africanus]]
the task of destroying Numantia.  He laid siege to the city, erecting a nine kilometre fence supported by towers, moats, impaling rods and so on. After 13 months of siege, the Numantians decided to burn the city before surrendering.

==Location==
The nearest settlement to the ruins of Numantia is the village of [[Garray]] in the province of [[Soria (province)|Soria]].  Garray has grown up next to a bridge across the Duero. It is only a few miles from the small city of [[Soria]], capital of the eponymous province.

==Early history of the site==
[[Image:Mapa celtiberos.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Territory of the [[Celtiberi]] tribe with the probable locations of its sub-groups]]

Numantia was an [[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]] (in Roman terminology an "[[oppidum]]"), which controlled a crossing of the river [[Duero]]. 
[[Pliny the Elder]] counts it as a city of the [[Pellendones]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Natural History |title-link=Natural History (Pliny) |author=Pliny |author-link=Pliny the Elder}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other authors, like [[Strabo]] and [[Ptolemy]] place it among the [[Arevaci]] people.  The Arevaci were a [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] tribe, formed by the mingling of Iberians and migrating Celts in the 6th century BC, who inhabited an area near Numantia and [[Uxama]].

The first serious conflict with Rome occurred in 153 BC when [[Quintus Fulvius Nobilior]] was [[Roman consul|consul]]. Numantia took in some fugitives from the city of [[Segeda]], who belonged to another Celtiberian tribe called the Belli. The leader of the Belli, Carus of Segeda, managed to defeat a Roman army. The Romans then besieged Numantia, and deployed a small number of [[war elephants]], but were unsuccessful. 

Before their defeat in 133 BC, the Numantians gained a number of victories.  For example, in 137 BC, 20,000 Romans surrendered to the Celtiberians of Numantia (population between 4,000-8,000). The young Roman officer [[Tiberius Gracchus]], as quaestor, saved the Roman army from destruction by signing a peace treaty with the Numantines, an action generally reserved for a [[Legatus|Legate]].

==Final siege of Numantia==
{{main|Siege of Numantia}}
The final siege of Numantia began in the year 134 BC. Scipio Aemilianus, who was a Roman [[consul]] at that time, was in command of an army of 30,000 soldiers. His troops constructed a number of fortifications surrounding the city as they prepared for a long siege. Resistance was hopeless but the Numantians refused to surrender and famine quickly spread through the city. After eight months most of the inhabitants decided to commit suicide rather than become slaves. Only a few hundred of the inhabitants, exhausted and famished, surrendered to the victorious Roman legions.
===Numantian defence===
The Spanish expression ''Defensa numantina'' may be used to indicate any [[despair (emotion)|desperate]], suicidal last ditch stand against [[Invasion|invading forces]].

==Later history==
[[Image:REmpire-03 Hispania Tarraconensis.png|220px|left|thumb|Numantia was incorporated into the Roman [[Imperial province]] of ''Hispania Tarraconensis'' (pictured in red), AD 120.]]
After the destruction, there are remains of occupation in the 1st century BC, with a regular street plan but without great public buildings.

Its decay starts in the 3rd century, but with Roman remains still from the 4th century.
Later remains from the 6th century hint of a [[Visigothic Spain|Visigoth]] occupation.

==Excavation and conservation of Numantia==
Numantia's exact location vanished from memory, and some theories placed it in [[Zamora (province)|Zamora]], but in 1860 [[Eduardo Saavedra]] identified the correct location in [[Garray]], Soria. In 1882 the ruins of Numantia were declared a [[National Monument (Spain)|national monument]].
In 1905 the German archaeologist [[Adolf Schulten]] began a series of excavations which located the Roman camps around the city. In 1999 the Roman camps were included in a ''zona arqueológica'', a category of the Spanish heritage register which did not exist when the hillfort was first protected.&lt;ref&gt;''Monumento'' and ''zona arqueológica'' are both types of [[Bien de Interés Cultural]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Regular excavations are still going on.

=== Displays related to Numantia ===

Many objects from the site are on display in the [[Numantine Museum of Soria]] (Spanish: ''Museo Numantino''). This museum is also responsible for ''[[in situ]]'' displays at Numantia.
[[File:Museo Numantino - Jarra trilobulada.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Jar with three spouts (1st century B.C.) in the ''Museo Numantino'']]
Other collections which have items from the site include the [[Romano-Germanic Central Museum (Mainz)|Romano-Germanic Central Museum]], Mainz.
(Some objects were taken by Adolf Schulten to Germany).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.es/plan-b/visitar/abci-numancia-inedita-adolf-schulten-museo-arqueologico-regional-madrid-201704252103_noticia.html |title=La Numancia inédita de Adolf Schulten |last=Delgado |first=Adrián |newspaper=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] |publication-date=25 April 2017 |language=es |access-date=11 November 2018 |location=Madrid |publisher=[[Vocento]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development threat to the historic landscape ===
The province of Soria is sparsely populated, and Numantia is mainly surrounded by land used for low intensity agriculture. However, the regional government of [[Castilla y Leon]] and the city of Soria have planned various construction projects which if completed would affect the landscape surrounding the site of Numantia.
[[Image:Esquina en Numancia.jpg|220px|thumb|left|A street corner in the ruins of Numantia.]]
The proposed developments in the vicinity of Numantia have met widespread opposition from a number of quarters, including the Instituto de España, the [[Real Academia de la Historia]], the Catalan Institute of Classical Archaeology, the Spanish Section of the International Council on Monuments and Sites ([[ICOMOS]]) and a number of Ancient History Departments in Spain. In 2008 a petition organised to have Numantia declared a [[World Heritage Site]], in the hope that this would deter the local authorities from developing the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=es |url=http://www.salvemosnumancia.org/firmas.htm |title=Firmas para que Numancia sea declarado PATRIMONIO DE LA HUMANIDAD |work=Salvemos Numancia |access-date=11 November 2018 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080609033529/http://www.salvemosnumancia.org:80/firmas.htm |archive-date=9 January 2008 |year=2008 |publisher=Akham Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== City of the Environment ====
In 2010 work began on a "City of the Environment" on an ecologically important site near the river Duero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eldiario.es/politica/Junta-Castilla-Ciudad-Medio-Ambiente_0_600190742.html |title=La Junta de Castilla y León gastó 93 millones en la ilegalizada Ciudad del Medio Ambiente y quiere invertir 20 más |first=Laura |last=Cornejo |date=10 January 2017 |access-date=11 November 2018 |newspaper=[[El Diario (Spain)|El Diario]] |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2014/08/31/540238afca47419b1b8b4579.html |title=Una burbuja de hormigón de 52 millones en plena Soria |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |first=Pedro |last=Simón |date=31 August 2014 |access-date=11 November 2018 |publisher=[[Unidad Editorial Información General]] S.L.U.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Industrial Estate ====
The most damaging proposal from a visual point of view is the plan to develop a new industrial zone (''Polígono Industrial de Soria II'').  This industrial estate has been planned for El Cabezo, which is adjacent to Numantia and the Roman encampment (and would also affect part of the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] site of [[Monastery of San Juan de Duero|Los Arcos de San Juan de Duero]]). There has been a legal appeal by the aristocratic Marichalar family against the expropriation of its land for this development.

==Symbolism==
The siege of Numantia was recorded by several Roman historians who admired the sense of freedom of the ancient Iberians and acknowledged their fighting skills against the Roman legions.
In [[Spanish mythology|Spanish culture]], it has a meaning similar to that of [[Masada]] for Israelis.
[[Miguel de Cervantes]] (author of ''[[Don Quijote]]'') wrote a play about the siege, ''[[The Siege of Numantia|El cerco de Numancia]]'', which stands today as his best-known dramatic work.
[[Antonio Machado]] references the city in his poetry book ''Campos de Castilla''.  The poem is an ode to the countryside and peoples of rural [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]].
More recently, [[Carlos Fuentes]] wrote a short story about the event, "The Two Numantias", in his collection ''The Orange Tree''.

Several Spanish Navy ships have been named [[Numancia (disambiguation)|Numancia]] and a Sorian battalion was named ''batallón de numantinos''. During the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Nationalist Numancia regiment took the town of [[Azaña]] in Toledo.
To erase the memory of the Republican president [[Manuel Azaña]], they renamed it [[Numancia de la Sagra]].

The [[Soria]]n football team is called [[CD Numancia]].

The expression "numantine resistance" is occasionally used to refer to particularly obdurate resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |language=es |url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?TIPO_HTML=2&amp;TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=numantino |title=Numantino |dictionary=[[Diccionario de la Real Academia Española]] |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070324211732/http://buscon.rae.es:80/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?TIPO_HTML=2&amp;TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=numantino |archive-date=24 March 2017 |edition=22nd |publisher=[[Real Academia Española]] |access-date=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nuremberg trials''' ({{lang-de|Die Nürnberger Prozesse}}) were a series of [[military tribunal]]s held by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] under [[international law]] and the [[laws of war]] after [[World War II]]. The trials were most notable for the prosecution of prominent members of the political, military, judicial and economic leadership of [[Nazi Germany]], who planned, carried out, or otherwise participated in [[the Holocaust]] and other [[war crimes]]. The trials were held in the city of [[Nuremberg]], Germany, and their decisions marked a turning point between classical and contemporary international law.

The first and best known of these trials was that of the major war criminals before the International Military Tribunal (IMT). It was described as "the greatest trial in history" by [[Norman Birkett, 1st Baron Birkett|Norman Birkett]], one of the British judges who presided over them.{{sfn|Marrus|1997|p=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/41212687 563]}} Held between 20 November 1945 and 1 October 1946,{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5h_8dxXEIPsC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=%22november+20+1945%22+%22october+1+1946%22 106]}} the Tribunal was given the task of trying 24 of the most important political and military leaders of the Third Reich – though the proceeding against [[Martin Bormann]] was [[trial in absentia|tried ''in absentia'']], while another defendant, [[Robert Ley]], committed suicide within a week of the trial's commencement.

[[Adolf Hitler]], [[Heinrich Himmler]], [[Wilhelm Burgdorf]], [[Hans Krebs (Wehrmacht general)|Hans Krebs]] and [[Joseph Goebbels]] had all committed suicide in the spring of 1945 to avoid capture, though Himmler was captured before his suicide. Krebs and Burgdorf committed suicide two days after [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] in the [[Führerbunker|same place]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFCooper2011|Cooper 2011]], p. 38. "On October 6, in Berlin, the Chief Prosecutors signed the momentous Indictment setting forth the charges&amp;nbsp;... against Hermann Göring and his associates and the six organizations, named as criminal, to which they belonged."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reinhard Heydrich]] had been [[Operation Anthropoid|assassinated by Czech partisans in 1942]]. [[Josef Terboven]] killed himself with dynamite in Norway in 1945. [[Adolf Eichmann]] fled to [[Argentina]] to avoid Allied capture, but was apprehended by Israel's intelligence service ([[Mossad]]) and hanged in 1962. [[Hermann Göring]] was sentenced to death, but committed suicide by consuming cyanide the night before his execution in defiance of his captors. [[Miklós Horthy]] appeared as a witness at the [[Ministries trial]] held in Nuremberg in 1948.

This article primarily deals with the first trial, which was conducted by the IMT. Further trials of lesser war criminals were conducted under Control Council Law No. 10 at the U.S. [[Subsequent Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg Military Tribunal (NMT)]], which included the [[Doctors' trial]] and the [[Judges' Trial]].

The categorization of the crimes and the constitution of the court represented a juridical advance that would be used afterwards by the [[United Nations]] for the development of a specific international jurisprudence in matters of [[war crime]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war of aggression]], as well as for the creation of the [[International Criminal Court]].
The Nuremberg indictment also mentions genocide for the first time in international law (Count three, war crimes : "the extermination of racial and national groups, against the civilian populations of certain occupied territories in order to destroy particular races and classes of people and national, racial, or religious groups, particularly Jews, Poles, and Gypsies and others.")

A&amp;nbsp;precedent for trying those accused of [[war crime]]s had been set at the end of [[World War I]] in the [[Leipzig War Crimes Trials]] held in May to July 1921 before the ''[[Reichsgericht]]'' (German Supreme Court) in [[Leipzig]], although these had been on a very limited scale and largely regarded as ineffectual. At the beginning of 1940, the Polish government-in-exile asked the British and French governments to condemn the German invasion of their country. The British initially declined to do so; however, in April 1940, a joint declaration was issued by the British, French and Polish. Relatively bland because of Anglo-French reservations, it proclaimed the trio's ''"desire to make a formal and public protest to the conscience of the world against the action of the German government whom they must hold responsible for these crimes which cannot remain unpunished."''{{sfn|Kochavi|1998|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QGi1kxDF-30C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=%22beginning+of+1940%22 7–8]}}

Three-and-a-half years later, the stated intention to punish the Germans was much more trenchant. On 1 November 1943, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States published their [[Moscow Declaration|"Declaration on German Atrocities in Occupied Europe"]], which gave a "full warning" that, when the Nazis were defeated, the Allies would "pursue them to the uttermost ends of the earth&amp;nbsp;... in order that justice may be done.&amp;nbsp;... The above declaration is without prejudice to the case of the major war criminals whose offences have no particular geographical location and who will be punished by a joint decision of the Government of the Allies."&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFHeller2011|Heller 2011]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=8ALHAwFfy44C&amp;pg=PA9 page 9]. According to [[#CITEREFMarrus1997|Marrus 1997]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41212687 page 563], Roosevelt had already written to Rabbi Stephen Wise, president of the American Jewish Congress, in July 1942, saying: "The American people not only sympathise with all victims of Nazi crimes, but will hold the perpetrators of these crimes to strict accountability in a day of reckoning which will surely come."&lt;/ref&gt; This intention by the Allies to dispense justice was reiterated at the [[Yalta Conference]] and at [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]] in 1945.{{sfn|Wright|1946|p=74}}

British [[War Cabinet]] documents, released on 2 January 2006, showed that as early as December 1944 the Cabinet had discussed their policy for the punishment of the leading Nazis if captured. The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], had then advocated a policy of [[summary execution]] in some circumstances, with the use of an [[Act of Attainder]] to circumvent legal obstacles, being dissuaded from this only by talks with US and Soviet leaders later in the war.&lt;ref name="AD042113"&gt;{{cite news |title = Shooting top Nazis?

In late 1943, during the Tripartite Dinner Meeting at the [[Tehran Conference]], the Soviet leader, [[Joseph Stalin]], proposed executing 50,000–100,000 German staff officers. [[US President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] joked that perhaps 49,000 would do. Churchill, believing them to be serious, denounced the idea of "the cold blooded execution of soldiers who fought for their country" and that he would rather be "taken out in the courtyard and shot" himself than partake in any such action.{{sfn|Senarclens|1988|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sbAo3RkWIUsC&amp;pg=PA19 pp. 19–20]}} However, he also stated that war criminals must pay for their crimes and that, in accordance with the [[Moscow Declaration#Statement on Atrocities|Moscow Document]] which he himself had written, they should be tried at the places where the crimes were committed. Churchill was vigorously opposed to executions "for political purposes."&lt;ref name="Churchill: execute Hitler without trial"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Crossland|first=John|title=Churchill: execute Hitler without trial|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article784041.ece|accessdate=23 November 2011|newspaper=The Sunday Times|date=1 January 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311090356/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article784041.ece|archivedate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="teachingamericanhistory"&gt;[http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=906 Tehran Conference: Tripartite Dinner Meeting] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629163430/http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=906 |date=2006-06-29 }}, 29 November 1943, Soviet Embassy, 8:30 PM&lt;/ref&gt; According to the minutes of a meeting between Roosevelt and Stalin at Yalta, on 4 February 1945, at the [[Livadia Palace]], President Roosevelt "said that he had been very much struck by the extent of German destruction in [[Crimea]] and therefore he was more bloodthirsty in regard to the Germans than he had been a year ago, and he hoped that Marshal Stalin would again propose a toast to the execution of 50,000 officers of the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]]."&lt;ref name="wisc"&gt;[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=goto&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=571 United States Department of State] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430143041/http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=goto&amp;id=FRUS.FRUS1945&amp;isize=M&amp;submit=Go+to+page&amp;page=571 |date=2011-04-30 }} Foreign relations of the United States.

Later, details were leaked generating widespread condemnation by the nation's newspapers{{clarify |reason=Which nation? |date=November 2017}}. Roosevelt, aware of strong public disapproval, abandoned the plan, but did not adopt an alternative position on the matter. The demise of the Morgenthau Plan created the need for an alternative method of dealing with the Nazi leadership. The plan for the "Trial of European War Criminals" was drafted by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry L. Stimson]] and the [[United States Department of War|War Department]]. Following Roosevelt's death in April 1945, the new president, [[Harry S. Truman]], gave strong approval for a judicial process. After a series of negotiations between Britain, the US, Soviet Union and France, details of the trial were worked out. The trials were to commence on 20 November 1945, in the [[Bavaria]]n city of Nuremberg.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==Creation of the courts==
On 20 April 1942, representatives from the nine countries occupied by Germany met in London to draft the "Inter-Allied Resolution on German War Crimes". At the meetings in [[Tehran Conference|Tehran]] (1943), [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]] (1945) and [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]] (1945), the three major wartime powers, the United Kingdom, United States, and the Soviet Union, agreed on the format of punishment for those responsible for war crimes during World War II. France was also awarded a place on the tribunal. The legal basis for the trial was established by the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal|London Charter]], which was agreed upon by the four so-called Great Powers on 8 August 1945, {{sfn|Lawrence|1947|p=[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3018884 151]}} and which restricted the trial to "punishment of the major war criminals of the European Axis countries"

Some 200 German war crimes defendants were tried at Nuremberg, and 1,600 others were tried under the traditional channels of military justice. The legal basis for the jurisdiction of the court was that defined by the [[German Instrument of Surrender, 1945|Instrument of Surrender of Germany]]. Political authority for Germany had been transferred to the [[Allied Control Council]] which, having sovereign power over Germany, could choose to punish violations of [[international law]] and the [[laws of war]]. Because the court was limited to violations of the laws of war, it did not have jurisdiction over crimes that took place before the outbreak of war on 1 September 1939.

===Location===
[[File:Ostbau Justizpalast Nürnberg.jpg|thumb|The courthouse in Nuremberg, where the trials took place]]
[[Leipzig]] and [[Luxembourg]] were briefly considered as the location for the trial.{{sfn|Overy|2001|pp=19–20}} The Soviet Union had wanted the trials to take place in Berlin, as the capital city of the 'fascist conspirators',{{sfn|Overy|2001|pp=19–20}} but Nuremberg was chosen as the site for two reasons, with the first one having been the decisive factor:&lt;ref name="Catalogue1"/&gt;
# The [[Palace of Justice (Nuremberg)|Palace of Justice]] was spacious and largely undamaged (one of the few buildings that had remained largely intact through extensive Allied bombing of Germany), and a large prison was also part of the complex.
# Nuremberg was considered the ceremonial birthplace of the [[Nazi Party]]. It had hosted the Party's annual [[Nuremberg rallies|propaganda rallies]]{{sfn|Overy|2001|pp=19–20}} and the [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]] session that passed the [[Nuremberg Laws]].&lt;ref name="Catalogue1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Henkel (ed.)|first=Matthias|title=Memoriam Nuernberger Prozesse, exhibition catalogue (German)|publisher=Museen der Stadt Nuernberg|location=Nuremberg|year=2011}}, 32 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it was considered a fitting place to mark the Party's symbolic demise.

As a compromise with the Soviets, it was agreed that while the location of the trial would be Nuremberg, Berlin would be the official home of the Tribunal authorities.&lt;ref name="heydecker-leeb"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Der Nürnberger Prozeß|last1=Heydecker|first1=Joe J.|last2=Leeb|first2=Johannes|publisher=Kiepenheuer und Witsch|location=[[Köln]]|language=German|year=1979|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRO-LCO-2/2980-1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Minutes of 2nd meeting of BWCE and the Representatives of the USA|publisher=[[Lord Chancellor's Office]], [[Public Record Office]]|location=[[Kew]], [[London]]|date=21 June 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRO-LCO-2/2980-2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rough Notes Meeting with Russians|publisher=[[Lord Chancellor's Office]], [[Public Record Office]]|location=[[Kew]], [[London]]|date=29 June 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also agreed that France would become the permanent seat of the IMT{{sfn|Overy|2001|p=15}} and that the first trial (several were planned) would take place in Nuremberg.&lt;ref name="heydecker-leeb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PRO-LCO-2/2980-2"/&gt;

Most of the accused had previously been detained at [[Camp Ashcan]], a processing station and interrogation center in Luxembourg, and were moved to Nuremberg for the trial.

===Participants===
Each of the four countries provided one judge and an alternative, as well as a prosecutor.

===Intelligence tests and psychiatric assessments===
The [[Rorschach test]] was administered to the defendants, along with the [[Thematic Apperception Test]] and a German adaptation of the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence Test]].{{sfn|Brunner|2001|p=234}} All were above average intelligence, several considerably so.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFGilbert1995|Gilbert 1995]], pp.&amp;nbsp;30–1. Gilbert does not provide Ley's IQ, presumably because Ley committed suicide before the tests were done, though Gilbert is not explicit on this point. [[#CITEREFSereny1995|Sereny 1995]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=_Z3gKDdRgL8C&amp;pg=PA573 p. 573], records that Speer regarded the tests as "idiotic", and so responded to them, and to the Rorschach test in particular, with "total nonsense". Coincidentally, [[#CITEREFBrunner2001|Brunner 2001]], p. 234, argues that, given the circumstances in which they were carried out, the Rorschach tests were "almost useless by present standards; one might also mention a number of other invalidating factors, such as the dated technique by which the records were generated and the use of interpreters in some of the Rorschach interviews. Moreover, in some cases no verbatim notes were taken, whereas other protocols were recorded by a psychologist who seems to have had no previous experience with the Rorschach."&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the rumor has long persisted that the bodies were taken to Dachau and burned there, they were actually incinerated in a crematorium in Munich, and the ashes scattered over the river [[Isar]].{{sfn|Overy|2001|p=205}} The French judges suggested that the military condemned (Göring, Keitel and Jodl) be shot by a [[firing squad]], as is standard for military courts-martial, but this was opposed by Biddle and the Soviet judges, who argued that the military officers had violated their military ethos and were not worthy of death by being shot, which was considered to be more dignified.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The prisoners sentenced to incarceration were transferred to [[Spandau Prison]] in 1947.

Of the 12 defendants sentenced to death by hanging, two were not hanged: [[Martin Bormann]] was convicted in absentia (he had, unknown to the Allies, died while trying to escape from Berlin in May 1945), and Hermann Göring committed suicide the night before the execution. The remaining 10 defendants sentenced to death were hanged.

===Nuremberg principles===
The definition of what constitutes a war crime is described by the [[Nuremberg principles]], a set of guidelines document which was created as a result of the trial. The medical experiments conducted by German doctors and prosecuted in the so-called [[Doctors' Trial]] led to the creation of the [[Nuremberg Code]] to control future trials involving human subjects, a set of research ethics principles for human experimentation.

Of the indicted organizations the following were found not to be criminal:
* ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Reichsregierung|de}}''
* ''"The General Staff and High Command" was found not to comprise a group or organization as defined by Article 9 of the [[London Charter]]''
* ''[[Sturmabteilung]]''

==Subsidiary and related trials==
The American authorities conducted [[subsequent Nuremberg Trials]] in their occupied zone.

Other trials conducted after the first Nuremberg trial include the following:
* [[Auschwitz trial]]
* [[Belsen trial]]
* [[Belzec trial]] before the 1st [[Munich]] District Court in the mid-1960s, of eight SS men of the [[Belzec extermination camp]]
* [[Chełmno trials]] of the [[Chełmno extermination camp]] personnel, held in Poland and in Germany. The cases were decided almost twenty years apart
* [[Dachau trials]]
* [[Frankfurt Auschwitz trials]]
* [[Majdanek trials]], the longest Nazi war crimes trial in history, spanning over 30 years
* [[Mauthausen-Gusen camp trials]]
* [[Hamburg Ravensbrück trials]]
* [[Sobibór trial]] held in [[Hagen]], Germany, in 1965 against the SS men of the [[Sobibor extermination camp]]
* [[Treblinka trials]] in Düsseldorf, Germany

==American role in the trial==
[[File:Jackson Nuremberg color.jpg|thumb|Chief American prosecutor Robert H. Jackson addresses the Nuremberg court. 20 November 1945.]]
While Sir Geoffrey Lawrence of Britain was the judge chosen as president of the court, the most prominent of the judges at trial arguably was his American counterpart, Francis Biddle.{{sfn|Persico|2000|p=111}} Prior to the trial, Biddle had been Attorney General of the United States but had been asked to resign by Truman earlier in 1945.{{sfn|Persico|2000|p=62}}

Some accounts argue that Truman had appointed Biddle as the main American judge for the trial as an apology for asking for his resignation.{{sfn|Persico|2000|p=62}} Ironically, Biddle was known during his time as Attorney General for opposing the idea of prosecuting Nazi leaders for crimes committed before the beginning of the war, even sending out a memorandum on 5 January 1945 on the subject.{{sfn|Smith|1977|p=33}} The note also expressed Biddle's opinion that instead of proceeding with the original plan for prosecuting entire organizations, there should simply be more trials that would prosecute specific offenders.{{sfn|Smith|1977|p=33}}

Biddle soon changed his mind, as he approved a modified version of the plan on 21 January 1945, likely due to time constraints, since the trial would be one of the main issues discussed at Yalta.{{sfn|Smith|1977|p=34}} At trial, the Nuremberg tribunal ruled that any member of an organization convicted of war crimes, such as the SS or Gestapo, who had joined after 1939 would be considered a war criminal.{{sfn|Persico|2000|p=396}} Biddle managed to convince the other judges to make an exemption for any member who was drafted or had no knowledge of the crimes being committed by these organizations.{{sfn|Persico|2000|p=62}}

Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] played an important role in not only the trial itself, but also in the creation of the International Military Tribunal, as he led the American delegation to London that, in the summer of 1945, argued in favour of prosecuting the Nazi leadership as a criminal conspiracy.{{sfn|Neave|1978|p=24}} According to [[Airey Neave#Wartime service|Airey Neave]], Jackson was also the one behind the prosecution's decision to include membership in any of the six criminal organizations in the indictments at the trial, though the IMT rejected this on the grounds that it was wholly without precedent in either international law or the domestic laws of any of the Allies.{{sfn|Neave|1978|pp=339–40}} Jackson also attempted to have Alfried Krupp be tried in place of his father, Gustav, and even suggested that Alfried volunteer to be tried in his father's place.{{sfn|Neave|1978|p=297}} Both proposals were rejected by the IMT, particularly by Lawrence and Biddle, and some sources indicate that this resulted in Jackson being viewed unfavourably by the latter.{{sfn|Neave|1978|p=297}}

Thomas Dodd was a prosecutor for the United States. There was an immense amount of evidence backing the prosecutors' case, especially since meticulous records of the Nazis' actions had been kept. There were records taken in by the prosecutors that had signatures from specific Nazis signing for everything from stationery supplies to [[Zyklon B gas]], which was used to kill the inmates of the deathcamps. Thomas Dodd showed a series of pictures to the courtroom after reading through the documents of crimes committed by the defendants. The showing consisted of pictures displaying the atrocities performed by the defendants. The pictures had been gathered when the inmates were liberated from the concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;Roland, Paul. The Nuremberg Trials. London: Arcturus Publishing Limited, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:S95CrucifixCourtroomNuremberg.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Courtroom 600 in June 2016 showing contemporary configuration]]

The Tribunal is celebrated for establishing that "[c]rimes against international law are committed by men, not by abstract entities, and only by punishing individuals who commit such crimes can the provisions of international law be enforced."{{sfn|Heller|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ALHAwFfy44C&amp;pg=PA3 3]}} The creation of the IMT was followed by trials of lesser Nazi officials and the trials of Nazi doctors, who performed experiments on people in prison camps. It served as the model for the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] which tried Japanese officials for crimes against peace and against humanity. It also served as the model{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} for the [[Eichmann trial]] and for present-day courts at The Hague, for trying crimes committed during the Balkan wars of the early 1990s, and at Arusha, for trying the people responsible for the [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]] in Rwanda.

The Nuremberg trials had a great influence on the development of [[international criminal law]]. The Conclusions of the Nuremberg trials served as models for:
* [[The Genocide Convention]], 1948.
* The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], 1948.
* The [[Nuremberg Principles]], 1950.
* [[The Convention on the Abolition of the Statute of Limitations on War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity]], 1968.
* The [[Geneva Convention]] on the Laws and Customs of War, 1949; its supplementary protocols, 1977.

The [[International Law Commission]], acting on the request of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], produced in 1950 the report ''Principles of International Law Recognized in the Charter of the Nürnberg Tribunal and in the Judgement of the Tribunal'' (Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1950, vol. II&lt;ref name="Yearbook 1950"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legal.un.org/ilc/publications/yearbooks/1950.htm |title=Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1950 |publisher=legal.un.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016203552/http://legal.un.org/ilc/publications/yearbooks/1950.htm |archivedate=2014-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;). See [[Nuremberg Principles]].

The influence of the tribunal can also be seen in the proposals for a permanent international criminal court, and the drafting of international criminal codes, later prepared by the International Law Commission.

===Establishment of a permanent International Criminal Court===
The Nuremberg trials initiated a movement for the prompt establishment of a permanent international criminal court, eventually leading over fifty years later to the adoption of the Statute of the [[International Criminal Court]]. This movement was brought about because during the trials, there were conflicting court methods between the German court system and the U.S. court system. The crime of conspiracy was unheard of in the civil law systems of the Continent. Therefore, the German defense found it unfair to charge the defendants with conspiracy to commit crimes, while the judges from common-law countries were used to doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ehrenfreund | first = Norbert | title = The Nuremberg Legacy | place = New York | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year = 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed | date = February 2017 }}

Critics of the Nuremberg trials argued that the charges against the defendants were only defined as "crimes" after they were committed and that therefore the trial was invalid, and thus seen as a form of "[[victor's justice]]".{{sfn |Zolo|2009}}&lt;ref name="lecturesarchive"&gt;''See, e.g.,'' statement of Professor Nicholls of St. Antony's College, Oxford, that "[t]he Nuremberg trials have not had a very good press.

[[Quincy Wright]], writing eighteen months after the conclusion of the IMT, explained the opposition to the Tribunal thus:{{Quotation|The assumptions underlying the Charter of the United Nations, the Statute of the International Court of Justice, and the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal are far removed from the positivistic assumptions which greatly influenced the thought of international jurists in the nineteenth century. Consequently, the activities of those institutions have frequently been vigorously criticized by positivistic jurists&amp;nbsp;... [who] have asked: How can principles enunciated by the Nuremberg Tribunal, to take it as an example, be of legal value until most of the states have agreed to a tribunal with jurisdiction to enforce those principles? How could the Nuremberg Tribunal have obtained jurisdiction to find Germany guilty of aggression, when Germany had not consented to the Tribunal? How could the law, first explicitly accepted in the Nuremberg Charter of 1945, have bound the defendants in the trial when they committed the acts for which they were indicted years earlier?{{sfn|Wright|1948|pp=405–7}}

Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court [[Harlan Fiske Stone]] called the Nuremberg trials a fraud.{{sfn|Mason|1968|p=716}} "(Chief U.S. prosecutor) [[Robert H.

Associate Supreme Court Justice [[William O. Douglas]] charged that the Allies were guilty of "substituting power for principle" at Nuremberg.

A number of Germans who agreed with the idea of punishment for war crimes admitted trepidation concerning the trials. A contemporary German jurist said:

{{quote|
That the defendants at Nuremberg were held responsible, condemned and punished, will seem to most of us initially as a kind of historical justice. However, no one who takes the question of guilt seriously, above all no responsibly thoughtful jurist, will be content with this sensibility nor should they be allowed to be. Justice is not served when the guilty parties are punished in any old way, even if this seems appropriate with regard to their measure of guilt. Justice is only served when the guilty are punished in a way that carefully and conscientiously considers their criminal errors according to the provisions of valid law under the jurisdiction of a legally appointed judge.&lt;ref name="cambridge"&gt;'The Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial, 1963–1965: Genocide, History, and the Limits of the Law' by Devin O.

The validity of the court has been questioned on a number of grounds:
{{unordered list
| The trials were conducted under their own [[rules of evidence]]. The Charter of the International Military Tribunal permitted the use of normally inadmissible "evidence". Article 19 specified that "The Tribunal shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence&amp;nbsp;... and shall admit any evidence which it deems to have probative value". Article 21 of the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal (IMT) Charter stipulated:
{{quote|The Tribunal shall not require proof of facts of common knowledge but shall take [[judicial notice]] thereof. It shall also take judicial notice of official governmental documents and reports of the United [Allied] Nations, including acts and documents of the committees set up in the various allied countries for the investigation of war crimes, and the records and findings of military and other Tribunals of any of the United [Allied] Nations.}}
| The defendants were not allowed to appeal or affect the selection of judges.
{{unordered list|[[A. L. Goodhart]], Professor at [[Oxford University|Oxford]], opposed the view that, because the judges were appointed by the victors, the Tribunal was not impartial and could not be regarded as a court in the true sense. He wrote:{{quote|Attractive as this argument may sound in theory, it ignores the fact that it runs counter to the administration of law in every country. If it were true then no spy could be given a legal trial, because his case is always heard by judges representing the enemy country. Yet no one has ever argued that in such cases it was necessary to call on neutral judges. The prisoner has the right to demand that his judges shall be fair, but not that they shall be neutral.

| One of the charges, brought against Keitel, Jodl, and Ribbentrop, included conspiracy to commit aggression against Poland in 1939. The Secret Protocols of the [[German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact]] of 23 August 1939, proposed the partition of Poland between the Germans and the Soviets (which was subsequently executed in September 1939); however, Soviet leaders were not tried for being part of the same conspiracy.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;Bauer, Eddy ''The Marshall Cavendish Illustrated Encyclopedia of World War II Volume 22'' New York: Marshall Cavendish Corporation 1972 page 3071.&lt;/ref&gt;.

| In 1915, the Allied Powers, Britain, France, and Russia, jointly issued a statement explicitly charging, for the first time, another government (the [[Sublime Porte]]) of committing "a [[crime against humanity]]". However it was not until the phrase was further developed in the ''London Charter'' that it had a specific meaning. As the London Charter definition of what constituted a crime against humanity was unknown when many of the crimes were committed, it could be argued to be a retroactive law, in violation of the principles of prohibition of [[ex post facto law]]s and the general principle of penal law ''[[nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali]]''.&lt;ref group=avalon name="Motion adopted by all defense counsel group=avalon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Motion adopted by all defense counsel|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/v1-30.asp|work=The Avalon Project: Nuremberg Trial Proceedings volume 1|publisher=Lillian Goldman Law Library|accessdate=23 November 2011|date=19 November 1945|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201161457/http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/v1-30.asp|archive-date=2011-12-01|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, interviewed by [[Gitta Sereny]], researching her biography of [[Albert Speer]], Luise alleged that in many instances the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] prosecution made charges against Jodl based on documents that they refused to share with the defense. Jodl nevertheless proved some of the charges made against him were untrue, such as the charge that he helped Hitler gain control of Germany in 1933. He was in one instance aided by a [[GI (term)|GI]] clerk who chose to give Luise a document showing that the execution of a group of British commandos in [[Norway]] had been legitimate. The GI warned Luise that if she did not copy it immediately she would never see it again.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_Z3gKDdRgL8C&amp;pg=PA578 578]}}

==Introduction of extempore simultaneous interpretation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
The Nuremberg Trials employed four [[official languages]]: [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. In order to address the complex linguistic issues that clouded over the proceedings, [[Language interpretation|interpretation]] and translation departments had to be established. However, it was feared that consecutive interpretation would slow down the proceedings significantly. What is therefore unique in both the Nuremberg tribunals and history of the interpretation profession was the introduction of an entirely new technique, [[Simultaneous Interpretation|extempore simultaneous interpretation]]. This technique of interpretation requires the interpreter to listen to a speaker in a source (or passive) language and orally translate that speech into another language in real time, that is, simultaneously, through headsets and microphones. Interpreters were split into four sections, one for each official language, with three interpreters per section working from the other three languages into the fourth (their mother tongue). For instance, the English booth consisted of three interpreters, one working from German into English, one working from French, and one from Russian, etc. Defendants who did not speak any of the four official languages were provided with consecutive court interpreters. Some of the languages heard over the course of the proceedings included [[Yiddish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], and [[Polish language|Polish]].

The equipment used to establish this system was provided by [[IBM]], and included an elaborate setup of cables which were hooked up to headsets and single earphones directly from the four interpreting booths (often referred to as "the aquarium"). Four channels existed for each working language, as well as a root channel for the proceedings without interpretation. Switching of channels was controlled by a setup at each table in which the listener merely had to turn a dial in order to switch between languages. People tripping over the floor-laid cables often led to the headsets getting disconnected, with several hours at a time sometimes being taken in order to repair the problem and continue on with the trials.

Interpreters were recruited and examined by the respective countries in which the official languages were spoken: the United States, United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, Germany, [[Switzerland]], and [[Austria]], as well as in special cases [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Many were former [[translators]], army personnel, and [[linguists]], some were experienced consecutive interpreters,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/144080321|title=The origins of simultaneous interpretation : the Nuremberg Trial|last=Francesca.|first=Gaiba,|date=1998|publisher=Ottawa University Press|year=|isbn=0776604570|location=Ottawa [Ont.]|pages=40–50|oclc=144080321}}&lt;/ref&gt; others were ordinary individuals and even recent secondary school-graduates who led international lives in multilingual environments. It was, and still is believed{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}, that the qualities that made the best interpreters were not just a perfect understanding of two or more languages, but more importantly a broad sense of culture, encyclopædic knowledge, inquisitiveness, as well as a naturally calm disposition.

[[file:German War Crimes Trials. Nuernberg &amp; Dachau - NARA - 292602.jpg|thumb|Interpreting Device]]
With the simultaneous technique being extremely new, interpreters practically trained themselves, but many could not handle the pressure or the psychological strain. Many often had to be replaced, many returned to the translation department, and many left. Serious doubts were given as to whether interpretation provided a fair trial for the defendants, particularly because of fears of mistranslation and errors made on transcripts. The translation department had to also deal with the overwhelming problem of being understaffed and overburdened with an influx of documents that could not be kept up with. More often than not, interpreters were stuck in a session without having proper documents in front of them and were relied upon to do sight translation or double translation of texts, causing further problems and extensive criticism. Other problems that arose included complaints from lawyers and other legal professionals with regard to [[Interrogation|questioning]] and [[cross-examination]]. Legal professionals were most often appalled at the slower speed at which they had to conduct their task because of the extended time required for interpreters to render an interpretation properly. Also, a number of interpreters protested the idea of using vulgar language, especially if it referred to [[Jews]] or the conditions of the [[Nazi concentration camps]]. Bilingual/trilingual members who attended the trials picked up quickly on this aspect of character and were equally quick to file complaints.

Yet, despite the extensive trial and error, without the interpretation system the trials would not have been possible and in turn revolutionized the way multilingual issues were addressed in tribunals and conferences. A number of the interpreters following the trials were immediately recruited into the newly formed [[United Nations]], while others returned to their ordinary lives, pursued other careers, or worked freelance. Outside the boundaries of the trials, many interpreters continued their positions on weekends interpreting for dinners, private meetings between judges, and excursions between delegates. Others worked as investigators or editors, or aided the translation department when they could, often using it as an opportunity to sharpen their skills and to correct poor interpretations on transcripts before they were available for public record.

For further reference, a book titled ''The Origins of Simultaneous Interpretation: The Nuremberg Trial'', written by interpreter Francesca Gaiba, was published by the [[University of Ottawa Press]] in 1998.

Today, all major international organizations, as well as any conference or government that uses more than one [[official language]], uses extempore simultaneous interpretation. Notable bodies include the [[Parliament of Kosovo]] with three official languages, the [[Parliament of Canada]] with two official languages, the Parliament of South Africa with eleven official languages, the [[European Union]] with twenty-four official languages, and the [[United Nations]] with six official working languages.

'''Ozeaneum''' is a [[public aquarium]] in the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Stralsund]]. It is a main attraction of the [[German Oceanographic Museum]] (''Deutsches Meeresmuseum''), arguably one of the three largest institutions of its kind in Europe.

The Ozeaneum — located at the historical Stralsund harbour on the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast — opened its doors in July 2008. It displays primarily [[sea life]] of the [[North Sea]] and the Baltic Sea.

The Ozeaneum was expected to be a major tourist attraction, and receive 550,000 visitors per year.  It proved to be considerably more attractive than expected, and by the end of the first year had already had over 900,000 visitors.  The millionth visit occurred on 27 July 2009.

On 22 May 2010, the OZEANEUM Stralsund received the [[European Museum of the Year Award]] in a ceremony in the [[Finland|Finnish]] town of [[Tampere]].&lt;ref name="zoo_award"/&gt;

The '''Serious Fraud Investigation Office''' (SFIO) is a statutory corporate fraud investigating  agency in [[India]]. Initially, it was set up by a resolution adopted by the Government of India on 2nd July 2003 and carried out investigations within the existing legal framework under section 235 to 247 of the erstwhile Companies Act, 1956. Later, Section 211 of the Companies Act, 2013, accorded the statutory status to the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO). It is under the jurisdiction of the [[Ministry of Corporate Affairs (India)|Ministry of Corporate Affairs]], [[Government of India]]. The SFIO is involved in major fraud probes and is the co-ordinating agency with the Income Tax Department and the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sfio.nic.in/websitenew/proactive_disclosure.pdf#P1&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a multi-disciplinary organization having experts from financial sector, capital market, accountancy, forensic audit, taxation, law, information technology, company law, customs and investigation. These experts have been taken from various organizations like banks, [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]], [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India|Comptroller and Auditor General]] and concerned organizations and departments of the Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/chit-funds-sc-notices-to-centre-sebi-ed/1197050/|title=Chit funds: SC notices to Centre, SEBI, ED|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the recommendation of [[Naresh Chandra]] Committee on corporate governance (which was set up by the Government on 21 August 2002) and in the backdrop of stock market scams as also the failure of non-banking companies resulting in huge financial loss to the public, [[Vajpayee Government]] decided to setup SFIO on 9 January 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfio.nic.in/websitenew/main2.asp|title=Serious Fraud Investigation Office|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4082">'''Shaptahik 2000''' was a Bengali Language magazine that was published weekly from 1998 to 2014. The magazine was published by Mediaworld Ltd, a concern of [[Transcom Group]] of Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shaptahik 2000|url=http://www.etradelisting.com/listing/shaptahik-2000/|website=etradelisting.com|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shaptahik 2000, Anandadhara celebrate 12th anniversary|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/cache/cached-news-details-139459.html|accessdate=12 February 2018|work=archive.thedailystar.net|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Shaptahik 2000 was established in 1998. Its founding editor was [[Shahadat Chowdhury]]. The publisher of the magazine was Mahfuz Anam, the Editor of The Daily Star.&lt;ref name="DT"&gt;{{cite news|title=Shaptahik 2000 closed after 17 years|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2014/10/30/shaptahik-2000-closed-after-17-years/|accessdate=12 February 2018|work=dhakatribune.com|publisher=Dhaka Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 March 2005, Shumi Khan, the Chittagong correspondent of the magazine, received threats from [[Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh]]. This threat was issued after Shumi wrote an article that accused Shahjahan Chowdhury, a Member of Parliament from Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, of supporting terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Death threats made against at least five journalists within one week|url=https://rsf.org/en/news/death-threats-made-against-least-five-journalists-within-one-week|accessdate=12 February 2018|work=RSF|publisher=Reporters without borders|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the magazine published an autobiographical article by [[Daud Haider]], a Bangladesh writer exiled in 1973 for criticising Islam. The magazine, its editor, Golam Mortuza, and publisher, Mahfuz Anam, were sued by Mohammad Reza, an administrative officer of Al Jamia Al Islamia Islamic University over the publication of the writing by Daud Haider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shaptahik 2000 editor, publisher, writer sued|url=https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2007/09/25/shaptahik-2000-editor-publisher-writer-sued|accessdate=12 February 2018|work=bdnews24.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Case filed against Shaptahik 2000 editor, publisher, writer in Ctg|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-5529|accessdate=12 February 2018|work=The Daily Star|date=26 September 2007|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Bangladesh confiscated all copies of the issue with Daud Haider's writing the editor of the magazine issued a public apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Violence over Bangladesh cartoon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7006528.stm|accessdate=12 February 2018|date=21 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Relations|first1=House, Committee on Foreign Affairs, and Senate, Committee on Foreign|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2007|date=2008|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=9780160813993|page=2165|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5rs8UkMj64C&amp;pg=PA2165&amp;lpg=PA2165&amp;dq=Shaptahik+2000&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6C2ea4Sq9z&amp;sig=f6libeYLnhSqgDLHDU0dH3Z1h1Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9ss3Wz5_ZAhWPVt8KHSNNB-sQ6AEIcDAL#v=onepage&amp;q=Shaptahik%202000&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Home Ministry secretary Abdul Karim criticised the publication of the article by the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eid issue of Shaptahik 2000 banned|url=https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2007/09/20/eid-issue-of-shaptahik-2000-banned|accessdate=12 February 2018|work=bdnews24.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moinul Ahsan Saber]], the editor of the magazine, announced that the magazine would be discontinued after 31 October 2014. The decision to close the magazine was taken by the publisher, Mahfuz Anam, due to falling revenue.&lt;ref name="DT"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5553">The '''Southern California Linux Expo''' ('''SCALE''') is an annual [[Linux]], [[open source software|open source]] and [[free software]] conference held in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], since 2002. Despite having Linux in its name, SCALE covers all open source operating systems and software. It is a volunteer-run event.

The event features an expo floor with both commercial and non-profit exhibitors, as well as 3 days of seminars on the topic of Linux and Open Source software. Sessions and presentations cover a broad spectrum of topics and technical levels.

SCALE grew out of a series of LUGFests put on by the Simi Conejo Linux Users Group in the late 90s.   There were four of them, held every 6 months at the Nortel development facility in Simi Valley, California. They ended when Nortel closed that facility in 2001.  Subsequently, members from SCLUG, USCLUG and UCLALUG organized to create a more regional event, which they named the Southern California Linux Expo.

Companies, organizations and projects represented at SCALE include Linux-based projects such as [[Debian]], [[Gentoo Linux]], the [[Fedora Project]], [[KDE]] and [[GNOME]], other open-source operating systems including [[NetBSD]] and [[FreeBSD]], software projects such as [[Django (web framework)|Django]], open-source database systems such as [[MySQL]] and [[PostgreSQL]], other open-source applications such as [[Drupal]], [[Inkscape]], [[MythTV]] and [[The Document Foundation]], activist organizations such as the [[Software Freedom Law Center]] and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], major technology companies such as [[IBM]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] and [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]], web companies including [[Google]], [[Facebook]] and [[eHarmony]], and internet projects including [[CAcert.org]] and [[OpenStreetMap]].

A '''death''' is '''suspicious''' if it is unexpected and its circumstances or cause are medically or legally unexplained. Normally, this occurs in the context of medical care, suicide or suspected criminal activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Timmermans|first=Stefan|title=Postmortem: How Medical Examiners Explain Suspicious Deaths|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal procedure==
===United Kingdom===
In cases of suspicious death in [[England]], the police are required to contact a [[coroner]], who will open an [[inquest]], which is automatically adjourned to allow the police to continue their investigations. This adjourned inquest means that the death can be officially registered and a temporary [[death certificate]] issued. If, as a result of police enquiries, a criminal is charged or an accident is shown to have occurred, a full death certificate is issued. Otherwise, the coroner holds a full inquest. In [[Scotland]], the coroner's functions are carried out by a "[[procurator fiscal]]", who is appointed by the [[Lord Advocate]] to investigate unexpected or accidental deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duckett|first=Thomas|title=Surviving Violent Crime and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority|year=2003|publisher=T.S. Duckett|pages=82–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Any suspicious death of a British national outside of Britain is required to be investigated through an inquest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Alex|title=Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act|year=2008|publisher=Workplace Law Group|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a suspicious death occurs aboard a British [[Royal Navy|naval]] or merchant vessel, the body is preserved by refrigeration until the ship arrives at port, at which point the police and coroner begin their investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Jennifer &amp; Michael|title=Dealing with Death: A Handbook of Practices, Procedures and Law|year=2006|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|pages=52}}

"'''Tennessee'''" is the title of a number-one [[R&amp;B]] single by [[alternative hip hop]] [[music group|group]] [[Arrested Development (band)|Arrested Development]], from its album ''[[3 Years, 5 Months &amp; 2 Days in the Life Of...]]''. The song contains a sample of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s "[[Alphabet St.]]". The music video for the song was directed by [[Milcho Manchevski]] and shot in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], with friends of the group and people from the local area appearing in the clip. The song won the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group|Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]] in 1993. A recent poll of [[VH1]] viewers placed the song at number 71 on the list of the "Greatest Songs of the 90s" and is listed as one of the [[500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll]] by the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].  It was ranked number 78 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop. The song also served as the theme to the short-lived [[Malcolm-Jamal Warner]] sitcom [[Here and Now (1992 TV series)|''Here and Now'']].

== Background ==
[[Speech (rapper)|Speech]] was inspired to write the song after meeting up with his brother at his grandmother's funeral in Tennessee. Shortly afterward, his brother died suddenly from a bad [[asthma attack]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Unsung (TV series)|Unsung]]''musical documentary program on [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]] cable channel, airdate Monday 13 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and Speech wrote the song about the experience of losing two loved ones so close together&lt;ref name="Speech of Arrested Development Interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/speech_of_arrested_development/ |title=Speech of Arrested Development Interview |publisher=Songfacts.com |deadurl=no |accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song uses a sample from Prince's "Alphabet Street" which was not cleared ahead of time. Prince's lawyers waited until after the song sold well and then charged the group $100,000 for the use of said sample.&lt;ref name="Speech of Arrested Development Interview"/&gt; Speech later said he felt Prince gave him "a break" by demanding a single payment instead of co-writing credit on the song, which would have entitled Prince to a share of all royalties in the future. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/arrested-development-wouldnt-exist-without-prince/ |title=Why Arrested Development wouldn’t exist without Prince |deadurl=no |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7287">The '''Texas Rose Festival''', a three-day event held annually in [[Tyler, Texas]], celebrates the role of the rose-growing industry in the local economy. The festivities, taking place during the third weekend of October,&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/legacies/TX/200003566.html]&lt;/ref&gt; draw thousands of tourists to the city each year.

==History==
The first Tyler Rose Festival was organized by Tyler Garden Club members, local rose growers and the Chamber of Commerce in October 1933 for the purpose of focusing attention on the importance of the rose industry to Tyler, and to showcase the towns elegance;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.texasrosefestival.com/festival/then.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313154153/http://www.texasrosefestival.com/festival/then.htm |archivedate=2008-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was renamed the Texas Rose Festival during the Texas Centennial in 1936. Aside from the festival's suspension during [[World War II]], it has been an annual event.

==The Rose Queen and her court==
Many of the festival's events center on the '''Rose Queen''' and her court, who wear lavish gowns and costumes that are often in keeping with the theme of the year's festival. These participants generally come from wealthy backgrounds {{citation needed|date=October 2013}} and often have long family histories with the festival; many have played various roles in the events since childhood.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The queen and her court are chosen by the President of the Texas Rose Festival Association who works in the organization for 4 years before taking on the role as President.

In addition to the Rose Queen, the court includes:
* The '''Duchess of the Rose Growers''', a member of a rose-growing family selected by and representing the Texas Rose Growers Association.
* '''Out-of-town [[duchess]]es and escorts''', sponsored by a family involved in the Rose Festival and invited because of relationships with Tyler residents.
* ''' Ladies in waiting''', a select group of young women from Tyler, in their sophomore year of college, whose families have been involved in the festival for several years.
* '''Train bearers''', '''[[scepter]] bearers''' and '''attendants to the queen''', usually elementary-school-aged children whose families are involved in the festival.

==Rose Festival events==
Rose Festival events open to the public generally include:

* A '''[[Vespers]]''' service, held at the home church of the reigning Rose Queen
* The '''Queen's [[Tea (meal)#Afternoon tea|Tea]]''', in which the public is invited to mingle with the Rose Queen and her court at the Tyler Municipal Rose Garden
* A '''Men's Luncheon''' and a '''Ladies' Luncheon''', featuring guest speakers
* '''Queen's [[Coronation]]''' ceremonies
* The '''Rose Festival [[Parade]]''', featuring floats, bands and a number of community groups
* A '''Rose Show''' and [[gardening]] seminars
* The '''Rose Festival [[handicraft|Arts and crafts]] Show''' at Tyler's Rose Garden.

There are also many other events such as an art show; a car show; doll, bear and toy shows; an arts and crafts fair; and symphony concerts in the park.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/&gt;

The Rose Parade is easily the biggest part of the Rose Festival. This parade takes place on the Saturday morning of the festival, and starts on Fifth St. and travels down Erwin to the Rose Stadium where it ends.  It is free to watch the parade on the streets, but you must buy a ticket to be admitted into the shaded side of the stadium.

A number of private parties also coincide with the festival, including the Queen's Coronation Ball hosted by the Order of the Rose.

'''''The Last Temptations''''' ({{lang-fi|Viimeiset kiusaukset}}) is an [[opera]] in two acts by [[Joonas Kokkonen]] to a libretto by [[Lauri Kokkonen]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naytelmat.fi/index.php?view=writer&amp;id=187&amp;pid=2853 | Viimeiset Kiusaukset. 1959. Lauri Kokkonen. Naytelmat.fi  In Finnish&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with [[Leevi Madetoja]]'s ''[[Pohjalaisia]]'' and [[Aarre Merikanto]]'s ''[[Juha (Merikanto)|Juha]]'', it is considered one of the most important Finnish operas.  The opera deals with the life of the late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century folk preacher [[Paavo Ruotsalainen]]. Kokkonen worked on the opera for 16 years before finishing the work. It was premiered in [[Helsinki]] by the [[Finnish National Opera]] in 1975.

The opera consists of two acts divided in 14 scenes. The combining element of the work is the hymn number 382 in the current [[Virsikirja|Finnish hymnal]] of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], ''My Lord, my God in all distress'' {{lang-fi|Sinuhun turvaan Jumala}} (382) which is a reoccurring theme throughout the opera. A chorus containing the whole hymn concludes the opera.

== Performances ==

After the premiere, the opera has already had almost three hundred performances. [[Finnish National Opera]] toured with the work in seven cities abroad – including at New York's [[Metropolitan Opera]]. At the Finnish National Opera there have been three productions: 1975–1983 (directed by Sakari Puurunen) and 1994 (directed by Paavo Liski) and 2001 (directed by Jussi Tapola).

The [[Savonlinna Opera Festival]] performed the opera for several years, 1977–1980. In Helsinki and Savonlinna the most famous singers in the role of Paavo were [[Martti Talvela]] and [[Jaakko Ryhänen]].

In 2007 the opera was performed as a half-staged production in the [[Temppeliaukio church]] in Helsinki four times. Finnish film director [[Åke Lindman]] directed ''The Last Temptations'' on the original homestead of Paavo Ruotsalainen in [[Aholansaari]], [[Nilsiä]], Finland during four summers in 2000–2003 from where the production was transferred to new outdoor arena in Nilsiä to be performed in summer 2007.

A renewed full-scale production of the opera saw light in summer 2009 in [[Nivala]], Finland. In the roles were baritone [[Esa Ruuttunen]] as Paavo, soprano [[Johanna Rusanen-Kartano]] as Riitta, [[Petri Pussila]] as smith and [[Lassi Virtanen]], first man.

The popularity of the opera has lasted over the years. In 2015 it was produced by Pohjois-Kymi music school. Esa Ruuttunen sang the role of Paavo Ruotsalainen.&lt;ref name="kouvolansanomat"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kiistelty kouvolalaispyhäkkö saa kehuja lavastajalta — Viimeiset kiusaukset kirkossa |url=http://www.kouvolansanomat.fi/Online/2015/05/07/Kiistelty%20kouvolalaispyh%C3%A4kk%C3%B6%20saa%20kehuja%20lavastajalta%20%E2%80%94%20Viimeiset%20kiusaukset%20kirkossa%20/2015219004083/4|accessdate=25 July 2015|year=2015|publisher=Kouvolan sanomat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

===Act I===
''Scene 1: Paavo's Deathbed''

On a stormy winter night Paavo tosses on his bed in fever. He calls for Riitta, his deceased first wife. His second wife Anna Loviisa and servant Albertiina enter. They try to comfort Paavo by singing his favorite hymn. Paavo sobers up but shouting orders the women to leave for, as he says, to Heaven's gate he must go alone.

''Interlude I''

''Scene 2: Riitta at the Dance''

Paavo relives in his hallucinations key events of his life. In his youth he meet Riitta at a dance. Three men and three women mock him and warn Riitta not to go with Paavo, a madman, for it will only bring her misery. Nevertheless, Riitta decides to go with Paavo. Riitta calls for Paavo and encourages him, but he refuses and says that he must go the barrier of Heavan alone.

''Interlude II''

''Scene 3: The Smith''

Riitta takes Paavo to visit the smith who had instilled faith in him in his youth, blacksmith Jaakko (Jakob) Högman. Riitta accuses the blacksmith for compelling Paavo to wander around in revivalist meetings, leaving family behind to starve. The blacksmith retorts contemptuously to Riitta, but then adds that the gate of Heaven is open to those who suffer and toil. Paavo mutters that he is too weak to open the gate.

''Interlude III''

''Scene 4: The Frost''

Paavo and Riitta are at their first homestead by the lake. Paavo promises to build a new house, but a wicker gate ominously reminds him of the Barrier of Heaven which he dare not approach. The chorus comments how Paavo took Riitta to the backwoods to a life of misery. The white frost suddenly rises, threatening the crop. Riitta and Paavo together try to fight it to no use. In the struggle to move the air on the field they trample their baby underfoot.

''Interlude IV''

''Scene 5: Juhana''

Paavo's son Juhana is repairing his father's knapsack. Juhana is longing to get away from the dreary existence to a wider world. He dances at the thought and teases his mother. She snatches the knapsack away to hide it from Paavo, to keep him from leaving the family for his travels.

''Interlude V''

''Scene 6: The Last Loaf''

Paavo demands his knapsack back. Riitta shouts back complaining about him always wandering, not caring for work or family. Riitta threatens to kill Paavo to spare him the shame of starving his family. She hurls the axe at him, but misses. Paavo tries to explain and reconcile the needs of the family and the overriding importance of spreading the Gospel. He thinks that what he has done was in vain. He calls out for Riitta, but cannot find her.

''Interlude VI''

''Scene 7: Juhana's Death Revealed''

Village women come to the house. They look at the dent left by the axe Riitta threw at Paavo. They tell her in a roundabout way that Juhana has been murdered. They wonder why Riitta does not weep. She replies that she wept for him for three whole years. Paavo has been listening, and cries that all his life God has been scourging and punishing him with an iron whip, and he has deserved it.

''Interlude VII''

''Scene 8: Riitta's Death''

Riitta is dying three years later. She feels calm and remembers the happy illusion of the first homestead on the island, where Paavo used to sing thanks to God's blessings. Paavo is surprised: Riitta can give thanks. Yes, she replies, and sees the barrier of Heaven open in front of her. She asks Paavo to recite a thanksgiving hymn. He sings and Juhana joins in. Riitta rises and goes toward her son to Heaven's door.

=== Act II ===

''Scene 1: The Assizes''

Three men want to confound Paavo at the place where he once had to defend himself at the Assizes against charges of undermining the authority of the Church. They feed Paavo's depression and reveal themselves as his enemies. They humiliate his arrogance and taunt him with dancing girls. Paavo collapses in despair, but the chorus sings a hymn of encouragement.

''Interlude I''

''Scene 2: The Fisherman''

Riitta appears, calling Paavo to the Island. Paavo insists his calling to speak to the nation. "Into the sea of men I cast a net all flaming with it I search for sinful wretches.." Riitta repeats the call, but he insists he must speak at the graduation ceremony in Helsinki.

''Interlude II''

''Scene 3: The Graduation''

At the University graduation Paavo wants to go as an invited guest, but three men and three women stop him. They tell him he is uneducated idiot who has no business at the University ceremony. Paavo retorts that he has read religious tracts since he was a boy. He hears his own hymn sung and tries to address the academics. Paavo tries to follow the Bishop of the North, but is rejected. He calls out a prayer.

''Interlude III''

''Scene 4: The Call to the Island''

Riitta calls Paavo to the Island. He resists. He doubts he would be welcome. Finally he yields to Riitta's pleas, but objecting he is but a wretched sinner.

''Interlude IV''

''Scene 5: The Dead''

Paavo is praying for forgiveness. The blacksmith appears, encouraging him, then Riitta with a thanksgiving, then Juhana, singing the Lord's Prayer. It is time for Paavo to settle accounts of his life. His time has come.

''Interlude V''
''Scene 6: Paavo's Death''

Paavo is lying on his bed in the cottage. He is still tossing around and crying. Gradually he comes round, surrounded by family. The three men and three women who have tormented him turn out to be his daughters and their husbands. Paavo recognizes that his time has come. He makes sure that his will is in order, and tells his family to plant a prickly tree on his grave, for he has been the prickliest of men. He asks the servant to read to him from the favorite tract, and begins to sing his hymn. Everyone gradually joins in; Paavo goes quiet and listens. He hear Riitta in the distance, calling him to the Island. Paavo praises God. He knows that he has overcome.

"'''The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall'''" (1835) is a [[short story]] by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] published in the June 1835 issue of the monthly magazine ''[[Southern Literary Messenger]]'', and intended by Poe to be a hoax.{{not verified in body|date=September 2017}}

Poe planned to continue the hoax in further installments, but was upstaged by the famous [[Great Moon Hoax]] which started in the August 25, 1835 issue of the ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' daily newspaper. Poe later wrote that the flippant tone of the story made it easy for educated readers to see through the supposed hoax.

==Plot summary==
[[File:Poe Hans Pfaall Yan Dargent.jpg|thumb|Yan Dargent's illustration about ''The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall'' for [[Jules Verne]]'s "Edgar Poe et ses œuvres" (1864)]]
The story opens with the delivery to a crowd gathered in [[Rotterdam]] of a manuscript detailing the journey of a man named Hans Pfaall. The manuscript, which comprises the majority of the story, sets out in detail how Pfaall contrived to reach the moon by benefit of a revolutionary new balloon and a device which compresses the vacuum of space into breathable air. The journey takes him nineteen days, and the narrative includes descriptions of the Earth from space as well as the descent to its fiery, volcanic satellite. Pfaall withholds most of the information regarding the surface of the moon and its inhabitants in order to negotiate a pardon from the Burgomaster for several murders he committed as he left earth (creditors of his who were becoming irksome). After reading the manuscript, the city authorities agree that Pfaall should be pardoned, but the messenger who brought them the text (apparently a resident of the moon) has vanished and they are unable to restore communication with him.

==Literary significance==
Poe's story may have had an influence on, and is referenced in [[Jules Verne|Jules Verne's]] ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'', which seems to be a retelling of the story.&lt;ref&gt;Tretsch, John. "Extra! Extra! Poe invents science fiction!" as collected in ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe'', edited by Kevin J. Hayes. Cambridge University Press, 2002: 117. {{ISBN|0-521-79727-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe later published a similar hoax, "[[The Balloon-Hoax]]", in the ''New York Sun''.

'''''Tick, Tick... Boom!''''' (styled as '''''tick, tick... BOOM!''''') is a [[Musical theater|musical]] written by American composer [[Jonathan Larson]], who won a [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]] and three [[Tony Awards]] for his musical ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]''.  ''Tick, Tick... Boom!'' tells the story of an aspiring composer named Jon, who lives in [[New York City]] in 1990. Jon is worried he has made the wrong career choice to be part of the performing arts. The story is [[autobiographical]], as stated by Larson's father in the liner notes of the [[cast recording]] – Larson had been trying to establish himself in theater since the early 1980s.

Larson began to perform the piece as a solo work in 1990.  After his death in 1996, it was revised and revamped by playwright [[David Auburn]] as a three-actor piece and was premiered [[Off-Broadway]] in 2001. Since then, the show has had a [[Off-West End]] production, a [[West End theatre|West End]] production, an [[United States|American]] national tour, two Off-Broadway revivals in 2014 and 2016, and numerous local and international productions.

==History==
The show was first performed [[Off-Off-Broadway]] in September 1990 by [[Jonathan Larson]] in a [[workshop]] at the [[Second Stage Theatre]] under the title ''Boho Days''. Larson revised the developing piece following Second Stage, changing the title to ''Tick, Tick... Boom!'', and presented with him as performer in November 1991 at the [[Village Gate]] (with college pal Victoria Leacock producing), and then later in 1992 and 1993 in the "O Solo Mio" fests at [[New York Theatre Workshop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/tick-tickboom-cast-album-released-sept-11-com-98538|title=tick, tick...BOOM! Cast Album Released Sept. 11|work=Playbill|date=11 September 2016|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larson performed the show as a "rock monologue," a new form of theatre for the time.  The performance attracted the attention of a young producer named [[Jeffrey Seller]], who became a fan of Larson's work.  In 1995, he saw the New York Theatre Workshop production of Larson's musical ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' and convinced his fellow producers to bring it to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].

After Larson's death in 1996, Leacock asked [[David Auburn]], author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play ''[[Proof (play)|Proof]]'', to reconfigure ''Tick, Tick...Boom!''. He restructured the monologue into a three actor musical,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturevulture.net/theater/TickTick.htm|title=Tick, tick...BOOM! - Jonathan Larson|work=CultureVulture|accessdate=18 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614032727/http://www.culturevulture.net/theater/TickTick.htm|archivedate=14 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with one actor playing Jon and the other two actors playing Michael and Susan, as well as all the other roles in the show. Also, the script and score were streamlined and edited. This revised version of the piece premiered [[Off-Broadway]] at the [[Jane Street Theater]] on May 23, 2001. Auburn received credit as "Script Consultant".&lt;ref name=iodb&gt;{{iobdb title| 6242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Over a persistent ticking sound, Jon introduces himself: “The sound you are hearing is not a technical problem. It is not a musical cue. It is not a joke. It is the sound of one man's mounting anxiety. I... am that man.”  Jon is an aspiring composer for musical theatre, who lives in [[SoHo]], New York.  He is nearing his 30th birthday and worries about his aging and lack of achievement (“30/90”).  Michael, a friend of Jon's since childhood, gave up acting to pursue a more lucrative career as a research executive. Susan, Jon's girlfriend, is a dancer who teaches ballet to “wealthy and untalented children.”

Susan and Jon discuss the upcoming 30th birthday party that she is throwing for him. She pressures him to play “[[Happy Birthday to You]]” to himself on the piano at the party, but he is hesitant because it reminds him of the aging aspect of birthdays.  Michael wants to schedule a job interview for Jon with Michael's firm. Again, Jon is hesitant, but agrees to think it over.  Later, on the roof of his apartment building, Jon reveals that he is also nervous about an upcoming workshop of his newest musical, ''SUPERBIA.'' Susan comes to join him; he comments on her dress and how beautiful it makes her look (“Green Green Dress”).

The next morning, Jon is awake early.  Susan asks him about the possibility of leaving New York.  Susan wants to raise a family and doesn’t view that as compatible with Jon's “starving artist” lifestyle.  Jon is torn between following his dream of composing and opting for security and family in a different career. Meanwhile, the other two main characters recap their views on what Jon should do (“Johnny Can’t Decide”). Jon's reverie, however, is cut short; he needs to report to his day job as a waiter in a SoHo diner (“Sunday”).

After work, Michael picks Jon up in his brand new [[BMW]] to show Jon his new apartment. Michael exults at the thought of a life of luxury (“No More”), and pressures Jon further to consider changing his career path. Frustrated, Jon finally agrees to accompany Michael to work the next day and visit a brainstorming session at his firm.  Back at home, Jon phones his parents and then his agent.  He plans to spend the remainder of the evening composing, but he is interrupted by a call from Susan, who wants to see him.  They argue, albeit in a passive and psychological manner that scarcely seems like an argument at all (“Therapy”).

On Monday morning, Jon walks to Michael's office for his brainstorming session. On the way, Jon thinks back to a workshop in which his work was reviewed by a composer “so legendary his name may not be uttered aloud…” (“St----- S-------”).  He also worries about his musical style and its place on Broadway, but has little time to develop this train of thought before he arrives at Michael's firm.  The brainstorming session involves naming a cooking fat substitute through a convoluted “idea-generating” process.  Jon sees the futility of the process, and his unwillingness to cooperate gets him removed from the meeting. Later, as Jon drives Michael to the airport for a business trip, they argue about the meeting. Michael tells Jon that the life Susan wants doesn’t sound bad, and that he wishes his job could give him the chance to settle down (“Real Life”).

After dropping Michael off, Jon goes to a rehearsal for ''SUPERBIA,'' but not before stopping to get a snack of [[Twinkies]] (“Sugar”). At the market, he spies Karessa Johnson, one of his actors for ''SUPERBIA.'' She reveals a similar weakness for Twinkies, and this leads to a sudden friendship between the two. After the rehearsal, Susan sees Jon and Karessa walking together and becomes jealous. She informs Jon that she's gotten a job in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] which may be permanent. Jon and Susan argue about the state of their relationship; in a turnaround from the events leading up to “Therapy,” Jon begs Susan to stay and be with him. Despite this, she leaves for home, and Jon thinks about what may have happened to make her behave this way (“See Her Smile”).

The next morning, Jon arrives early at the theatre for the workshop of ''SUPERBIA.'' Although initially the theatre is empty, soon it is filled with very important people: Jon's family and friends, as well as Broadway producers and artists, including Jon's idol, St----- S-------. Karessa steals the show with her performance of “Come to Your Senses”.  The workshop is a success, and Jon gets many congratulations; but there are no offers to produce ''SUPERBIA'' on or off Broadway. Jon is no closer to being a professional composer, and so, in his eyes, the workshop has been a failure.

After the workshop, Jon visits Michael and tells him that he is through with music. For the first time, though, Michael tries to persuade him to stick with it. Michael says that while he enjoys how he makes a lot more money now than he did as a starving artist, he finds the job itself to be emotionally banal and unrewarding. The two argue, and Jon yells at Michael for not understanding fear or insecurity. Michael responds by telling Jon that he is HIV-positive. Shocked at this news, Jon leaves quickly.

Distressed and alone, Jon wanders through [[Central Park]] until he finds himself in the abandoned theater inside [[Belvedere Castle]]. He finds an old rehearsal piano, and begins to play it while collecting his thoughts. Jon ponders on whether the amount of sacrifice required for his career in music is worth it, and whether those telling him to “have it all, play the game” are right (“Why”). Ultimately, he realizes that he will only be happy as a professional composer, no matter what hardships that may bring.

The next morning is Jon's thirtieth birthday party (“30/90 Reprise”). He sees Susan, who is getting ready to leave. She gives him his birthday gift: a thousand sheets of blank manuscript paper. They agree to write to each other, and she leaves.  Michael gives him a birthday gift of belts (Michael thinks belts are a sign of luxury).  The phone rings, and the caller is [[Stephen Sondheim]].  Sondheim leaves Jon his contact information so they can meet and discuss ''SUPERBIA''.  Jon realizes that he is surrounded by friends and that his talents are finally being recognized.  He says, “the tick tick booms are softer now. I can barely hear them, and I think if I play loud enough I can drown them out completely.”  Jon sits down at his piano to play “Happy Birthday to You.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtishows.com/show_home.asp?ID=000279 plot synopsis at MTI Shows] mtishows.com, accessed December 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curtainup.com/ticktickboom.html Curtain Up review], curtainup.com, June 22, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notes'''
*"Sunday", Jon's song at the diner, is based on the Act I Finale from the [[Stephen Sondheim]] musical ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]''; Larson conceived it as a humorous homage to Sondheim, one of his largest influences.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, John.[http://www.talkinbroadway.com/regional/dallas/dallas78.html Review, Majestic Theatre] talkinbroadway.com, Jan 9, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
*In "Johnny Can't Decide", all the characters are referring to themeselves in third person, just like George in the song "Lesson #8" from ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]].'' In the monologue version of the musical, only Jon was doing this.
*Another reference to Sondheim is present in the song "Why". Not only mentioning ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' in the lyrics, the song utilizes the same tritone made famous in the ''West Side Story'' song "[[Maria (1956 song)|Maria]]".
*In "Why", we can hear fragments of songs: "Yellow Bird", "[[Let's Go Fly a Kite]]" from the film ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', "Cool" and "Tonight - Quintet" both from ''West Side Story'', and finally "Come to Your Senses" from Larson's ''Superbia''.
*On the cast recording, there is an additional song cut from the final version of the show, "Boho Days".  This track is one of the few recordings of Larson's voice publicly available. It was extracted from a demo tape recorded by Larson during the development of ''Tick, Tick... Boom!&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Tick-Tick-Boom/dp/B00138F1UW Tick, Tick...Boom! Cast recording listing], amazon.com, accessed December 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
*On the 1989 demo album of ''tick, tick... Boom!'', one track is "Why", performed by Larson himself. In this recording,  instead of "Come to Your Senses" we can hear fragment of "LCD Readout", which also comes from ''Superbia''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2748">'''Unified Cornish (UC)''' (''Kernewek Uny[e]s'', ''KU'') is a variety of the [[Cornish language]] of the [[Cornish revival]]. Developed gradually by [[Robert Morton Nance]] during and before the 1930s, it derived its name from its standardisation of the variant spellings of traditional Cornish MSS. Nance's recommended spelling and grammar, based on Middle Cornish, soon supplanted [[Henry Jenner]]'s system, which had been based largely on Late Cornish. Most of the older generation of Cornish users alive today would have started under this system. It was also the form originally used by [[Gorsedh Kernow]], although they now use the new [[Standard Written Form]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20090414200436/http://www.magakernow.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=38814 Gorsedh Adopts the SWF - Cornish Language Partnership]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In the 1980s, Unified Cornish came under heavy criticism, leading to the creation of [[Kernewek Kemmyn]] (KK) and [[Modern Cornish]] (also called, Revived Late Cornish, "RLC"). Some Cornish speakers continued to employ Unified Cornish nonetheless.

==Unified Cornish, Revised==
In the 1990s, yet another variety emerged when '''Unified Cornish Revised''' (UCR) ({{lang-kw|Kernowek Unys Amendys}}, "KUA") was devised by [[Nicholas Williams]].

==Adoption of the Standard Written Form==
In May 2008 the Cornish Language Partnership agreed on a single written form of Cornish to be known as the [[Standard Written Form]] (SWF) to be used by [[Cornwall Council]] authorities for the purposes of education and public life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cornwall/7074487.stm Breakthrough for Cornish language] BBC News, 19 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magakernow.org.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=37768&amp;p=0 An Outline of the Standard Written Form of Cornish] Maga Kernow&lt;/ref&gt; The Cornish Language Partnership has specified that ''Furv Skrifys Savonek'' (FSS) is the SWF translation for ''Standard Written Form''. Users of UCR and KS prefer the term ''Form Screfys Standard''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kernowek.net/ Kernowek Standard: An orthography for the Cornish Language]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2008 [[Agan Tavas]] reaffirmed its support for Unified Cornish, as well as for the SWF and for [[Kernowek Standard]].
