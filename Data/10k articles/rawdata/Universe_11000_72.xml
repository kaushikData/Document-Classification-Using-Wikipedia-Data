'''Analytical chemistry''' studies and uses instruments and methods used to [[Separation process|separate]], identify, and [[Quantification (science)|quantify]] matter.&lt;ref name="isbn0-03-005938-0"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Skoog, Douglas A. |author2=West, Donald M. |author3=Holler, F. James |author4=Crouch, Stanley R. |title=Fundamentals of Analytical Chemistry |publisher=Brooks/Cole, Cengage Learning |location=Belmont |year=2014 |page=1 |isbn=978-0-495-55832-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, separation, identification or quantification may constitute the entire analysis or be combined with another method. Separation isolates [[analyte]]s. [[Qualitative inorganic analysis|Qualitative analysis]] identifies analytes, while [[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|quantitative analysis]] determines the numerical amount or concentration.

Analytical chemistry consists of classical, [[wet chemistry|wet chemical methods]] and modern, [[#instrumental methods|instrumental methods]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-03-002078-6"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Skoog, Douglas A. |author2=Holler, F. James |author3=Crouch, Stanley R. |title=Principles of Instrumental Analysis |publisher=Brooks/Cole, Thomson |location=Belmont, CA |year=2007 |page=1|isbn=978-0-495-01201-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical qualitative methods use separations such as [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]], [[Extraction (chemistry)|extraction]], and [[distillation]]. Identification may be based on differences in color, odor, melting point, boiling point, radioactivity or reactivity. Classical quantitative analysis uses mass or volume changes to quantify amount. Instrumental methods may be used to separate samples using [[chromatography]], [[electrophoresis]] or [[field flow fractionation]]. Then qualitative and quantitative analysis can be performed, often with the same instrument and may use [[spectroscopy|light interaction]],  [[thermodynamics|heat interaction]], [[electrochemistry|electric fields]] or [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|magnetic fields]]. Often the same instrument can separate, identify and quantify an analyte.

Analytical chemistry is also focused on improvements in [[experimental design]], [[chemometrics]], and the creation of new measurement tools. Analytical chemistry has broad applications to forensics, medicine, science and engineering.

==History==
[[File:Bunsen-Kirchhoff.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|[[Gustav Kirchhoff]] (left) and [[Robert Bunsen]] (right)]]
Analytical chemistry has been important since the early days of chemistry, providing methods for determining which elements and chemicals are present in the object in question. During this period significant contributions to analytical chemistry include the development of systematic [[elemental analysis]] by [[Justus von Liebig]] and systematized organic analysis based on the specific reactions of functional groups.

The first instrumental analysis was flame emissive spectrometry developed by [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] who discovered [[rubidium]] (Rb) and [[caesium]] (Cs) in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arikawa|first=Yoshiko|title=Basic Education in Analytical Chemistry|journal=Analytical Sciences|year=2001|volume=17|issue=Supplement|pages=i571–i573|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/analscisp/17icas/0/17icas_0_i571/_pdf|accessdate=10 January 2014|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the major developments in analytical chemistry take place after 1900. During this period instrumental analysis becomes progressively dominant in the field. In particular many of the basic spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques were discovered in the early 20th century and refined in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0039-9140(99)00358-6 |title=Review of analytical measurements facilitated by drop formation technology |year=2000 |last1=Miller |first1=K |journal=Talanta |volume=51 |issue=5 |pages=921–33 |pmid=18967924 |last2=Synovec |first2=RE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[separation processes|separation sciences]] follow a similar time line of development and also become increasingly transformed into high performance instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0165-9936(02)00806-3 |title=History of gas chromatography |year=2002 |last1=Bartle |first1=Keith D. |last2=Myers |first2=Peter |journal=TrAC Trends in Analytical Chemistry |volume=21 |issue=9–10 |pages=547}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s many of these techniques began to be used together as hybrid techniques to achieve a complete characterization of samples.

Starting in approximately the 1970s into the present day analytical chemistry has progressively become more inclusive of biological questions (bioanalytical chemistry), whereas it had previously been largely focused on inorganic or [[Small molecule|small organic molecules]]. Lasers have been increasingly used in chemistry as probes and even to initiate and influence a wide variety of reactions. The late 20th century also saw an expansion of the application of analytical chemistry from somewhat academic chemical questions to [[Forensic chemistry|forensic]], [[Environmental chemistry|environmental]], [[Chemical industry|industrial]] and [[clinical chemistry|medical]] questions, such as in [[histology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0039-9140(89)80077-3 |title=History of analytical chemistry in the U.S.A |year=1989 |last1=Laitinen |first1=H.A. |journal=Talanta |volume=36 |pages=1–9 |pmid=18964671 |issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern analytical chemistry is dominated by instrumental analysis. Many analytical chemists focus on a single type of instrument. Academics tend to either focus on new applications and discoveries or on new methods of analysis. The discovery of a chemical present in blood that increases the risk of cancer would be a discovery that an analytical chemist might be involved in. An effort to develop a new method might involve the use of a [[tunable laser]] to increase the specificity and sensitivity of a spectrometric method. Many methods, once developed, are kept purposely static so that data can be compared over long periods of time. This is particularly true in industrial [[Quality Assurance|quality assurance]] (QA), forensic and environmental applications. Analytical chemistry plays an increasingly important role in the pharmaceutical industry where, aside from QA, it is used in discovery of new drug candidates and in clinical applications where understanding the interactions between the drug and the patient are critical.

==Classical methods==
[[File:Flame test.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The presence of [[copper]] in this qualitative analysis is indicated by the bluish-green color of the flame]]
Although modern analytical chemistry is dominated by sophisticated instrumentation, the roots of analytical chemistry and some of the principles used in modern instruments are from traditional techniques, many of which are still used today. These techniques also tend to form the backbone of most undergraduate analytical chemistry educational labs.

===Qualitative analysis===
A qualitative analysis determines the presence or absence of a particular compound, but not the mass or concentration. By definition, qualitative analyses do not measure quantity.

====Chemical tests====
{{details|Chemical test}}
There are numerous qualitative chemical tests, for example, the [[acid test (gold)|acid test]] for [[gold]] and the [[Kastle-Meyer test]] for the presence of [[blood]].

====Flame test====
{{details|Flame test}}
Inorganic qualitative analysis generally refers to a systematic scheme to confirm the presence of certain, usually aqueous, ions or elements by performing a series of reactions that eliminate ranges of possibilities and then confirms suspected ions with a confirming test. Sometimes small carbon containing ions are included in such schemes. With modern instrumentation these tests are rarely used but can be useful for educational purposes and in field work or other situations where access to state-of-the-art instruments are not available or expedient.

===Quantitative analysis===
{{details|Quantitative analysis (chemistry)}}
Quantitative analysis is the measurement of the quantities of particular chemical constituents present in a substance.

====Gravimetric analysis====
{{details|Gravimetric analysis}}
Gravimetric analysis involves determining the amount of material present by weighing the sample before and/or after some transformation. A common example used in undergraduate education is the determination of the amount of water in a hydrate by heating the sample to remove the water such that the difference in weight is due to the loss of water.

====Volumetric analysis====
{{details|Titration}}
Titration involves the addition of a reactant to a solution being analyzed until some equivalence point is reached. Often the amount of material in the solution being analyzed may be determined. Most familiar to those who have taken chemistry during secondary education is the acid-base titration involving a color changing indicator. There are many other types of titrations, for example potentiometric titrations.
These titrations may use different types of indicators to reach some equivalence point.

==Instrumental methods==
{{Main|Instrumental analysis}}
[[File:Analytical instrument.png|thumb|right|300 px|Block diagram of an analytical instrument showing the stimulus and measurement of response]]

===Spectroscopy===
{{Expand section|date=April 2016}}
{{details|Spectroscopy}}
Spectroscopy measures the interaction of the molecules with [[electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic radiation]]. Spectroscopy consists of many different applications such as [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]], [[emission spectroscopy|atomic emission spectroscopy]], [[ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy]], [[x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]], [[infrared spectroscopy]], [[Raman spectroscopy]], [[dual polarisation interferometry|dual polarization interferometry]], [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]], [[photoemission spectroscopy]], [[Mössbauer spectroscopy]] and so on.

===Mass spectrometry===
{{details|Mass spectrometry}}
[[File:1 MV accelerator mass spectrometer.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|An [[Accelerator mass spectrometry|accelerator mass spectrometer]] used for [[radiocarbon dating]] and other analysis]]
Mass spectrometry measures [[mass-to-charge ratio]] of molecules using [[Electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s. There are several ionization methods: electron impact, [[chemical ionization]], electrospray, fast atom bombardment, matrix assisted laser desorption ionization, and others. Also, mass spectrometry is categorized by approaches of mass analyzers: [[magnetic-sector]], [[quadrupole mass analyzer]], [[quadrupole ion trap]], [[time-of-flight mass spectrometry|time-of-flight]], [[Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance]], and so on.

===Electrochemical analysis===
{{details|Electroanalytical method}}
Electroanalytical methods measure the [[electric potential|potential]] ([[volts]]) and/or [[electric current|current]] ([[Ampere|amps]]) in an [[electrochemical cell]] containing the analyte.&lt;ref&gt;Bard, A.J.; Faulkner, L.R. '''Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications.''' New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2nd Edition, '''2000'''.{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skoog, D.A.; West, D.M.; Holler, F.J. '''Fundamentals of Analytical Chemistry''' New York: Saunders College Publishing, 5th Edition, '''1988'''.{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These methods can be categorized according to which aspects of the cell are controlled and which are measured.  The four main categories are [[Ion selective electrode|potentiometry]] (the difference in electrode potentials is measured), [[coulometry]] (the transferred charge is measured over time), [[amperometry]] (the cell's current is measured over time), and [[voltammetry]] (the cell's current is measured while actively altering the cell's potential).

===Thermal analysis===
{{further|Calorimetry|Thermal analysis}}
Calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis measure the interaction of a material and [[heat]].

===Separation===
[[File:TLC black ink.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Separation of black ink on a [[thin layer chromatography]] plate]]
{{further|Separation process|Chromatography|Electrophoresis}}
Separation processes are used to decrease the complexity of material mixtures.  [[Chromatography]], [[electrophoresis]] and  [[Field Flow Fractionation]] are representative of this field.

===Hybrid techniques===
Combinations of the above techniques produce a "hybrid" or "hyphenated" technique.&lt;ref name="pmid6353577"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.6353577|bibcode = 1983Sci...222..291W |title=Hyphenated techniques for analysis of complex organic mixtures |year=1983 |last1=Wilkins |first1=C. |journal=Science |volume=222 |issue=4621 |pages=291–6 |pmid=6353577 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9008869"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-9888(199701)32:1&lt;64::AID-JMS450&gt;3.0.CO;2-7 |title=High-performance Liquid Chromatography/NMR Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry:Further Advances in Hyphenated Technology |year=1997 |last1=Holt |first1=R.

For example, [[gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]], gas chromatography-[[infrared spectroscopy]], [[liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry]], liquid chromatography-[[NMR spectroscopy]]. liquid chromagraphy-infrared spectroscopy and capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry.

Hyphenated separation techniques refers to a combination of two (or more) techniques to detect and separate chemicals from solutions. Most often the other technique is some form of [[chromatography]]. Hyphenated techniques are widely used in [[chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]]. A [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]] is sometimes used instead of [[hyphen]], especially if the name of one of the methods contains a hyphen itself.

===Microscopy===
[[File:3D-SIM-3 Prophase 3 color.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|[[Fluorescence microscope]] image of two mouse cell nuclei in [[prophase]] (scale bar is 5 µm)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1156947 |title=Subdiffraction Multicolor Imaging of the Nuclear Periphery with 3D Structured Illumination Microscopy |year=2008 |last1=Schermelleh |first1=L. |last2=Carlton |first2=P.

{{details|Microscopy}}
The visualization of single molecules, single cells, biological tissues and [[nanomaterial]]s is an important and attractive approach in analytical science.  Also, hybridization with other traditional analytical tools is revolutionizing analytical science.  [[Microscopy]] can be categorized into three different fields: [[optical microscopy]], [[electron microscopy]], and [[scanning probe microscopy]].  Recently, this field is rapidly progressing because of the rapid development of the computer and camera industries.

{{further|Microfluidics|Lab-on-a-chip}}
Devices that integrate (multiple) laboratory functions on a single chip of only millimeters to a few square centimeters in size and that are capable of handling extremely small fluid volumes down to less than picoliters.

==Errors==
{{Main|Approximation error}}
Error can be defined as numerical difference between observed value and true value.&lt;ref&gt;G.L. David - ''Analytical Chemistry''&lt;/ref&gt;

In error the true value and observed value in chemical analysis can be related with each other by the equation
:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_{\rm a} = |x - \bar{x}| &lt;/math&gt;
where 
* &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{\rm a}&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute error.
* &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the true value.
* &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the observed value.
Error of a measurement is an inverse measure of accurate measurement i.e. smaller the error greater the accuracy of the measurement. 

Errors can be expressed relatively. Given the relative error(&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{\rm r}&lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{\rm r} = \frac{\varepsilon_{\rm a}}{|x|} = \left | \frac{x - \bar{x}}{x} \right |&lt;/math&gt;

The percent error can also be calculated:
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{\rm r} \times 100\% &lt;/math&gt;

If we want to use these values in a function, we may also want to calculate the error of the function. Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a function with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; variables. Therefore, the [[propagation of uncertainty]] must be calculated in order to know the error in &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{\rm a} (f) \approx  \sum_{i = 1}^N \left | \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} \right | \varepsilon_{\rm a}(x_i) = \left | \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} \right | \varepsilon_{\rm a}(x_1) + \left | \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} \right | \varepsilon_{\rm a}(x_2) + \ldots + \left | \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_N} \right | \varepsilon_{\rm a}(x_N)&lt;/math&gt;

==Standards==
{{see also|Analytical quality control}}

===Standard curve===
[[File:Calibration curve.png|thumb|right|200 px|A calibration curve plot showing [[Detection limit|limit of detection]] (LOD), [[Detection limit|limit of quantification]] (LOQ), dynamic range, and limit of linearity (LOL)]]
A general method for analysis of concentration involves the creation of a [[calibration curve]]. This allows for determination of the amount of a chemical in a material by comparing the results of unknown sample to those of a series of known standards. If the concentration of element or compound in a sample is too high for the detection range of the technique, it can simply be diluted in a pure solvent. If the amount in the sample is below an instrument's range of measurement, the method of addition can be used. In this method a known quantity of the element or compound under study is added, and the difference between the concentration added, and the concentration observed is the amount actually in the sample.

===Internal standards===
Sometimes an [[internal standard]] is added at a known concentration directly to an analytical sample to aid in quantitation. The amount of analyte present is then determined relative to the internal standard as a calibrant. An ideal internal standard is isotopically-enriched analyte which gives rise to the method of [[isotope dilution]].

===Standard addition===
The method of [[standard addition]] is used in instrumental analysis to determine concentration of a substance ([[analyte]]) in an unknown sample by comparison to a set of samples of known concentration, similar to using a [[calibration curve]]. Standard addition can be applied to most analytical techniques and is used instead of a [[calibration curve]] to solve the [[matrix effect]] problem.

==Signals and noise==
One of the most important components of analytical chemistry is maximizing the desired signal while minimizing the associated [[Noise (electronics)|noise]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-495-01201-7"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Crouch, Stanley |author2=Skoog, Douglas A. |title=Principles of instrumental analysis |publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |location=Australia |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=978-0-495-01201-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analytical figure of merit is known as the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (S/N or SNR).

Noise can arise from environmental factors as well as from fundamental physical processes.

===Thermal noise===
{{Main|Johnson–Nyquist noise}}
Thermal noise results from the motion of charge carriers (usually electrons) in an electrical circuit generated by their thermal motion. Thermal noise is [[white noise]] meaning that the power [[spectral density]] is constant throughout the [[frequency spectrum]].

The [[root mean square]] value of the thermal noise in a resistor is given by&lt;ref name="isbn0-495-01201-7" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v_{\rm RMS} = \sqrt { 4 k_{\rm B} T R \Delta f },&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]], ''T'' is the [[temperature]], ''R'' is the resistance, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the frequency &lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt;.

===Shot noise===
{{Main|Shot noise}}
Shot noise is a type of [[electronic noise]] that occurs when the finite number of particles (such as [[electron]]s in an electronic circuit or [[photon]]s in an optical device) is small enough to give rise to statistical fluctuations in a signal.

Shot noise is a [[Poisson process]] and the charge carriers that make up the current follow a [[Poisson distribution]].  The root mean square current fluctuation is given by&lt;ref name="isbn0-495-01201-7" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;i_{\rm RMS} = \sqrt{2 e I\Delta f}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''e'' is the [[elementary charge]] and ''I'' is the average current. Shot noise is white noise.

===Flicker noise===
{{Main|flicker noise}}
Flicker noise is electronic noise with a 1/''ƒ'' frequency spectrum; as ''f'' increases, the noise decreases. Flicker noise arises from a variety of sources, such as impurities in a conductive channel, generation and [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombination]] noise in a [[transistor]] due to base current, and so on. This noise can be avoided by [[modulation]] of the signal at a higher frequency, for example through the use of a [[lock-in amplifier]].

===Environmental noise===
[[File:Analyse thermo gravimetrique bruit.png|thumb|right|200 px|Noise in a [[thermogravimetric analysis]]; lower noise in the middle of the plot results from less human activity (and environmental noise) at night]]
[[Environmental noise]] arises from the surroundings of the analytical instrument. Sources of electromagnetic noise are [[power lines]], radio and television stations, [[wireless device]]s, [[Compact fluorescent lamp]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Health Concerns associated with Energy Efficient Lighting and their Electromagnetic Emissions | publisher=Trent University, Peterborough, ON, Canada
 | accessdate=2011-11-12 | url=http://www.emrpolicy.org/science/forum/08_havas_cfl_scenihr.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[electric motor]]s. Many of these noise sources are narrow bandwidth and therefore can be avoided. Temperature and [[vibration isolation]] may be required for some instruments.

===Noise reduction===
Noise reduction can be accomplished either in [[computer hardware]] or [[software]]. Examples of hardware noise reduction are the use of [[shielded cable]], [[analog filter]]ing, and signal modulation. Examples of software noise reduction are [[digital filter]]ing, [[ensemble average]], [[boxcar average]], and [[correlation]] methods.&lt;ref name="isbn0-495-01201-7" /&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Portable Screening Devices (1435) (8225044148).jpg|thumb|US [[Food and Drug Administration]] scientist uses portable near infrared spectroscopy device to detect potentially illegal substances]]
Analytical chemistry has applications including in [[forensic science]], [[bioanalysis]], [[Clinical chemistry|clinical analysis]], [[environmental analysis]], and [[List of materials analysis methods|materials analysis]]. Analytical chemistry research is largely driven by performance (sensitivity, [[detection limit]], selectivity, robustness, [[dynamic range]], [[linear range]], accuracy, precision, and speed), and cost (purchase, operation, training, time, and space). Among the main branches of contemporary analytical atomic spectrometry, the most widespread and universal are optical and mass spectrometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1070/RC2006v075n04ABEH001174 |title=Prospects in analytical atomic spectrometry |year=2006 |last1=Bol'Shakov |first1=Aleksandr A |last2=Ganeev |first2=Aleksandr A |last3=Nemets |first3=Valerii M |journal=Russian Chemical Reviews |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=289|arxiv = physics/0607078 |bibcode = 2006RuCRv..75..289B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the direct elemental analysis of solid samples, the new leaders are [[laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy|laser-induced breakdown]] and [[laser ablation]] mass spectrometry, and the related techniques with transfer of the laser ablation products into [[inductively coupled plasma]]. Advances in design of diode lasers and optical parametric oscillators promote developments in fluorescence and ionization spectrometry and also in absorption techniques where uses of optical cavities for increased effective absorption pathlength are expected to expand. The use of  plasma- and laser-based methods is increasing. An interest towards absolute (standardless) analysis has revived, particularly in   emission spectrometry.{{citation needed |date=March 2013}}

Great effort is being put in shrinking the analysis techniques to [[Integrated circuit|chip]] size.  Although there are few examples of such systems competitive with traditional analysis techniques, potential advantages include size/portability, speed, and cost. (micro [[total analysis system]] (µTAS) or [[lab-on-a-chip]]). [[Microscale chemistry]] reduces the amounts of chemicals used.

Many developments  improve the analysis of  biological systems.  Examples of rapidly expanding fields in this area are [[genomics]], [[DNA sequencing]] and related research in [[genetic fingerprinting]] and [[DNA microarray]]; [[proteomics]], the analysis of protein concentrations and modifications, especially in response to various stressors, at various developmental stages, or in various parts of the body, [[metabolomics]], which deals with metabolites; [[transcriptomics]], including mRNA and associated fields; [[lipidomics]] - lipids and its associated fields; [[peptidomics]] - peptides and its associated fields; and [[metalomics]], dealing with metal concentrations and especially with their binding to proteins and other molecules.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Analytical chemistry has played critical roles in the understanding of basic science to a variety of practical applications, such as biomedical applications, environmental monitoring, quality control of industrial manufacturing, forensic science and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/careers/college-to-career/areas-of-chemistry/analytical-chemistry.html|title=Analytical Chemistry - American Chemical Society|website=American Chemical Society|language=en|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent developments of computer automation and information technologies have extended analytical chemistry into a number of new biological fields. For example, automated DNA sequencing machines were the basis to complete human genome projects leading to the birth of [[genomics]]. Protein identification and peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry opened a new field of [[proteomics]].

Analytical chemistry has been an indispensable area in the development of [[nanotechnology]]. Surface characterization instruments, [[electron microscopes]] and scanning probe microscopes enables scientists to visualize atomic structures with chemical characterizations.

'''Tokamak COMPASS'''&lt;ref name="Panek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinzettl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Panek2015"/&gt; (COMPact ASSembly)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfGlpjJw_-0][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhHsOwLdCu4] is the main experimental facility of [[Tokamak]] department of Institute of Plasma Physics [http://www.ipp.cas.cz/vedecka_struktura_ufp/tokamak/] of the [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic]] since 2006. It was designed in the 1980s in the British Culham Science Centre as a flexible research facility dedicated mostly to plasma physics studies in circular and D shaped [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]].

The first plasma in COMPASS "broke down" in 1989 in a C-shaped [[vacuum]] vessel, i.e., in a simpler vessel with a circular cross-section. Pioneering experiments followed, including for example the [[ITER]]-relevant tests of [[magnetic field]] correction with saddle coils for RMPs experiment ([[Resonant magnetic perturbations]]) or experiments with non-inductive current drive in plasma.

The operation of tokamak restarted with a D-shaped vacuum vessel in 1992. The operation mode with high plasma confinement ([[H-mode]]) was achieved, which represents a reference operation ("standard scenario") for the ITER tokamak. The COMPASS tokamak with its size (major radius 0.6 m and height of the vessel approx. 0.7 m) ranks to smaller tokamaks capable of the [[H-mode]] operation. Importantly, due to its size and shape the COMPASS plasmas correspond to one tenth (in the linear scale) of the ITER plasmas. At present, besides COMPASS there are only two operational tokamaks in Europe with ITER-like configuration capable of regime with the high plasma confinement. It is the [[Joint European Torus]] (JET) and the German tokamak [[ASDEX Upgrade]] ([[Max Planck Institute of Plasma Physics|Institut für Plasmaphysik]], [[Garching]], Germany). JET is the biggest experimental device of this type in the world.

In 2002, British scientists started alternative research on larger, spherical tokamak [[Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak|MAST]]. Operation of COMPASS was discontinued due to insufficient resources for operation of both tokamaks, however, the research program foreseen for the latter tokamak was not concluded. Due to its important and not completely realised opportunities - and, in particular, due to its direct relevance to the ITER project - the facility was offered for free by the European Commission and UKAEA to the Institute of Plasma Physics AS CR in [[Prague]] in autumn 2004. {{neutrality|date=October 2016}} The Prague institute has been coordinating research in thermonuclear [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] in the [[Czech Republic]] in the framework of [[EURATOM]] since 1999. Team of physicists from the institute has a long-time experience in this field of research including operation of a small tokamak CASTOR. The European Commission has declared that the institute is fully competent to operate the tokamak COMPASS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6161">A '''cenosphere''' is a lightweight, inert, hollow sphere made largely of [[silica]] and [[alumina]]&lt;ref&gt;H. S. Kim and M. Islam, "Syntactic foams as building materials consisting of inorganic hollow microspheres and starch binder",  Chapter 1 in "Building Materials: Properties and Performance and Applications", Edited by Donald N. Cornejo and Jason L. Haro, Nova publishers, pp.1-56, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and filled with air or inert gas, typically produced as a [[byproduct]] of [[coal]] [[combustion]] at [[fossil fuel power plant|thermal power plants]].   The color of cenospheres varies from gray to almost white and their [[density]] is about {{convert|0.4|-|0.8|g/cm3|abbr=on}}&lt;!--0.4–0.8 g/cm³--&gt;, which gives them a great [[buoyancy]]. ''Cf.'' [[glass microspheres]].

Cenospheres are hard and rigid, light, waterproof, innoxious{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, and insulative.  This makes them highly useful in a variety of products, notably [[filler (materials)|fillers]]. Cenospheres are now used as fillers in [[cement]] to produce low-density [[concrete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ranjbar|first1=Navid|last2=Kuenzel|first2=Carsten|title=Cenospheres: A review|journal=Fuel|date=1 November 2017|volume=207|doi=10.1016/j.fuel.2017.06.059|accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, some manufacturers have begun filling metals and polymers with cenospheres to make lightweight [[composite material]]s with higher strength than other types of [[foam]] materials.&lt;ref&gt;Pandey S, Venkat A.N.C, Mondal D.P, Majumdar J.D, Jha A.K, Rao H &amp; Kumar H (2016)  ''Effect of Cenosphere Size and Volume Fraction on the Microstructure and Deformation Behavior of Ti-Cenosphere Syntactic Foam Made Through Powder Metallurgy Route''. Materials Performance and Characterization, 5(1), 266-288 ([http://www.astm.org/DIGITAL_LIBRARY/JOURNALS/MPC/PAGES/MPC20160021.htm résumé]).&lt;/ref&gt; Such composite materials are called [[syntactic foam]]. Aluminum-based syntactic foams are finding applications in the [[automotive]] sector.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

[[Silver]]-coated cenospheres are used in [[electrical conductivity|conductive]] coatings, tiles and fabrics. Another use is in conductive [[paint]]s for [[antistatic]] coatings and [[electromagnetic shielding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.camouflage.com.au/SPECTRO/Products.htm |title=About our Products: Silver Coated Cenospheres |publisher=Camouflage.com.au |date= |accessdate=29 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''cenosphere'' is derived from two Greek words, ''κενός'' (''kenos'': hollow, empty) and ''σφαίρα'' (''sphaera'': sphere), literally meaning "hollow sphere."&lt;ref&gt;{{Strong Greek|2756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The process of burning coal in thermal power plants produces [[fly ash]] containing [[ceramic]] particles made largely of [[alumina]] and [[silica]]. They are produced at  temperatures of {{convert|1500 to 1750|C|F}}&lt;!--1,500 to 1,750&amp;nbsp;°C--&gt; through complicated chemical and physical transformation. Their chemical composition and structure varies considerably depending on the composition of coal that generated them.

The ceramic particles in fly ash have three types of structures. The first type of particles are solid and are called '''precipitator'''. The second type of particles are hollow and are called '''cenospheres'''. The third type of particles are called '''plerospheres''', which are hollow particles of large diameter filled with smaller size precipitator and cenospheres. 

==Fuel or oil cenospheres==
The definition of cenosphere has changed over the last 30 years.  Up until the 1990s it was limited to a largely [[carbon]]aceous sphere caused by the oxygen-deficient combustion of a [[liquid fuel]] [[droplet]] that was cooled below {{convert|200|C|F}}&lt;!--200&amp;nbsp;°C--&gt; before it was consumed.  These fuel cenospheres indicated a combustion source using [[fuel injection|injected droplets]] of fuel or the open burning of heavy liquid fuels such as [[asphalt]] or a [[thermoplastic]] material that were bubbling as they burned; the bursting of the bubbles created airborne droplets of fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCrone |first=Walter C. |first2=Ronald G. |last2=Draftz |first3=John Gustav |last3=Delly |title=The Particle Atlas |publisher=Ann Arbor Science Publishers |page=349 |year=1967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hopke |first=Philip K. |title=Receptor Modeling in Environmental Chemistry |publisher=Wiley-Interscience |pages=43–44 |year=1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is still a common definition used in [[environmental microscopy]] to differentiate between the inefficient combustion of liquid fuels and the high temperature fly ash resulting from the efficient combustion of fuels with inorganic contaminants.  Fuel cenospheres are always black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.microlabgallery.com/CenosphereFile.aspx |title=Cenospheres from Diesel Fuel |publisher=Microlabgallery.com |date= |accessdate=29 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The refractory cenosphere as defined above is synonymous with [[microballoon]]s or glass microspheres and excludes the traditional fuel cenospheres definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Brady |editor-first=George S. |editor-first2=Henry R. |editor-last2=Clauser |title=Materials Handbook |edition=Eleventh |publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=490 |year=1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of the term ''cenosphere'' in place of ''microballoons'' is widespread, and it has become an additional definition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2238">'''Chemical classification''' systems attempt to classify [[chemical element|elements]] or [[chemical compound|compounds]] according to certain chemical functional or [[chemical structure|structural]] properties. Whereas the structural properties are largely [[intrinsic]], functional properties and the derived classifications depend to a certain degree on the type of [[chemical interaction]] partners on which the function is exerted. Sometimes other criteria like purely physical ones (e.g. [[molecular weight]]) or - on the other hand - functional properties above the chemical level are also used for building chemical [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]].

Some systems mix the various levels, resulting in hierarchies where the domains are slightly confused, for example having structural and functional aspects end up on the same level. Whereas chemical function is closely dependent on chemical structure, the situation becomes more involved when e.g. [[pharmacological]] function is integrated, because the [[QSAR]] can usually not be directly computed from structural qualities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4160">[[File:Clockwork universe by Tim Wetherell.jpg|thumb|Tim Wetherell's ''Clockwork Universe'' sculpture at [[Questacon]], Canberra, Australia (2009)]]

In the [[history of science]], the '''clockwork universe''' compares the universe to a [[clockwork|mechanical clock]]. It continues ticking along, as a perfect machine, with its gears governed by the [[laws of physics]], making every aspect of the machine predictable.

== History ==

This idea was very popular among [[Deism|deists]]{{ref}} during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when [[Isaac Newton]] derived his [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]], and showed that alongside the law of universal [[gravitation]], they could explain the behaviour of both [[motion (physics)|terrestrial objects]] and the [[solar system]].

A similar concept goes back, to [[Johannes de Sacrobosco|John of Sacrobosco's]] early 13th-century introduction to astronomy: ''[[De sphaera mundi|On the Sphere of the World]]''. In this widely popular medieval text, Sacrobosco spoke of the universe as the ''machina mundi'', the machine of the world, suggesting that the reported eclipse of the Sun at the crucifixion of Jesus was a disturbance of the order of that machine.&lt;ref&gt;John of Sacrbosco, ''On the Sphere'', quoted in Edward Grant, ''A Source Book in Medieval Science,'' (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Pr., 1974), p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to [[Gottfried Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Richard Danielson, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5YOEaO_KO_cC&amp;pg=PA246 The Book of the Cosmos: Imagining the Universe from Heraclitus to Hawking]'', [[Basic Books]], 2001 (p. 246)&lt;/ref&gt; a prominent supporter of the theory, in the [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]], [[Samuel Clarke]] wrote:

:"The Notion of the World's being a great Machine, going on without the Interposition of God, as a Clock continues to go without the Assistance of a Clockmaker; is the Notion of Materialism and Fate, and tends, (under pretence of making God a Supra-mundane Intelligence,) to exclude Providence and God's Government in reality out of the World."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Edward B. 1991. "Newton's rejection of the "Newtonian world view" : the role of divine will in Newton's natural philosophy." Science and Christian Belief 3, no. 2: 103-117. Clarke quotation taken from article.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 artist [[Tim Wetherell]] created a large wall piece for [[Questacon]] (The National Science and Technology centre in Canberra, Australia) representing the concept of the clockwork universe. This steel artwork contains moving gears, a working clock, and a movie of the [[lunar terminator]].

[[File:Dark matter halo.png|thumb|240px|Simulated dark matter halo from a [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[N-body simulation]]]]
A '''dark matter halo''' is a [[Theoretical_physics|theoretical]] component of a [[galaxy]] that envelops the [[galactic disc]] and extends well beyond the edge of the visible galaxy. The halo's [[mass]] dominates the total mass. Thought to consist of [[dark matter]], halos have not been observed directly.  Their existence is inferred through their effects on the motions of [[stars]] and gas in galaxies. Dark matter halos play a key role in current models of [[galaxy formation and evolution]]. The dark matter halo is not fully explained by the presence of massive compact halo objects (MACHOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alcock|first=C|date=10 October 2000|title=The MACHO Project: Microlensing Results from 5.7 Years of Large Magellanic Cloud Observations|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=542|issue=1|pages=281–307|arxiv=astro-ph/0001272|bibcode=2000ApJ...542..281A|doi=10.1086/309512}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alcock|first=C|date=20 September 2000|title=Binary Microlensing Events from the MACHO Project|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=541|issue=1|pages=270–297|arxiv=astro-ph/9907369|bibcode=2000ApJ...541..270A|doi=10.1086/309393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rotation curves as evidence of a dark matter halo==
The presence of dark matter (DM) in the halo is inferred from its [[gravity|gravitational]] effect on a spiral galaxy's [[rotation curve]]. Without large amounts of mass throughout the (roughly spherical) halo, the rotational velocity of the galaxy would decrease at large distances from the galactic center, just as the [[orbital speed]]s of the outer planets decrease with distance from the [[Sun]]. However, [[observational astronomy|observations]] of spiral galaxies, particularly [[radio astronomy|radio observations]] of [[spectral line|line emission]] from neutral atomic [[hydrogen]] (known, in astronomical parlance, as HI), show that the [[galaxy rotation curve|rotation curve]] of most spiral galaxies flattens out, meaning that rotational velocities do not decrease with distance from the galactic center.&lt;ref&gt;Bosma, A. (1978), Phy. D. Thesis, Univ. of Groningen&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of any visible [[matter]] to account for these observations implies either that unobserved ("dark") matter, first proposed by [[Ken Freeman (astronomer)|Ken Freeman]] in 1970, exist, or that the theory of motion under gravity ([[General Relativity]]) is incomplete. Freeman noticed that the expected decline in velocity was not present in NGC 300 nor M33, and considered an undetected mass to explain it. The DM Hypothesis has been reinforced by several studies.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, K.C. (1970), Astrophys. J. 160,881&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, V. C., Ford, W. K. and Thonnard, N. (1980), Astrophys. J. 238,471&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bregman, K. (1987), Ph. Thesis, Univ. Groningen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broeils, A. H. (1992), Astron. Astrophys. J. 256, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation and structure of dark matter halos==

The formation of dark matter halos is believed to have played a major role in the early formation of galaxies. During initial galactic formation, the temperature of the baryonic matter should have still been much too high for it to form gravitationally self-bound objects, thus requiring the prior formation of dark matter structure to add additional gravitational interactions. The current hypothesis for this is based on cold dark matter (CDM) and its formation into structure early in the universe.

The hypothesis for CDM structure formation begins with density perturbations in the Universe that grow linearly until they reach a critical density, after which they would stop expanding and collapse to form gravitationally bound dark matter halos. These halos would continue to grow in mass (and size), either through accretion of material from their immediate neighborhood, or by merging with other halos. Numerical simulations of CDM structure formation have been found to proceed as follows: A small volume with small perturbations initially expands with the expansion of the Universe. As time proceeds, small-scale perturbations grow and collapse to form small halos. At a later stage, these small halos merge to form a single virialized dark matter halo with an ellipsoidal shape, which reveals some substructure in the form of dark matter sub-halos.&lt;ref&gt;Houjun Mo, Frank Van den Bosch, S. White (2010, Galaxy formation and Evolution, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of CDM overcomes issues associated with the normal baryonic matter because it removes most of the thermal and radiative pressures that were preventing the collapse of the baryonic matter. The fact that the dark matter is cold compared to the baryonic matter allows the DM to form these initial, gravitationally bound clumps. Once these subhalos formed, their gravitational interaction with baryonic matter is enough to overcome the thermal energy, and allow it to collapse into the first stars and galaxies. Simulations of this early galaxy formation matches the structure observed by galactic surveys as well as observation of the Cosmic Microwave Background.&lt;ref&gt;Springel, Boker, et el, (2005), Nature, 629, 636&lt;/ref&gt;

===Density profiles===

A commonly used model for galactic dark matter halos is the pseudo-isothermal halo:&lt;ref&gt;Gunn, J. and Gott, J.R. (1972), Astrophys. J. 176.1&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \rho(r) = \rho_o \left[1+\left(\frac{r}{r_c}\right)^2\right]^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho_o&lt;/math&gt; denotes the finite central density and &lt;math&gt;r_c&lt;/math&gt; the core radius. This provides a good fit to most rotation curve data. However, it cannot be a complete description, as the enclosed mass fails to converge to a finite value as the radius tends to infinity. The isothermal model is, at best, an approximation. Many effects may cause deviations from the profile predicted by this simple model. For example, (i) collapse may never reach an equilibrium state in the outer region of a dark matter halo, (ii) non-radial motion may be important, and (iii) mergers associated with the (hierarchical) formation of a halo may render the spherical-collapse model invalid.&lt;ref&gt;Houjun Mo, Frank Van den Bosch, S. White (2010), Galaxy formation and Evolution, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerical simulations of structure formation in an expanding universe lead to the theoretical prediction of the [[Navarro–Frenk–White profile|NFW (Navarro-Frenk-White) profile]]:&lt;ref&gt;Navarro, J. et al. (1997), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997ApJ...490..493N  A Universal Density Profile from Hierarchical Clustering]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\rho(r) = \frac{\rho_{crit} \delta_c}{\left(\frac{r}{r_s}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{r_s}\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r_s&lt;/math&gt; is a scale radius, &lt;math&gt;\delta_c&lt;/math&gt; is a characteristic (dimensionless) density, and &lt;math&gt;\rho_{crit}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;3H^2/8\pi G&lt;/math&gt; is the critical density for closure. The NFW profile is called 'universal' because it works for a large variety of halo masses, spanning four orders of magnitude, from individual galaxies to the halos of galaxy clusters. This profile has a finite gravitational potential even though the integrated mass still diverges logarithmically. It has become conventional to refer to the mass of a halo at a fiducial point that encloses an overdensity 200 times greater than the critical density of the universe, though mathematically the profile extends beyond this notational point. It was later deduced that the density profile depends on the environment, with the NFW appropriate only for isolated halos.&lt;ref&gt;Avila-Reese, V., Firmani, C. and Hernandez, X. (1998), Astrophys. J. 505, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; NFW halos generally provide a worse description of galaxy data than does the pseudo-isothermal profile, leading to the [[cuspy halo problem]].

Higher resolution computer simulations are better described by the [[Einasto profile]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[David Merritt|Merritt, D.]] ''et al.'' (2006), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AJ....132.2685M  Empirical Models for Dark Matter Halos. I. Nonparametric Construction of Density Profiles and Comparison with Parametric Models]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\rho(r) = \rho_e Exp\left[ -d_n \left(\left(\frac{r}{r_c}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}}-1\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where r is the spatial (i.e., not projected) radius. The term &lt;math&gt;d_n&lt;/math&gt; is a function of n such that &lt;math&gt;\rho_e&lt;/math&gt; is the density at the radius &lt;math&gt;r_e&lt;/math&gt; that defines a volume containing half of the total mass. While the addition of a third parameter provides a slightly improved description of the results from numerical simulations, it is not observationally distinguishable from the 2 parameter NFW halo,&lt;ref&gt;[[Stacy McGaugh|McGaugh, S.]] "et al." (2007), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...659..149M The Rotation Velocity Attributable to Dark Matter at Intermediate Radii in Disk Galaxies]&lt;/ref&gt; and does nothing to alleviate the [[cuspy halo problem]].

===Shape===

The collapse of overdensities in the cosmic density field is generally aspherical. So, there is no reason to expect the resulting halos to be spherical. Even the earliest simulations of structure formation in a CDM universe emphasized that the halos are substantially flattened.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, M., Efstathiou, G., Frenk, C. S., White, S. D. M. (1985), ApJ. 292, 371&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent work has shown that halo equidensity surfaces can be described by ellipsoids characterized by the lengths of their axes.&lt;ref&gt;Franx, M., Illingworth, G., de Zeeuw, T. (1991), ApJ., 383, 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of uncertainties in both the data and the model predictions, it is still unclear whether the halo shapes inferred from observations are consistent with the predictions of [[Lambda-CDM model|ΛCDM cosmology]].

===Halo substructure===

Up until the end of the 1990s, numerical simulations of halo formation revealed little substructure. With increasing computing power and better algorithms, it became possible to use greater numbers of particles and obtain better resolution. Substantial amounts of substructure are now expected.&lt;ref&gt;Klypin, A., Gotlöber, S., Kravtsov, A. V., Khokhlov, A. M. (1999), ApJ., 516,530&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diemand, J., Kuhlen, M., Madau, P. (2007), ApJ, 667, 859&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Springel, V., Wang, J., Vogelsberger, M., et al. (2008), MNRAS, 391,1685&lt;/ref&gt; When a small halo merges with a significantly larger halo it becomes a subhalo orbiting within the potential well of its host. As it orbits, it is subjected to strong tidal forces from the host, which cause it to lose mass. In addition the orbit itself evolves as the subhalo is subjected to dynamical friction which causes it to lose energy and angular momentum to the dark matter particles of its host. Whether a subhalo survives as a self-bound entity depends on its mass, density profile, and its orbit.&lt;ref&gt;Houjun Mo, Frank Van den Bosch, S. White (2010), Galaxy formation and Evolution, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Angular momentum===

As originally pointed out by Hoyle&lt;ref&gt;Hoyle, F. (1949), Problems of Cosmical Aerodynamics, Central Air Documents Office, Dayton.&lt;/ref&gt; and first demonstrated using numerical simulations by Efstathiou &amp; Jones,&lt;ref&gt;Efstathiou, G., Jones, B. J. T. (1979), MNRAS, 186, 133&lt;/ref&gt; asymmetric collapse in an expanding universe produces objects with significant angular momentum.

Numerical simulations have shown that the spin parameter distribution for halos formed by dissipation-less hierarchical clustering is well fit by a log-normal distribution, the median and width of which depend only weakly on halo mass, redshift, and cosmology:&lt;ref&gt;Maccio, A. V., Dutton, A. A., van den Bosch, F. C., et al. (2007), MNRAS, 378, 55&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\rho(\lambda)d\lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma_{ln\lambda}} \exp \left[-\frac{\ln\left(\frac{\lambda}{\bar{\lambda}}\right)^2}{2 \sigma^2_{\ln\lambda}}\right] \frac{d\lambda}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\bar{\lambda} \approx 0.035&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ln\lambda} \approx 0.5&lt;/math&gt;. At all halo masses, there is a marked tendency for halos with higher spin to be in denser regions and thus to be more strongly clustered.&lt;ref&gt;Gao, L., White, S. D. M. (2007), MNRAS, 377, L5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Milky Way dark matter halo==
The visible disk of the [[Milky Way|Milky Way Galaxy]] is embedded in a much larger, roughly spherical halo of dark matter.  The dark matter density drops off with distance from the galactic center.  It is now believed that about 95% of the Galaxy is composed of [[dark matter]], a type of matter that does not seem to interact with the rest of the Galaxy's matter and energy in any way except through [[gravity]].  The luminous matter makes up approximately 9 x 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; [[solar mass]]es. The dark matter halo is likely to include around  6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; to 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; [[solar mass]]es of dark matter.&lt;ref&gt;Battaglia et al. (2005), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005MNRAS.364..433B  The radial velocity dispersion profile of the Galactic halo: constraining the density profile of the dark halo of the Milky Way]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kafle2014&gt;{{Cite journal | first1=P.R. | last1=Kafle |  first2=S. | last2=Sharma | first3=G.F. | last3=Lewis |  first4=J. | last4=Bland-Hawthorn | title= On the Shoulders of Giants: Properties of the Stellar Halo and the Milky Way Mass Distribution| journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=794 | issue=1 | date=2014 | pages=17 | doi=10.1088/0004-637X/794/1/59|arxiv = 1408.1787 |bibcode = 2014ApJ...794...59K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Desay Madu Jhyā''' ([[Devanagari]]: देसय मदु झ्या:) is a traditional wooden window in [[Kathmandu]] which is celebrated for its uniqueness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Poudyal|first= Anubhuti |title= Around the corner heritage |url=http://ecs.com.np/heritage/around-the-corner-heritage|accessdate= 8 July 2012
|newspaper=ECS Nepal |date= October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name means "window without equal in the country" in [[Nepal Bhasa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kathmandu.gov.np/Page_Ward+No.+26_41|title= Ward No. 26|publisher= Kathmandu Metropolitan City Office |accessdate=8 July 2012|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The window is set into the facade of a residential house in central Kathmandu.

Desay Madu Jhyā is a specimen of the woodcarving heritage of the [[Newar]] people of [[Nepal]] which goes back more than a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lieberman|first=Marcia R.|title=The Artistry of the Newars|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/09/travel/the-artistry-of-the-newars.html|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher= |date=9 April 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newar architecture is characterised by artistic windows and doors set into bare brick walls. The intricate carvings mostly depict religious motifs, ritual objects, mythical beasts and birds. The level of design and carving of the Newar window reached its peak in the mid-18th century. They are found on palaces, private residences and sacred houses across [[Nepal Mandala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title= Wood Carvings of the Valley: A cut above the others |url= http://www.nepal-traveller.com/index.php?action=article&amp;id=206|accessdate=8 July 2012|newspaper= Nepal Traveller |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lehrman|first=Jonas|title=The Newar Window|url=http://www.artsofasianet.com/back_issues/back_issue.php?action=add_article&amp;article_code_shop=724 |accessdate=|newspaper= Arts of Asia |date=July–August 1984}} Pages 80-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Desay Madu Jhyā is famed for being the only one of its kind. While most traditional windows are [[bay window]]s carved with elaborate details, Desay Madu Jhya is a latticed window with multiple frames. Its design looks like the bellows in an old [[folding camera]].

The unique window is set into a house at Yatkhā, a street to the north of [[Kathmandu Durbar Square]], the old royal palace complex. The street forms part of the ceremonial circuit in the historic section of Kathmandu through which chariot processions and festival parades pass. The window is a tourist attraction and is part of the itinerary on sightseeing tours of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title= Walking Tours: Kathmandu Kaleidoscope |url= http://www.catmando.com/tn/walking_tours.htm |accessdate=8 July 2012|newspaper=Travellers' Nepal |date=24 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National treasure==

Desay Madu Jhyā is more than a century old and has been declared a national treasure. In 1978, the Postal Service Department of the Nepal government issued a postage stamp depicting the window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rajan.com/stamps/st1978.htm |title= Postage Stamps of Nepal|publisher= |accessdate=8 July 2012|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Edinburgh Glasgow Improvement Programme''' or '''EGIP''' is an initiative funded by [[Transport Scotland]] on behalf of the [[Scottish Government]] to increase capacity on the main [[Glasgow to Edinburgh via Falkirk Line|railway line]] between [[Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow]], with new, longer electric trains running by 2017 and full completion in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egip.info |title=EGIP}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected to cost £742 million and will be delivered by [[Network Rail]].

The programme was initially announced by the [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]]-[[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] [[Scottish Executive coalition 2003-2007|coalition government]] in 2006&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/13064417.It_is_surely_time_to_jump-start_electrification_of_our_railways/&lt;/ref&gt;, and was continued, although cut back from the original scheme, by the subsequent [[Scottish National Party]] governments.

== Aims ==
The project will deliver the infrastructure to enable 8 car, electric trains to operate (an increase from the previous 6 car maximum) on Edinburgh - Glasgow services with a fastest journey time of 42 minutes.

The additional train carriages will allow a total increase in capacity of 30%.

It will also deliver electrification of 94 miles of track including diversionary routes through [[Cumbernauld Line|Cumbernauld]] and Falkirk.

== Timeline of planned improvements ==

* July 2018 - first Hitachi [[British Rail Class 385|Class 385 EMUs]] enter service.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-44910925&lt;/ref&gt;
* December 2018 - Platform extensions at [[Glasgow Queen Street railway station|Glasgow Queen Street]].
* December 2018 - Electrification of the Cumbernauld - Falkirk line.
* March 2019 - Glasgow Queen Street redevelopment complete.

== Previous proposals ==
As originally announced in 2006, the project would have cost £1 billion and aimed to increase capacity by increasing service frequency to 6tph rather than by lengthening trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/rail/rail-improvements/EGIP-2014 | title=Rail Electrification Programme - Control Period 5 (2014-19) | work=Transport Scotland | accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transport Scotland commissioned Jacobs to examine the project for potential savings and they identified that the a similar capacity increase could be achieved by increasing train length while maintaining a 4tph frequency. This had previously been thought to be impossible due to restrictions at Glasgow Queen Street station. The redevelopment of [[Buchanan Street|Buchanan Galleries]] allowed this option to be developed instead with a major rebuild and the lengthening of platforms at Queen St high level station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.railengineer.uk/2013/06/04/egip-cutback-or-transformation/ | title=EGIP: cutback or transformation? | work=Rail Engineer | accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This enabled several major schemes to be dropped from the scope of EGIP as they were only required if an increase in train frequency took place:
* Construction of turnback sidings at [[Abbeyhill Junction]] and {{Stnlnk|Croy}}.
* Remodelling of Greenhill Junction to provide a [[Flying junction|non-conflicting junction]];
* Construction of a new chord line at Dalmeny to allow trains from the west to access the Haymarket north lines..

Another proposed scheme the Garngad Chord, near {{Stnlnk|Springburn}} had already been dropped from the scheme. It was intended to allow Glasgow-Cumbernauld services to use the North Clyde Line into Queen Street Low Level, thus freeing up capacity on the High Level station. Instead services started on this route in 2014 with a reversal in Springburn, creating a slightly longer journey time.

Electrification to [[Stirling railway station, Scotland|Stirling]], {{Stnlnk|Alloa}} and {{Stnlnk|Dunblane}} was originally reported to have been dropped as part of the changes to EGIP. Electrification is continuing and is expected to be complete by 2018; it has been carried out under the rolling programme of electrification, rather than as part of the EGIP programme.

== Criticism ==

The new proposals were criticised by business and environmental groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-18690764 | title=Rail journey times to be cut between Glasgow and Edinburgh | work=BBC News | date=4 July 2012 | accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable transport campaign group Transform Scotland described the cuts as 'a major step backwards' and suggested that the government's concurrent decision to bring forward a £3 billion project to dual the A9 road demonstrated a 'perverse set of priorities'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transformscotland.org.uk/scottish-government-egip-announcement.aspx |title=Cuts to key Scottish rail project a major step backwards |work=Transform Scotland |date=4 July 2012 |accessdate=18 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019145345/http://www.transformscotland.org.uk/scottish-government-egip-announcement.aspx |archivedate=19 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-19564702 | title=Minister transport priorities wrong: Transform Scotland | work=BBC News | date=11 September 2012 | accessdate=18 October 2013 | author=Miller, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fastest journey times between Glasgow and Edinburgh under the scheme will now be 42 minutes compared to the just over half an hour previously promised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-25917817 | title=Cost of improving Glasgow to Edinburgh rail line 'up by £90m | work=BBC | date=31 March 2013 | accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most disruptive elements of the project was the complete closure of Glasgow Queen Street (High Level) for a 20-week period between March and August 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dalton|first1=Alistair|title=Four months of major rail disruption ahead at Glasgow Queen Street|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/transport/four-months-of-major-rail-disruption-ahead-at-glasgow-queen-street-1-3998694|website=The Scotsman |date=12 January 2016 |accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow replacement of the track in the Cowlairs Tunnel and the lowering of the track bed to accommodate the installation of overhead electrification equipment in the tunnel. ScotRail warned that the diversion works created a potential [[single point of failure]] which could paralyse Glasgow's rail network in the event of a train failure or other incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A single failure could stop Glasgow trains during Queen Street closure – Verster|url=http://www.railtechnologymagazine.com/Rail-News/a-single-failure-could-stop-glasgow-trains-during-queen-street-closure-verster|website=Railway Technology Magazine |date=10 March 2016 |accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3675">An '''explosive-driven ferromagnetic generator''' ('''EDFMG''', '''explosively pumped ferromagnetic generator''', '''EPFMG''', or '''FMG''') is a compact [[pulsed power]] generator, a device used for generation of short high-[[voltage]] high-[[electric current|current]] pulse by releasing energy stored in a [[permanent magnet]]. It is suited for delivering high-[[electric current|current]] pulses (kiloamperes) to low-[[electrical impedance|impedance]] [[electrical load|loads]].

The FMGs consist of a permanent magnet (usually a [[neodymium magnet]]), a [[high explosive]] charge, and a [[electromagnetic coil|pickup coil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lokiconsult.com/products.html Loki Incorporated - Specialists in Explosives, Propellants and Pyrotechnics]. Lokiconsult.com. Retrieved on 2010-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt; They are a kind of [[phase transition]] generators, utilizing [[pressure-induced magnetic phase transition]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=dti&amp;id=news/EBOMB031109.xml E-Bombs Could Go Mainstream]. Aviation Week (2009-03-11). Retrieved on 2010-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt; By adjusting the number of turns of the coil, which can be as low as a single turn, the generator can be designed for delivery of high-current low-voltage pulses or, with more turns, low-current high-voltage pulses.

The [[shock wave]] generated by explosion destroys the [[magnetic domain]]s in the magnet, cause loss of the [[magnetic field]], and the very sudden change induces a high-peak [[electric current]] in the surrounding coil. Both the shock wave directions parallel to the vector of magnetization (longitudal) and perpendicular (transverse) are possible to be used. One of the possible configurations is a ring magnet with the explosive charge in its center.&lt;ref&gt;S.I. Shkuratov ''et al.'', Loki Incorporated, Rolla, MO 65409, U.S.A.

EDFMGs are especially well suited as seed power sources for [[explosively pumped flux compression generator]]s and can be used for charging capacitor banks.

A generator coupling an EDFMG containing an 8.75&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of magnetic material with a spiral [[vector inversion generator]] yielded a pulse of amplitude over 40 kilovolts with a [[rise time]] of 6.2 nanoseconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1710052&amp;isnumber=36078 Welcome to IEEE Xplore 2.0: Completely Explosive Autonomous High-Voltage Pulsed-Power System Based on Shockwave Ferromagnetic Primary Power Source and Spiral Vector Inversion Generator].

[[File:Milk float, c 1904.jpg|thumb|right|Horse-drawn [[milk float]], c. 1904, with [[dropped axle]]]]

A '''float''' is a form of two-wheeled horse-drawn [[cart]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  |title=All Drawn by Horses
  |author=James Arnold
  |publisher=[[David &amp; Charles]]
  |ref=Arnold, All Drawn by Horses
}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[dropped axle]] to give an especially low loadbed.

They were intended for carrying heavy or unstable items such as [[milk churn]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  |publisher=[[David &amp; Charles]]
  |isbn=0-7153-7151-7
  |year=1976
  |ref=Blandford, Old Farm Tools 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name survives today in that of the [[milkfloat]].

The axle passes beneath the loadbed of the cart but was cranked upwards at each side. This allows the load to be carried low, for stability and ease of loading with heavy objects such as churns or barrels. The high position of the [[stub axle]]s allow large wheels, giving a smooth ride. The box body is open at the rear, with no more than a chain across for safety. Rather than a driving seat or box, they are driven from a standing position, alongside the load. Floats were drawn by a single horse or, especially in Ireland, a donkey.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5700">'''Global Map''' is a set of digital maps that accurately cover the whole globe to express the status of global environment. It is developed through the cooperation of [[National mapping agency|National Geospatial Information Authorities]] (NGIAs) in the world. An initiative to develop Global Map under [[Multilateralism|international cooperation]], the Global Mapping Project, was advocated in 1992 by Ministry of Construction, Japan (MOC) at the time (the current [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (Japan)|Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Japan]]-MLIT).

Global Map is digital [[geospatial information]] in 1&amp;nbsp;km [[Optical resolution|resolution]] which satisfies the following conditions:
# Covering the whole land area of the [[globe]]
# In consistent specifications
# Easily accessible by anyone in marginal cost
The global geospatial information developed as Global Map mainly consists of the following thematic layers:
* [[Transportation]] 
* [[Border|Boundary]] 
* [[Drainage]] 
* Population Centers 
* [[Elevation]] 
* [[Vegetation]] （Percent Tree Cover） 
* [[Land Cover]] 
* [[Land Use]]

== History of the Global Mapping Project ==
Since the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in 1972, global environmental challenges have been recognized as an issue which is common to humankind. “The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the [[Earth Summit]])” in Brazil in 1992 adopted “An action plan of humankind for sustainable development: [[Agenda 21]].” Agenda 21 describes in many parts the importance of information for decision-making to appropriately cope with global environmental challenges. Especially geospatial information is regarded to be critical.

In response to the objectives of Agenda 21 and in recognition of the need for further contribution to the development of geospatial information, the MOC at the time (the current MLIT) advocated, in the same year, the Global Mapping Project, an international cooperation initiative to develop global geospatial information to understand the present status and changes of global environment. This concept was presented at the Fifth United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for the Americas in New York in 1993. At the same time, resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Report of the Fifth United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for the Americas
|format=PDF
|date=January 1993
|publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council
|accessdate=2012-03-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
calling for the promotion of the development of global geospatial data was adopted at this conference. Following this conference, a similar resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/cartog/Asia_and_Pacific/13/ECONF87.3.pdf
|title=Report of the Thirteenth United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for Asia and the Pacific
|format=PDF
|date=May 1994
|publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council
|accessdate=2012-03-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
was adopted at Thirteenth United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for Asia and the Pacific in Beijing in 1994.
 
In 1996, International Steering Committee for Global Mapping (ISCGM), which consists of heads or its equivalents of NGIAs, was established to promote the Global Mapping Project. Thus the mechanism for the international promotion was formed. The [[Geospatial Information Authority of Japan]] (GSI) has been serving as the secretariat of the ISCGM. In the following year, in 1997, which was five years after the Earth Summit, the nineteenth [[United Nations General Assembly#Special sessions|special session of the United Nations General Assembly]] (19th UNGASS) was held. At the paragraph 112 of the resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/spec/aress19-2.htm
|title=Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21
|date=1997-06-28
|publisher=United Nations
|accessdate=2012-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted by the 19th UNGASS, importance of a supportive environment to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection and processing, especially in developing countries, to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues was mentioned along with the description mentioning the significance of international cooperation, including global mapping, as a means to develop the supportive environment.

As a result of such movement, In 1998, a recommendatory letter to participate in the Global Mapping Project was sent from the [[United Nations]] to NGIAs of respective countries in the world.

Further, at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (Johannesburg Summit) held in 2002, global mapping was included in the Plan of Implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''' Goose Island Conservation Park''' is a [[protected area]] in the Australian state of [[South Australia]].   located on [[Goose Island (South Australia)|Goose Island]] and other islets in the vicinity of [[Wardang Island]] in [[Spencer Gulf]].  The constituent islands are located within {{convert|5|km|abbr=off}} to {{convert|12|km|abbr=off}} in the sector between west and north west of [[Port Victoria, South Australia|Port Victoria]].&lt;ref name=mp/&gt;&lt;ref name=gazateer&gt;{{Gazetteer of Australia|name= Goose Island Conservation Park |feature= SA0027023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The conservation park was proclaimed in 1972 to ‘conserve an offshore breeding and refuge area for sea-birds and the [[Australian sea lion]] (Neophoca cinerea).’  The conservation park consists of the following islands: Goose Island, Little Goose Island, Seal Rocks and White Rocks located to the immediate north of Wardang Island with Beatrice Rock, Island Point and Rocky Island all located to the east of Wardang Island, and Boat Rock and Bikini Islets being located on the west side of Wardang Island.&lt;ref name=mp/&gt;  

The conservation park is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category III — Natural Monument or Feature|Category III protected area]].&lt;ref name=CAPAD2012SASum/&gt;

==Non-statutory arrangements==
The Goose Island Conservation Park have been identified by [[BirdLife International]] as an [[Important Bird Area]] because it is considered to support over 1% of the world population of [[black-faced cormorant]]s, holding up to 750 breeding pairs.  It is also a frequently used site for [[fairy tern]]s which have been recorded as breeding there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Important Bird Areas factsheet: Goose Island (Spencer Gulf).|url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sitefactsheet.php?id=23982|publisher=BirdLife International|accessdate=21 October 2014|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hydrant coupler plans.jpg|thumb|right|14KB| a hydrant coupler.]]
A '''hydrant coupler''' is a type of [[aircraft]] fueling equipment which opens and allows [[fuel]] to flow through the hydrant cart into the aircraft. A hydrant coupler needs 60lbs of [[air pressure]] to open up the pit valve to allow the flow of fuel. Hydrant couplers run off a pressure fueling system consisting of fuel and air pressure.

IIPM also claims that it received the Indian Society of Training &amp; Development's 'Innovative Training Practices' award for 2006-07.

IIPM has institutional membership of the Delhi Library Network.&lt;ref&gt;[https://delnet.nic.in/Delnet_PDFs/Annual%20Reports/1997-1998.pdf]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328130829/http://delnet.nic.in/Delnet_PDFs/Annual%20Reports/1997-1998.pdf |date=2012-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IIPM officials, faculty and researchers also undertake participation in seminars at other educational institutions documenting the annual advances in petroleum refining.&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovery.bits-pilani.ac.in/Homepage/disciplines/chemical/seminar.asp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815102109/http://discovery.bits-pilani.ac.in/Homepage/disciplines/chemical/seminar.asp |date=15 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These seminars are not just within India but internationally too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tgfworld.org/participants.html|title=Speakers and Panelists at the International Conference on Lead Poisoning - The George Foundation|publisher=Tgfworld.org|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign collaborations==
IIPM offers a  1-year MBA programme in Petroleum Management in collaboration with the [[International Center for Promotion of Enterprises]] an intergovernmental organization based in [[Ljubljana]] in [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20000829/edu.htm|title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Education Tribune|publisher=Tribuneindia.com|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But IIPM allows only middle-rank officials of Public Sector Undertaking, not just from oil sector companies, to take admission in the programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20031114/career.htm|title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Career Guide|publisher=Tribuneindia.com|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IIPM announced in 2006 that the first pilot batch of 45 students (all employees of Indian Oil Corporation) had graduated in a joint programme with the [[University of British Columbia]], qualifying to receive the 'Hybrid Certificate Programme in Project Management'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120805201438/http://www.u21global.edu.sg/PartnerAdmin/ViewContent?module=NEWSLETTER&amp;oid=157358]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, IIPM planed to train over 1000 of IOC's employees under this programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ioc-execs-to-be-trained-by-u21global_235295.html|title=IOC execs to be trained by U21Global|publisher=Moneycontrol.com|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plug-in Power &amp; Energy Monitor in UK Domestic Mains Socket.jpeg|thumb|right|Prodigit Model 2000MU (UK version), shown in use and displaying a reading of 10 Watts being consumed by the appliance]]
The '''Kill A Watt''' (a [[pun]] on ''[[kilowatt]]'') is an [[electricity]] [[Electricity meter|usage monitor]] manufactured by P3 International.  It measures the energy used by devices plugged directly into the meter, as opposed to [[in-home energy use display]]s, which display the energy used by an entire household.  The [[LCD]] shows voltage; current; true, reactive, and apparent power; power factor (for sinusoidal waveform); energy consumed in kWh; and hours connected.  Some models display estimated cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cost-saving and handy devices|publisher=[[New Straits Times]]|date=2008-05-26|author=Edwin Kee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having a [[NEMA 5-15]] plug and receptacle, and rated for 115&amp;nbsp;VAC (maximum 125Vac),&lt;ref name=p4400&gt;[http://www.p3international.com/products/p4400.html P4400 specification]&lt;/ref&gt; the Kill A Watt is sold for the North American market.  The unit is manufactured by the Taiwanese company Prodigit, which also makes 230&amp;nbsp;Vac models of similar appearance and functionality for European [[Schuko]], U.K. [[BS 1363]] and Australian [[AS 3112]] receptacles, and a model compatible with 100&amp;nbsp;VAC for the Japanese market (2022-04,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prodigit.com/pdf/2022-04.pdf Model 2022-04] Manufacturer's web site.&lt;/ref&gt; marketed there as the Watt Checker [ワットチェッカー] Plus by other companies). The basic models support current up to 15 [[ampere]]s, power up to 1,875&amp;nbsp;VA (the 230Vac equivalents also allow up to 15A, corresponding to 3,750&amp;nbsp;VA).&lt;ref name=p4400/&gt;

The device can give an indication of the [[standby power]] used by appliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gadgets that help save energy|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]]|date=2008-05-04|pages=F02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==
There are several models of Kill A Watt meters:

===P4400===
This is the original, most basic version, based on the Prodigit 2000M.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.prodigit.com/index.php?lang=en&amp;op=product&amp;pro_num=1051 |title=Prodigit 2000M 8-in-1 Plug-in Power Monitor |accessdate=2009-07-16 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the time it is plugged in, it measures:&lt;ref name=p4400/&gt;
* [[Voltage]] ([[Volt]]s)
* [[Electric current|Current]] ([[Ampere]]s)
* [[Electric power|Power]] ([[Watt]]s)
* [[Energy]] Used ([[Kilowatt-hour]]s)
* [[Frequency]] ([[Hertz]])
* [[Apparent power]] ([[Volt-ampere]]s)
* [[Power factor]]
* Elapsed time
The power setting displays instantaneous power, and the kilowatt-hour setting displays energy consumed since last reset.  When electricity is disconnected, the P4400's measurements and meters are reset.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.p3international.com/products/consumer/P4400-CE.html P4400 Kill A Watt] Manufacturer's web site.&lt;/ref&gt;

===P4460 Kill A Watt EZ===
This is an enhanced version, based on the Prodigit 2022,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.prodigit.com/index.php?lang=en&amp;op=product&amp;pro_num=1052 |title=Prodigit 2022 Energy Cost Monitor |accessdate=2009-07-16 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes a backup battery to store measurements even when disconnected from electricity.  It has the same capabilities as the P4400, and can be programmed with electricity cost information, which enables it to display the cost of the electricity consumed since reset.  From this, it can calculate cost per hour, day, week, month, or year.

===P4320 Kill A Watt PS===
This model, based on the Prodigit 2024,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.prodigit.com/index.php?lang=en&amp;op=product&amp;pro_num=1053 |title=Prodigit 2024 8 Port Power Safer |accessdate=2009-07-16 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; is integrated into an eight-outlet [[power strip]].  Unlike the other models, it does not display frequency or apparent power.  It protects against surges and [[Electromagnetic interference|EMI]], has a configurable overcurrent shutdown limit, and also measures earth leakage current; one version acts as an [[earth leakage circuit breaker]] (ELCB).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.p3international.com/products/consumer/p4320.html P4320 Kill A Watt PS] Manufacturer's web site.&lt;/ref&gt;  It switches power on or off at an AC [[zero crossing]], minimizing current surges and interference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prodigit.com/index.php?lang=en&amp;op=faq&amp;id2=3&amp;id=13 Power Safer — New Safety Revolution For Power Strip] Fairly thick [[chinglish]], but informative technical description of the features provided.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
Although identical externally, there have been several different versions of the Kill A Watt and Prodigit equivalents, all essentially of the same design, but with different PCB layout, packaging, and components&lt;ref&gt;[http://reindeerflotilla.wordpress.com/2011/08/23/the-kill-a-watt-not-all-versions-are-created-equal/ The Kill-a-Watt: Not all versions are created equal]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== User modifications ===
One shortcoming of the Kill-a-Watt range of devices is that they do not have the ability to store, transmit or transfer the readings, thus limiting their usage for any ongoing monitoring purposes.  To counter this shortcoming, a couple of openly available modifications have been published on the Web, to enable these devices send data wirelessly to a receiver.

A circuit diagram has been drawn up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://compendiumarcana.com/kaw/kaw3.zip Kill A Watt P4400/P4460 circuit diagram]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tweet-a-watt ====
The Tweet-a-watt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladyada.net/make/tweetawatt/|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a hacked version of the standard Kill-A-Watt Plug in Power Meter. By piggybacking on the device's on-board  LM2902N op-amp chip, the creator was able to get readings for voltage and current and transmit to a computer, which then sent this to Twitter via handle @tweetawatt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/tweetawatt|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time it gained quite a lot of interest on the Web, but interest waned after some time. The last tweet from this handle was in March 2010.

==== WattMote ====
Following the usefulness of the Tweet-a-Watt, designs for the WattMote were released on the Web by another hobbyist, Felix Rusu at LowPowerLab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rusu|first=Felix|title=Meet the WattMote (Moteino based Tweet-A-Watt)|url=http://lowpowerlab.com/blog/2012/12/28/wattmote-moteino-based-wireless-killawatt/|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The modifications use a customized clone of the Arduino chip known as the Moteino, making this version much cheaper, and requires much less soldering than the original design. Further optimizations on the design were done by Mike Tranchemontage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tranchemontagne|first=Mike|title=Moteino Kill-A-Watt: Hardware|url=http://www.mikesmicromania.com/2013/04/moteino-kill-watt-hardware.html|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; his designs featured a more robust power supply unit to the moteino chip, avoid problems capacitors which discharged too slowly with the original design.

====Standby power====
Most plug-in wattmeters are not useful for measuring [[standby power]], also called vampire power if the device in standby is not doing anything useful such as being prepared to wake under timer control.  Many meters only have a resolution of 1W when reading power; the Kill-a-Watts read down to 0.1W, but this is still too coarse for measuring low standby power.  Modification to read standby power has been described and discussed in detail (with [[oscilloscope]] waveforms and measurements).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eevblog.com/forum/projects/measuring-standby-power/ Measuring standby power]&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the meter's shunt [[resistor]], used to generate a voltage proportional to load current, is replaced by a much larger value, typically 100 times larger, with protective diodes.  Readings of the modified meter have to be divided by the resistance factor (e.g. 100), and maximum measurable power is reduced by the same factor.

[[File:AdepsLanaeCrudus-Lanolin.JPG|thumb|Wool fat tin (adeps lanae), at the Centre touristique de la Laine et de la Mode in Verviers, Belgium]]
'''Lanolin''' (from [[Latin]] {{wikt-lang|la|lāna}} ‘wool’, and {{wikt-lang|la|oleum}} ‘oil’), also called '''wool wax''' or '''wool grease''', is a wax secreted by the [[sebaceous gland]]s of [[wool]]-bearing animals. Lanolin used by humans comes from [[domestic sheep]] [[Domestic sheep#Breeds|breeds]] that are raised specifically for their wool. Historically, many [[pharmacopoeia]]s have referred to lanolin as wool fat (''[[adeps]] lanae''); however, as lanolin lacks [[glycerides]] (glycerol esters), it is not a true fat.&lt;ref name=lanolin_book&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lanolin Book |editor-first=Udo |editor-last=Hoppe |publisher=Beiersdorf |location=Hamburg |date=1999 |ISBN=9783931146054}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barnett"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barnett |first=G. |title=Lanolin and Derivatives |journal=Cosmetics &amp; Toiletries |issn=0361-4387 |volume=101 |pages=21–44 |year=1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lanolin primarily consists of [[sterol]] esters instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ullmann| doi = 10.1002/14356007.a09_565.pub2| title = Esters, Organic | last1 = Riemenschneider | first1 = W. | last2 = Bolt | first2 = H. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lanolin's [[waterproofing]] property aids sheep in shedding water from their coats. Certain breeds of sheep produce large amounts of lanolin.

Lanolin's role in nature is to protect wool and skin from climate and the environment; it also plays a role in skin ([[Integumentary system|integumental]]) hygiene.&lt;ref name=lanolin_book/&gt; Lanolin and its derivatives are used in the protection, treatment and [[beautification]] of human skin.&lt;ref name=lanolin_book/&gt;

==Composition==
A typical high-purity grade of lanolin is composed predominantly of [[long chain]] waxy [[ester]]s (approximately 97% by weight) the remainder being lanolin [[alcohol]]s, lanolin [[acid]]s and lanolin [[hydrocarbon]]s.&lt;ref name=lanolin_book/&gt;

An estimated 8,000 to 20,000 different types of lanolin esters are present in lanolin, resulting from combinations between the 200 or so different lanolin acids and the 100 or so different lanolin alcohols identified so far.&lt;ref name=lanolin_book/&gt;&lt;ref name=barnett/&gt;

Lanolin’s complex composition of long-chain esters, hydroxyesters, diesters, lanolin alcohols, and lanolin acids means in addition to it being a valuable product in its own right, it is also the starting point for the production of a whole spectrum of lanolin derivatives, which possess wide-ranging chemical and physical properties. The main [[derivatisation]] routes include [[hydrolysis]], fractional solvent [[crystallisation]], [[esterification]], [[hydrogenation]], [[alkoxylation]] and [[Menshutkin reaction|quaternisation]].&lt;ref name=lanolin_book/&gt;&lt;ref name=barnett/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mw4.m-w.com/medical/quaternizing?show=0&amp;t=1306177224|website=Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary|title=Quaternise|quote=quaternise: to convert (as an amine) into a quaternary compound}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.basf.us/businessdevelopment/bcbdevalkoxylation.html|title=Alkoxylation|publisher=BASF|quote=Reaction of ammonia or amines with [[ethylene oxide]] or [[propylene oxide]] to produce aminoalcohols. The process is also adaptable to produce specialty aminoalcohols from other epoxides.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lanolin derivatives obtained from these processes are used widely in both high-value [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]]s and [[Dermatology|skin treatment]] products.

[[Hydrolysis]] of lanolin yields lanolin alcohols and lanolin acids. Lanolin alcohols are a rich source of [[cholesterol]] (an important skin lipid) and are powerful water-in-oil [[emulsifier]]s; they have been used extensively in skincare products for over 100 years.&lt;ref name=lanolin_book/&gt; Notably, approximately 40% of the acids derived from lanolin are [[alpha-hydroxy acid]]s (AHAs).&lt;ref name=lanolin_book/&gt;&lt;ref name=barnett/&gt; The use of AHAs in skin care products has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years.  Details of the AHAs isolated from lanolin can be seen in the table below.

==Modern developments==
In addition to general purity requirements, lanolin must meet official requirements for the permissible levels of [[pesticide]] residues. The Fifth Supplement of the [[United States Pharmacopoeia]] XXII published in 1992 was the first to specify limits for 34 named [[pesticide]]s. A total limit of 40&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million|ppm]] (i.e. 40&amp;nbsp;mg/kg) total pesticides was stipulated for lanolin of general use, with no individual limit greater than 10&amp;nbsp;ppm.&lt;ref name=lanolin_book/&gt;

A second monograph also introduced into the US Pharmacopoeia XXII in 1992 was entitled ‘Modified Lanolin’. Lanolin conforming to this monograph is intended for use in more exacting applications, for example on open wounds. In this monograph, the limit of total pesticides was reduced to 3&amp;nbsp;ppm total pesticides, with no individual limit greater than 1&amp;nbsp;ppm.

In 2000, the [[European Pharmacopoeia]] introduced pesticide residue limits into its lanolin monograph. This requirement, which is generally regarded as the new quality standard, extends the list of pesticides to 40 and imposes even lower concentration limits.

Some very high-purity grades of lanolin surpass monograph requirements. New products obtained using complex purification techniques produce lanolin esters in their natural state, removing oxidative and environmental impurities resulting in white, odourless, [[hypoallergenic]] lanolin. These ultra-high-purity grades of lanolin are ideally suited to the treatment of dermatological disorders such as [[eczema]] and on open wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arden Jones |first1=M. R. |last2=Steel |first2=I. |last3=Powell |first3=S. M. |journal=British Journal of Dermatology |volume=147 |issue=Suppl. 62 |pages=71 |date=July 2002 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2133.147.s62.19.x  |title=British Contact Dermatitis Group: Summaries of Papers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lanolin attracted attention owing to a misunderstanding concerning its sensitising potential.&lt;ref name="steel"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steel |first=I. |title=Lanolin Allergy: Hype or Hypersensitivity? |journal=Journal of the National Eczema Society (Exchange) |issue=75 |pages=16–17 |date=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study carried out at New York University Hospital in the early 1950s had shown about 1% of patients with dermatological disorders were allergic to the lanolin being used at that time.  By one estimate, this simple misunderstanding of failing to differentiate between the general healthy population and patients with dermatological disorders exaggerates the sensitising potential of lanolin by 5,000–6,000 times.&lt;ref name = steel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Steel |first1=I. |last2=White |first2=I. R. |last3=Beck |first3=M. H. |date=1995 |title=Dilemmas in Lanolin Sensitivity |conference=10th International Symposium on Contact Dermatitis |location=[[Nagoya]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European [[Cosmetics Directive]], introduced in July 1976, contained a stipulation that cosmetics which contained lanolin should be labelled to that effect. This ruling was challenged immediately, and in the early 1980s, it was overturned and removed from the directive. Despite only being in force for a short period of time, this ruling did harm both to the lanolin industry and to the reputation of lanolin in general.&lt;ref name=steel/&gt; The Cosmetics Directive ruling only applied to the presence of lanolin in cosmetic products; it did not apply to the many hundreds of its different uses in dermatological products designed for the treatment of compromised skin conditions.

Modern analytical methods have revealed lanolin possesses a number of important chemical and physical similarities to human [[stratum corneum]] lipids; the [[lipids]] which help regulate the rate of water loss across the [[epidermis]] and govern the hydration state of the skin.&lt;ref name=lanolin_book/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark93Poster"&gt;{{cite report|first1=E. W.|last1=Clark|first2=I.|last2=Steel|title=Poster No.&amp;nbsp;2|publisher=American Academy of Dermatology|location=Washington, DC|date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark93"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=E. W. |last2=Steel |first2=I. |journal=Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=181–195 |date=1993 |title=Investigations into biomechanisms of the moisturizing function of lanolin |url=http://journal.scconline.org/pdf/cc1993/cc044n04/p00181-p00195.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cryogenic]] [[scanning electron microscopy]] has shown that lanolin, like human stratum corneum lipids, consists of a mass of liquid crystalline material. [[Polarized light microscopy|Cross-polarised light microscopy]] has shown the [[lamellar|multilamellar]] [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s formed by lanolin are identical to those formed by human stratum corneum lipids. The incorporation of bound water into the stratum corneum involves the formation of multilamellar vesicles.&lt;ref name=lanolin_book/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clark93/&gt;

Skin bioengineering studies have shown the durational effect of the [[emollient]] (skin smoothing) action produced by lanolin is very significant and lasts for many hours. Lanolin applied to the skin at 2&amp;nbsp;mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; has been shown to reduce roughness by about 35% after one hour and 50% after two hours, with the overall effect lasting for considerably more than eight hours.&lt;ref name=lanolin_book/&gt; Lanolin is also known to form semiocclusive (breathable) films on the skin.&lt;ref name = barnett/&gt;  When applied daily at around 4&amp;nbsp;mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for five consecutive days, the positive moisturising effects of lanolin were detectable until 72&amp;nbsp;hours after final application.&lt;ref name=lanolin_book/&gt; Lanolin may achieve some of its moisturising effects by forming a secondary moisture reservoir within the skin.&lt;ref name=Clark93Poster/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clark93/&gt;

The barrier repair properties of lanolin have been reported to be superior to those produced by both [[Petroleum jelly|petrolatum]] and glycerol.&lt;ref name=lanolin_book/&gt; In a small clinical study conducted on volunteer subjects with terribly dry (xerotic) hands, lanolin was shown to be superior to petrolatum in reducing the signs and symptoms of dryness and scaling, cracks and abrasions, and pain and itch. In another study, a high purity grade of lanolin was found to be significantly superior to petrolatum in assisting the healing of superficial wounds.

==Applications==
[[Image:Lanolinezalf - detail.jpg|thumb|Lanolin ointment]]
Lanolin and its many derivatives are used extensively in both the personal care (e.g., high value cosmetics, facial cosmetics, lip products) and health care sectors such as topical liniments. Lanolin is also found in lubricants, rust-preventive coatings, shoe polish, and other commercial products.&lt;ref name="Zirwas 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=21212847|pmc=3016930|year=2008|author1=Zirwas|first1=M. J.|title=Moisturizer allergy: Diagnosis and management|journal=Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology|volume=1|issue=4|pages=38–44|last2=Stechschulte|first2=S. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lanolin is a relatively common allergen and is often misunderstood as a wool allergy. However, allergy to a lanolin-containing product is difficult to pinpoint and often other products containing lanolin may be fine for use. Patch testing can be done if a lanolin allergy is suspected.&lt;ref name="Zirwas 2008"/&gt;

It is frequently used in protective baby skin treatment and for sore nipples in breastfeeding mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lansinoh.com/products/hpa-lanolin |title=HPA® Lanolin Cream |website=lansinoh.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lanolin is used commercially in many industrial products ranging from [[rust]]proof coatings to [[lubricant]]s. Some sailors use lanolin to create slippery surfaces on their [[propeller]]s and stern gear to which [[barnacles]] cannot adhere. Commercial products (e.g. Lanocote) containing up to 85% lanolin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestowndistributors.com/userportal/pdfs/MSDS/LanoCote/b65f457msds.pdf |title=MSDS for Lanocote |website=www.forespar.com/products/boat-lubricant-lanocote.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; are used to prevent corrosion in marine fasteners, especially when two different metals are in contact with each other and saltwater. The [[water-repellent]] properties make it valuable in many applications as a lubricant grease where [[corrosion]] would otherwise be a problem.

[[7-Dehydrocholesterol]] from lanolin is used as a raw material for producing [[cholecalciferol|vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] by irradiation with ultraviolet light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 17634462| year = 2007| author1 = Holick| first1 = M. F| title = Vitamin D deficiency| journal = New England Journal of Medicine| volume = 357| issue = 3| pages = 266–81| doi = 10.1056/NEJMra070553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baseball player]]s often use it to soften and break in their [[baseball glove]]s ([[shaving cream]] with lanolin is popularly used for this).

Anhydrous liquid lanolin, combined with [[paraben]]s, has been used in trials as [[artificial tears]] to treat [[keratoconjunctivitis sicca|dry eye]].&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=I. J. |last2=Lin |first2=I. C. |last3=Hou |first3=Y. C. |last4=Hu |first4=F. R. |title= A comparison of the effect of carbomer-, cellulose- and mineral oil-based artificial tear formulations |journal=European Journal of Ophthalmology|volume=17 |issue=2|pages= 151–159 |date=2007 |pmid= 17415686}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pucker"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pucker |first1=A. D. |last2=Ng |first2=S. M. |last3=Nichols |first3=J. J. |title= Over the counter (OTC) artificial tear drops for dry eye syndrome |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2 |pages= CD009729 |date=2016 |pmid= 26905373 |pmc= 5045033 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD009729.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Anhydrous lanolin is also used as a lubricant for [[brass instrument]] tuning slides.

Lanolin can also be restored to [[wool]]len garments to make them water and dirt repellent, such as for [[cloth diaper]] covers.

Lanolin is also used in [[lip balm]] products such as [[Carmex]]. For some people, it can irritate the lips.

Lanolin is sometimes used by people on [[continuous positive airway pressure]] therapy to reduce irritation with masks, particular nasal pillow masks that can often create sore spots in the [[nostril]]s.

Lanolin is a popular additive to [[moustache wax]], particularly 'extra-firm' varieties.

Lanolin is used as a primary lubricating component in aerosol-based brass [[lubricant]]s in the ammunition reloading process. Mixed warm 1:12 with highly concentrated [[ethanol]] (usually 99%), the ethanol acts as a carrier which evaporates quickly after application, leaving a fine film of lanolin behind to prevent brass seizing in resizing dies.

Lanolin, when mixed with ingredients such as [[neatsfoot oil]], [[beeswax]] and glycerol, is used in various [[leather]] treatments, for example in some [[saddle soap]]s and in  leather care products.

==Production==
Crude lanolin constitutes about 5–25% of the weight of freshly shorn wool. The wool from one [[Merino sheep]] will produce about 250–300&amp;nbsp;ml of recoverable wool grease. Lanolin is extracted by washing the wool in hot water with a special wool scouring detergent to remove dirt, wool grease (crude lanolin), [[suint]] (sweat salts), and anything else stuck to the wool. The wool grease is continuously removed during this washing process by [[Centrifugation|centrifuge]] separators, which concentrate it into a waxlike substance melting at approximately {{convert|38|°C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sengupta|first=Amit|last2=Behera|date=2014|title=Comprehensive view on chemistry, manufacturing &amp; applications of lanolin extracted from wool pretreatment|url=http://ajer.org/papers/v3(7)/F0373343.pdf|journal=American Journal of Engineering Research (AJER)|volume=Volume-03, Issue-07|pages=33-43|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1153">The '''magnetic diffusivity''' is a parameter in [[plasma physics]] which appears in the [[magnetic Reynolds number]]. It has SI units of m²/s and is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;W. Baumjohann and R. A. Treumann, ''Basic Space Plasma Physics'', Imperial College Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{1}{\mu_0 \sigma_0}&lt;/math&gt;,
while in Gaussian units it can be defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{c^2}{4\pi\sigma_0}&lt;/math&gt;.
In the above, &lt;math&gt;\mu_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vacuum permeability|permeability of free space]], &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light, and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electrical conductivity]] of the material in question. In case of a plasma, this is the conductivity due to [[Coulomb collision|Coulomb]] or neutral collisions: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0=\frac{n_ee^2}{m_e\nu_c}&lt;/math&gt;, where

'''Microlith''' is a brand of [[catalytic]] [[Chemical reactor|reactor]] invented by the prize-winning engineer [[William C. Pfefferle]] and sold by [http://www.precision-combustion.com Precision Combustion]. Microlith's advantages include its weight, size, efficiency, and fast thermal response.

==Technology==

A [[Catalysis|catalyst]] is a substance that speeds a reaction but that itself is left in its original state after the reaction, so that it can assist in the reaction of a large quantity of material over a long period of time. A Microlith reactor is constructed with a very thin metal substrate [[coating|coated]] with a variety of materials including catalysts to speed reactions, and [[adsorption|adsorbent]] materials for use in filters. The substrate has short channels (0.001–0.020&amp;nbsp;in)&lt;ref&gt;Toensmier, Pat. "Redefining Performance." Defense Technology International January 2011: page 77. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; which resemble screens or meshes. This results in a lower [[pressure drop]] than other reactors and allows for high cell density and low [[Heat capacity|thermal mass]]. [[Mass transfer|Mass]] and [[heat transfer]] are significantly increased, allowing faster reactor response to gas temperatures and improved rates of reactant contact with the surface. By passing an electric current through the metal substrate, the Microlith can be [[Joule heating|heated]] rapidly and efficiently.&lt;ref name="spinoff"&gt;"[http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2011/pdf/Spinoff2011.pdf Catalyst Substrates Remove Contaminants, Produce Fuel]."

The {{Nihongo|'''Nunobiki Highlands Wind Farm'''|郡山布引高原風力発電所|Kōriyama Nunobiki Fūryoku-hatsudensho}} is a [[wind farm]] operated by the electric utility company [[J-Power]] alongside [[Lake Inawashiro]] in [[Kōriyama, Fukushima]], Japan. It is approximately 1,080 meters above sea level.{{cn|date=August 2014}}

The wind farm produces 65.98 megawatts of power using a total of 33 type [[Enercon]] E-70, wind turbines, and generates enough power for approximately 35,000 houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/01/21/2142636.htm|title=Japan taps into ocean winds for power - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)|accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility began operating in February 2007. Each wind turbine is about 100 meters high, and each turbine blade is about 30 meters long.

The '''October&amp;nbsp;2015 North American storm complex''' was an [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical storm]] that triggered a high precipitation event, which caused historic [[flash flood]]ing across [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]]. The incipient [[cold front]] traversed the [[Eastern United States]] on September&amp;nbsp;29–30, producing heavy rain in multiple states. The system subsequently stalled just offshore. Tapping into moisture from the nearby [[Hurricane Joaquin]], a developing [[Low-pressure area|surface low]] brought heavy, continuous rain to southeastern States, with the worst effects concentrated in South Carolina where catastrophic flooding occurred. The event culminated in South Carolina on October&amp;nbsp;4 when numerous rivers burst their banks, washing away roads, bridges, vehicles, and homes. Hundreds of people required rescue and the state's emergency management department urged everyone in the state not to travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ben Brumfield, Nick Valencia  |author2=Greg Botelho |lastauthoramp=yes |work=[[CNN]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]|date=October 4, 2015|accessdate=October 4, 2015|title=Flash flood emergencies spread in South Carolina; motorists stranded in water|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/04/us/east-coast-rain-flood/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some areas of the state saw rainfall equivalent to a [[return period|1-in-1000-year event]].

At least 25&amp;nbsp;deaths have been attributed to the weather complex: 19 in South Carolina, 2 in [[New York (state)|New York]], 2 in North Carolina, 1 in [[Florida]], and 1 in [[New Brunswick]]. Damage from the storm reached $2&amp;nbsp;billion dollars.&lt;ref name="billions"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/events|title=Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters: Table of Events|author=|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]|date=2015|accessdate=September 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2493">'''Old field''' is a term used in ecology to describe lands formerly cultivated or grazed but later abandoned. The dominant flora include perennial [[grasses]], [[Ericaceae|heath]]s and [[herbaceous]] plants. Old fields are canonically defined as an intermediate stage found in [[ecological succession]] in an ecosystem advancing towards its [[climax community]], a concept which has been debated by contemporary ecologists for some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233623491_Implications_of_Modern_Successional_Theory_for_Habitat_Typing_A_Review|title=Implications of Modern Successional Theory for Habitat Typing: A Review (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old field sites are often marginal lands with soil quality unsuitable for crops or pasture. Examples include abandoned farmlands in central [[Ontario]], along the edge of the [[Canadian Shield]].

Stress tolerant species with wide seed dispersal ranges are able to colonize cultivated fields after their initial abandonment, usually followed by perennial grasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelemen|first=András|last2=Tóthmérész|first2=Béla|last3=Valkó|first3=Orsolya|last4=Miglécz|first4=Tamás|last5=Deák|first5=Balázs|last6=Török|first6=Péter|date=2017-04-01|title=New aspects of grassland recovery in old-fields revealed by trait-based analyses of perennial-crop-mediated succession|journal=Ecology and Evolution|volume=7|issue=7|pages=2432–2440|doi=10.1002/ece3.2869|pmc=5383495|pmid=28405306}}&lt;/ref&gt; The succession of old fields culminates in takeover by trees and shrubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gill|first=David S.|last2=Marks|first2=P.

Paint is a recyclable item.  Latex paint is collected at collection facilities in many countries and shipped to paint-recycling facilities.

== How paint is recycled ==
There are many ways that [[paint]] can be [[recycling|recycled]].  Most often, the highest quality of latex paint is sorted out and turned back into recycled paint that can be used.  Recycled paint is environmentally preferable to new paint, while still maintaining comparable quality.  In many cases, reusable paints of the same color are pumped into a tank where the material is mixed and tested.  The paint is adjusted with additives and colorants as necessary.  Finally, the paint is fine filtered and packaged for sale.

Paint that cannot be reused has other environmentally friendly uses.  Non-reusable paint can be made into a product used in cement manufacturing, thereby recycling virtually 100% of the original paint.

Recycling one [[gallon]] of paint could save 13 gallons of [[water]], 1 quart of [[oil]], and 250,000 gallons of [[water pollution]], 13.74 pounds of {{co2}}, save enough energy to power the average home for 3 hours, or cook 6 meals in a microwave oven, or blow dry someone's hair 27 times.

===Canada===

In Ontario, [https://archive.is/20150406084832/http://www.stewardshipontario.ca/case-study/loop-recycled-paint/ Stewardship Ontario] oversees the collection of waste paint from consumers and diversion from landfill to meet targets approved by the Ministry of the Environment through a program called the Orange Drop Program. The Orange Drop program is an extensive and growing network of collection sites—drop-off locations for paint leftovers and other special materials that can’t go in the Blue Box or the garbage.
 
As an Orange Drop-approved transporter and processor, [http://www.looppaint.com Loop Recycled Products Inc.] [http://looppaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/loop_photo_butter-3-267x300.jpg] takes leftover paint, collected through Stewardship Ontario, and turns it into 12 shades of premium, affordable and environmentally friendly recycled paint. Reusing top-quality residual paint (on average, the original retail value of a gallon of incoming paint is approximately $30) enables Loop to create premium products without the raw material costs and energy consumption needed to make paint from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stewardshipontario.ca/case-study/loop-recycled-paint/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150406084832/http://www.stewardshipontario.ca/case-study/loop-recycled-paint/ |archivedate=2015-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Since 2012, [http://www.looppaint.com Loop Recycled Products Inc.] has diverted over 6 million litres of paint from disposal in Ontario’s landfills, incineration and waterways and is committed to innovation and solving Canada’s waste paint problem.

In February 2015 [http://wdo.ca/ Waste Diversion Ontario] approved Product Care as the new Ontario waste paint stewardship operator effectively replacing Stewardship Ontario.

In March 2017, [http://www.colortech.info Colortech ECO Paints] introduced its line of recycled wall and floor paints to specific retail markets consisting of a large network of liquidation and discount stores across Canada and the United States., as well as exporting large quantities to West Africa and South America.

Alberta’s paint recycling program started accepting leftover, unwanted paint on April 1, 2008. It is estimated that about 30 million liters of paint is sold in Alberta each year. On average, 5 to 10 percent of this ends up as waste, which can pose environmental and health risks if disposed of improperly. Paint contains many components that have great potential for reuse, recycling and recovery. The Paint Recycling Alberta program enables these products to be handled and recycled in an environmentally safe manner, reducing their impact on the environment.  The program is funded through environmental fees charged on the sale of new paint in Alberta. The fees are put into a dedicated fund that can only be used to manage the paint recycling program. 
 
The paint is sorted into different streams and sent to registered processors to be recycled into new paint, used in other products or in energy recovery, or sent for proper disposal if necessary. Any processor that receives paint must be registered with the Paint Recycling Program and meet all applicable environmental, transportation, health &amp; safety, and local requirements. 

[http://www.recyclepaint.com Calibre Environmental LTD.] (CEL) located in Calgary, Alberta, became a key part in 2008 of the new Alberta Paint Stewardship program which significantly increased the recycling of unused latex paint from across the province of Alberta.  Calibre Environmental Ltd. currently processes about 1.6 million kilograms of latex paint annually, which equates to the successful recycling of one million litres of quality latex paint per year.

===New Zealand===

===United Kingdom===
In the UK reusable leftover paint can be donated to [http://www.communityrepaint.org.uk Community RePaint], a national network of paint reuse schemes. The network comprises local schemes run by not-for-profit organisations, local authorities or waste management companies, in the Community RePaint network. The schemes collect surplus paint from trade sources i.e. painters, decorators, retailers, manufacturers, and/or leftover paint donated by householders at council household waste and recycling centres (also known as tips). The paint is then sorted by staff and volunteers before being redistributed to local charities, community groups, families and individuals in need. The Community RePaint network, is sponsored by [[Dulux]] (part of [[AkzoNobel]]), managed by an environmental consultancy, [http://www.resourcefutures.co.uk Resource Futures] and has been cited as an example of best practice for the management of surplus paint in a report by the European Commission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=European|first=Commission|title=Study on Hazardous Household Waste with a main emphasis on Hazardous Household Chemicals|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/household_report.pdf|publisher=European Commission Directorate - General Environment|accessdate=2011-11-23|author2=Gendebien, A. |author3=Leavens, A. |author4=Blackmore, K. |author5=Godley, A. |author6=Lewin, K. |author7=Franke, B. |author8=Franke, A. |date=July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[DEFRA]] in Guidance on Applying the [[Waste hierarchy|Waste Hierarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Defra|title=Guidance on Applying the Waste Hierarchy|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/publications/files/pb13530-waste-hierarchy-guidance.pdf|publisher=Defra|accessdate=2011-11-23|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are also a handful of companies recycling paint in the UK, but only two reprocessing waste paint, back into the quality of virgin paint; [http://www.newlifepaints.com/ Newlife Paints].  Newlife Paints was formed in 2008 after [http://www.newlifepaints.com/about Keith Harrison], an industrial chemist, developed a process that converted waste emulsion paint back into full quality, commercial grade paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=New Life Paints|title=About Us|url=http://www.newlifepaints.com/about.html|accessdate=2011-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castle RePaint, part of the social enterprise company Castle Furniture also consolidates unwanted emulsion paint into brand new 'RePaint' in a range of colours.

===United States===

Concerns about the life cycle of paint have led to the creation of [http://www.paintcare.org/ PaintCare], a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization established to represent paint manufacturers (paint producers) to plan and operate paint stewardship programs in the United States in those states that pass paint stewardship laws.&lt;ref name="paintcare.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paintcare.org/about/|title=About PaintCare|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Paint stewardship law aims to enable the paint industry to implement a collection program that allows consumers to take their leftover, unwanted paint to a collection site to be collected and recycled. Legislation mandating the creation of the PaintCare program has been enacted in eight states since 2009: Oregon, California, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, Minnesota, Maine, and Colorado. Legislation has also been passed for the District of Columbia; PaintCare anticipates beginning the District's paint stewardship program in September 2016. PaintCare is responsible for promoting the reuse of post-consumer [[architectural paint]] (leftover paint) and providing for the collection, transport, and processing of this paint using the hierarchy of "reduce, reuse, recycle," and proper disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paint.org/publications-resources/issue-backgrounder/aca-paintcare/|title=ACA &amp; PaintCare - American Coatings Association|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most PaintCare locations are at paint retailers who volunteer to take back paint. These retailers take back paint during regular business hours, making paint recycling and disposal much more convenient for the public.&lt;ref name="paintcare.org"/&gt;

Paint is shipped to companies such as [[Amazon Environmental]], [[American Paint Recyclers]] (Ohio), GDB International, Metro Paint (Oregon), UCI Environmental (Nevada) and Kelly Moore, Visions Paint Recycling, Inc (California)&amp; Williams Paint Recycling Company.  In the Southern California area, Acrylatex Coatings &amp; Recycling, Inc. accepts unused/unwanted latex paints for reprocessing into a viable resource of recycled paints in 20-standard colors.  In the southeastern United States Atlanta Paint Disposal has a paint recycling program with drop off locations in Atlanta, Georgia.  In the northeast The Paint Exchange, LLC recycles latex paint under the brand recolor®.

A new charitable organization known as [[The Global Paint for Charity]] incorporated in Georgia, US, has as its mission to collect leftover paint from residents and businesses nationwide and use it for global housing rehabilitation projects, including homes, schools, hospitals, jails and churches for vulnerable families in developing countries. They partner with non-profit organizations with existing operations in these continents for paint distribution. Through the support of their donors and partners they are able to improve communities, increase access to quality paints and protect the environment.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that every homeowner in the US has 3 to 4 gallons of leftover paints in their basement, and 10 percent of those paints ends up in landfills. 

One gallon of improperly disposed paint has the ability to pollute up to 250,000 gallons of water. 

By participating in the program, individuals and businesses will take greater steps to protect the environment, and improve living conditions for vulnerable populations throughout the world. If you would like to support the Global Paint for Charity, they encourage you to take action today.

Improve access of high-quality paints to vulnerable populations around the world. Nearly 2.5 billion people in developing countries live on less than $2 a day. For them, paint is very expensive. In these settings, it is very difficult for families to secure sufficient income for their basic needs (including but not limited to: food, medicine, water, clothes, school supplies, and shelter). When making consumption choices that involve spending on their basic needs there is nothing left to spend on paint. The paint shortage affects many other areas of the world, where communities lack even the most basic need and materials to uplift their people. For the world’s poorest communities, home isn’t just where the heart is. Dirt walls and neglected communities are not attractive to tourists, putting those who cannot afford paint, not only at the greatest risk of life-threatening of bad germs but also lack of economic opportunities.

Since it started years ago, as many as 500–6000 gallons of paint have been shipped at a time to developing countries, including Kenya, Uganda, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Honduras, El Salvador, Guyana, Guinea, Ghana, Jamaica and Mexico, 240 volunteers have painted 459 family homes and 40 schools and orphanages with over 150,000 gallons of donated paint from businesses and residences.

Global Paint for Charity continues to expand and impact our communities around the world. They do this through working directly with their volunteers, donors, and partners. From developing paint projects that engage their employees in the beautification of the community; to run frequent local paint drives to support their program.

Global Paint for Charity has recently won the National Energy Globe Award of United States 2017. With more than 178 participating countries and over 2,000 project submissions annually the Energy Globe Award is today's most prestigious environmental prize worldwide. The Austrian Honorary Consul General, Mr. Ferdinand C. Seefried hosted an exclusive ceremony to present the National Energy Globe Award 2017 for the United States to Mr. Rony Delgarde, Global Paint for Charity.

'''PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) Tbk''' ('''National Gas Company''' in English) is an Indonesian [[natural gas]] transportation and distribution company in [[Indonesia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indonesia-investments.com/doing-business/indonesian-companies/perusahaan-gas-negara/item199
 |title=Indonesia-Investments.com:Perusahaan Gas Negara company profile  |date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. The total length of distribution pipelines of the company is 3,187&amp;nbsp;km that serve around 84 million customers.

==History==
The gas exploitation in Indonesia was managed by a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] private gas company named ''IJN Eindhoven &amp; Co.'', which was established in 1859. The company introduced the use of gas in Indonesia, which was at the time made from coal.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The transfer of power processes occurs at the end of [[World War II]] in August 1945, when [[Japan]] surrendered to the Allies. This opportunity was used by the youth{{clarify|date=November 2016}} and electrical workers (through Electricity and Gas Labour/Employee delegation), which together with the chairman of the Central Indonesian National Committee (KNIP) initiated to meet President [[Sukarno]] for take over the company to the Government of Indonesia.

On 27 October 1945, President Sukarno formed ''Jawatan Listrik dan Gas'' (Bureau of Electricity and Gas) under the Ministry of Public Works and Energy with a power generating capacity of 157.5 MW. In 1958, I.J.N. Eindhoven &amp; Co nationalised and converted into ''PN Gas''.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

On 1 January 1961, the Bureau of Electricity and Gas converted into BPU-PLN (''Badan Pimpinan Umum Perusahaan Listrik Negara'', General Governing Agency of the State Electric Company). The agency, which managed the electricity and gas, then dissolved on 1 January 1965. At the same time, two state-owned companies was initiated: the [[Perusahaan Listrik Negara]] (PLN) as the manager of electric power and Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGN) as the manager of gas. PGN was officially established on 13 May 1965.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Pipelines==
The company owns and operates four transmission pipelines:
*'''Grissik-Duri pipeline''' - &lt;small&gt;operational since 1998, 536&amp;nbsp;km length.&lt;/small&gt;
*'''Grissik-Singapore pipeline''' - &lt;small&gt;operational since 2003, 470&amp;nbsp;km length.&lt;/small&gt;
*'''Medan and Jakarta/Bogor pipeline'''  - &lt;small&gt;operational since 2000, 536&amp;nbsp;km length.&lt;/small&gt;
*'''South Sumatera-West Java pipeline''' - &lt;small&gt;1,116&amp;nbsp;km length.&lt;/small&gt;

In 2011 the company distributed 795 [[MMSCFD]] and transmitted 845 [[MMSCFD]] of [[natural gas]]

Much lower concentrations of radioactive isotopes were released throughout the operational life of the plant from 1952 to 1992, from smaller accidents and from normal operational releases of plutonium particles too small to be [[filtered]]. Prevailing winds from the plant carried airborne contamination south and east, into populated areas northwest of Denver.

The contamination of the Denver area by plutonium from the fires and other sources was not publicly reported until the 1970s. According to a 1972 study coauthored by [[Edward Martell]], "In the more densely populated areas of Denver, the Pu contamination level in surface soils is several times fallout", and the plutonium contamination "just east of the Rocky Flats plant ranges up to hundreds of times that from nuclear tests."&lt;ref name="Poet1972"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poet|first=SE|author2=Martell, EA|date=October 1972|title=Plutonium-239 and americium-241 contamination in the Denver area.|url=http://journals.lww.com/health-physics/Abstract/1972/10000/Plutonium_239_and_Americium_241_Contamination_in.12.aspx|journal=Health Physics|volume=23|issue=4|pages=537–48|doi=10.1097/00004032-197210000-00012|pmid=4634934|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by [[Carl J.

Weapons production at the plant was halted after a combined [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] raid in 1989 and years of protests. The plant has since been shut down, with its buildings demolished and completely removed from the site. The Rocky Flats Plant was declared a [[Superfund]] site in 1989 and began its transformation to a cleanup site in February 1992. Removal of the plant and surface contamination was completed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Nearly all underground contamination was left in place, and measurable radioactive environmental contamination in and around Rocky Flats will probably persist for thousands of years. The land formerly occupied by the plant is now the [[Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge]]. Plans to make this refuge accessible for recreation have been repeatedly delayed due to lack of funding&lt;ref name="FWSmainpage2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/rockyflats/|title=Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge|publisher=U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and protested by citizen organizations.&lt;ref name="Snider2012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_19995436|title=Study: Rocky Flats area still as contaminated with plutonium as 40 years ago|last=Snider|first=Laura|date=2012-02-18|newspaper=DailyCamera|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some residual contamination remains above background levels, environmental data shows these levels are below health-based regulations that would trigger further action. Offsite areas and the lands now comprising the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge were studied as part of the cleanup. The Refuge lands did not require remediation because levels were so low, below action levels. Calculated external radiation doses to an adult or child Refuge visitor in the part of the Refuge with the highest detected levels of plutonium are 0.07 millirems (mrems) per year and 0.2 mrem per year, respectively, based on an assumption of no ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;Rocky Flats Corrective Action Decision/Record of Decision (2006) https://www.lm.doe.gov/Rocky_Flats/Regulations.aspx#CAD&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;Denver Post, July 18, 2018, https://www.denverpost.com/2018/07/19/a-visit-to-rocky-flats-national-wildlife-refuge-carries-little-risk-much-benefit/&lt;/ref&gt; These levels are well below the Colorado Standards for Protection Against Radiation acceptable dose of 25 mrem per year.&lt;ref&gt;6 CCR 1007-1, http://www.sos.state.co.us/CCR/GenerateRulePdf.do?ruleVersionId=7176&amp;fileName=6%20CCR%201007-1%20Part%2004&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, a single medical x-ray can provide a dose of 10 mrem. The average annual radiation dose to an American is about 620 mrem per year from both naturally-occurring and commercial, industrial, and medical sources of radioactivity.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Personal Radiation Dose Calculator, https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/radiation/around-us/calculator.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] continues to monitor the site. Surface water sampling is ongoing and groundwater samples are regularly collected and analyzed. Some private groups and researchers remain concerned about the extent and long-term public health consequences of the contamination.&lt;ref name="DoE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hss.doe.gov/healthsafety/ohre/new/findingaids/epidemiologic/rockyfire/intro.html|title=The September 1957 Rocky Flats fire: A guide to records series of the Department of Energy|publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]]|accessdate=September 3, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327124946/http://www.hss.doe.gov/healthsafety/ohre/new/findingaids/epidemiologic/rockyfire/intro.html|archivedate=March 27, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ENS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/aug2010/2010-08-05-01.html|title=Rocky Flats Nuclear Site Too Hot for Public Access, Citizens Warn|date=August 5, 2010|publisher=[[Environment News Service]]|accessdate=September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hooper2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coloradoindependent.com/95372/invasive-weeds-at-rocky-flats-raise-nuclear-concerns|title=Invasive weeds raise nuclear concerns at Rocky Flats|author=Hooper, Troy|date=August 4, 2011|publisher=[[The Colorado Independent]]|accessdate=September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/journalism/cej/exhibit/1969fire07-04.html|title=1969 Fire Page 7|publisher=Colorado.edu|accessdate=2011-10-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831195803/http://www.colorado.edu/journalism/cej/exhibit/1969fire07-04.html|archivedate=2012-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the public health risk caused by the contamination vary significantly, with accusations that the United States government is being too secretive and that citizen activists are being alarmist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockyflatsfacts.com/2012/04/atomic-obsession-nuclear-alarmism-from-hiroshima-to-al-qaeda/|title=Atomic Obsession: Nuclear Alarmism from Hiroshima to Al-Qaeda|publisher=RockyFlatsFacts.com|accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Comprehensive Risk Assessment for the site found the post-cleanup risks posed by the site to be very low and within EPA guidelines. A 1998 independent study by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment on cancer rates in communities surrounding Rocky Flats also found no pattern of increased cancers tied to Rocky Flats.&lt;ref&gt;Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Cancer Registry, "Ratios of Cancer Incidence in Ten Areas Around Rocky Flats, Colorado" (1998), https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/cdphe-rocky-flats-cancer-study&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, this study was updated with 25 years of additional cancer data; the data supported the same conclusion.

In September 2017, CDPHE's Cancer Registry released a supplement to this study in response to public interest. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/HM_ECSF_2_Rocky-Flats-Cancer-Incidence-Suppl-2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The supplement looked at the incidence of thyroid and all rare cancers in communities around Rocky Flats. Data showed no evidence of higher than expected rates of thryoid cancer. In addition, the overall incidence of all rare cancers was not higher than expected. However, the supplement identified a statistically higher rate of pancreatic cancer in men in Wheat Ridge; the supplement noted that pancreatic cancer has many risk factors associated with it: being overweight or obese, diabetes, a family history of the disease, smoking, and heavy alcohol use. Over 2/3 of these pancreatic cancer cases had a history of smoking and/or alcohol use.

== Background ==
{{main article|Rocky Flats Plant}}
[[File:Rocky Flats Plant Historic District.jpg|thumb|alt=A map bearing the title "Rocky Flats Historic District." An overall map of the main production site and the relatively large surrounding buffer zones is shown in the inset, with most of the image showing a more detailed map of the facility's buildings (about 65 total).|A map of the Rocky Flats Plant prior to its decommissioning. All buildings have since been demolished from the site.]]

The Rocky Flats Plant was located south of [[Boulder, Colorado]] and northwest of [[Denver]]. Originally under management of the [[Dow Chemical Company]], management was transferred to Rockwell in 1975.&lt;ref name=Buffer2003&gt;{{cite book|last=Buffer|first=Patricia|title=Rocky Flats History|year=2003|publisher=Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}} Initially having an area of {{convert|4|sqmi|sqkm|abbr=on}}, the site was expanded with a {{convert|4600|acre|sqkm|abbr=on}} buffer zone in 1972.&lt;ref name=Buffer2003 /&gt;{{rp|12}}

Construction of the first buildings was started on the site on July 10, 1951. Production of parts for nuclear weapons began in 1953. At the time, the precise nature of the work at Rocky Flats was a closely guarded secret. The plant produced [[Thermonuclear weapon|fission cores]] for nuclear weapons, used to "ignite" fusion and [[fissionable]] fuel in all modern nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=Sublette2007&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq4-4.html#Nfaq4.4 |title= Nuclear Weapons FAQ Section 4.4.1.4 The Teller–Ulam Design |author= Carey Sublette |date=July 3, 2007 |work=Nuclear Weapons FAQ |accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fission cores resemble miniaturized versions of the [[Fat Man]] nuclear bomb detonated above [[Nagasaki]].

== Sources of contamination ==
Most of the radioactive contamination from Rocky Flats came from three sources: a catastrophic fire in 1957,&lt;ref name="DoE"/&gt; leaking barrels in an outdoor storage area in 1964-1968, and another less severe fire in 1969.&lt;ref name="VirtualMuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/journalism/cej/exhibit/index.html |title=Rocky Flats Virtual Museum |publisher=[[University of Colorado at Boulder]] |accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutonium]], used to construct the weapons' fissile components, can spontaneously combust at room temperatures in air. Additional sources of actinide contamination include inadequate [[pondcrete]] vitrification attempts and routine releases during the decades of plant operations.

===1957 fire===
[[File:B771 Glove Box after Fire.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A person in an exposure suit and respirator points to a burnt-out glove box.|The glove box where the 1957 fire started.]]
[[File:B771 N 4.jpg|thumb|alt=A large, burnt-out filter plenum.|HEPA filter banks meant to remove microscopic particles of plutonium from the glove box exhaust streams were destroyed by the fire, allowing radioactive smoke to escape the building.]]

On the evening of September 11, 1957, plutonium shavings in a glove box located in building 771 (the Plutonium Recovery and Fabrication Facility) spontaneously ignited. The fire spread to the flammable glove box materials, including [[plexiglas]] windows and rubber gloves. The fire rapidly spread through the interconnected glove boxes and ignited the large bank of [[HEPA|High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)]] filters located in a [[Plenum space|plenum]] downstream. Within minutes the first filters had burned out, allowing plutonium particles to escape from the building exhaust stacks. The building exhaust fans stopped operating due to fire damage at 10:40 PM, which ended the majority of the plutonium release. Fire fighters initially used [[Fire extinguisher#Clean agents and carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide fire extinguishers]] because water can act as a [[Neutron moderator|moderator]] and cause plutonium to go [[Criticality accident|critical]]. They resorted to water hoses when the dry fire extinguishers proved ineffective.&lt;ref name=Cochran1996 /&gt;{{rp|27}}

The 1957 fire released 11-36 [[Curie|Ci]] ({{convert|160|-|510|g|lb|disp=or}}) of plutonium, much of which contaminated off-site areas as microscopic particles entrained in smoke from the fire.&lt;ref name=Till1999 /&gt;{{rp|22–29}} [[Isopleth]] diagrams from studies show portions of the city of Denver included in the area where surface sampling detected plutonium.&lt;ref name="Moore2007"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.rockyflatsnuclearguardianship.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/leroy-moore-papers/dem-public-heath-at-rf-12-10.pdf|title=Ethics of Research on Health Impacts of Nuclear Weapons Activities in the United States|last=Moore|first=LeRoy|publisher=Collaborative Initiative for Research Ethics and Environmental Health (CIREEH) at [[Syracuse University]]|year=2007|editor1-last=Quigley|editor1-first=Dianne|pages=55–97|chapter=Democracy and Public Health at Rocky Flats: The Examples of Edward Martell and Carl J.

===1969 fire===
[[File:Room damaged by 1969 Rocky Flats Fire.jpg|thumb|alt=A narrow, tall room with smoke damage and melted plastic.|A room in building 776 damaged by the 1969 fire.]]

Another major fire occurred on May 11, 1969 in building 776/777 (the Plutonium Processing Facility), again starting due to spontaneous combustion of plutonium shavings in a glove box. Fire fighters again resorted to fighting the fire with water after dry extinguishers proved ineffective. Despite recommendations after the 1957 fire, suppression systems were not built into the glove boxes.&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt;

While the fire bore marked similarities to the 1957 fire,&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt; the level of contamination was less severe because the HEPA filters in the exhaust system did not burn through&lt;ref name=Till1999 /&gt;{{rp|25}} (After the 1957 fire, the filter material was changed from [[cellulose]] to nonflammable [[fiberglass]]).&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt; Had the filters failed or the roof (which sustained heavy fire damage) been breached, the release could have been more severe than the 1957 fire. About {{convert|1400|kg|lb}} of plutonium was in the storage area where the fire occurred, and about {{convert|3400|kg|lb}} total plutonium was in building 776/777.&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt;

The 1969 fire released 13-62 mCi ({{convert|140|-|900|mg|lb|disp=or}}) of plutonium,&lt;ref name=Till1999 /&gt;{{rp|25}} about 1000th as much as was released in the 1957 fire. The 1969 fire, however, led local health officials to perform independent tests of the area surrounding Rocky Flats to determine the extent of the contamination. This resulted in the first releases of information to the public that populated areas southeast of Rocky Flats had been contaminated.&lt;ref name=Moore2007 /&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref name="VirtualMuseum" /&gt;

== Reporting of contamination ==
No radioactivity warning, advisement or cleanup was provided to the public in the 1957 fire, the worse of the two major fires. At the time of the 1957 fire, [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|AEC]] officials told the ''Denver Post'' that the fire "resulted in no spread of radioactive contamination of any consequence."&lt;ref&gt;"Atomic Plant Fire Causes $50,000 Loss," Denver Post, 12 September 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;  The public was not informed of substantial contamination from the 1957 plutonium fire until after the highly visible 1969 fire,&lt;ref name=Moore2007 /&gt;{{rp|3}} when civilian monitoring teams confronted government officials with measurements made outside the plant of radioactive contamination suspected to be from the 1969 fire, which consumed hundreds of pounds of plutonium (850&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite web|last=Campbell|first=Bruce|title=Past DOE Fires/ 1969 Rocky Flats Fire|url=http://www.tvsfpe.org/_images/campbell_-_past_fires.pdf|publisher=Hughes Associates, Inc.|accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1969 fire raised public awareness of potential hazards posed by the plant and led to years of increasing citizen protests and demands for plant closure.

In 2002, the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] surveyed tissues harvested from deer that lived at Rocky Flats for plutonium and other [[actinides]]. Isotopes of plutonium, [[americium]], and [[uranium]] were detected, with the highest measured activity being 0.0125 [[Curie|pCi]]/g (2360 seconds per disintegration) for [[uranium-233]] or [[uranium-234]]. The increased cancer risk, as reported by the study, to an individual who ate {{convert|28|kg|lb}} of Rocky Flats deer meat per year over a 70-year lifetime was estimated to be as high as 1 in 210,000. This is near the conservative end of the EPA's [[acceptable risk]] range.&lt;ref name=Todd2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Todd|first=Andrew S|author2=R.

{{see also|Plutonium in the environment}}
Plutonium-239 and 240 emit [[ionizing radiation]] in the form of [[Alpha particles#Biological effects|alpha particles]].

Following the public 1969 fire, surveys were taken of the land outside the boundaries of Rocky Flats to quantify the amount of plutonium contamination. Researchers noted that plutonium contamination from the plant was present, but did not match the wind conditions of the 1969 fire. The 1957 fire and leaking barrels on Pad 903 have since been confirmed to be the main sources of plutonium contamination. Authors Krey and Hardy estimated the total quantity of plutonium contamination outside of Rocky Flats's boundaries to be 2.6 Ci ({{convert|36|g|lb|disp=or}}),&lt;ref name=Krey1970&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krey|first=P.W.|author2=Hardy, E.P. |title=Plutonium in Soil around the Rocky Flats Plant|journal=United States Atomic Energy Commission Health and Safety Laboratory|date=August 1, 1970|volume=HASL-235}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Poet and Martell estimated the value to be 6.6 Ci ({{convert|92|g|lb|disp=or}}). The study also noted that plutonium levels just outside the boundaries of the plant were hundreds of times higher than the background level caused by global [[nuclear fallout|fallout]] from [[nuclear testing]], and that contamination to the north of the plant was probably caused by normal operations rather than accidental releases.&lt;ref name="Poet1972"/&gt;

From September 1947 to April 1969 there were 5 or more accidental surface water releases of tritium.  Tritium, a radioactive element which was found in scrap material from Rocky Flats, was therefore directed in to the Great Western Reservoir.  This was uncovered in 1973 and following this, urine samples were taken from people living or working near Broomfield who could have drunk water from the reservoir.  The findings of the samples showed that those who were exposed to contaminated water had tritium concentrations near seven times higher than normal (4,300 picocuries per liter versus 600 picocuries per liter).  However, when the same group underwent urine sampling three years later, their tritium concentrations had returned to the standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contaminants Released to Surface Water from Rocky Flats|url=https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/rocky-flats|accessdate=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1981 study by Dr. Carl Johnson, health director for [[Jefferson County, Colorado|Jefferson County]], showed a 45 percent increase in congenital birth defects in Denver suburbs downwind of Rocky Flats compared to the rest of Colorado.  Moreover, he found a 16% increase in cancer rates for those living closest to the plant as compared to those on the outer perimeter of the area, and he estimated 491 excess cancer cases whereas the [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] estimated one. A 1987 study by Crump and others did not find the cancer rates in the northwestern portion of Denver to be significantly higher than other parts of the city and attributed variance in cancer rates to the population density of urban areas.&lt;ref name=Crump1987&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crump|first=KS|author2=Ng, TH |author3=Cuddihy, RG |title=Cancer incidence patterns in the Denver metropolitan area in relation to the Rocky Flats plant.|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|date=July 1987|volume=126|issue=1|pages=127–35|pmid=3591777|url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/126/1/127.long|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crump's conclusions were contested by Johnson in a letter to the journal editor.&lt;ref name=Johnson1987&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Carl|title=Re: "Cancer incidence patterns in the Denver metropolitan area in relation to the Rocky Flats plant".|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|date=July 1987|volume=126|issue=1|pages=153–5|pmid=3591781|url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/126/1/153.extract|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1992 survey of radiation risk analysis, the authors concluded, "Johnson failed to describe an effective and complete model for the cause of the cancers and its relationship to other knowledge as Crump et al. have done.

In 1983, Colorado University Medical School professor John C. Cobb and the [[EPA]] reported plutonium concentrations from about 500 persons who had died in Colorado. A comparison study was done of those who lived near Rocky Flats with those who lived far from this nuclear weapons production site. The ratio of [[Pu-240]] to [[Pu-239]] was "minutely lower" for persons who lived within 50&amp;nbsp;km of Rocky Flats, but was more strongly correlated to age, gender, and smoking habits than proximity to the plant.&lt;ref name=Cobb1983&gt;Cobb et al., "[http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/2000TOR4.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1981+Thru+1985&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D%3A\zyfiles\Index%20Data\81thru85\Txt\00000007\2000TOR4.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h|-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=p|f&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1&amp;SeekPage=x&amp;ZyPURL Plutonium Burdens in People Living Around the Rocky Flats Plant]," March 1983, EPA-600/4-82-069, Springfield, VA: National Technical Information Service&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the Department of Energy's public affairs group published a pamphlet stating that the inhalation of sediments that become resuspended in the air is considered the most significant pathway that could expose human beings to plutonium from the contaminated local reservoirs, but also stated that the airborne plutonium concentrations as measured by downwind air monitors remained below the DOE standard.&lt;ref name=Paukert1991 /&gt; In a 1999 analysis, it was found that "the major event contributing the highest individual risk from plutonium released from Rocky Flats was the 1957 fire," with wind distribution of plutonium from the 903 Pad Storage Area being the next greatest source of health risk. In this analysis, health risk estimates for off-site humans had a variance of four orders of magnitude, from "between 2.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; (95th percentile) and 2.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; (5th percentile), with a median risk estimate of 2.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;."&lt;ref name=Till1999 /&gt; The DOE maintains a list of Rocky Flats epidemiological studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hss.doe.gov/healthsafety/ohre/new/findingaids/epidemiologic/rockyplant/index.html |title=The DOE's Rocky Flats Plant: A Guide to Record Series Useful for Health-Related Research |publisher=Hss.doe.gov |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, a report over 8,000 pages long was released by the Plutonium Working Group Report on Environmental, Safety and Health Vulnerabilities Associated with the Department's Plutonium Storage.  This report listed Rocky Flats as having 5 of the 14 most vulnerable facilities based on plutonium environmental, safety, and health vulnerability at all Department Of Energy facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DOE - Office of Legacy Management-Rocky Flats History|url=http://www.Im.doe.gov/Rocky_Flats/Sites.aspx?view=2|accessdate=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1990s, an independent Health Advisory Panel - appointed by then-Governor Roy Romer - oversaw a series of reports, called the Historical Public Exposure Studies. The 12-member Health Advisory Panel included multiple medical doctors, scientists, PhDs, and local officials. The Rocky Flats Historical Public Exposure Studies involved nine years of research. The Studies had three main objectives: (1) create a public record of plant operations and accidents that contributed to contaminant releases from the Rocky Flats Plant between 1952 and 1989; (2) assess public exposures to contaminants and potential risks from past releases; and, (3) determine the need for future studies. The Studies' research included identification and assessment of chemicals and radioactive materials from past releases; estimates of risk to residents living or working in surrounding communities during the Plant's operation from 1952 to 1989; an evaluation of possible exposure pathways; and, dose assessments for historical releases.&lt;ref&gt;See CDPHE, Rocky Flats Historical Public Exposure Studies, https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/rocky-flats-historical-public-exposure-studies&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Dr. James Ruttenber led a study on the health effects of plutonium.  Conducted by the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, the study concluded that lung cancer is linked to plutonium inhalation.  "We have supporting evidence from other studies that, along with our findings, support the hypothesis that plutonium exposure causes lung cancer," Ruttenber said.  His group's findings were part of a broader study that tracked 16,303 people who worked at the Rocky Flats plant between 1952 and 1989.  Their research also found that these workers were 2.5 times more likely to develop brain tumors than other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Associated Press |url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/041903/nat_0419030043.shtml |title=Plutonium exposure increases lung cancer risk &amp;#124; Lubbock Online &amp;#124; Lubbock Avalanche-Journal |publisher=Lubbock Online |date=April 19, 2003 |accessdate=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many findings linking workers and other cancer development are muddled due to the "strong healthy worker effect" (that workers tend to have lower overall death rates than general population because those that are ill or disabled are restricted from working).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shah|first1=Divying|title=Healthy Worker Effect Phenomenon|journal=Indian Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine|date=2009|volume=77|issue=13.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also the standard mortality rates for cancers of stomach and rectum were found to be much higher than other studies of nuclear workers which indicates the necessity for further study since inhalation of plutonium can distribute to these areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruttenburg Ph.D, MD|first1=A.J.|last2=Schoenbeck|first2=M.|last3=Brown Ph.D.|first3=S|last4=Wells D.V.M.

In February 2006, the Rocky Flats Stewardship Council was formed to address post-closure management of Rocky Flats.  The council includes elected officials from nine municipal governments neighboring Rocky Flats and four skilled/experienced organizations and/or individuals.  Information about the council is available on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rocky Flats Stewardship Council :: Home|url=http://www.rockyflatssc.org/index.html|accessdate=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment announced its Cancer Registry was preparing a follow up cancer study to its original 1998 report on cancer incidence in the vicinity of the former Rocky Flats Plant.&lt;ref&gt;Denver Post, http://www.denverpost.com/2016/12/02/rocky-flats-cancer-study/&lt;/ref&gt; The original report and 2016 report found no pattern of increased cancers in communities around Rocky Flats. In 2017, a follow-up cancer study was conducted by the Cancer Registry, which specifically found no pattern of increased thyroid or rare cancers in communities around Rocky Flats.

Subsequent to reports of environmental crimes being committed at Rocky Flats, the [[United States Department of Justice]] sponsored an [[FBI]] raid dubbed "Operation Desert Glow," which began at 9 a.m. on June 6, 1989.&lt;ref name="Siegel19930808"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-08-08/magazine/tm-21814_1_rocky-flats/4 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Barry | last=Siegel | title=Showdown at Rocky Flats : When Federal Agents Take On a Government Nuclear-Bomb Plant, Lines of Law and Politics Blur, and Moral Responsibility Is Tested | date=1993-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI entered the premises under the ruse of providing a terrorist threat briefing, and served its search warrant to Dominick Sanchini, Rockwell International's manager of Rocky Flats.&lt;ref name="Siegel19930808" /&gt;

The FBI raid led to the formation of Colorado's first [[Grand Jury#Current usage in the United States|special grand jury]], the juried testimony of 110 witnesses, reviews of 2,000 exhibits and ultimately a 1992 plea agreement in which Rockwell admitted to 10 federal environmental crimes and agreed to pay $18.5 million in fines out of its own funds. This amount was less than the company had been paid in bonuses for running the plant as determined by the [[GAO]], and yet was also by far the highest hazardous-waste fine ever; four times larger than the previous record.&lt;ref name="Siegel19930815"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-08-15/magazine/tm-24105_1_rocky-flats-grand-jury/6 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Barry | last=Siegel | title=Showdown at Rocky Flats : The Justice Department had negotiated a Rocky Flats settlement, but the grand jury could not keep quiet about what happened there | date=1993-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to DOE indemnification of its contractors, without some form of settlement being arrived at between the U.S. Justice Department and Rockwell the cost of paying any civil penalties would ultimately have been borne by U.S. taxpayers.

The DOE itself, in a study released in December of the year prior to the FBI raid, called Rocky Flats' ground water the single greatest environmental hazard at any of its nuclear facilities.&lt;ref name="Siegel19930815" /&gt; From the grand jury's report:  "The DOE reached this conclusion because the groundwater contamination was so extensive, toxic, and migrating toward the drinking water supplies for the Cities of Broomfield and Westminster, Colorado."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org/jury/gj/rocky_flats/rocky-flats-grand-jury-report.htm |title=Rocky Flats Grand Jury Report |publisher=Constitution.org |date=January 24, 1992 |accessdate=2013-06-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107032001/http://www.constitution.org/jury/gj/rocky_flats/rocky-flats-grand-jury-report.htm |archivedate=January 7, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[class action lawsuit]], ''Cook v. Rockwell International Corp.'', was filed in January 1990 against Rockwell and Dow Chemical (due to the indemnity of nuclear contractors, the award would have been paid by the federal government). Sixteen years later, the plaintiffs were awarded $926 million in economic damages, punitive damages
In May 2016, U.S. District Judge John L. Kane gave preliminary approval for a $375 million settlement against the Rockwell International Corp. and Dow Chemical Co.  Nearly 26 years later, approximately 13,000 to 15,000 eligible property owners could receive monetary payments for damages and decreased property values.  Property and homeowners who owned property on June 7, 1989, the day the FBI raided the plant, are eligible to file a claim for property devaluation.  The deadline to file a claim is June 1, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aguilar|first1=J|title=Payouts to property owners in long-running Rocky Flats suit should start in 2017|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2016/08/08/rocky-flats-payout-property-owners|accessdate=October 26, 2016|publisher=The Denver Post|date=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl Johnson sued Jefferson County for unlawful termination, after he was forced to resign from his position as Director of the Jefferson County Health Department. He alleged that his termination was due to concerns by the board members that his reports of contamination would lower property values. The suit was settled out of court for $150,000.&lt;ref name="Moore2007" /&gt;{{rp|106–107}}&lt;ref name="Weyler2004"&gt;{{cite book | last = Weyler | first = Rex | title = Greenpeace: How a group of journalists, ecologists and visionaries changed the world | publisher = Rodale Books | location = Emmaus, PA | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1-59486-106-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 2018, local activists sued the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service and filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, asking a federal court to stop the planned opening of Refuge access points. On August 9, 2018, the court denied the activists' motion, explaining that "plaintiffs failed to meet their burden to show that they will likely suffer irreparable harm." In addition, the court later rejected activists' motion to add documents to the administrative record. The court observed that plaintiffs statements in support of this motion were "conclusory." See Civil Action No. 18-cv-01017-PB. The activists had previously sued in 2017. The court dismissed this lawsuit and awarded costs to the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service. In September 2018, Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge opened to the public.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge, https://www.fws.gov/refuge/rocky_flats/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act of 2001, the land transferred from DOE to the US Fish and Wildlife Service was to be used as a wildlife refuge once Rocky Flats cleanup was complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Establishes Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge|url=https://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/pressrel/07-46.htm|accessdate=October 26, 2016|agency=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to help guide the future of Rocky Flats care and management, the Rocky Flats Stewardship Council was formed in 2006 after the US Congress, DOE and previous organization created the new council.  

Cleanup of Rocky Flats was finished in 2005 and verified by the EPA and CDPHE in 2007 after ten years and almost $7 billion.&lt;ref name="stewardship"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockyflatssc.org/index.html |title=Rocky Flats Stewardship Council :: Home |website=Rocky Flats Stewardship Council |accessdate=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, residual contamination below levels of regulatory concern remain. Plutonium 239, with a 24,000 year half life, will persist in the environment hundreds of thousands of years. Volatile organic compounds have a much shorter lifespan. Heavy metals will persist in perpetuity.

In 2006, according to DOE, "The selected remedy/corrective action for the Peripheral OU is no action. The RI/FS report (RCRA Facility Investigation-Remedial Investigation/Corrective Measures Study- Feasibility Study) concludes that the Peripheral OU is already in a state protective of human health and the environment."&lt;ref name=DOE2006&gt;{{cite web|title=Corrective Action Decision/Record of Decision for Rocky Flats Plant (USDOE) POU and COU|url=http://www.lm.doe.gov/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&amp;ItemID=2890| date=September 2006| accessdate=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the "Peripheral Operable Unit" (Peripheral OU) land area of Rocky Flats was transferred from DOE to FWS for use and preservation as the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge. &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, https://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/pressrel/07-46.htm&lt;/ref&gt; During the environmental investigation and sampling, it had been determined that levels of residual contamination were so low, no remediation was required; the Refuge land was already in a state suitable for any use. &lt;ref&gt;Rocky Flats Corrective Action Decision/Record of Decision (2006), https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/rocky-flats-current-condition&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, a statutorily-required review confirmed the Refuge was suitable for any use, prior to its formal opening. &lt;ref&gt;Office of Legacy Management, U.S. Department of Energy, Fourth Five-year Review, https://www.lm.doe.gov/Rocky_Flats/Regulations.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, the DOE-retained "Central Operable Unit" of Rocky Flats remains under DOE control, and is subject to ongoing monitoring and sampling and groundwater treatment. &lt;ref&gt;Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Current Condition of Rocky Flats, https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/rocky-flats-current-condition&lt;/ref&gt; 

Multiple assessments of Rocky Flats indicate that the long-term health risk to citizens living outside the boundaries of Rocky Flats is negligible,&lt;ref name=DOE2006 /&gt;{{rp|30}} but citizen organizations feel that the remediation of the site was inadequate, despite the achievement of legal and regulatory requirements.&lt;ref name="ENS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hooper2011"/&gt; An independent Public Health Assessment, completed by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), concluded that "the available sampling data, epidemiological studies, exposure investigations and other relevant reports paint a consistent picture of the public health implications of environmental contamination": "past, current and future exposures are below levels associated with adverse health effects." &lt;ref&gt;U.S Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, "Public Health Assessment for Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site, U.S. Department of Energy (May 13, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; ATSDR specifically considered children's health when evaluating exposures and their public health implications. Overall, ATSDR did not identify any environmental exposures at levels of public health concern for past and current exposures. Notably, past and current inhalation exposures to site-related air emissions presented no apparent public health hazard.

In March 2006, the Rocky Flats Stewardship Council was formed to address post-closure management of Rocky Flats and provide a forum for public discussion. This organization was the successor organization to the Rocky Flats Coalition of Local Governments, which advocated for stakeholders during the site cleanup. The Council includes elected officials from nine municipal governments neighboring Rocky Flats and four skilled/experienced organizations and/or individuals. Information and Council meetings minutes and reports are available on its website.&lt;ref name="stewardship"/&gt; Members of the public are welcome to attend Council meetings and make public comments.

In 2014, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services proposed a controlled burn on 701 acres of the Wildlife Refuge.  In 2015, they reported that they will postpone those burns until 2017.  In 2015, there was a "soft opening" of the Rocky Flats Wildlife Refuge where small groups of people could reserve space on a three-mile guided nature walk. The Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge opened to the public on September 15, 2018. &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge, https://www.fws.gov/refuge/rocky_flats/&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015 Rocky Mountain Downwinders was founded to study health effects in people who lived east of the facility while it was operational. The group set up an online health survey conducted by Metropolitan State University of Denver.&lt;ref&gt;

== Public opposition ==
{{main article|Anti-nuclear movement}}

On the weekend of April 28, 1979, more than 15,000 people demonstrated against the [[Rocky Flats Plant|Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant]]. The protest was coordinated with other anti-nuclear demonstrations across the country. [[Daniel Ellsberg]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]] were among the 284 people who were arrested. The demonstration followed more than six months of continuous protests that included an attempted blockade of the railroad tracks leading to the site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rlIH-NQbFQgC&amp;pg=PA295&amp;lpg=PA295&amp;dq=atomic+protests+arrests+power&amp;source=web&amp;ots=7R0_4BSy1F&amp;sig=1VLLONdkehSNSOlupuHOhDTFMJY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result Nonviolent Social Movements] p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=263456|title=Rocky Flats Nuclear Plant / Protest - Vanderbilt Television News Archive|website=tvnews.vanderbilt.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StJoseph1979&gt;{{cite news|title=Nearly 300 Protesters Arrested at Rocky Flats|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7gxdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WloNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1250,6267770&amp;dq=rocky+flats+protest&amp;hl=en|accessdate=July 7, 2013|newspaper=St. Joseph Gazette|date=April 30, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large pro-nuclear counter demonstrations were also staged that year.&lt;ref name=Lodi1979&gt;{{cite news|title=Pro-nuclear rally is held|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KH4zAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OTIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6847,6256745&amp;dq=rocky+flats+protest&amp;hl=en|accessdate=July 7, 2013|newspaper=Lodi News-Sentinel|date=August 27, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center was founded with a goal of closing the Rocky Flats plant.&lt;ref&gt;

On October 15, 1983, about 10,000 demonstrators turned out for protest at the Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant (well short of the 21,000 hoped for by protest organizers).

With the establishment of the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act in 2001, a 300&amp;nbsp;ft strip on the eastern edge of the refuge was allocated to Jefferson County for construction of the Jefferson County Parkway.  In May 2008, the Jefferson Parkway Public Highway Authority was established to complete this last portion of the Denver metro beltway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jeffco.us|website=Jefferson County Government Official Website|accessdate=October 26, 2016|location=Jefferson County, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Opponents of the parkway are concerned about the disruption of plutonium laden soil from excavation of the area to build the parkway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Durham|first1=N|title=Toxic Suburbia: Fantastic Rocky Flats vistas, plutonium breezes|url=http://www.coloradoindependent.com/145376/toxic-suburbia-fantastic-rocky-flats-vistas-plutonium-breezes|accessdate=October 26, 2016|publisher=The Colorado Independent|date=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2015, the WestConnect Corridor Coalition was formed with the hopes of bringing about the end of a decades long dispute to the completion of the Jefferson County Parkway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zitzman|first1=A|title=New coalition plans to study completion of 470 loop around metro Denver-7News|url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/new-coalition-plans-to-study-completion-of-470-loop-around-metro-denver|accessdate=October 26, 2016|publisher=7News Denver The Denver Channel|date=April 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by October 2015, the WestConnect Corridor had withdrawn its support from the parkway, determining that the decision to build the parkway should be made outside of the coalition's process.  As of 2015, the Jefferson Parkway Public Authority was still searching for private and public funding to complete the beltway.

A group named Candelas Glows is opposed to a large housing and commercial development planned in the area, which the group calls a "plutonium dust bowl." The Department of Energy responded by saying that studies show more risk from naturally occurring radioactive elements than from very low-level amounts of plutonium remaining around the former plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Rocky Flats site stirs concerns for some neighbors|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/08/former-rocky-flats-site-stirs-concerns-for-some-neighbors|accessdate=October 26, 2016|publisher=The Denver Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candelas Glows argued that a July 2015 radiation report from the Rocky Flats Stewardship Council shows plutonium levels at 1.02 pCi/L, compared to the regulatory standard of 0.15 pCi/L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colorado's Green Housing Development...Adjacent to a Plutonium Burial Site|url=https://candelasglows.com|website=Candelas Glows|accessdate=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rocking stones''' (also known as '''logan stones''' or  '''logans''') are large [[Rock (geology)|stones]] that are so finely balanced that the application of just a small force causes them to rock. Typically, rocking stones are residual corestones formed initially by [[spheroidal weathering]] and have later been exposed by [[erosion]] or [[glacial erratic]]s left by retreating [[glacier]]s.&lt;ref name="NeuendorfOthers2005a"&gt;Neuendorf, K.K.E., J.P.

==Name==

The word "logan" is probably derived from the word "log", which in an English dialect means to rock. In fact, in some parts of the UK, rocking stones or logan stones are called logging stones. The word "log" might be connected with the Danish word ''logre'', which means to "wag a tail".

Some have suggested that the word "logan" comes from a [[Cornish language|Cornish]] expression for the movement that someone makes when inebriated.{{Citation needed|reason=who are these people?|date=April 2014}} [[Davies Gilbert]] writes:
:It may be observed that I have always used the words Loging Rock for the celebrated stone at Trereen Dinas. Much learned research seems to have been idly expended on the supposed name, "Logan Rock."{{ASF|date=April 2014}} To log is a verb in general use throughout Cornwall for vibrating or rolling like a drunken man, and is frequently heard in provincial pronunciation for tug, characteristic of the modem present participle.{{OR|date=April 2014}}  The Loging Rock is, therefore, strictly descriptive of its peculiar motion.

== Examples of rocking stones ==

A massive 90- to 95-ton glacial erratic boulder near [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], Nova Scotia, can still be rocked with a lever, but used to move quite easily, before a band of sailors from the nearby Halifax garrison rocked it into a more stable configuration in the 1890s, and before its base was worn down by excessive rocking in the 1980s and '90s when a park was developed around it at [[Kidston Lake]], in the Spryfield area of the municipality.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}  It used to be a popular picnic destination; in [[Queen Victoria|Victorian]] times, people would travel from Halifax, climb upon it and spread their lunches, while enjoying the sensation of rocking gently while seated upon the huge rock.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Bosistow Logan Rock is at the head of [[Pendower Cove]] (sometimes written as Pendour Cove) near [[Zennor]], Cornwall. It apparently was discovered by an employee of the lord of the local manor whose duty it was to watch the coast. A ship had been wrecked in the cove, and while watching ensuing activity, the employee leaned against a boulder. Suddenly, a gust of wind occurred, and the boulder shifted, or "logged". The longest side of this mass of stone is about {{convert|15|ft|m}}, and the circumference of its biggest end is about {{convert|20|ft|m}}. It is thought to weigh about 20 tons.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

A rocking stone is recorded near the site of Saint Bride's Chapel. The Witch's or Boarstone stands on top of the Craigs of Kyle near Coylton in Ayrshire. It weighs around 30 tons and rests upon two or three stones. A large standing stone known as Wallace's stone is recorded to have stood nearby.&lt;ref name="Paterson"&gt;[[James Paterson (journalist)|Paterson, James]] (1863).

In the parish of [[Carrick, Scotland|North Carrick]] in the [[Straiton|Straiton District]] in [[South Ayrshire]], about a quarter of a mile to the west of the White Laise, and near the March Dyke, a rocking stone named the Logan Stone exists. The Logan Stone is a grey granite rock and rests on greywacke, and can easily be moved with one hand. It is {{convert|4|ft|3|in|m}} by {{convert|4|ft|m}}, by {{convert|3|ft|m}} high.&lt;ref&gt;''Prehistoric Man in Ayrshire'', John Smith of Dalry, 1895&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a famous pair of rocking stones on the [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] island of [[Eysturoy]] in the village of [[Oyndarfjørður]]. These are known as the Rinkusteinar.

Near [[Lugar, East Ayrshire|Lugar]] in the Parish of Auchinleck in Ayrshire, Scotland, is the Lamargle or Lamargee rocking stone in a hollow by the Bello or Bellow Water near its junction with the Glenmore Water from which point the name Lugar Water is applied. It is made of two vertical stones, and a horizontal stone about 6 ft long, 3 ft broad, and 4 ft high. It was regarded as a [[Druid|Druidic]] monument or the grave of a Caledonian hero.&lt;ref name="Currie"&gt;Currie, Robert. ''Rocking stone near Lugar.'' Kilmarnock Glenfield Ramblers Society. Annals. 1904–1907.

==Stones that used to move==

A stone used to rock on a gritstone outcrop on Warley Moor near [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] in West Yorkshire. It had already ceased to rock when described by [[John Watson (antiquary)|John Watson]] in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=13531|title=Rocking Stone|first=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith|last=Map|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayrshire in Southwest Scotland apparently is endowed with a geology that lends itself towards the formation of rocking stones. Several rocking stones, or stones that used to rock at one time, are there.

A rocking stone that some associate with the Druids is on Cuff Hill in [[Hessilhead]], near [[Beith]] in [[North Ayrshire]]. It no longer rocks due to people digging beneath to ascertain its fulcrum.&lt;ref&gt;''Topographical Description of Ayrshire; more Particularly of Cunninghame: together with a Genealogical account of the Principal families in that Bailiwick.'', George Robertson, Cunninghame Press, Irvine, 1820&lt;/ref&gt; It is in a small wood and surrounded by a circular drystone wall. An article was published in the ''Cumnock Chronicle'' in 1907 on the reason for the stone being dislodged.

The Ogrestone or [[Thurgartstone]] near [[Corsehill, Lainshaw, Robertland and Dunlop|Dunlop]] in [[East Ayrshire]] is thought to have been a rocking stone. However, soil has built up around the base of the Thurgatstone over the years, which now prevents any rocking motion.

A rocking stone existed in 1913–1919 at Sannox on Arran, on a nearly horizontal platform next to the seashore.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;Allen, Charles A. ''Arran: Its Charm &amp; Beauty.'' Kilmarncok Glenfield Ramblers Society. Annals. 1904 – 1907. facing P. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lamagee or Lamargle stone in Lugar as previously mentioned is in the center of a loose collection of stones in the village of [[Lugar, East Ayrshire|Lugar]] in East Ayrshire. The Lamargle stone rests on two stones. Local legend has it that the Lamargle stone used to rock, but it no longer does. The Witch's Stone or Boarstone on the Craigs o'Kyle is recorded by the author John Smith as having rocked.

The Clochoderick Stone near [[Howwood]] and [[Kilbarchan]] in [[Renfrewshire]] used to rock, and it is said that the Druids used it to judge people. The accused was made to sit on the stone and by the way it moved, the Druids judged the innocence or guilt of the individual. It is also said to be the burial place of [[Rhydderch Hael]], King of Strathclyde, who was the victor at the Battle of Arderydd near Arthuret in the Borders. His victory brought Christianity to Strathclyde. This stone is very unusual and is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|SSSI]] for Geology in its own right.

==Dislodged rocking stones==
Often wear, erosion, or human intervention has resulted in the dislodging of rocking stones.

===Devon===
A well-known rocking stone or logan stone was located at [[Sharpitor]] near [[Lustleigh]] on [[Dartmoor]]. It was also called the Nutcrackers Stone, sometimes seen on [[Ordnance Survey]] maps. The huge stone once lay overhanging Lustleigh Cleave until 1951, when vandals pushed the stone down the valley. A failed attempt to rescue the stone by pulling it back up the valley resulted in it breaking into pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Weir John and Le Messurier 1988, Great Walks: Dartmoor &amp; Exmoor&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1900 there were rocking stones at [[Rippon tor]], and [[Sittaford tor]] on Dartmoor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia]] Vol X, 1922. p6659 Rocking Stone&lt;/ref&gt;

===Larchmont, New York===
A 150-ton glacial erratic occurs on Rockingstone Avenue in Larchmont, New York, that was so perfectly balanced that just a small touch would allow it to rock back and forth.  Unfortunately in the 1920s, blasting for a new sewer system in the neighbourhood dislodged the rock, so it no longer balances.

===Pembrokeshire===
A rocking stone in [[Pembrokeshire]] is described in [[Edmund Gibson|Gibson]]’s edition of [[William Camden|Camden's ''Britannia'']], from a manuscript account by [[George Owen of Henllys|George Owen]]:

:"This shaking stone may be seen on a sea-cliff within half a mile of St. David's. It is so vast that I presume it may exceed the draught of an hundred oxen, and it is altogether rude and unpolished. The occasion of the name (Y maen sigl, or the Rocking-stone) is for that being mounted upon divers other stones about a yard in height it is so equally poised that a man may shake it with one finger so that five or six men sitting on it shall perceive themselves moved thereby."

[[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]’s soldiers rendered the rocking stone of Pembrokeshire immovable after Mr. Owen had described it. They reportedly destroyed it because they felt it encouraged superstition.

===Golcar Hill===
Another rocking stone was at [[Golcar Hill]], near [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] in Yorkshire. However, the Golcar Hill rocking stone will no longer easily rock because some masons wanted to find out how such a large weight could move so easily, so they chopped at it until they destroyed its balance.

===Men Amber===
A very sensitive rocking stone called [[Men Amber]] (sometimes written as Men-Amber or Menamber) was on a high ridge in the parish of [[Sithney]], near [[Pendennis]], Cornwall. It is {{convert|11|ft|m}} long, {{convert|4|ft|m}} deep, and {{convert|6|ft|m}} wide. It was toppled by [[Shrubsall]], the governor of Pendennis, and his men about 1650 during Cromwell’s Commonwealth. One rumoured motivation for the dislodging was a purported prophecy of [[Merlin]], who supposedly said that Men Amber would stand until England had no king.

[[William Stukeley|Rev. Dr. William Stukeley]] wrote:

:Main Ambres; petrae ambrosiae, signify the stones anointed with holy oil, consecrated; or in a general sense, a temple, altar or places or worship

[[William Borlase]] in his 1754 book ''Antiquities of Cornwall'', claimed that Men Amber was dislodged because:

:the vulgar used to resort to this place at particular times of the year, and paid to this rock more respect than was thought becoming to good Christians.

===Logan Rock===
{{main|Logan Rock}}
[[Image:Logan Rock Treen closeup.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Logan Rock]] at Trereen Dinas]]
Another well-known example of a rocking or logan stone is [[Logan Rock]] of [[Treen (St Levan)|Treen]] in Cornwall. This huge stone weighs about 80 or 90 tons. It is one of the best-known rocking stones for several reasons. For example, Modred, in [[William Mason (poet)|William Mason]]'s dramatic poem "[[Caractacus]]" addressing the characters Vellinus and Elidurus, says of the Logan Rock:

:::''Thither, youths,''
:::''Turn your astonish'd eyes; behold yon huge''
:::''And unhewn sphere of living adamant,''
:::''Which, poised by magic, rests its central weight''
:::''On yonder pointed rock: firm as it seems,''
:::''Such is the strange and virtuous property,''
:::''It moves obsequious to the gentlest touch''
:::''Of him whose breast is pure; but to a traitor,''
:::''Tho’ ev’n a giant’s prowess nerv’d his arm,''
:::''It stands as fixt as Snowdon.''

However, another reason that the Logan Rock of Treen is remembered is that it was the center of a famous drama. In April 1824, Lieutenant Hugh Goldsmith, R. N. (nephew of the famous poet [[Oliver Goldsmith]]), and 10 or 12 of his crew of the cutter HMS ''Nimble'', armed with bars and levers, rocked the huge granite boulder until it fell from its cliff-top perch. Goldsmith was apparently motivated to disprove the claim of [[William Borlase|Dr. Borlase]], who wrote in ''Antiquities of Cornwall'' in 1754 that:

:In the parish of S. Levan, there is a promontory called Castle Treryn. This cape consists of three distinct groups of rocks. On the western side of the middle group near the top, lies a very large stone, so evenly, poised that any hand may move it to and fro; but the extremeties of its base are at such a distance from each other, and so well secured by their nearness to the stone which it stretches itself upon, that it is morally impossible that any lever, or indeed force, however applied in a mechanical way, can remove it from its present situation.
[[Image:Logan rock on headland.jpg|right|400px|thumb|The Logan Rock (circled) seen from Pednvounder beach]]
Goldsmith was determined to demonstrate that nothing was impossible when the courage and skill of British seamen were engaged. The Logan Rock fell and was caught in a narrow chasm.

This upset the local residents considerably, since Logan Rock had been used to draw tourists to the area. [[Sir Richard Vyvyan, 8th Baronet|Sir Richard Vyvyan]] (1800–1879)&lt;ref&gt;''101 Cornish Lives'', Maurice Smelt, {{ISBN|0-906720-50-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; was particularly unhappy.  They demanded that the British Admiralty strip Lieutenant Goldsmith of his Royal Navy commission unless he restored the boulder to its previous position at his own expense. However, Mr. [[Davies Gilbert]] persuaded the Lords of the Admiralty to lend Lieutenant Goldsmith the required apparatus for replacing the Logan Rock. The Admiralty sent 13 captains with blocks and chains from the dock yard at [[Plymouth]], and contributed £25 towards expenses. Gilbert also raised more funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/prwe/prwe066.htm|title=Popular Romances of the West of England: Romances of the Rocks: The Logan or Loging Rock|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Logan Rock from below.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Logan Rock]] (top right) in context]]
After months of effort, at 4:20 pm on 2 November 1824, in front of thousands of spectators and with the help of more than 60 men and block and tackle, the Logan Rock was finally repositioned and returned to "rocking condition".&lt;ref&gt;Michell, John (1974). The Old Stones of Land's End. Garnstone Press. {{ISBN|0-85511-370-7}}. P. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently, the total final cost of this enterprise was £130 8s 6d. However, it is not clear how much of the remaining £105 Goldsmith had to make up out of his own pocket.

For some time after, the rock was kept chained and padlocked, but eventually these restrictions were removed, and the rock was set free. However, it apparently no longer vibrates or "logs" as easily as it did before.

Tourism dropped, and this was blamed on the condition of Logan Rock. For a while, Treen was nicknamed 'Goldsmith's [[The Deserted Village|Deserted Village]]'.

Another famous rock structure, [[Lanyon Cromlech]], was knocked down during a thunderstorm in 1815. The same machinery that was used to restore the Logan Rock in Treen was successful in repositioning Lanyon Cromlech.

==Beliefs==
[[File:ormerockingstone.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Rocking Stone 'Maen Sigl' Great Orme Llandudno]]

A wide variety of beliefs are associated with rocking stones. Because of their strange nature, rocking stones were sometimes associated with [[witchcraft]], or [[Druid|Druids]].

The rocking stone near [[Nancledra|Nancledrea]] in Cornwall was said to only move at midnight when witches were out. People claimed that if one touched the rocking stone nine times at midnight, one would turn into a witch.

The Brimham rocking stone in [[Yorkshire]] is said to rock only for the efforts of an honest man.&lt;ref&gt;Hippisley Coxe, Antony D. (1973). Haunted Britain. Pub. Hutchinson. {{ISBN|0-09-116540-7}}. P. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rocking stone at [[Land's End]] was said to have been placed there by a giant who used it to rock himself to sleep.

It was claimed that the [[Logan Rock|Logan Stone]] in Treen could cure childhood diseases. The children were rocked on the Logan Stone in certain seasons. People say that the charm was broken when Lieutenant Goldsmith dislodged the Logan Stone.

It is a Cornish tradition to make a vow and then attempt to move a rocking stone, or logan rock. It was said that no persons with treachery in their hearts could make a rocking stone move.

The '''Scaphe''' ({{lang-grc|σκάφη|scaphe|bowl}}) was a [[sundial]] said to have been invented by [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]] (3rd century BC). There are no original works still in existence by Aristarchus, but the adjacent image is an accurate image of what it might have looked like, only his would have been made of stone. It consisted of a hemispherical bowl which had a vertical [[gnomon]] placed inside it, with the top of the gnomon level with the edge of the bowl. Twelve gradations inscribed perpendicular to the hemisphere indicated the hour of the day. Using this measuring instrument, [[Eratosthenes|Eratosthenes of Cyrene]] (c. 220 BC) measured the length of [[meridian arc|Earth's meridian arc]].
The scaphe is also known as a skaphe, scaphion (diminutive) or {{lang-la|scaphium}}.

== Inventor ==
[[File:Portrait of Eratosthenes.png|150px|right|"Eratosthenes "]]
[[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]] of [[Samos]] ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|r|ə|ˈ|s|t|ɑr|k|ə|s}}; {{lang|grc|Ἀρίσταρχος}}, ''Aristarkhos''; c. 310 – c. 230 BC) was an ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[astronomer]] and [[mathematician]] who presented the first known model that placed the [[Sun]] at the center of the known universe with the [[Earth]] revolving around it (see [[Solar system]]).  He was influenced by [[Philolaus|Philolaus of Croton]], but he identified the "central fire" with the Sun, and put the other planets in their correct order of distance around the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Draper, John William "[[History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science]]" in Joshi, S.

==History ==

Greeks and Romans used large stone sundials based on "a partial sphere or scaphe,” the shadow of the tip of the [[gnomon]] was the time-telling index.&lt;ref name="Mills, Allan A. Seasonal-Hour Sundials on Vertical and Horizontal Planes, with an Explanation of the Scratch Dial in Annals of Science, 50 83–93"&gt;{{cite news|author=Mills, Allan A. "Seasonal-Hour Sundials on Vertical and Horizontal Planes, with an Explanation of the Scratch Dial" in Annals of Science, 50 |first=1993|title=History of Science, Technology &amp; Medicine|pages=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; These dials could in theory tell time accurately if carved to a true sphere and correctly calibrated for a given site.
[[File:Sundial from Madain Saleh.JPG|250px|right|Sundial from Madain Saleh]]

It took a skilled stone worker and a great deal of time and money to create a sundial. So only wealthy citizens could afford this elaborate contraption, and it was often for their villas or as donations for erection in the town forum.
There was a need for cheaper dials that ordinary laborer could construct. But even if it were easier to make the question of calibrating the Scaphe still posed a problem.

The problem of projecting the three- dimensional scaphe dial upon a vertical or horizontal plane, was addressed by a number of distinguished nineteenth-century mathematicians, each of whom presumably solved it to his own personal satisfaction. Unfortunately, their publications are so complex, long-winded, and obscure that they were virtually inaccessible to antiquaries and—it would appear from the replication of effort----even to their own (unacknowledged) colleagues.&lt;ref name="Mills, Allan A. Seasonal-Hour Sundials on Vertical and Horizontal Planes, with an Explanation of the Scratch Dial in Annals of Science, 50 83–93"/&gt; The spherical trigonometry required for the latter endeavor is really quite basic, and the calculations tedious rather than difficult. The availability of computer-generated graphics has, of course, completely altered the situation. A Fortran program was written for the [[VAX]] computer at the [[University of Leicester]] that enabled vertical or horizontal dials to be plotted for any latitude.&lt;ref name="Mills, Allan A.

=== Measurement of the Earth's circumference ===
{{main|Earth's circumference}}
Made famous by [[Eratosthenes|Eratosthenes of Cyrene]], he calculated the [[circumference]] of the [[Earth]] without leaving Egypt. Eratosthenes knew that at [[Noon#Solar noon|local noon]] on the summer solstice in the Ancient Egyptian city of [[Swenet]] (known in ancient Greek as Syene, and now as Aswan) on the [[Tropic of Cancer]], the sun would appear at the [[zenith]], directly overhead. He knew this because he had been told that the shadow of someone looking down a deep well in Syene would block the reflection of the Sun at noon off the water at the bottom of the well. Using a [[gnomon]], he measured the sun's angle of elevation at noon on the solstice in Alexandria, and found it to be 1/50th of a circle (7°12') south of the [[zenith]]. He may have used a compass to measure the angle of the shadow cast by the sun.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;[http://todaslascosasdeanthony.com/2012/07/03/eratosthenes-earth-circumference/ How did Eratosthenes measure the circumference of the earth?]&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming that the Earth was spherical, and that Alexandria was due north of Syene, he concluded that the [[meridian arc]] distance from Alexandria to Syene must therefore be 1/50th of a circle's circumference, or 7°12'/360°.

His knowledge of the size of Egypt after many generations of [[surveying]] trips for the Pharaonic bookkeepers gave a distance between Alexandria and Syene of 5,000 [[Stadion (unit of length)|stadia]]. This distance was corroborated by inquiring about the time that it took to travel from Syene to Alexandria by camel. He rounded the result to a final value of 700 stadia per degree, which implies a circumference of 252,000 stadia. Some claim Eratosthenes used the Egyptian stade of 157.5 meters, which would imply a circumference of 39,690&amp;nbsp;km, an error of 1.6%, but the 185 meter Attic stade is the most commonly accepted value for the length of the stade used by Eratosthenes in his measurements of the Earth,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/publications/periodicals/convergence/eratosthenes-and-the-mystery-of-the-stades-how-long-is-a-stade Eratosthenes and the Mystery of the Stades - How Long Is a Stade?]&lt;/ref&gt; which implies a circumference of 46,620&amp;nbsp;km, an error of 16.3%.

'''Sealant''' is a substance used to block the passage of [[fluid]]s through the surface or joints or openings in materials,&lt;ref&gt;"Sealant", ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; a type of [[Seal (mechanical)|mechanical seal]]. In building construction ''sealant'' is sometimes synonymous with ''[[caulking]]'' and also serve the purposes of blocking dust, sound and heat transmission. Sealants may be weak or strong, flexible or rigid, permanent or temporary. Sealants are not [[adhesive]]s but some have adhesive qualities and are called ''adhesive-sealants'' or ''structural sealants''.

==History==
Sealants were first used in prehistory in the broadest sense as mud, grass and reeds to seal dwellings from the weather&lt;ref name="HST"&gt;Klososki, J. M. and A. T. Wolf, "The History of Sealants". ''Handbook of Sealant Technology''. Mittal, K. L., and A. Pizzi, eds., Boca Raton: CRC, 2009. 4. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; such as the daub in [[wattle and daub]] and [[thatching]]. Natural sealants and adhesive-sealants included plant [[resin]]s such as pine pitch and [[birch pitch]], [[bitumen]], [[wax]], [[tar]], [[natural gum]], clay (mud) mortar, [[lime mortar]], [[lead]], blood and egg. In the 17th century glazing [[putty]] was first used to seal window glass made with linseed oil and chalk, later other [[drying oil]]s were also used to make oil-based putties which were often referred to as ''caulks''. In the 1920s [[polymer]]s such as [[acrylic polymer]]s, [[butyl]] polymers and silicone polymers were first developed and used in sealants. By the 1960s synthetic-polymer-based sealants were widely available.&lt;ref name="HST"/&gt;

==Function==
Sealants, despite not having great strength, convey a number of properties. They seal top structures to the substrate, and are particularly effective in [[waterproofing]] processes by keeping moisture out (or in) the components in which they are used.  They can provide thermal and acoustical insulation, and may serve as fire barriers.  They may have electrical properties, as well.  Sealants can also be used for simple smoothing or filling.  They are often called upon to perform several of these functions at once.

A caulking sealant has three basic functions: It fills a gap between two or more substrates; it forms a barrier through the physical properties of the sealant itself and by adhesion to the substrate; and, it maintains sealing properties for the expected lifetime, service conditions, and environments.  The sealant performs these functions by way of correct formulation to achieve specific application and performance properties.  Other than adhesives, however, there are few functional alternatives to the sealing process.  [[Soldering]] or [[welding]] can perhaps be used as alternatives in certain instances, depending on the substrates and the relative movement that the substrates will see in service.  However, the simplicity and reliability offered by organic elastomers usually make them the clear choice for performing these functions.

== Types of sealants ==
A sealant may be viscous material that has little or no flow characteristics and which stay where they are applied; or they can be thin and runny so as to allow it to penetrate the substrate by means of capillary action.  Anaerobic acrylic sealants (generally referred to as impregnants) are the most desirable, as they are required to cure in the absence of air, unlike surface sealants that require air as part of the cure mechanism that changes state to become solid, once applied, and is used to prevent the penetration of air, gas, noise, dust, fire, smoke, or liquid from one location through a barrier into another.  Typically, sealants are used to close small openings that are difficult to shut with other materials, such as [[concrete]], [[drywall]], etc.  Desirable properties of sealants include insolubility, [[corrosion]] resistance, and [[adhesion]]. Uses of sealants vary widely and sealants are used in many industries, for example, [[construction]], automotive and aerospace industries.
Sealants can be categorized in accordance with varying criteria, e. g. in accordance with the reactivity of the product in the ready-to-use condition or on the basis of its mechanical behavior after installation.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Pröbster, Industrial Sealants - Fundamentals, selection and applications, Verlag Moderne Industrie 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
Often the intended use or the chemical basis is used to classify sealants, too. A typical classification system for most commonly used sealants is shown below.
[[File:Classification of sealants by reactivity and chemistry.png|800x479px|thumb|none|Classification of sealants by reactivity and chemistry]]

Types of sealants fall between the higher-strength, adhesive-derived sealers and [[coating]]s at one end, and extremely low-strength putties, waxes, and caulks at the other.  Putties and caulks serve only one function – i.e., to take up space and fill voids.  [[Silicone]] is an example of a sealant - and has a proven long life and is unaffected by UV or extremes of weather or temperature.

==Comparison with adhesives==
The main difference between [[adhesive]]s and sealants is that sealants typically have lower strength and higher elongation than adhesives do.  When sealants are used between substrates having different thermal coefficients of expansion or differing elongation under stress, they need to have adequate flexibility and elongation. Sealants generally contain inert filler material and are usually formulated with an [[elastomer]] to give the required flexibility and elongation. They usually have a paste consistency to allow filling of gaps between substrates. Low shrinkage after application is often required. Many adhesive technologies can be formulated into sealants.

[[File:Slush on window in three lights.jpg|thumb|250px|Slush on a window in three different light settings]]
'''Slush''', also called '''slush ice''', is a [[slurry]] mixture of small ice crystals (e.g., snow) and [[liquid]] [[water]].&lt;ref&gt;World Meteorological Organization Definitions of Sea Ice http://www.dbcp.noaa.gov/seashelp/HtmlIceGlossary.htm#slush {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108181615/http://www.dbcp.noaa.gov/seashelp/HtmlIceGlossary.htm |date=2009-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/slush|title=Definition of SLUSH|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the natural environment, slush forms when [[ice]] or snow melts. This often mixes with dirt and other materials, resulting in a gray or muddy brown color. Often, solid ice or snow can block the drainage of fluid water from slushy areas, so slush often goes through multiple freeze/thaw cycles before completely disappearing.

In areas where [[road salt]] is used to clear [[road]]ways, slush forms at lower temperatures than it would ordinarily in salted areas. This can produce a number of different consistencies over the same geographical area.

Slushfall or slushing is the action of a wet snow falling from the sky.

== Hazards ==
[[File:FrozenTireMarks@Sunrise(byPeterBesser).jpg|thumb|right|Roadside puddle slush refrozen during the night.]]

Because slush behaves like a [[Non-Newtonian fluid]],&lt;ref&gt;http://arc.lib.montana.edu/snow-science/objects/issw-1994-657-665.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which means it behaves like a solid mass until its inner [[Shear force|shear forces]] rise beyond a specific threshold and beyond can very suddenly become [[Viscosity|fluid]], it is very difficult to predict its behavior. This is the underlying mechanism of [[Avalanche]]s and their unpredictability and thus hidden potential to become a [[natural hazard]].

Slush can also be a problem on an [[aircraft]] [[runway]] since the effect of excess slush acting on the aircraft's wheels can have a resisting effect during take off, which can cause an accident such as the [[Munich air disaster]]. Slush on [[road]]s can also increase the [[braking distance]]s for [[Automobile|cars]] and [[truck]]s, increasing the possibility of rear end [[Car accident|crashes]] and [[Collision#Traffic|other accidents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/weather/weather_events/snow_ice.htm|title=Snow &amp; Ice - FHWA Road Weather Management|website=ops.fhwa.dot.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slush refreezing in overnight [[frost]] can turn to dangerous slippery ice underfoot.

In some cases though, slush can be beneficial. When snow hits the slush, it melts on contact. This prevents roads from becoming too congested with snow or sleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc27.com/news/penndot-slush-kept-roads-from-becoming-icy_20180327041330708/1081508938|title=PennDOT: Slush kept roads from becoming icy|last=Wilson|first=Logan|date=2018-02-07|work=WHTM|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''solar car''' is a [[solar vehicle]] used for land transport. Solar cars usually run on only power from the sun, although some models will supplement that power using a battery, or use solar panels to recharge batteries or run auxiliary systems for a car that mainly uses battery power.

Solar cars combine technology typically used in the [[aerospace]], [[bicycle]], [[alternative energy]] and [[automotive]] industries. The design of a solar vehicle is severely limited by the amount of energy input into the car. Most solar cars have been built for the purpose of [[solar car racing|solar car races]]. Some prototypes have been designed for public use, although no cars primarily powered by the sun are available commercially.

Solar cars depend on a [[solar array]] that uses [[photovoltaic cell]]s (PV cells) to convert sunlight into electricity. Unlike solar thermal energy which converts solar energy to heat, PV cells directly convert sunlight into electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dieoff.org/page84.htm Pimentel, D. "Renewable Energy: Economic and Environmental Issues"]&lt;/ref&gt; When sunlight (photons) strike PV cells, they excite electrons and allow them to flow, creating an electric current. PV cells are made of semiconductor materials such as [[silicon]] and alloys of indium, gallium and nitrogen. [[Crystalline silicon]] is the most common material used and has an efficiency rate of 15-20%. 

==History==

The first model solar car invented was a tiny 15-inch vehicle created by General Motors employee, William G. Cobb. Called it the [[Sunmobile]], he displayed it in 1955 at the Chicago, Powerama convention. It was made up of 12 selenium photovoltaic cells and a small electric motor. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.automostory.com/first-solar-car.htm|title= History of the Solar car|publisher= Automo Story 386N. Arrowhead Avenue San Bernardino, CA 92415|access-date= 2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solar array==

The solar array consists of hundreds of  [[solar cells]] converting sunlight into electricity. In order to construct an array, PV cells are placed together to form modules which are placed together to form an array.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, J., Power from sunlight: photovoltaics&lt;/ref&gt; The larger arrays in use can produce over 2 kilowatts (2.6&amp;nbsp;hp).

[[Image:Pv cells.png|frame|right|[[Solar cell|Cells]], [[Solar module|modules]], and [[Solar array|arrays]]]]

The solar array can be mounted in six ways: 
* '''horizontal'''. This most common arrangement gives most overall power during most of the day in low latitudes or higher latitude summers and offers little interaction with the wind. Horizontal arrays can be integrated or be in the form of a free canopy.
* '''vertical'''. This arrangement is sometimes found in free standing or integrated [[sails]] to harness wind energy.&lt;ref name="Wind"&gt;The Leading Edge, Tamai, Goro, Robert Bentley, Inc., 1999, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Useful solar power is limited to mornings, evenings, or winters and when the vehicle is pointing in the right direction.
* '''adjustable'''. Free solar arrays can often be tilted around the axis of travel in order to increase power when the sun is low and well to the side. An alternative is to tilt the whole vehicle when parked. Two-axis adjustment is only found on marine vehicles, where the aerodynamic resistance is of less importance than with road vehicles.
* '''integrated'''. Some vehicles cover every available surface with solar cells. Some of the cells will be at an optimal angle whereas others will be shaded.
* '''trailer'''. Solar trailers are especially useful for retrofitting existing vehicles with little stability, e.g. bicycles. Some trailers also include the batteries and others also the drive motor.
* '''remote'''. By mounting the solar array at a stationary location instead of the vehicle, power can be maximised and resistance minimized. The virtual grid-connection however involves more electrical losses than with true solar vehicles and the battery must be larger.

The choice of solar array geometry involves an optimization between power output, aerodynamic resistance and vehicle mass, as well as practical considerations. For example, a free horizontal canopy gives 2-3 times the surface area of a vehicle with integrated cells but offers better cooling of the cells and shading of the riders. There are also thin flexible solar arrays in development.

Solar arrays on solar cars are mounted and encapsulated very differently from stationary solar arrays. Solar arrays on solar cars are usually mounted using industrial grade double-sided adhesive tape right onto the car's body. The arrays are encapsulated using thin layers of Tedlar.

Some solar cars use gallium arsenide solar cells, with efficiencies around thirty percent. Other solar cars use silicon solar cells, with efficiencies around twenty percent.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Batteries==
The battery pack in a typical solar car is sufficient to allow the car to go 250 miles (400&amp;nbsp;km) without sun, and allow the car to continuously travel at speeds of  {{convert|60|mph|abbr=on}}.

==Motors==
The motors used in solar cars typically about 2 or 3 horsepower,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://welweb.org/solar/solar.html |title=Why Not a Practical Solar Powered Car? |publisher=Welweb.org |date= |accessdate=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet experimental light solar cars may attain the same speed as a typical family car ({{convert|100|mph|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5723794/ns/us_news-environment/t/fastest-solar-powered-car-tour/ Fastest solar-powered car on tour]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telemetry==
To keep the car running smoothly, the driver must monitor multiple gauges to spot possible problems. Cars without gauges almost always feature wireless [[telemetry]], which allows the driver's team to monitor the car's energy consumption, solar energy capture and other parameters and thereby freeing the driver to concentrate on driving.

==Races==
{{Main|Solar car racing}}
{{Update|American Solar Challenge from July 21–28, 2014|date=October 2014}}
[[Image:Solar Vehicles - Winnipeg.jpg|thumb|Solar cars from [[University of Michigan Solar Car Team|University of Michigan]] and [[University of Minnesota Solar Vehicle Project|University of Minnesota]] heading west toward the finish line in the 2005 North American Solar Challenge.]]

Two solar car races are the [[World Solar Challenge]] and the [[American Solar Challenge]], overland road rally-style competitions contested by a variety of university and corporate teams.

The [[World Solar Challenge]] features a field of competitors from around the world who race to cross the [[Australian continent]], over a distance of {{convert|3000|km}}. Speeds of the vehicles have steadily increased. So, for example, the high speeds of 2005 race participants led to the rules being changed for solar cars starting in the 2007 race and 2014 also.

The [[American Solar Challenge]], previously known as the 'North American Solar Challenge' and 'Sunrayce USA', features mostly collegiate teams racing in timed intervals in the United States and Canada. This race also changed rules for the most recent race due to teams reaching the regulated speed limits. The most recent American Solar Challenge took place on July 21–28, 2014 from Austin, Texas to [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://americansolarchallenge.org/ Official ASC Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dell-Winston School Solar Car Challenge]] is an annual solar-powered car race for high school students. The event attracts teams from around the world, but mostly from American high schools. The race was first held in 1995. Each event is the end product of a two-year education cycle launched by the Winston Solar Car Team. In odd-numbered years, the race is a road course that starts at the Dell Diamond in Round Rock, Texas; the end of the course varies from year to year. In even-numbered years, the race is a track race around the Texas Motor Speedway. Dell has sponsored the event since 2002.
[[File:Solar cells power Electric Car.jpg|right|thumb| [[Solar-charged vehicle|Solar]] cells spread over the top of this car produce enough [[Renewable energy|energy]] to keep its [[Electric power|electric]] motor running.|160px]]

The [[South African Solar Challenge]] is an epic, bi-annual, two-week race of solar-powered cars through the length and breadth of South Africa. Teams will have to build their own cars, design their own engineering systems and race those same machines through the most demanding terrain that solar cars have ever seen. The 2008 race proved that this event can attract the interest of the public, and that it has the necessary international backing from the FIA. Late in September, all entrants will take off from Pretoria and make their way to Cape Town via the N1, then drive along the coast to Durban, before climbing the escarpment on their way back to the finish line in Pretoria 10 days later. In 2008 the event was endorsed by International Solarcar Federation (ISF), [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA), [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) making it the first Solar Race to receive endorsement from these 3 organizations.

There are other distance races, such as [[Suzuka Circuit|Suzuka]], [[Phaethon]], [[World Green Challenge|WGC (WSR/JISFC/WSBR)]] and the [[2006 World Solar Rally in Taiwan|World Solar Rally in Taiwan]]. Suzuka and WGC is a yearly track race in [[Japan]] and Phaethon was part of the Cultural Olympiad in [[Greece]] right before the [[2004 Olympics]].

==Speed record==
[[File:solar car LSR.jpg|thumb|right|Sunswift IV and control vehicle during speed record attempts at HMAS ''Albatross''.]]
[[Guinness World Records]] recognize a land speed record for vehicles powered only by solar panels. This record is currently held by the Sky Ace TIGA from the [[Ashiya University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/1/fastest-solar-powered-vehicle |title=Fastest solar-powered vehicle |publisher=Guinness World Records |date=2014-08-20 |accessdate=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record of 91.332&amp;nbsp;km/h (56.75&amp;nbsp;mph) was set on 20 August 2014 at the [[Shimojishima Airport]], in [[Miyakojima]], [[Okinawa]], [[Japan]]. The previous record was held by the [[University of New South Wales]] with the car [[Sunswift|Sunswift IV]]. Its {{convert|25|kg|adj=on}} battery was removed so the vehicle was powered only by its solar panels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-01-world-fastest-solar-car-guinness.html World's fastest solar car smashed Guinness World Record]&lt;/ref&gt; The record of {{convert|88.8|km/h|abbr=on}} was set on 7 January 2011 at the naval air base {{HMAS|Albatross|air station|6}} in [[Nowra]], breaking the record previously held by the [[General Motors]] car [[Sunraycer]] of {{convert|78.3|km/h}}. The record takes place over a flying {{convert|500|m}} stretch, and is the average of two runs in opposite directions.

==Cars for public use==

In the south-west [[Indian Ocean]], [[tropical cyclone]]s form south of the [[equator]] and west of [[90th meridian east|90°&amp;nbsp;E]] to the coast of [[Africa]].

==Warnings and nomenclature==
Each year, the [[Météo-France]] office (MFR) based on [[Réunion]] island issues warnings on tropical cyclones within the basin, which is defined as the waters of the [[Indian Ocean]] from the coast of Africa to 90°&amp;nbsp;[[Longitude|E]], south of the [[equator]]. The agency issues the warnings as part of its role as a [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]], designated as such in 1993 by the [[World Meteorological Organization]]. Intensities are estimated through the [[Dvorak technique]], which utilizes images from satellites by the American [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]].&lt;ref name="ss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="caroff"&gt;{{cite report|author=Philippe Caroff|date=June 2011|title=Operational procedures of TC satellite analysis at RSMC La Reunion|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=2014-01-11|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/RSMCLaReunionforIWSATC.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006123441/http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/RSMCLaReunionforIWSATC.pdf|archivedate=2014-10-06|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] &amp;ndash; a joint [[United States Navy]]&amp;nbsp;– [[United States Air Force]] task force &amp;ndash; also issues tropical cyclone warnings for the region.&lt;ref name="atcr"&gt;{{cite report|publisher=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|page=iii, 218, 240|title=Annual Tropical Cyclone Report|accessdate=2014-01-11|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/atcr/1997atcr.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wind estimates from Météo-France and most other basins throughout the world are [[maximum sustained winds|sustained]] over 10&amp;nbsp;minutes, while estimates from the United States-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center are sustained over 1&amp;nbsp;minute. 1-minute winds are about 1.12 times the amount of 10-minute winds.&lt;ref name="FAQD4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/D4.html|title=Subject: D4) What does "maximum sustained wind" mean?

If a tropical storm in the basin strengthens to attain 10&amp;nbsp;minute sustained winds of at least 118&amp;nbsp;km/h (74&amp;nbsp;mph), the MFR classifies it as a [[Tropical cyclone scales#South-Western Indian Ocean|tropical cyclone]], equivalent to a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale|hurricane]] or [[typhoon]] (a use of "tropical cyclone" which is more restrictive than the usual definition).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Landsea|publisher=Hurricane Research Division|series=Frequently Asked Questions|title=Subject: A1) What is a hurricane, typhoon, or tropical cyclone?|accessdate=2015-02-20|date=2001-07-15|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the basin===
The first storm in the database for MFR originated on January&amp;nbsp;11, 1848. In January&amp;nbsp;1960, the first [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]] was Alex, and each subsequent year had a list of storm names. Beginning in 1967, satellites helped locate cyclones in the basin, and in the following year, the MFR began estimating storm intensities from the satellite images. By 1977, the agency was using the [[Dvorak technique]] on an unofficial basis, but officially adopted it in 1981. Originally, the basin only extended to 80°&amp;nbsp;E, and while it was extended eastward to the current 90°&amp;nbsp;E, a lack of satellite imagery initially made data uncertain east of 80°&amp;nbsp;E. The World Meteorological Organization designated the MFR as a Regional Tropical Cyclones Advisory Centre in 1988, and upgraded it to a [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] in 1993. In May 1998, two Europe-based [[Meteosat]] satellites began providing complete coverage of the basin. On July&amp;nbsp;1, 2002, the MFR shifted the cyclone year to begin on this date and end on June&amp;nbsp;30 of the following year; previously, the cyclone year began on August&amp;nbsp;1 and ended on the subsequent July&amp;nbsp;31. In 2003, the MFR extended their area of warning responsibility to 40°&amp;nbsp;[[Latitude|S]], having previously been limited at 30°&amp;nbsp;S.&lt;ref name="caroff"/&gt; During 2011, MFR started a reanalysis project of all tropical systems between 1978–98, with methods such as a Dvorak technique reanalysis and use of microwave imagery.&lt;ref name="RSMC"&gt;{{cite conference|author=Philippe Caroff|date=October 23, 2015|title=Review of recent (2012-2015) main activities and achievements at RSMC La Reunion|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=November 1, 2015|url=https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/linkedfiles/Doc4.2.1_RSMCLaReunion.docx|format=docx|conference=Eighth tropical cyclone technical coordination meeting (TCM-8)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary results from this reanalysis project include correcting an increasing trend in the number of very intense tropical cyclones in the basin since 1978.&lt;ref name="RSMC"/&gt; This also revealed a seemingly systematic underestimation of tropical cyclone intensities in the past.&lt;ref name="RSMC"/&gt;

==Statistics==
From the [[1980–81 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season|1980–81]] to the [[2010–11 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season|2010–11]] season, there was an average of 9.3&amp;nbsp;tropical storms each year in the basin. A tropical storm has 10&amp;nbsp;minute winds of at least 65&amp;nbsp;km/h (40&amp;nbsp;mph). There are an average of five storms that become tropical cyclones, which have 10
&amp;nbsp;minute winds of at least 120&amp;nbsp;km/h (75&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Landsea|author2=Sandy Delgado|title=Subject: E10) What are the average, most, and least tropical cyclones occurring in each basin?|series=Frequently Asked Questions|date=2014-05-01|publisher=Hurricane Research Division|accessdate=2014-10-13|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/E10.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2002, there was an average of 54&amp;nbsp;days when tropical systems were active in the basin, of which 20 had [[Tropical cyclone scales#South-Western Indian Ocean|tropical cyclones]] active, or a system with winds of over 120&amp;nbsp;km/h (75&amp;nbsp;mph). The median start date for the season was November&amp;nbsp;17, and the median end date was April&amp;nbsp;20.&lt;ref name="ss"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyclone Season 2001–2002|url=http://www.meteo.fr/temps/domtom/La_Reunion/webcmrs9.0/anglais/archives/publications/saisons_cycloniques/index20012002.html|work=RSMC La Reunion|publisher=Meteo-France|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the [[monsoon trough|monsoon]] does not cross into the [[Mozambique Channel]] until December; as a result, storms rarely form there before that time.&lt;ref name="ss"/&gt; From 1948 to 2010, 94&amp;nbsp;tropical systems developed in the small body of water, of which about half made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Corene J.

A survey in 2004 conducted by weather expert Gary Padgett found meteorologists split whether these storms should be classified as tropical or [[subtropical cyclone|subtropical]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Gary Padgett|title=June 2004 Monthly Global Tropical Cyclone Summary|accessdate=2015-02-20|url=http://www.australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2004/summ0406.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an average year, ten tropical depressions or storms strike Madagascar, and most generally do not cause much damage.&lt;ref name="wb2"&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/1992/05/11/000009265_3960925213356/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2015-02-20|publisher=World Bank|title=Cyclone Rehabilitation Project|date=1992-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, storms or their remnants enter the interior of southeastern Africa, bringing heavy rainfall to [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Preliminary Water Resources Assessment for the Limpopo River Basin|author=A.

[[File:CM-alpha.svg|thumb|right|360px|'''A stability derivative.'''  This is an example of a common shorthand notation for stability derivatives.  The "M" indicates it is a measure of ''pitching'' moment changes.  The &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; indicates the changes are in response to changes in [[angle of attack]].  This stability derivative is pronounced "see-em-alpha".  It is one measure of how strongly an aircraft wants to fly "nose first", which is clearly very important.
]]
'''Stability derivatives''', and also '''control derivatives''', are measures of how particular forces and moments on an aircraft change as other parameters related to stability change (parameters such as [[airspeed]], [[altitude]], [[angle of attack]], etc.).  For a defined "trim" flight condition, changes and oscillations occur in these parameters.  ''Equations of motion'' are used to analyze these changes and oscillations.  Stability and control derivatives are used to linearize (simplify) these equations of motion so the stability of the vehicle can be more readily analyzed.

Stability and control derivatives change as flight conditions change.  The collection of stability and control derivatives as they change over a range of flight conditions is called an '''aero model'''.  Aero models are used in engineering '''[[flight simulators]]''' to analyze stability, and in real-time flight simulators for training and entertainment.

==''Stability'' derivative vs. ''control'' derivative==
''Stability'' derivatives and ''control'' derivatives are related because they both are measures of forces and moments on a vehicle as other parameters change.  Often the words are used together and abbreviated in the term "S&amp;C derivatives".  They differ in that stability derivatives measure the effects of changes in flight conditions while control derivatives measure effects of changes in the control surface positions:

; ''Stability'' derivative: measures how much change occurs in a [[forces|force]] or [[torque|moment]] acting on the vehicle when there is a small change in a '''''flight condition parameter''''' such as [[angle of attack]], airspeed, altitude, etc.  (Such parameters are called "states".)
; ''Control'' derivative: measures how much change occurs in a force or moment acting on the vehicle when there is a small change in the '''''deflection of a control surface''''' such as the ailerons, elevator, and rudder.

==Uses==

===Linearization (simplification) of stability analysis===
Stability and control derivatives change as flight conditions change.  That is, the forces and moments on the vehicle are seldom simple (linear) functions of its states.  Because of this, the dynamics of atmospheric flight vehicles can be difficult to analyze. The following are two methods used to tackle this complexity.

; Small oscillations about otherwise steady flight conditions: One way to simplify analysis is to consider only small oscillations about otherwise steady flight conditions.  The set of flight conditions (such as altitude, airspeed, angle of attack) are called "trim" conditions when they are steady and not changing.  When flight conditions are steady, stability and control derivatives are constant and can be more easily analyzed mathematically.  The analysis at a single set of flight conditions is then applied to a range of different flight conditions.

; Application in simulators for stability analysis: In a flight simulator, it is possible to "look up" new values for stability and control derivatives as conditions change.  And so, the "linear approximations" aren't as great and stability can be assessed in maneuvers that span a greater range of flight conditions.  Flight simulators used for analysis such as this are called "engineering simulators".  The set of values for stability and control derivatives (as they change over various flight conditions) is called an '''aero model'''.

===Use in flight simulators===
In addition to engineering simulators, aero models are often used in ''[[flight simulator|real time flight simulators]]'' for home use and professional flight training.

==Names for the axes of vehicles==
Air vehicles use a coordinate system of axes to help name important parameters used in the analysis of stability.  All the axes run through the [[center of gravity]] (called the "CG"):

*"X" or "x" axis runs from back to front along the body, called the ''Roll Axis''.
*"Y" or "y" axis runs left to right along the wing, called the ''Pitch Axis''.
*"Z" or "z" runs from top to bottom, called the ''Yaw Axis''.

Two slightly different alignments of these axes are used depending on the situation: "body-fixed axes", and "stability axes".

===Body-fixed axes===

Body-fixed axes, or "body axes", are defined and fixed relative to the body of the vehicle.:&lt;ref name=Roskam_ch4&gt;{{cite book|last=Roskam|first=Jan|title=Airplane Flight Dynamics and Automatic Flight Controls|publisher=Roskam Aviation and Engineering Corporation|location=Ottawa, Kansas|year=1979|volume=1|pages=113|chapter=4}}Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 78-31382&lt;/ref&gt;

*X body axis is aligned along the vehicle body and is usually positive toward the normal direction of motion.
*Y body axis is at a right angle to the x body axis and is oriented along the wings of the vehicle.  If there are no wings (as with a missile), a "horizontal" direction is defined in a way that is useful.  The Y body axis is usually taken to be positive to right side of the vehicle.
*Z body axis is perpendicular to wing-body (XY) plane and usually points downward.

===Stability axes===

Aircraft (usually not missiles) operate at a nominally constant "trim"  [[angle of attack]].  The angle of the nose (the X Axis) does not align with the direction of the oncoming air.  The difference in these directions ''is'' the ''angle of attack''.  So, for many purposes, parameters are defined in terms of a slightly modified axis system called "stability axes".  The stability axis system is used to get the X axis aligned with the oncoming flow direction.  Essentially, the body axis system is rotated about the Y body axis by the trim [[angle of attack]] and then "re-fixed" to the body of the aircraft:&lt;ref name=Roskam_ch4/&gt;

*X stability axis is aligned into the direction of the oncoming air in ''steady'' flight.  (It is projected into the plane made by the X and Z body axes if there is [[Angle of sideslip|sideslip]]).
*Y stability axis is the ''same'' as the Y body-fixed axis.
*Z stability axis is perpendicular to the plane made by the X stability axis and the Y ''body'' axis.

==Names for forces, moments, and velocities ==

===Forces and velocities along each of the axes===

Forces on the vehicle along the body axes are called "Body-axis Forces":
*X, or F&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;, is used to indicate forces on the vehicle along the X axis
*Y, or F&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;, is used to indicate forces on the vehicle along the Y axis
*Z, or F&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;, is used to indicate forces on the vehicle along the Z axis
*u (lower case) is used for speed of the oncoming flow along the X body axis
*v (lower case) is used for speed of the oncoming flow along the Y body axis
*w (lower case) is used for speed of the oncoming flow along the Z body axis

::It is helpful to think of these speeds as projections of the relative wind vector on to the three body axes, rather than in terms of the translational motion of the vehicle relative to the fluid.  As the body rotates relative to direction of the [[relative wind]], these components change, even when there is no net change in [[speed]].

===Moments and angular rates around each of the axes===

*L is used to indicate the "[[roll (flight)|rolling]] moment", which is around the X axis.  Whether it is around the X body axis or the X stability axis depends on context (such as a subscript).
*M is used to indicate the name of the "[[Pitch (flight)|pitching]] moment", which is around the Y axis.
*N is used to indicate the name of the "[[Yaw angle|yawing]] moment", which is around the Z axis.  Whether it is around the Z body axis or the Z stability axis depends on context (such as a subscript).
*"P" or "p" is used for angular rate about the X axis ("Roll rate about the roll axis").  Whether it is around the X body axis or the X stability axis depends on context (such as a subscript).
*"Q" or "q" is used for angular rate about the Y axis ("Pitch rate about the pitch axis").
*"R" or "r" is used for angular rate about the Z axis ("Yaw rate about the yaw axis").  Whether it is around the Z body axis or the Z stability axis depends on context (such as a subscript).

==Equations of motion==

The use of stability derivatives is most conveniently demonstrated with missile or rocket configurations, because these exhibit greater symmetry than aeroplanes, and the equations of motion are correspondingly simpler. If it is assumed that the vehicle is roll-controlled, the pitch and yaw motions may be treated in isolation.  It is common practice to consider the yaw plane, so that only 2D motion need be considered.  Furthermore, it is assumed that thrust equals drag, and the longitudinal equation of motion may be ignored.

[[File:missileDynamics.svg|thumb|right|360px|.]]

The body is oriented at angle &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; (psi) with respect to inertial axes. The body is oriented at an angle &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; (beta) with respect to the velocity vector, so that the components of velocity in body axes are:
::&lt;math&gt;u=U \cos\beta&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;v=U \sin\beta&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the speed.

The aerodynamic forces are generated with respect to body axes, which is not an inertial frame. In order to calculate the motion, the forces must be referred to inertial axes. This requires the body components of velocity to be resolved through the heading angle &lt;math&gt;(\beta)&lt;/math&gt; into inertial axes.

Resolving into fixed (inertial) axes:
::&lt;math&gt;u_f=U\cos(\beta)\cos(\psi)-U\sin(\beta)\sin(\psi)=U\cos(\beta+\psi)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;v_f=U\sin(\beta)\cos(\psi)+U\cos(\beta)\sin(\psi)=U\sin(\beta+\psi)&lt;/math&gt;
The acceleration with respect to inertial axes is found by differentiating these components of velocity with respect to time:
::&lt;math&gt; \frac {du_f}{dt}=\frac {dU} {dt} \cos(\beta+\psi)-U\frac {d(\beta+\psi)} {dt} \sin(\beta+\psi) &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv_f}{dt}=\frac{dU}{dt}\sin(\beta+\psi)+U\frac{d(\beta+\psi)}{dt}\cos(\beta+\psi)&lt;/math&gt;
From [[Newton's Second Law]], this is equal to the force acting divided by the [[mass]]. Now forces arise  from the [[pressure]] distribution over the body, and hence are generated in body axes, and not in inertial axes, so the body forces must be resolved to [[inertial axes]], as Newton's Second Law does not apply in its simplest form to an accelerating frame of reference.

Resolving the body forces:
::&lt;math&gt;X_f=X\cos(\psi)-Y\sin(\psi)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;Y_f=Y\cos(\psi)+X\sin(\psi)&lt;/math&gt;
Newton's Second Law, assuming constant mass:
::&lt;math&gt;X_f=m\frac{du_f}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;Y_f=m\frac{dv_f}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m''  is the mass.
Equating the inertial values of acceleration and force, and resolving back into body axes, yields the equations of motion:
::&lt;math&gt;X=m\frac{dU}{dt}\cos(\beta)-mU\frac{d(\beta+\psi)}{dt}\sin(\beta)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;Y=m\frac{dU}{dt}\sin(\beta)+mU\frac{d(\beta+\psi)}{dt}\cos(\beta)&lt;/math&gt;
The sideslip, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, is a small quantity, so the small [[perturbation analysis|perturbation]] equations of motion become:
::&lt;math&gt;X=m\frac{dU}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;Y=mU\frac{d(\beta+\psi)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;
The first resembles the usual expression of Newton's Second Law, whilst the second is essentially the [[centrifugal acceleration]].
The equation of motion governing the rotation of the body is derived from the time derivative of [[angular momentum]]:
::&lt;math&gt;N=C\frac{d^2\psi}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where  C  is the [[moment of inertia]] about the yaw axis.
Assuming constant speed, there are only two state variables; &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\psi}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;, which will be written more compactly as the yaw rate  r.
There is one force and one moment, which for a given flight condition will each be functions of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, r and their time derivatives.  For typical missile configurations the forces and moments depend, in the short term, on &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and r.  The forces may be expressed in the form:
::&lt;math&gt;Y=Y_0 + \frac {\partial Y}{\partial \beta} \beta +\frac {\partial Y}{\partial r}r&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Y_0&lt;/math&gt; is the force corresponding to the [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] condition (usually called the [[trim (aircraft)|trim]]) whose stability is being investigated.
It is common practice to employ a shorthand:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial Y}{\partial \beta}=Y_\beta&lt;/math&gt;
The [[partial derivative]] &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial Y}{\partial \beta} &lt;/math&gt; and all similar terms characterising the increments in forces and moments due to increments in the state variables are called stability derivatives.  
Typically, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial Y}{\partial r}&lt;/math&gt; is insignificant for missile configurations, so the equations of motion reduce to:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\beta}{dt}=\frac{Y_\beta}{mU}\beta-r&lt;/math&gt;  
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dr}{dt}=\frac{N_\beta}{C}\beta+\frac{N_r}{C}r&lt;/math&gt;

==Stability derivative contributions==

Each stability derivative is determined by the position, size, shape and orientation of the missile components.  In aircraft, the [[directional stability]] determines such features as [[Dihedral (aeronautics)|dihedral]] of the main planes, size of fin and area of [[tailplane]], but the large number of important stability derivatives involved precludes a detailed discussion within this article.  The missile is characterised by only three stability derivatives, and hence provides a useful introduction to the more complex aeroplane dynamics.

[[File:dartYbeta.svg|thumb|right|360px|This diagram shows ''lift'' as perpendicular to the longitudinal body axis. In most technical usage, lift is perpendicular to the oncoming flow.  That is, perpendicular to the longitudinal ''stability'' axis.]]

Consider first &lt;math&gt;Y_\beta&lt;/math&gt;, a body at an [[angle of attack]] &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; generates a lift force in the opposite direction to the motion of the body.  For this reason &lt;math&gt;Y_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is always negative.

[[File:dartNbeta.svg|thumb|right|360px|This diagram shows ''lift'' as perpendicular to the longitudinal body axis. In most technical usage, lift is perpendicular to the oncoming flow.  That is, perpendicular to the longitudinal ''stability'' axis.]]

At low angles of attack, the lift is generated primarily by the wings, fins and the nose region of the body. The total lift acts at a distance &lt;math&gt;x_{cp}&lt;/math&gt; ahead of the [[centre of gravity]] (it has a negative value in the figure), this, in missile parlance, is the centre of pressure . If the lift acts ahead of the centre of gravity, the yawing moment will be negative, and will tend to increase the angle of attack, increasing both the lift and the moment further.  It follows that the centre of pressure must lie aft of the centre of gravity for static stability.  &lt;math&gt;x_{cp}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[static margin]] and must be negative for [[longitudinal static stability]]. Alternatively, positive angle of attack must generate positive yawing moment on a statically stable missile, i.e. &lt;math&gt;N_\beta&lt;/math&gt; must be positive.  It is common practice to design manoeuvrable missiles with near zero static margin (i.e. neutral static stability).

The need for positive &lt;math&gt;N_\beta&lt;/math&gt; explains why arrows and darts have flights and unguided rockets have fins.

[[File:dartNr.svg|thumb|right|360px|.]]

The effect of angular velocity is mainly to decrease the nose lift and increase the tail lift, both of which act in a sense to oppose the rotation.  &lt;math&gt;N_r&lt;/math&gt; is therefore always negative.  There is a contribution from the wing, but since missiles tend to have small static margins (typically less than a [[caliber|calibre]]), this is usually small.  Also the fin contribution is greater than that of the nose, so there is a net force &lt;math&gt;Y_r&lt;/math&gt;, but this is usually insignificant compared with &lt;math&gt;Y_\beta&lt;/math&gt; and is usually ignored.

==Response==

Manipulation of the equations of motion yields a second order homogeneous linear differential equation in the angle of attack &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2\beta}{dt^2}-\left(\frac{Y_\beta}{mU}+\frac{N_r}{C}\right)\frac{d\beta}{dt}+\left(\frac{N_\beta}{C}+\frac{Y_\beta}{mU}\frac{N_r}{C}\right)\beta=0&lt;/math&gt;

The qualitative behavior of this equation is considered in the article on [[directional stability]].  Since &lt;math&gt;Y_\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N_r&lt;/math&gt; are both negative, the [[damping]] is positive. The stiffness does not only depend on the static stability term &lt;math&gt;N_\beta&lt;/math&gt;, it also contains a term which effectively determines the angle of attack due to the body rotation.  The distance of the center of lift, including this term, ahead of the centre of gravity is called the [[maneuver margin]]. It must be negative for stability.

This damped oscillation in angle of attack and yaw rate, following a disturbance, is called the 'weathercock' mode, after the tendency of a [[weathercock]] to point into wind.

==Comments==
The state variables were chosen to be the angle of attack &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; and the yaw rate r, and have omitted the speed perturbation u, together with the associated derivatives e.g. &lt;math&gt;Y_u&lt;/math&gt;. This may appear arbitrary. However, since the timescale of the speed variation is much greater than that of the variation in angle of attack, its effects are negligible as far as the directional stability of the vehicle is concerned.  Similarly, the effect of roll on yawing motion was also ignored, because missiles generally have low [[Aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] configurations and the roll inertia is much less than the yaw inertia, consequently the roll loop is expected to be much faster than the yaw response, and is ignored.  These simplifications of the problem based on ''a priori'' knowledge, represent an engineer's approach.  Mathematicians prefer to keep the problem as general as possible and only simplify it at the end of the analysis, if at all.

Aircraft dynamics is more complex than missile dynamics, mainly because the simplifications, such as separation of fast and slow modes, and the similarity between pitch and yaw motions, are not obvious from the equations of motion, and are consequently deferred until a late stage of the analysis. Subsonic transport aircraft have high aspect ratio configurations, so that yaw and roll cannot be treated as decoupled.  However, this is merely a matter of degree; the basic ideas needed to understand aircraft dynamics are covered in this simpler analysis of missile motion.

==Control derivatives==

Deflection of control surfaces modifies the pressure distribution over the vehicle, and these are dealt with by including perturbations in forces and moments due to control deflection.  The fin deflection is normally denoted &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; (zeta).  Including these terms, the equations of motion become:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\beta}{dt}=\frac{Y_\beta}{mU}\beta-r+\frac{Y_\zeta}{mU}\zeta&lt;/math&gt;  
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dr}{dt}=\frac{N_\beta}{C}\beta+\frac{N_r}{C}r+\frac{N_\zeta}{C}\zeta&lt;/math&gt;
Including the control derivatives enables the response of the vehicle to be studied, and the equations of motion used to design the autopilot.

== Examples ==

*'''C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''', called ''[[Dihedral (aeronautics)|dihedral effect]]'', is a stability derivative that measures changes in ''rolling moment'' as [[Angle of sideslip]] changes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5600">A '''stuffing box''' is an assembly which is used to house a [[gland seal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Volk | first = Michael | title = Pump Characteristics and Applications | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | location = Washington | year = 2005 | pages = 333–334 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=29XYpypoRywC&amp;pg=PA333 | isbn = 978-0-8247-2755-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is used to prevent leakage of fluid, such as water or steam, between sliding or turning parts of [[machine element]]s.

==Components==
A stuffing box of a sailboat will have a stern tube that's slightly bigger than the prop shaft. It will also have packing nut threads or a gland nut. The packing is inside the gland nut and creates the seal. The shaft is wrapped by the packing and put in the gland nut. Through tightening it onto the stern tube, the packing is compressed, creating a seal against the shaft.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.windcheckmagazine.com/stuffing_box_maintenance Stuffing Box Maintenance]", WindCheck Magazine, Retrieved April 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Creating a proper plunger alignment is critical for correct flow and a long wear life. Stuffing box components are of stainless steel, brass or other application-specific materials.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.triangle-pump.com/packing_brass.html Valve Components]", Triangle-Pump, Retrieved April 27, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gland==
A gland is a general type of stuffing box, used to seal a rotating or reciprocating  shaft against a fluid.  The most common example is in the head of a tap ([[faucet]]) where the gland is usually packed with string which has been soaked in [[tallow]] or similar grease.  The gland nut allows the packing material to be compressed to form a watertight seal and prevent water leaking up the shaft when the tap is turned on. The gland at the rotating shaft of a [[centrifugal pump]] may be packed in a similar way and graphite grease used to accommodate continuous operation. The linear seal around the [[piston rod]] of a double acting steam piston is also known as a gland, particularly in marine applications. Likewise the shaft of a handpump or [[wind pump]] is sealed with a gland where the shaft exits the borehole.

Other types of sealed connections without moving parts are also sometimes called glands; for example, a [[cable gland]] or fitting that connects a flexible electrical conduit to an enclosure, machine or bulkhead facilitates assembly and prevents liquid or gas ingress.

==Applications==

===Boats===
[[File:Small boat stuffing box.jpg|thumb|A small boat stuffing box comprising an adjusting nut, a locking nut and a sleeve.]]
On a boat having an inboard motor that turns a shaft attached to an external [[propeller]], the shaft passes though a stuffing box, also called a "packing box"&lt;ref&gt;https://catalog.hydrasearchrecreational.com/category/packing-boxes-1&lt;/ref&gt; or "stern gland" in this application. The stuffing box prevents sea water from entering the boat's hull. In many small [[fiberglass]] boats, for example, the stuffing box is mounted inboard near the point the shaft exits the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]. The "box" is a cylindrical assembly, typically of bronze, comprising a sleeve threaded on one end to accept adjusting and locking nuts. A special purpose heavy-duty rubber hose attaches the stuffing box to a stern tube, also called a shaft log, that projects inward from the hull. Marine-duty [[hose clamp]]s secure the hose to the stern tube and the aft portion of the stuffing box sleeve. A sound stuffing box installation is critical to safety because failure can admit a catastrophic volume of water into the boat.

In a common type of stuffing box, rings of braided fiber, known as shaft packing or gland packing, form a seal between the shaft and the stuffing box. A traditional variety of shaft packing comprises a square cross-section rope made of [[flax]] or [[hemp]] impregnated with wax and lubricants. A turn of the adjusting nut compresses the shaft packing. Ideally, the compression is just enough to make the seal both watertight when the shaft is stationary and drip slightly when the shaft is turning. The drip rate must be at once sufficient to lubricate and cool the shaft and packing, but not so much as could sink an unattended boat.

The market offers improved shaft packing materials that aim to be drip-less when the shaft is turning as well as when stationary. There are also pack-less sealing systems that employ engineered materials such as carbon composites and [[PTFE]] (e.g. Teflon).

===Steam engines===
[[File:"the valve rod comes out the stuffing box...".jpg|thumb|A rod coming out of a stuffing box on a steam engine.]]
In a [[steam engine]], where the piston rod reciprocates through the cylinder cover, a stuffing box provided in the cylinder cover prevents the leakage of steam from the cylinder.

'''TAM Airlines Flight 3054''' (JJ3054/TAM3054) was a regularly-scheduled domestic passenger flight from [[Porto Alegre]] to [[São Paulo]], Brazil.  On July 17, 2007, the [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320-233]] executing the flight, registration PR-MBK, overran runway 35L at São Paulo during moderate rain and crashed into a nearby [[TAM Express]] warehouse adjacent to a [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] [[filling station]] which exploded as a result of the impact.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/americas/07/18/brazil.plane.crash/index.html|title=Pilot in Brazilian crash tried to abort landing, official says|publisher=CNN|date=July 18, 2007|accessdate=July 20, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070811230607/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/americas/07/18/brazil.plane.crash/index.html |archivedate = August 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u312789.shtml|title=Incêndio permanece fora de controle; chances de sobrevivência diminuem|trans-title=Fire remains out of control; chances for survivors diminished|publisher=''[[Folha de S.

The accident was investigated by the [[Brazilian Air Force]]'s [[Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center]] ({{lang-pt|Centro de Investigação e Prevenção de Acidentes Aeronáuticos}} (CENIPA)), with a final report issued in September 2009. CENIPA concluded that the accident was caused by errors committed by the pilots during the landing at São Paulo.

==Aircraft and crew==
[[File:Pacific Airlines Airbus A320 Mutzenberg.jpg|alt=|thumb|The aircraft involved in the accident seen at [[Tan Son Nhat International Airport]] in 2004, while still operating with Pacific Air Lines (now [[Jetstar Pacific]]).]]
The aircraft serving Flight 3054 was an [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320-233]], serial number 789, registration PR-MBK; it was powered by two [[International Aero Engines V2500|IAE V2527E-A5]] engines. It was built in 1998 and had been operated by several other airlines before entering service with TAM in January 2007. The aircraft was owned by [[Pegasus Aviation Finance Company|Pegasus Aviation]] and had flown more than 21,000 hours over 10,000 cycles before the crash.&lt;ref name="flightbreaking"&gt;{{cite web|first=Nicholas|last=Ionides|title=BREAKING NEWS: TAM A320 crashes in São Paulo|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/07/18/215565/breaking-news-tam-a320-crashes-in-sao-paoelo.html|publisher=''[[Flight International]]''|date=July 18, 2007|accessdate=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft was dispatched with the [[thrust reverser]] on the starboard engine deactivated, as it had jammed. TAM said in a statement a fault in a reverser "does not jeopardize landings" and no mechanical problem had been recorded on July 16, the day before the accident.&lt;ref name="fault"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22104315-23109,00.html |title=Brazil plane 'flew with mechanical fault' |date=July 20, 2007 |accessdate=July 20, 2007 |work=news.com.au |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305040633/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C23599%2C22104315-23109%2C00.html |archivedate=March 5, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft had no difficulty braking on the same runway a day before the fatal accident.&lt;ref name="Reuters focus shift"/&gt;

The flight was under the command of an experienced cockpit crew, consisting of Captain Henrique Stefanini Di Sacco (53) and First Officer Kleyber Aguiar Lima (54). Both pilots had been flying for over 30 years. The Captain had logged almost 13,700 flight hours in his career, the First Officer nearly 14,800.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cenipa.aer.mil.br/cenipa/paginas/relatorios/pdf/3054ing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the victims were Brazilian; there were also two French nationals, two Argentinean, one Portuguese, one American, three South Africans and one Peruvian. &lt;ref&gt;http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/especial/2007/voo3054/vitimas.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flight chronology==
[[File:TAM Flight 3054 Rout.svg|alt=|thumb|Flight 3054's route.]]
The plane departed from [[Salgado Filho International Airport]] in [[Porto Alegre]] at 17:18 [[Time zone|local time]] (20:18 [[UTC]]).  At 18:54 local time (21:54 UTC), the flight made its landing at [[Congonhas-São Paulo International Airport|Congonhas-São Paulo Airport]].

==Crash==
[[Image:Voo TAM 3054 - Trajetoria.png|left|thumb|An artist's rendering showing the path of the aircraft during its final moments]]
Flight 3054 was cleared to land at Congonhas' Runway 35L. Reviews by government officials of the surveillance videos showed that despite the aircraft touching down without incident,&lt;!--Di Sacco would've tried to put down with as much runway as possible--&gt; it did not slow down normally, departing the far end at around {{convert|90|kn|km/h mph}},&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.estadao.com.br/cidades/not_cid20766,0.htm Authorities say the plane was above normal speed] O Estado de S. Paulo. Retrieved July 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; bearing to its left. The runway is elevated above the surrounding area, and the aircraft's momentum carried it over traffic on the adjacent [[Washington Luís Pereira de Sousa|''Avenida'' Washington Luís]], a major thoroughfare, and into a four-story [[TAM Express]] facility, resulting in a large fire. The TAM Express building contained offices and a warehouse, and was located adjacent to a Shell gas station. All 187 passengers and crew aboard died and the aircraft was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=O acidente do avião da TAM |url=http://www.agenciabrasil.gov.br/media/infograficos/2007/07/17/acidente_170707.swf/view |publisher=[[Agência Brasil]] |date=July 17, 2007 |accessdate=July 17, 2007 |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516043225/http://www.agenciabrasil.gov.br/media/infograficos/2007/07/17/acidente_170707.swf/view |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The runway had recently been resurfaced, and did not yet have [[Runway#Pavement|water-channeling grooves]] cut into it to reduce the danger of [[hydroplaning (road vehicle)|hydroplaning]].&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;

[[Flight Data Recorder]] (FDR) information recovered after the crash and released by Brazilian authorities showed that immediately prior to touchdown, both [[thrust lever]]s were in CL (or "climb") position, with engine power being governed by the flight computer's [[autothrottle]] system.&lt;ref name="DFDR"&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/20070809-voo3054.pdf TAM Airbus 320-200, Flight No. 3054, PR-MBK]. [[NTSB]]. July 24, 2007. Retrieved on September 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Two seconds prior to touchdown, an aural warning, "retard, retard", was issued by the flight's computer system, advising the pilots to retard the thrust lever to the recommended idle lever position. This would disengage the autothrottle, with engine power then governed directly by the thrust levers.

At the moment of touchdown, the [[Spoiler (aeronautics)|spoiler]] lever was in the "ARMED" position.&lt;ref name="DFDR"/&gt; According to the system logic of the A320's flight controls,&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928080606/http://www.smartcockpit.com/data/pdfs/plane/airbus/A320/systems/A320-Flight_Controls.pdf A320 Flight Controls Manual]. [[Airbus]]. Retrieved on September 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in order for the spoilers to automatically deploy upon touchdown, not only must the spoiler lever be in the "ARMED" position, but both thrust levers must be at or close to the "idle" position. The FDR transcript shows that immediately after the warning, the flight computer recorded the left thrust lever being retarded to the rear-most position, activating the thrust reverser on the left engine, while the right thrust lever (controlling the engine with the disabled thrust reverser) remained in the CL position. One theory put forth by CENIPA is that the pilots may not have noticed that the right engine remained at CL because the Airbus autothrottle system, unlike other aircraft manufacturers, does not automatically move the levers when the autothrust controller changes engine settings. Therefore, the pilots may have thought that the right engine was at idle power without realizing that Airbus autothrust logic dictates that, when one or more of the thrust levers is pulled to the idle position, the autothrust is automatically disengaged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cenipa.aer.mil.br/cenipa/paginas/relatorios/pdf/3054ing.pdf CENIPA Final Report A-No. 67/CENIPA/2009 (English)] [[CENIPA]]. July 17, 2007. Retrieved July 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when the pilot pulled the left engine thrust lever to idle, it disconnected the autothrust system and the computer did not retard the right engine power to idle. The A320's spoilers did not deploy during the landing run, as the right thrust lever was above the "idle" setting required for automatic spoiler deployment.&lt;ref name="DFDR"/&gt; Since the right engine thrust lever was still in the "climb" detent at that time, the right engine accelerated to climb power while the left engine deployed its thrust reverser. The resulting asymmetric thrust condition resulted in a loss of control and a crash ensued.

Aviation safety in Brazil had been under increased scrutiny following the mid-air collision in September 2006 over the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] of [[Gol Transportes Aéreos]] [[Gol Transportes Aéreos Flight 1907|Flight 1907]] and an [[Embraer Legacy 600]] (see [[Brazil's 2006-2007 aviation crisis]]). Congonhas was singled out for having safety issues relating to operations in wet weather due to its location and runway characteristics for the traffic it serves.

The 35L runway at Congonhas is {{convert|1940|m}} long. Congonhas' counterpart in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the [[Santos Dumont Airport]], has an even shorter runway, at {{convert|1323|m|abbr=on}}. Both airports receive the same type of traffic &amp;mdash; ranging from small private planes to Boeing 737s and A320s. Many variables affect the landing distance of an aircraft, such as approach speed, weight and the presence of either a tailwind or a headwind. For an Airbus A320, a landing speed of {{convert|20|kn|km/h}} higher than normal can result in as much as a 25% increase in the runway length needed to stop an aircraft. Wet weather can also significantly reduce the braking performance of aircraft, leading to an increase in the minimum runway length requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rvs.uni-bielefeld.de/publications/Incidents/DOCS/ComAndRep/Warsaw/leyman/analysis-leyman.html A320 Warsaw landing analysis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818002334/http://www.rvs.uni-bielefeld.de/publications/Incidents/DOCS/ComAndRep/Warsaw/leyman/analysis-leyman.html |date=August 18, 2007 }} Prof. Clive Leyman, City University of London. Retrieved July 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilots have called Congonhas airport the "aircraft carrier," because of the runway's short length and because pilots are told to [[go-around]] if they overshoot the first {{convert|1000|ft}} of runway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.latimes.com/articles/la-trw-fgcrash17jul17 Latimes.com] Death toll in Sao Paulo crash at 189 and could rise (Associated Press via latimes.com) 2007-07-17, Retrieved February 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, a Brazilian judge briefly banned flights using [[Fokker 100]], [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-700]] and Boeing 737-800 aircraft in and out of the airport. The [[Airbus A320]] was not among the aircraft banned, due to its manufacturer-stated [[braking distance]] being shorter than those of the banned aircraft. Pilots had complained that water had been accumulating on the runway, reducing aircraft braking performance and occasionally causing planes to [[hydroplaning (road vehicle)|hydroplane]].&lt;ref name="DeadlyReputation"&gt;"Deadly Reputation," ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The judge claimed the runway needed to be {{convert|388|m}} longer for these aircraft to operate safely. At the time, a spokeswoman from Brazil's National Civil Aviation Agency claimed "The safety conditions of the runway and the airport as a whole are adequate."&lt;ref name="BBC News1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jets banned from São Paulo runway|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6337217.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=February 6, 2007|accessdate=July 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; TAM also objected to the decision, with a spokesman stating "If the injunction stands, it will cause total chaos," claiming over 10,000 passengers per day would be inconvenienced.&lt;ref name="BBC News1" /&gt;

===Aftermath===

The airport reopened on July 19, 2007 using an alternative runway.&lt;ref name="Reuters focus shift"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN19425884|title=Focus of Brazil air crash shifts away from runway|date=July 20, 2007|accessdate=July 20, 2007|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many flights, including all [[OceanAir]] and [[BRA Transportes Aéreos]], were transferred to [[Guarulhos International Airport]], the major airport in São Paulo, due to the closure of the main runway at Congonhas and the ongoing investigation of the accident.

On July 20, [[Chief of Staff of Brazil|Presidency Chief of Staff]] [[Dilma Rousseff]] announced plans to significantly reduce the number of flights operating at Congonhas. The plan included banning, within 60 days, all connection, stopover, charter, and international flights and the reduction in the number of private jets. The airport would only operate direct flights to certain cities in Brazil. The plan also called for a study of the expansion of São Paulo's two current airports and the construction of a third airport in the metropolitan area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/SaoPaulo/0,,MUL74121-5605,00.html Confirmed: São Paulo will have a 3rd Airport] {{pt icon}}, July 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==

The investigation was carried out by Brazil's [[Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center]] (''Centro de Investigação e Prevenção de Acidentes Aeronáuticos'', CENIPA). Data from the [[flight data recorder]] and [[cockpit voice recorder]] (CVR) were downloaded by the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] in the United States commencing July 20 and 23 respectively.&lt;ref name="flight-july25"&gt;{{cite web|last=Learmount|first=David|title=Airbus cleared to release TAM accident flight recorder information|publisher=''[[Flight International]]''|date=July 25, 2007|url =http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/07/25/215718/airbus-cleared-to-release-tam-accident-flight-recorder.html |accessdate= July 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flight-july23"&gt;{{cite web|last=Learmount|first=David|title=Probe asks why Airbus A320 could not stop|publisher=''[[Flight International]]''|date=July 23, 2007|url =http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/07/23/215642/probe-asks-why-airbus-a320-could-not-stop.html |accessdate= July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on preliminary data from the FDR, on July 25 Airbus cautioned A320 operators to ensure that both thrust levers are set to idle during flare.&lt;ref name="flight-july25" /&gt; The transcript of the CVR was released on August 1.&lt;ref name="cvr"&gt;{{cite web | last = Targett | first =Michael | title =TAM A320 crash - full transcript from cockpit voice recorder | publisher =''[[Flight International]]''| date =August 2, 2007| url =http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/08/02/215872/tam-a320-crash-full-transcript-from-cockpit-voice-recorder.html| accessdate = August 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows that the pilots were aware of the wet runway conditions and the deactivated thrust reverser.&lt;ref name="flight-aug02"&gt;{{cite web

An investigation&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.haaba.com/news/2008/11/19/7-216276/police-charge-10-people-in-brazils-worst-plane-crash|title = Police charge 10 people in Brazil's worst plane crash|publisher = AFP (Agence France Presse) via haaba.com|date = November 19, 2008|accessdate = December 14, 2015|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120226185021/http://www.haaba.com/news/2008/11/19/7-216276/police-charge-10-people-in-brazils-worst-plane-crash|archivedate = February 26, 2012|dead-url = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Brazilian Public Safety Ministry]] released in November 2008 concluded that the pilots mistakenly left the lever for the right engine to climb upon landing, due to a mistake in landing procedures with the right thrust reverser being disabled from a prior maintenance, when in fact it was necessary to retard both engines in order for the spoilers to work. They also said that the National Civil Aviation Agency should have closed the airport on the night the plane landed because of heavy rains; that Congonhas airport authorities shared the blame because its runway had not been properly constructed with grooves to drain away excess rainwater, contributing to the crash;   that the plane's manufacturer, Airbus, should have provided alarms warning the pilots that the braking system was failing; and that TAM failed to properly train its pilots, who did not act correctly in the emergency.

===Final report===

In September 2009, more than two years after the accident, CENIPA announced the results of official investigations. The report shows that one of the thrust levers, which control engines, was in position to accelerate when it should be in idle, but it was not proved if there was mechanical or human failure as the cause of the accident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cenipa.aer.mil.br/cenipa/paginas/relatorios/pdf/3054ing.pdf Final Report] (PDF), [[Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center]],  October 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u646127.shtml|title= Sem apontar culpados, Aeronáutica divulga relatório sobre acidente da TAM|publisher=''[[Folha de S. Paulo]]''|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/SaoPaulo/0,,MUL1362369-5605,00-FAMILIARES+DAS+VITIMAS+DO+VOO+DA+TAM+RECLAMAM+DE+RELATORIO+DA+PF.html|title=Familiares das vítimas do voo 3054 da TAM reclamam de relatório da PF|publisher=''Globo G1 Notícias''|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report suggests two hypotheses for the accident. In the first, there was a flaw in the power control of the plane's engines, which would have kept one of the thrust levers into acceleration, regardless of their actual position. In such circumstances, there was mechanical failure of the aircraft. The occurrence of this failure is one in 400 billion hours of flight and therefore highly improbable. In the second hypothesis, the pilot has performed a procedure different from that provided in the manual, and put the thrust lever in an irregular position, a configuration of human error for the accident.

In addition to the positions of the thrust levers, the report points to several factors that may have contributed to the accident, such as a high volume of rain on the day, with the formation of puddles on the runway, as well as the absence of grooving. The report does not blame the length of the runway for the accident. The BEA also cleared Airbus of any misdoing because they had proposed a system warning modification regarding the incorrect thrust lever positions which TAM had rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report 3054|url=http://www.cenipa.aer.mil.br/cenipa/paginas/relatorios/pdf/3054ing.pdf|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
After the crash, President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] ordered three days of [[national day of mourning|national mourning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/SaoPaulo/0,,MUL72081-5605,00.html|title=Luto oficial de três dias por acidente da TAM|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All matches of the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A 2007|Campeonato Brasileiro 2007]] started with a minute of silence, while all players wore black armbands. Brazilian [[Formula One]] driver [[Felipe Massa]] had a black stripe on top of his helmet during the [[2007 European Grand Prix]], to commemorate the victims. [[Rubens Barrichello]] also had stripes on his helmet, and the two [[Red Bull Racing]] drivers [[David Coulthard]] and [[Mark Webber]] had small Brazilian flags on their helmets referring to the accident.

More than 5,000 Brazilians marched to the crash site on July 29, 2007, blaming their government's failure to invest in airport infrastructure for the crash. Many of the protesters also demanded the ousting of President [[Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Brazilians blame gov't for jet crash |agency=Associated Press|publisher=am New York|date=July 30, 2007|page= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal action==
On November 19, 2008, the 13,600 page police investigation was completed, which took 16 months of research to produce, during which 336 people were heard. For federal prosecutors, the former director of ANAC Denise Abreu and then flight safety officer of the company, Marco Aurelio dos Santos de Miranda, should be convicted of attempt on air transport security in willful mode. In March 2006, Denise Abreu took over the management of air services of the newly established National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC). The investigation of the Airbus TAM accident, which killed 199 people in Congonhas, revealed that in February 2007, the São Paulo federal judge Cecilia Marcondes, who saw action restricting the landing planes in Congonhas on rainy days, received Denise Abreu one of ANAC document like a standard, but it was only a technical study. According to the complaint, the study presented as standard guarantee, in theory, security in landing operations at Congonhas airport in São Paulo. The study indicated that takeoffs and landings were forbidden in Congonhas in case the track had a water depth greater than 3&amp;nbsp;mm. After the accident with the TAM plane in July 2007, it revealed that the study was not standard and thus there was no obligation to follow it. According to the testimony of federal judge Cecilia Marcondes to the Federal Public Ministry, the document was fundamental to the Federal Court to release the runway for takeoffs and landings of all equipment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afavitam.com.br{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Brazilian Federal Public Ministry (Ministério Público Federal—MPF) laid criminal charges against [[:pt:Denise Abreu|Denise Abreu]], the director of the Brazilian National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) at the time of the disaster, as well as two former TAM directors—Marco Aurélio dos Santos de Miranda, director of flight safety, and Alberto Fajerman, vice president of operations.  They were accused of neglecting air transport safety by allowing the aircraft to land in heavy rain on the notoriously short, recently resurfaced runway before cutting of grooves to channel away excess rainwater. The trial began in São Paulo in 2013.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news| author=| title=Brazil trial over plane crash that killed 199| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-23609524| publisher=[[BBC]] |date=8 August 2013|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, MPF withdrew the charges against Fajerman, for lack of evidence.&lt;ref name="MPF"&gt;{{cite web| author=MPF| title=TAM JJ3054 - MPF pede pena de até 24 anos para responsáveis por acidente aéreo que resultou na morte de 199 pessoas em 2007| url=http://www.prsp.mpf.gov.br/sala-de-imprensa/noticias_prsp/07-04-14-tam-jj3054-mpf-pede-pena-de-ate-24-anos-para-responsaveis-por-acidente-aereo-que-resultou-na-morte-de-199-pessoas-em-2007| publisher=Procuradoria da República no Estado de S.

In 2014, TAM's insurer Itaú Seguros, the company responsible for paying compensation for the tragedy, launched a lawsuit in Brazil against Airbus for [[Brazilian real|R$]]350 million (US$156.2 million), according to [[Folha de S. Paulo]].  Attorneys representing Airbus responded in a Brazilian court filing that Airbus accepts no responsibility, laying the blame for the disaster with the cockpit crew, the airline and the poor state of the runway.&lt;ref name="Fox"&gt;{{cite news| author=EFE| title=Airbus rejects any blame for deadly 2007 crash in Brazil| url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/09/01/airbus-rejects-any-blame-for-deadly-2007-crash-in-brazil/| publisher=[[Fox News Channel|FOX News Network, LLC]]| date=1 September 2014| accessdate=6 April 2015| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412215203/http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2014/09/01/airbus-rejects-any-blame-for-deadly-2007-crash-in-brazil/| archivedate=April 12, 2015| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and evolution==
 
Launched by the [[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] in cooperation with [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] in 2009, early work of the Community focused on building capacity of developing countries on fundamental issues associated with single window&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ADB–ESCAP Capacity Building Workshop on Single-Window Implementation|url = http://www.carecprogram.org/index.php?page=capacity-building-workshop-single-window-implementation }}&lt;/ref&gt; and paperless trade&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Progress of Paperless Trade in Asia and the Pacific: Enabling International Supply Chain Integration |url = https://aric.adb.org/pdf/workingpaper/WP137_Ha_Lim_Paperless_Trade.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; system development,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UNNExT|url =  http://www.unece.org/trade/unnext.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  such as business process analysis of trade procedures,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Business Process Analysis Guide to Simplify Trade Procedures|url = http://www.gfptt.org/node/2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; data harmonization,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = WCO Data Model, Single Window Data Harmonization|url = http://www.wcoomd.org/en/topics/facilitation/activities-and-programmes/single-window/~/media/E2C03EE328FC4793AF529AEE01EDAD98.ashx }}&lt;/ref&gt; and legal framework development.

Initially referred to as the UN Network of Experts for Paperless Trade in Asia-Pacific “Transport” was added to the full name of the network in 2014 in recognition of the importance of transit facilitation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Transit Facilitation for Regional Economic Integration and Competitiveness|url = http://www.wcoomd.org/en/topics/research/activities-and%20programmes/~/media/30EA73887EED41E1A3E774175C7FE097.ashx}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transport-related procedures for the many landlocked developing countries members of ESCAP, particularly those in Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cross-border Facilitation and Transit for Landlocked Developing Countries|url = http://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/pub_2399-1_ch10.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking into account the importance of [[small and medium-sized enterprises]] and agriculture for the sustainable and inclusive development of the region,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Agriculture’s Role For Sustainable and Inclusive Development |url = http://mts.asu.lt/mtsrbid/article/viewFile/880/897 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; recent work of the Network has increasingly focused on these two sectors since 2012.

With the growing interest and investment of Governments in the development of national single window and related paperless trade systems, addressing the issue of system [[interoperability]] and the need to enable electronic exchange and legal recognition of data and documents across borders has become more pressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Essential Legal Elements for the Implementation of a National Single Window|url = http://unnext.unescap.org/pub/tipub2636-part2.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; A UNNExT Advisory Group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UNNExT Advisory Group on Cross-border Paperless Trade Facilitation|url = https://unnext.unescap.org/content/advisory-group-cross-border-paperless-trade-facilitation }}&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to this issue was set up in 2013 and provided significant support in the development of the “Framework Agreement on Facilitation of Cross-Border Paperless Trade in Asia and the Pacific”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Framework Agreement on Facilitation of Cross-border Paperless Trade in Asia and the Pacific|url = http://www.unescap.org/resources/framework-agreement-facilitation-cross-border-paperless-trade-asia-and-pacific }}&lt;/ref&gt; a new United Nations treaty open for signature to 53 ESCAP member states starting 1 October 2016.

The continuous demand for capacity building on paperless trade and trade facilitation has led the network to develop online training and certification programmes, with a first e-learning series on "Business Process Analysis for Trade Facilitation" launched in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = E-Learning Series on Business Process Analysis for Trade Facilitation|url = http://www.unescap.org/our-work/trade-investment-innovation/trade-facilitation/bpa-course}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As emphasized in the UNNExT-supported 7th Asia-Pacific Trade Facilitation Forum held in Wuhan, China in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UPCOMING: Asia Pacific Trade Facilitation Forum (APTFF) 2015, Wuhan, China, 20-21 October 2015 |url = http://www.gfptt.org/node/7510 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there are strong linkages between paperless trade and [[e-commerce]] and future work of the network is expected to address procedural bottlenecks to cross-border e-commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cross-border Ecommerce |url = http://www.crossborder-ecommerce.com/| website=Crossborder-Ecommerce.com | access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2008-07-11 Air conditioners at UNC-CH.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Air conditioning]] units use [[electricity]] which ends up as [[heat]]]]

'''Waste heat''' is heat that is produced by a [[machine]], or other process that uses [[energy]], as a byproduct of doing [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]]. All such processes give off some waste heat as a fundamental result of the [[laws of thermodynamics]]. Waste heat has lower utility (or in thermodynamics lexicon a lower [[exergy]] or higher [[entropy]]) than the original energy source.  Sources of waste heat include all manner of human activities,  natural systems, and all organisms, for example, a refrigerator warms the room air, an [[internal combustion engine]] generates high-temperature exhaust gases, and electronic components get warm when in operation.

Instead of being "wasted" by release into the ambient environment, sometimes waste heat (or cold) can be utilized by another process (such as using hot engine coolant to heat a vehicle), or a portion of heat that would otherwise be wasted can be reused in the same process if make-up heat is added to the system (as with [[heat recovery ventilation]] in a building).

[[Thermal energy storage]], which includes technologies both for short- and long-term retention of heat or cold, can create or improve the utility of waste heat (or cold).  One example is waste heat from air conditioning machinery stored in a buffer tank to aid in night time heating. Another is [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES) at a foundry in Sweden.  The heat is stored in the bedrock surrounding a cluster of heat exchanger equipped boreholes, and is used for space heating in an adjacent factory as needed, even months later.&lt;ref&gt;Andersson, O.; Hägg, M. (2008), [http://www.saunier-associes.com/igeia/docs/documents/projectPublications/D10-FeasabilityStudies.pdf  "Deliverable 10 - Sweden - Preliminary design of a seasonal heat storage for ITT Flygt, Emmaboda, Sweden"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}, IGEIA – Integration of geothermal energy into industrial applications, pp. 38–56 and 72–76, retrieved 21 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; An example of using STES to utilize natural waste heat is the [[Drake Landing Solar Community]] in [[Alberta]], Canada, which, by using a cluster of boreholes in bedrock for interseasonal heat storage, obtains 97 percent of its year-round heat from solar thermal collectors on the garage roofs.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Bill (June 28, 2011), [http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf "Drake Landing Solar Community"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030520/http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, IDEA/CDEA District Energy/CHP 2011 Conference, Toronto, pp. 1–30, retrieved 21 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong B., Thornton J.

On a biological scale, all organisms reject waste heat as part of their [[Metabolism|metabolic processes]], and will die if the ambient temperature is too high to allow this.

Anthropogenic waste heat is thought by some to contribute to the [[urban heat island]] effect. The biggest point sources of waste heat originate from machines (such as electrical generators or industrial processes, such as steel or glass production) and heat loss through building envelopes.  The burning of transport fuels is a major contribution to waste heat.

==Conversion of energy==
{{See also|Second law of thermodynamics}}
Machines [[energy conversion|converting energy]] contained in [[fuels]] to [[mechanical work]] or [[electric energy]] produce heat as a by-product.

==Sources==
In the majority of energy applications, energy is required in multiple forms.  These energy forms typically include some combination of: [[HVAC|heating, ventilation, and air conditioning]], [[mechanical energy]] and [[electric power]].  Often, these additional forms of energy are produced by a [[heat engine]], running on a source of high-temperature heat.  A heat engine can never have perfect efficiency, according to the [[second law of thermodynamics]], therefore a heat engine will always produce a surplus of low-temperature heat.  This is commonly referred to as waste heat or "secondary heat", or "low-grade heat".  This heat is useful for the majority of heating applications, however, it is sometimes not practical to transport heat energy over long distances, unlike electricity or fuel energy.
The largest proportions of total waste heat are from [[power stations]] and vehicle engines.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}  The largest single sources are power stations and industrial plants such as [[oil refineries]] and [[steelmaking]] plants.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Power generation===
The [[electrical efficiency]] of [[thermal power plant]]s is defined as the ratio between the input and output energy. It is typically only 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/07/03/energy-efficiency-cogeneration-biz-energy_cx_jz_0707efficiency_horror.html | work=Forbes | title=The Most Efficient Power Plants | date=2008-07-07 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220045953/http://www.forbes.com/2008/07/03/energy-efficiency-cogeneration-biz-energy_cx_jz_0707efficiency_horror.html | archivedate=2016-12-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The images show [[cooling tower]]s which allow power stations to maintain the low side of the temperature difference essential for conversion of heat differences to other forms of energy. Discarded or "Waste" heat that is lost to the environment may instead be used to advantage.

[[File:Coal power plant Datteln 2 Crop1.png|thumb|right|[[Coal-fired power station]] that transform chemical energy into 36%-48% electricity and remaining 52%-64% to waste heat]]

===Industrial processes===
Industrial processes, such as [[oil refining]], [[steel making]] or [[glass making]] are major sources of waste heat.

===Electronics===
Although small in terms of power, the disposal of waste heat from [[Integrated circuit|microchips]] and other electronic components, represents a significant engineering challenge. This necessitates the use of fans, [[heatsinks]], etc. to dispose of the heat. 

For example, data centers use electronic components that consume electricity for computing, storage and networking. The French [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]] explains a data center is like a resistance and most of the energy it consumes is transformed into heat and requires cooling systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.cnrs.fr/articles/new-technologies-wasted-energies|title=New Technologies' Wasted Energies|website=CNRS News|language=en|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological===
Animals, including humans, create heat as a result of [[metabolism]].  In warm conditions, this heat exceeds a level required for [[homeostasis]] in [[warm-blooded]] animals, and is disposed of by various [[thermoregulation]] methods such as [[sweating]] and [[Thermoregulation|panting]].  Fiala ''et al.'' modelled human thermoregulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fiala D, Lomas KJ, Stohrer M |title=A computer model of human thermoregulation for a wide range of environmental conditions: the passive system |journal=J. Appl. Physiol. |volume=87 |issue=5 |pages=1957–72 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10562642 |url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10562642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RatcliffePowerPlantBlackAndWhite.jpg|thumb|[[Cooling tower]]s evaporating water at [[Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station]], [[United Kingdom]].]]

==Disposal==
Low temperature heat contains very little capacity to do work ([[Exergy]]), so the heat is qualified as waste heat and rejected to the environment. Economically most convenient is the rejection of such heat to water from a [[sea]], [[lake]] or [[river]]. If sufficient cooling water is not available, the plant has to be equipped with a [[cooling tower]] to reject the waste heat into the atmosphere.
In some cases it is possible to use waste heat, for instance in heating homes by [[cogeneration]]. However, by slowing the release of the waste heat, these systems always entail a reduction of efficiency for the primary user of the heat energy.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Uses==

===Cogeneration and trigeneration===
Waste of the by-product heat is reduced if a [[cogeneration]] system is used, also known as a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system. Limitations to the use of by-product heat arise primarily from the engineering cost/efficiency challenges in effectively exploiting small temperature differences to generate other forms of energy.  Applications utilizing waste heat include [[swimming pool]] heating and [[paper mills]]. In some cases, cooling can also be produced by the use of [[absorption refrigerator]]s for example, in this case it's called [[trigeneration]] or CCHP (combined cooling, heat and power).

===Pre-heating===
Waste heat can be forced to heat incoming fluids and objects before being highly heated. For instance outgoing water can give its waste heat to incoming water in a [[heat exchanger]] before heating in homes or [[power plant]]s.

===Electrification of waste heat===
There are many different approaches to transfer thermal energy to electricity, and the technologies to do so have existed for several decades. The [[organic Rankine cycle]], offered by companies such as [[Ormat]], is a very known approach, whereby an organic substance is used as [[working medium]] instead of water.  The benefit is that this process can reject heat at lower temperatures for the production of electricity than the regular water steam cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/handle/2268/138756|title=Techno-economic survey of Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) systems|first1=Sylvain|last1=Quoilin|first2=Martijn Van Den|last2=Broek|first3=Sébastien|last3=Declaye|first4=Pierre|last4=Dewallef|first5=Vincent|last5=Lemort|date=1 June 2013|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=22|pages=168–186|accessdate=7 May 2018|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2013.01.028|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003175138/http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/handle/2268/138756|archivedate=3 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of use of the steam [[Rankine cycle]] is the [[Cyclone Waste Heat Engine]].
Another established approach is by using a [[thermoelectric]], such as those offered by [[Alphabet Energy]], where a change in temperature across a semiconductor material creates a voltage through a phenomenon known as the [[Seebeck effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/06/070603225026.htm|title=A Sound Way To Turn Heat Into Electricity|author=|date=|website=sciencedaily.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901022511/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/06/070603225026.htm|archivedate=1 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related approach is the use of [[thermogalvanic cell]]s, where a temperature difference gives rise to an electric current in an electrochemical cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gunawan | first1 = A | last2 = Lin | first2 = CH | last3 = Buttry | first3 = DA | last4 = Mujica | first4 = V | last5 = Taylor | first5 = RA | last6 = Prasher | first6 = RS | last7 = Phelan | first7 = PE | year = 2013 | title = Liquid thermoelectrics: review of recent and limited new data of thermogalvanic cell experiments | url = | journal = Nanoscale Microscale Thermophys Eng | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 304–23 | doi = 10.1080/15567265.2013.776149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthropogenic heat==
[[File:ANTHROPOGENIC HEAT.png|thumb|150px|Anthropogenic heat]]
Anthropogenic heat is heat generated by humans and human activity. The [[American Meteorological Society]] defines it as "Heat released to the atmosphere as a result of human activities, often involving combustion of fuels. Sources include industrial plants, space heating and cooling, human metabolism, and vehicle exhausts. In cities this source typically contributes 15–50 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to the local heat balance, and several hundred W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the center of large cities in cold climates and industrial areas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/browse?s=a&amp;p=60 | title=Glossary of Meteorology | publisher=[[American Meteorological Society|AMS]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226045247/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/browse?s=a&amp;p=60 | archivedate=2009-02-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] heat generation can be made by totaling all the [[energy]] used for heating and cooling, running appliances, transportation, and industrial processes, plus that directly emitted by human [[metabolism]].

===Environmental impact===
Anthropogenic heat is a small influence on rural temperatures, and becomes more significant in dense [[Urban area|urban]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/heatisland/resources/glossary.htm|title=Heat Island Effect: Glossary|year=2009|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|accessdate=2009-04-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420122840/http://epa.gov/heatisland/resources/glossary.htm|archivedate=2009-04-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one contributor to [[urban heat island]]s. Other human-caused effects (such as changes to [[albedo]], or loss of evaporative cooling) that might contribute to urban heat islands are not considered to be [[anthropogenic heat]] by this definition.

Anthropogenic heat is a much smaller contributor to [[global warming]] than are [[greenhouse gas]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/2015GL063514 | volume=42 | issue=11 | title=Time scales and ratios of climate forcing due to thermal versus carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels | journal=Geophysical Research Letters | pages=4548–4555 | last1 = Zhang | first1 = Xiaochun| bibcode=2015GeoRL..42.4548Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, although anthropogenic waste heat flux was significantly high in certain urban areas (and can be high regionally. For example, waste heat flux was +0.39 and +0.68 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for the continental United States and western Europe, respectively) globally it accounted for only 1% of the [[energy flux]] created by anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Global forcing from waste heat was 0.028 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 2005. This statistic is predicted to rise as urban areas become more widespread.&lt;ref name=flanner&gt;{{cite journal| author=Flanner, M.

Although waste heat has been shown to have influence on regional climates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2004/2004GL019852.shtml |author=Block, A., K. Keuler, and E.

Equilibrium climate experiments show statistically significant continental-scale surface warming (0.4–0.9&amp;nbsp;°C) produced by one 2100 AHF scenario, but not by current or 2040 estimates.&lt;ref name=flanner /&gt; Simple global-scale estimates with different growth rates of anthropogenic heat&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Döpel|R.

For example, a 2% p.a. growth rate of waste heat resulted in a 3 degree increase as a lower limit for the year 2300. Meanwhile, this has been confirmed by more refined model calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chaisson | first1 = E.

One research showed that if antropogenic heat emissions continue to rise in current rate, they will became a source of warming as strong as GHG emmisions in 21 century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cowern |first1=Nick E.B. |last2=Ahn |first2=Chihak |title=Thermal emissions and climate change: Cooler options for future energy technology |journal=Cowern Science |date=November 2008 |url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0811/0811.0476.pdf |accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''World Soil Museum''' (WSM) displays physical examples of [[soil]] profiles ([[monoliths]]) representing major [[soil]] types of the world, from the [[volcanic ash]] soils from [[Indonesia]] to the red, strongly weathered soils from the [[River Amazon|Amazon]] region. The [[museum]] is managed by '''[http://www.isric.org ISRIC - World Soil Information]''', legally registered as the International Soil Reference and Information Centre (ISRIC), an independent, science-based foundation. Physically, the museum is located on the campus of [[Wageningen University and Research Centre]] in [[Wageningen]], The Netherlands. 

The WSM (originally known as International Soil Museum) was created in 1996 at the  request of the '''[https://en.unesco.org/ United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]''' and the '''[https://www.iuss.org/ International Society of Soil Science (ISSS)]''' (now IUSS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Records of the General Conference, 13th Session, 1964|url=https://www.isric.org/sites/default/files/Resolutions_UNESCO_Gen_Conf_1964.pdf|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a view to underpin the development of the FAO-UNESCO 'Soil Map of the World' [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAO_soil_classification]. The initial ISM building was located at the University of Utrecht.

Some 80 soil monoliths are on display in the WSM, with a much larger collection (some 1000 from over 70 countries) stored and maintained in our repository. For each soil monolith, there is supplemental information about the site of sampling (e.g. landscape, land use, parent material and climate), a detailed profile description for each soil horizon or layer, and data on chemical compositions and physical features. The museum displays examples of the main (32) WRB Soil Reference Groups of the World. A special section is devoted to the major soil types of Netherlands. Further, it showcases soils that have changed significantly under the influence of long-term human activity.&lt;ref name="World Soil Museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=World Soil Museum|url=http://www.isric.org/explore/world-soil-museum|publisher=International Soil Reference and Information Centre|accessdate= 15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of this information can also be viewed online[http://wsm.isric.org/#tourGoogle/]. The WSM plays an important role in ISRIC's educational and outreach programme, and is an important component of ISRIC's Annual Spring School on worls soils and teir assessment.[http://www.isric.org/utilise/capacity-building/springschool/general].

Recent developments at ISRIC are succinctly described in a series of Annual Highlights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author-last1=ISRIC|year=2018|title=Highlights 2016-2017|pages= 16| url=https://www.isric.org/sites/default/files/isric_highlights_2016_2017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author-last1=ISRIC|year=2016|title=Highlights 2014-2015|pages= 9| url=http://library.wur.nl/isric/fulltext/isricu_i34285_001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author-last1=ISRIC|year=2014|title=Highlights 2012-2013|pages= 12| url=http://library.wur.nl/isric/fulltext/isricu_i34286_001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
