[[File:1st parallel GNQ.png|thumb|The 1st parallel north defines most of [[Equatorial Guinea]]'s southern border with [[Gabon]].]]
The '''1st parallel north''' is a [[circle of latitude]] that is 1 [[degree (angle)|degree]] [[true north|north]] of the [[Earth|Earth's]] [[equator|equatorial plane]].  It crosses the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Africa]], the [[Indian Ocean]], [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[South America]].

The parallel defines part of the border between [[Equatorial Guinea]] and [[Gabon]].

'''''7000 Oaks{{spaced ndash}} City Forestation Instead of City Administration''''' ({{lang-de|'''7000 Eichen{{spaced ndash}} Stadtverwaldung statt Stadtverwaltung'''}}) is a work of [[land art]] by the [[Germans|German]] artist [[Joseph Beuys]]. It was first publicly presented in 1982 at the [[documenta|documenta 7]].

==The project==
With the help of volunteers, Beuys planted 7,000 [[oak]] trees over several years in [[Kassel]], [[Germany]], each with an accompanying [[basalt]] stone. In response to the extensive urbanization of the setting the work was an long and large-scale artistic and ecological intervention with the goal of enduringly altering the living space of the city. The project, though at first controversial, has become an important part of Kassel's cityscape.

[[File:Eiche und BasaltsÃ¤ule, Joseph Beuys, DÃ¼sseldorf (1).jpg|thumbnail|left|The artwork, circa 2008.]]

The project was of enormous scope, and met with some controversy. While the biggest difficulty of the project was raising the money, the project had its share of opponents. Much of it was political, from the conservative state government dominated by the Christian Democrats. (The mayor of Kassel was a social democrat who stood by Beuys). Some people thought the black stone markers were ugly, even piling pink stones on the sites in 1982 as a prank. Also, a motorcyclist had died as a result of one of the stone markers. However, as more trees were planted people's perception of the project as a parking lot destroyer had met with increasing tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.7000eichen.de/stiftung/nemeczek.html |title=Stiftung 7000 Eichen . Stadtverwaldung statt Verwaltung . Ein Joseph Beuys Projekt |publisher=7000eichen.de |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

âI think the tree is an element of regeneration which in itself is a concept of time. The oak is especially so because it is a slowly growing tree with a kind of really solid heart wood. It has always been a form of sculpture, a symbol for this planet ever since the Druids, who are called after the oak. Druid means oak. They used their oaks to define their holy places. I can see such a use for the future.... The tree planting enterprise provides a very simple but radical possibility for this when we start with the seven thousand oaks.â (Joseph Beuys in conversation with Richard Demarco, 1982 )

"The planting of seven thousand oak trees is only a symbolic beginning. Contrary to its initiative, progressive features such a symbolic beginning requires a marker, in this instance a basalt column. Future goals for the project included: a) an ongoing scheme of tree planting to be extended throughout the world as part of a global mission to effect environmental &amp; social change "the purpose of educational activities"; b) a growth of awareness within the urban environment of the human dependence on the larger ecosystem educational outreach ; and c) an ongoing process whereby the society would be activated by means of human creative will social sculpture."

Beuys' art works and performances are not about entertaining and amusing the audience. It is an awakening message from the tradition, a recognition of the whole based upon a new concept of beauty that extends beyond the instant gratification.

"I not only want to stimulate people, I want to provoke them." (Bastian, Heines and Jeannot Simmen, "Interview with Joseph Beuys," in the catalog exhibition, Joseph Beuys, Drawings, Victoria and Albert Museum, Westerham Press, 1983, no folio)

It is a movement from the tradition, the expected, and the established for an inclusive openness. Completed in 1987 by his son, Wenzel, on the first anniversary of his father's death (and included in [[documenta|documenta 8]]), the project is still maintained by the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkerart.org/archive/E/A24315825E9BEAE26130.htm |title=Joseph Beuys and his 7000 Oaks|accessdate=2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legacy ===
Beuys' ''7000 Oaks'' work is an example of the thread that links the [[Situationist International|Situationist International's]] approach to art and its re-creation by new groups continues to evolve through a new generation of socially conscious organizations that merge art, education, and environmental issues in their work. In 2000, the [[Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture]] (out of the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]]) developed the [[Joseph Beuys Sculpture Park]] and Joseph Beuys Tree Partnership and planted over 350 trees in various parks in Baltimore Parks with the help of over 500 volunteers including children from local schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umbc.edu/cadvc/exhibitions/beuys.php |title=CADVC: Exhibitions : Beuys Sculpture Park |publisher=Umbc.edu |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was organized around Beuys' philosophy that âeveryone can be an artistâ by acknowledging the creativity inherent in volunteers planting trees on their own. The goal of the project was also to âextend the traditional role of the art gallery so the gallery extends out into the cityâ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJXlZz4vVx4 |title=Joseph Beuys Tree Partnership |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-02-13 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3952">The '''Abii''' ({{lang-grc|á¼Î²Î¹Î¿Î¹}}) were possibly an ancient people described by several ancient authors. They were placed by [[Ptolemy]] in the extreme north of [[Scythia|Scythia extra Imaum]], near the [[Hippophagi]] ("horse eaters"); but there are very different opinions about whether they existed. [[Strabo]] discourses on the various opinions respecting the Abii up to his time.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, Book VII, Chapter 3, verses 2-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Iliad]],&lt;ref&gt;Il. 13.5, 13.6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] represents [[Zeus]], on the summit of [[Mount Ida]], as turning away his eyes from the battle before the Greek camp, and looking down upon the land of the Thracians: ÎÏÏá¿¶Î½ Ïá¾½ á¼Î³ÏÎµÎ¼Î¬ÏÏÎ½, ÎºÎ±á½¶ á¼Î³Î±Ïá¿¶Î½ á¼±ÏÏÎ·Î¼Î¿Î»Î³á¿¶Î½, Î³Î»Î±ÎºÏÎ¿ÏÎ¬Î³ÏÎ½, á¼Î²Î¯ÏÎ½ ÏÎ­ Î´Î¹ÎºÎ±Î¹Î¿ÏÎ¬ÏÏÎ½ á¼Î½Î¸ÏÏÏÏÎ½. Ancient and modern commentators have doubted greatly which of these words to take as proper names, except the first two, which nearly all agree to refer to the [[Mysians]] of Thrace. The fact would seem to be that the poet had heard accounts of the great nomadic peoples who inhabited the steppes northwest and north of the [[Euxine]] (the Black Sea), whose whole wealth lay in their herds, especially of horses, on the milk of which they lived, and who were supposed to preserve the innocence of a state of nature; and of them, therefore, he speaks collectively by epithets suited to such descriptions, and, among the rest, as á¼Î²Î¹Î¿Î¹, poor, with scanty means of life (from á¼- and ÎÎ¯Î¿Ï).&lt;ref&gt;For more information, see {{Wiktionary-inline|á¼-}} and {{Wiktionary-inline|Î²Î¯Î¿Ï}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The people thus described answer to the later notions respecting the [[Hyperboreans]], whose name does not occur in Homer. Afterwards, the epithets applied by Homer to this supposed primitive people were taken as proper names, and were assigned to different tribes of the Scythians, so that we have mention of the Scythae Agavi, Hippemolgi, Galactophagi (and Galactopotae) and Abii. The last are mentioned as a distinct people by [[Aeschylus]], who prefixes a guttural to the name, and describes the ''Gabii'' as the most just and hospitable of men, living on the self-sown fruits of the untilled earth; but we have no indication of where he placed them. Of those commentators, who take the word in Homer for a proper name, some place them in Thrace, some in Scythia, and some near the (also fabulous) [[Amazons]], who in vain urged them to take part in an expedition against Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustath.]] ''ad Il.''; [[Stephanus of Byzantium|Steph. Byz.]], ''s.v.'' á¼Î²Î¹Î¿Î¹.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Like the correspondent fabulous people, the Hyperborei, the locations of the Abii seem to have been moved back, as knowledge advanced, further and further into the unknown regions of the north. In the histories of Alexander's expedition we are told that ambassadors came to him at Maracanda ([[Samarkand]]) from the Abii Scythae, a tribe who had been independent since the time of Cyrus, and were renowned for their just and peaceful character;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]], ''[[The Anabasis of Alexander]]'' 4.1; [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]], ''[[Histories of Alexander the Great]]'', 7.6&lt;/ref&gt; but the specific name of the tribe of Scythians who sent this embassy is probably only an instance of the attempts made to illustrate the old mythical geography by Alexander's conquests. In these accounts their precise locality is not indicated: [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] places them north of [[Hyrcania]].&lt;ref&gt;''Res Gestae'', 23.6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] places them on an otherwise unidentified eponymously-named river, the [[Abianus]], that drains to the Euxine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium|Steph. Byz.]], ''s.v.'' á¼Î²Î¹Î¿Î¹.&lt;/ref&gt;

It gathers data on areas such as land usage, climate conditions and it also locates natural resources. One major usage of this system has been to provide flood warnings to governments and [[NGOs]], who then pass the information onto farmers.

[[File:Baarle-Nassau frontiÃ¨re cafÃ©.jpg|230px|right|thumb|none|Border between Netherlands and Belgium in Baarle-Nassau.]]

'''Baarle-Nassau''' ({{pronunciation|174 Baarle-Nassau.ogg}}) is a [[municipality]] and town in the southern [[Netherlands]], located in province of [[North Brabant]]. It had a population of {{formatnum:{{Dutch municipality population|Baarle-Nassau}}}} in {{YEAR|{{Dutch municipality population|popbaseyear}}}}. The town is the site of a complicated borderline between [[Belgium]] and Netherlands, with  numerous small [[exclave]]s of Belgium, some of which contain counter-exclaves of the Netherlands.

==Geography==

===Topography===
[[File:Gem-Baarle-Nassau-OpenTopo.jpg|550px]]

''Topographic map of the municipality of Baarle-Nassau, June 2015.''

===The border with Baarle-Hertog, Belgium===
Baarle-Nassau is closely linked, with complicated borders, to the Belgian exclaves of [[Baarle-Hertog]].  Baarle-Hertog consists of 26 separate pieces of land. Apart from the main piece (called ''Zondereigen'') located north of the Belgian town of [[Merksplas]], there are 22 Belgian exclaves in the Netherlands and three other pieces on the Dutch-Belgian border. There are also six Dutch exclaves located within the largest Belgian exclave, one within the second-largest, and an eighth within Zondereigen. The smallest Belgian parcel, H7, locally named De Loversche Akkers, measures {{convert|2,469|m2|sqft}}.

The border's complexity results from numerous medieval treaties, agreements, land-swaps and sales between the Lords of [[Breda]] and the Dukes of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. Generally speaking, predominantly agricultural or built environments became constituents of Brabant, while other parts devolved to Breda. These distributions were ratified and clarified as a part of the borderline settlements arrived at during the [[Treaty of Maastricht (1843)|Treaty of Maastricht]] in 1843.

For clarification and the interest of tourists, the border is made visible on all streets with iron pins. This way it is always clear whether one is in Belgium (Baarle-Hertog) or in The Netherlands (Baarle-Nassau). This is also visible on the house numbers: the style of house numbers is different in both countries and often one will find the Dutch or Belgian flag next to the number.

[[File:Baarle-Nassau - Baarle-Hertog-en.svg|none|365px|thumb|The border between Belgium and the Netherlands at Baarle-Nassau]]

Outside of Belgium and the Netherlands, there is at least one other national [[Enclaves and exclaves#Enclaves within enclaves|counter-exclave]] (enclave enclosed within an enclave) at [[Nahwa]], an enclave of the [[United Arab Emirates]] within an enclave of the [[Sultanate of Oman]] within the United Arab Emirates.

The '''''British Society for Geomorphology''''' (BSG), incorporating the '''British Geomorphological Research Group''' (BGRG), is the professional organisation for British [[geomorphologist]]s and provides a community and services for those involved in teaching or research in geomorphology, both in the UK and overseas. The societyâs journal, ''[[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]]'' is published by Wiley-Blackwell and online access is available free to members.

== Mission ==
The mission of the British Society for Geomorphology is to support scientific excellence in geomorphology through:

* fostering excellence and increased investment and support for geomorphology
* developing applied geomorphological research, having a major impact on environmental policy and practice and providing a public benefit
* disseminating new geomorphological research and policy agendas
* developing a new generation of geomorphologists equipped to address interdisciplinary challenges.

==Annual General Meeting and Conference==
The Annual Conference of the British Society for Geomorphology (BSG) is an international Open Conference. This Annual Meeting stimulates debate on new developments and advances in Geomorphology, and is a forum for emerging approaches to solve key challenges throughout pure and applied Geomorphology.

The Annual Conference for 2019 will be held at the University of Sheffield, 9 - 11 September. &lt;br /&gt;

==''Earth Surface Processes and Landforms''==
''[[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]]'' is the flagship international journal of the BSG, edited by Stuart Lane (Managing Editor) and five Associate Editors. The Journal publishes original research papers, Earth Surface Exchanges (shorter articles, commentaries, reviews and discussion papers) for rapid publication, technical communications and book reviews across all branches of geomorphology. In July 2017, the revised impact factor for the journal rose to 3.722 (articles published in 2017).

==History==
The BSG can trace its beginnings back to a meeting in Sheffield in 1958 where British geomorphologists gathered together to organise a Landform Survey of Britain. By 1959 this group appears to have been referring to itself as the British Universities Geomorphological Research Group. This short-lived group agreed, at its second annual meeting, to disband itself and voted unanimously (all 19 of them) to constitute the British Geomorphological Research Group (BGRG). The first BGRG AGM was held on 1 October 1960.

Morphological mapping schemes, emphasising slope, were the subject for discussion at early meetings of the BGRG. Time-consuming to undertake, such schemes produced information about form but not about the processes or the origin of land forms. These schemes evolved in the 1970s to produce geomorphological maps of the UK. Several articles published in the ''[[Geographical Magazine]]'' in 1975 and 1976 explained the landform maps produced for all parts of Britain. In 1985 the BGRG celebrated its first twenty five years by hosting the first International Geomorphology Conference in Manchester which led to the formation of the International Association of Geomorphology.

In 2000, 40 years of the BGRG were celebrated by returning to Sheffield. Of those 19 geomorphologists who, by their action, can be regarded as the founders of the BGRG, which now has an international membership of around 700, nine attended this 40th Anniversary Meeting. One of them, Tony Orme, presented the Frost Lecture.

In 2006 the BGRG changed its name to British Society for Geomorphology (BSG). The new Constitution stated that the object of the Society shall be the advancement of the science of geomorphology, in research, in all levels of education, and in its practical application.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3620">In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], [[covariance]] is a measure of how much two variables change together, and the '''covariance function''', or '''kernel''', describes the spatial or temporal covariance of a random variable process or field. For a [[random field]] or [[stochastic process]] ''Z''(''x'') on a domain ''D'', a covariance function ''C''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') gives the covariance of the values of the random field at the two locations ''x'' and ''y'':

:&lt;math&gt;C(x,y):=\operatorname{cov}(Z(x),Z(y)).\,&lt;/math&gt;

The same ''C''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') is called the [[autocovariance]] function in two instances: in [[time series]] (to denote exactly the same concept except that ''x'' and ''y'' refer to locations in time rather than in space), and in multivariate random fields (to refer to the covariance of a variable with itself, as opposed to the [[cross covariance]] between two different variables at different locations, ''Cov''(''Z''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;),&amp;nbsp;''Y''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;))).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Multivariate Geostatistics|first=Hans|last=Wackernagel|year=2003|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Admissibility ==
For locations ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; ''D'' the variance of every linear combination

:&lt;math&gt;X=\sum_{i=1}^N w_i Z(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;

can be computed as

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{var}(X)=\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^N w_i C(x_i,x_j) w_j.&lt;/math&gt;

A function is a valid covariance function if and only if&lt;ref name="Cressie"&gt;{{cite book|title=Statistics for Spatial Data|first=Noel A.C.|last=Cressie|year=1993|publisher=Wiley-Interscience}}&lt;/ref&gt; this variance is non-negative for all possible choices of ''N'' and weights ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip;,&amp;nbsp;''w''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;. A function with this property is called [[Positive-definite kernel|positive definite]].

== Simplifications with stationarity ==
In case of a weakly [[Stationary process|stationary]] [[random field]], where

:&lt;math&gt;C(x_i,x_j)=C(x_i+h,x_j+h)\,&lt;/math&gt;

for any lag ''h'', the covariance function can be represented by a one-parameter function

:&lt;math&gt;C_s(h)=C(0,h)=C(x,x+h)\,&lt;/math&gt;

which is called a ''covariogram'' and also a ''covariance function''. Implicitly the ''C''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) can be computed from ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''h'') by:

:&lt;math&gt;C(x,y)=C_s(y-x).\,&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Positive-definite function|positive definiteness]] of this single-argument version of the covariance function can be checked by [[Bochner's theorem]].&lt;ref name="Cressie"/&gt;

== Parametric families of covariance functions ==

A simple stationary parametric covariance function is the "exponential covariance function"

:&lt;math&gt;
C(d) = \exp(-d/V)
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is a scaling parameter, and ''d''=''d''(''x'',''y'') is the distance between two points.  Sample paths of a [[Gaussian process]] with the exponential covariance function are not smooth.  The "squared exponential covariance function"

:&lt;math&gt;
C(d) = \exp(-(d/V)^2)
&lt;/math&gt;

is a stationary covariance function with smooth sample paths.

The [[MatÃ©rn covariance function]] and [[rational quadratic covariance function]] are two parametric families of stationary covariance functions.  The MatÃ©rn family includes the exponential and squared exponential covariance functions as special cases.

'''Dalmatia''' was a [[Roman province]]. Its name is derived from the name of an [[Illyrians|Illyrian tribe]] called the [[Dalmatae]], which lived in the central area of the eastern coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]]. It encompassed the northern part of present-day [[Albania]], much of [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Serbia]], thus covering an area significantly larger than the current Croatian region of [[Dalmatia]]. Originally this region was called [[Illyria]] (in Greek) or Illyricum (in Latin).

The province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] was dissolved and replaced by two separate provinces: Dalmatia and [[Pannonia]].

== History ==
{{Long section|date=October 2018}}
The region which run along the coast of the Adriatic Sea and extended inland on the [[Dinaric Alps]] was called [[Illyria]] by the Greeks. Originally the Romans also called it Illyria. Later they called it Illyricum. The Romans fought three [[Illyrian Wars]] (229 BC, 219/8 BC and 168 BC) mainly against the kingdom of the Ardiaei in the south of the region. In 168 BC they abolished this kingdom, divided it into three republics.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, The History of Rome, 45.26.11-15&lt;/ref&gt; The area became a Roman protectorate. The central and northern area of the region engaged in piracy and raided north-eastern Italy. In response to this, Octavian (who later became the emperor [[Augustus]]) conducted a series of campaigns in Illyricum (35-33 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Appian, The Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars, 10.18-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 48.11,, 49.37-38&lt;/ref&gt; The area became the Roman province of Illyricum probably in 27 BC. It was a senatorial provinces. Due to troubles in the northern part of the region in 16-10 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 54. 24.3, 28.1-2 31.2-3, 36.2 3, 55.2.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History, 2.96.2â3&lt;/ref&gt; it became an imperial province. The administrative organisation of Illyricum was carried out late in the reign of Augustus (27 BC-14 AD) and early in the reign of [[Tiberius]] (14- 37 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, Natural History, 2.25-26, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Octavian having subdued the more inland region of [[Pannonia]] (along the mid-course of the River [[Danube]]), the Romans changed the name of the coastal area to Dalmatia. Illyricum was composed of Dalmatia and Pannonia. The earliest writing which indicates that the province of Illyricum comprised Dalmatia and Pannonia is the mention by [[Velleius Paterculus]] of Gaius Vibius Postumus as the military commander of Dalmatia under Germanicus in 9 AD, towards the end of the Batonian War.&lt;ref&gt;Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History, 2.116.3&lt;/ref&gt; In 6-9 AD there was a large scale rebellion in the province of Illyricum, the [[Bellum Batonianum]] (Batonian War).&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 55.29-32. 34.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The province of Illyricum was eventually dissolved and replaced by two smaller provinces: Dalmatia (the southern area) and Pannonia (the northern and Danubian area). It is unclear when this happened. KovÃ¡c noted that an inscription on the base of a statue of Nero erected between 54 and 68 AD attests that it was erected by the veteran of a legion stationed in Pannonia and argues that this is the first epigraphic evidence that a separate Pannonia existed at least since the reign of Nero.[73][74] However, Å aÅ¡el-Kos notes that an inscription attests a governor of Illyricum under the reign of Claudius (43-51 AD) and in a military diploma published in the late 1990s, dated July 61 AD, units of auxiliaries from the Pannonian part of the province were mentioned as being stationed in Illyricum.
&lt;ref&gt;Dusanic, S., An Early Diploma Milirare, Starinar (1998) 51-62 = AE 1998, 1056 = M&lt;/ref&gt; Some other diplomas attest the same.&lt;ref&gt;Holder R., P Roman Military Diplomas IV (2003), no. 202&lt;/ref&gt; This was during the reign of Nero (51-68 AD). Therefore, Å aÅ¡el-Kos supports the notion that the province was dissolved during the reign of Vespasian (79-89 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Å aÅ¡el-Kos, Pannonia or Lower Illyricum? Tyche Beitrage zur Alten Geschichte, Paryrologie und Epigraphik, Band 25.2010, pp. 123-130&lt;/ref&gt;

In 337, when Constantine the Great died, the Roman Empire was partitioned among his sons. The empire was divided into three [[praetorian prefectures]]: the [[Praetorian prefecture of Gaul|Galliae]], [[Praetorian prefecture of Italy|Italia, Africa et Illyricum]] and [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Oriens]]. The size of the provinces  had been decreased and their number doubled by [[Diocletian]]. The provinces were also grouped in [[Roman diocese|diocese]]s. Dalmatia became one of the seven provinces of the [[diocese of Pannonia]]. Initially, it was under the praetorian preacture of Italy, Africa and Illyricum. It seems that the three dioceses of [[Diocese of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Diocese of Dacia|Dacia]] and [[Diocese of Pannonia|Pannonia]] were first grouped together in a separate [[praetorian prefecture]] in 347 by [[Constans]] by removing them from the praetorian prefecture of Italy, Africa and Illyricum (which then became the praetorian prefecture of Italy and Africa) or that this praetorian prefecture was formed in 343 when Constans appointed a prefect for Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Constantine: Dynastyr, Religion and Power in the Later Roman Empire, p. 160, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sirmium]], the future capital of the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum, was the birthplace of the Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]]. After he abdicated, he built [[Diocletian's Palace]] in [[Salona]] (modern [[Split, Croatia|Split]], [[Croatia]]).&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan,[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17691 "Diocletian's Palace"], The Megalithic Portal, Andy Burnham ed., 6 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

German historian [[Theodore Mommsen]] wrote (in his ''The Provinces of the Roman Empire'') that coastal Dalmatia and its islands were fully romanized and [[Latin]]-speaking by the 4th century.&lt;ref name="MommsenDickson1886"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Theodor Mommsen|author2=William Purdie Dickson|author3=Francis Haverfield|title=The Provinces of the Roman Empire: From Caesar to Diocletian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9e9NsG3eCB0C&amp;pg=PA203|year=1886|publisher=Gorgias Press LLC|isbn=978-1-59333-025-5|pages=203â}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ancient balkans 4thcentury.png|thumb|250px|Dalmatia in the 4th century]]
The Croatian historian [[Aleksandar StipÄeviÄ]] writes that analysis of archaeological material from that period has shown that the process of [[romanization]] was rather selective. While urban centers, both coastal and inland, were almost completely romanized, the situation in the countryside was completely different. Despite the Illyrians being subject to a strong process of acculturation, they continued to speak their native language, worship their own gods and traditions, and follow their own social-political tribal organization which was adapted to Roman administration and political structure only in some necessities.&lt;ref&gt;A. StipÄeviÄ,'' Iliri'', Å kolska knjiga Zagreb, 1974, page 70&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Last days of Roman Dalmatia and Ostrogoth takeover ===
[[File:Marcellinus Dalmatia.jpg|right|thumb|250px| Independent Dalmatia - Extent of Marcellinus' Control (454-468) and Julius Nepos' Control (468-480).]]
In 454 Marcellinus, a military commander in Dalmatia, rebelled against Valentinian III, the emperor of the west. He seized control of Dalmatia and governed it independently until his death in 468.&lt;ref&gt;Damascius,  Epitome Photiana, 91, fragments 158&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Nepos]] became the governor of Dalmatia even though he was a relative of the emperor of the east, [[Leo I the Thracian]], and Dalmatia was under the western part of the Roman empire. Dalmatia remained an autonomous area. In 474 Leo I elevated Nepos as emperor of the western part of the empire in order to depose [[Glycerius]], a usurper emperor. Nepos deposed the usurper, but was in turn deposed in 475 by Orestes, who made his son [[Romulus Augustus]] emperor in the west.&lt;ref&gt;Bury, J. B., History of the Later Roman Empire, p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; Leo I refused to recognise him and still held Julius Nepos as the emperor of the west. Romulus Augustus was deposed in 476  by [[Odoacer]], who proclaimed himself king of Italy.  Nepos remained in Dalmatia and continued to govern it until he was assassinated in 480. Ovidia, a military commander, was in charge of Dalmatia for a few months. However, Odoacer used Nepos' murder as a pretext to invade Dalmatia, defeated Ovidia and annexed Dalmatia to his kingdom of Italy. In  488 [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], the new emperor of the east, sent [[Theodoric the Great]], the king of the [[Ostrogoths]] to Italy. Zeno sent him to depose Odoacer. He also wanted to get rid of the Ostrogoths, who were Roman allies and were settled in the eastern part of the empire, but were becoming restless and difficult to manage. Theodoric fought a four-year war in Italy, killed Odoacer, settled his people in Italy and established the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, T., (1984). A History of the Ostrogoths (1984), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Dalmatia and the rest of the former diocese of Pannonia came under the Ostrogothic Kingdom.

The Dead Sea is {{convert|304|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep, the deepest [[hypersaline lake]] in the world. With a [[salinity]] of 342 g/kg, or 34.2%, (in 2011), it is 9.6 times as [[Seawater#Salinity|salty as the ocean]] and one of the [[List of bodies of water by salinity|world's saltiest bodies of water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor=Goetz, P.W. |title=''The New EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica'' (15th ed.)|volume=3|page=937|place=[[Chicago]]|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which plants and animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea's main, northern basin is {{convert|50|km|mi|0}} long and {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} wide at its widest point.&lt;ref name="JVL"/&gt; It lies in the [[Jordan Rift Valley]], and its main [[tributary]] is the [[Jordan River]].

The Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean basin]] for thousands of years. It was one of the world's first health resorts (for [[Herod the Great]]), and it has been the supplier of a wide variety of products, from asphalt for [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[mummy|mummification]] to [[potash]] for [[fertiliser]]s. People also use the salt and the minerals from the Dead Sea to create [[cosmetics]] and herbal [[Sachet (scented bag)|sachet]]s.

The Dead Sea is receding at an alarming rate. Multiple canals and pipelines were proposed to reduce its recession, which had begun causing many problems. The [[Red SeaâDead Sea Water Conveyance]] project, carried out by [[Jordan]], will provide water to neighbouring countries, while the brine will be carried to the Dead Sea to help stabilise its levels. The first phase of the project is scheduled to begin in 2018 and be completed in 2021.&lt;ref name="JT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/5-alliances-shortlisted-execute-red-dead%E2%80%99s-phase-i|title=5 alliances shortlisted to execute Red-Deadâs phase I|accessdate=3 December 2016|date=27 November 2016|work=The Jordan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and toponymy==
In Hebrew, the Dead Sea is ''{{Audio|He-Dead Sea.ogg|YÄm ha-Melaá¸¥}}'' ({{Hebrew|×× ××××}}), meaning "sea of [[salt]]" ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 14:3). The Bible uses this term alongside two others: the Sea of the Arabah (''{{transl|he|YÄm ha-âÄrÄvÃ¢}}'' {{Hebrew|×× ××¢×¨××}}), and the Eastern Sea (''{{transl|he|YÄm ha-Mizraá¸¥Ã®}}'' {{Hebrew|×× ××××¨××}}). The designation "Dead Sea" never appears in the Bible.

In prose sometimes the term ''{{transl|he|YÄm ha-MÄvet}}'' ({{Hebrew|×× ×××××ª}}, "sea of death") is used, due to the scarcity of aquatic life there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Bridger|author2=Samuel Wolk|title=The New Jewish Encyclopedia|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hZqpCrG3qw0C&amp;pg=PA109|accessdate=July 25, 2011|date=September 1976|publisher=Behrman House, Inc|isbn=978-0-87441-120-1|page=109|quote=It was named the âDead Seaâ because of the fact that no living thing can exist there, since the water is extremely salty and bitter.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Arabic language|Arabic]] the Dead Sea is called {{Audio|ArDeadSea.ogg|''al-Bahr al-Mayyit''}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; ("the Dead Sea"), or less commonly ''{{transl|ar|baá¸¥ráµ lÅ«á¹­áµ}}'' ({{lang|ar|Ø¨Ø­Ø± ÙÙØ·}}, "the Sea of [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]]"). Another historic name in Arabic was the "Sea of [[Neve Zohar|ZoÊ¼ar]]", after a nearby town in biblical times. The Greeks called it ''Lake Asphaltites'' ([[Attic Greek]] {{lang|grc|á¼¡ ÎÎ¬Î»Î±ÏÏÎ± á¼ÏÏÎ±Î»Ïá¿ÏÎ·Ï}}, ''{{transl|el|hÄ ThÃ¡latta asphaltÄ©tÄs}}'', "the Asphaltite&lt;ref&gt;See [[bitumen]] and [[asphalt]] for more about ''asphaltite''.&lt;/ref&gt; sea").

==Geography==
[[File:Dead Sea Galilee.jpg|thumb|[[Satellite photography|Satellite photograph]] showing the location of the Dead Sea east of the Mediterranean Sea]]
The Dead Sea is an [[endorheic basin|endorheic lake]] located in the [[Jordan Rift Valley]], a geographic feature formed by the [[Dead Sea Transform]] (DST). This left lateral-moving [[transform fault]] lies along the [[tectonics|tectonic]] [[plate tectonics|plate boundary]] between the [[African Plate]] and the [[Arabian Plate]]. It runs between the [[East Anatolian Fault]] zone in [[Turkey]] and the northern end of the [[Red Sea Rift]] offshore of the southern tip of [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]]. It is here that the Upper Jordan River/Sea of Galilee/Lower Jordan River water system comes to an end.

The [[Jordan River]] is the only major water source flowing into the Dead Sea, although there are small perennial springs under and around the Dead Sea, forming pools and [[quicksand]] pits along the edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tommyimages.com/Stock_Photos/Middle_East/Israel/Dead_Sea/index.html|title=Springs and quicksand at the Dead Sea|accessdate=August 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no outlet streams.

The Mujib River, biblical Arnon, is one the larger water sources of the Dead Sea other than the Jordan.&lt;ref name="RSDSC"/&gt; The [[Wadi Mujib]] valley, 420 m below the sea level in the southern of Jordan valley, is a [[Man and the Biosphere Programme#Biosphere reserves|biosphere reserve]], with an area of {{convert|212|km2|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/ecological-sciences/biosphere-reserves/arab-states/jordan/mujib/|title= Mujib |publisher=UNESCO|accessdate= 7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other more substantial sources are Wadi Darajeh (Arabic)/Nahal Dragot (Hebrew), and [[Ein Gedi|Nahal Arugot]].&lt;ref name="RSDSC"&gt;[http://www.gsi.gov.il/_uploads/ftp/GsiReport/2010/Tahal-GSI-19-2010.pdf Red Sea â Dead Sea Water Conveyance Study (RSDSC) Program: Dead Sea Study, July 2010, p. 64]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wadi Hasa]] (biblical Zered) is another [[wadi]] flowing into the Dead Sea.

Rainfall is scarcely {{convert|100|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} per year in the northern part of the Dead Sea and barely {{convert|50|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in the southern part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exact-me.org/overview/p4144.htm |title=Dead Sea |publisher=Exact Me.org |accessdate=January 21, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120074227/http://exact-me.org/overview/p4144.htm |archivedate=January 20, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dead Sea zone's aridity is due to the [[rain shadow|rainshadow]] effect of the [[Judaean Mountains]]. The highlands east of the Dead Sea receive more rainfall than the Dead Sea itself.

To the west of the Dead Sea, the Judaean mountains rise less steeply and are much lower than the mountains to the east. Along the southwestern side of the lake is a {{convert|210|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} tall [[halite]] formation called "[[Mount Sodom]]".

==Natural history==
There are two contending hypotheses about the origin of the low elevation of the Dead Sea. The older hypothesis is that the Dead Sea lies in a true rift zone, an extension of the [[Red Sea Rift]], or even of the [[Great Rift Valley (geographical concept)|Great Rift Valley]] of [[East Africa|eastern Africa]]. A more recent hypothesis is that the Dead Sea basin is a consequence of a "step-over" discontinuity along the Dead Sea Transform, creating an extension of the crust with consequent subsidence.

Around 3.7 million years ago,{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} what is now the valley of the Jordan River, Dead Sea, and the northern [[Arabah|Wadi Arabah]] was repeatedly inundated by waters from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The waters formed in a narrow, crooked bay that is called by geologists the [[Sedom Lagoon]], which was connected to the sea through what is now the [[Jezreel Valley]]. The floods of the valley came and went depending on long-scale [[climate change]]. The Sedom Lagoon&lt;ref name=Stein&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsi.gov.il/_Uploads/4739SteinF.pdf |title=The limnological history of late Pleistocene â Holocene water bodies in the Dead Sea basin |author=Mordechai Stein |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513022228/http://www.gsi.gov.il/_Uploads/4739SteinF.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; deposited beds of salt that eventually became {{convert|2.5|km|2|abbr=on}} thick.

Approximately two million years ago,{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} the land between the [[Rift valley|Rift Valley]] and the Mediterranean Sea rose to such an extent that the ocean could no longer flood the area. Thus, the long lagoon became a landlocked lake. The Sedom Lagoon extended at its maximum from the [[Sea of Galilee]] in the north to somewhere around {{convert|50|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} south of the current southern end of the Dead Sea, and the subsequent lakes obviously never surpassed this expanse. The [[Hula Valley|Hula Depression]] was never part of any of these water bodies due to its higher elevation and the high threshold of the [[Chorazin#Geomorphology|Korazim block]] separating it from the Sea of Galilee basin.&lt;ref name="Springer Science &amp; Business Media"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Uri Kafri|author2=Yoseph Yechieli|title=Groundwater Base Level Changes and Adjoining Hydrological Systems.|year=2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3642139444|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first prehistoric lake to follow the Sedom Lagoon is named [[Lake Amora]], followed by [[Lake Lisan]] and finally by the Dead Sea.&lt;ref name=Stein/&gt; The water levels and salinity of these lakes have either risen or fallen as an effect of the tectonic dropping of the valley bottom, and due to climate variation. As the climate became more arid, Lake Lisan finally shrank and became saltier, leaving the Dead Sea as its last remainder.&lt;ref name=Stein/&gt;&lt;ref name="Springer Science &amp; Business Media"/&gt;
[[File:SaltCementedPebblesDeadSea.JPG|thumb|right|Pebbles cemented with [[halite]] on the western shore of the Dead Sea near Ein Gedi]]

In [[prehistory|prehistoric times]], great amounts of sediment collected on the floor of Lake Amora. The sediment was heavier than the salt deposits and squeezed the salt deposits upwards into what are now the [[Lisan Peninsula]] and [[Mount Sodom]] (on the southwest side of the lake). Geologists explain the effect in terms of a bucket of mud into which a large flat stone is placed, forcing the mud to creep up the sides of the bucket. When the floor of the Dead Sea dropped further due to tectonic forces, the salt mounts of Lisan and Mount Sodom stayed in place as high cliffs (see [[salt dome]]).

From 70,000 to 12,000 years ago, the lake's level was {{convert|100|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|250|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} higher than its current level. This lake, Lake Lisan, fluctuated dramatically, rising to its highest level around 26,000 years ago, indicating a very wet climate in the [[Near East]].&lt;ref name="SocietySociety1971"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geochemical Society|author2=Meteoritical Society|title=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3LccAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=April 12, 2011|year=1971|publisher=Pergamon Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 10,000 years ago, the lake's level dropped dramatically, probably to even lower than today's. During the last several thousand years, the lake has fluctuated approximately {{convert|400|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}, with some significant drops and rises. Current theories as to the cause of this dramatic drop in levels rule out [[volcano|volcanic activity]]; therefore, it may have been a seismic event.

==Climate==
The Dead Sea's climate offers year-round sunny skies and dry air. It has less than {{convert|50|mm|in|0|}} mean annual rainfall and a summer average temperature between {{convert|32|and|39|C|F}}. Winter average temperatures range between {{convert|20|and|23|C|F}}. The region has weaker [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]], particularly the UVB (erythrogenic rays).

The Dead Sea affects temperatures nearby because of the moderating effect a large body of water has on climate. During the winter, sea temperatures tend to be higher than land temperatures, and vice versa during the summer months. This is the result of the water's mass and [[specific heat capacity]].

With 34.2% [[salinity]] (in 2011), it is one of the [[List of bodies of water by salinity|world's saltiest bodies of water]], though [[Lake Vanda]] in [[Antarctica]] (35%), [[Lake Assal (Djibouti)|Lake Assal]] in [[Djibouti]] (34.8%), Lagoon [[GarabogazkÃ¶l]] in the [[Caspian Sea]] (up to 35%) and some hypersaline ponds and lakes of the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] in [[Antarctica]] (such as [[Don Juan Pond]] (44%)) have reported higher salinities.

Until the winter of 1978â79, when a major mixing event took place,&lt;ref name=overturn/&gt; the Dead Sea was composed of two stratified layers of water that differed in temperature, density, age, and salinity. The topmost {{convert|35|m|ft|0|sp=us}} or so of the Dead Sea had an average salinity of 342 [[Concentration|parts per thousand]] (in 2002), and a temperature that swung between {{convert|19|Â°C|Â°F|abbr=on}} and {{convert|37|Â°C|Â°F|abbr=on}}. Underneath a zone of transition, the lowest level of the Dead Sea had waters of a consistent {{convert|22|Â°C|Â°F|abbr=on}} temperature and complete saturation of [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Since the water near the bottom is [[saturation (chemistry)|saturated]], the salt precipitates out of solution onto the [[seabed|sea floor]].

Beginning in the 1960s, water inflow to the Dead Sea from the Jordan River was reduced as a result of large-scale irrigation and generally low rainfall. By 1975, the upper water layer was saltier than the lower layer. Nevertheless, the upper layer remained suspended above the lower layer because its waters were warmer and thus less dense. When the upper layer cooled so its density was greater than the lower layer, the waters mixed (1978â79). For the first time in centuries, the lake was a homogeneous body of water. Since then, [[stratification (water)|stratification]] has begun to redevelop.&lt;ref name=overturn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/TED/deadsea.htm|title=Dead Sea Canal|publisher=American.edu|date=1996-12-09|accessdate=May 5, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522133748/http://www1.american.edu/TED/deadsea.htm|archivedate=May 22, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mineral content of the Dead Sea is very different from that of ocean water. The exact composition of the Dead Sea water varies mainly with season, depth and temperature. In the early 1980s, the concentration of ionic species (in g/kg) of Dead Sea surface water was Cl&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt; (181.4), Br&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt; (4.2), SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2â&lt;/sup&gt; (0.4), HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt; (0.2), Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (14.1), Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (32.5), K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (6.2) and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (35.2). The total salinity was 276 g/kg.&lt;ref&gt;I. Steinhorn, ''In Situ Salt Precipitation at the Dead Sea'', Limnol. Oceanogr. 28(3),1983, 580-583&lt;/ref&gt; These results show that the composition of the salt, as anhydrous chlorides on a weight percentage basis, was [[calcium chloride]] (CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) 14.4%, [[potassium chloride]] (KCl) 4.4%, [[magnesium chloride]] (MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) 50.8% and [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) 30.4%. In comparison, the salt in the water of most [[ocean]]s and [[sea]]s is approximately 85% [[sodium chloride]]. The concentration of [[sulfate]] ions (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2â&lt;/sup&gt;) is very low, and the concentration of [[bromide]] ions (Br&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt;) is the highest of all waters on Earth.

The salt concentration of the Dead Sea fluctuates around 31.5%. This is unusually high and results in a nominal density of 1.24&amp;nbsp;kg/l. Anyone can easily float in the Dead Sea because of natural [[buoyancy]]. In this respect the Dead Sea is similar to the [[Great Salt Lake]] in [[Utah]] in the United States.

An unusual feature of the Dead Sea is its discharge of [[asphalt]]. From deep [[Petroleum seep|seeps]], the Dead Sea constantly spits up small pebbles and blocks of the black substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1 =Bein, A. |author2 =O.

==Putative therapies==
{{Medical citations needed|date=March 2015}}
The Dead Sea area has become a location for [[health]] [[research]] and potential treatment for several reasons. The mineral content of the water, the low content of [[pollen]]s and other [[allergen]]s in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], the reduced [[ultraviolet]] component of [[Sunlight|solar radiation]], and the higher [[atmospheric pressure]] at this great depth each may have specific [[health effect]]s. For example, persons experiencing reduced [[respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] function from [[disease]]s such as [[cystic fibrosis]] seem to benefit from the increased atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadsea-health.org/new_html/diseases_respiratory.html |title=Asthma, Cystic Fibrosis, Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease|accessdate=May 22, 2007|work=Dead Sea Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region's climate and low elevation have made it a popular center for assessment of putative therapies:
*[[Climatotherapy]]: Treatment which exploits local climatic features such as [[temperature]], [[humidity]], [[Sunlight|sunshine]], [[Atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] and special atmospheric constituents
*[[Light therapy|Heliotherapy]]: Treatment that exploits the biological effects of the [[sun]]'s radiation

The sea is called "dead" because its high salinity prevents macroscopic aquatic organisms, such as fish and [[aquatic plant]]s, from living in it, though minuscule quantities of bacteria and microbial fungi are present.

In times of flood, the salt content of the Dead Sea can drop from its usual 35% to 30% or lower. The Dead Sea temporarily comes to life in the wake of rainy winters. In 1980, after one such rainy winter, the normally dark blue Dead Sea turned red. Researchers from [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] found the Dead Sea to be teeming with a type of [[alga]] called ''[[Dunaliella]]''. ''Dunaliella'' in turn nourished [[carotenoid]]-containing (red-[[pigment]]ed) [[halobacteria]], whose presence caused the color change. Since 1980, the Dead Sea basin has been dry and the algae and the bacteria have not returned in measurable numbers.

In 2011 a group of scientists from Be'er Sheva, Israel and Germany discovered fissures in the floor of the Dead Sea by scuba diving and observing the surface. These fissures allow fresh and brackish water to enter the Dead Sea. They sampled biofilms surrounding the fissures and discovered numerous species of bacteria and [[archaea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0038319 |title= PLOS ONE |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many animal species live in the mountains surrounding the Dead Sea. Hikers can see [[ibex]], [[hare]]s, [[hyrax]]es, [[jackal]]s, [[fox]]es, and even [[Arabian Leopard|leopard]]s. Hundreds of [[bird]] species inhabit the zone as well. Both Jordan and Israel have established [[nature reserve]]s around the Dead Sea.

The delta of the Jordan River was formerly a [[jungle]] of [[Cyperus papyrus|papyrus]] and [[Arecaceae|palm tree]]s. The Jewish historian [[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]] described [[Jericho]] as "the most fertile spot in [[Judea]]". In [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times, [[sugarcane]],{{dubious|Fatimid and Crusader period only, unless proven differently.|date=October 2015}} [[henna]], and [[Ficus sycomorus|sycamore fig]] all made the lower Jordan valley wealthy. One of the most valuable products produced by Jericho was the [[Balsam of Mecca|sap]] of the [[Commiphora|balsam]] tree, which could be made into [[perfume]]. By the 19th century, Jericho's fertility had disappeared.{{dubious|Really? Why? Source? Jordan, other streams still there, population and water needs low.|date=October 2015}}

==Human settlement==
There are several small communities near the Dead Sea. These include [[Ein Gedi]], [[Neve Zohar]] and the [[Israeli settlement]]s in the [[Megilot Regional Council]]: [[Kalya]], [[Mitzpe Shalem]] and [[Avnat]]. There is a nature preserve at Ein Gedi, and several Dead Sea hotels are located on the southwest end at [[Ein Bokek]] near Neve Zohar. [[Highway 90 (Israel)|Highway 90]] runs north-south on the Israeli side for a total distance of {{convert|565|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Metula]] on the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] border in the north to its southern terminus at the [[Egypt]]ian border near the [[Red Sea]] port of [[Eilat]].

[[Potash City]] is a small community on the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea, and others including Suweima. [[Highway 65 (Jordan)|Highway 65]] runs north-south on the Jordanian side from near Jordan's northern tip down past the Dead Sea to the port of [[Aqaba]].

[[File:Madaba BW 9 THERMA KALLIROIS highlighted.jpg|thumb|A cargo boat on the Dead Sea as seen on the [[Madaba Map]], from the 6th century AD]]

===Biblical period===
Dwelling in caves near the Dead Sea is recorded in the [[Hebrew Bible]] as having taken place before the [[Israelites]] came to [[Canaan]], and extensively at the time of King [[David]].

Just northwest of the Dead Sea is [[Jericho]]. Somewhere, perhaps on the southeastern shore, would be the cities mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]] which were said to have been destroyed in the time of [[Abraham]]: [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom and Gomorra]] (Genesis 18) and the three other "Cities of the Plain", [[Admah]], [[Zeboim (Hebrew Bible)|Zeboim]] and [[Zoara|Zoar]] (Deuteronomy 29:23). Zoar escaped destruction when Abraham's nephew [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] escaped to Zoar from Sodom (Genesis 19:21â22). Before the destruction, the Dead Sea was a valley full of natural [[tar pit]]s, which was called the '''vale of Siddim'''. King David was said to have hidden from [[Saul]] at Ein Gedi nearby.

In {{bibleverse-lb||Ezekiel|47:8â9|HE}} there is a specific prophecy that the sea will "be healed and made fresh", becoming a normal lake capable of supporting [[marine biology|marine life]]. A similar prophecy is stated in {{bibleverse-lb||Zechariah|14:8|HE}}, which says that "living waters will go out from [[Jerusalem]], half of them to the eastern sea [likely the Dead Sea] and half to the western sea [the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]]."

===Greek and Roman period===
[[Aristotle]] wrote about the remarkable waters. The [[Nabataeans|Nabatean]]s and others discovered the value of the globs of natural [[asphalt]] that constantly floated to the surface where they could be harvested with nets. The Egyptians were steady customers, as they used asphalt in the [[embalming]] process that created [[mummy|mummies]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] knew the Dead Sea as "''Palus Asphaltites''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordnik.com/words/Asphaltites |title=Asphaltites examples from ancient sources |publisher=Wordnik.com |accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Asphalt Lake).

King [[Herod the Great]] built or rebuilt several fortresses and palaces on the western bank of the Dead Sea. The most famous was [[Masada]], where in 70 CE a small group of Jewish [[Zealotry|zealots]] fled after the fall of the destruction of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Second Temple]]. The zealots survived until 73 CE, when a siege by the [[Roman legion|X Legion]] ended in the deaths by suicide of its 960 inhabitants. Another historically important fortress was [[Machaerus]] (×××××¨), on the eastern bank, where, according to Josephus, [[John the Baptist]] was imprisoned by [[Herod Antipas]] and died.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=J.+AJ+18.119 18.119]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=BabbaQ |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in Roman times, some [[Essenes]] settled on the Dead Sea's western shore; [[Pliny the Elder]] identifies their location with the words, "on the west side of the Dead Sea, away from the coast ... [above] the town of Engeda" (''Natural History'', Bk 5.73); and it is therefore a hugely popular but contested hypothesis today, that same Essenes are identical with the settlers at [[Qumran]] and that "the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]" discovered during the 20th century in the nearby caves had been their own library.

[[Josephus]] identified the Dead Sea in geographic proximity to the ancient Biblical city of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]. However, he referred to the lake by its Greek name, Asphaltites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://sacred-texts.com/jud/josephus/ant-1.htm|author=Josephus|title=[[Antiquities of the Jews]]|volume=1 |chapter=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various sects of Jews settled in caves overlooking the Dead Sea. The best known of these are the [[Essenes]] of [[Qumran]], who left an extensive library known as the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].&lt;ref&gt;Found today in the [[Shrine of the Book]] at the Israel Museum of Jerusalem&lt;/ref&gt; The town of [[Ein Gedi]], mentioned many times in the [[Mishna]], produced [[persimmon]] for the temple's fragrance and for export, using a secret recipe. "Sodomite salt" was an essential mineral for the temple's holy incense, but was said to be dangerous for home use and could cause blindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pardes.org.il/online_learning/weekly-talmud/2009-02-12.php |title=Sodomite salt could cause blindness |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815040437/http://www.pardes.org.il/online_learning/weekly-talmud/2009-02-12.php |archivedate=2009-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman camps surrounding [[Masada]] were built by Jewish slaves receiving water from the towns around the lake. These towns had drinking water from the Ein Feshcha springs and other sweetwater springs in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;A synagogue mosaic floor (circa 100 BCE) at Ein Gedi repeats the Mishna, portraying a curse on whoever reveals the town's secret persimmon recipe. Papyrus parchments found in caves near the Dead Sea document the vast amount of cultivated land in the area, especially persimmon trees, but also olive and date trees&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine period===
Intimately connected with the Judean wilderness to its northwest and west, the Dead Sea was a place of escape and refuge. The remoteness of the region attracted [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] [[monk]]s since the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era. Their [[monastery|monasteries]], such as [[Saint George]] in Wadi Kelt and [[Mar Saba]] in the [[Judaean Desert]], are places of [[pilgrimage]].

===Modern times===
In the 19th century the River Jordan and the Dead Sea were explored by boat primarily by [[Christopher Costigan]] in 1835, [[Thomas Howard Molyneux]] in 1847, [[William Francis Lynch]] in 1848, and [[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]] in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadseaguide.com/dead_sea_history|title=History of the Dead Sea - Discover the Dead Sea with Us!|date=1 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full text of W. F. Lynch's 1949 book ''[[s:Narrative Of The United States Expedition To The River Jordan And The Dead Sea|Narrative of the United States' Expedition to the River Jordan and the Dead Sea]]'' is available online. [[Charles Leonard Irby]] and [[James Mangles (Royal Navy officer)|James Mangles]] travelled along the shores of the Dead Sea already in 1817â18, but didn't navigate on its waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyireland.com/18th-19th-century-history/the-unfortunate-costigan-first-surveyor-of-the-dead-sea/|title=âThe unfortunate Costiganâ, first surveyor of the Dead Sea|date=25 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explorers and scientists arrived in the area to analyze the minerals and research the unique climate.

After the find of the "[[Mesha Stele|Moabite Stone]]" in 1868 on the plateau east of the Dead Sea, [[Moses Wilhelm Shapira]] and his partner Salim al-Khouri forged and sold a whole range of presumed "Moabite" antiquities, and in 1883 Shapira presented what is now known as the "Shapira Strips", a supposedly ancient scroll written on leather strips which he claimed had been found near the Dead Sea. The strips were declared to be forgeries and Shapira took his own life in disgrace.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, hundreds of religious documents dated between 150 BCE and 70 CE were found in caves near the ancient settlement of [[Qumran]], about {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} inland from the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea (presently in the West Bank). They became known and famous as the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].

The world's lowest roads, [[Highway 90 (Israel)|Highway 90]], run along the Israeli and West Bank shores of the Dead Sea, along with Highway 65 on the [[Jordan]]ian side, at {{convert|393|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level.

==Tourism and leisure==
[[File:Ein Bokek - Dead Sea2.jpg|thumb|[[Ein Bokek]], a resort on the Israeli shore]]

===British Mandate period===
A [[golf course]] named for [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] was built by the British at [[Kalya|Kalia]] on the northern shore.

===Israel===
The first major Israeli hotels were built in nearby [[Arad, Israel|Arad]], and since the 1960s at the [[Ein Bokek]] resort complex.

Israel has 15 hotels along the Dead Sea shore, generating total revenues of $291 million in 2012. Most Israeli hotels and resorts on the Dead Sea are on a {{convert|6|km|mi|spell=in|adj=mid|abbr=off}} stretch of the southern shore.&lt;ref name=WorldBank/&gt;

===Jordan===
[[File:Kempinski Hotel Ishtar - Dead Sea - Jordan.jpg|thumb|Kempinski Hotel, one of the many hotels on the [[Jordan]]ian shore]]
On the Jordanian side, nine international franchises have opened [[seaside resort]] hotels near the [[King Hussein Bin Talal Convention Center]], along with resort apartments, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. The 9 hotels have boosted the Jordanian side's capacity to 2,800 rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jordantimes.com/news/local/dead-sea-aqaba-hotels-packed-during-eid-al-fitr-holiday|title=Dead Sea, Aqaba hotels packed during Eid Al Fitr holiday|accessdate=12 July 2016|date=10 July 2016|work=The Jordan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Bank===
The Palestinian Dead Sea Coast is about {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=off}} long. The World Bank estimates that a Palestinian Dead Sea tourism industry could generate $290 million of revenues per year and 2,900 jobs.&lt;ref name=WorldBank/&gt; However, Palestinians have been unable to obtain construction permits for tourism-related investments on the Dead Sea.&lt;ref name=WorldBank/&gt; According to the World Bank, Officials in the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities state that the only way to apply for such permits is through the Joint Committees established under the Oslo Agreement, but the relevant committee has not met with any degree of regularity since 2000.&lt;ref name=WorldBank/&gt;

===British Mandate period===
In the early part of the 20th century, the Dead Sea began to attract interest from chemists who deduced the sea was a natural deposit of [[potash]] (potassium chloride) and [[bromine]]. The Palestine Potash Company was chartered in 1929, after its founder, Siberian Jewish engineer and pioneer of [[Lake Baikal]] exploitation, [[Moshe Novomeysky|Moses Novomeysky]], worked for the charter for over ten years. The first plant was on the north shore of the Dead Sea at [[Kalya]] and produced potash by solar evaporation of the brine. Employing Arabs and Jews, it was an island of peace in turbulent times.&lt;ref name = "PM Nov 1930"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Wealth From The Dead Sea |magazine= Popular Mechanics | volume = 54 | issue = 5 | pages =794â798 | publisher = Hearst Magazines | location = Chicago | date = November 1930| url = https://books.google.com/?id=uOQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA794}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company quickly grew into the largest industrial site in the Middle East,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and in 1934 built a second plant on the southwest shore, in the [[Mount Sodom]] area, south of the [[Lisan Peninsula|'Lashon' region]] of the Dead Sea. Palestine Potash Company supplied half of Britain's potash during [[World War II]]. Both plants were destroyed by the Jordanians in the [[1948 ArabâIsraeli War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=1o_pCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136&amp;lpg=PA136&amp;dq=dead%20sea%20plants%20destroyed%20by%20jordanians&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V-pKJbuC8M&amp;sig=B99B7o18KHu7vjw7uKtyOD3EUJY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitrLLH_eDMAhVI6RQKHWMUBHIQ6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=dead%20sea%20plants%20destroyed%20by%20jordanians&amp;f=false|title=Saline Lakes V: Proceedings of the Vth International Symposium on Inland Saline Lakes, held in Bolivia, 22â29 March 1991|first=Stuart H.|last=Hurlbert|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
The Dead Sea Works was founded in 1952 as a state-owned enterprise based on the remnants of the Palestine Potash Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/who-really-owns-the-dead-sea.premium-1.515340|title=Who Really Owns the Dead Sea?|first=Asher|last=Schechter|date=14 April 2013|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the company was privatized and it is now owned by [[Israel Chemicals]]. From the Dead Sea brine, Israel produces (2001) 1.77 million [[ton]]s potash, 206,000 tons elemental bromine, 44,900 tons [[sodium hydroxide|caustic soda]], 25,000 tons [[magnesium]] metal, and sodium chloride. Israeli companies generate around US$3 billion annually from the sale of Dead Sea minerals (primarily potash and bromine), and from other products that are derived from Dead Sea Minerals.&lt;ref name=WorldBank&gt;World Bank, Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Department, [http://hlrn.org/img/violation/Area+C+Report+Oct-13.pdf Area C and the Future of the Palestinian Economy], October 2, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jordan===
On the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea, [[Arab Potash]] (APC), formed in 1956, produces 2.0 million tons of potash annually, as well as sodium chloride and bromine. The plant is located at Safi, South Aghwar Department, in the [[Karak Governorate]].

Jordanian Dead Sea mineral industries generate about $1.2 billion in sales (equivalent to 4 percent of Jordanâs GDP).

===West Bank===
The Palestinian Dead Sea Coast is about {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=off}} long. The Palestinian economy is unable to benefit from Dead Sea chemicals due to restricted access, permit issues and the uncertainties of the investment climate.&lt;ref name=WorldBank/&gt; The World Bank estimates that a Palestinian Dead Sea chemicals industry could generate $918m incremental value added per year, "almost equivalent to the contribution of the entire manufacturing sector of Palestinian territories today".&lt;ref name=WorldBank/&gt;

===Extraction===
Both companies, Dead Sea Works Ltd. and Arab Potash, use extensive salt [[pan evaporation|evaporation pan]]s that have essentially diked the entire southern end of the Dead Sea for the purpose of producing [[carnallite]], potassium magnesium chloride, which is then processed further to produce potassium chloride. The [[Salt evaporation pond|ponds]] are separated by a central dike that runs roughly north-south along the international border. The [[power station|power plant]] on the Israeli side allows production of magnesium metal (by a subsidiary, Dead Sea Magnesium Ltd.).

Due to the popularity of the sea's therapeutic and healing properties, several companies have also shown interest in the manufacturing and supplying of Dead Sea salts as raw materials for body and skin care products.

==Recession and environmental concerns==
[[File:Red Sea - Dead Sea Canal map.jpg|thumb|right|The planned [[Red SeaâDead Sea Water Conveyance]], whose first phase will begin construction in 2018, will work towards stabilizing the falling levels of the Dead Sea]]

Since 1930, when its surface was {{convert|1050|km2|abbr=on}} and its level was {{convert|390|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level, the Dead Sea has been monitored continuously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/water2.html#Dead|title=Overview of Middle East Water Resources_Dead Sea|date=December 1998|accessdate=31 May 2014|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, the Dead Sea has been rapidly shrinking because of diversion of incoming water from the Jordan River to the north. The southern end is fed by a canal maintained by the Dead Sea Works, a company that converts the sea's raw materials. From a water surface of {{convert|395|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level in 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=C. Klein |author2=A. Flohn|title=Contribution to the Knowledge in the Fluctuations of the Dead Sea Level|publisher=Theoretical and Applied Climatology|volume=38|pages=151â156, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; it fell {{convert|22|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|418|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level in 2006, reaching a drop rate of {{convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} per year. As the water level decreases, the characteristics of the Sea and surrounding region may substantially change.

{{anchor|sinkholes}}
The Dead Sea level drop has been followed by a [[groundwater]] level drop, causing brines that used to occupy underground layers near the shoreline to be flushed out by freshwater. This is believed to be the cause of the recent appearance of large [[sinkhole]]s along the western shoreâincoming freshwater dissolves salt layers, rapidly creating subsurface cavities that subsequently collapse to form these sinkholes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Abelson|author2=Y. Yechieli |author3=O. Crouvi |author4=G. Baer |author5=D. Wachs |author6=A. Bein |author7=V.

[[File:Dead Sea Coastal Erosion March 2012.JPG|thumb|right|Gully in unconsolidated Dead Sea sediments exposed by recession of water levels. It was excavated by floods from the [[Judean Mountains]] in less than a year.]]

In May 2009 at the [[World Economic Forum]], Jordan announced its plans to construct the "Jordan National Red Sea Development Project" (JRSP). This is a plan to convey seawater from the [[Red Sea]] near Aqaba to the Dead Sea. Water would be desalinated along the route to provide fresh water to Jordan, with the brine discharge sent to the Dead Sea for replenishment. The early planning called for developer and financier selection to be completed by year's end, with detailed design to begin in early 2010, and water delivery by 2017. Israel expressed its support and will likely benefit from some of the water delivery to its Negev region. Some hydro-power will be collected near the Dead Sea from the dramatic change in elevation on the downhill side of the project.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

At a regional conference in July 2009, officials expressed concern about the declining water levels. Some suggested industrial activities around the Dead Sea might need to be reduced. Others advised environmental measures to restore conditions such as increasing the volume of flow from the Jordan River to replenish the Dead Sea. Currently, only sewage and effluent from fish ponds run in the river's channel. Experts also stressed the need for strict conservation efforts. They said agriculture should not be expanded, sustainable support capabilities should be incorporated into the area and pollution sources should be reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=tp://www.jpost.com/Features/Article.aspx?id=148034 |title=Back from the Dead? |author=Ehud Zion Waldoks |publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=July 8, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, the Jordanians announced accelerated plans to extract around {{convert|300|e6m3|e9cuft|0|abbr=off}} of water per year from the Red Sea, desalinate it for use as fresh water and send the waste water to the Dead Sea by tunnel, despite concerns about inadequate time to assess the potential environmental impact. According to Jordan's minister for water, General Maysoun Zu'bi, this project could be considered as the first phase of the [[Red SeaâDead Sea Water Conveyance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/6285055/Jordan-to-refill-shrinking-Dead-Sea-with-salt-water.html|title=Jordan to refill shrinking Dead Sea|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Israel, Jordan and the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] signed an agreement for laying a water pipeline to link the Red Sea with the Dead Sea. The pipeline will be {{convert|180|km|abbr=on}} long and is estimated to take up to five years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/09/dead-sea-pipeline-water-red-sea|date=2013-12-09|title=Dead Sea neighbours agree to pipeline to pump water from Red Sea|first=Harriet|last=Sherwood|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015 it was reported that the level of water is now dropping by {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/news/international/middle_east/story.php?id=58290|title=Dead Sea Dying: Levels of salt water are dropping by three feet annually|author=Catholic Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November 2016, it was announced that the Jordanian government is shortlisting five consortiums to implement the project. Jordan's ministry of Water and Irrigation said that the $100 million first phase of the project will begin construction in the first quarter of 2018, and will be completed by 2021.&lt;ref name="JT"/&gt;

'''Doukkala''' ([[Berber language|Berber]]: '''Adu Kal''', â´°â´¸âµ â´¾â´°âµ; {{Lang-ar|Ø¯ÙØ§ÙØ©}}) is a [[natural region]] of [[Morocco]] made of fertile plains and forests. Nowadays it is part of the [[Casablanca-Settat]] administrative region. 

It is a [[plain]] stretching from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] south of [[Oum Er-Rbia River]] up to some 50 km further southward and the same distance eastward.

The main urban centers are [[Sidi Smail]], [[Sidi Bennour]], [[Had Ouled Frej]] , [[Khemis Zemamra]] . Sidi Bennour is the fastest developing center of the four.

It is mainly an agricultural region, with few tourist attractions.

== History ==
The name is derived from the Berber ''ddu'' or ''adu'' (under) and ''akal'' (land, earth, soil), thus meaning "low land", i.e. 'the plain'. Historically, "Doukkala" (''idukalen'') referred to a [[Berber people|Berber]] tribe which occupied the territory from [[Anfa]] ([[Casablanca]]) to [[Asfi]]. They revolted against [[Almohad]] kings in the 12th century. About 1160, the Almohad ruler [[Abd al-Mu'min]] settled [[Arab people|Arab]] bedouin tribes there, a coalition of whom he had defeated earlier in Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;''Guide bleu Hachette du Maroc'', 1978 ed., p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the French protectorate (ca 1950), there lived in Doukkala 372,269 [[Muslims]], 2,680 [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] and 3,933 [[Jews]].&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;''Guide bleu Hachette du Maroc'', 7th ed., 1950, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
Doukkala is divided in three sub-regions, parallel to the seacoast.
* The "Oulja", along the beach, with garden-crops.
* The "Sahel", some 20 km inside, a stony region, only suiting to [[sheep]] breeding.
* The rich plain, with [[wheat]], [[sugar beet]]s, and intensive [[cattle]] breeding.

The only mountain to be seen is "[[Jbel Lakhdar]]", at the border with the plain of [[Rahamna]].

The plain is subject to flooding. "Warar", a temporary natural lake between Sidi Bennour and Arbaa Od Aamran only fills in rainy years. Its largest surface was noted in 1916, 1966 and 2008.

E3G has three co-founding directors, [https://www.e3g.org/people/nick-mabey Nick Mabey] who is also the current Chief Executive, [[Tom Burke (environmentalist)|Tom Burke]] [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.chathamhouse.org/london-conference-2015/speakers/tom-burke |title= Tom Burke |work= [[Chatham House]] |accessdate= 2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is the current Chairman and [[John Ashton (diplomat)|John Ashton]] CBE who was the first CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.e3g.org/about/John-Ashton/ |title= John Ashton |website= e3g.org |accessdate= 2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation works across a number of areas including [https://www.e3g.org/showcase/climate-diplomacy climate diplomacy], energy, finance, cities, risk, efficiency and infrastructure.

== History ==
E3G was established in 2004, when it played a pivotal role in the successful diplomatic effort to get Russia to ratify the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. In 2006, E3G developed a political analysis called [https://www.e3g.org/showcase/europe-in-the-world Europe in the World], looking at how the EU could best respond to the challenge of maintaining its prosperity and security in an interdependent world.

E3G created the Transform UK coalition in 2009, serving as a cross-sector platform to drive [[Green Investment|green investment]] in the UK and spearhead the Green Investment Bank campaign. After much advocacy and analysis, the [[UK Green Investment Bank|Green Investment Bank]] was finally created to support low carbon infrastructure. The bank was established in 2011 with Â£3 billion in initial equity, taking on full legal status in 2013.

In 2010, together with partners, E3G developed and piloted the concept of [https://www.e3g.org/showcase/eu-china-cooperation Low Carbon Zones in China]. This led to the Chinese government to establish 12 zones covering 350 million people.

The groundbreaking [https://www.e3g.org/showcase/degrees-of-risk Degrees of Risk] report on [[climate risk management]] was published in 2011. The report went on to influence the [https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/ceq/2011_adaptation_progress_report.pdf US Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Taskforce].

The [https://www.e3g.org/showcase/energy-bill-revolution Energy Bill Revolution] was launched the following year in 2012.  The campaign set up a coalition of over 200 organisations calling on the  UK government to recycle [[carbon tax]]es to make all UK fuel poor homes super [[Efficient energy use|energy efficient]].

In the same year, E3G helped to launch the Norstec coalition, an industrial alliance working together on [[Offshore wind power|offshore]] renewable energy in Europe's [[North Sea]]. The [[North Sea Offshore Grid|North Sea Grid]] project is a great example of achieving power sector [[decarbonisation]] at the regional level.

E3G marked its [https://www.e3g.org/showcase/E3G-2004-2014 ten-year anniversary] in 2014.

In 2016 E3G was ranked the fifth most influential think tank in the world, third in Europe and number one in the UK by the [[University of Pennsylvania]] [http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&amp;context=think_tanks Global Go To Think Tank Index Report].

[[File:Map of earthquakes in Turkey 1900-2017.svg|420px|thumb|right|Map of earthquakes in Turkey 1900â2017]]
The '''geology of Turkey''' is the product of a wide variety of [[Tectonics|tectonic process]]es that have shaped [[Anatolia]] over millions of years, a process which continue today as evidenced by frequent earthquakes and occasional [[volcanic eruption]]s.

== Background ==
[[Turkey]]'s terrain is structurally complex. A central massif composed of uplifted blocks and downfolded [[Trough (geology)|troughs]], covered by recent deposits and giving the appearance of a plateau with rough terrain, is wedged between two folded mountain ranges that converge in the east. True lowland is confined to the plain of the [[Ergene]] river in [[Thrace]], extending along rivers that discharge into the [[Aegean Sea]] or the [[Sea of Marmara]], and to a few narrow coastal strips along the [[Black Sea]] and [[Mediterranean Sea]] coasts.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

Nearly 85% of the land is at an elevation of at least 450 meters; the median altitude of the country is 1,128 meters. In Asiatic Turkey, flat or gently sloping land is rare and largely confined to the deltas of the [[KÄ±zÄ±l River]], the coastal plains of [[Antalya]] and [[Adana]], and the valley floors of the [[Gediz River]] and the [[BÃ¼yÃ¼k Menderes River]], and some interior high plains in Anatolia, mainly around [[Lake Tuz|Tuz GÃ¶lÃ¼]] (Salt Lake) and [[Konya OvasÄ±]] (Konya Basin). Moderately sloping terrain is limited almost entirely outside Thrace to the hills of the Arabian Platform along the border with Syria.

More than 80% of the land surface is rough, broken, and mountainous, and therefore is of limited agricultural value. The terrain's ruggedness is accentuated in the eastern part of the country, where the two mountain ranges converge into a lofty region with a median elevation of more than 1,500 meters, which reaches its highest point along the borders with [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Iran]]. Turkey's highest peak, [[Mount Ararat]] (AÄrÄ± DaÄÄ±)âabout 5,166 meters highâis situated near the point where the boundaries of the four countries meet.

== Geological History ==
The earliest geological history of Turkey is poorly understood, partly because these oldest rocks in the region are involved into younger deformation phases that hindered their evolution. This created problem of reconstructing how the region has been tectonically assembled by plate motions. Turkey can be thought of as a collage of different continental pieces and remnants of oceanic lithospheric rocks amalgamated together by younger tectonic processes that involve accumulation of  igneous (both plutonic and volcanic) and sedimentary rocks.

=== Plate tectonics ===
[[File:Turkey-faults-platenames.png|thumb|[[plate tectonics]] in Turkey: there are geologic faults around the [[Anatolian Plate]], the [[African Plate]], the [[Arabian Plate]], and the [[Eurasian Plate]].]]

Except for a relatively small portion of its territory along the [[Syria]]n border that is a continuation of the [[Arabian Plate]], Turkey geologically is part of the great Alpine belt that extends from the Atlantic Ocean to the Himalaya Mountains. This belt was formed during the [[Cenozoic Era]] (about 66 to 1.6 million years ago), as the Arabian, [[African Plate|African]], and [[Indian Plate|Indian]] [[continental plate]]s began to collide with the [[Eurasian Plate]]. This process is still at work today as the African Plate converges with the Eurasian Plate and the [[Anatolian Plate]] escapes towards the west and southwest along strike-slip faults. These are the [[North Anatolian Fault Zone]], which forms the present day plate boundary of Eurasia near the Black Sea coast and, the [[East Anatolian Fault]] Zone, which forms part of the boundary of the North Arabian Plate in the southeast. As a result of this [[plate tectonics]] configuration, Turkey is one of the world's more active earthquake and volcanic regions.&lt;ref&gt;Kaymakci et al., 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anatolian Plate, together with the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]-[[Peloponnesus]] block, is located near the centre of a very wide region, including the [[Arabian Plate]] with the adjacent [[Zagros Mountains]] and central [[Iran]], that moves in a circulatory pattern at a relatively fast rate of 20&amp;nbsp;mm/yr.  The rate of this counter-clockwise motion increases near the [[Hellenic Trench]] system south of Turkey and decreases away from it (i.e. the Eurasian and African plates move at a rate of 5&amp;nbsp;mm/yr), resulting in internal deformations in several areas, including central and eastern Anatolia, south-western Aegean-Peloponnesus, [[Lesser Caucasus]], and central Iran.  
The dominant process in the region is the subduction of the African Plate beneath the Hellenic Trench, and the deformation in the entire African-Arabian-Eurasian collision zone is most likely driven by the slab roll-back of the subducting African Plate in the East Mediterranean&lt;ref&gt; Biryol et al., 2011 &lt;/ref&gt;.  This process is further fuelled by slab-pull forces in the [[Makran Trench]] in the [[Gulf of Oman]] where the Arabian Plate is subducting under Eurasia.  A response to this tectonic maelstrom is the rifting in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden which will separate Arabia from Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reilinger|McClusky|Vernant|Lawrence|2006|loc=Abstract; Fig. 2, p. 33, Fig. 3, p. 34};&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rocks ===
Many of the rocks exposed in Turkey were formed long before this process began. Turkey contains outcrops of [[Precambrian]] rocks, (more than 540 million years old).&lt;ref&gt;Bozkurt et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Mesozoic era]] (about 250 to 66 million years ago) a large ocean ([[Tethys Ocean]]), floored by oceanic lithosphere existed in-between the [[supercontinent]]s of [[Gondwana]] and [[Laurasia]] (which lay to the south and north respectively).&lt;ref&gt;ÅengÃ¶r and YÄ±lmaz, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; This large oceanic plate was consumed at [[subduction zone]]s. At the subduction trenches the sedimentary rock layers that were deposited within the prehistoric Tethys Ocean were folded, faulted and tectonically mixed with huge blocks of crystalline basement rocks of the oceanic lithosphere. These blocks form a very complex mixture or [[mÃ©lange]] of rocks that include mainly [[serpentinite]], [[basalt]], [[dolerite]], and [[chert]].&lt;ref&gt;Okay and TÃ¼ysÃ¼z, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The Eurasian margin, now preserved in the Pontides (the [[Pontic Mountains]] along the Black Sea coast), is thought to have been geologically similar to the Western Pacific region today.&lt;ref&gt;Kaymakci, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; [[Volcanic arc]]s and [[back-arc basin]]s formed and were emplaced onto Eurasia as [[ophiolite]]s as they collided with [[microcontinent]]s (literally relatively small plates of continental lithosphere).&lt;ref&gt;Ustaomer and Robertson, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; These microcontinents had been pulled away from the Gondwanan continent further south. Turkey is therefore made up from several different prehistorical microcontinents.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

During the [[Cenozoic]] (Tertiary about 66 to 1.6 million years) folding, faulting and uplifting, accompanied by volcanic activity and intrusion of igneous rocks was related to major continental collision between the larger Arabian and Eurasian plates.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson &amp; Dixon, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earthquakes ==
{{See also|1939 Erzincan earthquake}}
Turkey's most severe earthquake in the twentieth century occurred in [[Erzincan]] on the night of 1939-12-27; it devastated most of the city and caused an estimated 30,000 deaths. Earthquakes of moderate intensity often continue with sporadic aftershocks over periods of several days or even weeks. The most earthquake-prone part of Turkey is an arc-shaped region stretching from the general vicinity of [[Ä°zmit|Kocaeli]] to the area north of [[Lake Van]] on the border with [[Armenia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

Growstones are made in a variety of sizes from a large 1 to 2 inch sized "Lift" product made to supplement drainage in potted plants while retaining superior moisture and nutrients for the plant roots, to "Gnat Nix" which is a small "5MM" size product to prevent fungus gnats from thriving in potted plants.  Growstone company also produces several blended sizes of their products for specific growers' needs including sizes appropriate for "green roof" gardening.

Created in 1986, '''IGN FI''' is the private subsidiary of the French [[Institut GÃ©ographique National|IGN]] and works essentially abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.fr/institut/36/europe-et-monde/international-ign-fi.htm la filiale export de l'IGN]&lt;/ref&gt; Its goal is to promote the savoir-faire{{clarify|date=October 2013}} of the French [[Institut GÃ©ographique National|IGN]] around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/spipwwwmedad/pdf/IGN_en_Chiffres_cle2df9f8.pdf Rapport d'activitÃ© d'IGN]&lt;/ref&gt;

A company specialising in [[geographic information]], IGN FI intervenes in numerous fields, both in its core business of [[cartography]] as well as in the fields of [[Natural environment|environment]], [[agriculture]], urban planning, civil security and land management.

IGN FI is involved in all levels of project preparation:

[[Geodesy]] - [[Metrology]] - [[Cartography]] - Databases
Acquisition: aerial photography, satellite images, field surveys, geodetic networks...

Data processing: Orthophotographs, DTM (digital terrain models), DEM (digital elevation models), photogrammetric restitution, [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] models...

Modelling: structuring of information depending on the intended applications
Installation of geographic information systems (GIS) and thematic portals
	
IGN FI also offers project management assistance, project management, technical assistance, training or complete or partial technology and knowledge transfers.

==History==
IGN FI is the subsidiary of the National institute for geographic and forest information (IGN) and is involved in geographic information engineering. Created in 1986, its services are mainly offered to foreign decision-makers (Technical ministries, communities...). The company works alone or within a consortium, depending on the circumstances.
Its core business - NSDI, [[geodesy]], [[metrology]], [[cartography]], databases, [[GIS]] and web portals â targets the following fields: land administration ([[cadastre]], land assessment), environment, agriculture, security, energy...

Its shareholders are made up of IGN, GEOFIT Group, GEOFIT Expert, Esri (llc and France), Imao and Altereo.

==Relationship with the French IGN==

IGN FI benefits from a privileged relationship with its mother company, the French [[Institut GÃ©ographique National|IGN]]. This exists in the form of the provision of technical experts (cartographers, geodetic experts, topographers) or training sessions provided by the [[Grandes Ã©coles|ENSG]], the Instituteâs [[geomatics]] school. IGN France International also benefits from the research undertaken within the French [[Institut GÃ©ographique National|IGN]]âs four laboratories: the LAREG (Laboratory of Research in Geodesy), the LOEMI (Optical and Micro-computer Laboratory), the MATIS (Methods of Analysis and Image Processing for Stereo-restitution) and the COGIT (Object Conception and Generalization of Topographic Information). The close collaboration with IGN Espace, specialist in the processing and use of satellite images, allows the company to propose quality spatial imagery services to its foreign clients.

==IGN FIâs structure==

IGN FI is based in Paris and is made up of around 27 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.societe.com/societe/ign-france-international-337924328.html |title=IGN FI Ã  Paris sur SOCIETE.COM (337924328) |publisher=Societe.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local branches are also set up punctually to accompany the projects that it leads abroad.

Christophe Dekeyne is the General Manager since 2007. The general management department is reinforced by a commercial and sales department, led by Christophe Dekeyne, a technical department led by AurÃ©lie Milledrogues and a financial department.

In addition to the technical skills that it possesses internally, IGN FI can also count on the French IGN experts that are often called upon for its projects, as well as its network of institutional or private partners.

==Intervention methods==

IGN FIâs development strategy is clearly oriented towards the facilitation of project implementation. The company also favours the transfer of skills.[[Image:Inventaire-cultures-evaluation-surfaces-rendements-Egypte.jpg|thumb|left|Field survey in the Nile Valley]]

IGN FI most often takes the role of project manager, but also provides project management assistance. Project management assistance consists of providing complete services and is made up of several phases such as the definition of global processes, the drafting of a quality plan, the drafting or assisting the draft of [[call for bids]], the scoring and analysis of the proposals as well as the periodic provision of experts for critical project phases.

The projects that are undertaken by IGN France International are often accompanied by, when necessary, important practical training sessions, provided in the given country or in France.

==Areas of intervention and clients==
IGN FI offers its services to the following professionals:
*National mapping agencies
*Foreign technical ministries (environment, energy, natural resources, urban planning...)
*Foreign municipalities
*Large French or foreign groups that are active abroad
*French or foreign consultancy firms that are active abroad.

The company is present all around the world with recent projects is several different countries (Panama, Uganda, Qatar, Gabon, Saint-Dominguez, Brazil, Luxembourg, The United Kingdom, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Namibia, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, The United Arab Emirates, Sri Lanka, Russia, Uzbekistan, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia or even China). IGN FI is present in more than 120 countries.

Historically very involved in Africa, the company recently completed several new projects,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ign.fr/institut/84/dossiers/les-projets-d-ign-france-international.htm projets d'IGN FI]&lt;/ref&gt; such as:
*The mapping of flooded and flood-prone areas in Senegal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ignfi.fr/sites/default/files/Press-release-cartography-mapping-flood-zones-Dakar-Senegal-topography-IGN-France-International.pdf Official press release]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The urban cartography of the 7 main cities in Senegal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ignfi.fr/sites/default/files/Urban-cartography-Senegal-press-release.pdf Official press release]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The modernization of Senegalâs cartography at a scale of 1:200,000
*A land information system (LIS) in Uganda
*The supervision of the updating of geodetic networks (Cameroun)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ignfi.com/sites/default/files/Press-release-supervision-geodetic-network-Cameroon-Geodesy.pdf Official press release]&lt;/ref&gt;
*An agricultural inventory in Egypt (a technical symposium was held at the end of 2010 in Egypt and focused on the added value of geographic information for agricultural projects).

The company is also very active in the Middle East and Asia:
*Opening of an IGN FI branch in Abu Dhabi
*Demarcation of the land border and delimitation of offshore border lines between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the State of Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ignfi.fr/sites/default/files/Press-release-IGN-France-International-mapping-border-Saudi-Arabia-Qatar.pdf Official press release]&lt;/ref&gt;

IGN FI also has a strong presence in Europe:
*The Corine Land Cover project in Europe, which was composed of environmental databases in 38 European countries, and whose methodology is currently being adapted to the Andean countries
*The production of a database and digital cartography for the Grand DuchÃ© of Luxembourg
*The establishment of a spatial data infrastructure in Serbia
*The implementation of an environmental GIS in Romania.

==Sectors of application==

IGN FI is active in the field of [[geomatics]] and offers its services in several fields: data acquisition, data processing and [[data modeling]], creation of [[GIS]] and specific databases, the elaboration, installation and integration of web and thematic portals and the management and use of spatial data. It is involved in the creation and implementation of projects involving monitoring, piloting and assistance in their completion.

It offers support to its clients in the realization of their [[cartography]] projects, including both the initial constitution and updates, and more particularly the transfer of technology phase aimed at their local teams.

It also participates in data acquisition, aerial photography, satellite image acquisition, field surveys and the constitution of geodetic systems.

It also participates in the production of [[orthophoto]]s and digital terrain or elevation models ([[Digital elevation model|DTM]], DEM), photogrammetric restitution, the creation of 3D models and navigable databases and all databases necessary to the creation of [[map]]s...

IGN FI development and installation of dedicated [[information system]]s like [[GIS]] (geographic information systems) and LIS (land information systems). It also performs development and installation for web applications like geoportals and thematic portals.

===Cartography===
Valuable tools for understanding territories, the concept of the [[map]] has greatly diversified taking the form of vector or raster geographic databases. The mapâs utility to the general public has also exploded.

At a national level, a countryâs cartography is more often associated with a spatial data infrastructure (NSDI). This process completely redefines the production and distribution of cartographic data, which become independent and complementary layers of information.

IGN FI offers its clients support in achieving their cartographic projects, from the initial constitution all the way through updates, in particular in the phase where technology is transferred to their teams.

Examples:
*Mapping of Senegal at a scale of 1:200,000
*NSDI in Serbia

===Geodesy and metrology===
Different GNSS systems are used today to achieve accuracies within a few millimeters. Thanks to these systems, the field of [[geodesy]] has encountered a revolution and provides cartographers and developers with points of reference, growing more accurate with each passing day.

Reduced to a more local scale, [[metrology]] allows, through sub-millimetric details, the monitoring of the temporal evolution of structures or also the provision of assistance for the implementation of nuclear fusion experiments.

Strengthened by the internationally recognized scientific and practical experience of the French National Geographic Instituteâs (IGN) Geodesy Department, IGN FI offers services in the fields of [[geodesy]] and [[metrology]].

Example:
*Mapping of the border between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the State of Qatar

===Land administration===
Land administration projects make up a major concern in numerous countries, given what they represent and what is at stake. Major donors are often mobilised because these projects aim to bring stability, new developments in land markets and transparency of land values to the system.

Geographic information is an essential component of land administration through the collection and updating of cadastral data and through the development of information systems that allow the management of land activity.

IGN FI offers solutions ranging from project management assistance in all technical and legal fields to actual project completion, implementation and monitoring. It also has a privileged relationship with the French organisation for public financing (DGFiP).

Examples:
*Land information system in Uganda
*A CAMA-type application in Namibia

===Agriculture and forestry===
Geographic information is an essential component of the effective management of agricultural and forestry-related issues. The produced data and their integration in the âtradeâ applications aims to assist political leaders or sector-oriented professionals in the decision making process. For example, the data help to identify in detail agricultural and forestry areas, to monitor land occupation evolutions and deforestation in the framework of REDD+ projects (The United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries), or to determine different types of crops or forests.
Involved in [[sustainable development]] issues, IGN FI offers its services those working in the agriculture and forestry fields by producing data, providing GIS, trade information systems and decision support tools, or for completing project management assistance.
Examples:
*Monitoring and assessment of arable land in Egypt
*Crop inventory in Egypt

===Environment and risk management===
The pressure exercised on decision-makers concerning the fight to preserve the environment and to develop efficient prevention and risk management policies is stronger and stronger. At a national level, this could mean the creation of geographic reference databases as with the IGN initiative in the context of the Large Scale Referential (RGE) or an NSDI.

On a global level, IGN FI has always been a major player in the creation of geographic land occupation databases like [[Corine Land Cover]] (CoORdination of INformation on the Environment).
IGN FI assists those entities wishing to arm themselves with coherent and integrated environmental data.
Example:
*Land occupation database in Burkina Faso

===Defence and civil security===
Strengthened by the privileged relationship of the [[Institut GÃ©ographique National|IGN]] and the [[French Defence]], IGN FI offers its expertise in [[geoinformation]] in the field of defence and civil security.
Creation or updating of specific military maps, boundary marking, 3D visualisation tools for territories or even the surveillance of exposed works, IGN FI assists its clients in the strictest confidentiality.

===Energy and networks===
Those involved in the energy sector are looking to optimise the knowledge of their distribution networks (pipelines, electric lines, conduits) in order to reinforce on one hand their ability to intervene, maintain, expand and implement, and on the other hand, to reinforce their contingency plans in the case of disasters. They must also adapt to international environmental standards that are becoming more and more stringent, all while maintaining their productivity
Network managers thus need reliable geographic data, turnkey business information systems adapted to the location of their assets, the management of their distribution networks, risk management, the study of new implantation sites.
IGN FI assists them in implementing customised solutions that range from the simple [[cartography|mapping]] of a site to the implementation of a comprehensive [[geographic information system]]. IGN France International assists those involved in the energy field and brings them a better knowledge of their networks, increased development and reinforced intervention ability.

==Products==
Even though IGN France International does not sell âoff-the-shelfâ items, it does offer a range of products that it adapts to the specific needs of its clients. The company thus positions itself in the [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] market in the field of [[urbanization|urbanisation]], cartographic production chains or business applications in the field of land and property management. These products were developed in the [[Institut GÃ©ographique National|IGN]]âs research laboratories.

===Reference3D===
Reference3DÂ® is a unique and homogenous global geographic reference system allowing the representation and analysis of territories. It targets both public and private entities (national mapping agencies, Defence organisations, governments ...). It is the fruit of a partnership between the French Defence, the [[Institut GÃ©ographique National|IGN]] and [[Spot Image]]. The tool is made up of three layers:
*Digital Elevation Model
*An orthoimage database
*[[Metadata]] for quality and traceability
Reference3DÂ® offers important coverage (more than 50 million kmÂ² are already available) and supports many applications:
*Image orthorectification
*Flight simulation, information for arms systems
*Cartographic creation and updating
*Evaluation and foresight in strategic areas
*Risk prevention and crisis management

===Geoview===
GeoviewÂ®, the production tool of the [[Institut GÃ©ographique National|IGN]], is made for all data-producing structures (national mapping agencies, defence organisations). This comprehensive cartographic data production software combines the following business functions within the same process:
*[[Image processing]]
*[[Photogrammetry]]
*[[Cartography]]
GeoviewÂ® enables the production of [[digital elevation model]]s, orthoimages and 2D [[euclidean vector|vector]] and [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] databases.
It is made up of four modules:
* Standard module
*Geometric module
*Altimetric module
*Cartographic layout module
IGN FI concedes GeoviewÂ® in the form of capacity building in the context of the different projects that it leads abroad.

===3D Urbanis===
IGN FI offers its [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] solutions and expertise all those concerned by the sustainable management of the urban environment.
3D Urbanis is made using BATI3D, the [[Institut GÃ©ographique National|IGN]]âs production tool and fruit of 10 years of research within the MATIS laboratory (Methods of Analysis for Image processing and Stereorestitution). This product targets all structures involved in [[urbanization|urbanisation]] (authorities, urban planners, elected officials, ...).&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/4383961 3D Urbanis presentation video]&lt;/ref&gt;
3D Urbanis has numerous goals:
*Enhancement of the urban territory and its heritage
*Highlighting a cityâs potential for economic development
*Optimising [[urbanization|urban development]] while respecting environmental constraints
*Elaborating its projects while keeping the impact of different nuisances in mind (atmospheric, sound...)
*Seeing projects as a whole while taking all factors into account (natural resources, transportation...)
*Taking rapid action/anticipating
*Identifying alternative solutions in crisis situations (detours, evacuation plans)
The [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] georeferenced data of a city, once integrated into the dedicated software solutions, make up a decision-support, dialoguing and communication tool.

===CAMA Solution (land assessment)===
Developed by IGN FI, this solution is a tool made for those who wish to accurate calculate land values.
It is used to calculate the value of land and property. Configured according to the specificities of the local authorities, IGN FIâs CAMA solution strictly respects international assessment standards.
IGN FIâs CAMA solution works on an [[Geographic information system|GIS]] platform and is made up of 7 specific modules:
*Data management
*Analysis of market sales
*Estimation and choice of assessment methods

{{Geodesy}}
'''Israeli Cassini Soldner''' ({{lang-he|×¨×©×ª ××©×¨×× ×××©× ×}} ''Reshet Yisra'el Ha-Yeshana''; '''ICS''') is the old [[geographic coordinate system]] for [[Israel]].  The name is derived from the [[Cassini Soldner]] projection it uses and the fact that it is optimized for Israel.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} ICS has been mostly replaced by the new coordinate system [[Israeli Transverse Mercator]] (ITM), but still referenced by older books and navigation software.

==History==
The Cassini Soldner projection was used by the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], when it was called the [[Palestine grid]]. The Palestine grid reached as south as [[Beer-Sheba]]. To avoid the existence of negative coordinates in the southern [[Negev]], the [[Northing|False Northing]] of ICS was increased by 1000000.&lt;ref name=Gavish&gt;{{cite book | author = Dov Gavish | title = The Survey of Palestine under the British Mandate, 1920â1948 | publisher = RoutledgeCurzon | place = London and New York | year = 2005 | pages = 73â75|quote=In order to avoid negative values, the British set the value of the zero line at 1,000}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, coordinates in the south of Israel are higher than 800000.

==Examples==

An ICS coordinate is generally given as a pair of two numbers (excluding any digits behind a [[decimal point]] which may be used in very precise surveying). The first number is always the [[Easting]] and the second is the [[Northing]]. The easting and northing are in metres from the false [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]]. The easting is always a 6 digit number while the northing has 6 or 7 digits.

The ICS coordinate for the [[Western Wall]] at [[Jerusalem]] is:

:E 172249 m
:N 1131586 m

The first figure is the easting and means that the location is 172,249 meters east from the false origin (along the [[X axis]]). The second figure is the northing and puts the location 1,131,586 meters north of the false origin (along the [[Y axis]]). Also notice how the easting in this example is indicated with an âEâ and likewise an âNâ for the northing. The fact that the coordinate is in meters is indicated by the lowercase m.

The table below shows the same coordinate in 3 different grids:

'''Joseph Francis Charles Rock''' (1884 â 1962) was an Austrian-American [[List of explorers|explorer]], [[geographer]], [[linguistics|linguist]] and [[botanist]].

==Life==

He was born in [[Vienna]], Austria, went to Egypt at the age of 10 with his father, and later wandered about in Europe. But on an impulse, he emigrated to the United States in 1905 (New York) and moved to [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] in 1907, where he eventually became an authority on the [[flora (plants)|flora]] there. He first taught full-time (there were two others) at Mills College (now known as [[Mid-Pacific Institute]]), and was placed on leave in Sept. 1908 for health reasons (he needed to be out-of-doors). As the [[Territory of Hawaii]]'s first official botanist, he joined the faculty of the College of Hawaii; the name was changed in 1920 to become the [[University of Hawaii]] in 1911, established its first [[herbarium]], and served as its first curator from 1911 until 1920, when he left the college to spend the next few decades exploring the botany of Asia.&lt;ref name="uhnews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaii.edu/cgi-bin/uhnews?20090306090000 |title=Botanist, famed explorer honored at UH Manoa: Herbarium to carry name of Joseph F.

During the [[Ngolok rebellions (1917-1949)]] Rock witnessed repeated battles by the [[Ma Clique]]'s [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]] army against the [[Ngolok]] Tibetans in [[Xiahe County]] and [[Labrang Monastery]]. The Ma Muslim army left Tibetan skeletons scattered over a wide area, and the Labrang monastery was decorated with decapitated Tibetan heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YJqPc4tqSGEC&amp;pg=PT253&amp;dq=joseph+rock+labrang+severed+heads+of+tibetan+skeletons+work+of+ma&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qkbkTdfNPIWtgQferpC4Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=joseph%20rock%20labrang%20severed%20heads%20of%20tibetan%20skeletons%20work%20of%20ma&amp;f=false|title=Unbound: A True Story of War, Love, and Survival|author=Dean King|editor=|year=2010|publisher=Hachette Digital, Inc.|edition=illustrated|location=|page=|isbn=0-316-16708-8|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1929 battle of Xiahe near Labrang, decapitated Tibetan heads were used as ornaments by Chinese Muslim troops in their camp, 154 in total. Rock described "young girls and children"'s heads staked around the military encampment. Ten to fifteen heads were fastened to the saddle of every Muslim cavalryman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OzEOKNPsv2EC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=joseph+rock+tibetan+heads&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=80LkTbTFNdT1gAfWv6HEBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=joseph%20rock%20tibetan%20heads&amp;f=false|title=Peoples of the Buddhist world: a Christian prayer diary|author=Paul Hattaway|editor=|year=2004|publisher=William Carey Library|edition=|location=|page=4|isbn=0-87808-361-8|pages=|accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heads were "strung about the walls of the Moslem garrison like a garland of flowers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YszV1u_VCGAC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=joseph+rock+tibetan+heads&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xGjkTdnvIqHu0gHi4oyOBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=joseph%20rock%20tibetan%20heads&amp;f=false|title=Kingdom of Ten Thousand Things: An Impossible Journey from Kabul to Chiapas|author=Gary Geddes|editor=|year=2008|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|edition=illustrated|location=|page=175|isbn=1-4027-5344-6|pages=|accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, the [[University of Hawaii]] at Manoa named its herbarium after him.&lt;ref name="uhnews" /&gt; Works and collections by and from Rock are held in the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/299/ |title = Biographical Records of the Royal Mu Family |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1931 |accessdate = 2013-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plants named after him==
The Hawaiian endemic species ''Lobelia rockii'' of Molokai, and ''Peperonia Rockii''; ''Pandanus Rockii Martelli'' at [[Palmyra Atoll]]; the spectacular Rock's Tree Peony,  ''[[Paeonia rockii]]'' from the Gansu mountains of western China, and the yellow-berried [[Sorbus | mountain-ash]] ''Sorbus'' 'Joseph Rock'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/95813/Sorbus-Joseph-Rock/Details Royal Horticultural Society: ''Sorbus'' "Joseph Rock" ]&lt;/ref&gt; are named after Rock.

==Works==
In 1916, Rock wrote the principal scientific description of [[Palmyra Atoll]] in the central [[Pacific Ocean]].  In his later expeditions and studies in [[China]], [[Tibet]] and the eastern [[Himalaya Mountains|Himalayas]], he produced a 1,094-page [[dictionary]], numerous scholarly papers, and two [[history|histories]] of the [[Nakhi]] (Naxi) people and language of northwestern [[Yunnan]], which have been widely used for the study of [[Nakhi]] culture, language and religion. These books are out-of-print and, consequently, command very high prices in the rare book markets.

The most important of his written works are
* ''Palmyra Island with a Description of its Flora'', Honolulu, 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Palmyra Island with a Description of its Flora|author=[[Joseph F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5997">The '''(Great) Khurasan Road''' was the great [[trunk road]] connecting [[Baghdad]], the capital of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], with the northeastern province of [[Khurasan]] and thence to [[Central Asia]] and [[Chinese Empire|China]].

== Course ==
[[File:Khurasan Road from Baghdad to al-Rayy.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Khurasan Road from Baghdad to Rayy, according to Ibn Khordadbeh, with distances in ''[[farsakh]]s'']]
It is possibly the best described of the roads of the Abbasid realm;{{sfn|Le Strange|1905|p=9}} not only is it described in detail by [[Ibn Rustah]], but most other medieval Muslim geographers such as [[Qudama ibn Ja'far]] and [[Ibn Khordadbeh]] refer to it and give distances along its various stretches in their works.{{sfn|Le Strange|1905|pp=12, 85}} The road began at the Khurasan Gate on the eastern side of the [[Round city of Baghdad|Round City]] of [[al-Mansur]], and exited the city at the second Khurasan Gate of East Baghdad.{{sfn|Le Strange|1905|p=31}}

[[File:Khurasan Road from al-Rayy to Naysabur.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the road from Ray to Nishapur, with distances in ''farsakhs'']]
The first settlement after Baghdad was Nahrawan or Jisr Nahrawan ("Bridge of Nahrawan"), named after the great [[Nahrawan Canal]] which passed through it. In the Abbasid period it was prosperous, but was abandoned and fell in ruin when the road moved north to [[Ba'quba]]. The surrounding district was known as ''á¹¬arÄ«q-i-KhurÄsÄn'' after the Khurasan Road.{{sfn|Le Strange|1905|pp=59â61}} The next town was known in Arabic as Daskarah al-Malik ("Daskara of the [[malik|King]]"), and is identified with [[Sassanian]]-era [[Dastagird]]. Then followed [[Jalula]], near which a large Sasanian-era bridge crossed the [[Diyala River]], and [[Khanaqin|Khaniqin]], also the site of a major bridge, and [[Qasr Sjirin]], the "Castle of [[Shirin]]", named after the wife of the Sasanian shah [[Khosrow II]].{{sfn|Le Strange|1905|pp=62â63}} At [[Hulwan]], the road left the [[Mesopotamia]]n plain and entered the [[Zagros Mountains]] and the province of [[Jibal]].{{sfn|Le Strange|1905|pp=63, 191}} The road continued to Madharustan and finally exited the Hulwan pass at the town of [[Kerend-e Gharb|Kirind]] and the village of Khushan. Then followed Tazar or Qasr Yazid and al-Zubaydiya, where the road turned east towards [[Kirmanshah]] across the plain of Mayidasht or [[Mahidasht District|Mahidasht]]. On most of these localities, the Muslim geographers record the presence of remnants of Sasanian palaces.{{sfn|Le Strange|1905|pp=191â192}} From Kirmanshah the road continued to [[Hamadan]] and [[Sivah]], turned north to [[Rey, Iran|Rayy]], and from there passed east into the province of [[Qumis (region)|Qumis]].{{sfn|Le Strange|1905|p=228}} The road was the main lifeline of Qumis, and most of the province's towns were located along its course: [[Choara (Parthia)|Khuwar]], Qasr or Qariyat al-Milh (the "Salt Castle"), Ras al-Kalb ("Dog's Head", identifiable with [[Lasgird]]), [[Semnan, Iran|Samnan]], [[Damghan]], al-Haddadah ("the Forge") or [[Mihman-Dust]], and [[Bistam]]. Near Bistam, at the village of Badhash, the road entered Khurasan.{{sfn|Le Strange|1905|pp=364, 367â368}}

[[File:Transoxiana 8th century.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of Khurasan and Transoxiana in the early Islamic period]]
After entering Khurasan, the road divided in two: a northern branch, also called the "[[caravan (travellers)|caravan]] road", leading to [[Jajarm]], and thence via [[Azadvar]] to [[Nishapur]], and a shorter southern branch or "post road" along the edge of the [[Dasht-e Kavir]] desert, via [[Asadabad, Savadkuh|Asadabad]], Bahmanibad or [[Mazinan]], and [[Sabzivar]], again to Nishapur.{{sfn|Le Strange|1905|p=430}} Shortly after Nishapur, at Qasr al-Rih ("Castle of the Wind"), the road divided again into two branches leading southwest and northeast. The southwestern branch led to [[Herat]], from where it branched out further, with roads leading east to [[Ghur]], or via [[Asfuzar]] and [[Farah, Afghanistan|Farah]] south to [[Zaranj]] in [[Sijistan]].{{sfn|Le Strange|1905|pp=430â431}} The northeastern branch of the main road led from Qasr al-Rih via [[Mashhad]], [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], [[Mazdavand|Mazdaran]], and [[Sarakhs]] to [[Merv|Marw the Great]] and [[Marw al-Rudh]]. From Marw the Great the road continued to the crossing of the [[Oxus River]] at [[TÃ¼rkmenabat|Amul]] and on to [[Bukhara]] and [[Samarkand]]. From Marw al-Rudh a branch led south to Herat, while another went northeast to [[Balkh]] and, likewise crossing the Oxus, to [[Tirmidh]], whence it branched out to various roads into the districts of [[Saghaniyan]] and [[Khuttal]], while another branch led west to Bukhara and Samarkand.{{sfn|Le Strange|1905|pp=430â431, 472}} From Amul, another branch also led along the southern bank of the Oxus to [[Khwarizm]] and the [[Aral Sea]].{{sfn|Le Strange|1905|p=472}} From Samarkand, the road crossed the [[Zeravshan River|Sughd River]] and led to the town of [[Zaamin, Uzbekistan|Zamin]] in [[Usrushana]], east of the local capital, [[Bunjikath]]. There the road divided again, with one branch leading north to [[Shash]] and the lower course of the [[Jaxartes]], and the other east to the upper course of the Jaxartes, the [[Ferghana Valley]] and China.{{sfn|Le Strange|1905|pp=475, 488}}

'''''Laguna del Diamante''''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "lake of the diamond") is a lake located in the [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]], [[Argentina]], in the [[San Carlos Department, Mendoza|San Carlos Department]], some 198&amp;nbsp;km from [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]]. It covers a surface area of about 14.1&amp;nbsp;kmÂ² and is one of the largest freshwater resources in the Province. Nearby is [[Maipo (volcano)|Maipo]] [[volcano]]. The volcano and its reflection in the lake forms diamond-shape image, which gives the lake its name.
It is known for its stunning beauty.  However, few get the chance to see it because it is passable only in February and only via an off-road vehicle.

The lake was described by [[Antoine de Saint ExupÃ©ry]] in his book ''[[Wind, Sand and Stars]]'' as quoted, "...he [Guillaumet] caught sight of a dark horizontal blot which he recognized as a lake Laguna Diamante".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1098">'''Land use capability maps''' are maps created to represent the potential uses of a "unit" of land. They are measured using various indicators, although the most common are five physical factors ([[list of rock types|rock type]], [[:category:types of soil|soil type]], slope, [[erosion]] degree and type, and vegetation). In more scientific terms, these can be classed as [[lithology]], [[edaphology]], [[topography]], [[gradient]], and [[Biotic component|biotic]] features.

Land use capability maps must not be confused with land use maps. The former shows the potential uses (usually in relation to farming) whilst the latter shows the actual use for the land at the present time.

'''Laurentia''' is a [[bioregion]] atop the Laurentian [[craton]] in the northeastern [[United States]] and eastern [[Canada]], and centering on the Great Lakes. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.biohabitats.com/blog/thoughts-on-the-great-lakes-bioregion-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

The bioregion spans the [[Eastern Woodlands]] of [[North America]] from the easternmost part of the [[Great Plains]] to the Atlantic Coast of the [[Northeastern United States]] and [[Canadian Maritimes]]. From north to south, it spans from the edge of the [[boreal forest]] in Canada, generally up to approximately the 50th parallel give or take a couple degrees of latitude and south to approximately the [[Ohio River]], [[Potomac River]] and [[Ozarks]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://img26.imageshack.us/img26/3856/bioregions.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest [[ecoregion]] within Laurentia is called the [[Laurentian Mixed Forest Province]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/assistance/nrplanning/bigpicture/cwcs/profiles/lmf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/332430/Laurentian-mixed-forest&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional identity==

Along with the bioregional similarities throughout the region, and the water cycle of the Great Lakes and regional namesake [[Saint Lawrence River]], there are also strong cultural and economic connections in Laurentia. The [[Ambassador Bridge]] between [[Detroit]] and [[Windsor, Ontario]] is the busiest border crossing in North America. &lt;ref&gt;http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2011/10/21/pf-18859226.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Laurentian region was the destination of freed black slaves during the days of the [[Underground Railroad]], both in the northern U.S. states and in Canada. In the nineteenth century, the border was porous and to this day family ties between American and Canadian Laurentians continue.

Laurentia includes many of the largest North American cities, including [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Boston]], [[Toronto]], [[Detroit]], [[Indianapolis]], [[St. Louis]], [[Cleveland]], [[Montreal]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Baltimore]], Milwaukee, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and [[Minneapolis]]/St.Paul.

'''Succession to the [[Bahrain]]i throne''' is determined by [[primogeniture]] amongst the male descendants of Sheikh [[Isa bin Ali Al Khalifa]] (1848 â 1932). However, the ruling [[King of Bahrain]] has the right to appoint any of his other sons as his successor if he wishes to. The current ruler of [[Bahrain]] is King [[Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifah|Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifah]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6348">[[File:Saksen-Koburg Leopold-2a.jpeg|thumb|Right to the throne is derived from appropriate descent from [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]].]]
There are fifteen persons in the [[line of succession]] to the [[Monarchy of Belgium|Belgian throne]].

The monarch is considered to have acceeded to the throne upon her/his taking of the oath as required by article 91 of the constitution.

== Eligibility ==
Since 1991, [[Belgium]] practises [[absolute primogeniture]] among the descendants of [[Albert II of Belgium|King Albert II]] (then Prince of LiÃ¨ge). Descendants of earlier monarchs and princes are only eligible to succeed if male and descended from [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]] in male-line (i.e. according to [[agnatic primogeniture]]), meaning that descendants of all Belgian princesses not descended from Albert II are barred from the throne. There are no living princes of Belgium who are not descended from Albert II, so agnatic primogeniture ''de facto'' doesn't apply to anyone anymore and the right to succeed is effectively limited to Albert II's descendants.&lt;ref name="monarchie"/&gt;

A person is deprived of his or her rights to the crown if he or she marries without the consent of the monarch (or the consent of those exercising the monarch's powers). The lost right may be re-established by the monarch (or by those exercising the monarch's powers) in the event of parliamentary agreement. Should there be no eligible descendant of [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]], the reigning monarch may name his or her [[heir presumptive]] with the approval of the Parliament, but if she or he doesn't name the heir presumptive, the throne would eventually become vacant.&lt;ref name="heraldica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/belgian_succ.htm|website=www.heraldica.org|date=2 December 1999|author=FranÃ§ois Velde|title=The Belgian Succession|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When King Albert II's daughter [[Princess Astrid of Belgium|Astrid]] married [[Prince Lorenz of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este|Archduke Lorenz of Austria-Este]] in 1984, agnatic primogeniture being in effect, she had no succession rights and therefore did not seek the consent to her marriage. Following the introduction of absolute primogeniture among her father's descendants in 1991, it was deemed that she had obtained the necessary consent and thus assumed her place in the line along with her children.&lt;ref name="heraldica"/&gt;

=== Reported renunciation of Prince Amedeo ===
When [[Prince Amedeo of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este|Prince Amedeo]] married in 2014, it was reported that he did not ask his uncle King Philippe's permission,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/947/Royalty/article/detail/2406328/2015/07/28/Prins-Amedeo-niet-meer-troongerechtigd.dhtml&lt;/ref&gt; and had therefore lost his right to the Belgian throne.  However, on November 12, 2015, a Royal Decree was published which showed that consent had been given after the marriage retroactively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.metrotime.be/2015/11/24/news/le-prince-amedeo-reintegre-lordre-de-succession-au-trone/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125074948/http://fr.metrotime.be/2015/11/24/news/le-prince-amedeo-reintegre-lordre-de-succession-au-trone/ |archivedate=2015-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollo 17 Goodwill msg1.jpg|thumbnail|400px|Apollo 17 Goodwill message]]
This is a list of [[lunar sample displays]] from the [[Apollo program]] that were distributed through the United States and around the world. They include samples from the [[Apollo 11 lunar sample display|Apollo 11]] and [[Apollo 17 lunar sample display|Apollo 17]] missions conducted by [[NASA]] from 1969 to the 1970s.

The first human mission to the surface of the Moon returned a few dozen pounds/kilos of Lunar material (mainly rock and dust), and the US put about 0.05 grams in little display cases and gave them out all the U.S. states and the nations of the world, as well some extra political entities like the U.S. territories under administration.&lt;ReF&gt;[https://weather.com/science/space/news/search-states-missing-apollo-11-moon-rocks-continues-20130726]&lt;/ref&gt; This was done again with an Apollo 17 sample..&lt;ReF&gt;[https://weather.com/science/space/news/search-states-missing-apollo-11-moon-rocks-continues-20130726]&lt;/ref&gt;

The display cases included a lunar sample and small flag of the respective political entity that had been to the Moon and back. Something like 135 displays were gifted to nations of the world ''at that time'', so nations created since then are not included and some displays have been inherited from past nations

This article is about the [[ice cream]] varieties around the world.

==Argentina==
[[File:Helado.jpg|thumb|upright|An ice cream cone in [[Salta]], Argentina]]
While industrial ice cream exists in Argentina and can be found in supermarkets, restaurants or kiosks, and ice cream pops are sold on some streets and at the beaches, the most traditional Argentine ''helado'' (ice cream) is very similar to Italian [[gelato]], rather than US-style ice cream, and it has become one of the most popular desserts in the country. Among the most famous manufacturers are "Freddo," "Persicco," "Chungo", "Cremolatti" and "Munchi's," all of them located in [[Buenos Aires]]. Each city has its own ''heladerÃ­as'' (ice cream parlours) which offer different varieties of creamy and water-based ice creams, including both standard and regional flavours. There are hundreds of flavors but Argentina's most traditional and popular one is [[dulce de leche]], which has become popular abroad, especially in the US.

There are two kinds of ''heladerÃ­as'' in Argentina: the cheaper ones which sell ice cream with artificial ingredients (like ''Helarte'', ''Pirulo'', ''Sei Tu'' and the largest one, ''[[Grido HeladerÃ­a|Grido]]''), and the ones that sell ''helado artesanal'',&lt;ref name = "helado artesanal"&gt;{{cite web |year=2012 |url=http://www.heladoartesanal.com/ | title=Helado Artesanal (in Spanish) |publisher=INNOVAR |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; made with natural ingredients and usually distinguished by a logo featuring an ice cream cone and the letters HA. There are no regulations in Argentina regarding the amount of milk an ice cream can have. In fact, all ice cream parlors serve both cream-based and water-based ice cream (''helado a la crema'' and ''helado al agua'' respectively). Instead, the distinctions are made according to the quality of the ingredients.

A standard Argentine cone or cup contains two different flavours of ice cream. In addition to these, most ''heladerÃ­as'' offer ice-cream-based desserts like ''BombÃ³n Suizo'' (Swiss Bonbon: chocolate-covered chantilly ice cream filled with dulce de leche and sprinkled with nuts), ''BombÃ³n EscocÃ©s'' (Scottish Bonbon: same as the Swiss Bonbon, only with chocolate ice-cream and [[white chocolate]] topping), ''Cassata'' (strawberry, vanilla and chocolate ice cream) and ''Almendrado'' (almond ice cream sprinkled with almond [[praline]]).

==Australia and New Zealand==
[[File:IcecreamVanBatemansBayNSWAustralia.jpg|thumb|left|An ice cream van at [[Batemans Bay, New South Wales]], Australia]]
Per capita, [[Australia]]ns and [[New Zealand]]ers are among the leading ice cream consumers in the world, eating 18 litres and 20 litres each per year respectively, behind the [[United States]] where people eat 23 litres each per year.&lt;ref name="Ibisworld"&gt;{{cite web |year=2005 |url=http://www.ferret.com.au/articles/31/0c02a331.asp |title=Business Outlook: ice cream manufacturing (based on a report to be found through www.ibisworld.com.au) |publisher=Reed Business Information |accessdate=2006-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427031709/http://www.ferret.com.au/articles/31/0c02a331.asp |archivedate=2006-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Brands include [[Tip Top (icecream)|Tip Top]], [[Streets (ice cream)|Streets]], [[Peters Ice Cream|Peters]], [[Sara Lee (corporation)|Sara Lee]], [[New Zealand Natural]], [[Cadbury plc|Cadbury]], [[Baskin-Robbins]] and [[Bulla Dairy Foods]]. A popular ice cream flavour in New Zealand, Australia and Japan that originated in New Zealand is [[hokey pokey (ice cream)|hokey pokey]].

==China, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan==
Besides the popular flavour such as vanilla, chocolate, coffee, mango and strawberry, many Chinese ice-cream manufacturers also introduced other traditional flavours such as black sesame, red beans.

In recent years, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan dessert houses also serve ice-cream [[moon cake]] during the [[Mid-Autumn festival]] (moon festival).

[[Fried ice cream]] is served at street food stalls in Beijing.

==Cuba==
[[File:Coppelia2.jpeg|thumb|Interior of the landmark Coppelia ice cream parlor, Havana, Cuba]]

In [[Cuba]], ice cream is sold at the state-run [[Coppelia (ice cream parlor)|Coppelia]] chain of ice cream parlors. Coppelia was founded in 1966 by [[Fidel Castro]], his aim to introduce his love of dairy products to the Cuban masses and to prove that a communist enterprise could provide better ice cream and flavor selection than American brands. In the capital [[Havana]], the Coppelia parlor is an architectural icon and a major landmark and meeting place in the city.  In 2012, the Cuban newspaper ''[[Trabajadores]]'' exposed the short supply, poor service, and melted ice cream served at the landmark.&lt;ref name=kcet&gt;[http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/counties/los-angeles/a-california-architect-visits-cuba.html "A California Architect Visits Cuba", Patrick McGrew, ''KCET-TV'' (PBS Los Angeles), August 8, 201]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trab1&gt;[http://www.trabajadores.cu/news/20120401/258669-con-bolas-huecas-no-hay-jonron Sundred Suzarte Medina, "Con bolas huecas no hay jonrÃ³n", Trabajadores, April 1, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finland==
The first ice cream manufacturer in Finland was the Italian Magi family, who opened the ''Helsingin jÃ¤Ã¤telÃ¶tehdas'' in 1922 and ''Suomen Eskimo Oy''. Other manufacturers soon spawned, like ''Pietarsaaren jÃ¤Ã¤telÃ¶tehdas'' (1928â2002).

Finland's first ice cream bar opened at the [[Lasipalatsi]] in 1936, and at the same time another manufacturer, ''MaanviljelijÃ¤in Maitokeskus'' started their production.

Today, the two largest ice cream manufacturers are [[Ingman]] and [[NestlÃ©]] (who bought [[Valio]]jÃ¤Ã¤telÃ¶). Finland is also the leading consumer of ice cream in Europe, with 13.7 litres per person in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmmtike.fi/fi/index/tiedotteet/tiedotteet2004/040629_ravintotase03.html Tike web page on consumer habits]&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
In 1651, Italian Francesco dei Coltelli opened an ice cream cafÃ© in [[Paris]] and the product became so popular that during the next 50 years another 250 cafÃ©s opened in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Visser|first=Margaret|title=Much Depends on Dinner|publisher=Grove Atlantic Press|year=1999|edition=illustrated|page=297|isbn=978-0-8021-3651-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iijF4QSwPssC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA297,M1|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.procope.com/|title=Restaurant Le Procope|publisher=procope.com|language=Italian|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people eat heart or log shaped cakes made of ice cream on [[New Year's Eve]] or [[New Year's Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/france/new-year-day|title=New Year's Day in France|publisher=timanddate.com|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==

[[File:Spaghettieis fcm.jpg|thumb|[[Spaghettieis]], a German ice cream dish made to look like a plate of Spaghetti.]]

One of the first well known Italian ice cream parlors (''Eisdiele'') was founded in Munich in 1879 and run by the Sarcletti family. This traditional family business was handed from generation to generation ever since. Since the 1920s, when many Italians immigrated and set up business, the traditional ice cream parlors became very popular. A popular German ice cream dish is [[Spaghettieis]], created by Dario Fontanella in the 1960s and made to look like a plate of spaghetti. 

About 80% percent of the ice cream sold in Germany is produced industrially, with the leading manufacturer being [[Unilever]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ice Cream in Germany|url=http://www.euromonitor.com/ice-cream-in-germany/report|publisher=EuroMonitor.com|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 17% is produced commercially and the remaining 3% is produced for the [[soft serve]] sector. In 2013, Germany had the largest market for ice cream in Europe at $2.7 billion revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ice cream nation: German market most valuable in Europe|url=http://www.dw.com/en/ice-cream-nation-german-market-most-valuable-in-europe/a-17827040|publisher=DW.com|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fanmilk-gh.net/internet/index.php?CatId=87 :: Fan Milk Limited :: - The Company] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024025713/http://www.fanmilk-gh.net/internet/index.php?CatId=87 |date=2008-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ghanaian treat FanIce was created by the Fan Milk Limited Company. FanIce comes in [[garden strawberry|strawberry]], [[chocolate]], and [[vanilla]]. FanMilk also makes additional products, though FanIce is the closest to Western ice cream. Pouches of FanIce and other FanMilk products can be bought from men on bikes equipped with chill boxes in any moderately sized town, and in cities large enough for grocery stores. FanMilk can also be bought in tubs for eating at home. In 2006, FanMilk was voted best ice-cream in the world.{{who|date=December 2010}}

Ice cream in its modern form, or pagotÃ³ ({{lang-el|ÏÎ±Î³ÏÏÏ}}), was introduced in Greece along its development in Europe in the beginning of the 20th century. Earlier than that, ice treats have been enjoyed in the country since ancient times. During the 5th century BC, ancient [[Greeks]] ate snow mixed with honey and fruit in the markets of Athens. The father of modern medicine, [[Hippocrates]], encouraged his Ancient Greek patients to eat ice ''"as it livens the lifejuices and increases the well-being."''&lt;ref name="Norway"&gt;
{{cite web |year=2005 |url=http://www.norway.org/food/recipes/sorbet_and_ice_cream.htm |title=Norway - the official site in the United States |work=What's Cooking: (N)ice and cold |publisher=The Government of Norway et al. |accessdate=2006-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century BC, it was well known that a favorite treat of [[Alexander the Great]] was snow ice mixed with honey and [[nectar]].&lt;ref&gt;

Greek ice cream recipes have some unique flavours such as '''Pagoto Kaimaki''' ({{lang-el|Î Î±Î³ÏÏÏ ÎÎ±ÏÎ¼Î¬ÎºÎ¹}}), made from [[mastic (plant resin)|mastic]]-[[resin]] which gives it an almost chewy texture, and '''Salepi''', used as a thickening agent to increase resistance to melting, both giving a unique taste to the ice cream; '''Pagoto Elaeolado me syko''' ({{lang-el|ÎÎ»Î±Î¹ÏÎ»Î±Î´Î¿ Î¼Îµ ÏÏÎºÎ¿}}), made of olive oil and [[ficus|figs]]; '''Pagoto Kataifi cocoa''' ({{lang-el|Î Î±Î³ÏÏÏ ÎÎ±ÏÎ±ÎÏÎ¹ ÎºÎ±ÎºÎ¬Î¿}}), made from the shredded filo dough pastry that resembles angel's hair pasta, similar to [[vermicelli]] but much thinner; and '''Pagoto Mavrodaphne''' ({{lang-el|ÎÎ±ÏÏÎ¿Î´Î¬ÏÎ½Î· Î Î±Î³ÏÏÏ}}), made from a Greek [[dessert wine]]. Fruity [[Spoon sweets|Greek Sweets of the Spoon]] are usually served as toppings with Greek-inspired ice cream flavors.

==India==
India is one of the largest producers of ice cream in the world, but most of its ice cream is consumed domestically. India also has a domestic ice cream product known as "[[Kulfi]]" or "Matka Kulfi", which is famous in small towns and villages. Major brands are AMUL, Kwality, Vadilal, Mother Dairy, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://dare.co.in/opportunities/other-business-opportunities/ice-cream-industry-in-india.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euromonitor.com/ice-cream-in-india/report&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecolorsofindia.com/interesting-facts/business/india-largest-selling-icecream.html&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times, many domestic ice cream companies have opened their exclusive outlets in metros and several international ice-cream companies also started their operation in India.

==Indonesia==
In [[Indonesia]] there is a type traditional ice cream called "Es Puter" or "stirred ice cream". It's made from some ingredients: [[coconut milk]], pandanus leaves and [[sugar]], with flavouring: [[avocado]], [[jackfruit]], [[durian]], [[palm sugar]], [[chocolate]], [[Adzuki bean|red bean]], [[mung bean]] or our favourite flavor.

==Iran==
{{main|Bastani Sonnati}}
[[Faloodeh|FÄlÅ«de]] (Persian: ÙØ§ÙÙØ¯Ù) or PÄlÅ«de (Persian: Ù¾Ø§ÙÙØ¯Ù) is a Persian sorbet made of thin vermicelli noodles frozen with corn starch, rose water, lime juice, and often ground pistachios. It is a traditional dessert in Iran and Afghanistan. It was brought to the Indian subcontinent during the Mughal period. The faloodeh of Shiraz is famous.

Faloodeh is one of the earliest forms of frozen desserts, having existed as early as 400 BC. Ice was brought down from high mountains and stored in tall refrigerated buildings called yakhchals, which were kept cool by windcatchers.

There is also a drink called faloodeh, but it is made using other ingredients.

==Italy==
{{Main|Italian ice cream|Neapolitan ice cream}}
[[File:Ponte-Vecchio-ice-cream-0851.jpg|right|thumb|A gelato stall on [[Ponte Vecchio]], [[Florence]]]]

Italian ice cream or [[Gelato]] as it is known, is a traditional and a popular dessert in [[Italy]]. Much of the production is still hand-made and flavoured by each individual shop in "produzione propria" gelaterias. Gelato is made from whole milk, sugar, sometimes eggs, and natural flavourings. Gelato typically contains 7-8% fat, less than ice cream's minimum of 10%. Before the cone became popular for serving ice cream, in English speaking countries, Italian street vendors would serve the ice cream in a small glass dish referred to as a "[[penny lick]]" or wrapped in [[Wax paper|waxed paper]] and known as a [[hokey pokey (ice cream)|hokey-pokey]] (possibly a corruption of the [[Italian language|Italian]] "ecco un poco" - "here is a little").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hokey Pokey and All That: The history of ice cream |author=Edmund Forte |url=http://www.edmundforte.co.uk/141633.html}} â Forte presents this and several alternative hypotheses.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most known artisanal gelato machine makers are Italian companies [[Carpigiani]], Crm-Telme, Corema-Telme, Technogel, Cattabriga and high capacity industrial plants made by Catta 27 and Cogil and Teknoice.

==Japan==
[[File:Mochi Ice Cream.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mochi ice cream]] sold in Japan]]
Ice cream is also a popular dessert in Japan, with almost two in five adults eating some at least once a week, according to a 2007 survey.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Since 1999, the Japanese Ice Cream Association has been publishing the Ice Cream [[White paper|White Paper]] once a year, and the four most popular ice cream flavours in Japan have not changed (including their order) since 1999, according to the paper.&lt;ref name="JICA"&gt;[http://www.icecream.or.jp/data/hakusho05.html ''Vanilla holds an unshakable top position in favorite ice cream flavours.''], Japanese Ice Cream Association, Ice Cream White Paper 2006. Tokyo, Japan. Retrieved on 2006-10-21 (Japanese).&lt;/ref&gt; The top four flavours are [[vanilla]], [[chocolate]], ''[[matcha]]'' (powdered [[green tea]]), and [[garden strawberry|strawberry]]. Other notable popular flavours are [[milk]], [[caramel (aroma)|caramel]], and [[azuki]] (red bean) also according to the paper.&lt;ref name="JICA"/&gt; ''Azuki'' is particularly favored by people in their 50s and older.&lt;ref name="JICA"/&gt;

==Laos==
A typical variety is [[Pandanus amaryllifolius|Laotian vanilla]] ice cream made from pandan ("Laotian vanilla").

==Norway==
It is known that the Italian [[Giovanni Zazzera]] made and sold "iscrem" in Stavanger from 1910. He had been living in Oslo for five years before that, and could therefore have sold ice cream in Norway as early as 1905.

==Pakistan==
Pakistan has an ice cream brand [[OMORÃ]], the products of which are exported to Europe and America. Beside this other large ice cream brands from Pakistan include [[Eat More Ice Cream]] and [[Yummy (ice cream)|Yummy]]. These companies receive most of their profit from within the country. Pakistani Peshawari ice cream is very famous in [[South Asia]] and [[Middle East]].

The most popular flavours in Pakistan are Pista, Kulfa, Vanilla and Chocolate.

==Philippines==
{{Main|Sorbetes}}
[[File:Sorbetes.jpg|thumb|A woman purchasing strawberry sorbetes from a street vendor in the Philippines]]

[[Sorbetes]] is a Philippine version for common ice cream usually peddled from carts that roam streets in the Philippines. This should not be confused with the known sorbet. It is also commonly called 'dirty ice cream' because it is sold along the streets exposing it to [[pollution]] and that the factory where it comes from is usually unknown; though it is not really "dirty" as the name implies. It is usually served with small wafer or sugar cones and recently, bread buns.

==Spain==
Ice cream, in the style of Italian gelato, can be found in many cafes or specialty ice cream stores throhoughout Spain. Usually the flavours reflect local tastes like nata, [[crema catalana]], or [[tiramisu]].

There are also industrial producers like [[Unilever|Frigo]] (owned by [[Unilever]]), [[Camy]] (later merged into NestlÃ©), [[Avidesa]], [[Menorquina]], many of them are part of transnational groups. The industrial producers also serve [[ice cream sandwich]]es and ''polos'', ice cream on a stick, such as [[Magnum (ice cream)|Magnum]], sometimes with whimsical shapes like the foot-shaped ''FrigopiÃ©''.

Unlike in Northern Europe, ice cream is consumed mostly in summer. Hence, some ice cream stores become hot-chocolate cafÃ©s in winter.

==Syria==
{{main|Booza}}
[[File:Bakdash ice-cream shop in the old souk in Damascus.jpg|thumb|200px|Booza being sold in the [[Bakdash (ice cream parlor)|Bakdash]] ice cream shop in the [[Al-Hamidiyah Souq]] in Old city of Damascus]]

Booza ({{lang|ar|Ø§ÙØ¢ÙØ³ ÙØ±ÙÙ ÙØ§ÙÙØ¨Ù}} in [[Arabic]]: "milk ice cream", also called "Arabic ice cream") is a [[Mastic (plant resin)|mastic]]-based [[ice cream]].  It is elastic, sticky, and resistant to melting in the hotter climates of the [[Arab world]], where it is most commonly found.

The ice cream is usually and traditionally made with an ingredient called ''sahlab'' ({{lang|ar|Ø³ÙØ­ÙÙÙØ¨}})  or ''[[salep]]'', which provides it with the ability to resist melting. ''Salep'' is also a primary ingredient in the Turkish version of this style of ice cream called ''[[dondurma]]''.

==Turkey==
{{main|Dondurma}}
[[File:Ä°stiklal Caddesi 102.JPG|thumb|A man purchasing dondurma from a street vendor in Turkey]]

Dondurma (in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''MaraÅ dondurmasÄ±'', meaning "the ice cream of the city of [[KahramanmaraÅ|MaraÅ]]", also called ''DÃ¶vme dondurma'', meaning "battered ice cream") is a Turkish [[Mastic (plant resin)|mastic]] [[ice cream]].  It is similar to the [[Syria]]n dessert [[booza]].

Dondurma typically includes the ingredients [[cream]], [[whipped cream]], ''[[salep]]'', [[mastic (plant resin)|mastic]], and [[sugar]]. It is believed to originate from the city and region of [[KahramanmaraÅ|MaraÅ]] and hence also known as MaraÅ ice cream.&lt;ref&gt;Naver Kowledgeins, "Turkey Ice-cream". Naver. 2004, February 8th. 24 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, 14 million adults buy ice cream as a treat, in a market worth Â£1.3 billion (according to a report produced in September 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.just-food.com/store/product.aspx?id=81857|title=Ice Cream - UK - September 2009|date=September 2009|work=just-food.com|publisher=Aroq Ltd|accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A product may be sold as "ice cream" if it contains 5 per cent fat and not less than 2.5 per cent milk protein, but may contain non-milk [[vegetable fats and oils]], usually [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] [[palm kernel]] oil, a rule that is more permissive than many other countries. Only true ice cream made only with milk fats (though not necessarily cream) can be described as ''dairy ice cream'', and many companies make sure that ''dairy'' is prominently displayed on their packaging and advertising.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1499/schedule/8/made Schedule 8, the (UK) Food Labelling Regulations 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
[[File:Dairy Queen Blizzard.jpg|thumb|180px|A woman in South Dakota holding a [[Dairy Queen]] Blizzard, a commercial [[mix-in]]]]

In the United States, ice cream made with just cream, sugar, and a flavouring (usually fruit) is sometimes referred to as "Philadelphia style"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/PEACH-ICE-CREAM-PHILADELPHIA-STYLE-101911 |title=Peach Ice Cream, Philadelphia Style |accessdate=2008-09-24 |publisher=CondÃ©Net, Inc., reprinted from William Morrow and Co.'s ''The Ultimate Ice Cream Book'' |author=Weinstein, Bruce |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; ice cream. Ice creams made with eggs, usually in the form of [[frozen custard]]s, are sometimes called "French" ice creams or traditional ice cream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Irma S. |last=Rombauer |author2=Marion R. Becker |authorlink=Irma S. Rombauer |year=1975 |title=[[The Joy of Cooking]] |isbn=978-0-672-52385-4 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |location=[[Indianapolis, Indiana]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American federal labeling standards require ice cream to contain a minimum of 10% [[Butterfat|milk fat]] (about 7&amp;nbsp;grams (g) of fat per 1/2 cup [120 mL] serving), 20% total milk solids by weight, to weigh no less than 4.5 pounds per gallon (in order to put a limit on replacing ingredients with air), and to contain less than 1.4% egg yolk solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisdairy.com/OtherDairyProductInfo/IceCream/Default.aspx |title=Ice Cream |accessdate=2008-08-09 |publisher=Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board |author=National Dairy Council |year=2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827205633/http://wisdairy.com/OtherDairyProductInfo/IceCream/Default.aspx |archivedate=2008-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA Frozen Desserts 21 CFR 135.110(a)(2)|url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/aprqtr/21cfr135.110.htm|publisher=FDA|accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal government regulations pertaining to the process of making ice cream, allowable ingredients, and standards, may be found in Part 135 of Title 21 of the ''Code of Federal Regulations''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate2.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=76465419768+1+0+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve 21 CFR Part 135]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;21 CFR Â§ 135.110(a)(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Americans consume about 23 liters of ice cream per person per year&amp;nbsp;â the most in the world. As a foodstuff it is deeply ingrained into the American psyche and has been available in America since its founding in 1776: there are records of Thomas Jefferson serving it as a then-expensive treat to guests at his home in Monticello. In American supermarkets it is not uncommon for ice cream and related products to take up a wall full of freezers.  All different kinds of ice cream fill the walls with strawberry, chocolate, vanilla, among other flavors.

Although chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry are the traditional favorite flavors of ice cream, and once enjoyed roughly equal popularity, [[vanilla]] has grown to be the most popular, most likely because of its use as a topping for fruit based [[pie]]s and its use as the key ingredient for [[milkshakes]]. According to the International Ice Cream Association (1994), supermarket sales of ice cream break down as follows: vanilla, 28%; fruit flavours, 15%; nut flavours, 13.5%; candy mix-in flavours, 12.5%; chocolate, 8%; cake and cookie flavours, 7.5%; Neapolitan, 7%; and coffee/mocha, 3%. Other flavours combine to make 5.5%. Sales in ice cream parlors are more variable, as new flavours come and go, but about three times as many people call vanilla their favorite compared to chocolate, the runner-up.

In 2006, [[Tauatomo Mairau]] [[Pretender|claimed]] to be the heir to the Tahitian throne, and attempted to re-assert the status of the monarchy in court. His claims were not recognized by France.&lt;ref name="RNZI_21731"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=21731 |title=Tahitian royal forms government |date=22 January 2006 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RNZI_44554"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=44554 |title=Tahitian land activist claims France disregards 19th century treaties |date=3 February 2009 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 May 2009, [[:fr:Joinville Pomare|Joinville PÅmare]], an adopted member of the PÅmare family, declared himself King PÅmare XI, during a ceremony attended by descendants of leading chiefs but spurned by members of his own family. Other members of the family recognised his uncle, [[LÃ©opold PÅmare]], as heir to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tahitipresse.pf/index.cfm?snav=see&amp;presse=27682 "Joinville Pomare s'est fait introniser roi Pomare XI"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Tahitipresse]], 28 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ladepeche.pf/fenua/culture/4920-joinville-lhomme-qui-voulait-etre-roi.html "Joinville, lâhomme qui voulait Ãªtre roi...

He attempted to have royal trust lands returned to him and his family. The French government mortgaged the land after [[World War II]], and in doing so violated the terms of the agreement signed with [[Pomare V]] in 1880 which reserved control of the trust lands for the royal family of Tahiti. The banks may be in the process of freezing the assets, and Mairau sued to prevent [[Tahitians|native Tahitians]] from being evicted from his trust lands, and wished for them to retain their usage rights over the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kingâ Mairau forges links between Tahiti and Cooks |url=http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/index_dynamic/containerNameToReplace=MiddleMiddle/focusModuleID=130/focusContentID=18775/tableName=mediaRelease/overideSkinName=newsArticle-full.tpl |work=Kingâ Mairau forges links between Tahiti and Cooks |accessdate=9 June 2011 |date=17 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308071600/http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/index_dynamic/containerNameToReplace%3DMiddleMiddle/focusModuleID%3D130/focusContentID%3D18775/tableName%3DmediaRelease/overideSkinName%3DnewsArticle-full.tpl |archivedate=8 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New republic of Hau Pakumotu is the world's newest country|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/editorial/story.html?id=e60d8e6c-bd26-4787-8a72-ad4a1831f052|work=New republic of Hau Pakumotu is the world's newest country|accessdate=5 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110160433/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/editorial/story.html?id=e60d8e6c-bd26-4787-8a72-ad4a1831f052|archivedate=10 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4794">'''Navigational instruments''' refers to the instruments used by nautical navigators and pilots as tools of their trade. The purpose of navigation is to ascertain the present position and to determine the speed, direction etc. to arrive at the port or point of destination.

==Charts and drafting instruments==
*'''[[Nautical chart|Charts]]''' are maps of the areas to be navigated with details specific to the marine environment.
*'''Computing aids''': used in the necessary mathematical calculations. Today electronic [[computers]] or [[calculators]] are used.  Other traditional aids used included tables (trigonometric, logarithms, etc.) and [[slide rules]].
*'''[[Caliper#Divider caliper|Dividers]]''' used for measuring lengths of lines and approximate lengths of non-linear paths on a chart.
*'''[[Nautical almanac]]''' used to determine the position in the sky of a celestial body after a sight has been taken.
*'''[[Parallel rulers|Parallel rules]]''' used for transferring a line to a parallel position.  Also used to compare the orientation of a line to a magnetic or geographic orientation on a [[compass rose]].

==Direct measuring==
*'''[[Chip log]] and [[hourglass|sand glass]]''' serve to measure the ship's speed through the water.
*'''[[Sounding line]]''' used to measure the depth of the water and to pick up samples from the bottom.

==Position finding instruments==

===Celestial navigation instruments===

These instruments are used primarily to measure the elevation or altitude of a [[celestial object]]:

*'''[[Back staff]]''', the best known of which is the Davis' quadrant.  It could measure the altitude of the sun without having the navigator directly observe the sun.
*'''[[Cross staff]]''', an older instrument long out of use.
*'''[[Kamal (navigation)|Kamal]]''' Very simple instrument used primarily by Arabian navigators. It consists of a small board with a knotted piece of twine through the center. The observer holds one of the knots in his mouth and extends the board away so that the edges make a constant angle with his eyes.
*'''[[Mariner's astrolabe]]''' Derived from the [[astrolabe]], it was developed in late 15th century and found use in the 16th to 17th centuries.  It was replaced by the [[back staff]] and later by the [[octant (instrument)|octant]] and [[sextant]].
*'''[[Quadrant (instrument)|Quadrant]]''' A very simple instrument which used a plumb bob.

These instruments are also used to measure the angular distance between objects:

*'''[[Octant (instrument)|Octant]]''', invented in 1731.  The first widely accepted instrument that could measure an angle without being strongly affected by movement.
*'''[[Sextant]]''', derived from the octant in 1757, eventually made all previous instruments used for the same purpose obsolete.

===Bearing instruments===
*'''[[Pelorus (instrument)|Pelorus]]''' used to determine bearings relative to the ship's heading of landmarks, other ships, etc.

===Compasses===
*'''[[Bearing compass]]''' used to determine magnetic bearings of landmarks, other ships or celestial bodies.
*'''[[Magnetic compass]]''' used to determine the magnetic heading of the ship.

===Timekeeping===
*'''[[Marine chronometer]]''' used to determine time at the [[prime meridian]] with great precision which is necessary when reducing sights in celestial navigation.
*'''[[Nocturnal (instrument)|Nocturnal]]''' used to determine apparent local time by viewing the [[Polaris]] and its surrounding stars.
*'''[[Sundial#Ring dials|Ring dial]]''' or '''astronomical ring''' used to measure the height of a celestial body above the horizon. It could be used to find the altitude of the sun or determine local time.  It let sunlight shine through a small orifice on the rim of the instrument.  The point of light striking the far side of the instrument gave the altitude or tell time.

All those mentioned were the traditional instruments used until well into the second half of the 20th century.  After World War II electronic aids to navigation developed very rapidly and, to a great extent, replaced more traditional tools. Electronic speed and depth finders have totally replaced their older counterparts.  [[Radar]] has become widespread even in small boats.  Some Electronic aids to navigation like [[LORAN]] have already become obsolete themselves and have been replaced by [[GPS]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6866">The '''Scientific Monument Moises Bertoni''' is located in the District of [[Presidente Franco District|Presidente Franco]], Department of [[Alto ParanÃ¡ Department|Alto ParanÃ¡]], [[Paraguay]] riverside [[Rio ParanÃ¡|ParanÃ¡]], approximately 26&amp;nbsp;km of the city of Presidente Franco and was recognized on April 13, 1955, has an area of 199 hectares. 

This monument was the home of wise Swiss [[MoisÃ©s Santiago Bertoni|Moses Santiago Bertoni]] (born 1857 [[Lottigna]], [[Ticino]], Switzerland, died 1929 [[Foz do IguaÃ§u|Foz de Iguazu]], Paraguay), which eventually settled in this area while still young, and provided invaluable services to the people and Paraguayan Government. He became Minister of Agriculture, of Paraguay. He died at this site in 1929.

== His house ==
[[Image:Casa del sabio moises bertoni.png|thumb|left|220px|Bertoni`s house]]
It is home to the history and life of a Swiss man who investigated and learned about the culture of the [[Guarani people|GuaranÃ­]] probably more than any other European time. [[MoisÃ©s Santiago Bertoni|Moses Bertoni]] was a real [[idealist]] and passionate [[botanist]] who established his family in the jungles of Paraguay in 1894 to implement their ideals anarchists from Europe. 

[[Image:Bertoni laborat.png|thumb|right|280px|Bertoni`s laboratory]]
He ended up falling in love with the GuaranÃ­ culture, their beliefs and people who knew. Probably his most significant contribution was his passion to promote and protect the GuaranÃ­ culture and its people unknowingly today has left a legacy of great influence in the cultural identity in Paraguay.

His house was also his laboratory, library and printing, where he printed his scientific papers (most of them never became public in the scientific community). All the forms that were issued in this place had the logo'' 'Ex silvis''' (from the jungle). The timing of rain and predictions were used by Paraguayan, Brazilian and Argentine farmers for decades after his death. He was a meticulous observer of nature and the GuaranÃ­, who lived with him in his colony, classifying and studying thousands of plants and was able to learn from them many uses of medicinal herbs. 

In the ten halls of the museum personal objects, manuscripts, books, letters, part of the library seven thousand volumes and a reconstitution of the laboratory and the graphical Bertoni can be observed. The ensemble is considered by specialists of important historical reference in the sciences to which Bertoni and his sons devoted decades of study.

== The monument==

[[Image:Bertoni rio parana.png|thumb|250px|left| ParanÃ¡ River view from Bertoni`s house]]
The monument consists of 199 hectares, legally protected since 1955. This site normally inhabited the park rangers who look after the place and a community of indigenous [[Mbya]]. 

One thing unusual is that the cemetery of the family Bertoni descendants is a few meters from the house. Because it was a prolific family, after the death of sage, several descendants were buried there, until it was banned.

==Animals and Plants==

In this area can be seen legacies of wise Bertoni in [[botany]], [[zoology]], [[meteorology]], [[anthropology]] and other sciences. Here we guard a small area of the Atlantic forest of the [[ParanÃ¡ River]], with species such as palm (Euterpe edulis), Kuri'u ([[araucaria angustifolia]]), [[fern]] tree, JacuÃ­-APETI (bored jacutinga), the woodpecker ([[Dryocopus galeatus]]), among others, which are endangered and some emerging water and waterfalls. 

There are also essays, agroforestry experimental investigations, it is estimated that about 60% of plant species were introduced by Moises Bertoni. 

Many of these species only exist in this place, because they are alien species that were introduced by the wise, product of his exchange with experts from other latitudes, which was communicated through letters.

== Location ==

The area is bounded by natural boundaries: in the north by the river [[Saltos del Monday|Monday]], in the east by the ParanÃ¡ River, south across the stream ItÃ¡ Coty, and west along the route which connects with Presidente Franco [[Los Cedrales]].

== How to get there ==

It is a 26&amp;nbsp;km from [[Ciudad del Este]], taking the superhighway south. 10&amp;nbsp;km is reached the city of [[Presidente Franco District|Presidente Franco]], take the road to [[Los Cedrales]] other 10&amp;nbsp;km there is a poster indicator, and enters into left (towards the river Parana) about 5&amp;nbsp;km and 15&amp;nbsp;km latter are dirt roads. Access is not good, but with a little patience can be done in light vehicles.

== Tourism ==

The '''Puerto Bertoni''', as called Paraguayans, is a tourist site of unique beauty, due to its strategic location on the banks of the ParanÃ¡ River, where this winding river that still runs squeezed, makes a shift of 70 degrees . 

Currently, tourism is operated by Brazilian and Argentine companies, which include within its circuit cataracts and the three borders, a ride in boats, and arrive daily until this place by the river. 

On the beach, the indigenous mbya, at dusk make their tribal dance and then offer visitors, handicrafts made by them. 

Later visitors climb up the house (about 600 mts.) to visit the museum and enjoy their journeys.

==Ecology==

It has an ecological value as representing the native ecosystem, a unique place, where they are housed research work, the wise Swiss [[MoisÃ©s Santiago Bertoni|Moises Santiago Bertoni]], who lived in Paraguay, the Paraguayan rich flora, this museum was restored recently. The aim is to protect one of the last wild areas of Alto ParanÃ¡, and also the conservation of natural resources, especially forests.

==Weather==

The average annual temperature is 21 Â°C, the highest reaches 38 Â°C and the minimum 0 Â°C. The highest annual amount of the country in rainfall occurs in the region of Alto ParanÃ¡. There are permanent dew and fog in winter.

==Indigenous==

The property that Moises Bertoni had acquired from Paraguayan government was within the territory of [[Mbya]]. The remaining 199 hectares of the former property and that today make up the Monument Scientific Moses Bertoni are still three villages populated by indigenous, who make up approximately 10 to {{convert|12|acre|m2}} in two plots inhabited by 200 Indians near one another.

The '''shoelace formula''' or '''shoelace algorithm''' (also known as '''[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]'s area formula''' and the '''[[surveying|surveyor]]'s formula'''&lt;ref name="Braden"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bart Braden|title=The Surveyorâs Area Formula|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=17|issue=4|year=1986|pages=326â337|url=http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/pubs/Calc_Articles/ma063.pdf|doi=10.2307/2686282}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a mathematical [[algorithm]] to determine the [[area]] of a [[simple polygon]] whose vertices are described by their [[Cartesian coordinates]] in the plane.&lt;ref name="mathreference" /&gt; The user [[Cross product|cross-multiplies]] corresponding coordinates to find the area encompassing the polygon, and subtracts it from the surrounding polygon to find the area of the polygon within. It is called the shoelace formula because of the constant cross-multiplying for the coordinates making up the polygon, like tying shoelaces.&lt;ref name="mathreference"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dahlke|first=Karl|title=Shoelace Formula|url=http://www.mathreference.com/la-det,shoe.html|accessdate=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sometimes called the '''shoelace method'''.  It has applications in surveying and forestry,&lt;ref name="Pretzsch"&gt;Hans Pretzsch, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZLNZMCSuUAQC&amp;pg=PA232 Forest Dynamics, Growth and Yield: From Measurement to Model]'', Springer, 2009, {{isbn|3-540-88306-1}}, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; among other areas.

The formula was described by Meister (1724-1788) in 1769&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The area formula is derived by taking each edge ''AB'', and calculating the (signed) area of triangle ''ABO'' with a vertex at the origin ''O'', by taking the cross-product (which gives the area of a parallelogram) and dividing by 2. As one wraps around the polygon, these triangles with positive and negative area will overlap, and the areas between the origin and the polygon will be cancelled out and sum to 0, while only the area inside the reference triangle remains. This is why the formula is called the Surveyor's Formula, since the "surveyor" is at the origin; if going counterclockwise, positive area is added when going from left to right and negative area is added when going from right to left, from the perspective of the origin.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The area formula is valid for any non-self-intersecting ([[Simple polygon|simple]]) polygon, which can be convex or concave.

==Definition==
The formula can be represented by the expression

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} \mathbf{A} &amp; = {1 \over 2} \Big | \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_iy_{i+1} + x_ny_1 - \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_{i+1}y_i - x_1y_n \Big | \\
 &amp; = {1 \over 2}|x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + \cdots + x_{n-1}y_n + x_ny_1 - x_2y_1 - x_3y_2 - \cdots - x_ny_{n-1} - x_1y_n| \\ \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where

* ''A'' is the area of the polygon,
* ''n'' is the number of sides of the polygon, and
* (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;), ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,...,&amp;nbsp;''n'' are the vertices (or "corners") of the polygon.

Weisstein|work=Wolfram MathWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = {1 \over 2} \Big | \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i(y_{i+1}-y_{i-1}) \Big | = {1 \over 2} \Big | \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i(x_{i+1}-x_{i-1}) \Big | = {1 \over 2} \Big | \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_iy_{i+1}-x_{i+1}y_i \Big | = {1 \over 2} \Big | \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i+1}+x_i)(y_{i+1}-y_{i}) \Big | = {1 \over 2} \Big | \sum_{i=1}^{n} \det\begin{pmatrix} x_i &amp; x_{i+1} \\ y_i &amp; y_{i+1} \end{pmatrix} \Big | &lt;/math&gt;

where
''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,
as well as
''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

If the points are labeled sequentially in the counterclockwise direction, then the sum of the above [[determinant]]s is positive and the absolute value signs can be omitted;&lt;ref name="Braden" /&gt; if they are labeled in the clockwise direction, the sum of the determinants will be negative. This is because the formula can be viewed as a special case of [[Green's Theorem]].

==Proofs==

===Proof for a triangle===
[[File:Triangle area from coordinates JCB.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Given the coordinates of a triangle, find its area &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;.]]

Referring to the figure, let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; be the area of the triangle whose vertices are given by the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2),&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_3,y_3).&lt;/math&gt; Draw the minimum area rectangle around the triangle so its sides are parallel to the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axes. At least one vertex of the triangle will be on a corner of the rectangle. In the figure, the areas of the three surrounding triangles are &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}, \mathbf{D},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}.&lt;/math&gt; Obviously &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the area of the rectangle (call it &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;) minus the areas of the other three triangles. The equation describing this relationship is

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{R}-\mathbf{C}-\mathbf{D}-\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;

By inspection of the figure it can be seen that the areas are given by

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}=(x_3-x_2)(y_1-y_3)=(x_3y_1+x_2y_3)-(x_3y_3+x_2y_1)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{C}=-\frac{1}{2}(x_3-x_2)(y_2-y_3)=\frac{1}{2}(-x_3y_2-x_2y_3)+\frac{1}{2}(x_3y_3+x_2y_2)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{D}=-\frac{1}{2}(x_3-x_1)(y_1-y_3)=\frac{1}{2}(-x_3y_1-x_1y_3)+\frac{1}{2}(x_3y_3+x_1y_1)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{E}=-\frac{1}{2}(x_1-x_2)(y_1-y_2)=\frac{1}{2}(-x_1y_1-x_2y_2)+\frac{1}{2}(x_1y_2+x_2y_1)&lt;/math&gt;

Collecting terms and rearranging yields

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}=\frac{1}{2}((x_2y_3-x_3y_2)-(x_1y_3-x_3y_1)+(x_1y_2-x_2y_1))&lt;/math&gt;

which can be written as a determinant

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}=\frac{1}{2}\begin{vmatrix}1&amp;1&amp;1\\x_1&amp;x_2&amp;x_3\\y_1&amp;y_2&amp;y_3\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If the coordinates are written in a clockwise order, the value of the determinant will be &lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{A}.&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging another way

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}=\frac{1}{2}|x_1y_2+x_2y_3+x_3y_1-x_2y_1-x_3y_2-x_1y_3|&lt;/math&gt;

which is the form of the shoelace formula. This formula can be extended to find the area of any polygon since a simple polygon can be divided into triangles.

[[File:Quadrilateral area JCB.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Given the coordinates of a quadrilateral, find its area &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}_\text{quad.}&lt;/math&gt;.]]

===Proof for a quadrilateral and general polygon===

Finding the area of a quadrilateral demonstrates how the shoelace formula is generalized to any polygon by dividing the polygon into triangles. Consider the figure of a quadrilateral whose coordinates are labeled in counterclockwise order. The quadrilateral is divided into two triangles with areas &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}.&lt;/math&gt; Using the triangle formula on each triangle we get

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}=\frac{1}{2}(x_1y_2+x_2y_3+x_3y_1-x_2y_1-x_3y_2-x_1y_3)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}=\frac{1}{2}(x_1y_3+x_3y_4+x_4y_1-x_3y_1-x_4y_3-x_1y_4)&lt;/math&gt;

Since both triangles were traced in a counterclockwise direction, both areas are positive and we get the area of the quadrilateral by adding the two areas. The last positive term and the last negative term of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; cancel with the first positive term and the first negative term of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; giving

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}_\text{quad.}=\frac{1}{2}(x_1y_2+x_2y_3+x_3y_4+x_4y_1-x_2y_1-x_3y_2-x_4y_3-x_1y_4)&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==

The user must know the points of the polygon in a Cartesian plane. For example, take a [[triangle]] with coordinates {(2,&amp;nbsp;1),&amp;nbsp;(4,&amp;nbsp;5),&amp;nbsp;(7,&amp;nbsp;8)}. Take the first ''x''-coordinate and multiply it by the second ''y''-value, then take the second ''x''-coordinate and multiply it by the third ''y''-value, and repeat as many times until it is done for all wanted points. This can be defined by this formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geometry for Enjoyment and Challenge|year=1991|publisher=McDougal Littell|isbn=0-86609-965-4|author=Richard Rhoad|edition=new|author2=George Milauskas |author3=Robert Whipple |pages=717â718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}_\text{tri.} = {1 \over 2}|x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_1 - x_2y_1 - x_3y_2 - x_1y_3| &lt;/math&gt;

for ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; representing each respective coordinate. This formula is just the expansion of those given above for the case n = 3. Using it, one can find that the area of the triangle equals one half of the [[absolute value]] of 10&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;32&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;35&amp;nbsp;â&amp;nbsp;16, which equals 3. The number of  variables depends on the number of sides of the [[polygon]]. For example, a [[pentagon]] will be defined up to ''x''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}_\text{pent.} = {1 \over 2}|x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_4 + x_4y_5 + x_5y_1 - x_2y_1 - x_3y_2 - x_4y_3 - x_5y_4 - x_1y_5|&lt;/math&gt;

A [[quadrilateral]] will be defined up to ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}_\text{quad.} = {1 \over 2}|x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 +x_3y_4 + x_4y_1 - x_2y_1 - x_3y_2 - x_4y_3 - x_1y_4| &lt;/math&gt;

==More complex example==
Consider the polygon defined by the points (3,4), (5,11), (12,8), (9,5), and (5,6), and illustrated in the following diagram:

[[File:polygon area formula (English).svg|Figure|Figure of this example]]

The area of this polygon is:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathbf{A} &amp; = {1 \over 2}|3 \times 11 + 5 \times 8 + 12 \times 5 + 9 \times 6 + 5 \times 4 \\
&amp; {} \qquad {} - 4 \times 5 - 11 \times 12 - 8 \times 9 - 5 \times 5 - 6 \times 3| \\[10pt]
&amp; = {60 \over 2} = 30
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Etymology==

[[File:Shoelace3.png|thumb]]

The reason this formula is called the shoelace formula is because of a common method used to evaluate it. This method uses [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. As an example, choose the triangle with vertices (2,4), (3,â8), and (1,2). Then construct the following matrix by âwalking aroundâ the triangle and ending with the initial point.&lt;ref&gt;IMSA JHMC Guide, Page. 10 "Shoelace" by Cindy Xi&lt;/ref&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp; 4 \\ 3 &amp; -8 \\ 1 &amp; 2 \\ 2 &amp; 4 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

First, draw diagonal down and to the right slashes (as shown below),
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[File:ShoelaceMatrix2.GIF]]
and multiply the two numbers connected by each slash, then add all the products: (2&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;â8)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(3&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;2)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;4) = â6. Do the same thing with slashes diagonal down and to the left (shown below with downwards slashes):
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[File:ShoelaceMatrix3.GIF]]
(4&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;3)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(â8&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(2&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;2) = 8. Then take the difference of these two numbers: |(â6&amp;nbsp;)â(&amp;nbsp;8)| = 14. Halving this gives the area of the triangle: 7. Organizing the numbers like this makes the formula easier to recall and evaluate. With all the slashes drawn, the matrix loosely resembles a shoe with the laces done up, giving rise to the algorithm's name.

'''Utterslev Mose''' (English: Utterslev Boglands) is a large semi-natural area of lakes, [[reed bed]]s and parkland located on the border between [[Copenhagen Municipality|Copenhagen]]  and [[Gladsaxe Municipality |Gladsaxe municipalities]], approximately six kilometers northwest of central [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. It is surrounded by the neighbourhoods [[BrÃ¸nshÃ¸j]], [[Tingbjerg]], [[Utterslev]], [[SÃ¸borg (Gladsaxe Municipality)|SÃ¸borg]] and [[Emdrup]]. It is known for its rich bird life and has a dense network of walking and cycling trails.

==History==
Utterslev Mose was originally one big, shallow-watered lake which formed at the end of the last [[Ice Age]] and later developed into bogland. It was used in Copenhagen's water supply from the 16th century until 1849. It has also been used for [[peat|peat harvesting]].&lt;ref name=Naturfredningsforening&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.dk/Default.aspx?ID=30803|title=Utterslev Mose|language=Danish|publisher=Danmarks Naturfredningsforening|accessdate=2013-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utterslev Mose was formally part of the West Wall a defensive line around [[Copenhagen]] that was part of the [[fortifications of Copenhagen]]. The west wall was closed in 1920 and turned into a recreational area.

Utterslev Mose was converted into a nature park between 1939 and 1943. Lakes were dug out, canals established and a number of reed islands created to provide nesting grounds for wild birds. The park was protected in 2000.

==Description==
Utterslev Mose has an area of 200 hectares (221 ha if Kirkemosen to the south and Gungemosen to the north are included) of which 97 hectares are covered by water. A circuit of the three lakes Vestmosen, Midtmosen and Ãstmosen as well as HÃ¸jmosen in the northeastern corner is about nine kilometres long.&lt;ref name=Naturfredningsforening/&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
Utterslev Mose has a large population of wild birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/da/brugbyen/brug-steder-i-byen/groenne-omraader/parker/broenshoej-husum/utterslev-mose|title=Utterslev Mose|publisher=KÃ¸benhavns Kommune|accessdate=26 December 2013 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wildlife Alliance''' is an international [[non-profit]] wildlife and forest [[Conservation movement|conservation]] organization with current programs and partnerships in [[Cambodia]]. It is headquartered in [[New York City]], with offices in [[Phnom Penh]].
The logo of the organization is the [[Asian elephant]], an emblematic species of [[Southeast Asia]] and the namesake for the organization's programs in the Southwest Elephant Corridor of the [[Cardamom Mountains]] of Cambodia.

==Programs==
Wildlife Alliance's major ongoing programs are:
* '''Care for Rescued Wildlife''' - Since 2001, Wildlife Alliance's Care for Rescued Wildlife program have ensured that all rescued wildlife unfit for immediate release are given expert treatment, natural enclosures, a healthy diet, and trained veterinary care for as long as necessary. Working at [[Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Centre]], the staff has built large natural enclosures and designed excellent care protocols for the over 1,200 animals in their care. Wildlife Alliance has also created a Wildlife Rehabilitation Station in Koh Kong Province where animals that are deemed suitable for release into the wild are relocated to a forested enclosure in an appropriate area of habitat. Utilizing a soft release method, when the animals are ready for release the door to the enclosure is left open and the animals are free to leave at will.  They continue to provide hands-off assistance and supplementary food at the enclosure location for as long as it is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wildlifealliance.org/wildlife-care/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Wildlife Rapid Rescue Team (WRRT)''' - A law enforcement squad devoted solely to combating illegal [[wildlife trade]] composed of Cambodian Forestry Administration officials and Military Police with technical and financial support from Wildlife Alliance. The team has a national mandate to suppress the illegal wildlife trade on roads, in markets and restaurants, and along the border. As of 20183, the Wildlife Rapid Rescue Team has rescued more than 71,000 live animals and confiscated large quantities of animal parts and other contraband.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wildlifealliance.org/wildlife-police/&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Southern Cardamom Forest Protection Program''' - The rangers that patrol the 720,000 hectares work in partnership with both the Wildlife Alliance and the [[Royal Government of Cambodia]] making the southern region of the [[Cardamom Mountains]] the best protected rainforest in Southeast Asia.  Each of the 7 ranger stations holds twelve forest rangers and two Wildlife Alliance advisors comprising two patrol units. These rangers conduct daily patrols removing snares, confiscate illegal timber and dismantle poacher's camps.  During the 18 months prior to the implementation of the ranger program, 37 elephants and 12 tigers were killed, however, there have been no elephant poachings in Cambodia since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wildlifealliance.org/cardamom-protection/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Tropical Reforestation Project''' - Located in Chi Phat, the Tropical [[Reforestation]] Project is a commune that employs local community members to collect seeds from more than 90 indigenous tropical tree species, grow the saplings in the nursery, and then replant trees in deforested areas to reconnect gaps in the elephant corridor. The Reforestation Project combats the impact of [[slash-and-burn]] farming and [[illegal logging]] while providing sustainable livelihoods to the very people who were previously engaging in those activities.
* '''Zoning and Demarcation''' - Wildlife Alliance facilitates clear delineation of strictly protected forest zones versus community land where farmers can develop agriculture. The combination of a participatory planning process and the installation of visible posts on the ground has greatly helped in reducing [[land grabbing]] and [[deforestation]].
* '''Community Agriculture Development Project''' - The Community Agriculture Development Project in Sovanna Baitong focuses on improving the livelihoods of 187 families who were previously destroying the rainforest through slash-and-burn cultivation and hunting wildlife.  With the technical assistance of Wildlife Alliance, villagers have created and manage a Community Agriculture Association that oversees agriculture production, marketing of goods, health care, education, natural resource conservation, a savings program, a micro-credit system.  More than 85% of the families now earn well above the initial goal of $40 per month.
* '''Community Based Ecotourism''' - The Community-Based Ecotourism project in Chi Phat focus on assisting the communities to develop micro-enterprises, infrastructure, and tourism attractions. The sites feature a variety of activities that help visitors explore the Southern Cardamoms and provide an alternative livelihood to former slash-and-burn farmers and illegal poachers. Since its inception it has been mentioned in numerous travel articles and the increased revenue and attention has led to the development of a community waste management system, one of the first of its kind in Cambodia &lt;ref&gt;https://www.wildlifealliance.org/eco-tourism-chi-phat/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Kouprey Express''' - Named for the [[Kouprey]] (Bos sauveli), a species of ox believed to be extinct in the wild, the Kouprey Express is a bus full of engaging and interactive educational materials that travels throughout the Southern Cardamoms visiting schools and rural villages teaching environmental protection and management.  Beginning in 2008, the Kouprey Express adopted a targeted strategy to maximize impact by distributing reusable environmental education curricula and materials, and by training teachers in Koh Kong province how to use these curricula. Currently, the Kouprey Express team targets up to 20 primary schools per year conducting lessons in habitat and wildlife protection, pollution prevention, sustainable livelihoods, and energy use and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wildlifealliance.org/education/&lt;/ref&gt;
