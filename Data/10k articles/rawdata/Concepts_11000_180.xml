'''''Amour de soi''''' (French, "self-love") is a concept in the philosophy of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] that refers to the kind of [[self-love]] that humans share with brute animals and predates the appearance of society. Acts committed out of ''amour de soi'' tend to be for individual well-being. They are naturally good and not malicious because ''amour de soi'' as self-love does not involve pursuing one's self-interest at the expense of others. The sentiment does not compare oneself with others, but is concerned solely with regarding oneself as an absolute and valuable existence. It is related to an awareness of one's future and can restrain present impulse. Rousseau contrasts it with ''[[amour-propre]]'', that kind of self-love, found in [[Thomas Hobbes]]' philosophy, in which one's opinion of oneself is dependent on what other people think and which arises only with society.

Rousseau suggested that ''amour de soi'' was lost during the transition from the pre-societal condition to society, but it can be restored by the use of "good" institutions created with the [[social contract]]. This renewed passage from the [[state of nature]] to the civilized state, would bring man to favor [[justice]] instead of [[instinct]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Derathé, ''Jean-Jacques Rousseau et la science politique de son temps'', Paris, Librairie Philosophique J. Vrin, 1995, pp. 135-141.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anchoring''' or '''focalism''' is a [[cognitive bias]] for an individual to rely too heavily on an initial piece of information offered (known as the "anchor") when making decisions.

The original description of the anchoring effect came from [[psychophysics]] where it was noticed when judging stimuli along a continuum that the first and last stimuli were used to compare the other stimuli. This is often referred to as end anchoring. This was applied to attitudes by [[Muzafer Sherif|Sherif]] et al. in 1958 in their article "Assimilation and contrast effects of anchoring stimuli on judgments".

During [[decision making]], anchoring occurs when individuals use this initial piece of information to make subsequent judgments. Those objects near the anchor tend to be assimilated toward it and those further away tend to be displaced in the other direction. Once the value of this anchor is set, all future negotiations, arguments, estimates, etc. are discussed in relation to the anchor. This bias occurs when interpreting future information using this anchor. For example, the initial price offered for a used car, set either before or at the start of negotiations, sets an arbitrary focal point for all following discussions. Prices discussed in negotiations that are lower than the anchor may seem reasonable, perhaps even cheap to the buyer, even if said prices are still relatively higher than the actual market value of the car.&lt;ref name="Investopedia"&gt;{{Citation | title = Anchoring Definition | publisher = Investopedia | url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/anchoring.asp | accessdate = September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focusing effect==
The '''focusing effect''' (or '''focusing illusion''') is a [[List of cognitive biases|cognitive bias]] that occurs when people place too much importance on one aspect of an event, causing an error in accurately predicting the [[utility]] of a future outcome.&lt;ref name="Vass"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zoltán Vass|title=A Psychological Interpretation of Drawings and Paintings. The SSCA Method: A Systems Analysis Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gHmojkRIbcQC&amp;pg=PA83|accessdate=27 August 2013|publisher=Alexandra Publishing|isbn=978-963-297-474-3|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People focus on notable differences, excluding those that are less conspicuous, when making predictions about happiness or convenience. For example, when people were asked how much happier they believe Californians are compared to Midwesterners, Californians and Midwesterners both said Californians must be considerably happier, when, in fact, there was no difference between the actual happiness rating of Californians and Midwesterners. The bias lies in that most people focused on and overweighed the sunny weather and ostensibly easy-going lifestyle of [[California]] and devalued and underrated other aspects of life and determinants of happiness, such as low crime rates and safety from natural disasters like earthquakes (both of which large parts of California lack).&lt;ref name="SchkadeKahneman1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schkade|first1=D. Alan|last2=Kahneman|first2=Daniel|title=Does Living in California Make People Happy? A Focusing Illusion in Judgments of Life Satisfaction|journal=Psychological Science|volume=9|issue=5|year=1998|pages=340–346|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rise in income has only a small and transient effect on happiness and well-being, but people consistently overestimate this effect. Academics Daniel Kahneman, along with A. Krueger, D. Schkade, N. Schwarz &amp; A. Stone proposed that this is a result of a focusing illusion, with people focusing on conventional measures of achievement rather than on everyday routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |volume=312 |issue=5782 |pages=1908–10 |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |author2=Alan B. Krueger |author3=David Schkade |author4=Norbert Schwarz |author5=Arthur A. Stone  |title=Would you be happier if you were richer?

==Adjustment heuristic==
'''Anchoring and adjustment''' is a [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|psychological heuristic]] that influences the way people intuitively assess probabilities. According to this heuristic, people start with an implicitly suggested reference point (the "anchor") and make adjustments to it to reach their estimate. A person begins with a first approximation (anchor) and then makes incremental adjustments based on additional information. These adjustments are usually insufficient, giving the initial anchor a great deal of influence over future assessments.

[[File:Daniel KAHNEMAN.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Daniel Kahneman]], one of the first researchers to study anchoring.]]
The anchoring and adjustment heuristic was first theorized by [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]]. In one of their first studies, participants were asked to compute, within 5 seconds, the product of the numbers one through eight, either as &lt;math&gt;1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 \times 6 \times 7 \times 8&lt;/math&gt; or reversed as &lt;math&gt;8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1&lt;/math&gt;. Because participants did not have enough time to calculate the full answer, they had to make an estimate after their first few multiplications. When these first multiplications gave a small answer – because the sequence started with small numbers – the median estimate was 512; when the sequence started with the larger numbers, the median estimate was 2,250. (The correct answer is 40,320.) In another study by Tversky and Kahneman, participants observed a roulette wheel that was predetermined to stop on either 10 or 65. Participants were then asked to guess the percentage of the United Nations that were African nations. Participants whose wheel stopped on 10 guessed lower values (25% on average) than participants whose wheel stopped at 65 (45% on average).&lt;ref name="TverskyKahneman1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tversky|first1=A.|last2=Kahneman|first2=D.|title=Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases|journal=Science|volume=185|issue=4157|year=1974|pages=1124–1131|doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124|url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~camerer/Ec101/JudgementUncertainty.pdf|pmid=17835457}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern has held in other experiments for a wide variety of different subjects of estimation.

As a second example, in a study by [[Dan Ariely]], an audience is first asked to write the last two digits of their social security number and consider whether they would pay this number of dollars for items whose value they did not know, such as wine, chocolate and computer equipment. They were then asked to bid for these items, with the result that the audience members with higher two-digit numbers would submit bids that were between 60 percent and 120 percent higher than those with the lower social security numbers, which had become their anchor.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Teach, "[http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3014027 Avoiding Decision Traps]", [[CFO (magazine)|''CFO'']] (1 June 2004). Retrieved 29 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difficulty of avoiding===
Various studies have shown that anchoring is very difficult to avoid. For example, in one study students were given anchors that were obviously wrong. They were asked whether [[Mahatma Gandhi]] died before or after age 9, or before or after age 140. Clearly neither of these anchors can be correct, but when the two groups were asked to suggest when they thought he had died, they guessed significantly differently (average age of 50 vs. average age of 67).&lt;ref name="StrackMussweiler1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strack|first1=Fritz|last2=Mussweiler|first2=Thomas|title=Explaining the enigmatic anchoring effect: Mechanisms of selective accessibility.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=73|issue=3|year=1997|pages=437–446|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.3.437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have tried to eliminate anchoring much more directly. In a study exploring the causes and properties of anchoring, participants were exposed to an anchor and asked to guess how many physicians were listed in the local phone book. In addition, they were explicitly informed that anchoring would "contaminate" their responses, and that they should do their best to correct for that. A control group received no anchor and no explanation. Regardless of how they were informed and whether they were informed correctly, all of the experimental groups reported higher estimates than the control group. Thus, despite being expressly aware of the anchoring effect, participants were still unable to avoid it.&lt;ref name="WilsonHouston1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Timothy D.|last2=Houston|first2=Christopher E.|last3=Etling|first3=Kathryn M.|last4=Brekke|first4=Nancy|title=A new look at anchoring effects: Basic anchoring and its antecedents.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=125|issue=4|year=1996|pages=387–402|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.125.4.387}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later study found that even when offered monetary incentives, people are unable to effectively adjust from an anchor.&lt;ref name="SimmonsLeBoeuf2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simmons|first1=Joseph P.|last2=LeBoeuf|first2=Robyn A.|last3=Nelson|first3=Leif D.|title=The effect of accuracy motivation on anchoring and adjustment: Do people adjust from provided anchors?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=99|issue=6|year=2010|pages=917–932|doi=10.1037/a0021540|pmid=21114351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Several theories have been put forth to explain what causes anchoring, although some explanations are more popular than others, there is no consensus as to which is best.&lt;ref name="FurnhamBoo2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Furnham|first1=Adrian|last2=Boo|first2=Hua Chu|title=A literature review of the anchoring effect|journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics|volume=40|issue=1|year=2011|pages=35–42|doi=10.1016/j.socec.2010.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study on possible causes of anchoring, two authors described anchoring as easy to demonstrate, but hard to explain.&lt;ref name="StrackMussweiler1997" /&gt; At least one group of researchers has argued that multiple causes are at play, and that what is called "anchoring" is actually several different effects.&lt;ref name="EpleyGilovich2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epley|first1=Nicholas|last2=Gilovich|first2=Thomas|title=When effortful thinking influences judgmental anchoring: differential effects of forewarning and incentives on self-generated and externally provided anchors|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|volume=18|issue=3|year=2005|pages=199–212|doi=10.1002/bdm.495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anchoring-and-adjusting===
In their original study, Tversky and Kahneman put forth a view later termed '''anchoring-as-adjustment'''. According to this theory, once an anchor is set, people adjust away from it to get to their final answer; however, they adjust insufficiently, resulting in their final guess being closer to the anchor than it would be otherwise.&lt;ref name="TverskyKahneman1992"/&gt; Other researchers also found evidence supporting the anchoring-and-adjusting explanation.&lt;ref name="EpleyGilovich2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epley|first1=N.|last2=Gilovich|first2=T.|title=Putting Adjustment Back in the Anchoring and Adjustment Heuristic: Differential Processing of Self-Generated and Experimenter-Provided Anchors|journal=Psychological Science|volume=12|issue=5|year=2001|pages=391–396|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00372|pmid=11554672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, later researchers criticized this model, because it is only applicable when the initial anchor is outside the range of acceptable answers. To use an earlier example, since Mahatma Gandhi obviously did not die at age 9, then people will adjust from there. If a reasonable number were given, though, there would be no adjustment. Therefore, this theory cannot, according to its critics, explain the anchoring effect.&lt;ref name="MussweilerStrack1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mussweiler|first1=Thomas|last2=Strack|first2=Fritz|title=Hypothesis-Consistent Testing and Semantic Priming in the Anchoring Paradigm: A Selective Accessibility Model|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=35|issue=2|year=1999|pages=136–164|url=http://soco.uni-koeln.de/files/JESP35.pdf|doi=10.1006/jesp.1998.1364|access-date=2014-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129032727/http://soco.uni-koeln.de/files/JESP35.pdf|archive-date=2014-11-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study found that the anchoring effect holds even when the anchor is subliminal. According to Tversky and Kahneman's theory, this is impossible, since anchoring is only the result of conscious adjustment.&lt;ref name="MussweilerEnglich2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mussweiler|first1=Thomas|last2=Englich|first2=Birte|title=Subliminal anchoring: Judgmental consequences and underlying mechanisms|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=98|issue=2|year=2005|pages=133–143|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2004.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of arguments like these, anchoring-and-adjusting has fallen out of favor.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Selective accessibility===
In the same study that criticized anchoring-and-adjusting, the authors proposed an alternate explanation regarding '''selective accessibility''', which is derived from a theory called "confirmatory hypothesis testing". In short, selective accessibility proposes that when given an anchor, a judge (i.e. a person making some judgment) will evaluate the hypothesis that the anchor thinks is a suitable answer. Assuming it is not, the judge moves on to another guess, but not before accessing all the relevant attributes of the anchor itself. Then, when evaluating the new answer, the judge looks for ways in which it is similar to the anchor, resulting in the anchoring effect.&lt;ref name="MussweilerStrack1999" /&gt; Various studies have found empirical support for this hypothesis.&lt;ref name="ChapmanJohnson1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chapman|first1=Gretchen B.|last2=Johnson|first2=Eric J.|title=Anchoring, Activation, and the Construction of Values|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=79|issue=2|year=1999|pages=115–153|doi=10.1006/obhd.1999.2841}}&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation assumes that the judge considers the anchor to be a plausible value so that it is not immediately rejected, which would preclude considering its relevant attributes.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Attitude change===
More recently, a third explanation of anchoring has been proposed concerning '''attitude change'''. According to this theory, providing an anchor changes someone's attitudes to be more favorable to the particular attributes of that anchor, biasing future answers to have similar characteristics as the anchor. Leading proponents of this theory consider it to be an alternate explanation in line with prior research on anchoring-and-adjusting and selective accessibility.&lt;ref name="WegenerPetty2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wegener|first1=Duane T.|last2=Petty|first2=Richard E.|last3=Detweiler-Bedell|first3=Brian T.|last4=Jarvis|first4=W.Blair G.|title=Implications of Attitude Change Theories for Numerical Anchoring: Anchor Plausibility and the Limits of Anchor Effectiveness|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=37|issue=1|year=2001|pages=62–69|doi=10.1006/jesp.2000.1431}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BlankenshipWegener2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blankenship|first1=Kevin L.|last2=Wegener|first2=Duane T.|last3=Petty|first3=Richard E.|last4=Detweiler-Bedell|first4=Brian|last5=Macy|first5=Cheryl L.|title=Elaboration and consequences of anchored estimates: An attitudinal perspective on numerical anchoring|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=44|issue=6|year=2008|pages=1465–1476|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influencing factors==

===Mood===
A wide range of research has linked sad or depressed moods with more extensive and accurate evaluation of problems.&lt;ref name="BodenhausenGabriel2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bodenhausen|first1=G. V.|last2=Gabriel|first2=S.|last3=Lineberger|first3=M.|title=Sadness and Susceptibility to Judgmental Bias: The Case of Anchoring|journal=Psychological Science|volume=11|issue=4|year=2000|pages=320–323|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00263}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, earlier studies hypothesized that people with more depressed moods would tend to use anchoring less than those with happier moods. However, more recent studies have shown the opposite effect: sad people are ''more'' likely to use anchoring than people with happy or neutral mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Englich | first1 = B. | last2 = Soder | first2 = K. | year = 2009 | title = Moody experts: How mood and expertise influence judgmental anchoring | url = | journal = Judgment and Decision Making | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 41–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experience===
Early research found that experts (those with high knowledge, experience, or expertise in some field) were more resistant to the anchoring effect.&lt;ref name="WilsonHouston1996" /&gt; Since then, however, numerous studies have demonstrated that while experience can sometimes reduce the effect, even experts are susceptible to anchoring. In a study concerning the effects of anchoring on judicial decisions, researchers found that even experienced legal professionals were affected by anchoring. This remained true even when the anchors provided were arbitrary and unrelated to the case in question.&lt;ref name="EnglichMussweiler2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Englich|first1=B.|last3=Strack|first3=Fritz|last2=Mussweiler|first2=Thomas|title=Playing Dice With Criminal Sentences: The Influence of Irrelevant Anchors on Experts' Judicial Decision Making|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=32|issue=2|year=2006|pages=188–200|doi=10.1177/0146167205282152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
Research has correlated susceptibility to anchoring with most of the [[Big Five personality traits]]. People high in agreeableness and conscientiousness are more likely to be affected by anchoring, while those high in extraversion are less likely to be affected.&lt;ref name="ErogluCroxton2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eroglu|first1=Cuneyt|last2=Croxton|first2=Keely L.|title=Biases in judgmental adjustments of statistical forecasts: The role of individual differences|journal=International Journal of Forecasting|volume=26|issue=1|year=2010|pages=116–133|doi=10.1016/j.ijforecast.2009.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that those high in openness to new experiences were more susceptible to the anchoring effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McElroy | first1 = T. | last2 = Dowd | first2 = K. | year = 2007 | title = Susceptibility to anchoring effects: How openness-to-experience influences responses to anchoring cues | url = | journal = Judgment and Decision Making | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 48–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive ability===
The impact of [[cognitive ability]] on anchoring is contested. A recent study on willingness to pay for consumer goods found that anchoring decreased in those with greater cognitive ability, though it did not disappear.&lt;ref name="BergmanEllingsen2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bergman|first1=Oscar|last2=Ellingsen|first2=Tore|last3=Johannesson|first3=Magnus|last4=Svensson|first4=Cicek|title=Anchoring and cognitive ability|journal=Economics Letters|volume=107|issue=1|year=2010|pages=66–68|doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2009.12.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study, however, found that cognitive ability had no significant effect on how likely people were to use anchoring.&lt;ref name="OechsslerRoider2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oechssler|first1=Jörg|last2=Roider|first2=Andreas|last3=Schmitz|first3=Patrick W.|title=Cognitive abilities and behavioral biases|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|volume=72|issue=1|year=2009|pages=147–152|doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2009.04.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In negotiations==
In negotiations, anchoring is setting a boundary that outlines the basic constraints for a negotiation. The anchoring effect is where we set our estimation for the true value of the item at hand.&lt;ref name="TverskyKahneman1974" /&gt; In addition to the initial research conducted by Tversky and Kahneman, multiple other studies have shown that anchoring can greatly influence the estimated value of an object.&lt;ref&gt;Orr, D. &amp; Guthrie, C. (2005). "Anchoring, information, expertise, and negotiation: New insights from meta-analysis". Ohio St. J. Disp. Resol., 597, 21. {{SSRN|900152}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, although negotiators can generally appraise an offer based on multiple characteristics, studies have shown that they tend to focus on only one aspect. In this way, a deliberate starting point can strongly affect the range of possible counteroffers.&lt;ref name="TverskyKahneman1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tversky|first1=Amos|last2=Kahneman|first2=Daniel|title=Advances in prospect theory: Cumulative representation of uncertainty|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|volume=5|issue=4|year=1992|pages=297–323|doi=10.1007/BF00122574}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of offer and counteroffer results in a mutually beneficial arrangement. However, multiple studies have shown that initial offers have a stronger influence on the outcome of negotiations than subsequent counteroffers.&lt;ref name="KristensenGärling1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kristensen|first1=Henrik|last2=Gärling|first2=Tommy|title=The Effects of Anchor Points and Reference Points on Negotiation Process and Outcome|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=71|issue=1|year=1997|pages=85–94|doi=10.1006/obhd.1997.2713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the power of anchoring has been conducted during the Strategic Negotiation Process Workshops. During the workshop, a group of participants is divided into two sections: buyers and sellers. Each side receives identical information about the other party before going into a one-on-one negotiation. Following this exercise, both sides debrief about their experiences. The results show that where the participants anchor the negotiation had a significant effect on their success.&lt;ref name="Dietmeyer2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dietmeyer|first=Brian|title=Strategic Negotiation: A Breakthrough Four-Step Process for Effective Business Negotiation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZ_lnQEACAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Kaplan Publishing|isbn=978-0-7931-8304-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2014}}

Anchoring affects everyone, even people who are highly knowledgeable in a field. Northcraft and Neale conducted a study to measure the difference in the estimated value of a house between students and real-estate agents. In this experiment, both groups were shown a house and then given different listing prices. After making their offer, each group was then asked to discuss what factors influenced their decisions. In the follow-up interviews, the real-estate agents denied being influenced by the initial price, but the results showed that both groups were equally influenced by that anchor.&lt;ref name="NorthcraftNeale1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Northcraft|first1=Gregory B|last2=Neale|first2=Margaret A|title=Experts, amateurs, and real estate: An anchoring-and-adjustment perspective on property pricing decisions|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=39|issue=1|year=1987|pages=84–97 |doi=10.1016/0749-5978(87)90046-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anchoring can have more subtle effects on negotiations as well. Janiszewski and Uy investigated the effects of precision of an anchor. Participants read an initial price for a beach house, then gave the price they thought it was worth. They received either a general, seemingly nonspecific anchor (e.g., $800,000) or a more precise and specific anchor (e.g., $799,800). Participants with a general anchor adjusted their estimate more than those given a precise anchor ($751,867 vs $784,671). The authors propose that this effect comes from difference in scale; in other words, the anchor affects not only the starting ''value'', but also the starting ''scale''. When given a general anchor of $20, people will adjust in large increments ($19, $21, etc.), but when given a more specific anchor like $19.85, people will adjust on a lower scale ($19.75, $19.95, etc.).&lt;ref name="JaniszewskiUy2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janiszewski |first1=Chris| last2=Uy|first2=Dan| title=Precision of the Anchor Influences the Amount of Adjustment|journal=Psychological Science |volume=19|issue=2|year=2008|pages=121–127| doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02057.x| pmid=18271859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a more specific initial price will tend to result in a final price closer to the initial one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1033">The '''axiom of equity''' was proposed by [[Samuel Clarke]], an English [[philosopher]], in the spirit of the [[ethic of reciprocity]].

In his book ''A Discourse Concerning the Unchangeable Obligations of Natural Religion, and the Truth and Certainty of the Christian Revelation'', Clarke wrote: 
{{quote|Whatever I judge reasonable or unreasonable for another to do to me; that, by the same judgment, I declare reasonable or unreasonable, that I in the like case should do for him.}}

[[Hastings Rashdall]], in his 1907 book ''[[The Theory of Good and Evil]]'', restated the axiom as: 
{{quote|One man's good is of as much intrinsic worth as the like good of another.}}

[[Image:Страшный суд.jpg|thumb|The [[Last Judgement]] by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]].]]
The [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] of [[white]] and [[black]] ([[light]] and [[darkness]], [[day]] and [[night]]) has a long tradition of [[metaphor]]ical usage, traceable to the [[Ancient Near East]], and explicitly in the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] ''[[Table of Opposites]]''.
In [[Western culture]] as well as in [[Confucianism]], the contrast symbolizes the moral dichotomy of [[good and evil]].

== Description ==

Day, Light, and Good are often linked together, in opposition to night, darkness, and evil. These contrasting metaphors may go back as far as human history, and appear in many cultures, including both the ancient Chinese and the ancient Persians. The philosophy of [[neoplatonism]] is strongly imbued with the metaphor of goodness as light.&lt;ref name=arnheim&gt;[[Rudolf Arnheim]]. (1974). Art and visual perception. Univ of California Press. "The Symbolism of Light" (pp. 324-5)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Religion and mythology ===

* The [[Genesis creation narrative]] has God "separate light from darkness" on the First Day.

*The Bible associates light with God, truth, and virtue; darkness is associated with sin and the Devil. Painters such as [[Rembrandt]] portrayed divine light illuminating an otherwise dark world.&lt;ref name="arnheim" /&gt;
*''[[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]]'', part of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].
*The [[underworld]] ([[Hades]], [[Tartarus]]) was imagined as a [[chthonic]] place of darkness, contrasting with the [[Heaven|celestial]] realm of the [[gods]]. Christian notions of [[heaven]] and [[hell]] inherit this conception, as do the "[[fallen angel|dark angel]]s" vs. the unfallen [[angels]], often with [[aureola]] ([[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]]), in [[Christian mythology]].
*Day and night are personified as deities in various [[mythology|mythologies]] (i.e. [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[Dagr]] and [[Nótt]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Hemera]] and [[Nyx]], et cetera).

=== Dress ===

* White often represents purity or innocence in Western culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The [[Encyclopedia Americana]]: A Library of Universal Knowledge|publisher=Encyclopedia Americana Corp.|year=1918|page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly as white clothing or objects can be stained easily.  In most Western countries white is the color worn by brides at weddings.  [[Angels]] are typically depicted as clothed in white robes.
**In many [[Western (genre)|Hollywood Westerns]], bad cowboys wear [[black and white hat symbolism in film|black hats]] while the good ones wear white. 
**[[Melodrama]] villains are dressed in black and heroines in white dresses. 
**This can be reversed as a deliberate play on conventions, by having the evil character dress in white, as a symbol of their hypocrisy or arrogance.  For example, Don Fanucci in ''[[The Godfather, Part II]]'' is an evil character, but wears an expensive all-white suit as a sign of his esteem, power and prestige. Sometimes protagonists can wear black too, as in ''[[Return of the Jedi]],'' wherein [[Luke Skywalker]] wears black during the final battle.
**In [[computer security]], a [[Black hat hacking|black hat]] is an attacker with evil intentions, while a [[white hat (computer security)|white hat]] bears no such ill will.  (This is derived from the Western movie convention.)

=== Magic ===
* Healing or "good" paranormal magic is called [[magic (paranormal)|White magic]]. [[Black magic]] is a destructive or evil form of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].
** ''[[A Treatise on White Magic]]'' is a book by [[Alice Bailey]], a [[Neo-Theosophy|Theosophist]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''A Treatise on White Magic'' New York: 1934 Lucis Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[White witch]].
** Evil [[witches]] are stereotypically dressed in black and good [[fairies]] in white.

=== Popular Culture ===
* The [[Inventio#Topoi|topos]] of "light and darkness" is also reflected in numerous titles in popular culture, such as ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899), ''[[Light in My Darkness]]'' (1927), ''[[Darkness and the Light]]'' (1942), ''[[Creatures of Light and Darkness]]'' (1969), ''[[From Darkness to Light]]'' (1973), ''[[Darkness and Light (novel)|Darkness and Light]]'' (1989), ''[[The Lord of the Light and of the Darkness]]'' (1993), the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space 9]]'' episode "[[The Darkness and the Light (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|The Darkness and the Light]]" (1997), the ''[[Babylon 5]]'' episode "[[Between the Darkness and the Light]]" (1997), and ''[[Out of the Darkness, Into the Light]]'' (1998).
* In works of [[fantasy]] fiction, the main antagonist is often called a "[[Dark Lord (fiction)|Dark Lord]]", for example Sauron in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.
* [[George Orwell]] makes a bitterly ironic use of the "light and darkness" topos in his ''[[Nineteen Eighty Four]]''. In the early part of the book the protagonist gets a promise that "We will meet in the place where there is no darkness" – which he interprets as referring to a place where the oppressive totalitarian state does not rule. But the man who made the promise was in fact an agent of the [[Thought Police]] – and they eventually meet as prisoner and interrogator where there is indeed no darkness, in detention cells where the light remains on permanently, day and night, as an additional means of torturing detainees.

=== Other Examples ===
* The [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] vs. the [[Age of Enlightenment]].
* "[[False dilemma#Black-and-white thinking|Black and white thinking]]" is the [[false dichotomy]] of assuming anything not good is evil and vice versa.

'''Bloom's taxonomy''' is a set of three hierarchical models used to classify educational learning objectives into levels of complexity and specificity. The three lists cover the learning objectives in cognitive, affective and sensory domains. The cognitive domain list has been the primary focus of most traditional education and is frequently used to structure curriculum learning objectives, assessments and activities.

The models were named after [[Benjamin Bloom]], who chaired the committee of educators that devised the taxonomy. He also edited the first volume of the standard text, ''Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals''.&lt;ref name="bloom1956"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bloom |first1=B.

==History==
Although named after Bloom, the publication of ''Taxonomy of Educational Objectives'' followed a series of conferences from 1949 to 1953, which were designed to improve communication between educators on the design of curricula and examinations.{{sfn|Bloom et al.|1956|p=4|ps=: "The idea for this classification system was formed at an informal meeting of college examiners attending the 1948 American Psychological Association Convention in Boston. At this meeting, interest was expressed in a theoretical framework which could be used to facilitate communication among examiners.}}

The first volume of the taxonomy, ''Handbook I: Cognitive''&lt;ref name="bloom1956" /&gt; was published in 1956, and in 1964 the second volume ''Handbook II: Affective'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simpson |first=Elizabeth J. |title=The classification of educational objectives: Psychomotor domain |year=1966 |journal=Illinois Journal of Home Economics |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=110–144 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last=Harrow |first=Anita J. |year=1972 |title=A taxonomy of the psychomotor domain: A guide for developing behavioral objectives |place=New York |publisher=David McKay Company |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last=Dave |first=R.

== The cognitive domain (knowledge-based)==
In the original version of the taxonomy, the cognitive domain is broken into the following six levels of objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hoy |first=Anita Woolfolk |date=2007 |title=Educational psychology |edition=10th |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson/Allyn and Bacon |pages=530–531, 545 |isbn=0205459463 |oclc=68694368}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2001 revised edition of Bloom's taxonomy, the levels are slightly different: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create (rather than Synthesize).&lt;ref name="anderaetal2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Armstrong|first1=Patricia|title=Bloom's Taxonomy|url=https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/|website=Vanderbilt University Center for Teaching|publisher=[[Vanderbilt University]]|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge===
Knowledge involves recognizing or remembering facts, terms, basic concepts, or answers without necessarily understanding what they mean. Its characteristics may include:
*Knowledge of specifics—terminology, specific facts
*Knowledge of ways and means of dealing with specifics—conventions, trends and sequences, classifications and categories, criteria, methodology
*Knowledge of the universals and abstractions in a field—principles and generalizations, theories and structures

''Example'': Name three common varieties of apple.

===Comprehension===
Comprehension involves demonstrating understanding of facts and ideas by organizing, comparing, translating, interpreting, giving descriptions, and stating the main ideas.

''Example'': Compare the identifying characteristics of a Golden Delicious apple with a Granny Smith apple.

===Application===
Application involves using acquired knowledge—solving problems in new situations by applying acquired knowledge, facts, techniques and rules. Learners should be able to use prior knowledge to solve problems, identify connections and relationships and how they apply in new situations.

''Example'': Would apples prevent scurvy, a disease caused by a deficiency in vitamin C?

===Analysis===
Analysis involves examining and breaking information into component parts, determining how the parts relate to one another, identifying motives or causes, making inferences, and finding evidence to support generalizations. Its characteristics include:
*Analysis of elements
*Analysis of relationships
*Analysis of organization

''Example'': List four ways of serving foods made with apples and explain which ones have the highest health benefits. Provide references to support your statements.

===Synthesis===
Synthesis involves building a structure or pattern from diverse elements; it also refers to the act of putting parts together to form a whole. Its characteristics include:
*Production of a unique communication
*Production of a plan, or proposed set of operations
*Derivation of a set of abstract relations

''Example'': Convert an "unhealthy" recipe for apple pie to a "healthy" recipe by replacing your choice of ingredients. Explain the health benefits of using the ingredients you chose vs. the original ones.

===Evaluation===
Evaluation involves presenting and defending opinions by making judgments about information, the validity of ideas, or quality of work based on a set of criteria. Its characteristics include:
*Judgments in terms of internal evidence
*Judgments in terms of external criteria

''Example'': Which kinds of apples are best for baking a pie, and why?

==The affective domain (emotion-based)&lt;!--linked from 'Aesthetics'--&gt;==
Skills in the affective domain describe the way people react [[emotion]]ally and their ability to feel other living things' pain or joy. Affective objectives typically target the awareness and growth in [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s, emotion, and feelings.

There are five levels in the affective domain moving through the lowest-order processes to the highest.

===Receiving===
The lowest level; the student passively pays attention. Without this level, no learning can occur. Receiving is about the student's memory and recognition as well.

===Responding===
The student actively participates in the learning process, not only attends to a stimulus; the student also reacts in some way.

===Valuing===
The student attaches a value to an object, phenomenon, or piece of information. The student associates a value or some values to the knowledge they acquired.

===Organizing===
The student can put together different values, information, and ideas, and can accommodate them within his/her own schema; the student is comparing, relating and elaborating on what has been learned.

===Characterizing===
The student at this level tries to build abstract knowledge.

== The psychomotor domain (action-based) ==
Skills in the psychomotor domain describe the ability to physically manipulate a tool or instrument like a hand or a hammer. Psychomotor objectives usually focus on change and/or development in behavior and/or skills.

Bloom and his colleagues never created subcategories for skills in the psychomotor domain, but since then other educators have created their own psychomotor taxonomies.&lt;ref name="clark1999" /&gt; Simpson (1972)&lt;ref name= "simpson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simpson|first1=Elizabeth|title=Educational objectives in the psychomotor domain|date=1972|volume=3|pages=25–30|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED010368.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=Gryphon House|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the following levels:

===Perception===
The ability to use sensory cues to guide motor activity:  This ranges from sensory stimulation, through cue selection, to translation.

''Examples'': Detects non-verbal communication cues. Estimate where a ball will land after it is thrown and then moving to the correct location to catch the ball. Adjusts heat of the stove to correct temperature by smell and taste of food. Adjusts the height of the forks on a forklift by comparing where the forks are in relation to the pallet.

''Key words'': chooses, describes, detects, differentiates, distinguishes, identifies, isolates, relates, selects.

===Set===
Readiness to act: It includes mental, physical, and emotional sets. These three sets are dispositions that predetermine a person's response to different situations (sometimes called mindsets). This subdivision of psychomotor is closely related with the "responding to phenomena" subdivision of the affective domain.

''Examples'': Knows and acts upon a sequence of steps in a manufacturing process. Recognizes his or her abilities and limitations. Shows desire to learn a new process (motivation).

''Keywords'': begins, displays, explains, moves, proceeds, reacts, shows, states, volunteers.

===Guided response===
The early stages of learning a complex skill that includes imitation and trial and error: Adequacy of performance is achieved by practicing.

''Examples'': Performs a mathematical equation as demonstrated. Follows instructions to build a model. Responds to hand-signals of the instructor while learning to operate a forklift.

''Keywords'': copies, traces, follows, react, reproduce, responds.

===Mechanism===
The intermediate stage in learning a complex skill: Learned responses have become habitual and the movements can be performed with some confidence and proficiency.

''Examples'': Use a personal computer. Repair a leaking tap. Drive a car.

''Key words'': assembles, calibrates, constructs, dismantles, displays, fastens, fixes, grinds, heats, manipulates, measures, mends, mixes, organizes, sketches.

===Complex overt response===
The skillful performance of motor acts that involve complex movement patterns: Proficiency is indicated by a quick, accurate, and highly coordinated performance, requiring a minimum of energy. This category includes performing without hesitation and automatic performance. For example, players will often utter sounds of satisfaction or expletives as soon as they hit a tennis ball or throw a football because they can tell by the feel of the act what the result will produce.

''Examples'': Maneuvers a car into a tight parallel parking spot. Operates a computer quickly and accurately. Displays competence while playing the piano.

''Key words'': assembles, builds, calibrates, constructs, dismantles, displays, fastens, fixes, grinds, heats, manipulates, measures, mends, mixes, organizes, sketches. (Note: The key words are the same as in mechanism, but will have adverbs or adjectives that indicate that the performance is quicker, better, more accurate, etc.)

===Adaptation===
Skills are well developed and the individual can modify movement patterns to fit special requirements.

''Examples'': Responds effectively to unexpected experiences. Modifies instruction to meet the needs of the learners. Performs a task with a machine that was not originally intended for that purpose (the machine is not damaged and there is no danger in performing the new task).

''Key words'': adapts, alters, changes, rearranges, reorganizes, revises, varies.

===Origination===
Creating new movement patterns to fit a particular situation or specific problem: Learning outcomes emphasize creativity based upon highly developed skills.

''Examples'': Constructs a new set or pattern of movements organized around a novel concept or theory. Develops a new and comprehensive training program. Creates a new gymnastic routine.

''Key words'': arranges, builds, combines, composes, constructs, creates, designs, initiate, makes, originates.

==Definition of knowledge==
In the appendix to ''Handbook I'', there is a definition of knowledge which serves as the apex for an alternative, summary classification of the educational goals. This is significant as the taxonomy has been called upon significantly in other fields such as knowledge management, potentially out of context. "Knowledge, as defined here, involves the recall of specifics and universals, the recall of methods and processes, or the recall of a pattern, structure, or setting."{{sfn|Bloom et al.|1956|p=201}}

The taxonomy is set out as follows:
*1.00 Knowledge
**1.10 Knowledge of specifics
**1.11 Knowledge of terminology
**1.12 Knowledge of specific facts
**1.20 Knowledge of ways and means of dealing with specifics
**1.21 Knowledge of conventions
**1.22 Knowledge of trends and sequences
**1.23 Knowledge of classifications and categories
**1.24 Knowledge of criteria
**1.25 Knowledge of methodology
**1.30 Knowledge of the universals and abstractions in a field
**1.31 Knowledge of principles and generalizations
**1.32 Knowledge of theories and structures

==Criticism of the taxonomy==
As {{harvtxt|Morshead|1965}} pointed out on the publication of the second volume, the classification was not a properly constructed taxonomy, as it lacked a systemic rationale of construction.

This was subsequently acknowledged in the discussion of the original taxonomy in its 2001 revision,&lt;ref name="anderaetal2001" /&gt; and the taxonomy was reestablished on more systematic lines. 

Some critiques of the taxonomy's cognitive domain admit the existence of these six categories but question the existence of a sequential, hierarchical link.&lt;ref name="paul1993"&gt;{{cite book |last=Paul |first=R. |year=1993 |title=Critical thinking: what every person needs to survive in a rapidly changing world |edition=3rd |place=Rohnert Park, California |publisher=Sonoma State University Press |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, educators view the taxonomy as a hierarchy and may mistakenly dismiss the lowest levels as unworthy of teaching.&lt;ref name="Flannery"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flannery |first=Maura C. |date=November 2007 |title=Observations on biology |journal=[[The American Biology Teacher]] |volume=69 |issue=9 |pages=561–564 |doi=10.1662/0002-7685(2007)69[561:OOB]2.0.CO;2 |url=https://www.nabt.org/websites/institution/File/pdfs/american_biology_teacher/2007/069-09-0561.pdf |quote=Biology is often referred to as an observational science almost as a slur, with the implication that biologists simply look at the living world without the strong theoretical and mathematic underpinnings of a science like physics. There is the suggestion that observation is easy. Thus biology is viewed as a lightweight science—anyone can do it: just go out and start looking, at birds, at grass, at cells under the microscope. Benjamin Bloom's taxonomy of learning tasks puts observation at the lowest level, with recall of information. This denigration of observation has long bothered me because I see it as often difficult and complex, a skill that needs to be learned and a talent that is much more developed in some.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawler"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lawler |first=Susan |date=26 February 2016 |title=Identification of animals and plants is an essential skill set |publisher=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |url=https://theconversation.com/identification-of-animals-and-plants-is-an-essential-skill-set-55450 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117044125/http://theconversation.com/identification-of-animals-and-plants-is-an-essential-skill-set-55450 |archivedate=17 November 2016 |accessdate=5 March 2017 |quote=Ironically, the dogma that has been so detrimental to field taxonomy is known as Bloom's taxonomy. University lecturers are told to apply an educational theory developed by Benjamin Bloom, which categorises assessment tasks and learning activities into cognitive domains. In Bloom's taxonomy, identifying and naming are at the lowest level of cognitive skills and have been systematically excluded from University degrees because they are considered simplistic.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The learning of the lower levels enables the building of skills in the higher levels of the taxonomy, and in some fields, the most important skills are in the lower levels (such as identification of species of plants and animals in the field of [[natural history]]).&lt;ref name="Flannery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawler"/&gt; [[Instructional scaffolding]] of higher-level skills from lower-level skills is an application of [[Vygotskian]] [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivism]].&lt;ref name="vygotsky1978"&gt;{{cite book |last=Vygotsky |first=L. S. |author-link=Lev Vygotsky |year=1978 |title=Mind in society: the development of higher psychological processes |chapter=Chapter 6: Interaction between learning and development |pp=79–91 |place=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keene |first1=Judith |last2=Colvin |first2=John |last3=Sissons |first3=Justine |date=June 2010 |origyear=2010 |title=Mapping student information literacy activity against Bloom's taxonomy of cognitive skills |journal=Journal of Information Literacy |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=6–21 |doi=10.11645/4.1.189 |url=http://jil.lboro.ac.uk/ojs/index.php/JIL/article/view/PRA-V4-I1-2010-1 |quote=When supporting students outside the classroom situation, a subject aware advisor should be capable of spotting mistakes in a student's solution and of analysing these mistakes to identify the difficulty that the student is encountering. Such support can be seen as offering scaffolding in a student's 'zone of proximal development' (Vygotsky, 1978) and exemplified by teaching students to analyse a problem through the identification of the key elements and the relationships between these elements.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some consider the three lowest levels as hierarchically ordered, but the three higher levels as parallel.&lt;ref name="anderaetal2001" /&gt; Others say that it is sometimes better to move to Application before introducing concepts,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} the idea is to create a learning environment where the real world context comes first and the theory second to promote the student's grasp of the phenomenon, concept or event. This 
thinking would seem to relate to the method of [[problem-based learning]].

Furthermore, the distinction between the categories can be seen as artificial since any given cognitive task may entail a number of processes. It could even be argued that any attempt to nicely categorize cognitive processes into clean, cut-and-dried classifications undermines the holistic, highly connective and interrelated nature of cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fadul |first=J. A.|title=Collective Learning: Applying distributed cognition for collective intelligence|journal=The International Journal of Learning|volume=16 | issue =4 |pages=211–220 |issn=1447-9494|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a criticism that can be directed at taxonomies of mental processes in general.

==Implications==
Bloom's taxonomy serves as the backbone of many teaching philosophies, in particular, those that lean more towards skills rather than content.&lt;ref name="krathwohl2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="anderaetal2001" /&gt; These educators view content as a vessel for teaching skills. The emphasis on higher-order thinking inherent in such philosophies is based on the top levels of the taxonomy including analysis, evaluation, synthesis and creation. Bloom's taxonomy can be used as a teaching tool to help balance assessment and evaluative questions in class, assignments and texts to ensure all orders of thinking are exercised in students' learning, including aspects of information searching.&lt;ref&gt;BJ Jansen, D Booth, B Smith (2009) [https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/pubs/jansen_using_the_taxonomy_of_cognitive_learning_to_model_online_searching.pdf Using the taxonomy of cognitive learning to model online searching], Information Processing &amp; Management 45 (6), 643-663&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connections across disciplines==
The skill development that takes place at these higher orders of thinking interacts well with a developing global focus on multiple literacies and modalities in learning and the emerging field of integrated disciplines.&lt;ref name="selander2012"&gt;*{{cite journal |last1=Kress |first1=G. |last2=Selander |first2=S. |year=2012 |title=Multimodal design, learning and cultures of recognition |journal=Internet and Higher Education |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=265–268 |doi=10.1016/j.iheduc.2011.12.003 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to interface with and create media would draw upon skills from multiple levels of the taxonomy including analysis, application and creation.&lt;ref name="paul2004"&gt;*{{cite book |last1=Paul |first1=R. |last2=Elder |first2=L. |year=2004 |title=Critical and creative thinking |place=Dillon Beach, CA |publisher=The Foundation for Critical Thinking |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="london1996"&gt;*{{cite book |author=The New London Group |year=1996 |title=A pedagogy of multiliteracies: designing social futures |publisher=Harvard Educational Review |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloom's taxonomy (and the revised taxonomy) continues to be a source of inspiration for educational philosophy and for developing new teaching strategies.

'''Child abduction''' or '''child theft''' is the unauthorized removal of a [[Minor (law)|minor]] (a child under the age of [[Age of majority|legal adulthood]]) from the [[Child custody|custody]] of the child's [[Parent|natural parents]] or [[Legal guardian|legally appointed guardians]].
 
The term child abduction conflates two legal and social categories which differ by their perpetrating contexts: abduction by members of the child's family or abduction by strangers:

* [[Parental child abduction]]: unauthorized custody of a child by a family relative (usually one or both parents) without parental agreement and contrary to family law ruling, which may have removed the child from the care, access and contact of the other parent and family side. Occurring around parental [[Legal separation|separation]] or [[divorce]], such parental or familial child abduction may include [[parental alienation]], a form of child abuse seeking to disconnect a child from targeted parent and denigrated side of [[family]].
* [[Kidnapping|Abduction or kidnapping]] by strangers (from outside the family, natural or legal guardians) who steal  a child for criminal purposes which may include:
** [[extortion]], to elicit a [[ransom]] from the guardians for the child's return
** illegal [[adoption]], a stranger steals a child with the intent to rear the child as their own or to sell to a prospective adoptive parent
** [[human trafficking]], a stranger steals a child with the intent to exploit the child themselves or by trade in a list of possible abuses including [[child slavery|slavery]], [[child labor|forced labor]], [[child sexual abuse|sexual abuse]], or even [[Organ trade#Illegal organ trading|illegal organ trading]]
** [[murder]]

Neonatal "infant abduction" and prenatal [[fetal abduction]] are the earliest ages of child abduction as defined by a viable child through the age of majority. In addition, "embryo theft" and even "oocyte misappropriation" in reproductive medical settings have been legalistically construed as child abduction.&lt;ref name="pmid9242390"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Lehrman S| title=University settles with patients over trade in 'stolen' embryos. | journal=Nature | year= 1997 | volume= 388 | issue= 6641 | pages= 411 | pmid=9242390 | doi=10.1038/41181 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=9242390  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Judith D.|title=Misappropriation of Human Eggs and Embryos and the Tort of Conversion: A Relational View|journal=Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review|date=1999|volume=32|issue=381|url=http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/llr/vol32/iss2/2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=Karen T.|title=Embryo Theft: The Misappropriation of Human Eggs at an Irvine Fertility Clinic Has Raised a Host of New Legal Concerns for Infertile Couples Using New Reproductive Technologies|journal=Southwestern University Law Review|date=1997|volume=26|issue=1133|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/swulr26&amp;div=31&amp;id=&amp;page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abductions by strangers ==
The stereotypical version of child abduction by a stranger is the classic form of "[[kidnapping]]," exemplified by the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]], in which the child is detained, transported some distance, held for ransom or with intent to keep the child permanently. These instances are rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/documents/nismart2_nonfamily.pdf |title=NISMART National Non-Family Abduction Report October 2002 (A study commissioned by the US Department of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention found that there were only approximately 115 stereotypical stranger abductions in 1999) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child abduction for ransom: United States ===
[[File:2007 report child plane.jpg|thumb|left|Image from the [[United States Hague Abduction Convention Compliance Reports]] on the [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]]]]

The earliest nationally publicised kidnapping of a child by a stranger for the purpose of extracting a ransom payment from the parents was the Pool case of 1819, which took place in Baltimore, Maryland. Margaret Pool, 20-months-old, was kidnapped on May 20 by Nancy Gamble (19-years-old) and secreted with the assistance of Marie Thomas. On May 22, the parents, James and Mary Pool, placed an ad in the ''Baltimore Patriot'' newspaper offering a $20 reward for Mary's return. When the child was recovered on May 23—through the efforts of members of the community who conducted a search—it was revealed that the child had been badly whipped by Gamble and bore bloody wounds. Both Gamble and Thomas were tried for the crime of kidnapping and found guilty. The motive for the crime was demonstrated to be financial. She had kidnapped the child with the intention of waiting for a reward to be offered, then would return the child and collect the money. This is a technique favored by many ransom child kidnappers before the use of written ransom demands became the favored method.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Nancy Gamble's crime and subsequent trial were reported in detail in ''Baltimore Patriot'' (June 26, 1819). The June 26 article, as well as others on the case that had appeared in the ''Patriot'', were reprinted in newspapers in other states including: Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia and Washington D.C.

=== Children abducted for slavery ===
{{Main|Child slavery}}
In 1597, [[Elizabeth I of England]] licensed the abduction of children for use as chapel choristers and theatre performers.&lt;ref name=bbc130617&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-22938866 | title = Elizabethan child actors 'kidnapped and whipped' | first = Sean | last = Coughlan | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 17 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are reports that abduction of children to be used or sold as [[slavery|slaves]] is common in parts of Africa.

The [[Lord's Resistance Army]], a rebel paramilitary group operating mainly in northern [[Uganda]], is notorious for its abductions of children for use as [[child soldier]]s or [[sex slave]]s. According to the [[Sudan Tribune]], {{as of|2005|lc=y}}, more than 30,000 children have been kidnapped by the LRA and their leader, Joseph Kony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/article.php3?id_article=11792 |title=Time may be running out for Uganda's LRA warlord – Sudan Tribune: Plural news and views on Sudan |publisher=Sudan Tribune |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By stranger to raise ===
A very small number of abductions result from - in most cases - women who kidnap babies (or other young children) to bring up as their own. These women are often unable to have children of their own, or have [[Miscarriage|miscarried]], and seek to satisfy their unmet psychological need by abducting a child rather than by [[adoption|adopting]]. The crime is often premeditated, with the woman often [[simulated pregnancy|simulating pregnancy]] to reduce suspicion when a baby suddenly appears in the household.

Historically, a few states have practiced child abduction for [[indoctrination]], as a form of punishment for political opponents, or for profit.

Some other abductions have been to make children available by [[child-selling]] for adoption by other people,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/china/21570762-curb-widespread-trafficking-abducted-children-officials-and-parents-are-turning-social ''Child Trafficking: A Cruel Trade'', in ''The Economist'', January 26, 2013], as accessed July 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; without adopting parents necessarily being aware of how children were actually made available for adoption.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Barbara Bisantz, ''The Baby Thief: The Untold Story of Georgia Tann, the Baby Seller Who Corrupted Adoption'' (New York: Union Square Press, 1st ed. 2007 ({{ISBN|978-1-4027-5863-8}})), p.&amp;nbsp;245.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parental child abduction ==
{{Main|Parental child abduction}}
By far the most common kind of child abduction is parental child abduction (200,000 in 2010 alone)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maureen|first=Dabbagh|title=Parental Kidnapping in America|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|location=US|isbn=978-0-7864-6533-0|page=1|url=http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6533-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and often occurs when the parents separate or begin divorce proceedings. A parent may remove or retain the child from the other seeking to gain an advantage in expected or pending child-custody proceedings or because that parent fears losing the child in those expected or pending child-custody proceedings; a parent may refuse to return a child at the end of an ''[[contact (law)|access]] visit'' or may flee with the child to prevent an access visit or fear of domestic violence and abuse.

Parental child abductions may be within the same city, within the state region or within the same country, or may be international. Studies performed for the [[U.S. Department of Justice]]'s [[Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention]] reported that in 1999, 53% percent of family abducted children were gone less than one week, and 21% were gone one month or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingkids.com/en_US/documents/nismart2_familyabduction.pdf |title=NISMART National Family Abduction Report, October 2002 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International child abduction ===
{{Main|International child abduction}}

International child abduction occurs when a parent, relative or acquaintance of a child leaves the country with the child or children in violation of a custody decree or visitation order. Another related situation is retention where children are taken on an alleged vacation to a foreign country and are not returned.

While the number of cases which is over 600,000 a year consists of international child abduction is small in comparison to domestic cases, they are often the most difficult to resolve due to the involvement of conflicting international jurisdictions.  Two-thirds of international parental abduction cases involve mothers who often allege domestic violence. Even when there is a treaty agreement for the return of a child, the court may be reluctant to return the child if the return could result in the permanent separation of the child from their primary caregiver. This could occur if the abducting parent faced criminal prosecution or deportation by returning to the child's home country.

The [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]] is an international human rights treaty and legal mechanism to recover children abducted to another country. The Hague Convention does not provide relief in many cases resulting in some parents hiring private parties to recover their children. Covert recovery was first made public when Don Feeney, a former Delta Commando, responded to a desperate mother's plea to locate and recover her daughter from Jordan in the 1980s. Feeney successfully located and returned the child. A movie and book about Feeney's exploits lead to other desperate parents seeking him out for recovery services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;#8250 Donya Al-Nahi |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0671769340 |title=Rescue My Child: The Story of the Ex-Delta Commandos Who Bring Home Children Abducted Overseas: Neil C. Livingstone: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007, both the United States, European authorities, and NGO's had begun serious interest in the use of mediation as a means by which some international child abduction cases may be resolved. The primary focus was on Hague Cases. Development of mediation in Hague cases, suitable for such an approach, had been tested and reported by REUNITE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reunite.org/ |title=Reunite International |publisher=Reunite.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; a London Based NGO which provides support in international child abduction cases, as successful. Their reported success lead to the first international training for cross-border mediation in 2008, sponsored by NCMEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingkids.com |title=National Center for Missing and Exploited Children |publisher=Missingkids.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Held at the University of Miami School of Law, Lawyers, Judges, and certified mediators interested in international child abduction cases, attended.

International child abduction is not new. A case of international child abduction has been documented aboard the Titanic. However, the incidence of international child abduction continues to increase due to the ease of international travel, increase in bi-cultural marriages and a high divorce rate. Parental abduction has been defined as child abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prevent-abuse-now.com/unreport.htm |title=Parental Child Abduction is Child Abuse |first=Dr. Nancy |last=Faulkner |publisher=Prevent-abuse-now.com |date=June 9, 1999 |accessdate=September 9, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926135211/http://www.prevent-abuse-now.com/unreport.htm |archivedate=September 26, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global Missing Children's Network==
Launched in 1998 as a [[joint venture]] of the [[International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]] (ICMEC) and NCMEC, the Global Missing Children's Network (GMCN) is a network of countries that connect, share [[best practices]], and disseminate information and images of missing children to improve the effectiveness of missing children investigations.&lt;ref name=ncmissing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingkids.com/GMCN|title=Global Missing Children's Network|publisher=NCMEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cyber&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0rVfRwcIPYgC&amp;pg=SA11-PA31&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBg&amp;q=icmec%20children|title=Computer Forensics: Investigating Network Intrusions and Cyber Crime|author= EC-Council|publisher= Cengage Learning|pages=11–26, 11–31 to 11–33|year= 2009|ISBN=1435483529}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=more/&gt;  The Network has 22 member countries: Albania, Argentina, Australia, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the US.&lt;ref name=more&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/activities-in-more-than-22-countries-around-the-globe-will-remember-missing-children-on-may-25-2013-05-22|title=Activities in More than 22 Countries around the Globe will Remember Missing Children on May 25|date=May 22, 2013|work=MarketWatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each country can access a customizable website platform, and can enter missing children information into a centralized, multilingual database that has photos of and information about missing children, which can be viewed and distributed to assist in location and recovery efforts.&lt;ref name=ncmissing/&gt;&lt;ref name=cyber/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.police.govt.nz/news/release/31680 "New Zealand Police joins Global Missing Children's Network"], [[New Zealand Police]].

The parents of [[Madeleine McCann]], a three-year-old girl who disappeared from her bed in a hotel in Portugal in 2007, approached ICMEC to help them publicize her case. ICMEC's YouTube channel, "Don'tYouForgetAboutMe," which lets people post videos, images, and information about their missing children, was launched that year as a part of these efforts, and {{as of|2014|November|lc=y}} had 2,200 members.&lt;ref name=peo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20051149,00.html|title=Madeleine McCann's Parents Create Missing Kids Site on Youtube|work=People|author=Ellen Tumposky|date=August 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/DontYouForgetAboutMe|title=DontYouForgetAboutMe|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/10/ukcrime.madeleinemccann|title=You have to blank out the dark thoughts|newspaper= ''The Guardian''|date=August 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ICMEC reviews the postings to ensure that any child in a posted video is in fact missing, that authorities are aware that the child is missing, and that the images are not inappropriate.&lt;ref name=peo/&gt;

The '''classical general equilibrium model''' aims to describe the economy by aggregating the behavior of individuals and firms. Note that the classical [[general equilibrium]] model is unrelated to [[classical economics]], and was instead developed within [[neoclassical economics]] beginning in the late 19th century.

In the model, the [[individual]] is assumed to be the basic unit of analysis and these individuals, both workers and employers, will make choices that reflect their unique tastes, objectives, and preferences. It is assumed that individuals' wants typically exceed their ability to satisfy them (hence scarcity of [[good (economics)|goods]] and time). It is further assumed that individuals will eventually experience diminishing marginal utility. Finally, [[wages]] and [[prices]] are assumed to be elastic (they move up and down freely). The classical model assumes that traditional [[supply and demand]] analysis is the best approach to understanding the [[labor market]]. The functions that follow are aggregate functions that can be thought of as the summation of all the individual participants in the market.

==Aggregate supply==
{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}
==Labor demand==
The consumers of the labor market are firms. The demand for labor services is a derived demand, derived from the supply and demand for the firm's products in the goods market. It is assumed that a firm's objective is to maximize [[Profit (economics)|profit]] given the demand for its products, and given the production technology that is available to it.

Some notation:
 Let &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; be price level of commodities
 Let &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; be nominal wage
 Let &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; be real wage (w/p)
 Let &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; be profit of firms
 Let &lt;math&gt;L^{D}&lt;/math&gt; be labor demand
 Let &lt;math&gt;Y^{S}&lt;/math&gt; be the firms output of commodities that it will supply to the goods market.

===Output function===
Let us specify this output (commodity supply) function as:
:&lt;math&gt;Y^{S}(L^{D})&lt;/math&gt;
It is an increasing concave function with respect to L&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt; because of the [[Production theory basics|Diminishing Marginal Product]] of Labor. Note that in this simplified model, labour is the only factor of production. If we were analysing the goods market, this simplification could cause problems, but because we are looking at the labor market, this simplification is worthwhile.

===Firms' profit function===
Generally a firm's profit is calculated as:
 profit = revenue - cost&lt;br&gt;
In ''nominal terms'' the profit function is:
 &lt;math&gt;p \cdot \pi = p \cdot Y^{S} - w \cdot L^{D}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In ''real terms'' this becomes:
 &lt;math&gt;\pi = Y^{S} - \frac{w}{p} \cdot L^{D} = Y^{S} - \omega \cdot L^{D}&lt;/math&gt;

===Firms' optimal (profit maximizing) condition===
In an attempt to achieve an optimal situation, firms can maximize profits with this ''Maximized profit function'':
 &lt;math&gt;\frac{dY^{S}(L^{D})}{dL^{D}} = \omega&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When functions are given, Labor Demand (L&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;) can be derived from this equation.

==Labour supply==
The suppliers of the labor market are [[household]]s. A household can be thought of as the summation of all the individuals within the household. Each household offers an amount of labour services to the market. The supply of labour can be thought of as the summation of the labour services offered by all the households. The amount of service that each household offers depends on the consumption requirements of the household, and the individuals relative preference for consumption verses free time.

Some notation:
 Let U be total utility
 Let Y&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt; be commodity demand (consumption)
 Let L&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt; be labor supply (hours worked)
 Let D(L&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;) be disutility from working, an increasing convex function with respect to L&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Households' consumption constraint===
Consumption constraint = profit income + wage income&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;Y^{D} = \pi + \omega \cdot L^{S}&lt;/math&gt;

===Households' utility function===
total utility = utility from consumption - disutility from work &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;U = Y^{D} - D(L^{S})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''substitute consumption''': &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;U = \pi + \omega \cdot L^{S} - D(L^{S})&lt;/math&gt;

===Households' optimal condition===
'''Maximized utility function''': &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dD(L^{S})}{dL^{S}} = \omega&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When functions are given, Labor Supply (L&lt;sup&gt;S&lt;/sup&gt;) can be derived from this equation.

==Aggregate demand==
Y = C + I + G
whereby Y is output, C is consumption, I is investment and G is government spending

In the design of [[radio]] broadcast systems, especially [[television]] systems, the desired-to-undesired channel ratio ('''D/U ratio''') is a measure of the strength of the broadcast signal for a particular channel compared with the strength of undesired [[broadcast signal]]s in the same channel (e.g. from other nearby transmitting stations).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7640">In [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], a '''direct proof''' is a way of showing the
[[truth]] or falsehood of a given statement by a straightforward combination of
established facts, usually [[axiom]]s, existing [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]]s and [[theorem]]s, without making any further assumptions.&lt;ref name="nutsandbolts"&gt;Cupillari, Antonella. ''The Nuts and Bolts of Proofs''. Academic Press, 2001. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to directly prove a [[Material conditional|conditional]] statement of the form "If ''p'', then ''q''", it suffices to consider the situations in which the statement ''p'' is true. Logical deduction is employed to reason from assumptions to conclusion. The type of logic employed is almost invariably [[first-order logic]], employing the quantifiers ''for all'' and ''there exists''. Common proof rules used are [[modus ponens]] and [[universal instantiation]].&lt;ref name="advanced-discrete-structure"&gt;C. Gupta, S. Singh, S. Kumar ''Advanced Discrete Structure''. I.K. International Publishing House Pvt. Ltd., 2010. Page 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, an [[indirect proof]] may begin with certain hypothetical scenarios and then proceed to eliminate the uncertainties in each of these scenarios until an inescapable conclusion is forced. For example, instead of showing directly ''p'' ⇒ ''q'', one proves its [[contrapositive]] ~''q'' ⇒ ~''p'' (one assumes ~''q'' and shows that it leads to ~''p''). Since ''p'' ⇒ ''q'' and ~''q'' ⇒ ~''p'' are equivalent by the principle of [[transposition (logic)|transposition]] (see [[law of excluded middle]]), ''p'' ⇒ ''q'' is indirectly proved. Proof methods that are not direct include [[proof by contradiction]], including [[proof by infinite descent]].  Direct proof methods include [[proof by exhaustion]] and [[proof by induction]].

==History and etymology==
[[File:Geometric Constructions.png|thumb|Geometric Constructions]]
[[File:Math Derivation.png|thumb|New result from an old result]]
A direct proof is the simplest form of proof there is. The word ‘proof’ comes from the Latin word probare,&lt;ref name="latin"&gt;New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; which means “to test”.  The earliest use of proofs was prominent in legal proceedings. A person with authority, such as a nobleman, was said to have probity, which means that the evidence was by his relative authority, which outweighed empirical testimony.  In days gone by, mathematics and proof was often intertwined with practical questions – with populations like the [[Egyptians]] and the [[Greeks]] showing an interest in surveying land.&lt;ref name="stevengkrantz"&gt;Krantz, Steven G. ''The History and Concept of Mathematical Proof''. February 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a natural curiosity with regards to [[geometry]] and [[trigonometry]] – particularly [[triangles]] and [[rectangles]]. These were the shapes which provided the most questions in terms of practical things, so early geometrical concepts were focused on these shapes, for example, the likes of buildings and pyramids used these shapes in abundance. Another shape which is crucial in the history of direct proof is the [[circle]], which was crucial for the design of arenas and water tanks. This meant that ancient geometry (and [[Euclidean Geometry]]) discussed circles.

The earliest form of mathematics was [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]]. For example, if someone could draw a reasonable picture, or give a convincing description, then that met all the criteria for something to be described as a mathematical “fact”. On occasion, [[analogical]] arguments took place, or even by “invoking the gods”. The idea that mathematical statements could be proven had not been developed yet, so these were the earliest forms of the concept of proof, despite not being actual proof at all.

Proof as we know it came about with one specific question: “what is a proof?” Traditionally, a proof is a platform which convinces someone beyond reasonable doubt that a statement is mathematically true. Naturally, one would assume that the best way to prove the truth of something like this (B) would be to draw up a [[comparison (mathematics)|comparison]] with something old (A) that has already been proven as true. Thus was created the concept of deriving a new result from an old result.

==Examples==

===The sum of two even integers equals an even integer===

Consider two [[Even and odd numbers|even]] integers {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}. Since they are even, they can be written as

:&lt;math&gt; x =2a &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y=2b &lt;/math&gt;

respectively for integers {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}. 
Then the sum can be written as

:&lt;math&gt; x+y = 2a + 2b = 2(a+b)=2p&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;p=a+b&lt;/math&gt;, {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are all integers.
It follows that {{math|''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''}} has 2 as a factor and therefore is even, so the sum of any two even integers is even.

===Pythagoras' theorem===

[[File:Diagram of Pythagoras Theorem simplified.png|right|Diagram of Pythagoras Theorem]]

Observe that we have four right-angled triangles and a square packed into a large square. Each of the triangles has sides ''a'' and ''b'' and hypotenuse ''c''. The area of a square is defined as the square of the length of its sides - in this case, ''(a + b)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. However, the area of the large square can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of its components. In this case, that would be the sum of the areas of the four triangles and the small square in the middle.&lt;ref name="theproofisthepudding"&gt;Krantz, Steven G. ''The Proof is the Pudding''. Springer, 2010. Page 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

We know that the area of the large square is equal to ''(a + b)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''.

The area of a triangle is equal to &lt;math&gt; \frac12ab. &lt;/math&gt;

We know that the area of the large square is also equal to the sum of the areas of the triangles, plus the area of the small square, and thus the area of the large square equals &lt;math&gt; 4(\frac 12 ab) + c^2.&lt;/math&gt;

These are equal, and so

::&lt;math&gt; (a + b)^2 = 4(\frac 12 ab) + c^2 .&lt;/math&gt;

After some simplifying,

::&lt;math&gt; a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + c^2 .&lt;/math&gt;

Removing the ab that appears on both sides gives

::&lt;math&gt; a^2 + b^2 = c^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;

which proves Pythagoras' theorem. ∎

=== The square of an odd number is also odd ===

By definition, if ''n'' is an odd integer, it can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt; n = 2k + 1&lt;/math&gt;
for some integer ''k''. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
n^2 &amp;= (2k + 1)^2\\ 
&amp;= (2k + 1)(2k + 1)\\ 
&amp;=4k^2 + 2k + 2k + 1\\ 
&amp;=4k^2 + 4k + 1\\ 
&amp;=2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Since 2''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+ 2''k'' is an integer, ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is also odd.  ∎

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11439">A '''Dynamic Global Vegetation Model''' (DGVM) is a computer program that [[computer simulation|simulates]] shifts in potential vegetation and its associated [[biogeochemical cycle|biogeochemical]] and [[hydrological cycle]]s as a response to shifts in climate. DGVMs use [[time series]] of [[climate]] data and, given constraints of latitude, topography, and soil characteristics, simulate monthly or daily dynamics of ecosystem processes.  DGVMs are used most often to simulate the effects of future [[climate change]] on natural [[vegetation]] and its [[carbon cycle|carbon]] and water cycles.

DGVMs generally combine [[biogeochemistry]], [[biogeography]], and disturbance submodels.  Disturbance is often limited to [[wildfire]]s, but in principle could include any of: forest/land management decisions, [[windthrow]], insect damage, ozone damage etc.  DGVMs usually "spin up" their simulations from bare ground to equilibrium vegetation (e.g. [[climax community]]) to establish realistic initial values for their various "pools": carbon and nitrogen in live and dead vegetation, [[soil organic matter]], etc. corresponding to a documented historical vegetation cover.

DGVMs are usually run in a spatially distributed mode, with simulations carried out for thousands of "cells", geographic points which are assumed to have homogeneous conditions within each cell.  Simulations are carried out across a range of spatial scales, from global to landscape.  Cells are usually arranged as lattice points; the distance between adjacent lattice points may be as coarse as a few degrees of latitude or longitude, or as fine as 30 arc-seconds.  Simulations of the conterminous United States in the first DGVM comparison exercise (LPJ and MC1) called the VEMAP&lt;ref&gt;VEMAP Members. 1995. Vegetation/ecosystem modeling and analysis project: comparing biogeography and biogeochemistry models in a continental-scale study of terrestrial ecosystem responses to climate change and CO2 doubling. Global Biogeochemical Cycles. 9(4):407–437&lt;/ref&gt; project in the 1990s used a lattice grain of one-half degree. Global simulations by the PIK group and collaborators &lt;ref&gt;Cramer, W., A. Bondeau, F.I. Woodward, I.C. Prentice, R. Betts, V. Brovkin, P.M. Cox, V. Fischer, J.A. Foley, A.D. Friend, C. Kucharik, M.R. Lomas, N. Ramankutty, S. Sitch, B. Smith, A. White, and C. Young-Molling. 2001. Global response of terrestrial ecosystem structure and function to CO2 and climate change: results from six dynamic global vegetation models. Global Change Biology 7:357–373&lt;/ref&gt; using 6 different DGVMs (HYBRID, IBIS, LPJ, SDGVM, TRIFFID, and VECODE) used the same resolution as the [[general circulation model]] (GCM) that provided the climate data, 3.75 deg longitude x 2.5 deg latitude, a total of 1631 land grid cells.  Sometimes lattice distances are specified in kilometers rather than angular measure, especially for finer grains, so a project like VEMAP &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/vemap/&lt;/ref&gt; is often referred to as 50&amp;nbsp;km grain.

Several DGVMs appeared in the middle 1990s.  The first was apparently IBIS (Foley et al., 1996), VECODE (Brovkin et al., 1997), followed by several others described below:

Several DGVMs have been developed by various research groups around the world:

'''Ecogovernmentality''', (or '''environmentality'''), is the application of Foucault’s concepts of [[biopower]] and [[governmentality]] to the analysis of the regulation of [[Social relation|social interactions]] with the natural world. The concept of Ecogovernmentality expands on Foucault’s genealogical examination of the state to include ecological rationalities and technologies of government (Malette, 2009).  Begun in the mid-1990s by a small body of theorists (Luke, Darier, and Rutherford) the literature on ecogovernmentality grew as a response to the perceived lack of Foucauldian analysis of [[environmentalism]] and in [[environmental studies]].

Following [[Michel Foucault]], writing on ecogovernmentality focuses on how [[government agencies]], in combination with producers of expert knowledge, construct “The Environment.” This construction is viewed both in terms of the creation of an object of knowledge and a sphere within which certain types of intervention and management are created and deployed to further the government’s larger aim of managing the lives of its constituents.  This governmental management is dependent on the dissemination and [[internalization]] of knowledge/power among individual actors. This creates a decentered network of self-regulating elements whose interests become integrated with those of the State.

Ecogovernmentality is part of the broader area of [[political ecology]].  It can be situated within the ongoing debates over how to balance concern with socio-natural relationships with attention to the actual environmental impact of specific interactions.  The term is most useful to authors like Bryant, Watts and Peet who argue for the importance of a [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of nature that builds from [[post-structuralist]] concerns with knowledge, power and discourse.  In addition, it is of particular use to [[Geography|geographers]] because of its ability to link place based socio-environmental phenomena with the non-place based influences of both national and international systems of governance.  Particularly, for studies of environmental changes that extend beyond the borders one particular region, ecogovernmentality can prove a useful analytical tool for tracing the manifestations of specific policy across scales ranging from the individual, the [[community]], the [[State (polity)|state]] and on to larger structures of international [[environmental governance]].

== Resource management and the state ==
Work done by Rutherford, on US [[Environmental impact assessment|Environmental Impact Assessments]], and by Agrawal on local forest governance in India, are examples of this method of analysis.  Both illustrate how the production of specific types of expert knowledge (statistical models of [[pollution]], or the economic productivity of forests) coupled with specific technologies of government (the EIA assessment regime or local Forest Stewardship Councils) can bring individual interest in line with those of the state.  This, not through the imposition of specific outcomes, but by creating frameworks that rationalizes [[behavior]] in particular ways and involve individuals in the process of problem definition and [[Interventionism (politics)|intervention]].

Within a geographical context, this type of analysis provides insight into how territory is brought under state control, and how the [[regulation]] of human interaction with this territory is achieved.  Focusing on the evolution of techniques of [[cartography]], systems of [[Biological classification|natural classification]], and early attempts at scientific [[resource management]] in the 18th and 19th centuries, Braun (2000, 2003) and Scott (1998) show how new systems of knowledge extend systems of governmentality into the [[Nature|natural world]].  Fundamental to this analysis is a connection between the abstract [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] logic employed by states and the shape of the territory under their control. In Scott, for example, measuring nature in terms of concepts of production and natural resources “allowed the state to impose that logic on the very reality that was observed” (Scott, 14).  The complex natural systems of a given place are first depicted as simplified sites of managed [[resource extraction]]. As part of this management their ecological composition is changed (through types of planting, [[harvest]]ing and extraction) in an attempt to make them resemble more closely the simplified statistical systems with which they are measured.

In this manifestation, which focuses primarily on the administration of particular resources at a [[Nation|national level]], ecogovernmentality is linked to the larger governmental aims identified by Foucault of securing the [[wellbeing]] of its inhabitants by managing “a complex composed of men and things” (93).  Scott’s work on scientific [[forestry]] in [[early modern Europe]] shows how the rational models constructed by state foresters were part of the larger body of statistical knowledge created to manage [[population]] and facilitate “[[taxation]], political control, and [[conscription]]” (23).  Likewise, Braun’s analysis of the Geological Survey of Canada creates a clear link between methods of measuring and representing the [[mineral composition]] of a territory, and the structures of government put in place both to create the concept of a unified nation and “to manage individuals, goods and wealth so as to improve the condition of the state’s population” (27).

Here, ecogovernmentality is seen as a subset of concerns within of the larger Foucauldian concept. But implicit in this is an important claim: that the types of knowledge produced in the process of making nature intelligible to the state have an important influence on the evolution of state rationality itself, an influence not adequately covered in Foucault’s original [[formulation]].  They seek to add to Foucault’s discussion of population and the operation of systems of knowledge/power that normalized certain ways of acting and being and marginalized others.  Building on Foucault’s brief references to “resources, means of subsistence [and] the territory with its specific qualities”(93), their contribution is the investigation of the parallel systems of measuring and assigning value to the natural world (the “[[crop]]” and the “[[weed]]” (Scott, 13) acting as homologies to categories like “[[sanity]]” and “[[insanity]]” in Foucault’s work) and to give these their due in discussions of the formation of state rationality and structures of governmentality.

== Eco-power and discipline ==
The work of Timothy Luke pushes the reach of this concept further, by envisaging a radically different relationship between governmentality and ecogovernmentality.  He argues that the ecological domain has become the “ultimate domain of being”(150) the key location for the production of knowledge and power.  Following Foucault, Luke traces this transformation back to a specific historical moment, the period of the early 70s encompassing the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] and the détente between the [[USSR]] and the [[United States of America|US]].  From these beginnings, [[Conservation movement|environmental considerations]] grow, fertilized during the 1980s by the formation of [[Intergovernmental organization|international bodies]], like the [[UN World Commission on Environment and Development]], and increased concern and awareness over [[Steady state economy|ecological limits]] to [[Human development (humanity)|human development]].  The end result is the “environmentalization” of the production and exercise of knowledge and power.  Reversing the earlier focus on the integration of environmental knowledge into broader state projects of [[socio-economic management]], here it is these projects themselves which are reshaped by new forms of environmental knowledge (specifically the concepts of “[[ecology]]” and “[[sustainability]]”).  It is this new structure that becomes known as Ecogovernmentality.

Luke argues that heightened awareness of [[social vulnerability]] to [[environmental factors]] coupled with the increased importance of [[Macro-economics|macro-economic]] [[competition]] (rather than Cold-War [[Military conflict|military confrontation]]) in geo-political power struggles led to the rise of [[sustainable development]] as the synthesis of these two interrelated concerns.  The [[Discipline|disciplinary power]] of governmentality is refigured as “enviro-discipline”, a broader concept that “expresses the authority of eco-knowledgeable, geo-powered forces to police the fitness of all biological [[organisms]] and the health of their natural environments” (146).  This constitutes an important expansion of the object of governmental rule and the area to be managed.  Foucault’s focus on “population” now includes “all of life’s [[biodiversity]]” (Luke, 122) and, given the interconnected nature of environmental systems, states must now seek to extend their control far outside of their [[Border|territorial boundaries]] to ensure the security and productivity of their population (Luke 134).

Uniting both broad and narrow definitions of Ecogovernmentality is the attention paid to environmental subject formation, or the creation of environmental subject positions.  Definitions of these subject positions vary from Darrier’s (1999) construction of the environmental subject as a site for resistance to [[consumerism]] and the [[commodification]] of the relationship between the individual and the environment, through Agrawal’s broadly neutral concept of “environmentality” which denotes an acceptance on the part of the individual that nature is an object to be managed and their accompanying involvement in this process, to Luke’s (1999) assertion that “the environment emerges as a ground for [[Normalization (sociology)|normalizing]] individual behavior” that supersedes the previous influences of “the ethical concerns of family, community and nation” (149).  Underlying these [[Divergence|divergent]] definitions, is the common claim that the relationship between individual and environment is key to current analysis of systems of state management and governmentality.

== Ecogovernmentality and climate change ==

Since about 2002, scholars have analyzed the discourses surrounding global [[climate change]] and [[Climate change policy|related policies]] using ideas from [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and from ecogovernmentality.

This subfield or application of ecogovernmentality developed first by applying Foucauldean thought to analysis of national and international climate regimes, identifying categories and methodologies that work particularly well for climate change issues. As the application of ecogovernmentality to climate change has evolved, the principles of the theory have also been applied — in appropriately modified ways — to studies of state and local government as well as private and [[nonprofit organizations]].

Ecogovernmentality-grounded theories and methods of analysis have also begun to emerge as tools for examining climate change in fields outside political economy, such as [[communications]] and [[international relations]].

=== Development of ecogovernmentality and climate change studies ===

As researchers began to explore the application of ecogovernmentality to climate change problems and discourses, most studies focused on national and global scales. For example, an early study by Paul Henman applied governmentality to [[Australia]]n national policy and [[climate change modeling]], concluding that modeling was a technology for rendering climate governable though it would limit the capacity of government to respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henman|first=Paul|title=Computer Modeling and the Politics of Greenhouse Gas Policy in Australia|journal=Social Science Computer Review|date=Summer 2002|volume=20|issue=2|pages=161–173|doi=10.1177/089443930202000206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sverker Jagers and Johannes Stripple’s work published in 2003 identified the importance of [[Non state actors in environmental law|non-nation-state actors (NNSAs)]] in climate change [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]] and [[Climate change adaptation|adaptation]] efforts and suggested that “private regimes” like the [[insurance industry]] may be more successful than national and global power structures in addressing the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jagers|first=Sverker C.|author2=Johannes Stripple|title=Climate Governance Beyond the State|journal=Global Governance|date=July{{ndash}}September 2003|volume=9|issue=3|pages=385–399|jstor=27800489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies applying governmentality to climate change picked up in frequency in the mid-2000s. Angela Oels’ 2005 paper summarized the initial forays into governmentality-based analyses for climate change discourses and suggested that the functioning governmentality of the issue had shifted since the 1980s, from a [[biopower]]-based discourse to one rooted in advanced liberal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oels|first=Angela|title=Rendering climate change governable: From biopower to advanced liberal government?|journal=Journal of Environmental Policy &amp; Planning|year=2005|volume=7|issue=3|pages=185–207|doi=10.1080/15239080500339661}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She demonstrated a method of discourse analysis particularly suited for addressing climate change, examining objectives, fields of visibility, technical aspects, forms of knowledge and formation of identities. Oels also provided some categories into which discourses can be sorted. These categories were also used by Karin Bäckstrand and Eva Lövbrand, beginning in 2006 with analysis of tree-planting initiatives stemming from the [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bäckstrand|first=Karin|author2=Eva Lövbrand|title=Planting Trees to Mitigate Climate Change: Contested Discourses of Ecological Modernization, Green Governmentality and Civic Environmentalism|journal=Global Environmental Politics|date=February 2006|volume=6|issue=1|pages=50–75|doi=10.1162/glep.2006.6.1.50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their analysis of competing discourses in categories of ecological modernization, green governmentality, and civic environmentalism revealed areas of overlap and potential cooperation.

Also in 2006, Maria Carmen Lemos collaborated with Agrawal on a comprehensive summary of environmental governance studies to that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemos|first=Maria Carmen|author2=Arun Agrawal|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~arunagra/papers/publications/2006.%20Maria%20Carmen%20Lemos%20and%20Arun%20Agrawal.%20%20Environmental%20Governance.pdf|title=Environmental Governance|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|year=2006|volume=31|pages=297–325|doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.31.042605.135621|accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They divided the applications of these studies into two categories: resource management and climate change. Among other useful insights, their work provided a clear schematic for classifying new, hybrid forms of environmental governance and identifying where these forms derive their power — that is, from combinations of the state, the community, and the market.

=== Ecogovernmentality studies beyond global and national regimes ===

More recent studies have applied ecogovernmentality precepts to discourses at state and local levels. Chukwumerije Okereke, Harriet Bulkeley and Heike Schroeder published a study in 2009 that examined possible problems of power, relationships, structures, and agency in [[climate governance]] at scales other than national or global.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Okereke|first=Chukwumerije|author2=Harriet Bulkeley |author3=Heike Schroeder |title=Conceptualizing Climate Governance Beyond the International Regime|journal=Global Environmental Politics|year=2009|volume=9|issue=1|pages=58–78|doi=10.1162/glep.2009.9.1.58}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They suggested that examining these issues may help to overcome what they identify as an “impasse” in governmentality studies of global environmental problems.

As another example of an ecogovernmentality study of climate change at a non-global, non-national scale, Bulkeley’s 2010 paper examined network governance, vertical and horizontal power structures, political economics, the restructuring of the state, and institutional capacity, all at the urban scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulkeley|first=Harriet|title=Cities and the Governing of Climate Change|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|date=November 2010|volume=35|pages=229–253|doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-072809-101747}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bulkeley argued for the importance of nuanced analyses of government at non-national, non-global scales as an important field in climate change governmentality studies.

A survey study from Dallas Elgin, Andrew Pattison and Christopher M. Weible in 2011 examines analytical capacity regarding climate change at the (U.S.) state level, concluding that the [[neoliberal]] government there is not as “hollowed out” as they expected but still lacks needed analytical capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elgin|first=Dallas J.|author2=Andrew Pattison |author3=Christopher M. Weible |title=Policy Analytical Capacity Inside and Outside of Government: A Case Studyof Colorado Climate and Energy Issues|journal=Canadian Political Science Review|year=2012|volume=6|issue=1|pages=101–116|url=http://ojs.unbc.ca/index.php/cpsr/article/viewFile/378/374|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emerging influence in other fields ===

Ecogovernmentality-grounded studies in climate change are also emerging in fields outside political economy. For example, Max Boykoff’s work analyzing [[media coverage of climate change]] in his 2011 book was grounded in discourses analysis along with his perhaps-better-known content analysis methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boykoff|first=Maxwell T.|title=Who Speaks for the Climate? Making Sense of Media Reporting on Climate Change|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-13305-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Weingart, Anita Engels and Petra Pansegrau published a study using a similar combination of methods in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weingart|first=Peter|author2=Anita Engels |author3=Petra Pansegrau |title=Risks of communication: discourses on climate change in science, politics, and the mass media|journal=Public Understanding of Science|date=July 2000|volume=9|issue=3|pages=261–283|doi=10.1088/0963-6625/9/3/304}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Boykoff’s work was cited in [[An Inconvenient Truth]] and has received far more scholarly and public attention. Other media studies scholars have followed Boykoff’s lead incorporating discourses analysis in their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Antilla|first=Liisa|citeseerx = 10.1.1.372.2033|title=Climate of scepticism: US newspaper coverage of the science of climate change.|journal=Global Environmental Change|year=2005|volume=15|issue=4|pages=338–352|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2005.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another communications-related study, David Ockwell, Lorraine Whitmarsh and Saffron O’Neill applied governmentality concepts to a U.K. government [[marketing]] campaign aimed at increasing “green” behaviors in citizens.&lt;ref name="May 7, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ockwell|first=David|author2=Lorraine Whitmarsh |author3=Saffron O'Neill |title=Reorienting Climate Change Communication for Effective Mitigation: Forcing People to be Green or Fostering Grass-Roots Engagement?|journal=Science Communication|date=March 2009|volume=30|issue=3|pages=305–327|doi=10.1177/1075547008328969}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their analysis of why the campaign was ineffective, they identify regime-based barriers to behavior change, including infrastructure, financial, and structural barriers.

Chris Methmann has published work on global warming as a form of global governmentality in the field of [[international relations]], citing the [[carbon market]] as a means of conducting individual conduct from a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Methmann|first=Chris Paul|url=http://ejt.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/10/26/1354066111415300.full.pdf|title=The sky is the Limit: Global Warming as Global Governmentality|journal=European Journal of International Relations|date=October 27, 2011|pages=1–23|doi=10.1177/1354066111415300|accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He concluded that the Clean Development Mechanism of carbon credit trading has become easily established because it protects “business as usual” – the established order of power.

Robyn Dowling argued for inclusion of ecogovernmentality perspectives regarding identity formation in the field of [[human geography]] in her 2008 paper, which addressed a variety of issues, including climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dowling|first=Robyn|title=Geographies of identity: climate change, governmentality and activism|journal=Progress in Human Geography|year=2010|issue=34|pages=488–495|doi=10.1177/0309132509348427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the French strand of [[psychoanalysis|Freudian psychology]], the ego ideal (or '''ideal ego''', {{lang-de|Ideal-Ich}}) has been defined as "an image of the perfect self towards which the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] should aspire."&lt;ref&gt;Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel, ''The Ego Ideal: A Psychoanalytic Essay on the Malady of the Ideal'', 1st American ed., trans.

==Freud and superego==

In Freud's "[[On Narcissism|On Narcissism: an Introduction]]" [1914], among other innovations — "most important of all perhaps — it introduces the concepts of the 'ego ideal' and of the self-observing agency related to it, which were the basis of what was ultimately to be described as the 'super-ego' in ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' (1923b)."&lt;ref&gt;Angela Richards, "Editor's Note", in Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Freud considered that the ego ideal was the heir to the [[narcissism]] of childhood: the "ideal ego is now the target of the [[self-love]] which was enjoyed in childhood by the actual ego&amp;nbsp;... is the substitute for the lost narcissism of his childhood."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The decade that followed would see the concept playing an ever more important and fruitful part in his thinking. In "Mourning and Melancholia" [1917], Freud stressed how "one part of the ego sets itself over against the other, judges it critically, and, as it were, takes it as its object."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, in ''[[Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego]]'' (1921), he examined further how "some such agency develops in our ego which may cut itself off from the rest of the ego and come into conflict with it. We have called it the 'ego ideal'...&amp;nbsp;heir to the original narcissism in which the childish ego enjoyed self-sufficiency."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Freud reiterated how "in many forms of love-choice&amp;nbsp;... the object serves as a substitute for some unattained ego ideal of our own," and further suggested that in group formation "the group ideal&amp;nbsp;... governs the ego in the place of the ego ideal."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'' p. 143 and p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

With "The Ego and the Id" [1923], however, Freud's nomenclature began to change. He still emphasised the importance of "the existence of a grade in the ego, a differentiation in the ego, which may be called the 'ego ideal' or 'super-ego',"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; but it was the latter term which now came to the forefront of his thinking. "Indeed, after ''The Ego and the Id'' and the two or three shorter works immediately following it, the 'ego ideal' disappears almost completely as a technical term"&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; for Freud. When it briefly reappears in the "New Introductory Lectures"[1933], it was as ''part'' of "this super-ego&amp;nbsp;... the vehicle of the ego ideal by which the ego measures itself&amp;nbsp;... precipitate of the old picture of the parents, the expression of admiration for the perfection which the child then attributed to them."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis''(PFL 2) p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stekel's ego-ideal===

[[Ernest Jones]] records that "I once asked Freud if he regarded an 'ego-ideal' as a universal attribute, and he replied with a puzzled expression: 'Do you think [[Wilhelm Stekel|Stekel]] has an ego-ideal?'."&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (Penguin 1964) p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further developments==

Freud's followers would continue to exploit the potential tension between the concepts of superego and ego ideal. "[[Hermann Nunberg]] defined the ideal ego as the combination of the ego and the id. This agency is the outcome of omnipotent narcissism and is manifested as pathology."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/ego-ideal-ideal-ego Sophie de Mijolla-Mellor "Ego Ideal/Ideal Ego"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Fenichel]], building on [[Sandor Rado]]'s "differentiation of the 'good' (i.e., protecting) and the 'bad' (i.e., punishing) aspects of the superego"&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; explored attempts to "distinguish ego ideals, the patterns of what one would like to be, from the superego, which is characterized as a threatening, prohibiting, and punishing power":&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; while acknowledging the linkages between the two agencies, he suggested for example that "in humor the overcathected superego is the friendly and protective ego-ideal; in depression, it is the negative, hostile, punishing conscience."&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;

==In narcissism==

[[Melanie Klein|Kleinians]] like [[Herbert Rosenfeld]] "re-invoked Freud's earlier emphasis on the importance of the ego ideal in narcissism, and conceived of a characteristic internal object — a chimerical montage or monster, one might say — that was constructed of the ego, the ego ideal, and the 'mad omnipotent self'."&lt;ref&gt;James S. Grotstein, "Foreword", Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 1993) p. xiii-xiv&lt;/ref&gt; In their wake, [[Otto Kernberg]] highlighted the destructive qualities of the "infantile, [[Grandiosity|grandiose]] ego ideal" - of "identification with an overidealized self- and object-representation, with the primitive form of ego-ideal."&lt;ref&gt;Otto Kernberg, ''Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism'' (London 1990) p. 239 and p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harold Bloom]] has since explored in a literary context how "in the narcissist, the ego-ideal becomes inflated and destructive, because it is filled with images of 'perfection and omnipotence'."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, ''Jay Gatsby'' (2004) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Escape from such "intense, excessive, and sometimes fatal devotion to the ego-ideal" — "to the narcissist, the only reality is the ego-ideal" — is only possible when one "gives up his corrupt ego-ideal and affirms the innocence of humility."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, ''Raskolnikov and Svidrigailov'' (2004) p. 120–1 and p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideal ego==

The ideal ego is a concept that has been particularly exploited in French psychoanalysis. Whereas Freud "seemed to use the terms indiscriminately&amp;nbsp;... ideal ego or ego ideal,"&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; in the thirties '[[Hermann Nunberg]], following Freud, had introduced a split into this concept, making the ''Ideal-Ich'' genetically prior to the ''surmoi'' (superego).&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (Oxford 1997) p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter [[Daniel Lagache]] developed the distinction, asserting with particular reference to adolescence that "the adolescent identifies him- or herself anew with the ideal ego and strives by this means to separate from the superego and the ego ideal."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/ego-ideal-ideal-ego Mijolla-Mellor]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] for his part explored the concept in terms of the subject's "narcissistic identification&amp;nbsp;... his ideal ego, that point at which he desires to gratify himself in himself."&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis'' (London 1994) p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; For Lacan, "the subject has to regulate the completion of what comes as&amp;nbsp;... ideal ego — which is not the ego ideal — that is to say, to constitute himself in his [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|imaginary]] reality."&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel]] (1985) identified various possible outcomes for the ego ideal, perverse as well as creative."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/ego-ideal Mijolla-Mellor]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Simulation projects intending to simulate [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]] have been undertaken for the past 20 years. All of these projects had failed as the simulation results showed central bulges which are huge compared to the disk size.&lt;ref name=msnbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=ibt/&gt;

==Simulation==
The simulation was undertaken using [[supercomputer]]s which include the [[Pleiades (supercomputer)|Pleiades supercomputer]], the [[Swiss National Supercomputing Centre]] and the supercomputers at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/09/hatching-the-milky-way.html|title=Hatching the Milky Way|publisher=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simulation used 1.4 million processor-hours of the Pleiades supercomputer.&lt;ref name=ibt/&gt;

It is based on the theory that in the early universe, cold and slow moving dark matter particles clumped together. These dark matter clumps then formed the "scaffolding" around galaxies and galactic clusters. The motions of more than 60 million particles which represented dark matter and galactic gas were simulated for a period of 13 billion years.&lt;ref name=universetoday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universetoday.com/88602/the-genesis-of-galaxy-eris/|title=The Genesis of Galaxy Eris…|publisher=[[Universe Today]]|accessdate=2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software platform ''Gasoline'' was used for the simulation.

==Simulation results==
The Eris simulation is the first successful simulation to have resolved the high-density gas clouds where stars formed.&lt;ref name=ibt/&gt; The simulation result consisted of a galaxy which is very similar to the [[Milky Way]] galaxy. Some of the parameters which were similar to Milky Way are stellar content, gas content, kinematic decomposition, brightness profile and the bulge-to-disk ratio.&lt;ref name=paper&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=742|issue=2|page=76|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/742/2/76|last1=Guedes|first1=Javiera|last2=Callegari|last3=Madau|first3=Piero|last4=Mayer|first4=Lucio|authorlink= |title=Forming Realistic Late-type Spirals in a CDM Universe: The Eris Simulation|class=|year=2011|arxiv = 1103.6030 |bibcode = 2011ApJ...742...76G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drawbacks==
The 60 million particles, which are used in the simulation, are not sufficient to simulate the 200 - 400 billion stars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/galaxy_worldbook.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050508093645/http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/galaxy_worldbook.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-05-08 |title=NASA – Galaxy |publisher=[[Nasa.gov]] |date=2007-11-29 |accessdate=2010-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dec16th2008 |url=http://www.universetoday.com/guide-to-space/milky-way/how-many-stars-are-in-the-milky-way/ |title=How Many Stars are in the Milky Way? |publisher=Universe Today |date= |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Milky Way.&lt;ref name=ibt/&gt;

'''''Ethnic Cleansing''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] video game for [[Microsoft Windows]] computers, created by the American [[White supremacy|White supremacist]] organization [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]]  (and published by its record label [[Resistance Records]]) on January 21, 2002. As part of a "[[Race war|Race War]]", the player controls a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] skinhead or a [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansman]] and is tasked with killing stereotypical [[African-American]], [[Mexican-American|Mexican]], and [[Jewish-American|Jewish]] enemies, ending with then-[[Israel]]i Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]].

Using the [[Genesis3D]] engine, the National Alliance created the game to be provocative and to support their white supremacist message. The game has been controversial, with the [[Anti-Defamation League]] taking particular issue; it has been ranked several times as one of the most controversial games ever created. It was planned to be followed by a long line of sequels, but only one, titled ''White Law'', has been released.

==Gameplay==
''Ethnic Cleansing'' is a standard, short-length [[first-person shooter]] set in a single [[Level (video gaming)|level]]. The player can select a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]], a [[White power skinhead|Skinhead]], or a [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansman]] to control. They run through a [[ghetto]] that has been compared to [[New York City]] and shoot [[African-American]]s and [[Mexican American|Mexican]]s, before descending into a subway system to kill [[Jewish-Americans|Jews]]. Finally, the player reaches the "[[Zionist Occupied Government|Yiddish Control Center]]", where a fictionalized version of [[Ariel Sharon]], then [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] of [[Israel]], is directing plans for world domination.&lt;ref name="pop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ugo"/&gt; He carries a [[rocket launcher]]; the player must kill him to complete the game.&lt;ref name="eurogamer"/&gt; The [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up]] display contains a map of nearby enemies and a counter of remaining ammunition.&lt;ref name="game"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Ethnic Cleansing|publisher=[[Resistance Records]]|developer=[[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]]|date=January 21, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's soundtrack consists of [[White power music#White power rock|white power rock music]]. The game's art assets and sound effects feature [[ethnic stereotype|racial stereotypes]]: when shot, black enemies make monkey noises and Jewish enemies are dressed as [[rabbi]]s and shout "[[oy vey]]!".&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; Mexican characters shout "I need to take a siesta now". In addition, black enemies are drawn to resemble apes&lt;ref name="stuff"/&gt; and some wear T-shirts with the lettering "[[Nigga|NIGZ]]",&lt;ref name="ugo"/&gt; while Mexican enemies wear [[sombrero]]s.&lt;ref name="stuff"/&gt;

''Ethnic Cleansing'' was developed by members of the [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]], an American [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] organization, and published by [[Resistance Records]], its subsidiary record label that specializes in [[white power music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openjurist.org/476/f3d/719/united-states-v-ross|publisher=OpenJurist|title=476 F. 3d 719 - United States v. Ross|date=February 8, 2007|accessdate=October 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813085004/http://openjurist.org/476/f3d/719/united-states-v-ross|archive-date=2014-08-13|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed for [[Microsoft Windows]] personal computers using Eclipse Entertainment's [[open-source software|open-source]] game engine [[Genesis3D]] along with the Reality Factory development kit. The source code was not substantially changed from the original. Instead, the developers simply plugged in images and sounds that they had created in freely available editing programs.&lt;ref name="promote hate"/&gt;

Shaun Walker, the chairman of the National Alliance, explained to the [[United Press]] that the intent was to produce a racially provocative video game and promote [[racial segregation]].&lt;ref name="eurogamer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibson|first=Ellie|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news180705racists|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|title=Racists launch PC game|date=July 18, 2005|accessdate=October 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026055233/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news180705racists|archive-date=2014-10-26|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Alliance founder [[William Luther Pierce]], who also appears in the game to discuss an "upcoming [[European Americans|white]] revolution", considered video games to be simply another medium to promote his organization's messages. Resistance released the game on [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]] (January 21) of 2002.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="promote hate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/assets/pdf/combating-hate/Racist-groups-use-computer-gaming.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|title=Racist Groups Use Computer Gaming to Promote Hate|accessdate=October 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105220545/http://www.adl.org/assets/pdf/combating-hate/Racist-groups-use-computer-gaming.pdf|archive-date=2013-11-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was priced at [[U.S. dollar|USD $]]14.88,&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; a reference to the white supremacist [[Fourteen Words]] slogan and the neo-Nazi numerical code "88" (which stands for "HH" or "Heil Hitler").

==Reception and controversy==
[[File:Ethnic Cleansing shot.png|thumb|left|275px|Here, the player shoots two African-American men. The game received backlash for its racist themes.]]
While it received little attention from the mainstream media, the game was immediately controversial among Americans on both sides of the political spectrum.&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208065556/http://www.popmatters.com/multimedia/features/040226-whitesupremacists.shtml|url=http://www.popmatters.com/multimedia/features/040226-whitesupremacists.shtml|last=Leonard|first=David|title=White Supremacist Games or Just More of the Same?|date=February 26, 2004|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|archivedate=December 8, 2009|accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]], an [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] organization that especially covers [[anti-Semitism]], publicized the existence of the game and unsuccessfully lobbied the developers of Genesis3D to change their licensing conditions to prohibit the use of the engine to develop racist games. They lobbied the [[Interactive Digital Software Association]] to encourage its members to adopt such policies.&lt;ref name="promote hate"/&gt;

The game's reception from critics was extremely negative. David Leonard of [[PopMatters]] described the game's graphics and "playability". While not approving of the game's message, he argued that it was only the latest in a long line of racist video games that included the likes of ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'', ''[[NFL Street]]'', and ''[[Freedom Fighters (video game)|Freedom Fighters]]''.&lt;ref name="pop"/&gt; In January 2003, ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]'' named ''Ethnic Cleansing'' the 40th most controversial video game of all time. The staff opined that only "very stupid children" would be susceptible to its message and that it would make players feel like "small-minded assholes".&lt;ref name="stuff"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/8043349/50-Most-Controversial-Games-Ever-Stuff-Magazine-200X|title=50 Most Controversial Games Ever|journal=[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]|date=January 2003|page=75|access-date=2017-09-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305160325/https://www.scribd.com/doc/8043349/50-Most-Controversial-Games-Ever-Stuff-Magazine-200X|archive-date=2016-03-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]''&lt;ref name="complex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/06/the-10-most-racist-video-games/|publisher=''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]''|title=The 10 Most Racist Video Games|accessdate=October 21, 2014|last=Hester|first=Larry|date=June 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021100656/http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/06/the-10-most-racist-video-games/|archive-date=2014-10-21|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[UGO]]'' ranked it as the single most racist video game in history. ''UGO'' staff writer K. Thor Jensen called it "profoundly stupid".&lt;ref name="ugo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/games/ethnic-cleansing|publisher=[[UGO]]|last=Jensen|first=K. Thor|title=The 11 Most Racist Video Games|date=November 30, 2010|accessdate=October 21, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128214108/http://www.ugo.com/games/ethnic-cleansing|archivedate=January 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierce estimated that "a couple thousand" copies of the game had been sold within a month of its release and that 90 percent of consumers had been white teenage boys.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;

==Sequel==
The National Alliance and Resistance Records released a similar game, ''White Law'', in June 2003. It starred an [[Irish-American]] police officer taking up arms to protect his territory from racial minorities. It has been compared to [[Freedom Fighters (video game)|''Freedom Fighters'']],&lt;ref name="pop"/&gt; though it was based on the events of Pierce's novel ''[[The Turner Diaries]]''. The National Alliance intended to create an entire line of racist games, but no more have surfaced.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2002/02/50523|last=Scheeres|first=Julia|title=Games Elevate Hate to Next Level|date=February 20, 2002|accessdate=October 21, 2014|publisher=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929044711/http://archive.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2002/02/50523|archive-date=2014-09-29|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adl.org/presrele/internet_75/4042_72.html#.VEX9gvldWSo|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|date=February 19, 2002|title=ADL Report: Growing Proliferation of Racist Video Games Target Youth on The Internet|accessdate=October 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817194717/http://archive.adl.org/presrele/internet_75/4042_72.html#.VEX9gvldWSo|archive-date=2014-08-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Conversation''' is the ongoing process of writers and thinkers referencing, building on, and refining the work of their predecessors. This process is characterized by writers in the [[Western canon]] making comparisons and allusions to the works of earlier writers. As such it is a name used in the promotion of the ''[[Great Books of the Western World]]'' published by [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]] in 1952. It is also the title of (i) the first volume of the first edition of this set of books,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/greatconversatio030336mbp|title=The Great Conversation Vol I|first=Robert M.|last=Hutchins|date=1 April 2018|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc.|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_great_conversation.html?id=gWANAQAAMAAJ|title=The great conversation: the substance of a liberal education|first=Robert Maynard|last=Hutchins|date=1 April 2018|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Robert Hutchins|Robert Maynard Hutchins]], and (ii) an accessory volume to the second edition (1990), written by [[Mortimer Adler]]. 

According to Hutchins, "The tradition of the West is embodied in the Great Conversation that began in the dawn of history and that continues to the present day".&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Conversation'', Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; Adler said, &lt;blockquote&gt;What binds the authors together in an intellectual community is the great conversation in which they are engaged. In the works that come later in the sequence of years, we find authors listening to what their predecessors have had to say about this idea or that, this topic or that. They not only harken to the thought of their predecessors, they also respond to it by commenting on it in a variety of ways.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer Adler: "The Great Conversation Revisited," in ''The Great Conversation: A Peoples Guide to Great Books of the Western World'', Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., Chicago, 1990, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Hysteria''' colloquially means ungovernable [[emotion]]al excess. Generally, modern medical professionals have abandoned using the term "hysteria" to denote a diagnostic category, replacing it with more precisely defined categories, such as [[somatization disorder]]. In 1980, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] officially changed the diagnosis of "hysterical neurosis, conversion type" to "[[conversion disorder]]".

While the word ''hysteria'' originates from the Greek word for [[uterus]], ''hystera'' (ὑστέρα), the word itself is not an ancient one, and the term "hysterical suffocation"  – meaning a feeling of heat and inability to breathe, was instead used in ancient Greek medicine. This suggests an entirely physical cause for the symptoms but, by linking them to the uterus, suggests that the disorder can only be found in women.&lt;ref name="gilman1993"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gilman|first1=Sander L.|last2=King|first2= Helen|last3=Porter|first3=Roy|last4=Rousseau|first4=G.S.|last5=Showalter|first5=Elaine|date=1993|title=Hysteria Beyond Freud|url=|location=Los Angeles|publisher=University of California Press|page=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historically, hysteria was thought to manifest itself in women ([[female hysteria]]) with a variety of symptoms, including: [[anxiety]], shortness of breath, [[fainting]], [[insomnia]], [[irritability]], nervousness, as well as sexually forward behaviour.&lt;ref name="maines"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The technology of Orgasm: ‘Hysteria’, the Vibrator, and Women’s Sexual Satisfaction|last=Maines|first=Rachel|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=Baltimore|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These symptoms mimic symptoms of other more definable diseases and create a case for arguing against the validity of hysteria as an actual disease, and it is often implied that it is an umbrella term for an indefinable illness.&lt;ref name="gilman1993" /&gt; Through to the 20th century, however, the label hysteria was applied to a mental, rather than uterine or physical, affliction. Hysteria is no longer thought of as a real ailment.&lt;ref name="carta"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Women and Hysteria In Mental Health|last2=Fadda|first2=Bianca|date=October 19, 2012|journal= Clin Pract Epidemiol Ment Health|last3=Rappeti|first3=Mariangela|last4=Tasca|first4=Cecilia|last1=Carta|first1=Mauro Giovanni|pmc=3480686|pmid=23115576|doi=10.2174/1745017901208010110|volume=8|pages=110–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern usage, the term ''hysteria'' connotes mass panic ([[mass hysteria]]). Hysteria was often associated with events such as the [[Salem witch trials]], or [[Slave rebellion|slave revolt]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The term ''hysterical'', applied to an individual, can mean that he or she is emotional or irrationally upset; applied to a situation that does not involve panic, it means that situation is uncontrollably amusing (the connotation being that it invokes hysterical laughter).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6659">In [[intuitionistic type theory]] (ITT), a discipline within [[mathematical logic]], '''induction-recursion''' is a feature for simultaneously declaring a type and function on that type.  It allows the creation of larger types, such as universes, than [[Intuitionistic type theory#Inductive types|inductive types]].  The types created still remain [[Predicativity|predicative]] inside ITT.

An [[inductive definition]] is given by rules for generating elements of a type. One can then define functions from that type by induction on the way the elements of the type are generated. Induction-recursion generalizes this situation since one can ''simultaneously'' define the type and the function, because the rules for generating elements of the type are allowed to refer to the function.&lt;ref name=Dybjer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dybjer|first=Peter|title=A general formulation of simultaneous inductive-recursive definitions in type theory|journal=Journal of Symbolic Logic|volume=65|issue=2|date=June 2000|pages=525–549|url=http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~peterd/papers/Inductive_Recursive.pdf|doi=10.2307/2586554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Induction-recursion can be used to define large types including various universe constructions. It increases the proof-theoretic strength of type theory substantially. Nevertheless, inductive-recursive recursive definitions are still considered [[Impredicativity|predicative]].

==Background==

Induction-Recursion came out of investigations to the rules of Martin-Löf's [[intuitionistic type theory]].  The type theory has a number of "type formers" and four kinds of rules for each one.  Martin-Löf had hinted that the rules for each type former followed a pattern, which preserved the properties of the type theory (e.g., [[Normalization property (abstract rewriting)|strong normalization]], [[Impredicativity|predicativity]]).  Researchers started looking for the most general description of the pattern, since that would tell what kinds of type formers could be added (or not added!) to extend the type theory.

The "universe" type former was the most interesting, because when the rules were written "à la  Tarski", they simultaneously defined the "universe type" ''and ''a function that operated on it.  This eventually lead Dybjer to Induction-Recursion.

Dybjer's initial papers called Induction-Recursion a "schema" for rules.  It stated what type formers could be added to the type theory.  Later, he and Setzer would write a new type former with rules that allowed new Induction-Recursion definitions to be made inside the type theory.&lt;ref name=DybjerSetzer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dybjer|first=Peter|title=A finite axiomatization of inductive-recursive definitions|journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=1581|year=1999|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.219.2442}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was added to the Half proof assistant (a variant of [[ALF (proof assistant)|Alf]]).

==The idea==

Before covering Inductive-Recursive types, the simpler case is Inductive Types.  Constructors for Inductive types can be self-referential, but in a limited way.  The constructor's parameters must be "positive":  
* not refer to the type being defined
* be exactly the type being defined, or
* be a function that returns the type being defined.

With Inductive types, a parameter's type can depend on earlier parameters, but they cannot refer to ones of the type being defined.  Inductive-Recursive types go further and parameter's types ''can'' refer to earlier parameters that use the type being defined.  These must be "half-positive":
* be a function depending on an earlier parameter '''if''' that parameter is wrapped in the function being defined.

So, if &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the type being defined and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the function being (simultaneously) defined, these parameter declarations are positive:
* &lt;math&gt;a:A&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;d:D&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;g:A \to Type&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;h:A \to D&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;i:A \to B \to D&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;j: g\ a&lt;/math&gt;  (Depends on earlier parameters, none of which are type &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;.)

This is half-positive:
* &lt;math&gt;k : (f\ d) \to D &lt;/math&gt;  (Depends on parameter &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; but only through call to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.)

These are '''not''' positive nor half-positive:
* &lt;math&gt;k: D \to A&lt;/math&gt;  (&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter to the function.)
* &lt;math&gt;l: (A \to D) \to A&lt;/math&gt;  (The parameter takes a function that returns &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, but returns &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; itself.)
* &lt;math&gt;m: z\ d&lt;/math&gt;  (Depends on &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, but not through the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.)

== Universe example ==

A simple common example is the Universe à la  Tarski type former.  It creates a type &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and a function &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.  There is an element of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; for every type in the type theory (except &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; itself!).  The function &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; maps the elements of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; to the associated type.

The type &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; has a constructor (or introduction rule) for each type former in the type theory.  The one for dependent functions would be:

&lt;math&gt;constructor_\Pi (u:U) (u' : (x: T(u)) U) : U&lt;/math&gt;

That is, it takes an element &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; that will map to the type of the parameter and an element &lt;math&gt;u'&lt;/math&gt; that will map to the return type of the function (which is dependent on the value of the parameter).  (The final &lt;math&gt;:U&lt;/math&gt; says that the result of the constructor is an element of type &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.)

The reduction (or computation rule) says that

&lt;math&gt;T(constructor_\Pi(u, u'))&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;\Pi( T(u), (x) T(u'(x)) )&lt;/math&gt;

After reduction, the function &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is operating on a smaller part of the input.  If that holds when &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is applied to any constructor, then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; will always terminate.  Without going into the details, Induction-Recursion states what kinds of definitions (or rules) can be added to the theory such that the function calls will always terminate.

==Usage==

Induction-Recursion is implemented in [[Agda (programming language)|Agda]] and [[Idris (programming language)|Idris]].

'''Joseph "Holy Joe" Wingate Folk''' (October 28, 1869 – May 28, 1923) was an American lawyer, reformer, and politician from [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. He was [[Governor of Missouri]] from 1905 to 1909.

==Early life and education==
Joseph Folk was born in [[Brownsville, Tennessee]] to Henry Bate and Martha Estes Folk and raised in a strict [[Baptist]] household. His early education was completed at Brownsville Academy, after which he worked for several companies in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] as a clerk and bookkeeper. Folk studied law and graduated from [[Vanderbilt University]] in 1890. He joined his father's law firm and focused on criminal law.&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;{{cite book|last=Piott|first=Steven L.|title=Dictionary of Missouri Biography|year=1999|publisher=University of Missouri Press|location=Columbia, MO|isbn=0-8262-1222-0|pages=307–310|editor=Lawrence O. Christensen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his career, Folk ran for a seat in the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]] in 1892, wrote newspaper articles, spoke on special occasions, and joined the [[Knights of Pythias]]. In 1893, he moved to St. Louis to join his uncle's law practice. Folk married Gertrude Glass on November 10, 1896. He helped to organize the Jefferson Club, a local young Democrats' organization, and acted as the group's president in 1898–1899.&lt;ref name=Dictionary /&gt;

==St. Louis career==
Folk made his reputation as a lawyer for transit workers in the [[St. Louis Streetcar Strike of 1900]]. His work as mediator earned him a Democratic nomination for circuit attorney in 1900, and he won the election against Judge Eugene Mcquillen.

Folk earned his nickname by attacking local corruption and party machines. With the assistance of [[Lincoln Steffens]]'s articles published in ''[[McClure's]]'' magazine, Folk led investigations of the city's Democratic boss, Col. [[Edward Butler (American politician)|Ed Butler]] and the corrupt "boodle ring" of corporate bribery in the state and municipal government.&lt;ref&gt;D. K. Goodwin, The Bully Pulpit (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2013) pp. 370–378&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of the convictions Folk obtained were overturned on appeal, his work had national and international consequences. Folk gained the respect of Republican President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] as he and other crusading prosecutors and [[muckraking]] journalists brought national attention to municipal corruption. Folk's prosecution of the Suburban Railway Company stimulated a change in US treaties with [[Mexico]] to include bribery as grounds for extradition. As district attorney, Folk encountered opposition from many businessmen and politicians, who believed that his exposing corrupt practices hurt the city's reputation, and thus the Democratic party as well as the business climate.&lt;ref name=Dictionary /&gt;

==Governor==
Folk was elected the [[List of Governors of Missouri|31st Governor of Missouri]] as a progressive reformer and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in the [[Missouri gubernatorial election, 1904|1904 election]]. In the governor's office, he advocated the "Missouri Idea", the concept of Missouri as a leader in public morality through popular control of law and strict enforcement. His administration found initial success despite opposition and successfully conducted antitrust prosecutions, ended gratis railroad passes for state officials, extended bribery statues, improved election laws, required formal registration for lobbyists, made racetrack gambling illegal, and enforced the Sunday-closing law. The latter half of Folk's gubernatorial term found a Democratically controlled General Assembly, in large part due to Folk's reforms. The governor was able to enact further legislation, including an initiative and referendum amendment to the [[Constitution of Missouri]], and further regulation of elections, education, employment and child labor, railroads, food, business, and public utilities. A number of examiner boards and commissions were established during Folk's administration, including many agricultural boards and the Missouri library commission.&lt;ref name=Dictionary /&gt;

==Later career==
Following his gubernatorial term, Folk's focus on morality and unwillingness to compromise eventually made him politically unpopular, and his initial attempts for a senate nomination were unsuccessful. He returned to law practice, toured as a [[Chautauqua]] speaker, and campaigned for [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Wilson appointed Folk as a solicitor for the [[US State Department]], where he investigated major railroad companies. In 1918, he was able to win a Democratic nomination for the [[US Senate]], but lost in the election. After a brief stint at the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce, Folk opened a private law office in [[Washington, D.C.]] He arbitrated in several international negotiations.&lt;ref name=Dictionary /&gt;

Folk experienced a nervous breakdown in March 1922, believed to be from overwork.&lt;ref name=Dictionary /&gt; He died aged 54 in 1923 in [[New York City]], and is buried at the Oakwood Cemetery in [[Brownsville, Tennessee]].

His Washington D.C. residence is now the [[Embassy of Mauritania in Washington, D.C.|Embassy of Mauritania]].  A 1943 [[Liberty ship]] was named in his honor.

'''Justice''' is one of the four [[cardinal virtues]] in classical European philosophy and Roman Catholicism. It is the moderation or mean between [[selfishness]] and [[Altruism|selflessness]] – between having more and having less than one's fair share.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice is closely related, in Christianity, to the practice of [[Charity (virtue)]] because it regulates the relationships with others.  It is a cardinal virtue, which is to say that it is "pivotal", because it regulates all such relationships, and is sometimes deemed the most important of the cardinal virtues.

==Early developments==
According to Aristotle, "Justice consists in a certain equality by which the just and definite claim of another, neither more nor less, is satisfied."&lt;ref name=Slater/&gt;

This is equal insofar as each one receives what he is entitled to, but may be unequal insofar as different people may have different rights:  two children have different rights from a certain adult if that adult is the parent of one of them and not of the other. Aristotle developed the idea of [[Equity (law)|equity]] to cover irregular cases so that "the ordinance is framed to fit the circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, p. 198-200&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Macrobius]] saw Justice as existing on four different planes or levels, rising from the everyday political virtue at the lowest to the Archetypal Form of Justice at the highest.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. S. Lewis]], ''The Discarded Image'' (1976) p. 68-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
The just man, often mentioned in the Sacred Scriptures, is distinguished by habitual right thinking and the uprightness of his conduct toward his neighbor.&lt;ref name=ccc1807&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a7.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church, §1807]&lt;/ref&gt; In Colossians 4:1 St. Paul counsels "Masters, treat your slaves justly and fairly, realizing that you too have a Master in heaven." 
 
In Christian moral theology, Justice is a quality or habit which perfects the will and inclines it to render to each and to all what belongs to them. The object of the virtue of justice is the other person's rights, whether natural or bestowed by Church or State. Justice requires that all persons should be left in the free enjoyment of all their rights. The rights which belong to every human being inasmuch as he is a person are absolute and inalienable.&lt;ref name=Slater&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm Slater, Thomas. "Justice." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 7 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Aristotle]]'s wake,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, p. 182-3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]] developed a theory of proportional reciprocity, whereby the just man renders to each and all what is due to them in due proportion: what it is their [[moral rights|moral]] and [[legal rights|legal]] rights to do, possess, or exact.&lt;ref&gt;D. Manuel Jr, ''Contemporary Social Philosophy'' (nd) p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Justice toward God is called the "[[Religion (virtue)|virtue of religion]]".&lt;ref name=ccc1807/&gt;

==Modern developments==
With the [[Late modernity|late modern]] rise in interest in [[virtue ethics]], a new interest in articulating the virtue of justice has emerged. [[John Rawls]] saw justice as the typical virtue of the institution; [[Irene van Staveren]] saw it as that of the state, marked by such indicators as votes, legitimacy, public fairness and distributive rules.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deidre McCloskey]], ''The Bourgeois Virtues'' (2007) p. 286 and p. 431&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
Moral justice has been linked to the sixth and highest of [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development]].&lt;ref&gt;L. P. Nucci, ''Handbook of Moral and Character Education'' (2008) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freud]]ians consider that in the unconscious the image of the Father embodies a stern but fair justice;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychooanalysis'' (1976) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jung]]ians similarly see the [[archetype]] of the King as representing the right ordering of society.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bly/M. Woodman, ''The Maiden King'' (1999) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
[[Dante]] made Justice the virtue of his sixth heaven (the sphere of Jupiter), and illustrated it through such martial figures as [[Joshua]] and [[Roland]].&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Paradise'' (1975) p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Philip Sydney]] wrote of "justice the chief of virtues";&lt;ref&gt;Sidney, ''A Defence of Poetry'' (1984) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Spenser]] devoted the fifth book of ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' to the same theme.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (1971) p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wallace Stevens]] rejected what he called "galled Justicia/Trained to poise the tables of the law" as part of the obsolete images of the past, and favoured instead the [[modernist]] seeking out of new ruling images – new "sovereigns of the soul".&lt;ref&gt;Wallace Stevens, ''Collected Poems'' (1984) p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Technical|date=October 2018}}

In [[mathematical psychology]], a '''knowledge space''' is a [[antimatroid|combinatorial structure]] describing the possible states of knowledge of a human learner.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Knowledge Spaces|last1=Doignon|first1=J.-P.|last2=Falmagne|first2=J.-Cl.|author2-link=Jean-Claude Falmagne|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1999|isbn = 3-540-64501-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
To form a knowledge space, one models a domain of knowledge as a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of concepts, and a feasible state of knowledge as a [[subset]] of that set containing the concepts known or knowable by some individual. Typically, not all subsets are feasible, due to prerequisite relations among the concepts. The knowledge space is the family of all the feasible subsets. 

Knowledge spaces were introduced in 1985 by [[Jean-Paul Doignon]] and [[Jean-Claude Falmagne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Doignon|first1=J.-P.|last2=Falmagne|first2=J.-Cl.|author2-link=Jean-Claude Falmagne|year=1985|title=Spaces for the assessment of knowledge|journal=International Journal of Man-Machine Studies|volume=23|issue=2|pages=175–196|doi=10.1016/S0020-7373(85)80031-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and have since been studied by many other researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Knowledge Spaces. Applications in Education|last1=Falmagne|first1=J.-Cl.|author1-link=Jean-Claude Falmagne|last2=Albert|first2=D.|last3=Doble|first3=C.|last4=Eppstein|first4=D.|author4-link=David Eppstein|last5=Hu|first5=X.|publisher=Springer|year=2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A [http://kst.hockemeyer.at/kst-bib.html bibliography on knowledge spaces] maintained by Cord Hockemeyer contains over 400 publications on the subject.&lt;/ref&gt; They also form the basis for two computerized tutoring systems, [http://wundt.kfunigraz.ac.at/rath/ RATH] (defunct now) and [[ALEKS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wundt.uni-graz.at/MathPsych/cda/overview_sokrates.htm Introduction to Knowledge Spaces: Theory and Applications], Christof Körner, Gudrun Wesiak, and Cord Hockemeyer, 1999 and 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to interpret a knowledge space as a special form of a restricted [[latent class model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=About the connection between knowledge structures and latent class models |last1=Schrepp |first1=M. |journal=Methodology|volume=1|issue=3|pages=92–102|year=2005|doi=10.1027/1614-2241.1.3.92}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Knowledge Space Theory (KST) was motivated by the shortcomings of the psychometric approach to the assessment of competence like [[SAT]] and [[ACT (test)|ACT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jean-Paul Doignon, Jean-Claude Falmagne |title=Knowledge Spaces and Learning Spaces |date=2015 |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06757.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was developed with an objective of designing automated procedures which - 
*accurately assess the knowledge of a student, and 
*efficiently provide advices for further study. 
Assessments based on KST are adaptive and can account for possible slips or guesses. KST aims to give a detailed assessment of student's knowledge state as opposed to a numerical mark in traditional assessments. More specifically, the result of a KST based assessment tells two things - 
*''What the student can do'' and 
*''What the student is ready to learn''.

==Basic Concepts==
*'''Knowledge State'''
:It is the complete set of problems that an individual is capable of solving in a particular topic (such as Algebra).
*'''Precedence Relation'''
:It is the parent-child relationship between concepts. It captures the inter-dependency of concepts (prerequisite relationships).
*'''Knowledge Structure'''
:It is the set of all ''feasible'' knowledge states. Because of precedence relations some of the knowledge states are infeasible.
*'''The outer and inner fringes'''
:The unique items between a knowledge state and its immediate successor knowledge state is called the original knowledge state's Outer fringe. It basically tells the items that the student is ready to learn. Conversely, Inner fringe is the items that differentiate a knowledge state from its immediate predecessor. Inner fringe tells the items that the student has already learned.

==Definitions==
Some basic definitions used in the knowledge space approach -
*A tuple &lt;math&gt;(Q, K)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of a non-empty set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and a set &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; of subsets from &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''knowledge structure'' if &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; contains the empty set and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.
*A knowledge structure is called a ''knowledge space'' if it is closed under union, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\cup F \in K&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;F \subseteq K &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ru/books?hl=ru&amp;lr=&amp;id=q4NWzFqSIvcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=learning+spaces+interdisciplinary+applied+math&amp;ots=kxmWmfjrpN&amp;sig=-40PagY8DQbKwxQGp04kqx72yPU&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=learning%20spaces%20interdisciplinary%20applied%20math&amp;f=false|title=Learning Spaces: Interdisciplinary Applied Mathematics|last=Falmagne|first=Jean-Claude|last2=Doignon|first2=Jean-Paul|date=2010-09-10|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783642010392|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A knowledge space is called a ''quasi-ordinal knowledge space'' if it is in addition closed under intersection, i.e. if &lt;math&gt;S, T \in K&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;S\cap T \in K&lt;/math&gt;. Closure under both unions and intersections gives (''Q'',∪,∩) the structure of a [[distributive lattice]]; [[Birkhoff's representation theorem]] for distributive lattices shows that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all [[preorder|quasiorders]] on Q and the set of all quasi-ordinal knowledge spaces on Q. I.e., each quasi-ordinal knowledge space can be represented by a quasi-order and vice versa.

An important subclass of knowledge spaces, the ''well-graded knowledge spaces'' or ''learning spaces'', can be defined as satisfying two additional mathematical axioms:
# If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; are both feasible subsets of concepts, then &lt;math&gt;S\cup T&lt;/math&gt; is also feasible. In educational terms: if it is possible for someone to know all the concepts in ''S'', and someone else to know all the concepts in ''T'', then we can posit the potential existence of a third person who combines the knowledge of both people.
# If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a nonempty feasible subset of concepts, then there is some concept ''x'' in ''S'' such that &lt;math&gt;S\setminus\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; is also feasible. In educational terms: any feasible state of knowledge can be reached by learning one concept at a time, for a finite set of concepts to be learned.
A set family satisfying these two axioms forms a [[mathematical structure]] known as an [[antimatroid]].

==Construction of knowledge spaces==
In practice, there exist several methods to construct knowledge spaces. The most frequently used method is querying experts. There exist several querying algorithms that allow one or several experts to construct a knowledge space by answering a sequence of simple questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Extracting human expertise for constructing knowledge spaces: An algorithm |last1=Koppen |first1=M. |journal=Journal of Mathematical Psychology|volume=37|pages=1–20 |year=1993 |doi=10.1006/jmps.1993.1001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=How to build a knowledge space by querying an expert |last1=Koppen |first1=M. |last2=Doignon |first2=J.-P. |journal=Journal of Mathematical Psychology|volume=34|issue=3|pages=311–331 |year=1990 |doi=10.1016/0022-2496(90)90035-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A simulation study concerning the effect of errors on the establishment of knowledge spaces by querying experts |last1=Schrepp |first1=M. |last2=Held |first2=T. |journal=Journal of Mathematical Psychology|volume=39|issue=4|pages=376–382 |year=1995|doi=10.1006/jmps.1995.1035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method is to construct the knowledge space by explorative data analysis (for example by [[Item tree analysis]]) from data.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Extracting knowledge structures from observed data |last1=Schrepp |first1=M. |journal=[[British journal of mathematical and statistical psychology]]|volume= 52|issue=2 |pages=213–224 |year=1999|doi=10.1348/000711099159071}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A method for the analysis of hierarchical dependencies between items of a questionnaire |last1=Schrepp |first1=M. |journal= Methods of Psychological Research Online|volume=19|pages=43–79  |year=2003|url=http://www.dgps.de/fachgruppen/methoden/mpr-online/issue19/art3/mpr106_04.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A third method is to derive the knowledge space from an analysis of the problem solving processes in the corresponding domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Knowledge Spaces: Theories, Empirical Research, Applications|last1=Albert|first1=D.|last2=Lukas|first2=J.|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, NJ|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Daniel McNaughton c 1856.jpg|thumb|Daniel M'Naghten ''circa'' 1856]]
The '''M'Naghten rule''' (pronounced, and sometimes spelled, '''McNaughton''') is any variant of the 1840s jury instruction in a [[criminal case]] when there is a [[defense of insanity]]: 
{{blockquote|that every man is to be presumed to be sane, and{{nbsp}}... that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;''Criminal Law - Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], [[Guyora Binder]], {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|632}} }}

The rule was formulated as a reaction to the acquittal in 1843 of [[Daniel M'Naghten]] on the charge of murdering [[Edward Drummond]], whom M'Naghten had mistaken for [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Robert Peel]].&lt;ref&gt;''M’Naghten’s Case'' [1843] All ER Rep 229&lt;/ref&gt; M'Naghten fired a pistol at the back of Peel's secretary, Edward Drummond, who died five days later. The [[House of Lords]] asked a panel of judges, presided over by [[Nicolas Conyngham Tindal|Sir Nicolas Conyngham Tindal]], [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]], a series of hypothetical questions about the defence of insanity. The principles expounded by this panel have come to be known as the ''M'Naghten Rules'', though they have gained any status only by usage in the common law and M'Naghten himself would have been found guilty if they had been applied at his trial.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Elliott, ''The rules of insanity: moral responsibility and the mentally ill offender'', SUNY Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-7914-2951-2}}, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael T. Molan, Mike Molan, Duncan Bloy, Denis Lanser, ''Modern criminal law'' (5 ed), Routledge Cavendish, 2003, {{ISBN|1-85941-807-4}}, p.352&lt;/ref&gt;  

The rules so formulated as ''M'Naghten's Case'' 1843 10 C &amp; F 200&lt;ref name="m'naghtenscase"&gt;{{cite web|last=United Kingdom House of Lords Decisions|title=DANIEL M'NAGHTEN'S CASE. May 26, June 19, 1843.|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1843/J16.html|publisher=British and Irish Legal Information Institute|accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been a standard test for criminal liability in relation to mentally disordered defendants in [[common law]] jurisdictions ever since, with some minor adjustments. When the tests set out by the Rules are satisfied, the accused may be adjudged "not guilty by reason of insanity" or "guilty but insane" and the [[sentence (law)|sentence]] may be a mandatory or discretionary (but usually indeterminate) period of treatment in a secure hospital facility, or otherwise at the discretion of the [[court]] (depending on the country and the offence charged) instead of a punitive disposal.

The insanity defence is recognized in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[England and Wales]], [[Hong Kong]], [[India]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]] and most [[U.S. state]]s with the exception of Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Utah, and Vermont&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.vt.us/statutes/fullsection.cfm?Title=13&amp;Chapter=157&amp;Section=04802|title=Vermont Statutes Online|website=www.leg.state.vt.us|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not all of these jurisdictions still use the M'Naghten Rules.

==Historical development==
There are various justifications for the exemption of the insane from criminal responsibility. When mental incapacity is successfully raised as a [[defense (legal)|defence]] in a criminal trial it absolves a defendant from liability: it applies [[public policy (law)|public policies]] in relation to criminal responsibility by applying a rationale of [[compassion]], accepting that it is [[morality|morally]] wrong to punish a person if that person is deprived permanently or temporarily of the capacity to form a necessary mental intent that the definition of a crime requires. Punishment of the obviously mentally ill by the state may undermine public confidence in the penal system. A [[utilitarian]] and [[humanitarian]] approach suggests that the interests of society are better served by treatment of the illness rather than punishment of the individual.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Historically, insanity was seen as grounds for leniency. In pre-Norman times in England there was no distinct criminal code&amp;nbsp;– a murderer could [[Weregild|pay compensation to the victim's family]] under the principle of "buy off the spear or bear it". The insane person's family were expected to pay any compensation and look after. In Norman times insanity was not seen as a defence in itself but a special circumstance in which the jury would deliver a guilty verdict and refer the defendant to the King for a pardon&lt;ref&gt;Walker, N. (1968). Crime and Insanity in England:The Historical Perspective. vol.1, Edinburgh University Press; Stephen, History of Criminal Law, 151; 2 Pollock &amp; Maitland, History of English Law, 480&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|eo quod sensu carent et ratione, non magis quam brutum animal iniuriam facere possunt nec feloniam, cum non multum distent a brutis, secundum quod videri poterit in minore, qui si alium interficeret in minori ætate, iudicium non sustineret.

[Translation:] since they are without sense and reason and can no more commit a tort or a felony than a brute animal, since they are not far removed from brutes, as is evident in the case of a minor, for if he should kill another while under age he would not suffer judgment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120710153335/http://hlsl5.law.harvard.edu/bracton/ Bracton, ''On the Laws and Customs of England'' II.424.24–27 (1210)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''R v Arnold'' 1724 16 How St. Tr. 765, the test for insanity was expressed in the following terms
&lt;blockquote&gt;
whether the accused is totally deprived of his understanding and memory and knew what he was doing "no more than a wild beast or a brute, or an infant".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The next major advance occurred in ''[[James Hadfield|Hadfield's Trial]]'' 1800 27 How St. Tr. 765 in which the court decided that a crime committed under some delusion would be excused only if it would have been excusable had the delusion been true. This would deal with the situation, for example, when the accused imagines he is cutting through a loaf of bread, whereas in fact he is cutting through a person's neck.

Each jurisdiction may have its own standards of the insanity defense. More than one standard can be applied to any case based on multiple jurisdictions.

==The M'Naghten Rules==
The [[House of Lords]] delivered the following exposition of the Rules:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:the jurors ought to be told in all cases that every man is to be presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction; and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.&lt;ref name="m'naghtenscase" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The central issue of this definition may be stated as "did the defendant know what they were doing, or, if so, that it was wrong?", and the issues raised have been analysed in subsequent appellate decisions:

===Presumption of sanity and burden of proof===
Sanity is a [[rebuttable presumption]] and the burden of proof is on the party denying it; the standard of proof is on a balance of probabilities, that is to say that mental incapacity is more likely than not. If this burden is successfully discharged, the party relying upon it is entitled to succeed. In Lord Denning's judgement in ''[[Bratty v Attorney-General for Northern Ireland]]'' 1963 AC 386, whenever the defendant makes an issue of his state of mind, the prosecution can adduce evidence of insanity. However, this will normally only arise to negate the defence case when [[automatism (law)|automatism]] or [[diminished responsibility]] is in issue. In practical terms, the defence will be more likely to raise the issue of mental incapacity to negate or minimise criminal liability. In ''R v Clarke'' 1972 1 All E R 219 a defendant charged with a [[shoplifting]] claimed she had no ''[[mens rea]]'' because she had absent-mindedly walked out of the shop without paying because she suffered from [[Clinical depression|depression]]. When the prosecution attempted to adduce evidence that this constituted insanity within the Rules, she changed her plea to guilty, but on appeal the Court ruled that she had been merely denying [[mens rea]] rather than raising a defence under the Rules and her conviction was quashed. The general rule was stated that the Rules apply only to cases in which the defect of reason is substantial.

===Disease of the mind===
Whether a particular condition amounts to a disease of the mind within the Rules is not a medical but a legal question to be decided in accordance with the ordinary rules of interpretation. It seems that any disease which produces a malfunctioning of the mind is a disease of the mind and need not be a disease of the brain itself. The term has been held to cover numerous conditions:
{{unordered list
| In ''R v Kemp'' [1957] 1 QB 399 [[arteriosclerosis]] or a hardening of the arteries caused loss of control during which the defendant attacked his wife with a hammer. This was an internal condition and a disease of the mind.
| In ''[[R v Sullivan]]'' [1984] AC 156 during an [[epilepsy|epileptic]] episode, the defendant caused [[grievous bodily harm]]: epilepsy was an internal condition and a disease of the mind, and the fact that the state was transitory was irrelevant.
| In ''R v Quick; R v Paddison'' [1973] QB 910&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1973/1.html BAILII]&lt;/ref&gt; committed an assault while in a state of [[hypoglycaemia]] caused by the insulin he had taken, the alcohol he had consumed and not eating properly. It was ruled that the judge should have left the defence of automatism open to him, so his conviction was quashed (he had pleaded guilty rather than not guilty by reason of insanity). This was where the internal/external divide doctrine was first expressed, probably due to judicial reluctance to hospitalise someone for a condition that could be cured by a sugar lump. It is doubtful that a jury would have accepted a defence of automatism, but nonetheless the issue should have been left to them.
| In ''R v Hennessy'' [1989] 1 WLR 287&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/1989/1.html BAILII]&lt;/ref&gt; a diabetic stole a car and drove it while suffering from a mild attack of [[hyperglycaemia]] caused by stress and a failure to take his insulin. [[Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane|Lane LCJ]] said at 294
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:In our judgment, stress, anxiety and depression can no doubt be the result of the operation of external factors, but they are not, it seems to us, in themselves separately or together external factors of the kind capable in law of causing or contributing to a state of automatism. They constitute a state of mind which is prone to recur. They lack the feature of novelty or accident, which is the basis of the distinction drawn by [[Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock|Lord Diplock]] in ''R v Sullivan'' 1984 AC 156, 172. It is contrary to the observations of Devlin J., to which we have just referred in ''Hill v Baxter'' (1958) 1 QB 277, 285. It does not, in our judgment, come within the scope of the exception of some external physical factor such as a blow on the head or the administration of an anaesthetic.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
| In ''Bratty v Attorney-General for Northern Ireland'' [1963] AC 386&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1961/3.html BAILII]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Denning]] observed ''[[obiter dicta|obiter]]'' that a crime committed while sleepwalking would appear to him to be one committed as an automaton. However, the ruling in ''R v Sullivan'' that diseases of the mind need have no permanence led many academics to suggest that sleepwalkers might well be found to be suffering from a disease of the mind with internal causes unless there was clear evidence of an external causal factor.
| In ''[[R v Burgess]]''[1991] 2 QB 92 the Court of Appeal ruled that the defendant, who wounded a woman by hitting her with a video recorder while sleepwalking, was insane under the M'Naghten Rules. Lord Lane said, "We accept that sleep is a normal condition, but the evidence in the instant case indicates that sleepwalking, and particularly violence in sleep, is not normal."
}}

The courts have clearly drawn a distinction between internal and external factors affecting a defendant's mental condition. This is partly based on risk of recurrence, whereby the High Court of Australia has expressed that the defence of automatism is unable considered when the mental disorder has been proved transient and as such not likely to recur.&lt;ref&gt;R v Falconer (1990) 171 CLR 30 at 30 [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1990/49.html AUSTLII]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the distinction between insanity and automatism is difficult because the distinction between internal and external divide is difficult. Many diseases consist of a predisposition, considered an internal cause, combined with a precipitant, which would be considered an external cause. Actions committed while sleepwalking would normally be considered as "non-insane automatism", but often alcohol and stress trigger bouts of sleepwalking and make them more likely to be violent. The diabetic who takes insulin but does not eat properly&amp;nbsp;– is that an internal or external cause?

===Nature and quality of the act===
This phrase refers to the physical nature and quality of the act, rather than the moral quality. It covers the situation where the defendant does not know what he is physically doing. Two common examples used are:
* The defendant cuts a woman's throat under the delusion that he is cutting a loaf of bread,
* The defendant chops off a sleeping man's head because he has the deluded idea that it would be great fun to see the man looking for it when he wakes up.
The judges were specifically asked if a person could be excused if he committed an offence in consequence of an insane delusion. They replied that if he labours under such partial delusion only, and is not in other respects insane, "he must be considered in the same situation as to responsibility as if the facts with respect to which the delusion exists were real". This rule requires the court to take the facts as the accused believed them to be and follows ''Hadfield's Trial'', above. If the delusions do not prevent the defendant from having mens rea there will be no defence. In ''R v Bell'' 1984 Crim. LR 685 the defendant smashed a van through the entrance gates of a holiday camp because "It was like a secret society in there, I wanted to do my bit against it" as instructed by God. It was held that, as the defendant had been aware of his actions, he could neither have been in a state of automatism nor insane, and the fact that he believed that God had told him to do this merely provided an explanation of his motive and did not prevent him from knowing that what he was doing was wrong in the legal sense.

===Knowledge that the act was wrong===
The interpretation of this clause is a subject of controversy among legal authorities, and different standards may apply in different jurisdictions.

"Wrong" was interpreted to mean ''legally'' wrong, rather than ''morally'' wrong, in the case of ''Windle'' 1952 2QB 826; 1952 2 All ER 1 246, where the defendant killed his wife with an overdose of [[aspirin]]; he telephoned the police and said, "I suppose they will hang me for this." It was held that this was sufficient to show that although the defendant was suffering from a mental illness, he was aware that his act was wrong, and the defense was not allowed. Under this interpretation, there may be cases where the mentally ill know that their conduct is legally prohibited, but it is arguable that their mental condition prevents them making the connection between an act being legally prohibited and the societal requirement to conform their conduct to the requirements of the criminal law.

As an example of a contrasting interpretation in which defendant lacking knowledge that the act was ''morally'' wrong meets the M'Naghten standards, there are the instructions the judge is required to provide to the jury in cases in New York State when the defendant has raised an insanity plea as a defense:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... with respect to the term "wrong", a person lacks substantial capacity to know or appreciate that conduct is wrong if that person, as a result of mental disease or defect, lacked substantial capacity to know or appreciate either that the conduct was against the law or that it was against commonly held moral principles, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CJI2d[NY] INSTRUCTIONS OF GENERAL APPLICABILITY
|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/judges/cji/1-General/cjigc.shtml|publisher=New York State Unified Court System|accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jury Instructions for trying plea of "INSANITY (LACK OF CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY BY REASON OF MENTAL DISEASE OR DEFECT) Penal Law S.40.15"|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/judges/cji/1-General/Defenses/CJI2d.Insanity.pdf|publisher=New York State Unified Court System|accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is other support in the authorities for this interpretation of the standards enunciated in the findings presented to the House of Lords regarding M'Naghten's case:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If it be accepted, as can hardly be denied, that the answers of the judges to the questions asked by the House of Lords in 1843 are to be read in the light of the then existing case-law and not as novel pronouncements of a legislative character, then the [Australian] High Court's analysis in ''Stapleton's Case'' is compelling.  Their exhaustive examination of the extensive case-law concerning the defense of insanity prior to and at the time of the trial of M'Naughten establishes convincingly that it was morality and not legality which lay as a concept behind the judges' use of "wrong" in the M'Naghten rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Norval|title='WRONG' IN THE M'NAUGHTEN RULES|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2230.1953.tb02133.x/abstract|publisher=Modern Law Review|accessdate=2012-08-05|date=October 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Offences of strict liability===
In ''DPP v Harper'' (1997) it was held that insanity is not generally a defense to [[strict liability]] offences. In this instance, the accused was driving with excess alcohol. By definition, the accused is sufficiently aware of the nature of the activity to commit the ''actus reus'' of driving and presumably knows that driving while drunk is legally wrong. Any other feature of the accused's knowledge is irrelevant.

===The function of the jury===
Section 1 of the [[Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991]] provides that a jury shall not return a special verdict that "the accused is not guilty by reason of insanity" except on the written or oral evidence of two or more registered medical practitioners of whom at least one has special experience in the field of mental disorder. This may require the jury to decide between conflicting medical evidence which they are not necessarily equipped to do, but the law goes further and allows them to disagree with the experts if there are facts or surrounding circumstances which, in the opinion of the court, justify the jury in coming to that conclusion.

===Sentencing===
Under section 3 of the Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991:
# Where the sentence for the offence to which the finding relates is fixed by law (e.g. [[murder]]), the court must make a hospital order restricting discharge without limitation of time. Otherwise, if there is adequate medical evidence and the defendant has been convicted of an imprisonable offence, a hospital order requires that the defendant be admitted to and detained in a hospital for treatment for a mental disorder (see sections 37–43 of the [[Mental Health Act 1983]]).
# In any other case the court may make:
#* a hospital order and an order restricting discharge either for a limited or unlimited period of time;
#* or in appropriate circumstances,
#** a guardianship order;
#** a supervision and treatment order; or
#** an order for absolute discharge.

===Criticisms===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2009}}
There have been four major criticisms of the law as it currently stands:
* '''Medical irrelevance''' - The legal definition of insanity has not advanced significantly since 1843; in 1953 evidence was given to the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment that doctors even then regarded the legal definition to be obsolete and misleading. This distinction has led to absurdities such as
** even though a legal definition suffices, mandatory hospitalisation can be ordered in cases of murder; if the defendant is not ''medically'' insane, there is little point in requiring medical treatment.
** [[diabetes]] has been held to facilitate a defence of insanity when it causes [[hyperglycemia]], but not when it causes [[hypoglycemia]].
** Article 5 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], imported into English law by the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], provides that a person of unsound mind may be detained only where proper account of objective medical expertise has been taken. As yet, no cases have occurred in which this point has been argued.
* '''Ineffectiveness''' - The rules currently do not distinguish between defendants who represent a public danger and those who do not. Illnesses such as diabetes and epilepsy can be controlled by medication such that sufferers are less likely to have temporary aberrations of mental capacity, but the law does not recognise this.
* '''Sentencing for murder''' - A finding of insanity may well result in indefinite confinement in a hospital, whereas a conviction for murder may well result in a determinate sentence of between ten and 15 years; faced with this choice, it may be that defendants would prefer the certainty of the latter option. The defence of diminished responsibility in section 2(1) of the Homicide Act would reduce the conviction to voluntary manslaughter with more discretion on the part of the judge in regards to sentencing.
* '''Scope''' - A practical issue is whether the fact that an accused is labouring under a "mental disability" should be a necessary but not sufficient condition for negating responsibility i.e. whether the test should also require an incapacity to understand what is being done, to know that what one is doing is wrong, or to control an impulse to do something and so demonstrate a causal link between the disability and the potentially criminal acts and [[omission (criminal law)|omissions]]. For example, the Irish insanity defence comprises the M'Naghten Rules and a control test that asks whether the accused was debarred from refraining from committing the act because of a defect of reason due to mental illness (see ''Doyle v Wicklow County Council'' 1974) 55 IR 71. The [[Butler Committee]] recommended that proof of severe mental disorder should be sufficient to negate responsibility, in effect creating an [[irrebuttable presumption]] of irresponsibility arising from proof of a severe mental disorder. This has been criticized as it assumes a lack of criminal responsibility simply because there is evidence of some sort of mental dysfunction, rather than establishing a standard of criminal responsibility. According to this view, the law should be geared to [[culpability]] not mere psychiatric diagnosis.

==Alternative rules==
The [[insanity defense]] article has a number of alternative tests that have been used at different times and places. As one example, the [[ALI test]] replaced the M'Naughten rule in many parts of the United States for many years until the 1980s; when in the aftermath of [[John Hinckley]] shooting [[President Ronald Reagan]] many ALI states returned to a variation of M'Naughten.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|615}}

==In fiction==
The M'Naghten rules are at the focus of [[John Grisham]]'s legal thriller ''[[A Time to Kill (Grisham novel)| Time to Kill]]''. The M'Naghten rules apply in the US State of [[Mississippi]], where the plot is set, and using them is the only way for the lawyer protagonist to save his client.

Historically, the '''[[merger]] doctrine''' (a.k.a. "doctrine of merger") was the notion that marriage caused a woman's [[legal]] identity to merge with that of her husband.  

Thus, a woman could not [[lawsuit|sue]] or [[testify]] against her husband any more than he could sue or testify against himself. Since her identity had merged with his, the two were now considered one legal entity.

Having started his musical career as a [[folk rock]] singer, in the late 1960s, he developed a fusion between [[Romanian folklore]] and [[Music of Asia|Eastern music]], especially [[Music of India|Indian sound]], moving into [[psychedelic music]]. He founded ''[[Ceata Melopoică]]'' ensemble, with whom he recorded a [[concept album]]. These and his solo acts earned him a cult following among rebellious youth, establishing his reputation as one of the most original contributors to Romanian pop music. Florian was also an early member of ''[[Cenaclul Flacăra]]'', a traveling music and literature circle, but parted with it when it became increasingly [[nationalism|nationalistic]].

Before 1980, Florian was turning his attention to [[electronic music]] and [[New wave music|new wave]]. In parallel, like other artists on the Romanian folk scene, he was pursuing his interest in non-pop ventures, from [[experimental rock]] and [[minimal music]] to [[biomusic]], and exhibiting his [[installation art]]. In 1986, Florian escaped Communist Romania, having by then been exposed to much [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]], and took up cultural and scientific projects in [[West Germany]]. Since the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Romanian Revolution]], he has made frequent returns, playing at numerous festivals and composing film scores.

==Biography==

===Beginnings===
Born in [[Satu Mare]], Mircea Florian began his musical education as a pianist and [[saxophonist]], before turning to guitar, [[blockflute]], [[mandolin]] and various other instruments.&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Plămădeală, Horia Diaconescu, [http://www.muzicisifaze.com/interviu.php?id=10 "Interviu cu Mircea Florian"], ''Muzici şi Faze'', October 3, 2005; retrieved September 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He first took classes at the Satu Mare Art School,&lt;ref name="floriandoctor"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/mircea-florian-titlul-doctor-honoris-causa-din-partea-universitatii-vasile-goldis-932415.html "Mircea Florian, titlul Doctor Honoris Causa din partea Universităţii 'Vasile Goldiş' "], in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', June 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and first became interested in [[performing arts]] while an avid spectator of the local ''Medrano'' Circus (the place where he also witnessed the first concert by a rock band).&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt;

Florian then studied at the [[Mihai Eminescu National College (Satu Mare)|Eminescu High School]], where he had musical appearances with the band ''Zburătorii'' (1965).&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; A while after, he also gave his first [[one-man show]], which included a dance routine.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; In parallel to state-run education, he took private courses in music and visual arts.&lt;ref name="floriandoctor"/&gt; Florian first came into contact with the burgeoning [[hippie]] movement of the [[Western world|West]], and met Romanians who, despite facing tight scrutiny from the communist authorities, wanted to replicate it locally. In 2005, he stated that the fundamental difference was in the [[drug culture]], which Romanians had little access to, adding: "In any case the manner in which the artistic act was supposed to be carried out here was different from what one could experience in the West. Romanian artists created for a tighter circle, of (proper) connoisseurs."&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; Elsewhere, he also noted that hippie culture was essentially becoming more accessible to Romanians by the end of the 1960s: "I remember that, once a record came out, fresh off the Western market, no more than a week would pass before it got to Romania, brought over by some sailor or an acquaintance who had been visiting 'out on the outside', or through heaven knows what channels..."&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://freshgoodminimal.ro/?p=1944 "Mircea Florian: 'M-am născut la ţanc!' "], [http://freshgoodminimal.ro/ freshgoodminimal.ro]; retrieved September 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the decade's pop acts, Florian was most impressed by [[Bob Dylan]], [[The Beatles]] and [[Leonard Cohen]].&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; At the time, he became an avid listener of clandestine Western radio, where he first heard the music of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Steve Reich]] and especially [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]]: "Nono's music was so new, so captivating, so rich in meanings... I got hooked on it forever!"&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; He carried out his first experiments with electronic music at the age of 16, when, in his search for new "[[tone color]]s", he turned a [[sound generator]] into a keyboard instrument.&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

''Zburătorii'' disbanded in 1967, and Florian left Satu Mare for [[Bucharest]], the capital.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; He studied [[cybernetics]] at the [[Politehnica University of Bucharest|Politehnica University]], from 1967 to 1972, and was part of the first-ever graduating class at Politehnica's Faculty of Economic Calculations.&lt;ref name="floriandoctor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; After arriving in Bucharest, he played for a while with a band called ''Lotus'', which, he recalls, was a "pretty interesting" folk project.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; In 1968, during the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion of Czechoslovakia]], Florian also had his first brush-in with communist censorship: a song of his, which was transparently critical of the [[Soviet Union]], was banned from [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company|public radio]]. According to popular account, DJ [[Cornel Chiriac]] ignored such commands and played the song, being promptly sacked as a result (the other version attributes his dismissal to having played The Beatles' ambiguous record "[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.europalibera.org/author/21228.html "Cornel Chiriac"], at [[Radio Free Europe]] Romanian edition; retrieved September 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lotus''{{'}} major breakthrough came in 1969, when they performed at the ''3-Gaură-3'' Club, where music critic [[Florin Silviu Ursulescu]] organized Romania's first [[American folk revival|American folk]]-inspired music festival.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; As noted by Florian, ''Lotus'' appeared alongside the "first wave" of Romanian folk singers, among them [[Mircea Vintilă]], [[Dorin Liviu Zaharia]] and [[Doru Stănculescu]].&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; At around the same time, Florian joined the ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'' literary club,&lt;ref name="llpaunescu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Lucian Laszlo, [http://www.adevarul.ro/locale/satu_mare/Satu_Mare-_Octavian_Bud-_-Paunescu_a_fost_ca_un_zeu_pentru_noi_0_366563634.html "Octavian Bud: 'Păunescu a fost ca un zeu pentru noi' "], in ''[[Adevărul]]'' Satu Mare edition, November 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Dan C.

In parallel, Florian's work in mathematics opened new fields for his musical experimentation. The major factor, he notes, was his familiarization with [[transistor computer]]s at the Economic Calculations laboratory and the [[Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies]], during an era of "sheer luck"—that is, when [[liberalization]] allowed Romania to trade in electronics with the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; He had a free hand to work in [[algorithmic composition]] and [[computer music]].&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; He was officially employed by the computer industry from age 22, supplementing his salary with semi-compulsory dispatches "on location", which allowed him to invest his own money in various cutting-edge musical instruments.&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

===''Florian în Labirint'' to ''Ceata Melopoică''===
By 1971, Mircea Florian had grown dissatisfied with the band concept,&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; and committed himself mainly to solo projects. As such, in what he calls his "white period" of [[acoustic rock]], he notably became the opening act for the celebrated rock band [[Transsylvania Phoenix]].&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"&gt;{{ro icon}} Iulia Popovici, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Tot-ce-ne-nconjoara-e-un-instrument-muzical.-Interviu-cu-Mircea-FLORIAN*articleID_9537-articles_details.html " 'Tot ce ne-nconjoară e un instrument muzical'. Interviu cu Mircea Florian"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 193, November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; He also played at the [[Ion Mincu University of Architecture and Urbanism|Ion Mincu University]] hangout, ''Club A'', in live concerts with Vintilă and actor-singer [[Florian Pittiş]]. The coincidence of names with the latter was a running joke, and it was here that he began using the stage name ''Florian din Transilvania'' (literally, "Florian from [[Transylvania]]").&lt;ref name="cdmfecunoi"&gt;{{ro icon}} Claudia Daboveanu, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/campaniile-jurnalul/folk-you/mircea-florian-e-cu-noi-38513.html "Mircea Florian e cu noi"], in ''[[Jurnalul Naţional]]'', August 26, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; It has endured as one of the singer's main pseudonyms, alongside ''M. A. N. Florian''.&lt;ref name="mpbanda"/&gt;

His focus was on playing string instruments such as guitar or ''[[cobza]]'', as well as being a singer-songwriter. He established a concept-band, known initially as ''Florian în Labirint'' ("Florian in the Labyrinth"), and later as ''Ceata de dubaşi, ceteraşi, kitarozi şi alţi meşteri lăutari'' ("A Band of Drummers, [[Cittern]]-players, Guitarists and Other Master ''[[Lăutari]]''"), and also involving [[Gabi Căciulă]] and [[Sorin Chifiriuc]] as guitarists and Alexandru Beno as violinist.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; The project broke musical ground when it added [[Music of India|Indian influences]] and [[sitar]] backing, which was contributed by [[Ljubiša Ristić]], of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; The occasional [[tabla]] rhythm and [[flute]] melodies were played by a [[Pakistan]]i performer, Arif Djafri.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt;

The music was described by Florian as combining "archaic and [[Electric instrument|electric]] elements" into "a science",&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; and covering successive colored "periods" in his creative history, when he was into amassing musical instruments.&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt; The new Western inspirations on his work were [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Peter Gabriel]] and [[Todd Rundgren]].&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; Emerging from the core group of ''Florian în Labirint'', ''[[Ceata Melopoică]]'' ("The Melo-poetic Band") became Florian's main project of the 1970s. Its often-changing membership included: Beno, Căciulă, Chifiriuc, Ristić, Zaharia, [[Andrei Oişteanu]], [[Alexandru Beno]], [[Valentin Andronescu]], [[Günther Reininger]], [[Andrei Cristea (musician)|Andrei Cristea]], [[Eugen Gondi]], [[Dietrich Krauser]], [[Mihai Creţu]], [[Costin Petrescu (musician)|Costin Petrescu]], [[Alexandru Mitaru]], [[Alexe Conta]], [[Mircea Dordoi]], [[Ortansa Păun]], [[Sorin Baroţi]], [[Gheorghe Popescu (musician)|Gheorghe Popescu]] and [[Mihai Pintilie]].&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"&gt;{{ro icon}} Vlad Radovan, [http://www.cotidianul.ro/mircea-florian-tot-ce-fac-este-pentru-initiati-nu-cer-ceva-special-147362/ "Mircea Florian: Tot ce fac este pentru iniţiaţi. Nu cer ceva special"], in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', May 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

From its choice of name, this new project also reflected its leader's mounting interest in [[Ancient Greek philosophy]], the ideological source of his [[Psychedelic folk|psych-folk]], which he describes as more profound than generic folk rock.&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; He referred to his earlier folk songs as "singable" and "more accessible" than his later work.&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; Although psychedelic music was not well seen in Communist Romania in the 1970s, Florian's psych-folk earned a cult following. According to critic Mihai Plămădeală, there was a transition at the end of which Florian became "one of the most peculiar Romanian musicians": "While he started his career as a folk-singer, with several calm and usual songs, Florian slowly began to get distance from standard means of expression."&lt;ref name="mptainicul"&gt;Mihai Plămădeală, Horia Diaconescu, [http://www.muzicisifaze.com/trupa.php?cat=1&amp;id=31&amp;alb=37&amp;lang=en "''Tainicul vîrtej''"], ''Muzici şi Faze'', February 11, 2003; retrieved September 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protest singer===
There was a political aspect to Florian's reputation. He later spoke about the cultural shock at the end of liberalization, when the ''[[July Theses]]'' introduced [[People's Republic of China|Sino]]-[[North Korea]]n-style state control.&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; As noted by critic [[Marius Chivu]], Florian's opposition to the communist regime led him into "the great quad of folk [[Protest song|protest singers]]", with [[Nicu Vladimir]], [[Valeriu Sterian]] and [[Horia Stoicanu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Marius Chivu]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/carte/articol/o-legenda-folkului "O legendă a folkului"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 357, December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; For a while, he was a presence at ''[[Cenaclul Flacăra]]'', the folk-singing club organized with communist approval. The singer later stated that he was one of the club's founding members, together with poet [[Adrian Păunescu]], his colleague at ''Luceafărul'', and that he intended to create "a movement to bring together people interested in poetry and music."&lt;ref name="llpaunescu"/&gt;

In the end, Florian was thrown out for performing songs punctuated with [[double entendre]]s.&lt;ref name="mparipile"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Plămădeală, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/ARTE-VIZUALE.-Aripile-negre-ale-lui-Mircea-Florian*articleID_25685-articles_details.html "Aripile negre ale lui Mircea Florian"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 585, July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Literary critic and folk music fan [[Dan C. Mihăilescu]] suggests that these disagreements reflected a larger cultural conflict. He describes Florian, [[Marcela Saftiuc]], Sterian and Zaharia as fundamentally different from the "[[Maoism|Maoist]]" agenda of Romanian communism, and notes that they also became irreconcilable with Păunescu when the latter committed himself to "embarrassing" indoctrination.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Dan C. Mihăilescu]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/carte/articol/voia-mea-adrian-paunescu "Fără voia mea, despre Adrian Păunescu"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 353, November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting back on his childhood attendance of ''Cenaclul'', writer-politician [[Varujan Vosganian]] noted a similar issue: "I liked Marcela Saftiuc, [...] Mircea Florian, Doru Stănculescu and many others, I did not like it when we were made to stand up clapping and chanting."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.romlit.ro/adrian_punescu2 "In memoriam Adrian Păunescu"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 43/2010&lt;/ref&gt; As asserted by literary critic [[Ion Bogdan Lefter]], "Few authentic artists of the [folk] genre could prevent its rapid absorption into the melodious, lyricaloid and often jingoistic kitsch promoted by the propagandistic ''Cenaclul Flacăra''."&lt;ref name="iblmultim"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Bogdan Lefter]], [http://www.viataromaneasca.eu/arhiva/65_viata-romaneasca-nr-3-4-2010/4_viata-literaturii/585_cit-de-multimedia-poate-deveni-literatura.html "Cît de 'multimedia' poate deveni literatura?"], in ''[[Viaţa Românească]]'', Nr. 3-4/2010&lt;/ref&gt; Florian's account mentions the "controlled diversions" of such ventures, adding that the "real folk" of the 1970s was lost to indoctrination and commercialization.&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

Florian recalls that his lyrics, and especially his long-haired looks, were a growing cause for irritation among [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censors]], and that as a consequence he devised various "strategies" for getting his message across to the public.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; He also explained: "In general the text that was very trenchant stood no chance—they would pick you up then and there and out you were [...]. But everybody would metaphorize. One would get what it was all about from the text, but the most important bit was the state of mind, the attitude sent out by the author, by the artist... [...] Very often [my] message was a simple one: I refused enrollment, I refused that social formula, I would not let myself be lied to and I would let the public know that, I called for 'general cleanup' actions, I also expressed my position on the fact that freedom had been taken away from me. That was fundamental."&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

Florian and Zaharia had a friendly relationship with writer [[Dorin Tudoran]], who was in the process of becoming an outspoken [[dissident]]. According to Tudoran, it was around 1974 when the three of them first became aware that agents of the [[Securitate]] secret police were keeping them under surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Rodica Palade, [[Dorin Tudoran]], [http://www.revista22.ro/turn259toria-ca-voca355ie-irepresibil259-i-9216.html "Turnătoria ca vocaţie irepresibilă (I)"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 1077, October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ceata'' member Andrei Oişteanu, who made his career in religious studies, also noted that the Securitate was at the time closing in on himself and other non-conformists or hippies.&lt;ref name="aorasuplansu1"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Oişteanu]], [http://www.revista22.ro/rasu-plansu-i-574.html "Râsu'-Plânsu' (I)"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 702, August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Florian's solo music was included on the 1973 [[Split album|split EP]] ''Muzică folk'' ("Folk Music"), which he shared with Saftiuc,&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; then, in 1975, on the [[Single (music)|single]] ''Pădure liniştitoare/La făgădău' de piatră/Cu pleoapa de argint'' ("Quieting Forest/At the Stone Tavern/With the Silver Eyelid"). The songs, recorded with Chifiriuc, Reininger and Căciulă, were based on texts written by Florian or selected from Romanian folklore, particularly [[hajduk]] songs. The instrumental arrangement comprised a wide assortment of instruments: [[acoustic guitar]], flute, drum kit, ''cobza'', [[jaw harp]], [[idiophone]]s (all played by Florian himself), alongside [[electric guitar]], tabla, [[conga]], [[electric piano]], [[celesta]], [[synthesizer]] and [[electronic organ]].&lt;ref name="mppadure"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Plămădeală, [http://www.muzicisifaze.com/trupa.php?id=238&amp;cat=1 "''Pădure liniştitoare/La făgădău' de piatră/Cu pleoapa de argint''"], ''Muzici şi Faze'', September 5, 2005; retrieved September 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Mihai Plămădeală describes the result as a unique project in [[Music of Romania|Romanian music]]: "Nothing of what can be listened to or heard on it finds a direct correspondent in anything that anyone, anywhere, has achieved."&lt;ref name="mppadure"/&gt; He notes Florian's fusion of "hippie culture", "[[mantra]]" singing and the "maximal liberty of [[progressive rock]]".&lt;ref name="mppadure"/&gt; Reputedly, Florian remains the first Romanian singer to have employed the synthesizer in one of their works.&lt;ref name="smmeola"&gt;{{ro icon}} Sebastian Mihalcea, [http://www1.romanialibera.ro/index.php?section=articol&amp;screen=print&amp;id=47996&amp;page=0&amp;order=0&amp;redactie=0 "Al di Meola şi-a vrăjit ascultătorii la Festivalul multicultural PLAI"], in ''[[România Liberă]]'', September 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Florian continued with live performances, including the concert of [[Orăştioara de Sus]], where he went on stage alongside Transsylvania Phoenix and the traditionalist drumming band of [[Făget|Brăneşti]], performing what Florian calls "unfiltered, clean, unprocessed music."&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt; Like Nicu Vladimir, he gave concerts at the "fires on the beach" gatherings in the remote [[Romanian Black Sea resorts|Black Sea resort]] of [[2 Mai]], a hippie hotspot, before such events were altogether banned on grounds of border security.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Mircea Kivu, [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/tema-saptamanii/articol/capital-social-inainte-si-dupa "Capital social, înainte şi după"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 233, July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He also provided the music to Oişteanu's play ''Vlacea, regele nebun'' ("Mad King Vlacea"), performed on tour by the [[Ţăndărică Theater]], and reportedly poking fun at the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] leader [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]].&lt;ref name="aorasuplansu1"/&gt; Florian later made an appearance as actor-pupeteer and multi-instrumentalist performer in ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]'', directed by [[Cătălina Buzoianu]] for Ţăndărică. As he recalls, this involved him playing some 30 or 40 instruments in quick succession, from celesta, [[sackbut]] and [[melodica]] to guitar; Florian does not consider himself a consummate player of all such instruments: "it's like painting and needing some yellow just for a tiny highlight. You can't say you've painted in yellow."&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

''Pădure...'' was followed in 1977 by another single, ''Fîntîna'' ("The Well").&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; An [[electronic rock]] product, it included a collaboration with rock drummer Radu Răducanu.&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; In 1979, Florian was included on a compilation album, also titled ''Muzică folk''.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; However, most of the music he composed and produced at that stage went unrecorded, or was only preserved on [[fidelipac]].&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; As noted by his former promoter [[Florin Silviu Ursulescu]], who was working for the [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company|Radio Company]], his supervisors had simply banned some of Florian's songs for containing what they called "inane lyrics".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Tudor Călin Zărojanu, [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/80-de-ani-in-eter-3387201 "80 de ani în eter"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', October 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimalism and new wave===
Over the following period, Florian became more interested in [[electronic music]], familiarizing himself with new technologies while working as an engineer for the Computer Science Institute, Bucharest.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; He also had access to the recordings kept in the Radu Stan collection at the [[National Library of Romania|State Central Library]].&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; According to his own reference system, this inaugurated a "green period".&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt; Beyond the early pop influences, Florian was increasingly inspired by the classics of electronic, [[Aleatoric music|aleatoric]] or [[minimal music]]: [[Léon Theremin]], [[Pierre Schaeffer]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Morton Subotnick]], [[Lejaren Hiller]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Iannis Xenakis]], [[John Cage]].&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt;

With collaborators Belu Alexandru and Valentin Antonescu, he tested minimalist recordings on [[magnetic tape]], glued into various sequences.&lt;ref name="mpbanda"/&gt; Florian also composed and, with the help of Transsylvania Phoenix drummer [[Costin Petrescu (musician)|Costin Petrescu]], recorded the [[experimental rock]] song ''Nicodim şi toaca ascunsă'' ("Nicodim and the Hidden [[Semantron]]"), which was visually supported by Florian's performance art and reworked on a [[music sequencer]].&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; The musical pieces were played at Florian's exhibits, including his contribution to the major multimaedia show ''Scrierea'' ("Writing"), or in special "new music" concerts held in classical concert halls such as the [[Romanian Atheneum]].&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; His other activity as a multimedia artist was in [[biomusic]]: in 1976, Kalinderu Palace hosted his live study, ''Corpul uman'' ("The Human Body"), during which he mixed the body resonance of one friend into a musical arrangement.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt;

In reference to this phase, Lefter includes Florian among the young men who reached out of the folk and hippie scenes and into the field of multimedia experiments, in what was largely an attempt to circumvent the official art of communism. This "pre-[[Postmodernism|postmodern]]" transition, Lefter notes, was also affected by the [[Sfinx (band)|Sfinx]], Transsylvania Phoenix, "the weird" Dorin Zaharia and Nicu Vladimir, but Florian's work remained the "most interesting".&lt;ref name="iblmultim"/&gt; Florian, who first began introducing himself as an "[[Intermedia|InterMedia artist]]" during the 1970s,&lt;ref name="mpbanda"/&gt; collaborated with draftsman Anton Petraşincu, who created the first [[Opaque projector|opaque projections]] to go with Florian's live singing.&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

By 1977, Florian's interest in [[electronic musical instrument]]s, particularly synthesizers, created splits within ''Ceata Melopoică'', which was also affected by some of its members' decisions to emigrate.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; In the early 1980s, Florian was again interested in setting up a classic rock band, but also sought to preserve the trademark combination of folklore and electronics.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; He switched to [[new wave music]], with his new band ''Florian din Transilvania''; among his new wave and electronic influences, Florian called to mind [[David Byrne]], [[Brian Eno]]&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; and [[Depeche Mode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Marius Chivu]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/la-zi-cultura/articol/dilemeche-mode "Dilemeche Mode"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 118, April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting back on this time, he spoke of Sfinx's [[Dan Andrei Aldea]] as the "saint" of Romanian electronic music, one "more important than anyone else" on this scene.&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

The group only released one album, the 1986 [[Gramophone record|vinyl-edition]] ''Tainicul vîrtej'' ("The Secret Swirl"), with the state-run recording company [[Electrecord]].&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mptainicul"/&gt; The lyricist and composer Florian did most of the vocals, and played ''cobza'', guitar and synthesizer. The other members of the team came from various Romanian rock and pop acts: Andronescu was on keyboards, [[Doru Căplescu]] on additional synthesizer, [[Dan Cimpoieru]] on second guitar, [[Doru Istudor]] on drums, [[Zsolt Kerestely]] on [[electronic drum]]s, with [[Mircea Baniciu]] providing backing vocals and [[Mihaela Hoaja]] the violin parts.&lt;ref name="mptainicul"/&gt; Reportedly, the record went through the hands of official censors before being released, and Florian's song ''Madama Butterfly'' had to be discarded, leaving space for other songs such as ''Nunta lui Harap Alb'' ("[[Harap Alb]]'s Wedding").&lt;ref name="mptainicul"/&gt; The song ''AS'' ("Ace"), also included on the album, was altogether banned after the Electrecord producers picked up on its political hints.&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

Plămădeală argues that ''Tainicul vîrtej'' follows its composer's "metaphysical" inclination, being notable for its "shock element",&lt;ref name="mptainicul"/&gt; while journalist and musician Maria Balabaş describes the record as "psychedelic" with an "electronic sound".&lt;ref name="mbferit"&gt;{{ro icon}} Maria Balabaş, [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/muzica/articol/ferit-intemperii "Ferit de intemperii"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 377, May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to its author, it should also be seen as "intellectualized" and "elitist", but not in fact a "hiatus" in his artistic development.&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; Florian additionally argued that, from "stupor", the public's reaction to his compositions became "very positive, even enthusiastic."&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

Although short-lived, the act became known on the underground scene for both its music and the [[conceptual art]] of its live performances, drawing comparisons with [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Popol Vuh (German band)|Popol Vuh]] and the [[Third Ear Band]]; during such events, Florian would appear dressed up in a [[hazmat suit]].&lt;ref name="mptainicul"/&gt; Florian and his collaborators toured the country, and were awarded the first prize at the ''Constelaţii rock'' event in [[Râmnicu Vâlcea]].&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; ''Tainicul vîrtej'' also led to shows at various underground venues, from [[Stelian Tănase]]'s rock evenings at the [[Constantin Tănase Revue Theater|Revue Theater]] to the [[State Jewish Theater (Romania)|State Jewish Theater]] stage and [[Arenele Romane]].&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

The artist was several times invited to exhibit his work outside Romania, and even beyond the [[Iron Curtain]], receiving a scholarship from the [[German Academic Exchange Service]] and attending the ''[[Darmstädter Ferienkurse]]'', where he worked under Stockhausen's supervision.&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; In 1982, he was among those collaborating with the ''[[Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk]]'' studio of electronic music, in [[Cologne]].&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; His concerts abroad were probably the reason why his ''Tainicul vîrtej'' was never on general release: the communist government allegedly presumed that he would not be returning, and tried to prevent the public from glorifying his departure.&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt; Florian accuses Electrecord of having mismanaged the distribution, by not printing sufficient copies and by oversupplying shops located outside Bucharest.&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;

===Defection and return===
Mircea Florian continued his work in other media, joining with the ''SubReal'' performance artists, with whom he staged a 1986 event in the city of [[Sibiu]].&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; He notes having been increasingly frustrated by censorship, which prevented him from participating in some exhibits and concerts, and eventually pondering about leaving the country.&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt;

After receiving a visa for the [[United States]], where he had been invited to present his [[sound installation]]s, he [[Defector|defected]] and later settled down in [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; He changed residence between the cities of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]: [[Mettmann]], [[Wuppertal]], [[Düsseldorf]].&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; He decided not to work as a musician, because he could only conceive of singing in his native [[Romanian language]].&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt;

Florian focused on his work as an artist and computer scientist.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; Since the late 1980s he has been combining visual arts with music to create [[sound sculpture]]s, [[sound installation]]s, and [[collage]]s. By 2009, his work had received some 21 awards, including, alongside Romanian ones, German, [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Japan]]ese distinctions.&lt;ref name="mpbanda"/&gt; He was present with his work at the [[Venice Biennale]] of 1999,&lt;ref name="mpbanda"/&gt; and managed a Romanian festival in Wuppertal.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Aurelia Mocanu, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/ARTE-VIZUALE.-%C4%B9%C5%BEeptar-norocos-pe-Ruhr*articleID_24625-articles_details.html "Şeptar norocos pe Ruhr"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 552, November 2010; [[Cezar Paul-Bădescu]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/din-polul-plus/articol/romania-compozitorului-german "România compozitorului german"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 98, December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], Florian has resumed his collaboration with Romanian artists, including [[Nicu Covaci]]: in 1992, he wrote the title song on Covaci's "Symphoenix" album ''Timişoara''.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; Also in 1992, he participated in setting up ''Deutsch-Rumänische Kulturbegegnungen'' ("German-Romanian Cultural Encounters", or DeR KuB), a cultural society dedicated to cooperation between artists; its Romanian branch is the ''Mircea Florian Association''.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; Two years later, some of his work was reissued on the ''Club A'' compilation.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; Florian also contributed the preface to Vlad Arghir's book, the first Romanian-language monograph on [[Leonard Cohen]], published in Hungary by [[Pont Kiadó]].&lt;ref name="ficohen"&gt;{{ro icon}} Florin Irimia, [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=6661 "Leonard Cohen, cartonat"], in ''aLtitudini'', Nr. 1/2006 (republished by [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ ''România Culturală''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021335/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ |date=2011-09-02 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

Florian and DeR KuB have organized several events reuniting Romanian folkloric ensembles from [[Hungary]], [[Serbia]] and [[Ukraine]] with bands representing the various traditions of [[Minorities of Romania|minority groups in Romania]].&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; He personally spent a week in Satu Mare Prison, coaching the detainees' own musical project, and created portrait projection shows in Satu Mare and [[Bratislava]].&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; In addition to opening for Phoenix and Covaci at reunion concerts in 2003,&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt; Florian has performed with the [[Shukar Collective]] project, which mixes electronic music with [[Romani music|Romani tradition]]. He and Shukar's DJ Vasile remixed several ''[[Ursari]]'' renditions of old songs, "some five out of eleven" entries on the Collective's album, and including the single ''Anna e Manole''.&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; He intended to continue work with this group, but it disbanded following lead singer Tamango's illness.&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt;

Florian's performance art was showcased in exhibits at the [[National Theater Bucharest]], the International Center for Contemporary Art, the [[Technical University of Cluj-Napoca|Cluj-Napoca Technical College]] etc.&lt;ref name="ipinstrument"/&gt; In addition, he was [[visiting scholar]] at the [[Caragiale Academy of Theatrical Arts and Cinematography]] and [[Babeş-Bolyai University]].&lt;ref name="mpbanda"/&gt; Florian was also invited to sing at the ''Stufstock'' event of [[Vama Veche]], in 2004, but refused to perform on stage, and gave an impromptu concert on one of the side alleys, in hopes of addressing only his real fans.&lt;ref name="cdmfecunoi"/&gt; Florian was later a guest at ''Festivalul Plai'', a multicultural music event held in [[Timişoara]] city.&lt;ref name="smmeola"/&gt; He also returned to attend the [[Gărâna Jazz Festival]],&lt;ref name="mphadinterviu"/&gt; and tried to set up his own [[world music]] festival project, in [[Certeze]].&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; His presences at ''Folk You!'' in Vama Veche were included on the festival's "best of" compilation for 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Dana Andronie, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/jurnalul-national/jurnalul-national/marturia-faptelor-316194.html "Mărturia faptelor"], in ''[[Jurnalul Naţional]]'', August 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, after polling the Romanian music critics, ''Sunete'' magazine ranked Florian the 11th most important musician in the country's pop history.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Alex Revenco, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/cultura/arte-vizuale/under-more-113700.html "Under &amp; more"], in ''[[Jurnalul Naţional]]'', January 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later projects===
Florian composed the musical score to [[Ioan Cărmăzan]]'s drama film ''[[Margo (2006 film)|Margo]]'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Iulia Blaga, [http://agenda.liternet.ro/articol/3229/Iulia-Blaga/Fericirea-nu-tine-cont-de-marimea-sinilor-Margo.html "Fericirea nu ţine cont de mărimea sînilor!"], [[Editura LiterNet]] (originally published in ''[[România Liberă]]'', September 2006); retrieved September 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="agunul/an"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Gorzo]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/tilc-show/articol/unul-pe "Unul pe an"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 137, September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Like the film itself, his contribution received strong criticism from film critic [[Andrei Gorzo]]: "Margo travels a lot by train, then walks even more, [...] forever accompanied by the chirps, electronic farts and [[spaghetti western]] ding-dongs in Mircea Florian's music."&lt;ref name="agunul/an"/&gt; Florian was later the composer of music for [[Alexandru Solomon]]'s political documentary ''[[Kapitalism: Our Improved Formula]]'' (2010). It was received with interest by film journalist Mihai Fulger, who described Solomon as a "trendsetter", for attaching Florian's original music to animation and archive footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Fulger, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Kapitalism-si-cinema-%28VIDEO%29*articleID_23563-articles_details.html "Kapitalism şi cinema"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 521, April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Florian's contribution was nominated for the [[Gopo Awards]] of 2011, in the "Best Original Music in Short Film" category.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.mediafax.ro/cultura-media/premiile-gopo-2011-vezi-aici-lista-completa-a-nominalizarilor-8001016/ "Premiile Gopo 2011: Vezi aici lista completă a nominalizărilor"], [[Mediafax]] release, February 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

He was additionally working with [[Cătălina Buzoianu]], arranging the music to her various productions, including a 2005 version of [[August Strindberg]]'s ''[[The Father (Strindberg)|Father]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Valentin Dumitrescu, [http://www.revista22.ro/autor-valentin-dumitrescu-4 "Unicul şi multiplul"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 774, January 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2008 staging of [[Mircea Cărtărescu]]'s ''Dream''. Theater manager and poet Ion Cocora was impressed by the latter show and its "fairy tale state", describing Florian's music as "a continuous oscillation between the real and the unreal."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ion Cocora, [http://www.revistaluceafarul.ro/index.html?id=417&amp;editie=24 "Visul lui Mircea Cărtărescu şi al Cătălinei Buzoianu"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 20/2008&lt;/ref&gt; Theater critic Alice Georgescu also described Florian's music for ''Dream'' as "felicitously reusing childish rhymes".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Alice Georgescu, [http://www.zf.ro/ziarul-de-duminica/jocurile-amintirii-3057828 "Jocurile amintirii"], in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', December 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The collaborative project was later taken up for the 2009 productions of [[Matei Vişniec]]'s ''Joan and the Fire'' and ''We're Banning Richard III'' ([[Bulandra Theater]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/TEATRU*articleID_21239-articles_details.html "Teatru"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 461, February 2009; [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/TEATRU*articleID_22451-articles_details.html "Teatru"], in ''Observator Cultural'', Nr. 492, September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to the 2010 adaptation of [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]]'s ''[[The Magician of Lublin (novel)|The Magician of Lublin]]'' ([[State Jewish Theater (Romania)|State Jewish Theater]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/TEATRU*articleID_23259-articles_details.html "Teatru"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 513, February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 2007, Florian's work in art again centered on magnetic tape, used in collages and sound sculptures. One example is his work ''The Last Supper'', exhibited in [[Berlin]]: it is a combination of three [[analog recording]]s, on different colors of tape, played in unison.&lt;ref name="mpbanda"/&gt; His work in Romania covered graphic art, and he designed the layout to the cultural review ''aLtitudini''.&lt;ref name="ficohen"/&gt; Some of his other projects again bridged avant-garde jazz and literature. Around 2004, he toured with novelist [[Gheorghe Crăciun]], who was promoting his book ''Pupa Russa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Vitalie Ciobanu]], [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=415 "Evocare Gheorghe Crăciun"], in ''[[Contrafort]]'', Nr. 1-3/2007 (republished by [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ ''România Culturală''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021335/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ |date=2011-09-02 }})&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he resumed his work with [[Valery Oisteanu]], upon the latter's return from the United States. Their mix of Surrealism and electronic music was hosted by the ''Green Hours'' pub, in Bucharest.&lt;ref name="psvalery"/&gt;

While experimenting with a new generation of [[electronica]] gear ([[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], [[Ableton Live]] and [[Max (software)|Max]] programs, [[Korg]] adapters etc.), Florian still saw string instruments as his first love, and noted that he had also begun playing the [[guitalele]].&lt;ref name="fgmnascut"/&gt; In February 2011, Florian, DJ Vasile and their new music project, ''FloriMan'', performed live at the ''Cinema Total'', part of the [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlinale festivities]]. During this, they mixed electronic music and traditional ''[[bucium]]''-playing.&lt;ref name="lvberlinul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.jurnalul.ro/caleidoscop/calendar/omul-zilei-mircea-florian-568688.html "Omul zilei: Mircea Florian"], in ''[[Jurnalul Naţional]]'', February 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; His past work was also included in the Berlin exhibit ''When History Comes Knocking: Romanian Art from the 80s and 90s in Close Up''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Daria Ghiu, [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/arte-vizuale/articol/istoriei-artei-estice-trebuie-scrisa-esticii-i-i " 'Istoria artei estice trebuie scrisă de esticii înşişi' Interviu cu Judit Angel"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 370, March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, the [[Vasile Goldiş West University of Arad|Vasile Goldiş West University]] made Florian an ''[[honoris causa]]'' doctor.&lt;ref name="floriandoctor"/&gt; The same year, he returned to Romania with a re-release of ''Tainicul vîrtej'' as a Bucharest musical show, part of the Club A Festival,&lt;ref name="vrinitiati"/&gt; and a personal exhibit at the Bucharest Municipal Art Galleries, ''Negrele-mi aripi'' ("Black My Wings"), turned into a film directed by fellow artist Victor Velculescu. It recorded Florian's installations, which comprised brushes, a [[laptop]], an [[oscilloscope]] and other instruments, creating the illusion of a winged figure attached to his body.&lt;ref name="mparipile"/&gt; Also in 2011, the [[alternative rock]] act [[byron (band)|byron]] covered one of his ''Tainicul vîrtej'' songs on their own album ''Perfect''.&lt;ref name="mbferit"/&gt;

'''''Miyabi''''' (雅) is one of the traditional Japanese aesthetic ideals, though not as prevalent as [[Iki (aesthetic ideal)|Iki]] or [[Wabi-sabi]]. In modern Japanese, the word is usually translated as "elegance," "refinement," or "courtliness" and sometimes to a "sweet loved one".

The ideal posed by the word demanded the elimination of anything that was absurd or vulgar and the "polishing of manners, diction, and feelings to eliminate all roughness and crudity so as to achieve the highest grace." It expressed that sensitivity to beauty which was the hallmark of the [[Heian period|Heian]] era. Miyabi is often closely connected to the notion of [[Mono no aware]], a bittersweet awareness of the transience of things, and thus it was thought that things in decline showed a great sense of miyabi. An example of this would be one of a lone cherry tree. The tree would soon lose its flowers and would be stripped of everything that made it beautiful and so it showed not only mono no aware, but also miyabi in the process.

Adherents to the ideals of miyabi strove to rid the world of crude forms or aesthetics and emotions that were common in artworks of the period, such as those contained in the [[Man'yōshū]], the oldest extant collection of [[Japanese poetry]]. The [[Man'yōshū]] contained poems by people of every walk of life, many of which stood in stark contrast to the sensibilities of miyabi. For example, one poem in the collection likened a woman's hair to snail innards. The ideals of miyabi stood firmly against the use of metaphors such as this.  Furthermore, appreciation of miyabi and its ideal was used as a marker of class differences. It was believed that only members of the upper class, the courtiers, could truly appreciate the workings of miyabi.

Miyabi in fact limited how art and poems could be created. Miyabi tried to stay away from the rustic and crude, and in doing so, prevented the traditionally trained courtiers from expressing real feelings in their works. In later years, miyabi and its aesthetic were replaced by ideals inspired by [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]], such as [[Wabi-sabi]], [[Yugen|Yuugen]] and [[Iki (aesthetic ideal)|Iki]].

The characters of the classic eleventh-century Japanese novel "[[The Tale of Genji]]" by [[Lady Murasaki]] provide  examples of  miyabi.&lt;ref&gt;''Japanese Aesthetics and Culture'' Nancy G. Hume, {{ISBN|978-0791424001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6652">'''Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA)''' refers to a set of policies and actions that countries undertake as part of a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The term recognizes that different countries may take different nationally appropriate action on the basis of equity and in accordance with common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. It also emphasizes financial assistance from developed countries to developing countries to reduce emissions.

NAMA was first used in the [[Bali Action Plan]] as part of the [[Bali Road Map]] agreed at the [[Bali Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali]] in December 2007, and also formed part of the [[Copenhagen Accord]] issued following the [[COP 15|United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen]] (COP 15) in December 2009.

==History of the use of NAMA in international agreements==

===Bali Action Plan (December 2007)===
The [[Bali Action Plan]] is centered on four main building blocks: (i) Mitigation, (ii) Adaptation, (iii) Technology, and (iv) Financing, with NAMA forming an important part of the mitigation component. 
The Bali Action Plan called for future discussions to address:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/climatechange/docs/UNDP_BAP_Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Measurable, reportable and verifiable nationally appropriate mitigation commitments or actions by all developed countries, and;''
* ''Nationally appropriate mitigation actions by developing country Parties, supported and enabled by technology, financing and capacity-building, in a measurable, reportable and verifiable manner.''.

===Copenhagen Climate Conference (December 2009)===
The [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] did not produce the global agreement envisaged in the Bali Road Map. The Copenhagen Accord, however, did retain the concept of NAMA, but in a narrower definition only applying to Non-Annex 1 countries, and did not specify what form they should take:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c2es.org/copenhagen-accord&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/cop15/eng/11a01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Non-Annex I Parties to the Convention will implement mitigation actions … consistent with Article 4.1 and Article 4.7 and in the context of sustainable development … Non-Annex I Parties will communicate information on the implementation of their actions through National Communications, with provisions for international consultations and analysis under clearly defined guidelines that will ensure that national sovereignty is respected. '''Nationally appropriate mitigation actions''' seeking international support will be recorded in a registry along with relevant technology, finance and capacity building support. Those actions supported will be added to the list in appendix II. These supported '''nationally appropriate mitigation actions''' will be subject to international measurement, reporting and verification in accordance with guidelines adopted by the Conference of the Parties.''

==What is meant by Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action?==
* Different countries, different nationally appropriate action on the basis of equity and in accordance with common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities 
* Developing countries will effectively implement national action depending on the effective implementation of the commitments by developed countries in providing financial resources and transfer of technology. 
* The priorities of developing countries are economic and social development and poverty eradication.&lt;ref name="oecd.org"&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/39/16/40633672.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
India has argued that NAMA means ''voluntary reductions'' by developing countries that ''require to be supported and enabled'' by technology transfer from developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/files/kyoto_protocol/application/pdf/india100209b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
By definition, NAMAs will vary by country. Indonesia, for example, might focus on integrating climate change policy with other aspects of economic development, such as progressive reduction in oil subsidies, poverty reduction through promotion of alternative income to reduce [[illegal logging]], and exploit more fully the country’s renewable resources, especially geothermal.&lt;ref name="oecd.org"/&gt;

==Implementation of NAMA==
In 2010, no NAMAs were implemented yet. The [[Program of Activities (PoA)]] under the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] is regarded a precedor of a future NAMA mechanism and already operational.&lt;ref&gt;Sutter C. and Schibli R., If you want a Nama tomorrow, you need a POA today (March 2011), Trading Carbon, Reuters. Available at: http://www.southpolecarbon.com/_downloads/110300_Namas_TradingCarbon_SPcs-rs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of NAMA submissions==
As of September 2012, about 50 countries have submitted information of their NAMA to the UNFCCC. The detailed contents of their submissions vary greatly on each country, ranging from their intention to be associated with the Copenhagen Accord, target sectors, specific actions to be taken, to GHG emissions reduction targets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mmechanisms.org/e/namainfo/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC, 2012 "Submission of more information by developing country Parties, subject to availability, relating to nationally appropriate mitigation actions, including underlying assumptions and methodologies, sectors and gases covered, global warming potential values used, support needs for implementation of nationally appropriate mitigation actions and estimated mitigation outcomes. Submissions from Parties." FCCC/AWGLCA/2012/MISC.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC, 2011 "Compilation of information on nationally appropriate mitigation actions to be implemented by Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention." FCCC/AWGLCA/2011/INF.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of NAMA's Submitted==

A list of NAMAs is available at http://www.nama-database.org/.

[[Clean Production Agreement]], [[Chile]], 2012.

==Criticism of NAMA==
Some have criticized NAMA as heading away from [[carbon pricing]] and encouraging enormous subsidy programs funded by developed countries and implemented on a voluntary basis by developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Stoft, Steven E., Beyond Kyoto: Flexible Carbon Pricing for Global Cooperation (October 23, 2009). Global Energy Policy Center Research Paper No. 09-05. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1502944&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ornate box turtle''' (''Terrapene ornata ornata'') is one of only two terrestrial species of [[turtle]]s native to the [[Great Plains]] of the [[United States]]. It is one of the two different [[subspecies]] of ''[[Terrapene ornata]]''. It is the state reptile of [[Kansas]].&lt;ref name="stateanimals"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stateanimals.com/states/kansas/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205043211/http://www.stateanimals.com/states/kansas/index.html |archivedate=2011-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a relatively small turtle, that is currently listed as threatened in Illinois&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.illinois.gov/ESPB/Documents/ETChecklist2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626043934/http://www.dnr.illinois.gov/ESPB/Documents/ETChecklist2011.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but is of concern and protected in six [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] states ([[Colorado]], [[Iowa]], [[Indiana]], [[Nebraska]], Kansas, and [[Wisconsin]]).&lt;ref name="redder"&gt;Redder, AJ, CK Dodd, D Keinath, D Mcdonald and T Ise, 2006. [http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/projects/scp/assessments/ornateboxturtle.pdf "Ornate box turtle (Terrapene ornata ornata): A technical conservation assessment"].   [[United States Forest Service|USDA Forest Service]], Rocky Mountain Region.  Accessed November 29, 2008.  Peer review administered by the [[Society for Conservation Biology]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Males and females generally look alike but males are often smaller; there is color variation with yellow lines from the center of the shell to the edges through gray, red-brown, or black coloration.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;  Besides the size, males can be distinguished from females in several ways; a large curved inner claw on the back feet, a [[cloaca]]l opening that is farther back in males, a longer and thicker tail, and reddish color on the legs and occasionally on the jaw.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;

== Home range and temperature ==
The home range of the ornate box turtle covers a large area of the Midwest, from Wisconsin to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and from [[Louisiana]] to Colorado.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;  It was first discovered in Nebraska in 1795, where "vast numbers" were found.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;  The turtle is usually found in grasslands and on land rather than in water; they have been found in all habitat types of the Great Plains except aquatic, though most references indicate they prefer open grass or prairie lands.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;  Several studies indicate that the ornate box turtle needs three specific types of [[microhabitat]]s in order to survive:
# grass ([[prairie]]) areas for feeding that have some free water
# areas where females can nest and burrow into the soil to overwinter
# sites for resting and thermoregulation where turtles can bury themselves in soil to protect themselves from extreme temperatures and to avoid dehydration in summer and eat their own eggs &lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="converse2003"&gt;Converse, SJ and JA Savidge, 2003.  Ambient temperature, activity, and microhabitat use by ornate box turtles (Terrapene ornata ornata).  J. Herpetol. 37(4):665-670.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bernstein2004"&gt;Bernstein, NP and RW Black, 2004.  Thermal environment of overwintering ornate box turtles, Terrapene ornata ornata, in Iowa.  Am. Midl. Nat. 153:370-377;&lt;/ref&gt;
Water is important for this turtle to regulate body temperature in hot weather and to replace body water after hibernation, but they do not spend large amounts of time in flowing or standing water.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="converse2003"/&gt;

The ornate box turtle, like all [[reptiles]], is [[ectothermic]], which means that its body temperature is affected by the environmental temperature and the environmental temperature affects its movement.&lt;ref name="converse2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clausen"&gt;Claussen, DL, R Lim, M Kurz and K Wren, 2002.  Effects of slope, substrate, and temperature on the locomotion of the ornate box turtle, Terrapene ornata.  Copeia 2002(2):411-418.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the hottest part of the day, the turtle is less active because movement increases body temperature and makes it harder for the turtle to keep cool, and when the temperature is lower(dawn and dusk), the turtle is more active.&lt;ref name="converse2003"/&gt; Additionally, the turtles use their habitat to help control their body temperature.&lt;ref name="converse2003"/&gt;  [[Shrub]]s are commonly utilized for the shade the plants produce, helping to further regulate the animal's temperature. Open areas of sand are also important parts of the turtle's habitat for digging holes to burrow in.&lt;ref name="converse2003"/&gt;

In winter, ornate box turtles hibernate underground in burrows.  They burrow in at about the same time in the fall and come out within 7–14 days of each other.&lt;ref name="bernstein2004"/&gt;  They can survive freezing soil temperatures for many days.&lt;ref name="bernstein2006"/&gt;  The depth of nest cavities in Nebraska in 1997 and 1998 was 16.8&amp;nbsp;cm and the depth of hatchlings buried in the soil ranged from 56.3&amp;nbsp;cm to 64.7&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="converse2002"&gt;Converse, SJ, JB Iverson and JA Savidge, 2002.  Activity, reproduction and overwintering behavior of ornate box turtles (Terrapene ornata ornata) in the Nebraska Sandhills.  Am Midl. Nat. 148:416-422.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Nebraska, winter burrows were dug after October and turtles stayed in them until April and all of these turtles were in individual burrows.&lt;ref name="converse2002"/&gt;

The home range area of ornate box turtles varies a lot from study to study, from as small as 0.12 [[hectare]]s to as large as 36.4 hectares.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clausen"/&gt;  The large variability in home range size estimates can be affected by seasonality, body size and age, time period of observation, presence of roads or other structures, statistics used, and other factors.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;  The ornate box turtle has a high degree of [[philopatry]], which means that it returns to the same area year after year, and it usually prefers the same habitat type as the original one.&lt;ref name="bernstein2006"&gt;Bernstein, NP, RJ Richtsmeier, RW Black and BR Montgomery, 2006.  Home range and philopatry in the ornate box turtle, Terrapene ornata ornata, in Iowa.  Am Midl. Nat. 157:162-174.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ornate box turtles were two times more likely to be found in the same sub-habitat type as the original and even more likely to be in a sub-habitat next to the original habitat than areas two sub-habitats away.&lt;ref name="bernstein2006"/&gt;

== Feeding preferences ==
The ornate box turtle is an [[omnivore]], with no particular dietary preferences; as an opportunistic feeder, it eats whatever is available in any given location or season.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;  Grasses, berries, [[insect]]s and other [[invertebrate]]s ([[caterpillar]]s, [[grasshopper]]s, [[beetle]]s, [[earthworm]]s), fruits, vegetables, and [[carrion]] (mammals, birds, amphibians, snakes, and even other turtles).&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;  This varied diet means the turtle has very little competition for available food resources.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;

== Lifespan ==
[[File:Ornate terrapin hatchling.jpg|thumb|An ornate box turtle hatchling]]The lifespan of the ornate box turtle has been reported to be from 32 to 37 years, with studies showing that males occur about half as frequently as females.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="converse2003"/&gt;  The reason for the predominance of females is thought to be primarily due to temperature; incubating eggs at 29&amp;nbsp;°C (84&amp;nbsp;°F) produces 100% female offspring, so in the wild a combination of temperature, humidity, and other factors are thought to favor female differentiation.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;

Birds, such as [[crow]]s, [[Bird of prey|raptor]]s, and [[raven]]s; domestic [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s; [[opossum]]s; [[raccoon]]s; [[skunk]]s; [[snake]]s; and even adult box turtles; are potential predators of young turtles.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;  The turtle has very little means of self-defense other than closing the shell, though they may potentially bite if handled.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;

Until recently,  there was very little scientific knowledge of diseases and parasites among the turtle populations; early studies showed that a genus of fly sometimes infested the legs of these turtles and caused death by starvation because their movement was impeded.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;  More recently, it has been found that respiratory, metabolic, and shell diseases, common in desert tortoises, also fairly common in land turtles such as the ornate box turtle; and that nutritional deficiencies contribute to these other diseases.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;

The age of ornate box turtles has been estimated by counting growth rings for many years.  This is similar to estimating the age of a tree but for turtles, the "rings" are lines that form on part of the shell that are like scales and the longer a turtle lives, the more rings are formed.&lt;ref name="bernstein2006"/&gt;  However, using the rings to estimate age is not always reliable.&lt;ref name="wilson2003"&gt;Wilson, DS, CR Tracy and CR Tracy, 2003.  Estimating age of turtles from growth rings: A critical evaluation of the technique.  Herpetologica 59(2):178-194.&lt;/ref&gt;  The shell does increase in size as turtles get older, even though its weight makes it heavy to carry around.&lt;ref name="miller2005"&gt;Miller, K and GF Birchard, 2005.  Influence of body size on shell mass in the ornate box turtle, Terrapene ornata.  J. Herpetol. 39(1):158-161.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats to the ornate box turtle==

=== Intrinsic threats – natural occurrences and factors relating to the turtle itself===
Because of its late reproductive age, low reproductive rate, high young mortality, and long lifespan, the ornate box turtle is subject to pressure from intrinsic factors that limit the population growth.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;  Young turtles are vulnerable to predation until the shell is strong enough to be a major protection (except from being run over by cars).&lt;ref name="miller2005"/&gt;  The loss of any older females is a problem, because they don’t get replaced very fast. Climatic factors are also possible threats to the ornate box turtle.  Because the sex of turtles is strongly influenced by temperature, the sex ratio can be changed by climatic extremes and result in a population that is mostly all one sex for several years in a row.  This gender imbalance would affect the survival of small groups that would be threatened by the occurrence of a [[genetic bottleneck]]&lt;ref name="bernstein2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kuo"&gt;Kuo, C and FJ Janzen, 2004.  Genetic effects of a persistent bottleneck on a natural population of ornate box turtles (Terrapene ornata).  Conserv. Genetics 5:425-437.&lt;/ref&gt; which means the gene pool would be too small and cause inbreeding and mortality.  The bottleneck effect is a double-edged sword for species that live a long time because the loss of genetic diversity would not be as obvious or as severe, but once it occurred, it would be harder to recover.&lt;ref name="kuo"/&gt;   The other thing about the ornate box turtle’s life history that is a problem for its survival is its home range philopatry, which means that it returns to the same area every time and so disruptions in the area make it more vulnerable.&lt;ref name="bernstein2006"/&gt;

===Extrinsic threats – human effects on the ornate box turtle===
The ornate box turtle is a terrestrial turtle and terrestrial turtles are sensitive to human causes such as habitat destruction, introduced species, harvest or collection, pollution, and climate change.&lt;ref name="converse2005"&gt;Converse, SJ, JB Iverson and JA Savidge, 2005.  Demographics of an ornate box turtle population experiencing minimal human-induced disturbances.  Ecological Appl., 15(6):2171-2179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture – agriculture in the Great Plains has been the worst problem for the ornate box turtle recently because it has taken away lots of acres of land, destroyed habitat, caused more traffic, and created small, isolated areas of prairie.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;  In addition, the small pieces of prairie mean more edge habitats, which causes more predators to live there and that increases predation of the box turtle that is already suffering from less total habitat area.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;  Other agricultural factors that are a problem for the ornate box turtle are fences, water troughs, cattle (trampling), mowing, and other machinery.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;

Development – houses and other building construction causes loss of habitat similar to agriculture, but also increased removal for pets, predation by dogs, and greater predation to crows and raccoons that increase around human living areas.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;  Where housing developments are built, there are also more roads.  The box turtle feeds on carrion when it is available and on roads road-kill is a large source of carrion and a large cause of death of ornate box turtles.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;

[[Over-exploitation]] – a huge number of ornate box turtles have been collected for sale in pet stores, and individuals have always collected some turtles.  The commercial trade has had a large effect on the Great Plains populations and if it continues, the result will be a serious decline in turtles.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;

== Conservation efforts ==
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the ornate box turtle is "near threatened."  In some states, such as Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado, the turtle is "secure"; but in South Dakota, it is listed as "imperiled"; and in Wyoming it is listed as "critically imperiled."&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;  Management decisions for the ornate box turtle are difficult because of life history factors.  It seems that the best strategies will be aimed at older females to increase their survival instead of concentrating on hatchlings and juvenile turtles.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;  One of the first things that needs to be done is to get a better idea of the actual number of ornate box turtles that exist and also to make it illegal to collect any for pet or commercial trade,&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt; as some states did.&lt;ref name="converse2005"/&gt;  Along with this is the need to stop the release of captive box turtles that have respiratory infections into the wild because of the effect of disease on survival.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;  Management techniques that preserve the best habitat composition are important conservation practices.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clausen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kuo"/&gt;

Probably the biggest factor that affects the ornate box turtle is interactions with human so any action that minimizes contact is helpful.  Working to keep large areas of habitat undisturbed is also helpful.  Managing weeds with a minimal amount of herbicide and knowing what chemicals are in the herbicide and how they affect turtles is important.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;  The use of fire and mowing to control weeds should be done carefully when turtles are inactive or in burrows to keep cool.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;  The public is not likely to want to stop collecting turtles, even if the pet trade were prohibited, because people like to look at turtles and other forms of nature.  Nebraska and Louisiana have prohibited collecting ornate box turtles, but New Mexico and Texas have not.&lt;ref name="converse2005"/&gt;
Educating the public about the risks to the ornate box turtle will be difficult but should be part of the conservation effort.  One conservation effort that might be helpful is removal of predators from an area where many turtles are found; one study found that removing raccoons was helpful but it also leads to the question of balance in nature and which animals are more important.  Some biologists have suggested that moving turtles from healthy populations to areas where the turtle is struggling might be an option but this is difficult and might be a last resort.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;

Habitat loss is the biggest problem for the ornate box turtle&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bowen2004"&gt;Bowen, KD, PL Colbert and FJ Janzen, 2004.  Survival and recruitment in a human-impacted population of ornate box turtles, Terrapene ornata, with recommendations for conservation and management.  J. Herpetol. 38(4):552-568.&lt;/ref&gt; and isolated habitat areas have isolated groups of turtles that lose genetic diversity and experience bottlenecks that decrease their survival.&lt;ref name="redder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kuo"/&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''pigeonhole principle''' states that if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; items are put into &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; containers, with &lt;math&gt;n &gt; m&lt;/math&gt;, then at least one container must contain more than one item.&lt;ref name=Herstein64&gt;{{harvnb|Herstein|1964|loc= p.&amp;nbsp;90}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This theorem is exemplified in real life by truisms like "in any group of three gloves there must be at least two left gloves or at least two right gloves". It is an example of a [[combinatorics|counting argument]]. This seemingly obvious statement can be used to demonstrate possibly unexpected results; for example, that there are two people in London who have the same number of hairs on their heads.

The first formalization of the idea is believed to have been made by [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] in 1834 under the name ''Schubfachprinzip'' ("drawer principle" or "shelf principle").  For this reason it is also commonly called '''Dirichlet's box principle''' or '''Dirichlet's drawer principle'''.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Miller, Peter Flor, Gunnar Berg, and Julio González Cabillón. "[http://jeff560.tripod.com/p.html Pigeonhole principle]". In Jeff Miller (ed.) ''[http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathword.html Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics]''. Electronic document, retrieved November 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This should not be confused with '''Dirichlet's principle''', a term introduced by [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]] that refers to the minimum principle for [[harmonic function]]s.  

The principle has several generalizations and can be stated in various ways. In a more quantified version: for [[natural number]]s &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;n = km + 1&lt;/math&gt; objects are distributed among &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; sets, then the pigeonhole principle asserts that at least one of the sets will contain at least &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt; objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|Patty|1987|loc=p. 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; For arbitrary &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; this generalizes to &lt;math&gt;k + 1 = \lfloor(n - 1)/m \rfloor + 1 = \lceil n/m\rceil,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\lfloor\cdots\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lceil\cdots\rceil&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[floor function|floor]] and [[ceiling function]]s, respectively.

Though the most straightforward application is to [[finite set]]s (such as pigeons and boxes), it is also used with [[infinite set]]s that cannot be put into [[one-to-one correspondence]].  To do so requires the formal statement of the pigeonhole principle, which is ''"there does not exist an [[injective function]] whose [[codomain]] is smaller than its [[domain (mathematics)|domain]]"''.  Advanced mathematical proofs like [[Siegel's lemma]] build upon this more general concept.

==Etymology==
[[Image:Pigeon-hole messagebox 3.jpg|thumb|Pigeon-hole messageboxes at [[Stanford University]], nearer to "Schubfach" than the more picturesque dovecotes]]

Dirichlet published his works in both French and German, using either the German ''[http://woerterbuchnetz.de/DWB/?sigle=DWB&amp;mode=Vernetzung&amp;lemid=GS18102#XGS18102 Schubfach]'' (he wrote about distributing pearls), or the French ''[[wikt:tiroir|tiroir]]''. The strict original meaning of both corresponds to the English ''[[wikt:drawer|drawer]]'', an ''open-topped box that can be slid in and out of the cabinet that contains it''. These terms were morphed to the word ''[[Pigeon-hole messagebox|pigeonhole]]'', standing for a ''small open space in a desk, cabinet, or wall for keeping letters or papers'', metaphorically rooted in the structures that house pigeons.

Since Dirichlet's father was a postmaster, and furniture with pigeonholes is commonly used for storing or sorting things into many categories (like letters in a post office or room keys in a hotel), the translation ''pigeonhole'' may be a perfect rendering of Dirichlet's metaphor. That understanding of the word, referring to some furniture features, is fading —especially among those who do not speak English natively but as a [[lingua franca]] in the scientific world— in favour of the more pictorial interpretation, literally involving pigeons and holes. The suggestive, though not misleading interpretation of "pigeonhole" as "dovecote" has lately found its way back to a German "re-translation" of the "pigeonhole"-principle as the "Taubenschlag"-principle.&lt;ref&gt;Diskrete Mathematik - Page 367
https://books.google.at/books?isbn=3833455292&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the original terms "Schubfach-Prinzip" in German&lt;ref&gt;The Induction Book - Page 13
https://books.google.at/books?isbn=0486811999&lt;/ref&gt; and "Principe de tiroirs" in French&lt;ref&gt;Mathematics Dictionary - Page 490
https://books.google.at/books?isbn=0412990415&lt;/ref&gt;, other literal translations are still in use in [[Polish language|Polish]] ("zasada szufladkowa"), [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ("принцип на чекмеджетата"), [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ("çekmece ilkesi"), [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ("skatulyaelv"), [[Italian language|Italian]] ("principio dei cassetti"), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ("ladenprincipe "), [[Danish language|Danish]] ("Skuffeprincippet"), [[Persian language|Persian]] ("اصل لانه کبوتری"), [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ("抽屉原理"), and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ("引き出し論法").

== Examples ==

=== Sock-picking ===
Assume a drawer contains a mixture of black socks and blue socks, each of which can be worn on either foot, and that you are pulling a number of socks from the drawer without looking. What is the minimum number of pulled socks required to guarantee a pair of the same color? Using the pigeonhole principle, to have at least one pair of the same color {{math|(''m'' {{=}} 2}} holes, one per color) using one pigeonhole per color, you need to pull only three socks from the drawer {{math|(''n'' {{=}} 3}} items). Either you have ''three'' of one color, or you have ''two'' of one color and ''one'' of the other.

=== Hand-shaking ===
If there are {{math|''n''}} people who can shake hands with one another (where {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}}), the pigeonhole principle shows that there is always a pair of people who will shake hands with the same number of people. In this application of the principle, the 'hole' to which a person is assigned is the number of hands shaken by that person. Since each person shakes hands with some number of people from 0 to {{math|''n'' &amp;minus; 1}}, there are {{math|''n''}} possible holes. On the other hand, either the '0' hole or the {{math|'''n'' &amp;minus; 1'}} hole or both must be empty, for it is impossible (if {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}}!) for some person to shake hands with everybody else while some person shakes hands with nobody. This leaves {{math|''n''}} people to be placed into at most {{math|''n'' &amp;minus; 1}} non-empty holes, so that the principle applies.

=== Hair-counting ===
We can demonstrate there must be at least two people in [[London]] with the same number of hairs on their heads as follows.&lt;ref&gt;To avoid a slightly messier presentation we assume that "people" in this example only refers to people who are not bald.&lt;/ref&gt; Since a typical human head has an [[average]] of around 150,000 hairs, it is reasonable to assume (as an upper bound) that no one has more than 1,000,000 hairs on their head {{math|(''m'' {{=}} 1 million}} holes). There are more than 1,000,000 people in London ({{math|''n''}} is bigger than 1&amp;nbsp;million items). Assigning a pigeonhole to each number of hairs on a person's head, and assign people to pigeonholes according to the number of hairs on their head, there must be at least two people assigned to the same pigeonhole by the 1,000,001st assignment (because they have the same number of hairs on their heads) (or, {{math|''n'' &gt; ''m''}}). For the average case ({{math|1=''m'' = 150,000}}) with the constraint: fewest overlaps, there will be at most one person assigned to every pigeonhole and the 150,001st person assigned to the same pigeonhole as someone else. In the absence of this constraint, there may be empty pigeonholes because the "collision" happens before we get to the 150,001st person. The principle just proves the existence of an overlap; it says nothing of the number of overlaps (which falls under the subject of [[probability distribution]]).

There is a passing, satirical, allusion in English to this version of the principle in ''A History of the Athenian Society'', prefixed to ""A Supplement to the Athenian Oracle: Being a Collection of the
Remaining Questions and Answers in the Old Athenian Mercuries"", (Printed for Andrew Bell, London, 1710).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=JCwUAAAAQAAJ&amp;q=mean+hairs&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that the question ''whether there were any two persons in the World that have an equal number of hairs on their head?'' had been raised in ''The Athenian Mercury'' before 1704.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=4QsUAAAAQAAJ&amp;q=sent+quarters&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=GG0PAAAAQAAJ&amp;q=town+eternity&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the first written reference to the pigeonhole principle appears in 1622 in a short sentence of the Latin work ''Selectæ Propositiones'', by the French Jesuit Jean Leurechon,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Benoit|last1=Rittaud|first2=Albrecht|last2=Heeffer|title=The Pigeonhole Principle, Two Centuries before Dirichlet|journal=Mathematical Intelligencer|volume=36|year=2014|issue=2|pages=27–29|doi=10.1007/s00283-013-9389-1|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/4115264/file/4115265.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he wrote "It is necessary that two men have the same number of hairs, écus, or other things, as each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Jean|last=Leurechon|title=Selecæe Propositiones in Tota Sparsim Mathematica Pulcherrimæ|year=1622|publisher=Gasparem Bernardum|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The birthday problem ===
The [[birthday problem]] asks, for a set of {{math|''n''}} randomly chosen people, what is the probability that some pair of them will have the same birthday? By the pigeonhole principle, if there are 367 people in the room, we know that there is at least one pair who share the same birthday, as there are only 366 possible birthdays to choose from (including February 29, if present). 
The birthday "paradox" refers to the result that even if the group is as small as 23 individuals, the probability that there is a pair of people with the same birthday is still above 50%. While at first glance this may seem surprising, it intuitively makes sense when considering that a comparison will actually be made between every possible pair of people rather than fixing one individual and comparing them solely to the rest of the group.

=== Team tournament ===
Imagine seven people who want to play in a tournament of teams {{math|(''n'' {{=}} 7}} items), with a limitation of only four teams {{math|(''m'' {{=}} 4}} holes) to choose from. The pigeonhole principle tells us that they cannot all play for different teams; there must be at least one team featuring at least two of the seven players: 
: &lt;math&gt; \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{m} \right\rfloor + 1 = \left\lfloor \frac{7-1}{4} \right\rfloor + 1 = \left\lfloor \frac64 \right\rfloor + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 &lt;/math&gt;

===Subset sum===
Any subset of size six from the set {{math|''S''}} = {1,2,3,...,9} must contain two elements whose sum is 10. The pigeonholes will be labelled by the two element subsets {1,9}, {2,8}, {3,7}, {4,6} and the singleton {5}, five pigeonholes in all. When the six "pigeons" (elements of the size six subset) are placed into these pigeonholes, each pigeon going into the pigeonhole that has it contained in its label, at least one of the pigeonholes labelled with a two element subset will have two pigeons in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimaldi|1994|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses and applications ==
The principle can be used to prove that any [[lossless compression]] algorithm, provided it makes some inputs smaller (as the name compression suggests), will also make some other inputs larger. Otherwise, the set of all input sequences up to a given length {{math|''L''}} could be mapped to the (much) smaller set of all sequences of length less than {{math|''L''}} without collisions (because the compression is lossless), a possibility which the pigeonhole principle excludes.

A notable problem in [[mathematical analysis]] is, for a fixed [[irrational number]] {{math|''a''}}, to show that the set {[{{math|''na'']: ''n''}} is an integer} of [[fractional part]]s is [[Dense-in-itself|dense]] in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. One finds that it is not easy to explicitly find integers {{math|''n'', ''m''}} such that {{math|{{!}}''na'' &amp;minus; ''ma''{{!}} &lt; ''e''}}, where {{math|''e'' &gt; 0}} is a small positive number and {{math|''a''}} is some arbitrary irrational number. But if one takes {{math|''M''}} such that {{math|1/''M'' &lt; ''e''}}, by the pigeonhole principle there must be {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; {1, 2, ..., ''M'' + 1}}} such that {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''}} and {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''a''}} are in the same integer subdivision of size {{math|1/''M''}} (there are only {{math|''M''}} such subdivisions between consecutive integers). In particular, we can find {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''}} is in {{math|(''p'' + ''k''/''M'', ''p'' + (''k'' + 1)/''M'')}}, and {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''a''}} is in {{math|(''q'' + ''k''/''M'', ''q'' + (''k'' + 1)/''M'')}}, for some {{math|''p'',&amp;nbsp;''q''}} integers and {{math|''k''}} in {{math|{0, 1, ..., ''M'' &amp;minus; 1}}}. We can then easily verify that {{math|(''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)''a''}} is in {{math|(''q'' &amp;minus; ''p'' &amp;minus; 1/''M'', ''q'' &amp;minus; ''p'' + 1/''M'')}}. This implies that {{math|[''na''] &lt; 1/''M'' &lt; ''e''}}, where {{math|1=''n'' = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{math|1=''n'' = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This shows that 0 is a limit point of {[{{math|''na''}}]}. We can then use this fact to prove the case for {{math|''p''}} in {{math|(0, 1]}}: find {{math|''n''}} such that {{math|[''na''] &lt; 1/''M'' &lt; ''e''}}; then if {{math|''p'' &amp;isin; (0, 1/''M''}}], we are done. Otherwise {{math|''p'' &amp;isin; (''j''/''M'', (''j'' + 1)/''M''}}], and by setting {{math|1=''k'' = sup{''r'' &amp;isin; ''N'' : ''r''[''na''] &lt; ''j''/''M''}}}, one obtains {{math|{{!}}[(''k'' + 1)''na''] &amp;minus; ''p''{{!}} &lt; 1/''M'' &lt; ''e''}}.

Variants occurring in well known proofs:
In the proof of the [[pumping lemma for regular languages]], a version that mixes finite and infinite sets is used: If infinitely many objects are placed into finitely many boxes, then there exist two objects that share a box.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Formal Languages and Automata'', Peter Linz, pp.&amp;nbsp;115–116, Jones and Bartlett Learning, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
In Fisk's solution of the [[Art gallery problem]] a sort of converse is used: If ''n'' objects are placed into ''k'' boxes, then there is a box containing at most ''n''/''k'' objects.&lt;ref&gt;''Computational Geometry in C'',  Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science, 2nd Edition, Joseph O'Rourke, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternate formulations ==
The following are alternate formulations of the pigeonhole principle.

#If {{math|''n''}} objects are distributed over {{math|''m''}} places, and if {{math|''n'' &gt; ''m''}}, then some place receives at least two objects.&lt;ref name=Herstein64 /&gt;
#(equivalent formulation of 1)  If {{math|''n''}} objects are distributed over {{math|''n''}} places in such a way that no place receives more than one object, then each place receives exactly one object.&lt;ref name=Herstein64 /&gt;
#If {{math|''n''}} objects are distributed over {{math|''m''}} places, and if {{math|''n'' &lt; ''m''}}, then some place receives no object.
#(equivalent formulation of 3)  If {{math|''n''}} objects are distributed over {{math|''n''}} places in such a way that no place receives no object, then each place receives exactly one object.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strong form==
Let {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} be positive integers. If
:&lt;math&gt;q_1 + q_2 + \cdots + q_n - n + 1&lt;/math&gt;
objects are distributed into {{math|''n''}} boxes, then either the first box contains at least {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} objects, or the second box contains at least {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} objects, ..., or the {{math|''n''}}th box contains at least {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brualdi|2010|page=74 Theorem 3.2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simple form is obtained from this by taking {{math|1=''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ... = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2}}, which gives {{math|''n'' + 1}} objects. Taking {{math|1=''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ... = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''}} gives the more quantified version of the principle, namely:

Let {{math|''n''}} and {{math|''r''}} be positive integers. If {{math|''n''(''r'' - 1) + 1}} objects are distributed into {{math|''n''}} boxes, then at least one of the boxes contains {{math|''r''}} or more of the objects.&lt;ref&gt;In the lead section this was presented with the substitutions {{math|1=''m'' = ''n''}} and {{math|1=''k'' = ''r'' − 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This can also be stated as, if {{math|''k''}} discrete objects are to be allocated to {{math|''n''}} containers, then at least one container must hold at least &lt;math&gt;\lceil k/n \rceil&lt;/math&gt; objects, where &lt;math&gt;\lceil x\rceil&lt;/math&gt; is the [[ceiling function]], denoting the smallest integer larger than or equal to {{math|''x''}}. 
Similarly, at least one container must hold no more than &lt;math&gt;\lfloor k/n \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; objects, where &lt;math&gt;\lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; is the [[floor function]], denoting the largest integer smaller than or equal to {{math|''x''}}.

== Generalizations of the pigeonhole principle ==

A probabilistic generalization of the pigeonhole principle states that if {{math|''n''}} pigeons are randomly put into {{math|''m''}} pigeonholes with uniform probability {{math|1/''m''}}, then at least one pigeonhole will hold more than one pigeon with probability

:&lt;math&gt;1 - \frac{(m)_n}{m^n}, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|(''m'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[falling factorial]] {{math|''m''(''m'' &amp;minus; 1)(''m'' &amp;minus; 2)...(''m'' &amp;minus; ''n'' + 1)}}. For {{math|1=''n'' = 0}} and for {{math|1=''n'' = 1}} (and {{math|''m'' &gt; 0}}), that probability is zero; in other words, if there is just one pigeon, there cannot be a conflict. For {{math|''n'' &gt; ''m''}} (more pigeons than pigeonholes) it is one, in which case it coincides with the ordinary pigeonhole principle. But even if the number of pigeons does not exceed the number of pigeonholes ({{math|''n'' ≤ ''m''}}), due to the random nature of the assignment of pigeons to pigeonholes there is often a substantial chance that clashes will occur. For example, if 2 pigeons are randomly assigned to 4 pigeonholes, there is a 25% chance that at least one pigeonhole will hold more than one pigeon; for 5 pigeons and 10 holes, that probability is 69.76%; and for 10 pigeons and 20 holes it is about 93.45%. If the number of holes stays fixed, there is always a greater probability of a pair when you add more pigeons. This problem is treated at much greater length in the [[birthday paradox]].

A further probabilistic generalization is that when a real-valued [[random variable]] {{math|''X''}} has a finite [[mean]] {{math|''E''(''X'')}}, then the probability is nonzero that {{math|''X''}} is greater than or equal to {{math|''E''(''X'')}}, and similarly the probability is nonzero that {{math|''X''}} is less than or equal to {{math|''E''(''X'')}}. To see that this implies the standard pigeonhole principle, take any fixed arrangement of {{math|''n''}} pigeons into {{math|''m''}} holes and let {{math|''X''}} be the number of pigeons in a hole chosen uniformly at random. The mean of {{math|''X''}} is {{math|''n''/''m''}}, so if there are more pigeons than holes the mean is greater than one. Therefore, {{math|''X''}} is sometimes at least 2.

== Infinite sets ==
The pigeonhole principle can be extended to [[infinite set]]s by phrasing it in terms of [[cardinal number]]s: if the cardinality of set {{mvar|A}} is greater than the cardinality of set {{mvar|B}}, then there is no injection from {{mvar|A}} to {{mvar|B}}. However, in this form the principle is [[tautology (logic)|tautological]], since the meaning of the statement that the cardinality of set {{mvar|A}} is greater than the cardinality of set {{mvar|B}} is exactly that there is no injective map from {{mvar|A}} to {{mvar|B}}. However, adding at least one element to a finite set is sufficient to ensure that the cardinality increases.

Another way to phrase the pigeonhole principle for finite sets is similar to the principle that finite sets are [[Dedekind finite]]: Let {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} be finite sets. If there is a surjection from {{mvar|A}} to {{mvar|B}} that is not injective, then no surjection from {{mvar|A}} to {{mvar|B}} is injective. In fact no function of any kind from {{mvar|A}} to {{mvar|B}} is injective. This is not true for infinite sets: Consider the function on the natural numbers that sends 1 and 2 to 1, 3 and 4 to 2, 5 and 6 to 3, and so on.

There is a similar principle for infinite sets: If uncountably many pigeons are stuffed into countably many pigeonholes, there will exist at least one pigeonhole having uncountably many pigeons stuffed into it.

This principle is not a generalization of the pigeonhole principle for finite sets however: It is in general false for finite sets. In technical terms it says that if {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} are finite sets such that any surjective function from {{mvar|A}} to {{mvar|B}} is not injective, then there exists an element of {{mvar|b}} of {{mvar|B}} such that there exists a bijection between the preimage of {{mvar|b}} and {{mvar|A}}. This is a quite different statement, and is absurd for large finite cardinalities.

==Quantum mechanics==
[[Yakir Aharonov]] et al. have presented arguments that the pigeonhole principle may be violated in [[quantum mechanics]], and proposed [[Interferometry|interferometric]] experiments to test the pigeonhole principle in quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{DOI|10.1073/pnas.1522411112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RSVP''' is a process for a response from the invited person or people. It is an [[Acronym and initialism|initialism]] derived from the [[French language|French]] phrase '''''Répondez s'il vous plaît''''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.linternaute.com/dictionnaire/fr/definition/rsvp/|title=Rsvp : Définition simple et facile du dictionnaire|website=www.linternaute.com|language=fr|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "Please respond" to require confirmation of an invitation. The initialism "RSVP"  is no longer used much in France, where it is considered formal and old-fashioned (if not totally unknown by most French people). In French, the complete sentence "Répondez s'il vous plaît"  gives the impression the speaker is begging for an answer. In France, it is now more common to use "Réponse attendue avant le...", meaning "[Your] answer is expected before...". In addition, the French initialism "SVP" is frequently used to represent "s'il vous plaît" ("please").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.linternaute.com/dictionnaire/fr/definition/svp/|title=Svp : Définition simple et facile du dictionnaire|website=www.linternaute.com|language=fr|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== RSVP, regrets only==

The phrase "RSVP, regrets only", or simply "Regrets only", is a popular modern variation that implies "if you do not reply, that will be taken as an acceptance."

More specifically, if most invitations can be assumed to be accepted, a "regrets only" RSVP will reduce the communication required by both the host and their guests. The phrase "Regrets only" refers to the assumption that a declination will be worded with some variation of "We regret we cannot attend...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.announcingit.com/how_to/RSVP_vs_Regrets_Only.htm |title=RSVP vs. Regrets Only |website=www.announcingit.com |series=Invitation Do's and Don'ts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Save the date cards==
Prior to sending the RSVP invitation, the host may mail out a "save the date" card to advise the date and location of the celebration. This may be used when the event will be held a considerable time in the future and/or in a distant location to allow for travel plans, for such events as a wedding, christening, or any other important event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emilypost.com/weddings/new-times-new-traditions/368-21st-century-wedding-trends|title=Invitation Etiquette|publisher=The Emily Post Institute, Inc.|accessdate=2012-06-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620042020/http://www.emilypost.com/weddings/new-times-new-traditions/368-21st-century-wedding-trends|archivedate=2012-06-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RSVP please==
In recent years, the use of RSVP in the English language has spread outside of the discourse of highly formal correspondence and commonly figures in group emails. In this context, the acronym seems to have loosened its tie to its original meaning and is often understood simply as an abbreviation for "reply". Some writers therefore routinely use the phrase "RSVP please",{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} which is a case of [[RAS syndrome]] or a [[pleonasm]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8356">'''Real-Time Object-Oriented Modeling''' ('''ROOM''') is a [[domain specific language]].

ROOM was developed in the early 1990s for modeling [[Real-time system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lehmanns.de/shop/mathematik-informatik/226929-9780471599173-real-time-object-oriented-modeling Summary of the book "Real-Time Object-Oriented Modeling"]&lt;/ref&gt; The initial focus was on [[telecommunication]]s, even though ROOM can be applied to any event-driven real-time system.

ROOM was supported by [[ObjecTime Developer]] (commercial) and is now implemented by the official [[List of Eclipse projects|Eclipse project]] [[eTrice]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclipse.org/etrice eTrice - ROOM Open Source Tool]&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Unified Modeling Language#UML 2.x|UML2]] was defined (version 2 of [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] with real time extensions), many elements of ROOM were taken over.

== Concepts and Key Notions of ROOM ==

ROOM is a modeling language for the definition of software systems. It allows the complete [[automatic programming|code generation]] for the whole system from the model. ROOM comes with a textual as well as with a graphical notation.
Typically the generated code is accompanied with manually written code, e.g. for graphical user interfaces ([[GUI]]).
The code is compiled and linked against a runtime library which provides base classes and basic services (e.g. messaging).

ROOM describes a software system along three dimensions: structure, behavior and inheritance. The following sections will explain these three aspects in more detail.

=== Structure ===

The structural view in ROOM is composed of ''actors'' or ''capsules''. Actors can communicate with each other using ''ports''. Those ports are connected by ''bindings''. Actors do [[message passing|exchange messages]] [[asynchronous communication|asynchronously]] via ports and bindings.
To each port a unique ''protocol'' is assigned. A protocol in ROOM defines a set of outgoing and a set of incoming messages.
Ports can be connected with a binding if they belong to the same protocol and are conjugate to each other. That means that one port is sending the outgoing messages of the protocol and receiving the incoming ones. This port is called the ''regular'' port.
Its peer port, the ''conjugated'' port, receives the outgoing messages and sends the incoming ones of the protocol.
In other words, a port is the combination of a ''required'' and a ''provided interface'' in a ''role'' (since one and the same protocol can be used by several ports of an actor).

[[File:Structure of AnActorClass.jpg|thumb|Example of a structure diagram]]

An actor can contain other actors (as a [[object composition|composition]]). In ROOM these are called ''actor references'' or ''actor refs'' for short.
This allows to create structural hierarchies of arbitrary depth.

The actor's ports can be part of its interface (visible from the exterior) or part of its structure (used by itself) or both.
Ports that are part of the interface only are called ''relay ports''.
They are directly connected to a port of a sub actor (they are delegating to the sub actor).
Ports that are part of the structure only are called ''internal end ports''.
Ports that belong to both, structure and interface, are called ''external end ports''.

=== Behavior ===

Each actor in ROOM has a behavior which is defined by means of a hierarchical [[finite-state machine]], or just state machine for short.
A state machine is a [[directed graph]] consisting of nodes called ''states'' and edges called ''transitions''.
State transitions are triggered by incoming messages from an internal or external end port.
In this context the messages sometimes are also called ''events'' or ''signals''.
If a transition specifies a certain ''trigger'' then it is said to ''fire'' if the state machine is in the source state of the transition and a message of the type specified by the trigger arrives. Afterwards the state is changed to the target state of the transition.

[[File:ROOM Behavior Diagram.jpg|thumb|ROOM behavior diagramm (state machine as a state chart)]]

During the state change certain pieces of code are executed. The programmer (or modeler) can attach them to the states and transitions.
In ROOM this code is written in the so called ''detail level language'', usually the target language of the code generation.
A state can have ''entry code'' and ''exit code''. During a state change first the exit code of the source state is executed.
Then the ''action code'' of the firing transition is executed and finally the entry code of the target state.
A typical part of those codes is the sending of messages through ports of the actor.

State machines in ROOM also have a graphical notation similar to the [[UML state machine|UML state charts]]. An example is shown in the diagram in this section.

A state machine can also have a hierarchy in the sense that states can have sub state machines. Similar to the structure this can be extended to arbitrary depth.
For details of the semantics of hierarchical state machines we refer to the original book.&lt;ref&gt;Bran Selic, Garth Gullekson, Paul T. Ward: "Real-Time Object-Oriented Modeling", New York, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, 1994, {{ISBN|978-0-471-59917-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important concept in the context of state machines is the execution model of ''run-to-completion''. That means that an actor is processing a message completely before it accepts the next message. Since the run-to-completion semantics is guaranteed by the execution environment, the programmer/modeler doesn't have to deal with classical thread synchronization. And this despite the fact that typical ROOM systems are highly concurrent because of the asynchronous communication.
And maybe its worth to stress that the asynchronous nature of ROOM systems is not by accident but reflects the inherent asynchronicity of e.g. the machine being controlled by the software. Definitely this requires another mind set than the one that is needed for functional programming of synchronous systems.
But after a short while of getting accustomed it will be evident that asynchronously communicating state machines are perfectly suited for control software.

=== Inheritance ===

Like other [[object-oriented programming|object oriented programming languages]] ROOM uses the concept of [[class (computer programming)|classes]].
Actors are classes which can be instantiated as [[object-oriented programming|objects]] several times in the system.
Of course each instance of an actor class is in its own state and can communicate with other instances of the same (and other) classes.

Similar to other modern programming languages ROOM allows [[inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]] of actor classes.
It is a single inheritance as an actor class can be derived from another actor class (its ''base class'').
It inherits all features of the base class like ports and actor refs, but also the state machine.
The derived actor class can add further states and transitions to the inherited one.

=== Layering ===

A last powerful concept of ROOM is ''layering''. This notion refers to the vertical layers of a software system consisting of services and their clients. ROOM introduces the notions of ''service access point (SAP)'' for the client side and ''service provision point (SPP)'' for the server side. From the point of view of an actor implementation the SAPs and SPPs work like ports. Like ports they are associated with a protocol. But other than ports they don't have to (and even cannot) be bound explicitly.
Rather, an actor is bound to a concrete service by a ''layer connection'' and this binding of a service is propagated recursively to all sub actors of this actor.
This concept is very similar to [[dependency injection]].

The '''red grouse''', ''Lagopus lagopus scotica'', is a medium-sized bird of the [[grouse]] family which is found in [[Calluna|heather]] [[moorland]] in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. It is usually classified as a subspecies of the [[willow ptarmigan]] but is sometimes considered to be a separate species, ''Lagopus scotica''. It is also known as the '''moorcock''', '''moorfowl''' or '''moorbird'''. ''Lagopus'' is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc-Latn|lagos}} ({{lang|grc|λαγος}}), meaning "[[hare]]", + {{lang|grc-Latn|pous}} ({{lang|grc|πους}}), "foot", in reference to the feathered feet and toes typical of this cold-adapted genus, and ''scoticus'' is "of Scotland".&lt;ref name= job90&gt;{{cite book | last= Jobling | first= James A | year= 2010| title= The Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names | publisher = Christopher Helm | location = London | isbn = 978-1-4081-2501-4 |pages =217, 351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The red grouse is widely known as the logo of [[The Famous Grouse]] [[whisky]] and an animated bird is a character in a series of its adverts. The red grouse is also the emblem of the journal ''[[British Birds (magazine)|British Birds]]''.

==Description==
The red grouse is differentiated from the [[willow ptarmigan]] and [[rock ptarmigan]] by its plumage being reddish brown, and not having a white winter plumage. The tail is black and the legs are white. There are white stripes on the underwing and red combs over the eye. Females are less reddish than the males and have less conspicuous combs. Young birds are duller and lack the red combs.

Birds in Ireland are sometimes thought to belong to a separate subspecies ''L. l. hibernica''. They are slightly paler than those in Britain and the females have yellower plumage with more finely barred underparts. This may be an adaptation to [[camouflage]] them in moorland with higher grass and sedge content and less heather.

It is identified by its {{'}}''chut!chut!chut!chut!chut!chuttt....''{{'}} call, or the {{'}}''Goback, goback, goback''{{'}} vocalisation. The wings make a whirring sound when the bird is disturbed from a resting place.

Grouse populations display periodic cycling, where the population builds up to very high densities only to crash a few years later, and then recover. The main driver of this cyclic pattern is thought to be the parasitic [[nematode]] worm ''[[Trichostrongylus tenuis]]''.

However, in his book,&lt;ref&gt;Wynne Edwards, V. C. ''Evolution through Group Selection'' 1986 Blackwell Scientific Publications Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; [[V. C. Wynne-Edwards]] suggests that the primary reason for mortality in grouse population is [[homeostasis]] depending largely on food availability and that the 'Grouse disease', due to the parasitic worm ''Trichostrongylus tenuis'' is a mistaken diagnosis of the after effects of social exclusion.

==Distribution and habitat==
The red grouse is [[endemism in birds|endemic]] to the [[British Isles]]; it has developed in isolation from other subspecies of the willow ptarmigan which are widespread in northern parts of [[Eurasia]] and North America.

It is found across most parts of [[Scotland]], including [[Orkney]], [[Shetland]] and most of the [[Outer Hebrides]]. They are only absent from urban areas, such as in the [[Central Belt]].

In Wales there are strong populations in places but their range has retracted. They are now largely absent from the far south, their main strongholds being [[Snowdonia]], the [[Brecon Beacons]] and the [[Cambrian Mountains]]. There are reports of Welsh birds crossing the [[Bristol Channel]] to [[Exmoor]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In [[England]] it is mainly found in the north – places such as the [[Lake District]], [[Northumberland]], [[County Durham]], much of [[Yorkshire]], the [[Pennines]] and the [[Peak District]], as far south as the [[Staffordshire Moorlands]]. There is an isolated introduced population on [[Dartmoor]], and overspill Welsh birds visit the [[Shropshire Hills]] such as [[Long Mynd]], where they breed. The Exmoor population would now appear to be extinct, with the last birds sighted as recently as 2005. An introduced population in [[Suffolk]] died out by the early 20th century, though a population on [[Cannock Chase]] in [[Staffordshire]] lasted longer.

In Ireland it is found locally in most parts of the country: it is commonest in [[County Mayo|Mayo]], where the population is increasing,&lt;ref&gt;''Irish Birds'' Vol. 8 (2005-6) p.258&lt;/ref&gt; and on the [[County Antrim|Antrim]] plateau, with other healthy populations in the [[Slieve Bloom]] mountains and the [[Knockmealdown]] mountains;&lt;ref&gt;''Irish Birds'' Vol.9 (2009) p.74&lt;/ref&gt; a few pairs still breed in south [[County Dublin]].

The small population in the [[Isle of Man]] is mostly concentrated in the southern hills but conservation work is ongoing throughout the uplands to ensure the species' continued viability.

Its typical habitat is upland heather moors away from trees. It can also be found in some low-lying bogs and birds may visit farmland during hard weather.

The British population is estimated at about 250,000 pairs with around 1–5,000 pairs in Ireland. Numbers have declined in recent years and birds are now absent in areas where they were once common. Reasons for the decline include loss of heather due to [[overgrazing]], creation of new [[conifer]] [[plantation]]s and a decline in the number of upland gamekeepers. Some predators such as the [[hen harrier]] feed on grouse and there is ongoing controversy as to what effect these have on grouse numbers.

Red grouse have been introduced to the [[Hautes Fagnes]] region of [[Belgium]] but the population there died out in the early 1970s.

==Behaviour==

===Diet===
The red grouse is herbivorous and feeds mainly on the shoots, seeds and flowers of heather. It will also feed on berries, [[cereal]] crops and sometimes insects.

===Breeding===
The birds begin to form pairs during the autumn and males become increasingly territorial as winter progresses. The nest is a shallow scrape up to 20&amp;nbsp;cm across which is lined with vegetation. About six to nine eggs are laid, mainly during April and May. They are oval, glossy and pale yellow with dark brown blotches. The eggs are incubated for 19 to 25 days, the chicks can fly after 12 to 13 days after hatching and are fully grown after 30 to 35 days.

==Conservation==
[[Member States of the European Union]] are obliged by virtue of Council Directive 2009/147/EC&lt;ref&gt;Codified version, replacing Council Directive 79/409/EC&lt;/ref&gt; on the conservation of wild birds (popularly called the Birds Directive) to take the requisite measures for the protection of the red grouse; but as it is a species to which Annex II of the Directive applies, Article 7 permits hunting under national law, provided population levels are not threatened as a result. In 2002 Ireland was found by the [[European Court of Justice]] to be in breach of its obligations under the earlier Directive to protect the red grouse, in that it had allowed a crucial breeding ground to become degraded through overgrazing by sheep.&lt;ref&gt;Case C-117/00 ''Commission v Ireland'' Judgement of 13 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation measures taken on foot of the judgment have seen the population in the area double from 400 to 800.

==As a game bird==
{{see also|Driven grouse shooting}}
[[Image:Heather burning.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Controlled burning of heather, on a Derbyshire grouse moor]]
The red grouse is considered a game bird and is shot in large numbers during the shooting season which traditionally starts on August 12, known as the [[Glorious Twelfth]]. There is a keen competition among some London restaurants to serve freshly killed grouse on August 12, with the birds being flown from the moors and cooked within hours.

[[File:Grouse grit.jpg|thumb|left|Grouse grit]]
Shooting can take the form of 'walked up' (where shooters walk across the moor to flush grouse and take a shot) or '[[Driven grouse shooting|driven]]' (where grouse are driven, often in large numbers, by 'beaters' towards the guns who are hiding behind a line of 'butts'). Many moors are managed to increase the density of grouse. Areas of heather are subjected to controlled burning; this allows fresh young shoots to regenerate, which are favoured by the grouse. Extensive predator control, including illegal killing of raptors,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snh.org.uk/pdfs/publications/commissioned_reports/982.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is a feature of grouse moor management: foxes, stoats and crows are usually heavily controlled on grouse moors. The extent to which it occurs on grouse moors is hotly contested between conservation groups and shooting interests, and the subject generates a lot of media attention in relation to grouse moors and shooting.

In recent decades the practice of using medicated grit and direct dosing of birds against an endoparasite, the strongyle worm or threadworm (''[[Trichostrongylus tenuis]]''), has become part of the management regime on many moors.

== As food ==
The flavour of grouse, like most game birds, develops if the bird is hung for a few days after shooting and before eating. [[Roast]]ing is the most common way to cook a grouse.

''[[The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie]]'' (1909) has 11 recipes for using grouse. The recipe "To cook old birds" runs as follows:&lt;ref name=Tillypronie&gt;{{cite book | title=The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie | publisher=Constable and Co. | year=1909| author=Frere, Catherine Frances (arranged and edited by)|pages=142–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Old grouse are not fit for cooking till the feathers pull very loosely from the "apron". When "high", put a piece of bread inside them while roasting; take out the bread before dishing, and throw it away. A good gravy should be served with them in a boat, none in the dish, but put the birds on a toast when bread is plentiful.|Lady Clark of Tillypronie&lt;ref name=Tillypronie/&gt;}}

==Scientific study==
Because of their economic and social importance and some interesting aspects of their biology, red grouse have been widely studied. They were the subject of some of the earliest studies of population biology in birds, as detailed in '' The Grouse in Health and in Disease'' by [[Simon Fraser, 14th Lord Lovat|Lord Lovat]] in 1911. Since the mid-20th century they have been subject to ongoing study by many organisations and individuals. Much work has been conducted by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology in the eastern [[Cairngorms]], and by the [[Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust]] in the Central Highlands. There are a wide range of research activities still going on today and a wealth of published literature exists on all aspects of grouse biology.

==Parasites and viruses==

The red grouse may be infected by parasites and viruses which severely affect populations. [[Strongylosis]] or 'grouse disease' is caused by the [[strongyle worm]], which induces damage and internal bleeding after burrowing into the [[cecum]]. This [[endoparasite]] is often eaten with the tops of young [[Calluna|heather]] shoots and can lead to mortality and poor condition, including a decrease in the bird's ability to control the scent it emits.

[[Louping ill virus]] is a [[flavivirus]] (RNA virus), also known as sheep encephalomyelitis virus. Flaviviruses are transmitted by arthropods, and louping ill virus is transmitted by ticks. In red grouse, this virus can cause mortality as high as 78%.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2004" /&gt; The main tick vector is the sheep tick ''[[Ixodes ricinus]]''. Although traditionally tick-borne diseases are thought to be caused when the parasite bites its host, it has been shown that red grouse chicks can be affected when they eat ticks with which they come into contact.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gilbert | first1 = L. | last2 = Jones | first2 = L.

'''''Resistance, Politics, and the American Struggle for Independence, 1765–1775''''' is a book that examines the role of nonviolent struggle in the period before the [[American Revolution]]. Edited by Walter H. Conser, Jr., Ronald M. McCarthy, [[David J. Toscano]] and [[Gene Sharp]], the book was published in the United States in 1986. It argues that the [[Stamp Act]] resistance and other campaigns from 1765 to 1775 were fundamental for shaping the outcome of the struggle for American independence, and were not merely a "prelude" to armed conflict.

Nonviolent resistance was at the heart of these campaigns, but key features of this nonviolence have been largely neglected by historians. To fill this perceived gap, the book provides a sustained narrative of the 1765–1775 resistance, followed by a set of interpretive essays aimed to provoke further discussion and inquiry. Six hypothetical explanations are offered for why the colonists shifted to military struggle, despite the considerable success of nonviolent struggle.
Reviews have appeared in several historical and legal journals.&lt;ref name=mills88/&gt;&lt;ref name=ireland88/&gt;&lt;ref name=roeber91/&gt;

==Origins==
''Resistance, Politics, and the American Struggle for Independence, 1765–1775'' (''RPASI''), claims that most historians of [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial America]] have treated the events of 1765–1775 as merely a "prelude"&lt;ref name=rpasi&gt;{{cite book

to the [[American Revolutionary War|US Revolutionary War]]. Events such as the resistance to the [[Stamp Act]] and [[Townshend Acts]] are typically treated as "not significant in themselves."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|ix}}
This book, however

{{Quote|questions this assumption and suggests that these forms of resistance&amp;mdash;primarily nonviolent ones&amp;mdash;pursued by the American colonists from 1765 to 1775 were of fundamental importance themselves for the outcome of the struggle for independence, shaping the growth of new political, economic, and social institutions which could sustain truly independent self-government.&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|ix}}}}

In their preface, the editors state that their interest in the historical period covered in ''RPASI'' began in the 1970s, when they were studying [[nonviolent resistance|nonviolent action]] as a pragmatic tool of civilian struggle. In their work, they
{{Gene Sharp}}

{{Quote|discovered a large number of events in [[Colonial history of the United States|American colonial history]] - [[boycott]]s, nonimportation, noncooperation, and [[protest]] demonstrations of many kinds - all of which could be described as examples of nonviolent action [and] the incidence and success... seemed so significant that we were surprised that the subject had received so little attention. Although many scholars have described the decade in great detail, the richness and importance of the nonviolent activity was lost because of their emphasis on a seemingly inevitable rush toward war.&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|ix}}}}

[[File:SamuelAdamsSmall.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=.35|alt=Samuel Adams portrait closeup|&amp;ldquo;I beseech you... to avoid Blood and Tumult.... Nothing can ruin us but our Violence.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;[[Samuel Adams]], 1774.&lt;ref name=samadams1774&gt;Quoted on page v of ''RPASI''. In a letter from [[Samuel Adams]] to  James Warren, 21 May 1774.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Indeed, "researchers often look throughout the length of a period for evidence of what they regard as its inevitable outcome... for example... for the roots of war.... In the process, they... may ignore the contributions of alternative means to the outcome."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|17}} An example is that "[[Samuel Adams]], whom many... associate with the tactics of violence, issued numerous statements prior to [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]] opposing the use of armed force"&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|17}} (see quote at left).

The book project was originally conceived due to recognition by co-editor [[Gene Sharp]], a leading scholar of nonviolent struggle, that the American colonists had "employed the techniques of nonviolent resistance" &lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|xi}} in their struggle against Great Britain.&lt;ref name=sharpthank&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The preface states that Sharp "has been unfailingly helpful in the other editors' attempt to understand the significance of these actions and has been centrally responsible for placing this work within the context of contemporary Anglo-American scholarship. Editors Conser, McCarthy, and [[David J. Toscano|Toscano]] wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge their great debt to [[Gene Sharp]] and his efforts to make the work as complete and rigorous as possible|''RPASI'', p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The book was sponsored by [[Harvard University]]'s Center for International Affairs, and by the [[Albert Einstein Institution]],&lt;ref&gt;"A book from the Program on Nonviolent Sanctions in Conflict and Defense, Center for International Affairs, [[Harvard University]] and the [[Albert Einstein Institution]]" (''RPASI'', p. ii).&lt;/ref&gt; both led by Sharp. 
The editors claim that the book "if read carefully, is likely to spark scholarly controversy and argument," and that they "believe that such debate can clarify the issues... and enhance the understanding of this critical decade in our history."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|x}}

''Resistance, Politics, and the American Struggle for Independence, 1765-1775'' contains 14 chapters that are intended to "relate integrally to one another and provide a complete narrative of the period [of 1765-1775]."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|x}} These chapters are listed in the table at right.

After the first introductory chapter, the next 7 chapters contain the book's "narrative section,"&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|17}} which focuses on describing the struggles from 1765 to 1775 chronologically, using the "terminology of the day,"&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|17}} and only "rarely [making] use of the term &amp;lsquo;nonviolent action.&amp;rsquo;"&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|17}}
The book's final 6 chapters are analytical, offering interpretations of the decade's events. These chapters address questions raised in the narrative section, and also suggest areas for future research.

Basic concepts are introduced in Chapter 1, which gives an overview of the three main resistance campaigns of 1765 to 1775 opposing the [[Stamp Act of 1765|Stamp Act]] of 1765, the [[Townsend Acts]] of 1767, and the [[Intolerable Acts|Coercive Acts]] of 1774. Nonviolent action is described as a technique that operates to bring about change through serving to "manipulate the shared social, cultural, economic and political system in which the opposing parties engage in conflict."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|15}} Citing Sharp's ''[[Politics of Nonviolent Action]]'', they divide methods of nonviolent action into the three categories of ''nonviolent protest and persuasion'', ''noncooperation'', and ''nonviolent intervention''. Nonviolent action succeeds by "rendering the opponent's sources of power unusable, unworkable, and uncontrollable,"&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|16}} through mechanisms that may include conversion, accommodation, or "nonviolent coercion [that] occurs when an opponent is forced against his or her will to grant the actionists' demands."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|16}}

{{Quote|The most dramatic use of nonviolent intervention on the part of the colonists is found in their creation of new governmental bodies such as the provincial congresses and conventions. By receiving overwhelming support from the populace, these extralegal bodies and their local counterparts effectively replaced the Crown's established government in the colonies.&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|15}}}}

The editors argue (Ch. 1) that previous scholarship has overlooked "the degree to which the colonists used a kind of 'weapons system' that operated without force of arms or violence in trying to compel the British government to change its policies."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|4}} Viewed from this angle, commercial resistance (nonimportation) is analyzed closely (Ch. 9). It is apparent that the colonists' skill in applying the methods of nonviolent struggle "improved greatly over the decade," as did the "intellectual underpinnings"&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|19}} of their resistance (Chs. 10, 11).

Still, at the close of the decade, the nonviolent movement was abandoned in favor of military resistance, and the editors discuss six alternative hypothetical explanations for why this shift occurred (Ch. 12; see table at right). The hypothetical explanations are not meant as mutually exclusive, but as "avenues for fruitful inquiry."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|453}} Indeed,

{{Quote|The editors believe that definitive conclusions are premature at this time and await the future efforts of skillful scholars sensitive to the issues raised in this volume. What actually went on in the "minds and hearts" of the colonists... will always be difficult to assess [but] the historical record is present for serious examination.&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|453}}}}

[[John Adams]] (quoted above right), who lived through and helped lead the independence struggle, claimed that "The revolution was... substantially effected before hostilities commenced."&lt;ref name=johnadams1815/&gt; McCarthy (Ch. 14) argues that "independence in many of the colonies had essentially been achieved prior to the commencement of military hostilities at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]]."&lt;ref name=rpasi/&gt;{{rp|20}}

In the ''[[Journal of Southern History]]'', Mills wrote of ''RPASI'' that "Although the work covers familiar ground, the approach is fresh and the treatment is stimulating. The interpretative theme is certain to provoke debate."&lt;ref name=mills88/&gt;{{rp|314}}
He added that "The criticisms one might make of this study are cosmetic (e.g., the considerable variations in the sizes of several chapters) rather than substantive."&lt;ref name=mills88/&gt;{{rp|314}}

In the ''[[Journal of American History]]'', Ireland commended the historical essays as shedding light on important aspects of the American Revolution, stating that "having them collected together in one place is useful."&lt;ref name=ireland88/&gt;{{rp|242}} He was critical of most chapters by the editors as "much less valuable,"&lt;ref name=ireland88/&gt;{{rp|242}} and came away feeling "that I have missed the point, or that there is no point here of any great moment for a historian."&lt;ref name=ireland88/&gt;{{rp|243}}

In ''Law and History Review'', Roeber wrote that ''RPASI'' "includes stimulating essays by ten authors, four British,"&lt;ref name=roeber91/&gt;{{rp|164}} and

{{Quote|The British contributors... present an image of British domestic tactics of resistance, and ministerial policy on the use of the military that is quite striking.... an impressive documentation of what one might call an eighteenth-century British ethic of restraint, both on the part of aggrieved complainants, and authorities faced with fractious subjects.&lt;ref name=roeber91/&gt;{{rp|164}}}}

But in the American colonial frontier, "military tactics were acknowledged by all to be more vicious than those employed in European conflicts."&lt;ref name=roeber91/&gt;{{rp|165}} Thus, for Roeber, "One comes away from this rich and stimulating series of essays with the disturbing sense that Americans had, at the very time of the Republic's founding, been swept up on a tide of violent resistance that fit with their colonial frontier experience."&lt;ref name=roeber91/&gt;{{rp|165}}

Mills wrote that "One can hope that the challenge to conduct more research into the period from 1774 to 1775 and the shift from nonviolent to violent action will be heeded."&lt;ref name=mills88/&gt;{{rp|314}}

'''Romance''' is an [[Emotion|emotional]] [[Feeling#Emotion work|feeling]] of [[love]] for, or a [[Interpersonal attraction|strong attraction]] towards, [[Other (philosophy)|another]] [[person]], and the [[Courtship|courtship behaviors]] undertaken by an individual to express those overall feelings and resultant emotions.

Although the [[Psychophysiology|emotions and sensations]] of ''romantic love'' are widely associated with [[sexual attraction]], romantic feelings can exist without expectation of [[Consummation|physical consummation]] and be subsequently expressed. [[History|Historically]], the [[Terminology|term]] ''romance'' originates with the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] of [[chivalry]] as set out in the literature of [[chivalric romance]].

== General definitions ==
Romantic love is a [[Relativism|relative]] term{{when defined as|date=September 2018}} that distinguishes moments and situations within [[intimate relationship]]s as contributing to a deepened relational connection.

#Anthropologist [[Charles Lindholm]] defined love as "an intense attraction that involves the idealization of the other, within an erotic context, with expectation of enduring sometime into the future".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, D.

=== Historical usage ===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
The word "romance" comes from the French [[vernacular]] where initially it indicated a [[Narrative poetry|verse narrative]].  The word was originally an adverb of Latin origin, "romanicus," meaning "of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] style". European medieval vernacular tales, [[Epic poetry|epics]], and [[Ballad|ballads]] generally dealt with chivalric adventure, not bringing in the concept of [[love]] until late into the seventeenth century.

The word ''romance'' developed other meanings, such as the early nineteenth century Spanish and Italian definitions of "adventurous" and "passionate," which could intimate both "love affair" and "idealistic quality."

[[File:Codex Manesse Bernger von Horheim.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Bernger von Horheim]] in the ''Codex Manesse'' (early 14th century)]]
[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] show that there were complex forms of courtship in ancient as well as contemporary primitive societies. There may not be evidence, however, that members of such societies formed loving relationships distinct from their established customs in a way that would parallel modern romance.&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss pioneered the scientific study of the betrothal of cross cousins in such societies, as a way of solving such technical problems as the [[avunculate]] and the [[incest taboo]] (''Introducing Lévi-Strauss''), pp. 22–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 18th century, many marriages were not arranged, but rather developed out of more or less spontaneous relationships. After the 18th century, illicit relationships took on a more independent role. In bourgeois marriage, illicitness may have become more formidable and likely to cause tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nordan dayal wiki|url=http://nordan.daynal.org/wiki/index.php?title=Romance|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Ladies of the Leisure Class'', [[Rutgers University]] professor Bonnie G. Smith depicts courtship and marriage rituals that may be viewed as oppressive to modern people. She writes "When the young women of the Nord married, they did so without illusions of love and romance. They acted within a framework of concern for the reproduction of bloodlines according to financial, professional, and sometimes political interests." Subsequent [[sexual revolution]] has lessened the conflicts arising out of liberalism, but not eliminated them.

[[Anthony Giddens]], in his book ''The Transformation of Intimacy: Sexuality, Love and Eroticism in Modern Society'', states that romantic love introduced the idea of a narrative into an individual's life. He adds that telling a story was one of the meanings of romance. According to Giddens, the rise of romantic love more or less coincided with the emergence of the [[novel]]. It was then that romantic love, associated with freedom and therefore the ideals of romantic love, created the ties between freedom and [[self-realization]].

David R. Shumway, in his book ''Romance, Intimacy, and The Marriage Crisis'', states that the discourse of intimacy emerged in the last third of the 20th century and that this discourse claimed to be able to explain how marriage and other relationships worked. For the discourse of intimacy emotional closeness was much more important than [[Passion (emotion)|passion]]. This does not mean by any means that intimacy is to replace romance. On the contrary, intimacy and romance coexist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KdVa73vN1BgC&amp;dq=modern+love+by+David+R.+Shumway&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title=Romance, Intimacy, and The Marriage Crisis|accessdate= 2010-07-08|isbn=978-0-8147-9831-7|author1=Shumway, David R|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 21st century has seen the growth of [[globalization]] and people now live in a world of transformations that affect almost every aspect of our lives, and love has not been the exception. One example of the changes experienced in relationships was explored by Giddens regarding [[homosexual]] relationships. According to Giddens since homosexuals were not able to marry they were forced to pioneer more open and negotiated relationships. These kinds of relationships then permeated the heterosexual population.

Shumway also states that together with the growth of [[capitalism]] the older social relations dissolved, including marriage. Marriage meaning for women changed as they had more socially acceptable alternatives and were less willing to accept unhappy relations and, therefore, divorce rates substantially increased.

The discourse of romance continues to exist today together with intimacy. Shumway states that on the one hand, romance is the part that offers [[adventure]] and intense emotions while offering the possibility to find the perfect mate. On the other hand, intimacy offers deep communication, [[friendship]], and long lasting sharing.

=== Popularization of love ===
The conception of romantic love was popularized in [[Western culture]] by the concept of [[courtly love]]. [[Knight|Chevaliers]], or knights in the [[Middle Ages]], engaged in what were usually non-physical and non-marital relationships with women of nobility whom they served. These relations were highly elaborate and ritualized in a complexity that was steeped in a framework of tradition, which stemmed from theories of etiquette derived out of [[chivalry]] as a moral code of conduct.

Courtly love and the notion of [[domnei]] were often the subjects of [[troubadours]], and could be typically found in artistic endeavors such as lyrical narratives and poetic prose of the time. Since [[marriage]] was commonly nothing more than a formal arrangement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/courtly-love.htm Middle Ages.com - Courtly Love]&lt;/ref&gt; courtly love sometimes permitted expressions of emotional closeness that may have been lacking from the union between husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~delahoyd/medieval/love.html Courtly Love and the origins of romance]&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of courtly love, "lovers" did not necessarily refer to those engaging in [[Human sexual activity|sexual]] acts, but rather, to the act of caring and to emotional intimacy.

The bond between a knight and his [[Lady]], or the woman of typically high stature of whom he served, may have escalated psychologically but seldom ever physically.&lt;ref name="employees.oneonta.edu"&gt;[http://employees.oneonta.edu/farberas/ARTH/arth214_folder/courtly_love_.html A History of Women: Silences of the Middle Ages]&lt;/ref&gt; For [[knighthood]] during the Middle Ages, the intrinsic importance of a code of conduct was in large part as a value system of rules codified as a guide to aid a knight in his capacity as champion of the downtrodden, but especially in his service to the Lord.

In the context of dutiful service to a woman of high social standing, ethics designated as a code were effectively established as an institution to provide a firm moral foundation by which to combat the idea that unfit attentions and affections were to ever be tolerated as "a secret game of trysts" behind closed doors. Therefore, a knight trained in the substance of "chivalry" was instructed, with especial emphasis, to serve a lady most honorably, with purity of heart and mind. To that end, he committed himself to the welfare of both Lord and Lady with unwavering discipline and devotion, while at the same time, presuming to uphold core principles set forth in the code by the religion by which he followed.&lt;ref name="employees.oneonta.edu"/&gt;

Religious meditations upon the [[Virgin Mary]] were partially responsible for the development of chivalry as an ethic and lifestyle:  the concept of the honor of a lady and knightly devotion to her, coupled with an obligatory respect for all women, factored prominently as central to the very identity of medieval knighthood. As knights were increasingly emulated, eventual changes were reflected in the inner-workings of [[feudal]] society. Members of the [[aristocracy]] were schooled in the principles of chivalry, which facilitated important changes in attitudes regarding the value of women.&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: K-P'' by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1994 {{ISBN|0-8028-3783-2}} page 272&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviorally, a knight was to regard himself towards a lady with a transcendence of premeditated thought—his virtue ingrained within his character. A [[Knight|chevalier]] was to conduct himself always graciously, bestowing upon her the utmost courtesy and attentiveness. He was to echo shades of this to all women, regardless of class, age, or status.&lt;ref name=sweeney&gt;[[James Ross Sweeney]] (1983). "Chivalry", in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', Volume III.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the concept of chivalry and the notion of the courtly [[gentleman]] became synonymous with the ideal of how love and romance should exist between the sexes. Through the timeless popularization in art and literature of tales of knights and princesses, kings and queens, a formative and long standing (sub)consciousness helped to shape relationships between men and women.

[[De amore (Andreas Capellanus)|De amore]] or ''The Art of Courtly Love'', as it is known in English, was written in the 12th century. The text is widely misread as permissive of extramarital affairs. However, it is useful to differentiate the physical from without: romantic love as separate and apart from [[courtly love]] when interpreting such topics as: "Marriage is no real excuse for not loving", "He who is not jealous cannot love", "No one can be bound by a double love", and "When made public love rarely endures".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astro.umd.edu/~marshall/chivalry.html The Art of Courtly Love by Andreas Capellanus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123205411/http://www.astro.umd.edu/~marshall/chivalry.html |date=2010-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that romantic love evolved independently in multiple cultures. For example, in an article presented by Henry Grunebaum, he argues "[[Psychotherapy|therapists]] mistakenly believe that romantic love is a [[phenomenon]] unique to Western cultures and first expressed by the troubadours of the Middle Ages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1752-0606.1997.tb01037.x | volume=23 | title=THINKING ABOUT ROMANTIC/EROTIC LOVE | year=1997 | journal=Journal of Marital and Family Therapy | pages=295–307 | last1 = Grunebaum | first1 = Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more current and Western traditional terminology meaning "court as lover" or the general idea of "romantic love" is believed to have originated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, primarily from that of the French culture. This idea is what has spurred the connection between the words "romantic" and "lover", thus [[neologism|coining]] English phrases for romantic love such as "loving like the Romans do". The precise origins of such a connection are unknown, however. Although the word "romance" or the equivalents thereof may not have the same connotation in other cultures, the general idea of "romantic love" appears to have crossed cultures and been accepted as a concept at one point in time or another.

== Types ==
Romantic love is contrasted with [[platonic love]], which in all usages, precludes sexual relations, yet only in the modern usage does it take on a fully [[nonsexual]] sense, rather than the classical sense, in which sexual drives are sublimated. [[Sublimation (psychology)|Sublimation]] tends to be forgotten in casual thought about love aside from its emergence in psychoanalysis and Nietzsche.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[Unrequited love]] can be romantic in different ways: comic, tragic, or in the sense that sublimation itself is comparable to romance, where the spirituality of both art and [[egalitarian]] ideals is combined with strong character and emotions. Unrequited love is typical of the period of [[romanticism]], but the term is distinct from any romance that might arise within it.&lt;ref&gt;Beethoven, however, is the case in point. He had brief relationships with only a few women, always of the nobility. His one actual engagement was broken off mainly because of his conflicts with noble society as a group. This is evidenced in his biography, such as in Maynard Solomon's account.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romantic love may also be classified according to two categories, "popular romance" and "divine or spiritual" romance:

;Popular romance: may include but is not limited to the following types: idealistic, normal intense (such as the emotional aspect of "[[falling in love]]"), predictable as well as unpredictable, consuming (meaning consuming of time, energy and emotional withdrawals and bids), intense but out of control (such as the aspect of "falling out of love") material and commercial (such as societal gain mentioned in a later section of this article), physical and sexual, and finally grand and demonstrative.
;Divine (or spiritual) romance: may include, but is not limited to these following types: realistic, as well as plausible unrealistic, optimistic as well as pessimistic (depending upon the particular beliefs held by each person within the relationship.), abiding (e.g. the theory that each person had a predetermined stance as an agent of choice; such as "choosing a husband" or "choosing a soul mate."), non-abiding (e.g. the theory that we do not choose our actions, and therefore our romantic love involvement has been drawn from sources outside of ourselves), predictable as well as unpredictable, self-control (such as obedience and sacrifice within the context of the relationship) or lack thereof (such as disobedience within the context of the relationship), emotional and personal, soulful (in the theory that the mind, soul, and body, are one connected entity), intimate, and infinite (such as the idea that love itself or the love of a [[god]] or God's "unconditional" love is or could be everlasting)&lt;ref&gt;Romance In Marriage: Perspectives, Pitfalls, and Principles, by Jason S. Carroll http://ce.byu.edu/cw/cwfamily/archives/2003/Carroll.Jason.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== In philosophy ==
=== Plato ===
[[File:Eros bow Musei Capitolini MC410.jpg|thumb|Roman copy of a Greek sculpture by [[Lysippus]] depicting [[Eros]], the Greek personification of romantic love]]

Greek philosophers and authors have had many theories of love. Some of these theories are presented in [[Plato]]'s ''Symposium''. Six Athenian friends, including Socrates, drink wine and each give a speech praising the [[deity]] [[Eros]]. When his turn comes, [[Aristophanes]] says in his [[myth]]ical speech that sexual partners seek each other because they are descended from beings with spherical torsos, two sets of human limbs, genitalia on each side, and two faces back to back. Their three forms included the three permutations of pairs of gender (i.e. one masculine and masculine, another feminine and feminine, and the third masculine and feminine) and they were split by the gods to thwart the creatures' assault on heaven, recapitulated, according to the comic playwright, in other myths such as the [[Aloadae]].&lt;ref&gt;''Symposium 189d ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

This story is relevant to modern romance partly because of the image of reciprocity it shows between the sexes. In the final speech before [[Alcibiades]] arrives, [[Socrates]] gives his encomium of love and desire as a lack of being, namely, the being or form of [[beauty]].

=== René Girard ===

Though there are many theories of romantic love—such as that of [[Robert Sternberg]], in which it is merely a mean combining liking and [[sexual desire]]—the major theories involve far more insight. For most of the 20th century, Freud's theory of the family drama dominated theories of romance and sexual relationships. This gave rise to a few counter-theories. Theorists like Deleuze counter Freud and [[Jacques Lacan]] by attempting to return to a more naturalistic philosophy:

[[René Girard]] argues that romantic attraction is a product of [[jealousy]] and rivalry—particularly in a [[love triangle|triangular form]].

Girard, in any case, downplays romance's individuality in favor of [[jealousy]] and the [[love triangle]], arguing that romantic attraction arises primarily in the observed attraction between two others. A natural objection is that this is [[circular reasoning]], but Girard means that a small measure of attraction reaches a critical point insofar as it is caught up in [[mimesis]]. Shakespeare's ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', ''As You Like It'', and ''The Winter's Tale'' are the best known examples of competitive-induced romance.&lt;ref&gt;In works such as ''A Theatre of Envy'' and ''Things Hidden Since the Foundation of The World'', Girard presents this mostly original theory, though finding a major precedent in Shakespeare on the structure of rivalry, claiming that it—rather than Freud's theory of the primal horde—is the origin of religion, ethics, and all aspects of sexual relations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Girard's theory of mimetic desire is controversial because of its alleged [[sexism]]. This view has to some extent supplanted its predecessor, Freudian Oedipal theory. It may find some spurious support in the supposed attraction of women to aggressive men. As a technique of attraction, often combined with irony, it is sometimes advised that one feign toughness and disinterest, but it can be a trivial or crude idea to promulgate to men, and it is not given with much understanding of mimetic desire in mind. Instead, cultivating a spirit of self-sacrifice, coupled with an attitude of appreciation or contemplation, directed towards the other of one's attractions, constitutes the ideals of what we consider to be true romantic love. Mimesis is always the desire to possess, in renouncing it we offer ourselves as a sacrificial gift to the other.&lt;ref&gt;Things Hidden from the Foundation of the World, Rene Girard, Stanford University Press, 1978, pp. 283–350.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mimetic desire is often challenged by [[feminists]], such as [[Toril Moi]],&lt;ref&gt;The Missing Mother: The Oedipal Rivalries of René Girard. Toril Moi, Diacritics Vol. 12, No. 2, Cherchez la Femme Feminist Critique/Feminine Text (Summer, 1982), pp. 21–31&lt;/ref&gt; who argue that it does not account for the woman as inherently desired.

Though the centrality of rivalry is not itself a cynical view, it does emphasize the mechanical in love relations. In that sense, it does resonate with [[capitalism]] and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] native to post-modernity. Romance in this context leans more on fashion and irony, though these were important for it in less emancipated times. [[Sexual revolution]]s have brought change to these areas. Wit or irony therefore encompass an instability of romance that is not entirely new but has a more central social role, fine-tuned to certain modern peculiarities and subversion originating in various social revolutions, culminating mostly in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;A contemporary irony toward romance is perhaps the expression "throwing game" or simply game. In Marxism the romantic might be considered an example of alienation.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arthur Schopenhauer ===

The process of courtship also contributed to [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s pessimism, despite his own romantic success,&lt;ref&gt;''Essays and Aphorisms''&lt;/ref&gt; and he argued that to be rid of the challenge of courtship would drive people to suicide with boredom. Schopenhauer theorized that individuals seek partners who share certain interests and tastes, while at the same time looking for a "complement" or completing of themselves in a partner, as in the [[cliché]] that "opposites attract", but with the added consideration that both partners manifest this attraction for the sake of the species:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But what ultimately draws two individuals of different sex exclusively to each other with such power is the will-to-live which manifests itself in the whole species, and here anticipates, in the individual that these two can produce, an objectification of its true nature corresponding to its aims. 
—''World as Will and Representation'', Volume 2, Chapter XLIV&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Other philosophers ===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
Later modern philosophers such as [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|La Rochefoucauld]], [[David Hume]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] also focused on [[morality]], but desire was central to French thought and Hume himself tended to adopt a French worldview and temperament. Desire in this milieu meant a very general idea termed "the passions", and this general interest was distinct from the contemporary idea of "passionate" now equated with "romantic". Love was a central topic again in the subsequent movement of [[Romanticism]], which focused on such things as absorption in nature and the [[absolute (philosophy)|absolute]], as well as [[Platonic love|platonic]] and unrequited love in German philosophy and literature.

French philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] linked this idea of love as a lack mainly to [[Sigmund Freud]], and Deleuze often criticized it.

== In literature ==
[[File:DickseeRomeoandJuliet.jpg|thumb|upright|Archetypal lovers [[Romeo and Juliet]] portrayed by [[Frank Bernard Dicksee|Frank Dicksee]]]]

Shakespeare and [[Søren Kierkegaard]] share a similar viewpoint that marriage and romance are not harmoniously ''in tune'' with each other. In Shakespeare's ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', for example, "...there has not been, nor is there at this point, any display of affection between Isabella and the Duke, if by affection we mean something concerned with sexual attraction. The two at the end of the play love each other as they love virtue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nathan | first1 = Norman | year = 1956 | title = The Marriage of Duke Vincentio and Isabella | url = | journal = Shakespeare Quarterly | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 43–45 | doi=10.2307/2866112}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', in saying "all combined, save what thou must combine By holy marriage", [[Romeo]] implies that it is not marriage with Juliet that he seeks but simply to be joined with her romantically.

Kierkegaard addressed these ideas in works such as ''Either/Or'' and ''[[Stages on Life's Way]]'':
{{quote|''In the first place, I find it comical that all men are in love and want to be in love, and yet one never can get any illumination upon the question what the lovable, i.e., the proper object of love, really is.''
— ''Stages'', p. 48}}
In ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', British writer [[Iain King]] tried to establish rules for romance  applicable across most cultures.  He concluded on six rules, including:
# Do not flirt with someone unless you might mean it.
# Do not pursue people who you are not interested in, or who are not interested in you.
# In general, express your affection or uncertainty clearly, unless there is a special reason not to.&lt;ref&gt;''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time: Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong]]'', 2008, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tragedy and other social issues ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
The "tragic" contradiction between romance and society is most forcibly portrayed in literature, in Tolstoy's ''[[Anna Karenina]]'', in Flaubert's ''[[Madame Bovary]]'', and [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. The female protagonists in such stories are driven to suicide as if dying for a cause of freedom from various oppressions of marriage.

Even after sexual revolutions, on the other hand, to the extent that it does not lead to procreation (or child-rearing, as it also might exist in [[same-sex marriage]]), romance remains peripheral though it may have virtues in the relief of [[Stress (physics)|stress]], as a source of inspiration or adventure, or in development and the strengthening of certain social relations. It is difficult to imagine the tragic heroines, however, as having such practical considerations in mind.

Romance can also be tragic in its conflict with society. The [[Tolstoy]] family focuses on the romantic limitations of marriage, and [[Anna Karenina]] prefers death to being married to her fiancé, however this is because she is tired of waiting and being hidden away from public, when her fiance makes failed attempts to get his mother's approval of the marriage. Even being aristocrats did not make them both free, as the society was nevertheless equally binding for all. Furthermore, in the speech about marriage that is given in Kierkegaard's ''[[Either/Or]]'', Kierkegaard attempts to show that it is because marriage is lacking in passion fundamentally, that the nature of marriage, unlike romance, is explainable by a man who has experience of neither marriage nor love.

Reciprocity of the sexes appears in the ancient world primarily in myth where it is in fact often{{when|date=July 2018}} the subject of tragedy, for example in the myths of [[Theseus]] and [[Atalanta]]. Noteworthy female freedom or power was an exception rather than the rule, though this is a matter of speculation and debate.

== Psychology ==
{{cleanup|date=September 2018|reason=Very awkward prose. No indication why the cited authors are significant.}}
Many theorists attempt to analyze the process of romantic love.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Anthropologist [[Helen Fisher (anthropologist)|Helen Fisher]], in her book ''Why We Love'',&lt;ref&gt;Helen Fisher, 2004, "Why We Love" Henry Holt and Company LLC, 175 Fifth Ave. New York, NY 10010, {{ISBN|0-8050-7796-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses brain scans to show that love is the product of a chemical reaction in the brain. [[Norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]], among other brain chemicals, are responsible for excitement and bliss in humans as well as non-human animals. She is famous{{peacock term|date=September 2018}} for the use of MRI to study the brain activity of a person "in love", discovering the importance of the [[ventral tegmental area]] and the [[caudate nucleus]]{{jargon inline|date=September 2018}} in this biological drive. Fisher concludes that these reactions have a genetic basis, and therefore love is a natural drive as powerful as hunger.

In his book ''What Women Want, What Men Want'',&lt;ref&gt;John Townsend, 1998, "What Women Want, What Men Want" Oxford University Press, United Kingdom {{ISBN|978-0-19-511488-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; anthropologist John Townsend takes the genetic basis of love one step further by identifying how the sexes are different in their predispositions. Townsend's compilation of various research projects concludes that men are susceptible to youth and beauty, whereas women are susceptible to status and security. These differences are part of a natural selection process where males seek many healthy women of childbearing age to mother offspring, and women seek men who are willing and able to take care of them and their children.

Psychologist Karen Horney in her article "The Problem of the Monogamous Ideal",&lt;ref&gt;Karen Horney, 1967, "Feminine Psychology," W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., New, York, NY {{ISBN|0-393-31080-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that the overestimation of love leads to disillusionment; the desire to possess the partner results in the partner wanting to escape; and the friction against sex result in non-fulfillment. Disillusionment plus the desire to escape plus non-fulfillment result in a secret hostility, which causes the other partner to feel alienated. Secret hostility in one and secret alienation in the other cause the partners to secretly hate each other. This secret hate often leads one or the other or both to seek love objects outside the marriage or relationship.

Psychologist Harold Bessell in his book ''The Love Test'',&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bessell, 1984 "The Love Test," Warner Books, 666 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10103, {{ISBN|0-446-32582-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; reconciles the opposing forces noted by the above researchers and shows that there are two factors that determine the quality of a relationship. Bessell proposes that people are drawn together by a force he calls "romantic attraction", which is a combination of genetic and cultural factors. This force may be weak or strong and may be felt to different degrees by each of the two love partners. The other factor is "emotional maturity", which is the degree to which a person is capable of providing good treatment in a love relationship. It can thus be said that an immature person is more likely to overestimate love, become disillusioned, and have an affair whereas a mature person is more likely to see the relationship in realistic terms and act constructively to work out problems.

Romantic love, in the abstract sense of the term, is traditionally considered to involve a mix of emotional and sexual desire for another as a [[person]]. However, [[Lisa M. Diamond]], a [[University of Utah]] [[psychology]] professor, proposes that sexual desire and romantic love are functionally independent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that romantic love is not intrinsically oriented to same-gender or other-gender partners. She also proposes that the links between love and desire are bidirectional as opposed to unilateral. Furthermore, Diamond does not state that one's sex has priority over another sex (a male or female) in romantic love because her theory suggests{{according to whom|date=September 2018}} it is as possible for someone who is [[homosexual]] to fall in love with someone of the other gender as for someone who is [[heterosexual]] to fall in love with someone of the same gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Martie Haselton, a psychologist at [[UCLA]], considers romantic love a "commitment device" or mechanism that encourages two humans to form a lasting bond. She has explored the evolutionary rationale that has shaped modern romantic love and has concluded that long-lasting relationships are helpful to ensure that children reach reproductive age and are fed and cared for by two parents. Haselton and her [[colleagues]] have found evidence in their experiments that suggest love's [[adaptation]]. The first part of the [[experiment]]s consists of having people think about how much they love someone and then suppress thoughts of other attractive people. In the second part of the experiment the same people are asked to think about how much they sexually desire those same partners and then try to suppress thoughts about others. The results showed that love is more efficient in pushing out those rivals than [[sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1704665,00.html| title=Romance Is An Illusion|date=2008-01-17|accessdate= 2010-07-08 | work=Time | first=Carl | last=Zimmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by the University of Pavia{{who|date=September 2018}} suggests that romantic love lasts for about a year (similar to [[limerence]]) before being replaced by a more stable, non-passionate "[[companionate love]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4478040.stm | work=BBC News | title=Romantic love 'lasts just a year' | date=2005-11-28 | accessdate=2010-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In companionate love, changes occur from the early stage of love to when the relationship becomes more established and romantic feelings seem to end. However, research from Stony Brook University in New York suggests that some couples keep romantic feelings alive for much longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/01/04/true.love.found/index.html | work=CNN | title=Scientists: True love can last a lifetime | accessdate=2010-04-10 | date=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attachment patterns===

[[Attachment styles]] that people develop as children can influence the way that they interact with partners in adult relationships, with secure attachment styles being associated with healthier and more trusting relationships than avoidant or anxious attachment styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ainsworth|first=M|title=Infant-mother attachments|journal=American Psychologist|year=1979|volume=34|issue=10|pages=932–937|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.34.10.932|pmid=517843}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simpson|first=J|title=Influence of attachment styles on romantic relationships|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1990|volume=59|issue=5|pages=971–980|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.5.971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazen and Shaver found that adult romantic attachment styles were similar to the categories of secure, avoidant, and anxious that had previously been studied in children’s attachments to their caregivers, demonstrating that attachment styles are stable across the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hazen|first=C|author2=Shaver, P |title=Romantic love conceptualized as an attachment process|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1987|volume=52|issue=3|pages=511–524|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.3.511|pmid=3572722}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, researchers distinguished between dismissive avoidant attachment and fearful avoidant attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartholomew|first=K|author2=Horowitz, L |title=Attachment styles among young adults: a test of a four-category model|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1991|volume=61|issue=2|pages=226–244|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.2.226|pmid=1920064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have found that secure adult attachment, leading to the ability for intimacy and confidence in relationship stability, is characterized by low attachment-related anxiety and avoidance, while the fearful style is high on both dimensions, the dismissing style is low on anxiety and high on avoidance, and the preoccupied style is high on anxiety and low on avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=K|author2=Clark, C |author3=Shaver, P |title=Self-report measurement of adult attachment.

=== Romantic love definition/operationalization ===
Singer (1984a,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Irving|title=The Nature of Love: Vol. 1. Plato to Luther|year=1984|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1984b,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Irving|title=The Nature of Love: Vol. 2.

The modern world|year=1987|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;) first defined love based on four [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] terms: ''eros'', meaning the search for beauty; ''philia'', the feelings of affection in close friendships, ''nomos'', the submission of and obedience to higher or divine powers, and ''agape'', the bestowal of love and affection for the divine powers. While Singer did believe that love was important to world culture, he did not believe that romantic love played a major role (Singer, 1987&lt;ref name="Singer 1987"/&gt;). However, Susan Hendrick and Clyde Hendrick at Texas Tech University (1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hendrick|first=S.

S. |editor=S. J. Lopez &amp; C. R.  Snyder}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have theorized that romantic love will play an increasingly important cultural role in the future, as it is considered an important part of living a fulfilling life. They also theorized that love in long-term romantic relationships has only been the product of cultural forces that came to fruition within the past 300 years. By cultural forces, they mean the increasing prevalence of individualistic ideologies, which are the result of an inward shift of many cultural worldviews.

=== Passionate and companionate love ===
Researchers have determined that romantic love is a complex emotion that can be divided into either passionate or companionate forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brogaard|first=B.|title=On Romantic Love|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berscheid and Walster (1978&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berscheid|first=E.|title=Interpersonal Attraction (2nd ed.)|year=1978|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=Reading, MA|author2=Walster, E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Hatfield (1988&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hatfield|first=E.|title=The Psychology of Love|year=1988|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|pages=191–217|editor=R. J. Sternberg &amp; M. I. Barnes|chapter=Passionate and companionate love}}&lt;/ref&gt;) found that these two forms can co-exist, either simultaneously or intermittently. Passionate love is an arousal-driven emotion that often gives people extreme feelings of happiness, and can also give people feelings of anguish.{{cn|date=April 2018}} Companionate love is a form that creates a steadfast bond between two people, and gives people feelings of peace. Researchers have described the stage of passionate love as "being on cocaine", since during that stage the brain releases the same neurotransmitter, dopamine, as when cocaine is being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ansari|first1=Aziz|last2=Klinenberg|first2=Eric|title=Modern Romance|date=2015|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=9781594206276|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also estimated that passionate love (as with [[limerence]]) lasts for about twelve to eighteen months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ansari|first1=Aziz|last2=Klinenberg|first2=Eric|title=Modern Romance|date=2015|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=9781594206276|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Firestone, a psychologist, has a theory of the fantasy bond, which is what is mostly created after the passionate love has faded. A couple may start to feel really comfortable with each other to the point that they see each other as simply companions or protectors, but yet think that they are still in love with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Firestone|first1=Robert|title=The Fantasy Bond: A substitute for a truly loving relationship|url=http://www.psychalive.org/the-fantasy-bond-substitute-for-a-loving-relationship/|website=PSYCHALIVE|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results to the fantasy bond is the leading to companionate love. 
Hendrick and Hendrick (1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hendrick|first=S. S.|author2=Hendrick, C. |title=Gender differences and similarities in sex and love|journal=Personal Relationships|year=1995|volume=2|issue=1|pages=55–65|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1995.tb00077.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;) studied college students who were in the early stages of a relationship and found that almost half reported that their significant other was their closest friend, providing evidence that both passionate and companionate love exist in new relationships. Conversely, in a study of long-term marriages, researchers (Contreras, Hendrick, and Hendrick, 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Contreras|first=R.|author2=Hendrick, S. S. |author3=Hendrick, C. |title=Perspectives of Marital Love and Satisfaction in Mexican American and Anglo-American Couples|journal=Journal of Counseling &amp; Development|year=1996|volume=74|issue=4|pages=408–415|doi=10.1002/j.1556-6676.1996.tb01887.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;) found that couples endorsed measures of both companionate love and passionate love and that passionate love was the strongest predictor of marital satisfaction, showing that both types of love can endure throughout the years.

=== The triangular theory of love ===
Psychologist Robert Sternberg (1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sternberg|first=R. J.|title=A Triangular Theory of love|journal=Psychological Review|year=1986|volume=93|pages=119–135|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.93.2.119}}&lt;/ref&gt;) developed the [[triangular theory of love]]. He theorized that love is a combination of three main components: passion (physical arousal); intimacy (psychological feelings of closeness); and commitment (the sustaining of a relationship). He also theorized that the different combinations of these three components could yield up to seven different forms of love. These include popularized forms such as romantic love (intimacy and passion) and consummate love (passion, intimacy, and commitment). The other forms are liking (intimacy), companionate love (intimacy and commitment), empty love (commitment), fatuous love (passion and commitment), and infatuation (passion).
Studies on Sternberg’s theory love found that intimacy most strongly predicted marital satisfaction in married couples, with passion also being an important predictor (Silberman, 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silberman|first=S.|title=The relationships among love, marital satisfaction and duration of marriage|journal=Doctoral dissertation, Arizona State University|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;). On the other hand, Acker and Davis (1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acker|first=M.|author2=Davis, M. H. |title=Intimacy, passion and commitment in adult romantic relationships: A test of the triangular theory of love|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|year=1992|volume=9|issue=1|pages=21–50|doi=10.1177/0265407592091002}}&lt;/ref&gt;) found that commitment was the strongest predictor of relationship satisfaction, especially for long-term relationships.

=== The self-expansion theory of romantic love ===
Researchers Arthur and Elaine Aron (1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aron|first=A.|title=Love and the expansion of self: Understanding attraction and satisfaction|year=1986|publisher=Hemisphere|location=New York|author2=Aron, E. N. }}&lt;/ref&gt;) theorized that humans have a basic drive to expand their self-concepts. Further, their experience with Eastern concepts of love caused them to believe that positive emotions, cognitions, and relationships in romantic behaviors all drive the expansion of a person’s self-concept. A study following college students for 10 weeks showed that those students who fell in love over the course of the investigation reported higher feelings of self-esteem and self efficacy than those who did not (Aron, Paris, and Aron, 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aron|first=A.|author2=Paris, M. |author3=Aron, E. N. |title=Falling in love: Prospective studies of self-concept change|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1995|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1102–1112|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.6.1102}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Mindful relationships ===
Harvey and Ormarzu (1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harvey|first=J. H.|author2=Ormarzu, J. |title=Minding the close relationship|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|year=1997|volume=1|pages=223–239|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0103_3|pmid=15659351}}&lt;/ref&gt;) developed a model of minding relationships with five key components: seeking to know and be known by the other; using knowledge learned in a relationship to enhance the relationship; accepting the other person; being motivated to continue this process of learning, enhancing, and accepting; and developing a sense of appreciation in the relationship. Each of these components is considered adaptive, however, nonadaptive steps to minding a relationship were also theorized by the research team. The five nonadaptive components include: one or both partners out of step in seeking to know and be known by the other; not using the knowledge learned in a relationship to enhance the relationship (or using that knowledge to hurt the other); low acceptance and respect for the other person; not being motivated to continue the process of learning, enhancing, and accepting; and failing to develop a sense of appreciation in a relationship. Gottman studies the components of a flourishing romantic relationship have been studied in the lab (1994;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottman|first=J. M.|title=What predicts divorce?: The relationship between marital processes and marital outcomes|year=1994|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gottman &amp; Silver, 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottman|first=J. M.|title=The seven principles for making marriage work|year=1999|publisher=Random House LLC.|location=New York|author2=Silver, N. }}&lt;/ref&gt;). He used physiological and behavioral measures during couples’ interactions to predict relationship success and found that five positive interactions to one negative interaction are needed to maintain a healthy relationship. He established a therapy intervention for couples that focused on civil forms of disapproval, a culture of appreciation, acceptance of responsibility for problems, and self-soothing (Gottman, Driver, &amp; Tabares, 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottman|first=J. M.|title=Clinical Handbook of Couple Therapy, 3rd Edition|year=2002|publisher=Guilford PRess|location=New York|author2=Driver, J. |author3=Tabares, A. |editor=A. S. Gurman and N. S. Jacobson|chapter=Building the Sound Marital House: An empirically-derived couple therapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Relationship behaviors ===
The most recent{{cn|date=April 2018}} research on romantic love and relationships focuses on behaviors that either sustain a relationship or aid in its dissolution. These behaviors can be considered either appetitive or aversive. Appetitive relationship processes are considered the promotion of positive relationship behaviors, as determined by psychologists Gable and Reis (2001,&lt;ref name="Gable 2001 169–194"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gable|first=S. L.|title=Close romantic relationships: Maintenance and Enhancement|year=2001|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=169–194|author2=Reis, H. T. |editor=J. Harvey &amp; A. Wenzel|chapter=Appetitive and aversive social interaction}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2003&lt;ref name="Gable 2003 349–372"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gable|first=S. L.|author2=Reis, H. T. |author3=Elliot, A. J. |title=Evidence for bivariate systems: An empirical test of appetition and aversion across domains|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|year=2003|volume=37|issue=5|pages=349–372|doi=10.1016/s0092-6566(02)00580-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Aversive relationship processes are described as eliminating behaviors that have a negative effect on relationships (Gable and Reis 2001,&lt;ref name="Gable 2001 169–194"/&gt; 2003&lt;ref name="Gable 2003 349–372"/&gt;). This new research has also allowed relationship success to be predicted as a function of these appetitive and aversive processes. This is all related to research that shows that sharing positive life events with one’s partner is related to greater relationship satisfaction and intimacy (Gable et al., 2004&lt;ref name="Gable 2004 511–524"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gable|first=S. L.|author2=Reis, H. T. |author3=Impett, E. A. |author4=Asher, E. R. |title=What do you do when things go right? The intrapersonal and interpersonal benefits of sharing positive events|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2004|volume=87|issue=2|pages=511–524 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.2.228 |pmid=15301629}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In research by Gable et al. (2003) appetitive (promotion of positive relationship behaviors) and aversive (elimination of negative relationship behaviors) processes are independent constructs. A specific type of appetitive processing, capitalization, leads to increased relationship satisfaction and intimacy when one member of the relationship tells the other about positive life events and receive quality reactions and feedback from the partner (Gable, Reis, Impett, &amp; Asher, 2004&lt;ref name="Gable 2004 511–524"/&gt;).

==Physiology==
Researchers such as Feeney and Noller question the stability of attachment style across the life span since studies that measured attachment styles at time points ranging from 2 weeks to 8 months found that 1 out of 4 adults' attachment style changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feeney|first=J|author2=Noller, P |title=Adult Attachment|year=1996|publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a study by Lopez and Gormley found that attachment styles could change during the first year of college and that changes to more secure attachment styles were associated with adjustments in self-confidence ratings and coping styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lopez|first=F|author2=Gormley, B |title=Stability and change in adult attachment style over the first-year college transition: Relations to self-confidence, coping, and distress patterns|journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology|year=2002|volume=49|issue=3|pages=355–364|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.49.3.355}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, attachment styles in childhood mirror the ones found in adult romantic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=N|author2=Reads, S |title=Adult attachment, working models, and relationship quality in dating couples|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1990|volume=58|issue=4|pages=644–663|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.4.644}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, research has shown that building interpersonal connections strengthens neural regulatory systems that are involved in emotions of empathy, enjoyment of positive social events, and stress management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schore|first=A|title=Affect regulation and the origin of the self: The neurobiology of emotional development|year=1994|publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=S|author2=Dickerson, S. |author3=Klein, L. |title=oward a biology of social support|journal=Handbook of positive psychology|year=2002|pages=556–569}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing evidence that early social interactions affect adult relationships.

Another topic of controversy in the field of romantic relationships is that of [[domestic abuse]]. Following the theory that romantic love evolved as a byproduct of survival, it can be said that in some instances, it has turned into a [[maladaptation]]. [[Oxytocin]] is a neurophysical hormone produced in the brain. It is known to cause a decrease in stress response. It also can cause an increase in feelings of [[attachment theory|attachment]]. In the beginning stages of a romantic relationship, OT levels surge and then remain relatively stable over the duration of the relationship. The higher the surge of OT, the greater the likelihood is of partners staying together.&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, J., Caetano, R., &amp; Clark, C. L. (1998). Rates of intimate partner violence in the United States. American journal of public health, 88(11), 1702-1704.&lt;/ref&gt; It plays an important role in increasing positive interpersonal behaviors such as trust, altruism, empathy, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kosfeld | first1 = M. | last2 = Heinrichs | first2 = M. | last3 = Zak | first3 = P. J. | last4 = Fischbacher | first4 = U. | last5 = Fehr | first5 = E. | year = 2005 | title = Oxytocin increases trust in humans | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = 7042| pages = 673–676 | doi=10.1038/nature03701 | pmid=15931222}}&lt;/ref&gt; This response is not universal and can in fact, cause the opposite to occur depending on environment and individual. Individuals ranked high in [[rejection sensitivity]] exhibited aggressive tendencies and decreased willingness for cooperation, indicating a link between oxytocin and relationship maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;Bartz, J., Simeon, D., Hamilton, H., Kim, S., Crystal, S., Braun, A., ... &amp; Hollander, E. (2010). Oxytocin can hinder trust and cooperation in borderline personality disorder. Social cognitive and affective neuroscience, nsq085.&lt;/ref&gt;

The feelings associated with romantic love function to ensure the greater reproductive fitness of individuals. The obligations of individuals in romantic relationships to preserve these bonds are based in [[kin selection]] theory, where by exhibiting aggressive behavior, a mate can use intimidation and [[dominance (ethology)|dominance]] to ward off other potential predators, thus protecting the pair bond and their actual or potential offspring. This has however evolved to the point where it has become detrimental to the fitness of individuals; what is causing attachment to occur in a relationship, is now causing one partner to harm the other.

In the search for the root of intimate partner violence, intranasal oxytocin was administered to a control group and a group of participants with aggressive tendencies. Participants were then surveyed on how willing they were to engage in 5 behaviors towards their romantic partner. What they found was that oxytocin increased IPV inclinations only among the participants with a predisposition towards aggressive tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;DeWall, C. N., Gillath, O., Pressman, S. D., Black, L. L., Bartz, J. A., Moskovitz, J., &amp; Stetler, D. A. (2014). When the Love Hormone Leads to Violence Oxytocin Increases Intimate Partner Violence Inclinations Among High Trait Aggressive People. Social Psychological and Personality Science, 1948550613516876&lt;/ref&gt; Oxytocin decreases trust and prosocial behavior in individuals with interpersonal difficulties. This, coupled with its role in relationship maintenance, illustrates that oxytocin serves to instill a sense of territoriality and protectiveness towards a mate.

'''Round-trip engineering''' ('''RTE''') is a functionality of [[software development tools]] that synchronizes two or more related software artifacts, such as, source code, models, configuration files, and even documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gentle|first1=Anne|title=Conversation and Community: The Social Web for Documentation|date=2012|publisher=XML Press|isbn=978-1937434106|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for round-trip engineering arises when the same information is present in multiple artifacts and therefore an inconsistency may occur if not all artifacts are consistently updated to reflect a given change. For example, some piece of information was added to/changed in only one artifact and, as a result, it became missing in/inconsistent with the other artifacts.

Round-trip engineering is closely related to traditional [[software engineering]] disciplines: forward engineering (creating software from specifications), [[reverse engineering]] (creating specifications from existing software), and [[Reengineering (software)|reengineering]] (understanding existing software and modifying it). Round-trip engineering is often wrongly defined as simply supporting both forward and reverse engineering. In fact, the key characteristic of round-trip engineering that distinguishes it from forward and reverse engineering is the ability to synchronize ''existing'' artifacts that evolved ''concurrently'' by ''incrementally'' updating each artifact to reflect changes made to the other artifacts. Furthermore, forward engineering can be seen as a special instance of RTE in which only the specification is present and reverse engineering can be seen as a special instance of RTE in which only the software is present. Many reengineering activities can also be understood as RTE when the software is updated to reflect changes made to the previously reverse engineered specification.

Another characteristic of round-trip engineering is ''automatic'' update of the artifacts in response to ''automatically'' detected inconsistencies. In that sense, it is different from forward- and reverse engineering which can be both manual (traditionally) and automatic (via automatic generation or analysis of the artifacts). The automatic update can be either ''instantaneous'' or ''on-demand''. In instantaneous RTE, all related artifacts are immediately updated after each change made to one of them. In on-demand RTE, authors of the artifacts may concurrently evolve the artifacts (even in a distributed setting) and at some point choose to execute matching to identify inconsistencies and choose to propagate some of them and reconcile potential conflicts.

Round trip engineering supports an iterative development process. After you have synchronized your model with revised code, you are still free to choose the best way to work – make further modifications to the code or make changes to your model. You can synchronize in either direction at any time and you can repeat the cycle as many times as necessary.

==Examples of round-trip engineering==
Perhaps the most common form of round-trip engineering is synchronization between UML ([[Unified Modeling Language]]) models and the corresponding source code. Many commercial tools and research prototypes support this form of RTE; a 2007 book lists [[Rational Rose]], [[Borland Together]], [[ESS-Model]], [[BlueJ]], and [[Fujaba]] among those capable, with Fujaba said to be capable to also identify [[design pattern]]s.&lt;ref name="Diehl2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephan Diehl|title=Software Visualization: Visualizing the Structure, Behaviour, and Evolution of Software|year=2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-46505-8|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, UML class diagrams are supported to some degree; however, certain UML concepts, such as ''associations'' and ''containment'' do not have straightforward representations in many programming languages which limits the usability of the created code and accuracy of code analysis (e.g., containment is hard to recognize in the code). A 2005 book on [[Visual Studio]] notes for instance that a common problem in RTE tools is that the model reversed is not the same as the original one, unless the tools are helped by laborious annotations.&lt;ref name="FilevLoton2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Filev|author2=Tony Loton|author3=Kevin McNeish |author4=Ben Schoellmann |author5=John Slater |author6=Chaur G. Wu|title=Professional UML Using Visual Studio .Net|year=2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-7645-5875-7|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The behavioral parts of UML impose even more challenges for RTE.

A more tractable form of round-trip engineering is implemented in the context of framework [[application programming interface]]s (APIs), whereby a model describing the usage of a framework API by an application is synchronized with that application's code. In this setting, the API ''prescribes'' all correct ways the framework can be used in applications, which allows precise and complete detection of API usages in the code as well as creation of useful code implementing correct API usages. Two prominent RTE implementations in this category are [[framework-specific modeling language]]s and [[Spring Roo]].

Round-trip engineering is critical for maintaining consistency among multiple models and between the models and the code in [[Object Management Group]]'s (OMG) [[Model-driven architecture]]. OMG proposed the [[QVT]] (query/view/transformation) standard to handle model transformations required for MDA. To date, a few implementations of the standard have been created. (Need to present practical experiences with MDA in relation to RTE).

==Examples in software engineering==
Round-trip engineering based on [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) needs three basic compoments for software development:{{fact|date=January 2018}}

* Source Code Editor;
* UML Editor for the Attributes and Methods;
* Visualisation of UML structure.

An example of basic round-trip engineering is accessible as a web-based Open Source tool is:{{fact|date=January 2018}}

* ''JavaScript Class Creator''&lt;ref&gt;[https://niebert.github.io/JavascriptClassCreator/ JavaScript Class Creator], [[GitHub]].&lt;/ref&gt; allows integrated round-trip engineering for JavaScript Classes. [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] Diagrams are generated with a diagram library JointJS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/clientIO/joint JointJS], [[GitHub]].&lt;/ref&gt; Editing of Javascript Source Code is realized with the editor ACE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ace.c9.io ACE].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychology]], a '''set''' is a group of expectations that shape experience by making people especially sensitive to specific kinds of information. A ''perceptual set'', also called ''perceptual expectancy'', is a predisposition to [[perception|perceive]] things in a certain way.&lt;ref name="Weiten2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiten|first=Wayne|title=Psychology: Themes and Variations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sILajOhJpOsC&amp;pg=PT193|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=17 December 2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-60197-5|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perceptual sets occur in all the different senses.&lt;ref name="Sonderegger1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sonderegger|first=Theo|title=Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UUrCHiSb_QsC&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=16 October 1998|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-8220-5327-9|pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be long term, such as a special sensitivity to hearing one's own name in a crowded room, or short term, as in the ease with which hungry people notice the smell of food.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hardy|first1=Malcolm|last2=Heyes|first2=Steve|title=Beginning Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fjPWqXi9WQsC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=2 December 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-832821-6|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''mental set'' is a framework for thinking about a problem.&lt;ref name="Galotti2009" /&gt; It can be shaped by habit or by desire.&lt;ref name="SharmaChandra2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharma|first1=Ram Nath|last2=Chandra|first2=S.S.|title=General Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wJ0om-uxWpcC&amp;pg=PA253|accessdate=25 March 2011|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|isbn=978-81-269-0303-0|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mental sets can make it easy to solve a class of problem, but attachment to the wrong mental set can inhibit problem-solving and creativity.&lt;ref name="Galotti2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Galotti|first=Kathleen M.|title=Cognitive Psychology: In and Out of the Laboratory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ezZWTurJuH0C&amp;pg=PA341|accessdate=25 March 2011|date=5 February 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-17-644065-7|pages=341–344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruno2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruno|first=Frank Joe|title=Psychology: a self-teaching guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W3NxvYRL-fgC&amp;pg=PA127|accessdate=25 March 2011|date=2 August 2002|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-471-44395-7|pages=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceptual==
Perception can be shaped by "top-down" processes such as drives and expectations. An effect of these factors is that people are particularly sensitive to perceive certain things, detecting them from weaker stimuli than otherwise.&lt;ref name="CoonMitterer2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coon|first1=Dennis|last2=Mitterer|first2=John O.|title=Introduction to Psychology: Gateways to Mind and Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vw20LEaJe10C&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=29 December 2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-59911-1|pages=171–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple demonstration of the effect involved very brief presentations of non-words such as "sael". Subjects who were told to expect words about animals read it as "seal", but others who were expecting boat-related words read it as "sail".&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999" /&gt;

Sets can be created by [[motivation]] and so can result in people interpreting ambiguous situations so that they see what they want to see.&lt;ref name="CoonMitterer2008"/&gt; For instance, a person's experience of the events in a sports match can be biased if they strongly support one of the teams.&lt;ref name="BlockYuker2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Block|first1=J. R.|last2=Yuker|first2=Harold E.|title=Can You Believe Your Eyes?: Over 250 Illusions and Other Visual Oddities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNMFiMQu8BMC&amp;pg=PA173|accessdate=24 March 2011|date=1 October 2002|publisher=Robson|isbn=978-1-86105-586-6|pages=173–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one experiment, students were allocated to pleasant or unpleasant tasks by a computer. They were told that either a number or a letter would flash on the screen to say whether they were going to taste an orange juice drink or an unpleasant-tasting health drink. In fact, an ambiguous figure was flashed on screen, which could either be read as the letter B or the number 13. When the letters were associated with the pleasant task, subjects were more likely to perceive a letter B, and when letters were associated with the unpleasant task they tended to perceive a number 13.&lt;ref name="Weiten2008" /&gt;

Perceptual sets have been demonstrated in many social contexts. People who are [[priming (psychology)|primed]] to think of someone as "warm" are more likely to perceive a variety of positive characteristics in them, than if the word "warm" is replaced by "cold". When someone has a reputation for being funny, an audience are more likely to find them amusing.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999" /&gt; Individual's perceptual sets reflect their own personality traits. For example, people with an aggressive personality are quicker to correctly identify aggressive words or situations.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999" /&gt;

==Mental==
Mental sets are subconscious tendencies to approach a problem in a particular way.&lt;ref name="Bruno2002" /&gt; They are shaped by past experiences and habits.&lt;ref name="Mangal2007" /&gt; An inappropriate mental set can hamper the solution of straightforward problems.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999" /&gt; For example, when people are asked, "When a United States plane carrying Canadian passengers crashes in international waters, where should the survivors be buried?" the phrasing of the question suggests that it is a problem of international law. People who interpret the statement with this mental set will miss the fact that survivors would not need to be buried.&lt;ref name="Bruno2002" /&gt; A specific form of mental set is ''functional fixedness'', in which someone fails to see the variety of uses to which an object can be put.&lt;ref name="HardyHeyes1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruno2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mangal2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mangal|first=S. K.|title=Essentials of educational psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XyYPIr120ZcC&amp;pg=PA393|accessdate=25 March 2011|date=1 August 2007|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=978-81-203-3055-9|pages=393–394}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be someone who needs a weight but fails to use an easily available hammer because their mental set is to think of a hammer as for a specific purpose.&lt;ref name="Bruno2002" /&gt;

'''Shell to Sea''' ({{lang-ga|Shell chun Sáile}}) is an Irish organisation based in the parish of [[Kilcommon]] in [[Erris]], [[County Mayo]].

It opposes the proposed construction of a [[natural gas]] [[Gas pipeline|pipeline]] through the parish, as well as the ongoing construction&amp;mdash;by [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[Statoil]] and Vermilion Energy Trust&amp;mdash;of a [[Oil refinery|refinery]] at [[Bellanaboy]] intended to refine the natural gas from the [[Corrib gas field]]. It proposes instead that the gas be refined at sea, rather than inland, as is done with Ireland's only other producing gas field off [[County Cork]]. Shell to Sea believes the proximity of a raw natural gas pipeline is a risk to local residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicinquiry.ie/pdf/Accufacts_Report_Hi_res.pdf |title=Report |work=publicinquiry.ie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231193519/http://www.publicinquiry.ie/pdf/Accufacts_Report_Hi_res.pdf |archivedate=31 December 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three stated aims of the campaign, as cited on its website, are that "Any exploitation of the Corrib gas field be done in a safe way that will not expose the local community in Erris to unnecessary health, safety and environmental risks", "To renegotiate the terms of the Great Oil and Gas Giveaway, which sees Ireland's 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent off the West Coast go directly to the oil companies, with the Irish State retaining a 0% share, no energy security of supply and only 25% tax on profits against which all costs can be deducted" and "To seek justice for the human rights abuses suffered by Shell to Sea campaigners due to their opposition to Shell's proposed inland refinery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shelltosea.com/content/campaign-aims|title=Campaign Aims|work=Shell to Sea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidents of note include the 2005 jailing of the [[Rossport Five]] and the public outcry that followed,&lt;ref name="publicinquiry1"/&gt; the 2007 [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] received by [[Willie Corduff]] (one of the five), local fisherman Pat O'Donnell's laying of 800 crab pots at sea and [[Maura Harrington]]'s hunger strike against the [[Allseas]] pipe-laying ship ''[[Solitaire (ship)|Solitaire]]'' in 2008, an [[Willie Corduff#2009 alleged assault|alleged assault on Corduff]] in 2009 which was condemned by [[Desmond Tutu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Áine|last=Ryan|url=http://www.mayonews.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6575&amp;Itemid=38|title=Archbishop Tutu speaks out on Corrib as seven are arrested: Nobel Peace Laureate and internationally renowned human rights activist, Archbishop Desmond Tutu has spoken out about the controversial Corrib gas controversy|newspaper=The Mayo News|date=11 May 2009|accessdate=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2011 "rape tape" scandal when [[Gardaí]] (police) accidentally filmed themselves joking about the imagined rape of two female protestors after arresting them,&lt;ref name="Corribgate scandal Gardaí caught on confiscated camcorder"/&gt; and the reports of gifts of alcohol worth tens of thousands of euros from Shell to the Gardaí, which broke in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/10/shell-pipeline-protests-county-mayo&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Corrib gas controversy}}
Opposition to the gas consortium and [[Irish government|government]]'s plans among local residents grew from 2000 when local residents felt they were not adequately consulted. They opposed planning permission and appealed it to [[An Bord Pleanála]] twice. It was felt that government pressure was used to force the planning permission through. They also felt misled about the safety of the gas pipeline which did not require planning permission under the 1976 Gas Act.&lt;ref name="publicinquiry1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicinquiry.ie/pdf/Fiosru_2_HI_RES_Final.pdf |title=FIOSRU - November 9 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229225619/http://www.publicinquiry.ie/pdf/Fiosru_2_HI_RES_Final.pdf |archivedate=29 December 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005===
The first event organised by Shell to Sea was on the June Bank Holiday weekend in 2005 in support of [[Rossport]] residents' protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.anphoblacht.com/news/detail/9761|title=Shell's assault on Erris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local landowners in Rossport had previously been told that the raw gas pipeline would be coming through their lands no matter what, and that they would be subject to [[Compulsory Purchase Order|Compulsory Acquisition Orders]] if unwilling to reach a deal with Shell.&lt;ref name="publicinquiry1"/&gt; Some&lt;ref name="publicinquiry1"/&gt; agreed to allow Shell on their lands. Others refused, and [[Frank Fahey]], then [[Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources|Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources]] signed 34 Compulsory Acquisition Orders. Those who had refused were threatened with legal action. Legal action was taken which eventually culminated in four farmers and their former teacher, who had joined them in blocking Shell workers coming on their lands, being jailed on 29 June for civil [[contempt of court]] (at the request of Shell) after refusing to give an undertaking not to interfere with Shell's workers. They became known as the [[Rossport Five]].

24-hour pickets on the Shell sites at Rossport, Bellanaboy and [[Glengad]] began after their jailing.&lt;ref name="publicinquiry1"/&gt; Rallies in support of the men's stance were held in major towns and cities, and Shell and Statoil filling stations were picketed.&lt;ref name="publicinquiry1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.anphoblacht.com/news/detail/10589|title=Campaign grows across Ireland|newspaper=An Phoblacht|accessdate=19 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these protests emerged the national Shell to Sea campaign.

The Rossport Five were released on 30 September, after their imprisonment had dominated proceedings in the parliament. [[Peter Cassells]] was appointed as a negotiator to arbitrate between the campaigners and Shell. As his remit did not include discussing the refinery, he was regarded as a distraction by Shell to Sea. The pickets at Bellanaboy continued for over a year, during which no work was done by Shell.

===2006===
On Tuesday 26 September 2006, protesters prevented Shell's employees from entering the site of the intended refinery at Bellanaboy to begin work. Around 150 locals and protesters blocked the entrance to the refinery site and began to recite the [[rosary]]. The workers turned back{{citation needed|date=September 2007}} after discussions with [[Garda Síochána|Gardaí]].{{citation needed|date=September 2007}}

One week later on 3 October, more Gardaí were brought in from around the country, which increased their numbers to around 170. This marked a departure in Garda tactics which they have held to. An editorial in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' stated: ''"The Garda [[baton charge]]s that occurred on Friday morning in Bellanaboy were not the product of Sinn Féin or [[Provisional IRA]] machinations; they were the product of abject Government incompetence."''&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Times'', 26 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A decision to avoid arresting protesters in order to damp down the negative publicity that would ensue was discussed in the Garda magazine, ''Garda Review''. A number of people were injured and one young woman was brought to hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mayonews.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=420&amp;Itemid=38l|title=Shell enter Bellanaboy site: Up to 170 Gardaí facilitated the entry of Shell workers to the Bellanaboy terminal site|publisher=Mayonews.ie|date=3 October 2006|accessdate=3 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protesters occupied [[Shell Ireland]] HQ in [[Dublin]]'s [[Leeson Street]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/1011/corrib.html|title=Protest continues in Co Mayo|work=[[RTÉ News]]|publisher=[[RTÉ.ie]]|date=11 October 2006|accessdate=11 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and daily protests continued at Bellanaboy with some arrests made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/1012/corrib.html|title=Sit-down protests at entrance to Corrib gas terminal site at Bellanaboy|work=[[RTÉ News]]|publisher=[[RTÉ.ie]]|date=12 October 2006|accessdate=12 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jim|last=Fahy|authorlink=Jim Fahy|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/1020/morningireland.html|title=Shell to Sea in day of action at gas terminal site|work=[[Morning Ireland]]|publisher=[[RTÉ.ie]]|date=20 October 2006|accessdate=20 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Shell to sea1.jpg|thumb|Protest at gate of intended [[refinery]] site, [[Bellanaboy]], September 2007]] --&gt;

A second large scale protest march took place on 10 November, the anniversary of the execution of [[Ken Saro Wiwa]] and eight other anti-Shell activists in [[Nigeria]] in 1995. When protesters worked their way around Gardaí lines, clashes occurred, resulting in several injuries. Small groups of demonstrators who had been unable to get to the refinery attempted to blockade the nearby Lennon's quarry which supplies material for the construction of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/1110/mayo.html|title=Protestors block convoy of vehicles taking construction workers to Corrib gas site|work=[[RTÉ News]]|publisher=[[RTÉ.ie]]|date=10 November 2006|accessdate=10 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was political controversy in Ireland about the use of such force on a peaceful demonstration. [[Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]], leader of [[Fianna Fáil]], said in a statement that the [[Irish government]]'s position was clear in relation to the Corrib gas situation - that the negotiating is over and "that is it". In relation to the policing of the protests, he and the Opposition's [[Enda Kenny]], leader of [[Fine Gael]], would only reiterate that "the law must be obeyed".

A further large scale protest at Bellanaboy scheduled for 24 November was cancelled by the protesters for fear of further serious injuries from Gardaí.&lt;ref name="breakingnews2006"/&gt;

===2007===
On 5 June, five protesters chained themselves together{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} outside the [[Bord na Móna]] facility near [[Bangor Erris]] where Shell have been dumping the peat removed from Bellinaboy.

On 12 September, a protester charged with public order offences had her case dismissed in [[Belmullet]] because of conflicting Garda evidence. The judge dismissed most of the charges and sentenced the five protesters from June to community service for threatening and abusive behaviour. The judge also disclosed that she had received "hate mail".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.westernpeople.ie/news/story.asp?j=38192&amp;cat=news|archive-url=https://archive.is/20090619151226/http://www.westernpeople.ie/news/story.asp?j=38192&amp;cat=news|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 June 2009|title=''Western People'' article|publisher=Westernpeople.ie|date=20 September 2007|accessdate=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Shell to Sea kayak training.jpg|thumb|right|Shell to Sea kayak training, [[Glengad]], August 2008]] --&gt;
In April 2008, a new group was set up by people formerly active in S2S. [[Pobal Chill Chomáin]] proposed moving the refinery to Glinsk, which would have removed the necessity to transport the gas near people's homes and under roads. The proposal was rejected by both Shell{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} and the government.{{citation needed|date=September 2008}}

In 2008, a new security firm, [[Integrated Risk Management Services]], was brought in{{by whom|date=February 2013}} to defend Shell's preparations for the landfall of the raw gas pipeline. In August, S2S began training for marine protests in anticipation of the arrival of the [[Allseas]] pipe-laying ship ''[[Solitaire (ship)|Solitaire]]'', the biggest of its kind in the world with a collection of small boats.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Iollan's "arrest".jpg|thumb|Iollan Ó'Mongáin, son of [[Maura Harrington]], is detained by four Gardaí in September 2008. A Shell security guard tapes the detention.]] --&gt;

In the meantime, a local Porturlin fisherman, Pat O'Donnell, laid 800 crab pots along the intended path of ''Solitaire'', and defended them from Shell survey boats which attempted to remove them. The [[Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine|Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] stated that as both parties had licenses for their activities, they would have to sort it out between themselves. Two [[Irish Navy]] ships arrived in Broadhaven Bay to assist the [[Garda Water Unit]] in dealing with the protests. ''Solitaire'' was boarded by S2S activists in [[Killybegs]]. Not long after it arrived to Mayo's coast, the ship's company said it had suffered damage to its crane. It returned to Britain for repairs. [[Maura Harrington]] began a [[hunger strike]] to coincide with the arrival of ''Solitaire'', the [[Allseas]] pipe-laying vessel, in [[Broadhaven Bay]]. Harrington, who had recently retired as principal of the local Inver Primary School,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/0910/breaking8.html?via=mr|title=Corrib work suspended for 'technical' reasons|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irishtimes.com|date=10 September 2008|accessdate=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; continued her protest until the ship left Irish waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/0920/1221835126751.html|title=Shell to Sea protester ends 10-day hunger strike|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irishtimes.com|date=20 September 2008|accessdate=20 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, Maura Harrington was sentenced to a month in [[Mountjoy Prison]], for assaulting a Garda at McGrath's pier. In July 2009, Niall Harnett and Maura Harrington, two leading Corrib gas activists were jailed for four months over demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0730/breaking77.htm|title=Two Shell protesters jailed|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irishtimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5iGye_GC-ITa9Lpf35__SCt7lrc0A|title=Gas pipeline protesters jailed|work=[[The Press Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, the Garda Ombudsman Commission recommended that disciplinary action be taken against a senior member of An Garda Síochána over the handling of the June 2007 protest.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}} In a separate development, An Bord Pleanála found that up to half of the final section of Shell's proposed route for the onshore pipeline was ‘unacceptable’ on safety grounds.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===2010===
Shell failed to meet An Bord Pleanala's deadline in February and applied for an extension of time to put their proposals forward as to how the project might proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0201/1224263502431.html|title=Shell asks for more time to resolve Corrib gas issues|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irishtimes.com|date=1 February 2010|accessdate=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pat O'Donnell, from [[Kilcommon|Porturlin]], was sentenced to seven months imprisonment in February.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0218/1224264714612.html|title=Shell confirms key parts of Corrib gas project postponed|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irishtimes.com|date=18 February 2010|accessdate=18 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, Niall Harnett of [[Kilcommon]], was jailed.

Brian Barrington BL in a report commissioned for [[Front Line Defenders]] found serious problems in North Mayo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0427/1224269159758.html|title=Frontline report: Main points|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irishtimes.com|date=27 April 2010|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Monday 31 May 2010, Shell submitted a third revised EIS to An Bord Pleanala for a revised pipeline route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lorna|last=Siggins|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0602/1224271675717.html|title=Planning board to assess latest Corrib plan|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irishtimes.com|date=2 June 2010|accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011===
In April 2011, it emerged that Gardaí who had just arrested two female protestors had made explicit jokes about raping them.&lt;ref name="Corribgate scandal Gardaí caught on confiscated camcorder"&gt;{{cite news|first=Áine|last=Ryan|url=http://www.mayonews.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12344:gardai-in-corribgate-scandal&amp;catid=23:news&amp;Itemid=46|title=Gardaí in Corribgate scandal: Corrib Gardaí caught on confiscated camcorder: Investigation under way after ‘rape’ comments found on protestor's tape|newspaper=The Mayo News|date=5 April 2011|accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had inadvertently recorded themselves making the comments on a video camera they had taken from one of the women, which they later returned with the recording on it. The comments were widely criticised. In December the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland upheld a complaint about RTÉ's television reporting of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission's interim report. The report confirmed that the tape had recorded Gardaí joking about raping the women. The interim report found no evidence of a criminal offence having been committed by Gardaí and no evidence of a breach of discipline. The complaint, which was upheld, stated that RTÉ's report was inaccurate, lacked fairness, objectivity and impartiality and caused the woman involved undue harm and offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lorna|last=Siggins|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1203/1224308523089.html|title=RTÉ report on Corrib tape breached 'fairness'|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irishtimes.com|date=3 December 2011|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct actions continued to hamper construction activities throughout 2011 and 2012. In May, 30 to 35 sections of wooden bog road were removed from their positions in the Shell site at Aughoose in a mass direct action by protestors. In June, between 400 and 500 people attended the ''Party Against the Pipe'' near the Shell compound in Aughoose, a family friendly gathering with craft workshops, music and food to mark the tenth anniversary of resistance to Shell's activities in Erris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Flood|url=http://www.wsm.ie/c/hundreds-gather-erris-party-against-pipe|title=Hundreds gather in Erris for the Party Against the Pipe|publisher=[[Workers Solidarity Movement]]|date=8 June 2011|accessdate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct actions continued to hamper construction activities throughout 2011, 2012 and 2013.

===2012===
Another gathering took place over the June bank holiday weekend. In July, Shell attempted to transport the tunnel boring machine from Dubin Port to Ballinaboy, but were met by many direct actions. Close to the compound, the oversize transport lorry drove off the road and remained stuck in the bog for several days. There were several arrests and assaults of protestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Aine|last=Ryan|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/0802/breaking45.html|title=Shell machine remains stuck|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irishtimes.com|date=2 August 2012|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, Shell to Sea launched a new report on the location of Ireland's oil and gas reserves, which depicted all the areas of oil and gas exploration, oil and gas discoveries and commercial fields for the first time on a single map, as well as publishing the license holding companies' estimates of how much each was worth. The report, entitled 'Liquid Assets: Ireland's oil and gas resources and how they could be managed for the people's benefit', was launched by [[Paul Murphy (Irish politician)|Paul Murphy]], Socialist Party MEP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ann|last=O'Loughlin|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/world/reserving-expectations-207108.html|title=Will consumers miss out on potential oil and gas bonanza?|newspaper=[[Irish Examiner]]|publisher=[[Thomas Crosbie Holdings]]|date=11 September 2012|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013===
In February 2013, with Shell having revealed 2012 profits of €19.6 billion, people blocked trucks on their way to the multinational corporation's tunnelling compound at Aughoose. Campaigner Terence Conway said: "These obscene profits announced by Shell this week come at the expense of communities and the environment where Shell operate". Campaigner Maura Harrington said: "The Government are still willing to force suffering on the people of Ireland through severe cutbacks, yet at the same time give our oil and gas away to multinational companies such as Shell, with no benefit to country. It is time for people to demand that this situation is changed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/shell-to-sea-protesters-block-trucks-en-route-to-compound-583405.html|title=Shell to Sea protesters block trucks en route to compound|work=BreakingNews.ie|publisher=[[Thomas Crosbie Holdings]]|date=2 February 2013|accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rossport Solidarity Camp==
[[File:Rossport Solidarity Camp.jpg|thumb|right|Rossport Solidarity Camp, [[Rossport]], February 2007]]
The Rossport Solidarity Camp was originally set up on ‘Rossport 5’ Philip McGrath's land in early July 2005. The site of the camp was on the proposed pipeline route. Set up at the request of local people who sought outside support in their campaign against the gas project, it houses national and international activists. In Spring 2006, the camp was set up again close to the beach at Glengad near the ‘landfall’ for Shell's proposed pipeline. [[Mayo County Council]] evicted the camp and it closed in December 2007. Since then the "camp" has been organised from the Rossport Solidarity House in Pollathomas. On Saturday 16 August 2008, the camp was set up afresh with two large tents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Aoife|last=Finneran|url=http://www.herald.ie/opinion/dirty-war-what-really-is-going-on-at-the-battle-of-rossport-1479997.html|title=Dirty War: what really is going on at the battle of Rossport? - Opinion, Frontpage|work=Herald.ie|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|date=22 September 2008|accessdate=22 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008, camp members picketed the Shell compound near the beach at Glengad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0730/breaking77.htm|title=Two Corrib gas protesters jailed|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irishtimes.com|date=30 July 2009|accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It organises informational weekends etc. In the same month they organised a beach party weekend to highlight the Glengad beach landfall site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Toni|last=Bourke|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/mayo/article/1146|title=Reclaim Glendad Beach party this weekend|newspaper=Mayo Advertiser|publisher=Advertiser.ie|date=8 August 2008|accessdate=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, about 40 Gardaí were stationed below the Camp to prevent activists from accessing either the beach or the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=O2 Ideas Room |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/tight-security-as--shell-pipelaying-ship-nears-land-1791515.html|title=Tight security as Shell pipe-laying ship nears land - National News, Frontpage|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|date=26 June 2009|accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==

The campaign has a diverse support base,{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} including people from many political backgrounds{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} and those with no strong politics at all.{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} Local campaigners include former Fianna Fáil and [[Fine Gael]] supporters. Philip McGrath, one of the Rossport Five, was an election agent for Fine Gael leader [[Enda Kenny]]. [[Werner Blau]], a [[physics]] professor at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], and part-time Rossport resident, told his neighbours that the pipeline intended for Rossport would not even comply with [[United States]] standards, which he described as "pretty lax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Angelique|last=Chrisafis, Ireland correspondent|url=https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,1530695,00.html|title=Jailing of Irish villagers sparks anger as farmers defy Shell in Battle of the Bog: Support swells for opponents of gas pipeline imprisoned for contempt of court|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=18 July 2005|accessdate=18 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its rankings of countries' facilitation of oil and gas companies, the [[World Bank]] rates Ireland in its highest, "very favourable" category,{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} along with [[Pakistan]] and [[Argentina]]. By comparison, Nigeria is rated average. Mike Cunningham, a former director of Statoil, said: ''"No country in the world gives as favourable terms to the oil companies as Ireland."''

Some specific concerns are use of compulsory orders to acquire property for private companies and over-generous terms given to the oil companies by successive Fianna Fáil governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kevin|last=Sullivan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/24/AR2005092401403.html|title=Protest Stalls Energy Giant in Rural Ireland|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|date=25 September 2005|accessdate=25 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People from the [[Niger Delta]] now resident in Ireland have expressed support.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} A mural of [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]], who was executed after leading a campaign to reduce Shell's influence in [[Ogoniland]], has been painted on a gable in Rossport and a memorial to the [[Ogoni Nine]] erected.

In 2006, Shell were accused of trying to influence local business, when the owner of a local adventure centre alleged that Shell offered him €15,000 in return for his support for the construction of the pipeline in 2005. Shell said in response, that at no point was such an offer made as it was against their business principles but that Shell had given a donation of €150 to a [[windsurfing]] festival following a request by the businessman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Brian|last=McDonald|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/shell-offered-to-pay-15000-for-support-73717.html|title=Shell 'offered to pay €15,000' for support|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|date=17 October 2006|accessdate=17 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Unsubstantiated allegations abound linking the [[List of organisations known as the Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and [[Sinn Féin]] to the Shell to Sea campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lorna|last=Siggins|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2010/1002/1224280153915.html|title=The Battle for Ballinaboy|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|publisher=Irishtimes.com|date=2 October 2010|accessdate=2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]]&amp;mdash;using [[Parliamentary privilege|Dáil privilege]]&amp;mdash;claimed that Frank Connolly, an investigative journalist and a brother of one of the [[Colombia Three]], had travelled to [[Colombia]] under a false passport.&lt;ref name=cpi-funding&gt;

Although Connolly denied McDowell's accusations, the controversy led to [[Irish American]] private donor [[Chuck Feeney]] withdrawing funding from the [[Centre for Public Inquiry]], an investigative organisation which  of which Frank Connolly was the director had published a report on the Corrib Gas Project, embarrassing the government.&lt;ref name=cpi-funding/&gt;

Stories of infiltration by political activists from outside the area and intimidation of project supporters had also been rife, but these were denied by the then independent [[Teachta Dála|TD]] [[Jerry Cowley]] and local Fine Gael [[Teachta Dála|TD]] [[Michael Ring]].&lt;ref name="breakingnews2006"&gt;{{cite news|author=21/11/2006 - 16:12:21|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/shell-to-sea-campaign-gets-cross-party-support-286033.html |title='Shell to Sea' campaign gets cross-party support|publisher=BreakingNews.ie|date=21 November 2006|accessdate=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ring originally supported S2S, though later changed his position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Workplace bullying]]|url=http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=9&amp;si=1710340&amp;issue_id=14795|title=Irish Independent|publisher=Unison.ie|date=21 October 2006|accessdate=21 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardaí also made allegations of intimidation, though no arrests were made or individuals questioned. The president of [[Belmullet]] [[chamber of commerce]] told the media that what was described as "intimidation" is actually [[boycott]]ing of pro-Shell businesses by S2S supporters. He told ''[[The Irish Times]]'': "It has never been anything more serious than that, but that is serious enough."&lt;ref&gt;"Erris will never be the same again", ''The Irish Times'', 27 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociology]], '''social facts''' are values, cultural norms, and social structures that transcend the individual and can exercise [[social control]]. The French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] defined the term, and argued that the discipline of sociology should be understood as the empirical study of social facts. For Durkheim, social facts "...&amp;nbsp;consist of manners of acting, thinking and feeling external to the individual, which are invested with a coercive power by virtue of which they exercise control over him."&lt;ref name="Rules"&gt;{{cite book |first=Émile |last=Durkheim |title=The Rules of Sociological Method and Selected Texts on Sociology and its Method |others=W. D. Halls (translator) |editor-first=Steven |editor-last=Lukes |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |year=1982 |orig-year=1st pub. 1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Durkheim's social fact==
In ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' Durkheim laid out a theory of sociology as "the science of social facts". He considered social facts to "consist of representations and actions" which meant that "they cannot be confused with organic phenomena, nor with physical phenomena, which have no existence save in and through the individual consciousness."&lt;ref name="Rules"/&gt; Durkheim says that a social fact is a thing that many [[people]] do very similarly because the socialized community that they belong to has influenced them to do these things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Emile Durkheim: What Is a Social Fact?|url = http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/durkheim02.htm|website = www.csudh.edu|access-date = 2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim defined the social fact this way:
:"A social fact is any way of acting, whether fixed or not, capable of exerting over the individual an external constraint;
::or:
:which is general over the whole of a given society whilst having an existence of its own, independent of its individual manifestations".&lt;ref name="Rules"/&gt;

He viewed it as a concrete idea that affected a person's everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Durkheim|first1=Emile|title=What is a Social Fact|journal=The Rules of Sociological Method|date=1982|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim's examples of social facts included social institutions such as kinship and marriage, currency, language, religion, political organization, and all societal institutions we must account for in everyday interactions with other members of our societies. Deviating from the norms of such institutions makes the individual unacceptable or misfit in the group.

Among the most noted of Durkheim's work was his discovery of the "social fact" of [[suicide]] rates. By carefully examining [[police]] suicide [[statistics]] in different districts, Durkheim demonstrated that the suicide rate of [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] communities is lower than that of [[Protestant]] communities. He ascribed this to a ''social'' (as opposed to individual) cause.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. ''Suicide''. 1897.&lt;/ref&gt; This was considered groundbreaking and remains influential.

Durkheim's discovery of social facts was significant because it promised to make it possible to study the behaviour of entire societies, rather than just of particular individuals. Durkheim points to individual actions as instances or representations of different types of actions in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmaus|first1=Warren|title=Durkheim's Philosophy of Science and the Sociology of Knowledge: Creating an Intellectual Niche|date=1994|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226742519|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some contemporary, interpretivist, sociologists like Max Atkinson and Jack Douglas refer to Durkheim's studies for two quite different purposes, however:

* Durkheim's studies are graphic demonstrations of how careful the social researcher must be to ensure that data gathered for analysis is accurate. Durkheim's reported suicide rates were, it is now clear, largely an artifact of the way particular deaths were classified as "suicide" or "non-suicide" by different communities. What he actually discovered was not different ''suicide rates'' at all—but different ways of ''thinking about suicide''.
* His studies are also an entry point into the study of social meaning—and the way that apparently identical individual acts often cannot be classified empirically. Social ''acts'' (even such an apparently private and individual act as suicide), in this modern view, are always seen (and classified) by social ''actors''. Discovering the social facts about such acts, it follows, is generally neither possible nor desirable—but discovering the way individuals perceive and classify particular acts is what offers insight. A further complication is introduced by asking about the status of our "discovery" of these perceptions and classifications. After all, don't such "discoveries" ''also'' reflect socially embedded practices of classification? But if the alleged discoveries of perceptions of social facts aren't therefore dubious, it is hard to see why the original claims about the social facts are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deviance and Social Control Unit M5: Suicide (2)|url=http://www.sociology.org.uk/devs2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Douglas|first1=Jack D.|title=Social Meanings of Suicide|date=1967|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691621173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mauss's total social fact==
For [[Marcel Mauss]] (Durkheim's nephew and sometime collaborator) a ''total social fact'' (French ''fait social total'') is "an activity that has implications throughout society, in the economic, legal, political, and religious spheres".&lt;ref&gt;Edgar (1999), 64&lt;/ref&gt;
Diverse strands of social and psychological life are woven together through what he came to call ''total social facts''. A total social fact informs and organizes seemingly quite distinct practices and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar (2002), 157&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcel Mauss]] popularized the term in his book, ''[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]'':
{{quote|These phenomena are at once legal, economic, religious, aesthetic, morphological and so on. They are legal in that they concern individual and collective rights, organized and diffuse morality; they may be entirely obligatory, or subject simply to praise or disapproval. They are at once political and domestic, being of interest both to classes and to clans and families. They are religious; they concern true religion, animism, magic and diffuse religious mentality. They are economic, for the notions of value, utility, interest, luxury, wealth, acquisition, accumulation, consumption and liberal and sumptuous expenditure are all present...&lt;ref&gt;Mauss (1966), 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''sociology of scientific knowledge''' ('''SSK''') is the study of [[science]] as a social activity, especially dealing with "the social conditions and effects of science, and with the social structures and processes of scientific activity."&lt;ref name=socofsci-bendavid&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For comparison, the [[sociology of knowledge]] studies the impact of human [[knowledge]] and the prevailing ideas on societies and relations between knowledge and the social context within which it arises.

[[Sociologist]]s of scientific knowledge study the development of a [[scientific field]] and attempt to identify points of contingency or interpretative flexibility where ambiguities are present. Such variations may be linked to a variety of [[political]], [[historical]], [[cultural]] or [[economic]] factors. Crucially, the field does not set out to promote [[relativism]] or to attack the scientific project; the aim of the researcher is to explain why one interpretation rather than another succeeds due to external social and historical circumstances.

The field emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s and at first was an almost exclusively British practice. Other early centers for the development of the field were in France, Germany, and the United States (notably at [[Cornell University]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=Lk9T2HDmM1t6PHggWkXy9Ny7Cv75T9TskJwwvw8PyFgdmccphCr7!601689703!-129296667?docId=5000344671 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701102333/http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst |archivedate=2012-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major theorists include [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]], [[David Bloor]], [[Sal Restivo]], [[Randall Collins]], [[Gaston Bachelard]], [[Harry Collins]], [[Paul Feyerabend]], [[Steve Fuller (sociologist)|Steve Fuller]], [[Martin Kusch]], [[Bruno Latour]],  [[Mike Mulkay]], [[Derek J. de Solla Price]], [[Lucy Suchman]] and [[Anselm Strauss]].

==Programmes and schools==
The sociology of scientific knowledge  in its Anglophone versions emerged in the 1970s in self-conscious opposition to the sociology of science associated with the American  [[Robert K. Merton]], generally considered one of the seminal authors in the sociology of science.  Merton's was a kind of "sociology of scientists," which left the cognitive content of science out of sociological account; SSK by contrast aimed at providing sociological explanations of scientific ideas themselves, taking its lead from aspects of the work of Thomas S. Kuhn, but especially from established traditions in cultural anthropology (Durkheim, Mauss) as well as the later Wittgenstein.  [[David Bloor]], one of SSK's early champions, has contrasted the so-called 'weak programme' (or 'program' &amp;mdash; either spelling is used) which merely gives social explanations for erroneous beliefs, with what he called the '[[strong program]]me', which considers sociological factors as influencing all beliefs.

The ''weak'' programme is more of a description of an approach than an organised movement. The term is applied to historians, sociologists and philosophers of science who merely cite [[sociological]] factors as being responsible for those beliefs that went wrong. [[Imre Lakatos]] and (in some moods) [[Thomas Kuhn]] might be said to adhere to it.  The ''strong'' programme is particularly associated with the work of two groups: the 'Edinburgh School' ([[David Bloor]], Barry Barnes, and their colleagues at the Science Studies Unit at the [[University of Edinburgh]]) in the 1970s and '80s, and the 'Bath School' ([[Harry Collins]] and others at the [[University of Bath]]) in the same period. "Edinburgh sociologists" and "Bath sociologists" promoted, respectively, the Strong Programme and Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR). Also associated with SSK in the 1980s was discourse analysis as applied to science (associated with [[Michael Mulkay]] at the University of York), as well as a concern with issues of reflexivity arising from paradoxes relating to SSK's relativist stance towards science and the status of its own knowledge-claims (Steve Woolgar, Malcolm Ashmore).

The sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) has major international networks through its principal associations, 4S and EASST, with recently established groups in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Latin America.  It has made major contributions in recent years to a critical analysis of the biosciences and informatics.

==The sociology of mathematical knowledge==
Studies of [[mathematical practice]] and [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics]] are also rightly part of the sociology of knowledge, since they focus on the community of those who practice [[mathematics]] and their common assumptions.  Since [[Eugene Wigner]] raised the issue in 1960 and [[Hilary Putnam]] made it more rigorous in 1975, the question of why fields such as [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] should agree so well has been debated. Proposed solutions point out that the fundamental constituents of mathematical thought, space, form-structure, and number-proportion are also the fundamental constituents of physics. It is also worthwhile to note that physics is nothing but a modeling of reality, and seeing causal relationships governing repeatable observed phenomena, and much of mathematics, especially in relation to the growth of the [[calculus]], has been developed precisely for the goal of developing these models in a rigorous fashion. Another approach is to suggest that there is no deep problem, that the division of human scientific thinking through using words such as 'mathematics' and 'physics' is only useful in their practical everyday function to categorize and distinguish.

Fundamental contributions to the sociology of mathematical knowledge have been made by [[Sal Restivo]] and [[David Bloor]]. Restivo draws upon the work of scholars such as [[Oswald Spengler]] (''The Decline of the West'', 1918), [[Raymond Louis Wilder]] and [[Leslie White|Leslie Alvin White]], as well as contemporary sociologists of knowledge and science studies scholars. [[David Bloor]] draws upon [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and other contemporary thinkers. They both claim that mathematical knowledge is socially constructed and has irreducible contingent and historical factors woven into it. More recently [[Paul Ernest]] has proposed a social constructivist account of mathematical knowledge, drawing on the works of both of these sociologists.

==Criticism==
SSK has received criticism from theorists of the [[Actor-network theory]] (ANT) school of [[science and technology studies]]. These theorists criticise SSK for sociological [[reductionism]] and a [[anthropocentrism|human centered]] universe. SSK, they say, relies too heavily on human actors and social rules and conventions settling scientific controversies. The debate is discussed in an article ''Epistemological Chicken''.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, H. M. and S. Yearley (1992). "Epistemological Chicken". In A. Pickering (Ed.) ''Science as Practice and Culture''. Chicago, Chicago University Press: 301-326. Referenced at [http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/centres/css/ant/ant-a.htm ANT resource list] University of Lancaster, with the summary "Argues against the generalised symmetry of actor-network, preferring in the interpretive sociology tradition to treat humans as ontologically distinct language carriers".

[[File:Apollo 15 splashdown.jpg|thumb|300px|Apollo 15 makes contact with the Pacific Ocean]]
[[Image:Splashdown.png|thumb|Locations of [[Atlantic Ocean]] splashdowns of American spacecraft.]]
[[Image:Splashdown 2.png|thumb|Locations of [[Pacific Ocean]] splashdowns of American spacecraft.]]

'''Splashdown''' is the method of [[landing]] a spacecraft by [[parachute]] in a body of water. It was used by American manned spacecraft prior to the [[Space Shuttle program]], and is planned for use by the upcoming [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle]]. It is also possible for the Russian [[Soyuz spacecraft]] to land in water, though this is only a contingency.  The only example of an unintentional manned splashdown in Soviet history is the [[Soyuz 23]] landing.

As the name suggests, the capsule [[parachute]]s into an [[ocean]] or other large body of water.  The properties of water cushion the spacecraft enough that there is no need for a [[braking rocket]] to slow the final descent as is the case with Russian and Chinese manned space capsules, which return to Earth over land. The American practice came in part because American launch sites are on the coastline and launch primarily over water.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Russian launch sites are far inland and most early launch aborts were likely to descend on land.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Missions==
[[File:Apollo14 - Landung.jpg|thumb|left|[[Apollo 14]] returns to Earth, 1971]]
The splashdown method of landing was utilized for [[Mercury program|Mercury]], [[Gemini program|Gemini]] and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] (including [[Skylab]], which used Apollo capsules).  On one occasion a Soviet spacecraft, [[Soyuz 23]], unintentionally punched through the ice of a frozen lake (nearly killing the cosmonauts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videocosmos.com/soyuz23.shtm |title=Soyuz-23, Lands On A Frozen Lake |publisher=VideoCosmos |date= |accessdate=2012-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414220743/http://www.videocosmos.com/soyuz23.shtm |archivedate=2012-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On early Mercury flights, a helicopter attached a cable to the capsule, lifted it from the water and delivered it to a nearby ship. This was changed after the sinking of ''[[Liberty Bell 7]]''. All later Mercury, Gemini and Apollo capsules had a flotation collar (similar to a rubber life raft) attached to the spacecraft to increase their buoyancy. The spacecraft would then be brought alongside a ship and lifted onto deck by crane.

After the flotation collar is attached, a hatch on the spacecraft is usually opened. At that time, some astronauts decide to be hoisted aboard a helicopter for a ride to the recovery ship and some decided to stay with the spacecraft and be lifted aboard ship via crane. (Because of his overshoot aboard ''[[Aurora 7]],'' and mindful of the fate of ''Liberty Bell 7,'' [[Scott Carpenter]] alone [[:wikt:egress|egress]]ed through the nose of his capsule instead of through the hatch, waiting for recovery forces in his life raft.) All Gemini and Apollo flights (Apollos 7 to 17) used the former, while Mercury missions from Mercury 6 to Mercury 9, as well as all Skylab missions and Apollo-Soyuz used the latter, especially the Skylab flights as to preserve all medical data. During the Gemini and Apollo programs, NASA used {{MV|Retriever}} for the astronauts to practice water egress.

[[Apollo 11]] was America's first moon landing mission and marked the first time that humans walked on the surface of another planetary body. The possibility of the astronauts bringing "moon germs" back to Earth was remote, but not impossible. To contain any possible contaminants at the scene of the splashdown, the astronauts donned special Biological Isolation Garments and the outside of the suits were scrubbed prior to the astronauts being hoisted aboard {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}} and escorted safely inside a ''[[Mobile Quarantine Facility]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uss-hornet.org/history/apollo/ | USS Hornet Museum's website, "Apollo 11 &amp; 12 Recovery" written by Bob Fish (author of ''Hornet Plus Three'')&lt;/ref&gt;

The early design concept for the new U.S. Orion [[Crew Exploration Vehicle]] featured recovery on land using a combination of parachutes and airbags, although it was also designed to make a contingency splashdown (only for an in-flight abort) if needed. Due to weight considerations, the airbag design concept was dropped.  The present design concept features landings via splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/display.cfm?News_ID=37403 |title=Solar System Exploration: News &amp; Events: News Archive: NASA Announces Key Decision For Next Deep Space Transportation System |publisher=Solarsystem.nasa.gov |date=2011-05-24 |accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
The most dangerous aspect is the possibility of the spacecraft flooding and sinking. For example, when the hatch of [[Gus Grissom]]'s [[Liberty Bell 7]] capsule blew prematurely, the capsule sank and Grissom almost drowned.

Despite the fact that water helps cushion the spacecraft's landing to an extent, the impact can still be quite violent for the [[astronaut]]s.

If the capsule comes down far from any recovery forces the crew are exposed to greater danger.  As an example, Scott Carpenter in [[Mercury-Atlas 7|Mercury 7]] overshot the assigned landing zone by {{convert|400|km|sp=us}}.  These recovery operation mishaps can be mitigated by placing several vessels on standby in several different locations, but this is quite an expensive option.

'''Telegony''' is a theory in [[heredity]], holding that offspring can inherit the characteristics of a previous mate of the female parent; thus the child of a widowed or remarried woman might partake of traits of a previous husband. 

Whereas experiments in the late 19th century on several species failed to provide evidence that offspring would inherit any character from their mother's previous mates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burkhardt|first=RW|title=Closing the door on Lord Morton's mare: the rise and fall of telegony|journal=Studies in History of Biology|year=1979|volume=3|pages=1–21|pmid=11610983}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Medical citation needed|date=September 2016}} a similar phenomenon whereby environmental (non-genetic) traits were passed has been recently discovered in a species of fly.

== Etymology ==
The term was coined by [[August Weismann]] from the Greek words [[wikt:τῆλε|τῆλε]] (tèle) meaning 'far' and [[wikt:γονος|γονος]] (gonos) meaning 'offspring'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bynum|first=Bill|title=Telegony|journal=The Lancet|date=April 2002|volume=359|issue=9313|page=1256|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08200-4|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08200-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name may also refer to [[Odysseus]]' son [[Telegonus]]; the [[lost work|lost poem]] named after him is ''[[Telegony]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Early perceptions ==
{{further|Partible paternity}}

The idea of telegony goes back to [[Aristotle]]. It states that individuals can inherit traits not only from their fathers, but also from other males previously known to their mothers. in other words, it was thought that [[partible paternity|paternity could be shared]].&lt;ref name="IBTimes"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Lydia |title=Aristotle's Telegony Has Merit: Previous Male Partners Can Influence Other Men's Offspring |url=https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/aristotle-right-about-telegony-previous-partner-can-influence-another-males-offspring-1468015 |publisher=International Business Times |date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory, expounded as part of [[Aristotle's biology]], was accepted throughout Antiquity. The concept of telegonic impregnation was expressed in [[Greek mythology]] in the origins of [[Greek hero|their heroes]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Such double fatherhood, one immortal, one mortal, was a familiar feature of heroes such as [[Theseus]], who was doubly conceived in the same night. By the understanding of [[History of human sexuality#Greece|sex in Antiquity]], the mix of semen gave Theseus a combination of divine as well as mortal characteristics. Of a supposed [[Parnassos]], founder of Delphi, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' x.6.1.&lt;/ref&gt; observes, "Like the other heroes, as they are called, he had two fathers; one they say was the god [[Poseidon]], the human father being Cleopompus." Sometimes the result could be twins such as [[Castor and Pollux]], one born divine and one mortal.

The more general doctrine of "maternal impressions" was also known in Ancient Israel. The book of Genesis describes [[Jacob]] inducing goats and sheep in [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]]'s herds to bear striped and spotted young by placing dark wooden rods with white stripes in their watering troughs.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica|year=1911|volume=26|chapter=Telegony|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Telegony}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telegony influenced early Christianity as well. The [[Valentinianism|Gnostic followers]] of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinius]] (circa 100–160 CE) characteristically took the concept from the physiological world into the realm of psychology and spirituality by extending the supposed influence even to the thoughts of the woman. In the [[Gospel of Philip]], a text among those found at [[Nag Hammadi]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whomever the woman loves, to him those who are born are like; if her husband, they are like her husband; if an [[adultery|adulterer]], they are like the adulterer. Often when a woman sleeps with her husband, but while her heart is with the adulterer with whom she is accustomed to unite, she bears the one whom she bears so that he is like the adulterer.&lt;ref&gt;Gospel of Philip, p. 112. Noted in Robert M. Grant, "The Mystery of Marriage in the Gospel of Philip" ''Vigiliae Christianae'' '''15'''.3 (September 1961:129–140) p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of telegony was revived with the rediscovery of Aristotle in the Middle Ages.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} This was part of the resistance to the marriage in 1361 of [[Edward, the Black Prince]], heir to the throne of [[Edward III of England]], with [[Joan of Kent|Joan, the Fair Maid of Kent]], who had been previously married: their progeny, it was thought, might not be completely of his [[Plantagenet|Plantagenet blood]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== Understandings in the 19th century and the collapse of the theory in the 20th ==
In the 19th century, the most widely credited example was that of [[Lord Morton’s mare]], reported by the distinguished surgeon Sir [[Everard Home]], and cited by [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, ''Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication'' (1868).&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Morton bred a white [[Mare (horse)|mare]] with a wild [[quagga]] [[Stallion (horse)|stallion]],&lt;ref&gt;The [[quagga]] was a relative of the [[zebra]], now extinct.&lt;/ref&gt; and when he later bred the same mare with a white stallion, the offspring strangely had stripes in the legs, like the quagga.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gPbYbFt7sYYC&amp;pg=PA245&amp;lpg=PA245&amp;dq=lord+morton%27s+mare&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9qHq0CehKy&amp;sig=db0jgAoZRi8DomYs4wf9sT_zp40&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NwDOSfviJpCgtgOm6ZWgAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result "Lord Morton's Mare"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Surgeon-General]] of New York, the physiologist [[Austin Flint (1836–1915)|Austin Flint]], in his ''Text-Book of Human Physiology'' (fourth edition, 1888) described the phenomenon as follows:&lt;ref name=Flint&gt;{{cite book|last=Flint|first=Austin|title=Text-Book of Human Physiology|year=1888|edition=fourth|publisher=Appleton, New York|location=USA|pages=797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|A peculiar and, it seems to me, an inexplicable fact is, that previous pregnancies have an influence upon offspring. This is well known to breeders of animals. If pure-blooded mares or bitches have been once covered by an inferior male, in subsequent fecondations the young are likely to partake of the character of the first male, even if they be afterwards bred with males of unimpeachable pedigree. What the mechanism of the influence of the first conception is, it is impossible to say; but the fact is incontestable. The same influence is observed in the human subject. A woman may have, by a second husband, children who resemble a former husband, and this is particularly well marked in certain instances by the colour of the hair and eyes. A white woman who has had children by a negro may subsequently bear children to a white man, these children presenting some of the unmistakable peculiarities of the negro race.&lt;ref name=Flint/&gt;}}

Both [[Schopenhauer]] and [[Herbert Spencer]] found telegony to be a credible theory;&lt;ref name=bondeson&gt;Jan Bondeson, ''A Cabinet of Medical Curiosities'', 1999:159.&lt;/ref&gt; [[August Weismann]], on the other hand, had expressed doubts about the theory earlier and it fell out of scientific favor in the 1890s. A series of experiments by [[James Cossar Ewart]] in Scotland and other researchers in Germany and Brazil failed to find any evidence of the phenomenon. Also, the statistician [[Karl Pearson]] pointed out that, if telegony was true, later children of the same couple should increasingly resemble their father, which is not the case.&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearson|first=K.|title=Statistics of telegony|journal=Science|date=1 October 1909|volume=30|issue=770|pages=443–444|doi=10.1126/science.30.770.443-a|pmid=17777275|bibcode=1909Sci....30..443P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologists now explain the phenomenon of Lord Morton's mare with reference to the [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant and recessive]] variants of a gene: both the mare and the stallion had a recessive gene; the foal inherited these alleles and thus displayed the characteristic invisible in its parents.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In mammals, each [[spermatozoon|sperm]] has the [[haploid]] set of [[chromosome]]s and each [[ovum|egg]] has another haploid set. During the process of [[fertilization]] a [[zygote]] with the [[diploid]] set is produced. This set will be inherited by every [[somatic cell]] of a mammal, with exactly half the [[genetic material]] coming from the producer of the sperm (the father) and another half from the producer of the egg (the mother). Thus, the myth of telegony is fundamentally incompatible with our knowledge of [[genetics]] and the [[reproduction|reproductive process]]. [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] stated "All these beliefs, from inheritance of acquired traits to telegony, must now be classed as superstitions."&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/262934/heredity&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent developments ==

Telegony, once a popular theory among nineteenth century biologists, was largely dismissed with the arrival of [[Mendelian genetics]]. However, in 2014 the evolutionary ecologists A. J. Crean and colleagues reported a seemingly telegonic phenomenon in a fly, [[Neriidae|''Telostylinus angusticollis'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1= A. J. | last1= Crean | first2= A.

{{Quote|title = "Like father like son? Nongenetic paternal effects reinvigorate the possibility of telegony"|author=Crean, Kopps, and Bonduriansky
|quote = As a first step towards disentangling whether the effect is borne by the sperm itself or by accessory-gland products (ACPs) in the seminal fluid, we mated females initially to a male in high or low condition and then remated the female to a new male in high or low condition two weeks later. Interestingly, offspring size and viability were determined by the condition of the first male, with no effect of the condition of the second mate. Genetic tests confirm this result holds even when the second male is the biological father of the offspring. These findings suggest the paternal effect is mediated by ACPs, and provide a compelling case for reassessing the possibility of telegony as a valid phenomenon.&lt;ref name=ajcrean/&gt;}}

Y. S. Liu has proposed possible molecular mechanisms that may account for telegony; however, his work is predicated on the beliefs of pre-[[Gregor Mendel|Mendelian]] breeders to reinforce the idea that traits are passed from earlier matings. The proposed mechanisms include the penetration of spermatozoa into the somatic tissues of the female genital tract, the incorporation of the DNA released by spermatozoa into maternal [[somatic cell]]s, the presence of fetal DNA in maternal blood, incorporation of exogenous DNA into somatic cells, presence of fetal cells and fetal DNA in maternal blood and sperm RNA-mediated non-Mendelian inheritance of [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = Y.

== Influence in culture ==
{{See also|Scientific racism}}
Telegony influenced late [[Racism#19th century|19th-century racialist beliefs]]. A woman who had a child with a non-[[Aryan]] man, it was argued, could never have a "pure" Aryan child again. This idea was adopted by the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]].&lt;ref name=bondeson/&gt;

Telegony re-emerged within [[Russian Orthodox Church#Post-Soviet recovery and problems|post-Soviet Russian Orthodoxy]]. ''Virginity and Telegony: The Orthodox church and modern science of genetic inversions'' was published in 2004. [[Pravda.ru]] gave an overview of the concept and a brief review of the book, saying that the authors invented "scary and incredible stories" to "make women be very careful about their sexual contacts" and that the idea was being used by the Church to scare the faithful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman's first partner may become genetic father of all her kids, telegony says|url=http://www.pravdareport.com/health/27-06-2007/94136-telegony-0/|accessdate=8 November 2016|publisher=Pravda Report|date=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anna Kuznetsova]], who was appointed [[Children's Ombudsman#Russia|Children's Rights Commissioner for the Russian Federation]] in 2016, had said several years earlier that she believes in the concept, amongst other fringe views.

In [[argumentation theory]], a '''term''' is that part of a statement in an argument which refers to a specific thing. Usually, but not always expressed as a [[noun]], one of the requirements to informally prove a conclusion with a [[deductive argument]] is for all its terms to be used [[unambiguous]]ly. The ambiguous use of a term in a deductive argument may be an instance of the [[fallacy of four terms]].

The '''Tonti diagram''',&lt;ref&gt;Tonti, E.: The Mathematical Structure of Classical and Relativistic Physics, Birkhäuser (Springer) (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; created by the Italian physicist and mathematician Enzo Tonti, is a diagram that classifies variables and equations of physical theories of classical and relativistic physics. The theories involved are: ''particle dynamics, analytical mechanics, mechanics of deformable solids, fluid mechanics, electromagnetism, gravitation, heat conduction,'' and ''irreversible thermodynamics''. The classification stems from the observation that each physical variable has a well-defined association with a space and a time element, as shown in Fig. 1, which can be grasped from the corresponding global variable and from its measuring process.

== Historical note ==
The starting point of this classification stems from a remark by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]. Speaking about analogies in different physical theories, Maxwell wrote in 1871:&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J.C.: Remarks on the Mathematical Classification of Physical Quantities. Proc.
London Math. Soc. 3 (34), 258-266 (1871) Reprinted by Niven, W.D.: The Scientific Papers of J.C. Maxwell. Dover, New York (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the factors which compose it [energy], one is referred to unit of length, and the other to unit of area. This gives what I regard as a very important distinction among vector quantities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This remark leads us to a distinction between vectors referred to lines and vectors referred to surfaces. This is not customarily considered in vector calculus or in physics. In electromagnetism, hence, vectors '''E''' and '''H''' are associated with lines, and vectors '''D''' and '''B''' are associated with surfaces. This distinction leads to a classification of physical variables based on their ''association'' with space elements. 
Maxwell continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is only through the progress of science in recent times that we have become acquainted with so large a number of physical quantities that a classification of them is desirable. [...] But the classification which I now refer to is founded on the mathematical or formal analogy of the different quantities, and not on the matter to which they belong.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The classification diagram arises from an analysis of the ''association'' of physical variables in different physical theories, whatever their mathematical nature, i.e. scalars, vectors, tensors, etc., with space and time elements.

== The three kinds of physical quantities ==
Physics, compared to other natural sciences, has the great privilege of considering the [[quantity|quantitative]] attributes of physical systems and from these originate the [[physical quantity|physical quantities]], which can be [[scalar (physics)|scalars]], [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s, [[tensor]]s, etc. Physical quantities can be divided into three main categories: '''physical variables''', '''physical parameters''' and [[physical constant|'''fundamental constants''']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tonti|first1=Enzo|title=The Reason for Analogies in Physics|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEtOy8xKN-Q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global variables in space and field variables ==
The term '''space-global variables''' refers to all physical variables that are not densities of other variables. Distinguishing  between global variables and corresponding densities is essential. Mass density is given by the ratio of mass to volume, mass being the ''global'' variable. Pressure is the ratio of the normal force on an element of plane surface to the surface area, therefore the normal force is the ''global'' variable and the pressure is its surface density. The strain of a bar is the ratio of the elongation to its original length, elongation being the ''global'' variable and strain the line density.
The very fact that we create volume, surface or line densities highlights that the corresponding global variables are ''associated'' with volumes, surfaces and lines.
Every density is obtained by dividing a global variable by the extension of the ''associated'' space element. The mathematical treatment of physics also customarily considers the limit of this ratio to obtain a pointwise density, i.e. a '''field variable'''. Generally, field variables are preferred to global variables, to the extent that we express the global variables as integrals of the respective field variables, and call them '''integral variables'''.
Integral variables are global variables, but there are also global variables which are ''associated'' with points, and which, therefore, cannot be considered integral variables. Hence, global variables form a broader class compared to integral variables; for which reason, in view of the classification, the use of the term “global variables” is preferred to that of "integral variables".

== Global variables in time and rates ==
The term '''time-global variables''' is used to indicate variables that are not rates of other variables. Displacement, impulse, momentum and position vector are therefore global variables. Displacement and impulse are associated with time intervals, while momentum and position vector are associated with instants. This is evident if we think that we can perform the rates of the first two variables obtaining velocity and force respectively, while we cannot perform the rates of the last two variables.

== The three kinds of physical variables ==
The physical variables, both global variables and densities, in turn, can be divided into three classes: those characterising the ''configuration'' of a system or a field, those describing the ''source'' of a phenomenon or a field, and finally ''energy'' variables. Every physical system, even a field, has its own “configuration”, and the variables describing this configuration are called '''configuration variables'''. Each field has its sources (for example, electric charges are the source of electric fields, heat generators are the source of thermal fields and forces are the source of motion and deformation): variables describing sources are called '''source variables'''. The third category, that of '''energy variables''', is created by multiplying a configuration variable by a source variable.
The '''fundamental problem''' of a field is finding the configuration of the field at every time instant, given the spatial distribution and the intensity of its sources (which is to say: given the causes, determine the effects).

== Space and time elements ==
By the term "space elements" we intend '''points''', '''lines''', '''surfaces''' and '''volumes''', which are denoted '''P''','''L''','''S''' and '''V''' respectively.
By the term "time elements" we intend '''time instants''' and '''time intervals''', which are denoted '''I''' and '''T''' respectively.
Space elements are naturally classified according to their dimension, from the smallest to the biggest, i.e. points, lines, surfaces and volumes. The same classification applies to time elements, i.e. instants and intervals.

== Association with space elements ==
[[File:Schermata49.png|thumb|'''Figure 1'''.The figure shows a number of physical variables with the space and time elements they are ''associated'' with.]]

[[File:Margheritaq.png|thumb|'''Figure 2'''. Every space element can be endowed with one of the two possible orientations: inner and outer.]]

All fluxes (e.g. magnetic flux, electric flux, vortex flux)  make reference to a surface ('''S'''), all variables expressed by a line integral (e.g. electromotive force, velocity circulation, magnetomotive force) make reference to a line ('''L''') and all contents (e.g. of energy, mass, entropy, etc.) make reference to a volume ('''V'''). Lastly all potentials (e.g. electric potential, velocity potential, temperature) make reference to a point ('''P''').

== Association with time elements ==
A similar association exists between time-global variables and time elements. Therefore, a displacement is ''associated'' with a time interval ('''T'''), whereas a position vector is ''associated'' with a time instant ('''I'''). In this association the measuring process must be taken into account, because temperature is ''referred'' to an instant but its measurement involves a time interval - the one needed to reach thermal equilibrium. Therefore, the temperature is said to be ''associated'' with a time interval ('''T'''). Similarly, the measurement of a force requires a [[mechanical equilibrium]] to be reached, hence it is ''associated'' with a time interval ('''T''').

[[File:Ritaaa.png|thumb|'''Figure 3'''. ''Left'') A two-dimensional cell complex and its dual; ''right'') the classification of its space elements.]]

== Inherited association of field variables ==
Since in each field of physics the global variables are ''associated'' with a space and a time element, the association of the corresponding densities and the rates with the space and time element of the corresponding global variable is spontaneous. The densities and the rates are said to ''inherit'' the association from their corresponding global variables. The same inherited association remains once we have  performed the limit to obtain the field variables.

== Orientation of space elements ==
In this classification, the orientation of the space elements has a fundamental role. There are two kinds of orientation: '''inner''' and '''outer orientation''',&lt;ref&gt;Schouten, J.A.: Tensor Calculus for Physicists. 2nd ed., Dover, New York (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; as shown in Fig. 2.

There is a surprising correspondence between the role that a physical variable plays in a theory and the type of orientation of the corresponding space element: a detailed analysis of physical variables shows that ''the configuration variables are associated with the space elements endowed with inner orientation while the source and the energy variables are associated with the outer orientation.''

[[File:Greta copia.png|thumb|'''Figure 4'''. ''Left'') A three-dimensional cell complex and its dual; ''right'') the classification of its space elements.]]

== Cell complexes ==
To highlight the four space elements, it is expedient to divide a region of space into many cells, thus creating a '''cell complex'''. The vertices represent points, the edges lines, the faces surfaces and the cells themselves volumes.
Each of these elements can be given an inner orientation. Since we also need space elements with outer orientation, it is expedient to consider the '''dual complex''', obtained by joining the centroids of the cells belonging to the '''primal complex'''. Doing so, we see that the inner orientation of each element of the primal complex induces an outer orientation on the corresponding element of the dual complex.

Figures 3 and 4 show how the space elements of the primal complex, which are endowed with inner orientation, induce an outer orientation on the elements of the dual complex. Moreover, the space elements of the two complexes can be arranged in a diagram such as the one shown on the right-hand side of the figures.

A cell complex and its dual constitute a valid framework to describe the association of physical variables with the oriented space elements. To be precise, the configuration variables, which are associated with space elements with inner orientation, may be associated with the elements of the primal complex, while the source variables, which are associated with the space elements with an outer orientation, can be associated with the elements of the dual complex.

== Orientation of time elements ==

[[File:Tempo nuovo 2.png|thumb|'''Figure 5'''. Time elements. I&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = time instants; T&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = time intervals; '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = position vector; '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = displacement.]]

At first glance, the notions of inner and outer orientation of a time element may appear strange, certainly unusual. Let us consider a subdivision of the time axis into many adjacent time intervals. Doing so, we have constructed a one-dimensional cell complex in time. 
Considering now the middle instants of each time interval we have a second cell complex in time. The first complex is called ''primal'' and the second ''dual''.
 
'''Primal complex, inner orientation''': the fact that the time axis is oriented implies that each time interval is oriented: this is the inner orientation of the primal time intervals.
Since the variation of a time function φ (t) is defined as Δφ = + φ (t + h)-φ (t),  in order to conceive the "+" and "-" signs of this formula as incidence numbers between a time interval and its bounding instants, these should be considered as "sinks".

'''Dual complex, outer orientation''': the middle instant of each time interval is called ''dual time instant'' and we can give it the same orientation of the primal time interval. This is called ''outer'' orientation of the dual time instant. In turn, the time intervals connecting two adjacent dual time instants are called ''dual time intervals''. Once more we can assign them the orientation induced by the primal time instants, as shown in Fig. 5. This is called ''outer'' orientation of the dual time intervals.

==The birth of the classification diagram &lt;ref&gt;Diagrams of the various physical theories can be downloaded from the website http://www.discretephysics.org/&lt;/ref&gt; ==

[[File:Ele1.png|thumb|'''Figure 6'''. Classification diagram for electrostatics.]]

The fact that physical variables are associated with space and time elements endowed with inner or outer orientation and that space and time elements of a primal and a dual cell complex can be classified as shown on the right-hand side of Figs. 3 and 4, suggests a corresponding classification of physical variables. 
Let us consider, as an example, the classification diagram of electrostatics, shown in Fig. 6. The left column includes those physical variables associated with the primal cell complex, whose elements are endowed with inner orientation: these are the ''configuration'' variables. The right column includes those physical variables associated with the dual cell complex, whose elements are endowed with outer orientation: these are the ''source'' variables.

The equations linking the variables are contained in the rectangular boxes. The equations in each vertical column are ''balance'' equations, ''circuital'' equations and ''gradient-forming'' equations. They have a topological structure and are called '''topological equations'''. Those that link configuration variables to source variables—contained in the horizontal links—are ''material'' or ''constitutive'' equations, and belong to the category of '''phenomenological equations'''.

==The time diagram==
[[File:Par1.png|thumb|'''Figure 7'''. Classification diagram for particle dynamics.]]
Particle dynamics, analytical mechanics and electric networks make use of space-global variables that depend only on the time variable. Referring here to particle dynamics, we see that configuration variables are geometrical and kinematic variables, while source variables are static and dynamic variables. In Fig. 7 we see that kinematic variables lie in the left column while dynamic variables lie in the right one. The diagram shows three phenomenological equations: those connecting two variables on the same level describe a reversible relation (i.e. a non-dissipative relation), while those linking force with velocity describe an irreversible relation (i.e. a dissipative relation). The dissipative nature is shown by the fact that one variable, velocity, changes sign under reversal of motion, while the other, force, does not.

==The space-time diagram==
[[File:E Tonti Classification diagrams mechanical and field theories.png|thumb|'''Figure 8'''. The two classification diagrams of space-time elements.]] 
Since every global physical variable is associated with both a time and a space element, it appears useful to have a classification diagram combining space and time elements.   
When the four space elements '''P''', '''L''', '''S''' and '''V''' are coupled with the two time elements  '''I''' and '''T''' we obtain eight possible combinations. Furthermore, if one considers that each space element and each time element can be endowed with two orientations, inner and outer, we must combine the 4x2 oriented space elements with the 2x2 oriented time elements, thus obtaining 32 possible space-time combinations. Fig. 8 shows the two possible classification diagrams of the space-time elements.
The first version associates the space elements endowed with inner orientation with the time elements endowed with inner orientation and vice versa: it is the case of mechanics in all its manifestations, such as particle and analytical mechanics, mechanics of deformable solids and fluid mechanics. The second version associates the space elements endowed with inner orientation with the time elements endowed with outer orientation and vice versa. It is the case of field theories such as electromagnetism, gravitation, thermal conduction and irreversible thermodynamics.

The space-time diagrams show clearly which phenomenological equations describe irreversible phenomena: they are the ones that link variables that are on the same level but connect a box on the front-left side with a box on the back-right side.

'''Travelling to the Earth's center''' is a popular [[List of science fiction themes|theme in science fiction]]. Some [[subterranean fiction]] involves traveling to the Earth's center and finding either a [[Hollow Earth]] or  [[Inner core|Earth's molten core]].

[[planetary science|Planetary scientist]] [[David J. Stevenson]] suggested sending a [[Space probe|probe]] to the core as a [[thought experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Hollow Earth==
{{Main|Hollow Earth}}
The idea of a so-called "[[Hollow Earth]]", once popular in fantasy adventure literature, is that the planet [[Earth]] has a hollow interior and an inner surface habitable by human beings.  Although the scientific community has made clear that this is [[pseudoscience]], the idea nevertheless is a less popular feature of many [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] stories and of some [[conspiracy theories]].

==In science fiction==
The most famous example of a hollow-Earth fantasy is [[Jules Verne]]'s 1864 science-fiction novel ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'', which has been adapted many times as a feature film and for television.

The 2003 film ''[[The Core]]'', loosely based on the novel ''[[Core (novel)|Core]]'', tells the story of a team that has to drill to the center of the Earth and detonate a series of nuclear explosions in order to restart the rotation of Earth's core. The drilling equipment, dubbed ''Virgil'', includes a powerful, snake-like laser drill, a small nuclear reactor for power, a shell (of "[[unobtainium]]", a fictional material) to protect against intense heat and pressure (and generate energy to drive the engine), a powerful [[X-ray vision|x-ray camera]] for viewing outside, and a system of impellers for movement and control. The only part of the Earth that turns out to be hollow is a gigantic [[geode]], and soon after the drill moves through it, the hole it created fills with magma.

The 1986 animated television show [[Inhumanoids]] featured regular visits to the Inner Core in most of its 13 episodes. Each of the three villainous creatures theoretically ruled over certain layers of the inner earth, and their evil schemes were thwarted by the human Earth Corps, who often allied with various races of subterranean beings equally threatened by the Inhumanoids.

During season 3 of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' cartoon]], the [[Technodrome]] is located at the Earth's core, and transport modules are used to drill up to the streets. This season also features the episode "Turtles at the Earth's Core", where a dinosaur lives in a deep cave, and a crystal of energy that works like the [[Sun]] to keep the dinosaurs alive.
As [[Krang]], [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]], [[Bebop and Rocksteady]] steal the crystal to power the Technodrome, the trouble begins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-1987/turtles-at-the-earths-core-67177/|title=Turtles at the Earth's Core|publisher=[[TV.com]]|date=1 November 1989|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don Rosa]]'s 1995 ''[[Uncle Scrooge]]'' story ''[[The Universal Solvent (comics)|The Universal Solvent]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Solvent|url=http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=D+94066|website=coa.inducks.org|ref=Inducks}}&lt;/ref&gt; imagines a way to travel to the planet's core using 1950s technology, although this would be impossible in reality. The fictional solvent referred to in the story's title has the power to condense everything except diamonds into a kind of super-dense dust. The solvent is accidentally spilled and, as it dissolves everything in its path, it bores a cylindrical shaft into the center of the planet. As part of a recovery effort, a makeshift platform is constructed that descends into the shaft in [[free fall]], automatically deploying an electric motor and wheels as it approaches [[Weightlessness#Zero gravity|zero gravity]], then using rocket engines to enable it to ascend again to the Earth's surface. The author Rosa describes this fantasy journey in great detail: the supposed structure of the Earth is illustrated, and the shaft is kept in a [[vacuum]] to protect against the lethal several thousand kilometers of atmosphere that it would otherwise be exposed to. The ducks must wear [[space suit]]s and go without food for several days, and they are not entirely certain that the super-dense [[heat shield]] will hold. The author maintains continuity with [[Carl Barks]], explaining that the earthquakes in the story are created by spherical Fermies and Terries.

In [[Tales to Astonish]] #2 (1959) "I Fell to the Center of the Earth", an archaeologist named Dr. Burke who is on an expedition to Asia travels to the center of the Earth (and also, as he later finds out, backwards in time)--and encounters [[neanderthals]] and [[dinosaurs]].

In the [[Doctor Who]] episode, ''[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]'', a Racnoss warship is found at the center of the planet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6714">The '''Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence''' is a position within the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] responsible for directing the Treasury's efforts to cut the lines of financial support for terrorists, fight financial crime, enforce economic sanctions against [[rogue nations]], and combat the financial support of the proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]]. The Under Secretary is appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

The current Under Secretary is [[Sigal Mandelker]], appointed by President [[Donald Trump]], and confirmed to the position by the Senate on June 21, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/nomination/115th-congress/172&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
The Under Secretary heads the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI), created under 31 USC 312, when the administration of President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] announced on May 8, 2004, that the Executive Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes (TFFC), the [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] (FinCEN), the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] (OFAC), and allocated resources from the Treasury Department would be brought under the new office's control. The Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence also possesses oversight of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, created under 31 USC 311, [one of sixteen agencies in the United States Intelligence Community per 50 USC 3003]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bush Administration Announces Creation of New Office in Ramped up Effort to Fight the Financial War on Terror | url=http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/js1219.htm | accessdate= September 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Reserve]] remains outside the jurisdiction of this office, and cannot be investigated by it.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}.

==History==
The position's predecessor, the Under Secretary for Enforcement, managed law enforcement aspects of the Department prior to the reorganization. The Under Secretary for Enforcement provided oversight and policy guidance for the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]], the [[U.S. Customs Service]], the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]]; the [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]], the [[U.S. Secret Service]], the Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture, and the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]]. The Under Secretary also provided policy guidance over the [[Internal Revenue Service]]'s Crime Investigation.&lt;ref name="b"&gt;{{cite web | title=U.S. Treasury - Biography of Jimmy Gurule, Under Secretary for Enforcement | url=http://www.treas.gov/organization/bios/gurule-e.html | accessdate= September 21, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071003045324/http://www.treas.gov/organization/bios/gurule-e.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=U.S. Treasury - Duties &amp; Functions of the Under Secretary of Enforcement | url=http://www.treas.gov/education/duties/treas/u-sec-enforcement.shtml  | accessdate= February 13, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060213064754/http://www.treas.gov/education/duties/treas/u-sec-enforcement.shtml |archivedate = February 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of these agencies are now non-existent or have been moved into other federal departments. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms was split into two separate bureaus, with one handling certain law enforcement aspects and the other handling tax collection aspects. The former was moved into the [[United States Department of Justice]], while the latter was kept within the Department of the Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=About TTB:Home | url=http://www.ttb.gov/about/index.htm  | accessdate= June 18, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060618080606/http://www.ttb.gov/about/index.htm |archivedate = June 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center are now within the [[Department of Homeland Security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United States Secret Service: History | url=http://www.ustreas.gov/usss/history.shtml | accessdate= September 21, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071004233514/http://www.ustreas.gov/usss/history.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Welcome to FLETC — Federal Law Enforcement Training Center | url=http://www.fletc.gov/ | accessdate= September 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Customs Service was moved into the Department of Homeland Security when it became part of the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CBP.gov - home page | url=http://www.cbp.gov/ | accessdate= September 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under the Homeland Security Act of 2002&lt;ref name="Homeland Security Act of 2002"&gt;[[Homeland Security Act of 2002]] Homeland Security Act of 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Custom Service's "revenue functions" were retained by Treasury.

The '''village idiot''' in strict terms is a person locally known for [[ignorance]] or [[stupidity]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/village+idiot Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; but is also a common term for a stereotypically silly or nonsensical person or [[stock character]]. The term is also used as a [[stereotype]] of the mentally disabled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/wflr6&amp;div=10&amp;id=&amp;page= Siegel, L.J.,  1970:  The Justifications for Medical Commitment--Real or Illusory.] ''Wake Forest Intramural Law Review'', 6, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been applied as an [[epithet]] for an unrealistically optimistic or naive individual.&lt;ref&gt;Culebras, A., 1997: The village idiot. ''European Journal of Neurology'' 4, 535–536.&lt;/ref&gt;

The village idiot was long considered an acceptable [[social role]], a unique individual who was dependent yet contributed to the social fabric of his community.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, M., 1989: Disability and dependency: a creation of industrial societies? In ''Disability and Dependency'' (Len Barton, ed.), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1-85000-616-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as [[Byzantine]] times, the "village idiot" was treated as an acceptable form of disabled  individual compatible with then-prevailing normative conceptions of social order. The concept of a "village savant" or "village genius" is closely related, often tied to the concept of pre-industrial [[anti-intellectualism]], as both figures are subjects of both pity and derision.&lt;ref&gt;Dols, M.W., 1987:  Insanity and its treatment in Islamic society. ''Medical History'' 31, 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  The social roles of the two are combined and applied, especially in the sociopolitical context, in the European medieval/Renaissance [[court jester]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2087">'''Water cascade analysis''' ('''WCA''') is a technique to calculate the minimum flowrate target for feedwater and [[wastewater]] for continuous water-using processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.utm.my/6893/ Water cascade analysis technique for minimum flowrate targeting]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==
It is a [[tabular]] and numerical alternative to the water surplus diagram in [[Water Pinch]] which can be used to identify opportunities for reduction in feedwater usage and the design of water distribution networks. The WCA is done in three steps, a global analysis of water distribution and consumption in the network, establishing baseline minimum [[water]] targets and redesign of the water network to achieve these targets.

==History==
WCA was first introduced by Manan, Tan and Foo in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Manan | first1 = Z. A. | last2 = Tan | first2 = Y. L. | last3 = Foo | first3 = C. Y. | year = 2004 | title = Targeting the Minimum Water Flowrate Using Water Cascade Analysis Technique | url = | journal = AIChE Journal | volume = 50 | issue = 12| pages = 3169–3183| doi = 10.1002/aic.10235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has been widely used as a tool for water conservation in industrial process plants. A Time dependent water cascade analysis was presented later on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kolmetz.com/pdf/Foo/Dominic%20Foo%27s%20thesis%202.pdf Time dependent water cascade analysis]&lt;/ref&gt; A variation of the WCA is the [[gas cascade analysis]] (GCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ie051322k | volume=45 | title=Setting the Minimum Utility Gas Flowrate Targets Using Cascade Analysis Technique | year=2006 | journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research | pages=5986–5995 | last1 = Chwan Yee Foo | first1 = Dominic | last2 = Abdul Manan | first2 = Zainuddin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
