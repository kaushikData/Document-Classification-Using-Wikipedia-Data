An '''attempted coup d'état''' occurred in [[Cameroon]] in 1984; presidential palace guards unsuccessfully tried to overthrow President [[Paul Biya]], resulting in fighting that began on April 6, 1984, and ended several days later. The coup attempt is widely viewed as one of the most crucial events in the history of Cameroon since independence in 1960.&lt;ref name="the_politics_of_cultural_difference_in_northern_cameroon_a01"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Burnham | first1 = Philip | title = The politics of cultural difference in northern Cameroon | year = 1996 | publisher = Edinburgh University Press for the International African Institute | location = Edinburgh  | isbn = 978-0-7486-0812-6 | pages = 39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
After nearly 23 years as President of Cameroon, [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]] resigned for unclear reasons in November 1982 and was succeeded by Prime Minister Paul Biya. Despite his resignation, Ahidjo remained President of the [[Cameroon National Union]] (CNU), the ruling party, and retained enormous political influence. Although Ahidjo's resignation was voluntary and he was initially happy to see Biya take his place as President (although Biya was a Christian from the south and Ahidjo was a Muslim from the north), a power struggle between the two developed in 1983. Ahidjo attempted to assert his supremacy by arguing that the party should make policy decisions and that the state should merely implement them, but Biya in turn pointed out that the constitution assigned responsibility for determining policy to the President of the Republic. Ahidjo went into exile in July 1983, and on August 22, 1983, Biya publicly accused Ahidjo of plotting a coup, while simultaneously dismissing two key Ahidjo loyalists&amp;mdash;Prime Minister [[Maigari Bello Bouba]] and Minister of State for the Armed Forces [[Maikano Abdoulaye]]&amp;mdash;from the government. Ahidjo bitterly criticized Biya from exile, accusing him of paranoia and misrule, and he resigned as President of the CNU. In February 1984 he was sentenced to death ''in absentia'' for alleged involvement in the 1983 coup plot, although the sentence was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment by Biya.

In early April 1984, President Biya ordered a transfer of all presidential palace guards who came from the predominantly Muslim north, probably because he had been alerted to a coup plot involving those soldiers. Dissident members of the palace guard promptly reacted to the order by rebelling against Biya; the plot's leaders may have been forced to launch their coup attempt prematurely due to Biya's order to relocate the soldiers away from the capital, [[Yaoundé]]. An important factor was [[Cameroon Air Force]], which remained loyal to the president.&lt;ref name=erwan&gt;Erwan de Cherisey. ''Siły Powietrzne Kamerunu'' [Cameroon Air Force], "Lotnictwo" 7-8/2017, p. 78-79 (in Polish)&lt;/ref&gt;  After several days of heavy fighting in Yaoundé, Biya loyalists defeated the rebels. Estimates of the death toll ranged from 71 (according to the government)&lt;ref name=WP&gt;Jonathan C. Randal, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/19/AR2006071901340_pf.html "Tales of Ex-Leader's Role In Revolt Stun Cameroon"], ''The Washington Post'', April 15, 1984, page A01.&lt;/ref&gt; to about 1,000.&lt;ref&gt;Milton H. Krieger and Joseph Takougang, ''African State and Society in the 1990s: Cameroon's Political Crossroads'' (2000), Westview Press, pages 65&amp;ndash;74.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 1,000 accused dissidents were arrested shortly afterward, and 35 of them were immediately sentenced to death and executed. The government declared a [[state of emergency]] lasting six months in Yaoundé and the surrounding region.

Although Ahidjo was not overtly involved in the coup attempt, it was widely believed that he had masterminded it from exile.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; The failure of the coup attempt was followed by Biya's full consolidation of power; in 1985 he relaunched the CNU as the [[Cameroon People's Democratic Movement]] (CPDM).

The '''2012 Indian Ocean migrant boat disaster''' occurred on 21 June 2012, when a boat carrying more than 200 refugees capsized in the Indian Ocean between the Indonesian island of [[Java]] and the Australian external territory of [[Christmas Island]]. As of 25 June 109 people have been rescued, 17 bodies have been recovered, and approximately 70 people remain missing.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18575583|title=Boat sinking reignites Australia asylum debate|date=25 June 2012|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boat's passengers were all male and were mostly from [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news|title=90 Still Missing After Boat Capsizes off Indonesia|author=Rod McGuirk|date=22 June 2012|agency=Associated Press|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/90-missing-boat-capsizes-off-indonesia-16625779#.T-S1mpG8jbw|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boat was discovered by an [[Australian Customs and Border Protection Service]] surveillance plane {{convert|109|nmi|km}} south of Java at about 3:00 pm [[Time in Australia|AWST]].&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;{{cite news|first=Glenda|last=Kwek|author2=Coorey, Phillip| title=Dozens feared dead as packed asylum boat capsizes off Christmas Island|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/dozens-feared-dead-as-packed-asylum-boat-capsizes-off-christmas-island-20120622-20rnz.html#ixzz1yTCJ1d4H|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=22 June 2012|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boat had sent out a distress call on 19 June, but it failed to identify its location. On 20 June, the boat sent out a second distress call, at which point Australian authorities advised the boat to return to Indonesia. The boat was spotted later that day by a surveillance plane as it continued toward Australian waters.  "No visual signs of distress" were observed by the plane's crew.&lt;ref name=AP /&gt; Australian authorities then began to prepare to respond when the boat would enter their territory, but it capsized before leaving Indonesian waters.&lt;ref name=AP /&gt;

About 40 survivors were found clinging to the upturned boat, while others were found on floating debris up to four miles (6 km) from the disaster's location.&lt;ref name=AP /&gt; Survivors and bodies of the deceased were transported to Christmas Island aboard the patrol boat {{HMAS|Wollongong|ACPB 92|6}}.&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt; Rescue efforts were coordinated by Indonesian authorities with assistance from Australia.&lt;ref name="Age001"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/political-news/disaster-at-sea-dozens-feared-dead-20120621-20r3f.html|title=Disaster at sea: dozens feared dead|work=The Age|date=22 June 2012|accessdate=22 June 2012|author1=Grattan, Michelle |author2=Gordon, Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight Australian and Indonesian ships, plus five Australian aircraft, were still searching for additional survivors on 22 June.&lt;ref name=AP /&gt; Australian Home Affairs Minister [[Jason Clare]] stated that the prospect of finding additional survivors was "increasingly grim", due to rough seas.&lt;ref name=AP /&gt;

Human traffickers often disable their boats once they have entered Australian waters and send out distress calls to have their "cargo" picked up.&lt;ref name=AP /&gt; Christmas Island is a popular target for asylum seekers, whose journeys sometimes end in tragedy.  In a statement, the U.N. refugee agency said the tragedy "reinforces the need for renewed international solidarity and cooperation to find protection options for people".&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

Alexander James Ashburner Nix was born on 1 May 1975.&lt;ref name="Dwilson 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Dwilson | first=Stephanie Dube | title=Alexander Nix: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know | website=''Heavy.com'' | date=18 March 2018 | url=https://heavy.com/news/2018/03/alexander-nix-cambridge-analytica-photos-bio/ | access-date=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father Paul David Ashburner Nix (1944–2007) was an investment manager who spent twenty-seven years with the [[M&amp;G Investments|M&amp;G Group]] before joining Consulta in 1995, and was a shareholder of [[SCL Group]]. 

The Ashburner Nix family were wealthy bankers for several generations and had long-standing ties to [[India]] dating back to the [[East India Company]]'s rule from the mid 18th century; family members were prominent merchants and administrators in British-ruled India. His family owned [[Tilgate Park|Tilgate House]], a large manor and 2,185-acre estate in the [[Crawley]] area. It was purchased by the wealthy Indian-born businessman George Ashburner in 1862 and inherited by his daughter Sarah (born 1845 in [[Calcutta]]), who in 1865 married banker John Hennings Nix, one of the partners in the London [[private banking|private bank]] [[Fuller, Banbury, Nix &amp; Co]].&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;Joseph J.

Alexander Nix grew up in [[Notting Hill]], in [[West London (sub-region)|West London]], attended fee-paying [[Eton College]], and studied [[art history]] at the [[University of Manchester]]. He later worked as a financial analyst with Baring Securities in [[Mexico]]&lt;ref name= "Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=84602539&amp;privcapId=72454231|title= Executive Profile: Alexander Nix BA: Director, SCL Group Limited |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|publisher= Bloomberg L.P. | accessdate=19 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for Robert Fraser &amp; Partners LLP, a tax and corporate finance firm.&lt;ref name= "Campaign"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/author/4677/Alexander-Nix|title=Alexander Nix Profile|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|work=Campaign| accessdate=19 March 2018|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Nix left finance to join the [[SCL Group]].

===Family and personal life===
[[File:Pausvillaen Christian Benneches vei 6 Bygdøy Oslo.jpeg|thumb|250 px|[[Villa Paus]] in fashionable [[Bygdøy]], [[Oslo]] was built for Olympia Paus' family in 1907 and is now the home of billionaire [[Petter Stordalen]].]]
Nix is married to [[Olympia Paus]] (Caroline Victoria Olympia Paus), a Norwegian shipping heiress of aristocratic origin who was born in Athens in 1976 and raised in London. Norwegian newspaper ''[[Dagbladet]]'' noted that Olympia Paus belongs to one of Norway's most prominent families, and both her parents independently have large fortunes.

On her father's side she belongs to the aristocratic [[Paus family]] ({{IPA-no|ˈpæʉs|pron}}), a family of steel industrialists and ship-owners that has been part of the Norwegian elite since medieval times, and her mother [[Cecilie Paus]] (née Wilhelmsen) belongs to the billionaire Wilhelmsen family and has been one of the main owners of [[Wilh. Wilhelmsen]], one of the world's largest shipping companies, since 1978. Olympia Paus is a granddaughter of shipping magnate [[Tom Wilhelmsen (shipping magnate)|Tom Wilhelmsen]]. 

Her father's family had close ties to the royal family in Norway during the 20th century and her great-grandfather, Count [[Peder Anker Wedel-Jarlsberg]], was [[Lord Chamberlain]], the King's close confidant and the highest-ranking nobleman in Norway; his rank of "[[Count#Scandinavia|feudal count]]" would broadly correspond to Duke in the United Kingdom. Her 2nd great-grandfather, steel industrialist [[Ole Paus (businessman)|Ole Paus]], was a first cousin of playwright [[Henrik Ibsen]]; [[Villa Paus]] in Oslo was built for him. She is also related to Count [[Christopher de Paus]], a philanthropist and papal chamberlain, and her uncle is the businessman [[Peder Paus (businessman)|Peder Paus]] who is married to a former [[marchioness]]. 

Olympia Paus has never lived in Norway as her parents left the country in 1972 for Athens and London, where her father Christopher Paus worked in the shipping industry and as an investor; he has been reported to own shares worth close to 100 million British pounds in companies in the offshore petroleum industry. Olympia is the sister of designer and socialite [[Pontine Paus]] who also lives in London. In 2012 Nix and Olympia Paus purchased a home in [[Notting Hill]] for around 5 million pounds. They have three children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/alexander-nix-norske-kone-er-rederarving-og-star-midt-i-facebook-skandalen/69689638|title=Alexander Nix' norske kone er rederarving og står midt i Facebook-skandalen|trans-title=Alexander Nix's Norwegian wife is a shipowner and stands in the midst of the Facebook scandal|work=[[Dagbladet]]|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Cambridge Analytica===
In 2013, Nix set up [[Cambridge Analytica]] as an offshoot of the SCL Group, to target voters in "more than 40 political campaigns in the US, Caribbean, South America, Europe, Africa and Asia".&lt;ref name="Campaign"/&gt; In the United States, it was involved in the 2014 midterm elections and the 2016 presidential primaries and election, during which it received funding from the [[Robert Mercer (businessman)|Mercer family]]. Nix's firm supported both the [[Ted Cruz]] and [[Donald Trump]] campaigns for the US presidency by using "psychographic" profiles of voters built on data harvested from Facebook.&lt;ref name="NYT-CA-Trump"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html|title=How Trump Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions|last=Rosenberg|first=Matthew|date=17 March 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Eric|last=Auchard|title=May very concerned by Facebook data abuse reports|date=19 March 2018|url=https://uk.mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUKKBN1GV1V2|agency=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016]], Nix's firm was involved in supporting [[Leave.EU]] with its [[Brexit]] campaign, according to both [[Arron Banks]] of Leave.EU, former Cambridge Analytica employee [[Christopher Wylie]], Cambridge Analytica's business development director Brittany Kaiser, and Leave.EU's communications director Andy Wigmore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.businessinsider.com/cambridge-analytica-has-contradicted-itself-on-its-work-for-leaveeu-2018-3 Business Insider 21 March 2018: "All the times Cambridge Analytica gave brazenly contradictory accounts of its murky work on Brexit"]; retrieved 22 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Observer 26 February 2018"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/robert-mercer-breitbart-war-on-media-steve-bannon-donald-trump-nigel-farage The Observer, 26 February 2018: Robert Mercer: the big data billionaire waging war on mainstream media]; retrieved 22 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Observer 17 March 2018"&gt;{{cite web|last= Cadwallader|first= Carole| authorlink1=Carole Cadwallader|title=The Cambridge Analytica Files : 'I made Steve Bannon's psychological warfare tool': meet the data war whistleblower|date= 17 March 2018|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump|website= The Observer|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, according to Wigmore, the work for Leave.EU was done ''[[pro bono]]'', without any money changing hand: “Because Nigel [Farage] is a good friend of the Mercers. And Robert Mercer introduced them to us. He said, ‘Here’s this company we think may be useful to you.’ What they were trying to do in the US and what we were trying to do had massive parallels. We shared a lot of information. Why wouldn’t you?” Behind Trump’s campaign and Cambridge Analytica, he said, were “the same people. It’s the same family.”&lt;ref name="Observer 26 February 2018"/&gt;

In February 2018, Nix told the British parliament's [[Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee]] that his company had not received data from Facebook;&lt;ref name= "Observer 17 March 2018"/&gt; following further media reports the committee's chairman, [[Damian Collins]], said "We will be contacting Alexander Nix next week asking him to explain his comments."&lt;ref name= "Observer 19 March 2018"&gt;{{cite news| last1= Cadwalladr | first1= Carole| authorlink1= Carole Cadwalladr | last2= Graham-Harrison | first2= Emma| title= Facebook and Cambridge Analytica face mounting pressure over data scandal |date= 19 March 2018| url= https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/18/cambridge-analytica-and-facebook-accused-of-misleading-mps-over-data-breach| work= [[The Observer]]| accessdate= 19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nix denies deliberately misleading the parliamentary Select Committee.&lt;ref name= "BBC News 19 March 2018"&gt;{{cite web| last= Rajan | first= Amol | title= Data and the threat to democracy|date= 19 March 2018| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43461779| publisher= [[BBC News]]| accessdate= 19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, ''[[The Observer]]'' reported that Nix talked "unguardedly about the company's practices" when he was secretly filmed by [[Channel 4 News]] reporters posing as prospective clients and that Cambridge Analytica was trying to stop the broadcast of the resulting programme.&lt;ref name="Observer 19 March 2018" /&gt; Nix offered "beautiful [[Prostitution in Ukraine|Ukrainian girls]]" to discredit political opponents in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/british-firm-sends-girls-to-entrap-politicians-wpthxqhwv Cambridge Analytica sends 'girls' to entrap politicians]". ''The Times''. 20 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The secret filming was screened on 19 March as part of a 30-minute segment, with a follow-up scheduled for the next day, focusing on its involvement in the Trump campaign. The conversation appears to portray Nix including entrapment and bribery as potential Cambridge Analytica services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/cambridge-analytica-alexander-nix.html|title=Cambridge Analytica, Trump-Tied Political Firm, Offered to Entrap Politicians|last=Rosenberg|first=Matthew|date=19 March 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=20 March 2018|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 March 2018, Nix was suspended from Cambridge Analytica.&lt;ref name="bbcnix" /&gt;

On 11 April 2018, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' published an article about the CEO position at Cambridge Analytica, saying Nix "has officially resigned from his position, according to a person close to the company", but also that a "company spokesman ... denied that Mr. Nix had submitted his resignation".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/cambridge-analytica-ceo-post-goes-to-julian-wheatland-1523474751&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 2018, Cambridge Analytica announced they were "closing and starting insolvency proceedings".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/02/cambridge-analytica-closing-down-after-facebook-row-reports-say&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 October 2018, the Guardian reported that Nix referred to the [[Mia Mottley]], the elected Prime Minister of [[Barbados]] and other government figures via the racial slur of "[[Nigger]]s" in email communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/08/former-cambridge-analytica-chief-alexander-nix-used-n-word-to-describe-barbados-pm|title=Former Cambridge Analytica chief used N-word to describe Barbados PM|last=Garside|first=Juliette|last2=Osborne|first2=Hilary|date=2018-10-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emerdata ===

On 23 January 2018, Nix was appointed director of Emerdata Ltd.,&lt;ref name="emerdata"&gt;{{cite web |title=EMERDATA LIMITED Filing History|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10911848/officers |website=Companies House |accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new company incorporated in August 2017, along with SCL chairman Julian Wheatland and Cambridge Analytica chief data officer Alexander Tayler.

'''Beat music''', '''British beat''', or '''Merseybeat''' (after bands from [[Liverpool]] and nearby areas beside the [[River Mersey]]) is a [[popular music]] genre that developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1960s. Beat music is a fusion of [[rock and roll]] (mainly [[Chuck Berry]] guitar style and the [[midtempo]] beat of artists like [[Buddy Holly]]), [[doo-wop]], [[skiffle]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} The genre provided many of the bands responsible for the [[British Invasion]] of the American pop charts starting in 1964, and provided the model for many important developments in pop and rock music, including the format of the [[rock group]] around [[lead guitar|lead]], [[Rhythm guitar|rhythm]] and [[bass guitar]]s with [[drum kit|drums]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Origin==
The exact origins of the terms 'beat music' and 'Merseybeat' are uncertain. The "beat" in each, however, derived from the driving [[rhythm]]s which the bands had adopted from their rock and roll, rhythm and blues and soul music influences, rather than the [[Beat Generation]] literary movement of the 1950s. As the initial wave of rock and roll declined in the later 1950s, "big beat" music, later shortened to "beat", became a live dance alternative to the balladeers like [[Tommy Steele]], [[Marty Wilde]] and [[Cliff Richard]] who were dominating the charts.&lt;ref name=Longhurst&gt;B. Longhurst, ''Popular Music and Society'' (Polity, 2nd edn., 2007), {{ISBN|0-7456-3162-2}}, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The German anthropologist and music critic [[Ernest Bornemann|Ernest Borneman]], who lived in England from 1933 to 1960, claimed to have coined the term in a column in ''Melody Maker'' magazine to describe the British imitation of American Rock'n'Roll, Rhythm and Blues and Skiffle bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Borneman |first1=Ernest |title=Sex im Volksmund. Der obszöne Wortschatz der Deutschen |date=1984 |publisher=Manfred Pawlak |location=Herrsching |isbn=3-88199-145-X |page=[4] |language=German |chapter=Über die sexuelle Umgangssprache |quote="Während der fünfziger Jahre schrieb ich eine wöchentliche Spalte in der englischen Musikzeitschrift 'Melody Maker'. Um den englischen Imitationen der amerikanischen Rhythm-and-Blues, Rock-and-Roll und Skiffle Bands einen Namen zu geben, erfand ich das Wort 'beat music', das sich mittlerweile in vielen Sprachen eingebürgert hat."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''[[Mersey Beat (magazine)|Mersey Beat]]'' was used for a Liverpool music magazine founded in 1961 by [[Bill Harry]]. Harry claims to have coined the term "based on a [[Beat (police)|policeman's beat]] and not that of the music".&lt;ref name=Harry/&gt; The band the Pacifics were renamed the Mersey Beats in February 1962 by [[Bob Wooler]], [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] at the [[Cavern Club]], and in April that year they became [[the Merseybeats]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Eder and R. Unterberger, [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p4903/biography "The Merseybeats"], ''Allmusic'', retrieved 16 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of the Beatles in 1963, the terms Mersey sound and Merseybeat were applied to bands and singers from Liverpool, the first time in British pop music that a sound and a location were linked together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Zx_OpMptTFQC&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Beat Goes on: Liverpool, Popular Music and the Changing City (editors Marion Leonard, Robert Strachan) |page=11|author=Ian Inglis|chapter=Historical approaches to Merseybeat|publisher=Liverpool University Press|year= 2010  |accessdate=20 June 2013|isbn=9781846311901 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalent scenes in Birmingham and London were described as [[Brum beat]] and the [[Tottenham]] Sound respectively.&lt;ref&gt;B. Eder, [http://www.allmusic.com/album/r210426 "Various artists: ''Brum Beat: the Story of the 60s Midland Sound''"], ''Allmusic'', retrieved 5 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The most distinctive characteristic of beat music was its strong beat, using the [[Beat (music)#Backbeat|backbeat]] common to [[rock and roll]] and [[rhythm and blues]], but often with a driving emphasis on all the beats of 4/4 bar.&lt;ref&gt;P. Hurry, M. Phillips and M. Richards, ''Heinemann Advanced Music'' (Heinemann, 2001), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; The rhythm itself—described by [[Alan Clayson]] as "a changeless four-four offbeat on the snare drum"—was developed in the clubs in [[Hamburg]], West Germany, where many English groups, including the Beatles, performed in the early 1960s and where it was known as the ''mach schau'' (make show) beat.&lt;ref name=stratton /&gt; The 8/8 rhythm was flexible enough to be adopted for songs from a range of genres. In addition, according to music writer [[Dave Laing]],&lt;ref name=stratton&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=cK-gFIUijQYC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=%22beat+music%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22beat%20music%22&amp;f=false |title=Britpop and the English Music Tradition (editors Andy Bennett, Jon Stratton) |pages=41–46|author=Jon Stratton|chapter=Englishing Popular Music in the 1960s|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2010|year=2010 |accessdate=2 July 2013|isbn=9780754668053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[T]he chord playing of the rhythm guitar was broken up into a series of separate strokes, often one to the bar, with the regular plodding of the bass guitar and crisp drumming behind it.  This gave a very different effect from the monolithic character of rock, in that the beat was given not by the duplication of one instrument in the rhythm section by another, but by an interplay between all three. This flexibility also meant that beat music could cope with a greater range of time-signatures and song shapes than rock &amp; roll had been able to".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beat groups usually had simple [[guitar]]-dominated line-ups, with [[Human voice|vocal]] [[harmonies]] and catchy tunes.&lt;ref&gt;J. Shepherd, ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Volume II: Performance and Production'' (Continuum, 2003), {{ISBN|0-8264-6322-3}}, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common instrumentation of beat groups featured lead, rhythm and bass guitars plus drums, as popularized by [[the Beatles]], [[The Searchers (band)|the Searchers]], and others.&lt;ref name=Longhurst /&gt; Beat groups—even those with a separate lead singer—often sang both verses and choruses in [[Close and open harmony|close harmony]], resembling doo wop, with nonsense syllables in the backing vocals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nell Irvin Painter]], ''Creating Black Americans: African-American History and Its Meanings, 1619 to the Present'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence==
[[File:Dave Clark Five 1966.JPG|thumb|[[The Dave Clark Five]] appearing on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1966]]
In the late 1950s, a flourishing culture of groups began to emerge, often out of the declining [[skiffle]] scene, in major urban centres in the UK like Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham and London. This was particularly true in Liverpool, where it has been estimated that there were around 350 different bands active, often playing ballrooms, concert halls and clubs.&lt;ref name=Harry&gt;[http://www.triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/about/founders-story2.shtml Mersey Beat - the founders' story].&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool was perhaps uniquely placed within Britain to be the point of origin of a new form of music. Commentators have pointed to a combination of local solidarity, [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]], social deprivation, and the existence of a large population of Irish origin, the influence of which has been detected in Beat music.&lt;ref name=Stakes2001/&gt; It was also a major port with links to America, which made for much greater access to American records and instruments like guitars, which could not easily be imported due to trade restrictions.&lt;ref name=Stakes2001&gt;R. Stakes, "Those boys: the rise of Mersey beat", in S. Wade, ed., ''Gladsongs and Gatherings: Poetry and its Social Context in Liverpool Since the 1960s'' (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-85323-727-1}}, pp. 157–66.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Beat bands were heavily influenced by American groups of the era, such as [[The Crickets|Buddy Holly and the Crickets]] (from which group [[the Beatles]] derived their name, combining it with a pun on the beat in their music),{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 27, track 4}} and to a lesser extent by [[British rock and roll]] groups such as [[the Shadows]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Everett, ''The Beatles as Musicians: The Quarry Men through Rubber Soul'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-514105-9}}, pp. 37–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the national success of the Beatles in Britain from 1962, a number of Liverpool performers were able to follow them into the charts, including [[Gerry &amp; The Pacemakers]],{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 29}} [[The Searchers (band)|the Searchers]], and [[Cilla Black]]. The first act who were not from Liverpool or managed by [[Brian Epstein]] to break through in the UK were [[Freddie and the Dreamers]], who were based in Manchester, a short distance away,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/05/20/ufreddie.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2006/05/20/ixnews.html ''Daily Telegraph''] "'Dreamers' star Freddie Garrity dies", 20 May 2006, accessed August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as were [[Herman's Hermits]] and [[the Hollies]].&lt;ref&gt;V.

Outside of Liverpool many local scenes were less influenced by rock and roll and more by the [[rhythm and blues]] and later directly by the [[blues]]. These included bands from Birmingham who were often grouped with the beat movement, the most successful being [[the Spencer Davis Group]] and [[the Moody Blues]]. Similar blues influenced bands who broke out from local scenes to national prominence were [[the Animals]] from [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 29}} and [[Them (band)|Them]] from [[Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;I.

==Decline==
By 1967 beat music was beginning to sound out of date, particularly compared with the "harder edged" [[blues rock]] that was beginning to emerge.

Most of the groups that had not already disbanded by 1967, like the Beatles, moved into different forms of [[rock music]] and [[pop music]], including [[psychedelic rock]] and eventually [[progressive rock]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Macan, ''Rocking the Classics: English Progressive Rock and the Counterculture'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0-19-509888-9}}, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Influence==
Beat was a major influence on the American [[garage rock]]&lt;ref name=AllmusicGarage&gt;V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, ''All music guide to rock: the definitive guide to rock, pop, and soul'' (Backbeat Books, 3rd end., 2002), pp. 1320-1.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[folk rock]] movements,&lt;ref&gt;R. Unterberger, [http://www.allmusic.com/explore/essay/merseybeat-t680 "Merseybeat"], retrieved 5 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and would be a source of inspiration for subsequent rock music subgenres, including Britpop in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;D.

[[File:Samuel Henry Alken - Bull Baiting.jpg|thumb|right|Bull-baiting in the 19th century, painted by Samuel Henry Alken.]]
'''Bull-baiting''' is a [[blood sport]] involving pitting a bull against another animal, usually a dog.&lt;ref name="Irving1837"&gt;{{Citation |first=Irving |last=Washington |authorlink=Washington Irving |title=The Adventures of Captain Bonneville, U.S.A., in the Rocky Mountains and the far West |chapter=Gay life at Monterey – Mexican horsemen – A bold dragoon – Use of the lasso – Vaqueros – Noosing a bear – Fight between a bull and a bear – Departure from Monterey – Indian horse stealers – Outrages committed by the travellers – Indignation of Captain Bonneville |url=http://irving.thefreelibrary.com/Adventures-of-Captain-Bonneville-USA-in-the-Rocky-Mountains-and-/1-39#vaquero |year=1837 |accessdate=2009-08-11 |postscript = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===England===
[[File:Bull and Bear Baiting arenas shown on the Agas Map of London of 1560.JPG|thumb|Bull- and bear-baiting arenas shown on the [[Woodcut map of London|woodcut map of London]] of c.&amp;ndash;1561 (the dogs are shown coming out of pens to each side)]]
In England during the time of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], bull-baiting was practised in [[London]] at [[Hockley-in-the-Hole]], twice a week &amp;ndash; and was also reasonably common in provincial towns. At  [[Tutbury]], a bull was tied to an iron stake so that it could move within a radius of about 30 feet. The object of the sport was for the dogs to immobilise the bull.

Before the event started, the bull's nose was blown full of [[black pepper|pepper]] to enrage the animal before the baiting. The bull was often placed in a hole in the ground. A variant of bull-baiting  was "pinning the bull", where specially-trained dogs would set upon the bull one at a time, a successful attack resulting in the dog fastening his teeth strongly in the bull's [[snout]]. The extinct [[Old English Bulldog]] was bred especially for this sport.

Bull-baiting was not only practised as a form of recreation: there existed a "long-held belief" that baiting improved the flesh.{{clarify|date=February 2018|reason=Improved the flesh of the bull? The spectator? Improved how?}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Aspects of British Calendar Customs|year=1993|editor-first1=Theresa|editor-last1=Buckland|editor-first2=Juliette|editor-last2=Wood|first=Bob|last=Bushaway|pages=76-77|chapter=Bulls, Ballads, Minstrels and Manors: Some Observations on the Defence of Customs in Eighteenth-Century England|isbn=1-850-75243-5|location=Sheffield|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early nineteenth century, the sport began to die out, both because the baiting caused a public nuisance and because of new concerns about animal cruelty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title=Sports and Celebrations in English Market Towns, 1660–1750|journal=Historical Research|date=May 2002|volume=75|issue=188|page=200|doi=10.1111/1468-2281.00147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Bill for the suppression of the practice was introduced into [[British House of Commons|the House of Commons]] in 1802, but was defeated by thirteen votes. It was not finally outlawed until parliament passed the [[Cruelty_to_Animals_Act_1835|Cruelty to Animals Act of 1835]], which forbade the keeping of any house, pit, or other place for baiting or fighting any bull, bear, dog, or other animal.

===Ireland===
Bull-baiting ({{Lang-ga|tarbh-ghríosú}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teanglann.ie/en/eid/bull-baiting|title=English–Irish Dictionary (de Bhaldraithe): bull-baiting|website=www.teanglann.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was widespread in [[Ireland]] in the 17th–19th centuries.

In [[Dublin]], bull-baiting took place near the Cornmarket and in [[Smithfield, Dublin|Smithfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the42.ie/james-kelly-interview-sport-ireland-1600s-1446547-May2014/|title=So what was sport in Ireland like in the 1600s?|first=Paul|last=Fennessy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[St Stephen's Day]] 1789 a riot followed a bull-bait, soldiers fired on the crowd and four were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://comeheretome.com/2016/05/18/bull-baiting-in-eighteenth-century-dublin/|title=Bull-baiting in eighteenth century Dublin.|date=18 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Wexford]], the activity arrived in 1621, brought by the Guild of [[Butchers]]; bulls were baited twice a year and their [[Hide (skin)|hides]] presented to the Mayor. The area where bull-baiting took place is still called the Bullring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wexfordhub.com/history/bullring/|title=The Bullring, Wexford|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kilkenny]] it took place at the site called The Ring, first in 1609, and commonly on the feast-day of [[John the Baptist]] (December 27). The last recorded bull-bait was in 1837, after they had become illegal under an 1835 Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=2h6DCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=%22bull+baiting%22+kilkenny&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y6ZzDyeyeC&amp;sig=19mjr-aV-70FSUl_OwsojyukRtc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwie7Jr_3vfVAhXJL8AKHY-XDW4Q6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bull+baiting%22+kilkenny&amp;f=false|title=Sport and Ireland: A History|first=Paul|last=Rouse|date=8 October 2015|publisher=OUP Oxford|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=yz6oCQGzIZEC&amp;pg=PA561&amp;lpg=PA561&amp;dq=%22bull+baiting%22+kilkenny&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=i_zmIDtcQo&amp;sig=H2AnAmpdPczOeo4UiWosZ-8UnOo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwie7Jr_3vfVAhXJL8AKHY-XDW4Q6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bull+baiting%22&amp;f=false|title=Drama and the Performing Arts in Pre-Cromwellian Ireland: A Repertory of Sources and Documents from the Earliest Times Until C. 1642|first=Alan John|last=Fletcher|date=27 August 2017|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rothehouse.com/2008/08/05/peter-brennan-anca-pioneer-potter-in-kilkenny/|title=Peter Brennan, ANCA, Pioneer Potter in Kilkenny|first=|last=roisin|date=5 August 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bull and Bear Fight New Orleans 1853.jpg|thumb|A bull and bear fighting in [[New Orleans]], 1853.]]

In the 19th Century, and during [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Colonial Rule]], bulls used to be pitted against [[bear]]s, in [[California]] and [[Mexico]]. Kingsley (1920) said that the bulls that fought the bears, at least while California was part of the United States, were not domesticated [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] bulls, but [[Spanish Fighting Bull]]s, whose weight, agility, speed, sharp horns and hot temper were said to be dangerous to both bears and humans, and Wistar (1937) said that those bulls were fearless.&lt;ref name="Irving1837"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Storer &amp; Tevis 1955"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Tracy Irwin Storer |author2=Lloyd Pacheco Tevis |title=California Grizzly |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QVZFQu01KcC&amp;pg=PA149 |year=1996 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-20520-8 |pages=42–187 |accessdate=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown 1996"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=David E. |title=The Grizzly in the Southwest: Documentary of an Extinction |date=1996 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fTVBI9bmH4wC&amp;dq=pissini+Sierra+Madre&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a case of the bull winning, victory could come early, when the bull used its strength to gore the bear to death with its horns, or toss the bear into the air.&lt;ref name="Storer &amp; Tevis 1955"/&gt;

===Dogs in bull baiting===
[[File:Circle of James Ward (1769-1859) British. A Bull Baiting Scene.jpg|thumb|Bull-baiting with dogs, 19th century]]
Bull baiting [[dog]]s, including [[bulldog]]s and [[bull and terrier]]s, were bred to bait animals, mainly bulls and bears.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=Robert |authorlink= |author2=Ken Mollett |title=The Story of the Real Bulldog |publisher=[[TFH Publications]] |year=1997 |location=Neptune, NJ |isbn=0-7938-0491-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During bull-baiting the dog would attempt to flatten itself to the ground, creeping as close to the bull as possible, then darting out and attempting to bite the bull in the nose or head area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Traditional British Rural Sports |year=2005|publisher=Routledge (UK)|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN041535224X&amp;id=jKjYyGF8hSwC&amp;pg=RA2-PA52&amp;lpg=RA2-PA52&amp;dq=Bull-baiting&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html|isbn=0-415-35224-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bull would often be tethered by a collar and rope which was staked into the ground. As the dog darted at the bull, the bull would attempt to catch the dog with his head and horns and throw it into the air.

In 1835, the Cruelty to Animals Act was passed in Parliament that outlawed "Blood Sport" in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Fogle | first=Bruce |author2=Tracy Morgan | title =The new encyclopedia of the dog | publisher=Dorling Kindersley | year=2000 | location=New York | url= | isbn=0-7894-6130-7 | page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulldog's work was suddenly over and the bulldog rapidly started dying out. Around 1865 dog fanciers began developing dog clubs which eventually culminated into [[conformation show]]s.  Many fanciers utilized various remnants of the dog utilized for "Blood Sport" to resurrect the  "Bull" dog and ultimately developed today's modern English bulldog.

==Literature==
[[Washington Irving]], in his book, ''The Adventures of [[Benjamin Bonneville|Captain Bonneville]]'', wrote that a bear was [[bear-baiting|baited]], and likewise, a wild, fierce bull, before  they were brought by [[Cowboy|vaqueros]] to an [[arena]] in a small [[amphitheatre]] in [[Monterey, California]], to fight each other. He called the fight "a favorite, though barbarous sport." In this case, he said that the bear used its sharp claws against the nose of the bull, before catching its tongue, after being repeatedly gored by the bull. Then the bull overturned it "with a desperate effort," and then 'dispatched' it rather easily.&lt;ref name="Irving1837"/&gt;

The '''Centre de l'Imaginaire Arthurien''' (English:''The Centre for the Arthurian Imaginary'', but often referred to as the '''Centre Arthurien''', English:''The Arthurian Centre'') is a cultural centre dedicated to the [[Matter of Britain]]. It was founded in 1988 in [[Rennes]] through the influence of different specialists in [[Arthurian legend]], local politicians, artists and writers. Since 1990 its headquarters has been at the [[Château de Comper]] in [[Paimpont forest|Paimpont Forest]].

It organises an annual exhibition with the theme of the Arthurian legends and a cultural season with many events, including the Pentecôte du Roi Arthur (''[[Pentecost]] of [[King Arthur]]''), Rencontres de l'imaginaire de Brocéliande (''Encounters with the Imaginary of [[Brocéliande]]'') and the Semaine du dragon (''[[Dragon]] Week''). The Centre's investment in publicising the art, culture and history of the Arthurian legends and its support for open access to education has brought it public recognition. The members of the Centre also founded the publishing house '''Artus''' which publishes books on those themes.

[[:fr:Claudine Glot|Claudine Glot]] has been president of the Centre de l'Imaginaire Arthurien since its foundation, its membership includes numerous personalities like [[:fr:Philippe Le Guillou|Philippe Guillou]], [[Gilbert Durand]] and [[:fr:Michel Le Bris|Michel le Bris]]. The elficologist [[Pierre Dubois (author)|Pierre Dubois]], artists [[:fr:Séverine Pineaux|Séverine Pineaux]], [[:fr:Bruno Brucéro|Bruno Brucéro]] and [[:fr:Didier Graffet|Didier Graffet]] and academics [[:fr:Philippe Walter|Philippe Walter]] and [[:fr:Bernard Sergent|Bernard Sergent]] are also among the Centre's mainstays. [[:fr:Nicolas Mezzalira|Nicolas Mezzalira]] has been the Director since 2008. The Centre receives an average 30000 visiters per year, nearly a third of whom are scholars, but also among them have been celebrities such as [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Nolwenn Leroy]] and [[Patrick Poivre d'Arvor]].

==Foundation and Ojectives==
[[File:Conférence dans la Salle aux Images..jpg|thumb|Claudine Glot in conference in the image Image Room at the château de Comper.]]
The foundation of the Centre de l'Imaginaire Arthurien met the needs of the people of the [[Ploërmel]] area and the visitors to the forest of [[Brocéliande]] (which has been identified with Paimpont Forest) who were looking for a source of information on the legendary King Arthur. It owes much to the contributors of the journal ''Artus'', a publication devoted to the Celtic countries, including  specialists such as [[Gilbert Durand]].&lt;ref name="InterviewCG"&gt;Tsaag Valren and Harmonia Amanda, [[n:Interview de Claudine Glot, spécialiste de la légende arthurienne|Interview with Claudine Glot, specialist in the Arthurian legends]], Wikinews, 13 November 2011 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre de l'Imaginaire Arthurien has the objectives of reaching out to the general public on the Arthurian legends, disseminating artistic works (writing, visual arts, music, street arts, storytelling...), promoting the Matter of Britain to contemporary creatives so that they understand and perpetuate it, and enhancing the legendary cultural heritage. In an interview with [[France 3]], Claudine Glot summarised the aims of the Centre by saying that it has a vocation to attract enthusiasts of the Celtic, medieval and Arthurian worlds, and talk about all the works that they inspire, including [[Heroic fantasy|Heroic Fantasy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=http://bretagne.france3.fr/2012/09/07/itineraires-concoret-72655.html|title=Reportage Itinéraires à Brocéliande: la légende du roi Arthur |year = 2012 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; It disseminates all that is artistically or historically related to the Arthurian legends and the Forest of Brocéliande&lt;ref&gt;Andrée Corvol et Paul Arnould, ''La forêt: Perceptions et représentations'', coll.

===1988-1990===
In 1988, the Centre de l'Imaginaire Arthurien was officially established in Rennes, thanks to the willing efforts of several academics, regional politicians and writers. [[:fr:Michel Le Bris|Michel Le Bris]] was among the principal founders, with [[:fr:Claudine Glot|Claudine and Hervé Glot]].&lt;ref name="InterNicolas"/&gt; The [[International Arthurian Society]] and academic writer Gilbert Durand were supporters of the project.&lt;ref name="Histso"/&gt;

The first exhibitions were devoted to [[King Arthur]] (''Arturus Rex'', in collaboration with the [[Université catholique de Louvain|Université Catholique de Louvain]], 1988), [[Brocéliande]] and the Forest (1989), [[Megalith]]s and Stones(1990) with the participation of Pieter-Paul Koster. These were mounted at various locations in the region, including Ploërmel, Rennes and colleges. In 1990, the exhibition was installed in the Château de Comper and opened throughout the summer. At the same time new activities commenced, such as tours of the [[Paimpont forest|Paimpont Forest]]. Following the fire that raged over 500 hectares of Brocéliande from the 7 to 11 September 1990 the Centre had to begin again and rehabilitated itself.&lt;ref name="Histso"/&gt;

===1991-1996===

The Centre was invited to exhibit in Paris, and to participate in conferences between December 1992 and March 1993.&lt;ref name="Histso"/&gt;

From 1993 to 1996, the Centre collected and highlighted information about [[Merlin]], monarchs and magicians, and the Knights of the [[Round Table]]. School groups were invited, [[:fr:Michel Le Bris|Michel Le Bris]], [[:fr:Michel Cazenave|Michel Cazenave]], [[:fr:Christian Joseph Guyonvarc'h|Christian Guyonvarc'h]] or [[:fr:Philippe Le Guillou|Philippe Le Guillou]] held conferences.

==Important Locations==
The Centre de l'Imaginaire Arthurien is open to the public at the [[château de Comper]] from the beginning of March to the end of November. Since the end of 2012 Ls Petite Maison des Légendes is open to the public during the winter months when the Château is closed. Both are situated in the [[Communes of France|Commune]] of [[Concoret]] ([[Morbihan]], Brittany).

Since 2009, the Centre has taken part in event outside Brittany every year (Médiévales de Provins, [[Printemps des Légendes]]&lt;ref name="Monthermé"&gt;{{citation |title=L'apothéose du Printemps des Légendes |last=Spasic |first=Mirko |newspaper=L'Union |date=16 April 2012|url=http://www.lunion.presse.fr/article/ardennes/diapo-l%E2%80%99apotheose-du-printemps-des-legendes?xtcr=3&amp;xtmc=Printemps%20des%20l%C3%A9gendes|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;...).

===Château de Comper===
[[File:ChateauComper.jpg|thumb|left|The [[château de Comper]], at [[Concoret]], on the shores of the Faery Vivian's lake]]
{{main|Château de Comper}}

{{quotation|C’est le lieu le plus magique que l'on puisse avoir. Comper a réellement « fait » le centre arthurien. Le château est au croisement de la légende et de l’Histoire.

''It's the most magical place that we could have. Comper has really made the Arthurian Centre. The Château is at the crossroads of legend and history''.|Claudine Glot|[[n:Interview de Claudine Glot, spécialiste de la légende arthurienne|Interview accordée à Wikimedia France]]}}

The Centre de l’Imaginaire Arthurien has lodged at the Château since 1990. It is open to the public from the beginning of March until the end of October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foret-broceliande.fr/Centre-de-l-Imaginaire-Arthurien|title=Centre de l’Imaginaire Arthurien|publisher=foret-broceliande.fr|accessdate=4 January 2012|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre rents the entire west wing of the main building. The ground floor is equipped with a bookshop offering hundreds of volumes (books, graphic novels, fine art books etc.) on the legends, the Celts and the Middle Ages, as well the permanent and temporary exhibitions on the theme of the Authurian legends. The projection room, on the first room, enables visiters to watch documentaries (films, reportage, etc.).&lt;ref name="InterNicolas"/&gt;

The Château is the starting point for guided visits to the forest. Different events (storytelling, lectures, craft fairs, book signings etc.) are organised there on specific dates:&lt;ref name="InterNicolas"/&gt; the Pentecôte du Roi Arthur, the Rencontres de l'imaginaire de Brocéliande and the Semaine du Dragon, among others. The Château is itself associated with a legend of the faery Viviane which is often told to interested visiters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Le Divenah|Jigourel|2010|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petite Maison des Légendes===
[[File:La Petite Maison des Légendes à Concoret.jpg|thumb|La Petite Maison des Légendes at [[Concoret]] in 2013.]]
La Petite Maison des Légendes opened at the end of November 2012. It includes a permanent bookshop and hosts events organised by the Centre de l'Imaginaire Arthurien (exhibitions, displays, briefings) when the Château de Comper is closed in the winter months. La Petite Maison also accommodates the [[artist-in-residence]].&lt;ref name="PetiteMaisonFondation"/&gt;

Built in the red [[schist]] typical of the region, the building is owned by the Centre's Treasurer who has made it available to the Centre for fifteen years. It has been restored thanks to a grant from the Fondation du Patrimoine and public and private donations. Notably, this enabled the repair of the external woodwork.&lt;ref name="PetiteMaisonFondation"/&gt;

==Events Organised by the Arthurian Centre==
[[File:Echassiers et musiciens.jpg|thumb|Stilt walkers and musicians in the courtyard of the Château de Comper during the medieval market in August 2012.]]
Each year, the Arthurian Centre's opening season is marked by events, some of which have now been held for more than ten years. The three principal event are the Pentecôte du Roi Arthur, the Rencontres de l'imaginaire de Brocéliande and the Semaine Du dragon. The Château de Comper also hosts conjurers and illusionists during the Samedis de la Magie (''Magic Saturdays'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foret-broceliande.fr/Les-Samedis-de-la-Magie,762|title=Les samedis de la Magie|publisher=foret-broceliande.fr|accessdate=9 January 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval market in August is an occasion to welcome [[artisan|craftspeople]] and organise a [[Kermesse (festival)|Kermesse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foret-broceliande.fr/Marche-artisanal-et-Kermesse,654|title=Marché artisanal et Kermesse médiévale|publisher=foret-broceliande.fr|accessdate=9 January 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pentecôte du Roi Arthur===
The Pentecôte du Roi Arthur is a medieval spectacle with jonglerie, storytellers, camps, storytelling, camps and other displays such as [[historical reenactment]] and [[living history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morbihan.com/la-pentecote-du-roi-arthur/concoret/tabid/7418/offreid/157cc8d4-e220-4482-86f5-72a039efb3df/detail-fetes-et-manifestations.aspx|title=La pentecôte du roi Arthur|publisher=Morbihan.com|accessdate=6 January 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the name suggests, it coincides with the date of Pentecost. It is a celebration of spring and the adventures and encounters which it brings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foret-broceliande.fr/La-Pentecote-du-roi-Arthur,778|title=La Pentecôte du roi Arthur|publisher=foret-broceliande.fr|accessdate=6 January 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most importantly (according to [[Ouest-France]]) it is an evocation of King Arthur's coronation day (as described by [[Robert de Boron]] in the 13th century) and his commitment to the Church. It was also on Pentecost that the [[Holy Grail]] appeared to the Knights of the Round Table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ouest-france.fr/actu/actuLocale_-La-Pentecote-la-journee-preferee-du-Roi-Arthur-_-1828612------56165-aud_actu.Htm|title=La Pentecôte, la journée préférée du Roi Arthur|date=10 June 2011|author=olivier Cléro|publisher=Ouest-France|accessdate=6 January 2013|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rencontres de l'Imaginaire de Brocéliande===
[[File:Librairie extérieure des Rencontres de l'Imaginaire..jpg|thumb|A bookshop under canvas at the Rencontres de l'Imaginaire de Brocéliande in 2012.]]
[[File:Dédicace au Château de Comper..jpg|thumb|left|A signing by {{ill|Guillaume Sorel|fr}} at the Rencontres de l'Imaginaire 2012.]]
The idea for Rencontres de l'Imaginaire de Brocéliande dates to 2002. It was first realised in 2004 and included an exhibition and festival in [[Concoret]] and at the [[Château de Comper]]. In the years since it has been held solely at Comper. On the last weekend of July, the Centre organises the opportunity for the authors and illustraters of graphic novels, writers and illustraters, to meet their public. It primarily facilitates book-signings, with equestrian spectacles, storytellers and lectures. Since 2011, the Recontres have been held in partnership with the communes of [[Tréhorenteuc]] and [[Paimpont]]. This intimate festival is above all else friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foret-broceliande.fr/Rencontres-de-l-Imaginaire-en-foret-de-Broceliande|title=Rencontres de l’Imaginaire en forêt de Brocéliande|publisher=foret-broceliande.fr|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seventh festival which took place on 23 and 24 July 2011 was host to a score of artists and celebrities. Ouest-France, which described this festival as "essential", said that its objective is to, "montrer et donc faire découvrir tout ce qui se fait dans la littérature autour des légendes" (''show and demonstrate everything done in the literature around these legends'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Les 7&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; rencontres de l'imaginaire commencent aujourd'hui|date=23 July 2011 |last=Hancq |first=Stéphanie |newspaper=Ouest-France |url=http://www.ouest-france.fr/actu/actuLocale_-Les-7-e-rencontres-de-l-imaginaire-commencent-aujourd-hui-_35117-avd-20110723-60954320_actuLocale.Htm|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semaine du Dragon===
The Semaine du dragon was conceived and directed by the Centre and the request of the Pays Touristique de l'[[Oust (rivière)|Oust]] de Brocéliande. [[Pierre Dubois (auteur)|Pierre Dubois]] is the patron. It has been held every other year since 2009 (in odd numbered years),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture-broceliande.fr/site/?page_id=1255|title=Semaine du Dragon – du 22 au 31 octobre 2011|editor=Office socio-culturel cdc Mauron|date=2 November 2011|accessdate=20 July 2012|language=French|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225171359/http://www.culture-broceliande.fr/site/?page_id=1255|archivedate=25 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of October or beginning of November, to coincide with the Celtic festival of [[Samhain]].

==Éditions Artus==
Éditions Artus existed prior to the foundation of the Centre de l'Imaginaire Arthurien, its origin was in the journal of the same name published by the future founders of the Centre. Published from 1979 to 1986, it contained in-depth articles devoted to the Celtic and Nordic countries in the fields of art, legends or history. The editorial board of the journal offered fine art books and research on these themes as well as postcards of drawings by [[Gustave Doré]] and the Breton landscape.&lt;ref name="Artus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centre-arthurien-broceliande.com/artus.html|title=Artus|publisher=Centre de l'imaginaire arthurien|accessdate=4 January 2013|language=French|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213013859/http://www.centre-arthurien-broceliande.com/artus.html|archivedate=13 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''1984 Eccles rail crash''' occurred on 4 December 1984 at [[Eccles, Greater Manchester]], when an express passenger train collided at speed with the rear of a freight train of [[oil tank]]ers. The driver of the express and two passengers were killed, and 68 people were injured.  The cause of the accident was determined to be that the driver of the express train had [[Signal passed at danger|passed a signal at danger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/DoT_Eccles1984.pdf Accident Enquiry Report] Retrieved on 2007-05-05&lt;/ref&gt;

== The accident ==
The passenger train involved was 1E79, the 10:05 service from [[Liverpool]] to [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], formed of a [[British Rail Class 45|Class 45]] [[diesel locomotive]]  No.45147, seven passenger coaches and a parcels van.   The freight train was 6E85, the 09:00 service from [[Stanlow Refinery|Stanlow Oil Refinery]], [[Ellesmere Port]] to [[Leeds]], composed of a [[British Rail Class 47|Class 47]] locomotive No.47310 and fifteen [[Tank car|tanker wagons]] containing [[fuel oil]].

The freight train had just passed [[Eccles railway station|Eccles station]] and was starting to accelerate away when the passenger train, having passed both the Eccles [[distant signal]] at caution and [[home signal]] at danger, collided heavily with its rear. It was estimated that the freight train was travelling at about 10&amp;nbsp;mph, whilst the passenger train's speed was between 45 and 50&amp;nbsp;mph.

The force of the collision threw the rearmost tanker to the side, but the next two wagons were thrown into the air, with one falling back onto the passenger locomotive. The wagons were badly damaged and escaping fuel oil was ignited by the hot exhaust gases of the locomotive, setting fire to it and the leading two coaches.  Fortunately, the leading coach was empty of passengers or the death toll would probably have been much higher. However, the express driver and one passenger were killed instantly, whilst another passenger succumbed to injuries a month later. A number of people received impact injuries and burns and many were also treated for smoke inhalation. Rescue efforts were assisted by the location of the accident, which was adjacent to the [[M602 motorway]], enabling easy access for emergency services.

== The inquiry ==
The inquiry into the accident was inconclusive.  There had been problems with the signalling in the area, and [[track circuit]]s had been affected by a maintenance gang working on the track nearby, but the inspector was satisfied that the signals which had been passed at danger were working properly and showing the correct aspects. They were, however, not fitted with the [[Automatic Warning System|AWS]] warning system to alert the driver to his error. In the absence of any conflicting medical evidence, the inquiry was forced to conclude that the driver had simply allowed his attention to wander and had missed the Eccles signals &amp;ndash; it was testified by staff that it was rare for these signals to be at danger.

The report recommended that these signals be fitted with AWS, work which was quickly completed. The home signal was also fitted with a white back plate, in order to make it more visible against the road bridge that stands behind it.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite book | first=Stanley | last=Hall | year=1987 | title=Danger Signals: an investigation into modern railway accidents | publisher= Ian Allan | isbn= 0-7110-1704-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7505">'''Employment fraud''' is an attempt to defraud people who are seeking or performing [[employment]] by giving them a false hope of better employment, often with higher [[wage]]s. Employment fraud involves activities such as fraudulent representation of income to a borrower who claims [[self-employment]] in a non-existent company. It also includes a small number of hours paired with a lot of free time.&lt;ref&gt;In-text: (Definitions.uslegal.com, 2014) Bibliography: Definitions.uslegal.com, (2014). Employment Fraud Law &amp; Legal Definition. [online] Available at: http://definitions.uslegal.com/e/employment-fraud/ [Accessed 29 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fraud==
Recruitment [[fraud]] involves persons misrepresenting themselves as acting on behalf of an employer to offer fictitious job opportunities. The fraud is generally conducted through the [[internet]].

===Identifying fraudulent and fictitious job offers===

The company name and/or logo may be included (without authority) on the [[documentation]].
There are usually various requests for personal information, such as passport details, bank details.

Genuine employers do not request money transfers or [[payment]]s from applicants to secure a job, either as an employee or as a contractor.&lt;ref&gt;Lundin-petroleum.com, (2014). Employment Fraud - Lundin Petroleum. [online] Available at: http://www.lundin-petroleum.com/eng/recruitment_fraud.php [Accessed 29 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of fraud===

*Stealing money from the company bank account – the [[perpetrator]] having got away with this once, will try it again and again.
*Manipulating sales figures so as to reach target and achieve bonus – a simple version of this involves booking sales in one month then crediting them back the next. Naturally, unless the perpetrator keeps this up, the overstatement in one month will be shown as a shortfall in the next.
*Theft of stock – a time-honored way to make a 'fast buck'. The perpetrator will over a period of time abscond with a number of items from the [[warehouse]], and resell these. So long as the stock losses are within [[tolerance interval|tolerance]] then it is possible for this to remain undetected for a significant period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, K. (2012). Top ten types of fraud. [online] Metro. Available at: http://metro.co.uk/2012/10/09/top-ten-types-fraud-3817034/ [Accessed 29 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Any advertising or [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]] that misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities or geographic origin of goods, services or commercial activities which lures unsuspecting victims into a situation where, out of desperation or lack of knowledge, they are tricked into committing a [[crime]] or become a victim of a crime such as [[identity theft]], [[embezzlement]] or similar types of [[fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;TheFreeDictionary.com, (2014). False Advertising. [online] Available at: http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/False+Advertising [Accessed 31 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of employment scam===

====Mystery shopper====
The victim applies to be a mystery shopper. They are asked to test a money wiring service such as Western Union, and to report back on the experience. In reality, they are helping to launder money and could be open to charges of being a money mule. 

====Payment administration====
The victim is asked to handle payments on behalf of an overseas company, earning a fee for every payment handled. the companies turn out to be a front for illegal activity – again potentially landing the victim in trouble with the law. 

====Guaranteed employment/income scams====
The victim is guaranteed a certain level of income or employment. To get this they first have to buy something like a business plan, start-up materials or software. They may also be asked to pay money to be put on a directory to 'guarantee' jobs. This is in fact merely a way to get the victim to spend money – there is no job waiting at the end.



====Multi-level marketing====
People selling through a multi-level marketing scheme get [[commission (remuneration)|commission]] on the sales of those they recruit, as well as on their own sales. Some multi-level marketing schemes, like selling Tupperware, are legitimate business models. But some multi-level marketing schemes are [[pyramid scheme]]s in disguise. The products are of poor quality, overpriced and hard to sell, or the victim may be asked to spend a great deal of money on training materials that are completely useless.

====Visa/work permits====
A prospective [[employer]] overseas says that they'll handle the victim's work visa application. But the victim has to send them the money to process it. Again, this will simply result in the scammer taking the money and vanishing.&lt;ref&gt;Cps.gov.uk, (2014). Fraud Act: Legal Guidance: The Crown Prosecution Service. [online] Available at: http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/d_to_g/fraud_act/ [Accessed 28 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

====How to resolve the issue====
If employment fraud is suspected, one should seek legal advice immediately. Whilst the main aim will be to obtain evidence that will stand up in court, one should proceed with caution. There is a risk of being taken to an employment [[tribunal]] should one's suspicions prove incorrect or should one act in a way that breaches an employee's employment law rights. In addition, the way one gathers evidence or checks personal data on employees must comply with the Human Rights Act and the Data Protection Act. Employers should always carry out a full identity check on any new employee.&lt;ref&gt;Nelsonslaw.co.uk, (2014). Employee Fraud: Warning SignsSolicitors: Nottingham, Leicester and Derby UK. [online] Available at: http://www.nelsonslaw.co.uk/site/library/commercialclient/employee_fraud.html [Accessed 29 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment trends==

===Crime and fraud issues in international trade===
Theft of goods, money laundering, cyber crime, employee fraud, infringement of intellectual property.
Businesses in international trade face a growing threat from crime. Fraud is deceit for financial profit and has cost the UK economy more than £38 billion in the past year (source: National Fraud Authority – annual fraud indicators January 2011). Currently the main threat to international traders is fraud from organised crime, including theft of your goods or your business identity, cross-border crime and road-freight crime. Other risks include infringement of intellectual property or employee fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Gov.uk, (2014). Investigations and enforcement: what we do, our outcomes and complaints - GOV.UK. [online] Available at: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/insolvency-service-investigations-and-enforcement-what-we-do-our-outcomes-and-complaints [Accessed 29 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;
The rise in online trading has created new forms of criminal activity, such as new ways of laundering money. Businesses in the EU can rely on shared laws and commercial procedures to protect them. This action-based guide explains the key risks involved, how to reduce them, and what to do if their business is targeted.&lt;ref&gt;Gov.uk, (2012).

'''Exhibit design''' (or '''exhibition design'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Exhibition Design | publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] | author=Dernie, David | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-393-73211-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the process of developing an exhibit—from a concept through to a physical, three-dimensional exhibition. It is a continually evolving field, drawing on innovative, creative, and practical solutions to the challenge of developing communicative environments that ‘tell a story’ in a three-dimensional space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/course/xmdxmdma/ MA Design for Exhibition and Museum], [[University of Lincoln]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Exhibit designer]]s (or [[exhibition designer]]s) use a wide range of technologies and techniques to develop experiences that will resonate with diverse audiences–enabling these targeted audiences to access the messages, stories and objects of an exhibit.
There are many different types of exhibit, ranging from museum exhibitions, to retail and trades show spaces, to themed attractions, zoos, and visitor centers. All types of exhibits aim to communicate a message through engaging their audiences in meaningful and compelling interactions.
   
Exhibit design is a collaborative process, integrating the disciplines of [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], [[graphic design]], [[audiovisual]] engineering, [[digital media]], [[lighting designer|lighting]], [[interior design]], and content development to develop an audience experience that interprets information, involves and engages a user and influences their understanding of a subject.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Skolnick, [[Jan Lorenc]], and Craig Berger, ''What is Exhibition Design?'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the planning and design process, exhibit designers work closely with [[graphic designers]], content specialists, [[architects]], fabricators, technical specialists, audiovisual experts, and, in the case of museums and other [[mission statement|mission]]-based institutions, stakeholders like community members, government agencies, and other partner organizations.
  
The exhibit design process builds on a conceptual or [[interpretive planning|interpretive plan]] for an exhibit, determining the most effective, engaging and appropriate methods of communicating a message or telling a story. The process will often mirror the architectural process or schedule, moving from conceptual plan, through schematic design, design development, contract document, fabrication, and installation. The first phases establish a thematic direction and develop creative and appropriate design solutions to achieve the interpretive and communication goals of the exhibit. The latter phases employ technical expertise in translating the visual language of the designs into detailed documents that provide all the specifications required to fabricate and install an exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781442230170/Museums-101|title=Museums 101|last=Walhimer|first=Mark|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2015|isbn=9781442230187|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Exhibition 2013- National Museum of Iran-Darband cave-stone tools.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Showcase containing two stone tools from the Lower Paleolithic cave site of Darband, Exhibition, National Museum of Iran.]]

Exhibition design in different parts of the world are influenced by the local culture as well as the availability of materials. Exhibition design in Europe is considered as a meeting place for relationship building while in North America energy is spent on creating a sense of place and building community.

One of the major shifts in museum and exhibit design in the last decade has been a focus on visitor experience.  By identifying the five types of museum visitors and their needs and expectations, museums can design their exhibits to give a positive visitor experience.&lt;ref&gt;John Falk, ''Identity and the museum visitor experience''2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Participatory activities are also becoming more popular, Nina Simon has done research describing and identifying themes and trends in museums that will attract visitors and educate them in fun and engaging ways. &lt;ref&gt;Nina Simon, ''The Participatory Museum'' 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5436">'''Ford's Grand Opera House''' was a major [[music venue]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], located on West Fayette Street between North Howard and [[Eutaw Street]]s. It was founded by theatre manager [[John T. Ford]] (also the owner of infamous [[Ford's Theatre]] in [[History of Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C.]] where President [[Abraham Lincoln]] was assassinated, April 14, 1865) and designed by architect [[James J. Gifford]]. The opera house/theatre opened to the public on October 2, 1871 with a show that included readings from Shakespeare's ''"[[As You Like It]]"'' as well as vocal and orchestral performances. Then owned by 1950s–60s era theatre magnate [[Morris A. Mechanic Theatre|Morris A. Mechanic]], it closed almost 93 years later with its last [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show from [[New York City]], "[[Sondheim on Sondheim|Something Funny Happened on the Way to the Forum]]" in 1964. It was replaced three years later as the prime site for Baltimore live theatre patrons with the opening in the landmark of the new downtown redevelopment project of [[Charles Center]], the starkly modernistic [[Brutalist architecture|"Brutalist"]] architecture of the [[Morris A. Mechanic Theatre]] at the southwest corner of [[Charles Street (Baltimore)|Charles]] and Baltimore Streets, four blocks to the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scharf|first=John Thomas|title=History of Baltimore City and County|year=1881|publisher=Louis Everts|location=Philadelphia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tF4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA696&amp;lpg=PA696&amp;dq=ford's+grand+opera+house+baltimore&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tcOR3A_eG9&amp;sig=wgY9UnvcGsOrPT_FANPho6UI9jU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EavsT9HiFqXj0QHJ7JnTBw&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=ford's%20grand%20opera%20house%20baltimore&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ford Opera house was later the site of newspaper publisher of the ''[[New York Tribune]]'', [[Horace Greeley]]'s nomination as the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican Party]] candidate from a split Republican Party for the [[United States presidential election, 1872|1872 American Presidential election]] versus regular [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidate, incumbent 18th President, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[1872 Democratic National Convention|Democratic candidate]] Seymour, who was reelected.

== Protests (1946-1952) ==
The allure of the theatre attracted many kinds of people. Starting in 1946, Civil Rights activists in Baltimore such as [[Adah Louise Killion Jenkins|Adah Jenkins]] began to picket the Ford’s Grand Opera House. This demonstration was a direct result of the Jim Crow policies at the time, which led to segregation in seating, accommodation, and ticket availability for people of colored skin. The Ford Theatre gave specific seating to African-Americans, often in the third row of the theatre. &lt;ref&gt;Parren Mitchell, Oral History. 1976. OH 8170, Governor Theodore McKeldin-Dr. Lillie May Jackson Project. Maryland Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Civil Rights activists were able to make an impact on the segregation policies of Baltimore’s theatres to the point where it was recognized by the NAACP. &lt;ref&gt;Brown, Milton P. Letter to Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Hollander. Sidney Hollander Papers, MS 2044, March 4, 1949, MdHS&lt;/ref&gt;

After six years of protesting, Ford's Opera House desegregated in 1952.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=After 6 Year At The Picket Line: MD's Ford Theatre Ends Separate Seating Policy|last=|first=|date=February 9, 1952|work=The Balto African American|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fords theatre had been operating under segregation since its opening in 1871.  After multiple appeals to actors and other influential people in the community, officials in charge of the theatre agreed on the desegregation of the theatre, saying that it would add to the welfare of colored people and help aid in the betterment of race relations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To help end segregation in Ford's theatre, protestors enlisted the help of the NAACP, playwrights, actors, and more which proved to be very effective in bringing awareness to the community. &lt;ref&gt;Brown, Milton P.

Sidney Hollander Papers, MS 2044, March 4, 1949, MdHS&lt;/ref&gt; Even Government officials found themselves speaking out against the segregation of Ford's theatre such as Governor McKeldin, when he called the segregation, offensive, illogical, and absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=McKeldin Takes Initiative: Gov.

"'''Friday'''" is a song by American singer [[Rebecca Black]], written and produced by [[Los Angeles]] record producers [[Clarence Jey]] and [[Patrice Wilson]]. It was released by [[ARK Music Factory]] as Black's debut single on March 14, 2011.&lt;ref name="Salon1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/03/14/rebecca_black_friday_horror/|title=What's behind the "Worst music video ever"? |last=Williams|first=Mary Elizabeth |work=[[Salon.com]]|date=March 14, 2011|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song features a rap verse from Wilson, which was uncredited on the single. Its music video caught a sudden surge of hits after ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' and [[Rifftrax]] comedian [[Michael J.

"Friday" uses the [[50s progression]], an I-VI-IV-V [[chord progression]] that many popular songs have used such as "[[Heart and Soul (1938 song)|Heart and Soul]]" and "[[Unchained Melody]]". It is performed in the key of B major at a [[tempo]] of 112 beats per minute. According to Randy Lewis of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', the familiar structure contributes to the song's catchiness, making it what others have called an [[earworm]].&lt;ref name="lewis20110331"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/03/rebecca-black-friday-youtube-patrice-wilson.html | title=Rebecca Black's 'Friday': There are a million good reasons you can't get it out of your head | accessdate=March 31, 2011 | author=Lewis, Randy | date=March 31, 2011 | publisher=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song also sees Black on a [[harmony]] track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.orangecounty.com/entertainment/rebecca-17844-straight-black.html|title =Rebecca Black's mom sets the record straight on Leno lip-sync rumors|last =Larsen|first =Peter|date =March 28, 2011|publisher =OrangeCounty.com|accessdate =April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', writer Matthew Perpetua described the vocals as having "a peculiar tonality that inadvertently highlights the absurdity of boilerplate pop lyrics," adding that the tone in the refrain "sounds unlike anything else in pop music."

===Development and summary===
The concept for the music video is based on the lyrics and presented as a typical Friday for Black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/russell-smith/how-to-be-an-instant-internet-superstar-for-a-fee/article1944533/|title=How to be an instant Internet superstar – for a fee |last=Smith|first=Russell|date=March 16, 2011|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=March 17, 2011|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wakes up and goes to school, meeting her friends on the way.

===Reception===
The video was posted on February 10, 2011 and received 4,000 views, enough to please Black,{{r|larsen20110317}} before comedian [[Michael J. Nelson]]'s Twitter account and a ''[[Tosh.0]]'' blog post, "Songwriting Isn’t for Everyone", drew attention to it on March 11, 2011, turning the video into a [[viral video|viral hit]].&lt;ref name=mashgable/&gt; Criticism of the song's lyrics, the use of [[Auto-Tune]] on Black's vocals, as well as the content of the video also caused it to become viral.&lt;ref name=yahoomusicworstsong/&gt; On May 9, 2011, comments became subject to prior approval for posting. Two days later, commenting was disabled altogether and archives removed. By June 15, 2011, the video had more than 166 million views, and 3.2 million "dislikes" from YouTube users against just 454,000 "likes".&lt;ref name="WaybackMachine"/&gt; It also peaked in the top 20 most watched YouTube videos of all time.

After reading the harsh reviews of "Friday", Black said that "those hurtful comments really shocked me." Ark Music offered to take the video down from YouTube, but Black refused the offer, saying that she did not wish "to give the haters the satisfaction that they got me so bad I gave up."&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/music/858451-rebecca-black-lashes-out-at-friday-haters-and-refuses-to-quit-as-singer|title=Rebecca Black lashes out at Friday 'haters' and refuses to quit as singer|last=Lee|first=Ann|date=March 18, 2011|work=Metro|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black's father has accompanied her in public to guard against potential accosters.&lt;ref name="larsen20110329"/&gt; In response to criticism over the song's significant use of Auto-Tune, Black performed an acoustic version during an interview with [[ABC News]], which earned over 180,000 dislikes on YouTube (84% of total ratings) by November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|3CBzT2pv1Jc|Rebecca Black Sings 'Friday' Acoustic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the interview Black's mother, Kelly, stated that she was "angry and upset" after Black was brought to tears by comments, such as "I hope you go cut yourself and die" and "'I hope you cut yourself and get an eating disorder so you'll look pretty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Andrea Canning |title=Rebecca Black: 'Don't Think I'm the Worst Singer' |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/rebecca-black-dont-think-im-worst-singer-13164800 |format=Streaming |medium=Television broadcast |publisher=Good Morning America |location=New York NY |archiveurl=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/rebecca-black-dont-think-im-worst-singer-13164800 |archivedate=March 18, 2011 |accessdate=January 16, 2012 |time=2:25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1367627/Rebecca-Black-teen-YouTube-hit-branded-worlds-worst-singer-cries-criticism.html|title='I cried over all the nasty comments': How did an innocent wannabe like Rebecca Black become America's most reviled teenager?|date=March 18, 2011|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=March 18, 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Alison|title=Rebecca Black Cried Over All the Nasty Comments|journal=People|date=March 18, 2011|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20474741,00.html|accessdate=January 16, 2012|publisher=Time Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black said, however, that soon she was able to ignore such comments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b231712_rebecca_black_defends_friday_lameness.html|title=Rebecca Black Defends "Friday" Lameness, Drags Justin Bieber Into It|last=Serpe|first=Gina|date=March 18, 2011|work=eonline.com|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and asked [[Justin Bieber]], her idol, to perform a duet with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/03/18/its-friiiiday-let-the-rebecca-black-media-blitz-begin/|title=It's Friiiiday: Let the Rebecca Black Media Blitz Begin|last=Carbone|first=Nick|date=March 18, 2011|work=TIME|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bieber has not released an official announcement regarding the offer, he posted on Twitter "sunday comes after saturday? weird."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/cut-and-die-the-web-loves-to-hate-rebecca-black-20110321-1c2tz.html |title='Cut and die': the web loves to hate Rebecca Black |last=Moses |first=Asher |date=March 21, 2011 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=March 24, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xPufQ0n6?url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/cut-and-die-the-web-loves-to-hate-rebecca-black-20110321-1c2tz.html |archivedate=March 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bieber later sang part of the chorus at one of his concerts.&lt;ref name="larsen20110329"/&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone's]]'' Perpetua again praised Black after the interview and said, "She is actually a pretty decent singer.

===Controversy===
Not long after the "Friday" video went viral on YouTube, Black and her mother, Georgina Kelly, got into legal issues with Ark Music over rights to the song. In a March 29, 2011 letter from Kelly's lawyer to Ark Music, it was alleged that Ark Music failed to fulfill the terms of their November 2010 agreement by not giving her the song and video's master recordings, by claiming Black as exclusively signed to the label, and by exploiting the song without permission – for example, selling a "Friday" [[ringtone]]. While Wilson stated that Kelly "will get the masters and the song ... [t]hey can have it all", and agreed that Black was not exclusive to Ark, his attorney claimed that Ark owns the copyright for the song and the November agreement is invalid.&lt;ref name="rs20110401"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/exclusive-rebecca-black-fighting-ark-music-factory-over-friday-20110401?print=true | title=Exclusive: Rebecca Black Fighting Ark Music Factory Over 'Friday' | accessdate=April 1, 2011 | date=April 1, 2011 | publisher=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, Ark Music Factory started charging $2.99 to watch the music video on YouTube.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/13839127 | title=Rebecca Black's "Friday" removed from YouTube | accessdate=June 20, 2011 | date=June 20, 2011 | publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black's initial response was through a message through her Twitter account saying: "Thanks for all the messages regarding the $2.99 fee added to Friday video, I have ''nothing'' to do with this!!"

On June 16, 2011, YouTube took down the official video for "Friday". Instead a message in place of the video read: "This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Rebecca Black. Sorry about that."&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; A spokesman for Rebecca Black said her legal team had asked YouTube to take the video down because of an ongoing legal dispute with the song's producers Ark Music Factory. Ark Music Factory responded by saying it was disappointed that Black decided to have the video pulled from YouTube despite the two parties being in "good faith negotiations". It added: "There's been an ongoing, open dialogue with our company. So we were blindsided to get a 'Take Down Notice' alleging copyright infringement instead of a call or e-mail from Rebecca's representatives. Our use of the video has fully been authorized (as evidenced by four uninterrupted months and 160 million-plus viewings without objection) by both Ms. Black and the copyright holder. Regardless, we are going to continue to take the high road and work out the complaint as soon as possible, so that the million-plus people who watch Friday for free each day can continue to enjoy the video."&lt;ref name="ew-response"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/06/17/rebecca-black-friday-controversy-statement/ | title=Rebecca Black's 'Friday' controversy: Video production company says it was 'blindsided' by YouTube removal | accessdate=June 20, 2011 | date=June 20, 2011 | publisher=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 16, 2011, the video was restored to YouTube, on Black's official channel.&lt;ref name = Youtube /&gt;

Murphy noted that ''Glee''{{'}}s "Friday" cover offers a different take since it's sung by males for other 17-year-olds: "The show pays tribute to pop culture and, love it or hate it, that song is pop culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ryan-murphy-explains-glees-use-186469|title=Ryan Murphy Explains 'Glee's' Use of Rebecca Black's 'Friday' (Exclusive)|date=May 9, 2011|first=Shirley|last=Halperin|first2=Lesley|last2=Goldberg|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black appears as herself in the music video of [[Katy Perry]]'s single "[[Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)]]". She appears as the host of a party in the house next door to that of "Kathy Beth Terry".

'''Gaddafi loyalism after the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]]''' refers to sympathetic sentiment towards the overthrown government of [[Muammar Gaddafi]], who was [[Death of Muammar Gaddafi|killed]] in October 2011. It has been responsible for some of the [[Post-civil war violence in Libya|ongoing postwar violence]] in Libya, though the degree of its involvement has been disputed in a number of instances.

Sympathy for Gaddafi and his fallen government is viewed highly negatively by current Libyan authorities—both the legal government and extralegal militias—and parts of general society in postwar Libya, and even accusations of it can provoke harsh responses. In May 2012, the democratically elected postwar government passed legislation imposing severe penalties for anyone giving favourable publicity to Gaddafi, his family, their regime or ideas, as well as anything denigrating the new government and its institutions or otherwise judged to be damaging to public morale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/05/03/211978.html |title=Libya grants immunity to ‘revolutionaries’ |publisher=Alarabiya.net |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derisively called ''tahloob'' ("algae") by anti-Gaddafi Libyans,&lt;ref name="IPS"&gt;{{cite news |last=Frykberg |first=Mel |date=14 August 2012 |title=Gaddafi Loyalists Up In Arms |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/08/gaddafi-loyalists-up-in-arms/ |newspaper=[[Inter Press Service]] |location= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; suspected loyalists have faced strong persecution following the war. Perhaps 7,000 loyalist soldiers, as well as civilians accused of support for Gaddafi are being held in government prisons. [[Amnesty International]] has reported large scale torture and other mistreatment and executions, of those perceived as enemies of the new government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/libya-al-gaddafi-loyalists-risk-revenge-death-sentences-2013-08-02 |title=Libya: al-Gaddafi loyalists at risk of ‘revenge’ death sentences &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/24/libya-illegal-detentions-un-report |title=Libyan rebels detaining thousands illegally, Ban Ki-moon reports &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2012/11/13/plight-of-foreigners-in-libya-worse-than-under-qaddafi-claims-amnesty-international/#axzz2l2J1rH8v |title=Plight of foreigners in Libya "worse than under Qaddafi" claims Amnesty International |publisher=Libya Herald |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120127/world/-Libya-militias-army-torturing-detainees-.404071#.UoqIJ38gGK0 |title=‘Libya militias, army torturing detainees’ |publisher=timesofmalta.com |date=2012-01-27 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports and rumours of organised pro-Gaddafi activity have persisted since the war's end. The [[Libyan Popular National Movement]] was organised in exile on 15 February 2012 (the first anniversary of the protests that led to the civil war) by former officials in the Gaddafi government. The party, banned from participating in Libyan elections, may have also cultivated links with armed pro-Gaddafi groups in Libya. Statements from the party sometimes appear on websites affiliated with the so-called "Green Resistance" (after the sole colour of Gaddafi's flag), a term sometimes used by sympathisers to refer to supposed pro-Gaddafi militant groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaddafi supporters outside Libya form new grouping|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17071596|work=[[BBC]]|date=2012-02-17|accessdate=2012-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="akhram"&gt;Nkrumah, Gamal.

===End of the civil war===
Following Gaddafi's fall, several states, such as [[Venezuela]], refused to accept the [[National Transitional Council]] as the legitimate government, opting to continue recognising the former Gaddafi government. In Libya, loyalists either fled to foreign countries or went into hiding to avoid prosecutions. Shortly before his capture, Gaddafi's son [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi|Saif al-Islam]] appeared on Syrian pro-Gaddafi television on 22 October in an attempt to rally remaining loyalists claiming "I am in Libya, I am alive and free and willing to fight to the end and take revenge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/313227 |title=Libya's NTC claim Saif al-Islam Gaddafi captured alive, uninjured |publisher=Digitaljournal.com |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zawiya fighting===
Several days of fighting between fighters from Zawiya and fighters from Warshefana erupted in early November after the fighters from Warshefana set up a checkpoint on a highway near Zawiya and began challenging fighters from the city. Other reports stated that the groups were fighting over the Imaya military base, with Zawiya fighters claiming to be fighting Gaddafi loyalists. Zawiya field commander Walid bin Kora claimed that the Warshefana, riding in vehicles with "Brigade of the Martyr Muhammad Gaddafi" written on them and flying Gaddafi's green flag, had attacked his men.

The fighting resulted in between 7 and 14 dead.

===Capture of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi===
On 19 November, [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi|Saif al-Islam]] and four loyalist fighters were captured west of the town of [[Ubari]] near Sabha in southern Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.indiavision.com/news/article/international/243165/gaddafis-son-hires-mercenaries-to-flee/| title=Gaddafi's son hires mercenaries to flee|date=31 October 2011|work=[[Indiavision News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nomad who had been hired to guide them in their planned escape to Niger secretly told government forces where Saif al-Islam and his two-vehicle convoy would be passing through. Acting on this information, the Zintan brigade blocked off the area and arrested them on sight. Saif al-Islam was taken to Zintan by plane and, pending trial, he is kept in detention by the Zintan militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8902994/Libya-conflict-brewing-over-trial-of-Saif-al-Islam-Gaddafi.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Richard | last=Spencer | title=Libya: conflict brewing over trial of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi | date=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bani Walid ambush===
On 23 November, clashes erupted as a National Transitional Council militia tried to apprehend a suspected loyalist in Bani Walid, which was one of the last pro-Gaddafi strongholds in the civil war. At least seven people were reported killed, five of them NTC militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/11/23/178863.html |title=Fresh clashes in Libya’s Bani Walid; U.N. says 7,000 held in militia prisons

===Sirte===
In January 2012, residents of [[Sirte]], Gaddafi's hometown, attacked a military camp associated with the NTC on the outskirts of the city.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

===Zuwara clashes===
On 1 April, between 21 and 34 Zuwara militiamen were detained by members of a neighbouring town's militia. Fighters from Ragdalein stated that they captured the men after months of abuses by a Zuwara brigade, including the looting of property. For their part, the Zuwara local council head accused Ragdalein of being a hub of Gaddafi loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Al |first=Rami |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2017890745_apmllibya.html |title=Militias: Clashes near Libya's Tunisia border |publisher=Seattle Times |date=2 April 2012 |accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third version of the events came from the government Interior Ministry which stated that the trouble started when a Zuwara hunting party close to nearby al-Jumail shot and killed a person from that town by mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/01/libya-clashes-idUSL6E8F10ST20120401 |title=Libyan PM visits scene of tribal clashes in desert |publisher=Reuters|date= 1 April 2012|accessdate=6 August 2012 |first=Marie-Louise |last=Gumuchian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hunters were then arrested but released later. Another Zuwara council head claimed that the men were tortured before being released and stated that Zuwara came under mortar and anti-aircraft fire by militias from both Ragdalein and al-Jumail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE83109H20120402 |title=Rival militias exchange fire in western Libya |publisher=Reuters |date=2 April 2012 |accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 April, reports emerged that the fighting in the Zuwara area was still continuing with at least one Zuwara militiaman killed and five wounded. The losses for militia from Ragdalein and al-Jumail were not known. Clashes were reported at the entrance to Ragdalein while groups in al-Jumail were shelling Zuwara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/03/us-libya-zuwara-idUSBRE8320H220120403 |title=Government fails to halt western Libya militia clash |publisher=Reuters |date= 3 April 2012|accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 14 were killed and 80 injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFL6E8F382U20120403 |title=Militia clash in west Libya kills 14 people |publisher=Reuters |date=3 April 2012 |accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 April, the fighting escalated with the use of tanks and artillery. The reported number of dead was said to had risen to 26, eight from Zuwara and 18 from the outlying towns, and another 142 Zuwarans were wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/04/04/205432.html |title=Fresh clashes erupt in western Libya between former rebels, killing 26 |publisher=Al Arabiya |date=4 April 2012 |accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.apnews.com/ap/db_15716/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=6NzaSgJe |title=Clashes in rival towns kill 22 in western Libya |agency=Associated Press |date= |accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unconfirmed reports rose up the death toll to 48 killed in the clashes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unsmil.unmissions.org/Portals/unsmil/Documents/Briefing10May2012.pdf The situation in Libya] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233801/http://unsmil.unmissions.org/Portals/unsmil/Documents/Briefing10May2012.pdf |date=2013-12-02 }} UN Security Council, 6768th meeting, 10 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC News]] aired a report on the story, confirming a number dead. The report also aired an interview with a wounded man from Zarawa, claiming to have been attacked by what he called "Gaddafi loyalists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17606457 |title=BBC News - At least 14 killed in Libya clashes around Zuwara |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-04-04 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no confirmation as to whether or not the clashes had anything to do with the guerrillas.

===Ghat skirmishes===
On 6 April, French leading newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' reported that a dozen people were killed near the border town of [[Ghat, Libya|Ghat]] on 1 and 2 April in fighting between former pro-Gaddafi Tuaregs and the Zintan tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=French|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2012/04/05/01003-20120405ARTFIG00976-en-libye-aussi-les-touaregs-se-battent-pour-leur-territoire.php |title=En Libye aussi, les Touaregs se battent pour leur territoire |publisher=Lefigaro.fr |date= |accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of Ghat, in the deserts of southwest Libya, was a stronghold of Gaddafi during his reign. It was the last town in Libya to recognise the new government. Since the fall of Gaddafi, it has been suspected of continuing to be a base of loyalist sentiment. No area in Libya has had as many officials disbarred due to links to the Gaddafi government. The present government has banned its two council members, the local council leader, the secretary to the council, its financial controller, the head of security services, and the heads of the sanitation department and the border guards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/02/10/ghat-a-former-qaddafi-stronghold-struggles-to-keep-up-with-libyan-revolution/#axzz2lgC1eXQW |title=Ghat: a former Qaddafi stronghold struggles to keep up with Libyan revolution |publisher=Libya Herald |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zintan clashes===
Tribal clashes in Zintan broke out on 17 June, after a Zintan man was killed after stopping at a checkpoint while attempting to transport tanks from a weapons depot in Mizda to Zintan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18474834 | work=BBC News | title=Troops sent to quell clashes in western Libya | date=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Zintanis had played a prominent role fighting in favour of the NTC during the civil war, the neighbouring Mashashya tribe had chosen to side with the Gaddafi government during the civil war.&lt;ref name="aljazeera1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/06/20126176734750314.html|title=Troops sent to quell clashes in western Libya|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mashashya tribe chose to side with the Gaddafi government, whilst fighters from Zintan played a prominent role, fighting in favour of the NTC.&lt;ref name="aljazeera1"/&gt; This, combined with a dispute over land and bitterness over prisoners of war from Mashashya, led to the fighting. It is unclear if Green Resistance had a role in instigating the violence.

As a result of the fierce fighting between the different tribes, government troops were deployed to the area on 17 June. The area was subsequently declared a military zone. The deployment of soldiers and imposition of a government enforced ceasefire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tripolipost.com/articledetail.asp?c=1&amp;i=8587|title=Libyan Government Sends Troops to Quell Fighting in West of Country,|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; managed to prevent further clashes, with government spokesman Nasser al-Manaa declaring that fighting had ended on 18 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18529139 | work=BBC News | title=Libya's tribal clashes leave 105 dead | date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tripoli===
In August 2012, claims surfaced of loyalist remnants attempting to smuggle weapons into Libya in an effort to destabilise the government.&lt;ref name="IPS"/&gt; A member of the group in Tripoli's Abu Salim neighbourhood, a former pro-Gaddafi stronghold, claimed in an August 2012 interview that loyalist militia were rebuilding their strength and waiting for the right moment to move against the new government.&lt;ref name="IPS"/&gt; [[Al-Saadi Gaddafi|Saadi Gaddafi]] was claimed to support the group whilst under house arrest in Niger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldbulletin.net/?aType=haber&amp;ArticleID=127512 Gaddafi's son leading former regime's revival] ''World Bulletin''. 2014-01-24&lt;/ref&gt; He warned in early 2012 that he was in contact with sleeper cells who were organising underground resistance.&lt;ref name="IPS"/&gt; In addition to his son Saadi, Muammar Gaddafi's nephew Ahmad Gaddaf al-Damm, living in hiding in Egypt, was also accused of supporting violent pro-Gaddafi activity. Col. Khamid Bilhayr of the Libyan National Army claimed that other loyalist figures outside the country were sending large quantities of money and support to loyalist groups inside Libya.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

Others claim that despite the group's rhetoric, its operations were limited to bombings and minor instances of sabotage.&lt;ref name="IPS"/&gt; They were believed to have been behind a bombing outside the headquarters of the Military Police on 10 August.&lt;ref name="IPS"/&gt; On 19 August, two people were killed and up to five were injured when a car bomb went off at dawn near the former military academy for women. Another car bomb exploded at the same time near the interior ministry, but no one was harmed. The bombings occurred on the eve of the anniversary of the [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|Battle of Tripoli]]. Tripoli's head of security, Col. Mahmoud Sherif, blamed Gaddafi loyalists for the attack, and the following day Libyan authorities announced they had arrested 32 members of a pro-Gaddafi network in connection with the bombings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=20 August 2012 |title=Libya holds 32 'Gaddafi loyalists' over Tripoli attack |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19314714 |newspaper=BBC News |location= |publisher= |accessdate=14 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day as the arrests, a bomb was placed under the car of an Egyptian diplomat. The bomb exploded, but nobody was injured. The incident was also blamed by the government on Gaddafi loyalists.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sotloff |first=Steven |date=24 August 2012 |title=The Bomb Attacks in Libya: Are Gaddafi Loyalists Behind Them? |url=http://world.time.com/2012/08/24/the-bomb-attacks-in-libya-are-gaddafi-loyalists-behind-them/ |newspaper=Time |location=Tripoli |publisher= |accessdate=14 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raid on Katibat Al-Awfiyah brigade===
On 23 August, Interior ministry spokesman Abdelmonem al-Hur claimed that more than a hundred tanks and twenty-six rocket launchers were seized from an alleged pro-Gaddafi militia (named ''Katibat Al-Awfiyah'', or Brigade of the Faithful), during a government raid on their campsite in [[Tarhuna]]. The operation ended with one of the fighters killed, eight wounded and thirteen detained—including the commander—and accused of being linked with the 19 August Tripoli bombings. Three fighters managed to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=At least 12 killed in tribal clash in Libya|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/48772032/ns/world_news-africa/t/least-killed-tribal-clash-libya/#.UE81B3kZRO0|work=[[NBC]]|agency=Reuters|date=23 August 2012|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Libya seizes tanks from pro-Gaddafi militia|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19364536|publisher=BBC|date=24 August 2012|accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tanks seized from pro-Gaddafi militia|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/breaking-news/tanks-seized-from-pro-gaddafi-militia/story-e6freoo6-1226457112174|publisher=[[The Courier-Mail|Courier Mail]]|date=24 August 2012|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Omran Shaban===
Omran Shaban, the man held most responsible for the extrajudicial killing of Gaddafi, was abducted by suspected Gaddafi loyalists in Bani Walid in July. He was imprisoned and tortured for two months before being released in September due to government pressure on Bani Walid. He was sent to France for medical treatment, but died of his wounds the same month.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shuaib |first=Ali |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/08/us-libya-tensions-baniwalid-idUSBRE89715B20121008 |title=Libya's Bani Walid is shelled in standoff over rebel's death |publisher=Reuters |date= 8 October 2012|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebels responsible have so far eluded capture or death.

===Bani Walid===
{{main|Siege of Bani Walid (2012)}}

On 9 September, local militia in Bani Walid drove government forces from the town. Initial reports claimed that a supposed Gaddafi loyalist group called "[[Brigade 93]]" was responsible for the takeover,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rami Al-Shaheibi And Maggie Michael |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/24/libya-gaddafi-bani-walid_n_1226960.html |title=Libya: Gaddafi Loyalists Seize Bani Walid |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 24 January 2012|accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Bani Walid"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16690010 |title= Libya fighting: Four die in Gaddafi loyalists clash |work=BBC News |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Bani Walid town elders later denied this, and proclaimed support for the removal of Gaddafi. The elders stated that the accusations of pro-Gaddafi sympathies were orchestrated by the media, and that the town instead was fighting for the removal of the NTC military administration of the town and its replacement by a local council.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFL5E8CO1LY20120124?sp=true |title=Former Gaddafi stronghold revolts against Tripoli|work=Reuters |date=24 January 2012 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brak ambush===
On September 21, government forces were ambushed by alleged Gaddafi loyalists in the city of [[Brak, Libya|Brak]] in south west Libya. Nine soldiers were killed in the attack, with no information of casualties from the attackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/09/22/239444.html|title=Nine Libyan forces killed in clashes with Qaddafi loyalists|work=Al Arabiya|date=22 September 2012|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 January, the Libyan air force attacked targets in the south of Libya because of unrest blamed on forces loyal to slain leader Muammar Gaddafi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/libya-air-force-south-834/|title=Libyan air force attacks targets in south after gunmen storm airbase|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also declared a state of emergency after Gaddafi loyalists took over the Tamahind air force base near the southern city of [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/01/18/346409/libya-declares-state-of-emergency/|title=PressTV-Libya declares state of emergency|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227101642/http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/01/18/346409/libya-declares-state-of-emergency/|archivedate=27 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 January ''[[Voice of Russia]]'' featured a report with Libyans who claimed that much of the southern half of the country as well as Bani Walid had fallen under the control of the "Green" Gaddafi loyalists, and that some foreign Libyan embassies were flying the Gaddafi-era green flag in support. The interviewed Libyans claimed to be fighting against a Western-backed "puppet government" with ties to [[Al-Qaeda]], and charged that [[Qatar]] was paying [[Sudan]]ese pilots to bomb their positions.&lt;ref name="2014-01-22"&gt;[http://voiceofrussia.com/2014_01_22/Green-Libyan-flags-are-waving-once-again-Interview-7710/ Green Libyan flags are waving once again - Interview]. ''The Voice of Russia''. 2014-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the more government-friendly ''[[Libya Herald]]'' newspaper reported that a large contingent of Gaddafi-friendly fighters were scattered near Ajilat as they tried to aid other Gaddafi-loyalists in Sabha, with five of them killed. The report claimed that if the events were part of a coordinated movement, "it does not appear to be well organised, let alone have any significant or measurable support."&lt;ref&gt;Wahab, Ashraf Abdul.

On 22 January, the Libyan [[General National Congress]] passed Decree 5/2014, ''Concerning the Cessation and Ban on the Broadcasting of Certain Satellite Channels'', aimed at censoring pro-Gaddafi satellite television stations such as al-Khadra (The Green Channel) and al-Nedaa (the Libyan Popular National Movement's channel). [[Reporters Without Borders]] subsequently issued a statement calling for the withdrawal of the decree.&lt;ref&gt;Reporters Without Borders.

On August 4 "dozens" of Gaddafi loyalists staged a rare public demonstration in Benghazi (the only pro-Gaddafi gathering in the city as of yet), chanting pro-Gaddafi slogans and waving the flag of the [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Jamahiriya]], in response to [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi|Saif al-Islam Gaddafi's]] death sentence. The protest was later dispersed after anti-Gaddafi militia opened fire and threw rocks, although no one was reported injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-idUSKCN0Q91WT20150804|title=Gaddafi loyalists stage rare protest in eastern Libya|date=4 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2017|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuous fighting was also alleged to have erupted between pockets of pro-Gaddafi militants and [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] forces in Gaddafi's former hometown of [[Sirte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/IS-Fight-With-Gaddafi-Group-Delays-Release-of-2-Remaining-Indians/2015/08/05/article2958110.ece|title=IS Fight With Gaddafi Group Delays Release of 2 Remaining Indians|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, protests were reported across the Libyan south, in particular the city of [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]], where at least four protestors were reported dead after opponents opened fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/death-sentence-verdicts-spark-pro-qaddafi-protests-803699087|title=Death sentences spark pro-Gaddafi protests|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests were also reported in Tobruk, triggering a large counter-demonstration from those in favour of the 2011 revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libyaobserver.ly/news/gaddafi-loyalists-march-tobruk|title=Gaddafi loyalists march in Tobruk - The Libya Observer|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another protest happened on August 7 in Bani Walid, a city that was a stronghold of pro-Gaddafi loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=40&amp;v=jo4k_p6wflg|title=بني وليد اليوم Libya ~ Bani Walid 07 August, 2015|first=|last=Tarache Cabarte|date=7 August 2015|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gaiety Theatre''' is a [[listed building|category B listed]] performing arts venue in [[Ayr]], [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hsewsf.sedsh.gov.uk/hslive/hsstart?P_HBNUM=21522 Historic Scotland - Gaiety Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt; It is noted for its interior [[rococo]] features, its atmosphere and its acoustics.

The Ayr Gaiety was built in 1902, reconstructed after a fire in 1904, its façade remodeled in 1935, and further reinstated after a fire in 1955. In 1995, an annex was constructed, including a new café, box office, dressing rooms and studio space.
After a faltering start, which saw several years as a cinema after World War I, the theatre was bought by Ben Popplewell, from Bradford who already had a track record of success running the Pavilion theatre on Ayr seafront.  For fifty years the Popplewell family ran the theatre – latterly as part of the Glasgow Pavilion business.  During this time the Gaiety developed a reputation as a variety theatre with a ‘summer’ variety show – the Gaiety Whirl – which ran for 26 weeks at its height. Many Scottish and UK stars appeared regularly on its stage, and several started their careers there.  The programme offered more than a summer show however, with several weeks of Shakespeare and regular transfers from Glasgow Citizens theatre, being part of a varied offer. 
After seventy years in private ownership the local Council acquired the Gaiety theatre freehold in 1974.  It then operated as a municipal theatre under direct local authority management.  The programming had much in common with the Popplewell years, with the Gaiety Whirl still a feature and the, by now, popular panto at the core of the programme.  But the scope of performances developed and, while the family oriented theme continued, a wider range of presentations developed, including controversial shows such as Borderline Theatres production of Dario Fo’s Mistero Buffo and a touring version of Oh Calcutta!  After many years of successful operation the theatre began to lose audiences and the Council felt the revenue subsidy it provided and the requirement for capital investment required a new approach.  In January 2009 the theatre closed, leaving Ayr without a theatre – as the Civic Theatre, which had mainly presented drama, had been closed and demolished a little earlier due to asbestos contamination problems.

==South Ayrshire Council forced closure==

The closure met with considerable opposition and dismay among many Ayr residents, particularly since it appeared that the required capital and revenue investment to reopen the theatre would not be available.  A public meeting attracted over 400 attendees, the future of the theatre was a key issue in the local press, many Scottish performers expressed their dismay and there was extensive discussion on social media.

In early 2009 South Ayrshire Council invited tenders to take on the theatre management. Ayr Gaiety Partnership (AGP), a charity formed by local residents for the purpose in Summer 2009, secured preferred bidder status.  Just over three years later, having secured financial backing from the Council and Scottish Government, as well as from local fundraising, AGP took on a 99-year lease of the theatre with a vision to do much more than simply re-open the building. Ayr Gaiety Partnerships vision is 'to re-energise the performing arts in South Ayrshire, with the Gaiety Theatre as the hub of a network of venues that will stimulate the cultural life and economic prosperity of the area ensuring that Ayr will once again be a key destination for all those interested in the performing arts.'

==Re-opening in 2012==

From the start the organisation set ambitious social, economic and cultural goals. But the first priority was to re-open with a successful panto. On 11 December 2012, after many last minute challenges, the Gaiety re-opened for what turned out to be a sell-out run of over 40 performances of the panto Cinderella.

==Ayr Gaiety Partnership==

The Ayr Gaiety Partnership is a charitable body formed by local community figures, with membership open to local residents. The directors at present are: Ian Welsh, David Quayle, Chris Fremantle, Graham Peterkin, and Professor Gayle McPherson.

Membership is open to local residents and others with an interest in the theatre. Ayr Gaiety Partnership's first General Meeting is set to take place on 13 October 2014.

==Staff &amp; Volunteering at The Gaiety==
The new Ayr Gaiety is unlike most theatres in the UK because it is largely run through voluntary effort.   Most of the people undertaking front of house, technical, fundraising, marketing and maintenance are doing so on a voluntary basis. Although the volunteering effort overall is led by the Executive Director and Board- each volunteer team is supported and led by one of the staff team members.

The Gaiety's current full-time staff team consists of just nine employees led by Executive Director Jeremy Wyatt.

==Scotland's 1st Learning Theatre==
The School of Media, Culture &amp; Society at the [[University of the West of Scotland]] (UWS) and the Gaiety Theatre officially launched Scotland’s first Learning Theatre on Friday 19 September 2014. The launch event, which saw representatives from UWS, the Gaiety, as well as the [[National Theatre of Scotland]] in attendance, marks the first stage in the development of the partnership Learning Theatre, which will provide a centre for education, training and research in the area of performance and theatre craft.

UWS enjoys close links with the Gaiety and the University’s new BA Technical Theatre degree, delivered in conjunction with the Theatre, had its first intake in September. The course, the only one of its kind in the country, offers thorough vocational training for those looking to work in stage management and theatre production. Students will gain professional knowledge of the industry and will be prepared for a variety of employment opportunities from small-scale theatres to large multi-media events, venues and festivals. The course is aimed at those with a range of theatre, performance, production and related HND qualifications to enable them to build to a degree award in Technical Theatre. Students from the University's undergraduate Performance programme also make regular use of the theatre's facilities.

'''Haitian Heritage Month''' is a celebration in the United States of [[Haiti]]an heritage and culture. It was first celebrated in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], in 1998. Tele Kreyol, one of the Boston Haitian Access Television programs, celebrated the whole month of May with a series of programs on Haitian history, culture, and contributions to the world. The month-long celebration has continued with such activities as parades, flag raisings, and exhibits organized by [[Haitian Americans|Haitian-Americans]] United, Inc. (H.A.U.) in collaboration with several Haitian organizations in the [[New England]] area.

The Haitian community of [[Palm Beach County, Florida]], which started the Heritage celebration in 2001, contributed greatly to make the Heritage Month first a statewide celebration, and then, a national one in the United States. South Florida congressman [[Kendrick B. Meek]] introduced unsuccessfully a bill in the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2004 and 2006 to recognize the month of May as Haitian-American Heritage Month in the United States. President [[George W. Bush]] and his wife [[Laura Bush]] sent a letter in May 2005 to congratulate the Haitian-American community for the heritage month and organized a celebration at the [[White House]] the same year.

Since 1998, several governors, members of state senates and houses of representatives, mayors and city councilors have issued annual citations and proclamations, recognizing the Haitian Heritage Month celebration in their states or cities.

In 2008, the Haitian Heritage Month/Flag Day was celebrated with parades, festivals, schools activities, and flag raising ceremonies in the following cities and counties in the U.S.:

The Haitian Heritage Month celebration is an expansion of the Haitian Flag Day, a major patriotic day celebration in Haiti and the Diaspora. Haitian President [[Dumarsais Estimé]] started the Flag Day celebration with parades, cultural and athletic events in many cities in Haiti in the 1930s, when he was minister of education under President [[Sténio Vincent]]. Estime wanted to commemorate annually the creation of the [[Flag of Haiti|Haitian flag]] on May 18 to encourage the development of patriotic sentiments among Haitian youth.

Beside the Flag Day celebration, the month of May carries a number of significant historical and cultural traditions that Haitians are proud to make aware of and to pass on to future generations. In Haiti, May 1 is celebrated as Labor and Agriculture Day. May 2 used to be Flower Day. The Congress of Arcahaie that united black and mulatto officers to fight together for Haiti's independence is remembered from May 15 through 18. The revolutionary general, [[Toussaint Louverture]], was born on May 20, 1743. Teacher's Day is May 17, University Day May 18, and Mother's Day is celebrated on the last Sunday of May. For Haitian [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]], May is the month of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], the mother of [[Jesus]].

[[File:Samsung_Harddrive_headcrash_DSCN0124b.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A head crash]]
A '''head crash''' is a [[hard-disk failure]] that occurs when a [[disk read-and-write head|read–write head]] of a [[hard disk]] drive comes in contact with its rotating [[hard disk platter|platter]], resulting in permanent and usually irreparable damage to the magnetic media on the platter surface.  It is most commonly caused by a sudden severe motion of the disk, for example the jolt caused by dropping a laptop to the ground while it is operating or physically shocking a computer.

==Head details==
A head normally rides on a thin film of moving air entrapped at the surface of its platter (some drives of the mid-1990s used a thin liquid layer instead).{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} The distance between the head and platter is called the [[flying height]]. The topmost layer of the platter is made of a [[Teflon]]-like material that acts like a lubricant.  Underneath is a layer of [[Sputtering|sputtered]] carbon. These two layers protect the magnetic layer (data storage area) from most accidental touches of the read-write head.&lt;ref&gt;Wiederrecht,  Gary Phillip (2010). ''Handbook of nanoscale optics and electronics,'' p. 257. Academic Press. {{ISBN|978-0-12-375178-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[disk read-and-write head]] is made using thin film techniques that include materials hard enough to scratch through the protective layers. A head crash can be initiated by a force that puts enough pressure on the platters from the heads to scratch through to the magnetic storage layer. A tiny particle of dirt or other detritus, excessive shock or vibration (such as accidentally dropping a running drive), can cause a head to bounce against its disk, destroying the thin magnetic coating on the area the heads come in contact with, and often damaging the heads in the process. After this initial crash, countless numbers of fine particles from the damaged area can land onto other areas and can cause more head crashes when the heads move over those particles, quickly causing significant damage and [[data loss]], and rendering the drive useless. Some modern hard disks incorporate [[free fall sensor]]s to offer protection against head crashes caused by accidentally dropping the drive.

==Differences at RPMs==

Since most modern drives spin at rates between 5,400 and 15,000 [[revolutions per minute|RPM]], the damage caused to the magnetic coating can be extensive. At 7,200 RPM, the edge of the platter is traveling at over {{convert|120|km/h}}, and as the crashed head drags over the platter surface, the read-write head generally overheats, making the drive or at least parts of it unusable until the heads cool.

[[File:RAMAC 305 disk.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[IBM 350|IBM RAMAC disk]] showing head crash damage.]]

==Older heads==

Older drives typically rotated far more slowly and had larger heads flying higher above the surface of the medium. However, since in many cases, the medium was housed in a removable cartridge or pack and since air filtration was comparatively crude, crashes were fairly frequent and invariably expensive.

==Laptops==

Head crashes were a common problem on laptop computers, since they are subject to sudden motion. This has led to the development of technologies that detect sudden motion and take evasive action (for example by parking the heads), sometimes known as [[active hard-drive protection]] or "sudden motion sensing." In very old laptop designs, the head of a hard disk drive could become stuck if the laptop lost power, leaving the disk head in an unparked state and potentially leading to scoring of the drive if the laptop was moved. This is now an uncommon problem, as modern hard disk drives which are designed with portability in mind 'self-park' in the event of a power failure. Where such an event occurs in laptops built since 2000, it is more likely that the hard disk controller within the drive was already failing.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

'''Kendall Francois''' (July 26, 1971 – September 11, 2014) was an American [[serial killer]] from [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]], convicted of killing eight women, from 1996 to 1998.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=McQpAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT12&amp;dq=gina+barone+reported+missing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW7-7U3bvSAhVHSiYKHWkEBfkQ6AEIJDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=gina%20barone%20reported%20missing&amp;f=false|title=NIGHTCRAWLER|last=Gado|first=Mark|date=December 15, 2011|publisher=RosettaBooks|isbn=9780795323157|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his conviction and sentencing, Francois was housed in the [[Attica Correctional Facility]] until being transferred to the [[Wende Correctional Facility]] shortly before his death.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j6tnCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=spider%20and%20the%20fly%20claudia%20rowe&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=spider%20and%20the%20fly%20claudia%20rowe&amp;f=false|title=The Spider and the Fly: A Reporter, a Serial Killer, and the Meaning of Murder|last=Rowe|first=Claudia|date=January 24, 2017|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780062416148|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revealed in his trial in 2000 that he tested positive for HIV in 1995, but this was not said to have been related to his death.&lt;ref name="DEATHPJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/crime/2014/09/12/serial-killer-francois-dead/15522259/|title=Serial killer Kendall Francois dies in prison|last1=Ferro|first1=John|website=Poughkeepsie Journal|publisher=Gannett Company, Inc.|accessdate=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial and sentence ==

In August 2000, Francois was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. He was incarcerated in Attica Correctional Facility until shortly before his death.&lt;ref name=DEATHPJ/&gt;

He died in the Wende Correctional Facility on September 11, 2014, at the age of 43.&lt;ref name=DEATHPJ/&gt; The official cause of death was "apparent natural causes." According to a woman who corresponded with Francois in prison, he had cancer. &lt;ref name="pj"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/crime/2014/10/11/francois-letters-part-one/16803127/|title=Francois letters: Inside the mind of a remorseless killer|work=The Poughkeepsie Journal|access-date=March 4, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4569">The '''MaX5 Racing Championship''' is a [[UK]] based one-make [[sports car]] series using older specification mark 1 1600cc Mazda [[MX-5]]s. It was started in the summer of 2003 by '''Alyn Robson''' and '''Jonathan Halliwell''', with the first race season being held in 2004. It was based upon the original MX5 Championship that ran between 1990-91 and the [[Spec Miata|American Spec Miata MX-5 Championship]]. The championship works on the ethos that close racing is exciting racing, and is aimed at drivers who want to race for fun. This is summed up in the championship's slogan, "Race it to the max." The championship has gained success through its cheap racing entry fees and the popular nature of the [[Mazda MX5]].

Although the main race calendar contains some major [[United Kingdom|British]] circuits, including [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] and [[Brands Hatch]], the championship has also taken in minor circuits such as [[Lydden Race Circuit|Lydden Hill]] and [[Mallory Park]], circuits not often visited by major British car championships.

To race in the series, prospective drivers are required to join the MAX5 racing club for an annual membership fee. The minimum racing licence for entering the championship is a National B ARDS (Advanced Racing Driver Schools) licence.

Drivers can compete in the MaX5 races for a whole season, but an Arrive and Drive package is offered in an attempt to attract new drivers into the championship, costing £750 + [[VAT]] per race.

==2005==
There was a close race for the championship saw [[Martin Byford]] winning the Championship from Christian Dick by 2 points at the last meeting of the season. The competition regularly attracted grids of over 20 cars.

==2006==
The 2006 season opener is at [[Mallory Park]] on April 23. The series has been regularly part of one of National motorsport's major packages, Dunlop's Great and British festivals, which featured Radicals, Ginettas and the Mini Cooper challenge, alongside the MaX5 Racing Championship. The first occasion that the Mazdas featured in the package was on the weekend of 27-28 May 2006 on the Welsh circuit of [[Pembrey]], south [[Wales]].

Here are the final 2006 championship standings:

1. Jonathan Greensmith: 654 points
2. Paul Sheard: 651 points
3. Scott Kirlew: 631 points

==2007==
2007 saw the closest title race in the short history of the MaX5 Racing Championship, with two drivers (Jonathan Greensmith and Paul Sheard) finishing the season level on 827 points in 1st place. A novice driver, Tom Roche, finished in an impressive 3rd place overall.

==2008==
2008 saw 50% of the drivers leave to form the Ma5da racing championship.

After 5 rounds Richard Breland lead the championship with 285 points.

==2009==
By this year, virtually all drivers had moved to the new Ma5da racing championship, leaving MaX5 with an average grid of only six cars.

==Notable drivers==
'''Chris Stockton-''' As well as occasional appearances in the MaX5 Championship, Stockton has also raced in the [[British Touring Car Championship]] since 2006 with the same team as in BTC Racing, in a Lexus IS200. He finished 10th in his first [[British Touring Car Championship|BTCC]] race meeting. In 2004 Chris raced in the [[Le Mans 24 Hours]] endurance race in a [[TVR T400|TVR T400 GT]] and competed earlier in the year in the European and [[American Le Mans Series]] with the same car.

'''Martin Byford-''' Another former MaX5 Championship driver to later turn up in the [[British Touring Car Championship|BTCC]], Martin now races for [[AmD Essex|AmD Milltek Racing]] teams in their [[Volkswagen|VW]] [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf GTi]], having succeeded Team Principal [[Shaun Hollamby]] as driver, who had stepped back into the role following [[Tom Onslow-Cole|Tom Onslow-Cole's]] surprise move to [[Arena Motorsport|Team AON]] midway through a round.

The '''Make It Right Foundation''' is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit foundation]] founded by [[Brad Pitt]] in 2007. The foundation was established to aid in the [[environmentally friendly]] rebuilding of [[New Orleans]]' [[Lower Ninth Ward|Lower 9th Ward]] after [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The organization is currently working in New Orleans, LA, Newark, NJ, and Kansas City, MO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History - Make It Right|url=http://makeitright.org/about/history/|publisher=MakeItRight|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization Overview ==
{{advert|section|date=January 2014}}
[[Image:Brad Pitt Make it Right 2008.jpg|right|thumb|Photographic portrait of Brad Pitt from [[Blake Nelson Boyd]]'s "Louisiana Cereal".]]

In December 2006, [[Brad Pitt]] and [[William McDonough]] together with [http://graftlab.com Graft Architects]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pogrebin|first=Robin|title=Brad Pitt Commissions Designs for New Orleans|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/03/arts/design/03pitt.html|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=5 June 2018|date=December 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded Make It Right to rebuild 150 safe, energy-efficient and affordable homes for families from [[New Orleans]] Lower 9th Ward who lost everything to [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomson|first=Katherine|title=Brad Pitt "High" From New Orleans Project|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/12/01/brad-pitt-high-from-new-o_n_147477.html|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=6 January 2014|date=January 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bernstein|first=Fred|title=Brad Pitt's Gifts to New Orleans|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/travel/29cultured.html?_r=0|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=6 January 2014|date=November 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2013, Make It Right has completed 90 homes and is working to finish the remaining 60 homes. The homes in New Orleans were designed by world-renowned architects like [[Frank Gehry]], [[David Adjaye]] and [[Shigeru Ban]] and each home is LEED Platinum certified by the [[USGBC]]. These houses are not typical of New Orleans with their angular shapes and colors of every shade. Make it Right also implements the [[Cradle to Cradle]] method which means using material that can be reused and that are safe, renewable energy is utilized, safe drinking water, and improvement is continuous.

The Make it Right website uses the idea of Laboratory and Library to show how the materials, the construction, and the data available are certifiably green and will ultimately benefit the homeowner.

Some of the topics include: 
*Advanced Framing
*Electrical Systems
*Pervious Concrete
*Paint
*Solar Panels
*Plumbing
*Quality Control

These homes use 70% less energy than a conventional home of the same size. It takes about $150,000 to build these homes with labor included. If the costs exceed the estimated price then the foundation covers the fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Evelyn|title=Brad Pitt Breaks Ground in Louisiana with 'Make It Right'  Read more: Brad Pitt Breaks Ground in Louisiana with 'Make It Right' {{!}} Inhabitat - Sustainable Design Innovation, Eco Architecture, Green Building|url=http://inhabitat.com/make-it-right-begins-constructing-houses/|publisher=Inhabitat|accessdate=6 January 2014|date=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each home gives the builder an idea of how to make the homes more affordable and better constructed.

Make It Right partnered with HelpUSA in [[Newark, NJ]] to build a 56-unit multi-family building for disabled veterans. The LEED Platinum building opened on Memorial Day 2012.

In [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], Make It Right is converting an historic school into 50 affordable rental units for veterans, seniors and people with special needs. The building will also include a community center featuring an auditorium, gymnasium, locker rooms, technology lab, job training center, medical clinic, grocery store and other retail space, along with community gardens, a playground, walking trail and police foot patrol office.

== Mission ==
{{cleanup||section|date=November 2010}}
{{advert|section|date=January 2014}}
To build safe, [[Cradle-to-cradle design|Cradle to Cradle]] inspired homes, buildings, and communities for people in need. The members of the Make it Right team strive to build homes that are energy efficient and most importantly, healthy and safe for families to live in. The foundation uses methods that are sustainable and affordable.

Make it Right donors are giving people a safe place to live, promote sustainable living and solar energy, and help those in need of reconstruction after natural disaster. Some options of donation are green gifts which include: solar panels, paint, native plants, [[Energy Star]] appliances, and more.

Average energy bills have decreased for the homeowners because of the green technology installed in the Make it Right homes. The homes were initially only available to those whose homes were leveled from [[Hurricane Katrina]] but now the green homes are now accessible to teachers and first responders. Lower Nine residents are still eligible and but now the program is extending the offer of housing to others.

The foundation also employs lawyers, social workers, and loan workers to help the former residents of the Lower Ninth Ward whom many of which lost all documentation during [[Hurricane Katrina]] to get through the mortgage application process. The income of the applicants does not affect the applicant's ability to obtain a home. The unsubsidized mortgage is designed to be no more than one third of the applicant's income.

==Night To Make It Right==
On March 10, 2012 at the Hyatt Regency New Orleans, [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Ellen DeGeneres]] hosted "A Night to Make It Right" with [[Drew Brees]] and [[Randy Jackson]] and performances by [[Rihanna]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Seal (musician)|Seal]], [[Kanye West]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Dr. John]] and other local favorites. Make It Right raised $5 million&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nola.com/arts/index.ssf/2012/03/brad_pitts_make_it_right_gala.html Make It Right Gala raises $5 million, Doug MacCash, Times Picayune, 3-13-12. Retrieved 1-19-16]&lt;/ref&gt; at this event, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. Just over 1,200 attendees paid between $1,000 - $2,500 to dine on a four course meal created by celebrity chefs, [[Emeril Lagasse]] and [[John Besh]]. A silent auction also helped contribute to the funds of the Make It Right foundation.

== Decay problems ==
The foundation came under fire in early January 2014 after over two dozen of the green homes built started exhibiting severe signs of rotting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Ashley|title=Brad Pitt Charity's Post-Hurricane Katrina Homes Rotting (Report)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/brad-pitt-charitys-post-hurricane-668410|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=6 January 2014|date=January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Merriman|first=Rebecca|title=Brad Pitt's Charity Under Fire After Hurricane Katrina Houses Begin|url=http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/136885/Brad-Pitts-Charity-Under-Fire-After-Hurricane-Katrina-Houses-Begin-To-Rot|publisher=Entertainment Wise|accessdate=6 January 2014|date=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brad Pitt charity under fire after Katrina victims' homes begin to rot|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/01/01/brad-pitt-charity-under-fire-after-katrina-victims-homes-begin-to-rot/|publisher=[[Fox News]]|author=Fox News|date=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation reported that the homes used special wood products called TimberSIL which is advertised as free from many of the toxic ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Richard|title=Wood product said to be rotting in 'green'-built homes|url=http://theadvocate.com/news/neworleans/neworleansnews/7899967-123/innovative-wood-product-used-in|publisher=The Advocate|accessdate=6 January 2014|date=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dicker|first=Ron|title=Rotting Wood Reported In Katrina Homes Built By Brad Pitt's 'Make It Right' Foundation|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/02/make-it-right-wood-rotting-brad-pitt-katrina_n_4531804.html|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wood was unable to withstand the extensive moisture that engulfs the city of [[New Orleans]]. The foundation announced they are prepared to pursue all legal remedies if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brad Pitt's housing foundation considers legal action|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Brad-Pitts-housing-foundation-considers-legal-action/tabid/418/articleID/327139/Default.aspx|publisher=3News|accessdate=6 January 2014|date=January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, it was reported that residents of the New Orleans Make It Right homes were complaining that many of the Make It Right homes were rotting and dangerous. They complained of mold and collapsing structures, electrical fires and gas leaks.&lt;ref name=nbc&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/brad-pitt-built-dozens-homes-new-orleans-after-katrina-now-n908651|title=Brad Pitt built dozens of homes in New Orleans after Katrina. Now they're falling apart and residents are suing.|date=12 September 2018|work=NBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residents said the houses were built too quickly, with low-quality materials, and that the designs didn’t take into account New Orleans’ humid, rainy climate.&lt;ref name=nbc/&gt; Also, it was reported that Make It Right had not built a home, filed tax forms or updated its website since 2015. The downtown New Orleans office had been closed, the staff had been cut to a handful and residents said their calls went unreturned.&lt;ref name=nbc/&gt;

==Critical reception==
Christian Williams of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' describes them: "Some videos borrow ''[[Wonder Showzen]]''{{'}}s toolkit, wielding subliminal blips and eye-straining text in service of subversive ends. Some make use of the ''[[Tim And Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' aesthetic, and some are surprisingly slick, with excellent, eardrum-shredding music courtesy of talented mystery-men like Orangy and Vaervaf."&lt;ref name=AVClub2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Christian|title=Take in the work of the comedy provocateurs in Million Dollar Extreme|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/take-in-the-work-of-the-comedy-provocateurs-in-mil-96712|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of [[Philly Mag]]'s Andrew Thompson: "The mission of Million Dollar Extreme has always seemed a spin on afflicting the comfortable, except its targets usually aren’t the comfortably powerful. To the extent that satire exists in MDEs comedy, it feels like more of rationalization than a reason for the shock itself."&lt;ref name=PhillyMag /&gt; Robert Mariani wrote at ''[[The Federalist (website)|The Federalist]]'' that the group's comedy style is an example of [[post-irony]]: "Figuring out the intentions of the ironist is easy: whatever is being shown is being mocked. But the post-ironist folds over on his own sincerity with exaggeration, using the ironic not just to ridicule, but also to enjoy the absurdities of what he genuinely appreciates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefederalist.com/2016/12/12/million-dollar-extremes-adult-swim-show-becomes-collateral-damage-trumps-victory/|title=Million Dollar Extreme’s Show Is Collateral Damage Of Trump’s Victory|first=|last=Television|date=December 12, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nomifensine''' ('''Merital''', '''Alival''') is a [[norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor]], i.e. a drug that increases the amount of synaptic norepinephrine and dopamine available to receptors by blocking the dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake transporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a mechanism of action shared by some recreational drugs like [[cocaine]] and the medication [[tametraline]] (see [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor|DRI]]). Research showed that the (''S'')-isomer is responsible for activity.&lt;ref&gt;'Chirality and Biological Activity of Drugs' page 138&lt;/ref&gt;

The drug was developed in the 1960s by [[Hoechst AG]] (now [[Sanofi-Aventis]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent | country = US | status = patent | number = 3577424 | title = 4-Phenyl-8-Amino Tetrahydroisoquinolines | assign1 = Farbwerke Hoechst | gdate = 1971-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who then [[test market]]ed it in the [[United States]]. It was an effective antidepressant, without sedative effects. Nomifensine did not interact significantly with alcohol and lacked anticholinergic effects. No withdrawal symptoms were seen after 6 months treatment. The drug was however considered not suitable for agitated patients as it presumably made agitation worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Some case reports in the 1980s suggested that there was potential for psychological dependence on nomifensine, typically in patients with a history of stimulant addiction, or when the drug was used in very high doses (400–600&amp;nbsp;mg per day).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Clinical uses==
Nomifensine was investigated for use as an antidepressant in the 1970s, and was found to be a useful antidepressant at doses of 50–225&amp;nbsp;mg per day, both motivating and anxiolytic.

==Side effects and withdrawal from market==
During treatment with nomifensine there were relatively few adverse effects, mainly [[Kidney failure|renal failure]], paranoid symptoms, [[Somnolence|drowsiness]] or [[insomnia]], [[headache]], and [[Xerostomia|dry mouth]]. Side effects affecting the cardiovascular system included [[tachycardia]] and [[palpitations]], but nomifensine was significantly less cardiotoxic than the standard tricyclic antidepressants.&lt;ref name="pmid911653"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hanks GW |title=A profile of nomifensine |journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=4Suppl 2 |issue= |pages=243S–248S |year=1977 |pmid=911653 |pmc=1429121 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1977.tb05760.x |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to a risk of [[haemolytic anaemia]], the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) withdrew approval for nomifensine on March 20, 1992. Nomifensine was subsequently withdrawn from the Canadian and UK markets as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB04821 | title = Nomifensine DB04821 | publisher = Drugbank.ca }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some deaths were linked to immunohaemolytic anemia caused by this compound, although the mechanism remained unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Odyssey of the Mind''', officially abbreviated '''OotM''', is a creative problem-solving program involving students from kindergarten through [[college]]. Team members work together at length to solve a predefined long-term problem and present their solution to the problem at a competition. They must also participate in the spontaneous portion of the competition by generating solutions to a problem they have not seen before. While the long-term problem solution often takes many months to complete and involves various elements of theatrical performance, construction and design, the spontaneous portion occurs the day of the competition.

Odyssey of the Mind is a trademark of Creative Competitions, Inc. (CCI).  Competitions are administered by a mixture of regional non-profit associations and the for-profit CCI corporation.

== History ==
[[Image:Snyps and Omer.jpg|thumb|OMER the [[raccoon]] ''(right)'' is the mascot of Odyssey. He is shown here with SNYPS, the [[New York (state)|New York]] state mascot.]]
The Odyssey of the Mind program was co-founded by C. Samuel Micklus and Theodore Gourley in 1978 at Glassboro State College (now [[Rowan University]]) in Glassboro, [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wnec.edu/communicator/news/1999/0304mind.html Western New England College press release, March 4, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; That first competition, known as "Olympics of the Mind", involved teams from 28 New Jersey schools. The program is now international, with teams from [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Belarus]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Czech Republic]], [[DODDS]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Hungary]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Japan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Lithuania]], [[Mexico]], [[Moldova]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Singapore]], [[Slovakia]], [[South Korea]], [[Switzerland]], [[Togo]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Uzbekistan]], regularly competing in addition to teams from the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://odysseyofthemind.com/learn_more.php Learn More link on the Odyssey of the Mind website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
Odyssey of the Mind teams are divided into four divisions:
*Division I — Grades 3–5 (U.S.): Less than 12 years of age on May 1 of the competition year (Other International).
*Division II — Grades 6–8 (U.S.): Less than 15 years of age on May 1 of the competition year (Other International).
*Division III — Grades 9–12 (U.S.): Oldest team member does not qualify for Divisions I or II and is attending regular school—not a college or university or anything similar (Other International).
*Division IV — Collegiate for all teams. All team members must have a high school diploma or its equivalent and be enrolled in at least one course at a two- or four-year college or university.

The oldest team member determines the team's division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odysseyofthemind.com/downloads/programguide.pdf |title=Odyssey of the Mind Program Guide, p. 17 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a non-competitive primary division for young children (grades K–2 U.S.), who are given a simplified problem and fewer constraints than the higher divisions. They present and are given feedback at the first level tournament and cannot advance, except for special occasions where officials invite a team to perform again at the State level.

Teams are limited to a maximum of seven team members.

In the United States, each participating state has its own Odyssey association. Most states are further broken down into regions. Teams compete at the regional level first. The highest-scoring teams progress to the state level. In the U.S. there is no national level. State-winning teams go directly to the World Finals, which have always been held in the U.S., usually at the end of May.

== Creative problems ==

===Long-term problems===
There are five categories of problems that participants can solve:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learn More!|url=http://www.odysseyofthemind.com/learn_more.php|publisher=Creative Competitions, Inc.|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Vehicle: involves building vehicles of different sizes that must perform specified tasks.
*Technical: involves building “innovative contraptions”.
*Classics: incorporates knowledge of architecture, art, and literature this can be a documentary or a behind the scenes.
*Structure: requires the designing and building of a structure using only balsa wood and glue, and competing to see which structure can hold the most weight
*Performance: requires the team to act, sing, and/or dance based on a given theme

However, the different aspects of each of the five categories are not exclusive within that category; acting is prevalent in solutions to all five problems, and throwing in knowledge of history into a non-Classics problem or technology in a non-Tech problem will usually earn a team bonus points. 

Specifications differ between problems, but there are some general rules that are crucial for everyone involved in Odyssey of the Mind to know. First, there is the Outside Assistance rule, which heavily stresses that every aspect of a solution must result from the work of the team; parents and coaches absolutely must restrict themselves to supervising the children to ensure that they are safe and focused. Something as simple as a mother adjusting her child’s hat prior to competition is considered outside assistance, and the team will have points deducted from their final score. Thus all brainstorming, building, painting, sewing, and fixing are to be done by the team.

For each long-term problem, the team must present its solution in eight minutes or less, including set-up time, and the total cost of all materials used must either be under $125 or $145, depending on the problem (see Cost Limit). Each of these rules require participants to push their thinking capacities as they decide how best to utilize their skills, time, and money.

A new problem for each category is presented every year, and the synopses and rules can be found on the official Odyssey of the Mind website.

Most years, one problem is sponsored by [[NASA]].

==== Cost limit ====
There is a "cost" limit on the value of all materials used in the presentation of the long-term solution. This limit is typically US$125&amp;ndash;145, where the classical, performance, and primary problems have a limit of $125, while the vehicle, technical, and structural problems have a limit of $145. As of the 2006–2007 rules update,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odysseyofthemind.com/downloads/programguide.pdf|title=Odyssey of the Mind Program Guide, p 46 (p 48 of PDF)|date=|format=PDF|accessdate=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; some materials have a set "assigned value". Some examples include computers and most audio-visual equipment ([[Video projector|projectors]], [[radio]]s, [[television]]s, music players, etc.). The suggested cost to write these items down as is anywhere between $5–$10. Still other materials are simply "exempt" from cost. This includes [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] and [[power cord]]s, footwear, tables and chairs. All of these materials, even the exempt, must be listed on the "cost form". The judges check this list to make sure that the team is within the cost limit and following the appropriate assigned values and exemptions.

==== Style ====
''Style'' is a component of long-term where teams are scored on specific elements of their presentation. There are five elements scored in style. Often, two of these elements are specified in the problem, the other two are then "free choice of team" elements, and the fifth is a score of how well the other elements contribute to the performance overall. The pre-specified elements are related to the problem in some way; they are typically something to do with the appearance of a vehicle, costume, or prop. The free choice items may be anything the team wishes as long as they are not already scored as part of the long-term solution or pre-specified elements. Each element is scored from 1–10, accounting for 50 points of the overall score.

===Spontaneous===
As the name suggests, teams do not know ahead of time the topic they are to compete in. At the tournament, individual teams enter the competition room and are presented with one of three problem types: Verbal, Hands-on, or Verbal/Hands-On.

In Verbal problems, teams are usually given a minute to think and then two to three minutes to respond to a theme such as "make a rhyme using a name or species of an animal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Practice Problems|url=http://www.odysseyofthemind.com/practice/default_cat.php?Id=2|publisher=Creative Competitions, Inc.|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teams will then be graded based on the creativity of their individual responses. For instance, "there is a dog on a log" is a common answer which would earn the team one point, while "I can step on an ant, but an uncle I can't" involves word play, a creative response that is worth 3 or 5 points. Verbal problems encourage individuals to incorporate their knowledge of history, science, literature, and popular culture.

Hands-on problems focus on teamwork and the ability to listen to complicated directions. Teams will usually be instructed to build something based on the limited materials given, such as a freestanding tower using a few sheets of paper, some paper clips, a pair of scissors, and a piece of tape. The team with the tallest tower and the best teamwork earns the most points. It should be noted that in OM, if the rules do not say that something cannot be done, then it can; in other words, participants are encouraged to search for creative, outside-the-box solutions.

A Hybrid, or Verbal/Hands-On, problem has aspects of both types, typically either a verbal problem that involves manipulation of physical objects or a two-part problem: build something in part 1, and provide verbal responses with it in part 2.

Teams are allowed up to seven team members in total, but only five may compete in Spontaneous at the tournament. The others may watch the competition, but may not help. Before the competition the team should decide who is on the Verbal, Hands-on, and Verbal/Hands-on subteams, so they can quickly assemble soon after entering the competition room and learning the problem type.

== World Finals ==
All teams who advance from their state finals, or their national finals if they are from outside of the US, are invited to World Finals. World Finals is the culmination of the entire year of Odyssey of the Mind.

A variety of non-competitive activities are provided at World Finals; the representative one is pin trading, in which participants trade pins from their regions and states with participants from other states and countries. There is a creativity festival where each state/country runs a booth containing a fun activity related to their state. The highlights of World Finals are the opening and closing ceremonies. These ceremonies are held [[Olympics]] style in a stadium on campus. Teams march in and sit with other competitors from their state. After the closing ceremonies, several parties are held for different age groups, and a party is held for the coaches. These parties are a reward for all the hard work that teams have put in.

== Scoring ==
Each team is given a score out of 350 points: 200 from Long-term, 100 from Spontaneous, and 50 from Style. Style is scored from 1-10 in each of the five categories, and the Long-term and Spontaneous problems are scored according to each problem's individual rules. The scores awarded are then scaled within each problem and division based upon the highest score achieved by any team in each of the three scoring categories. So, for instance, the team scoring highest in Long-term in a particular problem and division receives 200 points, and the scores for the other teams in that problem and division are scaled proportionately. A team ranking first in its problem and division in all three elements of the competition would thus receive a "perfect" score of 350 points, regardless of the actual raw scores assigned by the judges.

The Ranatra Fusca Creativity Award is granted to teams who have demonstrated exceptional creativity, the essence of the Odyssey of the Mind program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Odyssey of the Mind Program Guide|url= http://www.odysseyofthemind.com/downloads/programguide.pdf|publisher= Odyssey of the Mind|accessdate=2014-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winning The Ranatra Fusca Creativity Award at the regional or state level will qualify a team to advance to the next level of competition, even if the team had not placed high enough to advance on their own.

== Other information ==
*When founded, the program was known as "Olympics of the Mind". In the early 1980s, the [[International Olympic Committee]] enforced violations of its trademarked "Olympic" name, and forced the program to change its name. The new name selected was "Odyssey of the Mind" to fit the "OM" acronym in use at the time.
*After debate over the for profit nature of Creative Competitions, the controlling corporation for Odyssey of the Mind Inc., a non-profit organization [[Destination ImagiNation]] was created by members of the Odyssey of the Mind Inc. board of directors. These are the two largest programs of their type with both offering over 30 years of experience in the preparation of divergent, open-ended activities for students of all ages and cultures.
*Much like at the Olympic games, members of Odyssey of the Mind who advance to the World Finals often purchase a series of pins from their state. These pins are traded throughout the competition uniting teams from all over the world as they barter for one another's state and country pins. During the World Finals of 1998, which took place in Disney World, Disney picked up on this concept and now pin trading throughout Disney World and Disneyland is quite popular.

'''''Onward Victoria''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] (1980) with a book and lyrics by [[Charlotte Anker]] and [[Irene Rosenberg]], and music by [[Keith Herrmann]]. 

Its subject is [[Victoria Woodhull]], the 19th-century woman who with her sister were the first women to operate a brokerage firm, at which they became [[millionaire]]s; and started a newspaper.  Woodhull was a proponent for free love and activist for equality of the sexes. Its cast of characters includes [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], restaurateur [[Delmonico's Restaurant|Charlie Delmonico]], and [[Henry Ward Beecher]], with whom Woodhull is linked in a [[fiction]]al romance that leads to the minister being tried for alienation of affections.

This musical originated in 1979 as ''Unescorted Women,'' first produced [[off-off-Broadway]] by the Joseph Jefferson Theatre Company.  With its budget sets and costumes, [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] [[popular music|pop]] score, and [[camp (style)|camp]] [[burlesque]]-style production numbers (including one in which Woodhull sang the praises of Beecher's physical endowment) intact, headed uptown the following year rechristened ''Onward Victoria''. 

After twenty-three previews - and with its closing notice already in place - the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, directed by Julianne Boyd and [[choreographed]] by Michael Shawn, opened on December 14, 1980 at the [[Al Hirschfeld Theatre|Martin Beck Theatre]], where it ran for one performance. The cast included [[Jill Eikenberry]] as Woodhull, [[Michael Zaslow]] as Beecher, [[Ted Thurston]] as Vanderbilt, Laura Waterbury as Stanton, Dorothy Holland as Anthony, [[Gordon Stanley]] as Fleming, and Lenny Wolpe as Delmonico.

[[Theoni V. Aldredge]] was nominated for the [[Drama Desk Award]] for Outstanding Costume Design. A [[cast album|Broadway cast recording]] was released by [[Original Cast (record label)|Original Cast]] Records.

This article concerns the building in [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland generally referred to as the ''Queen Street Childrens Hospital'', the ''Belfast Hospital for Sick Children'', and later the ''Queen Street RUC Station''. It was home to a childrens hospital from 1878 to 1932, and was a [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] barracks from 1933 to 2000. It has been effectively abandoned since then and is visibly deteriorating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archiseek.com/2015/1878-belfast-hospital-for-sick-children-queen-st-belfast/|title=1878 – Belfast Hospital for Sick Children, Queen St., Belfast – Architecture of Belfast – Archiseek – Irish Architecture|date=2015-08-20|work=Archiseek – Irish Architecture|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was granted [[Listed building|listed]] status in 1979.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://appsc.doeni.gov.uk/buildings/buildview.aspx?id=4167&amp;js=false|title=Home {{!}} Buildings{{!}} nidirect|website=appsc.doeni.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== Foundation ===
The initial meeting was held at 25 King Street, Belfast, on 15 May 1873. The event was presided over by [[James Henderson (Irish politician)|James Henderson,]] who would eventually become Lord Mayor of the city. It was attended by 15 other gentlemen representing major industries at the time.

A Board of Management was set up to establish funding and run the resulting medical practice. The main focus was to provide healthcare to the impoverished in a time where government assistance was unknown. The building and general running costs had to come from the public. In deference to this, the original writing which spanned all three storeys on the front of the finished hospital would read; ''Erected A.D.1878 By Voluntary – Subscriptions And Donations – Belfast Hospital For Sick Children''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:Queen Street Childrens Hospital.jpg|thumb|The hospital building in 2010]]Some of the more prominent founding Board members were;
* [[William O'Neill, 1st Baron O'Neill|Baron William O'Neill]] – President. There was a marble tablet installed above the main door to the surgical ward dedicated to his efforts. The presidency passed to his son [[Robert Torrens O'Neill|Robert]] after his death in 1883.
* William Robertson – Chairman
* Herbert Darbishire – Honorary Secretary
* Robert S Craig – Honorary Treasurer
* [[Sir Thomas Dixon, 2nd Baronet|Sir Thomas Dixon]] – Patron
* Lady Edith Dixon – Patron

Darbishire once said of that first meeting;&lt;blockquote&gt;''"...a few gentlemen of intelligence and earnestness met in a small dusty room in King Street. The speeches were short, but there was the right ring in what was said; it meant work; it meant success."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;Little is known about the fundraising process other than it began with a citywide distribution of flyers. By 1876 they had managed to raise £2000 and the Board decided that this was sufficient for work to begin.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calwell|first=H G|date=1969|title=The Foundation and Early Development of the Belfast Hospital for Sick Children|journal=Ulster Medical Journal|volume= 38 part 2|issue=2|pages=101–118|pmc=2385016|pmid=4899282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Building ===
The site was purchased from the [[Belfast City Council|Belfast Corporation]] in 1876 as an empty plot of land beside the recently built Gas Office. Prior to this, the plot had been used by the Mechanics Guild.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calwell|first=H G|date=1971|title=The History of the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children – The Queen Street Days|journal=Ulster Medical Journal|volume= 40 part 2|issue=2|pages=85–110|pmc=2385275|pmid=4948493}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dia.ie/works/view/46237/building/CO.+ANTRIM,+BELFAST,+QUEEN+STREET,+NO.+023-29+(CORPORATION+GAS+OFFICE)|title=CO. ANTRIM, BELFAST, QUEEN STREET, NO. 023-29 (CORPORATION GAS OFFICE) Dictionary of Irish Architects -|website=www.dia.ie|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building contractor was [[William McCammond]] who would also later go on to become the Lord Mayor of Belfast.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Thomas Jackson (architect)|Thomas Jackson &amp; Son of Corn Market]] were commissioned to design the hospital. Thomas and his two sons are credited with designing many of the iconic buildings in and around Belfast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archiseek.com/tag/thomas-jackson-sons/|title=Thomas Jackson &amp; Sons Archives – Archiseek – Irish Architecture|website=Archiseek – Irish Architecture|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dia.ie/architects/view/2763/Jackson-thomas#tab_works|title=Jackson, thomas – Dictionary of Irish Architects|website=www.dia.ie|access-date=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony had left the company by this date so the design was probably a collaborative effort between William and his father. Notable examples of their work would include;
[[File:Former police station, Belfast (geograph 2361829).jpg|thumb|The heraldic arms of Belfast on the upper gable]]
* The Limerick, Belfast, and Lisburn [[Quakers|Quaker]] Meeting Houses
* The Belfast [[Ulster Bank]] Branches
* [[Belfast Natural History Society|The Belfast Natural History Museum]]
* May Street Music Hall, Belfast
* [[St Malachy's Church, Belfast|St. Malachy's Church]], Belfast
* The Royal Hotel, Belfast
* Glenmachan Tower, Belfast
* Fountain Street Hall, Belfast

Their submitted plan was for a [[Baroque architecture|baroque style]] 44 bed hospital, although it ended up opening with only 18. Many of the beds featured illuminated cards dedicated to donators and notable persons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The initial budget was set at £3,840 although it ended up costing in excess of £5,000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was completed in 1877 ahead of schedule despite several setbacks. However, when the final lettering was being carved close to the heraldic arms of Belfast, it was decided to change this date to 1878 instead.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Decline ===
From 1885 onwards several new roles were created, including; dental specialist, assistant physician, assistant surgeon, external sister, and pathologist. This caused such a strain on funding that the hospital was compelled to stop offering free out-patient medicine as of 1897, opting for a discounted prescription model instead. There was an immediate and catistrophic drop off of out-patient activity and President O'neill repeatedly requested that the decision be reversed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The hospital continued operating despite funding deficits, lack of expansion space, wartime inflation, and the deaths of both Robert O'Neill and Joseph Nelson in 1910. It was finally vacated in 1932 after 53 years of operation following the opening of a new hospital on the Falls Road.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== RUC station years ===
[[File:Badge of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.svg|thumb|200x200px|The RUC Crest]]
The [[Minister of Home Affairs (Northern Ireland)|Northern Ireland Ministry of Home Affairs]] acquired the old hospital property in 1933 when it became available. They converted it into a barracks for RUC use even though there was already an existing police station in North Queen Street dating back to 1859. The renovations were probably fairly destructive as this was done 46 years before the building became listed.

It is listed as being one of two stations in [[Police division|Division A]] under the command of Sergeant Brown, according to the first annual RUC List and Constabulary Directory printed in 1937. Like many other barracks, the building would have been generally left open to the public with its officers patrolling unarmed. This would have been the case right up until the early seventies when [[the Troubles]] flared up. It was only after repeated attacks that the officers began to arm themselves and restrict access to the building. Fortifications included a [[Sangar (fortification)|sanger]] and a tall wire fence. [http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/crime/remembering-two-brutal-murders-in-central-belfast-1-6824194 Two constables] were shot and murdered on patrol close to the station by the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] as the Troubles escalated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/crime/daughter-of-shot-ruc-man-hears-of-kindness-at-scene-1-6833555|title=Daughter of shot RUC man hears of kindness at scene|website=www.newsletter.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The site operated as a Police station from 1933 to 2000, being decommissioned on 16 January. All operations were transferred over to the Musgrave police station on Victoria Street before the building was vacated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Notable Medical Staff ==
* Joseph Nelson – Eye and Ear Specialist. He was reputed to have a larger than life, eccentric personality. He marched with [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] in Italy, ran a tea plantation in India, and was a president of the [[Ulster Medical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Richard|date=1934|title=A History of the Ulster Medical Society|url=http://www.ums.ac.uk/soc/hunter_2.pdf|journal=Ulster Medical Journal|volume= 5|page=190|via=The Ulster Medical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Brice Smyth – Founding Physician. Ex-president of the British Gynaecological Society. He was honoured with a wall plaque outside the medical ward.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* John Fagan – Founding Surgeon. Instrumental to the invention of the first practical air-filled tyre by [[John Boyd Dunlop|John Dunlop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=exics12jmtwC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=%22john+fagan%22+belfast+doctor#v=onepage&amp;q=%22john%20fagan%22%20belfast%20doctor&amp;f=false|title=Ingenious Ireland|last=Mulvihill|first=Mary|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2002|isbn=9780684020945|location=|page=164|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stopped practicing in 1897 after inadvertently cutting the wrong limb off a patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Froggatt|first=Peter|date=|title=The British Medical School 1835 - 1985|url=http://www.ums.ac.uk/bmsch/bmsch_med.pdf|journal=Unknown|volume=|pages=|via=Ulster Medical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; His dedication plaque was placed outside the surgical ward close to O'Neills.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Jessie Lennox – Founding Matron. An ex-student of [[Florence Nightingale|Florence Nightingale's]] school of nursing, she kept in contact with Florence regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://florence-nightingale-collections.co.uk/view/objects/asitem/259/404/title-asc;jsessionid=64051C74C6C1B7BA8932FFBC07837516?t:state:flow=e4534693-6d26-41b1-acac-3ed5b8f2c6aa|title=Florence Nightingale Museum|website=florence-nightingale-collections.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also assisted with the planning and research for the hospitals design, and was reported to be generally less than accommodating to the involvement of the [http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/charity-web/charity/finalCharityHomepage.action?uniqueVmgCharityUrl=RBHSCLadiesLeague Ladies League.] Miss Lennox resigned in 1891 due to failing health. The Board found her to be almost irreplaceable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Will you kindly accept a little sum to help in things which must be always cropping up, that you want to do among your little ones? Please tell me when you write how is going on the boy that bought the pig for his family with the money given him for his own wooden leg. God bless you again and again."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;~ excerpt from a letter by Florence Nightingale to Matron Lennox – December 1885&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tYrZAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA385&amp;lpg=PA385&amp;dq=nightingale+lennox#v=onepage&amp;q=Lennox&amp;f=false|title=Florence Nightingale: Extending Nursing: Collected Works of Florence Nightingale|last=McDonald|first=Lynn|date=2011-04-07|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ.

== Medical legacy ==
The [[Belfast Health and Social Care Trust]] continue to operate the practice now known as the '''[http://www.belfasttrust.hscni.net/hospitals/ChildrensHospital.htm Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children']''&lt;nowiki/&gt; and is currently the only hospital in Northern Ireland dedicated specifically to the care of children.

The Ladies League also still maintain as a registered charitable institution, now called the '''[http://www.charitychoice.co.uk/royal-belfast-hospital-for-sick-children-ladies-league-16589 Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children Ladies League']''&lt;nowiki/&gt; Founded alongside the inaugural hospital Board meeting of 1873, today they provide valuable auxiluary support, funding, and training assistance.

== Notable Police Staff ==
* Former RUC Chief Constable and first [[Police Service of Northern Ireland|PSNI]] Chief Constable [[Ronnie Flanagan|Sir Ronnie Flanagan]] served his first three years with the police force here.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/604432.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} NORTHERN IRELAND {{!}} Sir Ronnie's trip down memory lane|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well known for being criticized over investigations into the [[Omagh bombing]] of 1998. He was stationed in Queen Street when assigned to guard the bodies of three men. Among them was [[Robert Curtis (British Army soldier)|Gunner Robert Curtis]], the first British soldier to be killed during the Troubles. Young Flanagan stood vigil alone over the victims in the old Belfast morgue. He once commented;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"There was this notion that the IRA might try to spirit the corpses away and I was there to guard them. I had no firearms or anything."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12176312.across_the___barricades_As_chief_of_the_RUC__Sir_Ronnie_Flanagan_is_at_the_frontline_of_the_sectarian_battle_in_Northern_Ireland__But_behind_the_shields_and_plastic_bullets_is_a_man_who_wants_to_fight_ignorance_with_the_ideals_of_socialism_and_unity/|title=Across the Barricades|last=|first=|date=2001|website=The Herald – Scotland|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''ReelWorld Film Festival''' is a five-day [[film festival]] held annually in downtown Toronto. The festival screens "features, shorts, documentaries, animation, music videos from the Aboriginal, Asian, Black, Latino, Middle Eastern, South Asian and other multi-racial communities."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reelworld.ca/_bin/about.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027040328/http://www.reelworld.ca/_bin/about.cfm |date=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Reelworld was founded by [[Tonya Lee Williams]] who noted the lack of opportunities for people of colour to break into the film industry. The festival's mandate states that they showcase diverse work from Canada and abroad while bringing together assorted communities. Since 2001, ReelWorld has started a number of initiatives directed towards diverse artists. Reelworld celebrates its 18th year—hosting industry panels and presenting films at Famous Players Canada Square in Toronto.

==American Reaction==
{{main|Formosa Expedition}}
Following the wreck of the United States ship and killing of the surviving crew by aborigines, the American Consul to [[Amoy]] [[Charles Le Gendre|Charles William Le Gendre]] quickly traveled to [[Foochow]], arriving on 2 April 1867, to persuade the governor generals of [[Fujian|Fukien]] and [[Chekiang]] to intervene and put pressure on the Chinese authorities in [[Taiwan]] to resolve the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Yen 1965, pp. 126-127; Carrington, George Williams, Foreigners in Formosa 1841–1874 (San Francisco: Chinese Materials Center, 1978), p. 153; Dictionary of American Biography, p. 146; The Far East (1877): 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The governor general of Fukien gave Le Gendre permission to go to Taiwan himself, and wrote him a letter of introduction to take to the prefect of Taiwan, asking him to cooperate with Le Gendre, but adding that "if the consul takes measures to manage the case himself, please invite him not to do so, for these savages might give him more trouble that he thinks."&lt;ref&gt;U.S., National Archives, Record Group 59, "Consular despatches, Amoy," vol. 3 (microfilm no. 100, roll 3), enclosure, "Intendant of Circuit of Foochow to the Prefect of Formosa," translation from the USNA and USDC; as quoted in Yen 1965, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Le Gendre commissioned the United States steamer {{USS|Ashuelot|1865|2}}, under the command of Captain [[John Carson Febiger|John C. Febiger]], in order to visit the scene of the wreck and to try (unsuccessfully) to get foreign officials in Taiwanfoo (capital of [[Taiwan Prefecture]], where he arrived on 18 April) to act. After a subsequent failed [[punitive expedition]] carried out by Rear Admiral [[Henry H. Bell]] of the [[United States Navy]], Le Gendre again returned to Formosa—this time without any reference to his superiors. While in Taiwan, he asserted United States consular authority, selected a deputy consul in north Taiwan, visited the [[Keelung]] mines, and gathered information from United States merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Carrington 1978, pp. 154, 159; Dictionary of American biography, p. 146; The Far East (1877): 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0B1EF93E5F137B93C6AB1783D85F438684F9|title=THE PIRATES OF FORMOSA. - Official Reports of the Engagement of the United States Naval Forces with the Savages of the Isle. - Front Page - NYTimes.com|publisher=select.nytimes.com|accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landing of one hundred and eighty-one officers, sailors, and marines provided with four days' rations and water was made on June 19,{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=[https://archive.org/stream/islandofformosap00davi#page/116/mode/1up 116]}} under Commander [[George Belknap|George E. Belknap]] of the {{USS|Hartford|1858|6}}, accompanied by Lieutenant Commander [[Alexander Slidell MacKenzie]], fleet lieutenant as second in command. In the terrible heat, it was "almost impossible to conduct operations in the middle of the day, and many of the party were attacked by sunstroke. The savages, who had taken up a position in the jungle behind rocks and other places invisible...kept up a heavy fire whenever their foes appeared."{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=116}} MacKenzie received a mortal wound to his chest from enemy fire.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Marine Corps and the State Department: Enduring Partners in United States Foreign Policy, 1798-2007|author=Daugherty, L.J.|date=2009|publisher=McFarland, Incorporated Publishers|isbn=9780786453016|url=https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=Ir-hm6IGWnEC|page=28|accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American force was "compelled to withdraw in some confusion to the ships, and soon departed from the island".{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=116}}

The Marines were under the command of Captain [[James Forney]], who submitted the following report to Commander Belknap, dated on board the flagship ''Hartford'', at sea, June 17:
:"I have the honor herewith to submit a brief report of the part taken by the Marines on the 13th inst., on the island of Formosa. On the first landing, by your order, I took charge of twenty Marines, deploying them forward as skirmishers. A dense and almost impenetrable thicket of bush prevented the men from advancing very rapidly. I penetrated with them to a creek about half a mile from the beach without meeting any of the enemy, and was then recalled for further orders. You then instructed me to leave a sergeant and five men on the beach, and to advance with the main body, headed by yourself. In consequence of all further operations coming under your own observation, I have nothing further to report, except that the men behaved gallantly, and deserve credit for the manner in which they marched over such a rough and hilly country, and under such intense, scorching heat...The entire number of Marines on shore was forty-three, thirty-one of whom were from this ship, and twelve from the {{USS|Wyoming|1859|6}}."&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the United States Marine Corps|author=Collum, R.S.|date=2008|publisher=Read Books|isbn=9781409715443|url=https://books.google.com.tw/books?id=y5lW5TfwEB4C|page=184|accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Rover'' Incident played a critical role U.S. military history in terms of shaping the U.S. Marine Corps' "[[rules of engagement]]" in "small wars".&lt;ref name="blogspot2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://targetedoutrage.blogspot.com/2005/01/rover-incident-in-taiwan-and-making-of.html|title=Targeted Outrage: The &amp;#8220;Rover&amp;#8221; Incident in Taiwan and the Making of US Marine Corps Small Wars Doctrine|publisher=targetedoutrage.blogspot.com|accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Visit===
Upon return to south China, Le Gendre managed to persuade the governor general in [[Foochow]] to send a military force to southern Taiwan. The force, significantly smaller than the 400 to 500 soldiers recommended by Le Gendre, was dispatched on 25 July 1867. Le Gendre then personally requested a gunboat from Admiral Bell, which he was denied, and eventually managed to commission the steamship ''Volunteer''. He embarked for Formosa on 4 September 1867,&lt;ref&gt;14. Yen 1965, pp. 127-148; Carrington 1978, p. 160; The Far East 1877, pp. 88-89.&lt;/ref&gt; telling his superiors that "I am going there as a mere spectator.. . . I have no jurisdiction over the Chinese forces."&lt;ref&gt;U.S., National Archives, Record Group 59, "Consular despatches, Amoy," vol. 3 (microfilm no. 100, roll 3), Le Gendre to Bell, 30 July 1867; as quoted in Carrington 1978, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Gendre quickly assumed ''de facto'' command of the mission from General Liu in the course of a long and difficult march into deep aboriginal lands in southern Taiwan (some of which required extensive road construction). Then, with the aid of [[William A. Pickering]] and James Horn, Le Gendre negotiated an effective treaty ([[:zh:南岬之盟|南岬之盟]]) guaranteeing the safety of shipwrecked American and European sailors with Tauketok (Tooke-tok/Tokitok), the chief of 18 [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] aboriginal tribes in the area when the ''Rover'' had gone ashore.&lt;ref&gt;Yen 1965, pp. 149-53; Carrington 1978, pp. 133, 157-58, 161-72, 174, 176; Otness, Harold M, One thousand westerners in Taiwan, to 1945: A biographical and bibliographical dictionary ([Taipei]: Institute of Taiwan History, Preparatory Office, Academia Sinica, 1999), p. 97; The Far East (1877): 89-90; Dictionary of American biography, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States|author=United States.

==Influence==
Following the ''Rover'' Incident in 1867, another shipwreck triggered the [[Mudan Incident of 1871|Mudan Incident]] which subsequently was the justification for the [[Empire of Japan]] to [[Taiwan Expedition of 1874|invade and occupy a part of Taiwan]] in 1874, a decade later the French General [[Jacques Duchesne]] defeated the Chinese up the Keelung River. In addition, the [[Qing]] court established the [[Hengchun]] lighthouse (1888; now [[Eluanbi Lighthouse]]) for the protection of the [[Taiwan Strait]] and vessels transiting the [[Bashi Channel]].

Some versions of the hoax ask people to make a monetary donation directly, while others simply encourage people to share the story.

Professional [[beggar]]s have been exploiting sick children since ancient times. The success of such scams relies on a particular [[compassion]] in people towards children. When a child is sick, this particularly touches people's hearts.&lt;ref name=pmw&gt;Patricia M. Wallace, "The Internet in the workplace: how new technology is transforming work", 2004, {{ISBN|0-521-80931-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SiOOeEBrxywC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=%22sick+child%22+scam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BTc0T7O6JcmHsALemvyiAg&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sick%20child%22%20scam&amp;f=false p. 103]&lt;/ref&gt; An early example of this kind of hoax online is the "sick child [[chain letter]]",&lt;ref name=pmw/&gt; an email making the claim that "with every name that this [letter] is sent to, the [[American Cancer Society]] will donate 3 cents per name to her treatment".

Social media, such as [[Facebook]], facilitate the following form of this scam. A photo of a sick child is posted online, commonly without knowledge of the relatives, accompanied by a heart-touching story and sometimes a request for donations, which are simply collected by the scammer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2088292/Conmen-set-Facebook-site-asking-donations-help-fund-heart-transplant-dead-toddler.html Grieving mother distraught after con-men set up Facebook site asking for donations to help fund heart transplant for her dead toddler daughter]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/facebook/facebook-hoax-this-childs-got-a-cancer/7137 Facebook hoax: this child's got a cancer]&lt;/ref&gt; Often these photos become [[viral (disambiguation)|viral]], so it becomes close to impossible to take them down. Since Facebook has been slow to address the problem efficiently (relying on user takedown requests and reports only), several scam- and hoax-combatting websites have worked together to raise the awareness of social media providers regarding this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/facebook/anti-scam-websites-beg-facebook-to-remove-sick-baby-hoaxes/8613 Anti-scam websites beg Facebook to remove sick baby hoaxes]
* a follow-up: [http://www.zdnet.com/blog/facebook/facebook-removes-sick-baby-hoaxes-urges-users-to-report-more/8675 Facebook removes sick baby hoaxes, urges users to report more]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was observed that these may often be a mischievous modification of the true story of one [[Craig Shergold]], a child with [[brain cancer]], whose efforts were to enter the [[Guinness Book of Records]] for receiving most get-well [[greeting card]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/01/technology/internet-s-chain-of-foolery.html?pagewanted=all Internet's Chain Of Foolery]&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation of this scam is the "sick parent" hoax, where an individual will enter a church, charity or other organization and claim they do not have the money for a bus ticket to see their sick or dying parent. An often-flimsy story is usually accompanied by emotional language. They will then ask for cash, saying that such institutions have an obligation to help those in need.

'''Skeptics in the Pub''' (abbreviated '''SITP''') is an informal social event designed to promote fellowship and social networking among [[skeptic]]s, [[critical thinking|critical-thinkers]], [[freethought|freethinkers]], [[Rationalism|rationalists]] and other like-minded individuals. It provides an opportunity for skeptics to talk, share ideas and have fun in a casual atmosphere, and discuss whatever topical issues come to mind, while promoting [[scientific skepticism|skepticism]], [[science]], and [[rationality]].&lt;ref name="Meet Sid Rodrigues"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meettheskeptics.libsyn.com/mts-meet-sid-rodrigues|publisher=''Meet the Skeptics'' [[Podcast]]|date=13 April 2011|title=Meet Sid Rodrigues}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format ==
"Skeptics in the Pub" is not a protected term, anyone can set one up. There also is no formal procedure to organising an event; organisers can fill in activities as they see fit. There are, however, some common approaches across the world in hosting such events that make them more successful.&lt;ref name="QED"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldxb_PjIgOs |title=Skeptics in the Pub Workshop (2011) |author=[[Michael Marshall (skeptic)|Michael Marshall]], Simon Perry and Mark Pentler |work=QED: Question, Explore Discover |publisher=North West Skeptical Events Ltd. |date=20 February 2013 |accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usual format of meetings includes an [[Public speaking|invited speaker]] who gives a talk on a specific topic, followed by a question-and-answer session.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/8544995.stm |title=Out of the labs, into the pubs |author=Owen Duffy |work=[[BBC News]] |date=9 March 2010 |accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other meet-ups are informal socials, with no fixed agenda. The groups usually meet once a month at a public venue, most often a local [[public house|pub]]. There are now more than 100 different "SitP" groups running around the world.&lt;ref name=sitpweb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skeptic.org.uk/events/skeptics-in-the-pub|title=Skeptics in the Pub website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sitpmap&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skeptic.org.uk/sitp|title=Skeptics in the Pub - Google Maps|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== London ===

The inaugural speaker was [[Wendy M. Grossman]], the editor and founder of ''[[The Skeptic (UK magazine)|The Skeptic]]'' magazine, in February{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} 1999; this first talk attracted 30 attendees.&lt;ref name="Meet Sid Rodrigues"/&gt; The London group claims to be the "World's largest regular pub meeting," with 200 to 400 people in attendance at each meeting.&lt;ref name="Meet Sid Rodrigues"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Metro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/big-smoke/blog/7921/London_social-Skeptics_in_the_Pub.html|publisher=''Time Out, London''|date=9 June 2009|title=The Big Smoke, London Social: Skeptics in the Pub|last=Brown|first=Matt|accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell ran the London group for three years while there on a teaching sabbatical,&lt;ref name="Meet Sid Rodrigues"/&gt; and was succeeded after his return to Australia by two [[science fiction|sci-fi]] fans and skeptics, Robert Newman and Marc LaChappelle. [[Nick Pullar]], who made a [[television]] appearance as "Convener of Skeptics in the Pub" on the [[BBC Television|BBC]] spoof show ''[[High Spirits with Shirley Ghostman|Shirley Ghostman]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skeptic.org.uk/pub/shirleyghostman.html|last=Pullar|first=Nick|title=Shirley Ghostman and me|publisher=''The Skeptic''|date=20 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyyouens.com/shirley.htm|last=Youens|first=Tony|title=Shirley Ghostman|date=21 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2008/10/12/high-spirits-with-sh.html|last=Metzger|first=Richard|title=High Spirits with Shirley Ghostman|date=12 October 2008|publisher=[[Boing Boing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; then led the group from 2003 to 2008.
As of 2011, the London group was co-convened by [[Sid Rodrigues]],&lt;ref name="Meet Sid Rodrigues"/&gt; who has co-organised events in several other cities around the world.{{citation needed|reason=Source did not mention Rodrigues or London.|date=July 2016}} This group has conducted experiments on the [[paranormal]] as part of [[James Randi|James Randi's]]  [[One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.randi.org/jr/060305be.html#6|title=A Preliminary Test for the JREF PRIZE is Completed|last=Randi|first=James|publisher=''Swift''|date=3 June 2005| accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and co-organised  ''An Evening with James Randi &amp; Friends''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/an_evening_with_james_randi_and_friends|title=An Evening With James Randi &amp; Friends|last=Cohen|first=Jon|publisher=''Skeptical Inquirer''|date=23 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itricks.com/randishow/?p=23|title=Preview Of The Amazing Meeting with James Randi on iTricks|publisher=''The Amazing Show''|date=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article3798760.ece |title=Homeopathy - what a waste of time|last=Singh|first=Simon|publisher=''The Times Online''|date=23 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Around the world ===
The ease of use of the internet, via social networking sites and content management systems,&lt;ref name="Grothe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/skepticism_2.0/|title=Skepticism 2.0|last=Grothe|first= D.J.|publisher=''Skeptical Inquirer'' Volume 33.6|date=November–December 2009|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; has led to more than 100 active chapters around the world, including more than 30 in the US and more than 40 in the UK.&lt;ref name=sitpweb/&gt;&lt;ref name=sitpmap/&gt; In 2009, [[D. J. Grothe]] described the rise of Skeptics in the Pub across cities in North America and elsewhere as a prominent example of "Skepticism 2.0". SITPs were often founded outside the realm of existing [[list of skeptical organizations|skeptical organisations]] (mostly centred around [[List of skeptical magazines|magazines]]), with some successful meetings growing out to become fully-fledged membership organisations.&lt;ref name="Grothe"/&gt;

"Skeptics in the Pub" would later serve as the template for other skeptical, rationalist, and [[atheist]] meet-ups around the globe, including The [[James Randi Educational Foundation]]'s "The Amazing Meeting", Drinking Skeptically, [[Brights movement|The Brights]], and the [[British Humanist Association]] social gatherings.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Since 2010 [[Edinburgh Skeptics|Edinburgh Skeptics in the Pub]] has extended the Skeptics in the Pub concept over the whole [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh International Festival Fringe]], under the banner ''Skeptics on the Fringe'' and from 2012 done the same at the [[Edinburgh International Science Festival]] with the title ''At The Fringe of Reason''.  The Merseyside Skeptics Society and Greater Manchester Skeptics (forming North West Skeptical Events Ltd) hosted three two-day conferences, QED, in February 2011, March 2012 and April 2013.  Glasgow Skeptics has also hosted two one-day conferences, as of July 2011.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The '''Supercars Championship''' (known as the '''Virgin Australia Supercars Championship''' for sponsorship purposes) is a [[touring car racing]] category based in Australia and run as an International Series under [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) regulations.

The vehicles used in the series are loosely based on road-going, four-door [[Sedan (automobile)|saloon]] cars. Cars are custom made using a control chassis, with only certain body panels being common between the road cars and race cars. To ensure parity between each make of car, many control components are utilised. All cars must use a 5.0-litre, naturally aspirated V8 engine.&lt;ref name="tech"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.v8supercars.com.au/championship/rules-and-cars/next-gen-v8-supercars | title=Next Gen V8 Supercars | work=V8Supercars.com.au | publisher=BigPond Sport | accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally only for [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon (FG X)]]s and [[Holden Commodore|Holden Commodore (ZB)]]s, the New Generation V8 Supercar regulations, introduced in 2013, opened up the series to more manufacturers.&lt;ref name="COTF"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.v8supercars.com.au/technical/car-of-the-future | title=The New Generation of V8 Supercars | last=Noonan | first=Aaron | work=V8Supercars.com.au | publisher=BigPond Sport | accessdate=22 March 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318003038/http://www.v8supercars.com.au/technical/car-of-the-future | archivedate=18 March 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nissan]] were the first new manufacturer to commit to the series with four [[Nissan Altima#Fifth generation (L33, 2013+)|Nissan Altima L33s]]&lt;ref name="Nissan"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2012/02/09/nissan-confirms-kelly-racing-v8-supercars-entry/ | title=Nissan confirms Kelly Racing V8 Supercars entry | work=SpeedCafe | date=9 February 2012 | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed briefly by [[Erebus Motorsport]] with three [[Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG]]s.&lt;ref name="Merc"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/191998/mercedes-benz-amg-racers-enter-v8-supercars/ | title=Mercedes-Benz AMG racers to enter V8 Supercars | work=CarAdvice.com.au | last=Spinks | first=Jez | date=19 September 2012 | accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]] entered the series in 2014 with [[Garry Rogers Motorsport]] racing the [[Volvo S60]].&lt;ref name="GRMVolvo"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://motoring.ninemsn.com.au/cars/features/8675846/breaking-volvo-confirms-entry-into-v8-supercars | title=Volvo confirms entry into V8 Supercars | work=Auto Action | publisher=NineMSN | date=17 June 2013 | accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Group 3A===
[[File:Skaife-vp94.jpg|thumb|225px|[[Mark Skaife]]'s 1994 [[Holden VP Commodore]]]]
[[File:Lowndes-vr96.jpg|thumb|225px|[[Craig Lowndes]]' 1996 [[Holden VR Commodore]]]]

The concept of a formula centred around [[V8 engine|V8-engined]] [[Ford Australia|Ford]]s and [[Holden]]s for the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] had been established as early as mid-1991. With the new regulations set to come into effect in [[1993 Australian Touring Car Championship|1993]], Ford and Holden were both keen to know the details of the new formula by the end of 1991, putting pressure on the [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport]] (CAMS) to provide clarity on the matter. However, CAMS was waiting to see what the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] did with its proposed international formula for 2.5 and 2.0-litre touring cars.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhalgh, Howard, Wilson (2011), p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;

The new rules for the ATCC were announced in November 1991 and indicated that the V8 cars would be significantly faster than the smaller engined cars. During 1992, CAMS looked at closing the performance gap between the classes, only to have protests from Ford and Holden, who did not want to see their cars beaten by the smaller cars. In June 1992, the class structure was confirmed:&lt;ref name="50Y 323"&gt;Greenhalgh, Howard, Wilson (2011), p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;

* Class A: Australian-produced 5.0-litre V8-engined Fords and Holdens.
* Class B: 2.0-litre cars complying with [[Supertouring|FIA Class II Touring Car]] regulations.
* Class C: normally aspirated two-wheel drive cars complying with 1992 CAMS Group 3A Touring Car regulations. This class would only be eligible in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;CAMS Manual of Motor Sport (1993), p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the [[Ford EB Falcon]] and [[Holden VP Commodore]] ran American-based engines which were restricted to 7,500 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] and a [[compression ratio]] of 10:1. The Holden teams had the option of using the [[Group A]]-developed 5.0-litre [[Holden V8 engine]], although this was restricted to the second tier 'privateer' teams from 1994 onwards, forcing the major Holden runners to use the more expensive [[Chevrolet small block engine|Chevrolet]] engine. The V8s were first eligible to compete in the endurance races of [[1992 Australian Touring Car season|1992]]. The distinctive aerodynamics package, consisting of large [[Diffuser (automotive)|front]] and [[Wing (automotive)|rear spoilers]], was designed partly with this in mind, to give the new cars a better chance of beating the [[Nissan Skyline GT-R#Third generation (1989–1994)|Nissan Skyline GT-R]]s in those races.&lt;ref name="50Y 323" /&gt;

The new rules meant that cars such as the [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] Nissan Skyline GT-R and [[Ford Sierra RS500 Cosworth]] were not eligible to compete in 1993, while cars such as the [[BMW M3]] were. However, the M3 received few of the liberal concessions given to the new V8s and also had an extra {{convert|100|kg|lb}} added to its minimum weight so,&lt;ref name="50Y 324"&gt;Greenhalgh, Howard, Wilson (2011), p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; with the Class C cars eligible for 1993 only, the German manufacturer's attention switched to the 2.0-litre class for 1994.

Cars from all three classes would contest the [[1993 Australian Touring Car Championship]] as well as non-championship Australian touring car events such as the [[Bathurst 1000]]. However, for the purposes of race classification and points allocation, cars competed in two classes:
# Over 2,000cc.
# Under 2,000cc.

Originally the 2.0-litre class cars competed in a separate race to the V8s. This was changed for the second round of 1993 after there were only nine entrants in the 2.0-litre class for the first round at [[Amaroo Park]].&lt;ref name="50Y 324" /&gt;

With the new regulations intended to be a [[Parity (sports)|parity]] formula, there were protests by the Holden teams that the Fords had an aerodynamic advantage after they won the opening three rounds, beating the Commodore comprehensively. After round five at [[Winton Motor Raceway|Winton]], Holden was granted a new front and rear wing package. The BMWs were also allowed a new splitter and a full DTM-specification rear wing.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhalgh, Howard, Wilson (2011), p. 325–327&lt;/ref&gt; Disparity between the Fords and Holdens continued to be a talking point during the next few years, with various concessions given to each manufacturer to try and equalise the two cars.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhalgh, Howard, Wilson (2011), p. 332–353&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[1995 Australian Touring Car Championship|1995]], the 2.0-litre cars, now contesting their own series as [[Australian Super Touring Championship|Super Touring cars]], became ineligible for the Australian Touring Car Championship. They did not contest the endurance races at Sandown and Bathurst, leaving these open solely to the 5.0-litre Ford and Holden models.

===V8 Supercars===
[[File:Glenn Seton 1997 EL Falcon Muscle Car Masters 2011.JPG|thumb|225px|[[Glenn Seton]]'s 1997 [[Ford EL Falcon]], pictured in 2011]]

The Australian Vee Eight Super Car Company (AVESCO) – a joint venture between the Touring Car Entrants Group of Australia (TEGA), sports promoters [[IMG (business)|IMG]] and the Australian Motor Sports Commission – was formed in November 1996 to run the series. This set the foundation for the large expansion of the series during the following years. The category also adopted the name 'V8 Supercars' at this time,&lt;ref name="10Y 14"&gt;Clarke, Wensley (2007), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; though the cars themselves were much unchanged. A new television deal with [[Network Ten]] and [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] was organised, although this had [[Bathurst 1000#A race divided|follow-on effects]] for the [[Bathurst 1000]] later in the year.&lt;ref name="C10"&gt;Greenhalgh, Howard, Wilson (2011), p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1997, [[Tony Cochrane]] and James Erskine left IMG. Together with David Coe, they formed Sports &amp; Entertainment Limited (SEL) in April 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Wensley (2007), p.15&lt;/ref&gt; TEGA would have a 75% share in AVESCO, with SEL owning the other 25%. TEGA was responsible for the rules and technical management of the series and the supply of cars and drivers while SEL was responsible for capturing and maintaining broadcasting rights, sponsorship, licensing and sanction agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.speedcafe.com.au/2011/05/17/timeline-the-growth-of-v8-supercars-from-atcc/ | title=Timeline: The Growth of V8 Supercars | work=SpeedCafe | date=17 May 2011 | accessdate=23 March 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625113517/http://www.speedcafe.com.au/2011/05/17/timeline-the-growth-of-v8-supercars-from-atcc/ | archivedate=25 June 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion of the series began in [[1998 Australian Touring Car Championship|1998]], with the first round to be held in the [[Northern Territory]] taking place at [[Hidden Valley Raceway]]. In [[1999 Shell Championship Series|1999]], a [[Adelaide 500|new street-race]] on a shortened version of the [[Adelaide Street Circuit|Adelaide Grand Prix Circuit]] became one of the first festival-style events which would become common in later years. Australia's capital city, [[Canberra]], hosted its [[Canberra 400|first event]] on the [[Canberra Street Circuit]] in [[2000 Shell Championship Series|2000]]. In [[2001 Shell Championship Series|2001]], a championship round was held in [[New Zealand]] for the first time, at [[Pukekohe Park Raceway]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Wensley (2007), p. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2002 V8 Supercar Championship Series|2002]], the V8 Supercar support event at the [[Nikon Indy 300|Indy 300]] on the [[Surfers Paradise Street Circuit|Gold Coast]] became a championship round, having been a non-championship event since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Wensley (2007), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

Major format changes were made for 1999, with the incorporation of the endurance races into the championship. Control tyres were used for the first time, with [[Bridgestone]] selected as the supplier. The series was also renamed from the 'Australian Touring Car Championship' to the 'Shell Championship Series', by virtue of [[Shell Australia|Shell's]] sponsorship of the category.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhalgh, Howard, Wilson (2011), p. 388–389&lt;/ref&gt; Reverse-grid races were introduced for multiple rounds in 2000&lt;ref&gt;Greenhalgh, Howard, Wilson (2011), p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; before being confined to just the Canberra round for 2001. Also in 2001, compulsory [[pit stop]]s were introduced at certain rounds and the Top Ten Shootout was used at all rounds.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhalgh, Howard, Wilson (2011), p. 411&lt;/ref&gt; The control tyre supplier changed from Bridgestone to [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]] in 2002 and the series name was changed to the 'V8 Supercar Championship Series' after Shell discontinued their sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhalgh, Howard, Wilson (2011), p. 421&lt;/ref&gt;

====Project Blueprint====
[[File:Todd Kelly Barbagello.jpg|thumb|225px|right|[[Todd Kelly]]'s 2003 [[Holden VY Commodore]]]]

Discussions about parity had returned in 2000, with 100 millimetres trimmed from the front spoiler of the Commodore after Holden, in particular, the [[Holden Racing Team]], had dominated in 1998 and 1999. This was in response to the 300&amp;nbsp;mm removed from the Falcon in previous seasons, and coincided with a 10&amp;nbsp;mm trim from the Falcon's rear spoiler. The small reduction for the Holden teams was quickly addressed with both cars receiving the same front splitter shortly afterwards,  but the Falcon's rear wing remained trimmed. Ford had threatened to withdraw from the series, but nothing came of this.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhalgh, Howard, Wilson (2011), p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; After Holden again dominated in 2001 and 2002, a new set of regulations, dubbed 'Project Blueprint', was introduced in [[2003 V8 Supercar Championship Series|2003]] to close the performance gap between the Commodore and the Falcon,&lt;ref name="50Y 431"&gt;Greenhalgh, Howard, Wilson (2011), p. 431&lt;/ref&gt; thus creating closer, fairer racing.&lt;ref name="HSW V8"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-racing/motorsports/v8-supercars-championship-series2.htm | title=How the V8 Supercars Championship Series Works – The Making of a V8 Supercar | last=Lampton | first=Christopher | publisher=HowStuffWorks.com | accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Project Blueprint was developed by Paul Taylor and Wayne Cattach, who spent two years designing a formula which would eliminate most of the differences between the Fords and Holdens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2011/12/16/paul-taylor/ | title=Paul Taylor | work=SpeedCafe | date=16 December 2011 | accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Project Blueprint saw the chassis pick-up points, [[wheelbase]], [[Axle track|track]] and driving position become common across both manufacturers. The Holdens were now required to use [[Double wishbone suspension|double wishbone]] front suspension, similar to that of the Falcon, rather than the [[MacPherson strut]]s used previously. The aerodynamic packages were comprehensively tested and revised and differences in the [[Cylinder head porting|porting]] of each of the manufacturers' engines were also removed.&lt;ref name="50Y 431" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Wensley (2007), p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; The performance of the new [[Ford BA Falcon]] and [[Holden Commodore (VY)|Holden VY]] and [[Holden Commodore (VZ)|VZ Commodores]] was fairly even for the next four years, with Ford winning the championship in 2003, [[2004 V8 Supercar Championship Series|2004]] and [[2005 V8 Supercar Championship Series|2005]] and Holden winning in [[2006 V8 Supercar Championship Series|2006]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Wensley (2007), p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Reverse-grid races were used at certain events in 2006 before unpopularity with the drivers, teams and fans saw them abolished halfway through the season.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Wensley (2007), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mark Skaife 2009 Sydney 500 Launch.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Mark Skaife]], five-time series champion and leader of the New Generation V8 Supercar project.]]

The [[Holden VE Commodore]] caused controversy when it was introduced in [[2007 V8 Supercar Championship Series|2007]]. The production model was longer, wider and taller than the rival [[Ford BF Falcon]] and outside of the limits set by Project Blueprint. As a result, the VE race car was granted custom bodywork – namely shortened rear doors and a lowered roofline – in order to meet the regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Grennhalgh, Howard, Wilson (2011), p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the VE was approved for use in the series, along with the BF Falcon, after several months of pre-season testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/31062/ve-and-bf-ready-to-duke-it-out/ | title=VE and BF ready to duke it out | work=The Border Mail | publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] | date=25 January 2007 | accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sequential gearbox]]es were introduced in [[2008 V8 Supercar Championship Series|2008]] and became compulsory by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/motor-sports/supercars-changing-with-times/story-e6frf3z3-1111115566495#.UVLEtxwzhyI | title=Supercars changing with times | last=Innes | first=Stuart | work=Fox Sports News | date=16 February 2008 | accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2009 V8 Supercar Championship Series|2009]], [[E85]] (a fuel consisting of 85% [[ethanol]] and 15% [[unleaded petrol]]) was introduced in an effort to improve the environmental image of the sport. Carbon dioxide emissions decreased by up to 50%, however fuel consumption was increased by 30% to produce the same power as before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.smh.com.au/sport/v8-supercars-to-switch-to-ethanol-20081010-4y1f.html | title=V8 Supercars to switch to ethanol | work=smh.com.au | publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=10 October 2008 | accessdate=25 March 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905113541/http://news.smh.com.au/sport/v8-supercars-to-switch-to-ethanol-20081010-4y1f.html | archivedate=5 September 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2009 also saw the introduction of a soft compound tyre at certain events to try to improve the quality of the racing and create different strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.jaxquickfit.com.au/dunlop-sp-sport-maxx-sprint-winton | title=Dunlop to introduce its new V8 Sport Maxx "Sprint" tyre at Winton | work=Jax Quickfit Tyres | date=April 2009 | accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenhalgh, Howard, Wilson (2011), p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, AVESCO changed its name to V8 Supercars Australia (VESA).&lt;ref name="10Y 14" /&gt; The series continued to expand during this time, with races held outside of [[Australasia]] for the first time. The series travelled to the [[Shanghai International Circuit]] in [[China]] in 2005, originally on a five-year agreement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-07-20/china-to-host-v8-supercar-championship/2012152 | title=China to host V8 Supercar championship | work=ABC News | date=20 July 2004 | accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the promoter of the race dropped their support and the series did not return thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Grennhalgh, Howard, Wilson (2011), p. 453&lt;/ref&gt; 2006 saw the series travel to the [[Middle East]], with an event held at the [[Bahrain International Circuit]] in [[Bahrain]].&lt;ref name="10Y 16" /&gt; Multiple new street circuits appeared on the calendar in 2008 and 2009, with new events held in [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] in [[New Zealand]],&lt;ref&gt;Grennhalgh, Howard, Wilson (2011), p. 484&lt;/ref&gt; [[Townsville]] in [[North Queensland]] and at [[Sydney Olympic Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Grennhalgh, Howard, Wilson (2011), p. 495–499&lt;/ref&gt; The series' Middle East expansion continued in 2010 with a second round held at the [[Yas Marina Circuit]] in [[Abu Dhabi]].&lt;ref name="50Y 503" /&gt; In November 2010, the series was granted international status by the FIA for the [[2011 International V8 Supercars Championship|2011 season]], allowing the series to race at up to six international venues each year. As a result, the series name was changed to the 'International V8 Supercars Championship'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport-old/motor-sport-old/v8-supercars-granted-international-series-status/story-e6frepn6-1225949832162 | title=

2008 saw the separate boards of directors of VESA and TEGA merge into a single board that was solely responsible for the administration of the category. The new board of directors was composed of four TEGA representatives, two members from SEL and two independent directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/2008/03/28/v8-supercars-board-streamlined/ | title=V8 Supercars board streamlined | work=Touring Car Times | date=28 March 2008 | accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, TEGA and SEL entered a sale agreement with Australian Motor Racing Partners (AMRP), which had significant financial backing from Archer Capital. This agreement saw SEL lose its 25% stake in V8 Supercars, with Archer Capital taking up a 60% share and TEGA the other 40%. A new board of directors was appointed, with two TEGA representatives and two AMRP representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.speedcafe.com.au/2011/05/17/v8-supercars-confirm-new-ownership-structure/ | title=V8 Supercars confirm new ownership structure | work=SpeedCafe | date=17 May 2011 | accessdate=23 March 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625120006/http://www.speedcafe.com.au/2011/05/17/v8-supercars-confirm-new-ownership-structure/ | archivedate=25 June 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Generation V8 Supercar====
{{See also|2013 International V8 Supercars Championship#New Generation V8 Supercar|label 1=2013 International V8 Supercars Championship § New Generation V8 Supercar}}

In the middle of 2008, a project led by [[Mark Skaife]] was organised by V8 Supercars to investigate future directions for the sport. The project had the primary objective of cutting costs to [[Australian dollar|$]]250,000 per car through the use of control parts and to create a pathway for new manufacturers to enter the series, provided that they have a four-door saloon car in mass production. The new formula, called "Car of the Future", was scheduled to be introduced before or during the [[2012 International V8 Supercars Championship|2012 season]]. The plan was publicly unveiled in March 2010 and was shown to incorporate several key changes to the internal workings of the car. The chassis and the cooling, fuel and electronics systems would all be changed to control parts, with changes to the engine, drivetrain, rear suspension, wheels and the control brake package. The safety of the cars was also to be reviewed and improved.&lt;ref name="COTF Unveil"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.speedcafe.com.au/2010/03/29/v8%E2%80%99s-car-of-the-future-details-announced/ | title=V8's Car of the Future details announced | work=SpeedCafe | date=29 March 2010 | accessdate=27 March 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625110204/http://www.speedcafe.com.au/2010/03/29/v8%E2%80%99s-car-of-the-future-details-announced/ | archivedate=25 June 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the plans were well received by all of the teams, Holden Motorsport boss Simon McNamara warned potential new manufacturers to stay out of the championship just hours after the plans were released, claiming that they would "gain nothing" from entering the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Holden warn off Nissan and Toyota in V8 Supercars powerplay |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/motor/holden-warn-off-nissan-and-toyota-in-v8-supercars-powerplay/story-e6frey5r-1225847111813 |first=James |last=Phelps |work=DailyTelegraph.com.au |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=29 March 2010 |accessdate=30 March 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gen 2 Supercar====
In December 2014, Supercars released details concerning the future of the category. New regulations, dubbed Gen2 Supercar, were introduced in [[2017 Supercars Championship|2017]] to allow the use of [[Coupé|two-door coupé]] body styles and [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] four- or six-cylinder engines. However, no teams elected to build cars for the new regulations until [[2018 Supercars Championship|2018]]. Cars are still required to be based on front-engined, rear-wheel drive, four-seater production cars that are sold in Australia. The chassis and control components will be carried over from the New Generation V8 Supercar regulations, while engine and aerodynamic parity will be reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.v8supercars.com.au/news/championship/v8-supercars-blueprint-for-2017-and-beyond | title=V8 Supercars blueprint for 2017 and beyond | work=V8Supercars.com.au | date=3 December 2014 | accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=V8 vs V6|journal=V8X Magazine|date=December 2016|issue=95|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current New Generation V8 Supercar regulations are an evolution of the previous Project Blueprint regulations. The regulations control many aspects of the car to ensure parity between the manufacturers, allowing for minor differences in the engines and body shapes so that the cars bear some resemblance to their production counterparts. The regulations were also designed to lower the costs of building and repairing a car.&lt;ref name="COTF Unveil" /&gt;

===Bodyshell===
The body of each car is based on its corresponding production car. However, due to the regulations governing the dimensions of the cars to ensure parity, the race cars are lowered and shortened or lengthened to meet the regulations.&lt;ref name="Merc engine"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/DA6D0AF7994F6660CA257ABD007BA513 | title=Erebus reveals Benz V8 Supercar engine specs | quote=At 4.9 metres long, the three Erebus cars that Stone Brothers Racing will field in 2013 are 100mm-odd longer than the E63 AMG road-going sedan on which the race car will be based, but the same width, at 1.8 metres. | last=Park | first=Barry | work=GoAuto.com.au | date=22 November 2012 | accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, only the [[Ford FG X Falcon]], [[Holden VF Commodore]], [[Holden ZB Commodore]], [[Mercedes-Benz E-Class#E63 AMG|Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG W212]], [[Nissan Altima#Fifth generation (L33, 2013+)|Nissan Altima L33]] and [[Volvo S60]] are eligible to compete.&lt;ref&gt;2016 V8 Supercar Operations Manual, p. C1&lt;/ref&gt; To save costs, the front guards, passenger-side front door, rear doors and rear quarter panels are made from composite materials.&lt;ref&gt;2016 V8 Supercar Operations Manual, p. C10&lt;/ref&gt; The tail lamps are carried over from the road car, while the windscreen is replaced by a polycarbonate unit.&lt;ref name="tech" /&gt;

The bodies are built around a control chassis, featuring a full [[roll cage]], originally designed by PACE Innovations but which can be made, or partially made, by other accredited builders, including certain race teams.&lt;ref name="tech" /&gt; Many safety features are utilised to protect the driver in the event of a crash. The fuel tank is positioned in front of the rear axle to prevent it from being damaged or ruptured in a rear end impact. The driver is seated towards the centre of the car and extra reinforcement is used on the roll cage on the driver's side to lessen the risk of injury in a side-on collision. The cars also feature a collapsible steering column and a fire extinguisher system.&lt;ref name="COTF" /&gt;

===Aerodynamics===
All cars have an aerodynamics package consisting of a front spoiler and [[Diffuser (automotive)|splitter]], side skirts and a [[Wing (automotive)|rear wing]]. The aerodynamics package for each manufacturer is homologated after a series of tests which ensure that the different body styles produce near-identical [[downforce]] and [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]] numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2013/02/01/history-made-as-all-four-v8-supercars-manufacturers-face-off/ | title=History made as all four V8 Supercars manufacturers face-off | last1=Bartholomaeus | first1=Stefan | last2=Rowley | first2=Grant | work=SpeedCafe | date=1 February 2013 | accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2013/02/05/all-four-v8-supercars-homologated-for-2013-season/ | title=All four V8 Supercars homologated for 2013 season | work=SpeedCafe | date=5 February 2013 | accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weight===
The minimum weight of each car is {{convert|1410|kg|lb}} including the driver, with a minimum load of 755&amp;nbsp;kg over the front axle. The minimum weight for the driver is 100&amp;nbsp;kg and includes the driver dressed in a full racing suit, the seat and seat mountings and any ballast needed to meet the minimum weight.&lt;ref&gt;2016 V8 Supercar Operations Manual, p. C7&lt;/ref&gt; Some other components also have a minimum weight, such as the engine (200&amp;nbsp;kg) and the front uprights (10.5&amp;nbsp;kg each).&lt;ref&gt;2016 V8 Supercar Operations Manual, p. C17–C24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engine and drivetrain===
All cars must be [[Front-engine design|front-engined]] and [[rear-wheel drive]]. All cars use a 5.0-litre, naturally aspirated V8-engine with [[electronic fuel injection]], capable of producing between 460 and 485 [[Kilowatt|kW]] (620–650 [[Horsepower|bhp]]).&lt;ref name="tech" /&gt; Manufacturers are free to choose between using an engine based on one from their own line up or a generic engine provided by V8 Supercars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2012/10/06/private-backer-pushing-for-mazda-djr-switch/ | title=Private backer pushing for Mazda DJR switch | quote=Adopting V8 Supercars' own 'generic engine' could also be an option. | last=Bartholomaeus | first=Stefan | last2=Rowley | first2=Grant | work=SpeedCafe | date=6 October 2012 | accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Ford and Holden use US-based racing engines with [[pushrod]] actuated valves and two valves per cylinder. Mercedes, Nissan and Volvo use modified versions of their own engines, with hydraulic-lift valves and four valves per cylinder.&lt;ref name="Merc engine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2012/09/04/nissan-reveals-2013-v8-supercar-engine/ | title=Nissan reveals 2013 V8 Supercar engine | last=Bartholomaeus | first=Stefan | work=SpeedCafe | date=4 September 2012 | accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; All engines are electronically limited to 7,500 rpm and have a compression ratio of 10:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2012/10/12/road-version-of-mercedes-v8-supercars-contender-spied/ | title=Road version of Mercedes V8 Supercars contender spied | last=Bartholomaeus | first=Stefan | work=SpeedCafe | quote=...which require the motors to be of 5.0 litres in capacity, running a 10:1 compression ratio and 7,500rpm rev limit. | date=12 October 2012 | accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Power is transferred from the engine to the rear wheels through a six-speed sequential transaxle with an integrated [[Locking differential#Spool|spool differential]].&lt;ref name="tech" /&gt; The individual [[gear ratio]]s and the [[final drive ratio]] are fixed with drop gears at the front of the transaxle allowing the teams to alter the overall transmission ratio for different circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.v8scglobal.com/features/qa-with-albins-the-v8-supercar-transmission/ | title=Q&amp;A with Albins -The V8 Supercar Transmission | work=V8SC Global | date=26 February 2013 | accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cars use a [[Clutch#Multiple plate clutch|triple plate clutch.]]&lt;ref name="tech" /&gt; The cars run on E85 fuel with a fuel tank capacity of 112 litres.&lt;ref name="tech" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2016 V8 Supercar Operations Manual, p. C25&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[electronic control unit]] (ECU), provided by MoTeC, is used to monitor and optimise various aspects of the engine's performance. Numerous sensors in the car collect information which is then transmitted to the team, allowing them to monitor things such as tyre wear and fuel consumption and find potential problems with the car. The ECU is also used by officials during the scrutineering process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.v8scglobal.com/inside-v8-supercars/the-v8-supercar/ | title=The V8 Supercar | publisher=V8SC Global | accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suspension===
All cars are required to use a double wishbone setup for the front suspension and independent rear suspension. Both the front and rear suspension systems feature adjustable [[shock absorber]]s and an [[anti-roll bar]] which can be adjusted from the cockpit.&lt;ref name="tech" /&gt;

===Brakes===
The cars use [[disc brake]]s supplied by [[Brembo#Brembo Group brands|AP Racing]] on the front and rear, with the master cylinders provided by AP Racing or former control brake supplier Alcon. The front discs have a diameter of {{convert|395|mm|in}} and a six-piston caliper, while the rear discs are {{convert|355|mm|in}} diameter and have a four-piston caliper.&lt;ref name="tech" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2016 V8 Supercar Operations Manual, p. C54–C55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wheels and tyres===
The cars use 18-inch control wheels, produced by Rimstock and supplied by Racer Industries, and control tyres from Dunlop. The [[slick tyre]] is available in both hard and soft compounds, with teams required to use either or both compounds in each race, depending on the event. A grooved [[wet tyre]] is used in damp conditions.&lt;ref name="tech" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2016 V8 Supercar Operations Manual, p. C42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost===
The New Generation V8 Supercar regulations were intended to reduce the cost of building a car (without engine) from around $450,000 to $250,000,&lt;ref name="HSW V8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="COTF Unveil" /&gt; with the cost of an engine coming down from around $120,000 to $50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2012/02/21/cotf-opens-door-for-new-ford-holden-engines/ | title=COTF opens door for new Ford, Holden engines | work=SpeedCafe | quote=A current V8 Supercars engine in complete form is estimated to cost $80,000-$120,000. | date=21 February 2012 | accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoW4JRp0rWc | title=Car of the Future Evolution by Mark Skaife | last=Skaife | first=Mark | publisher=V8Supercars.com.au | quote=...which will meet the cost objectives of $50,000 to build... | date=1 December 2011 | accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teams and drivers===
In order to compete in the Supercars Championship, drivers are required to hold a CAMS National Circuit Competition Licence, or a licence of an equivalent or higher level.&lt;ref&gt;2016 V8 Supercar Operations Manual, p. A11&lt;/ref&gt; Each car entered is required to have a Racing Entitlements Contract (REC). A REC is a contract between Supercars and a team which outlines the team's entitlements and obligations.&lt;ref&gt;2016 V8 Supercar Operations Manual, p. A6–A10&lt;/ref&gt; RECs may be leased by their owners to another party for a maximum of two years, after which the owner must either use it themselves or sell it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2012/04/05/charlie-schwekolt-closes-in-on-2013-v8-plans/ | title=Charlie Schwerkolt closes in on 2013 V8 plans | work=Speedcafe | last=Rowley | first=Grant | date=5 April 2012 | accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A racing number is tied to each REC, with teams able to apply for a REC number to be changed. The defending series champion is entitled to use the number 1, with the original REC number of that car reserved and not able to be used by another team without the agreement of its owner.&lt;ref&gt;2016 V8 Supercar Operations Manual, p. E8&lt;/ref&gt;

The RECs were originally issued in 1999. Known as TEGA franchise agreements, they were divided into three categories – Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. Twelve Level 1 franchises were issued to those teams that had competed in the series full-time since its inception in 1997:&lt;ref name=GreatRace19&gt;{{cite book|last=Normoyle|first=Steve|title=The Great Race 19|year=1999|publisher=Chevron Publishing|location=Hornsby|issn=1031-6124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A thirteenth was later issued to [[Bob Forbes Racing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|749|2005|litigants=Gibson Motor Sport Merchandise Pty Ltd v Robert James Forbes |courtname=auto |date=29 June 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A Level 1 franchise required a team to race at least one car at all events, and at various times allowed a team to enter up to four cars. Other teams received Level 2 and Level 3 franchises based on their level of participation.&lt;ref name=GreatRace19/&gt; The structure was changed a number of times before the present system of 28 RECs was arrived at in 2011. Supercars bought a number of RECs as they became available in order to achieve a long-held desire to reduce the field to 28 cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2009/11/04/the-push-for-28-entries-remains/ | title=The push for 28 entries remains | work=Speedcafe | date=4 November 2009 | accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2013, [[Lucas Dumbrell Motorsport]], [[Tony D'Alberto Racing]] and [[Triple F Racing]] each returned a REC to Supercars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2014/02/05/v8-supercars-confirms-25-cars/|title=V8 Supercars confirms 25 car grid for 2014|work=Speedcafe|date=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were put up for sale in 2014, but no bids were received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2014/06/23/v8-supercars-open-rec-tender/|title=V8 Supercars to open REC tender|work=Speedcafe|date=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One was reclaimed by Lucas Dumbrell Motorsport in 2015 after a legal fight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.v8supercars.com.au/news/championship/ldm-to-run-two-cars-in-2015 LDM to run two cars in 2015] V8 Supercars 5 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2014, a further REC was returned by [[James Rosenberg Racing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2014/12/03/rosenberg-dumps-license-in-walkinshaw-shock/|title=Rosenberg dumps license in Walkinshaw shock|work=Speedcafe|date=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, Supercars launched a tender for one REC for the 2016 season, with Triple Eight the successful bidder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2015/04/10/v8-supercars-launches-tender-for-26th-rec/|title=V8 Supercars launches tender for 26th REC|work=Speedcafe|date=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teams consist of one to four cars, with most one-car teams forming a technical alliance with a larger team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.v8supercars.com.au/news/analysis-the-rise-and-rise-of-tekno-autosports | title=The Rise and Rise of Tekno Autosports | work=V8Supercars.com.au | publisher=V8 Supercars Australia | quote=Jonathan Webb ran as a satellite entry from within the famous Queensland outfit... | date=4 March 2013 | accessdate=20 April 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501175232/http://www.v8supercars.com.au/news/analysis-the-rise-and-rise-of-tekno-autosports | archivedate=1 May 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the REC holders are allowed to compete at each event, although "wildcard" entries are accepted for the endurance races, with a maximum of six extra cars on top of the regular 28.&lt;ref&gt;2016 V8 Supercar Operations Manual, p.

Teams are required to employ a co-driver for each car during the three endurance races due to the increased race distance and the need for driver substitutions during the race.&lt;ref&gt;2016 V8 Supercar Operations Manual, p. D10–D18&lt;/ref&gt; Teams were able to pair their full-time drivers in one car until a rule change in 2010 that required each full-time driver to remain in his own car and be joined by a co-driver not competing full-time in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2009/12/11/v8-drivers-forced-to-split-for-enduros/|title=V8 Drivers Forced to Split for Enduros|work=Speedcafe|date=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Drivers Championship title is awarded to the driver who accumulates the most points over the course of the season. If there is a points tie for the series win, the champion will be decided based on the number of races won by each driver (if there is still a tie, it is based on second-place finishes and so on). Teams also compete for the Teams Championship, with the champion team being decided in the same manner as the Drivers Championship. For Teams Championship points scoring purposes, teams with four cars are separated into a pair of two-car teams, while teams with three cars are split into a two-car team and a single-car team.&lt;ref&gt;2016 V8 Supercar Operations Manual, p. D42&lt;/ref&gt; The Teams Championship dictates the pit lane order for the following season.

The defending driver has the right to carry the number 1 the following year. However, in 2017 [[Shane van Gisbergen]] elected not to, continuing to use 97.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/supercars/supercars-shane-van-gisbergen-to-use-no-97-not-no-1-during-2017-season/news-story/abdeea1483ab93dcfcdd4be834c1ad22&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJ_LiGw7PSAhWJTLwKHbI8AEkQFggiMAI&amp;usg=AFQjCNFsmKotavCyC5D2ZLRhSDLP_thDbw|title=Shane van Gisbergen to use No 97, not No 1, during 2017 season|work=[[Fox Sports Australia]]|date=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development series===
{{Main article|Dunlop Super2 Series}}
A second-tier series, the Dunlop Super2 Series, is run as a support category to the main series at certain events.&lt;ref name="V8 About" /&gt; Initially for privateers who did not have the funding of the professional teams in the late 1990s, the series now serves the dual purpose of developing young drivers before they compete in the main series and a means for main series teams to give their endurance co-drivers more racing experience prior to the endurance races. Teams in the Dunlop Super2 Series compete with cars previously used in the main series.

A third V8 Supercar-based series, the [[V8 Touring Car National Series|Kumho Tyres V8 Touring Car Series]], has been run since 2008 but has no involvement with the Supercars Championship or Dunlop Super2 Series, instead running on the programme of the [[Shannons Nationals Motor Racing Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thenationals.com.au/index.php?page=kumho-tyres-v8-touring-cars | title=Kumho Tyres V8 Touring Cars | publisher=Shannons National Motor Racing Championships | accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since 2016, several rounds have been run as support categories at Supercars events.

==Race formats==
There are four types of events held in Supercars, each with its own race format: SuperSprint events, International SuperSprint events, SuperStreet events and Enduro Cup events.&lt;ref name="2014 formats"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/v8-supercars-simplify-race-formats-for-2014-introduce-three-set-styles-for-every-event-on-the-calendar/story-e6frfkp9-1226719455752 | title=V8 Supercars simplify race formats for 2014, introduce three set styles for every event on the calendar | work=SPEED | publisher=News.com.au | date=15 September 2013 | accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SuperSprint===
[[File:V8 Supercar start 2011.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The start of a race at [[Queensland Raceway]] in [[2011 International V8 Supercars Championship|2011]].]]

The SuperSprint format is used at the [[Tasmania SuperSprint]], [[Phillip Island 500]], [[Perth SuperSprint]], [[Winton SuperSprint]], [[Darwin Triple Crown]], [[Ipswich SuperSprint]], [[The Bend SuperSprint]] and [[Sydney SuperNight 300]].&lt;ref name="OM Formats"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://d3spxwpngnho1k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018-Div-D-FIA-Approved-200218.pdf | title=Supercars Operations Manual 2018 - Division "D" - Sporting Rules | publisher=Supercars | date=23 February 2018 | accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


The Phillip Island and Sydney Motorsport Park events feature a single one-hour practice session on Saturday, while all other SuperSprint events have two one-hour practice sessions on the Friday with a fifteen-minute practice session on Saturday. The Winton and Ipswich events feature an extra thirty-minute session on Friday for endurance co-drivers. The SuperSprint format features a fifteen-minute qualifying session held on Saturday to decide the grid for the race on the same day. A single twenty-minute session is held on Sunday morning to decide the grid for the Sunday race. The Darwin event also features a top ten shootout (a session where the fastest ten qualifiers complete one flying lap each to determine the top ten on the grid) following the Sunday qualifying session. A single 120&amp;nbsp;km race is held on Saturday with a single 200&amp;nbsp;km race held on Sunday.&lt;ref name="OM Formats" /&gt;

====International SuperSprint====
The International SuperSprint format is used at the [[Auckland 500|Auckland SuperSprint]] and [[Melbourne 400]].&lt;ref name="OM Formats" /&gt;

Three thirty-minute practice sessions are held on Friday, while Saturday and Sunday both consist of two ten-minute qualifying sessions which set the grid for the pair of 100&amp;nbsp;km races held on each day.&lt;ref name="OM Formats" /&gt;

===SuperStreet===
The SuperStreet format is used at the [[Adelaide 500]], [[Townsville 400]], and [[Newcastle 500]].&lt;ref name="OM Formats" /&gt;

Two forty-minute practice sessions take place on the Friday at each SuperStreet event, while a twenty-minute practice session is held on the Saturday at Adelaide. The Adelaide event features a twenty-minute qualifying session on Friday to determine the grid for the Saturday race, while the Townsville and Newcastle events have a single twenty-minute session on Saturday. All three events feature a twenty-minute session followed by a top ten shootout on Sunday. Both the Adelaide 500 and the Newcastle 500 feature a single 250&amp;nbsp;km race on each of Saturday and Sunday, while the Townsville event features a 200&amp;nbsp;km race on each of Saturday and Sunday.&lt;ref name="OM Formats" /&gt;

===Enduro Cup===
{{main article|Enduro Cup}}
There are three endurance events held during the year: the [[Sandown 500]], the [[Bathurst 1000]] and the [[Gold Coast 600]]. These events require two drivers per car and together they form the Enduro Cup, a prize awarded to the driver or drivers who score the most points across the three events.&lt;ref name="Enduro"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.v8supercars.com.au/news/v8-supercars-announces-prestigious-endurance-cup | title=V8 Supercars Announces Prestigious Endurance Cup | work=V8Supercars.com.au | publisher=V8 Supercars Australia | date=20 February 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305132459/http://www.v8supercars.com.au/news/v8-supercars-announces-prestigious-endurance-cup | archivedate=5 March 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sandown 500 and the Gold Coast 600 both feature three thirty-minute practice sessions held on Friday, with Sandown having an extra session on Saturday. Practice for the Bathurst 1000 consists of six one-hour sessions held across Thursday, Friday and Saturday.&lt;ref name="OM Formats" /&gt; Qualifying for the Sandown 500 involves a twenty-minute session followed by a pair of 60&amp;nbsp;km "qualifying races" held on Saturday.&lt;ref name="2013 formats"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2012/12/07/radical-changes-to-v8-supercars-race-formats/ | title=Radical changes to V8 Supercars race formats | work=SpeedCafe | date=7 December 2012 | accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grid for the first race is based on the qualifying session; the grid for the second race is based on the results of the first. The results of the second race determine the grid for the main race on Sunday. Co-drivers must compete in the first of the qualifying races while the main driver must compete in the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.v8supercars.com.au/news/10-fast-facts-wilson-security-sandown-500 | title=10 Fast Facts: Wilson Security Sandown 500 | work=V8Supercars.com.au | date=9 September 2013 | accessdate=12 September 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914045022/http://www.v8supercars.com.au/news/10-fast-facts-wilson-security-sandown-500 | archivedate=14 September 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bathurst 1000 features a single forty-minute qualifying session on Friday afternoon followed by a top ten shootout on Saturday. The Gold Coast 600 has two twenty-minute qualifying sessions, one each on Saturday and Sunday, with the Sunday session followed by a top ten shootout. The Sandown 500 and Bathurst 1000 both have a twenty-minute warm-up session on Sunday morning.&lt;ref name="OM Formats" /&gt;

The Sandown 500 and the Bathurst 1000 feature single races held on Sunday, at 500&amp;nbsp;km and 1000&amp;nbsp;km in length respectively. The Gold Coast 600 consists of two 300&amp;nbsp;km races with one held on Saturday and one on Sunday.&lt;ref name="OM Formats" /&gt;

===Points system===
Points are awarded as follows at all championship events. Various different points scales are applied to events having one, two, three or four races, ensuring that a driver will be awarded 300 points for winning all races at any event.&lt;ref&gt;2016 V8 Supercar Operations Manual, p. D67–D68&lt;/ref&gt; Points are awarded to all cars that have covered 75% of the race distance, provided they are running at the completion of the final lap and with a final lap time within 200% of the race winner's fastest lap. At the endurance events, both drivers earn the total points awarded to the finishing position of the car.&lt;ref&gt;2016 V8 Supercar Operations Manual, p. D41–D42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bathurst 1000===
{{main article|Bathurst 1000}}

The Bathurst 1000, also known as the "Great Race" and held in some form since [[1960 Armstrong 500|1960]], is the most famous race on the Supercars calendar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.craiglowndes.com.au/News/091012.htm | title=Frustrating Day at Bathurst | work=CraigLowndes.com.au | quote=...for much of Australia's most famous motor race. | accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the longest both in terms of race distance and race time. The race is run over 161 laps of the [[Mount Panorama Circuit]], 1000&amp;nbsp;km in total, with the race taking between six and seven hours to complete. The event has attracted crowds of nearly 200,000 people.&lt;ref name="V8TV" /&gt; The [[Peter Brock Trophy]], named after nine-time Bathurst 1000 winner [[Peter Brock]], is awarded to the winners of the race. The trophy was introduced in [[2006 Bathurst 1000|2006]] following Brock's death in a crash at the [[Targa West]] rally one month prior to the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Sport/Peter-Brock-Trophy-to-last-a-lifetime/2006/10/06/1159641505059.html | title=Peter Brock Trophy to last a lifetime | work=smh.com.au | publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=6 October 2006 | accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sandown 500===
{{main article|Sandown 500}}

The Sandown 500 was first held as a six-hour race in [[1964 Sandown 6 Hour International|1964]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/motor-sports/v8-supercars/v8-supercars-stars-tell-speed-how-to-win-this-weekends-dick-smith-sandown-500/story-fn2ms9um-1226473877148#.UVeUTxwzhyI | title=V8 Supercars stars tell SPEED how to win this weekend's Dick Smith Sandown 500 | work=The Daily Telegraph | publisher=Fox Sports News | last=Kelly | first=Rick | date=14 September 2012 | accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been labelled as the traditional "Bathurst warm-up" race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2012/09/08/crimsafe-endurance-countdown-episode-6-return-of-sandown-500/ | title=Crimsafe Endurance Countdown, Episode 6, Return of Sandown 500 | work=SpeedCafe | date=8 September 2012 | accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Bathurst 1000, the Sandown 500 is run over 161 laps. Due to the shorter track length of [[Sandown Raceway]], the race is only 500&amp;nbsp;km and runs for between three and four hours. The Sandown 500 was not held for Supercars from 1999 to 2002 and from 2008 to 2011. During these years, the 500&amp;nbsp;km endurance races took place at [[Queensland Raceway]] (1999–2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://v8supercar-racing.com/queensland-raceway.shtml | title=Queensland Raceway | publisher=V8 Supercar Racing | accessdate=31 March 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801135129/http://v8supercar-racing.com/queensland-raceway.shtml | archivedate=1 August 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit]] (2008–2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.carsguide.com.au/blogs-and-stuff/craig-lowndes/sandown_500_back_where_it_belongs/ | title=Sandown 500 back where it belongs | last=Lowndes | first=Craig | work=CarsGuide.com.au | quote=Over the past four years the 500km race has been staged at Phillip Island... | date=11 September 2012 | accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adelaide 500===
{{main article|Adelaide 500}}
The Adelaide 500 has been held since [[1999 Sensational Adelaide 500|1999]] and has become the traditional season-opening event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/the-2013-clipsal-500-will-keep-its-traditional-season-opening-spot-as-tickets-go-on-sale-today/story-e6frfkp9-1226486392849 | title=The 2013 Clipsal 500 will keep its traditional season opening spot as tickets go on sale today | last=Dale | first=William | work=SPEED | publisher=News Limited | date=2 October 2012 | accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is run on a shortened version of the former Adelaide Grand Prix Circuit. Consisting of two 250&amp;nbsp;km races run on Saturday and Sunday, the event has been labelled the most physically demanding by the drivers, due to the length of each race, the nature of the circuit and the effect of the heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.morrisfinance.com.au/news/clipsal-500-adelaide-preview-2013 | title=2013 Clipsal 500 Adelaide Preview | work=Morris Finance Ltd. | date=28 February 2013 | accessdate=1 April 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409213821/http://www.morrisfinance.com.au/news/clipsal-500-adelaide-preview-2013 | archivedate=9 April 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The event's format was changed for 2014, with the Saturday race being replaced with a pair of 125&amp;nbsp;km races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.v8supercars.com.au/news/2014-clipsal-500-details-revealed | title=2014 Clipsal 500 Details Revealed | work=V8Supercars.com.au | date=14 November 2013 | accessdate=15 January 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117075255/http://www.v8supercars.com.au/news/2014-clipsal-500-details-revealed | archivedate=17 January 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The event attracts crowds of over 250,000 people&lt;ref name="V8TV" /&gt; and is the only event to be inducted into the [[V8 Supercar Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.clipsal.com.au/trade/news/archive_news/2005/clipsal_500 | title=Clipsal 500 inducted into Motor Sport Hall of Fame | work=Clipsal.com.au | year=2005 | accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Adelaide 500 was the first carnival-style event which would become common in the ten years after its inception, with music concerts held during the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.clipsal500.com.au/the_attractions/overview/the_concerts | title=The Concerts | publisher=Clipsal500.com.au | accessdate=1 April 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413110845/http://clipsal500.com.au/the_attractions/overview/the_concerts | archivedate=13 April 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gold Coast 600/ 500===
{{main article|Gold Coast 600}}
The Gold Coast 600 was introduced in [[2009 V8 Supercar Championship Series|2009]] after the American [[IndyCar Series]] elected not to return to the Surfers Paradise circuit that year. The [[A1 Grand Prix]] series was scheduled to fill the void left by IndyCar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-02-17/gold-coast-indy-undergoes-name-change/298424 | title=Gold Coast Indy undergoes name change | work=ABC News | date=17 February 2009 | accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the owners of the series went into [[liquidation]] in June 2009 and,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/5664677/British-A1-Grand-Prix-arm-stalls.html | title=British A1 Grand Prix arm stalls | last=Harrington | first=Ben | work=The Telegraph | date=27 June 2009 | accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result, the A1 Grand Prix cars were withdrawn from the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/a1-shambles-is-the-pits-anna/story-e6freoof-1225787873936 | title=A1 shambles is the pits, Anna | last1=Passmore | first1=Daryl | last2=Stannard | first2=Damien | work=The Courier Mail | date=17 October 2009 | accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to compensate for this, Supercars introduced a new four-race format, with two 150&amp;nbsp;km races held on each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.speedcafe.com.au/2009/10/18/v8-teams-prepared-for-extra-miles-at-supergp/ | title=V8 teams prepared for extra miles in Qld | work=SpeedCafe | date=18 October 2009 | accessdate=7 April 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625121417/http://www.speedcafe.com.au/2009/10/18/v8-teams-prepared-for-extra-miles-at-supergp/ | archivedate=25 June 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the format changed to include two 300&amp;nbsp;km races and it became a two-driver event. To restore the event's previous international flavour, each team was required to have at least one co-driver with an 'international reputation' (that is, they were recognised for exploits in motorsport outside of Australia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.speedcafe.com.au/2010/04/22/stars-confirmed-for-gold-coast-600/ | title=Stars confirmed for Gold Coast 600 | work=SpeedCafe | date=22 April 2010 | accessdate=7 April 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625114831/http://www.speedcafe.com.au/2010/04/22/stars-confirmed-for-gold-coast-600/ | archivedate=25 June 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2011 International V8 Supercars Championship|2011]] and [[2012 International V8 Supercars Championship|2012]], all entries required an international co-driver. In 2013 the international co-driver rule was dropped, due to a number of incidents during the 2012 event and the formation of the Endurance Cup, but teams could still choose to employ an international driver for the endurance races.&lt;ref name="Enduro" /&gt;

===Newcastle 500===
{{Main article|Newcastle 500}}

In 2004, Supercars introduced the name "Grand Finale"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.v8dailydump.com.au/events/motorsport/sessionList.tt2?SERIESID=1&amp;EVENTID=200413&amp;YEAR=2004 | title=Grand Finale, Eastern Creek Raceway – Round 13 | publisher=V8 Daily Dump | accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the final round of the season (having called it "The Main Event" in 2003 and the "V8 Ultimate" in 2001 and 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.v8dailydump.com.au/events/motorsport/sessionList.tt2?SERIESID=1&amp;EVENTID=13&amp;YEAR=2003 | title=The Main Event – Eastern Creek Raceway – Round 13 | publisher=V8 Daily Dump | accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Finale was held at [[Sandown Raceway]] in 2001 and 2002, [[Sydney Motorsport Park]] in 2003 and 2004, [[Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit|Phillip Island]] in 2005, 2006 and 2007 and [[Oran Park Raceway]] in 2008. The Grand Finale name was used until 2008 before the Sydney 500 became the final event of the series in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/homebush-v8-race-gets-go-ahead/story-e6frfkp9-1111117617476 | title=Homebush V8 race gets go ahead | work=News.com.au | date=29 September 2008 | accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sydney 500 was held around [[Homebush Street Circuit|the streets]] of [[Sydney Olympic Park]]. Its format was similar to the Adelaide 500, with a 250&amp;nbsp;km race held on both Saturday and Sunday. Despite having a relatively simple layout, the circuit was one of the more challenging on the calendar – as evidenced in the 2010 title decider when, in wet conditions, the top three championship runners all slid into the wall at the same time – effectively handing the title to [[James Courtney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/homebush-street-cicruit-throws-up-challenge-to-v8-stars/story-e6frg7mf-1225807089093 | title=Homebush street circuit throws up challenge to V8 stars | work=The Australian | date=4 December 2009 | accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sydney 500 was held for the final time in 2016.&lt;ref name="axe"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2016/03/22/axe-falls-on-sydney-olympic-park-street-race/ | title=Axe falls on Sydney Olympic Park street race | work=Speedcafe | date=22 March 2016 | accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event at Sydney Olympic Park was replaced with a new street race in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], 150&amp;nbsp;km north of Sydney, which will consist of the [[Newcastle Street Circuit|streets]] in the eastern suburbs of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2016/09/27/supercars-confirms-five-year-newcastle-deal/|title=Supercars confirms five-year Newcastle deal|publisher=Speedcafe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
[[File:Neil Crompton 2014.png|thumb|right|150px|Long-time series commentator [[Neil Crompton]] at the 2014 series test day.]]

===Television===
The series is currently broadcast on [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] and [[Network Ten]], in a deal worth $241 million.&lt;ref name="SupercarsTV"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/motor-sports/v8-supercars/v8-supercars-signs-241m-media-rights-deal-with-fox-sports-foxtel-and-ten-network-from-2015/story-fn2ms9um-1226785594801 | title=V8 Supercars signs $241m media rights deal with FOX SPORTS, Foxtel and Ten Network from 2015 | work=[[Fox Sports]] | date=18 December 2013 | accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox Sports shows all practice and qualifying sessions live along with the races. Ten shows only seven events live which are Adelaide, Melbourne, Townsville, Sandown, Bathurst, Gold Coast and Newcastle with the rest shown as a highlights package after the races have finished. The coverage is produced by Supercars Media, a specialist production company for Supercars Australia.&lt;ref name="SupercarsTV" /&gt; Supercars Media provides the commentary for each race, with former champion and Bathurst winner [[Mark Skaife]] as lead commentator, along with [[Neil Crompton]] as expert commentator. [[Mark Larkham]], Riana Crehan and former driver [[Greg Murphy]] cover the pit lane. Both Fox Sports and Ten use their own commentary team for pre- and post-race coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.v8supercars.com.au/news/championship/v8-supercars-commentary-team-revealed | title=V8 Supercars commentary team revealed | work=V8Supercars.com.au | date=6 February 2015 | accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supercars Media records the series in [[1080i]] [[high-definition television|high-definition]], with many cars carrying four or more onboard-cameras, though HD coverage is available only to subscribers of [[Foxtel HD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bartholomaeus | first = Stefan | url = http://www.speedcafe.com/2015/03/03/jury-out-on-v8-tv-deal-after-solid-start/ | title = Jury out on V8 Supercars TV deal after solid start | publisher = ''Speedcafe'' | date = 3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The series had previously been broadcast by the [[Seven Network]], from 1963 to 1996 and from 2007 to 2014,&lt;ref name="Seven"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mediaspy.org/2013/01/15/seven-extends-v8-supercars-television-deal/ | title=Seven extends V8 Supercars television deal | last=Washbrook | first=Cyril | work=Media Spy | date=15 January 2013 | accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Network Ten and Fox Sports from 1997 to 2006 and from 2015 onwards,&lt;ref name="C10"/&gt; During the years of Network Ten and Fox Sports continued to broadcast the series once a year for the [[Melbourne 400]] championship races, which are a support category at the Formula One Rolex Australian Grand Prix, which was broadcast by Ten and Fox Sports. Previously when the [[Nine Network]] held the Formula One Rolex Australian Grand Prix broadcast rights in Australia, they would broadcast the Supercars support races at the Formula One Rolex Australian Grand Prix. All support category races were tied up with the Formula One Rolex Australian Grand Prix broadcast rights as a package.

Ten's television series ''[[RPM (TV series)|RPM]]'', which has aired from 1997 to 2008, in 2011 and from 2015 onwards, has covered Supercars, alongside other motorsports. From 2007 to 2014, Seven broadcast a weekly 25-minute show titled ''[[V8Xtra]]'' on non-racing weekends. The dedicated Supercars program covered news and feature items relating to the series. Since 2015, Fox Sports has broadcast a similar show, ''[[Inside Supercars]]'', a weekly one-hour long program featuring a panel led by Rust and Mark Skaife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.v8supercars.com.au/news/championship/inside-supercars-debuts-this-evening | title=Inside Supercars debuts this evening | work=V8Supercars.com.au | date=3 March 2015 | accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Fox Sports also launched an observational show ''[[Supercars Life]]'', featuring behind the scenes footage from race weekends and features on drivers' lives away from the track. In 2018, ''Inside Supercars'' was superseded by a new show on Fox Sports, ''[[Supercars Trackside]]''. Instead of being filmed in a studio midweek, the show is filmed on the Thursday before and the Sunday after each race meeting at the circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.speedcafe.com/2018/03/01/fox-sports-enhances-supercars-tv-experience/|title=Fox Sports enhances Supercars TV experience|last=Howard|first=Tom|date=1 March 2018|publisher=Speedcafe|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The television broadcast of the Bathurst 1000 has won a [[Logie Award]] for the Most Outstanding Sports Coverage seven times, most recently for the [[2017 Bathurst 1000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supercars.com/news/championship/bathurst-coverage-takes-out-logie-award/|title=Bathurst coverage takes out Logie Award|last=Bartholomaeus|first=Stefan|date=1 July 2018|publisher=''Supercars.com''|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foxtel broadcast the [[2018 Bathurst 1000]] in [[4K resolution]], the first such broadcast in Australian sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.speedcafe.com/2018/09/19/bathurst-to-be-broadcast-in-4k-and-ad-break-free/|title=Bathurst to be broadcast in 4K and ad-break free|last=Howard|first=Tom|date=19 September 2018|publisher=Speedcafe|accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other media===
The series has its own live streaming [[pay-per-view]] service, Superview. The service, which started in 2013, currently shows all races as well as qualifying sessions. The service is not available in New Zealand and Australia due to their current broadcasting rights with [[Sky Sport (New Zealand)|Sky Sport]] and [[Fox Sports Australia|Fox Sports]].

The series has its own website, which contains information about the series, drivers, teams and events and news articles, and a radio show, V8 Insiders. News is also featured on motorsport websites such as [[Speedcafe]], [[V8X Magazine]] and Touring Car Times. A media deal with [[News Corp Australia]] has been in place since 2009.

===Video games===
{{main article|Supercars Championship in video games}}
Supercars have made several licensed appearances in [[video games]], including in [[Codemasters]]' [[TOCA Touring Car series|''V8 Supercars'' series]] in the 2000s and [[Turn 10 Studios]]' ''[[Forza (series)|Forza]]'' series in the 2010s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2891">The '''Sydney Carnival''', a.k.a. Sydney Autumn Carnival, is a major Australian [[Thoroughbred racing]] series held in [[Sydney]] in March and April each year. It consists of six weeks of racing conducted by [[Australian Turf Club]] across the city's two primary racecourses: [[Randwick Racecourse|Royal Randwick]] and [[Rosehill Gardens Racecourse|Rosehill Gardens]]. The most important races include the AAMI [[Golden Slipper Stakes]], the world's richest race for two-year-old horses,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesydneycarnival.com.au {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225022459/http://thesydneycarnival.com.au/ |date=2011-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[The BMW Stakes|BMW Stakes]], the [[Rosehill Guineas]], the [[Australian Derby]], the [[Doncaster Handicap]] and the [[Sydney Cup]]. The 2015 Sydney Autumn Carnival consists of 20 Group 1 races, and offers $26.5 million in prize money.&lt;ref&gt;http://sydneycarnival.racenet.com.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Format - "The Championships"==
Inaugurated in 2014 and dubbed "The Grand Finals of Australian Racing", The Championships is held on two days over the Easter Holiday period. The Championships have combined previous stand alone races such as the Doncaster Mile, The Australian Derby, the Queen Elizabeth Stakes and The Sydney Cup into two weekends of racing with nearly $10 million prize money on offer each Saturday. The 2015 Championships will be hosted at [[Randwick Racecourse|Royal Randwick]], known as the home of Thoroughbred racing in Sydney. Racing days are 4 and 11 April 2015.

The Championships is attempting to attract global interest in Sydney Racing, and in 2015 six international horses will be participating.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justhorseracing.com.au/news/australian-racing/overseas-horses-a-must-for-championships/275925&lt;/ref&gt; The Canterbury racetrack, after being granted federal government approval, is to be used as a quarantine training and stabling area for overseas horses.

In 2014, The [[Queen Elizabeth Stakes (ATC)|Queen Elizabeth Stakes]] prize money was raised to $4 million, becoming the richest race of the Sydney Autumn Carnival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australianturfclub.com.au/pdf/media/Media%20Release%20-%20The%20Championships.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Another iconic race is the [[Doncaster Handicap|Doncaster Mile]], which offers $3 million in prize money.

'''TheRealDeal''' was a [[dark web|darknet]] website and a part of the [[cyber-arms industry]] reported to be selling code and [[Zero-day (computing)|zero-day]] [[Exploit (computer security)|software exploits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[DeepDotWeb]]|title=Not Only Drugs: New Market Focuses On Code, 0Days &amp; Exploits|url=http://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/04/08/therealdeal-dark-net-market-for-code-0days-exploits/|accessdate=15 May 2015|date=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creators claimed in an interview with [[DeepDotWeb]] that the site was founded in direct response to the number of dark websites which have emerged during the past few years which do not actually have anything of value to sell and are just scams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winder|first1=Davey|title=Is this new zero-day dark market the real deal?|url=http://www.itpro.co.uk/security/24478/is-this-new-zero-day-dark-market-the-real-deal|accessdate=17 May 2015|date=21 Apr 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site relied on [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] and [[bitcoin]] similar to other [[darknet market]]s but requires [[Multisignature|multi-signature]] transactions. There was  speculation in the [[computer security]] community as to whether the site is a law enforcement [[sting operation]] due to apparent listing of exploits at many times below their potential market value.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;section end=allbody /&gt;

In July 2015 the website was down for 24 hours at the same time as cyber crime forum [[Darkode]] was seized by the FBI and various members arrested in '[[Operation Shrouded Horizon]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cox|first1=Joseph|title=The Mysterious Disappearance, and Reappearance, of a Dark Web Hacker Market|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-mysterious-disappearance-and-reappearance-of-a-dark-web-hacker-market|accessdate=31 July 2015|date=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 August in 2015 the site went offline for unknown reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dead Markets|url=https://www.deepdotweb.com/marketplace-directory/categories/dead-scam|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DarkNet Stats|url=https://dnstats.net/market/TheRealDeal|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1 it announced its reopening on [[DeepDotWeb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TheRealDeal: This Long-Dead Market Was Just Relaunched!|url=https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/12/01/therealdeal-this-dead-market-was-just-relaunched/|accessdate=3 December 2015|publisher=[[DeepDotWeb]]|date=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Real Deal was shut down on November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itnewsafrica.com/2017/08/cybercrime-finds-a-way-despite-dark-web-shutdowns/ [https://archive.is/2017.09.01-031647/http://www.itnewsafrica.com/2017/08/cybercrime-finds-a-way-despite-dark-web-shutdowns/ archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The adaptation garnered negative reviews: Keith Uhlich of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' writes "True to its title, this romantic-historical miniseries is more fowl than fair. CBS' two-part adaptation of Alice Hoffman's best-selling novel is a cheap, chintzy adventure." while Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' writes "Designed to play as a moving adaptation of Alice Hoffman's bestseller, ''The Dovekeepers'' is more of a wounded duck."&lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/t/the-dovekeepers/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:TheIslandPoster.jpg|right|frame|Poster for the 2000 Royal National Theatre production]]
'''''The Island''''' is a play written by [[Athol Fugard]], [[John Kani]], and [[Winston Ntshona]].

The [[apartheid]]-era drama, inspired by a true story, is set in an unnamed [[prison]] clearly based on [[South Africa]]'s notorious [[Robben Island]], where [[Nelson Mandela]] was held for twenty-seven years. It focuses on two cellmates, one whose successful appeal means that his release draws near and one who must remain in prison for many years to come. They spend their days performing futile physical labor and nights rehearsing in their cell for a performance of [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'' in front of the other prisoners. One takes the part of Antigone, who defies the laws of the state to bury her brother, and the other takes the part of her uncle Creon, who sentences her to die for her crime of conscience. The play draws parallels between Antigone's situation and the situation of black political prisoners. Tensions arise as the performance approaches, especially when one of the prisoners learns that he has won an early release and the men's deep friendship is tested. ''The Island'' bears testament to the resiliency of the human heart.

==Structure==
The play has four scenes. It opens with a lengthy mimed sequence in which John and Winston, two cell mates imprisoned on Robben Island, shovel sand in the scorching heat, dumping the sand at the feet of the other man, so that the pile of sand never diminishes. This is designed to exhaust the body and the morale of the prisoners. Later scenes include a [[play within a play]], as Winston and John perform a condensed two-person version of ''Antigone'' by Sophocles.

==History==
The play was first performed in Cape Town, at a theatre called [[Space Theatre (Cape Town)|The Space]], in July 1973. In order to evade the draconian censorship in South Africa at the time (plays dealing with prison conditions, etc., were prohibited), the play premiered under the title, ''Die Hodoshe Span''. It was next staged at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in [[London]], with John Kani and Winston Ntshona portraying John and Winston respectively. The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, presented in [[repertory]] with ''[[Sizwe Banzi Is Dead]]'', opened on November 24, 1974 at the [[Edison Theatre]], where it ran for 52 performances.

In an unusual move, Kani and Ntshona were named co-[[Tony Award]] nominees (and eventual co-winners) for Best Actor in a Play for both ''The Island'' and ''Sizwe Banzi Is Dead''.

Over the next thirty years, Kani and Ntshona periodically performed in productions of the play. Notable among them were the [[Royal National Theatre]] in 2000 [http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/?lid=1246], reported at the time as their final production, although they went on to star at the [[Old Vic]] in 2002 [http://www.onlinereviewlondon.com/reviews/island.html] and the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] in 2004 [http://www.showbusinessweekly.com/archive/222/island.shtml].

==Plot==
John and Winston share a prison cell on an unnamed Island. After another day of hard labor and having been forced to run while shackled and then beaten, they return to their cell. They tend each other's wounds, share memories of times at the beach and rehearse for the prisoner-performed concert which is imminent. They are going to perform a scene from an abridged version of ''Antigone'' by Sophocles. John will play Creon and Winston will play Antigone.

When he sees himself in his costume, Winston tries to pull out of playing a female role, fearing he will be humiliated. John is called to the governor's office. He returns with news that his appeal was successful and his ten-year sentence has been commuted to three years: he will be free in three months. Winston is happy for him. As they imagine what leaving prison and returning home will be like, Winston begins to unravel. He doubts why he ever made a stand against the regime, why he even exists. Having said it, he experiences a catharsis, and accepts that he must endure.

The final scene is their performance of ''Antigone''. After John-as-Creon sentences Winston-as-Antigone to be walled up in a cave for having defied him and done her duty towards her dead brother, Winston pulls off Antigone's wig and yells "Gods of Our Fathers! My Land! My Home! Time waits no longer. I go now to my living death, because I honored those things to which honor belongs". The final image is of John and Winston, chained together once more, running hard as the siren wails.

==Characters==
* John has been imprisoned for belonging to a banned organization.
* Winston, we find out later was imprisoned for burning his passbook in front of the police. This was a serious crime, as the passbook was used to segregate and control the South African people.
* Hodoshe, an [[unseen character]]: he is referred to and represented by the sound of a prison whistle. He is a symbol of the apartheid state and racist rule. The literal translation for Hodoshe is "carrion fly" (as mentioned in the play), a large green fly.

==Themes==
* [[Racial segregation]]
* Obedience and [[civil disobedience]]
* Brotherhood
* Freedom – bodily freedom, freedom of conscience and freedom of the mind
* Memory, imagination, and the transformative power of performance

==Language==
Although the play is in English, [[Afrikaans]] and [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] words are spoken as well.

==Broadway awards and nominations==
* Tony Award for Best Play (co-nominee with ''Sizwe Banzi'')
* Tony Award for Best Actor in Play (Kani and Ntshona, '''winners''')
* Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play (nominee)
* [[Drama Desk Award]] for Outstanding Actor in a Play (Kani and Ntshona, co-nominees)
* Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Director of a Play (nominee)
* Drama Desk Award for Outstanding New Foreign Play (co-nominee with ''Sizwe Banzi'')

'''Yahoo! GeoCities''' is a soon-to-be defunct [[web hosting service]]. It was founded in November 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jan/29/business/fi-2730|title=Yahoo to Buy GeoCities for $3.9 Billion in Stock - latimes|work=[[LA Times]]|date=1999-01-29|accessdate=2016-03-14|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160315054132/http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jan/29/business/fi-2730|archivedate=2016-03-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[David Bohnett]] and [[John Rezner]], and was called '''Beverly Hills Internet''' ('''BHI''') for a very short time before being named '''GeoCities'''.&lt;ref name=podcast&gt;McCullough, Brian.

''Internet History Podcast''. May 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 28, 1999, GeoCities was acquired by [[Yahoo!]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yhoo.client.shareholder.com/press/timeline.cfm |title=Yahoo!

In its original form, site users selected a "city" in which to place their [[web page]]s. The "cities" were named after real cities or regions according to their content—for example, [[computer]]-related sites were placed in "SiliconValley" and those dealing with [[entertainment]] were assigned to "Hollywood"—hence the name of the site. Shortly after its acquisition by [[Yahoo!]], this practice was abandoned in favor of using the Yahoo! member names in the URLs.

In April 2009, approximately ten years after Yahoo! bought GeoCities,&lt;ref name="cnn1999"/&gt; the company announced that it would shut down the United States GeoCities service on October 26, 2009.&lt;ref name="PCMagGeo"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2350024,00.asp| title=Yahoo Sets the Date of GeoCities' Death| last=Fox| first=Geoff| date=2009-07-10| publisher=PCMag.com| accessdate=2010-11-05| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831064914/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2350024,00.asp| archivedate=2010-08-31| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TechCrunch"&gt;{{cite web | first=Leena | last=Rao | title=Yahoo Quietly Pulls The Plug On GeoCities | url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/04/23/yahoo-quietly-pulls-the-plug-on-geocities/ | date=2009-04-23 | work=[[TechCrunch]] | accessdate=2009-04-30 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20090501112554/https://techcrunch.com/2009/04/23/yahoo-quietly-pulls-the-plug-on-geocities/ | archivedate=2009-05-01 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/10/geocities-closing.html |title=GeoCities' time has expired, Yahoo closing the site today |first=Mark |last=Millian |publisher=LA Times (blog) |date=2009-10-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221025310/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/10/geocities-closing.html |archivedate=2012-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were at least 38 million user-built pages on GeoCities before it was shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shechmeister |first=Matthew |url=https://www.wired.com/rawfile/2009/11/geocities |title=Ghost Pages: A Wired.com Farewell to GeoCities |publisher=Wired.com |date=2009-11-03 |accessdate=2012-02-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115003059/http://www.wired.com/rawfile/2009/11/geocities |archivedate=2012-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The GeoCities Japan version of the service will shut down at the end of March 2019.&lt;ref name="GeocitiesJ"/&gt;

== Neighborhoods ==
In 1996, GeoCities had 29 "neighborhoods," which had groupings of content created by the "homesteaders" (GeoCities users).&lt;ref name="Neighborhoods1996"&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/19961219233921/http://www.geocities.com/homestead/homedir.html 29 Neighborhoods]."

== GeoCities Marketplace ==
In 1999, GeoCities had an online commercial presence with GeoCities Marketplace. It included the GeoStore, which sold GeoCities-branded merchandise. Users cashed in GeoPoints in the store.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19990209074656/http://www.geocities.com/marketplace/ "GeoCities Marketplace"]. ''GeoCities''. February 9, 1999. Retrieved on May 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== GeoCities Japan ==
Prior to the takeover by [[Yahoo!]], GeoCities had a Japanese subsidiary, GeoCities Japan. GeoCities Japan was headquartered in the Nihonbashi Hakozaki Building in the [[Nihonbashi]] area of [[Chūō, Tokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/19990221225412/http://www.geocities.co.jp/features/recruit/ スタッフ募集]."

As of February 10, 2016, GeoCities Japan was still online, with no signs of upcoming closure. Its member sites are still accessible, and it is still accepting new account registrations, but now all services are only available in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].&lt;ref name="GeocitiesJ"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://info-geocities.yahoo.co.jp/close/index.html |title=Yahoo!ジオシティーズ |publisher=Geocities.yahoo.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2018-10-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224041126/http://geocities.yahoo.co.jp/ |archivedate=2012-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:VeryFirstGeologo.png|thumb|The first GeoCities logo (1995&amp;ndash;1998)]]

GeoCities began in mid-1995 as BHI, which stood for Beverly Hills Internet, a small Web hosting and development company in Southern California.&lt;ref name=Business_Wire&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Beverly+Hills+Internet,+builder+of+interactive+cyber+cities,+launches...-a017190114 |title=Beverly Hills Internet, builder of interactive cyber cities, launches 4 more virtual communities linked to real places; SiliconValley, CapitolHill, Paris and Tokyo offer free homesteads to residents of BHI's 'GeoCities' |work=Business Wire |date=July 5, 1995 |accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company created its own [[Web directory]], organized thematically in six "neighborhoods". The neighborhoods included "Colosseum," "Hollywood," "RodeoDrive," "SunsetStrip," "WallStreet," and "WestHollywood". In mid-1995, the company decided to offer users (thereafter known as "Homesteaders") the ability to develop free home pages within those neighborhoods. During the sign-up process, new members chose to which neighborhood they wanted to belong. This neighborhood became part of the member's Web address along with a sequentially assigned "street address" number to make the URL unique (for example, &lt;nowiki&gt;"www.geocities.com/RodeoDrive/number"&lt;/nowiki&gt;). Chat, bulletin boards, and other elements of "community" were added soon after, helping foster rapid growth. On July 5, 1995 GeoCities added additional cities, including "CapitolHill," "Paris," "SiliconValley," and "Tokyo."&lt;ref name=Business_Wire/&gt; By December 1995, the company, which now had a total of 14 neighborhoods, was signing up thousands of Homesteaders a day and getting over six million monthly page views. GeoCities never enforced neighborhood specific content; for example, a "Hollywood" homesteader could be nothing but a college student's home page, which would be more appropriate for another neighborhood. The company decided to focus on building membership and community, and on December 15, 1995, BHI became known as GeoCities after having also been called Geopages.&lt;ref name=AllBusiness&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/marketing-advertising/marketing-advertising/7191644-1.html "Beverly Hills Internet, Builder of Web Communities, Changes Name to GeoCities; Monthly Page."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211170054/http://www.allbusiness.com/marketing-advertising/marketing-advertising/7191644-1.html |date=2008-12-11 }} ''Business Wire''.

[[File:Geocitiesoriginallogo.png|thumb|The second and last GeoCities logo of 1998&amp;ndash;1999]]
Over time, many companies, including [[Yahoo!]], invested extensively in GeoCities and, with the introduction of paid premium services, the site continued to grow. In May 1997, GeoCities introduced [[advertising|advertisements]] on its pages. Despite negative reaction from users, GeoCities continued to grow. By June 1997, GeoCities was the fifth most popular site on the Web, and by October of that year the company had signed up its millionth Homesteader.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

In June 1998, in an effort to increase brand awareness, GeoCities introduced a [[watermark]] to user Web pages. The watermark, much like an [[Digital on-screen graphic|onscreen graphic]] on some television channels, was a transparent floating [[GIF]] which used JavaScript to stay on the bottom right side of the browser screen. Many users felt the watermark interfered with the design of their Web site and threatened to move their Web pages elsewhere. The implementation of the watermark preceded the widespread adoption of [[CSS]] and standardized [[Document Object Model|DOM]] and had cross-browser issues. However, GeoCities said in a press release that feedback regarding the watermark had been overwhelmingly positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company went public in August 1998, listing on the [[NASDAQ]] exchange with the code GCTY. The [[Initial public offering|IPO]] price was $17, rising rapidly after launch to a peak of over $100. By 1999 GeoCities was the third-most visited Web site on the World Wide Web, behind [[AOL]] and [[Yahoo!]].&lt;ref name="MarshallVNU"&gt;Marshall, Rosalie.

Yahoo! quickly reversed its decision.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt; In July 1999, Yahoo! switched from neighborhoods and street address [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s for homesteaders to "vanity" URLs through members' sign-up names to Yahoo! (&lt;nowiki&gt;"www.geocities.com/membername"&lt;/nowiki&gt;). This service was previously offered only as a premium.

In 2001, amid speculation by analysts that GeoCities was not yet profitable (it having declared an $8 million loss for the final quarter of 1998), Yahoo! introduced a for-fee premium hosting service at GeoCities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Rupert Goodwins, the editor of ''[[ZDNet]]'', perceived the closure of GeoCities as an end of an era; he described GeoCities as "the first proof that you could have something really popular and still not make any money on the internet."&lt;ref name="BBCPullPlug"/&gt; Vijay Mukhi, an internet and cyber security expert quoted in the ''[[Business Standard]]'', criticized Yahoo's handling of GeoCities; Mukhi described GeoCities as "a lost opportunity for Yahoo!

== Archiving GeoCities websites ==
Shortly after the GeoCities closing announcement, the [[Internet Archive]] announced a project to archive GeoCities pages, stating "GeoCities has been an important outlet for personal expression on the Web for almost 15 years."

== Selected traffic statistics ==
The domain ''geocities.com'' attracted at least 177 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a [[Compete.com]] study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=United States |url=http://siteanalytics.compete.com/geocities.com?metric=uv |title=GeoCities attracts almost 180m visitors online yearly |publisher=Siteanalytics.compete.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220113602/http://siteanalytics.compete.com/geocities.com/?metric=uv |archivedate=2011-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ComScore stated that the GeoCities had 18.9 million unique visitors from the U.S. in March 2006. In March 2008 GeoCities had 15.1 million unique U.S. visitors. In March 2009 GeoCities had 11.5 million unique visitors, a 24% decline from March 2008.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch"/&gt;

== Litigation ==
In 1999, a complaint was instituted against GeoCities stating that the corporation violated the provisions of the [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] under {{UnitedStatesCode|15|45}}, which states in relevant part, "Unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, are hereby declared unlawful." The FTC found that GeoCities was engaged in deceptive acts and practices in contravention to their stated privacy act. Subsequently, a consent order was entered into which prohibits GeoCities from misrepresenting the purpose for which it collects and/or uses personal identifying information from consumers. A copy of the complaint and order can be found at [https://web.archive.org/web/20090511204518/http://www.ftc.gov/os/decisions/docs/Volume127.pdf#page=94 127 F.T.C. 94] (page 94).&lt;ref name=ftc127&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/os/decisions/docs/Volume127.pdf#page=94 FTC.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511204518/http://www.ftc.gov/os/decisions/docs/Volume127.pdf |date=2009-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The litigation came about in this way: GeoCities provided free home pages and e-mail address to children and adults who provided personally identifying and demographic information when they registered for the Web site. At the time of the complaint, GeoCities had more than 1.8 million members who were "homesteaders." GeoCities illegally permitted third-party advertisers to promote products targeted to GeoCities' 1.8 million users, by using [[personally identifiable information]] obtained in the registration process. These acts and practices affected "commerce" as defined in Section 4 of the Federal Trade Commission.&lt;ref name=ftc127/&gt;

The problem GeoCities faced was that it placed a privacy statement on its New Member Application Form and on its Web site promising that it would never give personally identifying information to anyone without the user's permission. GeoCities sold personal information to third parties who used the information for purposes other than those for which members gave permission.&lt;ref name=ftc127/&gt;

It was ordered that GeoCities would not make any misrepresentation, in any manner about its collection or use of personal identifying information, including what information will be disclosed to third parties. GeoCities was not allowed to collect personal identifying information from any child if GeoCities had actual knowledge that the child did not have his parents' permission to provide the information.&lt;ref name=ftc127/&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival'''|ゆうばり国際ファンタスティック映画祭|Yūbari kokusai fantasutikku eiga sai}}, also sometimes called YIFFF, is held in a resort-like environment in the small town of [[Yūbari, Hokkaidō|Yūbari]] on the northernmost Japanese island of [[Hokkaidō]]. From 1990 to 1999, the festival was known as the Yubari International Fantastic Adventure Film Festival.&lt;ref name="info"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223234307/http://yubarifanta.com/index_pc.php?ct=information.php&amp;langue=21002|archivedate=2012-02-23|url=http://yubarifanta.com/index_pc.php?ct=information.php&amp;langue=21002|title=Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival Information|publisher=[yubarifanta.com]|accessdate=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1990, the last coal mine in the Hokkaidō mining town of Yūbari having closed, the city leaders were looking for a way to revitalize the local economy. This was the beginning of the Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival.&lt;ref name="webjapan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/trends/arts/art050113.html|title=ACTING LOCAL|publisher=[web-japan.org]|date=January 13, 2005|accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival was divided into two main programs, a prestigious international competition for young directors, and an Off Theatre program for mostly Japanese amateur, independent and first-time directors. The first year in 1990 had as a special guest, actor [[Jon Voight]] and his daughter, a young starlet named [[Angelina Jolie]]. In 1993, [[Quentin Tarantino]] was at the festival and wrote part of the screenplay for ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'' in his hotel room. Some years later, he paid homage to the town in the name of a character in ''[[Kill Bill: Volume 1]]'', [[List of Kill Bill characters#Gogo Yubari|"Gogo Yubari"]].&lt;ref name="midnight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/features/go-go-yubari.shtml|title=Go! Go! Yubari|publisher=[Midnight Eye]|last=Mes|first=Tom|date=June 17, 2008|accessdate=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 the festival also had special guest stars, comedians [[Steve Martin]] and [[Martin Short]]. In 2004 the festival drew a record audience of 27,000.&lt;ref name="webjapan"/&gt;

The festival had always been sponsored financially by the city of Yubari but the town filed for bankruptcy in 2007 and that year's festival had to be cancelled. However, the people of Yubari with the assistance of a number of sponsors were able to group together to revive the festival in 2008. The international competition section of the festival had to be dropped but the Off Theatre program for young Japanese directors was retained with the Grand Prize bringing 2 million yen (about $20,000) to the winner. The new Governor's Award was presented by the Governor of Hokkaidō. In addition to the competition section, the festival continued to screen a number of international films by promising directors.&lt;ref name="midnight"/&gt; One of the sponsors for the festival is the giant Japanese satellite broadcasting company [[SKY Perfect|SKYPerfecTV!]] which has also broadcast parts of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptvjsat.com/en/news/news_pdf/090114_Special_Sponsorship_of_Yubari.pdf|title=SKY Perfect JSAT Corporation News Release|publisher= www.sptvjsat.com/|accessdate=2009-09-18|date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scaled down 2008 festival drew more than 8800 fans and attendance increased to over 10,500 in 2009.&lt;ref name="unijapan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unijapan.org/en/festival/japan/yubari-fanta.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312043700/http://unijapan.org/en/festival/japan/yubari-fanta.html|title=Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival|archivedate=2012-03-12|accessdate=2015-11-09|publisher=[UniJapan]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
