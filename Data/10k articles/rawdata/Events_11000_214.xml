The '''1970 Arab League summit''' was held on September 27 in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] as an extraordinary [[Arab League Summit]]. The summit came in the aftermath of the bloody events of [[Black September in Jordan]], and the clashes between the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] and King [[Hussein of Jordan]]. Egyptian president [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]] succeeded in getting both King Hussein of Jordan and [[Yasser Arafat]], the chairman of the [[PLO]], to end the bloody battle between Jordanians and the [[Palestinian fedayeen]]. The summit concluded its work on September 28, hours before Nasser died.
The summit was boycotted by [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Algeria]] and [[Morocco]].

Starting in December&amp;nbsp;2016 and continuing through at least April&amp;nbsp;2017, South America has been plagued by persistent heavy rain events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://reliefweb.int/disaster/fl-2017-000014 |title= South America: Floods and Landslides - Dec 2016 |website= ReliefWeb.int |access-date= 19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple countries suffered substantial losses, with Colombia and Peru being particularly hard-hit.

Heavy rains on March&amp;nbsp;11–13, 2017, including {{convert|110|mm|in|abbr=on}} in 24&amp;nbsp;hours, caused flooding across [[Rio Grande do Sul]], killing 2 people, injuring 70, and leaving 10 others missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|agency=European Commission's Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations|publisher=ReliefWeb|date=March 13, 2017|accessdate=April 6, 2017|title= Brazil - Severe Weather (Local Media, WMO, INMET) (ECHO Daily Flash of 13 March 2017)|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/brazil/brazil-severe-weather-local-media-wmo-inmet-echo-daily-flash-13-march-2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A109s - RIAT 2012 (7545479838).jpg|thumb|Belgian army [[AgustaWestland AW109|Agusta A109]] helicopters which were the subject of the scandal]]

The '''Agusta scandal''' ({{lang-fr|Affaire Agusta}}, {{lang-nl|Agustaschandaal}}), alternatively known as the '''Agusta–Dassault Case''', was a major [[political scandal]] which occurred in [[Belgium]] during the 1990s, based on allegations that two multinational companies had used bribery to secure large [[Military acquisition|defence procurement]] contracts. The companies in question, [[Agusta]] and [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], bribed numerous political office-holders in 1988 in order to secure a large order of [[AgustaWestland AW109|Agusta A109]] helicopters and the contract for re-fitting Belgian [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]] fighter jets respectively. The scandal came to light during investigations into the death of the socialist politician [[André Cools]] in 1991 and an official enquiry was opened in 1993. Numerous senior figures in both Walloon and Flemish socialist parties were implicated, including the incumbent [[Secretary General of NATO]] [[Willy Claes]] who was forced to resign.

The Agusta scandal was the first of a series of highly publicised scandals in Belgium. It was followed by the revelations about the "[[Murder of Karel Van Noppen|Hormone Mafia]]", the [[Dioxin affair]], and the [[Marc Dutroux#Allegations of cover-up|Dutroux affair]].

==History==
===Investigation and exposure===
The investigation into the purchase was started by the investigative team looking into the 1991 assassination of [[André Cools]], a politician of the Francophone ''[[Parti Socialiste (Belgium)|Parti Socialiste]]'' (PS) and former [[Deputy prime minister|Deputy Prime Minister]], when it turned out that Cools had knowledge about the Agusta deal. An official investigation into the deal was started in January 1993, by judge [[Véronique Ancia]], when a [[search warrant]] was issued for Agusta and its lobbyist [[Georges Cywie]].

In January 1994, the [[Senate (Belgium)|Belgian Senate]] removed the [[Sovereign immunity|immunity]] on the [[Minister-President of Wallonia]], [[Guy Spitaels]], and the minister {{Interlanguage link multi|Guy Mathot|fr}}, both from the PS, and members of the [[Walloon Government]].

[[Guy Coëme]], Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transportation for the PS resigned that same month. [[Frank Vandenbroucke (politician)|Frank Vandenbroucke]], Minister of Foreign Affairs in the [[Belgian federal government|Federal Government]] for the Flemish ''[[Socialistische Partij Anders|Socialistische Partij]]'' (SP), resigned from his post in March 1994. [[Willy Claes]], member of the SP and [[Secretary General of NATO]], resigned on 20 October 1995.

===Prosecution===
A criminal trial was handled by the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]], which is responsible for cases involving minister in function. The public [[prosecutor]] was {{Interlanguage link multi|Eliane Liekendael|nl}}. The court had most of its verdicts ready on 23 December 1998. Willy Claes received a three-year probationary sentence and a five-year prohibition on running for public office. Guy Coëme and Guy Spitaels both received three-year probationary sentences with a five-year prohibition on running for public office. [[Serge Dassault]], of the Dassault company, received an 18-month probationary sentence for [[bribery]]. 

In total, Agusta and Dassault paid more than 160 million [[Belgian franc|francs]] (about 4 million [[euro]]s) to the ''Parti Socialiste'' and ''Socialistische Partij'' in bribes.

The ''Parti Socialiste'' had to return 49 million francs in bribes, the ''Socialistische Partij'' 111 million francs. Claes, Coëme, Delanghe, Hermanus, Mangé, Puelinckx, Spitaels and Wallyn were also barred from running for political office, or working in the civil service, for five years.

==European Court of Human Rights==
After the verdicts were handed down, many of the convicted parties applied to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) to get the verdicts revoked, because the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]] in Belgium does not allow for an appeal process, which would have been in violation of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].

On 2 June 2005, the ECHR judged that in the case of the two ministers, Willy Claes and Guy Coëme, both men were given a lawful trial at the Court of Cassation. The trial of the five others who applied to the ECHR, Dassault, Hermanus, Delanghe, Puelinckx and Wallyn, at the Court of Cassation, was found to have contravened the European Convention on Human Rights, but their verdicts would stand nonetheless.

'''Anzac Day''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|z|æ|k}}) is a national day of remembrance in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] that broadly commemorates all Australians and New Zealanders "who served and died in all wars, conflicts, and peacekeeping operations" and "the contribution and suffering of all those who have served".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ANZAC Day|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/commemoration/anzac/|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=24 April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501085852/http://www.awm.gov.au/commemoration/anzac/|archivedate=1 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anzac Day Today|url=http://www.anzac.govt.nz/today/index.html|work=Anzac.govt.nz|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=22 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427001029/http://www.anzac.govt.nz/today/index.html|archivedate=27 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Observed on 25 April each year, Anzac Day was originally devised to honour the members of the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZAC) who fought at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] during [[World War I]].

==History==
Anzac Day marks the anniversary of the first campaign that led to major casualties for Australian and New Zealand forces during the First World War.  The acronym ANZAC stands for [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]], whose soldiers were known as Anzacs. Anzac Day remains one of the most important national occasions of both Australia and New Zealand;&lt;ref name=awmtradition&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/commemoration/anzac/anzac_tradition.asp|title=The ANZAC Day tradition|publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]]|accessdate=2 May 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501163212/http://www.awm.gov.au/commemoration/anzac/anzac_tradition.asp|archivedate=1 May 2008|deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AWM tradition"/&gt; however, the ceremonies and their meanings have changed significantly since 1915. According to Dr Martin Crotty, an historian at the [[University of Queensland]], Anzac commemorations have “suited political purposes right from 1916 when the first Anzac Day march was held in London and Australia, which were very much around trying to get more people to sign up to the war in 1916-1918.”&lt;ref name=Ausgeog/&gt;
===Gallipoli campaign, 1915===
{{main article|Gallipoli Campaign}}
In 1915, Australian and New Zealand soldiers formed part of an [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] expedition that set out to capture the [[Gallipoli]] Peninsula to open the way to the [[Black Sea]] for the Allied navies. The objective was to capture [[Constantinople]], the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which was an ally of [[German Empire|Germany]] during the war. The ANZAC force landed at Gallipoli on 25 April, meeting fierce resistance from the Ottoman Army commanded by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]] (later known as Atatürk).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gallipoli: The Fatal Shore|last=Broadbent|first=Harvey|authorlink=Harvey Broadbent|publisher=Viking/Penguin|location=Camberwell, VIC|year=2005|isbn=978-0-670-04085-8|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; What had been planned as a bold strike to knock the Ottomans out of the war quickly became a stalemate, and the campaign dragged on for eight months. At the end of 1915, the Allied forces were evacuated after both sides had suffered heavy casualties and endured great hardships. The Allied [[Gallipoli Campaign#Casualties|deaths]] totalled over 56,000, including 8,709 from Australia and 2,721 from New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dva.gov.au/news_archive/Documents/The%20Gallipoli%20Campaign.pdf|title=ANZAC Day 2010 – The Gallipoli Campaign|publisher=Australian Department of Veterans' Affairs|ref=CITEREFDepartment of Veterans Affairs|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313050857/http://www.dva.gov.au/news_archive/Documents/The%20Gallipoli%20Campaign.pdf|archivedate=13 March 2013|accessdate=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/interactive/gallipoli-casualties-country|title=Gallipoli Casualties by Country|date=1 March 2016|website=NZ History|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=15 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202035843/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/interactive/gallipoli-casualties-country|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; News of the landing at Gallipoli made a profound impact on Australians and New Zealanders at home and 25 April quickly became the day on which they remembered the sacrifice of those who had died in the war.

Though the Gallipoli campaign failed to achieve its military objectives of capturing Constantinople and knocking the Ottoman Empire out of the war, the actions of the Australian and New Zealand troops during the campaign bequeathed an intangible but powerful legacy. The creation of what became known as an "[[Anzac legend]]" became an important part of the national identity in both countries. This has shaped the way their citizens have viewed both their past and their understanding of the present. The heroism of the soldiers in the failed Gallipoli campaign made their sacrifices iconic in New Zealand memory, and is often credited with securing the psychological independence of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharpe|first1=Maureen|title=Anzac Day in New Zealand, 1916–1939|journal=The New Zealand Journal of History|date=1981|volume=15|issue=2|pages=97–114|url=http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/document.php?wid=1238&amp;action=null|accessdate=25 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325201650/http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/document.php?wid=1238&amp;action=null|archivedate=25 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harvey|first1=Eveline|title=How the Herald reported the Gallipoli landings|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10505785|accessdate=25 March 2017|publisher=The New Zealand Herald|date=23 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===From 1915 to World War II===
On 30 April 1915, when the first news of the landing reached New Zealand, a half-day holiday was declared and impromptu services were held.&lt;ref name="NZbeginnings"&gt;[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/first-anzac-days "The making of Anzac Day"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205001453/http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/first-anzac-days|date=5 February 2016 }}, New Zealand History online – Nga korero aipurangi o Aotearoa, History Group, Ministry for Culture and Heritage, Wellington, New Zealand.

[[Adelaide]], South Australia was the site of Australia's first built memorial to the Gallipoli landing, unveiled by Governor-General Sir [[Ronald Munro Ferguson]] on "[[Wattle Day]]", 7 September 1915, just over four months after the first landings. The monument was originally the centrepiece of the Wattle Day League's Gallipoli Memorial Wattle Grove on Sir Lewis Cohen Avenue in the South Parklands. The original native pines and remnant seedlings of the original wattles still grow in "Wattle Grove", but in 1940 the Adelaide City Council moved the monument and its surrounding pergola a short distance away to Lundie Gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adelaidia.sa.gov.au/things/dardanelles-memorial|title=Dardanelles Memorial &amp;#124; Adelaidia|publisher=Adelaidia.sa.gov.au|date=28 December 2013|accessdate=17 February 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217085533/http://adelaidia.sa.gov.au/things/dardanelles-memorial|archivedate=17 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in South Australia, [[Labour Day|Eight Hour Day]], 13 October 1915, was renamed "Anzac Day" and a carnival was organised to raise money for the Wounded Soldiers Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Register|date=27 August 1915|p=6|title=Anzac Day|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/59420501|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823163759/http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/59420501|archivedate=23 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Adelaide Advertiser|date=12 October 1915|p=6|title=ANZAC Day|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/5483531|access-date=30 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230172249/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/5483531|archivedate=30 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Anzac Day" was chosen through a competition, won by Robert Wheeler, a draper of Prospect.&lt;ref name=Sydney&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/the_beginnings_of_anzac_day_commemorations_in_sydney|title=The beginnings of Anzac Day commemorations in Sydney|last=Radford|first=Neil|date=2014|access-date=24 November 2018|archive-date=23 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181124010621/https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/the_beginnings_of_anzac_day_commemorations_in_sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melbourne]] observed an Anzac Remembrance Day on 17 December 1915.&lt;ref name=Sydney/&gt;

In Queensland on 10 January 1916 Canon [[David John Garland]] was appointed the honorary secretary of the Anzac Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland (ADCCQ) at a public meeting which endorsed 25 April as the date to be promoted as "Anzac Day” in 1916 and ever after. Devoted to the cause of a non-denominational commemoration that could be attended by the whole of Australian society, Garland worked amicably across all denominational divides, creating the framework for Anzac Day commemorative services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.garlandmemorial.com/about-garland/|title = The "Architect" of Anzac Day|access-date=17 February 2016|publisher=Canon Garland Memorial Society|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160301081344/http://www.garlandmemorial.com/about-garland/|archivedate = 1 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garland is specifically credited with initiating the Anzac Day march, the wreath-laying ceremonies at memorials and the special church services, the two minutes silence, and the luncheon for returned soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Garland, David John (1864–1939)|url = http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/garland-david-john-6278|publisher = National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location = Canberra|first = Wendy M.|last = Mansfield|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304210643/http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/garland-david-john-6278|archivedate = 4 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garland intended the silence to be used in lieu of a prayer to allow the Anzac Day service to be universally attended, allowing attendees to make a silent prayer or remembrance in accordance with their own beliefs. He particularly feared that the universality of the ceremony would fall victim to religious sectarian disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Anzac Day Silence, Religion and Garland|url = http://stumblingpast.com/2014/04/25/the-anzac-day-silence-religion-and-garland/|website = Stumbling Through the Past|access-date = 17 February 2016|last = perkinsy|deadurl=no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305144827/http://stumblingpast.com/2014/04/25/the-anzac-day-silence-religion-and-garland/|archivedate = 5 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt, General [[John Monash]] paraded the troops on Anzac Day 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minister.dva.gov.au/media_releases/2016/may/va037.htm|title=Statement on Anzac Commemorations in Australia and Overseas|author=The Hon.

For the remaining years of the war, Anzac Day was used as an occasion for patriotic rallies and recruiting campaigns, and marches of serving members of the AIF were held in most cities. From 1916 onwards, in both Australia and New Zealand, Anzac memorials were held on or about 25 April, mainly organised by returned servicemen and school children in cooperation with local authorities.&lt;ref name="AWM tradition"/&gt; Early morning services were solemn, with a  more upbeat tone set for honouring returned soldiers during afternoon activities.&lt;ref name=Ausgeog/&gt;

Australian troops did not return to great victory parades at the end of the war. This was partly because their arrival home depended on available shipping, but also because of the influenza epidemic of 1919, which prevented people assembling in large numbers. The 1919 Sydney parade was cancelled as a result, but a public commemorative service was held in [[the Domain, Sydney|the Domain]], where participants were required to wear masks and stand three feet apart.&lt;ref name=Sydney/&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Anzac Day was gazetted as a public holiday in New Zealand in 1920, through the [[Anzac Day Act (New Zealand)|Anzac Day Act]], after lobbying by the [[Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association|New Zealand Returned Services' Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsa.org.nz/remem/rsa_hist_90years.html#1 |title=RSA – Remembrance – RSA History – RSA: Ninety Years of Service&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |publisher=RSA (Returned Soldiers' Association) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308204426/http://www.rsa.org.nz/remem/rsa_hist_90years.html |archivedate=8 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the RSA.&lt;ref name="NZholiday"&gt;[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/anzac-day-1920-45 A sacred holiday – Anzac Day] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205001555/http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/anzac-day-1920-45 |date=5 February 2016 }}, New Zealand History online – Nga korero aipurangi o Aotearoa, History Group, Ministry for Culture and Heritage, Wellington, New Zealand.

In Australia at the 1921 State Premiers' Conference, it was decided that Anzac Day would be observed on 25 April each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historychannel.com.au/articles/the-first-anzac-day-in-1916/|title=The First Anzac Day in 1916|access-date=23 November 2018|publisher=Foxtel History Channel|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123062018/https://www.historychannel.com.au/articles/the-first-anzac-day-in-1916/|archive-date=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not observed uniformly in all the states until 1922 when the States were invited to co-operate with the Commonwealth in observing the day, and an invitation was telegraphed to the various religious bodies suggesting that memorial services be held in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/papers/govpub/VPARL1999-2002No189.pdf|title=ANZAC: Parliamentary review of Anzac Day laws|author=Parliament of Victoria.

In the early 1920s returned soldiers mostly commemorated Anzac Day informally, primarily as a means of keeping in contact with each other. But as time passed and they inevitably began to drift apart, the ex-soldiers perceived a need for an institutionalised reunion.&lt;ref name=Sydney/&gt; During the late 1920s, Anzac Day became established as a National Day of Commemoration for the 60,000 Australians and 18,000 New Zealanders who died during the war. The first year in which all the Australian states observed some form of public holiday together on Anzac Day was 1927.&lt;ref name=Ausgeog&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/on-this-day/2017/04/evolution-of-anzac-day/|title=The evolution of Anzac Day from 1915 until today|last=Khan|first=Joanna|date=24 April 2017|access-date=24 November 2018|archive-date=23 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123120857/https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/on-this-day/2017/04/evolution-of-anzac-day/|website=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1930s, all the rituals now associated with the day—dawn vigils, marches, memorial services, reunions, [[two-up]] games—became part of Australian Anzac Day culture.&lt;ref name="AWM tradition"/&gt; New Zealand commemorations also adopted many of these rituals, with the dawn service being introduced from Australia in 1939.&lt;ref name="NZholiday" /&gt;

===Changes after World War II===
With the coming of the Second World War, Anzac Day became a day on which to commemorate the lives of Australians and New Zealanders lost in that war as well and in subsequent wars. The meaning of the day has been further broadened to include those killed in all the military operations in which the countries have been involved. Anzac Day was first commemorated at the [[Australian War Memorial]] in 1942, but, due to government orders preventing large public gatherings in case of [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] air attack, it was a small affair and was neither a march nor a memorial service. Anzac Day has been annually commemorated at the Australian War Memorial ever since.&lt;ref name=awmtradition/&gt;&lt;ref name="AWM tradition"/&gt; In New Zealand, Anzac Day saw a surge in popularity immediately after World War II.&lt;ref name=Robinson/&gt;

===Popularity sinks===

By the 1950s many New Zealanders had become antagonistic or indifferent towards the day. Much of this was linked to the legal ban on commerce on Anzac Day, and the banning by many local authorities of sports events and other entertainment on the day. Annoyance was particularly pronounced in 1953 and 1959, when Anzac Day fell on a Saturday. There was widespread public debate on the issue, with some people calling for the public holiday to be moved to the nearest Sunday or abolished altogether. In 1966 a new [[Anzac Day Act (New Zealand)|Anzac Day Act]] was passed, allowing sport and entertainment in the afternoon.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;Helen Robinson, 'Lest we Forget? The Fading of New Zealand War Commemorations, 1946–1966', ''New Zealand Journal of History'', 44, 1 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

During and after Australia's involvement in the [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Vietnam War]] (1962-1975), interest in Anzac Day reached its lowest point in Australia. Anti-war protesters used Anzac Day events as a platform to voice opposition to conscription and Australia's military involvement in general; in the following 20 years, the relevance of Australia's war connection with the British Empire was brought into question.&lt;ref name=Ausgeog/&gt; On 26 April 1975 ''[[The Australian (newspaper)|The Australian]]'' newspaper covered the passing of Anzac Day in a single story.&lt;ref name=Editorial&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,18916129-601,00.html The Anzac Spirit, ''The Australian'', 25 April 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720144815/http://theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,18916129-601,00.html |date=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests against the [[Vietnam War]] were common Anzac Day occurrences during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slsa.sa.gov.au/saatwar/commemoration.htm State Library of South Australia, "Commemoration"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410051635/http://www.slsa.sa.gov.au/saatwar/commemoration.htm |date=10 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Ryan, [http://www.defence.gov.au/Army/AHU/books_articles/ConferencePapers/The_Australian_Army_Vietnam_War_Ryan.htm "The Australian Army and the Vietnam War in Retrospect"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516112947/http://www.defence.gov.au/army/ahu/books_articles/ConferencePapers/The_Australian_Army_Vietnam_War_Ryan.htm |date=16 May 2008 }}, Australian Department of Defence&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, two members of the left-wing Progressive Youth Movement in [[Christchurch]] staged a minor protest at the Anzac Day ceremony, laying a wreath protesting against the [[Vietnam War]].

However, since the late 1980s and especially the 1990s, interest in and attendance at Anzac Day has grown. On 25 April 1990, [[Bob Hawke]] became the first Australian politician to visit Gallipoli, and he also decided that government would pay to take Anzac veterans to Gallipoli for the 75th anniversary of the dawn landing. This is seen by historians as a major milestone in the recovery of Anzac Day. [[John Howard]] (PM 1996-2007) was a huge proponent of Anzac Day commemorations, and visited Gallipoli on 25 April in both 2000 and 2005.&lt;ref name=Ausgeog/&gt;&lt;ref name=Waterson&gt;DB Waterson, [http://www.abc.net.au/news/indepth/anzac/waterson.htm Anzac Day: Australia's National Day, ''ABC News Online''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427075711/http://www.abc.net.au/news/indepth/anzac/waterson.htm |date=27 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australians and New Zealanders recognise 25 April as a ceremonial occasion to reflect on the cost of war and to remember those who fought and lost their lives for their country. Commemorative services and marches are held at dawn, the time of the original landing, mainly at [[war memorial]]s in cities and towns across both nations and the sites of some of Australia and New Zealand's more-recognised battles and greatest losses, such as [[Villers-Bretonneux]] in France&lt;ref name="dva.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dva.gov.au/commems_oawg/commemorations/commemorative_events/anzac_day/Pages/france.aspx |title=Anzac Day Services in France |publisher=Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs |date=5 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211203331/http://www.dva.gov.au/commems_oawg/commemorations/commemorative_events/anzac_day/Pages/france.aspx |archivedate=11 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gallipoli in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dva.gov.au/commems_oawg/commemorations/commemorative_events/anzac_day/gallipoli/Pages/index.aspx |title=Anzac Day Services Gallipoli, Turkey – 2014 |publisher=Australian Government Department of Veterans' Affairs |date=20 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207152529/http://www.dva.gov.au/commems_oawg/commemorations/commemorative_events/anzac_day/gallipoli/Pages/index.aspx |archivedate=7 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the traditions of Anzac Day is the "[[Gunfire (drink)|gunfire breakfast]]" (coffee with [[rum]] added) which occurs shortly after many dawn ceremonies, and recalls the "breakfast" taken by many soldiers before facing battle. Later in the day, ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen meet and join in marches through the major cities and many smaller centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Jack  |title=Kingdom Collision: The Movement of God's Spirit in a Time of War |year=2010 |publisher=CrossBooks |location= |edition= |isbn=1462700365 |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, female veterans were encouraged to march at the front of their sections. The "By The Left" initiative was launched following a number of reported cases where servicewomen had been challenged that they were wearing their medals on the wrong side, as people should wear their own medals on the left side of their chest, but people marching in place of their parents or other ancestors should wear that person's medals on the right side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-25/servicewomen-to-march-as-one-this-anzac-day/9692372 |title=Anzac Day: From Iraq to Australia, servicewomen to march as one |first=Camron |last=Slessor |date=25 April 2018 |work=ABC News |accessdate=1 May 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514000809/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-25/servicewomen-to-march-as-one-this-anzac-day/9692372 |archivedate=14 May 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

According to historian Dr Carolyn Holbrook of [[Deakin University]], “We reached Peak Anzac in 2015 sure, and there has been some backing off since then, but in terms of the dawn services and Anzac Day commemoration, it will remain huge for a good while yet,” says Carolyn. “There is nothing better to take its place in terms of a national mythology.”&lt;ref name=Ausgeog/&gt;

In recent years, there has been greater recognition of the often overlooked role that women, immigrants and [[Aboriginal Australians|indigenous Australians]] played in the wars, in the news and in the arts. ''Black Diggers'', which premiered at the Sydney Festival, told the stories of the Aboriginal men who enlisted, whose sacrifices were ignored, and who were quickly forgotten upon their return.&lt;ref name=Ausgeog/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://australianplays.org/script/PL-182|access-date=26 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181126075017/https://australianplays.org/script/PL-182|archive-date=26 November 2018|title=Black Diggers, by Tom Wright|website=Australianplays.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Country Arts SA's ''Aboriginal Diggers Project'' is a 3-year project (2017-2019) capturing the stories and experiences of Aboriginal servicemen and women who have served in Australia's Military from the Boer War to the present day through film, theatre and visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.countryarts.org.au/programs/aboriginal-engagement/aboriginaldiggers/|access-date=26 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181126080615/https://www.countryarts.org.au/programs/aboriginal-engagement/aboriginaldiggers/|archive-date=26 November 2018|title=Aboriginal Diggers|website=Country Arts SA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dawn service and commemoration in Australia==

===Dawn service===
[[File:Anzacday08-1-.JPG|thumb|The wreath laying at the 2008 dawn service at the Australian War Memorial at [[Hyde Park Corner]], London.]]
A dawn service was held on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] by an Australian battalion on the first anniversary of the Gallipoli landing on April 25, 1916, and historians agree that in Australia dawn services spontaneously popped up around the country to commemorate the fallen at Gallipoli in the years after this. The timing of the dawn service is based on the time that the ANZAC forces started the landing on the Gallipoli peninsula, but also has origins in a combination of military, symbolic and religious traditions. Various stories name different towns as having the first ever service in Australia, including [[Albany, Western Australia]], but no definite proof has been found to corroborate any of them. In [[Rockhampton, Queensland]] on April 26, 1916, over 600 people attended an interdenominational service that started at 6.30am. However, the dawn service held at the [[Sydney Cenotaph]] in 1928 can lay claim to being the first of a continuous tradition.&lt;ref name =ABCFF&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-24/the-anzac-day-dawn-service/6393456|title=Fact file: The origins of the Anzac dawn service|date=24 Apr 2015|access-date=23 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123005847/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-24/the-anzac-day-dawn-service/6393456|archive-date=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1931 service at the Cenotaph was the first attended by the Governor and representatives of state and federal governments, etc.&lt;ref name=Sydney/&gt;

Dawn services were originally very simple and in many cases they were restricted to veterans only, to remember and reflect among the comrades with whom they shared a special bond. Before dawn the gathered veterans would be ordered to "stand-to" and a lone bugler would play the "[[Last Post]]".  [[Two-minute silence|Two minutes of silence]] would follow, concluded with the "[[Reveille]]". In more recent times the families of veterans and the general public have been encouraged to take part in dawn services. Some of the ceremonies have also become more elaborate, incorporating hymns, prayer readings, laying of wreaths, laments and the playing of the [[Australian national anthem]], but others have retained the simple format of the dawn stand-to.&lt;ref name=awmtradition/&gt;&lt;ref name="AWM tradition"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Defence&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/Ceremonial/AnzacDayHandyHints.asp|title=Anzac Day handy hints|access-date=22 November 2018|archive-date=22 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122050247/http://www.defence.gov.au/Ceremonial/AnzacDayHandyHints.asp|author=Australian Government, Dept of Defence}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth stanza of [[Laurence Binyon]]'s poem "[[s: For the Fallen|For the Fallen]]" (known as the "[[Ode of Remembrance]]", or simply as "the Ode") is often recited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-24/history-of-the-anzac-day-ode-or-remembrance/7353860|title=Anzac Day: The Ode of Remembrance is taken from the Laurence Binyon poem For The Fallen|last=McLoughlin|first=Chris|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=24 April 2016|accessdate=23 November 2018|archive-date=23 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123112427/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-24/history-of-the-anzac-day-ode-or-remembrance/7353860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commemorative postage stamps===
[[Australia Post]] has issued stamps over the years to [[Commemorative stamp|commemorate]] Anzac Day, the first being in 1935 for the 20th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings.

The list of issued stamps includes:{{Refimprove inline|date=April 2018}}
* 1935 – 20th Anniversary (2 values) 2d Red and 1/- Black featuring the [[Cenotaph|London Cenotaph]].

During many wars, [[Australian rules football]] matches have been played overseas in places like northern Africa, Vietnam, and Iraq as a celebration of Australian culture and as a bonding exercise between soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Australian War Memorial H13624&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Australian War Memorial P00851.009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Australian War Memorial MEB0068&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern-day tradition began in 1995 and is played every year between traditional [[Australian Football League|AFL]] rivals [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] and [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]].

===Rugby League football===
{{Main article|Anzac Test|Club ANZAC Game|ANZAC Day Cup}}
From 1997, the [[Anzac Test]], a [[rugby league]] test match, has commemorated Anzac Day, though it is typically played prior to Anzac Day. The match is always played between the [[Australian national rugby league team|Australian]] and [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] national teams, and has drawn attendances of between 20,000 and 45,000 in the past. The final Anzac test occurred in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where the last ANZAC Test will be played|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/au/league/news/where-the-last-anzac-test-will-be-played/sunbm4zsiyxc14s2js9oyd9or|publisher=Sporting News|date=12 February 2017|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425115430/http://www.sportingnews.com/au/league/news/where-the-last-anzac-test-will-be-played/sunbm4zsiyxc14s2js9oyd9or|archivedate=25 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestically, matches have been played on Anzac Day since 1927 (with occasional exceptions). Since 2002, the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) has followed the lead of the Australian Football League, hosting a match between traditional rivals [[St George Illawarra Dragons]] and the [[Sydney Roosters]] each year to commemorate Anzac Day in the [[Club ANZAC Game]], although these two sides had previously met on Anzac Day several times as early as the 1970s. Since 2009, an additional Anzac Day game has been played between the [[Melbourne Storm]] and [[New Zealand Warriors]].

The number of New Zealanders attending Anzac Day events in New Zealand, and at [[Gallipoli]], is increasing. For some, the day adds weight to the idea that war is futile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzembassy.com/info.cfm?CFID=532362&amp;CFTOKEN=5832&amp;l=59&amp;p=63120&amp;s=bu&amp;c=17 The Significance of ANZAC Day], New Zealand Embassy, Tokyo.

[[File:ANZAC Day Dawn Service in Wellington, New Zealand.JPG|right|thumb|Dawn service in [[Wellington|Wellington, New Zealand]] on the 100 year anniversary of the landing at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]]]]
Dawn Marches and other memorials nationwide are typically attended by the [[New Zealand Defence Force]], the [[New Zealand Cadet Forces]], members of the [[New Zealand Police]], [[New Zealand Fire Service]], [[St. John Ambulance|Order of St John]] Ambulance Service (Youth and Adult Volunteers) as well as [[Scouting New Zealand]], [[GirlGuiding New Zealand]] and other uniformed community service groups including in most places the local [[Pipe Band]] to lead or accompany the March, and sometimes a [[Brass Band]] to accompany the hymns.

Anzac Day now promotes a sense of unity, perhaps more effectively than any other day on the national calendar. People whose politics, beliefs and aspirations are widely different can nevertheless share a genuine sorrow at the loss of so many lives in war.

Paper poppies are widely distributed by the [[Returned Services Association]] and worn as symbols of remembrance. This tradition follows that of the wearing of poppies on [[Remembrance Sunday]] in other Commonwealth countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rsa.org.nz/poppy | title = The Poppy | author = Dr Stephen Clarke | publisher = RSA (Returned Soldiers' Association) | year = 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131019234513/http://www.rsa.org.nz/poppy | archivedate = 19 October 2013 | df = dmy-all | access-date = 7 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clarke |first=Stephen |url=http://www.rsa.org.nz/remem/poppy_hist.html |title=The History of Poppy Day |publisher=RSA.org.nz |accessdate=27 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704072424/http://www.rsa.org.nz/remem/poppy_hist.html |archivedate=4 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day is a public holiday in New Zealand. Shops are prohibited from opening before 1&amp;nbsp;pm as per the [[Anzac Day Act (New Zealand)|Anzac Day Act]] 1966. A prior Act passed in 1949 prevented the holiday from being "Mondayised" (moved to the 26th or 27th should the 25th fall on a weekend),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anzac.govt.nz/significance/myths.html|title=Myths &amp; Misconceptions – a guide to Anzac day for New Zealanders|publisher=Ministry of Culture and Heritage, NZ|accessdate=8 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100407141346/http://www.anzac.govt.nz/significance/myths.html| archivedate= 7 April 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this drew criticism from trade unionists and Labour Party politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/anzac-day/news/article.cfm?c_id=773&amp;objectid=10720866 |title=Kiwis shortchanged this Easter weekend |work=The New Zealand Herald |date=22 April 2011 |accessdate=27 April 2011 |first=Hayden |last=Donnell}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a member's bill introduced by Labour MP [[David Clark (New Zealand politician)|David Clark]] to Mondayise Anzac Day and [[Waitangi Day]] passed, despite opposition from the governing National Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Extra-public-holidays-voted-in/tabid/1607/articleID/294661/Default.aspx| work= 3 News NZ| title= Extra public holidays voted in| date= 17 April 2013| deadurl= no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131225152207/http://www.3news.co.nz/Extra-public-holidays-voted-in/tabid/1607/articleID/294661/Default.aspx| archivedate= 25 December 2013| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand's reason for having Anzac Day as its national commemoration day is different from Australia's. In 1921 the poppies that had been ordered by the RSA for [[Armistice Day]] arrived too late on the ship ''Westmorland''. The RSA was stuck with the cost of 350,000 of these French made poppies and to get its money returned quickly it chose the next commemoration date available to sell them {{ndash}} Dardanelles Day, 25 April 1922. This date then stuck in the psyche of New Zealanders ever since. So Anzac Day in New Zealand was used by accident and not with a direct association to Anzac, Australia or Gallipoli. New Zealand did copy Australia in having dawn services 16 years later, despite New Zealand not landing at dawn at Gallipoli. Attempts have been made to revert to Armistice Day, commencing with the "Tomb for the Unknown Warrior" parade in 2004. But New Zealanders have resisted, unaware of its history. The reason for some wanting to revert is that other bigger battles and losses have since been ignored. Gallipoli accounted for 8% of New Zealand's war losses and 60% of those were not the result of direct combat.&lt;ref&gt;'Why Do We Wear a Red Poppy' by Gavin Marriott {{ISBN|978-0-473-35827-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemoration at Gallipoli==
In [[Turkey]] the name "[[ANZAC Cove]]" was officially recognised by the Turkish government on Anzac Day in 1985. In 1934, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Kemal Atatürk]] delivered the following words to the first Australians, New Zealanders and British to visit the Gallipoli battlefields. This was later inscribed on a monolith at [[Ari Burnu Cemetery]] (ANZAC Beach) which was unveiled in 1985. The words also appear on the [[Kemal Atatürk Memorial, Canberra]], and the Atatürk Memorial in [[Wellington]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mch.govt.nz/nz-identity-heritage/national-monuments-and-war-graves/atat%C3%BCrk-memorial New Zealand Ministry for Heritage and Culture – Atatürk Memorial]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=Sparkzy |fix-attempted=yes }}.

==Commercialisation==
From the beginning, there has been concern to protect the Anzac tradition from inappropriate use. In Australia, use of the word "Anzac" is regulated under the ''Protection of Word "Anzac" Act 1920''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2014C00072|title=Protection of Word "Anzac" Act 1920|work=Federal Register of Legislation|publisher=Australian Government|access-date=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426011820/https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2014C00072|archivedate=26 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Protection of Word 'Anzac' Regulations 1921'' state that: "no person may use the word 'Anzac', or any word resembling it, in connection with any trade, business, calling or profession or in connection with any entertainment or any lottery or art union or as the name or part of a name of any private residence, boat, vehicle of charitable or other institution, or other institution, or any building without the authority of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs". The maximum penalty is 12 months imprisonment, or $10,200 for a person and $51,000 for a corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dva.gov.au/commemorations-memorials-and-war-graves/protecting-word-anzac|title=Protecting the word Anzac|author=Department of Veterans Affairs, Australian Government|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417213553/https://www.dva.gov.au/commemorations-memorials-and-war-graves/protecting-word-anzac|archivedate=17 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over recent years, some historians and commentators have raised concerns over what they see as the increasing commercialisation of Anzac Day. In 2015, historian Dr Carolyn Holbrook stated that companies were seeking to associate themselves with Anzac Day as "Anzac is the most potent and popular brand going around in Australia today".&lt;ref name="7:30 Brandzac Day"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duffy|first1=Connor|title='Brandzac Day': Historian criticises 'new low in the commercialisation of Anzac'|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-15/critics-disgusted-by-vulgar-commercialisation-of-anzac-day/6395756|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=7:30 Report|date=16 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508171539/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-15/critics-disgusted-by-vulgar-commercialisation-of-anzac-day/6395756|archivedate=8 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questionable Anzac marketing campaigns included [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths']] notorious 'Fresh in Our Memories' campaign in 2015, which provoked a strong public backlash. According to Dr Holbrook, Anzac is more sacred than [[Easter]] or [[Christmas]] to many.&lt;ref name=Ausgeog/&gt; Historian Professor [[Joan Beaumont]], researcher Jo Hawkins and historical commentator Dr David Stephens have argued that the Federal Government has not been sufficiently enforcing regulations which limit the extent to which companies can refer to Anzac Day, or use the word "Anzac", in their marketing.&lt;ref name="7:30 Brandzac Day" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stark Defining the Anzac spirit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stark|first1=Jill|title=Defining the Anzac spirit: celebration or commodification?|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/defining-the-anzac-spirit-celebration-or-commodification-20150418-1mntwp.html|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=18 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180421162925/https://www.smh.com.au/national/defining-the-anzac-spirit-celebration-or-commodification-20150418-1mntwp.html|archivedate=21 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been widespread public opposition to the more blatant attempts to commercialise Anzac Day, which has led to some products being withdrawn from sale. Many of the products associated with the centenary of the Gallipoli landings were also commercial failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holbrook|first1=Carolyn|title=How Anzac Day came to occupy a sacred place in Australians' hearts|url=https://theconversation.com/how-anzac-day-came-to-occupy-a-sacred-place-in-australians-hearts-76323|accessdate=20 April 2018|work=The Conversation|date=25 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180421094630/https://theconversation.com/how-anzac-day-came-to-occupy-a-sacred-place-in-australians-hearts-76323|archivedate=21 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable exception is the manufacture and sale of the [[Anzac biscuit]], originally home made to published recipes from about 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/nznews/anzac-biscuits-history-of-a-culinary-icon-2015042018|accessdate=23 November 2018|title=Anzac biscuits: History of a culinary icon|date=20 April 2015|publisher=Newshub - newshub.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for many decades manufactured commercially for retail sale in both Australia and New Zealand.

==Criticism of some commemorations==
For decades, there have been concerns that the participation of young people in Anzac Day events has injected a carnival element into what is traditionally a solemn occasion. The change was highlighted by a rock concert-style performance at the 2005 Anzac Cove commemoration during which attendees drank and slept between [[headstone]]s. After the event the site was left strewn with rubbish.&lt;ref name=Rubbish&gt;Yuko Narushima, [http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/call-for-a-cap-on-gallipoli-crowds/2008/04/03/1206851105571.html Call for a cap on Gallipoli crowds, ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 25 April 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407063256/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/call-for-a-cap-on-gallipoli-crowds/2008/04/03/1206851105571.html |date=7 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rubbish2&gt;Andra Jackson and Doug Conway, [http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/RSL-chiefs-dismayed-by-Gallipoli-rubbish/2005/04/26/1114462039436.html RSL chiefs dismayed by Gallipoli rubbish, ''The Age'', 27 April 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122011641/http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/RSL-chiefs-dismayed-by-Gallipoli-rubbish/2005/04/26/1114462039436.html |date=22 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haywood&gt;Ben Haywood, [http://www.education.theage.com.au/pagedetail.asp?intpageid=1460&amp;strsection=students&amp;intsectionid=0 ANZAC Day] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719234334/http://education.theage.com.au/pagedetail.asp?intpageid=1460&amp;strsection=students&amp;intsectionid=0 |date=19 July 2008 }}, ''The Age'', 2 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, historian [[Jonathan King (historian)|Jonathan King]] said that "escalating commercial pressures threaten to turn the centenary [of the landing at Gallipoli] into a [[Big Day Out]]."&lt;ref name=King /&gt;

==Criticism of Anzac Day==

''See also'' [[Anzac_Day#Popularity_sinks|Popularity sinks]] ''above.''

At its inception, Anzac Day faced criticism from the [[Australian labour movement]], and in the country at large, there has been opposition to political exploitation of what was seen as a day of mourning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title='Australians for Australia': The Right, the Labor Party and Contested Loyalties to Nation and Empire in Australia, 1917 to the Early 1930s |last=Kirk |first=Neville |date=November 2006 |pages=95–111 |jstor=27516154 |doi=10.2307/27516154 |publisher=Labour History}}&lt;/ref&gt; One controversy occurred in 1960 with the publication of [[Alan Seymour]]'s classic play, ''[[The One Day of the Year]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/03/1048962876103.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=The One Day Of The Year, STC | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108100835/http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/03/1048962876103.html | archivedate=8 November 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which dramatised the growing social divide in Australia and the questioning of old values. In the play, Anzac Day is critiqued by the central character, Hughie, as a day of drunken debauchery by returned soldiers and as a day when questions of what it means to be loyal to a nation or Empire must be raised. The play was scheduled to be performed at the inaugural [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]], but after complaints from the [[Returned Services League]], the governors of the Festival refused permission for this to occur.&lt;ref name=Shadows&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/04/25/1050777403378.html Gallipoli's Shadows, ''The Age'', 25 April 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502002146/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/04/25/1050777403378.html |date=2 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

As mentioned above, throughout the 1960s and 1970s, related to Australia's involvement in the Vietnam war and other issues, Anzac Day not only sunk in popularity but was the focus for the expression of much dissent.

Anzac Day has been criticised in recent years by a number of Australians and New Zealanders, as, for example, "a day that obscures the politics of war and discourages political dissent".&lt;ref name=McKenna2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21813244-25132,00.html|title=Patriot Act|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420235137/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21813244-25132,00.html|archive-date=20 April 2008|date=6 June 2007|publisher=The Australian|access-date=16 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/AlternativeANZACs.pdf An Alternative ANZAC Day commemoration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620091046/http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/AlternativeANZACs.pdf |date=20 June 2007 }}, Peace Movement Aotearoa. Retrieved 16 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2008, former Australian Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]] stated that he believes it is misguided for people to gather each year at Anzac Cove to commemorate the landing at Gallipoli, because it is "utter and complete nonsense" to suggest that the nation was "born again or even, redeemed there."&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;Antonette Collins, "[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/10/30/2405820.htm Anzac Gallipoli gatherings misguided, Keating says", ''ABC news'', 30 October 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102043111/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/10/30/2405820.htm |date=2 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The then Australian Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] rejected Keating's views, saying the Gallipoli campaign is "part of our national consciousness, it's part of our national psyche, it's part of our national identity, and I, for one, as Prime Minister of the country, am absolutely proud of it."&lt;ref name="Rudd"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,,24584117-31477,00.html?from=public_rss|title=Kevin Rudd rejects Paul Keating's view on Gallipoli|last=Shanahan|first=Dennis|date=1 November 2008|work=The Australian|publisher=News Limited|accessdate=17 April 2009}}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians believe Anzac Day events are now on the decline, although it's likely there will continue to be smaller dawn services and official events in the future. Dr Martin Crotty thought that perhaps it was now a ritual for older, traditional Australians, with old values of mateship and loyalty and even as a “reaction against globalisation”; however, Dr Carolyn Holbrook disagrees, arguing that young people are responsible for the resurgence, and among older people there is a big group of skeptics, [[Baby Boomers]] who were influenced by Vietnam War protests.&lt;ref name=Ausgeog/&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Other criticisms have revolved around a perceived overzealousness in Australian attachment to the event, either from participants unaware of the loss or when the focus is at the expense of remembrance of the contribution of New Zealand.&lt;ref name=King&gt;{{cite news|last=King|first=Jonathan|title=It's Anzac Day – not the Big Day Out|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/its-anzac-day--not-the-big-day-out-20130419-2i5a4.html|accessdate=25 April 2013|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=20 April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130422021612/http://www.smh.com.au/national/its-anzac-day--not-the-big-day-out-20130419-2i5a4.html|archivedate=22 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, John Howard was criticised for shunning the New Zealand Anzac ceremony at Gallipoli,&lt;ref name=NZH&gt;{{cite news|title=Australian PM snubs NZ at Gallipoli|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/anzac-day/news/article.cfm?c_id=773&amp;objectid=10122084|accessdate=25 April 2013|newspaper=The New Zealand Herald|date=24 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; preferring instead to spend his morning at a [[barbecue]] on the beach with Australian soldiers.

The '''Battle of Montgisard''' was fought between the [[Ayyubids]] and the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] on 25 November 1177. The 16-year-old [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|King Baldwin IV]], seriously afflicted by [[leprosy]], led an out-numbered [[Christian]] force against the [[army]] of [[Saladin]]. The [[Muslim]] army was quickly [[rout]]ed and pursued for twelve [[mile]]s.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|pp=217–218}} Saladin [[Withdrawal (military)|fled]] back to [[Cairo]], reaching the [[city]] on 8 December.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=218}} Muslim [[historian]]s considered Saladin's defeat to be so severe that it was only redeemed by his [[Battle of Hattin|victory]] at the [[Horns of Hattin]] in 1187.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=218}}

==Background==
In 1177, King [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]], and [[Philip, Count of Flanders|Philip of Alsace]] who had recently arrived on pilgrimage, planned an alliance with the [[Byzantine Empire]] for a naval attack on [[Ayyubids|Egypt]]; but none of these plans came to fruition.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=217}} Meanwhile, [[Saladin]] planned his own invasion of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] from Egypt.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=217}} Learning of Saladin's plans, [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]] left Jerusalem with, according to [[William of Tyre]], only 375 [[knight]]s  under the leadership of [[Joshua Cook of Burghfield]] to attempt a defence at [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]], but Baldwin was stalled there by a detachment of troops sent by Saladin. Saladin left part of his army to besiege [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and a smaller force at Ascalon and marched northward with the rest.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=217}}

==Opposing forces==
The true numbers are impossible to estimate, since the Christian sources refer only to knights and give no account of the number of infantry and [[turcopole]]s, except that it is evident from the number of the dead and wounded that there must have been more men than the 375 knights. It is also uncertain whether the so-called knights included mounted [[sergeant]]s or [[squire]]s, or whether they were true knights. One chronicler gave a strength of 7,000 for the Latin army, while another contemporary estimate of 20,000 was probably a textual corruption of 10,000.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=218}}

Just as uncertain are the numbers of their opponents. An 1181 review listed Saladin's Mamluk forces at 6,976 [[Ghulam|Ghulams]] and 1,553 Qaraghulams.&lt;ref&gt;God's Warriors: Knights Templar, Saracens and the Battle for Jerusalem. By Helen Nicholson, David Nicolle. 2005 Osprey Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; However, there would have been additional soldiers available in [[Syria]] and elsewhere, while auxiliaries might have accompanied the Mamluks. William of Tyre reported Saladin's strength as 26,000, while an anonymous chronicler estimated 12,000 Turkish and 9,000 Arab troops.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=218}} Accompanying Baldwin was [[Raynald of Châtillon]], lord of [[Oultrejordain]], who had just been released from captivity in [[Aleppo]] in 1176. Raynald was a fierce enemy of Saladin and was King Baldwin's second-in-command. Also with the army were [[Baldwin of Ibelin]], his brother [[Balian of Ibelin|Balian]], [[Reginald of Sidon]], and [[Joscelin III of Edessa]]. [[Odo de St Amand]], Master of the [[Knights Templar]], came with 84 Templar knights. Another Templar force attempted to meet Baldwin at Ascalon, but they remained besieged at Gaza.

==The battle==
[[Saladin]] continued his march towards Jerusalem, thinking that Baldwin would not dare to follow him with so few men. He attacked [[Ramla]], [[Lod|Lydda]] and [[Arsuf]], but because Baldwin was supposedly not a danger, he allowed his army to be spread out over a large area, pillaging and foraging. However, unknown to Saladin, the forces he had left to subdue the King had been insufficient and now both Baldwin and the Templars were marching to intercept him before he reached Jerusalem.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=217}}

The Christians, led by the King, pursued the Muslims along the coast, finally catching their enemies at Mons Gisardi, near [[Ramla]].&lt;ref&gt;possibly at [[Gezer|Tell el-Jezer]] {{Harv|Lane-Poole|1906|pp=154–155}}, or [[Kfar Menahem]] {{Harv|Lyons|Jackson|1982|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location is disputed, as Ramla was a large region that included the town under the same name. Malcolm Barber equates Mons Gisardi with the mound of al-Safiya.&lt;ref&gt;The Crusader States by Malcolm Barber, published by TJ International Ltd, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Saladin's chronicler [[Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani]] refers to the battle taking place by the mound of Al-Safiya, potentially modern [[Tell es-Safi]] near the village of Menehem, not far from [[Ashkelon]], and within the contemporary Ramla province. Al-Safiya means white and, indeed, the Es-Safi hill is white with the foundations of a Crusader castle recently found at the top, called [[Blanchegarde]]. Ibn Al-Athīr, one of the Arab chroniclers, mentions that Saladin intended to lay siege to a Crusader castle in the area.&lt;ref&gt;The chronicle of Ibn Al-Athīr by D.S. Richards, published by Ashgate Publishing Ltd, 1935&lt;/ref&gt; But Saladin's baggage train had been apparently mired. There is a small stream north of Tell es-Safi bordering farmland that in November might have been plowed up and muddy enough to hinder the passage of the baggage train. The Egyptian chroniclers agree that the baggage had been delayed at a river crossing.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Cameron Lyons, D. E. P. Jackson Cambridge University Press, Aug 20, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Saladin was taken totally by surprise. His army was in disarray: part had been held up by the mired baggage train while another part of his force had scattered into raiding parties across the countryside. The horses were tired from the long march. Some men had to hurry to collect their weapons from the baggage train. Saladin's army, in a state of panic, scrambled to make battle lines against the enemy. King Baldwin ordered the relic of the [[True Cross]] to be raised in front of the troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lane-Poole|1906|pp=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The King, whose teenage body was already ravaged by aggressive leprosy, was helped from his horse and dropped to his knees before the cross. He prayed to God for victory and rose to his feet to cheers from his army.

The Jerusalem army attacked the hurriedly arranged Muslims, inflicting heavy casualties. The King, fighting with bandaged hands to cover his sores, was in the thick of the fighting. Egyptian effective command was under Saladin's nephew Taqi ad-Din. Taqi ad-Din apparently attacked while Saladin was putting his Mamluk guard together. Taqi’s son Ahmad died in the early fighting. Saladin's men were quickly overwhelmed. Saladin himself only avoided capture by escaping, as Ralph de Diceto claims,&lt;ref&gt;Ralph de Diceto (Radulf de Diceto decani Lundoniensis) Ymagines historiarum&lt;/ref&gt; on a racing camel. By nightfall, those Egyptians that were with the Sultan had reached Caunetum Esturnellorum near the mound of [[Tell el-Hesi]]. This is about 25 miles from Ramla. It is only about 7&amp;nbsp;km from Tell es-Safi (al-Safiya).{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=217}}

Baldwin pursued Saladin until nightfall, and then retired to Ascalon. Deluged by ten days of heavy rains and suffering the loss of roughly ninety percent of his army, including his personal bodyguard of [[Mamluk]]s, Saladin fled back to Egypt, harassed by [[Bedouin]]s along the way. Only one tenth of his army made it back to Egypt with him.

==Aftermath==
Baldwin memorialized his victory by erecting a [[Benedictine]] monastery on the battlefield{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}, dedicated to [[St. Catherine of Alexandria]], whose feast day fell on the day of the battle. However, it was a difficult victory; [[Roger de Moulins]], Grand Master of the [[Knights Hospitaller]], reported that {{formatnum:1100}} men had been killed and 750 returned home wounded.{{sfn|Stevenson|1907|p=218}} Saladin, fearing the tenuousness of both his hold on Egypt and the alliance with his Syrian vassals, spread propaganda that the Christians had in fact lost the battle.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Meanwhile, [[Raymond III of Tripoli]] and [[Bohemund III of Antioch]] joined with Philip of Alsace in a separate expedition against [[Harem, Syria|Harim]] in [[Syria]]; the siege of Harim lasted into 1178, and Saladin's defeat at Montgisard prevented him from relieving his Syrian vassals.

==Fiction==
The battle of Montgisard is alluded to in the [[2005 in film|2005 movie]] ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'', as a battle where King Baldwin IV defeated Saladin when he was sixteen. It was also described in ''[[Jerusalem (novel)|Jerusalem]]'' book, written by [[Cecelia Holland]].

An account of the battle is also given in Swedish author [[Jan Guillou]]'s novel ''Tempelriddaren'' ([[The Knight Templar]]) ({{ISBN|91-1-300733-5}}), in which the protagonist, Arn Magnusson (de Gothia) is portrayed as a high-ranking member of the [[Knights Templar]], commanding a contingent of the army at the battle of Montgisard. The battle is shown in the movie ''[[Arn – The Knight Templar]]'', which was based on Guillou's book.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12303">[[File:65th venice film festival.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Venice International Film Festival]] is part of the [[Venice Biennale]]. The famous [[Golden Lion]] is awarded to the best film screening at the competition.]]
'''Biennale''' ({{IPA-it|bi.enˈnaːle|pron}}), [[Italian language|Italian]] for "biennial" or "every other year", is any event that happens every two years. It is most commonly used within the [[art world]] to describe large-scale international [[contemporary art]] exhibitions. As such the term was popularised by [[Venice Biennale]], which was first held in 1895. The phrase has since been used for other artistic events, such as the "[[Biennale de Paris]]", "[[Kochi-Muziris Biennale]]", or even as a [[portmanteau]] as with [[Berlinale]] (for the [[Berlin International Film Festival]]) and [[Vienna International Film Festival|Viennale]] (for [[Vienna]]'s international film festival). "Biennale" is therefore used as a general term for other recurrent international events (such as triennials, [[Documenta]], [[Skulptur Projekte Münster]]).

== Characteristics ==
According to author Federica Martini, what is at stake in contemporary biennales is the diplomatic/international relations potential as well as urban regeneration plans.

[[Image:Crystal Palace - Queen Victoria opens the Great Exhibition.jpg|thumb|The Great Exhibition in [[The Crystal Palace]] in Hyde Park, London, in 1851, the first attempt to condense the representation of the world within a unitary exhibition space.]]
A strong and influent symbol of biennales and of large-scale international exhibitions in general is the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], the gigantic and futuristic London architecture that hosted the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition in 1851]]. According to philosopher [[Peter Sloterdijk]],&lt;ref&gt;Im Weltinnenraum des Kapitals, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2013}} the Crystal Palace is the first attempt to condense the representation of the world in a unitary exhibition space, where the main exhibit is society itself in an a-historical, spectacular condition. The Crystal Palace main motives were the affirmation of British economic and national leadership and the creation of moments of spectacle. In this respect, 19th century World fairs provided a visual crystallization of colonial culture and were, at the same time, forerunners of contemporary theme parks.

=== The Venice Biennale as an archetype ===
[[File:Map of Venice Biennial.pdf|thumb|left|The structure of the Venice Biennale in 2005 with an international exhibition and the national pavilions.]]
The [[Venice Biennale]], a periodical large-scale cultural event founded in 1895, served as an archetype of the biennales. Meant to become a [[World Fair]] focused on [[contemporary art]], the Venice Biennale used as a pretext the wedding anniversary of the Italian king and followed up to several national exhibitions organised after Italy unification in 1861. The Biennale immediately put forth issues of city marketing, cultural tourism and urban regeneration, as it was meant to reposition Venice on the international cultural map after the crisis due to the end of the [[Grand Tour]] model and the weakening of the Venetian school of painting. Furthermore, the Gardens where the Biennale takes place were an abandoned city area that needed to be re-functionalised. In cultural terms, the Biennale was meant to provide on a biennial basis a platform for discussing contemporary art practices that were not represented in fine arts museums at the time. The early Biennale model already included some key points that are still constitutive of large-scale international art exhibitions today: a mix of [[city marketing]], internationalism, [[gentrification]] issues and destination culture, and the spectacular, large scale of the event.

=== Biennales after the 1990s ===
The situation of biennials has changed in the contemporary context: while at its origin in 1895 Venice was a unique cultural event, but since the 1990s hundreds of biennials have been organized across the globe. Given the ephemeral and irregular nature of some biennials, there is little consensus on the exact number of biennials in existence at any given time. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Furthermore, while Venice was a unique agent in the presentation of contemporary art, since the 1960s several museums devoted to contemporary art are exhibiting the contemporary scene on a regular basis. Another point of difference concerns 19th century internationalism in the arts, that was brought into question by post-colonial debates and criticism of the contemporary art “ethnic marketing”, and also challenged the Venetian and World Fair’s national representation system. As a consequence of this, Eurocentric tendency to implode the whole word in an exhibition space, which characterises both the Crystal Palace and the Venice Biennale, is affected by the expansion of the artistic geographical map to scenes traditionally considered as marginal. The birth of the Havana Biennial in 1984 is widely considered an important counterpoint to the Venetian model for its prioritization of artists working in the Global South and curatorial rejection of the national pavilion model.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3574">The '''Bravio delle botti''' (''Bravio of the barrels)'' is an annual race held in the Italian town of [[Montepulciano]] since 1974, replacing an equivalent horserace dating back to 1373. Teams of two runners (spingitori) representing the eight districts of the town ([[contrade]]) compete to be the first to roll an 80&amp;nbsp;kg [[Oak (wine)|wine barrel]] through the streets of the historic centre from the ''Colonna del Marzocco'' to the finish on the ''Piazza Grande,'' the cathedral square. The total distance is approximately 1800m and is uphill for nearly the entire course. As the streets are narrow and the barrels cumbersome to manoeuvre, collisions are frequent.

The word "bravio" derives from the Latin ''Bravium'' meaning "to be won". It refers to the prize given to the winning Contrada - a painted cloth bearing the image of the patron saint of the city.

'''''Broken Promises: Taking Emily Back''''' is a [[1993 in film|1993]] [[television film]] produced and directed by Donald Wrye.

== Plot ==
Ever since Pam Cheney ([[Cheryl Ladd]]) lost her baby during labor, she has been struggling with depression. She is not only supported by her loving, but hard working husband Sean ([[Robert Desiderio]]), but also by her friends Ella ([[Polly Draper]]) and Terry Sabin (D. David Morin), who have also lost a baby at age three. One year after labor, Pam decides to finally take a proposal to adopt a toddler. Going through official agencies proves unsuccessful, partly due to Pam's age, partly due to the growing demand of adoption. She is advised to take care of an orphaned teenager instead, but Sean refuses this option.

Instead, she meets a lawyer she knows nothing about, and, without going through legal business, pays him a large sum of money to meet with a homeless couple, Gary ([[Ted Levine]]) and Lily Ward ([[Kathleen Wilhoite]]), who are selling their daughter Emily (Amanda and Megan Braun). Even though Sean has severe doubts about the lawyer and the morality of this kind of adoption, he allows his wife to meet with the couple. During this, it immediately becomes clear to Pam that Ella is unwilling to give up Emily, though Ella insists that she wants the best for her daughter. At the end of the conversation, Gary allows Pam and Sean to adopt their kid.

Pam is delighted and soon grows used to raising a child. Trouble starts when Gary and Lily, having recently been thrown out of their shelter, demand to take back Emily, pointing out that the contract allows them to change their minds for the first thirty days after the adoption. Pam is desperate to prevent this, and grants Gary his one wish: she buys him a car, even though the contract forbids her to support Gary and Lily financially. Hoping that this has changed Gary's mind, she keeps the deal a secret from her husband. However, when Gary returns, demanding for more, Sean feels that his doubts are confirmed: Gary and Lily are con artists. He wants to give up Emily before he and Pam get involved too much emotionally, but it proves too late: Pam is unwilling to leave Emily.

Alternatively, she recognizes Gary as the source of all trouble and persuades Lily to leave him. Though Gary is able to seduce Lily - now pregnant again - back, he agrees on leaving alone the Cheneys and Emily. Meanwhile, Ella, who accompanied Pam to the shelter where she met with Lily and became moved by a poor orphan, convinces Terry to give parenthood another chance. They meet with an attorney to legally adopt Lily's unborn child. Lily commits to the deal, but later finds out that Gary has granted the adoption to another couple outside the law. Realizing that her husband is no good, she leaves him to be beaten by another man.

Sometime later, Lily gives birth to a baby boy. Gary shows up at the hospital with a new lawyer to claim Emily and the boy. Lily, however, convinces him that they are bad parents and should be brought up by the Cheneys and Sabins. In the end, Gary leaves the hospital, leaving his children behind with the adoptive parents.

==Production==
In a 1993 interview, Ladd commented on the film: "This particular story really grabbed me, and I think that's partly because there's been so much of this in the news. What I loved about it is that there really are no heroes and no villains, just humans with all of their gifts and all of their difficulties." She furthermore praised her colleagues for their acting performances and recalled the film as "some of the best work I've done on television."&lt;ref&gt;"Cheryl Ladd threatened by 'Broken Promises'" by Jay Bobbin, ''[[Rome News-Tribune]]'', December 24, 1993. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was scheduled to air in October 1993,&lt;ref&gt;"Heidi's ex-beau gets plush TV deal for couple's story", ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', August 29, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; but the release was pushed back two months later.

[[File:Woman-using-chocolate-fountain.jpg|right|thumb|175px|[[Chocolate fountain]] being used at a social function.]]
A '''chocolataire''' is a type of social gathering&lt;ref&gt;Maud C. Cooke, ''Social Life: Or, The Manners and Customs of Polite Society, Containing the Rules of Etiquette for All Occasions'', p.296, 1896.&lt;/ref&gt; which ranges from large events (such as fund raising and [[RSVP (invitations)|invitation only]]) to smaller functions (similar in structure to informal [[tea party (social gathering)|tea parties]]), in which all food and drink are composed of or contain some form of [[chocolate]].&lt;ref&gt;Jill Foulston, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hI4rAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Chocolataire+party&amp;dq=Chocolataire+party&amp;pgis=1 The Virago Book of the Joy of Shopping]'', p.84, 2007. ({{ISBN|184408275X}}, 9781844082759)&lt;/ref&gt;  Considered obsolete by some,&lt;ref&gt;Judith Martin, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ju1XvqoMookC&amp;pg=PA453&amp;dq=Chocolataire+party Miss Manners' Guide for the Turn-of-the-Millennium]'', p.453, 1990. ({{ISBN|067172228X}}, 9780671722289)&lt;/ref&gt; this entertainment was at its peak popularity around the turn of the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Sorrel Marks, Lynne Marks, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2T4miKwsIIcC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=Chocolataire Revivals and Roller Rinks: Religion, Leisure, and Identity in Late-nineteenth-century Small-town Ontario]'', p.99, 1996 ({{ISBN|0802078001}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8020-7800-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; (the process for making [[milk chocolate]] having been [[History of chocolate#origins|brought to market]] in 1875), and was seen as a novel alternative to the other forms of social gathering at the time.

==Food and drink==
The menu at a chocolataire may include any variety of chocolate-based dishes: [[cake]]s, [[wafer]]s, [[bonbon]]s, [[candy]], and [[pastry]] being a few examples thereof. These dishes can also be seasonal. For instance, featuring [[hot chocolate]] as the drink of choice in the colder months, and chocolate [[lemonade]] in the warmer ones; with chocolate [[fondue]] and chocolate [[ice cream]] being the seasonal food choices for winter and summer, respectively.

==Ceremony==
[[File:La famille du Duc de Penthièvre dit la tasse de chocolat.jpg|thumb|Chocolate at a social function, 1768 painting]]
As the chocolataire grew in popularity, the ceremony itself became more chocolate-themed—the [[menu]] cards, [[event program|programs]], decorations, and even the costumes of the waiters were of chocolate color; chocolate [[teacup|cups]] and [[saucer]]s were sometimes sold with the chocolate that was served in them,&lt;ref&gt;The Penn publishing company, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oHHh6RAmq-MC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=Chocolataire+party#PPA30,M1 Eureka Entertainments: Containing a Wide Variety of New and Novel Entertainments Suitable to All Kinds of Public and Private Occasions]'', 1894&lt;/ref&gt; or given as a [[souvenir]] for those who purchased chocolate.
The chocolataire saw use in every social gathering imaginable—one was even thrown as part of a [[fundraising|fund raising]] function for a [[kindergarten]] in Indiana&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jlgVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA482&amp;dq=Chocolataire+party The Kindergarten-primary Magazine], 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;—and it was not uncommon, after all guests have been served, to hold an [[auction]] of remaining candy, loaves of cake, and boxes of chocolate left over from preparation of the dishes.&lt;ref&gt;Lillian M. Heath, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HSMVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Chocolataire+party#PPA28,M1 Eighty Pleasant Evenings]'', p.28, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use==
The modern analog to the traditional chocolataire is found in some [[bridesmaid]] and [[bachelorette]] parties (where traditional chocolate foods and candies like [[Chocolate truffle|truffles]] and cake are joined by newer recipes like chocolate [[beer]] and [[martini (cocktail)|martini]]s&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Peltz, [http://www.aisledash.com/2007/12/06/calling-all-chocoholics-have-yourself-a-chocolataire/ Calling all chocoholics! Have yourself a chocolataire.] article at aisledash.com&lt;/ref&gt;), and restaurants like "Death by Chocolate" in [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]] featuring all-chocolate menus.

'''Coin-rolling related scams''' are a collection of [[scams]] involving [[coin wrapper]]s (rolls of coins). The scammer will roll coins of lesser value or [[Slug (coin)|slugs]] of no value, or less than the correct number of coins in a roll, then exchange them at a bank or retail outlet for cash.

To prevent these problems, many banks will require people turning in coins to have an account, and will debit the customer's account in the event of a shorted roll. Some banks also have machines to count coins.

==Penny and dime scam==
The con will wrap pennies into a [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]]-roll wrapper and try to exchange it, this is known as "penny rolling" in slang. Sometimes the con will also exchange other legitimate rolls of [[coin]]s at the same time. Another trick is to put dimes on the visible ends of the roll, and hidden pennies on the inside. This scam can also be done using [[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]]s and [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]]s.

==Short-rolling scams==
Alternatively, one can place one or two fewer coins than usual in each roll. [[Half dollar (United States coin)|Half-dollars]] are a common choice for this kind of scam, for two reasons. First, there are only 20 coins per half-dollar roll, increasing the profit percentage. Also, since half-dollars rarely circulate, most bank tellers are unaware of the proper length and/or weight of a roll. Also owing to their lack of circulation, the missing coins are not likely to be discovered for a long time.

==Foreign coin scams==
[[File:Italia lire 500.jpg|thumb|The obsolete 500 [[Italian Lira]] coin, which is similar to the 2 [[Euro]] coin.]]
Another possibility is to pad foreign coins into the rolls. Generally cancelled European coins (see [[Euro]]) are used. Such coins can often be purchased in bulk at flea markets. Some con artists bank on the fact that the typical customer will just re-circulate these coins, or keep them for themselves thinking they are valuable.

In the [[United States]], it is not uncommon to find [[Canadian coins]] in circulation (and vice versa), although the extent to which this is done deliberately is unknown. It will be more unlikely to find [[2 cent euro coin]], other foreign pennies. Pennies from pre-2010 and nickels minted between 1982-2000 are very common because their composition is similar to American coins, so coin counting machines can't tell the difference.

Various currencies, including the 500 [[Italian Lira]] coin, the 5 [[South African Rand]] coin,  and the 10 [[Thai baht]] coin, are similar to the 2 [[Euro]] coin and are sometimes passed off as such, especially to tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steves|first1=Rick|title=Tourist Scams and Rip-Offs|url=http://www.ricksteves.com/travel-tips/theft-scams/tourist-scams|website=Rick Steves's Europe|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when the Lira was legitimate currency, 500 Lira was only worth €0.26.&lt;ref&gt;http://coinmill.com/ITL_calculator.html#ITL=500&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coin bags==
In the United Kingdom and, until 2002, the Republic of Ireland, coin wrappers are not used, instead small plastic bags are provided free of charge at banks which are filled by the customer with the appropriate amount of the same value coin as printed on the bag. When depositing or changing, the bags are weighed at the bank to check they contain the right amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polypostalpackaging.com/shop/images/categories/Captive%20Flap%20Printed%20No%20Mixed%20Coin%20Bags.JPG |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715102551/http://www.polypostalpackaging.com/shop/images/categories/Captive%20Flap%20Printed%20No%20Mixed%20Coin%20Bags.JPG |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of the clear bag are easy for the bank teller to check.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1996">Until 2006, the '''Connecticut Agricultural Fair''' was held annually the last full weekend of July on the Goshen Fairgrounds in [[Goshen, Connecticut]]. A total community event, the [[Connecticut]] Agricultural Fair was a [[not-for-profit]] event run solely by over 300 volunteers from all corners of [[Connecticut]] and beyond. The Connecticut Agricultural Fair offered three days of family-oriented recreation including contests; [[livestock]] exhibits; commercial displays; live national, regional, and local [[entertainment]]; youth and junior fair activities; equipment displays; and [[tractor]] pulls.  

The Connecticut Agricultural Fair was designated as a “Major” fair in Connecticut, a member of the [[International Association of Fairs and Expositions]] (IAFE), as well as the Connecticut Association of Fairs.

== History ==
The Connecticut Agricultural Fair was founded in 1967 by the members and [[Grange movement|granges]] of the Connecticut State Grange. Their mission then, and today, is to promote agriculture and to educate the public about its importance in everyone's lives. The first Connecticut Agricultural Fair was held on the Durham Fairgrounds, where it was held until the mid-1980s when the fair moved to its final location on the Goshen Fairgrounds in Litchfield County, in the foothills of the Berkshire Mountains. In 2006, the Connecuticut State Grange canceled the fair permanently.&lt;ref name="fairend"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctstategrange.org/ctagfairpage.asp |title=Connecticut State Grange |accessdate=2011-08-13 |publisher=Connecticut State Grange |author=Connecticut State Grange |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Count's Feud''' ({{lang-da|Grevens Fejde}}), also called the '''Count's War''', was a [[war of succession]] that raged in [[Denmark]] in 1534–36 and brought about the [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|Reformation in Denmark]]. In the international context, it was part of the [[European wars of religion]]. The Count's Feud takes its name from the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Count [[Christopher of Oldenburg]], who supported the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] King [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II]], deposed in 1523, over the election of [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | language = Danish | place = DK | title = Danske Konger | url = http://www.danskekonger.dk/biografi/andre/grevefejde.html | contribution = Grevens Fejde | trans-title = Danish Kings and their History | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100920120934/http://danskekonger.dk/biografi/andre/grevefejde.html | archivedate = 2010-09-20 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | language = Danish | title = Danmark Historien | place = DK | url = http://www.danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/grevens-fejde-1534-36 | contribution = Grevens Fejde 1534–36 | publisher = Aarhus Universitet}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a staunch Protestant who had already implemented [[Lutheranism]] as the state religion in [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]] and [[Duchy of Holstein|Holstein]] in 1528.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite web|url=https://snl.no/Christian_3|title= Christian 3|publisher= Store norske leksikon|author= Erik Opsahl|accessdate= August 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/Danmark_1536-1849/Wolfgang_von_Utenhof|title=Wolfgang von Utenhof

== Background ==
[[File:Christian III.jpg|right|thumb|150 px|King [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]]]]
After [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederick I]]'s death in 1533, the [[Election of Christian III|Jutland nobility proclaimed his son]], then Duke Christian of [[Gottorp]], as King under the name [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]]. Meanwhile, Count Christopher (or Christoffer) organized an uprising against the new king, demanding that Christian II be set free. Supported by [[Lübeck]] and troops from [[Oldenburg]] and [[Mecklenburg]], parts of the [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] and [[Skåneland|Skåne]] nobilities rose up, together with cities such as [[Copenhagen]] and [[Malmø]]. The violence itself began in 1534, when a [[privateer]] captain who had earlier been in Christian II's service, Klemen Andersen, called [[Skipper Clement]], at Count Christoffer's request instigated the peasants of [[Vendsyssel]] and [[North Jutland County|North Jutland]] to rise up against the nobles. The headquarters for the revolt came to be in [[Aalborg]]. A large number of manors were burned down in northern and western Jutland. On 10 August 1534, Count Christoffer accepted [[Skåneland|Skåne]] for Christian II's rule. The month before, Christoffer was heralded as [[regent]] on Christian II's behalf by the Zealand Council in [[Ringsted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | language = Danish | publisher = Roennebech | url = http://www.roennebech.dk/www_fredericiashistorie/html/fredericia/artikler/Grevens_fejde.html | contribution = Grevens Fejde | title = Danmarks historie | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100525172351/http://www.roennebech.dk/www_fredericiashistorie/html/fredericia/artikler/Grevens_fejde.html | archivedate = 2010-05-25 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The battles of Svenstrup and Aalborg==
[[Image:Johan rantzau.jpg|right|thumb|150 px|Johan Rantzau]]
An army of nobles under the leadership of [[Niels Brock]] and [[Holger Rosenkrantz]] was defeated at the Battle of Svenstrup on 16 October 1534. Christian III, in the meantime, forced a peace with Lübeck, from which great reinforcements could be freed up to fight against the rebels.  Under the leadership of [[Johan Rantzau]], the royal troops pursued the peasants all the way to Aalborg, where the latter, under the leadership of Skipper Clement, had taken refuge behind the city's fortifications.

On 18 December, Rantzau's troops stormed the city, and it fell.  At least 2,000 people are thought to have lost their lives in the storming of the city and in the plundering of the following days.  For his part, Skipper Clement, badly wounded, managed to escape, but a few days later was recognized by a peasant in [[Storvorde]] east of Aalborg and handed over to Rantzau.  Skipper Clement was later sentenced to death by the judicial council in [[Viborg, Denmark|Viborg]] and executed in 1536.&lt;ref&gt;[http://graenseforeningen.dk/artikel/3724 ''Grevens Fejde, borgerkrig 1534-1536'' (Grænseforeningen)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719124213/http://graenseforeningen.dk/artikel/3724 |date=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The battles of Helsingborg and Øksnebjerg==
Fortune did not fare well for the rebelling supporters of the Catholic faith, nor for the farmers on the [[Sweden|Swedish]] front.  The Swedish King [[Gustav Vasa]] sent a Swedish army to the aid of Christian III, which invaded [[Skåne]] at [[Loshult]] and plundered, burned, and murdered their way throughout the {{Interlanguage link multi|Göinge (region)|sv|3=Göinge|lt=Gønge}} area as it advanced toward the town of [[Vä|Væ]].  Later, a Swedish army invaded [[Halland]], which was destroyed by fire and sword.  Some of the Scanian nobles sided with the Swedes, but [[Tyge Krabbe]] in [[Helsingborg]] Castle supported Count Christoffer.  In January 1535, the Swedes and the army of nobles advanced on Helsingborg.  An army consisting of residents of Lübeck and Malmø under [[Jørgen Kock]] was entrenched outside of the castle, and in a decisive moment, Tyge Krabbe suddenly had the castle's cannons open fire against its defenders, after which he opened the castle to the Swedes, who set fire to Helsingborg and reduced the town to ashes.  With that, Denmark east of the [[Oresund|Sound]] was lost for Count Christoffer.

After the victory at Aalborg, Rantzau brought his troops to Funen, and on 11 June 1535, they fought the [[Battle of Øksnebjerg]], where the rest of Count Christoffer's army was decisively defeated.  Both Copenhagen and Malmø, however, were able to hold out until 1536, when they were forced to capitulate after several months' siege.  With this, the Count's Feud was officially over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bricksite.com/grevensfejde?id=377277|title=Grevensfejde|website=www.bricksite.com|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The aftermath==
In the aftermath of the feud, the nobles regrouped and healed the rifts the usual way, namely through inter-marriage. One of the most powerful among the Danish nobility in [[Skåneland|Skåne]] at this time was the Bille family, who were tied through blood relations to seven of the eight Catholic bishops of Denmark. The Billes also had six family members on the Council of the Realm and owned castles throughout Denmark and Norway. In order to keep the family's powerful position, in spite of the religious affiliation with the Catholic faith, [[Claus Bille]] (of [[Stockholm Bloodbath]] fame, second cousin to [[Gustav Vasa]]), protected the family by forming a political alliance through marriage with the Brahe family, another powerful Scanian family among the Danish nobility at this time. The Brahe family was one of the first among the nobility to convert to Lutheranism. Claus Bille gave his 18-year-old daughter Beate in marriage to [[Otte Brahe]], and thus became a grandfather in 1546 to the perhaps most famous Scanian of the era, the astronomer Tyge Brahe, better known as [[Tycho Brahe]]. Tycho Brahe's paternal grandfather, whom he was named after, Tyge Brahe of Tosterup in eastern Skåne, was killed 7 September 1523 during the siege of Malmø, fighting for Frederick I. Axel Brahe, the brother of the older Tyge Brahe, served as governor of Scania for a long period, and was one of the first to convert to Lutheranism.

In contrast, the consequences of the peasant uprising cost all parties dearly.  Many were forced to purchase their lives with great gifts both to the king and to the nobles.  Moreover, the dissatisfactions of the peasants, which had culminated in the uprising of the Count's Feud, were only made worse, as the nobility began to stick together even more after this incident.  Moreover, Christian III's rule, ushered in by this war, saw the rise of royal absolutism in Denmark, and, with it, greater repression of the peasant classes.

An important consequence not sufficiently appreciated by Danes at the time was the introduction of a Swedish army into Skåne. Though in this case the Swedes came at the invitation of a Danish King to help subdue his rebellious subjects and duly handed over to the King the territory which they conquered, it had a clear effect of whetting Swedish appetite to gain the territory for themselves, which was manifested in a long series of subsequent wars culminating with the final Swedish victory and conquest in 1658.

==Dates of the Count's Feud battles==
* Battle of Svenstrup – 16 October 1534
* Storming of Aalborg – 18 December 1534
* Battle of Helsingborg (Kernen) – 12 January 1535
* Battle of Øksnebjerg – 11 June 1535

==In popular culture==
The science fiction novel ''[[The Corridors of Time]]'' by [[Poul Anderson]]&amp;nbsp;— an American of Danish origin, whose work often includes themes from Danish and Scandinavian history&amp;nbsp;— includes a vivid description of Jutland in the immediate aftermath of the Count's Feud and the continuing struggle by hunted diehard rebels, as seen by a time-traveller from the 20th century.

On February 19, 2018, 5:30pm, one hundred and ten (110) schoolgirls aged 11–19 years old were kidnapped by the [[Boko Haram]] terrorist group from the Government Girls' Science and Technical College (GGSTC), Dapchi, located in Bulabulin, [[Yunusari]] Local Government area of Yobe State, in the northeast part of Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sahara|first1=Reporters|title=Abducted Dapchi Girls in 'Boko Haram town' in Yobe, Claims Rep|url=http://saharareporters.com/2018/03/02/abducted-dapchi-girls-boko-haram-town-yobe-claims-rep|accessdate=4 March 2018|agency=Sahara Reporters Inc|publisher=Sahara Reporters Inc|date=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aljazeera|first1=News|title=110 Nigerian schoolgirls still missing after attack: Minister|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/110-nigerian-schoolgirls-missing-attack-minister-180225171154082.html|accessdate=4 March 2018|agency=Aljazeera Media Network|publisher=Aljazeera Media Network|date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Searcey|first1=Dionne|title=Boko Haram Storms Girls’ School in Nigeria, Renewing Fears|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/world/africa/nigeria-kidnapping-boko-haram-dapchi.html|accessdate=4 March 2018|agency=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Federal Government of Nigeria]] has deployed the Nigerian Airforce and other security agencies to search for the missing schoolgirls and to hopefully enable their return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Onuah|first1=Felix|title=Nigeria says 110 girls unaccounted for after Boko Haram attack|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-security/nigeria-says-110-girls-unaccounted-for-after-boko-haram-attack-idUSKCN1G90Q3|accessdate=4 March 2018|agency=Reuters|publisher=Reuters|date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The governor of Yobe State, Ibrahim Gaidam blamed the Nigerian soldiers for having removed a military checkpoint from the town. Dapchi lies approximately 275&amp;nbsp;km (170 miles) northwest of Chibok, where over 276 schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=News|first1=BBC|title=Nigeria's Dapchi school abduction: Father's plea to find daughter|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-43193477|accessdate=4 March 2018|agency=BBC|publisher=BBC News|date=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Military withdrawal shortly before kidnapping===
[[Ibrahim Geidam]], the governor of [[Yobe State]], has complained about the withdrawal of army troops from Dapchi allegedly just hours before the abduction, without informing either the local police or the state government in advance.  Initially the army remained silent regarding this complaint.&lt;ref name="evidence"&gt;[https://secure.saharareporters.com/2018/02/27/dapchigirls-exclusive-document-shows-nigerian-military-knew-boko-harams-plan-carry-out Military Knew Of Boko Haram's Plan To Carry Out Mass Abductions In Yobe, But Withdrew Troops] Sahara-Reporters.  Feb. 27, 2018. Downloaded Mar. 5, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Days later the army made seemingly contradictory claims attempting to explain its withdrawal. The army claimed that it had withdrawn its forces from the town due to the absence of evidence of any Boko Haram activity in the general vicinity, and that at the time, it had formally handed over Dapchi's security to the police prior to its withdrawal.&lt;ref name="blame-game"&gt;[https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2018/03/04/dapchi-let-the-blame-game-stop/ Dapchi: Let the Blame Game Stop] This Day Live. Mar 4, 2018. Downloaded Mar. 5, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In an army intelligence document obtained by the [[Sahara Reporters|Sahara-Reporters]] group dated Feb. 6, 2018 an army general expressed concern regarding a possible imminent Boko Haram attack in adjacent Damaturu, 60 miles away, thus calling into question the army's earlier assertion that it had good reason to believe that Boko Haram had left the general vicinity.&lt;ref name="evidence"/&gt;  The Yobe state police commissioner strongly denied the army's claim that his department had been formally informed by the army of the army's withdrawal, and no proof of any such police notification was provided by the army.&lt;ref name="blame-game"/&gt;

===Uncertainty regarding number of abductees===
Initially the Yobe governor stated that 94 schoolgirls were kidnapped from the school and that 48 had returned to their parents and that only 46 are still missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adekunle|first1=Aliyu|title=111 Yobe schoolgirls not accounted for – Yobe police boss |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/02/111-yobe-schoolgirls-not-accounted-yobe-police-boss/|accessdate=4 March 2018|agency=Vanguard Newspaper|publisher=Vanguard Media Limited, Nigeria|date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While, Bashir Manzo, the chairman of the Forum of Missing Dapchi Schoolgirls Parents said that 105 girls were missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abdulkareem|first1=Haruna|title=Dapchi parents release names of 105 schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram(FULL LIST)|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/259806-dapchi-parents-release-names-105-schoolgirls-abducted-boko-haramfull-list.html|accessdate=4 March 2018|agency=Premium Times|publisher=Premium Times Nigeria|date=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police commissioner of Yobe, Abdulmaliki Sunmonu said that 111 schoolgirls were missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vanguard|first1=Newspapers|title=There’s still conflicting report on number of abducted Dapchi girls, their identity – FG|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2018/02/theres-still-conflicting-report-number-abducted-dapchi-girls-identity-fg/|accessdate=4 March 2018|publisher=Vanguard Media Limited|date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison to Chibok kidnapping===
As in the recent [[Chibok kidnapping|Chibok schoolgirl kidnapping]], so too in the Dapchi kidnapping the Nigerian government took days to respond at all, and then responded with several assurances that the kidnappers would be promptly apprehended, and that all of the girls would soon be returned safely to their homes.  In the Chibok event, four years later still approximately a third of the abductees remained in the hands of Boko Haram, with those girls who have been released, for the most part having been released via ransom payments, and with only one low-level kidnapper having been apprehended and standing trial to date (Mar. 5, 2018).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-security/first-person-convicted-for-nigerias-boko-haram-schoolgirl-kidnap-idUSKCN1FY2N3 First person convicted for Nigeria's Boko Haram schoolgirl kidnap]  World News.

== Release ==
On 21 March, the [[Federal government of Nigeria]] announced that Boko Haram terrorists had returned 106 of the kidnapped children, including 104 girls who went to school, one girl who did not and a boy. The lone abducted Christian girl wasn't released and her parents told [[Agence France-Presse]] that the group would only release her if she converted to Islam.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/43489217|title=Dapchi girls: Freed Nigerian girls tell of kidnap ordeal|date=March 22, 2018|accessdate=March 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group dropped them off in the town in nine vehicles. Information minister [[Lai Mohammed]] stated that the release was unconditional. The fighters after releasing the girls warned their parents not to put them in school again.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;

The '''Davao City Torotot Festival''' is a festival celebrated in [[Davao City]] every [[New Year's Eve]] which involves the blowing party horns, or what are more commonly known to [[Filipinos]] as ''torotots''. It was first held during the city’s 2014 New Year’s eve celebration at the Freedom Park along Roxas Avenue from 1 pm on December 31, 2013 to 1 am on January 1, 2014. The first celebration of the annual festival was also an attempt of the city to break [[Japan]]'s world record for the most people simultaneously blowing party horns&lt;ref name = "colina" &gt;Colina, Antonio IV.

The Torotot Festival was organized in line with the city’s firecracker and pyrotechnic ban.
&lt;!--- Write your article below this line ---&gt;

==Background==
=== Firecracker and pyrotechnic ban ===
The Davao City Council, under the leadership of then-Mayor [[Rodrigo Duterte]], passed Ordinance 060-02, more commonly known as the firecracker ban, on October 15, 2002. The ordinance prohibits the manufacture, sale, distribution, possession, or use of firecrackers or pyrotechnic devices in the city.

Penalties for non-compliance of the ordinance are as follows: a fine of P1,000 or a 20- to 30-day imprisonment for the first offense, a fine of P3,000 or a one- to three-month imprisonment for the second offense or both, and a fine of P5,000 or a three- to six-month imprisonment or both for third and succeeding offenses. Business establishments will also suffer business permit cancellation on their third offense.&lt;ref&gt;Arguillas, Carloyn. [http://www.mindanews.com/top-stories/2010/12/26/davao-citys-firecracker-ban-silent-night-holy-night-for-10-years-now/ “Davao City’s firecracker ban “Silent Night, Holy Night” for 10 years now.”] ‘’MindaNews”, Davao City, 26 December 2010. Retrieved on 10 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ordinance’s 12 years of implementation, Davao City has recorded five straight injury-free years, starting on the New Year’s eve of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Geronimo, Gian. [http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/288418/news/regions/firecracker-ban-keeps-davao-city-injury-free-for-fourth-straight-year “Firecracker ban keeps Davao City free for fourth straight year”] ‘’[[GMA News Online]]'', Davao City, 1 January 2013. Retrieved on 10 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2014 festival==
=== Organizers ===
Telecommunications company Smart Communications partnered with the Local Government Unit of Davao in organizing the festival. To make the Torotot Festival possible, it provided free party horns to its subscribers. The provided party horns are machine readable for registration and official record-keeping.&lt;ref name = "tacio" /&gt;

Smart also gave out cash prizes to the villages with the most contingents and to the village with the most creative party horns. The village with most registrants received P50,000 while the winners of the most creative party horns were awarded P25,000 for the first prize, P15,000 for the second prize, and P10,000 for the third prize.&lt;ref name = "colina" /&gt;

In the most creative party horns contest, Barangay Angliongto, Barangay 21-C, and Barangay Los Amigos won first, second, and third places, respectively. In the most contingents category, Barangay Communal, Barangay Buhangin, and Barangay Lapu-Lapu won first, second, and third places, respectively.&lt;ref name = "colina" /&gt;

=== World record ===
Once officially validated and recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records, the Davao Torotot Festival will be the region’s second world record, next to the Monfort Bat Sanctuary’s record on being home to about 2.4 million Rousette fruit bats, the biggest colony of the fruit bat in the world.&lt;ref name = "tacio" /&gt; The Monfort Bat Sanctuary is in the Island Garden City of Samal.

According to the [[The Georgian Chronicles|Georgian Chronicler]], during Lent, when [[Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli|Mkhargrdzeli]]-brothers, were at the royal palace of [[Geguti]] in Western [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgia]], with the Queen who had lost her [[David Soslan|husband]], the [[Sultan]] of [[Ardabil]] (an ancestor of Shah [[Ismail I|Ismail Safavi]]) crossed the Arak mountains, and entered Ani at dawn on [[Easter|Easter day]], when the town-gates were being opened and the entire population was at prayer. He made a terrible massacre of the local population crowded in the churches. After perpetrating a dreadful massacre (12,000 people were slaughtered in the churches alone) and pillaging the town, the Sultan returned loaded with spoils and captives to his domains.

== History ==
When news of the tragedy of Ani reached [[Geguti]], Tamar called ''Darbazi'' – the supreme [[Curia regis|royal council]] – where the Mkhargrdzeli brothers proposed punishing the Sultan immediately. A punitive campaign against the [[Eldiguzids]] was started with the council's agreement, and Queen Tamar approved. This war did not pursue the purpose of territorial conquest or even of establishing some form of political dependence on Georgia. It was a typical invasion by a feudal state into a rich and relatively weak country with the aim of pillage and of showing its military strength. Preparations were made carefully and in secret.

The brothers Mkhargrdzeli went to Ani and started preparations. Expedition took place in the following year, The Mkhargrdzelis sent a messenger to the Queen with a request to send her troops to join them. She gave an order to the [[Meskheti|Meskhians]], [[Tori (Georgia)|Torelians]], [[Tmogvi]]ans, [[Ingiloy people|Her]]-[[Kakheti]]ans and [[Armenians]]. They gathered in Ani and from there they planned their way to [[Ardabil]], Georgian cavalry crossed the [[Aras (river)|Araxes]] through [[Khodaafarin Bridges|Khodaafarin bridge]], to the north of [[Ordubad|Ardabad]], and headed straight to Ardabil, one of the most important towns of northern Persia. In the night, the day before "[[Eid al-Fitr|Eid]]", they surrounded Ardabil. Georgians burst into the city from all sides and seized it without a fight. The Mkhargdzeli's massacred 12,000 locals "as many as were killed in Ani", including the Sultan. By the same road, consoled, they returned victorious to Ani and appeared before the Queen Tamar.

=== Military campaign to Azarbaijan ===
The attack on Ardebil showed the Georgian leaders that they could attack [[Eldiguzids]] once more. Large Georgian forces concentrated in [[Tbilisi]], which then marched to Northern Iran, through [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]] and [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]] (vassal territories in a march), under the orders of Zakaria and Ivane Mkhargrdzeli. The Georgian army crossed the [[Aras (river)|Araxes]], entered the narrow gorge of Daraduz and marched to [[Marand]], Learning of this, the inhabitants of Marand hid themselves among the rocks. Entering Marand and finding no man there, Zakaria thought that the enemy's army was on the mountain of Marand, and he selected detachment of five hundred horsemen under the command of certain [[Taki ad-Din Tmogveli]] as their commander and sent them to the Marand Mountain. Seeing a small detachment, Marandians armed themselves, and attacked it. Poorly organized Muslims were crushed; very few of the enemy escaped, most of them  were killed, and those who fled were pursued for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;Georgian National Academy of Sciences, Kartlis Tskhovreba (History of Georgia), Artanuji pub. Tbilisi 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Zakaria posted a garrison in the town and went on to [[Tabriz]] in 1208, they crossed the mountains, known as "Devsopni". When the citizens of Tabriz learned of the appearance of the Georgian army, they were seized with terror. The frightened inhabitants of Tebriz secured themselves by paying huge contributions; especially [[Muhammad Jahan Pahlavan]]'s wife, Zahide, gave a lot of money, stones, and craftsmanship to save the city. They even provided food for the army. Georgians promised them peace and declared they would cross their lands without inflicting harm; The Georgians left guards at the city and leaving [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Adarbadagan]] went to and [[Miana, Iran|Miana]]. The [[Malik|Melik]] of Miana also asked them for peace and promised countless presents. Accumulating all kinds of riches the Georgians stationed guards at the city and left Miana in peace. From Tabriz and Miana the Georgian cavalry then rode through [[Gilan Province|Gilan]], to the small town of [[Zanjan, Iran|Zinjan]], surrounded by a wattle and daub wall, the citizens reinforced it and began to fight, however Georgians captured it by storm and received the submission. From there they continued their way to [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] and approached another large center [[Qazvin|Qazwin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ge/books?id=WjQfo3a1eVMC|title=Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1|last=Mikaberidze|first=Alexander|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1598843362|location=Santa Barbara, California, USA|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; which capitulated without a fight.

The return voyage was long, the spoils, which were looted throughout the north of Persia, did not allow them to move fast. The annihilation of the Georgian garrison by the inhabitants of Maian compelled Zakaria to revisit it again and to destroy its townsmen.

== Aftermath ==
The Georgian army returned with enormous booty; the chronicler does not conceal his surprise and delight over the huge quantity of precious stones, rugs, gold, splendid works of art and handicraft-articles that was seized. These victories brought Georgia to the summit of its power and glory, establishing a pan-Caucasian [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian Empire]] that extended from the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] to [[Lake Van]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12987">[[File:Sticker_demanding_reparations_for_Haiti,_Port_au_Prince,_2003.jpg|thumb|Sticker in [[Port-au-Prince]] demanding repayment from the French government]]The '''external debt of Haiti''' is one of the main factors that has caused the country's persistent poverty.  After the slaves declared themselves free and the country independent in 1804, [[France]], with the complicity of its allies, demanded that the newly formed country pay the French government and French slaveholders the modern equivalent of US $21 billion dollars for the "theft" of the slaves' own lives and the land that they had turned into profitable sugar and coffee-producing plantations.  This independence debt was financed by French banks and the American [[Citibank]], and finally paid off 143 years later, in 1947.

Later, the corrupt [[Duvalier dynasty]] added to the country's debts, and is believed to have used the money to expand their power and for their personal benefits.

In the early 21st century, and especially after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake in Haiti]], the World Bank and some other governments forgave the remaining parts of Haiti's debts.  France forgave a more recent loan with a balance of US $77 million, but has refused to consider repaying the independence debt.

==Saint-Domingue==
[[Haiti]] was once the richest colonies in the [[New World]]. Under French rule, between the years of 1697 and 1804, 800,000 [[West African]] Slaves were brought to what was then known as Saint-Domingue to work on the vast plantations that produced sixty percent of France and Britain's coffee and three quarters of the world's sugar.&lt;ref name="canada-haiti.ca"&gt;https://canada-haiti.ca&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did Saint-Domingue account for one third of the entire African slave trade, but the conditions under which they lived and were treated were known to be some of the most cruel. The Saint-Domingue population reached 520,000 in 1790, and of those 425,000 were slaves.&lt;ref name="canada-haiti.ca"/&gt;

==Independence debt==
[[Haiti]]’s legacy of [[Third world debt|debt]] began shortly after [[Haitian Revolution|gaining independence]] from France in 1804. In 1825, France, with warships at the ready, demanded [[Haiti indemnity controversy|Haiti compensate France]] for its loss of slaves and its slave colony. In exchange for French recognition of Haiti as a sovereign republic, France demanded payment of 150 million francs. In addition to the payment, France required that Haiti discount its exported goods to them by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenation.com/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838, France agreed to reduce the debt to 90 million francs to be paid over a period of 30 years to compensate former plantation owners who had lost their property.&lt;ref name="odiousdebts.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odiousdebts.org/odiousdebts/index.cfm?DSP=content&amp;ContentID=9636 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112093243/http://www.odiousdebts.org/odiousdebts/index.cfm?DSP=content&amp;ContentID=9636 |archivedate=2010-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern equivalent of $21 billion was paid from Haiti to France.&lt;ref&gt;Sommers, Jeffrey. ''Race, Reality, and Realpolitik: U.S.-Haiti Relations in the Lead Up to the 1915 Occupation''. 2015. {{ISBN|1498509142}}. Page 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The transfer of wealth from Haiti to the French government and from Haiti to the various banks that financed the Independence Debt is well established. Detailed claims, submitted by former slave owners for compensation, including the monetary value of the "lost" slaves, and which formed the basis for the French government’s demands have been documented.

Likewise, the terms of the 1825 Ordinance and accounts of its negotiation have survived.

The French government finally acknowledged the payment of 90,000,000F in 1893. It took until 1947 for Haiti to finally pay off all the associated interest of the debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalresearch.ca/haiti-independence-debt-reparations-for-slavery-and-colonialism-and-international-aid/5334619 "HAITI: Independence Debt, Reparations for Slavery and Colonialism, and International Aid"]. "It took Haiti 122 years, until 1947, to pay off both the original ransom to France and the tens of millions more in interest payments borrowed from French banks to meet the deadlines."&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the first payment – 24,000,000 gold francs – being transported across Paris, from the vaults of Ternaux Gandolphe et Cie to the coffers of the [[Trésor public|French Treasury]] was recorded in detail. Historians have traced loan documents from the time of the 1825 Ordinance, through the various refinancing efforts, to the final remittance to [[National City Bank of New York|National City Bank]] in 1947.&lt;ref name="odiousdebts.org"/&gt;

==Duvalier debt==
From 1957 to 1986 Haiti was ruled by the corrupt and oppressive [[Duvalier]] family. Loans incurred during this period alone were estimated to account for approximately 40% of Haiti's debt in 2000, before [[debt relief]] was granted. These funds were used to strengthen the Duvaliers' control over Haiti and for various fraudulent schemes. Large amounts were simply stolen by the Duvaliers.

==Initiatives to cancel Haiti's debt==
[[Jubilee USA Network|Jubilee USA]], [[Jubilee Debt Campaign]] (UK)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jubileedebtcampaign.org.uk/|title=Jubilee Debt Campaign UK|website=Jubilee Debt Campaign UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others, called for the immediate cancellation of Haiti's debt to multilateral institutions, including the [[World Bank]], [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), and the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], based on the argument that this debt is unjust (under a legal term called [[odious debt]]) and that Haiti could better use the funds going towards debt service for education, health care, and basic infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jubileeusa.org/jubilee.cgi?path=%2Ftake_action&amp;page=haiti06.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-09-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208224330/http://www.jubileeusa.org/jubilee.cgi?path=%2Ftake_action&amp;page=haiti06.html |archive-date=2007-02-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several organizations in the U.S. issued [[action alert]]s around the Haiti Debt Cancellation Resolution, and a Congressional letter to the [[U.S. Treasury]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijdh.org/articles/articles/article_recent_news_2-12-08.html|title=Advocacy Our Work|website=Ijdh.org|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Jubilee USA, the [[Institute for Justice &amp; Democracy in Haiti]] and [[Pax Christi USA]].

==Debt cancellation==

This cut the face value of the debt by $757 million&lt;ref name="blogs.cgdev.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cgdev.org/globaldevelopment/2010/01/for-haitians-sake-drop-the-drop-the-debt.php|title=For Haitians' Sake, Drop the "Drop the Debt"|website=Blogs.cgdev.org|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and future debt service (including interest) by $1.2 billion.&lt;ref name="imf.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/country/2010/012710.htm|title=Haiti: Debt Statistics and IMF support - Background Note|website=Imf.org|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haiti's largest creditor, the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB), was part of the debt relief initiative, but the initiative only canceled loans made before 2005, and the IDB has lent more since. Haiti's debt to the IDB amounts to approximately half a billion dollars with debt service payments projected by the IMF to increase in the following years. The U.S. government has been paying this debt service on Haiti's behalf since before the quake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iadb.org/Haiti/index.cfm?id=6470&amp;lang=en|title=IDB - Haiti and the IDB|website=Iadb.org|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the devastating effects of the early [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake in Haiti]] there came renewed calls for a further debt cancellation from civil society groups. In light of the tragedy and new borrowing that lifted Haiti's debts back to $1.25 billion, groups such as the Jubilee Debt Campaign called for this debt to be dropped. Furthermore, during the aftermath emergency money was offered to the Haitian government from the IMF in the form of loans. Civil society groups protested the offer of loans and not grants for such an already heavily indebted country trying to cope with such destruction. Some have argued, however, that because Haiti's annual debt service payments are so low ($9 million a year, net of the debt service paid on Haiti's behalf by the U.S. government), canceling the debt would do little to help the country recover from the earthquake, and should not be a priority for activism.&lt;ref name="blogs.cgdev.org"/&gt;

[[Agence France Press]] reported on 26 January 2010 that President [[Hugo Chavez]] of [[Venezuela]] said that [[Petrocaribe]], Venezuela's cut-rate regional energy alliance, will forgive Haiti's debt. Haiti's debt with Venezuela is $295 million, about one-quarter of its foreign debt of $1.25 billion, according to International Monetary Fund figures.&lt;ref name="imf.org"/&gt;

On 28 May 2010, the [[World Bank]] announced it had waived Haiti's remaining debts to the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hCK-vVemjKRHTm0wfzIcLFXBgdnA|title=World Bank cancels Haiti's debt|date=29 May 2010|work=AFP|accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the waiver was $36 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2818522520100528?type=marketsNews|title=World Bank cancels remaining Haiti debt|date=28 May 2010|work=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=30 May 2010 | first=Lesley | last=Wroughton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, France forgave about US $77 million in a modern debt, unrelated to independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-32715493|title=Hollande pledges Haiti investment|date=2015-05-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-07-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, the Haitian government demanded that France repay Haiti for the millions of dollars paid between 1825 and 1947 as compensation for the slaves' freedom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 2015, the French government rejected this plan and said that it would consider investing in the country.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/France-Clarifies-It-Wont-Repay-Haitis-Independence-Debt-20150511-0032.html|title=France Confirms Will Not Repay Haiti 'Independence Debt'|last=|first=|date=12 May 2015|work=TelesurTV|access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Barack Obama sidebar}}
The '''first inauguration of Barack Obama''' as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|44th]] [[President of the United States]] took place on Tuesday, January 20, 2009. The [[Inauguration of the President of the United States|inauguration]], which set a record attendance for any event held in Washington, D.C., marked the commencement of the first four-year term of [[Barack Obama]] as President and [[Joe Biden]] as Vice President. Based on the combined attendance numbers, television viewership, and Internet traffic, it was among the most-observed events ever by the global audience.

"A&amp;nbsp;New Birth of Freedom", a phrase from the [[Gettysburg Address]], served as the inaugural theme to commemorate the 200th&amp;nbsp;anniversary of the birth year of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. In his speeches to the crowds, Obama referred to ideals expressed by Lincoln about renewal, continuity and national unity. Obama mentioned these ideals in his speech to stress the need for shared sacrifice and a new sense of responsibility to answer America's challenges at home and abroad.

Obama and others paid homage to Lincoln in the form of tributes and references during several of the events, starting with a commemorative train tour from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], to Washington,&amp;nbsp;D.C. on January 17, 2009. The inaugural events held in Washington from January 18 to 21, 2009, included concerts, a national day of community service on [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]], the swearing-in ceremony, luncheon and parade, inaugural balls, and the interfaith [[Prayers at United States presidential inaugurations|inaugural prayer service]]. The [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|presidential oath]] as administered to Obama during his swearing-in ceremony on January 20 strayed slightly from the oath of office prescribed in the [[United States Constitution]], which led to its re‑administration the next day.

In addition to a larger than usual celebrity attendance, the [[Presidential Inaugural Committee]] increased its outreach to ordinary citizens to encourage greater participation in inaugural events compared with participation in recent past inaugurations. For the first time, the committee opened the entire length of the [[National Mall]] as the public viewing area for the swearing-in ceremony, breaking with the tradition of past inaugurations. Selected American citizens participated in the train tour and other inaugural events, and a philanthropist organized a People's Inaugural Ball for disadvantaged people who otherwise would be unable to afford to attend the inaugural festivities. Among the celebrations for the inauguration, the committee hosted a first-ever Neighborhood Inaugural Ball with free or affordable tickets for ordinary citizens.

By definition, the inauguration marked the formal culmination of the [[presidential transition of Barack Obama]] that began when he won the United States [[United States presidential election, 2008|presidential election]] on [[Election Day (United States)|November 4, 2008]] and became the [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]].&lt;ref name='NYT-Nagourney-2008-11-04'&gt;{{cite news | first= Adam | last= Nagourney | authorlink=Adam Nagourney | title= Obama Wins Election | date= November 4, 2008 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/us/politics/05elect.html | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = November 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 6: Compensation, privileges, and restrictions on holding civil office|Article&amp;nbsp;I, Section&amp;nbsp;6]] of the [[United States Constitution]], Obama resigned from the [[United States Senate]] effective November 16, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Letter of resignation from Barack Obama to [[Richard Cheney]], November 18, 2008; published in the ''[[Congressional Record]]'', November 19, 2008, page S10609 ([http://frwebgate1.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/PDFgate.cgi?WAISdocID=557516393307+3+2+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve Communication from the Honorable Barack Obama]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama sets date to leave Senate|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/us_elections_2008/7728466.stm|date=November 13, 2008|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=November 14, 2008}}

&lt;!--Section is being added to address the following concern: An integral element missing to this article is why this was such a notable event, why it attracted the audience it did, which was a combination of the first black president the US has ever had, and the great sigh of relief that Bush was finally leaving. The raucous celebrations that took place throughout the world upon the Obama's elections were credited to both of these causes. I think the article should start with a brief overview of the campaigns and the results of the election, including a description of the running in the streets and honking of cars etc., that occurred in many locations on election night, plus the incredible problems Obama took on from the previous administration. This ties in with the new day themes of his speeches on the train rides and why he would address crisis issues in the inauguration speech. I think it's notable that Bush was the first president since Jimmy Carter, who surprised the Secret Service by walking from the Capitol to the White House, by not walking since his limo was pelted by eggs from parade attendees. As the first black president, there were some serious concerns about Obama's safety if he decided to get out and walk, which he did. Let me know if you have questions.
 I understand that, but the lead and the entire event surrounds the throng of people, the high price of tickets, the large global audience...for a presidential inauguration? As if Obama's just another president? Well he is, but he's also the first black president and the result of a massive political shove to the previous 8-year administration. I think these issues, with the political tone of his speeches in light of the 2 wars and the near-depression he inherited are integral to the article. An immense amount of pressure was placed on Obama to fix everything, to be the panacea for Americans and this came out ceremonially in his inauguration. Can you update this sentence: ''No one from the crowds at the swearing-in ceremony and parade was arrested as of 6:00 p.m. EST on Inauguration Day''--&gt;

Obama, who originally campaigned using the slogan "Change We Can Believe In" and later "Change We Need",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/09/obamas-change-s.html|title=Obama's 'Change' Slogan Gets a Change|accessdate=February 18, 2010|date=September 13, 2008|publisher=[[ABC News]] Internet Ventures|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224030927/http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/09/obamas-change-s.html|archivedate=February 24, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; was widely celebrated as the first [[African American]] president of the United States and a symbol of change from his [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] predecessor, [[George W.

He inherited what [[Peter Orszag]] termed an "economic mess" that became known as the [[late-2000s financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/03/08/Orszag-Obama-inherited-economic-woes/UPI-85971236559252/|title=Orszag: Obama inherited economic woes|accessdate=February 18, 2010|date=March 8, 2009|agency=United Press International}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[CNN]] poll, he embodied youthful energy and transition at a time of economic despair, and inspired more confidence than his immediate predecessors.&lt;ref name=kdn/&gt;

==Planning==
[[File:ObamaInaugurationCapitolPreparation.jpg|thumb|alt=U.S. Capitol at dusk, mostly darkened but with dome floodlit from within|Preparations at the [[United States Capitol]]|left]]
The inauguration was planned primarily by two committees: the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies]] and the 2009&amp;nbsp;Presidential Inaugural Committee. Although the election was scheduled for November 4, 2008, the congressional committee began construction of the inaugural platform on September 24, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title= Construction of 2009 Inaugural Platform Begins with the Ceremonial Driving of the 'First Nail' | date= September 24, 2008 | publisher=[[United States Congress Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|United States Congress Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies]] | url = http://inaugural.senate.gov/media/releases/release-09242008-inauguralwebsite.cfm | accessdate = June 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joint Congressional Committee===
The swearing-in ceremony and the inaugural luncheon for [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] Obama and Vice President-elect Biden were planned by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, a committee composed of [[United States Senator]]s [[Dianne Feinstein]], committee chair, [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]] and [[Harry Reid]], and [[United States Representative]]s [[John Boehner]], [[Steny Hoyer]] and [[Nancy Pelosi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inaugural.senate.gov/cmte/membershiphistory.cfm |title=Membership of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies |accessdate=February 11, 2010 |publisher=[[United States Senate]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105232002/http://inaugural.senate.gov/cmte/membershiphistory.cfm |archivedate=January 5, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee is overseen by the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration|U.S.&amp;nbsp;Senate Committee on Rules and Administration]].

The congressional committee released the full schedule of the January 20 inaugural events on December 17, 2008. The inauguration schedule referred to the President‑elect as "Barack&amp;nbsp;H. Obama", although Obama specified previously that he intended to use his full name for his swearing-in ceremony, including his middle name [[Husayn|Hussein]].&lt;ref name=ItRNBfUD&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,467607,00.html|title=Obama to Resurrect Middle Name for Inauguration Day|accessdate=December 21, 2008|date=December 16, 2008|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama decided to use his full name "Barack Hussein Obama" to "follow the tradition, not trying to make a statement one way or the other" for the inaugural ceremony.&lt;ref name=IBHODSS&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/sleuth/2008/12/president-elect_obama_has_said.html|title=I Barack Hussein Obama Do Solemnly Swear...|accessdate=February 9, 2009|date=December 18, 2008|work=[[The Washington Post]]|author=Akers, Mary Beth}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|election]] campaign, Obama's detractors tried to use his middle name to imply falsely that he was a Muslim.&lt;ref name=IBHODSS/&gt;

===Presidential Inaugural Committee===
The 2009&amp;nbsp;Presidential Inaugural Committee organized several other inauguration‑related events at the direction of the President‑elect and Vice President‑elect of the United States, such as the train ride, concerts, parade, balls and prayer service. The co-chairs of the committee were [[William M. Daley|William Daley]], [[Penny Pritzker]], [[John W.

Despite criticism that such a large event could not be [[carbon footprint|carbon-friendly]], the presidential committee incorporated [[Zero waste|environment-friendly]] measures in its planning of the inaugural events.

}}Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] administered the [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|oath of office]] to Obama. Michelle Obama held the [[Lincoln Bible|Bible]], which was used by Abraham Lincoln at his 1861 inauguration, as Barack Obama placed his hand on the Bible and recited the presidential oath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/23/obama-to-take-oath-on-same-bible-as-lincoln/|title=Obama to Take Oath on Same Bible as Lincoln|author=Seelye, Katherine Q.|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 23, 2008|accessdate=March 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2008/12/60345332/ |title=Obama to be sworn in on Lincoln Bible|last=Memmott|first=Mark|date=December 23, 2008|work=USA Today|accessdate=December 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly four years earlier, then-Senator Obama had been one of 22 Senators to vote against Roberts during [[John Roberts Supreme Court nomination|Roberts' Supreme Court nomination]]; the inauguration marked the first time a Chief Justice administered the oath to a President-elect who had previously voted against the Chief Justice's confirmation.&lt;ref name=OCJRSiRoPO/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28753348/|title=Roberts and Obama seal deal, with a stumble: Chief Justice and new president come from vastly different perspectives|accessdate=July 1, 2012|date=January 2, 2009|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts and Obama made several mistakes as they recited the oath. The proper wording for the oath of office is prescribed in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]:
{{quote|text=I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.&lt;ref name="oathflub"/&gt;}}

Roberts had practiced for the ceremony carefully. However, a memo noting his planned pauses in the recitation of the oath failed to reach Obama's staff before the swearing-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Toobin|first=Jeffrey|title=How Obama, Roberts Interpret Laws In 'The Oath'|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/17/161144225/oba|work=Fresh Air (WHYY)|publisher=NPR|accessdate=January 21, 2013|date=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Toobin|first=Jeffrey|title=The Oath: The Obama White House and the Supreme Court|year=2012|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=978-0385527200|pages=7–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, Obama inadvertently interrupted Roberts during the first phrase, stating "I, Barack" while Roberts was finishing "do solemnly swear". Obama then correctly repeated the entire phrase "I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear."

Roberts, who was not using notes, rendered the next phrase as "that I will execute the office of president to the United States faithfully," misplacing the word ''faithfully'' and saying ''president to'' instead of ''president of''. Obama repeated, "that I will execute", then paused. Roberts attempted to correct the wording, but stumbled: "the off– faithfully the pres– the office of President of the United States." Obama then repeated Roberts' initial incorrect wording.&lt;ref name=OCJRSiRoPO&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/01/20/chief-justice-roberts-officiates-inauguration/|title=Obama, Chief Justice Roberts Stumble in Recitation of Presidential Oath: Chief Justice John Roberts officiated over his first inauguration Tuesday by swearing in President-elect Barack Obama as president of the United States.|accessdate=February 1, 2009|date=January 20, 2009|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oathflub"&gt;{{cite news|first=Pete |last=Williams |title=About That oath flub |url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/01/20/1751351.aspx |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=January 20, 2009 |accessdate=January 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121194437/http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/01/20/1751351.aspx |archivedate=January 21, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President Obama 2009 Inaugural Ceremony|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/283479-1|publisher=[[C-SPAN]]|accessdate=April 1, 2012|format=Video|date=January 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts ended the presidential oath by appending the phrase "so help you God" to the end of the constitutionally prescribed oath, and Obama responded "[[Oath of office of the President of the United States#"So help me God"|so help me God]]" when he was prompted. Obama had asked previously to include "so help me God" after the oath.&lt;ref name="Mears"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/01/09/obama-to-asked-to-say-so-help-me-god-at-swearing-in/|title=Obama has asked to say 'so help me God' at swearing-in|author=Mears, Bill|work=Political Ticker|publisher=[[Cable News Network]]|date=January 9, 2009|accessdate=March 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts then congratulated Obama as the new President.&lt;ref name="oathflub"/&gt;

Much public discussion arose about the errors in administering and reciting the oath.  Several constitutional scholars said that Obama should retake the oath.  [[Boston University]] constitutional scholar Jack Beermann suggested that while the courts would likely never even consider a challenge, he would still advise Obama to retake the oath if he were his lawyer since "the Constitution says what he's supposed to say."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/01/20/MNAF15E20I.DTL|title=Experts say Obama should retake the oath|last=Lochhead|first=Carolyn|date=January 21, 2009|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle|San&amp;nbsp;Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=April 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although [[Robert Gibbs]], [[White House press secretary]], indicated at first that President Obama did not plan to retake the oath,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/01/21/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry4744187.shtml|title=No Plans For Obama To Retake Oath|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=January 21, 2009|accessdate=February 16, 2009 | first=Mark | last=Knoller}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice Roberts agreed to re-administer the oath at the request of [[White House counsel]] [[Greg Craig]]. The second oath ceremony took place on the evening of January 21, 2009 in the [[Map Room (White House)|Map Room]] of the [[White House]] before a small audience of presidential aides, reporters and a White House photographer.&lt;ref name=NYTretake&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/us/politics/22oath.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=oath%20of%20office%20retake&amp;st=cse|title=I Really Do Swear, Faithfully: Obama and Roberts Try Again | author=Zeleny, Jeff|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=March 1, 2009|date=January 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/01/21/obama-re-takes-oath-of-office-at-the-white-house/|title=Obama re-takes oath of office at the White House|accessdate=February 1, 2009|date=January 21, 2009|work=Political Ticker|publisher=[[Cable News Network]]|author=Mears, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig said that the White House ultimately decided to re-administer the oath out of an abundance of caution.

====Inaugural address====
A central theme of President Obama's inaugural address was a call to restore responsibility—both in terms of accountability in Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/20/barack-obama-inauguration-us-speech|title=Obama inauguration: Words of history&amp;nbsp;... crafted by 27-year-old in Starbucks|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=United Kingdom|date=January 20, 2009|accessdate=March 4, 2009 | first=Ed | last=Pilkington}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/01/18/responsibility-theme-obamas-inauguration-speech-aides-say/|title=Responsibility is the Theme of Obama's Inauguration Speech, Aides Say|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]|date=January 18, 2009|accessdate=March 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama's address did not have memorable sound bite phrases. Instead, he used traditional references to connect his new administration with the nation's history in a speech that was understated deliberately, according to rhetoric expert James Mackin.&lt;ref name=mackin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tulane.edu/news/newwave/012309_inaugural_address.cfm |title=Inaugural Speech Focuses on Tradition |work=New Wave |publisher=[[Tulane University]] |date=January 23, 2009 |accessdate=March 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710120413/http://tulane.edu/news/newwave/012309_inaugural_address.cfm |archivedate=July 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama concluded the second paragraph of his address by saying, "we the people have remained faithful&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;the ideals of our forebears and true to our founding documents." The speech reinforced words such as "legacy" and "heritage", as well as values such as "honesty", "courage" and "patriotism", which "are old" values. Near the end of the speech, Obama referred to words written by [[Thomas Paine]] in ''[[The American Crisis]]'', which were ordered by [[George Washington]] to be read to his troops: "Let it be told to the future world&amp;nbsp;... that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive&amp;nbsp;... that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it]." Because Obama's [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|campaign]] message focused on the need for change, Mackin noted that Obama sought to reassure Americans that he would operate as President within the margins of the nation's traditions.&lt;ref name=mackin/&gt;

Obama's goal for his Inaugural speech was to stir the following response among Americans: "This is why I want to go into public service and be a better politician. This is why I want to go home and be a better parent, better worker, better citizen." &lt;ref&gt;Alter, Jonathan. ''The Promise President Obama, Year One''. Simon &amp; Schuster, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-4391-0119-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of Obama's call for responsibility, he said "what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility—a recognition, on the part of every American" and "those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account." Obama quoted the lyrics of the [[Jerome Kern]] and [[Dorothy Fields]] song "[[Pick Yourself Up]]" from the [[musical film|musical]] [[comedy film|comedy]] [[Swing Time (1936 film)|''Swing Time'']], saying that "starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America."&lt;ref name="boston_globe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2009/01/obama_calls_for_3.html|title=Obama calls for American renewal|author=Foon Rhee|date=January 20, 2009|accessdate=March 4, 2009|work=[[Boston Globe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for ''The New York Times'', columnist and former drama critic [[Frank Rich]] noted the link to the lyric in Field's song from the movie, writing that Obama offered in his address "one subtle whiff of the [[Great Depression]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/opinion/25rich.html|title=No time for poetry|author=Rich, Frank|date=January 25, 2009|accessdate=August 3, 2013|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama's speech contained several [[bible|biblical]] references and was compared to oratory of the "[[black church]] tradition." Obama also highlighted the United States' religious diversity, referring to the country's "patchwork heritage" as a strength and saying, "We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and non-believers." This was the first time a United States President acknowledged [[Irreligion in the United States|American non-believers]] in an inaugural address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-01-20-obama-non-believers_N.htm|title=An inaugural first: Obama acknowledges 'non-believers'|accessdate=February 2, 2010|date=January 22, 2009|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Grossman, Cathy Lynn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama's inaugural address received mixed reviews, with some describing the tone of the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking,&lt;ref name=WpBOia&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/21/nation/na-inaug-literati21 |title=Writers praise Barack Obama's inaugural address|accessdate=February 8, 2009|date=January 21, 2009|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Reynolds, Susan Salter}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched.&lt;ref name=OIADSC&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/21/obamas-inaugural-address_n_159713.html|title=Obama's Inaugural Address Draws Some Criticism|accessdate=February 8, 2009|date=January 21, 2009|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|first=Stuart|last=Whatley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents George&amp;nbsp;W.

====Prayers====
Obama's selections of Warren and Lowery to deliver prayers for the inaugural ceremony were controversial. Warren had a history of vocal opposition to [[same-sex marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28733017/|title=Gay rights protest held outside Warren church: Marchers decry pastor's selection as Obama inauguration speaker|accessdate=March 7, 2009|date=January 19, 2009|publisher=[[MSNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lowery had a background as a [[civil rights]] activist.&lt;ref name=WLtdib&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncronline.org/node/2853|title=Warren, Lowery to deliver inauguration blessings |accessdate=March 7, 2009|date=December 18, 2008|work=[[National Catholic Reporter]]|author=Banks, Adelle M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Obama nor Warren made references during the inaugural program to issues of direct concern to the gay community.

One of his messages was the statement that "as we leave this mountaintop, help us to hold on to the spirit of fellowship and the oneness of our family." Lowery concluded the benediction with a humorous message of anticipation for the day "when [[brown people|brown]] can stick around, when [[Mongoloid race|yellow]] will be mellow, when the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|red man]] can get ahead man and when [[Caucasian race|white]] would embrace what is right".&lt;ref name=LB/&gt;

After the inaugural ceremony, President Obama, [[First Lady]] [[Michelle Obama]], Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden escorted former President [[George W. Bush]] and former First Lady [[Laura Bush]] to a departure ceremony on the east side of the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Capitol.

====Luncheon====
As former President and Mrs. Bush began their journey to their [[Texas]] home, the Obamas and Bidens joined several congressional guests for the inaugural luncheon in [[National Statuary Hall]] at the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Capitol. Guests included top Washington lawmakers as well as former Presidents and Vice Presidents. Commemorating the [[Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial]], the red and white china used during the luncheon were [[replica]]s of those used in the Lincoln White House.&lt;ref name=thehill&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike|last=Soraghan|title=Obama's Inauguration makes tourists out of lawmakers |url=http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/obamas-inauguration-makes-tourists-out-of-lawmakers-2009-01-20.html |work= [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=January 20, 2009 |accessdate=February 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A luncheon at the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Capitol has been part of the inaugural program since 1953 (before that time, the luncheon was usually held at the White House and hosted by the outgoing President and First Lady). The menu for the 2009 inaugural luncheon, which often features dishes representative of the home states of the new President and Vice President, included seafood stew, duck and [[pheasant]] entrees with [[Pinot noir]] wine, and a dessert of apple cinnamon [[sponge cake]] with sweet cream [[Candied fruit|glacé]]. Since 1985, a painting has served as a backdrop for the head table. For the 2009 inaugural luncheon, the featured painting was [[Thomas Hill (painter)|Thomas Hill's]] 1865 ''View of the Yosemite Valley'', a painting that commemorated Abraham Lincoln's 1864 signing of the [[Yosemite National Park#Yosemite Grant|Yosemite Grant]], which was the first time the federal government protected park lands for public use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inaugural.senate.gov/luncheon/|title= Inauguration of the President: Luncheon|publisher=[[United States Congress Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|United States Congress Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies]]|accessdate=February 16, 2009}}

Prayers for the service drew from passages from the [[First inauguration of George Washington|1789 inauguration]] prayer service of George Washington and the 1865&amp;nbsp;inaugural address of Abraham Lincoln, including phrases such as "with malice toward none, with charity for all".&lt;ref name="prayersvc"/&gt; The featured sermon for the inaugural prayer service was delivered by Reverend Sharon&amp;nbsp;E.

No official count was taken of the number of people attending the inaugural ceremony, although multiple sources concluded that the ceremony had the largest audience of any event ever held in Washington,&amp;nbsp;D.C. Government agencies and federal officials, who coordinated security and traffic management, determined the attendance count to be 1.8&amp;nbsp;million people based on information collected by several cameras and individuals on the ground.

The 1,120,000 estimated Metrorail riders broke the record of 866,681 trips set the day before (which had broken the record set on July 11, 2008), and marked the first million trip day in the system's history. Metro also provided 423,000 bus trips and 1,721 MetroAccess trips for a total of 1,544,721 trips, the highest ridership day ever in the transit authority’s history.&lt;ref name="Metro"/&gt; As of October 2018, the inauguration day crowd is still the largest in Metrorail history, but the [[2017 Women's March]] has the highest counted, not estimated, single day ridership of 1,001,613. In addition, the Sunday events helped Metro set a Sunday single-day record of 616,324 that is still largest Sunday crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Metrorail sets new Sunday record for highest ridership |url=https://www.wmata.com/about/news/pressreleasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=2429 |accessdate=October 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security===
As with the 54th and 55th Presidential Inaugurations, in 2001 and 2005, respectively, the 56th Presidential Inauguration in 2009 was designated as a [[National Special Security Event]] (NSSE), resulting in the United States Secret Service being the lead Federal agency for the development and implementation of the overall security plan;&lt;ref&gt;Title 18 United States Code, Section 3056&lt;/ref&gt; the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) being the lead Federal agency for counter terrorism, intelligence, and criminal investigation; and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) being the lead Federal agency for crisis management in the aftermath of any terrorist attack, natural disaster or other catastrophic incident. The United States Capitol Police had primary responsibility for security and emergency response within the Capitol Complex to include the Inaugural Platform and the Inaugural Luncheon.  The NSSE designation was made by Michael Chertoff, Secretary of Homeland Security, on December 10, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 7&lt;/ref&gt; The inauguration took place in an era of enhanced security in the decade following the [[September 11 attacks]]. Because of the size of the crowds expected in Washington,&amp;nbsp;D.C. for the inaugural activities, planners raised concerns about public safety and security. [[U.S. Army|Army]] [[General (United States)|General]] Richard Rowe, head of the joint military task force for the Washington, D.C. area, explained that security forces had to stretch their imagination to anticipate previously unthinkable security threats, especially in light of the [[2008 Mumbai attacks|Mumbai attacks]] in [[India]] that occurred in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/19/2469096.htm|title=Obama security team 'prepared for unthinkable'|date=January 19, 2009|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting News]]|accessdate=April 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attention was heightened by terrorist threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/magazine/17Terror-t.html?ref=magazine|title=Obama's War Over Terror |author=Baker, Peter|accessdate=January 18, 2010|date=January 4, 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police presence in the District of Columbia temporarily doubled, augmented by the addition of 8,000&amp;nbsp;police officers from around the United States.

No one from the crowds at the swearing-in ceremony or parade was arrested on Inauguration Day.

More than a dozen counter-sniper teams were stationed along the inauguration parade route in response, and the criminal records of nearby employees and hotel guests were scrutinized, but no such attack took place. Kessler also reported a number of perceived inadequacies in the security during the inauguration, including an instance in which more than 100 major campaign donors and VIPs were able to board "secure" buses without being checked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Harnden |first=Toby |title=Barack Obama faces 30 death threats a day, stretching US Secret Service |date=August 3, 2009 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/5967942/Barack-Obama-faces-30-death-threats-a-day-stretching-US-Secret-Service.html |accessdate=August 9, 2009 | location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Obama inaugural events achieved an average U.S.&amp;nbsp;television viewership of 37.8&amp;nbsp;million across both broadcast networks and cable channels, viewership for the events was lower than the U.S.&amp;nbsp;television viewership for the 1981 Reagan inaugural festivities, which averaged 41.8&amp;nbsp;million across the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]] and [[NBC]] broadcast networks alone.&lt;ref name="viewers"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jan/22/ustelevision-barackobama|title=Barack Obama's inauguration watched by 40m Americans|accessdate=January 23, 2009|date=January 22, 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=United Kingdom|author=Luft, Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[international community]] paid unprecedented attention to the inauguration of Barack Obama. Millions of people, including citizens of numerous countries around the world and American [[expatriate]]s living in those countries, watched the Obama inauguration live on television and on the Internet.

{{History of China|BC=1}}

The '''Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period''' was an era of political upheaval in 10th-century [[history of China|Imperial China]]. Five states quickly succeeded one another in the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]], and more than a dozen concurrent states were established elsewhere, mainly in [[South China]]. It was the last prolonged period of multiple political division in Chinese imperial history.&lt;ref name=Dudbridge /&gt;

Traditionally, the era started with the fall of the [[Tang dynasty]] in 907 AD and ended with the founding of the [[Song dynasty]] in 960. Many states had been ''[[de facto]]'' independent kingdoms long before 907. After the Tang had collapsed, the kings who controlled the Central plain crowned themselves as emperors. War between kingdoms occurred frequently to gain control of the central plain for legitimacy and then over the rest of China. The last of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms states, the [[Northern Han]], was not vanquished until 979.

==States==
{{main|Timeline of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms}}

== Background ==

Towards the end of the Tang, the imperial government granted increased powers to the [[jiedushi]], the regional military governors. The [[Huang Chao|Huang Chao Rebellion]] weakened the imperial government, and by the early 10th century the jiedushi commanded ''de facto'' independence from its authority. In the last decades of the dynasty, they were not even appointed by the court any more, but developed hereditary systems, from father to son or from patron to protégé. They had their own armies rivalling the "palace armies" and amassed huge wealth, as testified by their sumptuous tombs.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/Historical_Records_of_the_Five_Dynasties.html?id=CMkzCgAAQBAJ|title=Historical Records of the Five Dynasties|pages=LV-LXV|author=Xiu Ouyang|publisher=Columbia  University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780231128278|translator=Richard L. Davis}} The information was taken from Richard L. Davis's introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ensued the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period.

== Five Dynasties==

===Later Liang===
{{main|Later Liang (Five Dynasties)}}
[[File:Li Cheng Buddhist Temple in Moutain All.jpg|thumb|Painting by Chinese artist [[Li Cheng (painter)|Li Cheng]] (c. 919–967)]]

During the Tang Dynasty, the warlord [[Zhu Wen]] held the most power in southern China. Although he was originally a member of [[Huang Chao]]'s rebel army, he took on a crucial role in suppressing the Huang Chao Rebellion. For this function, he was awarded the [[Xuanwu Jiedushi]] title. Within a few years, he had consolidated his power by destroying neighbours and forcing the move of the imperial capital to [[Luoyang]], which was within his region of influence. In 904, he executed [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang]] and made his 13-year-old son a subordinate ruler. Three years later, he induced the boy emperor to abdicate in his favour. He then proclaimed himself emperor, thus beginning the [[Later Liang (Five Dynasties)|Later Liang]].

===Later Tang===
{{main|Later Tang}}

During the final years of the Tang Dynasty, rival warlords declared independence in the provinces they governed—not all of which recognized the emperor's authority. [[Li Cunxu]] and [[Liu Shouguang]] (劉守光) fiercely fought the regime forces to conquer northern China; [[Li Cunxu]] succeeded. He defeated [[Liu Shouguang]] (who had proclaimed a [[Yan (Five Dynasties)|Yan]] Empire in 911) in 915, and declared himself emperor in 923; within a few months, he brought down the Later Liang regime. Thus began the [[Shatuo]] [[Later Tang]] — the first in a long line of [[conquest dynasties]].  After reuniting much of northern China, in 925 Cunxu conquered the [[Former Shu]], a regime that had been set up in [[Sichuan]].

===Later Jin===
{{main|Later Jin (Five Dynasties)}}

The Later Tang had a few years of relative calm, followed by unrest.  In 934, Sichuan again asserted independence.  In 936, [[Shi Jingtang]], a [[Shatuo]] [[jiedushi]] from [[Taiyuan]], was aided by the ethnic-[[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao dynasty]] in a rebellion against the Later Tang.  In return for their aid, Shi Jingtang promised annual tribute and the [[Sixteen Prefectures]] (modern northern [[Hebei]] and [[Beijing]]) to the Khitans. The rebellion succeeded; Shi Jingtang became emperor in this same year.

Not long after the founding of the Later Jin, the Khitans came to regard the emperor as a proxy ruler for [[China proper]]. In 943, the Khitans declared war and within three years seized the capital, [[Kaifeng]], marking the end of Later Jin. But while they had conquered vast regions of China, the Khitans were unable or unwilling to control those regions and retreated from them early in the next year.

===Later Han===
{{main|Later Han (Five Dynasties)}}
[[File:Xvxi1.jpg|thumb|''[[Butterfly]] and [[Wisteria]] Flowers'', by [[Xu Xi (painter)|Xu Xi]] (886&amp;ndash;974)]]

To fill the power vacuum, the jiedushi [[Liu Zhiyuan]] entered the imperial capital in 947 and proclaimed the advent of the [[Later Han (Five Dynasties)|Later Han]], establishing a third successive Shatuo reign. This was the shortest of the five dynasties. Following a coup in 951, General [[Guo Wei]], a [[Han Chinese]], was enthroned, thus beginning the [[Later Zhou]]. However, [[Liu Chong]], a member of the Later Han imperial family, established a rival [[Northern Han]] regime in [[Taiyuan]] and requested Khitan aid to defeat the Later Zhou.

===Later Zhou===
{{main|Later Zhou}}
After the death of [[Guo Wei]] in 951, his adopted son [[Chai Rong]] succeeded the throne and began a policy of expansion and reunification. In 954, his army defeated combined Khitan and Northern Han forces, ending their ambition of toppling the Later Zhou. Between 956 and 958, forces of Later Zhou conquered much of [[Southern Tang]], the most powerful regime in southern China, which ceded all the territory north of the [[Yangtze]] in defeat. In 959, Chai Rong attacked the Liao in an attempt to recover territories ceded during the Later Jin.  After many victories, he succumbed to illness.

In 960, the general [[Zhao Kuangyin]] staged a coup and took the throne for himself, founding the [[Northern Song Dynasty]]. This is the official end of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. During the next two decades, Zhao Kuangyin and his successor [[Zhao Kuangyi]] defeated the other remaining regimes in China proper, conquering [[Northern Han]] in 979, and reunifying China completely in 982.

===Northern Han===
{{main|Northern Han}}
Though considered one of the ten kingdoms, the [[Northern Han]] was based in the traditional Shatuo stronghold of [[Shanxi]].  It was created after the last of three dynasties created by [[Shatuo Turks]] fell to the Han-governed [[Later Zhou]] in 951. With the protection of the powerful Liao, the Northern Han maintained nominal independence until the Song Dynasty wrested it from the Khitan in 979.

== Ten Kingdoms ==

Unlike the dynasties of northern China, which succeeded one another in rapid succession, the regimes of [[South China]] were generally concurrent, each controlling a specific geographical area.  These were known as "The Ten Kingdoms".

===Wu===
The Kingdom of [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu]] (902–937) was established in modern-day [[Jiangsu]], [[Anhui]], and [[Jiangxi]].  It was founded by [[Yang Xingmi]], who became a [[Tang Dynasty]] military governor in 892. The capital was initially at Guangling (present-day [[Yangzhou]]) and later moved to Jinling (present-day [[Nanjing]]). The kingdom fell in 937 when it was taken from within by the founder of the [[Southern Tang]].

===Wuyue===
The Kingdom of [[Wuyue]] was the longest-lived (907–978) and among the most powerful of the southern states. [[Wuyue]] was known for its learning and culture. It was founded by [[Qian Liu]], who set up his capital at Xifu (modern-day [[Hangzhou]]).  It was based mostly in modern Zhejiang province but also held parts of southern [[Jiangsu]]. [[Qian Liu]] was named the Prince of Yue by the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] emperor in 902; the Prince of Wu was added in 904.  After the fall of the [[Tang Dynasty]] in 907, he declared himself king of [[Wuyue]]. Wuyue survived until the eighteenth year of the [[Song dynasty]], when Qian Shu surrendered to the expanding dynasty.

===Min===
The Kingdom of [[Min (Ten Kingdoms)|Min]] (909–945) was founded by Wang Shenzhi, who named himself the Prince of Min  with its capital at Changle (present-day [[Fuzhou]]).  One of Shenzhi’s sons proclaimed the independent state of Yin in the northeast of Min territory.  The [[Southern Tang]] took that territory after the Min asked for help.  Despite declaring loyalty to the neighboring [[Wuyue]], the [[Southern Tang]] finished its conquest of Min in 945.

===Southern Han===
The [[Southern Han]] (917–971) was founded in [[Guangzhou]] (also known as Canton) by [[Liu Yan (Southern Han)|Liu Yan]].  His brother, [[Liu Yin (Southern Han)|Liu Yin]], was named regional governor by the Tang court.  The kingdom included [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], and [[Hainan]].

===Chu===
The [[Chu (Ten Kingdoms)|Chu]] (927–951) was founded by [[Ma Yin]] with the capital at [[Changsha]].  The kingdom held Hunan and northeastern [[Guangxi]].  Ma was named regional military governor by the Tang court in 896, and named himself the Prince of Chu with the fall of the Tang in 907.  This status as the Prince of Chu was confirmed by the Southern Tang in 927.  The [[Southern Tang]] absorbed the state in 951 and moved the royal family to its capital in [[Nanjing]], although Southern Tang rule of the region was temporary, as the next year former Chu military officers under the leadership of [[Liu Yan (Ten Kingdoms)|Liu Yan]] seized the territory.  In the waning years of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, the region was ruled by [[Zhou Xingfeng]].

===Northern Han===
The [[Northern Han]] was founded by Liu Min (劉旻), formerly known as Liu Chong (劉崇), and lasted from 951 to 979.
It had its capital at [[Taiyuan]].

===Jingnan (also known as Nanping)===
The smallest of the southern states, [[Jingnan]] (924–963), was founded by [[Gao Jichang]].  It was based in Jiangling and held two other districts southwest of present-day [[Wuhan]] in [[Hubei]].  Gao was in the service of the [[Later Liang (Five Dynasties)|Later Liang]] (the successor of the Tang in North China). Gao’s successors claimed the title of King of Nanping after the fall of the Later Liang in 924.  It was a small and weak kingdom, and thus tried to maintain good relations with each of the Five Dynasties.  The kingdom fell to advancing armies of the Song in 963.

===Former Shu===
[[Former Shu]] (907–25) was founded after the fall of the Tang Dynasty by Wang Jian, who held his court in [[Chengdu]].  The kingdom held most of present-day [[Sichuan]], western [[Hubei]], and parts of southern [[Gansu]] and [[Shaanxi]].  Wang was named military governor of western Sichuan by the Tang court in 891.  The kingdom fell when his son surrendered in the face of an advance by the [[Later Tang]] in 925.

===Later Shu===
The [[Later Shu]] (935–965) is essentially a resurrection of the previous Shu state that had fallen a decade earlier to the [[Later Tang]].  Because the Later Tang was in decline, Meng Zhixiang found the opportunity to reassert Shu’s independence.  Like the Former Shu, the capital was at Chengdu and it basically controlled the same territory as its predecessor.  The kingdom was ruled well until forced to succumb to Song armies in 965.

===Southern Tang===
{{main|Southern Tang}}
[[Image:Zhou Wenju's A Literary Garden.jpg|thumb|''A Literary Garden'', by [[Zhou Wenju]], [[Southern Tang]].]]

The [[Southern Tang]] (937–975) was the successor state of [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu]] as [[Emperor Liezu of Southern Tang|Li Bian]] (Emperor Liezu) took the state over from within in 937.  Expanding from the original domains of [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu]], it eventually took over Yin, Min, and Chu, holding present-day southern Anhui, southern Jiangsu, much of Jiangxi, Hunan, and eastern Hubei at its height.  The kingdom became nominally subordinate to the expanding Song in 961 and was invaded outright in 975, when it was formally absorbed into Song China.

===Transitions between kingdoms===
Although more stable than northern China as a whole, southern China was also torn apart by warfare. [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu]] quarrelled with its neighbours, a trend that continued as Wu was replaced with [[Southern Tang]]. In the 940s [[Min (Ten Kingdoms)|Min]] and [[Chu (Ten Kingdoms)|Chu]] underwent internal crises which Southern Tang handily took advantage of, destroying Min in 945 and Chu in 951. Remnants of Min and Chu, however, survived in the form of [[Qingyuan Jiedushi]] and [[Wuping Jiedushi]] for many years after. With this, Southern Tang became the undisputedly most powerful regime in southern China. However, it was unable to defeat incursions by the [[Later Zhou]] between 956 and 958, and ceded all of its land north of the [[Yangtze River]].

The Song dynasty, established in 960, was determined to reunify China. [[Jingnan]] and [[Wuping Jiedushi]] were swept away in 963, [[Later Shu]] in 965, [[Southern Han]] in 971, and [[Southern Tang]] in 975. Finally, Wuyue and [[Qingyuan Jiedushi]] gave up their land to Northern Song in 978, bringing all of southern China under the control of the central government.

In common with other periods of fragmentation, the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period resulted in a division between [[northern and southern China]]. The greater stability of the Ten Kingdoms, especially the longevity of Wu Yue and Southern Han, would contribute to the development of distinct regional identities within China. The distinction was reinforced by the ''[[Old History of the Five Dynasties|Old History]]'' and the ''[[Historical Records of the Five Dynasties|New History]]''. Written from the northern viewpoint, these chronicles organized the history around the Five Dynasties (the north), presenting the Ten Kingdoms (the south) as illegitimate, self-absorbed and indulgent.&lt;ref name=Davis /&gt;

==Culture==

The Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period turned away from the international cultural mood of the [[Tang dynasty]] and appears as a transition towards the solidified national culture of the [[Song dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=jcecAAAAQBAJ|title=The Culture of China|page=245|publisher=Britannica Educational Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781615301836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the period, there was marked cultural and economic growth, rather than decline.&lt;ref name=Dudbridge&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/A_Portrait_of_Five_Dynasties_China.html?id=VDybnQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=A Portrait of Five Dynasties China: From the Memoirs of Wang Renyu (880-956)|page=8|author=Glen Dudbridge|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780191749537}} Dudbridge actually quotes [[Edwin O. Reischauer|Reischauer]]'s ''Ennin's Travels.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although short, the period saw cultural innovations in different areas. Pottery saw the appearance of "white ceramics." In painting, the "varied landscape" of China was inspired by [[Taoism]]. It emphasized the sacredness of mountains as places between heaven and earth and depicted the natural world as a source of harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museocineseparma.org/risorse/dinastie/china_5dynasties.htm|title=Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms|publisher=Museum of Chinese Art and Ethnography, Parma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Formula LGB Swift''' is a single seater, [[open wheel]] class in motorsport in [[India]] launched in 2003. The cars are powered by 1.3 liter [[Maruti Esteem]] engines (also used in the [[Suzuki Swift]]) and are driven by top and upcoming Indian drivers in the National Racing Championship. This car can be considered as an Indian equivalent of Europe’s [[Formula Ford]] series, where it is void of aerodynamic aids like wings. From 2006 this car replaced [[Formula Maruti]] as an entry level formula car. This series offers the first feel and insights into open wheel racing for an upcoming race driver.

==Name==
LGB denotes L. G. Balakrishnan Brothers, the manufacturers of Rolon chains and sprockets. LGB is the parent company of Super Speeds which designs and constructs the cars. Swift denotes the engine supplier [[Maruti Suzuki|Maruti Udyog]].
The car was named [[Formula LGB]] from 2003 till 2005. In 2006 Swift was added to avoid name confusion with the launch of another [[Hyundai]] engined Formula LGB ([[Formula LGB Hyundai]]) which was slightly different in layout and design.

==Design==

===Early version===
The car was originally named [[Formula LGB]] from 2003 till 2005 and the engines were the same 1.3 liter used in the [[Maruti Esteem]] but in [[carburetor|carburated]] form with a [[single overhead cam]]. Still the car had 50% more power (65 b.h.p. being its stock version in carburetor form), than the stock version in race trim.

===Current version===
In the 2006 season the car was renamed Formula LGB Swift and Maruti Swift's 1.3 litre 16 valve MPFI engine was refitted. The new engines were left in stock form as the new engines could reach over {{convert|90|bhp|abbr=on}}.
The engine is mounted in a transverse direction with the stock gearbox as in a [[front wheel drive]] car.
The wheelbase is between 2190-2200mm and the weight of the car (minus the driver) is 450kg.

===Chassis===
The chassis is a steel spaceframe monocoque with fire retardant composite [[fiberglass|GRP]] panels. The design is on the heavier side, mainly for structural and safety reasons. The steel tubes are of square section and the tyres are supplied by JK Tyres in a grooved slick pattern.
The Formula Swift rides on aluminium wheels and both front and rear tyres are 185/60.

==Costs==
Along with [[Formula LGB Hyundai]] this is one of the cheapest formula cars in the world to race, with rental for Friday practise, Saturday qualifying and a double race on Sunday (15 laps each), costing only $800 (as of 2005). That rate includes [[tyres]] and [[fuel]].

==Races==

Races for the national championship are held at [[Coimbatore]]'s [[Kari Motor Speedway]] and at [[Chennai]]'s MMSC Irrugatukottai track.
The car is designed and built by Coimbatore-based Super Speeds Pvt. Ltd. for LG Sports, makers of Rolon chains and sprockets, Coimbatore. The car was designed by ex-racer B. Viji (also known as B. Vijaykumar) with JK Tyres being the championship sponsor and also sponsoring some of the drivers.
Maruti Udyog presents the championship winner a brand new Maruti car. In 2006 it was Maruti Swift.

'''Elections to the [[National Assembly of France]]''' were held in [[Algeria]] in February 1871. Two members were elected from each of the three départements, [[Alger (département)|Algiers]], [[Constantine (département)|Constantine]] and [[Oran (department)|Oran]]. However, two winning candidates (who both stood in Algiers and one also in Oran) also won seats in mainland France,&lt;ref name=NA1&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/sycomore/fiche.asp?num_dept=13930 Joseph Garibaldi] National Assembly of France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NA2&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/sycomore/fiche.asp?num_dept=3237 Léon Michel Gambetta] National Assembly of France&lt;/ref&gt; and by-elections were held in Algiers on 11 July and Oran on 12 July.&lt;ref name=NA3&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/sycomore/fiche.asp?num_dept=8773 Auguste Hubert Warnier] National Assembly of France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NA4&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/sycomore/fiche.asp?num_dept=8538 Alexis Lambert] National Assembly of France&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral system==
The franchise was restricted to French citizens, which prevented most of the Muslim Arab population from voting; Muslims were deemed to be French subjects falling under the Muslim personal status law. Although they could request citizenship, few did as it involved committing [[apostasy]] as it required them to renounce Muslim law.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Tachau (1994) ''Political parties of the Middle East and North Africa'', Greenwood Press, pp1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ref label|reference_name_A|a|a}} Gambetta and Garibaldi were both also won seats in mainland France.

However, their election was annulled by the National Assembly (the totals won by the two candidates - 5,059 and 2,288 - exceeded the total number of votes - 7,193) but were both re-elected in January 1872.&lt;ref name=NA3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/sycomore/fiche.asp?num_dept=8297 Rémy Jacques] National Assembly of France&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gadzoox''' produced hardware and software for the entry-level [[storage area network]] market. After filing [[bankruptcy]] in 2002, its assets were acquired by [[Broadcom]] in 2003 for $5.8 million.

==History==
The company was founded in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.networkworld.com/article/2340442/data-center/broadcom-buys-gadzoox-assets-for--5-8-million.html | title=Broadcom buys Gadzoox assets for $5.8 million | first=Paul F. | last=Roberts | work=[[International Data Group]] | date=March 3, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2000, the company acquired SmartSAN for $23.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.cnet.com/news/short-take-gadzoox-beefs-up-storage-power/ | title=Short Take: Gadzoox beefs up storage power | first=STEPHEN | last=SHANKLAND | work=[[CNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2000, the company launched Axxess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WBsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26 | title=Gadzoox launches storage pooling devices | first=Deni | last=Connor | work=[[International Data Group]] | date=June 12, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2000, during the [[dot-com bubble]], the company became a [[public company]] via an [[initial public offering]]. Shares were priced at $21 each but soared as high as $87 each on the first day of trading, giving the company a [[market capitalization]] of $1.97 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wired.com/1999/07/gadzoox-soars-in-ipo/ | title=GADZOOX SOARS IN IPO | work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date=July 20, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2000, Bill Sickler, the CEO of the company, resigned after announcing a financial restatement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gadzoox-ceo-resigns-after-restatement | title=Gadzoox CEO quits after restatement | first=Chris | last=Kraeuter | work=[[Marketwatch]] | date=August 8, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, Christine E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11186">[[File:Cut-off ponytail (close in).JPG|right|thumb|A cut-off ponytail represents a valuable commodity for hair thieves]]
'''Hair theft''' has been a recurrent problem in various parts of the world where human hair is in demand either for commercial products such as [[wig]]s and [[hairpiece]]s, or for [[Sexual fetishism|sexual fetishes]]. As hair has a high commercial value – in the mid-19th century it was regarded as worth twice its weight in silver – opportunist thieves have targeted long-haired women, and less commonly men and children, with the aim of stealing their hair. Hair thieves have typically sought either to surreptitiously cut off hair in public places, or have mugged people and shorn their heads. The crime of hair theft has been widely reported in North America, Europe, Asia and Australasia over the course of at least 300 years.

==Hair as a commodity==

After a thousand-year abeyance, wigs came back into fashion in western Europe from the 16th century onwards, boosted in particular by [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV of France]] in the 17th and early 18th centuries. Hair came to be seen in Western countries as a means of publicly displaying the wearer's high status and ability to engage in [[conspicuous consumption]]. A burgeoning trade in hair products included all the tools needed to maintain elaborate hairstyles – curling sticks, crimping irons, creams, soaps, oils, brushes, pins and so on. The increasing ornateness of formal hairstyles required many to supplement their natural hair with extensions, or to use wigs instead, created by commercial wig-makers.&lt;ref name="Ofek" /&gt;

This created a highly profitable market in human hair, which was said in the mid-19th century to be worth twice its weight in silver. In 1851 {{convert|10862|lb|kg}} of hair was imported from France to England with a value of £3,621 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3621|1851|2013}}}} today).&lt;ref name="Ofek"&gt;{{cite book|title=Representations of Hair in Victorian Literature and Culture|last=Ofek|first=Galia|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|pages=22–3|year=2009|isbn=9780754661610}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Hairdressers' Journal'' reported in May 1863 that a hundred tons of hair a year was being sold in Parisian markets. Not all hair was created equal; female hair from northern Italy and Spain was especially prized for its glossy blackness and curliness.&lt;ref name="Hairdressers"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Hairdressers' Journal|date=May 1863|volume=I|number=3|pages=32–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It retailed at a price of 10–12 [[shilling]]s per ounce (worth about £43/€50/$67 in 2013 prices), rising to £1 per ounce (about £87/€101/$136) for very long hair. A "hair harvest" was held annually in the poorer villages of Italy, where local girls sold their hair to wig-makers. One observer of a hair harvesting event reported seeing "several girls, sheared, one after the other like sheep, and as many more standing ready for the shears, with their caps in their hands, and their long hair combed out, and hanging down to their waists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Victorians|last=Wilson|first=A.N.|page=163|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=9781446493205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hair crime==
[[File:Hime cut.jpg|right|thumb|Female hair is in high demand by wig-makers; a full-length wig made from human hair can be worth hundreds of dollars&lt;ref name="Machete" /&gt;]]
The value of human hair has meant that for several centuries criminals have seen hair as worth stealing. As a result, women in a number of countries have found themselves at risk of being mugged and their hair shorn off by hair thieves. As ''The Hairdressers' Journal'' put it in 1863, "Even in the present day it has happened over and over again that a good crop of hair has been laid in wait for, and shorn from the trembling victim, who has been only too glad to get free with but the loss of her hair."&lt;ref name="Hairdressers" /&gt; An American newspaper reported in 1869 that demand for hair of unusual colours and shades was behind an outbreak of hair theft in New York City, where "the tresses dangling behind the head are ... [an] easy prey." A few months later, a letter to ''[[The Times]]'' reported that hair thieves were at work in London too: &lt;blockquote&gt;infesting the thoroughfares and omnibuses of London and stealing hair. A young friend of ours has just had the whole of her hair cut off in broad daylight in [[Westbourne Grove]]... It is to be hoped that the police will really endeavour to put a stop to this serious nuisance, otherwise ladies will be afraid to walk in the streets.&lt;ref name="Ofek" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was not only women who were at risk. It was said that during the 18th century, the demand for hair in England was so great that in some places children were forbidden to venture out alone lest they fall victim to hair thieves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Muffs and Morals|last=Binder|first=Pearl|page=104|publisher=G.G. Harrap|year=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Jacksonville Weekly Sentinel'' reported on 3 September 1869 that on their arrival at San Francisco, "eighty {{Sic|?|hide=y|newly|-}}arrived Chinamen had their handsome pig-tails cut off by hair thieves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Jacksonville Weekly Sentinel|page=2|date=3 September  1869}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Evening Independent'' of [[St Petersburg, Florida]] reported in September 1913: &lt;blockquote&gt;hair thieves have appeared in the west. They enter homes in the night and cut the hair from the heads of sleeping women and children. They do not attempt to move their victims but cut only such hair as can be conveniently reached without awakening the sleepers. There seems to be an organized gang of these thieves. No attempt is made at any other form of robbery, the thieves leaving even watches and jewelry untouched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Evening Independent|location=St Petersburg, Florida|page=9|date=20 September 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Women in [[Wellington]], New Zealand were targeted on the streets by an opportunist hair thief in 1914. According to a victim interviewed by the ''Grey River Argus'', "For the life of me I couldn't tell you exactly when or where I lost my hair. I didn't feel anything at all ... when opposite Te Aro House, my friend said: 'Oh, someone's cut your hair off!' I laughed and said it was nonsense, but I found it was only too true."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THE HAIR THEIF (sic)|work=Grey River Argus|date=19 May 1914|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, outbreaks of hair theft have been reported in several countries in south-east Asia and in South America. A gang of Brazilian hair thieves consisting of "a fat man driving a small taxi, a boy about 14 and two women dressed as policewomen" were reported to have shorn the hair off 10 women in the municipality of [[Mogi das Cruzes]] near [[São Paulo]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hair Thieves' Loot|work=Gadsden Times|date=22 May 1967|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, women in [[Myanmar]] (Burma) fell victim to hair thieves who stole their hair on the street or while commuting. As many Myanmar women have very long hair, reaching to their waists or knees but worn in a [[ponytail]], thieves found it easy to snip it off surreptitiously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/world/long-haired-women-face-threat-of-hair-thieves-1.352744#.Ug0zTKzKE1I|title=Long-haired women face threat of hair thieves|date=13 May 2007|publisher=IOL|accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The price of hair, at about $445 for {{convert|1.5|kg}}, made it a profitable enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10439545|title=Bad hair days in Myanmar|work=The New Zealand Herald|date=14 May 2007|accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More outbreaks of hair theft occurred in Brazil in 2008, the victims including a woman in [[Aracaju]] whose {{convert|1.5|m|abbr=on}}-long hair had not been cut in 20 years.&lt;ref name="Machete"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/weird-true-freaky/machete-wielding-hair-robbers-strike-again/story-e6frflri-1111115397530|title=Machete-wielding hair robbers strike again|publisher=news.com.au|date=25 January 2008|accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, long-haired people in South Africa and Venezuela were also reported to be the target of gangs of hair thieves. A number of inhabitants of [[Johannesburg]] and [[Durban]] had their [[dreadlock]]s stolen by "hair jackers", carrying out "cut and runs" using anything from knives to shards of broken glass. The thieves' motivation was the high price of hair extensions, resulting from a new method of hairstyling known as "crocheting" that can give recipients an instant set of dreadlocks, which has produced intense competition for supplies of human hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21498878|title=South Africa's dreadlock thieves|last=Fihlani|first=Pumzi|date=27 February 2013|accessdate=19 August 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Venezuelan gang of hair thieves known as the Piranhas were reported to be operating in broad daylight in shopping malls in the city of [[Maracaibo]]. According to news reports, gang members, several of them female, are known to surround their victims, force them to pull their hair back into a ponytail and then cut it off. As many as three cases a day were being reported in August 2013. The President of Venezuela, [[Nicolás Maduro]], pledged to bring the Piranhas to justice: "We will capture these people, we will legislate to ban this crime. What sort of aggression is this? Our girls are sacred and we will apply the law with great force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/15/venezuelan-women-hair-thieves-maracaibo|title=Venezuelan women get short, sharp shock as hair thieves cut and run|last=Lopéz|first=Virginia|work=The Guardian|date=15 August 2013|accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual hair crime===

Not all hair theft is motivated by commercial desire. Sexually motivated hair theft has also been reported – the work of [[Hair fetishism|hair fetishists]] known in the 19th century as "plait cutters" or "hair despoilers". They were said to cut off the braids or tresses of girls attending public gatherings and to take their prizes home to be touched, caressed and admired. Hair fetishists also collected commercially available hair products, blurring the distinction between sexual fetishism and a widespread 19th century consumer culture that endorsed "collecting, hoarding, displaying, desiring, fondling, possessing and continually looking."&lt;ref name="Ofek" /&gt;

In one case reported by ''The Hairdresser's Journal'', a well-to-do German "hair fancier" was caught after a campaign of hair stealing and was found to have an "immense number of beautiful locks [of hair]" in his home. The locks were arranged in a cabinet in a kind of museum, "together with all particulars of the fair one's name, age, place of residence, and station in life ... in each {{Sic|?|hide=y|carefully|-}}placed packet containing a lock of ravished hair."&lt;ref name="Hairdressers" /&gt;

The '''Hippodrome''' is a building on the corner of [[Cranbourn Street]] and [[Charing Cross Road]] in the [[City of Westminster]], [[London]]. The name was used for many different [[theatre]]s and [[music hall]]s, of which the '''London Hippodrome''' is one of only a few survivors. ''[[wikt:hippodrome|Hippodrome]]'' is an old word referring to places of entertainment where horse races and the like were staged.

==History==

===Hippodrome===
The London Hippodrome was opened in 1900. It was designed by [[Frank Matcham]] for [[Moss Empires]] chaired by [[Edward Moss]] and built for £250,000 as a [[hippodrome]] for [[circus]] and [[variety show|variety]] performances. The venue gave its first for us show on 15 January 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/September2003/FrontPage.htm ''London Hippodrome'' (Special feature, September 2003, Arthur Lloyd)] accessed 18 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The first show ever given was a music hall revue entitled "Giddy Ostend" with [[Little Tich]] and (in one of his first roles) [[Charlie Chaplin]]. Entry to the venue was through a bar, dressed as a ship's saloon and the performance space featured both a [[proscenium]] stage and an arena that sank into a 230&amp;nbsp;ft, 100,000 gallon water tank (400 ton, when full) for aquatic spectacles. The tank featured eight central fountains, and a circle of fountains around the side. Entrances at the side of the auditorium could also be flooded, and used for the entry of boats.&lt;ref name=programme&gt;Theatre Programme for 30 July 1900, see Arthur Lloyd site.&lt;/ref&gt; Shows included equestrian acts, elephants and polar bears, and acrobats would dive from a ''Minstrel Gallery'' above a sliding roof, in the centre of the [[proscenium arch]]. The auditorium featured [[cantilever]]ed galleries, removing the columns that often obstructed views in London theatres, the whole was covered by a painted glass retractable roof, that could be illuminated at night.&lt;ref name=programme/&gt; The building included the headquarters of [[Moss Empires]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hipevents.co.uk/ Hip events (History section)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628221802/http://hipevents.co.uk/ |date=28 June 2007 }} accessed 18 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre 1909–1951===
In 1909, it was reconstructed by Matcham as a music-hall and variety theatre with 1340 seats in stalls, mezzanine, gallery, and upper gallery levels. It was here that [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Swan Lake]]'' received its English première by the [[Ballets Russes]] in 1910. The [[Albert de Courville]] revues were performed here from December 1912.

The Hippodrome hosted the first official jazz gig in the United Kingdom, by the [[Original Dixieland Jazz Band]], in 1919.&lt;ref name =Standard/&gt;

Its reputation was for [[revue]] and [[musical comedy]], among them ''[[The Five O'Clock Girl]]'', the West End production of [[Vincent Youmans]]' hit Broadway musical ''[[Hit the Deck (musical)|Hit The Deck]]'' (1928) and also ''[[Mr. Cinders]]'', both in 1929; [[Ivor Novello]]'s ''[[Perchance to Dream (musical)|Perchance to Dream]]'' in 1945 with [[Margaret Rutherford]]; and the revue ''High Spirits'' in 1953 with [[Cyril Ritchard]] and [[Diana Churchill (actress)|Diana Churchill]]. [[Julie Andrews]] made her stage debut here at the age of 12. From 1949 to 1951 it was the London equivalent of the [[Folies Bergère]].

===The Talk of the Town===
The original interior was demolished in 1958, and [[Bernard Delfont]] had the Hippodrome converted into the [[nightclub]] The Talk of the Town. It featured appearances by many of the popular artistes of the time,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richardmmills.com/talk1.html Performers at The Talk of the Town.]&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes]], [[Judy Garland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~judyin.london/judyil10.htm |title=''Judy wows 'em with songs to remember'', Diana Ross and the Supremes, James Green (fan site) |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120723172934/http://www.btinternet.com/~judyin.london/judyil10.htm |archivedate=23 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }} accessed 18 October 2007{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Shirley Bassey]],&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Bassey ''Live at Talk of the Town'' (#38 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Temptations]],&lt;ref&gt;1970, ''[[Live at London's Talk of the Town (Temptations album)]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Lena Horne]], [[Sergio Franchi]], [[Sophie Tucker]], [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], [[Val Doonican]], [[Dusty Springfield]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[The Jackson 5]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Cilla Black]], [[Paul Anka]], [[Sandie Shaw]], [[Johnnie Ray]], [[Matt Monro]], [[The Andrews Sisters]], [[Frankie Vaughan]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[The Shadows]], [[Dionne Warwick]], [[Raphael (singer)|Raphael]], [[The Seekers]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Sacha Distel]] and [[Neil Sedaka]]. In February 1964, [[Ethel Merman]] made her only British appearance in a season of cabaret. [[Dusty Springfield]] recorded a TV special at the venue, broadcast February 15, 1968 on [[BBC2]] ''Show of the Week: Live at the Talk of the Town''.&lt;ref&gt;http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/9201b12c34cd4072bb7b16ca5e24cb3b&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Seekers]]' final concert was recorded for the album ''The Seekers Live at The Talk of the Town'' in July 1968. [[Tony Bennett]] set his 1972 series for [[Thames Television]], ''[[Tony Bennett at the Talk of the Town]]'', there. This form of entertainment, in its turn, fell out of public favour, and the venue closed in 1982.

In 2009, the Hippodrome was named by the [[Brecon Jazz Festival]] as one of 12 venues which had made the most important contributions to jazz music in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Standard&gt;[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23727267-buckingham-palace-hits-right-note-with-jazz-fans.do "Buckingham Palace hits right note with jazz fans"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426000757/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23727267-buckingham-palace-hits-right-note-with-jazz-fans.do |date=26 April 2010 }}, ''London Evening Standard'' (3 August 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical drama ''[[End of the Rainbow]]'', nominated for a number of [[Olivier Awards]] in 2011 during its London run and [[Tony Awards]] in 2012 while on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], is set at the Talk of The Town during a Judy Garland engagement there near the end of her life.

===The London Hippodrome===
Renovated yet again, the building was reopened as a nightclub/restaurant called The London Hippodrome by nightclub tycoon [[Peter Stringfellow]] in 1983. Some years later, Stringfellow sold it to a chain company called European Leisure. Under the stewardship of David Chipping the club went on to win many BEDA and DI awards, regularly attracting crowds in excess of 2,000. Following its sale to Luminar the club soon went out of fashion; it was not until April 2004 that the Hippodrome regained its standing, when it was transformed into Cirque at the Hippodrome. The interior was taken back to hues of reds and golds, and [[burlesque]] was the theme. Cirque at the Hippodrome won the BEDA award for best UK nightclub in 2004.

It was revealed in October 2005 that the club had lost its public drinks licence and would no longer be able to serve alcohol, as the local police didn't want what they called "vertical drinking" (the majority of patrons standing rather than sitting) in Leicester Square. The police also shut down most of the venues in the local area. Following this, in December 2005, the club was eventually forced to close, following reports of violence involving rival gangs after they had left the building of the Hippodrome, which reflected on its closure later in Westminster licensing court.

===The Hippodrome Events Space &amp; Theatre ===
In January 2006, entrepreneur Charmaine Haig took over the lease of the Hippodrome building on a short term before a casino licence application could be secured for future use. Haig initially maintained and managed the empty venue on her own, and then changed the venue's name back to the London Hippodrome from its previous name of Cirque.

Shortly afterward, Haig's in-house events company, Hip Events, began running private events in the venue, but once again using the space to its full capacity as a variety venue with album launches, dance shows, gala dinners, awards ceremonies and Leicester Square film premiere after parties.

In 2008, Haig and her business partner acquired a theatre licence for the venue and subsequently turned the venue back into a theatre. The adult cabaret show ''[[La Clique]]'' was found at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2008; by the beginning of October 2008, the show previewed at the London Hippodrome with great success, and stayed running until the end of Haig's Hippodrome lease in June 2009. During this time, the show ''La Clique'' at the Hippodrome won an [[Olivier Award]] in 2009, in the "Best Entertainment" category.

===The Hippodrome Casino===
In 2009, the lease on the Hippodrome was acquired by Leicester-born father and son entrepreneurs Jimmy and Simon Thomas, who began an extensive restoration programme taking the Hippodrome back to Matcham's original designs for use as a casino and entertainment venue. During the planning stage, the adjacent Cranbourn Mansions building became available and plans were redrafted to incorporate this former gentlemen’s apartment block into the design, doubling the eventual floorspace and linked using a new structure sited within the existing light well between the two buildings.

Investment in the building totaled upwards of a reported £40million, cash raised by the Thomas family from the sale of a number of bingo halls prior to the UK smoking ban, which made it illegal to smoke within an enclosed workplace, on 1 July 2007.

The Hippodrome Casino was opened on 13 July 2012 by Mayor of London [[Boris Johnson]], who described it as "yet another ringing endorsement of London as a great place to invest".

The venue on opening included four floors of gaming, including a Gold Room casino sited in the original basement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Basement Waterproofing – Hippodrome Casino |url=http://www.cellars.co.uk/case-studies/basement-waterproofing-hippodrome-casino |accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with access directly into Chinatown to the rear of the building, Heliot restaurant, six bars, a smoking terrace and The Matcham Room cabaret theatre. The restoration and construction of the casino was followed on the blog of LBC presenter Steve Allen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Allen |first=Steve |title=Sneak Peek: A Look At The New London Hippodrome |url=http://www.lbc.co.uk/sneak-peek-a-look-at-the-new-london-hippodrome-55898/view/25976#25969|accessdate=17 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126063940/http://www.lbc.co.uk/sneak-peek-a-look-at-the-new-london-hippodrome-55898/view/25976#25969 |archivedate=26 January 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2013 the casino was awarded Best Land-based Casino at the Totally Gaming Awards, which also gave Jimmy Thomas a Life Achievement award for his contribution to the gaming and entertainment industries.

The Matcham Room at the Hippodrome Casino is currently the home of nationally renowned Boom &amp; Bang Circus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Pictures: Boom &amp; Bang|url=http://www.thisiscabaret.com/in-pictures-boom-bang/|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (created and produced by Bioux "Boom" Hayes and Kitty Bang Bang) and Soho Burlesque featuring co producer [[Miss Polly Rae]] (Hurly Burly Show by William Baker) and London's burlesque elite. It is also the London residency of the internationally renowned [http://www.thedefinitiveratpack.com The Definitive Rat Pack]

On 4 March 2013, Simon Thomas announced the opening of Pokerstars LIVE, a deal between the Hippodrome and Pokerstars, the world’s largest online poker website.

'''Katrina Aid Today''' is a relief charity in the United States, that works to provide long term recovery support to survivors of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. [[United Methodist Committee on Relief]] (UMCOR), the humanitarian relief and development agency of the [[United Methodist Church]], manages the U.S. [[Department of Homeland Security]]'s [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) sponsored program. Nine national partners and sixteen local organizations, who specialize in availability of benefits, resources and services, aim to deliver assistance to 300,000 of the most vulnerable survivors in the United States.

Consortium agencies work from offices in 31 [[U.S. state]]s utilizing case managers to assist people that have been affected by the storm. In addition to the $66&amp;nbsp;million grant funds from FEMA, donated by foreign governments, consortium members have also committed an estimated $35&amp;nbsp;million ($5&amp;nbsp;million from UMCOR) including [[Gifts in kind|in-kind contributions]] totaling $101&amp;nbsp;million for long term recovery.

The program aims to assist survivors by the creation of recovery plans, identification of unmet needs, and facilitating access to necessary resources. Case management through this program is facilitated nationally through the use of standardized forms and direct data entry into CAN: Coordinated Assistance Network – a web-based database developed by the [[American Red Cross]].

UMCOR established its case management system during recovery from [[Hurricane Andrew]] and improved it during the [[September 11 attacks]]. Partners were selected based on nonprofit status, national volunteer network capacity and case management experience. Grassroots organizations were selected based on a similar evaluation process and are funded by UMCOR private funds.

This is an incomplete list of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] [[music festival|festivals]]. Heavy metal (or simply '''metal''') is a genre of [[rock music]]&lt;ref&gt;Du Noyer (2003), p. 96; Weinstein (2000), pp. 11–13.&lt;/ref&gt; that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein (2000), pp. 14, 118.&lt;/ref&gt; With roots in [[blues rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]], the first heavy metal bands such as [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Deep Purple]] attracted large audiences, and during the late 1960s and mid-1970s these band and others in their genre were featured at a number of [[historic rock festival]]s.&lt;ref name=fast&gt;Fast (2005), pp. 89–91; Weinstein (2000), pp. 7, 8, 23, 36, 103, 104.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judas Priest]] helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its [[blues]] influence.&lt;ref name="Walser 1993, p. 6"&gt;Walser (1993), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"As much as Sabbath started it, Priest were the ones who took it out of the blues and straight into metal." Bowe, Brian J. ''Judas Priest: Metal Gods''. {{ISBN|0-7660-3621-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the genre fused with other related genres such as [[punk rock]] in the late 1970s, bands in the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] such as [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] followed in a similar vein. Before the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as "[[Heavy metal subculture|metalheads]]" or "[[headbanging|headbangers]]", and there were festivals worldwide, both touring and stationary, dedicated to [[heavy metal subgenres]] and heavy metal itself. During the 1980s, [[glam metal]] became a commercial force, while [[Underground music|Underground scenes]] and [[extreme metal|extreme subgenres of metal]] such as [[death metal]] and [[black metal]] remained [[subculture|subcultural]] phenomena, though they have their own dedicated festivals as well. Since the mid-1990s, popular styles have further expanded the definition of the genre.

The '''London Coliseum''' (also known as the '''Coliseum Theatre''') is a theatre in [[St Martin's Lane]], [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], built as one of [[London]]'s largest and most luxurious "family" [[variety theatre]]s. Opened on 24 December 1904 as the '''London Coliseum Theatre of Varieties''', it was designed by the theatrical [[architect]] [[Frank Matcham]] for the [[impresario]] [[Oswald Stoll]].&lt;ref name="cinematreasures"&gt;{{cite web|title=London Coliseum|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/11041|publisher=Cinema Treasures|accessdate=15 January 2010|author=KenRoe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their ambition was to build the largest and finest [[music hall]], described as the "people's palace of entertainment" of its age.&lt;ref name=AL&gt;{{cite web|last=Lloyd|first=Arthur|title=The London Coliseum, St. Martin's Lane, London, WC2|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/LondonColiseum.htm|publisher=Arthurlloyd.co.uk|accessdate=28 November  2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of construction, the Coliseum was the only theatre in Europe to provide lifts for taking patrons to the upper levels of the house, and was the first theatre in England to have a triple revolve installed on its stage. The theatre has 2,359 seats making it the largest theatre in London.

After being used for variety shows, musical comedies, and stage plays for many years, then as a cinema screening films in the [[Cinerama]] format between 1961 and 1968, the [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells Opera Company]] moved into the building in 1968. The Sadler's Wells company changed its name to the [[English National Opera]] in 1974 and today it is used primarily for opera as well as being the London home of the [[English National Ballet]].

== History ==
The London Coliseum was built by the theatrical [[architect]] [[Frank Matcham]] who intended it to be one of London's largest and most luxurious "family" variety theatres. Construction began in 1903 and the venue opened on 24 December the following year as the London Coliseum Theatre of Varieties. It is located in [[St Martin's Lane]], London.&lt;ref name="ENO"&gt;[http://www.eno.org/about/eno-past/history-of-the-coliseum "History of the Coliseum"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726165824/http://www.eno.org/about/eno-past/history-of-the-coliseum |date=26 July 2015 }}, English National Opera, accessed 26 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matcham built the theatre for the theatrical impresario [[Oswald Stoll|Sir Oswald Stoll]] and had the ambition of it being the largest and finest "People’s palace of entertainment" of the age.&lt;ref name="ENO" /&gt;

Matcham wanted a Theatre of Variety – not a music hall but equally not highbrow entertainment. The resulting programme was a mix of music hall and variety theatre, with one act - a full scale revolving chariot race - requiring the stage to revolve. The theatre’s original slogan was PRO BONO PUBLICO (For the public good). It was opened in 1904 and the inaugural performance was a variety bill on 24 December that year.

[[English Heritage]], in its description of the theatre when it was given listed status in 1960 notes that it is "exuberant Free Baroque ambitious design, the Edwardian "Theatre de Luxe of London" with richly decorated interiors and a vast and grandiose auditorium."&lt;ref name=EH/&gt; The description continues: "Lavish foyer and circulation areas with marble facings, culminating in vast 3-tier auditorium with wealth of eclectic classical detail of Byzantine opulence, some motifs such as the squat columns dividing the lowest tier of slip boxes, backing the stalls, almost Sullivanesque; pairs of 2-tiered bow fronted boxes with domed canopies at gallery level and semi-domed, Ionic-columned pairs of 2 tiered orchestra boxes, contained in arched and pedimented frames surmounted by sculptural groups with lion-drawn chariots. Great, semi-circular, blocked architrave proscenium arch with cartouche- trophy keystone."&lt;ref name=EH/&gt;

The inaugural performance was a [[Variety show|variety]] bill on 24 December 1904, but it "was a total failure and closed down completely only two years after opening in 1906 and remained closed until December of 1907 when it was reopened and at last became successful."&lt;ref name=AL/&gt; In 1908, the London Coliseum was host to a cricket match between Middlesex and Surrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/710639.html | title=When cricket hit the West End | publisher=ESPN Cricinfo | date=18 January 2014 |accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]] produced his last play here, ''[[The Hooligan]]''.

The theatre changed its name from the London Coliseum to the Coliseum Theatre between 1931 and 1968 when a run of 651 performances of the musical comedy ''[[White Horse Inn]]'' began on 8 April 1931. Additionally, Arthur Lewis notes&lt;ref name=AL/&gt; that:
:Pantomimes began in 1936 with ''Cinderella'' and continued regularly until 1946. In 1947 the musical ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'' was staged at the Coliseum and had a staggeringly successful run for the time, of 1,304 performances and three continuous years which was the longest run in theatrical history.
There then followed a long run of major American hits beginning with ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' in 1951, ''[[Guys And Dolls]]'' in 1953, ''[[Pajama Game]]'' in 1955, and ''[[Damn Yankees]]'' in 1957. But this exceptional period did at last come to an end in 1957 when the production of ''The Bells Are Ringing'' failed to enthrall anyone.

The Coliseum reverted to the original name when the Sadler's Wells Opera Company moved there in 1968 and, in 1974, the Company changed its name to become the English National Opera; it bought the freehold of the building for £12.8 million in 1992.&lt;ref name=AL/&gt; The Coliseum hosted both the 2004 and 2006 [[Royal Variety Performance]]s and is also the London base for performances by [[English National Ballet]], which perform regular seasons throughout the year when not on tour.

[[The Who]] performed there and recorded their concert, on 14 December 1969.

== Technical aspects ==
While its wing space is limited due to the constricted site on which the theatre was built, as Lloyd notes,  "the stage of the London Coliseum was also on a vast scale; 55 feet wide by 92 feet deep".&lt;ref name=AL/&gt;
The stage is not [[rake (theatre)|raked]]. It has the widest [[proscenium arch]] in London and was one of the first to have electric lighting. It was built with a triple revolving stage, although this was rarely used. The Coliseum was designed to seat 2,358 people on four levels.&lt;ref name=AL/&gt;  As such it is the largest of all London's theatres.&lt;ref name="ENO" /&gt;

The theatre retains many of its original features and was given a [[listed building|Grade II* listed building]] by English Heritage in September 1960. Prior to Sadler's Wells Opera Company taking over the Coliseum in 1968, the house was "fully restored, redecorated, and a large orchestra pit installed". It reopened on 21 August 1968, with a production of the opera ''Don Giovanni''.&lt;ref name=AL/&gt;

Another extensive renovation took place between 2000 and 2004.&lt;ref name=EH&gt;{{IoE|426935|accessdate=28 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Higgins|first=Charlotte|title=The Guardian Profile: Martin Smith|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/dec/16/arts.artsnews1|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=(London)|accessdate=23 January 2013|date=15 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the design team included the architects [[RHWL]] and [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]] as acousticians and building engineers.

The London Coliseum has two lifts which provide step-free access for disabled patrons to all levels, except the Upper Circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://seatplan.com/london/london-coliseum-theatre/access/|title=Accessibility at London Coliseum {{!}} SeatPlan|website=SeatPlan|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use as a cinema==
Periodically, the Coliseum was used to show films and, when the "'Talkies' arrived at the Coliseum in 1933,  films were run at the Theatre for a year. The greatest sensation at this time was the showing of ''[[King Kong]]'' which ran at the Coliseum for months with 10,000 people seeing the film at the Theatre every day."&lt;ref name=AL/&gt;

However, after a lackluster period of poorly received musicals came to an end, in June 1961 the theatre was leased by [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer|MGM]] for use as a cinema during the period that the [[Empire, Leicester Square]] was closed for rebuilding. The initial presentation, from 6 June,  was a revival of ''[[Gone With the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'' which ran for 3 months. On 2 November the World Premiere of ''[[Bachelor in Paradise (film)|Bachelor in Paradise]]'' took place in the presence of the film's star, Bob Hope, and following this, on 15 November, was the UK premiere of [[Samuel Bronston]]'s epic ''[[King of Kings]]''. MGM continued to use the theatre even after the new [[Empire, Leicester Square]] reopened in December 1962, but MGM's lease expired on 19 May 1963 and the theatre was then leased by the [[Cinerama]] Corporation to become the second of London's Cinerama locations (after the [[Prince Edward Theatre|Casino Cinerama]]).

Conversion to three-strip projection which used three projectors was undertaken, and an 80&amp;nbsp;ft wide, 30&amp;nbsp;ft tall deeply curved screen was installed. Beginning on 16 July 1963, the theatre was renamed the Coliseum Cinerama, with the UK premiere of ''[[The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm]]''. This film transferred to the third of London's Cinerama houses, the [[Peacock Theatre|Royalty Theatre]] on 27 November and the Coliseum was converted for single-projector Cinerama using 70mm film for the Gala UK Premiere of ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World]]'' on 2 December 1963. Other 70mm films followed, ''The Magnificent Showman'' (the UK Title of ''[[Circus World (film)|Circus World]]''), ''[[The Great Race]]'' (a 35mm "blow up") and ''[[The Bible (film)|The Bible]]''. With fewer films made in the format, it later became difficult to programme the theatre. It resorted to revivals of old 70mm movies before opening ''[[The Comedians (1967 film)|The Comedians]]'' on January 18, 1968 (a 70mm Panavision blow up). This ran for nine weeks and was followed by a revival of the 1956 Todd-AO epic ''[[Around the World in 80 Days]]'', the first time this film had been shown in 70mm in London. This ran until 22 May 1968 when Cinerama pulled out and the theatre reverted to live use.&lt;ref name="cinematreasures"/&gt;

'''''Manhattan''''' (sometimes styled '''''MANH(A)TTAN''''') is an American television drama series based on the [[Manhattan Project|project of the same name]] that produced the first atomic weapons. While some historical figures appear in ''Manhattan'', most characters are fictional, and the show is not intended to maintain historical accuracy.&lt;ref name="usa 5/15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2014/05/15/wgn-american-manhattan-photo-and-premiere-announcement/9103783/|title=Take a first look at WGN America's 'Manhattan' cast|last=Keveney|first=Bill|date=May 15, 2014|work=USA Today|accessdate=June 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was the first drama production for [[WGN America]] since the revival of Tribune's production arm as [[Tribune Entertainment|Tribune Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graser|first1=Marc|title=How Matt Cherniss is Building Provocative New Worlds for WGN America|url=https://variety.com/2013/biz/news/wgn-manhattan-project-salem-1200888723/|accessdate=March 10, 2016|work=Variety|date=November 29, 2013|quote=“Salem” is a co-production with 20th Century Fox TV’s cable arm Fox 21, while “Manhattan” will be produced through Tribune Studios, ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series premiered on WGN America on July 27, 2014. The series earned critical acclaim throughout its run, but failed to secure adequate ratings. As a result, it was canceled on February 2, 2016, after its second season, becoming the first WGN America original series to be canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/02/03/manhattan-canceled |title=''Manhattan'' canceled after two seasons |work=Entertainment Weekly |first=Oliver |last=Gettell |date=February 3, 2016 |accessdate=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Set in 1943 and 1944 at the time of the [[Manhattan Project]], the series focuses on [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]], a town the outside world knows nothing about. The federal government tells the scientists only what they need to know, while the scientists keep secrets from their families.&lt;ref name=Owen&gt;{{cite news|title=TV Q&amp;A: 'The Talk,' TV ratings and paranormal TV shows|url=http://communityvoices.post-gazette.com/arts-entertainment-living/tuned-in/item/38065-tv-q-a-the-talk-tv-ratings-and-paranormal-tv-shows|last=Owen|first=Rob|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=June 27, 2014|accessdate=June 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the TV show is not intended to be historically accurate, it does reference many aspects of the actual Manhattan Project, and some actual historical figures such as head scientist [[Robert Oppenheimer]]. However, other contributors to the Manhattan Project, such as [[Nobel Laureate]]s [[Enrico Fermi]] (who moved to the site in September 1944) and [[Emilio G. Segrè]], do not appear.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5894">Melbourne Fringe is a celebration of cultural democracy and art for everyone. By embracing diversity and a spirit of independence, the Festival creates a unique space for artistic self-expression linked to the life of Melbourne. Every year the Festival features thousands of artists from every discipline you can name (and a few others besides) performing 400+ events in over 160 venues to an audience in excess of 350,000 people.

Melbourne Fringe is the place to go for pure, unadulterated, uncurated and unexpected artistic discovery. The organisation helps artists develop and provide a platform for a vast, diverse range of voices, in celebration of the idea that when we come together, it creates a safe space for risk taking. The Festival loves the weird and strange, the different and queer, the misfits and the freaks.

The Melbourne Fringe Festival is an uncurated, open access event.

==History==
Since 1982, Melbourne’s longest-running and most popular arts festival has supported and presented some 50,000 artists to more than 2,000,000 people at hundreds of venues across Melbourne and Victoria. Today, audiences of half a million enjoy the work of 4,000+ artists in 300+ shows at over 100 venues.

In the early 1980s, Carlton’s [[The Pram Factory|Pram Factory]] was sold, and its prolific artist collectives dispersed (with Multicultural Arts Victoria emerging soon afterwards, but only [[Circus Oz]] remaining in similar form today). A new entity was formed in 1982 to ensure there would still be a gathering point for these artists: a collaborative which would encourage, represent and unite artists of all disciplines. The Fringe Arts Network was born, aiming to raise public and government awareness of the outstanding contribution made by the alternative arts to the quality of life in Melbourne. The Network mobilised the independent arts into an effective lobby and resource group, capable of overcoming individual financial constraints through offering support in the form of venue advice, shared resources, advocacy and support.

Fringe Arts Network’s inaugural event was a mini-festival, followed in 1983 by a week-long event coinciding with [[Moomba]] and presenting 120 artists at some 25 locations across Melbourne. In 1984, the Spoleto Festival of Two Worlds expanded to include Melbourne as its third city for the first of three Melbourne Spoleto Festival years, and Melbourne’s Fringe Arts Network became the Melbourne Piccolo Spoleto Fringe Festival. The Melbourne International Festival of the Arts (now the Melbourne International Arts Festival) emerged from the Spoleto Festival as a result, and in 1986, the Fringe Arts Network reclaimed its independence from Spoleto and reoriented itself as Melbourne Fringe.

In 2002, the Melbourne Fringe Fringe Hub model started, offering a new Festival focus for artists and audiences alike. The Hub model is about programming a number of venues with multi-arts capabilities – venues that are within easy walking distance of one another – and offering artists and audiences a central place to gather and network: the Fringe Club. With its home in North Melbourne, the Melbourne Fringe Hub revitalised this often overlooked inner-city precinct, and would soon encompass not only the North Melbourne Town Hall but also the Lithuanian Club, the Czech Club, the Comic’s Lounge, Arthur’s Circus, The Court House Hotel, Australia Post North Melbourne and the Town Hall Hotel. In 2006, the Melbourne Fringe Club moved upstairs into the North Melbourne Town Hall’s Main Hall, tripling its audiences to sell-out Hub performances, with audiences for the free, nightly Fringe Club program regularly queuing down Queensberry St for entry. In the same year, through local government investment, the City of Melbourne’s [[Arts House]] program was born: a year-round, curated program at the Meat Market and North Melbourne Town Hall, offering artists development and presentation opportunities outside of a festival calendar.

'''Sandra Renee Cantu''' (March 8, 2001 &amp;ndash; March 27, 2009) was an eight-year-old American girl who attracted national attention after she went missing on March 27, 2009. Her body was discovered ten days later inside a [[suitcase]] in a nearby [[Irrigation canal|irrigation pond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/Media/melissa-huckaby-confessed-murderer-year-girl-sentenced-life/story?id=10910285|title=Former Teacher Confesses to Murder of Girl, 8|last=News|first=A. B. C.|date=2010-06-14|website=ABC News|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 10, 2009, police [[arrested]] Cantu's neighbor, 28-year-old Melissa Huckaby, and charged her with the [[kidnapping]], [[rape]], and [[murder]] of Cantu. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.&lt;ref name="ABC News"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ferran|first=Lee|title=Melissa Huckaby Pleads Guilty to Sandra Cantu's Murder|url=http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/melissa-huckaby-pleads-guilty-sandra-cantu-murder/story?id=10605638|newspaper=ABC News|date=May 10, 2010|author2=NETTER, SARAH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kidnapping and death==
Eight-year-old Sandra Cantu lived in [[Tracy, California]], at Orchard Estates [[Mobile Home]] Park with her mother, grandparents and three older siblings. On March 27, 2009, she played at a friend's house after school until approximately 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., when she returned home. She left the mobile home saying that she was going to play at another friend's house. When she did not return for dinner, the family called the police at 7:53&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name=Netter&gt;{{cite news|last=Netter|first=Sarah|title=The Frantic Search for Sandra Cantu|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=7210841|newspaper=ABC News|date=March 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police located footage from a [[surveillance camera]] near the family home. The [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1j5R-sVIRA footage], which showed Sandra crossing the street in front of her home before moving out of frame, played on national news stations. A search of the mobile home complex was conducted without results and the [[FBI]] was called in to assist on the case. Over the course of the weekend, dogs, equestrian teams, ATVs and a [[helicopter]] from the California Highway Patrol were brought in to search for Sandra. A $22,000 reward was offered for information in the case, according to police.&lt;ref name=Netter/&gt;

One early suspect was a local man who was witnessed kissing Cantu on the mouth two years earlier at a local swimming pool, when she was six. He was interviewed and cleared of any involvement.&lt;ref name=Netter/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox News"&gt;{{cite news|title=FBI re-questions man they say admits to kissing missing California girl|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2009/04/03/fbi-re-questions-man-say-admits-to-kissing-missing-california-girl/|newspaper=Fox News|date=April 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantu's body was found 10 days later when an irrigation pond underwent a routine draining and a suitcase containing the body emerged.&lt;ref name=found&gt;{{cite news|last=Netter|first=Sarah|title=Sandra Cantu found in a suitcase; police closing in on a suspect|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=7275611|newspaper=ABC News|date=April 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cantu's autopsy revealed that she had been beaten and sexually assaulted with a foreign object before being smothered. Her toxicology results showed the presence of the benzodiazepine Alprazolam, also known as [[Xanax]].&lt;ref name="Henry Lee"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Henry K.|title=Tracy girl's killer apologizes, gets life term|url=http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/Tracy-girl-s-killer-apologizes-gets-life-term-3185446.php|newspaper=San Francisco Gate|date=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Noose&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldman|first=Russell|title=Melissa Huckaby Used Noose to Kill 8-Year-old Sandra Cantu|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/Media/melissa-huckaby-confessed-murderer-year-girl-sentenced-life/story?id=10910285|newspaper=ABC News|date=June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Melissa Huckaby==
Upon remains having been found, police became suspicious of a number of odd coincidences regarding a neighbor of the family. Melissa Huckaby, a 28-year-old [[Sunday school]] teacher, lived in the same mobile home park as Cantu. Huckaby was born in [[Orange County, California]]. She is the granddaughter of Clifford Lawless, former pastor of Clover Road Baptist Church in Tracy, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tully|first=Sarah|title=Woman suspected in 8-year-old's slaying grew up in O.C.|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/huckaby-murder-arson-2368620-school-melissa|newspaper=Orange County Register|date=April 19, 2009|author2=Ponsi, Lou}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huckaby studied criminology at a community college before she and her daughter moved in with her grandparents at the Orchard Estates Mobile Home Park. She told police that Cantu often played with her own daughter.&lt;ref name=Simerman&gt;{{cite news|last=Simerman|first=John|title=A calculated killing: The case against Melissa Huckaby|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_15334742|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News|date=2010-06-19|author2=Kazmi, Sophia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day Cantu disappeared, Huckaby sent a text to Cantu's mother that said: "Tell the police that I had something stolen today around 4 p.m. I don't know if that makes a difference or not."&lt;ref name=People&gt;{{cite news|last=Breuer|first=Howard|title=INSIDE STORY: Clues to Why Melissa Huckaby Murdered an 8-Year-Old Girl|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20397416,00.html|newspaper=People|date=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, a vigil was held for Sandra. Melissa approached  police and FBI agents to report that she had found a note on the ground. They reported she was "very agitated, crying, hyperventilating." The note stated: "Cantu locked in stolin (sic) suitcase. Thrown in water on (sic) Bacchetti Road and Whitehall Road. Witness."&lt;ref name=Simerman/&gt;

Prior to the discovery of the body, Huckaby wasn't a prime suspect because of her sex, according to lead investigator, Tracy police Detective Timothy Bauer. "She wasn't really a top priority," Bauer said. They were "focusing on all these guys in the trailer park." The profile that FBI experts assigned to the case was a white male, aged 25 to 40, with a criminal history of sexual assault or child pornography. Huckaby was interviewed on multiple occasions, but her behavior was assumed to be attention-seeking, rather than evidence of involvement. After the body was found in the suitcase she had reported stolen, they began taking a closer look at Huckaby's behavior. They took notice of "the unusual fact that a woman who reported losing a suitcase should be the one woman out of everyone in this complex who should happen to find a note that reports that the stolen suitcase was used to hide the child's body," FBI Special Agent Michael Conrad told the grand jury.&lt;ref name=Simerman/&gt;

The police got a further lead when a retired U.S. Marine and his wife notified police that they spotted Melissa Huckaby and her SUV at the irrigation pond on their property at Bacchetti Road and Whitehall Road between 5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on the day Sandra disappeared. They reportedly recognized her on television. He described her as "distracted and hurried," and she told him "I just had to pee real quick," when he saw her.&lt;ref name="Henry Lee"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Simerman/&gt;

Police reviewed surveillance footage further, which revealed that Cantu is seen walking towards Huckaby's residence at 3:54&amp;nbsp;p.m. Huckaby's SUV is seen driving away from her residence eight minutes later. At approximately the same time, she calls the trailer park manager to report that a suitcase, made by the manufacturer [[Eddie Bauer]], was stolen from her trailer. 85 minutes later, surveillance video from the church parking lot where Huckaby taught Sunday school shows her driving away from the church. 30 minutes later, she is seen returning to the church. It is during this 30-minute time frame that she was spotted at the irrigation pond.&lt;ref name=Noose/&gt;

FBI agents searched the church and collected a [[rolling pin]] from the kitchen. It is assumed to be the object used in the sexual assault. The rolling pin reportedly had a "bloody smudge" on it as well as a bent handle, authorities said. The rolling pin came back positive for Sandra's DNA.&lt;ref name="Henry Lee"/&gt;

===Guilty plea===
On April 10, 2009, Huckaby was arrested and charged with the murder.&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vives|first1=Ruben|last2=II|first2=Rong-Gong Lin|title=Sunday School teacher charged with kidnapping, murder|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/apr/12/local/me-melissa-huckaby12|accessdate=1 October 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=12 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SFGate 2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fagan|first1=Kevin|last2=Allday|first2=Erin|title=Woman, 28, jailed in Sandra Cantu slaying|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Woman-28-jailed-in-Sandra-Cantu-slaying-3165294.php#item-39786|accessdate=1 October 2017|work=SFGate|publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc.|date=12 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She pleaded guilty to first degree murder and kidnapping to avoid the death penalty and was sentenced to life without parole.&lt;ref name=Noose/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tracy Press"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Justin|first1=Lafferty|title=Update: Huckaby's plea brings sudden end to case|url=http://tracypress.com/view/full_story/7380394/article-Update--Huckaby-s-plea-brings-sudden-end-to-case|accessdate=1 October 2017|work=Tracy Press|date=10 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026123634/http://tracypress.com/view/full_story/7380394/article-Update--Huckaby-s-plea-brings-sudden-end-to-case|archivedate=26 October 2011|location=STOCKTON, Ca.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huckaby, at her sentencing said, "I still cannot understand why I did what I did. This is a question I will struggle with for the rest of my life." Huckaby had a history of mental health problems, including [[borderline personality disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="Simerman"/&gt; The prosecutor in the case speculated that she committed this crime for attention. "There were 20 or so times that Melissa [[Self-harm|cut herself]], [[Arson|set fires]] or verbally or psychologically attacked someone else, such as a roommate," said Deputy District Attorney Thomas Tesla. "And there was something like that going on here [after the murder], where she wanted to be the center of attention."&lt;ref name="inside story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Breuer|first=Howard|title=INSIDE STORY: Clues to Why Melissa Huckaby Murdered an 8-Year-Old Girl|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20397416,00.html|newspaper=People magazine|date=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten weeks prior to Cantu's murder on January 17, another child living in the same mobile home park was reported missing. The police began a search that concluded when she was dropped off at her home several hours later by Melissa Huckaby. The family drove to the emergency room when the child appeared to be sedated and slurring her words. Upon examination, the child was found to have [[muscle relaxant]]s in her system. Later, the child would report that Huckaby gave her a cup of water that "tasted like medicine," but had very little [[memory]] of the events that day. Huckaby was questioned, but police ultimately decided not to press charges, citing lack of evidence. Following her arrest for Cantu's murder, she was charged with the January 17 incident.&lt;ref name=drugged&gt;{{cite news|last=Wadsworth|first=Jennifer|title=New Charges: Melissa Huckaby Drugged People|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2009/05/23/new-charges-melissa-huckaby-drugged-people.html|newspaper=The Daily Beast|date=2009-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police also revealed that Huckaby was a person of interest in the investigation regarding two fires set in 2007 at a home where she lived at the time.&lt;ref name=arson&gt;{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=O.C. police investigate rape and killing suspect in two arson cases|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/apr/23/local/me-arson23|newspaper=L.A.

[[File:Emperor Akbar.png|alt=|thumb|Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] first introduced the Bengali New Year and official Bengali calendar to ease the tax collection process.]]

==Mughal origins theory==
During the Mughal rule, land taxes were collected from Bengali people according to the Islamic Hijri calendar. This calendar was a lunar calendar, and its new year did not coincide with the solar agricultural cycles. According to some sources, the festival was a tradition introduced in Bengal during the rule of Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] to time the tax year to the harvest, and the Bangla year was therewith called ''Bangabda''. Akbar asked the royal astronomer [[Fathullah Shirazi]] to create a new calendar by combining the lunar [[Islamic Calendar|Islamic calendar]] and solar [[Hindu calendar]] already in use, and this was known as ''Fasholi shan'' (harvest calendar). According to some historians, this started the [[Bengali calendar]].&lt;ref name= Chakrabarti114&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kunal Chakrabarti|author2=Shubhra Chakrabarti|title=Historical Dictionary of the Bengalis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVOFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114 |year= 2013|publisher =Scarecrow|isbn= 978-0-8108-8024-5|pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=banglapedia&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2015 |title=Pahela Baishakh |encyclopedia=Banglapedia |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bangladesh |location=Dhaka, Bangladesh |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Pahela_Baishakh}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Shamsuzzaman Khan, it could be Nawab [[Murshid Quli Khan]], a Mughal governor, who first used the tradition of ''Punyaho'' as "a day for ceremonial land tax collection", and used Akbar's fiscal policy to start the Bangla calendar.&lt;ref name=meghna&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Bangladesh Reader: History, Culture, Politics |last=Guhathakurta |first=Meghna  |last2=Schendel |first2=Willem van  |publisher=Duke University Press |year=2013 |isbn=9780822353188 |pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Shamsuzzaman Khan,&lt;ref name=meghna/&gt; and Nitish Sengupta, the origin of the Bengali calendar is unclear.&lt;ref name="Sengupta2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nitish K.

Some historians attribute the Bengali calendar to the 7th century king [[Shashanka]].&lt;ref name=meghna/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sengupta2011"/&gt; The term ''Bangabda'' (Bangla year) is found too in two Shiva temples many centuries older than Akbar era, suggesting that Bengali calendar existed before Akbar's time.&lt;ref name="Sengupta2011"/&gt; It is also unclear, whether it was adopted by Hussain Shah or Akbar. The tradition to use the Bengali calendar may have been started by Hussain Shah before Akbar.&lt;ref name="Sengupta2011"/&gt; Regardless of who adopted the Bengali calendar and the new year, states Sengupta, it helped collect land taxes after the spring harvest based on traditional Bengali calendar, because the Islamic Hijri calendar created administrative difficulties in setting the collection date.&lt;ref name="Sengupta2011"/&gt;

===Hindu origins theory===

According to Salil Tripathi, many Hindu traditions and customs continue among Bengali people regardless of their current faith.{{Importance inline}}&lt;ref name=tripathi5/&gt; Many Muslim Bengali women, states Tripathi, wear saris, bindi (a mark on their forehead, religious to Hindu women), celebrate ''pujo'' (prayers) to Hindu goddess [[Durga]], and usher in ''Poyla Baisakh'' to celebrate Bengali new year. This is a part of the tolerance and borrowing of mutual cultural traditions amongst Bengali, according to Tripathi.{{Importance inline}}&lt;ref name=tripathi5&gt;{{cite book|author=Salil Tripathi|title=The Colonel Who Would Not Repent: The Bangladesh War and Its Unquiet Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bcffCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5 |year=2016|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-21818-3|pages=5}}, Quote: "The intertwining of cultural traditions reinforced a society which was tolerant and the faiths borrowed from each other.

===Contemporary usage===
The current Bengali calendar in use in the Indian states is based on the Sanskrit text ''Surya Siddhanta''. It retains the historic Sanskrit names of the months, with the first month as Baishakh.&lt;ref name= Chakrabarti114/&gt; Their calendar remains tied to the Hindu calendar system and is used to set the various Bengali Hindu festivals. For Bengalis of West Bengal and other Indian states, the festival falls either on 14 or 15 April every year.&lt;ref name= Chakrabarti114/&gt;

In Bangladesh, however, the old Bengali calendar was modified in 1966 by a committee headed by [[Muhammad Shahidullah]], making the first five months 31 days long, rest 30 days each, with the month of Falgun adjusted to 31 days in every leap year.&lt;ref name= Chakrabarti114/&gt; This was officially adopted by Bangladesh in 1987.

The '''2017 Party of Growth presidential primaries''' is the selection process by which voters of the [[Party of Growth]] were to choose its potential nominee for [[President of Russia]] in the [[Russian presidential election, 2018|2018 Russian presidential election]]. Voting for candidates took place via the internet.

==History==
At the end of July 2017, the Party of Growth decided on the list of participants in the primaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rostov.dk.ru/news/rostovchanin-ofitsialno-nachal-kampaniyu-po-vydvizheniyu-na-post-prezidenta-rossii-237084621 Ростовчанин официально начал кампанию по выдвижению на пост президента России]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 August 2017, the party's press secretary told the media that the results of the primaries will be taken into account at the party congress which will be held to decide the candidate for Party of Growth; however, the winner of the primaries will not guarantee themselves the right to ballot on behalf of the party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rbc.ru/politics/10/08/2017/598c65619a79471ba8ab09c2?from=main Члены Партии роста предложили Путину уйти с поста президента]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 November 2017, it was announced that the party will nominate [[Boris Titov]], who was not involved in the primaries. According to a person from the party leadership, none of the proposed candidates were able to obtain sufficient support.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/articles/2017/11/26/743019-titov-uchastii-viborah-prezidenta Борис Титов объявил об участии в выборах президента России]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Candidates==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1825">'''Politorium''' was a town in ancient [[Latium]], [[Italy]].

In the early semi-legendary history of Rome, Politorium was one of a number of towns of the [[Latin League|Latins]] who went to [[Latin League#First war with Rome|war]] with [[ancient Rome]] in the 7th century BC, during the reign of the Roman King [[Ancus Marcius]].  The Romans' first move in the war was to march on Politorium and to take it by force.  The citizens of Politorium were removed to settle on the [[Aventine Hill]] in Rome as new citizens, following the Roman traditions from wars with the [[Sabines]] and [[Alba Longa|Albans]].  When the other Latins subsequently occupied the empty town of Politorium, Ancus took the town again and demolished it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:32-33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]], writing in the 1st century AD describes Politorium as one of a number of former Latin peoples that have disappeared without trace.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', 3:9&lt;/ref&gt;

The site of ancient Politorium has been identified&lt;ref&gt;See [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography]], Vol 2, 1857, pp644-5&lt;/ref&gt; as being the town of La Giostra on the Via Appia,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir William Gell]], ''The Topography of Rome and its Vicinity'', 1846 (new edition), 280-283&lt;/ref&gt; La Torretta near Decimo on the Via Larrentina&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonio Nibby]] ''Analisi storico-topografico-antiquaria della carta de' Dintorni di Roma'', 1830, vol 2 p571, vol3 pp146-52&lt;/ref&gt; or Castel di Decima.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fausto Zevi]] (see Bonnefoy, Y., and Doniger, W., ''Roman and European Mythologies'', 1992, p55)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Greek Law every Sunday of the year is a public holiday. In addition, there are four obligatory, official public holidays: March 25, Easter Monday, August 15 and December 25. Two more days, May 1 and October 28, are regulated by law as optional but it is customary for employees to be given the day off.  There are, however, more public holidays celebrated in Greece than are announced by the [[Ministry of Labour and Social Security (Greece)|Ministry of Labour]] each year as either of bligatory or optional. The list of these ''non-fixed'' National Holidays rarely changes and has not changed in recent decades, giving a total of twelve National Holidays each year.

A public holiday that occurs on a Sunday is not transferred to another date, with the exception of May 1, which is regarded by the locals more as a ''General strike'' than a Public Holiday.

In addition to the National Holidays, there are Public Holidays that are not celebrated nationwide, but only by a specific professional group or a local community. For example, many municipalities have a ''patron Saint'' also called 'Name Day' or a ''Liberation Day'', and at this day is customary for schools to have a day off.

With the exception of Formula D, each series are allocated two entries, including D1GP, who following negotiation, were given six invites&lt;ref name="wreckedmagazine2008/11/02"&gt;http://www.wreckedmagazine.com/blog/2008/11/02/formula-d-speaks-out-about-d1redbull-drama-on-driftingcom/&lt;/ref&gt;

When negotiation broke down, D1 drivers were discouraged from taking invites, therefore they were approached directly by the FD management to find out that they invited entrants, the former D1GP champions in particular, had to decline their entries&lt;ref name="wreckedmagazine2008/11/02"/&gt; for the reason of scheduling conflicts. Kumakubo declined his as he was due to take part in a drift demo in [[Dubai]],&lt;ref name="formuladblog749"/&gt; Kazama, despite no longer involved in the series, declined because of schedule clash.&lt;ref name="formuladblog749"/&gt;

Former D1GP judge, competitor and [[Super GT]] driver, Orido was forced to decline his invitation as he was competing in the [[World Touring Car Championship|WTCC]] [[Guia Race]] at [[Macau Grand Prix|Macau]] on the same weekend,&lt;ref name="formuladblog749"/&gt; as was fellow judge and returning competitor Taniguchi, was taking part in a Super Taikyu race in Japan.

Other than that,  and 2003 champion, Imamura declined his as he was unable to attend,&lt;ref name="formuladblog749"/&gt; the 2007 champion Kawabata declined his entry, but it was revealed that "[[conflict of interest]]" led them to decline. Saito, who originally accepted his entry, was forced to decline his entry for the same reason, although it was rumored that he placed two cars in a container to make its way to the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wreckedmagazine.com/blog/2008/10/31/more-redbull-drift-drama-daigo-saito-not-coming-anymore/|title=More Redbull Drift Drama: Daigo Saito Not Coming Anymore|work=Breaking Drift News|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millen backed this claim of the organisation's bullying tactic during an interview&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presstelegram.com/ci_10980595?source=rss |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214072925/http://www.presstelegram.com/ci_10980595?source=rss |archivedate=2012-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one FD driver, Tuerck, declined for budgetary reason as he is lacking a title sponsor, funding could not stretch for the event, therefore Mohan took his place.&lt;ref name="formuladblog749"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wreckedmagazine.com/blog/2008/10/28/ryan-tuerck-not-at-redbull/|title=Ryan Tuerck – Not at Redbull Championship|work=Breaking Drift News|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santos, Bolger and Ruiterman made up the rest of the available slot.

* [[Battle of St. George's Caye]] Day (alternatively, [[National Day]]), 10 September, celebrated since 1898;
* [[Independence Day]], 21 September, celebrated since 1981.

A calendar of activities has traditionally been held every year centred on both events. Annual traditions such as the Queen of the Bay pageant, concerts and talent shows, the Citizens Parade on the Tenth and Uniform Parade on the 21st and Carnival (traditionally held on the middle Saturday but has been held on other days) add to the Celebrations. 

In 2007, September Celebrations began on 31 August and concluded on 22 September with a postponed Carnival (it had been postponed for two weeks due to Hurricanes [[Hurricane Dean (2007)|Dean]] and [[Hurricane Felix (2007)|Felix]]).

The National Celebration Commission selects a theme for each year's celebrations. In 2018, it will be "''Belize Da Fi Wi – Now &amp; Forever, 8867"''.

[[File:Bodleian Libraries, Ticket of Stratford, 6 + 7 Sept 1769, announcing the Shakespeare Jubilee Festival.jpg|thumb|Part of a ticket announcing the Shakespeare Jubilee ([[Bodleian Libraries]], Oxford)]]

The '''Shakespeare Jubilee''' was staged in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] between 6 and 8 September 1769.{{sfn|Cunningham|2008|p=106}} The jubilee was organised by the [[actor]] and [[theatre manager]] [[David Garrick]] to celebrate the Jubilee of the birth of [[William Shakespeare]]. It had a major impact on the rising tide of [[bardolatry]] that led to Shakespeare's becoming established as the English [[national poet]]. [[Thomas Arne]] composed the song ''[[Soft Flowing Avon]]'' for the Jubilee.

Stratford was at the time a town with around 2,200 inhabitants.{{sfn|Pierce|2005|p=4}} Garrick, Britain's most famous Shakespearean actor and most influential theatre owner-manager, had the idea for the Jubilee when he was approached by the town's leaders who wanted him to fund a statue of Shakespeare to stand in the Town Hall. Garrick planned a major celebration with major figures from London's cultural, political and economic world attending. He oversaw the construction of a large [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]], based on that in [[Ranelagh Gardens]] in London, which could hold 1,000 spectators.{{sfn|Pierce|2005|pp=4–5}} "It is difficult to exaggerate how much space in the papers in the weeks and months beforehand was devoted to discussion of the Jubilee, announcing details of the program, advertising various accoutrements, reporting progress, speculating about its form, and attacking it."{{sfn|Tankard|2014|p=18}}

The Jubilee opened on 6 September with the firing of thirty [[cannons]] and the ringing of [[church bells]].{{sfn|Deelman|1964|p=175}} Various events were held to commemorate Shakespeare's life. It drew in many people from fashionable society, or who were involved in the London theatre. There were seven hundred people at the dinner on the first day.{{sfn|Deelman|1964|p=177}} On the second day bad weather began to disrupt the proceedings and flooded parts of the Rotunda when the banks of the [[River Avon (Warwickshire)|River Avon]] broke. The highlights of the second day were the unveiling of the new statue at the Town Hall and a [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]] held in the evening.{{sfn|Pierce|2005|pp=8–9}} Another notable event from the second day of the Jubilee was a speech by Garrick thanking the [[Shakespeare Ladies Club]] for making Shakespeare popular again and for their contribution to the memorial statue of Shakespeare in [[Poets' Corner]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].{{sfn|Stochholm|1964|p=91}}{{sfn|Dobson|1992|p=148}} The third day was to have seen a grand Shakespeare [[Procession|Pageant]] but the heavy rain forced this to be cancelled. Garrick later staged [[The Jubilee|the Pageant]] in the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] where it was a success, running for ninety performances.{{sfn|Pierce|2005|pp=9–10}} 

It was the first jubilee celebration of the life of Shakespeare, although it was held more than five years after the bicentenary of his birth in April 1564.{{sfn|Pierce|2005|p=4}} In spite of the impact it had on the rising popularity of Shakespeare and his works, none of his plays were performed during the Jubilee.{{sfn|Pierce|2005|p=9}}

The '''Singapore Fireworks Celebrations''' was an annual event held in [[Singapore]] as part of its [[National Day (Singapore)|National Day]] celebrations.  It featured several local and foreign teams which launched [[firework]]s displays on different nights.

==History==
First held in 2004 at [[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]], the event was initially known as the '''Singapore Fireworks Festival''' and organised by [[Unusual Productions]].

In 2007, the festival was renamed to '''Singapore Fireworks Celebrations''' and had a new organiser [[Festival Square Circle]]. The event cost over [[S$1]] million, and featured 130 varieties of fireworks over two days. The event was supported by the [[Singapore Tourism Board]].&lt;ref name="Mathavan"&gt;{{cite news | author = Shree Ann Mathavan | title = Watch the sky light up | publisher = ''[[The New Paper]]'' | date = 16 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of fireworks used grew in magnitude from 4,000 rounds used in 2004 to over 9,000 in 2006.

The '''Broadway League''', formerly the '''League of American Theatres and Producers''' and  '''League of New York Theatres and Producers''', is the national [[trade association]] for the [[Broadway theatre]] industry based in [[New York City|New York]], New York. Its members include theatre owners and operators, [[theatrical producer|producers]], [[Television presenter|presenter]]s, and general managers in New York and more than 250 other North American cities, as well as suppliers of goods and services to the theatre industry.

Founded in 1930 primarily to counter ticket speculation and scalping, the Broadway League has expanded its mission and programs over time. In addition to negotiating labor agreements with 14 unions in New York City and engaging in lobbying initiatives throughout the country, the League recognizes excellent works and artists through award programs such as Tony Awards, promotes the Broadway theatre industry through audience development programs such as Kids' Night on Broadway and Viva Broadway, and provides periodical studies and industry information such as box office grosses and demographic surveys for journalists, scholars, and the general public.

== Membership ==
The Broadway League has more than 700 members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=About the League| url=http://www.broadwayleague.com/index.php?url_identifier=about-the-league-1| website=The Broadway League| accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing the Broadway theatre industry in New York and more than 200 other North American cities across the United States.&lt;ref name="6 facts about the league"&gt;{{cite web| last1=Wright| first1=KC| title=6 Facts About the Broadway League| url=http://www.backstage.com/news/6-facts-about-broadway-league/| website=Backstage.com| accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to theatre owners, producers, presenters, and general managers who create productions and operate theatres across the country, industry specialists and vendors such as press agents, booking agents, advertising agencies, and scenery, costume, and prop shops are eligible for membership.&lt;ref name="Three Officers Elected"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Purcell| first1=Carey| title=Three Officers Elected to Broadway League's Board of Governors| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/three-officers-elected-to-broadway-leagues-board-of-governors-338820| accessdate=27 March 2015| work=[[Playbill]]| date=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The League was founded in 1930 as the "League of New York Theatres and Producers". It was founded by Broadway theatre operators to further common interests, with the main purpose of fighting [[ticket resale|ticket speculation and scalping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.broadwayleague.com/index.php?url_identifier=about-the-league-1| title=About The League| publisher=The Broadway League| accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original purpose of the League described in its charter was to “protect the general public patrons of the theater, owners of theatrical entertainments, operators of theaters and reputable theater ticket brokers against the evils of speculation of theater tickets.”&lt;ref name=Bloom&gt;{{cite book| title=Broadway: its history, people, and places: an encyclopedia| first=Ken| last=Bloom| ISBN=978-0-415-93704-7| publisher=Routledge| date=November 11, 2003| page=288| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fYbYyQjHwdsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Broadway:+its+history,+people,+and+places:+an+encyclopedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig1Yuv8-3VAhXF7YMKHYGIDzAQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=league&amp;f=false| accessdate=2017-08-23| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The League's first successful act was the writing of the Theater Ticket Code of Fair Practice (together with [[Actors' Equity]]) which became a state law in 1940.&lt;ref name=Bloom/&gt; These efforts are still relevant today, as ticket resellers in New York State are required to obtain a license from the Department of State and are prohibited from reselling tickets within 500 feet of theatres or box offices.&lt;ref name="6 facts about the league" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ticket Reseller FAQ"&gt;{{cite web| title=FAQ - Ticket Reseller| url=http://www.dos.ny.gov/licensing/ticketresell/ticket_faq.html| website=NYS Department of State| accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years the League expanded its charter several times. In 1938, the League became the official collective bargaining unit representing the theatre owners and producers on Broadway to negotiate labor agreements with unions such as Actors' Equity.&lt;ref name=Bloom/&gt;

With the decline of Broadway in the 1980s the League changed its name to the "League of American Theatres and Producers" and began to expand its domain to theatres across the United States.&lt;ref name=Bloom/&gt; On December 18, 2007 the League adopted its current name, "The Broadway League". In a press statement announcing the name change, the League explained that its membership is "not limited to theatre owners and producers, but includes Broadway presenters, general managers and other Broadway industry professionals," and the new name "more aptly reflects the composition of the League's membership." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Gans| first=Andrew| url=http://www.playbill.com/article/league-of-american-theatres-and-producers-announces-name-change-com-146262| title=League of American Theatres and Producers Announces Name Change| work=Playbill| accessdate=2017-08-23| date=December 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Labor negotiations ==
The Broadway League is a collective bargaining unit representing Broadway producers and theatre owners, and negotiates labor agreements with 14 unions in New York City to set the minimum terms (fees, salaries, work rules, etc.) for hiring union members. Broadway productions are fully unionized, and all employees are members of unions such as [[Actors' Equity Association]] (AEA), [[Stage Directors and Choreographers Society]] (SDC), Local 802 of [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM), and Local One of [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] (IATSE).&lt;ref name=Stein&gt;{{cite book| last1=Stein| first1=Tobie S.| last2=Bathurst| first2=Jessica| title=Performing Arts Management: A Handbook of Professional Practices| date=September 30, 2008| publisher=Allworth Press| location=New York City| isbn=978-1581156508| pages=373-382| subscription=yes| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=frcxAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Performing+Arts+Management:+A+Handbook+of+Professional+Practices&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6x4Lb9O3VAhVKPCYKHVo8CMsQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=broadway%20league&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broadway League also works with the [[Dramatists Guild of America]], an organization composed of playwrights, composers, and lyricists, to engage authors for Broadway productions. Even though the Guild is not a union because authors are not employees of producers or theatres, the Guild provides the Approved Production Contract, a contract template for authors to use in negotiations with producers.&lt;ref name=Stein /&gt;

Out of 40 existing Broadway theatres, the collectively bargained agreements the League negotiates with unions only apply to the theatres owned by the [[Shubert Organization]], [[Jujamcyn Theaters]], and the [[Nederlander Organization]]. Theatres owned and operated by not-for-profit organizations such as the [[Roundabout Theatre Company]], [[Lincoln Center Theater]], and [[Manhattan Theatre Club]] are under the jurisdiction of the [[League of Resident Theatres]] which negotiates separate agreements with unions. [[Disney Theatrical Group]], which owns the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]], also negotiates labor agreements independently, as well as a handful of others.&lt;ref name="2007 Strike 2"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Robertson| first1=Campbell| title=Broadway Strike Will Halt All but Eight Shows| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/theater/10broadway.html| accessdate=13 May 2015| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=10 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2007 Strike 1"&gt;{{cite news| title=Broadway Stagehands Look Close to Striking| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/09/theater/09broadway.html| accessdate=13 May 2015| work=The New York Times| date=9 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Broadway stagehand strike in 2007 ===
{{main|2007 Broadway Stagehand Strike}}

The most recent strike on Broadway occurred in November 2007, when the Broadway League and the stagehands union, Local One of IATSE, failed to come to agreement after months of negotiation. Local One was joined by other Broadway unions such as AEA and SDC, and 27 shows running on Broadway were shut down. This marked the first strike on Broadway in Local One’s 120-year history, and the strike lasted for 19 days, recording the longest strike on Broadway since 1975.&lt;ref name="2007 Strike 3"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Robertson| first1=Campbell| title=Stagehands End Walkout on Broadway| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/29/theater/29broadway.html?_r=0| accessdate=13 May 2015| work=The New York Times| date=29 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic impact of the strike spread beyond the Broadway shows, to nearby restaurants, hotels, gift shops, and bars. Tim Tompkins, the head of the Times Square Business Improvement District, explained that “a lot of folks come to New York specifically to go to a Broadway show and with this cloud of uncertainty, they postpone or cancel their trips. So that’s a double hit." &lt;ref name="2007 Strike 4"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Gans| first1=Andrew| title=Day 5: Most of Broadway Remains Dark| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/day-5-most-of-broadway-remains-dark-145401|accessdate=13 May 2015| work=Playbill| date=14 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the New York City comptroller’s office, the strike resulted in $2 million in lost revenue per day in addition to the lost ticket sales, mounting to $40 million total.&lt;ref name="2007 Strike 3" /&gt;

The main conflict in the negotiation was the work rules regarding load-ins. The existing contract required producers to determine a number of stagehands needed for the load-in ahead of time, and hire and pay all of them every day for the entire load-in period, which could take weeks to months for large-scale productions. However, because the workload differs everyday, many stagehands often just stayed in the theatres with nothing to do. The new contract set the daily minimum during the load-in to 17 stagehands, allowing the producers to hire stagehands based on daily workload.&lt;ref name="2007 Strike 3" /&gt;

=== Broadway musicians strike in 2003 ===
{{main|2003 Broadway Musicians Strike}}

The Local 802 of AFM, the union representing the musicians on Broadway, entered into a strike in March 2003 and was joined by other Broadway unions such as AEA and IATSE. The strike lasted from Friday, March 7, 2003, to early Tuesday morning, March 11, 2003.&lt;ref name="2003 Strike 1"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Pogrebin| first1=Robin| title=Theater Strike Ends After All-Night Talks| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/11/nyregion/11CND-STRIKE.html| accessdate=13 May 2015| work=The New York Times| date=11 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus of the negotiation was the minimum number of musicians required to be employed in Broadway theatres. The labor agreement required 24 to 25 musicians to be employed in largest theatres, regardless of the needs of the actual productions presented. Under the new agreement, the minimums were reduced to 18 to 19.&lt;ref name="2003 Strike 1"/&gt;

== Government relations ==
The Broadway League has advocated for the needs of commercial theatre industry with local, state and national elected officials throughout its history, beginning with writing of the Theater Ticket Code of Fair Practice which became a state law in 1940. Recent lobbying efforts by the League include opposing an 8 percent levy on theatre tickets proposed by Governor [[David Paterson]] in 2009, and securing tax deductions for suppliers of physical goods used by theatrical productions.&lt;ref name="Tax Lobbying 3"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Healy|first1=Patrick|title=Paterson Eliminates Proposed Tax on Theater Tickets| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/paterson-eliminates-new-levy-on-theater-tickets/| accessdate=27 March 2015| work=The New York Times| date=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Tax Lobbying 2" /&gt;

===Wireless microphone spectrum===
The Broadway League, in conjunction with the [[National Football League]] and large churches, is protesting against the [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]]’s plans to auction the frequencies used by wireless microphones used in theatres and venues throughout the U.S.&lt;ref name="FCC Lobbying 1"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Wyatt| first1=Edward| title=U.S. May Sell Airwaves That Help Broadway Sing| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/business/fcc-has-yen-for-broadways-wireless-spectrum.html| accessdate=27 March 2015| work=The New York Times| date=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FCC Lobbying 2"&gt;{{cite episode| last1=Karr| first1=Rick| title=NFL, Broadway Fight FCC Auction Of Broadcast Spectrum| url=https://www.npr.org/2014/11/11/363342242/nfl-broadway-fight-fcc-auction-of-broadcast-spectrum| accessdate=2017-08-23| network=[[NPR]]| series=All Things Considered| series-link=All Things Considered| air-date=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Support Theaters in America Growth and Expansion Act===
As a result of lobbying initiatives by the Broadway League, in February 2015, Sen. [[Charles Schumer]] (D-N.Y.) and Sen. [[Roy Blunt]] (R-Mo.) reintroduced legislation named The Support Theaters in America Growth and Expansion Act that would provide Broadway and live theatrical productions federal tax benefits already given to film and TV productions.&lt;ref name="Tax Lobbying 1"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Johnson| first1=Ted| title=Sen.

The League hopes that the benefits of Section 181 would make attracting investors easier, because the investors are currently paying income taxes before recoupment, without making any profit from projects.&lt;ref name="Tax Lobbying 2"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Cox| first1=Gordon| title=Broadway May Be Closer to Earning an IRS Write-Off| url=https://variety.com/2013/legit/news/broadway-may-be-closer-to-earning-an-irs-write-off-1200502802/|accessdate=27 March 2015| work=Variety| date=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Award programs ==

=== The Tony Awards ===
{{main|Tony Awards}}
[[File:Robert Lopez Jeff Marx Tony Awards.jpg|thumb|2004 Tony Award for Best Original Score winner, Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx]]
The Antoinette Perry Awards for Excellence in Theatre, more commonly known as the Tony Awards, recognize achievement in live American theatre. The Tony Awards are presented by the Tony Award Productions, a joint venture of [[American Theatre Wing]] and the League, at an annual ceremony in [[New York City]]. The awards are mostly for [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions and performances, though an award for regional theatres and discretionary non-competitive [[Special Tony Award]] and the [[Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre]] are also given.&lt;ref name=TonyHistory&gt;{{cite web| title=History|  publisher=The Tony Awards| url=http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/archive/index.html| accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/about/index.html| publisher=The Tony Awards| title=Who's Who| accessdate=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards were founded by the Wing in 1947, and the League became a co-presenter in 1967.&lt;ref name=TonyHistory/&gt;{{sfn|Bloom|2003|p=531-532}}

Prior to 2000, membership in what was then the League of American Theaters and Producers was lifetime for all dues-paying above-the-title producers of Broadway shows.  Members received two free tickets to all Broadway shows, and ballots for the Tony Awards, vouching that they had seen all shows in every category in which they voted. In 2000, the League changed membership eligibility to "active" producers, those who had been above-the-title in the previous 10 years. This action dis-enfranchised scores of Tony voters, including [[Gail Berman]], [[Harve Brosten]], [[Dick Button]], [[Tony Lo Bianco]], and [[Raymond Serra]].

=== The Touring Broadway Awards ===
{{main|Touring Broadway Awards}}

The Touring Broadway Awards (TBAs) recognized outstanding achievement in touring productions of Broadway [[play (theatre)|plays]] and [[musical theatre|musicals]] in North America from 2000 to 2009.
Founded in 2000-2001 season by the League, the awards were known until 2004 as the National Broadway Theatre Awards.&lt;ref name="Playbill.com: Touring Broadway Awards 2"&gt;{{cite web| last1=Simonson| first1=Robert| title=National Broadway Theatre Awards Presented on May 21| date=May 21, 2001| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/national-broadway-theatre-awards-presented-on-may-21-96727| work=Playbill| accessdate=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards were presented by the League to "celebrate excellence in touring Broadway by honoring the artists and productions that visit cities across the country each year."&lt;ref name="Playbill.com: Touring Broadway Awards"&gt;{{cite web| last1=Gans| first1=Andrew| title=Minnelli and Zaks Will Be Presenters at Touring Broadway Awards| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/minnelli-and-zaks-will-be-presenters-at-touring-broadway-awards-160504| work=Playbill| accessdate=11 March 2015| date=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concert programs ==
[[File:Cast of Rent performing "Seasons of Love" at Broadway on Broadway, 2005.jpg|thumb|Cast of ''Rent'' performing "Seasons of Love" at Broadway on Broadway, 2005]]
The Broadway League produces various concert programs such as ''Broadway on Broadway'' and ''Stars in the Alley'' to promote productions currently running on Broadway.

''Broadway on Broadway'' was a free annual outdoor concert kicking off the Broadway season each September, usually on the first Sunday after Labor Day, produced by the League and the Times Square Alliance. Initially conceived as a welcome party for delegates to the 1992 [[Democratic National Convention]] in New York, the event took place on a special stage created for the event in [[Times Square]], featuring musical numbers from current Broadway shows as well as upcoming shows opening in the new season.&lt;ref name="Broadway on Broadway"&gt;{{cite web| title=Broadway on Broadway| url=http://www.timessquarenyc.org/events/broadway-on-broadway/index.aspx#.VQCwlIGG-oW| website=The Official Site of Times Square| publisher=Times Square Alliance| accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concert returned in July 1993 and 1994 and moved to September on 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.broadwayleague.com/broadway-on-broadway/index.php?url_identifier=the-concert| title=The Concert| publisher=The Broadway League| accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The League canceled ''Broadway on Broadway'' in 2013 and it did not return in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Gilbert| first1=Ryan| title=Broadway on Broadway Outdoor Concert in Times Square Canceled for 2013| url=http://www.broadway.com/buzz/171654/broadway-on-broadway-outdoor-concert-in-times-square-canceled-for-2013/| website=Broadway.com| accessdate=11 March 2015| date=September 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Stars in the Alley'' is a free annual outdoor concert in [[Shubert Alley]] in the heart of Manhattan’s [[Theater District, New York|Theatre District]], produced by the League. It is usually held during the week of the Tony Awards, and marks the official end of the Broadway season. The 21st annual event was held on June 6, 2007, and the casts of dozens of Broadway shows took part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Mark| last=Rupp| url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Photo_Coverage_Stars_in_the_Alley_2007_20070607| title=Photo Coverage: Stars in the Alley 2007| publisher=Broadway World| accessdate=2010-07-07| date=June 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the event was not held from 2008 to 2013, it returned in 2014 featuring [[Norm Lewis]] as the host.&lt;ref name="Theatermania: Stars in the Alley"&gt;{{cite web| last1=Gordon| first1=David| title=Phantom Star Norm Lewis Will Host Broadway's 2014 Stars in the Alley Concert| url=http://www.theatermania.com/new-york-city-theater/news/05-2014/phantom-star-norm-lewis-will-host-broadways-2014-s_68465.html| website=Theatermania.com| accessdate=11 March 2015| date=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tony Awards Preview Concert'' was a cabaret-style concert featuring songs from Tony-nominated shows held in 2008, 2009 and 2013. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Andrew| last=Gans| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/126513-2008-Tony-Preview-Concert-Nominated-for-a-New-York-Emmy-Award| title=2008 Tony Preview Concert Nominated for a New York Emmy Award| work=Playbill| accessdate=2010-07-07| date=February 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Andrew| last=Gans| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/129688-Tony-Awards-Preview-Concert-Hosted-By-Harry-Smith-Airs-May-30| title=Tony Awards Preview Concert, Hosted By Harry Smith, Airs May 30| work=Playbill| accessdate=2010-07-07| date=30 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 concert, hosted by [[Mario Lopez]], was aired at various times and dates in 18 cities across the United States and included interviews from the then Tony nominees such as [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]], [[Andrea Martin]], [[Mark Rylance]], and [[Rob Ashford]].&lt;ref name="tv"&gt;{{cite web| title=Lopez Hosts Tony Award Preview Concert Nationwide| url=http://broadway.tv/lopez-hosts-tony-award-preview-concert-nationwide/| website=Broadway.tv| accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other concert programs include ''Broadway Under the Stars'', an annual evening concert held from 2002 to 2006, and a benefit concert for Viva Broadway, an audience development initiative specifically targeted to Hispanic communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first1=Andrew| last1=Gans| first2=Ernio| last2=Hernandez| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/100502-Broadway-Under-the-Stars-Heads-to-Central-Park-June-26| title="Broadway Under the Stars" Heads to Central Park June 26| work=Playbill| accessdate=2010-07-07| date=26 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Robert| last=Simonson|authorlink1=Robert Simonson| url=http://www.playbill.com/article/broadway-under-the-stars-debuts-in-nycs-bryant-park-june-10-com-106271| title=Broadway Under the Stars" Debuts in NYC's Bryant Park, June 10| work=Playbill| accessdate=2010-07-07| date=4 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Viva Broadway Benefit Concert"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Gioia| first1=Michael| title=Gloria Estefan &amp; Miami Sound Machine Will Hit Broadway's Minskoff for One Night Only| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/gloria-estefan-miami-sound-machine-will-hit-broadways-minskoff-for-one-night-only-339292| work=Playbill| date=14 January 2015| accessdate=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Audience development programs ==
The Broadway League leads audience development programs targeting specific communities to broaden the audience base for Broadway productions. For example, [[Kids' Night on Broadway]] was created by the League and the [[Theater Development Fund]] to provide families across the U.S. affordable access to Broadway productions. On Kids' Night On Broadway, children between ages 6 to 18 receive free tickets to participating Broadway shows when accompanied by a paying adult.&lt;ref name="Kids' Night On Broadway"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Pogrebin| first1=Robin| title=Broadway Goes To School to Get 'Em Young; A Drive to Turn Children Into Avid Theatergoers| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/18/theater/broadway-goes-school-get-em-young-drive-turn-children-into-avid-theatergoers.html?pagewanted=print| accessdate=23 March 2015| work=The New York Times| date=18 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Family First Nights introduce economically at-risk families to Broadway productions in New York as well as around the country through subsidized tickets.

In 2012, the League launched a new audience development program named Viva Broadway, which focuses on Hispanic communities around the country. Working with Hispanic media outlets, Viva Broadway aims to promote Broadway to Hispanic families, proposing theatergoing experiences that fit their lifestyles and cultural traditions to engage in family activities involving multiple generations.&lt;ref name="Viva Broadway 1"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Gioia| first1=Michael| title=The Broadway League Launches Viva Broadway Initiative; Raúl Esparza, Karen Olivo, Chita Rivera Among Advisory Board| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/the-broadway-league-launches-viva-broadway-initiative-raul-esparza-karen-ol-193521| accessdate=26 April 2015| work=Playbill| date=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadway Speakers Bureau, a program that encourages high school and college students to pursue non-performance careers in theatre, was also created as a part of Viva Broadway.&lt;ref name="Viva Broadway 2"&gt;{{cite news| title=10 Facts to Know About The Broadway League, Co-Presenter of The Tony Awards| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/10-facts-to-know-about-the-broadway-league-co-presenter-of-the-tony-aw-322058/print?r=n| accessdate=26 April 2015| work=Playbill| date=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services ==

===Internet Broadway Database===
{{main|Internet Broadway Database}}

Operated by the research department of the League, The Internet Broadway Database (IBDB) is an online [[database]] of Broadway theatre productions and their personnel, including lengths of runs, lists of casts and creators, awards and nominations, and past box office grosses.&lt;ref name="TicketNews: IBDB App" /&gt; It is "a definitive source for the facts on Broadway musicals and plays from Aristophanes to Ziegfeld," according to the New York Public Library.&lt;ref name="NYPL: IBDB"&gt;{{cite web| title=Internet Broadway Database| url=http://www.nypl.org/collections/articles-databases/internet-broadway-database| website=New York Public Library| accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the League introduced a free iOS app for IBDB that contain much of the same information as the website, as well as photos and videos from current Broadway productions.&lt;ref name="TicketNews: IBDB App"&gt;{{cite news| last1=LaFountain| first1=Kristina| title=The Broadway League develops IBDB application| url=http://www.ticketnews.com/news/the-broadway-league-develops-IBDB-application0312595| accessdate=28 March 2015| publisher=TicketNews| date=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===

The League serves as the central hub for statistical information about Broadway theatre production in North America. Its research department maintains historical data on individual playhouses and productions. In addition, many reference documents, including weekly box office grosses and season-by-season statistics, are available to the public, journalists, and scholars via the website. Theatre publications such as ''The New York Times'', ''Playbill'', and ''Variety'' publish databases and articles using data provided by the League.

The research department also publishes annual reports that track trends in the industry over time including the Demographics of the Broadway Audience and Broadway’s Economic Contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=|url=http://www.broadwayleague.com/index.php?url_identifier=research-and-information-1|title=Research &amp; Statistics |publisher=The Broadway League| accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; To obtain demographic information, the League hands out questionnaires at select performances to directly survey audience members. The survey tracks basic demographic information such as their gender, age, place of residence, and ethnicity, as well as theatergoing behaviors such as the number of plays and musicals they have attended in the past six months. For example, ''The New York Times'' reported that "tourists accounted for nearly two-thirds of the tickets sold for Broadway shows" and "those who saw 15 shows or more made up only 5 percent of the overall audience, but accounted for 29 percent of admissions" in 2010-11 season based on the studies published by the League.&lt;ref name="Demographic Research"&gt;{{cite news| last1=Schuessler| first1=Jennifer| title=Tourists Increase Share of Broadway Ticket Sales| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/03/tourists-increase-share-of-broadway-ticket-sales/| accessdate=26 April 2015| work=The New York Times| date=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Synodic Act on the heretic of Armenia, the monk Martin''' ([[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]]: Собо́рное дҍѧ́нїе на єретика́ армѧни́на, на мни́ха марти́на) is a forged document ([[Act (document)|act]]) created at the beginning of the 18th century by [[Dimitry of Rostov|Dimitry Rostovsky]] shortly before his death to be used against the [[Old Ritualism|Old Rite]], and it was actively used by the missionaries of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] during the [[wikipedia:Peter the Great#Religion|Synodal Period]] in an attempt to convert the [[Old Believers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://semeyskie.ru/bibl_meln_kiss.html|title=Семейские - староверы Забайкалья|website=semeyskie.ru|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main character of the ''Synodic Act'' is Martin Armenin or Martin the Armenian - a [[heretic]] and a [[monk]]. Martin Armenin was included as the name of a true person in many authoritative historical monographs and in liturgical texts by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

Today, the Russian Orthodox Church recognizes that the work is a forgery, as stated by Patriarch Kirill in the Russian Orthodox Encyclopedia.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pravenc.ru/|title=Православная Энциклопедия под редакцией Патриарха Московского и всея Руси Кирилла (электронная версия)|website=www.pravenc.ru|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background Information and Reasons for Creating the Forgery ==
In the middle of the 17th century, a series of reforms to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] were made by [[Patriarch Nikon of Moscow|Patriarch Nikon]], with the goal of ensuring the future unity of the Orthodox Church. To this end, uniquely Russian rituals were declared heretical, and those who continued using these rituals were proclaimed heretics and [[anathematized]]. (Some then-saints were also included in these anathemas, such as [[Anna of Kashin|Saint Anna of Kashin]]''',''' whom had been previously glorified).
[[File:Dimitry Rostovsky (GIM).jpg|left|thumb|Dimitry of Rostov]]
Even before the start of the reform, [[Arseny (Sukhanov)]] had a debate with theologians of the [[Patriarchate of Antioch]] and the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Patriarchate of Constantinople]] (ethically Arab and Greek Christians, respectively, who followed the [[Byzantine Rite|liturgical practices of the late Eastern Roman Empire]]) regarding how to fold the fingers while making the sign of the cross. These theologians reproached Arseny, claiming that the Russians were baptized with the sign of the cross in the same way as the Armenians, to which Arseny accurately replied that the Armenians preserved the more ancient tradition (despite the widespread belief at the time that the Armenians were [[Monophysitism|monophysite]] heretics).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.portal-credo.ru/site/print.php?act=lib&amp;id=1174|title=Портал-Credo.ru: Арсений Суханов.  Прения с греками о вере.  [история Церкви]|website=www.portal-credo.ru|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, even though this debate had already occurred, the Patriarch of Antioch [[Macarios III Zaim|Macarius]] dismissed the work of Arseny and announced at the Moscow Local Council in 1656 that those who continued [[baptizing]] with the two-finger sign of the cross were "arrogant imitators" of the Armenians' supposed "heresy". Historians today, such as the Russian historian [[Boris Uspensky|B.A. Uspensky]], go even further than Arseny and suggest that the Armenians – like the Russians – had in fact adopted the two-finger sign of the cross from the Christians in the Eastern Roman Empire before the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Успенский Б. А. Крестное знамение и сакральное пространство. Параграф 4. Обвинение старообрядцев в следовании армянской традиции&lt;/ref&gt;

After the anathemas of the Synod of 1656 and the [[Great Moscow Synod]], and the unsuccessful but brutal repressions of those who continued using the Old Rite a new direction was chosen to fight the Old Rite: the doubling of the taxes of Old Believers and the use of forgeries. Following this decision, the future Russian Orthodox saint [[Dimitry of Rostov]] created the ''Synodic Act''.

== The Forgery ==
Less than a year before his death, during the reign of [[Peter the Great|Peter I]], Dimitry of Rostov create the forged anti-[[Old Ritualism|Old Rite]] work ''The Synodic Act on the Heretic of Armenia, the Martyr Martin''. The document claims that a monk and heretic named Martin, an Armenian, arrived in Russia from Constantinople in 1149, and pretending to be a [[Byzantine Empire|Roman]] and a relative of the patriarch [[Luke Chrysoberges]], began to preach in Russia various heresies. These heresies consisted of a combination of Armenian and Latin heresies (and according to the ''Acts'', Martin learned this heresy Rome itself). Subsequently, adopted by the Russians, the heresy consisted of making the sign of the cross with two fingers, saying the Jesus Prayer instead of the name of the Trinity while making the sign of the cross, and using two alleluias instead of three alleluias. Especially for his heresy of making the sign of the cross with two fingers, he was condemned at the Council of Kiev in 1160, under the [[Rostislav I of Kiev|Grand Duke Rostislav Mstislavich]] and Metropolitan Constantine. Later, he was condemned at the Council of Constantinople during the following year, 1161, under [[Luke Chrysoberges|Patriarch Luke Chrysoberges]]. Subsequently, Martin was burned.
 
== Authorship and publication of the work ==
The first mention of the imaginary Council on the never-existing heretic Martin is found in the book "Mirror of the Orthodox Confession" (1709 year) from the Metropolitan Dimitry of Rostov, he writes: "To depict the same sign of the cross should be with three large fingers of the right hand, combined together. For so ordered by the Council, which was in Kiev about the monk Martin, and the holy patriarch of [[Macarios III Zaim|Antioch Makarius]] also teaches in reply to the interrogative message of the [[Patriarch Nikon of Moscow|Patriarch of Russian Nikon]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://azbyka.ru/otechnik/?Dmitrij_Rostovskij/zertsalo-pravoslavnogo-ispovedanija=1 Святитель Димитрий Ростовский.

Pitirim in his book «Prashchitsa dukhovnaya» («Spiritual [[Sling (weapon)|sling]]») says that he helped to find him  "The synodic act of the heretic of Armenin, the monk Martin" Dimitry of Rostov. Dimitry of Rostov gave Pitirim, the list of "The synodic act of the heretic of Armenin, the monk Martin", who was with him and which he wrote off from the ancient original document that was in Kiev&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Карлович, Владимир Михайлович|Карлович В.

According to the official version, set forth by Archbishop [[:ru:Макарий (Миролюбов)|Macarius Mirolyubov]] in the book "History of the Nizhny Novgorod Hierarchy", [[:ru:Питирим (архиепископ Нижегородский)|Pitirim]] at first had not the ancient document on hand, but only a copy with it. This is a copy that Pitirim valued, written by Dimitry of Rostov in the beginning of the XVIII century, did not convince the Old Believers during the dispute with Pitirim in 1711 in the existence of both the Council against Martin Armenin and the existence of Martin himself. The Old Believers suggested that Pitirim find an authentic ancient document. In 1717 Pitirim addressed this occasion with a request to Patriarchal [[locum tenens]] Metropolitan [[Stefan Yavorsky]] and asked him to send the faithful monk to Kiev with the Tsar's decree for the sake of finding the original ancient document — Synodic Act and that the Kyivan bishop ordered to search in all book depositories without obstruction. Thanks to this petition, by the decree of Metropolitan Stephen in August 1717, the monk Theophylact of the [[:ru:Успенский Кержебельмашский монастырь|Dormition Kerzhebel'mashskiy Monastery]], administered by Pitirim, was sent to Kiev to find the true Synodic Act. September 3, 1717 Theophylact arrived in Kiev. Here they began to search for the Synodic Act on the orders of Kyiv Metropolitan [[:ru:Иоасаф (Кроковский)|Ioasaph Krakovsky]] in all libraries. The search was not left without success. The Synodic Act was found in the library of the ancient [[:ru:Pustynno-Nikolayevskiy Monastery|Пустынно-Николаевский монастырь]] and sent to Moscow along with nine other ancient books&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Макарий (Миролюбов)|Макарий (Миролюбов)]] [https://books.google.ru/books?id=ot5bAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ru#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false «История нижегородской иерархии, содержащая в себе сказание о нижегородских иерархах с 1672 до 1850 года.». издание книгопродавца Н.Г.

A book with a story about the alleged heretic Martin was printed with the blessing of the Most Holy Synod repeatedly, in 1721, 1726, 1752, and finally in 1913. In addition, [[Dimitry of Rostov]] was canonized, and at the end of the 18th century he was written by an akathist which included a section about Martin. The akathist was written by a priest of the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour|Moscow Cathedral of Christ the Savior]], John Alexeyev. The text of the akathist was studied at three meetings of the Holy Synod in 1800 (July 2, July 13 and August 8). The synod then approved the text of the akathist and gave him the blessing to print it, which was done,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Русский: Православные Русскiе акаѳисты, изданные съ благословенiя Святѣйшаго Синода / Православные русские акафисты, изданные с благословения Святейшего Синода|date=|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B2_%D0%90.%D0%92._-_%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%84%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8B,_%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D1%81_%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%A1%D0%B2%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B9%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%A1%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B0_-_1903.pdf&amp;page=127|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is still the akathist used for him today.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rostov-monastir.ru/page/tropar-kondak-molitva-i-akafist-sv-dimitriju-rostovskomu/next/3|title=Тропарь, кондак, молитва и акафист св.

== Changing views ==
[[Old Believers]] argued that the ''Synodic Act'' and the heretic Martin were myths from the time of the document's publication, pointing out that it contains historical inconsistencies regarding the life of princes and metropolitans. But the opinion of the Old Believers was not taken into account, as they were the ones that it supposedly contained damaging information about. It was only later during the 19th century that Russian scholars started examining the ''Synodic Act'' critically. It turned out that in the 12th century, both in Russia and Byzantium, the sign of the cross was made with two fingers, and such a document would not have been made under any pretext at all. In addition, the very text of the "ancient" manuscript turned out to be a forgery of the 18th century.

[[Nikolay Karamzin|Nikolai Mikhailovich Karamzin]] was the first of these 18th century critics. He was skeptical about the exposition of Martin's story and the fragments of the "Act" as it was relayed in a document called the "Prayshchitsa" (access to the manuscript was still sealed at that time).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dlib.rsl.ru/viewer/01003952610|title=Просмотр документа - dlib.rsl.ru|website=dlib.rsl.ru|language=ru|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to pointing out various text anachronisms and signs that it had been written in a more recent period of Russian language history, he also pointed out the silence on the case of Martin in all available ancient sources. In 1854 permission was given to access the "ancient manuscript" and to study in detail was finally granted to researchers. After examining the document one of the researchers, [[Kapiton Ivanovich Nevostruev]], called it a "compilation of the falsehood".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=GeQBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0+%D0%90%D1%80%D0%BC%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MQXlUdXsN87a4QSL1YCgAg&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBjg8|title=Sbornik pravitel'stvennych svredenij o raskol'nikach|last=Kel'siev|first=Vasilij I.|date=1860|publisher=Trübner|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=8jk-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0+%D0%90%D1%80%D0%BC%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MQXlUdXsN87a4QSL1YCgAg&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBzg8|title=Опроверженіе записки о русском расколѣ|date=1864|publisher=В тип.

[[Alexander Lvovich Sinai]], [[Nikolai Fyodorovich Kapterev|Kapterev]], [[Evgeny Evgenevich Golubinsky|Golubinsky]], [[Alexander Vasilyevich Gorsky|Gorsky]], and other researchers on the history of the Russian Orthodox Church have corroborated the conclusions of Karamzin and Nevostruev. Today, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] recognizes that the work is a forgery. As stated by [[Patriarch Kirill of Moscow|Patriarch Kirill]] in the Russian Orthodox Encyclopedia, "there is no doubt about the falsity of the ''Synodic Act''".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{Politics of the United States}}
The '''election of President and Vice President of the United States''' is an [[indirect election]] in which [[Citizenship of the United States|citizens of the United States]] who are [[Voter registration in the United States|registered to vote]] in one of the 50 [[U.S. state]]s or in [[Washington, D.C.]] cast ballots not directly for those offices, but instead for members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|U.S. Electoral College]], known as electors. These electors then in turn cast direct votes, known as electoral votes, for [[President of the United States|President]], and for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. The candidate who receives an [[Majority of the entire membership|absolute majority]] of electoral votes (at least 270 out of a total of 538, since the [[Twenty-Third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-Third Amendment]] granting voting rights to citizens of [[Washington, D.C.]]) is then elected to that office. If no candidate receives an absolute majority of the votes for President, the [[House of Representatives of the United States|House of Representatives]] chooses the winner; if no one receives an absolute majority of the votes for Vice President, then the [[United States Senate|Senate]] chooses the winner.

The Electoral College and its procedure are established in the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] by [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II, Section 1, Clauses 2 and 4]]; and the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] (which replaced Clause 3 after its ratification in 1804). Under Clause 2, each of the states casts as many electoral votes as the total number of its [[United States Senate|Senators]] and [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] in [[United States Congress|Congress]], while, per the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-third Amendment]] ratified in 1961, Washington, D.C. casts the same number of electoral votes as the least-represented state, which is three. Also under Clause 2, the manner for choosing electors is determined by each [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]], not directly by the federal government. Many state legislatures previously selected their electors directly, but over time all of them switched to using the [[Popular vote (representative democracy)|popular vote]] to help determine electors, which persists today. Once chosen, electors generally cast their electoral votes for the candidate who won the [[plurality voting system|plurality]] in their state, but at least 21 states do not have provisions that specifically address this behavior; those who vote in opposition to the plurality are known as "[[faithless electors|faithless"]] or "[[unpledged electors]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dixon|first=Robert G., Jr.|title=Electoral College Procedure|jstor=443484|journal=The Western Political Quarterly|volume=3|issue=2|year=1950|doi=10.2307/443484}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, faithless and unpledged electors have not affected the ultimate outcome of an election, so the results can generally be determined based on the state-by-state popular vote.

[[Presidential elections]] occur [[wikt:quadrennial|quadrennially]] with registered voters casting their ballots on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]], which since 1845 has been the first Tuesday after November 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|3|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caldwell|first1=Leigh Ann|title=A Viewer's Guide to the Next Year in Presidential Politics|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/viewers-guide-next-year-presidential-politics-n455971|accessdate=November 8, 2015|publisher=NBC News|date=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Andrew|title=Could a Hurricane Like Sandy Postpone the Presidential Election?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/10/could-a-hurricane-like-sandy-postpone-the-presidential-election/264254/|accessdate=November 8, 2015|publisher=The Atlantic|date=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This date coincides with the general elections of various other federal, state, and local races; since local governments are responsible for managing elections, these races typically all appear on one ballot. The Electoral College electors then formally cast their electoral votes on the first Monday after December 12 at their respective state capitals. Congress then certifies the results in early January, and the presidential term begins on [[Inauguration Day]], which since the passage of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]] has been set at January 20.

The nomination process, consisting of the [[United States presidential primary|primary elections and caucuses]] and the [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating conventions]], was not specified in the Constitution, but was developed over time by the states and [[Political parties in the United States|political parties]]. These primary elections are generally held between January and June before the general election in November, while the nominating conventions are held in the summer. Though not codified by law, political parties also follow an indirect election process, where voters in the 50 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., and [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]], cast ballots for a slate of delegates to a political party's nominating convention, who then in turn elect their party's presidential nominee. Each party may then choose a vice presidential [[running mate]] to join the ticket, which is either determined by choice of the nominee or by a second round of voting. Because of changes to national campaign finance laws since the 1970s regarding the disclosure of contributions for federal campaigns, presidential candidates from the major political parties usually declare their intentions to run as early as the spring of the previous calendar year before the election (almost 18 months before Inauguration Day).&lt;ref name="WAPOST20150403"/&gt;

[[File:2016 Presidential Election ballot.jpg|right|thumb|A 2016 general election ballot, listing the presidential and vice presidential candidates]]

==History==

[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] of the [[United States Constitution]] originally established the method of presidential elections, including the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. This was a result of a compromise between those constitutional framers who wanted the Congress to choose the president, and those who preferred a national popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary Bugh|title=Electoral College Reform: Challenges and Possibilities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XdSmtbZg9_YC|year=2010|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-7751-2|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XdSmtbZg9_YC&amp;pg=PA40 40]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each [[U.S. state|state]] is allocated a number of electors that is equal to the size of its delegation in both houses of Congress combined. With the ratification of the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|23rd Amendment]] to the Constitution in 1961, the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] is also granted a number of electors, equal to the number of those held by the least populous state. However, [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] are not represented in the Electoral College.

Constitutionally, the manner for choosing electors is determined within each state by its legislature; Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 states that each state shall appoint electors "in such Manner as the Legislature Thereof May Direct."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard A. Epstein]], [https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5103&amp;context=uclrev {{"'}}In Such Manner as the Legislature Thereof May Direct": The Outcome in ''Bush v Gore'' Defended], 68 ''University of Chicago Law Review'' 613, 614 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; During [[United States presidential election, 1789|the first presidential election in 1789]], only six of the 13 original states chose electors by any form of popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;Of the 13 original states during the [[United States presidential election, 1789|1789 election]], six states chose electors by some form of popular vote, four states chose electors by a different method, [[North Carolina]] and [[Rhode Island]] were ineligible to participate since they had not yet ratified the U.S. Constitution, and [[New York (state)|New York]] failed to appoint their allotment of electors in time because of a deadlock in their state legislature.&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually throughout the years, the states began conducting popular elections to choose their slate of electors. In 1800, only five of the 16 states chose electors by a popular vote; by 1824, after the rise of [[Jacksonian democracy]], the proportion of states that chose electors by popular vote had sharply risen to 18 out of 24 states.&lt;ref name="Norton"&gt;Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation: A History of the United States'', Vol. I (11th ed. 2019), p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; This gradual movement toward greater [[democratization]] coincided with a gradual decrease in [[Voting rights in the United States|property restrictions for the franchise]].&lt;ref name="Norton"/&gt; By [[United States presidential election, 1840|1840]], only one of the 26 states ([[South Carolina]]) still selected electors by the state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Richard Deskins, Hanes Walton &amp; Sherman C. Puckett, ''Presidential Elections, 1789–2008: County, State, and National Mapping of Election Data'' (University of Michigan Press, 2010), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the original system established by Article Two, electors could cast two votes to two different candidates for president. The candidate with the highest number of votes (provided it was a majority of the electoral votes) became the president, and the second-place candidate became the vice president. This presented a problem during the [[United States presidential election, 1800|presidential election of 1800]] when [[Aaron Burr]] received the same number of electoral votes as [[Thomas Jefferson]] and challenged Jefferson's election to the office. In the end, Jefferson was chosen as the president because of [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s influence in the House of Representatives.

In response to the 1800 election, the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]] was passed, requiring electors to cast two distinct votes: one for President and another for Vice President. While this solved the problem at hand, it ultimately had the effect of lowering the prestige of the Vice Presidency, as the office was no longer for the leading challenger for the Presidency. The separate ballots for President and Vice President became something of a moot issue later in the 19th century when it became the norm for popular elections to determine a state's Electoral College delegation. Electors chosen this way are pledged to vote for a particular presidential and vice presidential candidate (offered by the same political party). So, while the Constitution says that the President and Vice President are chosen separately, in practice they are chosen together.

The 12th Amendment also established rules when no candidate wins a majority vote in the Electoral College. In the [[United States presidential election, 1824|presidential election of 1824]], [[Andrew Jackson]] received a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]], but not a majority, of electoral votes cast. The election was thrown to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and [[John Quincy Adams]] was elected to the presidency. A deep rivalry resulted between Andrew Jackson and House Speaker [[Henry Clay]], who had also been a candidate in the election.

Since 1824, aside from the occasional "faithless elector", the popular vote determines the winner of a presidential election by determining the electoral vote, as each state or district's popular vote determines its electoral college vote. Although the nationwide popular vote does not directly determine the winner of a presidential election, it does strongly correlate with who is the victor. In 53 of the 58 total elections held so far (about 91 percent), the winner of the national popular vote has also carried the Electoral College vote. The winners of the nationwide popular vote and the Electoral College vote differ only in close elections. In highly competitive elections, candidates focus on turning out their vote in the contested swing states critical to winning an electoral college majority, so they do not try to maximize their popular vote by real or fraudulent vote increases in one-party areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282575990_The_Ten_Most_Competitive_American_Presidential_Elections |title=The Ten Most Competitive American Presidential Elections |first=Douglas Dana |last=Rose |work=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, candidates can fail to get the most votes in the nationwide popular vote in a Presidential election and still win that election. In the 1824 election, Jackson won the popular vote, but no one received the majority of electoral votes. According to the 12th Amendment in the Constitution, the House of Representatives must choose the president out of the top three people in the election. Clay had come fourth, so he threw his support to Adams, who then won. Because Adams later named Clay his Secretary of State, Jackson's supporters claimed that Adams gained the presidency by making a deal with Clay. Charges of a "corrupt bargain" followed Adams through his term.

[[File:US Presidential elections popular votes since 1900.png|thumb|Comparison of the popular vote totals since 1900.
{{legend|red|Republican}}{{legend|blue|Democrat}}{{legend|grey|All other candidates together}}]]
Then in [[United States presidential election, 1876|1876]], [[United States presidential election, 1888|1888]], [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]], and [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016]], the winner of electoral vote lost the popular vote outright. Numerous [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|constitutional amendments]] have been submitted seeking to replace the Electoral College with a direct popular vote, but none has ever successfully passed both Houses of Congress. Another alternate proposal is the [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]], an [[United States interstate compact|interstate compact]] whereby individual participating states agree to allocate their electors based on the winner of the national popular vote instead of just their respective statewide results.

The presidential election day was established on a Tuesday in the month of November because of the factors involved (weather, harvests and worship). When voters used to travel to the polls by horse, Tuesday was an ideal day because it allowed people to worship on Sunday, ride to their [[county seat]] on Monday, and vote on Tuesday—all before market day, Wednesday. The month of November also fits nicely between harvest time and harsh winter weather, which could be especially bad to people traveling by [[horse and buggy]].&lt;ref name="election history facts CNN"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yan|first=Holly|title=Why Tuesday, why November, why elephants? Election riddles solved|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/06/politics/fun-election-facts/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=9 November 2012|date=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1937, presidents were not sworn in until March 4 because it took so long to count and report ballots, and because of the winner's logistical issues of moving to the capital. With better technology and the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|20th Amendment]] being passed, presidential inaugurations were moved to noon on January 20—allowing presidents to start their duties sooner.&lt;ref name="election history facts CNN"/&gt;

The [[Federal Election Campaign Act|Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971]] was enacted to increase disclosure of [[Campaign finance in the United States|contributions for federal campaigns]]. Subsequent amendments to law require that candidates to a federal office must file a Statement of Candidacy with the [[Federal Election Commission]] before they can receive contributions aggregating in excess of $5,000 or make expenditures aggregating in excess of $5,000. Thus, this began a trend of presidential candidates declaring their intentions to run as early as the Spring of the previous calendar year so they can start raising and spending the money needed for their nationwide campaign.&lt;ref name="WAPOST20150403"/&gt;

The first president, [[George Washington]], was elected as an independent. Since the election of his successor, [[John Adams]], in [[United States presidential election, 1796|1796]], all winners of U.S. presidential elections have represented one of two major parties. [[Third party (United States)|Third parties]] have taken second place only twice, in [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860]] and [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912]]. The last time a third (independent) candidate achieved significant success (although still finishing in third place) was in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]], and the last time a third-party candidate received any electoral votes not from [[faithless elector]]s was in [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]].

==Procedure==
===Eligibility requirements===
[[File:NaturalBornCitizenClause.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The hand-written copy of the [[natural-born-citizen clause]] as it appeared in 1787]]

[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Qualifications for office|Article Two]] of the [[United States Constitution]] stipulates that for a person to serve as President, the individual must be a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizen of the United States]], at least 35 years old, and a resident of the United States for a period of no less than 14 years. A candidate may start running his or her campaign early before turning 35 years old or completing 14 years of residency, but must meet the age and residency requirements by [[Inauguration Day]]. The [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the Constitution also sets a [[term limit]]: a President cannot be elected to more than two terms.

The U.S. Constitution also has two provisions that apply to all federal offices in general, not just the presidency. [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 7: Judgment in cases of impeachment; Punishment on conviction|Article I, Section 3, Clause 7]] states that if the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] convicts any officer on impeachment, they may also bar that person from holding any public office in the future. And [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Participants in rebellion|Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment]] prohibits the election to any federal office of any person who had held any federal or state office and then engaged in insurrection, rebellion or treason; this disqualification can be waived if such an individual gains the consent of two-thirds of both houses of Congress.

In addition, the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] establishes that the Vice-President must meet all of the qualifications of being a President.

Although not a mandatory requirement, Federal campaign finance laws including the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]] state that a candidate who intends to receive contributions aggregating in excess of $5,000 or make expenditures aggregating in excess of $5,000, among others, must first file a Statement of Candidacy with the [[Federal Election Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.fec.gov/press/resources/2016presidential_form2nm.shtml | title=2016 Presidential Form 2 Filers | publisher=Federal Election Commission | accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led presidential candidates, especially members from the two major political parties, to officially announce their intentions to run as early as the spring of the previous calendar year so they can start raising or spending the money needed for their nationwide campaign.&lt;ref name="WAPOST20150403"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/04/03/why-hillary-clinton-might-have-just-two-more-weeks-or-so-to-announce-shes-running-for-president/ | title=Why Hillary Clinton might have just two more weeks or so to announce she's running for president | author=Jose A. DelReal | work=Washington Post | date=April 3, 2015 | accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential candidates usually form [[exploratory committee]]s even earlier to determining the feasibility of them actually running.

===Nominating process===
{{main|United States presidential primary|United States presidential nominating convention}}
[[File:Iowa City Caucus.jpg|thumb|A 2008 Democratic caucus meeting in [[Iowa City, Iowa]]. The [[Iowa caucuses]] are traditionally the first major electoral event of presidential primaries and caucuses.]]
[[File:Madison Square Garden, February 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]], the site of the 1976, 1980, and 1992 Democratic National Conventions; and the 2004 Republican National Convention.]]
[[File:RNC-interior-Palin-20080903.jpg|thumb|The floor of the [[2008 Republican National Convention]] at the [[Xcel Energy Center]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]].]]

The modern nominating process of U.S. presidential elections consists of two major parts: a series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] held in each state, and the [[United States presidential nominating convention|presidential nominating conventions]] held by each [[political party]]. This process was never included in the [[United States Constitution]], and thus evolved over time by the political parties to clear the field of candidates.

The [[primary election]]s are run by state and local governments, while the [[caucus]]es are organized directly by the political parties. Some states hold only primary elections, some hold only caucuses, and others use a combination of both. These primaries and caucuses are staggered generally between January and June before the federal election, with [[Iowa]] and [[New Hampshire]] traditionally holding the first presidential state caucus and primary, respectively.

Like the general election, presidential caucuses or primaries are indirect elections. The major political parties officially vote for their presidential candidate at their respective nominating conventions, usually all held in the summer before the federal election. Depending on each state's law and state's political party rules, when voters cast ballots for a candidate in a presidential caucus or primary, they may be voting to award delegates "bound" to vote for a candidate at the presidential nominating conventions, or they may simply be expressing an opinion that the state party is not bound to follow in selecting delegates to their respective national convention.

Unlike the general election, voters in the [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] can also elect delegates to the national conventions. Furthermore, each political party can determine how many delegates to allocate to each state and territory. In 2012 for example, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] party conventions each used two different formulas to allocate delegates. The Democrats-based theirs on two main factors: the proportion of votes each state gave to the Democratic candidate in the previous three presidential elections, and the number of electoral votes each state had in the Electoral College.&lt;ref name="greenpapersDEMDelegates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P12/D-Alloc.phtml|title=Democratic Detailed Delegate Allocation – 2012|work=The Green Papers|accessdate=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the Republicans assigned to each state 10 delegates, plus 3 delegates per congressional district.&lt;ref name="greenpapersGOPDelegates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P12/R-Alloc.phtml|title=Republican Detailed Delegate Allocation – 2012|work=The Green Papers|accessdate=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both parties then gave fixed amounts of delegates to each territory, and finally bonus delegates to states and territories that passed certain criteria.&lt;ref name="greenpapersDEMDelegates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="greenpapersGOPDelegates"/&gt;

Along with delegates chosen during primaries and caucuses, state and U.S. territory delegations to both the Democratic and Republican party conventions also include "unpledged" delegates that have a vote. For Republicans, they consist of the three top party officials from each state and territory. Democrats have a more expansive group of unpledged delegates called "[[superdelegate]]s", who are party leaders and elected officials.

Each party's presidential candidate also chooses a vice presidential nominee to run with him or her on the same [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], and this choice is rubber-stamped by the convention.

If no single candidate has secured a majority of delegates (including both pledged and unpledged), then a "[[brokered convention]]" results. All pledged delegates are then "released" and are able to switch their allegiance to a different candidate. Thereafter, the nomination is decided through a process of alternating political [[horse trading]], and additional rounds of re-votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Katie |last=Paul |work=Newsweek |date=2008-02-07 |title=Convention Wisdom |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/109264 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Convention Q &amp; A |last=Eun Kyung Kim |work=Gannett News Service |publisher=Detroit Free Press |date=2008-02-10 |url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080210/NEWS15/802100609/1009/NEWS07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/108729 |title=A Ticking Clock |first=Eleanor |last=Clift |date=2008-02-06 |work=Newsweek }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.courierpostonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080209/NEWS01/80209008/0/towns63 |title=Post-primary questions answered |date=2008-02-09 |first=Jeffrey |last=Gold |work=Associated Press |publisher=Courier-Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conventions have historically been held inside [[convention center]]s, but since the late 20th century both the Democratic and Republican parties have favored [[sports arena]]s and domed stadiums to accommodate the increasing attendance.

===The popular vote on Election Day===
[[File:Larsz - US election 08 (by-sa).jpg|left|thumb|A Texas voter about to mark a selection for president on a ballot, 2008 Election Day]]

Under the United States Constitution, the manner of choosing electors for the Electoral College is determined by each state's legislature.  Although each state designates electors by popular vote, other methods are allowed.  For instance, instead of having a popular vote, a number of states used to select presidential electors by a direct vote of the state legislature itself.

However, federal law does specify that all electors must be selected on the same day, which is "the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November," i.e., a Tuesday no earlier than November 2 and no later than November 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sandy unlikely to postpone election|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2012/10/30/sandy-obama-romney-election/1668501/|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, the states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] each conduct their own popular elections on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] to help determine their respective slate of electors. Thus, the presidential election is really an amalgamation of separate and simultaneous state elections instead of a single national election run by the federal government.

Like any other election in the United States, the eligibility of an individual for voting is set out in the Constitution and regulated at state level. The Constitution states that [[suffrage]] cannot be denied on grounds of [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|race or color]], [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|sex]] or [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|age for citizens eighteen years or older]]. Beyond these basic qualifications, it is the responsibility of state legislatures to regulate voter eligibility.

Generally, voters are required to vote on a ballot where they select the candidate of their choice. The presidential ballot is a vote "for the electors of a candidate" meaning that the voter is not voting for the candidate, but endorsing a slate of electors pledged to vote for a specific presidential and vice presidential candidate.

Many voting ballots allow a voter to "blanket vote" for all candidates in a particular [[List of political parties in the United States|political party]] or to select individual candidates on a line by line voting system. Which candidates appear on the voting ticket is determined through a legal process known as [[ballot access]]. Usually, the size of the candidate's political party and the results of the major nomination conventions determine who is pre-listed on the presidential ballot. Thus, the presidential election ticket will not list every candidate running for President, but only those who have secured a major party nomination or whose size of their political party warrants having been formally listed. Laws are in effect to have other candidates pre-listed on a ticket, provided that enough voters have endorsed the candidate, usually through a signature list.

The final way to be elected for president is to have one's name written in at the time of election as a [[write-in candidate]]. This is used for candidates who did not fulfill the legal requirements to be pre-listed on the voting ticket. It is also used by voters to express a distaste for the listed candidates, by writing in an alternative candidate for president such as [[Mickey Mouse]] or comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] (whose application was voted down by the South Carolina Democratic Party). In any event, a write-in candidate has never won an election for President of the United States.

Because [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] are not represented in the Electoral College, U.S. citizens in those areas do not vote in the general election for President. [[Guam]] has held [[straw poll]]s for president since the 1980 election to draw attention to this fact.&lt;ref name="guammove"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ballot-access.org/2008/07/10/guam-legislature-moves-general-election-presidential-vote-to-the-september-primary/ |title=Guam Legislature Moves General Election Presidential Vote to the September Primary |publisher=Ballot-Access.org |date=2008-07-10 |accessdate=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electoral college===
{{main|Electoral College (United States)}}
[[File:ElectoralCollege2016.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|right|Electoral College map showing the results of the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential election]]. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Donald Trump]] won the popular vote in 30 states (denoted in red) to capture 305 electoral votes (plus 1 electoral vote from Maine's second congressional district). [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Hillary Clinton]] won the popular vote in 20 states and [[Washington, D.C.]] (denoted in blue) to capture 232 electoral votes.]]

Most state laws establish a winner-take-all system, wherein the ticket that wins a [[plurality voting system|plurality]] of votes wins all of that state's allocated electoral votes, and thus has their slate of electors chosen to vote in the Electoral College. [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] do not use this method,  instead giving two electoral votes to the statewide winner and one electoral vote to the winner of each Congressional district.

Each state's winning slate of electors then meets at their respective state's capital on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December to cast their electoral votes on separate ballots for President and Vice President. Although Electoral College members can technically vote for anyone under the U.S. Constitution, 24 states have laws to punish [[faithless elector]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairvote.org/e_college/faithless.htm|title=Faithless Electors|work=FairVote}}&lt;/ref&gt; those who do not cast their electoral votes for the person whom they have pledged to elect.

In early January, the total Electoral College vote count is opened by the sitting Vice President, acting in his capacity as [[President of the Senate#United States|President of the Senate]], and read aloud to a [[joint session of the United States Congress|joint session]] of the incoming Congress, which was elected at the same time as the President.

If no candidate receives a majority of the electoral vote (at least 270), the President is determined by the rules outlined by the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]]. Specifically, the selection of President would then be decided by a [[contingent election]] in a ballot of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. For the purposes of electing the President, each state has only one vote. A ballot of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] is held to choose the Vice President. In this ballot, each senator has one vote.  The House of Representatives has chosen the victor of the presidential race only twice, in [[United States presidential election, 1800|1800]] and [[United States presidential election, 1824|1824]]; the Senate has chosen the victor of the vice-presidential race only once, in [[United States presidential election, 1836|1836]].

If the President is not chosen by Inauguration Day, the Vice President-elect acts as President. If neither are chosen by then, Congress by law determines who shall act as President, pursuant to the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|20th Amendment]].

Unless there are faithless electors, disputes, or other controversies, the events in December and January mentioned above are largely a formality since the winner can be determined based on the state-by-state popular vote results. Between the general election and Inauguration Day, this apparent winner is referred to as the "[[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]]" (unless it is a sitting President that has won re-election).

===Election calendar===

The typical periods of the presidential election process are as follows, with the dates corresponding to the 2016 general election:
* Spring 2015 – Candidates announce their intentions to run, and (if necessary) file their Statement of Candidacy with the [[Federal Election Commission]]
* August 2015 to March 2016 – Primary and caucus debates
* February 1 to June 14, 2016 – Primaries and caucuses
* April&lt;!--Constitution Party is scheduled for April--&gt; to August, 2016 – Nominating conventions (including those of the minor third parties)
* September and October, 2016 – [[United States presidential election debates|Presidential election debates]]
* November 8, 2016 – [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]]
* December 19, 2016 – Electors cast their electoral votes
* January 6, 2017 – Congress counts and certifies the electoral votes
* January 20, 2017 – [[United States presidential inauguration|Inauguration Day]]

[[File:John Adams crop.jpg|thumb|[[John Adams]] was the first of 26 presidents who have been lawyers.]]
Among the 44 persons who have served as president, only [[Donald Trump]] had never held a position in either government or the military prior to taking office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2017/04/23/525111191/trump-s-first-100-days-an-entry-level-presidency | title=Trump's First 100 Days: An 'Entry-Level' Presidency | publisher=NPR | first=Domenico | last=Montanaro | date=April 23, 2017 | accessdate=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only previous experience that [[Zachary Taylor]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] had was in the military. [[Herbert Hoover]] previously served as the [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]].  Everyone else served in elected public office before becoming president, such as being Vice President, a member of the [[United States Congress]], or a state or territorial [[governor]].

Fourteen Presidents also served as vice president. However, only [[John Adams]] ([[United States presidential election, 1796|1796]]), [[Thomas Jefferson]] ([[United States presidential election, 1800|1800]]), [[Martin Van Buren]] ([[United States presidential election, 1836|1836]]), [[Richard Nixon]] ([[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]]) and [[George H. W. Bush]] ([[United States presidential election, 1988|1988]]) began their first term after winning an election. The remaining nine began their first term as president according to the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]] after the intra-term death or resignation of their predecessor. Of these, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Calvin Coolidge]], [[Harry S. Truman]], and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] were subsequently elected to a full term of their own, while [[John Tyler]], [[Millard Fillmore]], [[Andrew Johnson]], [[Chester A. Arthur]], and [[Gerald Ford]] were not. Ford's accession to the presidency is unique in American history in that he became vice president through the process prescribed by the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]] rather than by winning an election, thus making him the only U.S. president to not have been elected to either office.

Sixteen presidents had previously served in the U.S. Senate, including four of the five who served between 1945 and 1974. However, only three were incumbent senators at the time they were elected president ([[Warren G. Harding]] in [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920]], [[John F. Kennedy]] in [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]], and [[Barack Obama]] in [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]]). Eighteen presidents had earlier served in the House of Representatives. However, only one was a sitting representative when elected to presidency ([[James A. Garfield]] in [[United States presidential election, 1880|1880]]).

Four of the last seven presidents ([[Jimmy Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Bill Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush]]) have been governors of a state. Geographically, these presidents were from either very large states (Reagan from [[California]], Bush from [[Texas]]) or from a state south of the [[Mason–Dixon line]] and east of Texas (Carter from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Clinton from [[Arkansas]]). In all, sixteen presidents have been former governors, including seven who were incumbent governors at the time of their election to the presidency.

The most common job experience, occupation or profession of U.S. presidents has been lawyer;&lt;ref&gt;International Law, US Power: The United States' Quest for Legal Security, p. 10, Shirley V. Scott  (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; 26 presidents had served as attorneys. Twenty-two presidents were also in the military. Eight presidents had served as Cabinet Secretaries, with five of the six Presidents who served between 1801 and 1841 having held the office of [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]].

After leaving office, one president, [[William Howard Taft]], served as [[Chief Justice of the United States]]. Two others later served in Congress{{snd}}[[John Quincy Adams]], who served in the House, and [[Andrew Johnson]], who served in the Senate.

===Technology and media===
{{see also|Social media in the United States presidential election, 2016}}
[[File:Commercial-LBJ1964ElectionAdDaisyGirl.ogv|thumb|upright=1.15|thumbtime=3|Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 "Daisy" advertisement]]

Advances in technology and media have also affected presidential campaigns. The invention of both radio and television have given way to the reliance of national political advertisements across those methods of communication. National advertisements such as [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s 1964 commercial "[[Daisy (advertisement)|Daisy]]", [[Ronald Reagan]]'s 1984 commercial "[[Morning in America]]", and [[George H. W. Bush]]'s 1988 commercial "[[Revolving Door (advertisement)|Revolving Door]]" became major factors in those respective elections. In 1992, George H. W. Bush's promise of "[[Read my lips: no new taxes]]" was extensively used in the commercials of [[Bill Clinton]] and Bush's other opponents with significant effect during the campaign.

Since the development of the internet in the mid-90s, [[Internet activism]] has also become an invaluable component of presidential campaigns, especially since 2000.  The internet was first used in the 1996 presidential elections, but primarily as a brochure for the candidate online.&lt;ref name="Pollard, Chesebro &amp; Studinski 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollard|first1=Timothy D.|last2=Chesebro|first2=James W.|last3=Studinski|first3=David Paul|title=The Role of the Internet in Presidential Campaigns|journal=Communications Studies|year=2009|volume=60|issue=5|pages=574–88|doi=10.1080/10510970903260418}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only used by a few candidates and there is no evidence of any major effect on the outcomes of that election cycle.&lt;ref name="Pollard, Chesebro &amp; Studinski 2009"/&gt;

In 2000, both candidates ([[George W. Bush]] and [[Al Gore]]) created, maintained and updated their campaign website.  But it was not until the 2004 presidential election cycle was the potential value of the internet seen.  By the summer of 2003, ten people competing in the 2004 presidential election had developed campaign websites.&lt;ref name=Endres&gt;{{cite journal|last=Endres, Warnick|title=Text-based Interactivity in Candidate Campaign Web Sites: A case Study from the 2002 Elections|journal=Western Journal of Communication|year=2004|volume=68|issue=3|pages=322–42|doi=10.1080/10570310409374804}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Howard Dean presidential campaign, 2004|Howard Dean's]] campaign website from that year was considered a model for all future campaign websites. His website played a significant role in his overall campaign strategy.&lt;ref name=Endres/&gt;  It allowed his supporters to read about his campaign platform and provide feedback, donate, get involved with the campaign, and connect with other supporters.&lt;ref name="Pollard, Chesebro &amp; Studinski 2009"/&gt;  A [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll from January 2004 revealed that 49 percent of Americans have used the internet to get information about candidates, and 28 percent said that they use the internet to get this information frequently.&lt;ref name="Pollard, Chesebro &amp; Studinski 2009"/&gt;

In 2008, the internet became a [[grassroots]] and a voice of the people tool—a way for the users to connect with each other and with the campaign, like Dean's website had done in 2004. All of the major candidates had a website and utilized [[social networking]] like [[Facebook]] and [[MySpace]].  The popularity of a candidate could be measured by the number of "friends" on these sites as well as on websites like Hitwise, which listed the number of hits all of the presidential candidate's websites had each week.

Internet channels such as [[YouTube]] were used by candidates to share speeches and ads for free.  This also served as a forum for users to attack other candidates by uploading videos of gaffes.&lt;ref name="Pollard, Chesebro &amp; Studinski 2009"/&gt;

A study done by the [[Pew]] Internet &amp; American Life Project in conjunction with Princeton Survey Research Associates in November 2010 shows that 54 percent of adults in the [[United States]] used the internet to get information about the [[2010 midterm elections]] and about specific candidates.  This represents 73 percent of adult internet users.  The study also showed that 22 percent of adult internet users used [[Social networking websites|social network]] sites or [[Twitter]] to get information about and discuss the elections and 26 percent of all adults used cell phones to learn about or participate in campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Aaron|title=Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2011/The-Internet-and-Campaign-2010.aspx|work=The Internet and Campaign 2010|publisher=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

E-campaigning as it has come to be called, is subject to very little regulation.  On March 26, 2006, the [[Federal Election Commission]] voted unanimously to "not regulate political communication on the Internet, including emails, blogs and the creating of Web sites"&lt;ref name="Bimbaum"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bimbaum|first=Jeffrey|title=Loophole a Spigot for E-Mail; Critics Fear Voters Will Be Deluged as Fall Elections Near|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This decision made only paid political ads placed on websites subject to campaign finance limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trent &amp; Friedenberg|title=Political Campaign Communication Principles &amp; Practices|year=2008|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|location=Lanham, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A comment was made about this decision by Roger Alan Stone of Advocacy Inc. which explains this loophole in the context of a political campaign: "A wealthy individual could purchase all of the [[e-mail]] addresses for registered [[voters]] in a [[congressional district]]…produce an Internet video ad, and [[e-mail]] it along with a link to the campaign contribution page…Not only would this activity not count against any contribution limits or independent expenditure requirements; it would never even need to be reported."&lt;ref name="Bimbaum"/&gt;

The presidential election process is controversial, with critics arguing that it is inherently undemocratic, and discourages voter participation and turnout in many areas of the country. Because of the staggered nature of the primary season, voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and other small states which traditionally hold their primaries and caucuses first in January usually have a major impact on the races. Campaign activity, media attention, and voter participation are usually higher in these states, as the candidates attempt to build momentum and generate a [[bandwagon effect]] in these early primaries. Conversely, voters in California and other large states which traditionally hold their primaries last in June usually end up having no say in who the presidential candidates will be. The races are usually over by then, and thus the campaigns, the media, and voters have little incentive to participate in these late primaries. As a result, more states vie for earlier primaries to claim a greater influence in the process. However, compressing the primary calendar in this way limits the ability of lesser-known candidates to effectively corral resources and raise their visibility among voters, especially when competing with better-known candidates who have more financial resources and the institutional backing of their party's establishment. Primary and caucus reform proposals include a [[National Primary]] held on a single day; or the [[Interregional Primary Plan]], where states would be grouped into six regions, and each of the regions would rotate every election on who would hold their primaries first.

With the primary races usually over before June, the political conventions have mostly become scripted, ceremonial affairs. As the drama has left the conventions, and complaints grown that they were scripted and dull pep rallies, public interest and viewership has fallen off. After having offered gavel-to-gavel coverage of the major party conventions in the mid-20th century, the [[Big Three television networks]] now only devote approximately three hours of coverage (one hour per night).

Critics also argue that the Electoral College is archaic and inherently undemocratic. With all states, except Maine and Nebraska, using a winner-take-all system, both the Democratic and the Republican candidates are almost certain to win all the electoral votes from those states whose residents predominantly vote for the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, respectively. This encourages presidential candidates to focus exponentially more time, money, and energy campaigning in a few so-called "[[swing states]]", states in which no single candidate or party has overwhelming support. Such swing states like Ohio are inundated with campaign visits, saturation television advertising, get-out-the-vote efforts by party organizers, and debates. Meanwhile, candidates and political parties have no incentive to mount nationwide campaign efforts, or work to increase voter turnout, in predominately Democratic Party "safe states" like California or predominately Republican Party "safe states" like Texas. In practice, the winner-take-all system also both reinforces the country's [[two-party system]] and decreases the importance of [[Third party (United States)|third and minor political parties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/4312|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109153753/http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/4312|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 9, 2009|title=Third Parties?|author=Jerry Fresia|date=February 28, 2006|publisher=Zmag.org|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a candidate can win the electoral vote without securing the greatest amount of the national popular vote, such as during the [[United States presidential election, 1824|1824]], [[United States presidential election, 1876|1876]], [[United States presidential election, 1888|1888]], [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] and [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016]] elections. In theory, it is possible to secure the necessary 270 electoral votes from only the eleven most populous states and then ignore the rest of the country.

=== Proposed changes to the election process ===
In 1844, Representative [[Samuel Finley Vinton|Samuel F. Vinton]] of Ohio proposed an amendment to the constitution that would replace the electoral college system with a lot system.  The Joint Resolution called for each state to elect, by a simple majority, a presidential candidate of said state.  Each state would notify Congress of the presidential election results.  Congress would then inscribe the name of every state on uniform balls, equal to the number of said state's members of Congress, and deposit into a box.  In a joint session of Congress, a ball would be drawn, and the elected candidate of the state of which is written on the drawn ball would be named President.  A second ball would immediately be drawn after, and that state's candidate would be named Vice-President.  The resolution did not pass the House.  Representative Vinton proposed an identical amendment in 1846.  Again, it was unsuccessful.  The driving force behind the introduction of the resolution is unclear, as there is no recorded debate for either proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.archives.gov/id/24200386|title=House Joint Resolution (H.J. Res.) 8 Proposing a Constitutional Amendment to Elect the President by Lot|last=|first=|date=|website=National Archives Catalog|publisher=Center for Legislative Archives, National Archives and Records Administration.|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other constitutional amendments, such as the [[Every Vote Counts Amendment]], have been proposed seeking to replace the Electoral College with a direct popular vote, which proponents argue would increase turnout and participation. Other proposed reforms include the [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]], an [[United States interstate compact|interstate compact]] without Congressional authorization, whereby individual participating states agree to allocate their electors based on the winner of the national popular vote, instead of voting their respective statewide results. Another proposal is for every state to simply adopt the District system used by Maine and Nebraska: give two electoral votes to the statewide winner and one electoral vote to the winner of each Congressional district. The Automatic Plan would replace the Electors with an automatic tallying of votes to eliminate the faithless elector affecting the outcome of the election. The Proportional Plan, often compared to the District Plan, would distribute electoral votes in each state in proportion to the popular vote, introducing third party effects in election outcomes. The House Plan would require a constitutional amendment to allocate electors based on the House apportionment alone to lessen small state advantage. Direct election plans and bonus plans have in common a higher valuation on the popular vote for president.&lt;ref&gt;Melcher, James P., "[https://www.academia.edu/1536978/Electing_to_Reform_Maine_and_the_District_Plan_for_Selection_of_Presidential_Electors Electing to Reform: Maine and the District Plan for Selection of Presidential Electors]", 2004, New England Political Science Association. viewed October 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voter turnout==
{{see also|Voter turnout in the United States presidential elections}}

[[Voter turnout]] in the 2004 and 2008 elections showed a noticeable increase over the turnout in 1996 and 2000. Prior to 2004, voter turnout in presidential elections had been decreasing while voter registration, measured in terms of voting age population (VAP) by the U.S. Census, has been increasing. The VAP figure, however, includes persons ineligible to vote – mainly non-citizens and ineligible felons – and excludes overseas eligible voters. Opinion is mixed on whether this decline was due to voter apathy.&lt;ref name="census.gov"&gt;[https://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/voting/013995.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pages/htmlto5.htm|title=National Voter Turnout in Federal Elections: 1960–1996|publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]]|date=2003-07-29|accessdate=2007-12-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209105156/http://www.fec.gov/pages/htmlto5.htm|archivedate=2007-12-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/index.html |title=Election Information: Election Statistics |publisher=[[Office of the Clerk]] |accessdate=2007-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070725184700/http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/index.html |archivedate=July 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/voting.html|publisher=[[U.S. Census Bureau]]|title=Voting and Registration Date|accessdate=2007-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; or an increase in ineligible voters on the rolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elections.gmu.edu/FAQ.html |title=Voter Turnout Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Elections.gmu.edu |date=March 12, 2009 |accessdate=January 24, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122155234/http://elections.gmu.edu/FAQ.html |archive-date=2009-01-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The difference between these two measures are illustrated by analysis of turnout in the 2004 and 2008 elections. Voter turnout from the 2004 and 2008 election was "not statistically different," based on the voting age population used by a November 2008 U.S. Census survey of 50,000 households.&lt;ref name="census.gov"/&gt; If expressed in terms of vote eligible population (VEP), the 2008 national turnout rate was 61.7% from 131.3 million ballots cast for president, an increase of over 1.6 percentage points over the 60.1% turnout rate of 2004, and the highest since 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elections.gmu.edu/preliminary_vote_2008.html |title=2008 Preliminary Voter Turnout |publisher=Elections.gmu.edu |date=March 12, 2009 |accessdate=January 24, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113104435/http://elections.gmu.edu/preliminary_vote_2008.html |archivedate=November 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial disclosures==

Prior to 1967, many presidential candidates disclosed assets, stock holdings, and other information which might affect the public trust.&lt;ref name=Joseph&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6hNdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MVoNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1118,3648005&amp;dq=george-romney+and+tax-returns&amp;hl=en Income Tax Returns Released for Last 12 Years by Romney], ''St. Joseph Gazette'', United Press International, November 27, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;  In that year, Republican candidate [[George W. Romney]] went a step further and released his tax returns for the previous twelve years.&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt; Since then, many presidential candidates – including all major-party nominees from 1980 to 2012 – have released some of their returns,&lt;ref name="Vanity"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/08/investigating-mitt-romney-offshore-accounts | title=Where the Money Lives | first=Nicholas | last=Shaxson | magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although few of the major party nominees have equaled or exceeded George Romney's twelve.&lt;ref name="polifact"&gt;Sherman, Amy (August 19, 2012), [http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/08/18/2958158/debbie-wasserman-schultz-claim.html Debbie Wasserman Schultz' claim about release of tax returns of major candidates is false, says PolitiFact Florida] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223044337/http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/08/18/2958158/debbie-wasserman-schultz-claim.html |date=2013-02-23 }}, ''Miami Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Farley, [http://factcheck.org/2012/07/romney-and-the-tax-return-precedent/ Romney and the Tax Return Precedent], [[FactCheck.org]], [[Annenberg Public Policy Center]], July 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tax History Project – a project directed by [[Joseph J.

In 2016, Republican presidential nominee [[Donald Trump]] broke with tradition, becoming the only major-party candidate since [[Gerald Ford]] in 1976 to not make any of his full tax returns public.&lt;ref name=release&gt;Alan Rappeport, [https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/05/11/donald-trump-breaks-with-recent-history-by-not-releasing-tax-returns/?_r=0 Donald Trump Breaks With Recent History by Not Releasing Tax Returns], ''New York Times'' (May 11, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016#Refusal to release tax returns|Trump gave as a reason]] that he was [[Income tax audit|being audited]] by the [[IRS]].&lt;ref name=release /&gt; However, no law or precedent prevents a person from releasing their tax returns while under audit, and in fact President [[Richard M. Nixon]] released his tax returns while being audited.&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne Sahadi, [http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/11/pf/taxes/nixon-trump-tax-returns/ Nixon released his tax returns under audit. Why can't Trump?], CNN Money (May 11, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sean Gorman, [http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2016/oct/05/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-correctly-notes-richard-nixon-released-t/ Tim Kaine correctly notes Richard Nixon released tax returns despite audit], ''PolitiFact'' (October 5, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidential coattails==
{{main|Coattail effect}}

Presidential elections are held on the same date as those for all the seats in the [[United States House of Representatives]], the full terms for 33 or 34 of the 100 seats in the [[United States Senate]], the [[Governor (United States)|governorships]] in several [[U.S. state]]s, and many state and local elections. Presidential candidates tend to bring out supporters who then vote for their party's candidates for those other offices.&lt;ref&gt;"Government By the People; national, state, and local version" Prentice Hall publishers, by Cronin Magleby O'Brien Light&lt;/ref&gt; These other candidates are said to ride on the presidential candidates' coattails. Voter turnout is also generally higher during presidential election years than either [[United States midterm election|midterm election]] years&lt;ref&gt;Desilver, D. (2014) [http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/24/voter-turnout-always-drops-off-for-midterm-elections-but-why/ Voter turnout always drops off for midterm elections, but why?] Pew Research Center, July 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[off-year election|odd-numbered election]] years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Voter Turnout | url=http://www.fairvote.org/voter-turnout | publisher=[[FairVote]] | accessdate=2001-04-08 | quote=Low turnout is most pronounced in off-year elections for state legislators and local officials as well as primaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;
