'''Muhammad Ahmad Abbud Pasha''' ({{Lang-ar|محمد أحمد عبود باشا}}) (1899–1963) was an [[Egypt]]ian [[entrepreneur]] and [[business magnate]].

Abbud established a construction firm in the early 1920s, which went on to become the most successful business group in Egypt of that era. By the 1940s, he owned the Sugar Company, the Khedival Mail Line as well as the Egyptian General Omnibus Company. In addition, he was the largest shareholder of [[Banque Misr]], and obtained a seat on its board of directors in 1950. In the same year, he became the first Egyptian director of the [[Suez Canal Company]], which was then owned by foreigners.

Abbud received the noble title of ''[[Pasha]]'' on 14 February 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Pashas 1915–52 |url=http://www.egy.com/historica/pashalst.htm |publisher=Egy.com |accessdate=2009-04-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505083109/http://www.egy.com/historica/pashalst.htm |archivedate=5 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; He was also active in politics. He became a parliamentary deputy in 1926, representing the [[Wafd Party]] which he supported financially until [[Mustafa el-Nahhas]] became its leader in 1927. Abbud later reconciled with the party and started supporting it once again during its final years in power, and was close to party strongman [[Fuad Siraj al-Din]].

Abbud Pasha died in [[London]] in 1963, and was reported to be among the ten richest men in the world at the time of his death.

'''Alfred Brush Ford''' (born 1950), also known as '''Ambarish&lt;ref name="tac" /&gt; Das''', is an [[United States|American]] heir to the Ford fortune. He is a great-grandson of legendary businessman [[Henry Ford]] - the founder of the [[Ford Motor Company]].&lt;ref name="toi" /&gt;

==Background==
{{See also|Ford family tree}}

Ford is the son of Walter B. Ford II (1920&amp;ndash;1991), whose family were prominent in chemical manufacturing in the Downriver area south of Detroit.

His late mother, Josephine Clay Ford (1923&amp;ndash;2005) was the daughter of [[Edsel Ford]] (1893&amp;ndash;1943), who was the son of Henry Ford (1863&amp;ndash;1947).&lt;ref name="tac"&gt;{{cite news|title=Alfred Ford is Building a Multi-Million Dollar Monument in India|url=http://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/money-and-power/news/a4350/alfred-ford-multi-million-dollar-monument-india/|accessdate=12 September 2016|publisher=Town &amp; Country|date=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus both his father and mother were born with the last name of Ford. Alfred and [[William Clay Ford, Jr.]] (b. 1957), the current executive chairman of the Ford Motor Co., are first cousins. Alfred's mother was the sister of [[William Clay Ford, Sr.]] (1925&amp;ndash;2014; William Ford, Jr.'s father).

He currently serves on the board of directors of privately held digital marketing firm [[ChannelNet]], where he is also an investor. Ford Motor Company was one of ChannelNet's early clients.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Association with the Hare Krishna Movement==
{{Vaishnavism}}
He is an initiated disciple of [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] (Srila Prabhupada) since 1974. He first met Bhaktivedanta Swami in [[Dallas]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|UIIygo5-qeU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred Ford joined the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (the ''[[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]]'') in 1975 and that same year he made his first trip to [[India]] with Prabhupada. He assisted in the establishment of the first Hindu temple in [[Hawaii]] and also donated $500,000 to help establish the [[Bhaktivedanta Cultural Center]] in [[Detroit]]&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news | title = Article in The New York Times | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E3DA1E39F93AA35752C1A967948260 | accessdate = August 25, 2006 | first1=Albin | last1=Krebs | date=November 9, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was completed in 1983.&lt;ref name="toi" /&gt; Alfred Ford has made many significant donations to ISKCON over the years which have assisted ongoing projects to build the Pushpa Samadhi Mandir of Prabhupada.

[[Image:Alfredo Harp Helu.jpg|thumb|Alfredo Harp Helú]]
'''Alfredo Harp Helú''' (born 1944) is a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] businessman of Lebanese origin, and as of 2011, with a net worth of $1.5  [[1000000000 (number)|billion]], is according to [[Forbes]] the 974th richest person in the world. He is also the cousin of [[Carlos Slim Helu]], who as of 2013 is the second richest person in the world as ranked by Forbes

In 2018, Alfredo Harp Helu ranked #1867 on the ''Forbes'' World's Billionaires list, with wealth listed at US $1.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/list/3/#version:static_header:source&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Mexico City]], Harp is most famous for being the former owner of the biggest [[Latin American]] and Mexican [[bank]], [[Banamex]] (now part of [[Citigroup]]), and was a billion-dollar beneficiary of Citigroup's 2001 [[buyout]] of [[Banamex]]. He is also owner of the [[telecommunication]] company, [[Avantel]], the second largest telephone company in Mexico (now part of [[Axtel]]).

==Personal life==
Harp is married, with several children. He and his family with his second wife divide their time between homes in Mexico City and [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca City]].

He is a baseball fan, owning wholly or partly two professional baseball teams in Mexico, the Diablos Rojos of Mexico City and the [[Guerreros de Oaxaca|Guerreros]] of Oaxaca City.

=== Kidnapping ===
In 1994, Harp's family paid about $30 million after he was held for 106 days by his [[kidnap]]pers in Mexico City. The release followed a dramatic [[television]] appearance in which his son, accompanied by a family [[lawyer]] and a [[priest]], accepted the kidnappers' terms unconditionally. At the family's request, the police did not intervene, giving rise to fears that the huge [[ransom]] would encourage more kidnappings, and adding to concerns about [[Mexico]]'s stability. In 1996, authorities claimed to have recovered nearly $10 million of the Harp ransom.

In 2008, Harp attended the funeral of Fernando Martí, 14-year-old son of the founder of a chain of sporting goods stores, who had been kidnapped and murdered, despite his family's payment of a ransom. He also paid for a full-page advertisement in newspapers calling on the government to put a stop to the rising kidnapping phenomenon in Mexico.

== Philanthropy ==
Harp funds several charitable foundations:
* Fundación Alfredo Harp Helú
* Fundación Alfredo Harp Helú Oaxaca (involved in education, health, culture, and conservation in the state of [[Oaxaca]]).

In the autobiography ''[[Escape from Paradise]]'' by John &amp; May Chu Harding, they also claimed that Aw Cheng Chye's decision to make Haw Par Brothers International public, was against the wish of the part of the Aw family.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|title=Escape from Paradise: From Third World to First|first1=John|last1=Harding|first2=May Chu|last2=Lee|publisher=IDKPress|date=2001|publication-place=Phoenix|ISBN=0-9710929-0-7|via=Google Book preview}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}} May Chu Harding, ''née'' Lee, was the great-granddaughter of Aw Boon Par, or granddaughter of Lee Chee Shan and Aw Cheng Hu.&lt;ref name=book/&gt;{{rp|18}} Lee Chee Shan ({{zh|t=李志成}}) was the president of Chung Khiaw Bank,&lt;ref name=Awfamily/&gt; but retired in July 1971.&lt;ref name=bank/&gt;

The business empire of Haw Par Brothers International and Aw family was completely dismantled after the takeover and the death of Aw Cheng Chye in 1971. After the brother-in-law and sister of Aw Cheng Chye resigned as the directors of Thai subsidiary of Haw Par Brothers International, the Thai subsidiary, which was responsible to make "Tiger Balm" [[liniment]] in Thailand, was sold in 1972. A proposal to acquire the remaining shares of Chung Khiaw Bank by [[United Overseas Bank]], was announced in the same year. At that time due to the ability of director from the related parties being able to vote in such deal, a minority shareholder made a public statement on the newspaper, requesting the government to investigate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/nysp19720623-1.2.58.12|title=祟僑銀行一股東的申訴|date=23 June 1972|access-date=11 October 2017|work=Nanyang Siang Pau|publication-place=Singapore|language=Chinese|via=Singapore National Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce|CIBC]] Mellon''' was founded in 1996 as a [[joint venture]] between the [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]] (hereafter CIBC) and the [[Mellon Financial Corporation]] (now [[The Bank of New York Mellon]]) (hereafter Mellon) to offer asset servicing to institutional investors.  While commonly known as CIBC Mellon, the company comprises two sister companies, '''CIBC Mellon [[Trust company|Trust Company]]''' and '''CIBC Mellon Global Securities Services Company''' (''Compagnie Trust CIBC Mellon'' and ''Société de services de titres mondiaux CIBC Mellon'' in French respectively).  Based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] CIBC Mellon offers asset servicing to corporate and institutional clients.

On 16 February 2010, ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported that BNY Trust Co. of Canada would be acquiring the corporate trust assets of CIBC Mellon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Van Hasselt | first = Caroline | title = Canada's BNY Trust to Buy CIBC Mellon's Corporate Trust Business: Sources | newspaper = Wall Street Journal | date = 16 February 2010 | url = https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20100216-708834.html?mod=WSJ_Deals_LEFTLatestHeadlines | accessdate = 16 February 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

CIBC Mellon was founded in 1996 after CIBC joined with Mellon Financial Corporation in a 50-50 joint venture named CIBC Mellon Global Securities Services (CMGSS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/13/business/international-business-bank-venture-in-canada.html?sec=&amp;spon= New York Times, February 13, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, 1997, CIBC purchased a 50% stake in The R-M Trust Company from Mellon, which would become CMGSS's sister company, CIBC Mellon Trust Company (CMTC).&lt;ref&gt;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, June 4, 1997, pp. C8; Mellon Sells Half of Unit&lt;/ref&gt;  CIBC Mellon acquired the Pension and Institutional Trust businesses from [[Canada Trust]] in 1997&lt;ref&gt;Toronto Star, May 8, 1997, pp. D7; Canada Trust Plans Sale&lt;/ref&gt; and the global custody business from the [[Bank of Montreal]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 18, 1999, pp. F1; Also in Business&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002 CIBC Mellon acquired, from [[Toronto-Dominion Bank|TD Financial Group]], their third party investment fund custody business.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efinancialnews.com/homepage/content/570779/printerfriendly/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific Corporate Trust Company===

In 1998 it seemed that CIBC Mellon would be acquiring the Pacific Corporate Trust Company of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].  That deal eventually fell through, and it was subsequently acquired by [[Computershare|Computershare Limited]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alacrastore.com/storecontent/Thomson_M&amp;A/CIBC_Mellon_Global_Securities_acquires_Pacific_Corporate_Trust_Co-777320040 CIBC Mellon Global Securities acquires Pacific Corporate Trust Co]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133229494.html Computershare Acquires Pacific Corporate Trust Company]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Felcom Data Services acquisition===

On October 8, 2009, CIBC Mellon announced the acquisition of the unitholder recordkeeping and fund administration business of Felcom Data Services Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of [http://www.joviancapital.com Jovian Capital Corporation], for a purchase price of approximately C$4.2 million.  CIBC Mellon indicated that they would offer employment to the majority of employees involved in the business lines acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cibcmellon.com/Contents/en_CA/English/NewsRoom/BulletinsReleases/2009/PR20091008.html# |title=CIBC Mellon Press Release, October 8, 2009 |access-date=2009-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128223115/http://cibcmellon.com/Contents/en_CA/English/NewsRoom/BulletinsReleases/2009/PR20091008.html# |archive-date=2016-01-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sale of issuer services business to Canadian Stock Transfer Company, Inc.===

On November 1, 2010, CIBC Mellon sold its issuer services business (stock transfer and employee share purchase plans) to Canadian Stock Transfer Company, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canstockta.com/CSTPressRelease.pdf Canadian Stock Transfer Company, Inc. Press Release, November 3, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

CIBC Mellon is a 50-50 [[joint venture]] between CIBC and BNY Mellon.  CIBC Mellon operates independently from both of its "owners".

While both CMTC and CMGSS physically occupy the same space, and in essence operate as one company, each has a separate [[board of directors]] which overlap the other.  The executive management team, however, has authority over both companies.

==Securities investigations==

CIBC Mellon has been the subject of two securities investigations.  The first, in 1998, involved the now defunct Pay Pop Inc.  The second, in 2004, involved the disclosure of custodial information to an outside source.

===Pay Pop Inc.===

In 1998, Alnoor Jiwan, a manager in CIBC Mellon's Vancouver office, was approached by Pay Pop Inc. and asked whether CIBC Mellon could issue Pay Pop Inc. shares without the required disclaimer which stated that the securities were not registered with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]].

It was alleged by the SEC, in the subsequent investigation, that Mr Jiwan knew that the securities were not registered, but agreed to act as the transfer agent (in order to issue the stock certificates) in return for 820,000 Pay Pop shares.  The SEC subsequently cited CIBC Mellon for acting as an unregistered broker and transfer agent, and for offering to sell unregistered securities in addition to alleging that the company was uncooperative in the investigation.

Alnoor Jiwan was subsequently terminated for cause from CIBC Mellon, following the company's discovery of the transactions, and simultaneously ceasing all dealings with Pay Pop Inc.&lt;ref&gt;Toronto Star, February 17, 2005, p.D.4&lt;/ref&gt;

CMTC agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of US$5 million and disgorgement of $889,773 and prejudgment interest of $140,270.

CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5.

Payment was made on March 4, 2005. CMTC also consented, without admitting or denying the SEC complaint's allegations, to the entry of an SEC administrative order based on the final judgment on March 2, 2005. Pursuant to the order, CMTC was censured and agreed to an undertaking to engage an independent consultant to review its relevant businesses and procedures.&lt;ref name="TA1"&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1277690/000127769011000002/xslFTAX01/primary_doc.xml TA1 dated January 12, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy breach===

In 2004, a long-term employee of CIBC Mellon was terminated, after it had been discovered that they had been disclosing institutional holdings in certain companies to unidentified parties in return for gifts.  It was reported that the employee had received hockey and baseball tickets as well as up to $100 in cash for tips on big investors who owned specific stocks.

The disclosures were discovered when a temporary worker received a request for data through an email.  The subsequent investigation, which included reviewing phone and email records, discovered that the employee had been disclosing information for years.&lt;ref&gt;Toronto Star, December 9, 2004, p. C.1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related party transactions with Enron===

In 2003, [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce|CIBC]] paid out $80 million in charges for complicity with [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce#Enron|its involvement]] with [[Enron]].  While the involvement was not related to CIBC Mellon, as CIBC is a majority stakeholder, it was required that it be reported on the TA-1 to the SEC.&lt;ref name="TA1" /&gt;

The '''Canadian Public Accountability Board''' ("CPAB") ({{lang-fr|Conseil canadien sur la reddition de comptes}}) is a national body organized by the [[Canadian Securities Administrators]] ("CSA") which oversees Canadian accounting firms performing [[auditing]] work.

==Formation==
The CPAB was formed in 2003, as part of Canada's response to the occurrence of [[accounting scandals]] that were happening worldwide, such as at [[Enron scandal|Enron]] and [[Worldcom]].&lt;ref name="TP"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/piecemeal-system-hampers-watchdog/article547735/ |first=Tara |last=Perkins |title=Piecemeal system hampers watchdog| newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=August 18, 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was different in approach from the ''[[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|107|204|116|745|2002|07|30}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="TP" /&gt; In 2016, its CEO stated that the Board "encourages a more holistic approach to better understand the root causes of lapses in audit quality," in contrast to that taken by the US [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Jeffrey|first= Gundi|date= February 2016|title= Canadian board has concerns over new U.S. rules|url= http://thebottomlinenews.ca/articles/817|newspaper= The Bottom Line|location= Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CSA have specified that a "reporting issuer" (ie, a publicly traded company) must have its financial statements audited by a "participating audit firm," being one that has entered into a participation agreement with the CPAB which has not been terminated.&lt;ref&gt;NI 52-108, s. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Its authority is reinforced through legislation passed at the provincial level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cpab-ccrc.ca/en/About/Legislation/Pages/default.aspx|title= Legislation|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= CPAB}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which [[Ontario]] has passed the most extensive example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  =Canadian Public Accountability Board Act (Ontario)|abbr =S.O.|year =2006|chapter = 33|schedule= D|link= https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/06c33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
164 Canadian and 133 foreign firms have entered into participation agreements with the CPAB. These firms audit approximately 4,000 reporting issuers and 3,000 investment funds.&lt;ref name="Firms"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cpab-ccrc.ca/en/Stakeholder/AuditFirms/Pages/default.aspx|title= Audit Firms|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |publisher= CPAB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these firms, fourteen are inspected annually, of which the [[Big Four (audit firms)|Big Four]] account for 98% of total market capitalization on Canadian markets, and the other 10 large firms account for a further 1.5%.&lt;ref name="Firms"/&gt; The other firms are subject to inspection on a triennial basis.&lt;ref name="Firms"/&gt;

==Governance==
The CPAB has two governing bodies. The Council of Governors consists of six members, who are the [[Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions|Superintendent of Financial Institutions]], the Chair of the [[Ontario Securities Commission]], the Chair of the ''[[Autorité des marchés financiers (Québec)|Autorité des marchés financiers]]'', the Chair of the [[Canadian Securities Administrators]],{{efn|when the Chair of the CSA is already a Chair of the OSC or AMF, the CSA will select an alternative Governor}} a fifth Governor selected by the CSA, and a sixth Governor selected by the other five who is a [[public accountant]] that has audit oversight regulatory experience.&lt;ref&gt;CPAB By-laws, Article 8&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the Council appoints the Board of Directors, who are responsible for supervising the activities of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;CPAB By-laws, Article 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deficiencies and controversies==
A 2007-8 review by CPAB of financial statements audited by the [[Big Six auditors|Big Six]] firms revealed that of 130 audit files examined, 11 were found to have deficiencies.&lt;ref name="TP" /&gt;

In 2011, the Board raised concerns that auditors only [[Emotion|reacted]] when issues were raised by its inspectors, and that they were not taking [[proactive]] measures to improve the quality of their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= McFarland|first= Janet|date= April 18, 2011|title= Audit quality at risk in Canada, regulator warns |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/audit-quality-at-risk-in-canada-regulator-warns/article547732/|newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also noted that the same findings were being noted year after year, and that the majority of deficiencies related to basic audit procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Tedesco|first= Theresa|date= April 4, 2012|title= Watchdog still finds 'deficiencies' in high-risk audits in Canada|url= http://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/watchdog-still-finds-deficiencies-in-high-risk-audits-in-canada|newspaper= [[The Financial Post]]|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Little progress was seen to have occurred in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= McFarland|first= Janet|date= April 3, 2012|title= Audit firms show little progress, weaknesses persist: report|url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/audit-firms-show-little-progress-weaknesses-persist-report/article4097397/|newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a low level of professional [[skepticism]] was still seen as a major issue in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= McFarland|first= Janet|date= April 4, 2013|title= Audits improving but more 'professional skepticism' needed: Watchdog|url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/audits-improving-but-more-professional-skepticism-needed-watchdog/article10764697/|newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, CPAB released a review it conducted of work done by Canadian audit firms with Chinese clients. It found flaws in 12 of the 24 companies examined, and barred one auditor from doing such work until it upgraded its procedures.&lt;ref name="JF2012"&gt;{{cite news |last= McFarland|first= Janet|date= February 21, 2012|title= Canadian audits of China firms had major gaps: regulator |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/canadian-audits-of-china-firms-had-major-gaps-regulator/article547857/|newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was significant, as, in 2011, 56 companies from China and other parts of Asia were listed on the [[TSX]] or [[TSX Venture Exchange]], many getting their listings through [[reverse takeover]]s of dormant [[shell corporation]]s,&lt;ref name="JF2012"/&gt; and [[Sino-Forest Corporation]] had collapsed in mid-year after irregularities were found in its financial results.&lt;ref name="JF2012"/&gt; In 2014, the Board reported that it was still experiencing difficulties in being able to review foreign operations of some Canadian-based companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= McFarland|first= Janet|date= March 31, 2014|title= Audit firm regulator says it can't vouch for work outside Canada|url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/audit-firm-regulator-says-it-cant-vouch-for-work-outside-canada/article17739581/|newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of irregularities such as those occurring at [[Sino-Forest]], the CSA issued proposals in 2013 to require mandatory notification of certain events to reporting issuers and regulatory authorities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Schecter|first= Barbara|date= October 17, 2013|title= Canadian securities regulators to ramp up oversight of auditors|url= http://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/canadian-securities-regulators-to-ramp-up-oversight-of-auditors|newspaper= [[The Financial Post]]|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which were subsequently adopted in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;NI 52-108, ss. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, the Board reported that the incidence of significant findings in files examined was increasing,{{sfn|CPAB|2015a|p=3}} and that the most prominent audit issues concerned the execution of audit fundamentals and the understanding of a client's business processes that are relevant to financial reporting.{{sfn|CPAB|2015a|pp=4-5}} A report earlier that year stated that the incidence of deficiencies observed appeared to be declining in files concerning the Big Four and other national/network firms,{{sfn|CPAB|2015b|p=4}} but was increasing in files concerning regional firms.{{sfn|CPAB|2015b|p=5}}

'''Canton House''' is a historic [[office building]] located on the northeast corner of Water Street and South Street in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], [[United States]]. It is a {{frac|4|1|2}}-story [[Colonial Revival]]-style building, with seven bays across the front façade of Water Street to the south and three bays across the side facing South Street to the west. The first story level is in [[marble]] and brick is laid in [[Flemish bond]] from the second story up. It has a sloped peaked roof with two dormer windows facing west to the side. The main entrance features two fluted [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] stone columns.

It was constructed in 1923 as the headquarters of one of Baltimore's oldest, largest and most colorful businesses,  [[Canton Iron Works|The Canton Company]], a business established in 1828 by [[Peter Cooper]] (1791-1883), noted engineer and industrialist most remembered for inventing and manufacturing the ''[[Tom Thumb (locomotive)|Tom Thumb]]'' [[steam locomotive]] for the recently established [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]], the first passenger railway line in America in 1827 as it made its transition from using horse power to [[steam engine|steam power]] to pull its railroad cars on the first segment of the line from Baltimore southwest to [[Ellicott City, Maryland|Ellicott Mills, Maryland]] on the upper [[Patapsco River]] from [[Baltimore Harbor|Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore]]. [[Columbus O'Donnell]], the son of [[John O'Donnell (sea captain)|John O'Donnell]], a sea captain who brought in the first trade cargos from [[Guangzhou|Canton, China]] to Baltimore and America in 1784, along with [[William Patterson (Maryland)|William Patterson]] (1752-1835), a noted city merchant, civic leader, co-founder of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] and the father of the infamous [[Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte|Elizabeth ("Betsy") Patterson Bonaparte]], the "Belle of Baltimore", who married [[Jerome Bonaparte]] on Christmas Eve, December 24, 1803, the younger brother of the [[First French Empire|French]] Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon I]] and the donater of land for nearby [[Patterson Park]] in 1827.

The Company was established to develop the industrial, commercial  and residential potential of the large tract of land along the north shore of the Patapsco's Northwest Branch, east of the [[Inner Harbor|Inner Harbor (then called "The Basin")]] and southeast of old [[History of Baltimore|Baltimore Town]] and neighboring [[Fells Point, Baltimore]]

'''Christopher Lovelock''' (12 July 1940 – 24 February 2008) was born in the town of [[Saltash|Saltash, Cornwall]] in [[United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]]. He was best known as a pioneer in the field of [[Services marketing|Services Marketing]] among other titles such as author, professor and consultant.  Lovelock was also known for his excellent [[Case study|case studies]].

Christopher Lovelock attained a PhD from [[Stanford University]], publishing his thesis on the topic of "Marketing Public Transportation". Lovelock had earlier graduated with an MBA from [[Harvard University]] after arriving in the US in 1967. Lovelock had also obtained a [[Master's degree|Master of Arts]] in Economics and a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Communications from the [[University of Edinburgh]].

Lovelock embarked on his academic career serving, most significantly, on the faculty of the [[Harvard Business School]] (USA) for 11 years in addition to other academic appointments at distinguished institutions to include [[University of California]] Berkeley (USA), [[Stanford University]] (USA) and the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] (USA). Lovelock’s other visiting appointments include those at [[International Institute for Management Development|IMD]] (Switzerland), [[INSEAD]] (France) and [[University of Queensland]] (Australia). In total, Lovelock had taught in over 30 countries in every continent except Antarctica.
Besides that of his teaching appointments, Christopher Lovelock was also an author or co-author of numerous books, articles and teaching cases. Lovelock’s last [[Academic publishing|academic publication]], "Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy 6th edition," co-authored together with Jochen Wirtz, has been translated into ten languages. Other books include "Product Plus", "Marketing Challenges" and "Public and Nonprofit Marketing" (the latter two co-authored with Charles Weinberg).

Lovelock’s 60 odd articles were also internationally acclaimed. His paper, "Whither Services Marketing? In Search of a New Paradigm and Fresh Perspectives" co-written with Evert Gummesson won the Best Services Article Award in the [[American Marketing Association]] and was a finalist for the IBM award for the best article in the Journal of Service Research. For that and other recognitions, Christopher Lovelock was honoured with the prestigious American Marketing Association’s Award for Career Contributions in the Services Discipline.

The 100 or more teaching cases he wrote were also much heralded. Twice, he won top honours in the [[BusinessWeek]] "European Case of The Year" awards. Famous series include [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[FedEx]]. The latter, written in the 1970s, gained FedEx the wide exposure of potential clients, indirectly contributing to FedEx’s success today. His teaching cases, revered for their acute insights into marketing challenges, retain their positions on bestsellers’ lists more than a quarter of a century after they were published, displaying a strong relevance even in today’s context.
Moving to Eastham, [[Cape Cod]], in 1990, Christopher Lovelock became actively involved with his adopted community. Lending his expertise in areas like education, [[health care]], [[Conservation movement|environmental conservation]] and regional transportation, he became an advocate for a variety of issues such as summer traffic to underground utility lines. Most of these can be traced back to pieces found in the Cape Cod Times for which he was an [[Editorial|Op Ed]] or his advisory position for various local organizations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4060">'''Cummings Research Park''', located primarily in the city of [[Huntsville, Alabama]] is the second largest research park in the country and the fourth largest in the world. It is one of the world’s leading science and technology business parks, with a mixture of Fortune 500 companies, local and international high-tech enterprises, U.S. space and defense agencies, thriving business incubators and competitive higher-education institutions. CRP is the home of nearly 300 companies, more than 26,000 employees and 12,500 students. The Park's major industries are aerospace, defense, engineering, biotechnology, advanced manufacturing, software development, information technology and cyber security.


Cummings Research Park was voted as the Most Outstanding Science Park in the World in 1997 by the Association of University Research Parks and in 2017 The Park was presented with the Developing Communities of Innovation award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huntsvillealabamausa.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=169&amp;Itemid=332 Huntsville Chamber of Commerce - CRP History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==

In 1961, [[Milton K. Cummings]], then president of [[Teledyne Brown Engineering|Brown Engineering Company]], and Joseph C. Moquin, his later successor, selected a tract of undeveloped land on the western edge of Huntsville for building a new headquarters.  Located adjacent to land that had recently been acquired by the [[University of Alabama]] for developing a Huntsville Branch and within a few miles of major Army and NASA development centers on [[Redstone Arsenal]], this area was ideal for establishing a high-technology research park.

Cummings and Moquin, with the support of rocket pioneer [[Wernher von Braun]], proposed that the City of Huntsville zone the area as a research park district. In 1962, the City established this zoning, with 3,000 acres of land officially designated Huntsville Research Park.

Brown Engineering (later [[Teledyne Technologies#Companies|Teledyne Brown Engineering]]) was the first to build in the park, opening its campus the inaugural year. As America rushed into the space race, other companies quickly followed; these included giant national firms such as [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]], [[Northrop Grumman|Northrop]], and [[IBM]], smaller outside firms wanting to open Huntsville operations, and a number of newly organized local enterprises.

In parallel with the growth of industry occupants, the adjacent academic campus also matured; in 1970, this became the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH). The UAH Foundation owned a large portion of land in the research park district, and served as a major promoter of development. When Milton Cummings died in 1973, the district was renamed the Cummings Research Park (CRP). By the end of the 1970s, the development of what is now known as CRP East was nearing completion.

In 1982, the second major phase of CRP was launched with the planned development of CRP West. A substantial new parcel of land, exceeding 800 acres, was purchased and a master plan was established by the City of Huntsville. This new phase strengthened the development restrictions on the park, rivaling, and in many instances exceeding, the quality of planned research and development parks anywhere in the world. The City of Huntsville has continued to acquire land for future growth of CRP, and it is now approaching 4,000 acres.

The '''Durbin amendment''' is a provision of United States federal law, {{USC|15|1693o-2}}, that requires the [[Federal Reserve]] to limit fees charged to retailers for [[debit card]] processing. It was passed as part of the [[Dodd-Frank]] financial reform legislation in 2010, as a last-minute addition by Illinois Senator [[Dick Durbin|Richard Durbin]], after whom the amendment is named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chen|first1=Tim|title=What the Durbin Amendment Means for You|url=http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/2011/07/12/what-the-durbin-amendment-means-for-you|accessdate=9 April 2015|agency=U.S News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the rule to limit fees, [[Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations|12 C.F.R.]]  §235, went into effect, a coalition of merchants sued the Federal Reserve. The rule was upheld when the Supreme Court denied petition for [[certiorari]] in 2014.

==Background==
[[Interchange fees]] are paid to banks by acquirers for the privilege of accepting [[payment cards]]. Merchants and card-issuing banks have long fought over these fees. Prior to the Durbin amendment, card swipe fees were previously unregulated and averaged about 44 cents per transaction.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Marcy. [https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/07/31/judge-strikes-cap-debit-swipe-fees/2603299/ "Judge strikes Fed's cap on debit 'swipe' fees"], ''[[USA Today]]'', Washington, 31 July 2013. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Merchants lobbied heavily for a rule to limit debit card swipe fees.&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, Phil. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-06-28/how-wal-mart-swiped-jpmorgan-in-16-billion-debit-card-battle "How Wal-Mart Swiped JPMorgan in $16 Billion Debit-Card Battle"], ''[[Bloomberg News]]'', 27 June 2011. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; They accomplished this when the Durbin amendment passed with the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation on July 21, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Tim. [http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/2011/07/12/what-the-durbin-amendment-means-for-you "What the Durbin Amendment Means for You"], ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', 12 July 2011. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This was considered a major loss for banks, who receive billions of dollars a year in income from swipe fees.&lt;ref&gt;Mui, Yan Q.. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/fed-to-face-judge-over-swipe-fees/2013/08/20/fcc53e54-09c6-11e3-8974-f97ab3b3c677_story.html "Fed to face judge over swipe fees"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 20 August 2013. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law applies to banks with over $10 billion in assets, and these banks would have to charge debit card interchange fees that are "reasonable and proportional to the actual cost" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/2011/durbin-amendment-explained|title=The Durbin Amendment Explained|publisher=NerdWallet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; of processing the transaction. The bill aimed to restrict anti-competitive practices and encourage competition, and included provisions which allow retailers to refuse to use [[credit cards]] for small purchases and offer incentives for using cash or another type of card.&lt;ref name="BillComparison"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewfr.org/reform_resources_detail?id=0877|title=Side-by-Side Comparison Chart – Key Senate and House Bill Issues|publisher=Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell|work=Pew Financial Reform Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Durbin amendment also gave the Federal Reserve the power to regulate debit card interchange fees, and on December 16, 2010, the Fed proposed a maximum interchange fee of 12 cents per debit card transaction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20101216a.htm|title=Press Release on Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing; Proposed Rule|publisher=[[Federal Reserve]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[CardHub.com]] estimated would cost large banks $14 billion annually.&lt;ref name="interchange-study"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.cardhub.com/interchange-fee-study-2010/|title=Interchange Study|publisher=CardHub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 29, 2011, the Fed issued its final rule, which holds that the maximum interchange fee an issuer can receive from a single debit card transaction is 21 cents plus 5 [[basis points]] multiplied by the amount of the transaction.&lt;ref name="final-fed-rule"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20110629a.htm|title=FRB: Press Release|publisher=Federal Reserve}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rule also allows issuers to raise their interchange fees by as much as one cent if they implement certain fraud-prevention measures.&lt;ref name="final-fed-rule" /&gt;  An issuer eligible for this adjustment, could therefore receive an interchange fee of as much as 24 cents for the average debit card transaction (valued at $38),&lt;ref name="final-fed-rule" /&gt; according to the Federal Reserve. This cap—which took effect on October 1, 2011, rather than July 21, 2011, as was previously announced—will reduce fees roughly $9.4 billion annually, according to [[CardHub.com]].&lt;ref name="interchange-study" /&gt; As a result of the government limiting their revenue from interchange fees, banks made plans to raise account maintenance fees to compensate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.com/news/local_news/new-fees-for-banks-likely-to-mean-new-fees-from/article_9d295744-af8f-5eea-bbe1-a33ac5200f52.html|title=New fees for banks likely to mean new fees from banks – Timesonline.com: Local News|date=2011-10-03|publisher=Timesonline.com|accessdate=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal Reserve Rule===
The rule that the Federal Reserve issued went into effect on October 1, 2011 and capped the interchange rate paid to non-exempt card issuers at 0.05 percent plus twenty-one cents.  The rule also allowed these non-exempt card issuers to earn an additional one-cent fraud prevention adjustment for implementation of fraud prevention policies.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Reserve Board Press Release [http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20110629a.htm], ''[[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]]'', 29 June 2011. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to the rule===
Merchants and card-issuing banks opposed the Federal Reserve rule.

The Merchant Payments Coalition (MPC) argued that this rule was unfair as the Durbin amendment required the Federal Reserve to ensure that banks take effective steps against fraud and determine how much of the cost banks should bear themselves. The MPC said that banks should actually have to reduce fraud before receiving more funds. The MPC pointed out that the common practice of having customers merely signing for debit card purchases processed through the Visa and MasterCard payment networks instead of requiring a PIN greatly increases fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Flagg, Michael. [http://www.unfaircreditcardfees.com/site/press/the_new_federal_reserve_rule_will_enrich_banks_for_not_preventing_frau "The New Federal Reserve Rule Will Enrich Banks for Not Preventing Fraud, Says the Merchants Payments Coalition"], ''Merchant Payments Coalition'', 27 July 2012. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Bankers Association]] opposed the rule because it represents an “unprecedented transfer in costs from retailers to consumers – the result of government price fixing" leading to "consumers paying higher fees for basic bank services.”&lt;ref&gt;Touryalai, Halah. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2011/10/13/new-bill-could-kill-durbins-debit-card-fees/ "New Bill Aims To Kill Durbin's Debit Card Fees"], ''[[Forbes]]'', 13 October 2011. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litigation against the rule==
A coalition of merchants including the [[National Association of Convenience Stores]] (NACS) and [[National Restaurant Association]] sued the Federal Reserve and argued the rule exceeded the authority granted by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Vicki. [http://thehill.com/policy/finance/215454-business-groups-ask-supreme-court-to-review-swipe-fee-decision "Business groups ask Supreme Court to review swipe fee decision"], ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', 18 August 2014. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===District court===
In July 2013, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon ruled that the Federal Reserve did not comply with the Durbin amendment when crafting a rule to limit debit card swipe fees. Judge Leon ordered the Federal Reserve to re-write its rule governing the cap on debit card swipe fees and implement a temporary regulation as well.&lt;ref name=DistrictCourt&gt;{{Cite court |litigants=NACS v. Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys. |vol=958 |reporter=F. Supp 2d |opinion=85 |pinpoint=103 |court=D.D.C. |date=2013 |url=https://nrf.com/sites/default/files/Documents/Decision_3.pdf |accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opinion was generally scathing and noted that the agency overruled its own staff, who had recommended a cap of 12 cents per transaction.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Danielle. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/court-reverses-ruling-on-swipe-fees-in-favor-of-banks/2014/03/21/55304440-b105-11e3-95e8-39bef8e9a48b_story.html "Court reverses ruling on swipe fees in favor of banks"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 21 March 2014. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Leon held the Federal Reserve Board "clearly disregarded Congress' statutory intent by inappropriately inflating all debit-card transaction fees by billions of dollars." The judge also ruled that the Federal Reserve failed to ensure that merchants enjoy access to "multiple unaffiliated networks" to process each debit-card transaction, as also required by the Durbin amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Reckard, E. Scott. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/court-reverses-ruling-on-swipe-fees-in-favor-of-banks/2014/03/21/55304440-b105-11e3-95e8-39bef8e9a48b_story.html "Judge rejects Fed's cap on debit-card fees as too easy on banks"], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', 31 July 2013. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court of Appeals===
The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and held the Federal Reserve reasonably interpreted Congress' intent of the Durbin amendment through its 2011 rule limiting swipe fees. “Given that the Board’s rule advances the Durbin amendment’s purpose, we decline to second-guess its reasoned decision to reject an alternative option that might have further advanced the purpose.”&lt;ref name=COA&gt;{{Cite court |litigants=NACS v. Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys. |vol=746 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=474 |pinpoint=495 |court=D.C. Cir. |date=2014 |url=https://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/InterchangeFees03212014.pdf |accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three judge panel noted that “Congress put the Board, the district court and us in a real bind...given that the Durbin amendment was crafted in conference committee at the eleventh hour, its language is confusing and its structure convoluted.”&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Robert. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-21/durbin-chided-by-judges-says-swipe-fee-ruling-is-bank-giveaway- "Durbin Chided by Judges Says Swipe-Fee Ruling Is Bank ‘Giveaway’"], ''[[Bloomberg News]]'', 21 March 2014. Retrieved on 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supreme Court===
On August 18, 2014, NACS filed a petition for certiorari. On January 20, 2015, the Supreme Court denied NACS petition for certiorari. The decision upholds the Federal Reserve rule on the interchange rate paid to non-exempt card issuers at 0.05 percent plus twenty-one cents.&lt;ref&gt;Hurley, Lawrence. Stephenson, Emily. [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/20/us-usa-court-debitcards-idUSKBN0KT1LA20150120 "Supreme Court rejects challenge to debit card 'swipe fees' rules"], ''[[Reuters]]'', 20 January 2015.

'''Eugen Viktor Feller''' (26 January 1871 – 15 November 1936) was a [[Croatia]]n pharmacist, [[entrepreneur]] and pioneer of the industrial drug production in Croatia.

Feller was born in 1871, in [[Lwów]] region, which after the [[partition of Poland]] was at the time a part of [[Austro-Hungary]] province known as [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], to a [[Jew]]ish&lt;ref name="žz"&gt;{{harvtxt|Snješka Knežević|2011|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; family of David and Elizabeta ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Holzer) Feller. He was married to Ida (née Oehmichen) Feller, with whom he had twelve children, among them [[William Feller]]. In the late 19th century, Feller achieved fame with the elixir "Elsa Fluid" (named after his mother nickname, Elsa), whose production along with other cosmetic preparations took place in [[Donja Stubica]]. In Donja Stubica, Feller built the pharmaceutical factory, laboratory, and family house with pharmacy. Feller presented "Elsa Fluid" as a cure for all diseases. It was exported in almost all European countries, as well as [[Egypt]], [[Japan]] and [[China]], while in the [[United States]] it was very popular at the time of [[Prohibition]], due to high percentage of alcohol in its content. Feller was great philanthropist who financially helped the students, poor families, children and various societies. In 1918, he opened a trust fund to help the mothers of soldiers who were killed in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.donjastubica.hr/donja-stubica/povijest.html|title=Povijest Donja Stubica|publisher=[[Donja Stubica]]|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Jasenka Ferber Bogdan; Investicije farmaceuta Eugena Viktora Fellera, pionira industrijske proizvodnje lijekova u Hrvatskoj; 34 internacionalni kongres za povijest farmacije; Listopad 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Stella Fatović-Ferenčić, Jasenka Ferber Bogdan; Ljekarna K Sv.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2581">'''Express pricing''' is a form of pricing where, in a reverse of [[economies of scale]], retailers raise their prices slightly in smaller stores.&lt;ref name="ufpap"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ppMzyDFyHUwC|title=Understanding Food: Principles and Preparation|last=Brown|first=Amy Christine|year=2010|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of it originates from [[Tesco Express]], but it can be used to apply to any retailer operating a similar policy. According to [[Sainsbury's]], this can be attributed to discrepancies in "operational requirements and running costs. Rents, for example",&lt;ref name="sainsbury's"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.sainsburys.co.uk/help/prices-payment/convenience-store-prices|title=Why are prices different between your large and convenience stores|publisher=[[Sainsbury's]]|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it being "more of a challenge to deliver products to our local stores"&lt;ref name="sainsbury's"/&gt; and "other factors such as staffing, local rates and a focus on convenience products".&lt;ref name="sainsbury's"/&gt;

[[Tesco]] themselves have acknowledged this, saying "Our prices don’t differ greatly but they will differ slightly because of the difference in costs of running the smaller stores. Express stores are typically on the high street, which means Tesco don’t very often own the land. So the overheads involved in running a smaller store are higher."&lt;ref name="tesco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.confused.com/money/articles/mystery-shop-tesco-vs-tesco-express#ixzz2UhlHm8jk|title=Mystery shop: Tesco vs. Tesco Express|publisher=[[Confused.com]]|accessdate=29 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229223829/http://www.confused.com/money/articles/mystery-shop-tesco-vs-tesco-express#ixzz2UhlHm8jk|archivedate=29 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Marks and Spencer]]'s policy of charging express pricing in their [[Simply Food]] branches was reported on. A spokesperson has admitted "prices are a little higher than at our high street stores".&lt;ref name="m&amp;s"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.confused.com/money/articles/mystery-shop-how-much-more-do-you-pay-in-m-s-simply-food#ixzz2V8aHbrYr|title=Mystery shop: How much do you pay in M&amp;S Simply Food?|publisher=[[Confused.com]]|accessdate=3 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927074743/http://www.confused.com/money/articles/mystery-shop-how-much-more-do-you-pay-in-m-s-simply-food#ixzz2V8aHbrYr|archivedate=27 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forrest Edward Mars Jr.''' (August 16, 1931 &amp;ndash; July 26, 2016) was an American [[heir]]. He was the eldest son of Audrey Ruth (Meyer) and [[Forrest Mars Sr.]], and the grandson of [[Franklin Clarence Mars|Frank C. Mars]], the founder of [[Mars, Incorporated]], the [[confectionery]] company. In March 2015, ''[[Forbes]]'' estimated his wealth to be $26.8 billion&lt;ref name="Forbes400 2010" /&gt;
up from US $11 billion in March 2010.&lt;ref name="Billionaires 2010" /&gt; In October 2012, the Bloomberg Billionaires List ranked Mars as the 31st richest man in the world with an estimated net worth of 20.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bloomberg Billionares Index |accessdate=December 3, 2012 |url=http://topics.bloomberg.com/bloomberg-billionaires-index/ |publisher=Bloomberg LP |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214085457/http://topics.bloomberg.com/bloomberg-billionaires-index/ |archivedate=December 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public activities==
As owner of the Diamond Cross Ranch, an {{convert|82000|acre|adj=on}} parcel along [[Montana]]’s [[Tongue River (Montana)|Tongue River]] and on the northern end of the [[Powder River Basin]], Mars was active in opposing the development of his part of what's been called the "most productive coal and natural gas fields in the nation."&lt;ref name="ce08"&gt;{{cite web|title=Candy Billionaire Fights Energy Industry Push|publisher=Chief Engineers Association of Chicagoland|url=http://www.chiefengineer.org/content/content_display.cfm/seqnumber_content/3292.htm|year=2008|accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies that hold the oil and gas leases to his land, rights originally made possible by the [[Stock-Raising Homestead Act]] and the [[Mineral Leasing Act of 1920|Mineral Leasing Act]], are seeking to exercise those rights on his ranch. Mars was reportedly concerned about the large amount of water that energy exploration and production projects consume, water needed by his ranch.&lt;ref name="ce08"/&gt;

Mars and his ex-wife donated the funds that made it possible for the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation to reconstruct an 18th-century coffeehouse in [[Colonial Williamsburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=R. Charlton's Coffeehouse|url=http://www.colonialwilliamsburg.org/christmas/coffeehouse.cfm|publisher=[[Colonial Williamsburg]] Foundation|quote=A generous gift from Forrest and Deborah Mars made the Coffeehouse project possible.

The ex-couple made significant contributions to the privately owned governing body for [[Fort Ticonderoga]], though a falling-out between Executive Director Nicholas Westbrook and Mrs. Mars led to her resignation from the board and the end of the then-couple's financial support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fort Ti sees gloomy financial picture|url=http://www.pressrepublican.com/0100_news/local_story_209054507.html/resources_printstory|publisher=[[Press-Republican]]|date=July 27, 2008|quote=Mr. Mars said he and his wife paid for most of the Mars Education Center.  'As far as the new center, I would think that besides not communicating with your president (Mrs. Mars) regarding the opening of it, the exhibits to be in it, the budget for operating it and a program for the future use, you might have been nice enough and polite enough to communicate with the major donor (Mr. Mars). Not a word from you to either of us. We do not even know if you can fund it.'|accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wealth==
According to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine as of 2010, he was the 52nd richest person in the world,&lt;ref name="Billionaires 2010" /&gt; the 26th richest American,&lt;ref name="Forbes400 2010"/&gt; and the richest [[Virginia]]n.

==Family==
Mars married Virginia Cretella, born {{birth based on age as of date|21|1951|05|0}}.&lt;!--graduated Vassar 1951--&gt;&lt;ref name="AAVC"/&gt;

'''Francis Cabot Lowell''' (April 7, 1775&lt;ref name=FrancisCabotLowellDates/&gt; – August 10, 1817) was an [[United States|American]] [[businessman]] for whom the [[city]] of [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], is named. He was instrumental in bringing the [[Industrial Revolution]] to the [[United States]].

==Early life==
Francis Cabot Lowell was born in the city of [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=FrancisCabotLowellDates/&gt; His father was [[John Lowell|John Lowell II]], member of the [[Continental Congress]] and judge for the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts]]. His mother was Susanna [[Cabot family|Cabot]].&lt;ref name=FrancisCabotLowellDates/&gt;  He had an aptitude for mathematics in his youth.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Entrepreneurs: Explorations Within the American Business Tradition|last = Sobel|first = Robert|publisher = Beard Books|year = 2000|isbn = 9781587980275|location = |pages = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1786, Lowell graduated from [[Phillips Academy]].&lt;ref name=FrancisCabotLowellAndover&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andover.edu/About/NotableAlumni/LongList/Pages/1700s.aspx|title=Notable Alumni Long List: 1700s|publisher=[[Phillips Academy]]|accessdate=July 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1793, he graduated from [[Harvard College]].

==Career==
[[File:BMC Mill Waltham.jpg|thumb|Boston Manufacturing Company, Waltham, Massachusetts]]
In July 1795, after graduation, Lowell set out on a merchant ship carrying cargo to various places including [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] in [[Spain]] and [[Bordeaux, France]]. He went to learn about shipping and being a merchant, but used the trip to learn about France.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Life and Times of Francis Cabot Lowell|last = Rosenberg|first = Chaim|publisher = Lexington Books|year = 2011|isbn = 9780739146859|location = Blue Ridge Summit, PA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He spent a year touring France, gripped in [[French Revolution|revolution]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In July 1796, he returned to Boston and set up as a merchant on Long Wharf.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From 1798 to 1808 Lowell was engaged in overseas trade, importing silks and tea from China and hand-spun and hand-woven cotton textiles from India.  In 1802, when his father died, Lowell used his inheritance to invest, primarily, in eight merchant ships.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. Economic History|last = Carson|first = Thomas|publisher = Gale|year = 1999|isbn = |location = Detroit|pages = |last2 = Bonk|first2 = Mary|chapter = Francis Cabot Lowell|url = http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?failOverType=&amp;query=&amp;prodId=BIC1&amp;windowstate=normal&amp;contentModules=&amp;display-query=&amp;mode=view&amp;displayGroupName=Reference&amp;limiter=&amp;currPage=&amp;disableHighlighting=false&amp;displayGroups=&amp;sortBy=&amp;search_within_results=&amp;p=BIC1&amp;action=e&amp;catId=&amp;activityType=&amp;scanId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CK1667000122&amp;source=Bookmark&amp;u=mlin_n_umass&amp;jsid=eab6ed16f995e42a7cb625e4389b97f5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1802, with Uriah Cotting, [[Harrison Gray Otis (politician)|Harrison Gray Otis]] and others, Francis Cabot Lowell developed India Wharf and its warehouses on Boston harbor, which became the center of the trade with Asia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Later, the same group of investors developed the Broad Street area for the retail trade.  To  enlarge his fortune, Lowell bought a rum distillery, importing [[molasses]] from the Caribbean sugar-producing islands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Lowell spent months improving on the machinery of his rum distilling process.

Despite political independence, the United States remained dependent on imports for manufactured goods. The conflicts between the European Powers and the [[Embargo Act of 1807|Embargo of 1807]] severely disrupted trade between the United States, Great Britain, France and Asia.  Lowell reached the conclusion that to be truly independent, the United States needed to manufacture goods at home. In June 1810, he went on a two-year visit with his family to [[Scotland]] and [[England]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; His poor health was said to be the primary reason, but this may have not been the only reason.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Lowell developed an interest in the textile industries of [[Lancashire]] and Scotland, especially the spinning and weaving machines, which were operated by water power or steam power. He was not able to buy drawings or a model of a power loom.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mill Power: The Origin and Impact of Lowell National Historical Park|last = Marion|first = Paul|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1442236288|location = |pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He secretly studied the machines.  In [[Edinburgh]] he met [[Nathan Appleton]] who would later become a partner in the Lowell mills.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As the [[War of 1812]] began, Lowell and his family left Europe and on their way home, the boat and all their personal belongings were searched at the Halifax port to ensure that no contraband was being smuggled out of Great Britain.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lowell had memorized all the workings of British power looms without writing anything down.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Textiles===
In 1814, he enlisted the support of his three brothers-in-law, Charles, James and [[Patrick Tracy Jackson]], and obtained the financial backing of the merchants [[Nathan Appleton]] and [[Israel Thorndike]] to establish the [[Boston Manufacturing Company]]&lt;ref name=FrancisCabotLowellPBS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/theymadeamerica/whomade/lowell_hi.html|title=Who Made America? Pioneers: Francis Cabot Lowell|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|accessdate=July 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], using the power of the [[Charles River]]. The BMC was the first "integrated" textile mill in America in which all operations for converting raw [[cotton]] into finished [[cloth]] could be performed in one mill building.  Lowell hired the gifted machinist [[Paul Moody (inventor)|Paul Moody]] to assist him in designing  efficient cotton spinning and weaving machines, based on the British models, but with many technological improvements suited to the conditions of [[New England]].  Lowell and Moody were awarded the patent for their power loom in 1815.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

To raise capital for their mills, Lowell and partners Aidan and Merquack pioneered a basic tool of modern corporate finance by selling $1000 shares of stock to a select group of wealthy investors, such as Senators James Lloyd Jr. and [[Christopher Gore]], [[Israel Thorndike|Israel Thorndike Sr.]] and [[Harrison Gray Otis (politician)|Harrison Gray Otis]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This form of shareholder corporation endures to this day in the well-known form of public stock offerings.&lt;ref name="FrancisCabotLowellPBS" /&gt;

In 1814, the [[Boston Manufacturing Company]] built its first mill beside the [[Charles River]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]], housing an integrated set of technologies that converted raw cotton all the way to finished cloth. [[Patrick Tracy Jackson]] was the first manager of the BMC with Paul Moody in charge of the machinery. The Waltham mill, where raw cotton was processed into finished cloth, was the forerunner of the 19th-century American factory. Lowell also pioneered the employment of women, from the age of 15-35 from [[New England]] farming families, as textile workers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  He paid these "mill girls" (also known as [[Lowell Mill Girls]]) lower wages than men.  Women lived in company run boarding houses with chaperones and were involved in religious and educational activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FrancisCabotLowellPBS" /&gt;  The Waltham Machine Shop attached to the BMC made power looms for sale to other American cotton mills. Nathan Appleton established a region-wide system to sell the cloth manufactured by the BMC.  Their success in Waltham motivated them to look for other locations.  They found a site in East Chelmsford, renamed for Lowell after his death.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FrancisCabotLowellPBS" /&gt;

The end of the [[War of 1812]] was a severe threat to the budding domestic textile industry as the British dumped cheap cotton cloth on the American market. In 1816, Lowell traveled to Washington to successfully lobby for protective tariffs on cotton products that were subsequently included in the [[Tariff of 1816]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He died on August 10, 1817 at the age of 42 from [[pneumonia]] only three years after building his first mill.  Lowell left the [[Boston Manufacturing Company]] financially healthy. In 1821, dividends were paid out at 27.5% to shareholders.&lt;ref name="FrancisCabotLowellPBS" /&gt;   The success of the BMC at Waltham exhausted the water power of the [[Charles River]].  To expand the enterprise, in 1822, Lowell's partners moved north to the more powerful [[Merrimack River]] and named their new mill town at the [[Pawtucket Falls (Massachusetts)|Pawtucket Falls]] on the [[Merrimack River]] "Lowell," after their visionary leader.  The [[Waltham-Lowell system|Waltham-Lowell System]], pioneered by Lowell and first introduced at the Waltham mill, was expanded to the new industrial city of Lowell and soon spread to the Midwest and the South.  The mechanized textile system, introduced by Francis Cabot Lowell, remained dominant in [[New England]] for a century until the industry shifted to the Midwest and the South.  By the close of the nineteenth-century the United States had a thriving textile industry for home consumption and for export.

==Personal life==
In 1798, Lowell married Hannah Jackson, daughter of Jonathan Jackson and Hannah Tracy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They had four children; [[John Lowell, Jr. (philanthropist)|John Lowell Jr.]], benefactor of [[Lowell Institute]]; businessman Francis Cabot Lowell, Jr.; Edward Lowell, a lawyer; and Susanna Lowell, who married her first cousin [[John Amory Lowell]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Lowell was originally buried with his wife and step-mother Rebecca at the Central Burying Ground on Boston Common in tomb 36.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 1894 his tomb was one of 900 discovered when Boston constructed the underground subway line on Tremont Street.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  His body was moved to Forest Hills Cemetery where it remains today.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Francis Cabot Lowell was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 2013.{{Citation needed|date = March 2015|reason = list of inductees does not exist to confirm this.}}

==Biography==

===Early life===
Lowy was born in [[Czechoslovakia]]&lt;ref name="cashman"/&gt; (in what is now [[Slovakia]]), and was forced to live in a ghetto in [[Hungary]] during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hewett|first=Jennifer|title=Holocaust truth set Frank Lowy free|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/business-old/holocaust-truth-set-frank-lowy-free/story-e6frg9gx-1225952919237?nk=728c50eb35798482b4f4d13453775a3f-1467928777|publisher=The Australian|date=November 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his way to France in 1946, where he boarded the ship ''Yagur'', heading for [[Mandatory Palestine]]. However, he was caught en route by the British authorities and interned in a [[Cyprus internment camps|detention camp in Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keinon|first=Herb|title=Frank Lowy: From Hagana to $3.8 billion magnate|work=Jerusalem Post|date=May 30, 2006|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-124649874.html|quote=One of 750 passengers who after World War II left France on board the illegal immigrant ship Yagur, Lowy was caught en route by the British and deported to the detention camp in Cyprus.|publisher=via HighBeam {{Subscription required}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowy joined the [[Haganah]], and then the [[Golani Brigade]], and fought in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] in the [[Galilee]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keinon|first=Herb|title=Frank Lowy: From Hagana to $3.8 billion magnate|work=Jerusalem Post|date=May 30, 2006|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-124649874.html|quote=From Atlit Lowy eventually joined the Hagana and then the Golani Brigade, fighting during the War of Independence in the Galilee and in Gaza.|publisher=via HighBeam {{Subscription required}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
In 1952, Lowy left [[Israel]] and joined his family, who had left Europe for Australia and started a business delivering small goods.&lt;ref name="age2004"/&gt; In 1953, he met fellow immigrant John Saunders.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/cbd/singin-in-the-rain-in-the-hunter-valley-20160509-gopnnj.html#ixzz4AuhOaCJ9 |title=CBD: Frank's back|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |author=Kruger, Colin |date=10 May 2016 |access-date=7 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair became business partners, eventually creating Westfield Development Corporation through the development of a shopping centre at [[Blacktown, New South Wales|Blacktown]] in [[Greater Western Sydney|Sydney's western suburbs]].&lt;ref name="age2004"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/04/23/1082616328856.html |title=No longer a family affair|work=[[The Age]] |author1=Myer, Rod |author2=Lynch, Michael |date=24 April 2004 |accessdate=7 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next 30 years, Lowy and Saunders developed shopping centres across Australia and the United States (from 1977);&lt;ref name="age2004"/&gt; and listed the company on the [[Australian Stock Exchange]] in 1960 as Westfield Development Corporation.&lt;ref name="age2004"/&gt; Saunders sold his interests and left the company in 1987.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} In the 1990s Lowy took the company to New Zealand, then the United Kingdom in the 2000s.&lt;ref name="age2004"/&gt;

Lowy was appointed a Director of the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] in 1995, and was reappointed in 2000 and 2003, concluding his term in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rba.gov.au/about-rba/history/rba-board-members.html |title=Past &amp; Present Reserve Bank Board Members |publisher=Reserve Bank of Australia |work=About the RBA |year=2011 |accessdate=30 July 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Lowy and related interests were mentioned in documents stolen from the [[LGT Bank]] of [[Liechtenstein]] by a former employee. A subsequent US Senate probe and an [[Australian Taxation Office]] audit in which Lowy and his sons, David and Steven, were investigated on their involvement with financial institutions in [[tax haven]]s located in [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Switzerland]]. Lowy maintained he had not done anything wrong and the matter was settled with the ATO and no action was taken after that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.afr.com/news/death-and-taxes-how-frank-lowy-faced-off-one-and-settled-the-other-20150717-gienni?login_token=vn4hSSCXXwclO_mpYqN7EJgEk2yPLN6VFgzzbmQHqB0z-_qC0ORPLtbnMzwqvr6cCKMgQjHB1SfbFxBoP_MpNQ&amp;expiry=1461121046&amp;single_use_token=AFFYm4n3ORE4hjw8SdzqfCbQg77fS_A7xv_jI4jzoE8QTHu4s4nZVOQAKA2cKuK20uZzNHSL0JlSqcFvhMXAkQ|work=The Australian Financial Review|accessdate=20 April 2016|date=18 July 2015|title=Death and taxes: how Frank Lowy faced off one and settled the other}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/probe-into-lowys-offshore-banking/2008/07/17/1216163002718.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=17 July 2008|date=17 July 2008|title=Probe into Lowys offshore banking}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/us-ran-two-investigations-into-lowys-bank-links-20101208-18pxy.html |work=The Age |location=Australia |title=US ran two investigations into Lowys' bank links |author=Wood, Leonie |date=9 December 2010 |accessdate=29 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Elliott, Geoff |author2=Hewett, Jennifer |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/lowy-family-hid-millions/story-e6frg6tf-1111116947059 |work=The Australian |date=18 July 2008 |accessdate=29 July 2011 |title=Lowy family 'hid millions' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After turning 80 in October 2010, effective May 2011, Lowy officially stood down as Executive Chairman of the Westfield Group, taking on the role of Non-Executive Chairman.

Maytag''', founded the [[Maytag]] Company, which eventually became the Maytag Corporation which was acquired by the [[Whirlpool Corporation]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ingham |first=John  |authorlink= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Suu9yUKdA8IC&amp;pg=PA874&amp;ots=vGXqRUOSN-&amp;dq=%22+Elmer+Henry+Maytag%22&amp;sig=QI4mIisc4tXcK19q72YaGuoGisg |title=Biographical Dictionary of American Business Leaders |year=1983 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location= | pages= |isbn=0-313-23908-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth==
F.L. Maytag was born July 14, 1857 in [[Elgin, Illinois]]. The eldest of 10 children born to German/Jewish immigrants, Amelia Tarebun (1837–?) and Daniel William Maytag (1831–?) [the original spelling of their name was Maitag "May Day" prior to immigrating to the United States, and was "Americanized" to "Maytag" upon arrival]. The full set of children were: Frederick Louis Maytag I (1857&amp;ndash;1937);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Letters |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,742636-3,00.html |quote=Knowing your yearning for absolute accuracy, beg your permission to advise that you announced the death of the wrong Maytag in your Milestones department in your issue of Oct. 19. The item should have stated that Theodore Henry Maytag, age 67, had died and not Elmer Henry Maytag. Elmer Henry Maytag is a son of Frederick Louis Maytag, is president of the Maytag Co. here and very much alive in his late 40s. He is also a member, by appointment of the President, of the Unemployment Committee which is chaired by Mr. Gifford. |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= November 23, 1931 |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis R. Maytag (1859–?); Martha M. Maytag (1862–?); Theodore Henry Maytag (1864–1931); Jacob B. Maytag (1867–?); Emma Maytag (1869–?); Daniel C. Maytag (1872–?); Helena Maytag (1875–?); Anna A. Maytag (1878–?); and Viola Maytag (1880–?).&lt;ref name=census1880&gt;In the [[1880 US Census]] for [[Jefferson, Iowa]] Daniel's mother Mary Maytag (1800–?) is living with them.&lt;/ref&gt; When ten years old F.L. traveled in a covered wagon with his family to a small farm near [[Laurel, Iowa]], in 1867.

==Education==
F.L. Maytag attended [[North Central College]] in Naperville, Illinois, in 1872-73.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTNcKAGy_CkC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=maytag+%22north+central+college%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0L8IKx6A5N&amp;sig=itbmpHLy9khVC5isXYJvhT2AWSc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=K0ogSvSiAZ_UlQe6g_WRBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6 |title=Naperville, Illinois - Jo Fredell Higgins |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
In 1893, F.L., his two brothers-in-law, and George W. Parsons each contributed [[US$]]600, for a total of [[US$]]2,400, to start a new farm implement company named Parsons Band-Cutter &amp; Self Feeder Company. This company produced threshing machines, band-cutters, and self-feeder attachments invented by Parsons.

F.L. Maytag eventually took sole control of the firm and renamed it the Maytag Company. As Maytag grew, F.L. forayed into other businesses such as the [[Maytag-Mason Motor Company]] automobiles. In the 1910s, F.L. left the day-to-day company operation in the hands of sons [[Elmer Henry Maytag]] and [[Lewis Bergman Maytag]], to concentrate on other business areas including innovations of a washing machine with a gas powered motor branded as the [[Multi-Motor]] and a washing machine with an agitator that forced the water through the clothes branded as the [[Gyrafoam]]. These inventions proved extremely valuable as by 1927, Maytag was producing more than twice the washers of its nearest competition and had outperformed the industry with growth doubling for five consecutive years.

Even after [[Elmer Henry Maytag]] became Maytag's president in 1926, F.L. was active in promoting Maytag products, and ensuring worker happiness and often greeted employees by asking, "Is everybody happy?"

Mr. Maytag was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1995.

==Marriage==
F.L. married Dena Bergman, and they had two sons and two daughters.  F.L. donated a {{convert|40|acre|m2|sing=on}} park and swimming pool to the city of [[Newton, Iowa]], now named Maytag Park and Maytag Pool. He built and donated the Maytag Hotel and spearheaded a theater and a water plant. F.L. also built hundreds of houses for his workers, selling them on easy terms.

==Death==
In 1937, Frederick Maytag died of a heart ailment at Good Samaritan Hospital, near his winter home in [[Beverly Hills, California]]. He left a [[US$]]10 million estate (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10|1938}}}} million today).&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=In Jasper County |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,883015,00.html?iid=chix-sphere |quote=Great is the name of Maytag in [[Jasper County, Iowa|Jasper County, Ia]].

A special train brought mourners from the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] to [[Newton, Iowa]], and an estimated 10,000 factory workers and salesmen formed a line five blocks long to observe the casket processional.

'''Gary Wayne Hall, Jr.''' (born September 26, 1974) is an American former competition swimmer who represented the United States at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]], and [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympics]] and won ten Olympic medals (five gold, three silver, two bronze).  He is a former world record-holder in two relay events.  Hall is well known for his "pro-wrestling like" antics before a competition; frequently strutting onto the pool deck in boxing shorts and robe, shadow boxing and flexing for the audience.

==Family==
His father, [[Gary Hall, Sr.]], also competed in three Olympics as a swimmer (1968, 1972 and 1976).  His maternal uncle, [[Charles Keating III]], swam in the 1976 Olympics, and his maternal grandfather, [[Charles Keating|Charles Keating, Jr.]], was a national swimming champion in the 1940s.

==Career==

===1996 Atlanta Games===
In his first [[1996 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] at the age of 21 in Atlanta, Hall had only 6 years of swimming experience yet he already had a well-known rivalry with Russia's [[Alexander Popov (swimmer)|Alexander Popov]].  Hall and his teammates dominated the relay events, but Popov beat Hall in the individual events.  The rivalry grew more bitter than ever.  Hall responded by coming to his next event in leather motorcycle pants and executing his usual shadow boxing and flexing routine.  Eventually, Popov defeated Hall in the individual 100 m freestyle and 50 m freestyle.

Hall won two individual silvers and two team relay golds at the games, including helping set the world record in both the 400 m [[Freestyle swimming|freestyle]] and [[Medley swimming|medley]] relays.

===1996–2000===
In 1998, Hall was suspended by [[International Swimming Federation]] (FINA) for [[marijuana]] use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E7D81F3EF93AA35754C0A96E958260|title=NY Times | work=The New York Times | date=July 9, 1998 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, he was diagnosed with [[diabetes mellitus type 1|Type 1 diabetes]], commonly referred to as childhood or juvenile diabetes. Upon his diagnosis, Hall struggled with the possibilities and the effects he knew the medical condition would have on his life. He took a short hiatus from swimming, but returned to compete in the 2000 U.S. Olympic Trials. There he won the 50 m [[Freestyle swimming|freestyle]] and placed second in the 100 m [[Freestyle swimming|freestyle]]. His 50 m time of 21.76 seconds set a new American record, beating the ten-year-old record set by [[Tom Jager]].

===2000 Sydney Games===
Hall's success continued in the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. He won the gold medal in the individual 50 m [[Freestyle swimming|freestyle]], tying with his fellow U.S. Team member [[Anthony Ervin]], and won the gold and silver in the team relays. He also won a bronze in the individual 100-meter freestyle race.

Prior to the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay, Hall posted on his blog: "My biased opinion says that we will smash them (Australia's 4x100m team) like guitars. Historically the U.S. has always risen to the occasion. But the logic in that remote area of my brain says it won't be so easy for the United States to dominate the waters this time."

Hall swam the last leg in the relay, against Australian [[Ian Thorpe]]. Hall had a better start and came up a half body length in front of Thorpe. Hall led the first length and was 0.23 seconds ahead at the turn but Thorpe fought back, and with 15 metres to go both swimmers were even, but Thorpe finished first by a hand length, inflicting the United States' first ever Olympic defeat in the event.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PgUS2bglyI&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian team responded to Hall's remarks after the race by playing [[air guitar]] on the pool deck. Hall recalled the race, saying, "I don't even know how to play the guitar...I consider it the best relay race I've ever been part of. I doff my cap to the great Ian Thorpe. He had a better finish than I had."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,55195,00.html | work=Time | title=The Stuff of Heroes | date=September 18, 2000 | accessdate=May 3, 2010 | first=Tom | last=Dusevic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another member of Australia's victorious 4x100 team, [[Michael Klim]], recalled that "Hall was the first swimmer to come over and congratulate us. Even though he dished it out, he was a true sportsman". The decisive moment in the relay race had been Klim's opening leg where he set a new 100 meter world record of 48.18, gaining a 0.71s advantage over [[Anthony Ervin]], a lead which his Australian teammates successfully defended. Hall clocked a faster 100 meters than Thorpe (48.24 to 48.30), but got out-touched to the wall by Thorpe (who earlier in the night set a new World Record to win Gold in the [[Swimming at the 2000 Summer Olympics – Men's 400 metre freestyle|400 meter freestyle]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/sport/swimming/klim-relives-the-night-we-smashed-them-like-guitars-20100907-14zms.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Swimming/Features/2010/October/08/A-decade-later-Gary-Hall-Jr]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004 Athens Games===
At the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], Hall again won the gold medal in [[Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's 50 metre freestyle|50 m freestyle]].  At 29, he became the oldest American male Olympic swimmer since 1924 when [[Duke Kahanamoku]] competed.  Despite having swum the fastest 50 in the year leading up to the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], he was regarded as a long shot to medal in the 50 m freestyle.  He also won a bronze medal for competing in the preliminary heat of the 4×100-meter freestyle relay.

===2008 Olympic Trials===
Hall failed to qualify for the 2008 Olympic Team after finishing 4th in the 50 Meter Finals at the US Olympic Swimming Trials (Located in Omaha, Nebraska) on July 5, 2008.

==The Race Club==

[[The Race Club]] is a swimming club founded by Hall and his father, [[Gary Hall Sr.]] The club, originally known as "The World Team," was designed to serve as a training group for elite swimmers across the world in preparation for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. To be able to train with the Race Club, one must either have been ranked in the top 20 in the world the past 3 calendar years or top 3 in their nation in the past year. The Race Club included such well known swimmers as [[Roland Mark Schoeman]], [[Mark Foster (swimmer)|Mark Foster]], [[Ryk Neethling]], Ricky Busquet and [[Therese Alshammar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theraceclub.net/mission-statement/history/world-team/|title=The World Team|work=The Race Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were coached by [[University of Michigan]] coach [[Mike Bottom]].

The Race Club offers various swimming camps, swim clinics, and swimming technique video recording year round for young swimmers at their [[Islamorada, Florida]]-based training center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theraceclub.net/swim-camps/|title=Swim Camps – The Race Club – Swimming Technique, Swimming Training Program, Florida Swim Camps, Summer Swim Camps|work=The Race Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Keys in life==

In the summer of 2006, Hall's sister, Bebe Hall, was attacked by a [[blacktip reef shark]] near [[Islamorada]], while she and Gary were [[spearfishing]], an attack for which Bebe Hall needed 19 [[Surgical suture|stitches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/athletes/athlete=521/bio/index.html|title=2008 nbcolympics.com bio |accessdate=July 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Hall repeatedly punched the shark and his sister shot a spear into it, after which the shark swam off.

==Personality==
Hall has long been one of competitive swimming's most colorful personalities. He often shadow-boxes before a race and is known for wearing a boxing robe in lieu of the usual warm-ups. The robe even earned Hall a fine during the 2004 Olympics, as the [[Everlast (boxing)|Everlast]]-made apparel broke the uniform supplying deal the team had  with [[Speedo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stars And Bars Everlast Robe Of Gary Hall Jr. Draws Fine|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2004/08/Issue-230/Olympics/Stars-And-Bars-Everlast-Robe-Of-Gary-Hall-Jr-Draws-Fine.aspx|publisher=''SportsBusiness Daily''|accessdate=3 January 2018|date=23 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; His eccentricity has won him a great deal of fans, but what some perceive to be "showboating" has drawn substantial criticism.  He is also an outspoken critic of performance-enhancing drug use in swimming, and is one of the few prominent swimmers willing to publicly question the legitimacy of suspected individual accomplishments.  In 2008, he compared [[International Swimming Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Amy Van Dyken]] to disgraced track &amp; field athlete [[Marion Jones]], noting they were both clients of the [[Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative]] (BALCO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vinton|first1=Nathaniel|title=Diabetic Olympian Gary Hall blasts dopers, while life depends on insulin|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/diabetic-olympian-gary-hall-blasts-dopers-life-depends-insulin-article-1.349585|publisher=''[[New York Daily News]]''|accessdate=3 January 2018|date=6 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Duval Buffett''' (November 19, 1928 &amp;ndash; October 13, 2012) was an American politician who was a Republican member of the [[New Mexico House of Representatives]] from 1979 to 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmlegis.gov/lcs/legislator_details_archive.aspx?SponsorCode=HBUFF New Mexico Legislature Senator George Buffett]&lt;/ref&gt; Buffett attended [[University of New Mexico]] and was a businessman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://votesmart.org/candidate/biography/8356/george-duval-buffett#.VEZsrYt4pk8 Votesmart-George Buffett]&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koat.com/news/new-mexico/albuquerque/Legendary-Buffett-s-founder-politician-dies/17002078 Legendary Buffett's founder and politician dies]&lt;/ref&gt; He was an arch-conservative state representative, owner of Buffett's Candy and cousin of [[Warren Buffett]].

George's interest in politics stemmed from his uncle, congressman [[Howard Homan Buffett]]. He attended the [[Republican National Convention 1952]] in Chicago. He served as a State Representative for 24 years (1979-2002). He was a fiscal conservative. He started writing a political newsletter, called Buffett's Bullets, to educate and to provide insight into the inner workings of politics in NM from 1989 through 2008 and had a mailing list that grew from 150 to over 10,000 people from across the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffettsbullets.com/ Buffett's Bullets]&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as the Republican National Committeeman for the State of NM for four years (2004-2008) and he again attended the [[Republican National Convention 2008]] in Minneapolis.

George founded B&amp;H Company in 1952, which ran concessions at various fiestas and fairs across the state. This business also ran the concessions at the ABQ Zoo for 16 years, the concessions at Speedway Park, the concessions at the Civic Auditorium and the concessions at the ABQ Dukes for 18 years. This business grew into B&amp;H Wholesale, which supplies other concessionaires, their products and currently distributes across the state of NM and into parts of AZ, CO, OK, TX and UT. In 1956, George founded Buffett's Candies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffettscandies.com/about.php Buffett's Candies]&lt;/ref&gt; George founded also the Popcorn Cannery, which produces and distributes pre-popped and flavored popcorn to grocery stores in ABQ.

'''Sir Henry James "Jack" Tucker''' (14 March 1903 &amp;ndash; 9 January 1986) was the first [[Premiers of Bermuda|Government Leader]] of [[Bermuda]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Sir Henry Tucker Dies at 82; Was First Leader of Bermuda |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE6DD173FF932A25752C0A960948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon= |work= [[Reuters]] |publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=1986-01-11 |accessdate=2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered — together with Dr. [[E. F. Gordon]] (1895 &amp;ndash; 1955) - one of the island's two most important leaders of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Gazette&gt;[http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20110616/ISLAND11/706149916/-1 "Sir Henry Tucker - one of the Island's two most important leaders of the 20th Century", ''Royal Gazette'', 16 June 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bermudabiographies.bm/Bios/bio-HenryTucker.html Bermuda Biographies.]&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker first took office on 10 June 1968 and served until 29 December 1971, as a member of the [[United Bermuda Party]] (UBP), the [[political party]] that he helped found in 1964.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Early life==
Henry Tucker was born in Bermuda on 14 March 1903, the son of merchant Henry James and Nella Louise (born Trott).&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He was a direct descendant of the first British settlers in Bermuda, who included Daniel Tucker, an early [[Governor of Bermuda|Bermudian colonial governor]] in 1616.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Bermuda's Trott family descend from famous 17th Century settler [[Perient Trott]] (1614-1679), who led the campaign against the [[Somers Isles Company]] that would lead to its dissolution in 1684.

Tucker was educated at [[Whitney Institute Middle School|Whitney Institute]] and at [[Saltus Grammar School]] in [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]], before being sent at the age of 17, in 1920, to boarding school in [[England]], where he attended [[Sherborne School]] in [[Dorset]]. Lacking the means to pursue university studies, he returned to Bermuda in 1922 to find work.&lt;ref name=Gazette/&gt;

Tucker moved to [[New York City]], where from 1924 until 1934 he worked for several [[bank]]s and [[brokerage firm|stock brokerages]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Returning to Bermuda, he became an employee of the [[Bank of Bermuda]]. He was promoted to general manager in 1938.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; On his retirement in 1969 he was elected Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Bermuda, and would serve in this capacity until 1985.&lt;ref name=Bank&gt;[http://bermudascholarships.com/donor/Bank-of-Bermuda-Foundation/9 Bank Of Bermuda Foundation Sir Henry Tucker University Scholarship], bermudascholarships.com; accessed 19 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
In 1938 Tucker was elected to Parliament as a representative in [[Paget Parish|Paget]].&lt;ref name=Gazette/&gt; 
Tucker was elected to the [[Bermuda House of Assembly]] in the 1950s. He helped found the United Bermuda Party in 1964, after spending almost 20 years in the Assembly.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He immediately became the UBP's leader. Tucker became Bermuda's first Premier in 1968, after the island's first election with [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Tucker resigned from office in 1971, citing his advancing age.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He was [[knight]]ed by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Famous quote:

==Death==
Sir Henry Tucker died in Bermuda on 9 January 1986 at the age of 82. He is survived by two of his children, Robert Newbold Tucker, who currently lives in Bermuda, and daughter Judy Denney, who currently lives in Texas.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

An '''intellectual property infringement''' is the infringement or violation of an [[intellectual property right]]. There are several types of intellectual property rights, such as [[copyright]]s, [[patent]]s, and [[trademark]]s. Therefore, an intellectual property infringement may for instance be one of the following:

* [[Copyright infringement]]
* [[Patent infringement]]
* [[Trademark infringement]]

Techniques to detect (or deter) intellectual property infringement include:
* [[Fictitious entry]], such as:
** Fictitious dictionary entry. An example is ''[[Esquivalience]]'' included in the New Oxford American Dictionary (NOAD)
** [[Trap street]], a fictitious street included on a map for the purpose of "trapping" potential copyright violators of the map
* [[Watermark (disambiguation)|Watermarking]]

[[Designing around]] a patent may in some cases constitute a way to avoid infringing it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7827">Sir '''James Drax''' (d. 1662) was a [[Barbados]] plantation owner who accumulated extraordinary wealth as a pioneer of the sugar trade in the English colonies. The Caribbean sugar plantations established by James Drax and those who followed his example would be at the epicenter of the growing British and French empires, helping to fuel economic growth and imperial expansion.

== Early Life and migration ==

James Drax was the son of William Drax, a gentleman of the village of Finham, in the parish of Stoneleigh, Warwickshire.&lt;ref&gt;George W. Marshall, ed., ''La Neve’s Pedigrees of the Knights Made by King Charles II., King James II, King William III. and Queen Mary, King William Alone, and Queen Anne,'' Publications of the Harleian Society, 8 (1873), 76-77; John Mathews and George F. Mathews, eds., ''Abstract of the Probate Acts in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury,'' Year Books of Probates, Vol. 1, Part 2 (London, 1902), 145.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1620s, James Drax became one of the earliest English migrants to the island of Barbados: he and his companions arrived and lived for a time in a cave, hunting for provisions, and clearing land for the planting of tobacco, which soon became the staple crop of the island.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome S. Handler, “Father Antoine Biet’s Visit to Barbados in 1654,” ''Journal of the Barbados Museum and Historical Society,'' 32 (1967), 69&lt;/ref&gt;  Drax later claimed that he had arrived with a stock of no more than £300, and that he intended to stay on the island until he had parlayed that initial investment into a landed fortune worth £10,000 a year back home.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ligon, ''A True and Exact History of the Island of Barbados'' (1657), 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
== Sugar planter ==

By the late 1630s, Drax had accumulated a substantial portion of land on Barbados, together with his brother William Drax.  Owing to a slump in tobacco prices, the late 1630s saw considerable economic difficulty in England’s fledgling colonies in the Caribbean, and colonists began to turn to other crops.  According to tradition, Drax was one of the pioneers of the introduction of sugar to the island, and was reportedly the first planter successfully to cultivate sugar cane on a large scale.  Drax allegedly relied heavily on Dutch expertise, learning the craft of sugar production and refinement from a Dutch settler, and then importing equipment from Holland.&lt;ref&gt;P.F. Campbell, ''Some Early Barbadian History'' (St. Michael, 1993), 239, 248; Thomas Dalby, ''An Historical Account of the Rise and Growth of the West-India Colonies'' (1690), 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;  While these reports were recorded much later, and while the contribution of the Dutch is disputed, it is likely that at least some of the capital and techniques of production deployed in the early Barbados sugar trade came from the Dutch, who in turn had acquired their know-how and experience in the trade from Portuguese Brazil (which had been partially seized by the Netherlands in 1630).  Sources indicate that the early experiments of Drax and others Barbados settlers began c. 1640, and there was certainly sugar arriving in London from the island by 1643.  Barbados quickly became a major supplier for Europe, and by the mid-1650s, sugar production had largely supplanted tobacco and all other crops as the dominant economic activity of the island.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Dale Gragg, ''Englishmen Transplanted: The English Colonization of Barbados, 1627-1660'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003), 99-112.&lt;/ref&gt;
== Slavery ==

Concurrent with the rise of sugar came large-scale and intensive exploitation of slave labor, and here too Drax was a notorious pioneer.  Prior to 1640, the primary source of labor in Barbados had been European indentured servants.  Although there were African slaves in Barbados before this point, it was only after 1640, and frequently in tandem with the cultivation of sugar, that slave labor began to supplant indentured servitude as the chief mode of production.  Drax was deeply involved in this transition, acquiring 22 slaves in early 1642, just as he was getting involved in sugar.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''Some Early Barbadian History,'' 99.&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1644, he purchased another 34 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Bridenbaugh and Roberta Bridenbaugh, ''No Peace Beyond the Line: The English in the Caribbean, 1624-1690'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1972), 78.&lt;/ref&gt;   By the early 1650s, his huge estate was manned by some 200 slaves of African descent.&lt;ref&gt;Handler, ''Biet's Visit,'' 69&lt;/ref&gt;   The model of intensive slave labor, organized into work gangs, and disciplined through ubiquitous violence, also quickly spread through the Caribbean, going hand-in-hand with sugar production.

== Fortune and knighthood ==

Drax profited spectacularly from his sugar enterprise, allowing him to live “like a prince.”&lt;ref&gt;Ligon, ''Barbados,'' 34.&lt;/ref&gt;  With wealth and power came political controversy.  He emerged during the 1640s as a key supporter of parliament during the civil war raging in England, and became a colonel in the island’s militia.  As a result, when a royalist faction seized control of Barbados in 1650, James and William Drax were exiled from the island, along with other prominent parliamentarians.  They returned to London, where they lobbied the House of Commons to send an expedition to retake the island.  In 1651, Drax sailed in the fleet designed to re-conquer Barbados, and he was part of the team that went ashore to negotiate the surrender of the island.&lt;ref&gt;N. Darnell Davis, ''The Cavaliers and Roundheads of Barbados, 1650-1652'' (Georgetown: Argosy, 1887), 145-149, 178, 190.&lt;/ref&gt;  Restored to his estates and power, Drax once again took up a leading role in the governance of the colony.  It is thought that [[Drax Hall Estate|Drax Hall]], the impressive seventeenth-century manor house in St. George parish Barbados, was built by him and his brother during the 1650s.  He also played a role as patron of explorers of the North American coast, including [[Robert Sandford (explorer)|Robert Sandford]].&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Sarah, "Power in the English Caribbean: the Proprietorship of Lord Willoughby of Parham" in Roper, LH and Van Ruymbeke, B. “Constructing Early Modern Empires: Proprietary Ventures in the Atlantic World, 1500-1750, Leiden: Brill 2007 p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; In 1658, Drax was rewarded for his loyalty with a knighthood from the Lord Protector, [[Oliver Cromwell]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Noble, ''Memoirs of the Protectoral-House of Cromwell,'' 2 vols.

In the 1830s, the land which is now Montgomery Street lay at the edge of [[San Francisco Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist1/early.html|title=San Francisco – Before the Gold Rush – 1847|accessdate=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OHP&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=21482|title=Office of Historic Preservation: San Francisco|accessdate=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intense [[land speculation]] during the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] created a demand for more usable land in the rapidly growing city, and sandy bluffs near the waterfront were leveled and the shallows filled with sand (and the ruins of many ships) to make new building lots. Between 1849 and 1852, the waterfront advanced about four blocks.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:1853 U.S.C.S. Map of San Francisco, California ^ Vicinity - Geographicus - SanFrancisco3-uscs-1853.jpg|City of San Francisco and its Vicinity California (Map, 1853)]]&lt;/ref&gt; At present, Montgomery Street is about seven blocks from the water.

The corner of Montgomery and Clay is where [[John B. Montgomery]] landed when he came to hoist the [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]] after the [[Bear Flag Revolt]] of 1846. In 1853 the [[Montgomery Block]], a center of early San Francisco law and literature, was built at 600 Montgomery, on land currently occupied by the [[Transamerica Pyramid]].&lt;ref name=OHP /&gt;

'''Norma Hason Nahmias Yaeger''' (born May 5, 1930) is an entrepreneur, stockbroker, business pioneer, and published author. In 1962, she became the first woman to enroll in Hornblower &amp; Weeks, Inc. training program for stockbrokers. She is the first woman who demanded, and got, the right to join her male trainees on the floor of the [[New York Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;Natural Born Coaches Website:http://www.naturalborncoaches.com/podcasts/episode-235-norma-yaeger//&lt;/ref&gt; The Stock Exchange did not previously allow women to set foot on its floor. Norma Nahmias was the only woman invited to be on Hornblower &amp; Weeks’ Management Advisory Board. She registered with the Liquidity Fund with the SEC; it was the first Money Market Mutual Fund in California. Norma Yaeger registered and opened a full-service [[stock brokerage]] firm, Yaeger Securities, Inc., in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Broadwayworld, Website:http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwbooks/article/Norma-Yaeger-Releases-BREAKING-DOWN-THE-WALLS-20130723/&lt;/ref&gt;
When the Affirmative Action Bill AB-1933 passed in 1989, she started a second brokerage firm, Yaeger Capital Markets, which she opened in 1991. Her numerous licenses include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), National Association of Security Dealers (NASD), Chicago Board of Options, and the Commodity Exchange. She spends a lot of her time giving lectures to empower and encourage women. Breaking Down the Walls, the memoir of her years as a Wall Street and business pioneer, is her first book, published in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Amazon, Website:https://www.amazon.com/Breaking-Down-Walls-Courageous-Successful/dp/0985746815/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
Norma Hason studied at the [[City College of New York]], Bernard Baruch’s College of Business and at '''The New York Institute of Finance'''.

==Early life==
Norma Hason was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, and is of Sephardic Jewish descent. She married her high school sweetheart, Sam Nahmias, with whom she has three children. Her husband moved the family into a house in the Catskill Mountains of New York, and when her husband lost his job, they returned to NYC. It was necessary for Norma to be the one working in their family. At that time, Norma started to imagine her life differently. She wanted to provide for her family and started to dream of a life in which she could be financially independent of her spouse; she dreamed of becoming a [[stockbroker]].&lt;ref&gt;IYMONEY, Issue 10, Website:http://www.iymoney.com/norma-yaeger-triumph-for-womens-movement///&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1962, Norma Nahmias (marital last name), became the first woman to enroll in Hornblower &amp; Weeks, Inc.’s training program for stockbrokers. As a trainee, she demanded and got equal pay for equal work. She also demanded and got the right to join her male trainees on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Also as a Registered Representative of Hornblower &amp; Weeks, she was the only woman on their Management Advisory Board&lt;ref&gt;http://stephlwagner.com/blog/interview-with-norma-yaeger/#.V25lUa4td_s//&lt;/ref&gt;/After a divorce and her remarriage to Lawrence Yaeger, a general surgeon, she moved to Los Angeles, California. To further expand her career, she opened her own firm, Yaeger Securities, in 1981. She also registered the first Money Market Mutual Fund in California, The Liquidity Fund.&lt;ref&gt;http://brokercheck.finra.org/Individual/474295/&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Affirmative Action Bill passed in 1989, she started a second brokerage firm, Yaeger Capital Markets, in 1991, to service government Pension Plans. Already at the time, her licenses included the [[New York Stock Exchange]](NYSE), National Association of Security Dealers (NASD), Chicago Board of Options, and the [[Commodity Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;http://womentakingthelead.com/norma-yaeger//&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Panic: The Story of Modern Financial Insanity''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]] about the most important and severe upheavals in past financial history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7182861-panic|publisher=[[goodreads.com]]|title=Panic: The Story of Modern Financial Insanity|accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published on November 2, 2009 by [[W.

==Reception==
{{quote|The Age of Financial Unreason began with the 1987 stock market crash, according to Michael Lewis, author of the bestselling Liar's Poker, who was a bond salesman in London at the time: "It was striking how little control we had of events, particularly in view of how assiduously we cultivated the appearance of being in charge by smoking big cigars and saying fuck all the time." All of the major modern panics are here, including the Asian currency crisis and Russia's financial meltdown, but the best essays are about Black Monday, the internet bubble (when a company merely had to announce it had a new website for its stocks to rise 973%) and the dreaded sub-prime mortgage disaster. Some of it is dry stuff, unless you thrill to talk of structured investment vehicles or master-liquidity enhancement conduits, but there is a helpful glossary for those who can't tell a bear from a bull. Computerised global capitalism leads to faster booms and busts, Lewis says, but it isn't the end of the world, so try not to panic.}}

Concerning Russian economic reform in the early 1990s, he and other reformer colleagues had consulted with foreign academics by 1990 on trying to find a new system. When [[Boris Yeltsin]] became president, he appointed Aven with the task of making the ruble convertible and finding a solution to foreign debt.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yale.edu/2017/11/13/aven-offers-inside-account-making-modern-russia&lt;/ref&gt; Aven went on to become the Minister of Foreign Economic Relations for the Russian Federation (1991–1992), serving as [[Russia]]'s representative to the [[G7|Group of Seven]] and conducting a number of high-level trade and economic missions to Western capitals. In 1993 he joined the [[Democratic Choice of Russia|Russia's Choice]] movement and was a candidate for State Duma.

In October 1994, Aven met [[Alfa Group]]'s [[Mikhail Fridman]], and soon became an Alfa Bank shareholder serving as a member of the Supervisory Board of the Alfa Group Consortium. From 1994 until June 2011, he served as the President of [[Alfa-Bank]] Russia. Currently Aven is a Member of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Board of Directors of ABH Holdings S.A.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alfabank.com/governance/board/aven/ Petr Aven profile.] Alfa-Bank Board of Directors.

The L1 Group owns companies – and has equity investments in companies – with operations in 32 countries around the world.

LetterOne acquired assets from German utility business E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5899">'''Pier Francesco Guarguaglini''' (born 1937 in [[Tuscany]], Italy) is an Italian engineer, university educator and businessman. He is best known for his nine-year term (2002–2011) as chairman of [[Finmeccanica]] (since 2017 Leonardo), a partly state-owned Italian aerospace and defence conglomerate.

==Biography==
Guarguaglini was born in Tuscany in 1937. He studied electrical engineering at the [[University of Pisa]] and Collegio Pacinotti of [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]] (present day [[Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies]]), then received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

Gargauglini began his career as an assistant lecturer in nuclear electronics at the University of Pisa. He later became an assistant lecturer in radar systems at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]], remaining there for 15 years. He also worked for nearly 20 years at Italian electronics firm [[Alenia Aeronautica|Selenia]] in various managerial positions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com] ''Pier Francesco Guarguaglini Bio'', google books (website)&lt;/ref&gt;

His various industry positions include general manager, and later chief executive officer, of Officine Galileo (1984–94); a managing director of Oto Melara and Breda Meccanica Bresciana (1994–96); head of Finmeccanica Defence Consortium (1996–99); chairman of the board of directors of Alenia Marconi Systems (1998–2000); chief executive officer of Fincantiere SPA and Cantieri Navali Itaniani (Italy's largest shipbuilding consortium)(1999–2002).

In 2002 Guarguaglini returned to Finmeccanica, being named to the posts of chief executive officer and president on 24 April.

While at Finmeccanica, he also remained busy elsewhere. He was an independent lecturer at the University of Rome, and was named an independent director of [[Eutelsat]] Communications on 26 July 2007. He sat on the counsels of [[Confindustria]], and AECMA (European Association of Aerospace Industries, later changed to AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe).&lt;ref&gt;[http://executivepeoples.com/pier-francesco-guarguaglini/] ''Pier Francesco Guarguaglini'', Executive People Biography (website)&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), and served as a member of the IEEE board representing the United States and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;google books&lt;/ref&gt;

Gargauglini received an Honorary Doctorate from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 2010 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.hw.ac.uk/ppr/docs/network-winter-2010.pdf|title=Honorary Graduates 2010|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412085029/http://www1.hw.ac.uk/ppr/docs/network-winter-2010.pdf|archivedate=2016-04-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Departure from Finmeccanica==
Guarguaglini had been nominated to head the Finmeccanica group by the Italian Finance Ministry, which holds some 30 percent of the company's stock. He was considered extremely successful in restoring the company's position in the worldwide industry - under his direction, Finmeccanica gained full control of European helicopter company [[AgustaWestland]] in 2004, and used that control to win the competition to provide [[Marine One|helicopter transportation for the President of the United States]] in 2005. Partly in recognition of this success, US industry magazine [[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]] named him its 2005 Person Of The Year.&lt;ref&gt;Person of the Year 2005-2012, ''Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology'', 14 January 2013 issue, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; He gained a greater foothold in the US aviation electronics market by purchasing the US electronics fabricator DRS Technologies Inc. in 2008.

By 2009, Italian investigators were looking into bribery charges that had been leveled at several Italian companies. They tried to determine whether executives at one of Finmeccanica's divisions, Selex Sistemi Integrati, had inflated the value of contracts with an air-traffic manager, then used the resulting funds to bribe various politicians. That division was managed by Guarguaglini's wife, Marina Grossi. By early 2011 the government (as represented by Prime Minister [[Mario Monti]]) was convinced that a top-to-bottom shakeout of Finmeccanica management was necessary, and in April 2011 they brought in Giuseppi Orsi (born 1945) to replace Guarguaglini as chief executive officer. Guarguaglini retained responsibility for company strategy, acquisitions, asset sales, and government relations.

The dual-manager situation proved difficult, however, and on 1 December 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scandal at Finmeccanica Revives Questions in Italy|first=Elisabetta|last=Provoledo|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/01/business/global/scandal-at-finmeccanica-revives-questions-in-italy.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guarguaglini held a showdown with the board of directors in an attempt to more clearly define the division of responsibilities between the two managers. Unable to achieve his desired goad, he submitted his resignation effective immediately. It was accepted, and he received a 4.5 million-euro payout on his remaining contract, with another 1.5 million-euro payment at the end of a one-year non-compete agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-01/finmeccanica-s-guarguaglini-faces-showdown-with-board-amid-probe.html] Finmeccanica Chairman Guarguaglini Resigns Amid Probe; Orsi Assumes Role, ''Bloomberg News'', 1 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2014, Guarguaglini was placed under house arrest in connection with the Sistri bribery probe.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thelocal.it/20140630/ex-finmeccanica-chief-arrested-in-bribery-probe&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ramón Tamayo worked as a producer for nearly three decades in the Lope de Vega company, founded by his brother Joseph Tamayo in 1946,&lt;ref name=Torres&gt;{{cite news|last=Torres|first=Rosana|title=Ramón Tamayo, productor teatral (English: Ramón Tamayo, Theatre producer) (in Spanish)|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/Necrologicas/Ramon/Tamayo/productor/teatral/elpepinec/20080624elpepinec_4/Tes|accessdate=29 June 2012|newspaper=El País|date=24 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with which he toured the Spanish territory making known the new generation of foreign authors during the Franco regime.

He directed the National Drama Centre between 1979 and 1981 along with actors [[Nuria Espert]] and [[José Luis Gómez (actor)|José Luis Gómez]]. While the latter two were responsible for art direction, Tamayo took care of the inner workings, management and production.&lt;ref name=Esteban&gt;{{cite news|last=Esteban|first=Rafael|title=Ramón Tamayo, empresario y productor teatral (English: Ramón Tamayo, Businessman and theatre producer) (in Spanish)|url= http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/06/24/obituarios/1214301147.html|accessdate=29 June 2012|newspaper=El Mundo|date=24 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his tenure, the center hosted around twenty shows such as ''Los baños de Argel'' (The Algiers baths), directed by Francisco Nieva; ''La velada en Benicarl,'' (Vigil in Benicarl) directed by ( Manuel Azaña).

With other companies he produced ''Sueño de una noche de verano'' (Dream of a summer's night), from  Lindsay Kemp as well as debutting other plays in a national theater -  the Theatre Lliure and the Els Joglars.&lt;ref name=Torres&gt;{{cite news|last=Torres|first=Rosana|title=Ramón Tamayo, productor teatral (English: Ramón Tamayo, Theatre producer) (in Spanish)|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/Necrologicas/Ramon/Tamayo/productor/teatral/elpepinec/20080624elpepinec_4/Tes|accessdate=29 June 2012|newspaper=El País|date=24 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After a stint in the public theater, Tamayo returned to the private, back to the Lope de Vega company and the Fine Arts Theatre, where he directed with his brother until 2003, when his brother died. Ramón Tamayo died five years later in Madrid at the age of 87 years.&lt;ref name="Diario Ideal"&gt;{{cite news|last=Diario Ideal|title=Muere a los 87 años Ramón Tamayo, ex director del Centro Dramático Nacional (English: Ramón Tamayo, former director of the National Dramatic Center dies at 87 years of age) (in Spanish)|url= http://www.ideal.es/granada/20080624/cultura/muere-anos-ramon-tamayo-20080624.html|accessdate=29 June 2012|newspaper=Agencias Diario Ideal|date=24 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Earl Caves''' (born 1 November 1931, [[Akron, Ohio]]) is an American economist, and Emeritus Professor of Economics at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| URL=http://economics.harvard.edu/people/richard-caves |title=Richard E Caves |publisher=Harvard.edu |accessdate=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his work on Multinational enterprises,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lundvall, Bengt-Åke]], ed. ''National systems of innovation: Toward a theory of innovation and interactive learning.'' Vol. 2. Anthem Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; on industrial organization,&lt;ref&gt;Shane, Scott, and Sankaran Venkataraman. "The promise of entrepreneurship as a field of research." ''Academy of management review'' 25.1 (2000): 217-226.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the creative industries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott, W. Richard]]. ''Institutions and organizations: Ideas and interests.'' Sage, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He is known within the motion pictures economics field as the author of a definitive book on the organization of the creative industries titled, ''Creative Industries: Contracts Between Art and Commerce.''{{cn|date=January 2017}}

== Education and academic career ==
Caves obtained his BA in economics at [[Oberlin College]] in 1953. He continued his studies at [[Harvard University]], where he obtained his MA in economics in 1956, and his PhD in 1958.&lt;ref name="CR 1974"&gt;Richard E. Caves, Marc J. Roberts, Brookings Institution (1974). ''Regulating the product: quality and variety.'' p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JS 2007"&gt;H. W. de Jong, William G. Shepherd (2007) ''Pioneers of Industrial Organization: How the Economics of Competition and Monopoly Took Shape.'' p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Caves started his academic career at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in the department of [[Joe S. Bain]]. In 1962 he moved back to Harvard University, where he was appointed Professor of Economics and lectured in industrial organization and international trade.&lt;ref name="CR 1974"/&gt; He served as Department Chairman from 1966 to 1969 and Chairman of the Ph.D in Business Economics from 1984 to 1997, and was also the George Gund Professor of Economics and Business Administration from 1986 to 1997, and subsequently the Nathaniel Ropes Research Professor of Political Economy, from 1997 on. He retired at Harvard in 2003, and became Emeritus Professor of Economics.&lt;ref name="JS 2007"/&gt; He also sat on the editorial board of the ''[[Review of Economics and Statistics]]'' from 1992 to 1996.

==Consulting work==
Caves has acted as a Consultant on various topics to various bodies. He was an adviser on international monetary problems for the [[US Council of Economic Advisers]] in 1961, and deputy to the Special Assistant to the President on foreign trade policy in the same year. From 1963-4 he was a member of the Review Committee for Balance of Payments Statistics at the US Bureau of the Budget, (also known as the Bernstein Committee). In 1964 he was also a member of the White House Task Force on Foreign Economic Policy. From 1972-3 he acted as a consultant to the [[Council of Ontario Universities]], and from 1975-6 he was a consultant to the [[Royal Commission on Corporate Concentration]].{{cn|date=January 2017}}

==Contributions to Creative Industries==
{{BLP sources section|date=January 2017}}
Caves specializes in industrial and political economics, having authored several books on industrial efficiency, productivity, and competition. Using this background, Caves provides new insight into the economics of the artistic and creative endeavor. In his book, ''Creative Industries:  Contracts Between Art and Commerce'', Caves looks at the visual and performing arts, cinema and television, sound recordings, book publishing, and toys and games to investigate how the theory of contracts and the logic of economic organization affect the production of "simple creative goods" and more "complex goods" like plays or motion pictures, which require teams of artists with diverse talents.

Under Caves' scrutiny, art collectors and moviegoers are consumers; gallery owners are "gatekeepers"; and critics are "certifiers."

Sociologist [[Paul DiMaggio]] commented that the book:

::promises to be a much-needed touchstone for work in cultural economics, the sociology of art and culture, and the interdisciplinary field of arts and cultural policy analysis.::

The '''Rockefeller Foundation''' is a [[private foundation]] based at 420 Fifth Avenue, New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=210269|title=Company Overview of The Rockefeller Foundation|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established by the six-generation [[Rockefeller family]]. The Foundation was started by [[Standard Oil]] owner [[John D. Rockefeller]] ("Senior"), along with his son [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] ("Junior"), and Senior's principal oil and gas business and philanthropic advisor, [[Frederick Taylor Gates]], in [[New York State]] on May 14, 1913, when its charter was formally accepted by the New York State Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/uploads/files/812e6b1a-4785-4d58-b2e3-77eb3f5a2b0d-1913-1914.pdf|title=Research Library – The Rockefeller Foundation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its stated mission is "promoting the well-being of humanity throughout the world."&lt;ref name="rockefellerfoundation.org"/&gt;

==Leadership==
On January 5, 2017, the board of trustees announced the unanimous selection of [[Rajiv Shah|Dr. Rajiv Shah]] to serve as the 13th president of the foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://venturesafrica.com/a-former-usaid-administrator-becomes-the-thirteenth-rockefeller-foundations-president/|title=A former USAID administrator becomes the thirteenth president of the Rockefeller Foundation – Ventures Africa|date=2017-01-10|work=Ventures Africa|access-date=2018-01-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shah became the youngest person, at 43,&lt;ref&gt;Gelles, David, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/business/rockefeller-foundation-rajiv-shah.html “Rockefeller Foundation Picks Rajiv J.

==Beginnings==
[[File:Rflogo1.jpg|thumb|Original Rockefeller logo, no longer in use]]
Rockefeller's interest in philanthropy and [[Public Relations]] began in 1904, influenced by [[Ida Tarbell]]'s book published about Standard Oil crimes, ''[[The History of the Standard Oil Company]]'', which prompted him to whitewash the Rockefeller image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/biography/rockefellers-tarbell/| title=The Rockefellers| station=[[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]| series=[[American Experience]]| network=[[PBS]]| air-date=October 16, 2000| access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

His initial idea to set up a large-scale foundation occurred in 1901, but it was not until 1906 that Senior's famous business and philanthropic advisor, [[Frederick Taylor Gates]], seriously revived the idea, saying that Rockefeller's fortune was rolling up so fast his heirs would "dissipate their inheritances or become intoxicated with power", unless he set up "permanent corporate philanthropies for the good of Mankind".&lt;ref name=Titan&gt;{{cite book| quote=''As early as 1901, Rockefeller had realized he needed to create a foundation on a scale that dwarfed anything he had done so far...''| first=Ron| last=Chernow| title=Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.| location=New York| publisher=Random House| date=May 5, 1998| pages=563–566| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mleb5acWQF4C&amp;q=rockefeller+foundation#v=onepage&amp;q=foundation&amp;f=false| isbn=978-0679438083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also in 1906 that the [[Russell Sage Foundation]] was established, though its program was limited to working women and social ills.  Rockefeller's would thus not be the first foundation in America ([[Benjamin Franklin]] was the first to introduce the concept), but it brought to it unprecedented international scale and scope. In 1909 he signed over 73,000 shares of [[Standard Oil]] of New Jersey, valued at $50 million, to the three inaugural trustees, Junior, Gates and [[Harold Fowler McCormick]], the first installment of a projected $100 million endowment.&lt;ref name=Titan/&gt;

They applied for a federal [[charter]] for the foundation in the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] in 1910, with at one stage Junior even secretly meeting with President [[William Howard Taft]], through the aegis of Senator [[Nelson Aldrich]], to hammer out concessions.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} However, because of the ongoing (1911) antitrust suit against Standard Oil at the time, along with deep suspicion in some quarters of undue Rockefeller influence on the spending of the endowment, the end result was that Senior and Gates withdrew the bill from Congress in order to seek a state charter.&lt;ref name=Titan/&gt;

On May 14, 1913, New York Governor [[William Sulzer]] approved a state charter for the foundation – two years after the [[Carnegie Corporation]] – with Junior becoming the first president. With its large-scale endowment, a large part of Senior's fortune was insulated from inheritance taxes. The total benefactions of both him and Junior and their philanthropies in the end would far surpass Carnegie's endowments, his biographer [[Ron Chernow]] states, ranking Rockefeller as "the greatest philanthropist in American history."&lt;ref name=Titan/&gt;

==Early grants and connections==
The first secretary of the foundation was [[Jerome Davis Greene]], the former secretary of [[Harvard University]], who wrote a "memorandum on principles and policies" for an early meeting of the trustees that established a rough framework for the foundation's work. On December 5, the Board made its first grant of $100,000 to the [[American Red Cross]] to purchase property for its headquarters in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=history1913&gt;Rockfound.org, [http://www.rockfound.org/about_us/history/1913_1919.shtml history, 1913–1919] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523123616/http://www.rockfound.org/about_us/history/1913_1919.shtml |date=2007-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning the foundation was global in its approach and concentrated in its first decade entirely on the sciences, public health and medical education.

It was initially located within the [[family office]] at [[Standard Oil]]'s headquarters at [[26 Broadway]], later (in 1933) shifting to the [[GE Building]] (then [[RCA]]), along with the newly named family office, ''Room 5600'', at [[Rockefeller Center]]; later it moved to the [[Time-Life Building]] in the Center, before shifting to its current [[Fifth Avenue]] address.

In 1913 the foundation set up the [[International Health Commission]] (later Board), the first appropriation of funds for work outside the US, which launched the foundation into international public health activities. This expanded the work of the [[Rockefeller Sanitary Commission|Sanitary Commission]] worldwide, working against various diseases in fifty-two countries on six continents and twenty-nine islands, bringing international recognition of the need for public health and environmental sanitation. Its early field research on [[hookworm]], [[malaria]], and [[yellow fever]] provided the basic techniques to control these diseases and established the pattern of modern public health services.&lt;ref&gt;Randall M. Packard, A History of Global Health, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2016 (p. 32–43)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission established and endowed the world's first school of Hygiene and Public Health, at [[Johns Hopkins University]], and later at Harvard, and then spent more than $25 million in developing other public health schools in the US and in 21 foreign countries – helping to establish America as the world leader in medicine and scientific research. In 1913 it also began a 20-year support program of the ''Bureau of Social Hygiene'', whose mission was research and education on birth control, maternal health and sex education.

===Europe===
In the interwar years, the Foundation's support of public health, nursing, and social work in Eastern and Central Europe was a concentrated effort to advance medicine and create a global network of medical research.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin B. Page, "The Rockefeller Foundation and Central Europe: A Reconsideration." ''Minerva'' 40#3 (2002): 265–287.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the war, it sent a team to West Germany to investigate how it could become involved in reconstructing the country. They focused on restoring democracy, especially regarding education and scientific research, with the long-term goal of reintegrating Germany to the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;Carola Sachse, "What research, to what end? The Rockefeller Foundat  on and the Max Planck Gesellschaft in the early cold war." ''Central European History'' 42#1 (2009): 97–141. [https://www.academia.edu/download/36836775/BloodandHomeland.pdf#page=12 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===China Medical Board===

In 1914, the foundation set up the ''[[China Medical Board]]'', which established the first public health university in China, the ''[[Peking Union Medical College]]'', in 1921; this was subsequently nationalised when the Communists took over the country in 1949. In the same year it began a program of international fellowships to train scholars at the world's leading universities at the [[Post-doctoral|post-doctoral level]]; a fundamental commitment to the education of future leaders.

===Department of Industrial Relations===

Also in 1914, the trustees set up a new Department of Industrial Relations, inviting [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] to head it. He became a close and key advisor to Junior through the [[Ludlow Massacre]], turning around his attitude to [[Labor unions in the United States|unions]]; however the foundation's involvement in IR was criticized for advancing the family's business interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Seim| first=David L.| date=June 1, 2013| title=Rockefeller Philanthropy and Modern Social Science| location=London| publisher=Pickering &amp; Chatto| pages=81–89| isbn=978-1848933910}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation henceforth confined itself to funding responsible organizations involved in this and other controversial fields, which were beyond the control of the foundation itself.&lt;ref&gt;Foundation withdrew from direct involvement in Industrial Relations – see Robert Shaplen, ''Toward the Well-Being of Mankind: Fifty Years of the Rockefeller Foundation'', New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., 1964, (p.128)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychiatry===

During the late-1920s, the Rockefeller Foundation created the Medical Sciences Division, which emerged from the former Division of Medical Education. The division was led by Dr. Richard M. Pearce until his death in 1930, to which Alan Gregg to succeeded him until 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/FS/p-nid/214|title=The Alan Gregg Papers: Director of Medical Sciences, 1930–1945|website=profiles.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the Division of Medical Sciences was known for making large contributions to research across several fields of psychiatry. The 1930s was one of the most prominent decades in Rockefeller Foundation philanthropy to psychiatric research, as the foundation set a goal to find, train, and encourage scholars for research and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Rockefeller Foundation, "The Strategy of Our Program in Psychiatry" (The Rockefeller Foundation, November 1, 1937), RG 3.1, series 906, box 2, folder 17, Rockefeller Archive Center, page 1, https://rockfound.rockarch.org/digital-library-listing/-/asset_publisher/yYxpQfeI4W8N/content/the-strategy-of-our-program-in-psychiatry&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first large contributions from the Foundation to psychiatric research was in 1935, with the appropriation of $100000 to the Institute for Psychoanalysis in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Brown, Alan Gregg and the Rockefeller Foundation's Support of Franz Alexander's Psychosomatic Research, ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'' (1987): 155–182&lt;/ref&gt; This grant was renewed in 1938, with payments extending into the early-1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Rockefeller Foundation, "Annual Report, 1938," Governance Report, The Rockefeller Foundation: Annual Report (New York, NY, USA: The Rockefeller Foundation, 1939), 171, https://assets.rockefellerfoundation.org/app/uploads/20150530122134/Annual-Report-1938.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social sciences===

Through the ''Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial'' (LSRM), established by Senior in 1918 and named after his wife, the Rockefeller fortune was for the first time directed to supporting research by social scientists. During its first few years of work, the LSRM awarded funds primarily to social workers, with its funding decisions guided primarily by Junior. In 1922, Beardsley Ruml was hired to direct the LSRM, and he most decisively shifted the focus of Rockefeller philanthropy into the [[social science]]s, stimulating the founding of university research centers, and creating the [[Social Science Research Council]]. In January 1929, LSRM funds were folded into the Rockefeller Foundation, in a major reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;Seim, David L. (2013), pp. 103–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Junior became the foundation chairman in 1917. One of the many prominent trustees of the institution since has been [[C. Douglas Dillon]], the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] under both Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].

===Eugenics===

Beginning in 1930 the Rockefeller Foundation provided financial support to the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics]],&lt;ref&gt;Schmuhl, Hans Walter (2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LeQusx57mpkC&amp;hl=en Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Human Heredity and Eugenics, 1927–1945]''. [Dordrecht, Netherlands]: Springer. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; which later inspired and conducted eugenics experiments in the [[Third Reich]].

The Rockefeller Foundation funded Nazi racial studies even after it was clear that this research was being used to rationalize the demonizing of Jews and other groups. Up until 1939 the Rockefeller Foundation was funding research used to support Nazi racial science studies at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics]] (KWIA.) Reports submitted to Rockefeller did not hide what these studies were being used to justify, but Rockefeller continued the funding and refrained from criticizing this research so closely derived from Nazi ideology. The Rockefeller Foundation did not alert "the world to the nature of German science and the racist folly" that German anthropology promulgated, and Rockefeller funded, for years after the passage of the 1935 Nuremberg racial laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Gretchen| last=Schafft| title=From Racism to Genocide: Anthropology in the Third Reich| location=Urbana| publisher=University of Illinois Press| pages=47–58| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=berhcMAjzZEC&amp;q=rockefeller#v=snippet&amp;q=rockefeller&amp;f=false|year=2004| isbn=9780252029301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rockefeller Foundation, along with the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution]], was the primary financier for the [[Eugenics Record Office]], until 1939.

===Harvard International Seminars===

The foundation also supported the early initiatives of [[Henry Kissinger]], such as his directorship of Harvard's ''International Seminars'' (funded as well by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]) and the early foreign policy magazine ''Confluence'', both established by him while he was still a graduate student.&lt;ref&gt;Early backing of Henry Kissinger – see [[Walter Isaacson]], ''Kissinger: A Biography'', New York: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], (updated) 2005, (p.72)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs: scale and scope==

Through the years the foundation has expanded greatly in scope. Historically, it has given more than $14 billion in current dollars&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockfound.org/about_us/history/timeline.shtml|title=The Rockefeller Foundation Timeline|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212213631/http://www.rockfound.org/about_us/history/timeline.shtml|archivedate=2007-02-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to thousands of grantees worldwide and has assisted directly in the training of nearly 13,000 Rockefeller Fellows.

Its overall philanthropic activity has been divided into five main subject areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockarch.org/collections/rf/|title=The Rockefeller Archive Center – Rockefeller Foundation Archives|website=www.rockarch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Medical, health, and population sciences
* Agricultural and natural sciences
* Arts and humanities
* Social sciences
* International relations

In the 1920s, the Rockefeller Foundation started a program to eradicate hookworm in Mexico. The program exemplified the time period's confidence in science as the solution for everything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Birn| first=Anne-Emanuelle| author2=Armando Solórzano |title=Public health policy paradoxes: science and politics in the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s| journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine| year=1999| volume=49| issue=9| pages=1197–1213| doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00160-4| pmid=10501641}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reliance on science was known as scientific neutrality. The Rockefeller Foundation program stated that there was a crucial correlation between the world of science, politics and international health policy. This heavy reliance of scientific neutrality contradicted the hookworm program's fundamental objective to invest in public health in order to develop better social conditions and to establish positive ties between the United States and Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Birn| first=Anne-Emanuelle| author2=Armando Solórzano |title=Public health policy paradoxes: science and politics in the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s| journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine| year=1999| volume=49| issue=9| pages=1197–1210| doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00160-4| pmid=10501641}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hookworm Campaign set the terms of the relationship between Mexico and the Rockefeller Foundation that persisted through subsequent programs including the development of a network of local public health departments. The importance of the hookworm campaign was to get a foot in the door and swiftly convince rural people of the value of public health work. The roles of the RF's hookworm campaign are characteristic of the policy paradoxes that emerge when science is summoned to drive policy. The campaign in Mexico served as a policy cauldron through which new knowledge could be demonstrated applicable to social and political problems on many levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Birn| first=Anne-Emanuelle| author2=Armando Solórzano| title=Public health policy paradoxes: science and politics in the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s| journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine| year=1999| volume=49| issue=9| pages=1209–1210| doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(99)00160-4| pmid=10501641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major program beginning in the 1930s was the relocation of German (Jewish) scholars from German universities to America. This was expanded to other European countries after the ''[[Anschluss]]'' occurred; when war broke out it became a full-scale rescue operation. Another program, the ''Emergency Rescue Committee'' was also partly funded with Rockefeller money; this effort resulted in the rescue of some of the most famous artists, writers and composers of Europe. Some of the notable figures relocated or saved (out of a total of 303 scholars) by the Foundation were [[Thomas Mann]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Leó Szilárd]], enriching intellectual life and academic disciplines in the US. This came to light afterwards through a brief, unpublished history of the Foundation's program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Harr| first1=John Ensor| first2=Peter J.| last2=Johnson| title=The Rockefeller Century: Three Generations of America's Greatest Family| location=New York| publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]]| date=August 10, 1988| quote=Major rescue program of European scholars| pages=401–03| isbn= 978-0684189369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant program was its Medical Sciences Division, which extensively funded women's contraception and the human reproductive system in general. Other funding went into [[endocrinology]] departments in American universities, human heredity, mammalian biology, human physiology and anatomy, [[psychology]], and the studies of human sexual behavior by Dr. [[Alfred Kinsey]].&lt;ref&gt;Harr, John Ensor, and Peter J. Johnson, ''The Rockefeller Century: Three Generations of America's Greatest Family''. Medical Sciences Division and Alfred Kinsey funding, p.456.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Virus Laboratory Fieldwork.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Trinidad Regional Virus Laboratory]] Field Assistant, [[Nariva Swamp]], [[Trinidad]]. 1959]]
In 1950 the Foundation mounted a major program of virus research, establishing field laboratories in [[Poona]], India; [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]]; [[Belém]], Brazil; [[Johannesburg]], South Africa; [[Cairo]], Egypt; [[Ibadan]], Nigeria; and [[Cali]], Colombia.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} In time, major funding was also contributed by the countries involved, while in Trinidad the [[British government]] and neighbouring British-controlled territories also assisted. Sub-professional staff were almost all recruited locally and, wherever possible, local people were given scholarships and other support to be professionally trained. In most cases, locals eventually took over management of the facilities. Support was also given to research on viruses in many other countries. The result of all this research was the identification of a huge number of viruses affecting humans, the development of new techniques for the rapid identification of viruses, and a quantum leap in our understanding of [[arthropod]]-borne viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Arthropod-Borne Viruses of Vertebrates: An Account of The Rockefeller Foundation Virus Program, 1951–1970 |pages=xvii, xx |authorlink1=Max Theiler |first1=Max |last1=Theiler |authorlink2=W.

In the arts it has helped establish or support the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival]] in [[Ontario]], Canada, and the American Shakespeare Festival in [[Stratford, Connecticut]]; [[Arena Stage]] in Washington, D.C.; [[Karamu House]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]; and [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] in New York. In a recent shift{{When|date=February 2011}} in program emphasis, President Rodin eliminated the division that spent money on the arts, the creativity and culture program. One program that signals the shift was the foundation's support as the underwriter of [[Spike Lee]]'s documentary on [[New Orleans]], ''[[When the Levees Broke]]''. The film has been used as the basis for a curriculum on poverty, developed by the Teachers College at [[Columbia University]] for their students.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/us/14foundation.html "Charities Try to Keep Up With the Gateses"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of scientists and scholars from all over the world have received foundation fellowships and scholarships for advanced study in major scientific disciplines. In addition, the foundation has provided significant and often substantial research grants to finance conferences and assist with published studies, as well as funding departments and programs, to a vast range of foreign policy and educational organizations, including:{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==The Green Revolution==
{{Main|Green Revolution}}
Agriculture was introduced to the Natural Sciences division of the foundation in the major reorganization of 1928. In 1941, the foundation gave a small grant to [[Mexico]] for maize research, in collaboration with the then new president, [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]]. This was done after the intervention of vice-president [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]] and the involvement of [[Nelson Rockefeller]]; the primary intention being to stabilise the Mexican Government and derail any possible communist infiltration, in order to protect the Rockefeller family's investments.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;The story of the Foundation and the Green Revolution – see Mark Dowie, ''American Foundations: An Investigative History'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2001, (pp.105–140)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1943 this program, under the foundation's ''Mexican Agriculture Project'', had proved such a success with the science of corn propagation and general principles of [[agronomy]] that it was exported to other Latin American countries; in 1956 the program was then taken to India; again with the geopolitical imperative of providing an antidote to communism.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; It wasn't until 1959 that senior foundation officials succeeded in getting the [[Ford Foundation]] (and later [[USAID]], and later still, the [[World Bank]]) to sign on to the major philanthropic project, known now to the world as the [[Green Revolution]]. It was originally conceived in 1943 as [[CIMMYT]], the [[International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center]] in Mexico. It also provided significant funding for the [[International Rice Research Institute]] in the [[Philippines]]. Part of the original program, the funding of the IRRI was later taken over by the Ford Foundation.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;

Costing around $600 million, over 50 years, the revolution brought new farming technology, increased productivity, expanded crop yields and mass fertilization to many countries throughout the world. Later it funded over $100 million of plant [[biotechnology]] research and trained over four hundred scientists from Asia, Africa and Latin America. It also invested in the production of [[transgenic]] crops, including rice and maize. In 1999, the then president Gordon Conway addressed the [[Monsanto Company]] board of directors, warning of the possible social and environmental dangers of this biotechnology, and requesting them to disavow the use of so-called terminator genes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biotech-info.net/gordon_conway.html|title=العاب فلاش برق|website=www.biotech-info.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company later complied.

In the 1990s, the foundation shifted its agriculture work and emphasis to Africa; in 2006 it joined with the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://terravivagrants.org/grant-makers/cross-cutting/rockefeller-foundation/|title=Rockefeller Foundation {{!}} Terra Viva Grants Directory|website=terravivagrants.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a $150 million effort to fight hunger in the continent through improved agricultural productivity. In an interview marking the 100 year anniversary of the Rockefeller Foundation, [[Judith Rodin]] explained to [[This Is Africa]] that Rockefeller has been involved in Africa since their beginning in three main areas – health, agriculture and education, though agriculture has been and continues to be their largest investment in Africa.&lt;ref name="This Is Africa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisafricaonline.com/Microsites/Agriculture |title=A century of innovation? Philanthropy and the African growth story |accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bellagio Center==
The foundation also owns and operates the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center in [[Bellagio, Italy]]. The Center comprises several buildings, spread across a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} property, on the peninsula between lakes [[Lake Como|Como]] and [[Lecco]] in [[Northern Italy]]. The Center is sometimes colloquially referred to as the ''Villa Serbelloni.'' The Villa is only one of the many buildings in which residents and conference participants are housed. The property was bequeathed to the Foundation in 1959 under the presidency of [[Dean Rusk]] (who was later to become [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John F Kennedy|Kennedy]]'s secretary of state).
The Bellagio Center operates both a conference center and a residency program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/bellagio-center The Bellagio Center]. The Rockefeller Foundation. Retrieved on 2013-08-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The residency program is a highly competitive program to which scholars, artists, writers, musicians, scientists, policymakers and development professionals from around the world can apply to work on a project of their own choosing for a period of four weeks. The essence of the program is the synergy obtained by the interaction between people coming from the most diverse backgrounds.
Numerous [[Nobel laureates]], [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]] winners, [[National Book Award]] recipients, [[Prince Mahidol Award]] winners and [[MacArthur fellows]], as well as several acting and former heads of State and Government, have been in residence at Bellagio.

== Rockefeller Foundation Communication for Social Change Network ==
The network is enabled by the Rockefeller Foundation for collaboration between experts and communication professionals that include grassroots/community-based and international non-governmental organizations, as well as multilateral and bilateral entities. Its involvement in AIDS prevention, was based on promoting deep-rooted social changes that stem from informed and inclusive public engagement. However, it recognized that wide-scale educational campaigns focused on altering individual behavior played a critical role.

The strategy and principles linked with the network are listed below:
* "Sustainability of social change is more likely if the individuals and communities most affected ''own'' the process and content of communication."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Scalway| first=Thomas| year=2003| title=Missing the Message?  20 Years of Learning from HIV/AIDS| url=| journal=Panos Institute| pages=21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Communication for social change should be empowering, horizontal (versus top-down), give a voice to the previously unheard members of the community, and be biased towards local content and ownership."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* "Communities should be the agents of their own change."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* "Emphasis should shift from persuasion and the transmission of information from outside technical experts to dialogue, debate and negotiation on issues that resonate with members of the community."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* "Emphasis on outcomes should go beyond individual behaviour to social norms, policies, culture and the supporting environment."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==100 Resilient Cities==
In December 2013, The Rockefeller Foundation launched the 100 Resilient Cities initiative, which is dedicated to promoting urban resilience, defined as "the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow no matter what kinds of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.100resilientcities.org/resilience#/-_/| title=City Resilience| publisher=100 Resilient Cities| accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through its program, 100 Resilient Cities offers cities the following resources:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.100resilientcities.org/about-us//#/-_/| title=About 100RC| publisher=100 Resilient Cities| accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Financial and logistical guidance for establishing an innovative new position in city government, a Chief Resilience Officer, who will lead the city's resilience efforts
* Expert support for development of a robust resilience strategy
* Access to solutions, service providers, and partners from the private, public and NGO sectors who can help them develop and implement their resilience strategies
* Membership of a global network of member cities who can learn from and help each other
A total of 100 cities across six continents are part of the program, as of May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/25/rockefeller-100-resilient-cities-washington-lagos-manchester-belfast| title=About 100RC| work=[[The Guardian]]| accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 100 cities have developed individual City Resilience Strategies with technical support from a Chief Resilience Officer (CRO). The CRO ideally reports directly to the city's chief executive and helps coordinate all the resilience efforts in a single city.

In January 2016, The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development announced winners of its National Disaster Resilience Competition (NDRC), awarding three 100RC member cities – New York, NY; Norfolk, VA; and New Orleans, LA – with more than $437 million in disaster resilience funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/about-us/news-media/hud-awards-1-billion-through-national-disaster-resilience-competition/| title=About 100RC| publisher=Rockefeller Foundation| accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grant was the largest ever received by the city of Norfolk.

== Cultural Innovation Fund ==
The Cultural Innovation Fund is a pilot grant program that is overseen by [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center for the Arts]]. The Rockefeller Foundation selected [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] to administer the fund based on the institutions steady track record in creating community based partnerships and implementing art based programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aboutlincolncenter.org/press-room/release/1017?category_id=76|title=Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aboutlincolncenter.org|language=|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/about-us/news-media/lincoln-center-rockefeller-foundation-inaugural-grantees-cultural-innovation-fund/|title=Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in Partnership with The Rockefeller Foundation Announces Inaugural Grantees of Lincoln Center Cultural Innovation Fund – The Rockefeller Foundation|work=The Rockefeller Foundation|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grants are to be used towards innovative ideas that would bring art access and foster cultural opportunities in the underserved areas of [[Brooklyn]] and the [[South Bronx]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/lincoln-center-cultural-innovation-fund-awards-innovation-fund-grants|title=Lincoln Center Cultural Innovation Fund Awards Innovation Fund Grants|last=|first=|date=|work=Philanthropy News Digest (PND)|access-date=2017-11-09|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with three overarching goals. 
* Increase access to the arts in underserved neighborhoods around [[New York City]] 
* increase the "places and platforms" where cultural activities are taking place
* support nonprofit organizations in implementing cultural based programs and strategies&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Family involvement==
The Rockefeller family helped lead the foundation in its early years, but later limited itself to one or two representatives, to maintain the foundation's independence and avoid charges of undue family influence. These representatives have included the former president [[John D. Rockefeller 3rd]], and then his son [[John D. Rockefeller, IV]], who gave up the trusteeship in 1981. In 1989, [[David Rockefeller]]'s daughter, [[Peggy Dulany]], was appointed to the board for a five-year term.

In October 2006, [[David Rockefeller, Jr.]] joined the board of trustees, re-establishing the direct family link and becoming the sixth family member to serve on the board. By contrast, the [[Ford Foundation]] has severed all direct links with the Ford family.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Stock in the family's oil companies is a major part of the foundation's assets, beginning with [[Standard Oil]] and now with its corporate descendants, including [[Exxon Mobil]].&lt;ref&gt;Share portfolio – see Waldemar Nielsen ''The Big Foundations'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1972.

==Historical legacy==

The second-oldest major philanthropic institution in America, after the [[Carnegie Corporation]], the foundation's impact on philanthropy in general has been profound. It has supported [[United Nations]] programs throughout its history, such as the recent ''First Global Forum On Human Development'', organized by the ''United Nations Development Programme'' (UNDP) in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;"Global Forum on Human Development". Originally retrieved at ''Hdr.undp.org'' on 2013-08-24. Not available at ''[http://report.hdr.undp.org/ report.hdr.undp.org]'' 2017-01-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early institutions it set up have served as models for current organizations: the UN's [[World Health Organization]], set up in 1948, is modeled on the International Health Division; the U.S. Government's [[National Science Foundation]] (1950) on its approach in support of research, scholarships and institutional development; and the [[National Institute of Health]] (1950) imitated its longstanding medical programs.&lt;ref&gt;"Global Forum on Human Development" (1999). As model for UN organizations, pp.64-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of shop stewards may vary from being a mere representative of a larger national union towards independent structures with the power of collective bargaining on the workplace.

'''Timothy Perry Shriver''' (born August 29, 1959) is Chairman of [[Special Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.specialolympics.org/Press/2013/Special_Olympics_Names_Janet_Froetscher_New_CEO.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.travelchinaguide.com/forum2.asp?pp=&amp;i=39786&amp;page=1 Inspiring Theme Song – Sports – China Travel Community&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Timothy Shriver was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] to [[Sargent Shriver]], a former [[United States Ambassador to France]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party's]] vice-presidential candidate in 1972, and [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]], the founder of [[Special Olympics]]. He was raised as a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/religionfromtheheart/2008/04/proud_to_be_catholic.html Proud to Be a Catholic]&lt;/ref&gt; along with his siblings, [[Bobby Shriver]], [[Maria Shriver]], [[Mark Shriver]], and [[Anthony Shriver]]. He is a member of the [[Kennedy Family]] through his mother, [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]].

Shriver graduated from [[St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.)|St. Albans School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06E2D8163BF93BA35751C1A963948260 |title=Linda Potter To Wed Timothy Shriver – New York Times |date=December 8, 1985 |accessdate=June 26, 2008 |publisher=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his B.A. from [[Yale University]] in 1981, his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in religion and [[religious education]] from [[The Catholic University of America]] in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;[http://alumni.cua.edu/Recognition/NotableAlumni.cfm The Catholic University of America Office of Alumni Relations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and his Ph.D. in education from the [[University of Connecticut]] in 1996.

==Career==
Shriver spent 15 years in public education—some in special education—as a teacher.&lt;ref name="ABILITY 2014"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cooper |first=Chet |title=Timothy Shriver — Special Olympics |url= http://abilitymagazine.com/Special-Olympics-Shriver.html |publisher=ABILITY Magazine |accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a high school teacher in the [[New Haven, Connecticut]] public school system, and as a counselor and teacher in the [[University of Connecticut]] branch of the [[Upward Bound]] program for disadvantaged youth. He became a Fellow at the School Development Program at the Yale Child Study Center.

He was instrumental in establishing the Social Development Project at the public schools in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and also established the Collaborative for Academic, Social and Emotional Learning at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].

He was the executive producer on ''[[The Ringer (2005 film)|The Ringer]]'', a co-producer on ''[[Amistad (1997 film)|Amistad]]'' and the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] movie ''The Loretta Claiborne Story'', and has served as a producer or co-producer on shows for the [[American Broadcasting Company]], the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Corporation]], and the [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] cable channel.  He is currently a board member of [[Malaria No More]], a New York-based nonprofit that was launched at the 2006 [[White House]] Summit with the goal of ending all deaths caused by malaria.

He is currently the Chairman of Special Olympics. Timothy and his brother [[Anthony Shriver]] have recently aligned the [[Special Olympics]] and [[Best Buddies]] (founded by [[Anthony Shriver]]), to create the Eunice Kennedy Shriver Challenge event, aimed to encourage greater acceptance and inclusion for those with intellectual and developmental disabilities,&lt;ref name="ABILITY Magazine"&gt;[http://abilitymagazine.com/Eunice-Legacy.html "Timothy &amp; Anthony Shriver — Eunice’s Legacy"]. ''ABILITY'' Magazine. Daryl "Chill" Mitchell Issue. Aug/Sept 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; a condition that affected their late aunt [[Rosemary Kennedy]].&lt;ref name="ABILITY Magazine" /&gt; Shriver has served on the Board of Directors of [[The Future Project]], a national initiative to empower young people to discover their passion and change the world, since its founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/07/encouraging-students-to-imagine-the-impossible/278017/|title=Encouraging Students to Imagine the Impossible|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=November 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; And he has written a memoir ''Fully Alive: Discovering What Matters Most'', published by [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] (2014).

===Activism===
As chairman of [[Special Olympics]], Timothy Shriver has campaigned against [[Insult|mocking]] of and discrimination against participants in Special Olympics. He has specifically argued against use of what he calls "the R word," meaning ''[[mental retardation|retarded]]'', stating that the word, "retard", is very offensive and people with intellectual disabilities should be respected and treated like all other people.

In 2008, Shriver and supporters called for a [[boycott]] of the movie ''[[Tropic Thunder]]'', claiming that it mocks people with mental disabilities. The movie is written, produced by and stars Ben Stiller.  In a commentary for [[CNN]], Shriver wrote in part,

{{Quote|Together with the members of the international coalition, I am asking [[Steven Spielberg]], Stacey Snider, [[Ben Stiller]] and the entire "Tropic Thunder" team to stop showing the film, and asking movie theaters and moviegoers to shut this movie out. "Tropic Thunder" is a colossal blunder. Don't show or see "Tropic Thunder."

The degrading use of the word "retard" together with the broader humiliation of people with intellectual disabilities in the film goes way too far. When the [[R-word]] is casually bandied about and when bumbling, clueless caricatures designed to mimic the behavior of people with intellectual disabilities are on screen, they have an unmistakable outcome: They mock, directly or indirectly, people with intellectual disabilities. They perpetuate the worst stereotypes. They further exclusion and isolation. They are simply mean.&lt;ref name="rwordban"&gt;

In November 2014, Shriver released a book called ''Fully Alive: Discovering What Matters Most''.

==Career==

===Police===
Ashley Tsang joined the Hong Kong Police in January 1966 as a [[Hong Kong Police#Ranks|Probationary Inspector]].&lt;ref name=ts/&gt; From 1987 to 1989 he was in charge of the Narcotics bureau. From 1992 to 1994 he was headed the criminal law division, including the commander for [[Hong Kong island]] region.&lt;ref name="big5x"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2002-07/03/content_468473.htm|title=曾蔭培簡歷 |publisher=Big5.xinhuanet.com|date=27 September 2005|accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 he was director of crime and security department. From 1996 to 1999 he was deputy commissioner of police.&lt;ref name="big5x"/&gt; In 2001, he became the [[Commissioner of Police (Hong Kong)|HK Commissioner of Police]] and retired in 2003.&lt;ref name=ts/&gt;

===Property director===
In May 2004, he joined property firm [[NWS Holdings]], a subsidiary of [[New World Development]], as an executive director. Prior to his brother becoming [[Chief executive of Hong Kong]], there were criticism in 2005 that Tsang Yam-pui moved from a position of highest trust (police commissioner) to an executive of a real estate firm, where the company's profit depend on the government's regulation.&lt;ref name=ts/&gt;

==Controversy==

===NWS deal issue===
As early as June 2003, New World Development wanted to convert the [[Wan Chai]] [[Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre]] car park into a used car venue.&lt;ref name="ts2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Metro/GG19Ak10.html|title=Tsang denies influence in brother's job at NWS|publisher=The Standard|date=19 July 2005|accessdate=11 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403095740/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Metro/GG19Ak10.html|archivedate=3 April 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Tsang Yam-pui became director, and Donald Tsang became chief executive, the demand by New World was approved. Both brothers denied any association to this deal. A NWS spokesman even had to come out to say they were not involved.&lt;ref name="ts2"/&gt;

===Hair dye court case===
As a commissioner, he engaged in a public dispute with a female senior inspector, Sharon Lim, who refused to remove [[Hair highlighting|highlight]]s from her hair, which she had dyed since 1987. Tsang's rule of not allowing dyed hair in his police department went into effect in 2001.&lt;ref name="newsscot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.scotsman.com/news/Hong-Kong-police-detective-in.2365419.jp|title=Hong Kong police detective in court fight for right to dye|publisher=News.scotsman.com|accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lim was one of four policewomen who kept their hair dyed, and the case had to be settled in court.&lt;!-- results? --&gt;&lt;ref name="newsscot"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="951">'''[[RFM (customer value)]]''' is a model that diversifies considerable [[customer]]s from a mass of data by three attributes. Interval of customer [[consumer|consumption]], frequency and payment value, are these three factors. Hughes (1994) considered that the three variables are equal in the importance; therefore, the weights of the three variables are identical. On the other hand, Stone (1995) indicated that the three variables are different in the importance due to the characteristic of [[industry]]. Thus, the weights of the three variables are not equal.&lt;ref&gt;Peiman Alipour Sarvari, Alp Ustundag, Hidayet Takci , (2016),"Performance evaluation of different customer segmentation approaches based on RFM and demographics analysis", [[Kybernetes]], Vol. 45 Iss 7 pp. - Permanent link to this document: https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/K-07-2015-0180&lt;/ref&gt;
