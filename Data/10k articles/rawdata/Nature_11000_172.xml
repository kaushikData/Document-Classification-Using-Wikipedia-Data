The '''2004 Russia–Belarus energy dispute''' was a commercial and diplomatic dispute between [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]] that escalated in January 2004. [[Belarus–Russia relations|Close relations between the two countries]] and [[Union State|willingness for political integration]] had made it possible for Belarus to purchase gas from Russia at heavily discounted prices. In the late 1990s, [[Foreign policy of Russia|Russian foreign policy]] shifted away from [[geopolitics]] and became more pragmatic and economical, especially after the inauguration of [[President of Russia|President]] [[Vladimir Putin]]. As a result, [[Gazprom]] moved to ensure the reliability of gas transits to Europe by attempting to establish control over the Belarusian transit network. Belarus initially agreed to sell 50% of the network, but after disagreements over price, Belarus severed the contract. Gazprom announced price rises, and after Belarus refused, Gazprom ceased to import gas to Belarus on 1 January 2004. Belarus compensated by siphoning from gas meant for transit to Europe, which on 18 February resulted in Gazprom completely shutting off the supply to Belarus. Other companies supplied Belarus on short-term contracts until June 2004, when a new contract with Gazprom was finally signed.

== Background ==

=== Economic background ===
{{main|Economy of Belarus}}
Belarus is an important transit route of Russian gas to Europe, with around 20–25% of [[Russia in the European energy sector|Gazprom's European exports]] passing through Belarusian territory. Two major [[Gas pipeline|pipelines]] run through the country: [[Northern Lights (pipeline)|Northern Lights]] and [[Yamal-Europe pipeline|Yamal-Europe]]. The former is used to transit Russian gas to Europe as well as for Belarusian domestic use; the latter transits gas solely for export to Europe. The Belarusian economy is heavily gas dependent—gas accounted for 59.9% of the country's energy balance in 2003.&lt;ref name="yafimava"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yafimava|first=Katja|title=Russian and CIS Gas Markets and their Impact on Europe|chapter=Belarus: the domestic gas market and relations with Russia|editor=Simon Pirani|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955454-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, most of the electricity in the country is generated from gas. In 2003, Belarusian gas consumption was {{convert|16.66|e9m3|abbr=off}}. Domestic gas production amounted to only {{convert|0.25|e9m3|abbr=off}}. The rest was imported from Russia, chiefly from [[Gazprom]].&lt;ref name="yafimava"/&gt; For political reasons, Belarus was able to purchase gas from Russia for Russian domestic prices, which were only a quarter of the international market price.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/rift-threatens-belarus-ties-with-russia-after-gas-supply-is-cut-during-20c-winter-570600.html|title=Rift threatens Belarus ties with Russia after gas supply is cut during -20C winter|last=Krushelnycky|first=Askold|date=2004-02-20|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January, 2003, Belarus paid $34.37 per 1,000&amp;nbsp;cubic meters for its imports.&lt;ref name="yafimava"/&gt;

=== Political background ===
{{main|Russia-Belarus relations}}
After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Russia and Belarus enjoyed relatively good relations. Both countries strove for political integration, Russia mostly for geopolitical and Belarus chiefly for economic reasons. Russia also saw political integration as a means for eventually gaining full control over the Belarusian transit routes—thus ensuring the reliability of transit. The Belarusian leadership chose to build close relations with Russia, with the ultimate aim of formal unification.&lt;ref name="yafimava"/&gt; Gas price agreements between the two countries were settled politically, with the commercial side being given less attention.&lt;ref name="yafimava"/&gt;

The relations between the two countries began to change as a result of the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]]. Russia no longer saw itself strong enough to sustain its aspirations of [[superpower]] status. Consequently, Russia began to attach more significance to [[geo-economics]] rather than [[geo-politics]] in its relations with [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] neighbours. This development accelerated during [[Vladimir Putin]]'s presidency, when Russian foreign policy became more pragmatic and economised.&lt;ref name="yafimava"/&gt;

Because of domestic payment collection problems, Belarus accumulated [[debt]]s for its gas imports. When disagreements over the political integration increased, Gazprom realized that the Belarusian debts would in future undermine the reliability of Belarusian transit routes. Consequently, Gazprom sought to establish a [[joint venture]] to own and operate the Belarusian transit network, to ensure uninterrupted transit of gas to [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="yafimava"/&gt;

== 2004 dispute ==
In an intergovernmental agreement signed in April 2002, Belarus promised to sell 50% of [[Beltransgaz]], the company owning the Belarusian transit network, to Gazprom. The agreement also stipulated that gas prices to Belarus would be the same as Russian domestic prices for the next five years.&lt;ref name="chloe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordenergy.org/pdfs/NG8.pdf|title= Fraternal Friction or Fraternal Fiction? The Gas Factor in Russia-Belarusian Relations|last=Chloë|first=Bruce|year=2005|publisher=[[Oxford Institute for Energy Studies]] |accessdate=2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract did not specify the value of Beltransgaz. Belarus estimated it as $5–6 billion, while Gazprom proposed a price of $500–600 million. The [[President of Belarus|Belarusian President]] [[Alexander Lukashenko]] later suggested $2.5 billion as a lower limit, but this was rejected by Gazprom. As the political agreements that had given Belarus the right to purchase gas at Russian domestic prices were now broken, Gazprom, backed by the Russian government, now moved to abolish the price discounts.&lt;ref name="yafimava"/&gt;

Gazprom stated that if an agreement was not signed until 2004, it would increase gas prices from $30/m to $50 per 1,000&amp;nbsp;cubic meters. Belarus refused, and on 1 January 2004, Gazprom stopped shipping gas via the [[Northern Lights (pipeline)|Northern lights]] pipeline.&lt;ref name="yafimava"/&gt; Belarus was able to compensate by purchasing gas from non-Gazprom exporters such as [[Itera]] and [[TransNafta]] on short-term contracts. This continued until 18 February, when the companies refused to sign further short-term supply contracts. Since Belarus was dependent on gas for most of its heat and electricity production, the situation in the country during cold winter started to become critical. After deliveries stopped, Belarus started to siphon gas meant for transit to Europe from the [[Yamal-Europe pipeline]], without Gazprom's approval. As a result, at 18:00 [[Moscow time]] on 18 February, Gazprom completely cut off supplies to the Belarusian network. [[Germany]] experienced only minor shortfalls in deliveries because of extensive storages of gas and due to most of imports coming through [[Ukraine]]; however, [[Poland]] reported more severe disruption. Supplies to [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] were also affected. Belarus managed to sign a new short-term contract with [[TransNafta]] at the price of $46.68 per 1,000&amp;nbsp;cubic meters, which resulted in Gazprom resuming supplies before midnight of 19 February. Similar contracts supplied Belarus until June, when Belarus finally agreed a new contract with Gazprom for delivering gas for the rest of 2004 with the price of $46.68 per 1,000&amp;nbsp;cubic meters.&lt;ref name="yafimava"/&gt;

In mid-2004, political relations between Belarus and Russia started to improve, and a new agreement between Belarus and Gazprom was signed. The two sides now agreed to appoint an outside consultancy firm to define an appropriate value for the sale of [[Beltransgaz]].&lt;ref name="yafimava"/&gt;

== Implications ==
Although the 2004 dispute further strengthened the perception that Belarus and its economy were heavily dependent on Russian gas and Gazprom, it also became clear that Belarus also possessed some important cards. In 2007, after a [[2007 Russia–Belarus energy dispute|later dispute]], Gazprom agreed to pay $2.5 billion for Beltransgaz—several times more than it was prepared to pay in 2004.&lt;ref name="yafimava"/&gt; The 2004 dispute also raised concerns about reliability of Gazprom's supplies to Europe, and highlighted the fact that Gazprom had not solved the issue of reliable transit.&lt;ref name="chloe"/&gt;

== Description ==

A conventional [[combined cycle]] power station burns [[natural gas]] or gasified [[coal]] with [[air]] to drive a [[gas turbine]] and then uses the hot [[exhaust gas]] to heat water and drive a [[steam turbine]]. The [[working fluid]] for the gas turbine is carbon dioxide and [[water vapor]] from the combustion, along with [[nitrogen]] from the air (partially converted into [[nitrogen oxide]]). With this system, it is possible to achieve an [[Lower heating value|LHV]] efficiency of around 55 to 59 percent. The gases driving the gas turbine will also constitute the principal emissions from the station, unless captured by an external system, at expense of a lower total efficiency. In addition, the station requires a cooling tower or access to large amounts of water for cooling.&lt;ref name="modernpowersystems2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gasturbineworld2014"&gt;{{cite news

In contrast, the Allam cycle uses a single turbine, driven by a working fluid consisting of only water and carbon dioxide, the mass of the latter being around 97 percent of the total. This is achieved by using pure [[oxygen]] instead of air to burn the fuel. Similarly to combined-cycle plants, the intended fuel is natural gas or gasified coal. The exhaust gas is cooled in a [[heat exchanger]], and the steam is condensed and separated from the flow, becoming a potential source of fresh water. The carbon dioxide is compressed mechanically, and a small amount, matching the amount continuously added through combustion, is captured at high pressure, ready for pipeline transmission. The rest of the carbon dioxide is reheated in the heat exchanger and recycled into the combustion unit, where it continues to form the vast majority of the working fluid.&lt;ref name="modernpowersystems2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gasturbineworld2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="snldemoplant2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="breakingenergy2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="allamcycle8rivers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="allamcyclenetpower" /&gt;&lt;ref name="modernpowersystemsallam2013" /&gt;

Even though only one turbine is used, the Allam cycle can potentially achieve efficiencies up to about 59 percent (LHV) for natural gas and 51–52 percent (LHV) for gasified coal. This is due to the use of carbon dioxide as the main constituent of the working fluid. In its [[supercritical fluid|supercritical]] state, which it reaches in the combustion unit, carbon dioxide is very efficient for driving a turbine. Also, energy losses from [[phase transition]]s of water are avoided, which allows Allam cycle plants to recover more energy in their heat exchangers than combined cycle plants can do. At this efficiency, carbon dioxide capture is already a part of the Allam cycle, whereas if desired in conventional plants, the capture has to be added as an external function that may decrease the overall efficiency by around 10 percent.&lt;ref name="modernpowersystems2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gasturbineworld2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="snldemoplant2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="breakingenergy2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="allamcycle8rivers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="allamcyclenetpower" /&gt;&lt;ref name="modernpowersystemsallam2013" /&gt;

Unlike the combined cycle, the Allam cycle requires an [[air separation]] unit, to supply the cycle with oxygen. On the other hand, there is no need for large-scale external cooling, there is only one turbine, and small components can be used, as the system operates at high pressures and thus high power densities. Complete Allam cycle power stations can therefore be smaller than combined cycle stations, even before adding the considerable size of carbon dioxide capture equipment. This potentially makes the capital costs for the Allam cycle lower than for the combined cycle at equivalent capacities. Other advantages include the complete absence of nitrogen oxide in the waste, and for stations located in dry environments, the integrated generation of water.&lt;ref name="modernpowersystems2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gasturbineworld2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="snldemoplant2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="breakingenergy2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="allamcycle8rivers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="allamcyclenetpower" /&gt;&lt;ref name="modernpowersystemsallam2013" /&gt;

A 25 [[MWe|MW&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;]]/50 [[MWt|MW&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;]] demonstration plant for electricity generation using the Allam cycle is being built in [[La Porte, Texas]]. The project is a collaboration between, among others, [[Exelon]], [[Toshiba]], [[McDermott International|McDermott]], and ''8 Rivers Capital'''s portfolio company, NET Power.&lt;ref name="team8rivers"&gt;{{cite web

'''Birmingham Natural History Society''' is a [[learned society]] for the study of the [[natural history]] of [[Birmingham]], England, and in the surrounding [[English Midlands|midlands region]], and beyond.&lt;ref name="website"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://bnhsoc.org.uk |title=Birmingham Natural History Society | publisher=  |year= |accessdate=2012-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1858, and is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]].&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;{{EW charity|500819}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society has had various names, e.g. in the 1870s it was called the Birmingham Natural History and Microscopical Society, and from 1894 to 1963 the Birmingham Natural History and Philosophical Society.

==History==

The Society was founded in 1858.&lt;ref name=Proc15_1/&gt; For a considerable part of its early life, it was called the Birmingham Natural History and Microscopical Society.&lt;ref name=Bagnall1876&gt;{{Citation | last=Bagnall | first=James E. | year=1876 | title=Notes on Sutton Park: Its Flowering Plants, Ferns, and Mosses, read at a general meeting of the Birmingham Natural History and Microscopical Society, held December 6th, 1876 | publication-place= Birmingham | oclc=18894820 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877, the Society played the lead in forming the [[Union of Midland Natural History Societies]], which published the journal ''The Midland Naturalist''.&lt;ref name=Anon78&gt;{{Citation |last=Anon. |year=1878 |title=Opening Address |journal=The Midland Naturalist |volume=1 |pages=1–4 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/50180#page/19/mode/1up |accessdate=2012-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the societies in the union later merged with the Birmingham Natural History Society. The Birmingham Philosophical Society, founded in 1876, merged in 1894, when the title of the Society was changed to the Birmingham Natural History and Philosophical Society. The Midland Malacological Society and the Birmingham Entomological Society were amalgamated in 1906 and 1908 respectively.&lt;ref name=Proc15_1&gt;''Proceedings of the Birmingham Natural History and Philosophical Society'' '''15'''(1), 1921–1922, cover page&lt;/ref&gt; The society's activities were greatly reduced by world war one but activity had picked up again by 1920.{{sfn|Kenrick|1958|pp=29–30}} In 1924 the society carried out an extensive survey of [[Hartlebury Common]].{{sfn|Kenrick|1958|p=31}}

The Society rooms suffered bomb damage on October 25, 1940 and as a result the society suspended its activities for the remainder of hostilities.{{sfn|Kenrick|1958|p=31}} The society began to meet again in 1945 and restarted publication of its proceedings in 1950.{{sfn|Kenrick|1958|p=39}}

The current title of the Society was first used in its ''Proceedings'' in 1964.&lt;ref name=Proc20_3&gt;''Proceedings of the Birmingham Natural History Society'' '''20'''(3), 1964, cover page&lt;/ref&gt;

Important early members of the society included the botanist [[James Eustace Bagnall]] (1830-1918), who produced the first Flora of [[Sutton Park]]&lt;ref name=Bagnall1876/&gt; (now a [[national nature reserve (United Kingdom)|national nature reserve]]) and later the first ''Flora of [[Warwickshire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Bagnall | first=James E. | year=1891 | title=Flora of Warwickshire | publication-place=London | publisher=Gurney &amp; Jackson | oclc=15190032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

The society was responsible for the designation of [[Edgbaston Pool]] as a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]],&lt;ref name="BNHS-96"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coxhead|first=Peter|date=January 2012|title=From the President|journal=Newsletter|publisher=Birmingham Natural History Society|issue=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; and until 2012 was formally involved in its management.&lt;ref name="BNHS-96" /&gt;

The society operates a library for its members,&lt;ref name="website" /&gt; and holds regular meetings (at the Friends Meeting House in [[Selly Oak]], {{Coord|52.4362635|-1.9424939|type:landmark_region:GB-BIR|display=inline,title}}), field trips and training sessions.&lt;ref name="website" /&gt; It publishes a journal, ''Proceedings of the Birmingham Natural History Society'' ([[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]] 0144-1477). First published in 1870,&lt;ref name=Anon62&gt;{{Citation |last=Anon. |year=1962 |title=Editorial |journal=Proceedings of the Birmingham Natural History and Philosophical Society |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  the journal currently appears in four parts to a volume; parts have appeared a different intervals over time, e.g. each part of Volume 15 covered two calendar years whereas each part of Volume 29 covered three.&lt;ref&gt;Cover pages of the relevant volumes: ''Proceedings of the Birmingham Natural History and Philosophical Society'' '''15'''(1) 1921-1922 and ''Proceedings of the Birmingham Natural History Society'' '''29'''(1) 2008–2010&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, the hon. secretary is Dr Peter Jarvis.&lt;ref name="BNHS-96" /&gt;

The '''Chilean Matorral''' (NT1201) is a [[terrestrial ecoregion]] of [[central Chile]], located on the west coast of [[South America]]. It is in the [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] [[biome]], part of the [[Neotropic]] [[ecozone]].

[[Matorral]] is typically characterized by a temperate Mediterranean climate, with rainy winters and dry summers. It is one of the world's five [[Mediterranean climate]] regions, which are all located in the middle latitudes on the west coast of continents. The [[Mediterranean Basin]], the [[California chaparral and woodlands]] ecoregion of [[California]] and [[Baja California]], the [[Cape Province]] of [[South Africa]], and southwestern corner of [[Australia]] are the other Mediterranean climate regions.

==Setting==
[[image:Palmar de Ocoa, Chile.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Jubaea|Jubaea chilensis]] forest at [[Cerro La Campana]]]]
The Matorral occupies central Chile between 32° and 37° south latitude. The [[Pacific Ocean]] lies to the west, and the Chilean Coastal Range lies parallel to the coast. The Chilean Central Valley lies between the Coastal range and the [[Andes Mountains]], which bound the Matorral ecoregion on the east. To the north is the extremely dry [[Atacama]] desert, which separates the Matorral from the tropical forests of northern South America. A semi-desert region known as ''[[Norte Chico, Chile|El Norte Chico]]'', (the "little north") lies between 28° and 32° south latitude, and is the transition zone between the Atacama desert and the Matorral. To the south lies the cooler and wetter [[Valdivian temperate rain forests]] ecoregion, which includes most of South America's [[temperate rain forest]]s.

==Flora==
The Chilean Matorral ecoregion is home to several plant communities.
*'''Coastal Matorral''' is a low, soft [[scrubland]] which extends from [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]] in the north to [[Valparaiso]] in the south. Typical species are the coastal daisy ''([[Bahia ambrosioides]])'', Palhuén ''([[Adesmia microphylla]])'', and Palo de Yagua, the wild coastal fuchsia ''([[Fuchsia lycioides]])''. The coastal matorral is similar to the [[garrigue]] of the [[Mediterranean Basin]] and the [[coastal sage scrub]] of [[southern California]].
*'''Matorral''' is a [[shrubland]] plant community, composed of [[sclerophyll]] ("hard-leaved") shrubs and small trees, [[cactus]], and [[bromeliad]]s. Typical species include Litre [[Lithraea|''(Lithraea venenosa)'']], Quillay or Soapbark Tree ''([[Quillaja saponaria]])'', cactus ''(Echinopsis chiloensis)'', and bromeliads of genus ''[[Puya (genus)|Puya]]'', with a diverse understory of herbs, vines, and [[geophyte]]s. The matorral is similar to the [[chaparral]] of California&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]] of the Mediterranean Basin.
*'''Espinal''' is a [[savanna]] plant community, composed of widely spaced clumps of trees, predominantly Espino ''([[Acacia caven]])'' and spiny carob tree ''([[Prosopis]] chilensis),'' with an understory of annual grasses introduced from the Mediterranean Basin in the 16th century. Much of the espinal was formerly matorral, degraded over the centuries by intensive grazing of sheep, goats, and cattle.
*'''Sclerophyll woodlands and forests''' were once more extensive, but now exist in small patches in the coast ranges and Andean foothills. The sclerophyll forests and woodlands are composed predominantly of evergreen sclerophyll trees, including Peumo ''([[Cryptocarya alba]])'', [[Boldo]] ''(Peumus boldus)'', [[Mayten]] ''([[Maytenus boaria]])'', and Chilean Wine Palm ''([[Jubaea]] chilensis)''.

The ecoregion has many [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] plant species, with affinities to the South American tropics, the [[Antarctic flora]], and the Andes. About 95% of the plant species are endemic to Chile, including ''[[Gomortega keule]]'', ''[[Pitavia punctata]]'', ''[[Nothofagus alessandrii]]'', and the [[Chilean Wine Palm]], ''Jubaea chilensis''.

==Conservation==
The Matorral contains the majority of Chile's population and largest cities. The [[Chilean Central Valley|Central valley]] is Chile's main agricultural region, and the region is also subject to extensive grazing, logging, and urbanization. Of Chile's ecoregions, the Matorral is the least protected by national parks and preserves.

[[File:Matejko Christianization of Poland.jpg|thumb|350px|right|''[[Christianization of Poland A.D. 966.]]'' by [[Jan Matejko]]]]
The '''Christianization of Poland'''&lt;ref name="LERSKI1996"/&gt; (Polish: ''chrystianizacja Polski'')&lt;ref name="chrystianizacja"/&gt; refers to the introduction and subsequent spread of [[Christianity in Poland]].&lt;ref name="LukowskiZawadzki2006"/&gt; The impetus to the process was the '''Baptism of Poland''' ({{lang-pl|chrzest Polski}}), the personal [[baptism]] of [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]], the first ruler of the future Polish state, and much of his court. The ceremony took place on the [[Holy Saturday]] of 14 April 966, although the exact location is still disputed by historians, with the cities of [[Poznań]] and [[Gniezno]] being the most likely sites. Mieszko's wife, [[Dobrawa of Bohemia]], is often credited as a major influence on Mieszko's decision to accept Christianity.

While the spread of Christianity in Poland took centuries to finish, the process was ultimately successful, as within several decades Poland joined the rank of established European states recognised by the papacy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. According to historians, the baptism of Poland marks the beginning of Polish statehood.&lt;ref name="Zubrzycki2006"/&gt; Nevertheless, the Christianization was a long and arduous process, as most of the Polish population remained pagan until the [[Pagan reaction in Poland|pagan reaction]] during the 1030s.

==Background==
[[File:Dąbrówka Czeska.jpeg|thumb|right|px250|[[Dobrawa]], Mieszko's wife who played a major role in Poland's conversion to Christianity.]]
{{main|Poland in the Early Middle Ages|Slavic mythology}}
Before the adoption of Christianity in modern- day Poland, there were a number of different [[pagan]] tribes. [[Svetovid]] was among the most widespread pagan gods worshiped in Poland. Christianity arrived around the late 9th century, most likely around the time when the [[Vistulan]] tribe encountered the Christian rite in dealings with their neighbors, the [[Great Moravia]] (Bohemian) state.

The Moravian cultural influence played a significant role in the spread of Christianity onto the Polish lands and the subsequent adoption of that religion.&lt;ref name="LERSKI1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bardach53-54"/&gt; In the opinion of Davies, the Christianization of Poland through the Czech–Polish alliance represented a conscious choice on the part of Polish rulers to ally themselves with the Czech state rather than the German one.&lt;ref name="LERSKI1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies2005-53"/&gt; In a similar fashion, some of the later political struggles involved the Polish Church refusing to subordinate itself to the German hierarchy and instead being directly subordinate to the [[Holy See|Vatican]].&lt;ref name="Kłoczowski2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LERSKI19962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies2005-57"/&gt;

==Baptism==
[[File:MieszkoDagome.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Mieszko I]], the first Christian ruler of Poland. Depicted by [[Jan Matejko]] as holding a crucifix in an allusion to the Baptism of Poland.]]
The "Baptism of Poland" refers to the ceremony when the first ruler of the Polish state, [[Mieszko I]] and much of his court, converted to the Christian religion.&lt;ref name="bardach53-54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LERSKI19962"/&gt; Mieszko's wife [[Dobrawa of Bohemia]], a zealous Christian, played a significant role in promoting Christianity in Poland, and might have had significant influence on converting Mieszko himself.&lt;ref name="LERSKI1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kłoczowski2000"/&gt;

The exact place of Mieszko's baptism is disputed; historians, however, argue that [[Gniezno]] or [[Poznań]] are the most likely sites.&lt;ref name="Kłoczowski2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moczulski2007"/&gt; Some historians have suggested less likely alternative locations, such as [[Ostrów Lednicki]], or even in German [[Regensburg]].&lt;ref name="Moczulski2007"/&gt; The date of Mieszko's baptism was on the [[Holy Saturday]] of 14 April 966.&lt;ref name="Kłoczowski2000"/&gt;

The ceremony was preceded by a week of oral catechism and several days of fasting. The actual ceremony involved pouring water over the segregated groups of men and women, although it is possible that their heads were immersed instead, and anointed with the [[chrism]].&lt;ref name="Kłoczowski2000"/&gt;

==Christianization of Poland==
The baptismal mission which began in the two major cities of Gniezno and Poznań with the baptism of Mieszko and his court spread throughout the country.&lt;ref name="Kłoczowski2000"/&gt; During the 10th and 11th centuries various ecclesiastical organs were established in Poland.&lt;ref name="LukowskiZawadzki2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bardach53-54"/&gt; This included the building of churches and the appointment of clergy.&lt;ref name="LukowskiZawadzki2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kłoczowski2000"/&gt; The first [[List of Bishops of Poznań|Bishop of Poland]], [[Jordan (Bishop of Poland)|Jordan]], was appointed by [[Pope John XIII]] in 968.&lt;ref name="Kłoczowski2000"/&gt; Mieszko's son [[Bolesław I Chrobry]] supported Christianization missions to neighboring lands, notably the mission of future Saint [[Adalbert of Prague]] to [[Old Prussians]], and established the [[Archbishopric of Gniezno]] in the year 1000.&lt;ref name="LERSKI19962"/&gt;

Although at first the Christian religion was "unpopular and alien", Mieszko's baptism was highly influential&lt;ref name="LukowskiZawadzki2006"/&gt; but needed to be enforced by the state, and ran into some [[Pagan reaction in Poland|popular opposition, including an uprising in the 1030s]] (particularly intense in the years of 1035–1037).&lt;ref name="bardach53-54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies2005-57"/&gt; Nonetheless, by that time Poland had won recognition as a proper European state, both from the papacy and from the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Prazmowska2011"/&gt;

Out of various provinces of today's Poland, Christianity's spread was slowest in [[Pomerania]], where it gained a significant following only around the 12th century.&lt;ref name="bardach53-54"/&gt; Initially, the clergy came from the Western Christian European countries; native Polish clergy took three or four generations to emerge, and were supported by the monasteries and friars that grew increasingly common in the 12th century.&lt;ref name="LukowskiZawadzki2006"/&gt; By the 13th century Roman Catholicism had become the dominant religion throughout Poland.&lt;ref name="LukowskiZawadzki2006"/&gt;

In adopting Christianity as the state religion, Mieszko sought to achieve several personal goals.&lt;ref name="bardach53-54"/&gt; He saw Poland's baptism as a way of strengthening his hold on power, as well as using it as a unifying force for the Polish people.&lt;ref name="bardach53-54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LERSKI19962"/&gt; It replaced several smaller cults with a single, central one, clearly associated with the royal court.&lt;ref name="Kłoczowski2000"/&gt; It would also improve the position and respectability of the Polish state on the international, European scene.&lt;ref name="Kłoczowski2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LERSKI19962"/&gt; The Church also helped to strengthen the monarch's authority, and brought to Poland much experience with regard to state administration. Thus, the Church organisation supported the state, and in return, bishops received important government titles (in the later era, they were members of the [[Senate of Poland]]).&lt;ref name="bardach53-54"/&gt;

==Millennial celebrations of 1966==
[[File:Baptism of Poland.Mural in Gniezno.JPG|thumb|250px|Contemporary mural in [[Gniezno]] commemorating the baptism of Poland.]]
The preparations for the millennial celebrations begun with the Great Novena of 1957, which marked a nine years period of fast and prayer. In 1966, the [[People's Republic of Poland]] witnessed large festivities on the 1,000-year anniversary of those events, with the Church celebrating the 1,000 years of Christianity in Poland, while the Communist government celebrated the secular 1,000 years of the Polish State, culminated in twice denying [[Pope Paul VI]] permission to visit Poland that year. The Communist state's desire to separate religion from the state made the festivities a culture clash between the state and the Church. While the Church was focusing on the religious, ecclesiastical aspects of the baptism, with slogans (in Latin) like ''Sacrum Poloniae Millenium'' (Poland's Sacred Millennium) [[Polish United Workers' Party|the Communist Party]] was framing the celebrations as a secular, political anniversary of the creation of the Polish state, with slogans (in Polish) like ''Tysiąclecie Państwa Polskiego'' (A Thousand Years of the Polish State). As [[Norman Davies]] noted, both the Church and the Party had "rival, and mutually exclusive, interpretations of [Poland's baptism] significance."&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;

On 30 July 1966, the [[U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] issued 128,475,000 commemorative stamps honoring the millennium anniversary of the adoption of Christianity in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihobb.com/p/USSTAMPS1278-1896/USSM1313.html U.S. #1313 Polish Millennium MNH] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414045800/http://www.ihobb.com/p/USSTAMPS1278-1896/USSM1313.html |date=14 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coal-water slurry fuel''' is a [[combustion|combustible]] mixture of fine [[coal]] particles suspended in water. It can be used to power boilers, [[gas turbine]]s, [[diesel engine]]s and heating and [[power station]]s.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Водовугілля.png|thumb|right|220px|Coal-water slurry fuel, Grade III]]
A coal-water slurry fuel is defined by a number of factors including its [[viscosity]], particle size, rate of [[sedimentation]], [[ignition temperature]] ({{convert|800|–|850|Celsius|disp=sqbr}}), combustion temperature ({{convert|950|–|1150|Celsius|disp=sqbr}}), ash content and [[calorific value]] (3700–4700&amp;nbsp;[[Calorie|kcal/kg]]).

When coal-water slurry fuel combusts, over ninety-nine percent of its [[carbon]] content is consumed{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}. Coal-water slurry fuel is fire-proof and explosion-proof{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}. Ash content of less than ten percent is desirable for boilers. For diesel engines, there is no limit.

==Production==
[[File:Cws ball mills.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Ball mills for production of coal-water slurry in Russia]]
The production of coal-water slurry fuel involves the crushing of coal or coal sludge to particles between 10 and 65 micrometers diameter (standard crushers can be used); wet milling and homogenisation (with additives as required). The resulting product ([[coal slurry]]) is then prepared for intermediate storage or transport.&lt;ref&gt;[https://avs.globecore.com/water-coal-slurry-alternative-natural-gas-heavy-fuel-oil.html "Water-coal slurry as an alternative to natural gas and heavy fuel oil"]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Large particle coal-water slurry fuel can be used to produce steam in [[boiler]]s. Smaller (under  80 micrometer) particle coal-water slurry fuel can be used in [[diesel engine]]s with or without co-fuels. For example, low speed marine or modular power plant diesels can operate on pure coal-water slurry fuel whereas medium speed diesels such as [[Diesel locomotive|locomotive engines]] may need diesel as a co-fuel which will act as an ignition source. Very small (5 to 10 micrometer) particle coal-water slurry fuel has been trialled in [[combined cycle]] gas turbine power plants. Smaller sized particles are more versatile in use but are more difficult to produce.

==Prototypes==
[[File:Bscap048.jpg|thumb|Combustion of coal water slurry fuel in a steam boiler, [[Murmanskaya]] region, Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vy1Ssy5rWA | title=Горение ВУТ в котле ДКВР-6,5-13. Видео 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Converting coal into a liquid form may simplify the delivery and dispensing of the fuel. It may be a cost-efficient alternative to oil and natural gas. Separating non-carbonaceous material before making the slurry may reduce the production of ash to two percent.

===Belovo Novosibirsk project ===
In the late 1950s, the [[Soviet Union]] looked for new methods of using coal sludge for power generation. Coal-water slurry fuel was made in a [[ball mill]] which pulverised the coal or coal sludge. This was done near a coal mine in [[Belovo, Kemerovo Oblast|Belovo]], [[Siberia]]. The coal-water slurry fuel was transported through a [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] to Novosibirskaya TEC-5, [[Novosibirsk]], a distance of {{convert|262|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The pipeline had three intermediate pumping stations. The Belovo Novosibirsk project used coal-water slurry fuel in steam boilers at a rate of 1340 tonnes per hour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vodougol.ru/en/technology/%d0%b8%d1%81%d1%82%d0%be%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%8f-%d0%b2%d1%83%d1%82-%d0%b2-%d1%80%d0%be%d1%81%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%b8/%d0%b1%d0%b5%d0%bb%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%be-%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%be%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%b1%d0%b8%d1%80%d1%81%d0%ba/ "Belovo-Novosibirsk project."] Vodougol.ru archived 5 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a further project at Belovo Novosibirsk between 1989 and 1993 and development of coal-water slurry fuel technology for [[district heating]] stations and power stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://liquidcoal.ru "ЖИДКИЙ УГОЛЬ; Блог о Водоугольном Топливе."]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712033621/http://liquidcoal.ru/ |date=July 12, 2009 }} Liquidcoal.ru |Accessed 30 March 2013 in Russian.

===Austria===
[[File:CWS production equipment, Austria.jpg|thumbnail|right|220px|Coal water slurry fuel production machine in Austria]]
In 2012, the Austrian company, Effective Energy Technology GmbH (EET) built facilities for production and combustion of coal-water slurry fuel in Europe. Examples of the technology in practice are ''hydroshock'' type wet-milling devices and standard water boilers equipped with swirl pre-chamber and coal-water slurry nozzle.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cwstech.at/ "Coal water slurry production unit"] cwstech.at in English.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/embed/EiYf5c8cCOI?rel=0"CWS production and combustion process"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59iIDBKnpKU "CWS swirl combustion technique"]&lt;/ref&gt; developed by group of companies EET.

'''Doreen Wallace''' (Doreen Eileen Agnew Wallace, married name Rash, 1897 – 22 October 1989) was an English novelist, [[grammar school]] teacher and social campaigner.&lt;ref name="Norfolk" &gt;Norfolk Women in History [https://norfolkwomeninhistory.com/1851-1899/doreen-wallace/ Retrieved 17 September 2018].&lt;/ref&gt; In more than 40 novels she has been seen to explore examples of "comic and tragic cross-purposes between different classes, sexes and generations".&lt;ref name="Feminist" &gt;Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy: ''The Feminist Companion to Literature in English.

==Life==
Born in [[Lorton, Cumbria|Low Lorton]], [[Cumberland]] (now in the [[Cumbria]]n borough of [[Allerdale]]) in 1897, Doreen Wallace was the only child of R. B. Agnew Wallace and his wife Mary Elizabeth, ''née'' Peebles. She was educated at [[Malvern St James|Malvern Girls' College]] and then took an English honours degree course at [[Somerville College, Oxford]]. Her father introduced her to poetry, but also drank heavily and sometimes fought with his wife.&lt;ref name="Moulton" &gt;Mo Moulton: "'All the world was made for you': Talking Back to Ophelia in 1918", ''Feminism'', 3 November 2015 [http://the-toast.net/2015/11/03/talking-back-to-ophelia-1918/ Retrieved 17 September 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orlando" /&gt;

After teaching for a while at [[Diss High School|Diss Grammar School]] in [[Norfolk]], she was married in 1922 to Rowland H. Rash, a long-established farmer and landowner in [[Wortham, Suffolk]]. While they raised three children, she taught part-time for the [[Workers' Educational Association]] and began a writing career that lasted into the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Feminist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Flyleaf" &gt;Flyleaf biography on ''Barnham Rectory'' (Harmondsworth, Middlesex: Penguin, 1939).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orlando" /&gt;

In 1978, two years after writing her last novel, Doreen Wallace returned to live in Diss for the remaining eleven years of her life,&lt;ref name="Norfolk" /&gt; leaving her son Rowland Murray Wallace Rash at Wortham. Of her two daughters, Stella became an artist and Laura farmed in Arizona for many years before returning to Diss.

Doreen Wallace died of bronchopneumonia on 22 October 1989.&lt;ref name="Orlando" /&gt; A biography of her appeared in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;June Shepherd: ''Doreen Wallace, 1897–1989: writer and social campaigner'' (Lewiston, NY/Lampeter: Edwin Mellen Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suffolk Artists" &gt;Suffolk Artists [https://suffolkartists.co.uk/index.cgi?choice=painter&amp;pid=1727 Retrieved 28 September 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace's social campaigning came to the fore in the agricultural depression of the 1930s. Her moves against the imposition of [[tithe]]s led to the stock of two farms being impounded in 1935, a siege at Wortham Manor, confrontation with local [[Blackshirts]], and [[bankruptcy]] in 1939.&lt;ref name="Norfolk" /&gt; The tithe issue led to disagreement and estrangement from [[Dorothy Sayers]], who had been a close friend.&lt;ref name="Feminist" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;June Shepherd in Books and Pictures, 2000 [https://booksandpictures.wordpress.com/2014/08/17/doreen-wallace-1897-1989-writer-and-social-campaigner-book-130/ Retrieved 28 September 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
While recent graduates, Wallace and Eleanore Geach contributed a joint "Ballade of Ladies Who Died for Love" to the volume ''Oxford Poetry 1918'', questioning why a woman would "Seek death to end your misery?/Why did ye not forget your pain/In new loves and new ecstasy?"&lt;ref name="Moulton" /&gt; She also collaborated with Geach on a volume of verses, ''–Esques'', in the same year.&lt;ref name="Feminist" /&gt;

However, novels, agriculture and gardening were to be Wallace's mainstays as a writer. Her first novel, ''A Little Learning'' (1931) has a girl with an Oxford degree escaping from her rough farming family into a dull, loveless marriage. Her 45 novels&lt;ref name="Orlando" /&gt; cover in comic and tragic ways conflicts between different classes, sexes and generations. ''How Little We Know'' (1949) features a retired colonel and his wife failing to notice the danger to their proletarian maid from a genteel lodger. In ''Daughters'' (1955), the middle-class girls are overcome by tedium. ''Woman with a Mirror'' (1963) tells of the downfall of a flirt in a little [[Lake District]] town. ''Barnham Rectory'', an earlier novel (1934), was declared a "choice" by the Book Society.&lt;ref name="Flyleaf" /&gt; Her other novels include ''Even Such Is Time'' (1934),&lt;ref&gt;Kirkus [https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/doreen-wallace/even-such-is-time/ Retrieved 28 September 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Going to Sea'' (1936), ''The Time of Wild Roses'' (1938), ''Green Acres'' (1941), ''The Noble Savage'' (1945), ''Willow Farm'' (1948), ''Sons of Gentlemen'' (1953), ''Daughters'' (1955), ''Woman with a Mirror'' (1963), ''The Mill Pond'' (1966), ''An Earthly Paradise'' (1971) and ''Landscape with Figures'' (1976).&lt;ref name="Norfolk" /&gt;

Wallace has been described as belonging to the Somerville School of novelists, along with [[Vera Brittain]], [[Winifred Holtby]], [[Muriel Jaeger]], [[Margaret Kennedy]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Trudy Morgan-Cole outlining Susan J. Leonardi's study ''Dangerous by Degrees. Women at Oxford and the Somerville College Novelists'' (New Brunswick/London: Rutgers University Press, 1989) [https://compulsiveoverreader.wordpress.com/2011/04/27/dangerous-by-degrees-women-at-oxford-and-the-somerville-college-novelists-by-susan-j-leonardi/ Retrieved 28 September 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace's non-fiction mainly deals with the countryside – ''The Tithe War'' (a vivid account of her activism, 1934), ''East Anglia'' (with R. P. Bagnall-Oakeley, 1939), ''How to Grow Food'' (1940), a gardening diary entitled ''In a Green Shade'' (1950), and ''Outlook for Farming''.&lt;ref name="Norfolk" /&gt; She also wrote for ''The Times'' and the ''Eastern Daily Press'' in this period.&lt;ref name="Orlando" /&gt;

Wallace's poem "Ninety-First Birthday Ode", dated 18 June 1988, includes arguments for the right to die and permitting euthanasia.&lt;ref name="Orlando" /&gt;

Wallace also gained a local reputation as a [[watercolor painting|water-colour painter]].&lt;ref name="Suffolk Artists" /&gt;

[[File:Unteres Ende einer Erdwärmesonde.jpg|thumb|Bottom end of a Downhole heat exchanger]]
[[File:Oberes Ende einer Erdwärmesonde.jpg|thumb|Top end of a Downhole heat exchanger]]

A '''downhole heat exchanger''', (DHE) also called a '''borehole heat exchanger''', (BHE) is a [[heat exchanger]] installed inside a [[borehole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geoheat.oit.edu/bulletin/bull20-3/art1.pdf |title=Downhole Heat Exchangers |publisher=Geo-Heat Center - Oregon Institute of Technology |format=PDF |accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to capture or dissipate heat to or from the ground. DHT's are used for [[geothermal heating]], sometimes with the help of a [[geothermal heat pump]].

==Types==
===U-tube===
The heat exchanger usually consists of one or two u-tubes through which the carrier fluid, usually water, circulates. The space around the u-tubes is filled with groundwater or backfilled with thermally conductive grout.

===Open pipe===
Another design uses a single open pipe to flow water downward. The water then returns through the annular gap between the pipe and the casing. This design provides better thermal contact than u-tubes, but risks contamination by groundwater. Since this involves practically no downhole equipment, these systems usually only go by the name of borehole heat exchangers (BHT).

===Standing column well===
If no casing is installed and groundwater is permitted to charge the system, this arrangement is no longer a BHT, but rather a [[standing column well]].

The '''Fast Auroral Snapshot Explorer''' ('''FAST''') is a [[NASA]] [[plasma physics]] satellite, and is the second spacecraft in the [[Small Explorer program]]. It was launched on August 21, 1996, from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] aboard a [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus XL]] rocket. The spacecraft was designed and built by NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]. Flight operations were handled by Goddard for the first three years, and thereafter were transferred to the [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s [[Space Sciences Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="Pfaff2001"/&gt;

FAST was designed to observe and measure the [[plasma physics]] of the [[aurora]]l phenomena which occur around both of Earth's [[Geographical pole|pole]]s.&lt;ref name="nssdc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1996-049A |title=FAST |work=[[National Space Science Data Center]] |publisher=NASA |accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While its Electric Field Experiment failed around 2002, all other instruments continued to operate normally until science operations were ended on May 1, 2009.&lt;ref name="epo-news"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cse.ssl.berkeley.edu/fast_epo/news.html |title=News &amp; Events |work=FAST Education and Public Outreach |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=September 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various engineering tests were conducted afterward.&lt;ref name="epo-news"/&gt;

'''Fengyun 2-05''', also known as '''Fengyun 2D''' is a [[China|Chinese]] [[weather satellite]] which was launched in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacenews.com/archive/archive08/briefs_0105.html|title=Long March Rocket Lifts Chinese Weather Satellite|publisher=SpaceNews.com|quote=The satellite's predecessors, Fengyun 2-04 and Fengyun 2-05, were launched in 2004 and 2006, respectively.|accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the fourth satellite to be launched of the [[Fengyun 2]] series, and the second operational spacecraft. It is part of the [[Fengyun]] programme.

A [[Long March 3A]] carrier rocket was used to launch Fengyun 2-05, flying from [[Xichang Launch Area 2|Launch Area 2]] at the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Centre]]. The launch took place at 00:53 UTC (08:53 CST) on 8 December 2006,&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the carrier rocket placing the satellite into a [[geosynchronous transfer orbit]].

The '''Genoese map''' is a 1457 [[world map]].  The map relied extensively on the account of the traveler to Asia [[Niccolo da Conti]], rather than the usual source of [[Marco Polo]].&lt;ref name="Whitfield1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Whitfield|1998|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author is not known, but is a more modern development than the [[Fra Mauro map|Fra Mauro world map]], with fairly good proportions given to each continents.  The map also depicts a three-masted European ship in the [[Indian Ocean]], something which had not occurred yet at the time.&lt;ref name="Whitfield1998" /&gt;

A Genoese flag in the upper northwest corner of the map establishes this map’s origin, along with the coat of arms of the Spinolas, a prominent Genoese mercantile family. Niccolò de'Conti was from a noble mercantile family; at an early age he decided to follow in the family tradition by establishing a lucrative trading operation in the East.[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/niccolo-de-conti]

The Genoese map’s sea monsters reflect the cartographer’s interest in exotic wonders, which is everywhere in evidence on the map, and typical of the scientific outlook of the early modern period, which was driven by curiosity and took a great interest in marvels. The demon-like monster in particular is evidence of the cartographer’s research in recent travel literature to find sea monsters for his map.

This map was done in rich color and was not made particularly used for anything but for display.They say this map was sent to the Portuguese court in 1474 and then to Columbus and this is the map that he used to travel the India sea to the Atlantic but was never proven. The map is now the property of the Italian government and is to be found in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale of Florence however the map was not taken care of due to the way it’s been handled throughout the years.

The ships that could carry a thousand men—six hundred seamen and four hundred soldiers. The larger vessels also carried small boats, which were used, as Marco Polo states, “to lay out the anchors, catch fish, bring supplies aboard, and the like. When the ship is under sail, she carries these boats slung to her side.” Many of the vessels had as many as four decks, and even the smaller ones, fifty or sixty cabins. Vegetables, we are told, were sometimes grown on board.

The oval form is not unknown among medieval maps. Hugh of Saint Victor had described the world as being the shape of Noah’s Ark, and Ranulf Higden world maps were oval. A standard way of describing the earth was to compare it to an egg. The main purpose of the analogy seems to have been to describe the various spheres surrounding the earth (egg white, shell), but the idea of an egg shape could have been derived from these works. Another possibility is that the oval form represents the ''mandorla'', or nimbus, which surrounded Christ in many medieval works of art.

'''German H.H. Emory''' (1882–1918) was a prominent American lawyer and soldier from [[Baltimore]].&lt;ref name="Archives of MD- German HH Emory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Archives of MD- German HH Emory|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/014300/014345/html/14345bio.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] "for extraordinary heroism in action while serving with the 3rd Battalion, 320th Infantry Regiment, 80th Division, American Expeditionary Forces, near Sommerance, France November 1, 1918."  &lt;ref name="homeofheroes.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=WW1 US Army Recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross|url=http://www.homeofheroes.com/members/02_DSC/citatons/01_wwi_dsc/dsc_05wwi_Army_A.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was killed in action in the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]], in the waning days of  [[World War I]]. He is commemorated with a memorial painting and two memorial sculptures in Maryland courthouses.

== Birth and education ==

German H.H. Emory was born on September 27, 1882, in Murner's Branch, [[Allegany County, Maryland|Allegany County]], Maryland. His father, William Hopper Emory (1849–1908), was an insurance broker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr. Wm. H. Emory Dead: Insurance Broker was a Son-In-Law of Late German H, Hunt|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=Jan 10, 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother was Eleanor Louisa Hunt (1851–1927). He grew up at 1403 West Lanvale Street in Baltimore, which is now the site of Harlem Park Middle School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Federal Census, 1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Emory Family has deep roots on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Arthur Emory, Sr. (c. 1640-1699) arrived in Maryland in the 1660s. In 1667 he is reputed to have received from Lord Baltimore several land grants on the Wye, Choptank, and Chester rivers on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes &amp; Wright, editors|title=Colonial Families of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Vol. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Poplar Grove Plantation, near Centreville, Maryland, is the ancestral home of the Emorys.  It lies on Spaniard Neck, a peninsula on the south side of the Chester River in Queen Anne's County, just above the mouth of the Corsica River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In A Crumbling House, A Trove Of Everyday History|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92190792}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the [[C.V. Starr Center for the Study of the American Experience]] is overseeing the Poplar Grove Project, an ongoing exploration of the Emory family's papers, in conjunction with the Maryland State Archives. To date, over 28,406 documents have been recovered and scanned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poplar Grove Project: Details on the Trove of Recently Discovered Historic Documents|url=http://washingtoncollegenews.blogspot.com/2008/06/poplar-grove-project-details-on-trove.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Emory family produced two celebrated military men in the 19th century: Col. Thomas Emory, (1782-1842),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Emory from Maryland State Archives|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc5400/sc5496/051300/051322/html/51322bio.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and one of his sons, General [[William H. Emory]].

German was named after his maternal grandfather, German Horton Hunt (1828–1907), a leading Baltimore manufacturer of the 19th century, whose  [[Poole and Hunt Company Buildings|Poole and Hunt Engineering and Machine Company]] produced machinery and castings for a worldwide market from 1853 to 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poole and Hunt Clipper Mill Facilities Renovation|url=http://www.spearsvotta.com/projects/clipper_mill_redevelopment.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Emory was educated in Baltimore, at [[The Hill School]], near Pottstown, Pennsylvania, and at St. Luke's School in Philadelphia. He then entered the [[University of Maryland School of Law]], the second oldest law school in the country. While there he joined the Eta Chapter of [[Phi Sigma Kappa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Eta Chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa at the University of Maryland |url=http://pskumd.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212010723/http://www.pskumd.com/ |archivedate=2013-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  a social fraternity, and became the 51st member to sign the Eta Chapter Roll. Graduating from the law school earlier than others, he was forced to wait until his twenty-first birthday to be admitted to the Maryland Bar in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maryland Courts|url=http://www.courts.state.md.us/ble/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriage and family ==
[[File:Lucy Imogen Stump Emory 1883-1978.jpg|thumb|The Major's wife, Lucy Stump Emory, lived for another 60 years after her husband was killed. She saw her three sons grow up, get married and give her 10 grandchildren. She never remarried. Her unmarried sister, May Goldsborough Stump, lived with her sister, Lucy, for 50 years until May's death in 1967.]]

Emory married Lucy Imogen Stump (1883–1978) on June 15, 1907, in Baltimore. Lucy was also from Baltimore.

The Stump Family had been in Maryland since Colonial times, and were active in the [[Susquehanna River]] area, Western Maryland, and Baltimore in milling, mining, and banking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Susquehanna State Park History |url=http://www.dnr.maryland.gov/centennial/Susquehanna_History.asp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124185003/http://www.dnr.maryland.gov/centennial/Susquehanna_History.asp |archivedate=2010-11-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also birthed a Confederate Brigadier General, [[James J. Archer]].

One of Lucy's three sisters, Anna Abell Stump, married William Lee Rawls,  "one of the most prominent attorneys in Baltimore",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordon|first=David|title=Going off the Rawls|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/going-off-the-rawls/|publisher=The American Conservative|accessdate=July 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gave birth to five sons, including philosopher [[John Rawls]].

German and Lucy had three boys.&lt;ref name="issuu"&gt;{{cite web|last=Criscuoli|first=Joseph|title=The One We Lost, A Story of Honor and Sacrifice in Remembrance of Veterans Day, published in The THIRD DEGREE - The Journal of the Eta Alumni Association of Phi Sigma Kappa - Winter 2010 Issue, page 28|url=http://issuu.com/jcriscuoli/docs/winter2010#}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their oldest son, German H. H. Emory, Jr. (1910–1980), became the president of the Riegel Textile Company in New York City &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief History of Riegel Textile, Division of Mount Vernon Mills|url=http://www.mvmdenim.com/history/1900s.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  German and Lucy's second son, Richard Woollen Emory (1913–2003), followed his father into the law and practiced for many years in Maryland at [[Venable LLP|Venable, Baetjer and Howard]] in Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Emory, 89, lawyer who led panel to ban slot machines|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=June 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The major's third son, Morris Soper Emory (1915–2000), was named after Judge Soper, and worked in the insurance business and lived in Philadelphia most of his life.

Lucy Emory remained a widow for 60 years until her death in 1978.

== Practice of law ==

Emory began the practice of law with the firm of Slingluff &amp; Slingluff from 1903 to 1906, moving to private practice from 1906 to 1907. In 1908, Emory became a principal in the law firm of Johnson, Emory, Olmstead and Cator.  During this period, in 1910, he also served as Assistant City Solicitor for Baltimore City, serving under [[Edgar Allan Poe (Maryland attorney general)|Edgar Allan Poe]], the second cousin of the [[Edgar Allan Poe|famous American writer]]. In 1911, Emory formed a partnership with Morris A. Soper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judge Morris Ames Soper obituary|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1715&amp;dat=19630309&amp;id=z5I8AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7SkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=918,33052413}}&lt;/ref&gt; who would soon become the Chief Judge of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judge Soper from Maryland Archives|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/013500/013516/html/13516bio.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Judge Soper ascended to the bench in 1913, Emory made the final change of his legal career, becoming a member of the firm of Frank, Emory &amp; Beeuwkes.&lt;ref name="Archives of MD- German HH Emory"/&gt;
On January 8, 1919, The Supreme Bench of Baltimore held memorial proceedings for the six Baltimore lawyers killed in the First World War. Asked to speak about German Emory was [[Albert Ritchie|Albert Cabell Ritchie]], then the Attorney General of Maryland, and soon to become the longest-serving governor in Maryland's history. Mr. Ritchie reflected in part, "Emory's knowledge of the law was broad. His advice was sound. His trial practice, at nisi prius and in the appellate courts, was very large. He was a born lawyer, broadened and developed by constant study and application and by tireless industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=H.H. Walker|title=Round Table Reminiscences: German Horton Hunt Emory, Sept 27, 1881- Nov. 1, 1918|journal=Maryland Bar Journal|date=Fall 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his speech about German Emory at another memorial service held in 1933 for the Six Members of the Baltimore Bar who were killed in the First World War, organized by the German H.H.Emory Post of the American Legion and held in the Baltimore City Courtroom, Chief Judge Samuel K. Dennis, of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore  recollected, "Emory was an especially gifted lawyer. Ready, suave, cool, democratic and magnetic, he captured courts and juries, made converts to his cause. He loved his profession and was signally successful in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Memorial Services Held in Honor of Members of Bar who Died in World War|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=May 30, 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered one of the best trial lawyers in the city.&lt;ref name="Criscuoli"&gt;{{cite web|last=Criscuoli|first=Joseph|title=The One We Lost, A Story of Honor and Sacrifice in Remembrance of Veterans Day, published in The THIRD DEGREE - The Journal of the Eta Alumni Association of Phi Sigma Kappa - Winter 2010 Issue, page 30|url=http://issuu.com/jcriscuoli/docs/winter2010#}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Business also engaged Emory in 1914 as vice-president of Poole Engineering and Machine Company, his grandfather's old enterprise. During this period the Poole Company made, among other products, coastal defense artillery mountings and base rings for battleship turret guns in its Hampden/Woodberry facilities. They also established a rural ammunition loading works outside the city in Texas, Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGrain|first=John W.|title=From Pig Iron to Cotton Duck: A History of Manufacturing Villages in Baltimore County|year=1985|publisher=Baltimore County Public Library|location=Towson, MD.|isbn=978-0937076019|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Emory was offered the Democratic nomination for Judge of the Supreme Court in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Favor Emory for Judge: Movement Started for his Nomination to Succeed Stanton|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=Jan 14, 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had entertained for several years an ambition to go on the bench, but he declined to become a candidate, stating to the lawyers who called on him to offer political support that he expected to enter the US Army. It was at that time that he had applied for acceptance to the first Officer's Camp at Fort Myer, Virginia, in order to participate in the training that would take him to a position of leadership in the US Army.&lt;ref name="Criscuoli"/&gt;

== Military career ==
[[File:Major German H H Emory 1916.jpg|thumbnail|left|On March 7, 1918 Captain Emory was promoted to Major and placed in command of the Third Battalion, 320th Infantry Regiment, attached to the 80th Division of the American Expeditionary Forces.]]

Emory was a strong advocate of America's entrance into the war. In April of 1917, Emory was present at the Capital when President Wilson went to Congress to ask for a declaration of war. Emory contended that it was his duty to fight for the principles that he upheld, and he was one of the first Marylanders to volunteer.
Captain Thomas H. Westlake, of Cleveland, said, "Emory had something unusual in him because of the fact that he had volunteered at the age of almost 40, with a wife and three children dependant upon him."  Emory's explanation was, "My country was my idol! To it I sacrificed every selfish, every endearing sentiment." &lt;ref name="Criscuoli"/&gt;

=== Fort Myer and Fort Lee ===

While at [[Fort Myer]], Virginia Emory acted as a correspondent for [[the Baltimore Sun]]. His series of five articles, entitled "Reports from a Rookie" and carrying his byline, appeared from time to time in the Sun, and explained many details of camp life and the rigors of military training of the day. In his first such report, published on May 20, 1917, Emory wrote, "One coming to camp is struck, instantly, by the type of men Uncle Sam has taken under his care for the next three months, and to whom he will entrust the training of the first army of 500,000. There are quite a number of men between the ages of 30 and 40, but the great majority are from 20 to 30. They are all fine, upstanding fellows, and most of them have had college educations. Many of the men are married and many were doing well in civil life before coming here. They fully appreciated what it would mean for a man to leave his family, friends and business for an indefinite period, and it makes a fellow feel proud of being an American when he glances about and thinks for a moment of the sacrifices voluntarily assumed by the 2,500 men here and the 38,000 men at the other training camps." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Emory|first=German H.|title=Reports from a Rookie|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=May 20, 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, in his second report, Emory wrote, "The men now know that this country will immediately begin to play a man's part in the war; that our present assistance to the Allies will be not merely money and munitions, but troops, standing shoulder to shoulder with the armies of France and England." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Emory|first=German HH|title=Reports from a Rookie|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=May 26, 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major Emory was one of the few men who came out of the first officers' training camp with the rank of Captain. He was subsequently ordered to [[Camp Lee]], Virginia, where he spent nearly a year. On March 7, 1918 Captain Emory was promoted to Major and placed in command of the Third Battalion, 320th Infantry Regiment, attached to the 80th Division of the American Expeditionary Forces. Two months later, on May 17, 1918, the 80th began to leave Camp Lee, heading for Newport News, Virginia and embarkation. When troops were being rushed to France, the 23,000 soldiers of the 80th Division were sent "over there," arriving in St. Nazaire, Bordeaux and Brest on June 8, 1918.

=== France ===

The assembly point for the division was [[Calais]], from which it departed early in June for training with the British Army in Artois and Picardy, France, and subsequently participated in the initial phases of the Somme Offensive. From there, 80th Division troops were abruptly moved to St. Mihiel for the first American Army offensive, serving under General John J. "Black Jack" Pershing. General Pershing praised the actions of the [[80th Division (United States)|80th Division]] for having gained all of their battle objectives. General Cronkhite, in command of the 80th, recognized his men with the statement, "The 80th Only Moves Forward", the motto that has marked the Division since 1918.

Commencing September 14, the division moved into the Argonne region and began its preparations for the offensive in that region during the period September 26 through November 11. One day before Major Emory's birthday, in conjunction with other American divisions, the 80th attacked at Bethincourt, advancing through the hell that was trench warfare a distance of nine kilometers in two days. Major Emory received the American Expeditionary Forces Citation for Gallantry in Action, for rallying the men of the 320th Regiment under terrific machine gun fire in action in the Bois des Ogons, France on September 26, 1918.

On September 29 the 80th Division was relieved and assembled in the vicinity of Cuisy, where on October 4 it again attacked, and over difficult ground attained a distance of four kilometers in nine days.  On October 12 the division was again relieved and proceeded by march and bus to the Thiaucourt area where it was re-equipped.

At [[Thiaucourt-Regniéville|Thiacourt]], the U.S. Army troops began using Springfield and Browning Automatic Rifles. Prior to that, British Enfields and French Cha Chat automatics had been used. With barely three weeks training with the newer rifles, the 80th troops were thrust into the third and final phase of the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]]. The 80th Division was the only one that saw action during each phase of that offensive.

On October 29, Emory's Regiment entered the line at St. Georges-St. Juvin and began preparation for what would be its last assault on the German lines.

At 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on the evening of the 31st, Major Emory moved out with the battalion to take up their positions for the "jumping off" point along the St. Juvin-St. Georges road. At 1:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. on November 1, Emory signaled back to Regimental Headquarters, "The Omnibus is Full" - the signal that the Battalion was in position. At 3:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. the Allied artillery barrage began, answered almost immediately by an enemy counter-barrage, reported later as the heaviest in all of the war. A slight cessation of the barrage, at 4:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., was accompanied by word that the Germans were advancing. At 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. the ground assault began.&lt;ref name="Lukens"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lukens|first=Edward C.|title=A Blue Ridge Memoir|url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL6652702M/A_Blue_Ridge_memoir|work="The Last Drive and Death of Major G. H. H. Emory"|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Armistice ===
In the Argonne Forest outside Romagne, France, at 8:15 in the morning on November 1, 1918, just ten days before the Armistice, and just five days before the 320th Regiment would be relieved, Major German H. H. Emory died of machine gun wounds sustained while directing his battalion in their role as the assaulting unit in an attack that ultimately ended the war.&lt;ref name="Lukens"/&gt;

== Death and awarding of DSC ==

For his valor on the field of battle, Major Emory was honored by General of the Armies [[John J. Pershing|John J. "Black Jack" Pershing]] with the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]]. This is the second highest military decoration awarded to a member of the United States Army for extreme gallantry and risk of life in actual combat with an armed enemy force. The citation reads, "The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pride in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross (Posthumously) to German H. H. Emory, Major, U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in action while serving with the 3rd Battalion, 320th Infantry Regiment, [[80th Division (United States)|80th Division]], [[American Expeditionary Forces]], near [[Sommerance]], November 1, 1918. On the morning of November 1st, 1918, the 3rd Battalion, 320th Infantry had advanced under heavy enemy artillery and machine gun fire to the north slope of the Ravine Aux Pierres, north of the St. Juvin - St. Georges Road.  The crest of the slope was being swept with a murderous machine gun fire and the advance of the battalion was momentarily checked. Without care for his personal safety and inspired only by the thought that his battalion must go forward, Major Emory, though exposed to direct machine gun fire and in plain view of the enemy, calmly moved back and forth along his whole front encouraging his troops and personally directing the attack. By his magnificent example of coolness and bravery, he so encouraged and inspired the men of his command that they held this very exposed position and finally succeeded in overcoming enemy resistance." &lt;ref name="homeofheroes.com"/&gt;

== Burial ==

Originally Major Emory was buried in a little courtyard in the demolished town of St. Juvin, a small wooden cross with his name, rank, regiment and date of death marking his resting place. At the time of his death he was just 36 years old. Later his body was moved and re-interred at the [[Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery and Memorial]] (also known as the Argonne American Cemetery), along with 14,245 other American comrades from the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] (AEF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Major German HH Emory Grave Location|url=http://www.abmc.gov/search/wwi.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most lost their lives during the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]], which was the largest battle in American military history, involving 1.2 million American troops and was the principal engagement of the United States in WW 1.  It lasted from September 26 to the [[Armistice with Germany]] on November 11, 1918.

[[File:Gonâve microplate.png|thumb|500px|The '''Gonâve microplate''', showing the fault zones that bound it]]
The '''Gonâve Microplate''' forms part of the boundary between the [[North American Plate]] and the [[Caribbean Plate]]. It is bounded to the west by the [[Cayman Trough|Cayman]] [[spreading center]], to the north by the [[Septentrional-Oriente fault zone]] and to the south by the [[Walton fault zone]] and the [[Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone]]. The existence of this [[List of tectonic plates#Tertiary plates|microplate]] was first proposed in 1991.&lt;ref name="Rosencrantz"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1991)019&lt;0690:SIMOTF&gt;2.3.CO;2|last=Rosencrantz|first=E.|author2=Mann P.|year=1991|title=SeaMARC II mapping of transform faults in the Cayman Trough, Caribbean Sea|journal=Geology|volume=19|issue=7|pages=690–693|url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/7/690|accessdate=7 February 2010|bibcode = 1991Geo....19..690R }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been confirmed by [[GPS]] measurements, which show that the overall displacement between the two main plates is split almost equally between the [[transform fault]] zones that bound the Gonâve microplate.&lt;ref name="DeMets"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.03236.x|last=DeMets|first=C.|author2=Wiggins-Grandison W.|year=2007|title=Deformation of Jamaica and motion of the Gonâve microplate from GPS and seismic data|journal=[[Geophysical Journal International]]|volume=168|issue=1|pages=362–378|url=http://www.mona.uwi.edu/earthquake/files/DeformJaGPS2007.pdf|accessdate=7 December 2011|bibcode = 2007GeoJI.168..362D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The microplate is expected to eventually become [[Accretion (geology)|accreted]] to the North American Plate.&lt;ref name="Mann"/&gt;

==Geographic extent==
The Gonâve Microplate is an approximately 1,100&amp;nbsp;km long strip, consisting mainly of [[oceanic crust]] of the Cayman Trough but including [[island arc]] material at its eastern end on the western part of [[Hispaniola]].&lt;ref name="Rosencrantz"/&gt; Further east a separate ''Hispaniola microplate'' has been identified.&lt;ref name="Mann2"&gt;

|bibcode=2002Tecto..21.1057M}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its western end, the Gonâve Microplate is bounded by the mid-Cayman spreading centre. To the north it is bounded by the Septentrional-Oriente fault zone and to the south by a more complex [[Fault (geology)#Strike-slip faults|strike-slip fault]] system that includes the Walton fault and the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone. As the northern and southern boundaries approach the eastern edge of the Caribbean Plate they become less distinct and the eastern boundary is not as well defined.

==Evidence for existence==
The presence of a separate Gonâve Microplate was first suggested by the analysis of [[sidescan sonar]] results from the Cayman Trough.&lt;ref name="Rosencrantz"/&gt; This study found evidence for continuous transform type faults along the southern flank of the trough, to both sides of the spreading centre. [[GPS]] data supports the existence of the microplate by showing that the relative motion between the North American and Caribbean plates is split almost equally between the two bounding transform fault systems.&lt;ref name="DeMets"/&gt; Comparison of these rates with observations of [[Magnetic anomaly|magnetic stripes]] within the Cayman Trough suggests that displacement is increasingly being transferred from the northern fault system to the southern one. This observation is consistent with the eventual accretion of the Gonâve Microplate to the North American Plate.

==History==
The Gonâve Microplate began to form in the [[Early Eocene]] after the northern part of the leading edge of the Caribbean Plate (present day [[Cuba]]) collided with the [[Bahama Banks|Bahamas platform]].&lt;ref name="Leroy"&gt;

|bibcode=2000GeoJI.141..539L }}&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the plate was unable to move further to the east and a transform fault system developed to the south, effectively cutting off this northern area and accreting it to the North American Plate. A large left-stepping offset formed along this zone just east of the Yucatán peninsula creating a [[pull-apart basin]], which continued to [[Extensional tectonics#Releasing bends along strike-slip faults|extend]] until the onset of seafloor spreading, creating the Cayman spreading centre. Further movement on this fault system created the Cayman Trough, although at that time the future microplate was still firmly attached to the Caribbean Plate. During the [[Late Miocene]], the part of the Caribbean Plate formed by [[Hispaniola]] began to collide with the Bahamas platform and a new strike-slip fault system developed through Jamaica and southern Hispaniola, the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone, isolating part of the Cayman Trough and the central part of Hispaniola to form the Gonâve microplate.&lt;ref name="Leroy"/&gt; It has been suggested that the Gonave microplate will also become accreted to the North American Plate, as all the plate boundary displacement transfers onto the southern fault system.&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;

The '''International Ultraviolet Explorer''' ('''IUE''') was an astronomical [[observatory]] [[satellite]] primarily designed to take [[ultraviolet]] [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]]. The satellite was a collaborative project between [[NASA]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Science and Engineering Research Council|Science Research Council]] and the [[ESA|European Space Agency (ESA)]]. The mission was first proposed in early 1964, by a group of scientists in the United Kingdom, and was launched on January 26, 1978 aboard a NASA [[Delta rocket]]. The mission lifetime was initially set for 3 years, but in the end it lasted almost 18 years, with the satellite being shut down in 1996. The switch-off occurred for financial reasons, while the telescope was still functioning at near original efficiency.

It was the first space observatory to be operated in real time by astronomers who visited the groundstations in the United States and [[Europe]]. Astronomers made over 104,000 observations using the IUE, of objects ranging from [[solar system]] bodies to distant [[quasar]]s. Among the significant scientific results from IUE data were the first large scale studies of [[stellar wind]]s, accurate measurements of the way [[interstellar dust]] absorbs light, and measurements of the [[supernova]] [[SN1987A]] which showed that it defied stellar evolution theories as they then stood. When the mission ended, it was considered the most successful astronomical satellite ever.&lt;ref name="ESA Science &amp; Technology: Summary"&gt;[http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=31284 ESA Science &amp; Technology: Summary].

==History==

===Motivation===

The [[human eye]] can perceive light with wavelengths between roughly 350 (violet) and 700 (red) [[nanometres]]. [[Ultraviolet]] light has wavelengths between roughly 10&amp;nbsp;nm and 350&amp;nbsp;nm. UV light can be harmful to human beings, and is strongly absorbed by the [[ozone layer]]. This makes it impossible to observe UV emission from [[astronomical objects]] from the ground. Many types of object emit copious quantities of UV radiation, though: the hottest and most massive stars in the universe can have surface temperatures high enough that the vast majority of their light is emitted in the UV. [[Active Galactic Nuclei]], [[accretion disk]]s, and [[supernovae]] all emit UV radiation strongly, and many [[chemical elements]] have strong [[absorption line]]s in the UV, so that UV absorption by the [[interstellar medium]] provides a powerful tool for studying its composition.

UV astronomy was impossible before the [[Space Age]], and some of the first [[space telescope]]s were UV telescopes designed to observe this previously inaccessible region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. One particular success was the second [[Orbiting Astronomical Observatory]], which had a number of 20&amp;nbsp;cm UV telescopes on board. It was launched in 1968, and took the first UV observations of 1200 objects, mostly stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Second Catalog of Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 2 Filter Photometry: Ultraviolet Photometry of 614 Stars|doi=10.1086/300955|date=1999|last1=Meade|first1=Marilyn R.|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=118|issue=2|pages=1073–1085|bibcode = 1999AJ....118.1073M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of OAO-2 motivated astronomers to consider larger missions.

===Conception===

[[File:Control console.jpg|right|thumb|A shell of a control and display unit for the International Ultraviolet explorer satellite, preserved in the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]].]]
The orbiting ultraviolet satellite which ultimately became the IUE mission was first proposed in 1964 by British astronomer [[Robert Wilson (astronomer)|Robert Wilson]].&lt;ref name="rsbm"&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1098/rsbm.2004.0024|title= Sir Robert Wilson CBE. 16 April 1927 – 2 September 2002: Elected F.R.S. 1975|date= 2004|last1= Jordan|first1= C.|journal= Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society|volume= 50|pages= 367–386}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Space Research Organisation]] was planning a ''Large Astronomical Satellite'', and had sought proposals from the astronomical community for its aims and design. Wilson headed a British team which proposed an ultraviolet [[spectrograph]], and their design was recommended for acceptance in 1966.

However, management problems and cost overruns led to the cancellation of the LAS program in 1968.&lt;ref name="rsbm" /&gt; Wilson's team scaled down their plans and submitted a more modest proposal to ESRO, but this was not selected as the Cosmic Ray satellite was given precedence. Rather than give up on the idea of an orbiting UV telescope, they instead sent their plans to [[NASA]] administrator [[Leo Goldberg]], and in 1973 the plans were approved. The proposed telescope was renamed the ''International Ultraviolet Explorer''.&lt;ref name="rsbm" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/products/journals/aag/AAG_Feb03/aag_44134.htm Sir Robert Wilson 1927–2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517005319/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/products/journals/aag/AAG_Feb03/aag_44134.htm |date=2011-05-17 }}. Blackwell Synergy. Obituaries&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design and aims===

The telescope was designed from the start to be operated in real time, rather than by remote control. This required that it would be launched into a [[geosynchronous orbit]] – that is, one with a period equal to one [[sidereal day]] of 23h 56m. A satellite in such an orbit remains visible from a given point on the Earth's surface for many hours at a time, and can thus transmit to a single ground station for a long period of time. Most space observatories in Earth orbit, such as the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], are in a low orbit in which they spend most of their time operating autonomously because only a small fraction of the Earth's surface can see them at a given time. Hubble, for example, orbits the Earth at an altitude of approximately 600&amp;nbsp;km, while a geosynchronous orbit has an average altitude of 36,000&amp;nbsp;km.

As well as allowing continuous communication with ground stations, a geosynchronous orbit also allows a larger portion of the sky to be viewed continuously. Because the distance from Earth is greater, the Earth occupies a much smaller portion of the sky as seen from the satellite than it does from low Earth orbit.

[[File:IUE-IRAS-comet.gif|thumb|[[Comet IRAS–Araki–Alcock]] was the 7th comet discovered in 1983. This figure combines an FES image showing its diffuse tail and the long-wavelength redundant (LWR) spectrum depicting the molecular emission lines of sulfur (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and hydroxyl (OH).]]

A launch into a geosynchronous orbit requires much more energy for a given weight of payload than a launch into [[low Earth orbit]]. This meant that the telescope had to be relatively small, with a 45&amp;nbsp;cm primary mirror, and a total weight of 312&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="Nature 1978"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The IUE spacecraft and instrumentation|date=1978|doi=10.1038/275372a0|last1=Boggess|first1=A.|last2=Carr|first2=F.

The largest ground-based telescope, the [[Gran Telescopio Canarias]], has a primary mirror 10.4 m across. A smaller mirror means less light-gathering power, and less spatial resolution, compared to a larger mirror.

The stated aims of the telescope at the start of the mission were:&lt;ref name="ESA-aims"&gt;[http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=31288 ESA Science &amp; Technology: Objectives]. Sci.esa.int (2003-07-09). Retrieved on 2011-08-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

* To obtain high-resolution spectra of stars of all spectral types to determine their physical characteristics
* To study gas streams in and around binary star system
* To observe faint stars, galaxies and quasars at low resolution, interpreting these spectra by reference to high-resolution spectra
* To observe the spectra of planets and comets
* To make repeated observations of objects with variable spectra
* To study the modification of starlight caused by interstellar dust and gas

===Construction and engineering===

[[File:IUEtelescope-schema.png|thumb|Simplified optical diagram of the telescope]]

The telescope was constructed as a joint project between NASA, ESRO (which became [[ESA]] in 1975) and the UK [[Science and Engineering Research Council]]. SERC provided the Vidicon cameras for the spectrographs as well as software for the scientific instruments. ESA provided the [[Photovoltaic module|solar array]]s to power the spacecraft as well as a ground observing facility in [[VILSPA|Villafranca del Castillo]], Spain. NASA contributed the telescope, spectrograph, and spacecraft as well as launching facilities and a second ground observatory in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]] at the [[GSFC|Goddard Space Flight Center]].

According to the agreement setting up the project the observing time would be divided between the contributing agencies with 2/3 to NASA, 1/6 to ESA and 1/6 to the UK's Science Research Council.

===Mirror===

The telescope mirror was a reflector of the [[Ritchey-Chretien]] type, which has [[hyperbola|hyperbolic]] primary and secondary mirrors. The primary was 45&amp;nbsp;cm across. The telescope was designed to give high quality images over a 16 [[arcminute]] field of view (about half the apparent diameter of the Sun or Moon). The primary mirror was made of [[beryllium]], and the secondary of [[fused silica]] – materials chosen for their light weight, moderate cost, and optical quality.

===Instruments===
[[File:IUEasembled.jpg|thumb|Fully assembled IUE with the telescope tube on top and solar panel extended]]

The instrumentation on board consisted of the Fine Error Sensors (FES), which were used for pointing and guiding the telescope, a high resolution and a low resolution [[spectrograph]], and four detectors.

There were two Fine Error Sensors (FES), and their first purpose was to image the field of view of the telescope in visible light. They could detect stars down to 14th [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]], about 1500 times fainter than can be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The image was transmitted to the ground station, where the observer would verify that the telescope was pointing at the correct field, and then acquire the exact object to be observed. If the object to be observed was fainter than 14th magnitude, the observer would point the telescope at a star that could be seen, and then apply "blind" offsets, determined from the coordinates of the objects. The accuracy of the pointing was generally better than 2 [[arcseconds]] for blind offsets &lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.stsci.edu/iue/instrument/obs_guide/node16.html#SECTION00660000000000000000 3.6 Blind Offsets and Faint Object Acquisition]. Archive.stsci.edu (1996-09-30). Retrieved on 2011-08-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The FES acquisition images were the telescope's only imaging capability; for UV observations, it only recorded [[Astronomical spectroscopy|spectra]]. For this, it was equipped with two spectrographs. They were called the Short Wavelength Spectrograph and the Long Wavelength Spectrograph, and covered wavelength ranges of 115 to 200 nanometres and 185 to 330&amp;nbsp;nm respectively. Each spectrograph had both high and low resolution modes, with [[spectral resolution]]s of 0.02 and 0.6&amp;nbsp;nm respectively.&lt;ref name="MAST instrument description"&gt;[http://archive.stsci.edu/iue/instrument.html MAST IUE Scientific Instrument]. Archive.stsci.edu (2007-01-09). Retrieved on 2011-08-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spectrographs could be used with either of two apertures. The larger aperture was a slot with a field of view roughly 10 &amp;times; 20 arcsec; the smaller aperture was a circle about 3 arcsec in diameter. The quality of the telescope optics was such that [[point source]]s appeared about 3 arcsec across, so use of the smaller aperture required very accurate pointing, and it did not necessarily capture all of the light from the object. The larger aperture was therefore most commonly used, and the smaller aperture only used when the larger field of view would have contained unwanted emission from other objects.&lt;ref name="MAST instrument description" /&gt;

There were two cameras for each spectrograph, one designated the primary and the second being redundant in case of failure of the first. The cameras were named LWP, LWR, SWP and SWR where P stands for prime, R for redundant and LW/SW for long/short wavelength. The cameras were [[television camera]]s, sensitive only to visible light, and light gathered by the telescope and spectrographs first fell on a UV-to-visible converter. This was a [[caesium]]-[[tellurium]] cathode, which was inert when exposed to visible light, but which gave off electrons when struck by UV photons due to the [[photoelectric effect]]. The electrons were then detected by the TV cameras. The signal could be integrated for up to many hours, before being transmitted to Earth at the end of the exposure.&lt;ref name="Nature 1978" /&gt;

==Mission==
[[File:Delta 2914 launching IUE spacecraft.jpg|thumb|Delta 2914 launching IUE spacecraft on Jan. 26, 1978 from Cape Canaveral]]

===Launch===
The IUE was launched from [[Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]] on a [[Delta rocket]], on 26 January 1978.&lt;ref name="MAST history"&gt;[http://archive.stsci.edu/iue/history.html MAST IUE Early History]. Archive.stsci.edu. Retrieved on 2011-08-07.&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched into a [[transfer orbit]], from which its on-board rockets fired it into its planned geosynchronous orbit. The orbit was inclined by 28.6° to the Earth's equator, and had an [[orbital eccentricity]] of 0.24, meaning that the satellite's distance from Earth varied between 25,669&amp;nbsp;km and 45,887&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="Nature 1978" /&gt; The [[ground track]] was initially centred at a longitude of approximately 70 degrees W.

===Commissioning===

The first 60 days of the mission were designated as the commissioning period. This was divided into three main stage. Firstly, as soon as its instruments were switched on, the IUE observed a small number of high priority objects, to ensure that some data had been taken in the event of an early failure. The first spectrum, of the star [[Eta Ursae Majoris]], was taken for calibration purposes three days after launch.&lt;ref name="MAST history" /&gt; The first science observations targeted objects including the [[Moon]], the planets from [[Mars]] to [[Uranus]], hot stars including [[Eta Carinae]], cool giant stars including [[Epsilon Eridani]], the [[black hole]] candidate [[Cygnus X-1]], and galaxies including [[Messier 81|M81]] and [[Messier 87|M87]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1978Natur.275..385H |title=IUE observations of hot stars – HZ43, BD +75 deg 325, NGC 6826, SS Cygni, Eta Ca|date=1978|doi=10.1038/275385a0|last1=Heap|first1=S.

Then, the spacecraft systems were tested and optimised. The telescope was focussed, and the prime and redundant cameras in both channels were tested. It was found that the SWR camera did not work properly, and so the SWP camera was used throughout the mission. Initially, this camera suffered from significant electronic noise, but this was traced to a sensor used to align the telescope after launch. Once this sensor was switched off, the camera performed as expected.&lt;ref name="MAST history" /&gt; The cameras were then adjusted for best performance, and the slewing and guiding performance of the telescope evaluated and optimised &lt;ref name="Nature 1978 in-flight"&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1978Natur.275..377B|doi=10.1038/275377a0 |title=In-flight performance of the IUE|date=1978|last1=Boggess|first1=A.|last2=Bohlin|first2=R.

Finally, image quality and spectral resolution were studied and characterised, and the performance of the telescope, spectrographs and cameras were calibrated using observations of well-known [[star]]s.&lt;ref name="Nature 1978 in-flight" /&gt;

After these three phases were completed, the "routine phase" of operations began on 3 April 1978. Optimisation, evaluation and calibration operations were far from complete, but the telescope was understood well enough for routine science observations to begin.&lt;ref name="Nature 1978 in-flight" /&gt;

==Usage==

Use of the telescope was divided between NASA, ESA and SERC in approximate proportion to their relative contributions to the satellite construction: two thirds of the time was available to NASA, and one sixth each to ESA and SERC. Telescope time was obtained by submitting proposals, which were reviewed annually. Each of the three agencies considered applications separately for its allocated observing time.&lt;ref name="IUE newsletter 5"&gt;[http://archive.stsci.edu/iue/newsletters/Vol05/ Index of /iue/newsletters/Vol05]. Archive.stsci.edu (2007-01-09). Retrieved on 2011-08-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomers of any nationality could apply for telescope time, choosing whichever agency they preferred to apply to.

If an astronomer was awarded time, then when their observations were scheduled, they would travel to the ground stations which operated the satellite, so that they could see and evaluate their data as it was taken. This mode of operation was very different from most space facilities, for which data is taken with no real time input from the astronomer concerned, and instead resembled the use of ground-based telescopes.

===Ground support===

For most of its lifetime, the telescope was operated in three eight-hour shifts each day, two from the US ground station at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] in [[Maryland]], and one from the ESA ground station at [[Villanueva de la Cañada]] near [[Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=31315 ESA Science &amp; Technology: Ground Operations]. Sci.esa.int. Retrieved on 2011-08-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its elliptical orbit, the spacecraft spent part of each day in the [[Van Allen belts]], during which time science observations suffered from higher background noise. This time occurred during the second US shift each day, and was generally used for calibration observations and spacecraft 'housekeeping', as well as for science observations that could be done with short exposure times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.stsci.edu/iue/instrument/ops_details.html IUE Operations in Detail].

The twice-daily transatlantic handovers required telephone contact between Spain and the US to coordinate the switch. Observations were not coordinated between the stations, so that the astronomers taking over after the handover would not know where the telescope would be pointing when their shift started. This sometimes meant that observing shifts started with a lengthy pointing manoeuvre, but allowed maximum flexibility in scheduling of observing blocks.

===Data transmission===

Data was transmitted to Earth in real time at the end of each science observation. The camera read-out formed an image of 768&amp;times;768 pixels, and the [[analogue-to-digital converter]] resulted in a [[dynamic range]] of 8 bits.&lt;ref name="Nature 1978" /&gt; The data was then transmitted to Earth via one of six transmitters on the spacecraft; four were [[S-band]] transmitters, placed at points around the spacecraft such that no matter what its attitude, one could transmit to the ground, and two were [[VHF]] transmitters, which could sustain a lower [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], but consumed less power, and also transmitted in all directions. The VHF transmitters were used when the spacecraft was in the Earth's shadow and thus reliant on battery power instead of solar power.&lt;ref name="final report" /&gt;

In normal operations, observers could hold the telescope in position and wait approximately 20 minutes for the data to be transmitted, if they wanted the option of repeating the observation, or they could slew to the next target and then start the data transmission to Earth while observing the next target.

The data transmitted were used for "quick look" purposes only, and full calibration was carried out by IUE staff later. Astronomers were then sent their data on [[magnetic tape]] by post, about a week after processing. From the date of the observation, the observers had a six-month proprietary period during which only they had access to the data. After six months, it became public.&lt;ref name="obs guide"&gt;[http://archive.stsci.edu/iue/instrument/obs_guide/guide.html IUE Newsletter No. 47 – IUE Observing Guide]. Archive.stsci.edu.

==Scientific results==
[[File:IUEobservations.png|thumb|350px|IUE observations chart on a projection map of entire sky.]]
The IUE allowed astronomers their first view of the ultraviolet light from many celestial objects, and was used to study objects ranging from Solar System planets to distant quasars. During its lifetime, hundreds of astronomers observed with IUE, and during its first decade of operations, over 1500 [[peer review]]ed scientific articles based on IUE data were published. Nine symposia of the [[International Astronomical Union]] were devoted to discussions of IUE results.&lt;ref name="Kondo 1989"&gt;Astrophysical contributions of the International Ultraviolet Explorer, 1989, ARA&amp;A, 27, 397 [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989ARA&amp;A..27..397K]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar system===

All the planets in the [[Solar System]] except [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] were observed; the telescope could not point at any part of the sky within 45° of the Sun, and Mercury's [[Elongation (astronomy)|greatest angular distance from the Sun]] is only about 28°. IUE observations of [[Venus]] showed that the amount of [[sulfur monoxide]] and [[sulfur dioxide]] in its atmosphere declined by a large amount during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Na |first1=C.Y. |last2=Esposito |first2=L.W.|last3=Skinner|first3=T.E. |date=1990 |title=International Ultraviolet Explorer observations of Venus SO2 and SO |journal= Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=95 |page= 7485|doi=10.1029/JD095iD06p07485 |bibcode = 1990JGR....95.7485N }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this decline is not yet fully understood, but one hypothesis is that a large [[volcanic]] eruption had injected sulfur compounds into the atmosphere, and that they were declining following the end of the eruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Na|first1=C. Y.|last2=Barker|first2=E. S.|last3=Stern|first3= S. A.|last4= Esposito|first4= L.

[[Halley's Comet]] reached [[perihelion]] in 1986, and was observed intensively with the IUE, as well as with a large number of other ground-based and satellite missions. UV spectra were used to estimate the rate at which the comet lost dust and gas, and the IUE observations allowed astronomers to estimate that a total of 3&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; [[ton]]s of [[water]] evaporated from the comet during its passage through the inner Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feldman |first1=P.D. |last2=Festou |date=1987 |title=IUE Observations of Comet P/Halley: Evolution of the Ultraviolet Spectrum Between September 1985 and July 1986 |journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |volume=187 |page=325 |bibcode = 1987A&amp;A...187..325F|first2=M.

A. |last16=Woods |first16=T. N. |display-authors=9 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-82971-0_59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stars===

Some of the most significant results from IUE came in the studies of hot [[star]]s. A star that is hotter than about 10,000 K emits most of its radiation in the UV, and thus if it can only be studied in visible light, a large amount of information is being lost. The vast majority of all stars are cooler than the [[Sun]], but the fraction that is hotter includes massive, highly luminous stars which shed enormous quantities of matter into interstellar space, and also [[white dwarf]] stars, which are the end stage of [[stellar evolution]] for the vast majority of all stars and which have temperatures as high as 100,000 K when they first form.

The IUE discovered many instances of white dwarf companions to [[main sequence]] stars. An example of this kind of system is [[Sirius]], and at visible wavelengths the main sequence star is far brighter than the white dwarf. However, in the UV, the white dwarf can be as bright or brighter, as its higher temperature means it emits most of its radiation at these shorter wavelengths. In these systems, the white dwarf was originally the heavier star, but has shed most of its mass during the later stages of its evolution. Binary stars provide the only direct way to measure the [[mass]] of stars, from observations of their orbital motions. Thus, observations of binary stars where the two components are at such different stages of stellar evolution can be used to determine the relationship between the mass of stars and how they evolve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holberg |first1=J.B |last2=Barstow |first2= M.A.|last3=Burleigh|first3=M.R.|date=2003 |title=An Archive of IUE Low-Dispersion Spectra of the White Dwarf Stars |journal= Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series|volume=147 |page=145 |doi=10.1086/374886 |bibcode = 2003ApJS..147..145H |citeseerx=10.1.1.626.5601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stars with masses of around ten times that of the Sun or higher have powerful [[stellar wind]]s. The Sun loses about 10&lt;sup&gt;−14&lt;/sup&gt; solar masses per year in its [[solar wind]], which travels at up to around 750&amp;nbsp;km/s, but the massive stars can lose as much as a billion times more material each year in winds travelling at several thousand kilometres per second. These stars exist for a few million years, and during this time the stellar wind carries away a significant fraction of their mass, and plays a crucial role in determining whether they explode as [[supernovae]] or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maeder |first1=A |last2=Meynet |first2=G. |date=2008 |title=Mass Loss and the Evolution of Massive Stars |journal=ASP Conference Series |volume=388 |page=3 |bibcode=2008ASPC..388....3M}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stellar mass loss was first discovered using rocket-borne telescopes in the 1960s, but the IUE allowed astronomers to observe a very large number of stars, allowing the first proper studies of how stellar mass loss is related to mass and luminosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Howarth |first1=I.D. |last2=Prinja |first2=R.K. |date=1989 |title=The stellar winds of 203 Galactic O stars – A quantitative ultraviolet survey |journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series |volume=69 |page=527 |doi=10.1086/191321 |bibcode = 1989ApJS...69..527H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garmany|first1=C.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===SN 1987A===

In 1987, a star in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] exploded as a [[supernova]]. Designated [[SN 1987A]], this event was of enormous importance to astronomy, as it was the closest known supernova to Earth, and the first visible to the [[naked eye]], since [[Kepler's star]] in 1604 – before the invention of the [[telescope]]. The opportunity to study a supernova so much more closely than had ever been possible before triggered intense observing campaigns at all major astronomical facilities, and the first IUE observations were made about 14 hours after the discovery of the supernova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirshner|first1=Robert P.|last2=Sonneborn|first2=George|last3=Crenshaw|first3=D. Michael|last4=Nassiopoulos|first4=George E. |date=1987 |title=Ultraviolet observations of SN 1987A |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=320 |page=602 |doi=10.1086/165579 |bibcode = 1987ApJ...320..602K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IUE data were used to determine that the progenitor star had been a [[blue supergiant]], where theory had strongly expected a [[red supergiant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilmozzi |first1=R. |date=1987 |title=The progenitor of SN1987A |journal=Nature |volume=328 |issue= 6128|page=318 |doi=10.1038/328318a0 |bibcode = 1987Natur.328..318G|last2=Cassatella|first2=A.|last3=Clavel|first3=J.|last4=Fransson|first4=C.|last5=Gonzalez|first5=R.|last6=Gry|first6=C.|last7=Panagia|first7=N.|last8=Talavera|first8=A.|last9=Wamsteker|first9=W.  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubble Space Telescope images revealed a [[nebula]] surrounding the progenitor star which consisted of mass lost by the star long before it exploded; IUE studies of this material showed that it was rich in [[nitrogen]], which is formed in the [[CNO cycle]] – a chain of nuclear reactions which produces most of the energy emitted by stars much more massive than the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fransson |first1=C |date=1987 |title=Narrow ultraviolet emission lines from SN 1987A – Evidence for CNO processing in the progenitor |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=336 |page=429 |doi=10.1086/167022 |bibcode = 1989ApJ...336..429F|last2=Cassatella|first2=A.|last3=Gilmozzi|first3=R.|last4=Kirshner|first4=R. P.|last5=Panagia|first5=N.|last6=Sonneborn|first6=G.|last7=Wamsteker|first7=W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomers inferred that the star had been a red supergiant, and had shed a large amount of matter into space, before evolving into a blue supergiant and exploding.

===The Interstellar Medium===

The IUE was used extensively to investigate the [[interstellar medium]]. The ISM is normally observed by looking at background sources such as hot stars or [[quasar]]s; interstellar material absorbs some of the light from the background source and so its composition and velocity can be studied. One of IUE's early discoveries was that the [[Milky Way]] is surrounded by a vast halo of hot gas, known as a [[galactic corona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savage |first1=B.D. |last2=de Boer |first2=K.S. |date=1979 |title=Observational evidence for a hot gaseous Galactic corona |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=230 |page=77 |doi=10.1086/182965 |bibcode = 1979ApJ...230L..77S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hot gas, heated by [[cosmic ray]]s and [[supernova]]e, extends several thousand [[light year]]s above and below the plane of the Milky Way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sembach |first1=Kenneth R. |last2=Savage |first2=Blair D. |date=1992 |title=Observations of highly ionised gas in the Galactic halo |journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series|volume=83 |page=147 |doi=10.1086/191734 |bibcode = 1992ApJS...83..147S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IUE data was also crucial in determining how the light from distant sources is affected by dust along the line of sight. Almost all astronomical observations are affected by this [[interstellar extinction]], and correcting for it is the first step in most analyses of astronomical spectra and images. IUE data was used to show that within the galaxy, interstellar extinction can be well described by a few simple equations. The relative variation of extinction with wavelength shows little variation with direction; only the absolute amount of absorption changes. Interstellar absorption in other galaxies can similarly be described by fairly simple 'laws'.&lt;ref name="CCM"&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1989ApJ...345..245C|title=The relationship between infrared, optical, and ultraviolet extinction|author1=Cardelli|first1=Jason A.|last2=Clayton|first2=Geoffrey C.|last3=Mathis|first3=John S.|volume=345|date=1989|page=245|journal=Astrophysical Journal|doi=10.1086/167900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howarth LMC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prevot |first1=M.L. |last2=Lequeux |date=1984 |title=The typical interstellar extinction in the Small Magellanic Cloud |journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |volume=132 |page=389 |bibcode = 1984A&amp;A...132..389P|first2=J.|last3=Prevot|first3=L.|last4=Maurice|first4=E.|last5=Rocca-Volmerange|first5=B. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Active Galactic Nuclei===

The IUE vastly increased astronomers' understanding of [[active galactic nuclei]] (AGN). Before its launch, [[3C 273]], the first known quasar, was the only AGN that had ever been observed at UV wavelengths. With IUE, UV spectra of AGN became widely available.

One particular target was [[NGC 4151]], the brightest [[Seyfert galaxy]]. Starting soon after IUE's launch, a group of European astronomers pooled their observing time to repeatedly observe the galaxy, to measure variations over time of its UV emission. They found that the UV variation was much greater than that seen at optical and infrared wavelengths. IUE observations were used to study the [[black hole]] at the centre of the galaxy, with its mass being estimated at between 50 and 100 million times that of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ulrich |first1=M.H. |date=1984 |title= observations of NGC 4151 with IUE. III – Variability of the strong emission lines from 1978 February to 1980 May|journal=MNRAS |volume=206 |page=221 |bibcode = 1984MNRAS.206..221U|last2=Boksenberg|first2=A.|last3=Bromage|first3=G. E.|last4=Clavel|first4=J.|last5=Elvius|first5=A.|last6=Penston|first6=M. V.|last7=Perola|first7=G. C.|last8=Pettini|first8=M.|last9=Snijders|first9=M. A. J.|last10=Tanzi |first10=E. G. |last11=Tarenghi |first11=M. |display-authors=9 |doi = 10.1093/mnras/206.1.221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UV emission varied on timescales of a few days, implying that the region of emission was only a few [[light day]]s across.&lt;ref name="Kondo 1989" /&gt;

Quasar observations were used to probe intergalactic space. Clouds of [[hydrogen]] gas in between the Earth and a given quasar will absorb some of its emission at the wavelength of [[Lyman alpha]]. Because the clouds and the quasar are all at different distances from Earth, and moving at different velocities due to the [[Hubble flow|expansion of the universe]], the quasar spectrum has a "forest" of absorption features at wavelengths shorter than its own Lyman alpha emission. Before IUE, observations of this so-called Lyman-alpha forest were limited to very distant quasars, for which the [[redshift]] caused by the expansion of the universe brought it into optical wavelengths. IUE allowed nearer quasars to be studied, and astronomers used this data to determine that there are fewer hydrogen clouds in the nearby universe than there are in the distant universe. The implication is that over time, these clouds have formed into galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Reed Business Information |title=New Scientist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAF2K_xc8CIC&amp;pg=PA62 |accessdate=28 August 2011 |date=29 January 1987 |publisher=Reed Business Information |pages=62– |issn=0262-4079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission termination==

The IUE was designed to have a minimum lifetime of three years, and carried consumable sufficient for a five-year mission. However, it lasted far longer than its design called for. Occasional hardware failures caused difficulties, but innovative techniques were devised to overcome them. For example, the spacecraft was equipped with six [[Gyroscope|gyros]] to stabilise the spacecraft. Successive failures of these in 1979, 1982, 1983, 1985 and 1996 ultimately left the spacecraft with a single functional gyro. Telescope control was maintained with two gyros by using the telescope's Sun sensor to determine the spacecraft's attitude, and stabilisation in three axes proved possible even after the fifth failure, by using the Sun sensor, the Fine Error Sensors and the single remaining gyro. Most other parts of the telescope systems remained fully functional throughout the mission.&lt;ref name="final report"&gt;[http://sdc.laeff.inta.es/ines/docs/contents.html INES Project Documentation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904041522/http://sdc.laeff.inta.es/ines/docs/contents.html |date=2011-09-04 }}. Sdc.laeff.inta.es (2001-07-06). Retrieved on 2011-08-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, budget concerns at NASA almost led to the termination of the mission, but instead the operations responsibilities were redivided, with ESA taking control for 16 hours a day, and GSFC for the remaining 8 only. The ESA 16 hours was used for science operations, while the GSFC 8 hours was used only for maintenance.&lt;ref name="final report" /&gt; In February 1996, further budget cuts led ESA to decide that it would no longer maintain the satellite. Operations ceased in September of that year, and on 30 September all the remaining [[hydrazine]] was discharged, the batteries were drained and switched off, and at 1844 UT, the radio transmitter was shut down and all contact with the spacecraft was lost.&lt;ref name="final report" /&gt;

It continues to orbit the Earth in its geosynchronous orbit, and will continue to do so more or less indefinitely as it is far above the upper reaches of the Earth's [[atmosphere]]. Anomalies in the Earth's gravity due to its non-spherical shape meant that the telescope tended to drift west from its original location at approximately 70°W longitude towards approximately 110°W.&lt;ref name="final report" /&gt; During the mission, this drift was corrected by occasional rocket firings, but since the end of the mission the satellite has drifted uncontrolled to the west of its former location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.n2yo.com/?s=10637 Live Real Time Satellite Tracking And Predictions: Iue].

===Archives===

The IUE archive is one of the most heavily used astronomical archives.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;[http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=31297 ESA Science &amp; Technology: Archive]. Sci.esa.int (2003-07-09). Retrieved on 2011-08-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Data were archived from the start of the mission, and access to the archive was free to anyone who wished to use it. However, in the early years of the mission, long before the advent of the [[World Wide Web]] and fast global data transmission links, access to the archive required a visit in person to one of two Regional Data Analysis Facilities (RDAFs), one at the [[University of Colorado]] and the other at [[GSFC]].&lt;ref name="IUE newsletter 24"&gt;R. W. Thompson, [http://archive.stsci.edu/iue/newsletters/Vol24/ "IUE Regional Data Analysis Facilities: Bulletin No. 1"], IUE newsletter 24, June 1984, pp. 16–20&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 it became possible to access the archive electronically, by dialling into a computer at Goddard. The archive, then totalling 23 Gb of data, was connected to the computer on a mass storage device. A single user at a time could dial in, and would be able to retrieve an observation in 10–30 seconds.&lt;ref name="IUE newsletter 33"&gt;IUE newsletter 33, September 1987, "Direct Access to the IUE Spectral Archive", E. Sullivan, R. C. Bohlin, S. Heap, &amp; J. Mead, pp. 57 – 65 [http://archive.stsci.edu/iue/newsletters/Vol33/]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the mission entered its second decade, plans were made for its final archive. Throughout the mission, calibration techniques were improved, and the final software for data reduction yielded significant improvements over earlier calibrations. Eventually, the entire set of available raw data was recalibrated using the final version of the data reduction software, creating a uniform high quality archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicholls |first1=Joy S. |last2=Linskey |first2=Jeffrey L. |date=1996 |title= The Final Archive and Recalibration of the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) Satellite|journal= Astronomical Journal|volume=111 |page=517 |doi= 10.1086/117803 |bibcode = 1996AJ....111..517N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the archive is hosted at the [[Space Telescope Science Institute]] and is available via the World Wide Web.&lt;ref name="MAST"&gt;[http://archive.stsci.edu/iue Mast Iue]. Archive.stsci.edu. Retrieved on 2011-08-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on astronomy===

The IUE mission, by virtue of its very long duration and the fact that for most of its lifetime it provided astronomers' only access to UV light, had a major impact on astronomy. By the end of its mission it was considered by far the most successful and productive space observatory mission.&lt;ref name="ESA Science &amp; Technology: Summary"/&gt; For many years after the end of the mission, its archive was the most heavily used dataset in astronomy, and IUE data has been used in over 250 [[PhD]] projects worldwide.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; Almost 4,000 peer-reviewed papers have now been published based on IUE data, including some of the most cited astronomy papers of all time. The most cited paper based on IUE data is one analysing the nature of [[interstellar reddening]], which has subsequently been cited over 5,500 times.&lt;ref name="CCM" /&gt; For comparison, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] has now been in orbit for 21 years (as of 2011) and Hubble data has been used in almost 10,000 peer-reviewed publications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.stsci.edu/hst/bibliography/pubstat.html HST Publication Statistics].

'''Jesper Olsen''', or Jesper Kenn Olsen, is an multiple national record holder [[ultramarathon|ultra distance runner]] from [[Denmark]], and was the second person verified to have [[List of pedestrian circumnavigators|run around the world]] (16,000 miles: 2004-2005), as well as the first verified to have run around the world in a north-south rather than east-west direction (25,000 miles: 2008-2010, 2011-2012, due to 6-month illness and injury).

==Background ==
Olsen has a master's degree in political science from [[Copenhagen University]], [[Denmark]]. He also has a law degree.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.worldrun.org/runners.shtml |title=Runners |publisher=World Run |date= |accessdate=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Running==
Olsen has been a marathon runner since the age of 15. He has achieved various milestones, including the European elite on 100&amp;nbsp;km and 24-hours; the national recordholder on 100&amp;nbsp;km, 24-hours and 6-days (6:58, 224&amp;nbsp;km, 549&amp;nbsp;km), the national elite on marathon (2:27),&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; as well as the [[Cliff Young Australian 6-day race]] in November 2004, running 756 kilometres, and the South African 6-day race in April 2008 with a total of 685 kilometres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetultramarathon.wordpress.com/2008/04/05/jesper-olsen-wins-south-african-6-day-race/ |title=Jesper Olsen wins South African 6-day race &amp;#124; Planet Ultramarathon |website=Planetultramarathon.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following positive reception of his proposal of a world run in 2001, Olsen also founded the World Run project as the organization to undertake the attempt and its support.

== World runs ==
===World Run I===
The concept of Olsen's world run originated as a suggestion made in 2001 by Olsen to David Blaikie, who published it with an invitation for comments on his website ''ultramarathonworld.com''.&lt;ref name="olsen_uw_2001"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030304154057/http://www.ultramarathonworld.com/uw_archive/n24jn01e.html How about a documented group run around the world?], letter by Olsen to David Blaikie/UltramarathonWorld", 2001-06-24: ''"Rather than trying to supply the debate [about Garside's run] with yet another view or perception of what is to be believed and what not, I would like to offer a maybe more constructive approach... It is my point of view that should we of the ultra society act in a truly sportsman's spirit ... we should take up the challenge and do it the proper way and perform a truly documented run around the world! I am ready to do so, but not alone. As I see it, it adds to the reliability of such an event if it is conducted by a number of athletes and not by a solo runner and his crew..."''&lt;/ref&gt; Olsen suggested that, without taking sides in then-current controversies in the ultra-running world, a professionally organized world run would be a "constructive" and "truly sportsman[like]" response to widespread ultrarunner community skepticism and discussion concerning [[Robert Garside]]'s world run, which had been in progress since 1997 but was viewed with great skepticism by Blaikie and many ultra-runners and had not yet been authenticated by Guinness at the time.&lt;ref name="olsen_uw_2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="worldrun1dec2002"&gt;[http://www1.worldrun.org/news-letter-december02.shtml Group Letter, Jesper Olsen, December 2002]: ''"We have had our first successful international media contacts... to explain about the basic principles of the World Run as well as about the difference between our concept of documentation vs. that of Robert Garside.... we have from the beginning had good contacts with Mr. Blaikie of the "www.ultramarathonworld.com" - from which site the whole idea of taking on the challenge of Mr. Garside originally came"''.&lt;/ref&gt; In his letter, Olsen stated that while he was "fairly new to the 'real' ultra-running" world, he did hold the Danish national record  for the 100&amp;nbsp;km run (6:58:31) and for the 24-hour run (223&amp;nbsp;km), had been running marathons since around 1986 (15 years), and having finished a degree, was able to commit the time required if the proposal gained the necessary support from others.&lt;ref name="olsen_uw_2001" /&gt;

Olsen's run around the world took 22 months. It started on 1 January 2004 and finished on 23 October 2005.&lt;ref name=nyt05&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', 25 October 2005, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05EED8103FF936A15753C1A9639C8B63 RUNNING; Run Around World Tries a Man's Soles]&lt;/ref&gt; His route consisted of: [[London]]-[[Copenhagen]]-[[Moscow]]-[[Vladivostok]]-(air)-[[Niigata, Niigata|Niigata]]-[[Tokyo]]-(air)-[[Sydney]]-[[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]-(air)-[[Los Angeles]]-[[Vancouver]]-[[New York City|New York]]-(air)-[[Shannon Town|Shannon]]-[[Dublin]]-(air)-[[Liverpool]]-[[London]]. Olsen averaged {{convert|28|mi|km}} a day, slightly more than a [[marathon]].&lt;ref name=nyt05/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://au.srichinmoyraces.org/resources/jesperinterview "Jesper Olsen World Run Interview"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728045950/http://au.srichinmoyraces.org/resources/jesperinterview |date=2011-07-28 }}, ''Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team.'', September 7, 2009, accessed December 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecco.com/ca/en/specials/worldrun.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124121411/http://www.ecco.com/ca/en/specials/worldrun.jsp |archivedate=2010-11-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="srichinmoyraces1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.srichinmoyraces.org/resources/Jesper%20Olsen |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728050244/http://au.srichinmoyraces.org/resources/Jesper%20Olsen |archivedate=2011-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ortez [http://www.orato.com/sports/jesper-olsen-circles-globe-foot "Jesper Olsen Circles the Globe on Foot"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718062318/http://www.orato.com/sports/jesper-olsen-circles-globe-foot |date=2011-07-18 }}, ''Orato Media ''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.runnersworld.com/article/1,7124,s6-243-292--8995-0,00.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323111347/http://www.runnersworld.com/article/1%2C7124%2Cs6-243-292--8995-0%2C00.html |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It totalled just over 16,000 miles (26,000&amp;nbsp;km),&lt;ref name=nyt05/&gt; exceeding the distance of the first verified walk around the world ([[Dave Kunst]], 1970-1974, 14,452 miles (23,123&amp;nbsp;km))&lt;ref name="Guinness"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/1/first-circumnavigation-by-walking |title=First circumnavigation by walking |publisher=[[Guinness World Records]] |date= |accessdate=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; but around (or slightly under) half the distance of the first verified run around the world, when Garside's run was eventually verified by Guinness in 2007 (Robert Garside, 1997-2003, estimated 30,000 - 40,000 miles (48,000 - 64,000&amp;nbsp;km))&lt;ref name="reuters2007"&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/03/26/uk-britain-runner-record-idUKL2666293420070326 "Runningman" makes it into record books at last] - ''[[Reuters]]'', 2007-03-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Metro&gt;{{cite news | title = Briton becomes first person to run around the world | work = [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] | date= 27 March 2007 | url = http://www.metro.co.uk/news/42972-briton-becomes-first-person-to-run-around-the-world#ixzz14mZK5NwC | accessdate = 11 September 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; During most of the run, Olsen pushed a baby carriage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.worldrun.org/sponsor.shtml |title=World Run |publisher=World Run |date= |accessdate=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he kept food, beverages, a tent, and other equipment. While running through Russia and half of the U.S., he was aided by a support car transporting these supplies. From London to central Siberia he was accompanied by Alexander Korotkov of Russia, who planned to run around the world with Olsen but gave up in central Siberia.

In October 2006, Jorden Rundt i Løb ("World Run" in English) was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.worldrun.org/bog_english.shtml |title=World Run |publisher=World Run |date= |accessdate=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Run II===
Olsen and Sarah Barnett ran the North-South route starting on 1 July 2008. The North-South run aimed to complete a distance of {{convert|40000|km|mi}} with [[GPS tracking unit|GPS tracking]] and live coverage, thus making it the world's longest fully GPS-documented run. The run went from top to bottom of the globe and back, running across four continents and a huge range of temperatures and terrain. It can be seen as a run in a circle around the world in southern, later northern direction with the poles excluded. It started at [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]], [[Norway]] (1 July 2008) passing [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] (4 August), [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] (25 August), [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] (25 September), and [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] (5 November). On December 1, 2008, near [[Silifke]], [[Turkey]], Barnett had to give up after {{convert|7334|km|mi}}, and Olsen continued alone. He passed [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] (1 January 2009) and [[Addis Abeba]], [[Ethiopia]] (16 April). [[Cape Town]] in [[South Africa]] was reached by 15 March 2010, thereby completing the first half of the run and the first documented run through Africa, a distance of {{convert|21449|km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prlog.org/10084298-modern-day-adventurers-to-run-the-world.html |title=Modern day Adventurers to run the World - Phil Essam |publisher=PRLog |date= |accessdate=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetultramarathon.wordpress.com/2008/07/01/jesper-olsen-and-sarah-barnett-start-their-world-run/ |title=Jesper Olsen and Sarah Barnett start their World Run &amp;#124; Planet Ultramarathon |website=Planetultramarathon.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="srichinmoyraces1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gorongosa.net/en/news-event/241109_World_Run_II/world-run-ii-project-comes-to-gnp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719014209/http://www.gorongosa.net/en/news-event/241109_World_Run_II/world-run-ii-project-comes-to-gnp |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jordantimes.com/?news=12918 |title=Jordan Times |newspaper=[[Jordan Times]] |date=2016-08-17 |accessdate=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ambdaressalaam.um.dk/en/menu/AboutUs/News/World+Run+2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719132748/http://www.ambdaressalaam.um.dk/en/menu/AboutUs/News/World%2BRun%2B2.htm |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olsen spent more than six months recovering in Denmark due to dysenteria, malaria, and two operations to eliminate deep infections in his right arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldrun.org/report_day.php?day=2011-02-01 |title=WORLD RUN part II, 2008 - 2012 |website=Worldrun.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then continued his run on 1 January 2011 from [[Punta Arenas]] for the last half of the run, through [[South America]] and [[North America]] to  [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] . On 28 July 2012, Olsen announced on his website the completion of World Run 2 in [[Cape Spear]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldrun.org/report_day.php?day=2012-07-28 |title=WORLD RUN part II, 2008 - 2012 |website=Worldrun.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books== 
In June 2014, Olsen's book "The Runner’s Guide to the Planet" was released on iTunes. Olsen also has two other books in Danish published on iTunes in January and April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/fi/artist/jesper-kenn-olsen/id793172324?mt=11 |title=Jesper Kenn Olsen on iBooks |website=Itunes.apple.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann von Wonnecke Caub''' or '''Johannes de Cuba''' (1430–1503), is the attributed author of an early printed book on [[natural history]], first published in 1485, then revised and expanded in 1491.

==Publications==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
[[File:Extraction_d'une_crapaudine.jpg| right|thumb| ''De animalibus vitam in terris ducentium'' references superstitious medicinal practices. This diagram shows the extraction of a [[toadstone]] to treat someone who has been [[poisoned]].]]
  
The book first appeared in [[German language|German]] under the title of ''Gart der Gesundheit'' (1485), printed in the workshop of [[Peter Schöffer]], then was translated into Latin and expanded under the title of ''Hortus sanitatis'' (1491), edited by Jacob von Meydenbach. Contrary to some historians, it is probably not a translation of ''Pseudo-Apuleius Herbarius'' (1484), but an original work of a much larger scope.

It was translated into [[French language|French]] in 1500 under the title of ''Jardin de santé : herbes, arbres et choses qui de iceuly coqueurent et conviennet a lusage de medecine''.

''Hortus sanitatis'' is divided into several treatises:

*''De Herbis'', the best-known, deals with plants and their [[Herbal remedies|medical use]]. It has 530 chapters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/sites/default/files/library_papers/crowe/cuba/cuba-6.php&lt;/ref&gt;
*''De animalibus vitam in terris ducentium'', which deals with land animals has 164 chapters.
*''De Avibus'', which deals with birds (as the title suggests) and flying animals in general; as it also mentions bats and [[flying insects]].
*''De Piscibus'' has 106 chapters on fish and sea monsters (including [[mermaid]] illustrations).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/sites/default/files/library_papers/crowe/cuba/cuba-15.php&lt;/ref&gt;
*''De lapidibus'' has 144 chapters on [[gemstones]].
*''Tractatus de Urinis'' concerns the historic medical practice of [[uroscopy]].

==Themes in his works==
This work has an obvious medical orientation, including the sections on animals and certain minerals. The illustrations are sketchy although quite lifelike. These and the text will be repeatedly reused in other works, even if the scientific quality of the work is very poor. The author uncritically reproduces many legends, such as the [[tree of life]] and coiled snakes; ''De animalibus vitam in terris ducentium'', in addition to references regarding genuine fauna, replaces a variant of the mythical [[centaur]] with an '''onocentaure''', a man with a donkey's head.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/sites/default/files/library_papers/crowe/cuba/cuba-14.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Little is known of the life of Cuba. He was probably a [[Physician|doctor]] in [[Frankfurt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/sites/default/files/library_papers/crowe/cuba/cuba-index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021001506/http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/sites/default/files/library_papers/crowe/cuba/cuba-index.php |archivedate=2014-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lake Beloye''' ({{lang-rus|Бе́лое о́зеро|p=ˈbʲɛləjə ˈozʲɪrə}} — literally ''White lake'') is a lake in [[Klepikovsky District]], [[Ryazan Oblast]], [[Russia]].  It is notable for its relatively great depth for the region - {{convert|50|m|ft}} - created as a deep gouge in the landscape in the most recent glaciation.&lt;ref name='rushydro'&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian State Water Registry|url=http://textual.ru/gvr/index.php?card=178830|language=ru|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lake is located in the Meshchyera Lowlands, a glacial alluvial plain of swampy lowlands, gravelly moraines and limestone bedrock.&lt;ref name=rznp&gt;{{cite web|title=Озеро Белое — Клепиковский район Рязанская область|url=http://rznp.ru/priroda-ryazani/vodoemi/beloe-ozero.html|accessdate=24 March 2015|language=russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was once connected by an artificial canal to [[Lake Velikoye]] ("Grand Lake", a much larger lake with a surface area of {{convert|20|km2|mi2}}).  The canal was filled in 2009.   Lake Beloye is surrounded by pine forests, with reeds and sedge predominating on the shore.  It is a popular lake for recreation and fishing, being home to pike, carp and other fish.

Lake Beloye was classified in 1974 as a "Nature Monument of Regional Importance", for its "scientific, cultural, educational and health" value (World Database of Protected Places ID #206212).  The site records the presence several species listed as vulnerable in the Red Book of Russia, including the [[Viviparous lizard]], the reptile living the farthest north.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11821">'''Niger''' is home to a number of '''national parks and protected areas''', including two UNESCO-MAB Biosphere Reserves.  The protected areas of Niger normally have a designation and status determined by the Government of Niger.  Further, fourteen sites also have international designations, applied by [[UNESCO]] and the [[Ramsar Convention]] on wetlands protection. Protected lands in Niger are managed by a number of authorities, and the areas of authority and structure have changed a number of times since independence.  Some of the first reserves, parks, and protected areas were designated under [[French West Africa|French Colonial rule]] and much of the legal regime is based on these colonial laws. Niger is also party to a number of international agreements and participates in international ecological, conservation, and resource management programs with its neighbors, region, and worldwide.

==Type and number of protected areas==
Protected lands in Niger fall under both national and international regulation, and are managed by elements of the Nigerien government, as well as regional bodies and international designation oversight bodies.  Initial classification of lands as legally protected for conservation of flora, fauna, landscape, and resource protection was done under French Colonial rule beginning in 1936. Much of the legal framework of land management and protection is based on these original regulations.  As of the late 1990s, most land management was the area of the Nigerien Natural Resource Management Unit (''Cellule de Gestion des Resources Naturelles'') of the Inter-ministerial Sub-committee for Rural Development (''Sous-Comité Interministériel chargé de la politique de Développement Rural au Niger''), which includes ministries focused on environmental issues, industrial resource extraction, economic growth, and farming. Nigerien designated protected areas were administered by the Direction of Fauna, Fisheries and Aquaculture (''Direction de la Faune, de la Pêche et de la Pisciculture - DFPP'') of the Ministry of Hydrology and the Environment (''Ministère de l'Hydraulique et de l'Environnement - MHE''). Actual protection is the responsibility of the DFPP's Fauna and Apiculture Management Service (''Service d'Aménagement de la Faune et de l'Apiculture - SAFA'') which in 1987 had only 40 staff actually managing or guarding sites.&lt;ref name=ABCnigerconservation&gt;[http://www.africanbirdclub.org/countries/Niger/conservation.html Niger Conservation],  African Bird Club, African Birding Resources (2005-2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: most sites have at least two overlapping designations.

===National designations===
Various Nigerien government designations, administered by the "Direction de l'Environnement" office of the Ministry of Hydrology and Environment&lt;ref name=ABCnigerconservation/&gt;
*4 Total Faunal Reserves, the equivalent of the [[World Commission on Protected Areas]]/[[IUCN]] ''Category IV - Habitat/Species Management Area''
*1 Partial Faunal Reserve, the equivalent of the World Commission on Protected Areas/IUCN ''Category IV''
*1 Faunal Reserve Buffer Zone
*1 National Nature Reserve, the equivalent of the World Commission on Protected Areas/IUCN ''Category IV''
*1 Strict Nature Reserve, the equivalent of the World Commission on Protected Areas/IUCN ''Category Ia'' ([[Nature Reserve]]) 
*1 [[National Park]], the equivalent of the World Commission on Protected Areas/IUCN ''Category II'' (National Park)
[[Image:Niger protected areas parks 2005.png|thumb|right|400px|Niger's national parks and protected areas (yellow)]]
*79 Forest Reserves (Forêts Classées) totaling 212,000 ha
*51 restoration and land protection areas totaling 69,000 ha

===International conventions and programmes===
Additionally, several sites have international designations as protected areas.  As signatories of the below conventions, the Government of Niger places restrictions on use of these lands.

*12 [[List of Ramsar wetlands of international importance|Wetlands of International Importance]] ([[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]]). As a Convention signatory, Niger has agreed to establish [[wetlands]] protective areas, which may restrict use and promote "the wise use of wetlands in their territory".&lt;ref&gt;Quote from Article 3.1  of the Ramsar Convention Treaty, quoted in [http://www.ramsar.org/lib/lib_manual2006e.htm The Ramsar Convention Manual, 4th Edition, 2006, Section 1.7]: What are the commitments of Parties joining the Ramsar Convention?&lt;/ref&gt; 
*2 [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Convention site]]s, which are also the
*2 [[Biosphere reserve|UNESCO-MAB Biosphere Reserve]]s.  Both are listed under ''Natural criteria'' vii, ix, x.  These are:     
::VII. "to contain superlative natural phenomena or areas of exceptional natural beauty and aesthetic importance";
::IX. "to be outstanding examples representing significant on-going ecological and biological processes in the evolution and development of terrestrial, fresh water, coastal and marine ecosystems and communities of plants and animals";
::X. "to contain the most important and significant natural habitats for in-site conservation of biological diversity, including those containing threatened species of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science or conservation."
*1 [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Convention site]] is also on the [[UNESCO]] [[List of World Heritage in Danger]].

Other international conventions ratified by the Nigerien government include the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], the [[Convention on Migratory Species]], [[CITES]], the [[Convention to Combat Desertification]], the [[Convention on Climate Change]], the [[African - Eurasian Waterfowl Agreement]], the [[African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]], the [[Convention on Game Hunting]] and the [[Convention on Plant Protection]].&lt;ref name=ABCnigerconservation/&gt;

====Nongovernmental====
A number of Nigerien sites are recognised by conservation programmes as conservation areas of special importance, even where there is no formal government convention.  Notable among these are 15 [[BirdLife International]] designated [[Important Bird Area]]s (IBA). &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanbirdclub.org/countries/Niger/ibas.html Niger Important Bird Areas], The African Bird Club.  Includes detailed descriptions of each site.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these are additional designations given to existing Nigerien government, IUCN, or Ramsar designated sites.

This '''list of threatened ecological communities of Australia''' is derived from the [[Australian federal government]]'s assessment of submissions regarding [[ecological communities]], assemblages of flora and fauna with identified interactions in particular habitats, with determinations on their conservation status and level of protection under the ''[[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]]''. Their status as [[threatened ecological communities]] (TEC) is noted as meeting the criteria as critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable, and where a revision has resulted in delisting or ineligibility.&lt;ref name="SPRATOct2018" /&gt;

[[File:Fishtail Mountain.JPG|thumb|Early Morning View of Fishtail Mountain  ( Machhapuchare), from Sarangkot]]
'''Machapuchare''', '''Machhapuchchhre''' or '''Machhapuchhre''' ({{etymology|ne|''माछापुच्छ्रे'' |fishtail}}), is a [[mountain]] in the [[Annapurna]] Himalayas of north central [[Nepal]]. It is revered by the local population as particularly sacred to the god [[Shiva]], and hence is off limits to climbing.

==Location==
Machapuchare is at the end of a long spur ridge, coming south out of the main backbone of the Annapurna Himalayas, which forms the eastern boundary of the [[Annapurna Sanctuary]]. The Sanctuary is a favorite trekking destination, and the site of the base camps for the South Face of Annapurna and for numerous smaller objectives. The peak is about {{convert|25|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Pokhara]], the main town of the region.

==Notable features==
Due to its southern position in the range, and the particularly low terrain that lies south of the Annapurna Himalayas, Machapuchare commands tremendous vertical relief in a short horizontal distance. This, combined with its steep, pointed profile, make it a particularly striking peak, despite a lower elevation than some of its neighbors. Its [[double summit]] resembles the tail of a fish, hence the name meaning "fish's tail" in [[Nepali language|Nepalese]]. It is also nicknamed the "[[Matterhorn]] of Nepal".

==Climbing history==
Machapuchare has never been climbed to its summit. The only attempt was in 1957 by a British team led by Lieutenant Colonel [[J O M Roberts |Jimmy Roberts]]. Climbers [[Wilfrid Noyce]] and A. D. M. Cox climbed to within {{convert|150|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} of the summit via the north ridge, to an approximate altitude of {{convert|22,793|ft|abbr=on}}. They did not complete the ascent, as they had promised not to set foot on the actual summit.&lt;ref name=chessler/&gt; Since then, the mountain has been declared sacred, and is now closed to climbers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12501">{{short description|Shower of mostly organic detritus falling from the upper layers of the water column}}
In the deep ocean, '''marine snow''' is a continuous shower of mostly organic [[detritus]] falling from the upper layers of the [[water column]]. It is a significant means of exporting [[energy]] from the [[light]]-rich [[photic zone]] to the [[aphotic zone]] below.  The term was first coined by the explorer [[William Beebe]] as he observed it from his [[bathysphere]].  As the origin of marine snow lies in activities within the productive photic zone, the prevalence of marine snow changes with seasonal fluctuations in [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] activity and [[ocean current]]s. Marine snow can be an important food source for organisms living in the aphotic zone, particularly for organisms which live very deep in the water column.

==Composition==
Marine snow is made up of a variety of mostly organic matter, including dead or dying animals and [[phytoplankton]], [[protist]]s, fecal matter, sand, and other inorganic dust. Most trapped particles are more vulnerable to grazers than they would be as free floating individuals and can be classified as "olive green" or "gray body" cells, which are plant parts and degrading plant material. A majority of marine snow composition is actually made up of aggregates of smaller particles held together by a sugary mucus, transparent extracellular [[polysaccharide]]s (TEPs). These are natural [[polymer]]s exuded as waste products mostly by phytoplankton and [[bacterium|bacteria]]. [[Mucus]] secreted by [[zooplankton]] (mostly [[salps]], [[appendicularia]]ns, and [[pteropoda|pteropods]]) also contribute to the constituents of marine snow aggregates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Miller | first=Charles B. | title=Biological Oceanography | year=2004 | publisher=Blackwell Science Ltd.| pages=94–5, 266–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These aggregates grow over time and may reach several centimeters in diameter, traveling for weeks before reaching the ocean floor.

Marine snow often forms during [[algal bloom]]s. As phytoplankton accumulate, they aggregate or get captured in other aggregates, both of which accelerate the sinking rate. Aggregation and sinking is actually thought to be a large component of sources for algae loss from surface water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mann| first=K.H. |last2=Lazier |first2=J.R.N | title=Dynamics of Marine Ecosystems | year=2006 | publisher=Blackwell Publishing| page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most organic components of marine snow are consumed by [[microbe]]s, [[zooplankton]] and other filter-feeding animals within the first 1,000 metres of their journey. In this way marine snow may be considered the foundation of deep-sea [[mesopelagic]] and [[benthic]] [[ecosystem]]s: As sunlight cannot reach them, deep-sea organisms rely heavily on marine snow as an energy source. The small percentage of material not consumed in shallower waters becomes incorporated into the muddy "ooze" blanketing the ocean floor, where it is further decomposed through biological activity.

Marine snow aggregates exhibit characteristics that fit Goldman's "aggregate spinning wheel hypothesis". This hypothesis states that phytoplankton, microorganisms and bacteria live attached to aggregate surfaces and are involved in rapid nutrient recycling. Phytoplankton have been shown to be able to take up nutrients from small local concentrations of organic material (e.g. fecal matter from an individual zooplankton cell, regenerated nutrients from organic decomposition by bacteria).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McCarthy J.J |author2=Goldman J.C. | title=Nitrogenous nutrition of marine phytoplankton in nutrient-depleted waters | doi=10.1126/science.203.4381.670  | year=1979 | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=203 | pages=670–672 | pmid=17813381}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the aggregates slowly sink to the bottom of the ocean, the many microorganisms residing on them are constantly respiring and contribute greatly to the [[microbial loop]].

==Aggregation==
Aggregates begin as the colloidal fraction, which typically contains particles sized between 1&amp;nbsp;nm and several micrometers.  The colloidal fraction of the ocean contains a large amount of organic matter unavailable to grazers.  This fraction has a much higher total mass than either phytoplankton or bacteria but is not readily available due to size characteristics of the particles in relation to potential consumers.  The colloidal fraction must aggregate in order to be more [[bioavailability|bioavailable]].  Aggregation theory outlines main mechanisms by which marine aggregates may form and are as follows:
;[[Brownian motion]]
:Brownian motion, also known as the Brownian Pump in this case, describes the interaction between individual particles in the colloid fraction.  Particles in Brownian motion interact randomly due to the impact of solute molecules.  These interactions lead to collision and aggregation of these small particles.  The small aggregates then collide and aggregate with other aggregates and particles until the aggregate in question is several micrometers in diameter.
;[[shear (fluid)|Shear]]
:Once particles have aggregated to several micrometers in diameter, they begin to accumulate bacteria, since there is sufficient site space for feeding and reproduction. At this size it is large enough to undergo sinking.  It also has the components necessary to fit the "aggregate spinning wheel hypothesis". Evidence for this has been found by Alldredge and Cohen (1987) who found evidence of both respiration and photosynthesis within aggregates, suggesting the presence of both [[autotrophic]] and [[heterotrophic]] organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Alldredge, A.L.  |author2=Cohen, Y.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Can microscale chemical patches persist in the sea?  Microelectrode study of marine snow, fecal pellets. | year=1987 | journal=Science | volume=235| pages=689–691 | doi = 10.1126/science.235.4789.689 | issue=4789 | pmid=17833630}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Differential [[settling]]
:This form of aggregation involves particles sinking at different rates and their collision to form aggregates.
;[[diffusion|Diffusive]] capture
:Diffusive capture describes a particle that is advected into the diffusion-limited boundary layer of another particle and is eventually captured/collides with that particle.
;Surface [[coagulation]]
:Aggregates may also form from colloids trapped on the surface of rising [[Liquid bubble|bubble]]s.  For example, Kepkay et al. found that bubble coagulation leads to an increase in bacterial respiration since more food is available to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Kepkay, P.E.| title=Particle aggregation and the biological activity of colloids| year=1994 | journal=Marine Ecology Project Series | volume=109 | pages=293–304 | doi=10.3354/meps109293}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, a storm at sea could increase bacterial respiration by up to 36 fold for two to four hours.
;[[Filtration]]
:Particles and small organisms floating through the water column can become trapped within aggregates.  Marine snow aggregates are porous, however, and some particles are able to pass through them.
;Bacterial motility
:It is unclear how relevant this mode of aggregation is to marine snow, but there have been limited observations of bacteria moving fast and far enough to capture colloidal particles.

Aggregation theory represents a two state system.  At low cell concentrations aggregation is relatively unimportant and somewhat more unlikely.  However, at higher cell concentrations it becomes increasingly important.  A model has been proposed to characterize the formation of marine aggregates and the loss due to sinking:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d} C_{1} }{\mathrm{d} t} = g C_1 - 20.8\alpha r^{3} G C_1^2|&lt;/math&gt;}}
where
*''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the concentration of the cells
*''r'' is the radius of each cell
*''G'' is the shearing rate
*''&amp;alpha;'' is the stickiness coefficient
*''g'' is the growth rate.

Thus, aggregation of marine particles is more prevalent when cell and particle concentration is higher (e.g. algal blooms)

==Study==
'''Export production''' is the amount of [[organic matter]] produced in the [[ocean]] by [[primary production]] that is not recycled ([[remineralisation|remineralised]]) before it sinks into the [[aphotic zone]].  Because of the role of export production in the ocean's [[biological pump]], it is typically measured in units of [[carbon]] (e.g. [[milligram|mg]] C [[square metre|m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[day|d&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;]]).

The fraction of primary production that is exported to the aphotic zone is generally higher when primary production occurs in short (seasonal) bursts, than when it occurs more evenly spread out across a year.

Because of the relatively long residence time of the ocean's [[thermohaline circulation]], carbon transported as marine snow into the deep ocean by the [[biological pump]] can remain out of contact with the atmosphere for more than 1000 years.  That is, when the marine snow is finally decomposed to inorganic nutrients and dissolved [[carbon dioxide]], these are effectively isolated from the surface ocean for relatively long time-scales related to [[ocean circulation]].  Consequently, enhancing the quantity of marine snow that reaches the deep ocean is the basis of several [[climate engineering|geoengineering]] schemes to enhance [[carbon sequestration]] by the ocean.  [[Ocean nourishment]] and [[iron fertilisation]] seek to boost the production of organic material in the surface ocean, with a concomitant rise in marine snow reaching the deep ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lampitt | first=Richard | title=Ocean fertilisation: a potential means of geoengineering? | year=2008 | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. A]] | volume=366 | pages=3919–3945 | doi=10.1098/rsta.2008.0139 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These efforts have not yet produced a sustainable fertilization that effectively transports carbon out of the system.

Increases in ocean temperatures, a projected indicator of [[climate change]], may result in a decrease in the production of marine snow due to the enhanced [[stratification (water)|stratification]] of the water column.  Increasing stratification decreases the availability of phytoplankton nutrients such as [[nitrate]], [[phosphate]] and [[silicic acid]], and could lead to a decrease in primary production and, thus, marine snow.

Marine snow has also begun to garner interest from [[microbiology|microbiologists]], owing to the microbial communities associated with it. Recent research indicates transported bacteria may exchange [[gene]]s with previously thought to be isolated populations of bacteria inhabiting the breadth of the ocean floor. In such an immense area there may be as yet undiscovered species tolerant of high pressures and extreme cold, perhaps finding use in [[bioengineering]] and [[pharmacy]].

In [[physics]], '''mass–energy equivalence''' states that anything having [[mass]] has an equivalent amount of [[energy]] and vice versa, with these fundamental quantities directly relating to one another by [[Albert Einstein]]'s famous formula:&lt;ref name="famous" /&gt;

&lt;math display="block"&gt;E=mc^2&lt;/math&gt;

This formula states that the equivalent energy ({{math|''E''}}) can be calculated as the mass ({{math|''m''}}) multiplied by the [[speed of light]] ({{math|''c''}} = about {{val|3|e=8}} m/s) squared. Similarly, anything having energy exhibits a corresponding mass {{math|''m''}} given by its energy {{math|''E''}} divided by the speed of light squared {{math|''c''²}}. Because the speed of light is a very large number in everyday units, the formula implies that even an everyday object at rest with a modest amount of mass has a very large amount of energy intrinsically. [[chemical reaction|Chemical]], [[Nuclear reaction|nuclear]], and other [[energy transformation]]s may cause a [[Physical system|system]] to lose some of its energy content (and thus some corresponding mass), releasing it as the [[radiant energy]] of [[light]] or as [[thermal energy|thermal]] energy for example.

See also the [http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/E_mc2/www/ English translation.]&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein was the first to propose that the equivalence of mass and energy is a general principle and a consequence of the [[Spacetime symmetries|symmetries of space and time]].

A consequence of the mass–energy equivalence is that if a body is stationary, it still has some internal or intrinsic energy, called its [[Intrinsic mass#Rest energy|rest energy]], corresponding to its [[rest mass]].  When the body is in motion, its total energy is greater than its rest energy, and equivalently its ''total mass'' (also called [[relativistic mass]] in this context) is greater than its rest mass.  This rest mass is also called the intrinsic or [[invariant mass]] because it remains the same regardless of this motion, even for the extreme speeds or gravity considered in special and [[general relativity]].

The mass–energy formula also serves to [[Conversion of units|convert]] [[:Category:Units of mass|units of mass]] to [[:Category:Units of energy|units of energy]] (and vice versa), no matter what [[Systems of measurement|system of measurement units]] is used.

==Nomenclature==
The formula was initially written in many different notations, and its interpretation and justification was further developed in several steps.&lt;ref name=jammer2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=hecht&gt;{{Citation | author=Hecht, Eugene | date=2011 | title=How Einstein confirmed E0=mc2 | journal=American Journal of Physics | volume =79 | issue=6 | pages =591–600 | doi=10.1119/1.3549223|bibcode = 2011AmJPh..79..591H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In "Does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy content?" (1905), Einstein used {{math|''V''}} to mean the speed of light in a vacuum and {{math|''L''}} to mean the [[energy]] lost by a body in the form of [[radiation]].&lt;ref name="inertia"/&gt; Consequently, the equation {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} was not originally written as a formula but as a sentence in German saying that "if a body gives off the energy ''{{math|''L''}}'' in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by {{math|{{sfrac|''L''|''V''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}." A remark placed above it informed that the equation was approximated by neglecting "magnitudes of fourth and higher orders" of a [[Series (mathematics)|series expansion]].&lt;ref&gt;See the sentence on the last page 641 of the original German edition, above the equation 
{{math|1=''K''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; − ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = {{sfrac|''L''|''V''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} {{sfrac|''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|2}}}}. See also the sentence above the last equation in the English translation, {{math|1=''K''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; − ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = {{sfrac|1|2}}({{sfrac|''L''|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}})''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and the comment on the symbols used in ''About this edition'' that follows the translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1907, Einstein explained that the expression for energy {{math|''ε''}} of a moving mass point assumes the simplest form, when its expression for the state of rest is chosen to be {{math|1=''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''μV''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} (where {{math|''μ''}} is the mass), which is in agreement with the "principle of the equivalence of mass and energy". In addition, Einstein used the formula {{math|1=''μ'' = {{sfrac|''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|''V''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}, with {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} being the energy of a system of mass points, to describe the energy and mass increase of that system when the velocity of the differently moving mass points is increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|doi=10.1002/andp.19073280713|author=Einstein, Albert|date=1907|title=Über die vom Relativitätsprinzip geforderte Trägheit der Energie|journal=Annalen der Physik|volume=328|issue=7|pages=371–384|bibcode = 1907AnP...328..371E |url=http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1907_23_371-384.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1907, [[Max Planck]] rewrote Einstein's mass–energy relationship as {{math|1=''M'' = {{sfrac|''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''pV''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}, where {{math|''p''}} is the pressure and {{math|''V''}} the volume to express the relation between mass, its ''latent energy'', and thermodynamic energy within the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Planck, Max|date=1907|title=Zur Dynamik bewegter Systeme|journal=Sitzungsberichte der Königlich-Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Berlin|volume=Erster Halbband|issue=29|pages=542–570|url=https://archive.org/details/sitzungsberichte1907deutsch}}
:English Wikisource translation: [[s:Translation:On the Dynamics of Moving Systems|On the Dynamics of Moving Systems]]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in October 1907, this was rewritten as {{math|1=''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = {{sfrac|''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} and given a quantum interpretation by [[Johannes Stark]], who assumed its validity and correctness (''Gültigkeit'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=J. |last=Stark |title=Elementarquantum der Energie, Modell der negativen und der positiven Elekrizität |journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |page=881 |volume=24 |issue=8 |date=1907|url=https://archive.org/details/physikalischeze00unkngoog }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1907, Einstein expressed the equivalence in the form {{math|1=''M'' = ''μ'' + {{sfrac|''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} and concluded: "A mass ''{{math|''μ''}}'' is equivalent, as regards inertia, to a quantity of energy ''{{math|''μc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}''.

In 1909, [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and [[Richard C.

In 1911, [[Max von Laue]] gave a more comprehensive proof of {{math|1=''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = {{sfrac|''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} from the [[stress–energy tensor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Laue, Max von|title=Zur Dynamik der Relativitätstheorie|journal=Annalen der Physik|volume=340|issue=8|doi=10.1002/andp.19113400808|date=1911|pages=524–542|bibcode = 1911AnP...340..524L }}

==Conservation of mass and energy==
{{Main article|Conservation of energy|Conservation of mass}}
Mass and energy can be seen as two names (and two measurement units) for the same underlying, conserved physical quantity.&lt;ref&gt;"Einstein was unequivocally against the traditional idea of conservation of mass. He had concluded that mass and energy were essentially one and the same; 'inert[ial] mass is simply latent energy.'[ref...]. He made his position known publicly time and again[ref...]...", Eugene Hecht, "Einstein on mass and energy." Am. J. Phys., Vol. 77, No. 9, September 2009, [http://www.stat.physik.uni-potsdam.de/~pikovsky/teaching/stud_seminar/einstein.pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the laws of [[conservation of energy]] and [[Mass in special relativity|conservation of (total) mass]] are equivalent and both hold true.&lt;ref&gt;"There followed also the principle of the equivalence of mass and energy, with the laws of conservation of mass and energy becoming one and the same.",  Albert Einstein, "Considerations Concerning the Fundaments of Theoretical Physics", Science, Washington, DC, vol. 91, no. 2369, May 24th, 1940 [http://promo.aaas.org/kn_marketing/pdfs/Science_1940_0524.pdf scanned image online]&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein elaborated in a 1946 essay that "the principle of the conservation of mass [...] proved inadequate in the face of the special theory of relativity.  It was therefore merged with the energy [[conservation law|conservation]] principle—just as, about 60 years before, the principle of the [[conservation of mechanical energy]] had been combined with the principle of the conservation of heat [thermal energy].  We might say that the principle of the conservation of energy, having previously swallowed up that of the conservation of heat, now proceeded to swallow that of the conservation of mass—and holds the field alone."&lt;ref&gt;page 14 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=SYPbH6xCbUMC&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;ots=Tu2coopE0u&amp;dq=%22There-followed%20also%20the%20principle%20of%20the%20equivalence%20of%20mass%20and%20energy%2C%20with%20the%20laws%20of%20conservation%20of%20mass%20and%20energy%22&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA14#v=snippet&amp;q=%22proved%20inadequate%20in%20the%20face%20of%20the%20special%20theory%20of%20relativity.%20%20It%20was%20therefore%20merged%20with%20the%20energy%22&amp;f=false preview online]) of Albert Einstein, ''The Theory of Relativity (And Other Essays)'', Citadel Press, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the conservation of mass law is interpreted as conservation of [[rest mass|''rest'' mass]], it does not hold true in special relativity.  The ''rest'' energy (equivalently, rest mass) of a particle can be converted, not "to energy" (it already ''is'' energy (mass)), but rather to ''other'' forms of energy (mass) that require motion, such as [[kinetic energy]], [[thermal energy]], or [[radiant energy]]. Similarly, kinetic or radiant energy can be converted to other kinds of particles that have rest energy (rest mass).  In the transformation process, neither the total amount of mass nor the total amount of energy changes, since both properties are connected via a simple constant.&lt;ref&gt;In F. Fernflores. The Equivalence of Mass and Energy. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/equivME/#2.1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A. Wheeler, 1992. pp. 248"&gt;E. F. Taylor and J. A. Wheeler, ''Spacetime Physics'', W.H. Freeman and Co., NY. 1992. {{ISBN|0-7167-2327-1}}, see pp. 248–9 for discussion of mass remaining constant after detonation of nuclear bombs, until heat is allowed to escape.&lt;/ref&gt; This view requires that if either energy or (total) mass disappears from a system, it is always found that both have simply moved to another place, where they are both measurable as an increase of both energy and mass that corresponds to the loss in the first system.

===Fast-moving objects and systems of objects===
When an object is pushed in the direction of motion, it gains [[momentum]] and energy, but when the object is already traveling near the speed of light, it cannot move much faster, no matter how much energy it absorbs. Its momentum and energy continue to increase without bounds, whereas its speed approaches (but never reaches) a constant value—the speed of light. This implies that in relativity the momentum of an object cannot be a constant times the [[velocity]], nor can the [[Kinetic energy#Kinetic energy of rigid bodies|kinetic energy]] be a constant times the square of the velocity.

A property called the [[relativistic mass]] is defined as the ratio of the momentum of an object to its velocity.&lt;ref&gt;Note that the relativistic mass, in contrast to the rest mass {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, is not a relativistic invariant, and that the velocity &lt;math&gt;\,v=dx^{(4)}/dt&lt;/math&gt; is not a Minkowski four-vector, in contrast to the quantity &lt;math&gt;\tilde v=dx^{(4)}/d\tau&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; d\tau =dt\cdot\sqrt{1-(v^2/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt; is the differential of the [[proper time]]. However, the energy–momentum four-vector &lt;math&gt; p^{(4)}=m_0\cdot dx^{(4)}/d\tau&lt;/math&gt; is a genuine Minkowski four-vector, and the intrinsic origin of the square root in the definition of the relativistic mass is the distinction between {{mvar|dτ}} and {{mvar|dt}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Relativistic mass depends on the motion of the object, so that different observers in relative motion see different values for it. If the object is moving slowly, the relativistic mass is nearly equal to the [[rest mass]] and both are nearly equal to the usual Newtonian mass. If the object is moving quickly, the relativistic mass is greater than the rest mass by an amount equal to the mass associated with the [[kinetic energy]] of the object. As the object approaches the speed of light, the relativistic mass grows infinitely, because the kinetic energy grows infinitely and this energy is associated with mass.

The relativistic mass is always equal to the total energy (rest energy plus kinetic energy) divided by {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="tipler"&gt;{{citation |title=Modern Physics |author1=Paul Allen Tipler |author2=Ralph A. Llewellyn |pages=87–88 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tpU18JqcSNkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q= |isbn=0-7167-4345-0 |publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company |date=January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the relativistic mass is exactly proportional to the energy, relativistic mass and relativistic energy are nearly synonyms; the only difference between them is the [[unit of measurement|units]]. If length and time are measured in [[natural units]], the speed of light is equal to 1, and even this difference disappears. Then mass and energy have the same units and are always equal, so it is redundant to speak about relativistic mass, because it is just another name for the energy. This is why physicists usually reserve the useful short word "mass" to mean rest mass, or [[invariant mass]], and not relativistic mass.

The relativistic mass of a moving object is larger than the relativistic mass of an object that is not moving, because a moving object has extra kinetic energy. The ''rest mass'' of an object is defined as the mass of an object when it is at rest, so that the rest mass is always the same, independent of the motion of the observer: it is the same in all [[inertial frame]]s.

For things and systems made up of many parts, like an [[atomic nucleus]], [[planet]], or [[star]], the relativistic mass is the sum of the relativistic masses (or energies) of the parts, because energies are additive in isolated systems. This is not true in open systems, however, if energy is subtracted. For example, if a system is [[Binding energy#Mass-energy relation|''bound'']] by attractive forces, and the energy gained due to the forces of attraction in excess of the work done is removed from the system, then mass is lost with this removed energy. For example, the mass of an atomic nucleus is less than the total mass of the protons and neutrons that make it up, but this is only true after this energy from binding has been removed in the form of a gamma ray (which in this system, carries away the mass of the energy of binding). This mass decrease is also equivalent to the energy required to break up the nucleus into individual protons and neutrons (in this case, work and mass would need to be supplied). Similarly, the mass of the solar system is slightly less than the sum of the individual masses of the sun and planets.

For a system of particles going off in different directions, the [[invariant mass]] of the system is the analog of the rest mass, and is the same for all observers, even those in relative motion. It is defined as the total energy (divided by {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) in the [[center of mass frame]] (where by definition, the system total momentum is zero). A simple example of an object with moving parts but zero total momentum is a container of gas. In this case, the mass of the container is given by its total energy (including the kinetic energy of the gas molecules), since the system total energy and invariant mass are the same in any reference frame where the momentum is zero, and such a reference frame is also the only frame in which the object can be weighed. In a similar way, the theory of special relativity posits that the thermal energy in all objects (including solids) contributes to their total masses and weights, even though this energy is present as the kinetic and potential energies of the atoms in the object, and it (in a similar way to the gas) is not seen in the rest masses of the atoms that make up the object.

In a similar manner, even photons (light quanta), if trapped in a container space (as a [[photon gas]] or [[thermal radiation]]), would contribute a mass associated with their energy to the container. Such an extra mass, in theory, could be weighed in the same way as any other type of rest mass. This is true in special relativity theory, even though individually photons have no rest mass. The property that trapped energy ''in any form'' adds weighable mass to systems that have no net momentum is one of the characteristic and notable consequences of relativity. It has no counterpart in classical Newtonian physics, in which radiation, light, heat, and kinetic energy never exhibit weighable mass under any circumstances.

Just as the relativistic mass of an isolated system is conserved through time, so also is its invariant mass.This property allows the conservation of all types of mass in systems, and also conservation of all types of mass in reactions where matter is destroyed (annihilated), leaving behind the energy that was associated with it (which is now in non-material form, rather than material form). Matter may appear and disappear in various reactions, but mass and energy are both unchanged in this process.

==Applicability of the strict formula==

As is noted above, two different definitions of mass have been used in special relativity, and also two different definitions of energy. The simple equation &lt;math&gt;E = mc^2&lt;/math&gt; is not generally applicable to all these types of mass and energy, except in the special  case that the total additive momentum is zero for the system under consideration. In such a case, which is always guaranteed when observing the system from either its [[center of mass frame]] or its [[center of momentum frame]], &lt;math&gt;E = mc^2&lt;/math&gt; is always true for any type of mass and energy that are chosen. Thus, for example, in the center of mass frame, the total energy of an object or system is equal to its rest mass times &lt;math&gt;c^2&lt;/math&gt;, a useful equality. This is the relationship used for the container of gas in the previous example. It is ''not'' true in other reference frames where the center of mass is in motion. In these systems or for such an object, its total energy depends on both its rest (or invariant) mass, and its (total) momentum.&lt;ref&gt;Relativity DeMystified, D. McMahon, Mc Graw Hill (USA), 2006, {{ISBN|0-07-145545-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In inertial reference frames other than the rest frame or center of mass frame, the equation &lt;math&gt;E = mc^2&lt;/math&gt; remains true if the energy is the relativistic energy ''and'' the mass is the relativistic mass. It is also correct if the energy is the rest or invariant energy (also the minimum energy), ''and'' the mass is the rest mass, or the invariant mass. However, connection of the '''total or relativistic energy''' (&lt;math&gt;E_r&lt;/math&gt;) with the '''rest or invariant mass''' (&lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt;) requires consideration of the system's total momentum, in systems and reference frames where the total momentum (of [[Magnitude (mathematics)#Euclidean vectors|magnitude]] {{math|''p''}}) has a non-zero value. The formula then required to connect the two different kinds of mass and energy, is the extended version of Einstein's equation, called the relativistic [[energy–momentum relation]]:&lt;ref&gt;Dynamics and Relativity, J.R. Forshaw, A.G. Smith, Wiley, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-470-01460-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  E_r^2 - |\vec{p} \,|^2 c^2 &amp;= m_0^2 c^4 \\
              E_r^2 - (pc)^2 &amp;= (m_0 c^2)^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;E_r = \sqrt{ (m_0 c^2)^2 + (pc)^2 } \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Here the &lt;math&gt;(pc)^2&lt;/math&gt; term represents the square of the [[Euclidean norm]] (total vector length) of the various momentum vectors in the system, which reduces to the square of the simple momentum magnitude, if only a single particle is considered. This equation reduces to &lt;math&gt;E = mc^2&lt;/math&gt; when the momentum term is zero. For photons where &lt;math&gt;m_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the equation reduces to &lt;math&gt;E_r = pc&lt;/math&gt;.

==Meanings of the strict formula==
{{Refimprove|section|date=February 2016}}
[[File:E equals m plus c square at Taipei101.jpg|thumb|right|The mass–energy equivalence formula was displayed on [[Taipei 101]] during the event of the [[World Year of Physics 2005]].]]

Mass–energy equivalence states that any object has a certain energy, even when it is stationary. In [[Newtonian mechanics]], a motionless body has no [[kinetic energy]], and it may or may not have other amounts of internal stored energy, like [[chemical energy]] or [[thermal energy]], in addition to any [[potential energy]] it may have from its position in a [[field (physics)|field of force]]. In Newtonian mechanics, all of these energies are much smaller than the mass of the object times the speed of light squared.

In relativity, all the energy that moves with an object (that is, all the energy present in the object's rest frame) contributes to the total mass of the body, which measures how much it resists acceleration. Each bit of potential and kinetic energy makes a proportional contribution to the mass. As noted above, even if a box of ideal mirrors "contains" light, then the individually massless photons still contribute to the total mass of the box, by the amount of their energy divided by {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], removing energy is removing mass, and for an observer in the center of mass frame, the formula {{math|1=''m'' = {{sfrac|''E''|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} indicates how much mass is lost when energy is removed. In a nuclear reaction, the mass of the atoms that come out is less than the mass of the atoms that go in, and the difference in mass shows up as heat and light with the same relativistic mass as the difference (and also the same [[invariant mass]] in the center of mass frame of the system). In this case, the {{mvar|E}} in the formula is the energy released and removed, and the mass {{mvar|m}} is how much the mass decreases. In the same way, when any sort of energy is added to an isolated system, the increase in the mass is equal to the added energy divided by {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. For example, when water is heated it gains about {{val|1.11|e=-17|u=kg}} of mass for every joule of heat added to the water.

An object moves with different speed in different frames, depending on the motion of the observer, so the kinetic energy in both Newtonian mechanics and relativity is ''frame dependent''. This means that the amount of relativistic energy, and therefore the amount of relativistic mass, that an object is measured to have depends on the observer. The ''rest mass'' is defined as the mass that an object has when it is not moving (or when an inertial frame is chosen such that it is not moving). The term also applies to the invariant mass of systems when the system as a whole is not "moving" (has no net momentum). The rest and invariant masses are the smallest possible value of the mass of the object or system. They also are conserved quantities, so long as the system is isolated. Because of the way they are calculated, the effects of moving observers are subtracted, so these quantities do not change with the motion of the observer.

The rest mass is almost never additive: the rest mass of an object is not the sum of the rest masses of its parts. The rest mass of an object is the total energy of all the parts, including kinetic energy, as measured by an observer that sees the center of the mass of the object to be standing still. The rest mass adds up only if the parts are standing still and do not attract or repel, so that they do not have any extra kinetic or potential energy. The other possibility is that they have a positive kinetic energy and a negative potential energy that exactly cancels.

===Binding energy and the "mass defect"===
{{main article|binding energy}}
{{refimprove section|date=July 2013}}

Whenever any type of energy is removed from a system, the mass associated with the energy is also removed, and the system therefore loses mass. This mass defect in the system may be simply calculated as {{math|1=Δ''m'' = {{sfrac|Δ''E''|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}, and this was the form of the equation historically first presented by Einstein in 1905. However, use of this formula in such circumstances has led to the false idea that mass has been "converted" to energy. This may be particularly the case when the energy (and mass) removed from the system is associated with the ''binding energy'' of the system. In such cases, the binding energy is observed as a "mass defect" or deficit in the new system.

The fact that the released energy is not easily weighed in many such cases, may cause its mass to be neglected as though it no longer existed. This circumstance has encouraged the false idea of conversion of ''mass'' to energy, rather than the correct idea that the binding energy of such systems is relatively large, and exhibits a measurable mass, which is removed when the binding energy is removed. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}.

The difference between the rest mass of a bound system and of the unbound parts is the [[binding energy]] of the system, if this energy has been removed after binding. For example, a water molecule weighs a little less than two free hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom. The minuscule mass difference is the energy needed to split the molecule into three individual atoms (divided by {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}), which was given off as heat when the molecule formed (this heat had mass). Likewise, a stick of dynamite in theory weighs a little bit more than the fragments after the explosion, but this is true only so long as the fragments are cooled and the heat removed. In this case the mass difference is the energy/heat that is released when the dynamite explodes, and when this heat escapes, the mass associated with it escapes, only to be deposited in the surroundings, which absorb the heat (so that total mass is conserved).

Such a change in mass may only happen when the system is open, and the energy and mass escapes. Thus, if a stick of dynamite is blown up in a hermetically sealed chamber, the mass of the chamber and fragments, the heat, sound, and light would still be equal to the original mass of the chamber and dynamite. If sitting on a scale, the weight and mass would not change. This would in theory also happen even with a nuclear bomb, if it could be kept in an ideal box of infinite strength, which did not rupture or pass radiation.&lt;ref name="A. Wheeler, 1992. pp. 248"/&gt; Thus, a 21.5&amp;nbsp;[[TNT equivalent|kiloton]] ({{val|9|e=13|u=joule}}) nuclear bomb produces about one gram of heat and electromagnetic radiation, but the mass of this energy would not be detectable in an exploded bomb in an ideal box sitting on a scale; instead, the contents of the box would be heated to millions of degrees without changing total mass and weight. If then, however, a transparent window (passing only electromagnetic radiation) were opened in such an ideal box after the explosion, and a beam of X-rays and other lower-energy light allowed to escape the box, it would eventually be found to weigh one gram less than it had before the explosion. This weight loss and mass loss would happen as the box was cooled by this process, to room temperature. However, any surrounding mass that absorbed the X-rays (and other "heat") would ''gain'' this gram of mass from the resulting heating, so the mass "loss" would represent merely its relocation. Thus, no mass (or, in the case of a nuclear bomb, no matter) would be "converted" to energy in such a process. Mass and energy, as always, would both be separately conserved.

===Massless particles===
Massless particles have zero rest mass. Their relativistic mass is simply their relativistic energy, divided by {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, or {{math|1=''m''{{ssub|rel}} = {{Sfrac|''E''|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The energy for photons is {{math|1=''E'' = ''hf''}}, where {{mvar|h}} is [[Planck constant|Planck's constant]] and {{mvar|f}} is the photon frequency. This frequency and thus the relativistic energy are frame-dependent.

If an observer runs away from a photon in the direction the photon travels from a source, and it catches up with the observer—when the photon catches up, the observer sees it as having less energy than it had at the source. The faster the observer is traveling with regard to the source when the photon catches up, the less energy the photon has. As an observer approaches the speed of light with regard to the source, the photon looks redder and redder, by [[relativistic Doppler effect]] (the Doppler shift is the relativistic formula), and the energy of a very long-wavelength photon approaches zero. This is because the photon is ''massless''—the rest mass of a photon is zero.

===Massless particles contribute rest mass and invariant mass to systems===
Two photons moving in different directions cannot both be made to have arbitrarily small total energy by changing frames, or by moving toward or away from them. The reason is that in a two-photon system, the energy of one photon is decreased by chasing after it, but the energy of the other increases with the same shift in observer motion. Two photons not moving in the same direction comprise an [[inertial frame]] where the combined energy is smallest, but not zero. This is called the [[center of mass]] frame or the [[center of momentum]] frame; these terms are almost synonyms (the center of mass frame is the special case of a center of momentum frame where the center of mass is put at the origin). The most that chasing a pair of photons can accomplish to decrease their energy is to put the observer in a frame where the photons have equal energy and are moving directly away from each other. In this frame, the observer is now moving in the same direction and speed as the center of mass of the two photons. The total momentum of the photons is now zero, since their momenta are equal and opposite. In this frame the two photons, as a system, have a mass equal to their total energy divided by {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This mass is called the [[invariant mass]] of the pair of photons together. It is the smallest mass and energy the system may be seen to have, by any observer. It is only the invariant mass of a two-photon system that can be used to make a single particle with the same rest mass.

If the photons are formed by the collision of a particle and an antiparticle, the invariant mass is the same as the total energy of the particle and antiparticle (their rest energy plus the kinetic energy), in the center of mass frame, where they automatically move in equal and opposite directions (since they have equal momentum in this frame). If the photons are formed by the disintegration of a ''single'' particle with a well-defined rest mass, like the neutral [[pion]], the invariant mass of the photons is equal to rest mass of the pion. In this case, the center of mass frame for the pion is just the frame where the pion is at rest, and the center of mass does not change after it disintegrates into two photons. After the two photons are formed, their center of mass is still moving the same way the pion did, and their total energy in this frame adds up to the mass energy of the pion. Thus, by calculating the [[invariant mass]] of pairs of photons in a particle detector, pairs can be identified that were probably produced by pion disintegration.

A similar calculation illustrates that the invariant mass of systems is conserved, even when massive particles (particles with rest mass) within the system are converted to massless particles (such as photons). In such cases, the photons contribute invariant mass to the system, even though they individually have no invariant mass or rest mass. Thus, an electron and positron (each of which has rest mass) may undergo [[electron–positron annihilation|annihilation]] with each other to produce two photons, each of which is massless (has no rest mass). However, in such circumstances, no system mass is lost. Instead, the system of both photons moving away from each other has an invariant mass, which acts like a rest mass for any system in which the photons are trapped, or that can be weighed. Thus, not only the quantity of relativistic mass, but also the quantity of invariant mass does not change in transformations between "matter" (electrons and positrons) and energy (photons).

===Relation to gravity===
In physics, there are two distinct concepts of [[mass]]: the gravitational mass and the inertial mass. The gravitational mass is the quantity that determines the strength of the [[gravitational field]] generated by an object, as well as the gravitational force acting on the object when it is immersed in a gravitational field produced by other bodies. The inertial mass, on the other hand, quantifies how much an object accelerates if a given force is applied to it. The mass–energy equivalence in special relativity refers to the inertial mass. However, already in the context of Newton gravity, the Weak [[Equivalence Principle]] is postulated: the gravitational and the inertial mass of every object are the same. Thus, the mass–energy equivalence, combined with the Weak Equivalence Principle, results in the prediction that all forms of energy contribute to the gravitational field generated by an object. This observation is one of the pillars of the [[general theory of relativity]].

The above prediction, that all forms of energy interact gravitationally, has been subject to experimental tests. The first observation testing this prediction was made in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Dyson|first =F.W. |author2= Eddington, A.S. |author3=Davidson, C.R. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=1920 |title=A Determination of the Deflection of Light by the Sun's Gravitational Field, from Observations Made at the Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|Phil.

A]]|volume=220|issue=571–581|pages= 291–333|bibcode=1920RSPTA.220..291D|doi=10.1098/rsta.1920.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a [[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|solar eclipse]], [[Arthur Eddington]] observed that the light from stars passing close to the Sun was bent. The effect is due to the gravitational attraction of light by the Sun. The observation confirmed that the energy carried by light indeed is equivalent to a gravitational mass. Another seminal experiment, the [[Pound–Rebka experiment]], was performed in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Pound| first=R. V.| author2 = Rebka Jr. G. A. | date= April 1, 1960| title=Apparent weight of photons| journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]| volume=4| issue=7|  pages=337–341| doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.4.337| bibcode=1960PhRvL...4..337P}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this test a beam of light was emitted from the top of a tower and detected at the bottom. The frequency of the light detected was higher than the light emitted. This result confirms that the energy of photons increases when they fall in the gravitational field of the Earth. The energy, and therefore the gravitational mass, of photons is proportional to their frequency as stated by the [[Planck constant|Planck's relation]].

==Application to nuclear physics==
[[Image:USS Enterprise (CVAN-65), USS Long Beach (CGN-9) and USS Bainbridge (DLGN-25) underway in the Mediterranean Sea during Operation Sea Orbit, in 1964.jpg|thumb|right|Task Force One, the world's first nuclear-powered task force. {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|2}}, {{USS|Long Beach|CGN-9|2}} and {{USS|Bainbridge|CGN-25|2}} in formation in the Mediterranean, 18 June 1964. ''Enterprise'' crew members are spelling out Einstein's mass–energy equivalence formula {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} on the flight deck.]]

[[Max Planck]] pointed out that the mass–energy equivalence formula implied that bound systems would have a mass less than the sum of their constituents, once the binding energy had been allowed to escape. However, Planck was thinking about chemical reactions, where the binding energy is too small to measure. Einstein suggested that radioactive materials such as [[radium]] would provide a test of the theory, but even though a large amount of energy is released per atom in radium, due to the [[half-life]] of the substance (1602 years), only a small fraction of radium atoms decay over an experimentally measurable period of time.

Once the nucleus was discovered, experimenters realized that the very high binding energies of the atomic nuclei should allow calculation of their binding energies, simply from mass differences. But it was not until the discovery of the [[neutron]] in 1932, and the measurement of the neutron mass, that this calculation could actually be performed (see [[nuclear binding energy]] for example calculation). A little while later, the [[Cockcroft–Walton accelerator]] produced the first [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] reaction ({{nowrap|{{su|p=7|b=3}}Li + {{su|p=1|b=1}}p → 2 {{su|p=4|b=2}}He}}), verifying Einstein's formula to an accuracy of ±0.5%.
In 2005, Rainville et al. published a direct test of the energy-equivalence of mass lost in the binding energy of a neutron to atoms of particular isotopes of silicon and sulfur, by comparing the mass lost to the energy of the emitted gamma ray associated with the neutron capture. The binding mass-loss agreed with the gamma ray energy to a precision of ±0.00004%, the most accurate test of {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} to date.&lt;ref name="rainville"&gt;Rainville, S. et al. World Year of Physics: A direct test of {{math|1=E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. ''Nature'' 438, 1096–1097 (22 December 2005) | {{doi|10.1038/4381096a}}; Published online 21 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mass–energy equivalence formula was used in the understanding of [[nuclear fission]] reactions, and implies the great amount of energy that can be released by a [[nuclear fission]] [[chain reaction]], used in both [[nuclear weapon]]s and [[nuclear power]]. By measuring the mass of different [[atomic nuclei]] and subtracting from that number the total mass of the [[protons]] and [[neutrons]] as they would weigh separately, one gets the exact [[binding energy]] available in an [[atomic nucleus]]. This is used to calculate the energy released in any [[nuclear reaction]], as the difference in the total mass of the nuclei that enter and exit the reaction.

==Practical examples==
Einstein used the [[Centimeter gram second system of units|CGS]] system of units (centimeters, grams, seconds, dynes, and ergs), but the formula is independent of the system of units. In [[natural units]], the numerical value of the speed of light is set to equal 1, and the formula expresses an equality of numerical values: {{math|1=''E'' = ''m''}}. In the [[International System of Units|SI]] system (expressing the ratio {{math|{{sfrac|''E''|''m''}}}} in [[joules]] per kilogram using the value of {{math|''c''}} in [[metre per second|meters per second]]):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Megawatts and Megatons: The Future of Nuclear Power and Nuclear Weapons |edition=illustrated |first1=Richard L. |last1=Garwin |first2=Georges |last2=Charpak |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-226-28427-9 |page=17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1YgBR6shTckC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=1YgBR6shTckC&amp;pg=PA17 Extract of page 17]&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{math|1={{Sfrac|''E''|''m''}} =}} {{math|1=''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ({{val|299792458|u=m/s}})&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =}} {{math|{{val|89875517873681764|u=J/kg}}}} (≈&amp;nbsp;9.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; joules per kilogram).

So the energy equivalent of one kilogram of mass is
*89.9&amp;nbsp;[[joules|petajoules]]
*25.0&amp;nbsp;billion [[kilowatt-hour]]s (≈&amp;nbsp;25,000&amp;nbsp;[[GW·h]])

Weapons designers' conversion value of one&amp;nbsp;gram TNT ≡ 1000&amp;nbsp;calories used.&lt;/ref&gt;
*85.2&amp;nbsp;trillion [[British thermal unit|BTUs]]&lt;ref name="Conversion"/&gt;
*0.0852 [[Quad (unit)|quads]]

or the energy released by combustion of the following:
*21 500&amp;nbsp;[[kiloton]]s of [[TNT equivalent|TNT-equivalent]] energy (≈&amp;nbsp;21&amp;nbsp;Mt)&lt;ref name="Conversion"/&gt;
*{{val|2630000000}} [[litre]]s or {{val|695000000}} US [[gallon]]s of automotive [[Gasoline#Energy content (high and low heating value)|gasoline]]

Any time energy is generated, the process can be evaluated from an {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} perspective. For instance, the "[[Fat Man|Gadget]]"-style bomb used in the [[Trinity test]] and the [[bombing of Nagasaki]] had an explosive yield equivalent to 21&amp;nbsp;kt of TNT. About 1&amp;nbsp;kg of the approximately 6.15&amp;nbsp;kg of plutonium in each of these bombs fissioned into lighter elements totaling almost exactly one gram less, after cooling. The electromagnetic radiation and kinetic energy (thermal and blast energy) released in this explosion carried the missing one gram of mass.&lt;ref&gt;The 6.2&amp;nbsp;kg core comprised 0.8% gallium by weight. Also, about 20% of the Gadget's yield was due to fast fissioning in its natural uranium tamper. This resulted in 4.1&amp;nbsp;moles of plutonium fissioning with 180&amp;nbsp;MeV per atom actually contributing prompt kinetic energy to the explosion. Note too that the term ''"Gadget"-style'' is used here instead of "Fat Man" because this general design of bomb was very rapidly upgraded to a more efficient one requiring only 5&amp;nbsp;kg of the plutonium–gallium alloy.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs because nuclear [[binding energy]] is released whenever elements with more than 62 nucleons fission.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Another example is [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric generation]]. The electrical energy produced by [[Grand Coulee Dam]]'s [[Water turbine|turbines]] every 3.7&amp;nbsp;hours represents one gram of mass. This mass passes to electrical devices (such as lights in cities) powered by the generators, where it appears as a gram of heat and light.&lt;ref&gt;Assuming the dam is generating at its peak capacity of 6,809&amp;nbsp;MW.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turbine designers look at their equations in terms of pressure, torque, and RPM. However, Einstein's equations show that all energy has mass, and thus the electrical energy produced by a dam's generators, and the resulting heat and light, all retain their mass—which is equivalent to the energy. The potential energy—and equivalent mass—represented by the waters of the [[Columbia River]] as it descends to the Pacific Ocean would be converted to heat due to [[viscous friction]] and the [[turbulence]] of white water rapids and waterfalls were it not for the dam and its generators. This heat would remain as mass on site at the water, were it not for the equipment that converted some of this potential and kinetic energy into electrical energy, which can move from place to place (taking mass with it).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Whenever energy is added to a system, the system gains mass, as shown when the equation is rearranged:
* A spring's mass increases whenever it is put into compression or tension. Its added mass arises from the added potential energy stored within it, which is bound in the stretched chemical (electron) bonds linking the atoms within the spring.
* Raising the temperature of an object (increasing its heat energy) increases its mass. For example, consider the world's primary mass standard for the kilogram, made of platinum/iridium. If its temperature is allowed to change by 1&amp;nbsp;°C, its mass changes by 1.5 picograms (1&amp;nbsp;pg = {{val|1|e=-12|u=g}}).&lt;ref&gt;Assuming a 90/10 alloy of Pt/Ir by weight, a {{math|''C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of 25.9 for Pt and 25.1 for Ir, a Pt-dominated average {{math|''C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of 25.8, 5.134&amp;nbsp;moles of metal, and 132&amp;nbsp;J⋅K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for the prototype. A variation of ±1.5&amp;nbsp;picograms is of course, much smaller than the actual uncertainty in the mass of the international prototype, which is ±2&amp;nbsp;micrograms.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A spinning ball weighs more than a ball that is not spinning. Its increase of mass is exactly the equivalent of the mass of energy of rotation, which is itself the sum of the kinetic energies of all the moving parts of the ball. For example, [[the Earth]] itself is more massive due to its daily rotation, than it would be with no rotation. This [[rotational energy]] ({{val|2.14|e=29|u=J}}) represents 2.38 billion metric tons of added mass.&lt;ref&gt;InfraNet Lab (2008-12-07). Harnessing the Energy from the Earth's Rotation.

Note that no net mass or energy is really created or lost in any of these examples and scenarios. Mass/energy simply moves from one place to another. These are some examples of the ''transfer'' of energy and mass in accordance with the ''principle of mass–energy conservation''.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Efficiency==
Although mass cannot be converted to energy,&lt;ref name="A. Wheeler, 1992. pp. 248"/&gt; in some reactions matter particles (which contain a form of rest energy) can be destroyed and the energy released can be converted to other types of energy that are more usable and obvious as forms of energy—such as light and energy of motion (heat, etc.). However, the total amount of energy and mass does not change in such a transformation. Even when particles are not destroyed, a certain fraction of the ill-defined "matter" in ordinary objects can be destroyed, and its associated energy liberated and made available as the more dramatic energies of light and heat, even though no identifiable real particles are destroyed, and even though (again) the total energy is unchanged (as also the total mass). Such conversions between types of energy (resting to active energy) happen in nuclear weapons, in which the protons and neutrons in atomic nuclei lose a small fraction of their average mass, but this mass loss is not due to the destruction of any protons or neutrons (or even, in general, lighter particles like electrons). Also the mass is not destroyed, but simply removed from the system in the form of heat and light from the reaction.

In nuclear reactions, typically only a small fraction of the total mass–energy of the bomb converts into the mass–energy of heat, light, radiation, and motion—which are "active" forms that can be used. When an atom fissions, it loses only about 0.1% of its mass (which escapes from the system and does not disappear), and additionally, in a bomb or reactor not all the atoms can fission. In a modern fission-based atomic bomb, the efficiency is only about 40%, so only 40% of the fissionable atoms actually fission, and only about 0.03% of the fissile core mass appears as energy in the end. In nuclear fusion, more of the mass is released as usable energy, roughly 0.3%. But in a fusion bomb, the bomb mass is partly casing and non-reacting components, so that in practicality, again (coincidentally) no more than about 0.03% of the total mass of the entire weapon is released as usable energy (which, again, retains the "missing" mass). See [[nuclear weapon yield]] for practical details of this ratio in modern nuclear weapons.

In theory, it should be possible to destroy matter and convert all of the rest-energy associated with matter into heat and light (which would of course have the same mass), but none of the theoretically known methods are practical. One way to convert all the energy within matter into usable energy is to annihilate matter with [[antimatter]]. But [[baryon asymmetry|antimatter is rare in our universe]], and must be made first. Due to inefficient mechanisms of production, making antimatter always requires far more usable energy than would be released when it was annihilated.

Since most of the mass of ordinary objects resides in protons and neutrons, converting all the energy of ordinary matter into more useful energy requires that the protons and neutrons be converted to lighter particles, or particles with no rest-mass at all. In the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, the [[baryon number|number of protons plus neutrons]] is nearly exactly conserved. Still, [[Gerard 't Hooft]] showed that there is a process that converts protons and neutrons to antielectrons and neutrinos.&lt;ref&gt;G. 't Hooft, "Computation of the quantum effects due to a four-dimensional pseudoparticle", Physical Review D14:3432–3450 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; This is the weak SU(2) [[instanton]] proposed by Belavin Polyakov Schwarz and Tyupkin.&lt;ref&gt;A. Belavin, A. M. Polyakov, A. Schwarz, Yu. Tyupkin, "Pseudoparticle Solutions to Yang Mills Equations", Physics Letters 59B:85 (1975).&lt;/ref&gt; This process, can in principle destroy matter and convert all the energy of matter into neutrinos and usable energy, but it is normally extraordinarily slow. Later it became clear that this process happens at a fast rate at very high temperatures,&lt;ref&gt;F. Klinkhammer, [[Nicholas Manton|N. Manton]], "A Saddle Point Solution in the Weinberg Salam Theory", Physical Review D 30:2212.&lt;/ref&gt; since then, instanton-like configurations are copiously produced from [[statistical mechanics|thermal fluctuations]]. The temperature required is so high that it would only have been reached shortly after the [[big bang]].

Many extensions of the standard model contain [[magnetic monopole]]s, and in some models of [[grand unification theory|grand unification]], these monopoles catalyze [[proton decay]], a process known as the [[Callan-Rubakov effect]].&lt;ref&gt;Rubakov V. A. "Monopole Catalysis of Proton Decay", Reports on Progress in Physics 51:189–241 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; This process would be an efficient mass–energy conversion at ordinary temperatures, but it requires making [[Magnetic monopole|monopoles]] and anti-monopoles first. The energy required to produce monopoles is believed to be enormous, but magnetic charge is conserved, so that the lightest monopole is stable. All these properties are deduced in theoretical models—magnetic monopoles have never been observed, nor have they been produced in any experiment so far.

A third known method of total matter–energy "conversion" (which again in practice only means conversion of one type of energy into a different type of energy), is using gravity, specifically black holes. [[Stephen Hawking]] theorized&lt;ref&gt;S.W. Hawking "Black Holes Explosions?" ''Nature'' 248:30 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; that black holes radiate thermally with no regard to how they are formed. So, it is theoretically possible to throw matter into a black hole and use the emitted heat to generate power. According to the theory of [[Hawking radiation]], however, the black hole used radiates at a higher rate the smaller it is, producing usable powers at only small black hole masses, where usable may for example be something greater than the local background radiation. It is also worth noting that the ambient irradiated power would change with the mass of the black hole, increasing as the mass of the black hole decreases, or decreasing as the mass increases, at a rate where power is proportional to the inverse square of the mass. In a "practical" scenario, mass and energy could be dumped into the black hole to regulate this growth, or keep its size, and thus power output, near constant. This could result from the fact that mass and energy are lost from the hole with its thermal radiation.

==Background==

===Mass–velocity relationship===
In developing [[special relativity]], Einstein found that the [[kinetic energy#Relativistic kinetic energy of rigid bodies|kinetic energy]] of a moving body is
:&lt;math&gt;E_k =  m_0 ( \gamma -1 ) c^2 = \frac{m_0 c^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} - m_0 c^2,&lt;/math&gt;

with {{math|''v''}} the [[velocity]], {{math|''m''{{sub|0}}}} the rest mass, and {{math|''γ''}} the [[Lorentz factor]].

He included the second term on the right to make sure that for small velocities the energy would be the same as in classical mechanics, thus satisfying the [[correspondence principle]]:
:&lt;math&gt;E_k = \frac{1}{2}m_0 v^2 + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

Without this second term, there would be an additional contribution in the energy when the particle is not moving.

Einstein found that the [[Momentum#Modern definitions of momentum|total momentum]] of a moving particle is:
:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{m_0 v}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}. &lt;/math&gt;

It is this quantity that is conserved in collisions. The ratio of the momentum to the velocity is the [[relativistic mass]], {{mvar|m}}.
:&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

And the relativistic mass and the relativistic kinetic energy are related by the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;E_k = m c^2 - m_0 c^2. \,&lt;/math&gt;

Einstein wanted to omit the unnatural second term on the right-hand side, whose only purpose is to make the energy at rest zero, and to declare that the particle has a total energy, which obeys:
:&lt;math&gt; E = m c^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

which is a sum of the rest energy {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and the kinetic energy. This total energy is mathematically more elegant, and fits better with the momentum in relativity. But to come to this conclusion, Einstein needed to think carefully about collisions. This expression for the energy implied that matter at rest has a huge amount of energy, and it is not clear whether this energy is physically real, or just a mathematical artifact with no physical meaning.

In a collision process where all the rest-masses are the same at the beginning as at the end, either expression for the energy is conserved. The two expressions only differ by a constant that is the same at the beginning and at the end of the collision. Still, by analyzing the situation where particles are thrown off a heavy central particle, it is easy to see that the inertia of the central particle is reduced by the total energy emitted. This allowed Einstein to conclude that the inertia of a heavy particle is increased or diminished according to the energy it absorbs or emits.

===Relativistic mass===
{{Main article|Mass in special relativity}}

After Einstein first made his proposal, it became clear that the word mass can have two different meanings. Some denote the ''relativistic mass'' with an explicit index:
:&lt;math&gt;m_{\mathrm{rel}} = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} .&lt;/math&gt;

This mass is the ratio of momentum to velocity, and it is also the relativistic energy divided by {{math|1=''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} (it is not Lorentz-invariant, in contrast to &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt;). The equation {{math|1=''E'' = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;rel&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} holds for moving objects. When the velocity is small, the relativistic mass and the rest mass are almost exactly the same.
* {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} either means {{math|1=''E'' = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} for an object at rest, or {{math|1=''E'' = ''m''&lt;sub&gt;rel&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} when the object is moving.

Also Einstein (following [[Hendrik Lorentz]] and [[Max Abraham]]) used velocity- and direction-dependent mass concepts ([[Mass in special relativity#Early developments: transverse and longitudinal mass|longitudinal and transverse mass]]) in his 1905 electrodynamics paper and in another paper in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Einstein, A. | date=1905 | title=Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper | journal=Annalen der Physik | volume=17 | pages=891–921 | doi=10.1002/andp.19053221004 | url=http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/papers/1905_17_891-921.pdf | format=PDF | bibcode=1905AnP...322..891E | issue=10 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227120546/http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/papers/1905_17_891-921.pdf | archivedate=2008-02-27 | df= }}.

However, in his first paper on {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} (1905), he treated {{mvar|m}} as what would now be called the ''rest mass''.&lt;ref name="inertia" /&gt; Some claim that (in later years) he did not like the idea of "relativistic mass".&lt;ref name=Okun&gt;See e.g. Lev B.Okun, ''The concept of Mass'', Physics Today '''42''' (6), June 1969, p. 31–36, http://www.physicstoday.org/vol-42/iss-6/vol42no6p31_36.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; When modern physicists say "mass", they are usually talking about rest mass, since if they meant "relativistic mass", they would just say "energy".

Considerable debate has ensued over the use of the concept "relativistic mass" and the connection of "mass" in relativity to "mass" in Newtonian dynamics. For example, one view is that only rest mass is a viable concept and is a property of the particle; while relativistic mass is a conglomeration of particle properties and properties of spacetime. A perspective that avoids this debate, due to Kjell Vøyenli, is that the Newtonian concept of mass as a particle property and the relativistic concept of mass have to be viewed as embedded in their own theories and as having no precise connection.&lt;ref name="Jammer"&gt;{{Citation |title=Concepts of mass in contemporary physics and philosophy |author=Max Jammer |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jujK1bn4QUQC&amp;pg=PA51 |page=51 |isbn=0-691-01017-X |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vøyenli"&gt;

{{Citation |journal=Foundations of Physics |doi=10.1007/BF00708670 |title= The classical and relativistic concepts of mass |date=1976 |author1= Eriksen, Erik |author2=Vøyenli, Kjell |volume=6 |pages=115–124 |publisher=Springer |bibcode=1976FoPh....6..115E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low speed expansion===
We can rewrite the expression {{math|1=''E'' = ''γm''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} as a [[Taylor series]]:
:&lt;math&gt;E = m_0 c^2 \left[1 + \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2 + \frac{3}{8} \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^4 + \frac{5}{16} \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^6 + \ldots \right]. &lt;/math&gt;

For speeds much smaller than the speed of light, higher-order terms in this expression get smaller and smaller because {{math|{{sfrac|''v''|''c''}}}} is small. For low speeds we can ignore all but the first two terms:
:&lt;math&gt;E \approx m_0 c^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_0 v^2 . &lt;/math&gt;

The total energy is a sum of the rest energy and the [[classical mechanics|Newtonian]] [[kinetic energy]].

The classical energy equation ignores both the {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} part, and the high-speed corrections. This is appropriate, because all the high-order corrections are small. Since only ''changes'' in energy affect the behavior of objects, whether we include the {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} part makes no difference, since it is constant. For the same reason, it is possible to subtract the rest energy from the total energy in relativity. By considering the emission of energy in different frames, Einstein could show that the rest energy has a real physical meaning.

The higher-order terms are extra corrections to Newtonian mechanics, and become important at higher speeds. The Newtonian equation is only a low-speed approximation, but an extraordinarily good one. All of the calculations used in putting astronauts on the moon, for example, could have been done using Newton's equations without any of the higher-order corrections.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
The total mass energy equivalence should also include the rotational and vibrational kinetic energies as well as the linear kinetic energy at low speeds.

==History==
While Einstein was the first to have correctly deduced the mass–energy equivalence formula, he was not the first to have related energy with mass. But nearly all previous authors thought that the energy that contributes to mass comes only from electromagnetic fields.&lt;ref name="jann"&gt;{{Citation |author1 =Jannsen, M. |author2 =Mecklenburg, M. | date=2007 | title=From classical to relativistic mechanics: Electromagnetic models of the electron. | editor=V.

===Newton: matter and light===
In 1717 [[Isaac Newton]] speculated that light particles and matter particles were interconvertible in "Query 30" of the ''[[Opticks]]'', where he asks:

{{quote|Are not the gross bodies and light convertible into one another, and may not bodies receive much of their activity from the particles of light which enter their composition?}}

===Swedenborg: matter composed of "pure and total motion"===
In 1734 the Swedish scientist and theologian [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] in his ''[[The Principia (book)|Principia]]'' theorized that all matter is ultimately composed of dimensionless points of "pure and total motion."  He described this motion as being without force, direction or speed, but having the potential for force, direction and speed everywhere within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Swedenborg|first=Emanuel|title=Principia Rerum Naturalia|date=1734|location=Leipzig|language=Latin|chapter=De Simplici Mundi vel Puncto naturali|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Swedenborg|first=Emanuel|title=The Principia; or The First Principles of Natural Things|date=1845|publisher=W. Newbery|location=London|pages=55–57|others=Translated by [[Augustus Clissold]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electromagnetic mass===
{{Main article|Electromagnetic mass}}
There were many attempts in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century—like those of [[J. J. Thomson]] (1881), [[Oliver Heaviside]] (1888), and [[George Frederick Charles Searle]] (1897), [[Wilhelm Wien]] (1900), [[Max Abraham]] (1902), [[Hendrik Antoon Lorentz]] (1904) — to understand how the mass of a charged object depends on the electrostatic field.&lt;ref name="jann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whit"/&gt; This concept was called [[electromagnetic mass]], and was considered as being dependent on velocity and direction as well. Lorentz (1904) gave the following expressions for longitudinal and transverse electromagnetic mass:
:&lt;math&gt;m_{L}=\frac{m_{0}}{\left(\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}\right)^{3}},\quad m_{T}=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} &lt;/math&gt;,

where
:&lt;math&gt;m_{0}=\frac{4}{3}\frac{E_{em}}{c^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Radiation pressure and inertia===
{{Main article|Electromagnetic mass#Inertia of energy and radiation paradoxes}}
Another way of deriving some sort of electromagnetic mass was based on the concept of [[radiation pressure]]. In 1900, [[Henri Poincaré]] associated electromagnetic radiation energy with a "fictitious fluid" having momentum and mass&lt;ref name=action /&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;m_{em}=\frac{E_{em}}{c^2}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

By that, Poincaré tried to save the [[center of mass]] theorem in Lorentz's theory, though his treatment led to radiation paradoxes.&lt;ref name="darr" /&gt;

[[Friedrich Hasenöhrl]] showed in 1904, that electromagnetic [[cavity radiation]] contributes the "apparent mass"
:&lt;math&gt;m_{0}=\frac{4}{3}\frac{E_{em}}{c^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

to the cavity's mass. He argued that this implies mass dependence on temperature as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Philip Ball|title=Did Einstein discover {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}?|publisher=[[Physics World]]|date=Aug 23, 2011|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/46941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Einstein: mass–energy equivalence===
[[Albert Einstein]] did not formulate exactly the formula {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} in his 1905 [[Annus Mirabilis Papers|''Annus Mirabilis'' paper]] "Does the Inertia of an object Depend Upon Its Energy Content?";&lt;ref name="inertia" /&gt; rather, the paper states that if a body gives off the energy {{mvar|L}} in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by {{math|{{sfrac|''L''|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}. (Here, "radiation" means [[electromagnetic radiation]], or light, and mass means the ordinary Newtonian mass of a slow-moving object.) This formulation relates only a change {{math|Δ''m''}} in mass to a change {{mvar|L}} in energy without requiring the absolute relationship.

Objects with zero mass presumably have zero energy, so the extension that all mass is proportional to energy is obvious from this result. In 1905, even the hypothesis that changes in energy are accompanied by changes in mass was untested. Not until the discovery of the first type of antimatter (the [[positron]] in 1932) was it found that all of the mass of pairs of resting particles could be converted to radiation.

====The first derivation by Einstein (1905)====
Already in his relativity paper "On the electrodynamics of moving bodies", Einstein derived the correct expression for the kinetic energy of particles:
:&lt;math&gt;E_{k}=mc^{2}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}-1\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Now the question remained open as to which formulation applies to bodies at rest. This was tackled by Einstein in his paper "Does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy content?", where he used a body emitting two light pulses in opposite directions, having energies of {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} before and {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} after the emission as seen in its rest frame. As seen from a moving frame, this becomes {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Einstein obtained:
:&lt;math&gt;\left(H_{0}-E_{0}\right)-\left(H_{1}-E_{1}\right)=E\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}-1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

then he argued that {{math|''H'' − ''E''}} can only differ from the kinetic energy {{math|''K''}} by an additive constant, which gives
:&lt;math&gt;K_{0}-K_{1}=E\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}-1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Neglecting effects higher than third order in {{math|{{sfrac|''v''|''c''}}}} after a [[Taylor series]] expansion of the right side of this gives:
:&lt;math&gt;K_{0}-K_{1}=\frac{E}{c^{2}}\frac{v^{2}}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Einstein concluded that the emission reduces the body's mass by {{math|{{sfrac|''E''|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}, and that the mass of a body is a measure of its energy content.

The correctness of Einstein's 1905 derivation of {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} was criticized by [[Max Planck]] (1907), who argued that it is only valid to first approximation. Another criticism was formulated by [[Herbert Ives]] (1952) and [[Max Jammer]] (1961), asserting that Einstein's derivation is based on [[begging the question]].&lt;ref name=jammer2&gt;{{Citation|author=Jammer, Max|title=Concepts of Mass in Classical and Modern Physics|location=New York|publisher=Dover|origyear=1961|year=1997|isbn=0-486-29998-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Ives, Herbert E. | date=1952 | title=Derivation of the mass–energy relation | journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America | volume= 42 | issue=8 | pages =540–543 | doi=10.1364/JOSA.42.000540}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, [[John Stachel]] and [[Roberto Torretti]] (1982) argued that Ives' criticism was wrong, and that Einstein's derivation was correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Stachel, John |author2=Torretti, Roberto | date=1982 | title=Einstein's first derivation of mass–energy equivalence | journal=American Journal of Physics | volume =50 | issue=8 | pages =760–763 | doi=10.1119/1.12764|bibcode = 1982AmJPh..50..760S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hans Ohanian (2008) agreed with Stachel/Torretti's criticism of Ives, though he argued that Einstein's derivation was wrong for other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Ohanian, Hans | date=2008 | title=Did Einstein prove E=mc2? | journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B | volume =40 | issue=2 | pages =167–173 | doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2009.03.002|arxiv=0805.1400| bibcode=2009SHPMP..40..167O }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a recent review, see Hecht (2011).&lt;ref name=hecht /&gt;

====Alternative version====
An alternative version of Einstein's [[thought experiment]] was proposed by [[Fritz Rohrlich]] (1990), who based his reasoning on the [[Doppler effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author=Rohrlich, Fritz | date=1990 | title=An elementary derivation of {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} | journal=American Journal of Physics | volume= 58 | issue=4 | pages =348–349 | doi=10.1119/1.16168|bibcode = 1990AmJPh..58..348R }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like Einstein, he considered a body at rest with mass {{mvar|M}}. If the body is examined in a frame moving with nonrelativistic velocity {{mvar|v}}, it is no longer at rest and in the moving frame it has momentum {{math|1=''P'' = ''Mv''}}. Then he supposed the body emits two pulses of light to the left and to the right, each carrying an equal amount of energy {{math|{{sfrac|''E''|2}}}}. In its rest frame, the object remains at rest after the emission since the two beams are equal in strength and carry opposite momentum.

However, if the same process is considered in a frame that moves with velocity {{math|''v''}} to the left, the pulse moving to the left is [[redshift]]ed, while the pulse moving to the right is [[blue shift]]ed. The blue light carries more momentum than the red light, so that the momentum of the light in the moving frame is not balanced: the light is carrying some net momentum to the right.

The object has not changed its velocity before or after the emission. Yet in this frame it has lost some right-momentum to the light. The only way it could have lost momentum is by losing mass. This also solves Poincaré's radiation paradox, discussed above.

The velocity is small, so the right-moving light is blueshifted by an amount equal to the nonrelativistic [[Doppler shift]] factor {{math|1 − {{sfrac|''v''|''c''}}}}. The momentum of the light is its energy divided by {{mvar|c}}, and it is increased by a factor of {{math|{{sfrac|''v''|''c''}}}}. So the right-moving light is carrying an extra momentum {{math|Δ''P''}} given by:
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta P = {v \over c}{E \over 2c} .&lt;/math&gt;

The left-moving light carries a little less momentum, by the same amount {{math|Δ''P''}}. So the total right-momentum in the light is twice {{math|Δ''P''}}. This is the right-momentum that the object lost.
:&lt;math&gt; 2\Delta P = v {E\over c^2} .&lt;/math&gt;

The momentum of the object in the moving frame after the emission is reduced to this amount:
:&lt;math&gt; P' = Mv - 2\Delta P = \left(M - {E\over c^2}\right)v .&lt;/math&gt;

So the change in the object's mass is equal to the total energy lost divided by {{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Since any emission of energy can be carried out by a two step process, where first the energy is emitted as light and then the light is converted to some other form of energy, any emission of energy is accompanied by a loss of mass. Similarly, by considering absorption, a gain in energy is accompanied by a gain in mass.

====Relativistic center-of-mass theorem (1906)====
Like Poincaré, Einstein concluded in 1906 that the inertia of electromagnetic energy is a necessary condition for the center-of-mass theorem to hold. On this occasion, Einstein referred to Poincaré's 1900 paper and wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Einstein, A. |date=1906 |title=Das Prinzip von der Erhaltung der Schwerpunktsbewegung und die Trägheit der Energie |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume=20 |pages=627–633 |doi=10.1002/andp.19063250814 |url=http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/papers/1906_20_627-633.pdf |format=PDF |bibcode=1906AnP...325..627E |issue=8 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318060830/http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/papers/1906_20_627-633.pdf |archivedate=2006-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Although the merely formal considerations, which we will need for the proof, are already mostly contained in a work by H. Poincaré&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, for the sake of clarity I will not rely on that work.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein 1906: Trotzdem die einfachen formalen Betrachtungen, die zum Nachweis dieser Behauptung durchgeführt werden müssen, in der Hauptsache bereits in einer Arbeit von H. Poincaré enthalten sind&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, werde ich mich doch der Übersichtlichkeit halber nicht auf jene Arbeit stützen.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Einstein's more physical, as opposed to formal or mathematical, point of view, there was no need for fictitious masses. He could avoid the ''[[perpetual motion|perpetuum mobile]]'' problem because, on the basis of the mass–energy equivalence, he could show that the transport of inertia that accompanies the emission and absorption of radiation solves the problem. Poincaré's rejection of the principle of action–reaction can be avoided through Einstein's {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, because mass conservation appears as a special case of the [[energy conservation law]].

During the nineteenth century there were several speculative attempts to show that mass and energy were proportional in various [[Aether theories|ether theories]].&lt;ref&gt;Helge Kragh, "Fin-de-Siècle Physics: A World Picture in Flux" in ''Quantum Generations: A History of Physics in the Twentieth Century'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873 [[Nikolay Umov]] pointed out a relation between mass and energy for ether in the form of {{math|1=''Е'' = ''kmc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{math|0.5 ≤ ''k'' ≤ 1}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Умов Н.

Bartocci (1999) observed that there were only [[six degrees of separation|three degrees of separation]] linking De Pretto to Einstein, concluding that Einstein was probably aware of De Pretto's work.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Bartocci, ''Albert Einstein e Olinto De Pretto—La vera storia della formula più famosa del mondo'', editore Andromeda, Bologna, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preston and De Pretto, following [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|Le Sage]], imagined that the universe was filled with an ether of tiny particles that always move at speed {{mvar|c}}. Each of these particles has a kinetic energy of {{math|''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} up to a small numerical factor. The nonrelativistic kinetic energy formula did not always include the traditional factor of {{sfrac|2}}, since [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] introduced kinetic energy without it, and the {{sfrac|2}} is largely conventional in prerelativistic physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author=Prentiss, J.J.| title=Why is the energy of motion proportional to the square of the velocity? | journal=American Journal of Physics | volume=73| issue =  8 |date=August 2005 | page=705| doi=10.1119/1.1927550|bibcode = 2005AmJPh..73..701P }}&lt;/ref&gt; By assuming that every particle has a mass that is the sum of the masses of the ether particles, the authors concluded that all matter contains an amount of kinetic energy either given by {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} or {{math|1=2''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} depending on the convention. A particle ether was usually considered unacceptably speculative science at the time,&lt;ref&gt;John Worrall, review of the book ''Conceptions of Ether. Studies in the History of Ether Theories'' by Cantor and Hodges, The British Journal of the Philosophy of Science vol 36, no 1, March 1985, p. 84. The article contrasts a particle ether with a wave-carrying ether, the latter ''was'' acceptable.&lt;/ref&gt; and since these authors did not formulate relativity, their reasoning is completely different from that of Einstein, who used relativity to change frames.

Independently, [[Gustave Le Bon]] in 1905 speculated that atoms could release large amounts of latent energy, reasoning from an all-encompassing qualitative philosophy of physics.&lt;ref&gt;Le Bon: [http://www.rexresearch.com/lebonfor/evforp1.htm#p1b3ch2 The Evolution of Forces.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bizouard: [http://www.annales.org/archives/x/poincaBizouard.pdf Poincaré ''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; l'équation de Poincaré, Einstein et Planck.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radioactivity and nuclear energy===
It was quickly noted after the discovery of [[radioactivity]] in 1897, that the total energy due to radioactive processes is about one ''million times'' greater than that involved in any known molecular change. However, it raised the question where this energy is coming from. After eliminating the idea of absorption and emission of some sort of [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|Lesagian ether particles]], the existence of a huge amount of latent energy, stored within matter, was proposed by [[Ernest Rutherford]] and [[Frederick Soddy]] in 1903. Rutherford also suggested that this internal energy is stored within normal matter as well. He went on to speculate in 1904:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rutherford|first= Ernest |date=1904|title=Radioactivity |publisher=University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=336–338|url=https://archive.org/details/radioactivity00ruthrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Heisenberg|first= Werner |date=1958|title=Physics And Philosophy: The Revolution In Modern Science |publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|location=New York|pages=118–119|url=https://archive.org/details/physicsandphilos010613mbp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|If it were ever found possible to control at will the rate of disintegration of the radio-elements, an enormous amount of energy could be obtained from a small quantity of matter.}}

Einstein's equation is in no way an explanation of the large energies released in radioactive decay (this comes from the powerful [[nuclear force]]s involved; forces that were still unknown in 1905). In any case, the enormous energy released from radioactive decay (which had been measured by Rutherford) was much more easily measured than the (still small) change in the gross mass of materials as a result. Einstein's equation, by theory, can give these energies by measuring mass differences before and after reactions, but in practice, these mass differences in 1905 were still too small to be measured in bulk. Prior to this, the ease of measuring radioactive decay energies with a calorimeter was thought possibly likely to allow measurement of changes in mass difference, as a check on Einstein's equation itself. Einstein mentions in his 1905 paper that mass–energy equivalence might perhaps be tested with radioactive decay, which releases enough energy (the quantitative amount known roughly by 1905) to possibly be "weighed," when missing from the system (having been given off as heat). However, radioactivity seemed to proceed at its own unalterable (and quite slow, for radioactives known then) pace, and even when simple nuclear reactions became possible using proton bombardment, the idea that these great amounts of usable energy could be liberated at will with any practicality, proved difficult to substantiate. Rutherford was reported in 1933 to have declared that this energy could not be exploited efficiently: "Anyone who expects a source of power from the transformation of the atom is talking [[moonshine]]."&lt;ref&gt;"We might in these processes obtain very much more energy than the proton supplied, but on the average we could not expect to obtain energy in this way. It was a very poor and inefficient way of producing energy, and anyone who looked for a source of power in the transformation of the atoms was talking moonshine. But the subject was scientifically interesting because it gave insight into the atoms." [http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/ ''The Times'' archives], September 12, 1933, "The British association—breaking down the atom"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Einstein - Time Magazine - July 1, 1946.jpg|right|thumb|The popular connection between Einstein, {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and the [[nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] was prominently indicated on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in July 1946 by the writing of the equation on the [[mushroom cloud]].]]

This situation changed dramatically in 1932 with the discovery of the neutron and its mass, allowing mass differences for single [[nuclide]]s and their reactions to be calculated directly, and compared with the sum of masses for the particles that made up their composition. In 1933, the energy released from the reaction of lithium-7 plus protons giving rise to 2 alpha particles (as noted above by Rutherford), allowed Einstein's equation to be tested to an error of ±0.5%. However, scientists still did not see such reactions as a practical source of power, due to the energy cost of accelerating reaction particles.

After the very public demonstration of huge energies released from [[nuclear fission]] after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945, the equation {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} became directly linked in the public eye with the power and peril of [[nuclear weapon]]s. The equation was featured as early as page 2 of the [[Smyth Report]], the official 1945 release by the US government on the development of the atomic bomb, and by 1946 the equation was linked closely enough with Einstein's work that the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine prominently featured a picture of Einstein next to an image of a [[mushroom cloud]] emblazoned with the equation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19460701,00.html Cover.] ''Time'' magazine, July 1, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein himself had only a minor role in the [[Manhattan Project]]: he had [[Einstein–Szilárd letter|cosigned a letter]] to the U.S. President in 1939 urging funding for research into atomic energy, warning that an atomic bomb was theoretically possible. The letter persuaded Roosevelt to devote a significant portion of the wartime budget to atomic research. Without a security clearance, Einstein's only scientific contribution was an analysis of an [[isotope separation]] method in theoretical terms. It was inconsequential, on account of Einstein not being given sufficient information (for security reasons) to fully work on the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, ''Einstein: His Life and Universe''.&lt;/ref&gt;

While {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is useful for understanding the amount of energy potentially released in a fission reaction, it was not strictly necessary to develop the weapon, once the fission process was known, and its energy measured at 200&amp;nbsp;MeV (which was directly possible, using a quantitative Geiger counter, at that time). As the physicist and Manhattan Project participant [[Robert Serber]] put it: "Somehow the popular notion took hold long ago that Einstein's theory of relativity, in particular his famous equation {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, plays some essential role in the theory of fission. Albert Einstein had a part in alerting the United States government to the possibility of building an atomic bomb, but his theory of relativity is not required in discussing fission. The theory of fission is what physicists call a non-relativistic theory, meaning that relativistic effects are too small to affect the dynamics of the fission process significantly."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Serber, ''The Los Alamos Primer: The First Lectures on How to Build an Atomic Bomb'' (University of California Press, 1992), page 7. Note that the quotation is taken from Serber's 1992 version, and is not in the original 1943 [[Los Alamos Primer]] of the same name.&lt;/ref&gt; However the association between {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and nuclear energy has since stuck, and because of this association, and its simple expression of the ideas of Albert Einstein himself, it has become "the world's most famous equation".&lt;ref name="famous"&gt;{{cite book |title=E=mc^2: A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation |edition=illustrated |first1=David |last1=Bodanis |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8027-1821-1 |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8TX2tFLZ7gYC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Serber's view of the strict lack of need to use mass–energy equivalence in designing the atomic bomb is correct, it does not take into account the pivotal role this relationship played in making the fundamental leap to the initial hypothesis that large atoms were energetically ''allowed'' to split into approximately equal parts (before this energy was in fact measured). In late 1938, [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Robert Frisch]]—while on a winter walk during which they solved the meaning of Hahn's experimental results and introduced the idea that would be called atomic fission—directly used Einstein's equation to help them understand the quantitative energetics of the reaction that overcame the "surface tension-like" forces that hold the nucleus together, and allowed the fission fragments to separate to a configuration from which their charges could force them into an energetic ''fission''. To do this, they used ''packing fraction'', or nuclear [[binding energy]] values for elements, which Meitner had memorized. These, together with use of {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} allowed them to realize on the spot that the basic fission process was energetically possible:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ...We walked up and down in the snow, I on skis and she on foot. ...and gradually the idea took shape... explained by Bohr's idea that the nucleus is like a liquid drop; such a drop might elongate and divide itself... We knew there were strong forces that would resist, ..just as surface tension. But nuclei differed from ordinary drops. At this point we both sat down on a tree trunk and started to calculate on scraps of paper. ...the Uranium nucleus might indeed be a very wobbly, unstable drop, ready to divide itself... But, ...when the two drops separated they would be driven apart by electrical repulsion, about 200 MeV in all. Fortunately Lise Meitner remembered how to compute the masses of nuclei... and worked out that the two nuclei formed... would be lighter by about one-fifth the mass of a proton. Now whenever mass disappears energy is created, according to Einstein's formula {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and... the mass was just equivalent to 200 MeV; it all fitted!&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.mac.com/dtrapp/people/Meitnerium.html A quote from Frisch about the discovery day.

'''NEODyS''' (Near Earth Objects Dynamic Site) is an Italian and Spanish service that provides information on [[Near Earth Object]]s with a Web-based interface. It is based on a continually and (almost) automatically maintained database of near earth asteroid orbits. This site provides a number of services to the NEO community. The main service is an impact monitoring system (CLOMON2) of all [[near-Earth asteroid]]s covering a period until the year 2100.&lt;ref name="NEODyS-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Near Earth Objects - Dynamic Site |url=https://newton.spacedys.com/neodys/ |website=NEODyS-2 |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
* '''Risk Page: '''The most important{{cn|date=September 2017}} service is the production of a Risk Page where all NEOs with probabilities of hitting the Earth greater of 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; from now until 2100 are shown in a Risk list. In the table of the Risk list the NEOs are divided into "Special", as it is the case of [[(99942) Apophis]]; "Observable", objects which are presently observable and which critically need a follow up in order to improve their orbit; "Possible recovery", objects which are not visible at present, but which are possible to recover in the next future;  "Lost", objects which have an [[absolute magnitude]] (H) brighter than 25 but which are virtually lost, being their orbit too uncertain; and "Small", objects with an [[absolute magnitude]] fainter than 25 and, even if they are "lost", they are considered too small to result in heavy damage on the ground. Each object has its own Impactor Table (IT) which shows many parameters useful to determine the risk assessment.
*'''Ephemerides: '''It provides ephemerides of the object, that is position on sky, V magnitude, [[altitude (astronomy)|altitude]], [[airmass]], solar and lunar [[elongation (astronomy)|elongation]], [[Phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], [[galactic coordinates]], R distance to the Sun, delta distance to the Earth, motion on sky, and the uncertainty on sky.&lt;ref name="NEODyS-Risk-List"&gt;{{cite web |title=NEODyS-2 Risk List |url=https://newton.spacedys.com/neodys/index.php?pc=4.1 |website=NEODyS-2 |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Observation prediction: '''It provides the position of the object at a specific time, information useful for the observer and a graph showing the uncertainty on sky.
*'''Orbital Information: '''It provides the dynamical parameters of the [[orbit]] of the object.
*'''MOID: '''It shows the analysis of the [[Minimum Orbital Intersection Distance]] (MOID) of the object.
*'''Proper elements: '''It shows the secular properties of the object.
*'''Observational Information: '''It provides data of both optical and radar observations and their statistical performance.

==How NEODyS works==

NEODyS is based on a Postgresql database running on a Linux system.

The database of orbits is continually and automatically maintained with the most recent Minor Planet Center observations. The orbits are computed with the [[OrbFit]] software package provided by the [[OrbFit]] Consortium. All of the computational services provided by this site can also be done with this software package.

==Future expansion of NEODyS==

NEODyS is continually expanding and improving. The following are the next tasks of the project:
* Uncertainties of all the quantities provided with the orbit, e.g., MOID and absolute magnitude
* Variable time span for impact monitoring, based upon orbit uncertainty
* Inclusion of non-gravitational perturbations in the dynamic model

==Major update==
On February 5, 2009 NEODyS went through a major update of the system. A new web-interface is available running the free software [[PHP]]. This allows a more flexible and easy to update system. In the same period the system switched to the new version of the [[Fortran 95]] code [[OrbFit]] 4.0.

==The NEODyS team==
The NEODyS team is composed by [[Andrea Milani (mathematician)|Andrea Milani]] (Dep. of mathematics, University of Pisa, Italy), [[María Eugenia San Saturio Lapeña]] (E.T.S. de Ingenieros Industriales, University of Valladolid, Spain), [[Oscar Arratia]] (University of Valladolid), [[Fabrizio Bernardi]] (IASF-INAF, Rome, Italy),
[[Giovanni F. Gronchi]](University of Pisa, Italy), [[Giovanni B. Valsecchi]] (IASF-INAF, Rome, Italy) and [https://people.unipi.it/tommei/ Giacomo Tommei] (University of Pisa, Italy).

The '''Oceans Act of 2000''' established the [[United States Commission on Ocean Policy]], a [[working group]] tasked with the development of what would be known as the ''[[National Oceans Report]].''

The objective of the report is to promote the following:

# Protection of life and property;
# Stewardship of ocean and coastal resources;
# Protection of marine environment and prevention of [[marine pollution]];
# Enhancement of maritime commerce;
# Expansion of human knowledge of the marine environment;
# Investments in technologies to promote energy and food security;
# Close cooperation among government agencies; and
# U.S. leadership in ocean and coastal activities.

Responses from the executive branch to the commission's report are listed in a [[National Ocean Policy]], sent to the legislative branch.

The act was passed by the [[United States Congress]] on July 25, 2000 and signed by the [[President of the United States|President]] a fortnight later.

[[File:USS Sennet (SS-408) in Antartica 1947.jpg|thumb|300px|[[USS Sennet (SS-408)|USS ''Sennet'' (SS-408)]] participating in Operation Highjump]]

'''Operation Highjump''', officially titled '''The United States Navy Antarctic Developments Program, 1946–1947''', was a [[United States Navy]] operation organized  by [[Rear admiral (United States)#Rear admiral|Rear Admiral]] [[Richard E. Byrd]], Jr., USN (Ret), Officer in Charge, Task Force 68, and led by Rear Admiral [[Richard H. Cruzen]], USN, Commanding Officer, Task Force 68. Operation Highjump commenced 26 August 1946 and ended in late February 1947. Task Force 68 included 4,700 men, 13 ships, and 33 aircraft. Operation Highjump's primary mission was to establish the [[Antarctic]] research base [[Little America (exploration base)|Little America]] IV.&lt;ref name=Kearns&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearns|first=David A.|title=Where Hell Freezes Over: A Story of Amazing Bravery and Survival|year=2005|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|location=New York|isbn=0-312-34205-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuMUEkB53zwC|chapter=Operation Highjump: Task Force 68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polar Record 43"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Summerhayes, C. &amp; Beeching, P. |title=Hitler's Antarctic base: the myth and the reality|work= [[Polar Record]] |volume=43 |issue=224|pages= 1|doi=10.1017/S003224740600578X|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
{{Antarctic expeditions sidebar}}
The Western Group of ships reached the [[Marquesas Islands]] on December 12, 1946, whereupon the [[USS Henderson (DD-785)|''Henderson'']] and [[USS Cacapon (AO-52)|''Cacapon'']] set up weather monitoring stations.  By December 24, the [[USS Currituck (AV-7)|''Currituck'']] had begun launching aircraft on reconnaissance missions.

The Eastern Group of ships reached [[Peter I Island]] in late December 1946.

On January 1, 1947, Lieutenant Commander Thompson and Chief Petty Officer Dixon utilized "Jack Browne" [[Diving mask|masks]] and [[DESCO]] Oxygen [[rebreather]]s to log the first [[Ice diving|dive]] by Americans under the Antarctic.&lt;ref name=Lang2009_SI&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Lang, Michael A. &amp; Robbins, Ron |title=Scientific Diving Under Ice: A 40-Year Bipolar Research Tool. |journal=In: Krupnik, I; Lang, MA; Miller, SE (eds). 2009.

The Central Group of ships reached the [[Bay of Whales]] on January 15, 1947, where they began construction of [[Little America (exploration base)|Little America IV]].&lt;ref name="SP1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation Highjump:  The Great Antarctic Expedition|url=http://www.south-pole.com/p0000152.htm|website=South-Pole|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naval ships and personnel were withdrawn back to the United States in late February 1947, and the expedition was terminated due to the early approach of winter and worsening weather conditions.&lt;ref name="Polar Record 43 224"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Summerhayes, C. &amp; Beeching, P. |title=Hitler’s Antarctic base: the myth and the reality|work= [[Polar Record]] ''43 (224)''|pages= 15–16}} {{doi|10.1017/S003224740600578X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Admiral Byrd discussed the lessons learned from the operation in an interview with Lee van Atta of [[International News Service]] held aboard the expedition's command ship the [[USS Mount Olympus (AGC-8)|USS ''Mount Olympus'']]. The interview appeared in the Wednesday, March 5, 1947 edition of the Chilean newspaper ''[[El Mercurio]]'' and read in part as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Admiral Richard E. Byrd warned today that the United States should adopt measures of protection against the possibility of an invasion of the country by hostile planes coming from the polar regions. The admiral explained that he was not trying to scare anyone, but the cruel reality is that in case of a new war, the United States could be attacked by planes flying over one or both poles. This statement was made as part of a  recapitulation of his own polar experience, in an exclusive interview with International News Service. Talking about the recently completed expedition, Byrd said that the most important result of his observations and discoveries is the potential effect that they have in relation to the security of the United States. The fantastic speed with which the world is shrinking – recalled the admiral – is one of the most important lessons learned during his recent Antarctic exploration. I have to warn my compatriots that the time has ended when we were able to take refuge in our isolation and rely on the certainty that the distances, the oceans, and the poles were a guarantee of safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=|first=|title=A bordo del Monte Olimpo en Alta Mar|newspaper=[[El Mercurio]]|location=[[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]| pages=| language=Spanish| publisher=| date=March 5, 1947| url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polar Record 43"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the operation ended, a follow-up [[Operation Windmill]] returned to the area in order to provide ground-truthing to the aerial photography of Highjump from 1947-1948. [[Finn Ronne]] also financed a [[Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition|private operation]] to the same territory until 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition|url=http://www.ronneantarcticexplorers.com/ronne_antarctic_research_expedition.htm|website=Ronne Antarctic Explorers|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other U.S. Antarctic expeditions, interested persons were allowed to send letters with enclosed envelopes to the base, where commemorative [[cachet]]s were added to their enclosures, which were then returned to the senders.  These souvenir [[philatelic cover]]s are readily available at low cost.  It is estimated that at least 150,000 such envelopes were produced, though their final number may be considerably higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation Highjump:  A Philatelic Introduction|url=http://www.south-pole.com/highjump.htm|website=South Pole|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human losses==
On December 30, 1946, aviation radiomen Wendell K. Hendersin, Fredrick W. Williams, and Ensign Maxwell A. Lopez were killed when their [[Martin PBM Mariner]] ''George 1'' [[1946 Antarctica PBM Mariner crash|crashed]] during a blizzard. The surviving six crew members were rescued 13&amp;nbsp;days later, including aviation radioman James H. Robbins and co-pilot William Kearns. A plaque honoring the three killed crewmen was later erected at the [[McMurdo Station]] research base&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Byrd Memorial at McMurdo|url=http://www.southpolestation.com/trivia/byrd/mcm.html|website=South Pole Station|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Mount Lopez]] on [[Thurston Island]] was named in honor of killed airman Maxwell A. Lopez.

In December 2004, an attempt was made to locate the remains of the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/news/2004/020705thurston.shtml|title=News Archives from Antarctica|date=2004|work=Antarctic Connection|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060112131937/http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/news/2004/020705thurston.shtml|archivedate=2006-01-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are ongoing efforts to repatriate the bodies of the three men killed in the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.george1recovery.org/|website= George1Recovery.org|title=Operation Highjump Crew Recovery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 21, 1947, Vance N. Woodall died during a "ship unloading accident"&lt;ref name="SP1"/&gt;. In a crew profile, deckman Edward Beardsley described his worst memory as "when Seaman Vance Woodall died on the Ross Ice Shelf under a piece of roller equipment designed to 'pave' the ice to build an airstrip."

'''Peak demand''' is an historically high point in the sales record of a particular [[product (business)|product]]. In terms of energy use, peak demand describes a period of simultaneous, strong consumer [[Supply and demand|demand]].

== Peak load ==
The peak demand of an installation or a system is simply the highest demand that has occurred over a specified time period (Gönen 2008). Peak demand is typically characterized as annual, daily or seasonal and has the unit of power.
Peak demand, '''peak load''' or '''on-peak''' are terms used in [[energy demand management]] describing a period in which [[electric power|electrical power]] is expected to be provided for a sustained period at a significantly higher than average supply level.  Peak demand fluctuations may occur on daily, monthly, seasonal and yearly cycles. For an [[electric utility]] company, the actual point of peak demand is a single half-hour or hourly period which represents the highest point of customer consumption of electricity. At this time there is a combination of office, domestic demand and at some times of the year, the fall of darkness.&lt;ref name="iee"&gt;{{cite book |title=Improving Energy Efficiency in Buildings: A Management Guide |last=Landsberg |first=Dennis R. |author2=Ronald Stewart |year=1980 |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |isbn=1438409990 |page=456 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M0EnqtFxW3cC |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some utilities will charge customers based on their individual peak demand. The highest demand during each month or even a single 15 to 30 minute period of highest use in the previous year may be used to calculate charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Energy Efficiency and Management in Food Processing Facilities |last=Wang  |first=Lijun |year=2008 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=1420063391 |page=122 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JiqjUeGC-AIC |accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demand Tariff ===
Electricity network is built to deal with the highest possible peak demand otherwise blackout may happen. In Australia, demand tariff has three components:peak demand charge, energy charge and daily connection charge. For example for large customers (commercial,industrial or mixed of commercial/residential), the peak demand charge is based on the highest 30 minutes electricity consumption in a month; the energy charge is based on a month electricity consumption. This type of demand tariff is gradually introduced to residential households and will be rolled out by 2020 in Queensland Australia. How to manage electricity bills under demand tariff can be challenging. The key solutions involve improving building efficiency and managing the operational settings of large power appliances &lt;ref&gt;L. Liu, W. Miller, and G. Ledwich. (2017) Solutions for reducing electricity costs for communal facilities. Australian Ageing Agenda. 39-40. Available: https://www.australianageingagenda.com.au/2017/10/27/solutions-reducing-facility-electricity-costs/&lt;/ref&gt; .

=== When is the peak electricity demand?===
It depends on the demography, the economy, the weather, the climate, the season, the day of the week and other factors. For example, in industrialised regions of China or Germany, the peak demands mostly occur in day time, while solar photovoltaic system can help reduce it. However, in more service based economy such as Australia, the daily peak demands often occur in the late afternoon to early evening time (e.g. 4pm to 8pm). Residential and commercial electricity demand contributes a lot to this type of network peak demand &lt;ref&gt;L. Liu, M. Shafiei, G. Ledwich, W. Miller, and G. Nourbakhsh, "Correlation Study of Residential Community Demand with High PV Penetration," Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Off-peak ===
Peak demand is considered to be the opposite to off-peak hours when power demand is usually low. There are off-peak [[time-of-use]] [[Rate (mathematics)|rates]]. Sometimes, there are 3 time-of-use zones: peak, shoulder and offpeak. Shoulder is often the time between peak and offpeak in weekdays. Weekends are often just peak and offpeak in terms of managing electricity loads for the network. 

===Response===
{{Main article|Demand response}}
[[File:Tagesgang engl.png|thumb|Typical daily consumption of electrical power in Germany]]

The maximum demand dictates the size of generators, transmission lines, transformers and circuit breakers for utilities even if that amount lasts just one hour per year.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}  Natural gas fueled power generators must all have adequately sized pipelines.  Power generation which is able to be rapidly ramped up for peak demand often uses more expensive fuels, is less efficient and has higher marginal carbon emissions.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Peak demand may exceed the maximum supply levels that the [[electrical power industry]] can [[electricity generation|generate]], resulting in [[power outage]]s and [[load shedding]]. This often occurs during [[heat wave]]s when use of air conditioners and powered fans raises the rate of [[energy consumption]] significantly. During a shortage authorities may request the public to curtail their energy use and shift it to a non-peak period.

{{see also|Energy crisis}}

===Power stations===
[[Power station]]s providing power to [[electrical grid]]s for peak demand are called [[peaking power plant]]s or 'peakers'. [[Natural gas]] fueled power stations can be fired up rapidly and are therefore often utilized at peak demand times. [[Pumped storage]] type dams such as [[Carters Dam]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|the U.S. state of Georgia]] help to meet peak demand as well.

The chances that a [[wind farm]] will be unable to meet peak demand are greater than for a fossil-fueled power station, due to the ability to store liquid fuels for use during peak demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Economics of Renewable Energy: 4th Report of Session 2007-08, Vol. 1: Report, Volume 1  |author=Great Britain.

The '''pygarg''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|aɪ|g|ɑː|g}}&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;) is an animal mentioned in the [[Bible]] in {{Bibleverse|Deuteronomy|14:5|KJV}} as one of the animals permitted for food. The [[Septuagint]] translates the Hebrew ''{{transl|he|ḏîšōn}}'' ({{lang|he|דִּישֹׁן}}) as ''{{transl|grc|pygargos}}'' in [[Koiné Greek]] ("white-rumped", from ''{{transl|grc|[[wikt:πυγή|pyge]]}}'' "buttocks" and ''{{transl|grc|[[wikt:ἀργός|argo]]}}'' "white"),&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{OED|pygarg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the King James Version takes from there its term ''pygarg''.

[[Henry Baker Tristram]] (1867) proposed that the pygarg was the Saharan antelope [[addax]] and described it as "a large animal, over {{convert|3+1/2|ft|0|abbr=out|disp=sqbr}} high at the shoulder, and, with its gently-twisted horns, {{convert|2+1/2|ft|cm|-1|abbr=out|disp=sqbr}} feet long. Its colour is pure white, with the exception of a short black mane, and a tinge of tawny on the shoulders and back".&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Baker Tristram]], ''The Natural History of the Bible'' (1867).&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the biblical use, the term was also applied to the [[Siberian roe deer]] in the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pallas|first=P.S. |authorlink=Peter Simon Pallas |title=Voyages du professeur Pallas, dans plusieurs provinces de l'Empire de Russie et dans l'Asie septentrionale |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQ5UAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA25 |year=1793|page=25 | language = Latin, French}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] is ''{{lang|la|{{linktext|pygargus}}}}'' in [[scientific Latin]].

* '''Pyrene''', daughter of King [[Bebrycius]] and a lover of [[Heracles]]. She bore a serpent and became so terrified that she fled to the woods where she died. Heracles created a tomb for her by piling up rocks thus forming the mountain range of the [[Pyrenees]], named after her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Silius Italicus]], ''Punica'', 3. 415-446&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bell's New Pantheon Or Historical Dictionary of the Gods, Demi Gods, page 203 [https://books.google.com/books?id=HNEMkXDHxo0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA203&amp;lpg=RA1-PA203&amp;dq=pyrene+hercules&amp;source=web&amp;ots=PL4veRlZZg&amp;sig=VKrKFEpUQDHwtjf-gFDpvmUM9yM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Anonymous) ''A classical manual, being a mythological, historical, and geographical commentary on Pope's Homer and Dryden's Aeneid of Virgil''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6121">'''Soil and Water Bioengineering''' is a discipline of [[civil engineering]]. It pursues technological, ecological, economic as well as design goals and seeks to achieve these primarily by making use of living materials, i.e. seeds, plants, part of plants and plant communities, and employing them in near–natural constructions while exploiting the manifold abilities inherent in plants.
Soil [[bioengineering]] may sometimes be a substitute for classical engineering works; however, in most cases it is a meaningful and necessary method of complementing the latter.
Its application suggests itself in all fields of soil and [[hydraulic engineering]], especially for [[slope stabilization|slope]] and embankment stabilization and [[erosion control]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiechtl, H. M. (Trans. N.K. Horstmann, 1980). Bioengineering for Land Reclamation and Conservation. University of Alberta Press. Edmonton. Alberta. 404 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil bioengineering is the use of living plant materials to provide some engineering function. Soil bioengineering is an effective tool for treatment of a variety of unstable and / or eroding sites. Soil bioengineering techniques have been used for many centuries. More recently Schiechtl (1980) has encouraged the use of soil bioengineering with a variety of European examples. Soil bioengineering is now widely practiced throughout the world for the treatment of erosion and unstable slopes.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, D.H. and A.T. Leiser. 1982. Biotechnical Slope Protection and Erosion Control. Van Nostrand Reinhold Company Inc. Scarborough, Ontario, 271 pp. reprinted by Krieger Publishing Co. Malabar, Florida).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, J. and J. Hellin. 1996. Bio-engineering for Effective Road Maintenance in the Caribbean. Natural Resources Institute. The University of Greenwich. United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fields of Application and Plants for Soil Bioengineering Control Works ==
Soil Bioengineering methods can be applied wherever the plants which are used as living building materials are able to grow well and develop.
This is the case in tropical, subtropical and [[temperate zone]]s whereas there are obvious limits in dry and cold regions, i.e. where arid, semi–arid and frost zones prevail. In exceptional cases, lack of water may be compensated for by watering or [[irrigation]].
In Europe, dry conditions limiting application exist in the Mediterranean as well as in some inner alpine and eastern European snowy regions. However, limits are most frequently imposed in alpine and arctic regions. These can usually be clearly noticed by the limited growth of woody plants ([[forest line|forest]], tree and shrub lines) and the upper limits of closed [[turf]] [[vegetative cover|cover]]. The more impoverished a region is in species, the less suited it is for the application of bioengineering methods.

== Functions and Effects of Soil Bioengineering Structures ==
===Technical functions===
*protection of soil surface from erosion by wind, precipitation, frost and flowing water
*protection from rock fall
*elimination or binding of destructive mechanical forces
*reduction of flow velocity along banks
*surface and/or deep soil cohesion and stabilization
*drainage
*protection from wind
*aiding the deposition of snow, drift sand and sediments
*increasing soil roughness and thus preventing avalanche release

Apart from these, ecological functions are gaining in importance, particularly as these can be fulfilled to a very limited extent only by classical engineering constructions.

===Ecological functions===
*improvement of water regime by improved soil interception and storage capability as well as water
*consumption by plants
*[[soil drainage]]
*protection from wind
*protection from ambient [[air pollution]]
*mechanical [[soil amelioration]] by the roots of plants
*balancing of temperature conditions in near–ground layers of air and in the soil
*[[shading]]
*improvement of nutrient content in the soil and thus of soil fertility on previously raw soils
*balancing of snow deposits
*[[noise protection]]
*yield increase on neighbouring cropland

===Landscaping functions===
*healing of wounds inflicted on the landscape by disasters and humans (exploitation of mineral resources, construction work, deposition of overburden, tunnel excavation material, industrial and domestic waste)
*integration of structures into the landscape
*concealment of offending structures
*enrichment of the landscape by creating new features and structures, shapes and colours of vegetation

===Economic effects===

Bioengineering control works are not always necessarily cheaper in construction when compared to classical engineering structures. However, when taking into account their lifetime including their service and maintenance, they will normally turn out to be more economical.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Their special advantages are:

*lower construction costs compared to “hard” constructions
*lower maintenance and rehabilitation costs
*creation of useful green areas and woody plant populations on previously derelict land
*Useful for income generation 
The result of soil bioengineering protection works are living systems which develop further and maintain their balance by natural succession (i.e. by dynamic self–control, without artificial input of energy). If the right living but also non–living building materials and the appropriate types of construction are chosen, exceptionally high sustainability requiring little maintenance effort can be achieved. &lt;ref&gt;Schiechtl, H.M. and R.

A '''supramolecular assembly''' or "supermolecule" is a well defined complex of molecules held together by [[noncovalent bonding|noncovalent bonds]]. While a supramolecular assembly can be simply composed of two molecules (e.g., a [[DNA]] [[double helix]] or an [[inclusion compound]]), it is more often used to denote larger complexes of molecules that form sphere-, rod-, or sheet-like species. [[Micelles]], [[liposomes]] and [[biological membranes]] are examples of supramolecular assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/1468-6996/9/1/014109|pmid=27877935|pmc=5099804|title=Challenges and breakthroughs in recent research on self-assembly|year=2008|last1=Ariga|first1=Katsuhiko|first2=Jonathan P|first3=Michael V|first4=Ajayan|first5=Richard|first6=Somobrata|journal=Science and Technology of Advanced Materials|volume=9|issue=1|pages=014109|last2=Hill|last3=Lee|last4=Vinu|last5=Charvet|last6=Acharya|bibcode=2008STAdM...9a4109A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dimensions of supramolecular assemblies can range from nanometers to micrometers. Thus they allow access to nanoscale objects using a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] approach in far fewer steps than a single molecule of similar dimensions.

The process by which a supramolecular assembly forms is called [[molecular self-assembly]]. Some try to distinguish [[self-assembly]] as the process by which individual molecules form the defined aggregate. [[Self-organization]], then, is the process by which those aggregates create higher-order structures. This can become useful when talking about [[liquid crystal]]s and [[block copolymer]]s.

==Templating reactions==
{{main article|Template reaction}}
[[File:18-crown-6 was synthesized using potassium ion as the template cation.png|thumb|[[18-crown-6]] can be synthesized from  using potassium ion as the template cation]]

[[File:Illustrations of a. metal-organic frameworks and b. supramolecular coordination complexes.png|thumb|Illustrations of a. metal-organic frameworks and b. supramolecular coordination complexes]]

As studied in [[coordination chemistry]], [[metal ions]] (usually [[transition metal ions]]) exist in solution bound to ligands,  In many cases, the coordination sphere defines geometries conducive to reactions either between ligands or involving ligands and other external reagents.

A well known metal-ion-templating was described by [[Charles J. Pedersen|Charles Pederson]] in his synthesis of various [[crown ethers]] using metal cations as template. For example, [[18-crown-6]] strongly coordinates potassium ion thus can be prepared through the [[Williamson ether synthesis]] using potassium ion as the template metal.

Metal ions are frequently used for assembly of large supramolecular structures. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are one example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cook, T. R.; Zheng, Y.; Stang, P. J.|title= Metal-organic frameworks and self-assembled supramolecular coordination complexes: Comparing and contrasting the design, synthesis, and functionality of metal-organic materials|journal= Chem.

SCCs are discrete systems where selected metals and ligands undergo self-assembly to form finite supramolecular complexes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Paul, R. L.; Bell, Z. R.; Jeffery, J.

[[Hydrogen bond]]-assisted supramolecular assembly is the process of assembling small organic molecules to form large supramolecular structures by non-covalent hydrogen bonding interactions. The directionality, reversibility, and strong bonding nature of hydrogen bond make it an attractive and useful approach in supramolecular assembly. Functional groups such as [[carboxylic acids]], [[urea]]s, [[amines]], and [[amides]] are commonly used to assemble higher order structures upon hydrogen bonding.

Hydrogen bond play an essential role in the assembly of secondary and tertiary structures of large biomolecules. [[DNA double helix]] is formed by hydrogen bonding between [[nucleobases]]: adenine and thymine forms two hydrogen bonds, while guanine and cytosine forms three hydrogen bonds (Figure "Hydrogen bonds in (a) DNA duplex formation"). Another prominent example of hydrogen bond-assisted assembly in nature is the formation of protein secondary structures. Both the [[α-helix]] and [[β-sheet]] are formed through hydrogen bonding between the amide hydrogen and the amide carbonyl oxygen (Figure "Hydrogen bonds in (b) protein β-sheet structure").

In supramolecular chemistry, hydrogen bonds have been broadly applied to [[crystal engineering]], [[molecular recognition]], and [[catalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lehn, J.

This supramolecular aggregates has been used as templates to engineering other crystal structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Seto, C. T.; Whitesides, G.

==Applications==
Supramolecular assemblies have no specific applications but are the subject of many intriguing reactions.  A supramolecular assembly of [[peptide amphiphiles]] in the form of nanofibers has been shown to promote the growth of neurons.&lt;ref name=Stupp/&gt; An advantage to this supramolecular approach is that the nanofibers will degrade back into the individual peptide molecules that can be broken down by the body.  By [[molecular self-assembly|self-assembling]] of dendritic dipeptides, hollow cylinders can be produced. The cylindrical assemblies possess internal helical order and self-organize into columnar [[liquid crystal]]line lattices. When inserted into vesicular membranes, the porous cylindrical assemblies mediate transport of protons across the membrane.&lt;ref name=Percec1/&gt; [[Molecular self-assembly|Self-assembly]] of dendrons generates arrays of nanowires.&lt;ref name=Percec2/&gt; Electron donor-acceptor complexes comprise the core of the cylindrical supramolecular assemblies, which further self-organize into two-dimensional columnar [[liquid crystal]]ine lattices. Each cylindrical supramolecular assembly functions as an individual wire. High charge carrier mobilities for holes and electrons were obtained.

'''''Walkabout''''' is a [[novel]] written by [[James Vance Marshall]], first published in [[1959 in literature|1959]] as ''The Children''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Children|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/children/oclc/11073830&amp;referer=brief_results|work=OCLC Worldcat|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is about two children who get lost in the [[Outback|Australian Outback]] and are helped by an [[Indigenous Australian|Aborigine]] on his [[walkabout]]. [[Walkabout (film)|A film based on the book, with the same title]] came out in 1971, but deviated from the original plot.

==Plot summary==
{{plot|date=April 2014}}

The book opens with two American siblings, Peter and Mary, in a gully in the Australian outback. They are lost as a result of a plane crash. Peter says they should seek out their uncle, who lives in [[Adelaide]]; Mary agrees and they begin walking across the desert, but they don't know that it is across the other side.

The next day they keep walking and searching for food but their efforts are in vain. Suddenly, an Aborigine appears and startles them, mostly due to his nudity. Hoping to make him leave, Mary glares at him. This proves ineffective. Hoping to find out about the strangers, he inspects both of them but finds nothing of interest, so he leaves.

Peter and Mary, shocked at losing their only hope for survival, follow him. Peter attempts to communicate with him through gestures of eating and drinking and the Aborigine comprehends their situation. He indicates that they should follow him, which they do. He arrives at a [[Depression (geology)|waterhole]] where the children drink their fill. Then, the Aborigine prepares food for the hungry children. After this, he begins to lead the children to the next waterhole.

The problems of the lack of communication shows clearly in this book. The Aborigine misreads Mary's look of disgust at his nakedness and thinks she has seen the spirit of death and is about to die soon and falls into a mental euthanasia.

When the trio arrived at the next waterhole, the symptoms of the flu Peter has unwittingly passed on to him start to show in the Aborigine.  He begins to worry and decides he must tell the children he needs a burial platform to keep bad spirits from his body and to keep the snakes from "molesting his body" after his death. Peter is gathering firewood so to avoid interrupting a man at work, the Aborigine seeks Mary who is bathing. The Aborigine doesn't see a bath as something private; he arrives at the pool and Mary is terrified; she begins to threaten the Aborigine with snarls and a rock. He is confused and becomes depressed, believing that he will not have his burial platform.

Mary goes to Peter and tells him to leave with her but Peter is concerned about the Aborigine so Mary is forced to stay. Peter tells her that the Aborigine is very sick; he realizes that the Aborigine could die while Mary refuses to believe that the flu could be fatal, not understanding the native boy's fear of the Spirit of Death he believes she saw in him. Soon, Mary goes to investigate. Finally, she acknowledges that he is actually dying and forgives him. She lays his head in her lap and he touches her hair. Mary realizes that they are not so different, despite his appearance and language. He dies later in the night. They bury him and leave for the food and water-filled valley Peter was told about by the Aborigine before he died.

They stop at a pool where they eat some [[common yabby|yabbies]], observe [[platypus]] and leave. In a valley rich in water, food, and wildlife, they survive for many days with the skills learned from the Aborigine. They also discover some wet clay which they use to draw pictures: Peter draws nature while Mary draws stylish women and her dream house. Eventually, the children see smoke and see Aboriginal swimmers. One of the swimmers, a man, sees the drawings. His son owns a "warrigal", or pet dog, which serves as a link between the boy and Peter. The father sees Mary's dream house and realizes  Mary and Peter seek civilization. In a wide variety of gestures and drawings, he tells the children that there is a house like that across the hills and demonstrates how to reach there. The overjoyed children begin their trek back to civilization.

==Reception==
It is by far Vance's most popular work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=White Out (Book Review)|journal=Publisher's Weekly|date=2000-10-23|volume=247|issue=43|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; due in large part to the success of the related film.  Reviewers have praised ''Walkabout'' for its detailed and accurate descriptions of the Australian environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Walkabout|journal=Atlantic Monthly|date=April 2012|volume=309|issue=3|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming==

''Welwitschia'' is named after the Austrian botanist and doctor [[Friedrich Welwitsch]], who was the first European to describe the plant, in 1859 in present-day Angola. Welwitsch was so overwhelmed by the plant that he, "could do nothing but kneel down and gaze at it, half in fear lest a touch should prove it a figment of the imagination."&lt;ref name=Kew&gt;{{cite web|title=Welwitschia mirabilis (tree tumbo)|url=http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/plants-fungi/welwitschia-mirabilis-tree-tumbo|website=Kew Royal Botanical Gardens|publisher=Kew Royal Botanical Gardens|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] of the [[Linnean Society of London]], using Welwitsch's description and collected material along with material from the artist [[Thomas Baines]] who had independently recorded the plant in Namibia, described the species.&lt;ref name="LinnSoc"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/8355#page/186/mode/1up |title=Extract from a letter, addressed to Sir William J. Hooker, on the botany of Benguiela, Mossameded, &amp;C, in Western Africa. By Frederick Welwitsche, Esq., M.D., A.L.S.

Botany |volume=5 |year=1861 |pages=182–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PlantZ&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gotten|first1=Alice|title=Welwitschia mirabilis|url=http://www.plantzafrica.com/plantwxyz/welwitschia.htm|website=PlantZAfrica|publisher=South African National Biodiversity Institute|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welwitsch proposed calling the genus ''Tumboa'' after what he believed to be the local name, ''tumbo''. Hooker asked Welwitsch for permission to name the genus ''Welwitschia'' instead. Welwitsch concurred and supplied some well-preserved material from which Hooker was able to make substantial progress in determining its botanical affinities.&lt;ref name="HookWel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/mobot31753002433701 |last=Hooker|first= Joseph Dalton|title= On Welwitschia, a new genus of Gnetaceae. Transactions of the Linnean Society v.24 (1864) pp 1-46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The taxonomy of ''Welwitschia'' subsequently changed intermittently with the development of new classification systems (see [[Flowering plant#History of classification|Flowering plants: History of classification]]), however, its current taxonomic status is essentially the same as Hooker's placement.

Most botanists have treated ''Welwitschia'' as a distinct [[monotypic taxon|monotypic]] [[genus]] in a monotypic family or even [[order (biology)|order]].  Most recent systems place ''Welwitschia mirabilis'' in its own family [[Welwitschiaceae]] in the [[gymnosperm]] order [[Gnetales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevens|first= P. F. |title=Angiosperm Phylogeny (2001 onwards) - Version 9, June 2008 |url=http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APWeb/|website=www.mobot.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
After germination, the seedling produces two [[cotyledon]]s which grow to {{Convert|25–35|mm||abbr=on}} in length, and have reticulate venation.&lt;ref name=Singh&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=V.P.|title=Gymnosperm (naked seeds plant) : structure and development|date=2006|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|isbn=978-8176256711|page=576|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F6B_xHO-IpoC&amp;pg=PA576&amp;lpg=PA576&amp;dq=Welwitschia+cotyledons&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ftTI3-yX40&amp;sig=eIM_8Qm06kHfVq0BoYwecImZKL0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1iJK4wcPKAhVB3mMKHb8hCPEQ6AEIRjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Welwitschia%20cotyledons&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, two foliage leaves are produced at the edge of a woody bilobed crown. The permanent leaves are opposite (at right angles to the cotyledons), amphistomatic (producing stomata on both sides of the leaf), parallel-veined and ribbon-shaped. Shortly after the appearance of the foliage leaves, the apical meristem dies and meristematic activity is transferred to the periphery of the crown.&lt;ref name=" Bornman"/&gt;

The two foliage [[leaf|leaves]] grow continuously from a [[Meristem|basal meristem]] reaching lengths up to {{Convert|4|m||abbr=on}}. The tips of the leaves split and fray into several well-separated strap-shaped sections by the distortions of the woody portions surrounding the apical slit, and also by wind and [[Adventitiousness|adventitious]] external injuries.&lt;ref name=" Bornman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waynesword.palomar.edu/welwit.htm|title=Welwitschia|website=waynesword.palomar.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest specimens may be no more than {{Convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall above ground, but the circumference of the leaves in contact with the sand may exceed {{Convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Bornman et al 72" /&gt;

''Welwitschia'' has an elongated shallow root system consisting of "a tapering taproot with one or more non-tapering extensions, some pronounced lateral roots, and a network of delicate spongy roots"&lt;ref name="Bornman et al 72"&gt;Bornman, C.H., J.A. Elsworthy, V. Butler and C.E.J Botha (1972).  ''Welwitschia mirabilis'': Observations on general habit, seed, seedling, and leaf characteristics.  ''Madoqua'' Series II 1:53-66.&lt;/ref&gt; and a woody fibrous unbranched main stem.&lt;ref name="Bornman" /&gt;  The roots extend to a depth roughly equal to the span of the living leaves from tip to tip.&lt;ref name=" Bornman"/&gt; The main stem consists of an unbranched woody crown roughly shaped like an inverted cone.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The only branching in the shoot system occurs in the reproductive branches, which bear strobili.

The species is [[plant sexuality|dioecious]], with separate male and female plants. [[Pollination|Fertilization]] is carried out by insects including [[Diptera|flies]] and [[Hemiptera|true bugs]]. The commonest of the true bugs attending ''Welwitschia'' is a member of the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Pyrrhocoridae]], ''[[Probergrothius angolensis]]'', but a hypothesized role in pollination has so far not been demonstrated. Infrequently, wasps and bees also play a role as pollinators of ''Welwitschia''. At least some of the pollinators are attracted by "nectar" produced on both male and female [[strobili]].&lt;ref name="Wetschnig and Depisch"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wetschnig W, Depisch B|year= 1999|title=[Chrysomya albiceps Pollination biology of ''Welwitschia mirabilis'' HOOK. f. (Welwitschiaceae, Gnetopsida)]|journal=Phyton-Annales Rei Botanicae|volume=39|pages=167|url=http://www.zobodat.at/pdf/PHY_39_1_0167-0183.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Welwitschia'' has been classified as a CAM plant ([[crassulacean acid metabolism]]) after reconciliation of some initially contradictory and confusing data.&lt;ref&gt;Eller, B.M, D. J. von Willert, E. Brinckmann and R. Baasch (1983). Ecophysiological studies on ''Welwitschia mirabilis'' in the Namib desert.  ''South African Journal of Botany'' 2:209-223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;von Willert, D.J. N. Armbruster, T. Drees and M. Zaborowski (2005).  ''Welwitschia mirabilis'': CAM or not CAM - what is the answer?  ''Functional Plant Biology'' 32:389-395.&lt;/ref&gt; There are however some very puzzling aspects to the matter; for example, the employment of the CAM metabolism is very slight, which was part of the reason that it took so long to establish its presence at all; it is not understood why this should be.

The age of individual plants is difficult to assess, but many plants may be over 1000 years old. Some individuals may be more than 2000 years old.&lt;ref name=" Bornman"/&gt; Because ''Welwitschia'' only produces a single pair of foliage leaves, the plant was thought by some to be [[neoteny|neotenic]], consisting essentially of a "giant [[seedling]]." However, research showed that its anatomy is not consistent with the giant seedling idea. Instead, the plant is more accurately thought of as achieving its unusual morphology as a result of having "lost its head" (apical meristem) at an early stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2442386|title=Welwitschia mirabilis and Neoteny|first=P.|last=Martens|date=4 September 1977|publisher=|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=64|issue=7|pages=916–920|doi=10.2307/2442386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
''Welwitschia mirabilis'' is endemic to the [[Kaokoveld]] Centre.&lt;ref name="van Wyk"&gt;van Wyk, A.E. and G.F. Smith (2001). ''Regions of Floristic Endemism in Southern Africa''. Umdaus Press, Hatfield.&lt;/ref&gt; The population is distributed southwards from the [[Bentiaba River]] in southern Angola, to the [[Kuiseb River]] in Namibia&lt;ref&gt;Kers, L.E. (1967). The distribution of ''Welwitschia mirabilis'' Hook. F. ''Svensk Botanisk Tidskrift'' 61:97-125&lt;/ref&gt; and up to {{Convert|100|km||abbr=on}} inland of the coast.&lt;ref name=" Bornman"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bornman | first = Chris | title = Welwitschia | publisher = Struik | location = Cape Town | year = 1978 | isbn = 0-86977-097-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The area is extremely arid: the coast is recorded as having almost zero rainfall, while less than {{Convert|100|mm||abbr=on}} of rain falls annually below the escarpment in the wet season from February to April.&lt;ref name="van Wyk" /&gt;  Populations tend to occur in ephemeral water courses, indicating a dependence on ground water in addition to precipitation from fog.&lt;ref&gt;Henchel, J.R. and M.K. Seely (2000).  Long-term growth patterns of ''Welwitschia mirabilis'', a long-lived plant of the Namib Desert (including a bibliography).  ''Plant Ecology'' 150:7-26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==
''Welwitschia mirabilis'' grows readily from [[seed]], which may be bought from specialty seed dealers.  The seeds have been shown to display [[orthodox seed]] behavior, which in general means that they may be stored for long periods at suitably low humidity and temperature. ''Welwitschia'' seeds naturally develop suitably low water concentrations as they ripen.&lt;ref name="Whitaker et al 2004"&gt;Whitaker, C., P. Berjak, H. Kolberg, and N.W. Pammenter (2004). Responses to various manipulations, and storage potential, of seeds of the unique desert gymnosperm, ''Welwitschia mirabilis'' Hook. fil. ''South African Journal of Botany'' 70: 622-630.&lt;/ref&gt;

Removal of the outer seed coverings enhances germination performance, which suggests that the seeds may display non-deep physiological dormancy.&lt;ref name="Whitaker et al 2004" /&gt; On planting the seed it is necessary to keep it moist, but not immersed in water, for the first two weeks of cultivation; it has been suggested that soaking the seeds in water before planting interferes with germination.&lt;ref name="Whitaker et al 2004" /&gt; Seeds collected from the wild often are heavily contaminated with spores of the fungus ''[[Aspergillus niger]] var. phoenicis'',&lt;ref&gt;Cooper-Driver, G.A., C. Wagner and H. Kolberg (2000).  Patterns of ''Aspergillus niger'' var. ''phoenicis'' (Corda) Al-Musallam infection in Namibian populations of ''Welwitschia mirabilis'' Hook. f.  ''Journal of Arid Environments'' 46:181-198&lt;/ref&gt; which causes them to rot shortly after they germinate.

The fungal inoculum infects the growing cones of ''W. mirabilis'' early during their development, and a sharp increase in infection occurs when the pollination drops appear; through those drops the fungal spores may gain access to the interior of the developing seed.&lt;ref name="Whitaker et al 2008"&gt;Whitaker, C., N. Pammenter, and P. Berjak(2008). Infection of the cones and seeds of ''Welwitschia mirabilis'' by ''Aspergillus niger'' var. ''phoenicis'' in the Namib-Naukluft Park. ''South African Journal of Botany'' 74:41-50&lt;/ref&gt;  Seeds in the wild may therefore be obliterated through fungal action even before they are fully developed. Seeds from botanical gardens or other cultivated sources are much cleaner and less likely to rot.  The fungicide [[tebuconazole]] may be useful in controlling limited ''[[Aspergillus niger|A. niger]]'' seed infection.&lt;ref name="Whitaker et al 2008" /&gt;

==Conservation==
The population of ''Welwitschia mirabilis'' in the wild is reasonably satisfactory at present. Plants in [[Angola]] are better protected than those in [[Namibia]], because of the relatively high concentration of [[land mine]]s in Angola, which keep collectors away.&lt;ref name=Kew/&gt;

Although ''Welwitschia mirabilis'' is not at present immediately threatened, there being abundant populations over a large area, its status is far from secure; its recruitment and growth rates are low, and its range, though wide, covers only a single compact, ecologically limited and vulnerable area. The remarkable longevity of Welwitschia favours its survival of temporary periods adverse to reproduction, but it offers no protection against circumstances of direct threat, such as overgrazing and disease. Fungal infection of female cones severely reduces seed viability, reducing already inherently low recruitment. Other threats include injury from off-road vehicles, collection of wild plants and overgrazing by zebras, rhinos, and domestic animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Welwitschia-mirabilis.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612052103/http://www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Welwitschia-mirabilis.htm |archivedate=2013-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Xylotomy''' is the preparation of small slivers of wood for examination under a [[microscope]], often using a [[microtome]].

It is useful for providing [[forensics|forensic]] evidence in some [[criminal]] cases where finding a fragment of wood on an individual and matching it to a weapon used in a crime would be helpful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/forensic-science/xylotomy] World of Forensic Science article&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.uiuc.edu/idnc/Default/Skins/UIUC/Client.asp?Skin%3DUIUC%26AppName%3D2%26enter%3Dtrue%26BaseHref%3DTUC%2F1935%2F05%2F28%26EntityId%3DAr00812 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 18, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208160358/http://www.library.uiuc.edu/idnc/Default/Skins/UIUC/Client.asp?Skin=UIUC |archivedate=February 8, 2009 }} Illinois Digital Newspaper Collection&lt;/ref&gt;  During the trial of Bruno [[Richard Hauptmann]], accused in the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]] during the 1930s, the xylotomist Arthur Koehler was able to provide crucial evidence by linking a piece of [[pine]] from a ladder used in a [[kidnapping]] to one particular factory whose machinery was defective, and from there to one particular [[lumberyard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,872780,00.html] Nightmare remembered&lt;/ref&gt;  Koehler searched for eighteen months for the yard, and presented his evidence dramatically in court by presenting the court with a chalk [[rubbing]] of the samples, which he made there and then, demonstrating that they were identical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,788508,00.html] New Jersey v. Hauptmann (Cont'd)&lt;/ref&gt;  He also matched other pieces of the ladder to a chisel used to create the joists, missing from the defendant's tool chest, and to a missing plank from the suspect's attic floor.

It may also be useful in [[forestry]] studies.  Identifying the [[species]] of a piece of wood is not always easy, in which case a [[xylotheque]] may provide samples with which the xylotomist can compare his own.  Xylotomy may be carried out by a [[forensic biology|forensic biologist]].  People who specialize in xylotomy are rare.
