'''77''' ('''seventy-seven''') is the [[natural number]] following [[76 (number)|76]] and preceding [[78 (number)|78]]. Seventy-seven is the smallest positive integer requiring five syllables in [[English language|English]].

==In mathematics==
'''77''' is:

*the 22nd discrete [[semiprime|biprime]] and the first of the (7.q) family.
*a [[Blum integer]] since both 7 and 11 are [[Gaussian integer|Gaussian prime]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A016105|2=Blum integers|accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In history==
During [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] in [[Sweden]] at the border with [[Norway]], "77" was used as a [[shibboleth]] ([[password]]), because the tricky pronunciation in Swedish made it easy to instantly discern whether the speaker was native [[Sweden|Swedish]], [[Norway|Norwegian]], or [[Germany|German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Easy as Pi: The Countless Ways We Use Numbers Every Day|first=Jamie|last=Buchan|publisher=Penguin|year=2010|isbn=9781606522783|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P93tAbdyf2MC&amp;pg=PT18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In religion==
In the [[Islam]]ic tradition, "77" figures prominently. [[Muhammad]] is reported to have explained, "Faith has sixty-odd, or seventy-odd branches, the highest and best of which is to declare that there is no god but God, and the lowest of which is to remove something harmful from a road. Shyness, too, is a branch of faith." While some scholars refrain from clarifying "sixty-odd or seventy-odd", various numbers have been suggested, 77 being the most common.&lt;ref name="Jamia Ashrafia Online"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jamiaashrafia.org/muh15.php |title=A Verdict of Mufti Muhammad Hassan |access-date=2008-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204224656/http://www.jamiaashrafia.org/muh15.php |archive-date=2008-12-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have gone so far as to delineate these branches.&lt;ref name="SunniPath: The Online Islamic Academy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=103&amp;CATE=24|title=Imam al-Tahanawi on the Seventy-Seven Branches|publisher=|access-date=2008-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620035424/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=103&amp;CATE=24|archive-date=2009-06-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gospel of Luke]] lists 77 generations from [[Adam]] to [[Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textexcavation.com/genealogyjesus.html|title=The genealogy of Jesus.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In religious numerology===
In certain numerological systems based on the English alphabet, the number 77 is associated with [[Jesus Christ]]. CHRIST is C&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, H&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8, R&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;18, I&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9, S&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;19, T&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;20, which added together equal 77.

'Liber 77' is the [[gematrian]] name for [[Liber OZ]]- a brief but popular publication by [[Aliester Crowley]]. The word 'oz', which means 'strength', is composed of two [[hebrew alphabet|hebrew letters]]- [[ayin]] and [[zayin]], which have gematrian values of 70 and 7 respectively, thus adding up to 77.

An '''adaptive grammar''' is a [[formal grammar]] that explicitly provides mechanisms within the [[Formal system|formalism]] to allow its own production rules to be manipulated.

==Overview==
[[John N. Shutt]] defines adaptive grammars as follows:

:ADAPTIVE GRAMMAR MODEL: A grammatical formalism that allows rule sets (aka sets of production rules) to be explicitly manipulated within a grammar.&lt;ref name="Shutt2001"&gt;Shutt, John N., "What is an Adaptive Grammar?" Web page dated 28 March 2001, at the URL: http://www.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/adapt/adapt.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of manipulation include rule addition, deletion, and modification.

===Early history===
The first description of grammar adaptivity (though not under that name) in the literature is generally&lt;ref name="Christiansen1990"&gt;Christiansen, Henning, "A [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1d4a/e919601b166856d5f7c35d080f99d38c9546.pdf Survey of Adaptable Grammars]," ''ACM SIGPLAN Notices'', Vol. 25 No. 11, pp. 35-44, Nov. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shutt1993"&gt;Shutt, John N., ''[http://digitalcommons.wpi.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1220&amp;context=computerscience-pubs Recursive Adaptable Grammars]'', Master’s Thesis, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, 1993. (16 December 2003 emended revision.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson2006"&gt;Jackson, Quinn Tyler, ''[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.403.8977 Adapting to Babel: Adaptivity and Context-Sensitivity in Parsing]'', Ibis Publications, Plymouth, Massachusetts, March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; taken to be in a paper by Alfonso Caracciolo di Forino published in 1963.&lt;ref name="Caracciolo1963"&gt;Caracciolo di Forino, Alfonso, "[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=367584 Some Remarks on the Syntax of Symbolic Programming Languages]," ''Communications of the ACM'', Vol. 6, No. 8., pp. 456-460, August 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; The next generally accepted reference to an adaptive formalism (''extensible context-free grammars'') came from Wegbreit in 1970&lt;ref name="Wegbreit"&gt;Wegbreit, Ben, ''[http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=AD0715332 Studies in Extensible Programming Languages]'', ESD-TR-70-297, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, May 1970.  In book form, Garland Publishing, Inc., New York, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; in the study of [[extensible programming]] languages, followed by the ''dynamic syntax'' of Hanford and Jones in 1973.&lt;ref name="Hanford&amp;Jones"&gt;Hanford, K.V. &amp; Jones, C.B., "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0066413873900037 Dynamic Syntax: A Concept for the Definition of the Syntax of Programming Languages]," ''Annual Review in Automatic Programming 7'', Pergamon Press, Oxford, pp. 115-142, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaborative efforts===
Until fairly recently, much of the research into the [[formal system|formal]] properties of adaptive grammars was uncoordinated between researchers, only first being summarized by Henning Christiansen in 1990&lt;ref name="Christiansen1990"/&gt; in response to a paper in ''ACM [[SIGPLAN]] Notices'' by Boris Burshteyn.&lt;ref name="Burshteyn1990a"&gt;Burshteyn, Boris. "[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=382639 On the Modification of the Formal Grammar at Parse Time]", ''ACM SIGPLAN Notices'', Vol. 25 No. 5, pp. 117-123, May 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Engineering at the [[University of São Paulo]] has its [http://lta.poli.usp.br/ Adaptive Languages and Techniques Laboratory], specifically focusing on research and practice in adaptive technologies and theory. The LTA also maintains a page naming researchers in the field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcs.usp.br/~lta/union/index.php?cp=4&amp;categoria=28 http://www.pcs.usp.br/~lta/union/index.php?cp=4&amp;categoria=28] {{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology and taxonomy===
&lt;!--Note: Because this sub-field of formal grammar theory and practice is highly specialized and still in somewhat of a state of flux (particularly in its use of terms), this article makes extensive use of citations.--&gt;

While early efforts made reference to ''dynamic syntax''&lt;ref name="Hanford&amp;Jones"/&gt; and ''extensible'',&lt;ref name="Wegbreit"/&gt; ''modifiable'',&lt;ref name="Burshteyn1990b"&gt;Burshteyn, Boris, "[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=122196 Generation and Recognition of Formal Languages by Modifiable Grammars]," ''ACM SIGPLAN Notices'', Vol. 25 No. 12, pp. 45-53, December 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; ''dynamic'',&lt;ref name="Boullier1994"&gt;Boullier, Pierre, "[https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00074352/document Dynamic Grammars and Semantic Analysis]," INRIA Research Report No. 2322, August 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''adaptable''&lt;ref name="Christiansen1990"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Shutt originally called his Recursive Adaptive Grammars by the name Recursive ''Adaptable'' Grammars, and notes his change to ''adaptive'' at this URL: [http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/thesis/top.html John Shutt's MS Thesis].&lt;/ref&gt; grammars, more recent usage has tended towards the use of the term ''adaptive'' (or some variant such as ''adaptativa'',&lt;ref name="Iwai2000"&gt;Iwai, Margarete Keiko, ''Um formalismo gramatical adaptativo para linguagens dependentes de contexto'', Doctoral thesis, Department of Engineering, University of São Paulo, Brazil, January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bravo2004"&gt;Bravo, César, ''[http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/3/3141/tde-31032005-134438/publico/CESARPARIENTE.pdf Grámmaticas Livres de Contexto Adaptativas com verificação de aparência]'', Doctoral thesis, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of São Paulo, January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the publication language of the literature).&lt;ref name="Shutt1993"/&gt; Iwai refers to her formalism as ''adaptive grammars'',&lt;ref name="Iwai2000"/&gt; but this specific use of simply ''adaptive grammars'' is not typically currently used in the literature without name qualification. Moreover, no standardization or categorization efforts have been undertaken between various researchers, although several have made efforts in this direction.&lt;ref name="Shutt1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson2006"/&gt;

====The Shutt classification (and extensions)====
Shutt categorizes adaptive grammar models into two main categories:&lt;ref name="Shutt1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shutt2001b"&gt;Shutt, John N., "Imperative Adaptive Grammars" Web page dated 28 March 2001, at the URL: http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/adapt/imperative.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Imperative programming|Imperative]] adaptive grammars'' vary their rules based on a global [[State (computer science)|state]] changing over the ''time'' of the [[generative grammar|generation]] of a [[formal language|language]].
* ''[[Declarative programming|Declarative]] adaptive grammars'' vary their rules only over the ''space'' of the generation of a language (i.e., position in the syntax tree of the generated string).

Jackson refines Shutt's taxonomy, referring to changes over time as [[global variable|global]] and changes over space as [[local variable|local]], and adding a hybrid ''time-space'' category:&lt;ref name="Jackson2006"/&gt;

* ''Time-space adaptive grammars'' (''hybrids'') vary their rules over either the ''time'' or the ''space'' (or both) of the generation of a language (and local and global operations are explicitly differentiated by the notation for such changes).

==Adaptive formalisms in the literature==
Adaptive formalisms may be divided into two main categories: full grammar formalisms (adaptive grammars), and adaptive machines, upon which some grammar formalisms have been based.

===Adaptive grammar formalisms===
The following is a list (by no means complete) of grammar formalisms that, by Shutt's definition above, are considered to be (or have been classified by their own inventors as being) adaptive grammars. They are listed in their historical order of first mention in the literature.

====Extensible Context-Free Grammars (Wegbreit)====
Described in Wegbreit's doctoral dissertation in 1970,&lt;ref name="Wegbreit"/&gt; an extensible context-free grammar consists of a [[context-free grammar]] whose rule set is modified according to instructions output by a [[finite state transducer]] when reading the terminal prefix during a leftmost derivation.  Thus, the rule set varies over position in the generated string, but this variation ignores the hierarchical structure of the syntax tree.  Extensible context-free grammars were classified by Shutt as ''imperative''.&lt;ref name="Shutt1993"/&gt;

====Christiansen Grammars (Christiansen)====
First introduced in 1985 as ''Generative Grammars''&lt;ref name="Christiansen1985"&gt;Christiansen, Henning, "Syntax, Semantics, and Implementation Strategies for Programming Languages with Powerful Abstraction Mechanisms," ''Proceedings of the 18th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences'', Vol. 2, pp. 57-66, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; and later more elaborated upon,&lt;ref name="Christiansen1988"&gt;Christiansen, Henning, "[http://akira.ruc.dk/~henning/publications/SSofExtLang1988.pdf The Syntax and Semantics of Extensible Languages]," ''Datalogiske skrifter 14'', Roskilde University, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Christiansen grammars (apparently dubbed so by Shutt, possibly due to conflict with Chomsky generative grammars) are an adaptive extension of [[attribute grammar]]s. Christiansen grammars were classified by Shutt as ''declarative''.&lt;ref name="Shutt1993"/&gt;

The redoubling language &lt;math&gt;L = \{ww | w \mbox{ is a letter}\}&lt;/math&gt; is demonstrated as follows:&lt;ref name="Christiansen1988"/&gt;

 &lt;program↓''G''&gt;       →   &lt;dcl↓''G''↑''w''&gt; &lt;body↓{''w-rule''}&gt;

 where ''w-rule''  =
 &lt;body↓''G''’&gt;         →   ''w''

 &lt;dcl↓''G''↑''ch''•''w''&gt;     →   &lt;char↓''G''↑''ch''&gt; &lt;dcl↓''G''↑''w''&gt;
 &lt;dcl↓G↑&lt;&gt;&gt;       →   &lt;ε&gt;
 &lt;char↓G↑a&gt;       →   a
&lt;!--:(Note on notation: TBD.)--&gt;

====Bottom-Up Modifiable Grammars, Top-Down Modifiable Grammars, and USSA (Burshteyn)====
First introduced in May 1990&lt;ref name="Burshteyn1990a"/&gt; and later expanded upon in December 1990,&lt;ref name="Burshteyn1990b"/&gt; ''modifiable grammars'' explicitly provide a mechanism for the addition and deletion of rules during a parse. In response to the ''ACM SIGPLAN Notices'' responses, Burshteyn later modified his formalism and introduced his adaptive ''Universal Syntax and Semantics Analyzer'' (USSA) in 1992.&lt;ref name="Burshteyn1992"&gt;Burshteyn, Boris, "[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=130724 USSA–Universal Syntax and Semantics Analyzer]," ''ACM SIGPLAN Notices'', Vol. 27 No. 1, pp. 42-60, January 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; These formalisms were classified by Shutt as ''imperative''.&lt;ref name="Shutt1993"/&gt;

====Recursive Adaptive Grammars (Shutt)====
Introduced in 1993, Recursive Adaptive Grammars (RAGs) were an attempt to introduce a [[Turing completeness|Turing powerful]] formalism that maintained much of the elegance of [[context-free]] grammars.&lt;ref name="Shutt1993"/&gt; Shutt self-classifies RAGs as being a ''declarative'' formalism.

====Dynamic Grammars (Boullier)====
Boullier's ''dynamic grammars'', introduced in 1994,&lt;ref name="Boullier1994"/&gt; appear to be the first adaptive grammar family of grammars to rigorously introduce the notion of a time continuum of a parse as part of the notation of the grammar formalism itself.&lt;ref name="Jackson2006"/&gt; Dynamic grammars are a sequence of grammars, with each grammar ''G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' differing in some way from other grammars in the sequence, over time. Boullier's main paper on dynamic grammars also defines a dynamic parser, the machine that effects a parse against these grammars, and shows examples of how his formalism can handle such things as [[type checking]], [[Extensible programming language|extensible languages]], [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]], and other constructs typically considered to be in the semantic domain of programming language translation.

====Adaptive Grammars (Iwai)====
The work of Iwai in 2000&lt;ref name="Iwai2000"/&gt; takes the adaptive automata of Neto&lt;ref name="Neto1994"&gt;Neto, João Jose, "Adaptive Automata for Context-Sensitive Languages," ''ACM SIGPLAN Notices'', Vol. 29 No. 9, pp. 115-124, September 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; further by applying adaptive automata to [[context-sensitive grammar]]s. Iwai's adaptive grammars (note the qualifier by name) allow for three operations during a parse: ? query (similar in some respects to a [[syntactic predicate]], but tied to inspection of rules from which modifications are chosen), + addition, and - deletion (which it shares with its predecessor adaptive automata).

====§-Calculus (Jackson)====
Introduced in 2000&lt;ref name="Jackson2000a"&gt;Jackson, Quinn Tyler, "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Quinn_Jackson/publication/2497744_Adaptive_Predicates_in_Natural_Language_Parsing/links/0fcfd50c9e2125678e000000.pdf Adaptive Predicates in Natural Language Parsing]," ''Perfection'', Vol. 1 No. 4, April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and most fully discussed in 2006,&lt;ref name="Jackson2006"/&gt; the §-Calculus (§ here pronounced ''meta-ess'') allows for the explicit addition, deletion, and modification of productions within a grammar, as well as providing for [[syntactic predicate]]s. This formalism is self-classified by its creator as both ''imperative'' and ''adaptive'', or, more specifically, as a ''time-space'' adaptive grammar formalism, and was further classified by others as being an [[analytic grammar|analytic]] formalism.&lt;ref name="Bravo2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Okhotin2004"&gt;Okhotin, Alexander, ''Boolean Grammars: Expressive Power and Algorithms'', Doctoral thesis, School of Computing, Queens University, Kingston, Ontario, August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The redoubling language &lt;math&gt;L = \{ww | w \in \{a,b\}^+\}&lt;/math&gt; is demonstrated as follows:

 grammar ww {
  S ::= #phi(A.X&lt;-"") R;
  R ::= $C('[ab]') #phi(A.X&lt;-A.X C) #phi(N&lt;=A.X) N | R;
 };

(Note on notation: In the above example, the ''#phi(...)'' statements identify the points in the production ''R'' that modify the grammar explicitly. ''#phi(A.X&lt;-A.X C)'' represents a ''global'' modification (over time) and the ''#phi(N&lt;=A.X)'' statement identifies a ''local'' modification (over space). The ''#phi(A.X&lt;-"")'' statement in the ''S'' production effectively declares a global production called ''A.X'' by placing the [[empty string]] into that production before its reference by ''R''.)

====Adaptive Devices (Neto &amp; Pistori)====
First described by Neto in 2001,&lt;ref name="Neto2001"&gt;Neto, João Jose, "[ftp://nozdr.ru/biblio/kolxo3/Cs/CsLn/Implementation%20and%20Application%20of%20Automata,%206%20conf.,%20CIAA%202001(LNCS2494,%20Springer,%202002)(ISBN%203540004009)(298s).pdf#page=243 Adaptive Rule-Driven Devices: General Formulation and Case Study]," B. W. Watson, D. Wood (Eds.): [[Conference on Implementation and Application of Automata|''Implementation and Application of Automata 6th International Conference'', CIAA 2001]], ''Lecture Notes in Computer Science'', Vol. 2494, Pretoria, South Africa, Springer-Verlag, pp. 234–250, 23–25 July 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; adaptive devices were later enhanced and expanded upon by Pistori in 2003.&lt;ref name="Pistori2003"&gt;Pistori, Hemerson, ''[http://www.gpec.ucdb.br/pistori/disciplinas/ml/arquivos/apresentacao_tese.pdf Tecnologia Adaptativa em Engenharia de Computação: Estado da Arte e Aplicações]'', Doctoral thesis, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of São Paulo, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adapser (Carmi)====
In 2002,&lt;ref&gt;Carmi, Adam, "[https://research.ibm.com/haifa/info/ple/papers/AdapserPaper.pdf Adapser: An LALR(1) Adaptive Parser]{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}," ''The Israeli Workshop on Programming Languages &amp; Development Environments,''  Haifa, Israel, 1 July 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Carmi introduced an [[LALR parser|LALR(1)]]-based adaptive grammar formalism known as ''Adapser''. Specifics of the formalism do not appear to have been released.

====Adaptive CFGs with Appearance Checking (Bravo)====
In 2004,&lt;ref name="Bravo2004"/&gt; César Bravo introduced the notion of merging the concept of ''appearance checking''&lt;ref name="Salomaa1973"&gt;Salomaa, Arto, ''Formal Languages'', Academic Press, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; with ''adaptive context-free grammars'', a restricted form of Iwai's adaptive grammars,&lt;ref name="Iwai2000"/&gt; showing these new grammars, called ''Adaptive CFGs with Appearance Checking'' to be [[Turing complete|Turing powerful]].

===Adaptive machine formalisms===
The formalisms listed below, while not grammar formalisms, either serve as the basis of full grammar formalisms, or are included here because they are adaptive in nature. They are listed in their historical order of first mention in the literature.

;Self-Modifying Finite State Automata (Shutt &amp; Rubinstein)

:Introduced in 1994 by Shutt and Rubinstein,&lt;ref name="Shutt&amp;Rubinstein"&gt;Shutt, John &amp; Rubinstein, Roy, "[http://digitalcommons.wpi.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1184&amp;context=computerscience-pubs Self-Modifying Finite Automata]," in B. Pehrson and I. Simon, editors, ''Technology and Foundations: Information Processing ‘94 Vol. I: Proceedings of 13th IFIP World Computer Congress'', Amsterdam: North-Holland, pp. 493-498, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-Modifying Finite State Automata (SMFAs) are shown to be, in a restricted form, [[Turing complete|Turing powerful]].

; Adaptive Automata (Neto)

:In 1994,&lt;ref name="Neto1994"/&gt; Neto introduced the machine he called a ''structured pushdown automaton'', the core of adaptive automata theory as pursued by Iwai,&lt;ref name="Iwai2000"/&gt; Pistori,&lt;ref name="Pistori2003"/&gt; Bravo&lt;ref name="Bravo2004"/&gt; and others. This formalism allows for the operations of ''inspection'' (similar to [[syntactic predicate]]s, as noted above relating to Iwai's adaptive grammars), ''addition'', and ''deletion'' of rules.

'''Alligation''' is an old and practical method of solving [[arithmetic]] problems related to mixtures of ingredients. There are two types of alligation: '''alligation medial''', used to find the quantity of a mixture given the quantities of its ingredients, and '''alligation alternate''', used to find the amount of each ingredient needed to make a mixture of a given quantity. Alligation medial is merely a matter of finding a [[weighted mean]]. Alligation alternate is more complicated and involves organizing the ingredients into high and low pairs which are then traded off.

Two further variations on Alligation occur : Alligation Partial and Alligation Total  (see John King's Arithmetic Book 1795 which includes worked examples.)  The technique is not used in schools although it is used still in pharmacies for quick calculation of quantities.

==Examples==

===Alligation medial===
Suppose you make a cocktail drink combination out of 1/2 [[Coca-Cola|Coke]], 1/4 [[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]], and 1/4 orange soda. The Coke has 120 grams of sugar per liter, the Sprite has 100 grams of sugar per liter, and the orange soda has 150 grams of sugar per liter. How much sugar does the drink have? This is an example of alligation medial because you want to find the amount of sugar in the mixture given the amounts of sugar in its ingredients. The solution is just to find the weighted average by composition:

:&lt;math&gt;{1\over2}\times 120 + {1\over4}\times 100 + {1\over4}\times 150 = 122.5&lt;/math&gt; grams per liter

===Alligation alternate===
Suppose you like 1% milk, but you have only 3% whole milk and ½% low fat milk. How much of each should you mix to make an 8-ounce cup of 1% milk? This is an example of alligation alternate because you want to find the amount of two ingredients to mix to form a mixture with a given amount of fat. Since there are only two ingredients, there is only one possible way to form a pair. The difference of 3% from the desired 1%, 2%, is assigned to the low fat milk, and the difference of ½% from the desired 1%, ½%, is assigned alternately to the whole milk. The total amount, 8 ounces, is then divided by the sum &lt;math&gt;2 + {1\over2} = {5\over2}&lt;/math&gt; to yield &lt;math&gt;16\over 5&lt;/math&gt;, and the amounts of the two ingredients are

:&lt;math&gt;{16\over 5}\times{1\over 2} = {8\over 5}&lt;/math&gt; ounces whole milk and &lt;math&gt;{16\over 5}\times 2 = {32\over 5}&lt;/math&gt; ounces low fat milk.

{{1728}}

A general formula that works for both alligation "alternate" and alligation "medial" is the following:
Aa + Bb = Cc.

In this formula, A is the volume of ingredient A and a is its mixture coefficient (i.e. a= 3%); B is volume of ingredient B and b is its mixture coefficient; and C is the desired volume C, and c is its mixture coefficient. So in the above example we get: A(0.03) + B(0.005) = 8oz(0.01). We know B = (8oz-A), and so can easily solve for A and B to get 1.6 and 6.4oz, respectively. Using this formula you can solve for any of the 6 variables A,a,B,b,C,c, regardless of whether you're dealing with medial, alternate, etc.

===Repeated Dilutions===

8 liters are drawn from a cask full of pure wine and is then filled with water. This operation is performed three more times. The ratio of the quantity of wine now left in cask to that of water is 16: 65. How much wine did the cask hold originally? This is an example of a problem that involves repeated dilutions of a given solution. &lt;ref&gt;https://learningpundits.com/module-view/42-mixtures-and-alligations/1-tips-on-mixtures-and-alligations/&lt;/ref&gt;

* Let Vw be the volume of wine in the cask originally.
* Let Vt be the total volume of liquid in the cask.
* Let X be the percentage of wine in the cask originally.

X = original volume of wine/ total volume of liquid in the cask = Vw / Vt

When 8 liters are drawn out, the volume of wine is reduced by 8 X liters while the total volume of liquid remains unchanged as it is re-filled with water.

Let X’ be the new percentage of wine in the cask after this operation

X’  = (original volume of wine – 8 X) / total volume of liquid in the cask

X’  = [Vw – 8 (Vw/ Vt)] / Vt

X’  = X (Vt – 8) / Vt

After 4 such replacement operations, X’’’’ = X [(Vt – 8)/ Vt] ^ 4

From the problem, X’’’’ = 16/ (16 + 65) = 16/ 81

Also, since originally the cask was full of pure wine, X = 1

[(Vt – 8)/ Vt] ^ 4 = 16/ 81

&lt;nowiki&gt;=&gt; Vt = 24 liters&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Am. Math. Soc.'' '''135''', p.199. (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Helstrom metric''' (named after [[Carl W. Helstrom]])&lt;ref&gt;C.W.

(1967)&lt;/ref&gt; defines an infinitesimal distance between [[density matrix]] operators defining [[quantum state]]s. It is a quantum generalization of the [[Fisher information metric]], and is identical to the [[Fubini–Study metric]]&lt;ref&gt;P. Facchi, R. Kulkarni, V. I. Man'ko, G. Marmo, E. C. G. Sudarshan, F. Ventriglia "[https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5219 Classical and Quantum Fisher Information in the Geometrical Formulation of Quantum Mechanics]", ''Physics Letters'' '''A 374''' pp. 4801 (2010). DOI: 10.1016/j.physleta.2010.10.005&lt;/ref&gt; when restricted to the pure states alone.

==Definition==
The [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] may be defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
[d(\rho, \rho+d\rho)]^2 = \frac{1}{2}\mbox{tr}( d \rho G ),
&lt;/math&gt;{{clarify| date=July 2016 | reason= The definition of ''d'' is not clear}}
where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is Hermitian 1-form operator implicitly given by
:&lt;math&gt;
 \rho G + G \rho = d \rho,
&lt;/math&gt;
which is a special case of a [[Lyapunov equation|continuous Lyapunov equation]].

Some of the applications of the Bures metric include that given a target error, it allows the calculation of the minimum number of measurements to distinguish two different states&lt;ref&gt;S.L. Braunstein, C.M. Caves "[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.72.3439 Statistical distance and the geometry of quantum states]", ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'' '''72''', 3439, (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of the volume element as  a candidate for the [[Jeffreys prior]]  probability density&lt;ref&gt; P.B. Slater, ''Applications of quantum and classical Fisher information to two-level complex and quaternionic and three-level complex systems '', J. Math. Phys. 37, 2682, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; for mixed quantum states.

==Bures distance==
The Bures distance is the finite version of the infinitesimal square distance described above and is given
by 
:&lt;math&gt;
D_B(\rho_1,\rho_2)^2 = 2(1-\sqrt{F(\rho_1,\rho_2)}), 
&lt;/math&gt;
where the [[Fidelity of quantum states|fidelity function]] is defined 
as&lt;ref&gt; Unfortunately, some authors use a different definition, &lt;math&gt;
F(\rho_1,\rho_2) = \mbox{tr}( \sqrt{ \sqrt{\rho_1}\rho_2\sqrt{\rho_1}}) &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
F(\rho_1,\rho_2) = \left[ \mbox{tr}( \sqrt{ \sqrt{\rho_1}\rho_2\sqrt{\rho_1}})\right]^2.
&lt;/math&gt;
Another associated function is the Bures arc also known as Bures angle,  Bures length or [[quantum angle]], defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
D_A(\rho_1,\rho_2) = \arccos \sqrt{F(\rho_1,\rho_2)},
&lt;/math&gt;
which is a measure of the '''statistical distance'''&lt;ref&gt;W.K. Wootters , [http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.23.357 ''Statistical distance and Hilbert space''], Phys. Rev. D, '''23''', 357 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;
between quantum states.

==Quantum Fisher information==
The Bures metric can be seen as the quantum equivalent of the Fisher information metric and can be rewritten in terms of the variation of coordinate parameters as 
:&lt;math&gt;
[d(\rho, \rho+d\rho)]^2 = \frac{1}{2}
  \mbox{tr}\left( \frac{d \rho}{d \theta^{\mu}} L_{\nu} \right) d \theta^{\mu} d\theta^{\nu},
&lt;/math&gt;
which holds as long as &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho+d\rho&lt;/math&gt; have the same rank. In cases where they do not have the same rank, there is an additional term on the right hand side.&lt;ref&gt;D. Šafránek "[https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.95.052320 Discontinuities of the quantum Fisher information and the Bures metric]", ''Phys. Rev. A'' '''95''', 052320 (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;math&gt;L_\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the Symmetric Logarithmic Derivative operator (SLD) defined from&lt;ref&gt;M. G. A. Paris "[https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219749909004839 Quantum estimation for quantum technology]", ''International Journal of Quantum Information'' '''07''', 125 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\rho L_{\mu} + L_{\mu} \rho}{2} = \frac{d \rho^{\,}}{d \theta^{\mu}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

In this way, one has
:&lt;math&gt;
[d(\rho, \rho+d\rho)]^2 = 
\frac{1}{2} \mbox{tr}\left[ \rho \frac{L_{\mu} L_{\nu} + L_{\nu} L_{\mu}}{2}  \right] d \theta^{\mu} d\theta^{\nu},
&lt;/math&gt;
where the quantum Fisher metric (tensor components) is identified as
:&lt;math&gt;
J_{\mu \nu} = \mbox{tr}\left[ \rho \frac{L_{\mu} L_{\nu} + L_{\nu} L_{\mu}}{2}\right].
&lt;/math&gt;

The definition of the SLD implies that the quantum Fisher metric is 4 times the Bures metric. In other words, given that &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; are components of the Bures metric tensor, one has
:&lt;math&gt;
J_{\mu\nu}^{ } = 4 g_{\mu \nu}.
&lt;/math&gt;

As it happens with the classical Fisher information metric, the quantum Fisher metric can be used to find the [[Cramér–Rao bound]] of the [[covariance]].

==Explicit formulas==
The actual computation of the Bures metric is not evident from the definition, so, some formulas were developed for that purpose. For 2x2 and 3x3 systems, respectively, the quadratic form of the Bures metric is calculated as&lt;ref&gt;J. Dittmann, "[http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0305-4470/32/14/007/meta Explicit formulae for the Bures metric]", ''Journal of Physics A'' '''32''', 14 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
[d(\rho, \rho+d\rho)]^2 =
 \frac{1}{4}\mbox{tr}\left[ d \rho d \rho + \frac{1}{\det(\rho)}(\mathbf{1}-\rho)d\rho (\mathbf{1}-\rho)d\rho \right],
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
[d(\rho, \rho+d\rho)]^2 =
 \frac{1}{4}\mbox{tr}\left[ d \rho d \rho + \frac{3}{1-\mbox{tr} \rho^3} (\mathbf{1}-\rho)d\rho (\mathbf{1}-\rho)d\rho 
+  \frac{3 \det{\rho} }{1-\mbox{tr} \rho^3} (\mathbf{1}-\rho^{-1})d\rho (\mathbf{1}-\rho^{-1})d\rho 
\right].
&lt;/math&gt;

For general systems, the Bures metric can be written in terms of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the density matrix &lt;math&gt;\rho=\sum_{j=1}^n\lambda_j|j\rangle\langle j|&lt;/math&gt; as&lt;ref&gt;M. Hübner "[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037596019291004B Explicit computation of the Bures distance for density matrices]", ''Phys. Lett. A'' '''163''', 239 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; M. Hübner, '' Computation of Uhlmann's parallel transport for density matrices and the Bures metric on three-dimensional Hilbert space'', Phys. Lett. A, '''179''', 4-5, (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
[d(\rho, \rho+d\rho)]^2 = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j,k=1}^{n} \frac{|\langle j| d\rho | k\rangle  |^2}{\lambda_j+\lambda_k},
&lt;/math&gt;
as an integral,&lt;ref&gt;M. G. A. Paris "[https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219749909004839 Quantum estimation for quantum technology]", ''International Journal of Quantum Information'' '''07''', 125 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
[d(\rho, \rho+d\rho)]^2 = \frac{1}{2}\int_0^\infty\text{tr}[e^{-\rho t}d\rho e^{-\rho t}d\rho]\ dt,
&lt;/math&gt;

==Two-level system==
The state of a two-level system can be parametrized with three variables as 
:&lt;math&gt;
\rho = \frac{1}{2}(  I + \boldsymbol{r\cdot\sigma} ),
&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt; r^2\stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \boldsymbol{r\cdot r} \le 1 &lt;/math&gt;. 
The components of the Bures metric in this parametrization can be calculated as
:&lt;math&gt;
 \mathsf{g} = \frac{\mathsf{I}}{4}+\frac{\boldsymbol{r\otimes r}}{4(1-r^2)}
&lt;/math&gt;.
The Bures measure can be calculated by taking the square root of the determinant to find
:&lt;math&gt;
dV_B = \frac{d^3\boldsymbol{r}}{8\sqrt{ 1 - r^2}},
&lt;/math&gt;

which can be used to calculate the Bures volume as
:&lt;math&gt;
V_B = \iiint_{r^2\leq 1}\frac{d^3\boldsymbol{r}}{8\sqrt{1-r^2}}
 = \frac{\pi^2}{8} .
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1688">[[Image:Horloĝo 001.svg|thumb|The twelve clock positions]]

A '''clock position''' is the [[relative direction]] of an object described using the analogy of a [[12-hour clock]] to describe angles and directions. One imagines a [[clock face]] lying either upright or flat in front of oneself, and identifies the twelve [[hour]] markings with the directions in which they point.

Using this analogy, ''12 o'clock'' means ''ahead or above'', ''3 o'clock'' means ''to the right'', ''6 o'clock'' means ''behind or below'', and ''9 o'clock'' means ''to the left''. The other eight hours refer to directions that are not directly in line with the four cardinal directions.

In [[aviation]], a clock position refers to a horizontal direction; it may be supplemented with the word ''high'' or ''low'' to describe the vertical direction which is pointed towards your feet. ''6 o'clock high'' means ''behind and above the [[horizon]]'', while ''12 o'clock low'' means ''ahead and below the horizon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Liz |last=Mariner |date=2007 |title=Cleared for Takeoff: English for Pilots, Book 1 |publisher=AE Link Publications |isbn=978-0-9795068-0-2 |pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media and culture==
The 1949 movie ''[[Twelve O'Clock High]]'' takes its title from the system. In this case, the position would be ''ahead and above the horizon''.

The phrase "on your six" refers to the system, six referring to the six o'clock or following position.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2941">In [[mathematics]], a [[topological space]] (''X'', ''T'') is called '''completely uniformizable'''&lt;ref&gt;e. g. Willard&lt;/ref&gt; (or '''Dieudonné complete'''&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Mathematics&lt;/ref&gt;) if there exists at least one [[uniform space|complete uniformity]] that induces the topology ''T''. Some authors&lt;ref&gt;e. g. Arkhangel'skii (in Encyclopedia of Mathematics), who uses the term ''Dieudonné complete''&lt;/ref&gt; additionally require ''X'' to be [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]. Some authors have called these spaces '''topologically complete''',&lt;ref&gt;Kelley&lt;/ref&gt; although that term has also been used in other meanings like ''[[completely metrizable]]'', which is a stronger property than ''completely uniformizable''.

==Properties==
* Every completely uniformizable space is [[uniformizable]], and thus [[completely regular]].
* A completely regular space ''X'' is completely uniformizable if and only if the [[fine uniformity]] on ''X'' is complete. &lt;ref&gt;Willard, p. 265, Ex. 39B&lt;/ref&gt;
* Every [[regular space|regular]] [[paracompact]] space (in particular, every Hausdorff paracompact space) is completely uniformizable. &lt;ref&gt;Kelley, p. 208, Problem 6.L(d). Note that Kelley uses the word ''paracompact'' for regular paracompact spaces (see the definition on p. 156). As mentioned in the footnote on page 156, this includes Hausdorff paracompact spaces.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note that the assumption of the space being regular or Hausdorff cannot be dropped, since every uniform space is regular and it is easy to construct finite (hence paracompact) spaces which are not regular.&lt;/ref&gt;
* (Shirota's theorem) A completely regular Hausdorff space is [[realcompact]] if and only if it is completely uniformizable and contains no closed discrete subspace of [[measurable cardinal]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;Beckenstein et al., page 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Every [[metrizable space]] is paracompact, hence completely uniformizable. As there exist metrizable spaces that are not [[completely metrizable]], complete uniformizability is a strictly weaker condition than complete metrizability.

'''Contact dynamics''' deals with the motion of [[multibody system]]s subjected to [[unilateral contact]]s and [[friction]]. Such systems are omnipresent in many multibody dynamics applications. Consider for example
* Contacts between wheels and ground in [[vehicle dynamics]]
* Squealing of brakes due to friction induced oscillations
* Motion of many particles, spheres which fall in a funnel, mixing processes (granular media)
* [[Clockwork]]s
* Walking machines
* Arbitrary machines with limit stops, friction.
In the following it is discussed how such mechanical systems with unilateral contacts and friction can be modeled and how the time evolution of such systems can be obtained by [[Numerical ordinary differential equations|numerical integration]]. In addition, some examples are given.

==Modeling==
The two main approaches for modeling mechanical systems with unilateral contacts and friction are the regularized and the non-smooth approach. In the following, the two approaches are introduced using a simple example. Consider a block which can slide or stick on a table (see figure 1a). The motion of the block is described by the equation of motion, whereas the friction force is unknown (see figure 1b). In order to obtain the friction force, a separate force law must be specified which links the friction force to the associated velocity of the block. 

[[Image:contact dynamics block.jpg|frame|center|Figure 1: Block which can slide or stick on a table. Figure a) depicts the model, figure b) the equation of motion with unknown friction force]]

===Non-smooth approach===

A more sophisticated approach is the non-smooth approach, which uses set-valued force laws to model mechanical systems with unilateral contacts and friction. Consider again the block which slides or sticks on the table. The associated set-valued friction law of type Sgn is depicted in figure 3. Regarding the sliding case, the friction force is given. Regarding the sticking case, the friction force is set-valued and determined according to an additional algebraic [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]. 

[[Image:contact dynamics setvalued.jpg|frame|center|Figure 3: Set-valued force law for friction]]

To conclude, the non-smooth approach changes the underlying mathematical structure if required and leads to a proper description of mechanical systems with unilateral contacts and friction. As a consequence of the changing mathematical structure, [[Impact force|impacts]] can occur, and the time evolutions of the positions and the velocities can not be assumed to be [[Smooth function|smooth]] anymore. As a consequence, additional impact equations and impact laws have to be defined. In order to handle the changing mathematical structure, the set-valued force laws are commonly written as [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] or [[Inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]] problems. The evaluation of these inequalities/inclusions is commonly done by solving linear (or nonlinear) [[Linear complementarity problem|complementarity problems]], by [[quadratic programming]] or by transforming the inequality/inclusion problems into projective equations which can be solved iteratively by [[Jacobi method|Jacobi]] or [[Gauss–Seidel method|Gauss–Seidel]] techniques.
The non-smooth approach provides a new modeling approach for mechanical systems with unilateral contacts and friction, which incorporates also the whole classical mechanics subjected to bilateral constraints. The approach is associated to the classical [[Differential algebraic equation|DAE]] theory and leads to robust integration schemes.

==Numerical integration==

The integration of regularized models can be done by standard stiff solvers for ordinary differential equations. However, oscillations induced by the regularization can occur. Considering non-smooth models of mechanical systems with unilateral contacts and friction, two main classes of integrators exist, the event-driven and the so-called time-stepping integrators.
 
===Event-driven integrators===

Event-driven integrators distinguish between smooth parts of the motion in which the underlying structure of the differential equations does not change, and in events or so-called switching points at which this structure changes, i.e. time instants at which a unilateral contact closes or a stick slip transition occurs. At these switching points, the set-valued force (and additional impact) laws are evaluated in order to obtain a new underlying mathematical structure on which the integration can be continued.  Event-driven integrators are very accurate but are not suitable for systems with many contacts.

===Time-stepping integrators===

So-called time-stepping integrators are dedicated numerical schemes for mechanical systems with many contacts. The first time-stepping integrator was introduced by J.J. Moreau. The integrators do not aim at resolving switching points and are therefore very robust in application. As the integrators do work with the integral of the contact forces and not with the forces itself, the methods can handle both non-impulsive motion and impulsive events like impacts. As a drawback, the accuracy of time-stepping integrators is low. This lack can be fixed by using a step-size refinement at switching points. Smooth parts of the motion are processed by larger step sizes, and higher order integration methods can be used to increase the integration order.

==Examples==

This section gives some examples of mechanical systems with unilateral contacts and friction. The results have been obtained by a non-smooth approach using time-stepping integrators.

===Granular materials===
Time-stepping methods are especially well suited for the simulation of granular materials. Figure 4 depicts the simulation of mixing 1000 disks. 

[[Image:contact dynamics mixer.jpg|frame|center|Figure 4: Mixing a thousand disks]]

===Billiard===
Consider two colliding spheres in a billiard play. Figure 5a shows some snapshots of two colliding spheres, figure 5b depicts the associated trajectories.

[[Image:contact dynamics billiard.jpg|frame|center|Figure 5: a) Snapshot. b) Trajectories of the two spheres]]

===Wheely of a motorbike===
If a motorbike is accelerated too fast, it does a wheelie. Figure 6 shows some snapshots of a simulation.

[[Image:contact dynamics motorbike.jpg|frame|center|Figure 6: Wheely of a motorbike]]

===Motion of the woodpecker toy===

The woodpecker toy is a well known benchmark problem in contact dynamics. The toy consists of a pole, a sleeve with a hole that is slightly larger than the diameter of the pole, a spring and the woodpecker body. In operation, the woodpecker moves down the pole performing some kind of pitching motion, which is controlled by the sleeve. Figure 7 shows some snapshots of a simulation.

It is also sometimes assumed that ''W''&lt;sub&gt;α+1&lt;/sub&gt;⊆''P''(''W''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;) or that ''W''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is empty.

The union ''W'' of the sets of a cumulative hierarchy is often used as a model of set theory.

The phrase "the cumulative hierarchy" usually refers to the standard cumulative hierarchy ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; of the [[Von Neumann universe]] with ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α+1&lt;/sub&gt;=''P''(''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;) introduced by {{harvtxt|Zermelo|1930}}

==Reflection principle==

A cumulative hierarchy satisfies a form of the [[reflection principle]]: any formula of the language of set theory that holds in the union ''W'' of the hierarchy also holds in some stages ''W''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Examples==

* The [[Von Neumann universe]] is built from a cumulative hierarchy ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;.
*The sets ''L''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; of the [[constructible universe]] form a cumulative hierarchy.
*The [[Boolean-valued model]]s constructed by forcing are built using a cumulative hierarchy.
*The [[well founded set]]s in a model of set theory (possibly not satisfying the axiom of foundation) form a cumulative hierarchy whose union satisfies the axiom of foundation.

In [[mathematics]], a [[differential field]] ''K'' is '''differentially closed''' if every finite system of [[differential equation]]s with a solution in some differential field extending ''K'' already has a solution in ''K''. This concept was introduced by {{harvtxt|Robinson|1959}}. Differentially closed fields are the analogues
for differential equations of algebraically closed fields for polynomial equations.

== The theory of differentially closed fields==

We recall that a [[differential field]] is a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] equipped with a [[Derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]] operator. Let ''K'' be a differential field with derivation operator ∂.

*A '''differential polynomial''' in ''x'' is a polynomial in the formal expressions ''x'', ∂''x'', ∂&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''x'', ... with coefficients in ''K''.
*The '''order''' of a non-zero differential polynomial in ''x'' is the largest ''n'' such that ∂&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''x'' occurs in it, or &amp;minus;1 if the differential polynomial is a constant.
*The '''separant''' ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; of a differential polynomial of order ''n''≥0 is the derivative of ''f'' with respect to ∂&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''x''.
*The '''field of constants''' of ''K'' is the subfield of elements ''a'' with ∂''a''=0.
*In a differential field ''K'' of nonzero [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] ''p'', all ''p''th powers are constants. It follows that neither ''K'' nor its field of constants is [[Perfect field|perfect]], unless ∂ is trivial. A field ''K'' with derivation ∂ is called '''differentially perfect''' if it is either of characteristic 0, or of characteristic ''p'' and every constant is a ''p''th power of an element of ''K''.
*A '''differentially closed field''' is a differentially perfect differential field ''K''  such that if ''f'' and ''g'' are  differential polynomials such that  ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;≠ 0 and ''g''≠0 and  ''f'' has order greater than that of ''g'', then there is some ''x'' in ''K'' with ''f''(''x'')=0 and ''g''(''x'')≠0. (Some authors add the condition that  ''K'' has characteristic 0, in which case ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; is automatically non-zero, and ''K'' is automatically perfect.)
*'''DCF&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the theory of differentially closed fields of characteristic ''p'' (where ''p'' is 0 or a prime).

Taking ''g''=1 and ''f'' any ordinary [[separable polynomial]] shows that any differentially closed field is [[separably closed]]. In characteristic 0 this implies that it is algebraically closed, but in characteristic ''p''&gt;0 differentially closed fields are never algebraically closed.

Unlike the complex numbers in the theory of algebraically closed fields, there is no  natural example of a differentially closed field.
Any differentially perfect field ''K'' has a '''differential closure''', a  [[prime model]] extension, which is differentially closed. Shelah showed that the differential closure is unique up to isomorphism over ''K''. Shelah also showed that the prime differentially closed field of characteristic 0 (the differential closure of the rationals) is not [[minimal model (set theory)|minimal]]; this was a rather surprising result, as it is not what one would expect by analogy with algebraically closed fields.

The theory of  DCF&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[complete theory|complete]] and [[model complete]] (for ''p''=0 this was shown by Robinson, and for ''p''&gt;0 by {{harvtxt|Wood|1973}}).
The theory DCF&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[model companion]] of the theory of differential fields of characteristic ''p''. It is  the model completion of the theory of differentially perfect fields of characteristic ''p'' if one adds to the language a symbol giving the ''p''th root of constants when ''p''&gt;0. The theory of differential fields of characteristic ''p''&gt;0 does not have a model completion, and in characteristic ''p''=0 is the same as the theory of differentially perfect fields so has DCF&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as its model completion.

The number of differentially closed fields of some infinite cardinality κ is 2&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt;; for κ uncountable this was proved by {{harvtxt|Shelah|1973}}, and for κ countable by Hrushovski and Sokolovic.

== The Kolchin topology ==

The ''Kolchin topology'' on ''K'' &lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; is defined by taking sets of solutions of systems of differential equations over ''K'' in ''m'' variables as basic closed sets.  Like the [[Zariski topology]], the Kolchin topology is [[Noetherian topological space|Noetherian]].

A d-constructible set is a finite union of closed and open sets in the Kolchin topology. Equivalently, a d-constructible set is the set of solutions to a quantifier-free, or [[atomic formula|atomic]], formula with parameters in ''K''.

== Quantifier elimination ==

Like the theory of algebraically closed fields, the theory DCF&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of differentially closed fields of characteristic 0 [[quantifier elimination|eliminates quantifiers]].  The geometric content of this statement is that the projection of a d-constructible set is d-constructible. It also eliminates imaginaries, is complete, and model complete.

In characteristic ''p''&gt;0, the theory DCF&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; eliminates quantifiers in the language of differential fields with a unary function ''r'' added that is the ''p''th root of all constants, and is 0 on elements that are not constant.

== Differential Nullstellensatz ==
The differential Nullstellensatz is the analogue in differential algebra of Hilbert's [[nullstellensatz]].

*A '''differential ideal''' or ∂-ideal is an ideal closed under ∂.
*An ideal is called '''radical''' if it contains all roots of its elements.

Suppose that ''K'' is a differentially closed field of characteristic 0. &lt;!-- I'm not sure whether characteristic 0 is necessary--&gt;. Then Seidenberg's '''differential nullstellensatz''' states  there is a bijection between
*Radical differential ideals in the ring of differential polynomials in ''n'' variables, and
*∂-closed subsets of ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.
This correspondence maps a ∂-closed subset to the ideal of elements vanishing on it, and maps an ideal to its set of zeros.

== Omega stability ==
In characteristic 0 {{harvtxt|Blum}} showed that the theory of differentially closed fields is [[&amp;omega;-stable]] and  has [[Morley rank]] ω.
In non-zero characteristic {{harvtxt|Wood|1973}} showed that the theory of differentially closed fields is not ω-stable, and {{harvtxt|Shelah|1973}} showed more precisely that it is [[stable theory|stable]] but not [[superstable]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2699">In differential geometry, an '''equivariant differential form''' on a manifold ''M'' [[Lie group action|acted]] by a [[Lie group]] ''G'' is a [[polynomial map]]
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha: \mathfrak{g} \to \Omega^*(M)&lt;/math&gt;
from the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g} = \operatorname{Lie}(G)&lt;/math&gt; to the space of [[Differential form|differential forms]] on ''M'' that are equivariant; i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha(\operatorname{Ad}(g)X) = g\alpha(X).&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, an equivariant differential form is an invariant element of
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}] \otimes \Omega^*(M) = \operatorname{Sym}(\mathfrak{g}^*) \otimes \Omega^*(M).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proof: with &lt;math&gt;V = \Omega^*(M)&lt;/math&gt;, we have: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mor}_G(\mathfrak{g}, V) = \operatorname{Mor}(\mathfrak{g}, V)^G = (\operatorname{Mor}(\mathfrak{g}, \mathbb{C})\otimes V)^G.&lt;/math&gt; Note &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{g}]&lt;/math&gt; is the ring of polynomials in linear functionals of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;; see [[ring of polynomial functions]]. See also http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/101453/equivariant-differential-forms for M. Emerton's comment.&lt;/ref&gt;

For an equivariant differential form &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the '''equivariant exterior derivative''' &lt;math&gt;d_\mathfrak{g} \alpha&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;(d_\mathfrak{g} \alpha)(X) = d(\alpha(X)) - i_{X^\#}(\alpha(X))&lt;/math&gt;
where ''d'' is the usual exterior derivative and &lt;math&gt;i_{X^\#}&lt;/math&gt; is the interior product by the [[fundamental vector field]] generated by ''X''.
It is easy to see &lt;math&gt;d_\mathfrak{g} \circ d_\mathfrak{g} = 0&lt;/math&gt; (use the fact the Lie derivative of &lt;math&gt;\alpha(X)&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;X^\#&lt;/math&gt; is zero) and one then puts
:&lt;math&gt;H^*_G(X) = \operatorname{ker} d_\mathfrak{g}/\operatorname{im} d_\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;,
which is called the [[equivariant cohomology]] of ''M'' (which coincides with the ordinary equivariant cohomology defined in terms of [[Borel construction]].) The definition is due to H. Cartan. The notion has an application to the [[equivariant index theory]].

&lt;math&gt;d_\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;-closed or &lt;math&gt;d_\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;-exact forms are called '''equivariantly closed''' or '''equivariantly exact'''.

The integral of an equivariantly closed form may be evaluated from its restriction to the fixed point by means of the [[Localization formula for equivariant cohomology|localization formula]].

'''Erable''' is a [[computer algebra system]] (CAS) for a family of Hewlett-Packard graphing scientific calculators of the [[HP 40 series|HP&amp;nbsp;40]], [[HP 48 series|48]] and [[HP 49/50 series]].

==History==
Originally named ''ALGB'' in 1993, it was developed by the French mathematician [[Bernard Parisse]] for the [[HP&amp;nbsp;48SX]]. Over time, the system integrated a lot of functionality from another math pack for the HP&amp;nbsp;48 series, [[ALG48]] by [[Mika Heiskanen]] and [[Claude-Nicolas Fiechter]]. At some point, ''ALGB'' was renamed into ''Erable'', a French play-on-words on another CAS named [[Maple (software)|Maple]]. Compatible with the [[HP&amp;nbsp;48S]], [[HP 48SX|48SX]], [[HP 48G|48G]], [[HP 48G+|48G+]], [[HP 48GX|48GX]], Erable became one of the "must-have" software packages to be installed by advanced users of these calculators.

When [[Hewlett-Packard]] developed the [[HP&amp;nbsp;49G]] in 1999, the Erable and ALG48 packages became an integral part of the calculator's firmware, now just named ''HP49 CAS''.

As HP CAS it also showed up in the [[HP&amp;nbsp;40G]], [[HP 40gs|40gs]], [[HP 49g+|49g+]], [[HP 48gII|48gII]] and [[HP 50g|50g]] and was maintained by Parisse up to 2006.

Based on his experiences with Erable, Parisse started developing a new and more general CAS system named [[Xcas]] / [[Giac (software)|Giac]] in 2000. It is written in [[C++]] rather than [[System RPL]]. This system was integrated into the [[HP Prime]] in 2013 under a dual-license scheme.

==Versions==
The last stable stand-alone version of Erable for the [[HP&amp;nbsp;48 series]] is 3.024 (1998-08-06),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hpcalc.org/details.php?id=1349&lt;/ref&gt; with source code as of 1998-07-14 available under the [[GNU GPL]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hpcalc.org/details.php?id=1350&lt;/ref&gt; The latest beta versions for these calculators are 3.117 (1998-10-17)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hpcalc.org/details.php?id=1355&lt;/ref&gt; and 3.201 (1999-02-07).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hpcalc.org/details.php?id=1354&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts of the CAS system for the [[HP&amp;nbsp;49/50 series]] (version 4) were released as open-source under the [[LGPL]] (since some parts of the CAS, which are copyrighted by Hewlett-Packard, remain proprietary software) and were maintained by Parisse up to 2006-02-02 (for firmware 2.14),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hpcalc.org/details.php?id=5997&lt;/ref&gt; and 2006-09-19 (for firmware 2.15 (2009-04-21)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hpcalc.org/details.php?id=7097&lt;/ref&gt; and 2.16 (2012-04-26)).

The '''fractal transform''' is a technique invented by [[Michael Barnsley]] ''et al.'' to perform [[lossy data compression|lossy]] [[image compression]].
This first practical [[fractal compression]] system for digital images resembles a [[vector quantization]] system using the image itself as the codebook.

== Fractal transform compression ==

Start with a digital [[image]] A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
Downsample it by a factor of 2 to produce image A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
Now, for each block B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of 4x4 pixels in A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, find the corresponding block B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; most similar to B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and then find the [[grayscale]] or [[RGB color space|RGB]] offset and gain from A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
For each destination block, output the positions of the source blocks and the color offsets and gains.

== Fractal transform decompression ==
Starting with an empty destination image A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, repeat the following algorithm several times:
Downsample A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; down by a factor of 2 to produce image A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then copy blocks from A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; as directed by the compressed data, multiplying by the respective gains and adding the respective color offsets.

This algorithm is guaranteed to converge to an image, and it should appear similar to the original image.
In fact, a slight modification of the decompressor to run at block sizes larger than 4x4 pixels produces a method of stretching images without causing the blockiness or blurriness of traditional [[linear]] [[Resampling (bitmap)|resampling]] [[algorithm]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7766">'''Free convolution''' is the [[free probability]] analog of the classical notion of [[convolution]] of probability measures. Due to the non-commutative nature of free probability theory, one has to talk separately about additive and multiplicative free convolution, which arise from addition and multiplication of free random variables (see below; in the classical case, what would be the analog of free multiplicative convolution can be reduced to additive convolution by passing to logarithms of random variables). These operations have some interpretations in terms of [[empirical spectral measures]] of [[random matrices]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, G.W.; Guionnet, A.; Zeitouni, O. (2010). An introduction to random matrices. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{isbn|978-0-521-19452-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of free convolution was introduced by Voiculescu.&lt;ref&gt;Voiculescu, D., Addition of certain non-commuting random variables, J. Funct. Anal. 66 (1986), 323–346&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Voiculescu, D., Multiplication of certain noncommuting random variables, J. Operator Theory 18 (1987), 2223–2235&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free additive convolution ==

Let &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; be two probability measures on the real line, and assume that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a random variable in a non commutative probability space with law &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is a random variable in the same non commutative probability space with law &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;.  Assume finally that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are [[free independence|freely independent]].  Then the '''free additive convolution''' &lt;math&gt;\mu\boxplus\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the law of &lt;math&gt;X+Y&lt;/math&gt;. [[Random matrices]] interpretation: if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are some independent &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; Hermitian (resp. real symmetric) random matrices such that at least one of them is invariant, in law, under conjugation by any unitary (resp. orthogonal) matrix and such that the [[empirical spectral measures]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; tend respectively to &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; tends to infinity, then the empirical spectral measure of &lt;math&gt;A+B&lt;/math&gt; tends to &lt;math&gt;\mu\boxplus\nu&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, G.W.; Guionnet, A.; Zeitouni, O. (2010). An introduction to random matrices. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{isbn|978-0-521-19452-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, it is possible to compute the probability measure &lt;math&gt;\mu\boxplus\nu&lt;/math&gt; explicitly by using complex-analytic techniques and the R-transform of the measures &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;.

== Rectangular free additive convolution ==

The rectangular free additive convolution (with ratio &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\boxplus_c&lt;/math&gt; has also been defined in the non commutative probability framework by Benaych-Georges&lt;ref&gt;Benaych-Georges, F., Rectangular random matrices, related convolution, Probab. Theory Related Fields Vol. 144, no. 3 (2009) 471-515.&lt;/ref&gt; and admits the following [[random matrices]] interpretation. For &lt;math&gt;c\in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, for  &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are some independent &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; complex (resp. real) random matrices such that at least one of them is invariant, in law, under multiplication on the left and on the right by any unitary (resp. orthogonal) matrix and such that the [[empirical singular values distribution]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; tend respectively to &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; tend to infinity in such a way that &lt;math&gt;n/p&lt;/math&gt; tends to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, then the [[empirical singular values distribution]] of &lt;math&gt;A+B&lt;/math&gt; tends to &lt;math&gt;\mu\boxplus_c\nu&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Benaych-Georges, F., Rectangular random matrices, related convolution, Probab. Theory Related Fields Vol. 144, no. 3 (2009) 471-515.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, it is possible to compute the probability measure &lt;math&gt;\mu\boxplus_c\nu&lt;/math&gt; explicitly by using complex-analytic techniques and the rectangular R-transform with ratio &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; of the measures &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;.

== Free multiplicative convolution ==

Let &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; be two probability measures on the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,+\infty)&lt;/math&gt;, and assume that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a random variable in a non commutative probability space with law &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is a random variable in the same non commutative probability space with law &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;.  Assume finally that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are [[free independence|freely independent]].  Then the '''free multiplicative convolution''' &lt;math&gt;\mu\boxtimes\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the law of &lt;math&gt;X^{1/2}YX^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; (or, equivalently, the law of &lt;math&gt;Y^{1/2}XY^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;.  [[Random matrices]] interpretation: if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are some independent &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; non negative Hermitian (resp. real symmetric) random matrices such that at least one of them is invariant, in law, under conjugation by any unitary (resp. orthogonal) matrix and such that the [[empirical spectral measures]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; tend respectively to &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; tends to infinity, then the empirical spectral measure of &lt;math&gt;AB&lt;/math&gt; tends to &lt;math&gt;\mu\boxtimes\nu&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, G.W.; Guionnet, A.; Zeitouni, O. (2010). An introduction to random matrices. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{isbn|978-0-521-19452-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar definition can be made in the case of laws &lt;math&gt;\mu,\nu&lt;/math&gt; supported on the unit circle &lt;math&gt;\{z:|z|=1\}&lt;/math&gt;, with an orthogonal or unitary [[random matrices]] interpretation.

Explicit computations of multiplicative free convolution can be carried out using complex-analytic techniques and the S-transform.

== Applications of free convolution ==

* Free convolution can be used to give a proof of the free central limit theorem.
* Free convolution can be used to compute the laws and spectra of sums or products of random variables which are free.  Such examples include: [[random walk]] operators on free groups (Kesten measures); and asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues of sums or products of independent [[random matrix|random matrices]].

Through its applications to random matrices, free convolution has some strong connections with other works on G-estimation of Girko.

The applications in [[wireless communication]]s, [[finance]] and [[biology]] have provided a useful framework  when the number of observations is of the same order as the dimensions  of the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11376">In [[logic]], '''general frames''' (or simply '''frames''') are [[Kripke frame]]s with an additional structure, which are used to model [[modal logic|modal]] and [[intermediate logic|intermediate]] logics. The general frame semantics combines the main virtues of [[Kripke semantics]] and [[algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]]: it shares the transparent geometrical insight of the former, and robust completeness of the latter.

==Definition==
A '''modal general frame''' is a triple &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F=\langle F,R,V\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\langle F,R\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a Kripke frame (i.e., ''R'' is a [[binary relation]] on the set ''F''), and ''V'' is a set of subsets of ''F'' which is closed under the following:
*the Boolean operations of (binary) [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]], [[union (set theory)|union]], and [[complement (set theory)|complement]],
*the operation &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;, defined by &lt;math&gt;\Box A=\{x\in F;\,\forall y\in F\,(x\,R\,y\to y\in A)\}&lt;/math&gt;.
They are thus a special case of [[field of sets#Fields of sets with additional structure|fields of sets with additional structure]]. The purpose of ''V'' is to restrict the allowed valuations in the frame: a model &lt;math&gt;\langle F,R,\Vdash\rangle&lt;/math&gt; based on the Kripke frame &lt;math&gt;\langle F,R\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is '''admissible''' in the general frame '''F''', if
:&lt;math&gt;\{x\in F;\,x\Vdash p\}\in V&lt;/math&gt; for every [[propositional variable]] ''p''.
The closure conditions on ''V'' then ensure that &lt;math&gt;\{x\in F;\,x\Vdash A\}&lt;/math&gt; belongs to ''V'' for ''every'' formula ''A'' (not only a variable).

A formula ''A'' is '''valid''' in '''F''', if &lt;math&gt;x\Vdash A&lt;/math&gt; for all admissible valuations &lt;math&gt;\Vdash&lt;/math&gt;, and all points &lt;math&gt;x\in F&lt;/math&gt;. A [[normal modal logic]] ''L'' is valid in the frame '''F''', if all axioms (or equivalently, all theorems) of ''L'' are valid in '''F'''. In this case we call '''F''' an ''L''-'''frame'''.

A Kripke frame &lt;math&gt;\langle F,R\rangle&lt;/math&gt; may be identified with a general frame in which all valuations are admissible: i.e., &lt;math&gt;\langle F,R,\mathcal{P}(F)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal P(F)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[power set]] of ''F''.

==Types of frames==
In full generality, general frames are hardly more than a fancy name for Kripke ''models''; in particular, the correspondence of modal axioms to properties on the accessibility relation is lost. This can be remedied by imposing additional conditions on the set of admissible valuations.

A frame &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F=\langle F,R,V\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is called
*'''differentiated''', if &lt;math&gt;\forall A\in V\,(x\in A\Leftrightarrow y\in A)&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x=y&lt;/math&gt;,
*'''tight''', if &lt;math&gt;\forall A\in V\,(x\in\Box A\Rightarrow y\in A)&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x\,R\,y&lt;/math&gt;,
*'''compact''', if every subset of ''V'' with the [[finite intersection property]] has a non-empty intersection,
*'''atomic''', if ''V'' contains all singletons,
*'''refined''', if it is differentiated and tight,
*'''descriptive''', if it is refined and compact.
Kripke frames are refined and atomic. However, infinite Kripke frames are never compact. Every finite differentiated or atomic frame is a Kripke frame.

Descriptive frames are the most important class of frames because of the duality theory (see below). Refined frames are useful as a common generalization of descriptive and Kripke frames.

==Operations and morphisms on frames==
Every Kripke model &lt;math&gt;\langle F,R,{\Vdash}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; '''induces''' the general frame &lt;math&gt;\langle F,R,V\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where ''V'' is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;V=\big\{\{x\in F;\,x\Vdash A\};\,A\hbox{ is a formula}\big\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The fundamental truth-preserving operations of generated subframes, p-morphic images, and disjoint unions of Kripke frames have analogues on general frames. A frame &lt;math&gt;\mathbf G=\langle G,S,W\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a '''generated subframe''' of a frame &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F=\langle F,R,V\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, if the Kripke frame &lt;math&gt;\langle G,S\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a generated subframe of the Kripke frame &lt;math&gt;\langle F,R\rangle&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., ''G'' is a subset of ''F'' closed upwards under ''R'', and ''S'' is the restriction of ''R'' to ''G''), and
:&lt;math&gt;W=\{A\cap G;\,A\in V\}.&lt;/math&gt;
A '''p-morphism''' (or '''bounded morphism''') &lt;math&gt;f\colon\mathbf F\to\mathbf G&lt;/math&gt; is a function from ''F'' to ''G'' which is a p-morphism of the Kripke frames &lt;math&gt;\langle F,R\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle G,S\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, and satisfies the additional constraint
:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}[A]\in V&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;A\in W&lt;/math&gt;.
The '''disjoint union''' of an indexed set of frames &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F_i=\langle F_i,R_i,V_i\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i\in I&lt;/math&gt;, is the frame &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F=\langle F,R,V\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where ''F'' is the disjoint union of &lt;math&gt;\{F_i;\,i\in I\}&lt;/math&gt;, ''R'' is the union of &lt;math&gt;\{R_i;\,i\in I\}&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt;V=\{A\subseteq F;\,\forall i\in I\,(A\cap F_i\in V_i)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''refinement''' of a frame &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F=\langle F,R,V\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a refined frame &lt;math&gt;\mathbf G=\langle G,S,W\rangle&lt;/math&gt; defined as follows. We consider the [[equivalence relation]]
:&lt;math&gt;x\sim y\iff\forall A\in V\,(x\in A\Leftrightarrow y\in A),&lt;/math&gt;
and let &lt;math&gt;G=F/{\sim}&lt;/math&gt; be the set of equivalence classes of &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt;. Then we put
:&lt;math&gt;\langle x/{\sim},y/{\sim}\rangle\in S\iff\forall A\in V\,(x\in\Box A\Rightarrow y\in A),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A/{\sim}\in W\iff A\in V.&lt;/math&gt;

==Completeness==
Unlike Kripke frames, every normal modal logic ''L'' is complete with respect to a class of general frames. This is a consequence of the fact that ''L'' is complete with respect to a class of Kripke models &lt;math&gt;\langle F,R,{\Vdash}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;: as ''L'' is closed under substitution, the general frame induced by &lt;math&gt;\langle F,R,{\Vdash}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is an ''L''-frame. Moreover, every logic ''L'' is complete with respect to a single ''descriptive'' frame. Indeed, ''L'' is complete with respect to its canonical model, and the general frame induced by the canonical model (called the '''canonical frame''' of ''L'') is descriptive.

==Jónsson–Tarski duality==
[[File:Rieger-Nishimura ladder.svg|thumb|right|100px|The Rieger–Nishimura ladder: a 1-universal intuitionistic Kripke frame.]]
[[File:Rieger-Nishimura.svg|thumb|right|300px|Its dual Heyting algebra, the Rieger–Nishimura lattice. It is the free Heyting algebra over 1 generator.]]
General frames bear close connection to [[modal algebra]]s. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F=\langle F,R,V\rangle&lt;/math&gt; be a general frame. The set ''V'' is closed under Boolean operations, therefore it is a [[subalgebra]] of the power set [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\langle\mathcal P(F),\cap,\cup,-\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. It also carries an additional unary operation, &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;. The combined structure &lt;math&gt;\langle V,\cap,\cup,-,\Box\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a modal algebra, which is called the '''dual algebra''' of '''F''', and denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F^+&lt;/math&gt;.

In the opposite direction, it is possible to construct the '''dual frame''' &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A_+=\langle F,R,V\rangle&lt;/math&gt; to any modal algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A=\langle A,\wedge,\vee,-,\Box\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. The Boolean algebra &lt;math&gt;\langle A,\wedge,\vee,-\rangle&lt;/math&gt; has a [[Stone space]], whose underlying set ''F'' is the set of all [[ultrafilter]]s of '''A'''. The set ''V'' of admissible valuations in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A_+&lt;/math&gt; consists of the [[clopen set|clopen]] subsets of ''F'', and the accessibility relation ''R'' is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;x\,R\,y\iff\forall a\in A\,(\Box a\in x\Rightarrow a\in y)&lt;/math&gt;
for all ultrafilters ''x'' and ''y''.

A frame and its dual validate the same formulas, hence the general frame semantics and algebraic semantics are in a sense equivalent. The double dual &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf A_+)^+&lt;/math&gt; of any modal algebra is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt; itself. This is not true in general for double duals of frames, as the dual of every algebra is descriptive. In fact, a frame &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F&lt;/math&gt; is descriptive if and only if it is isomorphic to its double dual &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf F^+)_+&lt;/math&gt;.

It is also possible to define duals of p-morphisms on one hand, and modal algebra homomorphisms on the other hand. In this way the operators &lt;math&gt;(\cdot)^+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\cdot)_+&lt;/math&gt; become a pair of [[contravariant functor]]s between the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of general frames, and the category of modal algebras. These functors provide a [[equivalence of categories|duality]] (called '''Jónsson–Tarski duality''' after [[Bjarni Jónsson]] and [[Alfred Tarski]]) between the categories of descriptive frames, and modal algebras. This is a special case of a more general duality between [[field of sets#Complex algebras and fields of sets on relational structures|complex algebras and fields of sets on relational structures]].

==Intuitionistic frames==
The frame semantics for intuitionistic and intermediate logics can be developed in parallel to the semantics for modal logics. An '''intuitionistic general frame''' is a triple &lt;math&gt;\langle F,\le,V\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; is a [[partial order]] on ''F'', and ''V'' is a set of [[upper set|upper subset]]s (''cones'') of ''F'' which contains the empty set, and is closed under
*intersection and union,
*the operation &lt;math&gt;A\to B=\Box(-A\cup B)&lt;/math&gt;.
Validity and other concepts are then introduced similarly to modal frames, with a few changes necessary to accommodate for the weaker closure properties of the set of admissible valuations. In particular, an intuitionistic frame &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F=\langle F,\le,V\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is called
*'''tight''', if &lt;math&gt;\forall A\in V\,(x\in A\Leftrightarrow y\in A)&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x\le y&lt;/math&gt;,
*'''compact''', if every subset of &lt;math&gt;V\cup\{F-A;\,A\in V\}&lt;/math&gt; with the finite intersection property has a non-empty intersection.
Tight intuitionistic frames are automatically differentiated, hence refined.

The dual of an intuitionistic frame &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F=\langle F,\le,V\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Heyting algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F^+=\langle V,\cap,\cup,\to,\emptyset\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. The dual of a Heyting algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A=\langle A,\wedge,\vee,\to,0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the intuitionistic frame &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A_+=\langle F,\le,V\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where ''F'' is the set of all [[prime filter]]s of '''A''', the ordering &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; is [[inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]], and ''V'' consists of all subsets of ''F'' of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\{x\in F;\,a\in x\},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt;. As in the modal case, &lt;math&gt;(\cdot)^+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\cdot)_+&lt;/math&gt; are a pair of contravariant functors, which make the category of Heyting algebras dually equivalent to the category of descriptive intuitionistic frames.

It is possible to construct intuitionistic general frames from transitive reflexive modal frames and vice versa, see [[modal companion]].

'''Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri''' ({{IPA-it|dʒoˈvanni dʒiˈrɔlamo sakˈkɛri}}; 5 September 1667 – 25 October 1733) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Jesuit]] priest, [[scholastic philosopher]], and [[mathematician]].
{{jesuit}}
Saccheri was born in [[Sanremo]]. He entered the Jesuit order in 1685 and was ordained as a priest in 1694. He taught philosophy at the [[University of Turin]] from 1694 to 1697 and philosophy, theology and mathematics at the [[University of Pavia]] from 1697 until his death. He was a protégé of the mathematician [[Tommaso Ceva]] and published several works including ''Quaesita geometrica'' (1693), ''Logica demonstrativa'' (1697), and ''Neo-statica'' (1708).

==Geometrical work==
He is primarily known today for his last publication, in 1733 shortly before his death. Now considered the second work in [[non-Euclidean geometry]], ''Euclides ab omni naevo vindicatus'' (''Euclid Freed of Every Flaw'') languished in obscurity until it was rediscovered by [[Eugenio Beltrami]], in the mid-19th century.

Many of Saccheri's ideas have a precedent in the 11th-century Persian polymath [[Omar Khayyám]]'s ''Discussion of Difficulties in Euclid'' (''Risâla fî sharh mâ ashkala min musâdarât Kitâb 'Uglîdis''), a fact ignored in most Western sources until recently.

It is unclear whether Saccheri had access to that work in translation or he developed his ideas independently. The [[Saccheri quadrilateral]] is now sometimes referred to as the Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral.

The intent of Saccheri's work was ostensibly to establish the validity of Euclid by means of a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' proof of any alternative to [[Euclid]]'s [[parallel postulate]].  To do so, he assumed that the parallel postulate was false and attempted to derive a contradiction.

Since Euclid's postulate is equivalent to the statement that the sum of the internal angles of a triangle is 180°, he considered both the hypothesis that the angles add up to more or less than 180°.

The first led to the conclusion that straight lines are finite, contradicting Euclid's second postulate. So Saccheri correctly rejected it. However, the principle is now accepted as the basis of [[elliptic geometry]], where both the second and fifth postulates are rejected.

The second possibility turned out to be harder to refute. In fact he was unable to derive a logical contradiction and instead derived many non-intuitive results; for example that triangles have a maximum finite area and that there is an absolute unit of length. He finally concluded that: "the hypothesis of the acute angle is absolutely false; because it is repugnant to the nature of straight lines". Today, his results are theorems of [[hyperbolic geometry]].

There is some minor argument on whether Saccheri really meant that, as he published his work in the final year of his life, came extremely close to discovering non-Euclidean geometry and was a logician. Some believe Saccheri concluded as he did only to avoid the criticism that might come from seemingly-illogical aspects of hyperbolic geometry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30430">The '''graph coloring game''' is a mathematical game related to [[graph theory]]. '''Coloring game problems''' arose as game-theoretic versions of well-known [[graph coloring]] problems. In a coloring game, two players use a given set of colors to construct a coloring of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]], following specific rules depending on the game we consider. One player tries to successfully complete the coloring of the graph, when the other one tries to prevent him from achieving it.

== Vertex coloring game ==

The '''vertex coloring game''' was introduced in 1981 by Brams&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rediscovered ten years after by Bodlaender.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bodlaender|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its rules are as follows: 
# Alice and Bob color the vertices of a graph ''G'' with a set ''k'' of colors.
# Alice and Bob take turns, [[graph coloring#Vertex coloring|coloring properly]] an uncolored vertex (in the standard version, Alice begins). 
# If a vertex ''v'' is impossible to color properly (for any color, ''v'' has a neighbor colored with it), then Bob wins. 
# If the graph is completely colored, then Alice wins.

The '''game chromatic number''' of a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\chi_g(G)&lt;/math&gt;, is the minimum number of colors needed for Alice to win the vertex coloring game on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Trivially, for every graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\chi(G) \le \chi_g(G) \le \Delta(G) + 1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\chi(G)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[graph coloring#Vertex coloring|chromatic number]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta(G)&lt;/math&gt; its maximum [[degree (graph theory)|degree]].&lt;ref&gt;With less colors than the chromatic number, there is no proper coloring of ''G'' and so Alice cannot win. 
With more colors than the maximum degree, there is always an available color for coloring a vertex and so Alice cannot lose.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation with other notions===

'''Acyclic coloring.''' Every graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with [[acyclic coloring|acyclic chromatic number]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;\chi_g(G) \le k(k+1)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Dinski|Zhu|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marking game.''' For every graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\chi_g(G) \le col_g(G)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;col_g(G)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[marking game|game coloring number]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Almost every known upper bound for the game chromatic number of graphs are obtained from bounds on the game coloring number.

'''Cycle-restrictions on edges.''' If every edge of a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; belongs to at most &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; cycles, then &lt;math&gt;\chi_g(G) \le 4+c&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Junosza-Szaniawski|Rożej|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graph Classes===

For a class &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}&lt;/math&gt; of graphs, we denote by &lt;math&gt;\chi_g({\mathcal C})&lt;/math&gt; the smallest integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; such that every graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;\chi_g(G) \le k&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, &lt;math&gt;\chi_g({\mathcal C})&lt;/math&gt; is the exact upper bound for the game chromatic number of graphs in this class. This value is known for several standard graph classes, and bounded for some others:
* [[tree (graph theory)|Forests]]: &lt;math&gt;\chi_g({\mathcal F}) = 4&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Faigle et al.|1993}}, and implied by {{harvtxt|Junosza-Szaniawski|Rożej|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple criteria are known to determine the game chromatic number of a forest without vertex of degree 3.&lt;ref name=dunn2014&gt;{{harvtxt|Dunn et al.|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems difficult to determine the game chromatic number of forests with vertices of degree 3, even for forests with maximum degree 3.  
* [[cactus graph|Cactuses]]: &lt;math&gt;\chi_g({\mathcal C}) = 5&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sidorowicz|2007}}, and implied by {{harvtxt|Junosza-Szaniawski|Rożej|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Outerplanar graph]]s: &lt;math&gt;6 \le \chi_g({\mathcal O}) \le 7&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Guan|Zhu|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Planar graph]]s: &lt;math&gt;7 \le \chi_g({\mathcal P}) \le 17&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Upper bound by {{harvtxt|Zhu|2008}}, improving previous bounds of 33 in {{harvtxt|Kierstead|Trotter|1994}}, 30 implied by {{harvtxt|Dinski|Zhu|1999}}, 19 in {{harvtxt|Zhu|1999}} and 18 in {{harvtxt|Kierstead|2000}}. Lower bound claimed by {{harvtxt|Kierstead|Trotter|1994}}. See a survey dedicated to the game chromatic number of planar graphs in {{harvtxt|Bartnicki et al.|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Planar graph]]s of given [[girth (graph theory)|girth]]: &lt;math&gt;\chi_g({\mathcal P}_4) \le 13&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sekigushi|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;\chi_g({\mathcal P}_5) \le 8&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\chi_g({\mathcal P}_6) \le 6&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\chi_g({\mathcal P}_8) \le 5&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|He et al.|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Toroidal grid]]s:  &lt;math&gt;\chi_g({\mathcal TG}) = 5&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Raspaud|Wu|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[k-tree|Partial ''k''-trees]]: &lt;math&gt;\chi_g({\mathcal T}_k) \le 3k+2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Zhu|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Interval graph]]s: &lt;math&gt;2\omega \le \chi_g({\mathcal I}) \le 3\omega-2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is for a graph the size of its largest [[clique (graph theory)|clique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Faigle et al.|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cartesian products.'''
The game chromatic number of the cartesian product &lt;math&gt;G \square H&lt;/math&gt; is not bounded by a function of &lt;math&gt;\chi_g(G)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\chi_g(H)&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, the game chromatic number of any complete bipartite graph &lt;math&gt;K_{n,n}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to 3, but there is no upper bound for &lt;math&gt;\chi_g(K_{n,n} \square K_{m,m})&lt;/math&gt; for arbitrary &lt;math&gt;n, m&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=peterin2007&gt;{{harvtxt|Peterin|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\chi_g(K_2 \square P_1) = 2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;br /&gt; &lt;math&gt;\chi_g(K_2 \square P_k) = 3&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;k \in \{2, 3\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;br /&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\chi_g(K_2 \square P_k) = 4&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;k \ge 4&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=peterin2007 /&gt;

== Edge coloring game ==

The '''edge coloring game''', introduced by Lam, Shiu and Zu,&lt;ref name=lsz1999&gt;{{harvtxt|Lam|Shiu|Zu|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; is similar to the vertex coloring game, except Alice and Bob construct a proper [[edge coloring]] instead of a proper vertex coloring. Its rules are as follows:
# Alice and Bob are coloring the edges a graph ''G'' with a set ''k'' of colors.
# Alice and Bob are taking turns, [[edge coloring|coloring properly]] a uncolored edge (in the standard version, Alice begins). 
# If an edge ''e'' is impossible to color properly (for any color, ''e'' is adjacent to an edge colored with it), then Bob wins. 
# If the graph is completely edge-colored, then Alice wins.

Although this game can be considered as a particular case of the '''vertex coloring game''' on [[line graph]]s, it is mainly considered in the scientific literature as a distinct game. The '''game chromatic index''' of a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\chi'_g(G)&lt;/math&gt;, is the minimum number of colors needed for Alice to win this game on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

===General case===

For every graph ''G'', &lt;math&gt;\chi'(G) \le \chi'_g(G) \le 2\Delta(G) -1&lt;/math&gt;. There are graphs reaching these bounds but all the graphs we know reaching this upper bound have small maximum degree.&lt;ref name=lsz1999 /&gt; 
There exists graphs with &lt;math&gt;\chi'_g(G) &gt; 1.008\Delta(G)&lt;/math&gt; for arbitrary large values of &lt;math&gt;\Delta(G)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=bevetal2008&gt;{{harvtxt|Beveridge|Bohman|Friezeb|Pikhurko|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conjecture.''' ''There is an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that, for any arbitrary graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\chi'_g(G) \le (2-\epsilon)\Delta(G)&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
This conjecture is true when &lt;math&gt;\Delta(G)&lt;/math&gt; is large enough compared to the number of vertices in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=bevetal2008 /&gt;

* '''Arboricity.''' Let &lt;math&gt;a(G)&lt;/math&gt; be the [[arboricity]] of a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Every graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with maximum [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta(G)&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;\chi'_g(G) \le \Delta(G) + 3a(G) - 1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bartnicki|Grytczuk|2008}}, improving results on ''k''-degenerated graphs in {{harvtxt|Cai|Zhu|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graph Classes===

For a class &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}&lt;/math&gt; of graphs, we denote by &lt;math&gt;\chi'_g({\mathcal C})&lt;/math&gt; the smallest integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; such that every graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;\chi'_g(G) \le k&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, &lt;math&gt;\chi'_g({\mathcal C})&lt;/math&gt; is the exact upper bound for the game chromatic index of graphs in this class. This value is known for several standard graph classes, and bounded for some others:
* [[wheel graph|Wheels]]: &lt;math&gt;\chi'_g(W_3) = 5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\chi'_g(W_n) = n+1&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;n\ge4&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=lsz1999 /&gt;
* [[tree (graph theory)|Forests]] : &lt;math&gt;\chi'_g({\mathcal F}_\Delta) \le \Delta + 1 &lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\Delta \ne 4&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;5 \le \chi'_g({\mathcal F}_4) \le 6&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Upper bound of Δ+2 by {{harvtxt|Lam|Shiu|Zu|1999}}, then bound of Δ+1 by {{harvtxt|Erdös et al.|2004}} for cases Δ=3 and Δ≥6, and by {{harvtxt|Andres|2006}} for case Δ=5.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Moreover, if every tree of a forest &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal F}_4&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by subdivision from a [[caterpillar tree]] or contains no two adjacent vertices with degree 4, then &lt;math&gt;\chi'_g(F) \le 5&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Conditions on forests with Δ=4 are in {{harvtxt|Chan|Nong|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Open Problems ===

'''Upper bound.''' Is there a constant &lt;math&gt;c \ge 2&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\chi'_g(G) \le \Delta(G) + c&lt;/math&gt; for each graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; ? If it is true, is &lt;math&gt;c = 2&lt;/math&gt; enough ?&lt;ref name=lsz1999 /&gt;

== Incidence coloring game ==

The '''incidence coloring game''' is a graph coloring game, introduced by Andres,&lt;ref name=Andres2009&gt;{{harvtxt|Andres|2009a}}, see also erratum in {{harvtxt|Andres|2009b}}&lt;/ref&gt; and similar to the vertex coloring game, except Alice and Bob construct a proper [[incidence coloring]] instead of a proper vertex coloring. Its rules are as follows:
# Alice and Bob are coloring the [[incidence (graph)|incidences]] of a graph ''G'' with a set ''k'' of colors.
# Alice and Bob are taking turns, coloring properly an uncolored incidence (in the standard version, Alice begins). 
# If an [[incidence (graph)|incidence]] ''i'' is impossible to color properly (for any color, ''i'' is adjacent to an incident colored with it), then Bob wins. 
# If all the incidences are properly colored, then Alice wins.

The '''incidence game chromatic number''' of a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;i_g(G)&lt;/math&gt;, is the minimum number of colors needed for Alice to win this game on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

For every graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with maximum degree &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\frac{3\Delta - 1}{2} &lt; i_g(G) &lt; 3\Delta - 1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Andres2009/&gt;

=== Relations with other notions ===

* ''' [[(a,b)-decomposability|''(a,d)''-Decomposition]].''' This is the best upper bound we know for the general case. If the edges of a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; can be partitionned into two sets, one of them inducing a graph with [[arboricity]] &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, the second inducing a graph with maximum degree &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;i_g(G) \le \left\lfloor \frac{3\Delta(G) - a}{2} \right\rfloor + 8a + 3d - 1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=charpSop2014&gt;{{harvtxt|Charpentier|Sopena|2014}}, extending results of {{harvtxt|Charpentier|Sopena|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; If moreover &lt;math&gt;\Delta(G) \ge 5a + 6d&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;i_g(G) \le \left\lfloor \frac{3\Delta(G) - a}{2} \right\rfloor + 8a + d - 1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=charpSop2014 /&gt;
* '''Degeneracy.''' If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a [[degeneracy (graph theory)|''k''-degenerated graph]] with maximum [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta(G)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;i_g(G) \le 2\Delta(G) + 4k - 2&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, &lt;math&gt;i_g(G) \le 2\Delta(G) + 3k - 1&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\Delta(G) \ge 5k - 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i_g(G) \le \Delta(G) + 8k - 2&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\Delta(G) \le 5k -1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Andres2009/&gt;

=== Graph Classes ===

For a class &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}&lt;/math&gt; of graphs, we denote by &lt;math&gt;i_g({\mathcal C})&lt;/math&gt; the smallest integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; such that every graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;i_g(G) \le k&lt;/math&gt;.
* [[path graph|Paths]] : For &lt;math&gt;k \ge 13&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i_g(P_k) = 5&lt;/math&gt;. 
* [[cycle graph|Cycles]] : For &lt;math&gt;k \ge 3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i_g(C_k) = 5&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kim|2011}}, improving a similar result for ''k ≥ 7'' in {{harvtxt|Andres|2009a}} (see also erratum in {{harvtxt|Andres|2009b}})&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[star (graph theory)|Stars]] : For &lt;math&gt;k \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i_g(S_{2k}) = 3k&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Andres2009/&gt;
* [[wheel graph|Wheels]] : For &lt;math&gt;k \ge 6&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i_g(W_{2k+1}) = 3k + 2&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;k \ge 7&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i_g(W_{2k}) = 3k&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Andres2009/&gt;
* Subgraphs of [[wheel graph|Wheels]] : For &lt;math&gt;k \ge 13&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a subgraph of &lt;math&gt;W_k&lt;/math&gt; having &lt;math&gt;S_k&lt;/math&gt; as a subgraph, then &lt;math&gt;i_g(G) = \left\lceil \frac{3k}{2} \right\rceil&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kim|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Open Problems ===

* Is the upper bound &lt;math&gt;i_g(G) &lt; 3\Delta(G) - 1&lt;/math&gt; tight for every value of &lt;math&gt;\Delta(G)&lt;/math&gt; ?&lt;ref name=Andres2009/&gt;
* Is the incidence game chromatic number a monotonic parameter (i.e. is it as least as big for a graph ''G'' as for any subgraph of ''G'') ?&lt;ref name=Andres2009/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3069">'''Hilbert's twenty-fourth problem''' is a mathematical problem that was not published as part of the list of 23 problems known as [[Hilbert's problems]] but was included in [[David Hilbert]]'s original notes. The problem asks for a criterion of simplicity in [[mathematical proof]]s and the development of a [[proof theory]] with the power to prove that a given proof is the simplest possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/hilberts-twenty-fourth-problem ''Hilbert’s twenty-fourth problem''] Rüdiger Thiele, American Mathematical Monthly, January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The 24th problem was rediscovered by German historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Rüdiger Thiele|de|3=Rüdiger Thiele (Mathematiker)}} in 2000, noting that Hilbert did not include the 24th problem in the lecture presenting [[Hilbert's problems]] or any published texts. Hilbert's friends and fellow mathematicians [[Adolf Hurwitz]] and [[Hermann Minkowski]] were closely involved in the project but did not have any knowledge of this problem.

This is the full text from Hilbert's notes given in Rüdiger Thiele's paper. The section was translated by Rüdiger Thiele.
{{quote|The 24th problem in my Paris lecture was to be: Criteria of simplicity, or proof of the greatest simplicity of certain proofs. Develop a theory of the method of proof in mathematics in general. Under a given set of conditions there can be but one simplest proof. Quite generally, if there are two proofs for a theorem, you must keep going until you have derived each from the other, or until it becomes quite evident what variant conditions (and aids) have been used in the two proofs. Given two routes, it is not right to take either of these two or to look for a third; it is necessary to investigate the area lying between the two routes. Attempts at judging the simplicity of a proof are in my examination of [[Syzygy (mathematics)|syzygies]] and syzygies [Hilbert misspelled the word syzygies] between syzygies (see Hilbert 42, lectures XXXII–XXXIX). The use or the knowledge of a syzygy simplifies in an essential way a proof that a certain identity is true. Because any process of addition [is] an application of the commutative law of addition etc. [and because] this always corresponds to geometric theorems or logical conclusions, one can count these [processes], and, for instance, in proving certain theorems of elementary geometry (the Pythagoras theorem, [theorems] on remarkable points of triangles), one can very well decide which of the proofs is the simplest. [Author's note: Part of the last sentence is not only barely legible in Hilbert's notebook but also grammatically incorrect. Corrections and insertions that Hilbert made in this entry show that he wrote down the problem in haste.]|David Hilbert|[http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Ford/Thiele1-24.pdf Hilbert’s twenty-fourth problem] Rüdiger Thiele, ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'', January 2003}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3107">:''Not be confused with the philosophical [[Immanence|immanent]], the temporal [[imminence (disambiguation)|imminence]], or the prominent [[eminence (disambiguation)|eminence]].''

In mathematics, the '''immanant''' of a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] was defined by [[Dudley E. Littlewood]] and [[Archibald Read Richardson]] as a generalisation of the concepts of [[determinant]] and [[Permanent (mathematics)|permanent]].

Let &lt;math&gt;\lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Partition (number theory)|partition]] of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\chi_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; be the corresponding irreducible [[Group representation|representation-theoretic]] [[Character (group theory)|character]] of the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;. The ''immanant'' of an &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] &lt;math&gt;A=(a_{ij})&lt;/math&gt; associated with the character &lt;math&gt;\chi_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the expression

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Imm}_\lambda(A)=\sum_{\sigma\in S_n} \chi_\lambda(\sigma) a_{1\sigma(1)} a_{2\sigma(2)} \cdots a_{n\sigma(n)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The determinant is a special case of the immanant, where &lt;math&gt;\chi_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[alternating character]] &lt;math&gt;\sgn&lt;/math&gt;, of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, defined by the [[parity of a permutation]].

The permanent is the case where &lt;math&gt;\chi_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[trivial character]], which is identically equal to&amp;nbsp;1.

For example, for &lt;math&gt;3 \times 3&lt;/math&gt; matrices, there are three irreducible representations of &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;, as shown in the character table:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;
! &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;
! &lt;math&gt;(1\ 2)&lt;/math&gt;
! &lt;math&gt;(1\ 2\ 3)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\chi_1&lt;/math&gt;
| 1
| 1
| 1
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\chi_2&lt;/math&gt;
| 1
| −1
| 1
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\chi_3&lt;/math&gt;
| 2
| 0
| −1
|}
As stated above, &lt;math&gt;\chi_1&lt;/math&gt; produces the permanent and &lt;math&gt;\chi_2&lt;/math&gt; produces the determinant, but &lt;math&gt;\chi_3&lt;/math&gt; produces the operation that maps as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} \\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} \\ a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} \end{pmatrix} \rightsquigarrow 2 a_{11} a_{22} a_{33} - a_{12} a_{23} a_{31} - a_{13} a_{21} a_{32}&lt;/math&gt;

Littlewood and Richardson also studied its relation to [[Schur polynomial|Schur functions]] in the [[representation theory of the symmetric group]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1162">In [[computational geometry]], the '''link distance''' between two points in a [[polygon]] is the minimum number of line segments of any [[polygonal chain]] within the polygon that has the two points as its endpoints. The '''link diameter''' of the polygon is the maximum link distance of any two of its points.

A polygon is a [[convex polygon]] if and only if its link diameter is one.
Every [[star-shaped polygon]] has link diameter at most two: every two points may be connected by a polygonal chain that bends once, inside the kernel of the polygon. However, this property does not characterize star-shaped polygons, as there also exist polygons with holes in which the link diameter is two.

'''Lorenzo Mascheroni''' (May 13, 1750 – July 14, 1800) was an [[Italian mathematician]].

He was born near [[Bergamo]], [[Lombardy]]. At first mainly interested in the humanities ([[poetry]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] language), he eventually became professor of mathematics at [[Pavia]].
[[Image:Mascheroni - Geometria del compasso, anno V della Repubblica francese 1797 - 1415055.jpg|thumb|upright|''La geometria del compasso'', 1797]]

In his ''Geometria del Compasso'' (Pavia, 1797), he proved that any geometrical construction which can be done with [[compass and straightedge]], can also be done with compasses alone. However, the priority for this result (now known as the [[Mohr–Mascheroni theorem]]) belongs to the [[Denmark|Dane]] [[Georg Mohr]], who had previously published a proof in 1672 in an obscure book, ''[[Euclides Danicus]]''.  
This problem was the source of a musical composition called "Mascheroni Circles", performed by [[David Stutz]] on the album [[Iolet]].

In his ''Adnotationes ad calculum integrale Euleri'' (1790) he published a calculation of what is now known as the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]], usually denoted as &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; (gamma).

He died in [[Paris]].

[[Image:Mvt2.svg|thumb|260 px|right|For any function that is continuous on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; and differentiable on &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; there exists some &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in the interval &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; such that the secant joining the endpoints of the interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; is parallel to the tangent at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; .]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''mean value theorem''' states, roughly, that for a given planar [[arc (geometry)|arc]] between two endpoints, there is at least one point at which the [[tangent]] to the arc is parallel to the [[secant line|secant]] through its endpoints.

This theorem is used to prove statements about a function on an interval starting from local hypotheses about derivatives at points of the interval.

More precisely, if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a [[continuous function]] on the [[Interval (mathematics)#Terminology|closed interval]] &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, and differentiable on the [[Interval (mathematics)#Terminology|open interval]] &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a point &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; such that:&lt;ref name=mathworld&gt;{{cite web|title=Mean-Value Theorem|last=Weisstein|first=Eric|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Mean-ValueTheorem.html|work=[[MathWorld]]|publisher=[[Wolfram Research]]|accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is one of the most important results in [[real analysis]].

== History ==

A special case of this [[theorem]] was first described by [[Parameshvara]] (1370–1460), from the [[Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics]] in [[India]], in his commentaries on [[Govindasvāmi]] and [[Bhāskara II]].&lt;ref&gt;J. J. O'Connor and E. F. Robertson (2000). [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Paramesvara.html Paramesvara], ''[[MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A restricted form of the theorem was proved by [[Michel Rolle]] in 1691; the result was what is now known as [[Rolle's theorem]], and was proved only for polynomials, without the techniques of calculus. The mean value theorem in its modern form was stated and proved by [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] in 1823.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ádám Besenyei|title=Historical development of the mean value theorem| url=http://abesenyei.web.elte.hu/publications/meanvalue.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal statement ==
[[File:Mittelwertsatz3.svg|thumb|The function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; attains the slope of the secant between &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; as the derivative at the point &lt;math&gt;\xi\in(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;.]]
[[File:Mittelwertsatz6.svg|thumb|It is also possible that there are multiple tangents parallel to the secant.]]
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\R&lt;/math&gt; be a [[continuous function]] on the closed [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; , and [[differentiable function|differentiable]] on the open interval &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;b&lt;/math&gt; . Then there exists some &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.&lt;/math&gt;

The mean value theorem is a generalization of [[Rolle's theorem]], which assumes &lt;math&gt;f(a)=f(b)&lt;/math&gt;, so that the right-hand side above is zero.

The mean value theorem is still valid in a slightly more general setting. One only needs to assume that &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\R&lt;/math&gt; is [[continuous function|continuous]] on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; , and that for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; the [[limit of a function|limit]]

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

exists as a finite number or equals &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; . If finite, that limit equals &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; . An example where this version of the theorem applies is given by the real-valued [[cube root]] function mapping &lt;math&gt;x \to x^\frac13&lt;/math&gt; , whose [[derivative]] tends to infinity at the origin.

Note that the theorem, as stated, is false if a differentiable function is complex-valued instead of real-valued. For example, define &lt;math&gt;f(x)=e^{xi}&lt;/math&gt; for all real &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; . Then
:&lt;math&gt;f(2\pi)-f(0)=0=0(2\pi-0)&lt;/math&gt;
while &lt;math&gt;f'(x)\ne 0&lt;/math&gt; for any real &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; .

These formal statements are also known as Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=e27uJruMCBUC&amp;q=extended+mean+theorem#v=onepage&amp;q=mean&amp;f=false|title=Kirshna's Real Analysis: (General)|publisher=Krishna Prakashan Media|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof==
The expression &lt;math&gt;\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}&lt;/math&gt; gives the [[slope]] of the line joining the points &lt;math&gt;(a,f(a))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(b,f(b))&lt;/math&gt; , which is a [[Chord (geometry)|chord]] of the graph of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; , while &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; gives the slope of the tangent to the curve at the point &lt;math&gt;(x,f(x))&lt;/math&gt; . Thus the Mean value theorem says that given any chord of a smooth curve, we can find a point lying between the end-points of the chord such that the tangent at that point is parallel to the chord. The following proof illustrates this idea.

Define &lt;math&gt;g(x)=f(x)-rx&lt;/math&gt; , where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is a constant. Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; and differentiable on &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; , the same is true for &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; . We now want to choose &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the conditions of [[Rolle's theorem]]. Namely

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}g(a)=g(b)&amp;\iff f(a)-ra=f(b)-rb\\ &amp;\iff r(b-a)=f(b)-f(a) \\&amp;\iff r=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\cdot\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

By [[Rolle's theorem]], since &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable and &lt;math&gt;g(a)=g(b)&lt;/math&gt; , there is some &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;g'(c)=0&lt;/math&gt; , and it follows from the equality &lt;math&gt;g(x)=f(x)-rx&lt;/math&gt; that,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}&amp;g'(x) = f'(x) -r \\&amp; g'(c) = 0\\&amp;g'(c) = f'(c) - r = 0 \\&amp;\Rightarrow f'(c) = r = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==A simple application==
Assume that ''f'' is a continuous, real-valued function, defined on an arbitrary interval ''I'' of the real line. If the derivative of ''f'' at every [[interior (topology)|interior point]] of the interval ''I'' exists and is zero, then ''f'' is [[constant function|constant]] in the interior.

'''Proof:''' Assume the derivative of ''f'' at every [[interior (topology)|interior point]] of the interval ''I'' exists and is zero. Let (''a'', ''b'') be an arbitrary open interval in ''I''. By the mean value theorem, there exists a point ''c'' in (''a'',''b'') such that

:&lt;math&gt;0=f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.&lt;/math&gt;

This implies that ''f''(''a'') = ''f''(''b''). Thus, ''f'' is constant on the interior of ''I'' and thus is constant on ''I'' by continuity. (See below for a multivariable version of this result.)

'''Remarks:''' 
* Only continuity of ''f'', not differentiability, is needed at the endpoints of the interval ''I''.  No hypothesis of continuity needs to be stated if ''I'' is an [[open interval]], since the existence of a derivative at a point implies the continuity at this point.  (See the section [[Derivative#Continuity and differentiability|continuity and differentiability]] of the article [[derivative]].)
* The differentiability of ''f'' can be relaxed to [[one-sided derivatives|one-sided differentiability]], a proof given in the article on [[semi-differentiability]].

==Cauchy's mean value theorem==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Taylor's theorem]] --&gt;
'''Cauchy's mean value theorem''', also known as the '''extended mean value theorem''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ExtendedMean-ValueTheorem.html|title=Extended Mean-Value Theorem|last=W.|first=Weisstein, Eric|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a generalization of the mean value theorem. It states: If functions ''f'' and ''g'' are both continuous on the closed interval [''a'', ''b''], and differentiable on the open interval (''a'', ''b''), then there exists some ''c'' ∈ (''a'', ''b''), such that&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[Image:Cauchy.svg|right|thumb|260px|Geometrical meaning of Cauchy's theorem]]

:&lt;math&gt;(f(b)-f(a))g'(c)=(g(b)-g(a))f'(c).&lt;/math&gt;

Of course, if {{nowrap|''g''(''a'') ≠ ''g''(''b'')}} and if {{nowrap|''g′''(''c'') ≠ 0}}, this is equivalent to:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Geometrically, this means that there is some [[tangent]] to the graph of the [[curve]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.math24.net/cauchys-mean-value-theorem/|title=Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem|work=Math24|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}[a,b] \to \mathbf{R}^2\\t\mapsto (f(t),g(t))\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

which is [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the line defined by the points (''f''(''a''), ''g''(''a'')) and (''f''(''b''), ''g''(''b'')). However Cauchy's theorem does not claim the existence of such a tangent in all cases where (''f''(''a''), ''g''(''a'')) and (''f''(''b''), ''g''(''b'')) are distinct points, since it might be satisfied only for some value ''c'' with {{nowrap|''f′''(''c'') {{=}} ''g′''(''c'') {{=}} 0}}, in other words a value for which the mentioned curve is [[Stationary point|stationary]]; in such points no tangent to the curve is likely to be defined at all. An example of this situation is the curve given by

:&lt;math&gt;t\mapsto(t^3,1-t^2),&lt;/math&gt;

which on the interval [−1, 1] goes from the point (−1, 0) to (1, 0), yet never has a horizontal tangent; however it has a stationary point (in fact a [[cusp (singularity)|cusp]]) at {{nowrap|''t'' {{=}} 0}}.

Cauchy's mean value theorem can be used to prove [[l'Hôpital's rule]]. The mean value theorem is the special case of Cauchy's mean value theorem when {{nowrap|''g''(''t'') {{=}} ''t''}}.

===Proof of Cauchy's mean value theorem===
The proof of Cauchy's mean value theorem is based on the same idea as the proof of the mean value theorem.

* Suppose ''g''(''a'') ≠ ''g''(''b''). Define ''h''(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') − ''rg''(''x''), where ''r'' is fixed in such a way that ''h''(''a'') = ''h''(''b''), namely
:: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}h(a)=h(b)&amp;\iff f(a)-rg(a)=f(b)-rg(b)\\ &amp;\iff r (g(b)-g(a))=f(b)-f(a)\\ &amp;\iff r=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
:Since ''f'' and ''g'' are continuous on [''a'', ''b''] and differentiable on (''a'', ''b''), the same is true for ''h''. All in all, ''h'' satisfies the conditions of [[Rolle's theorem]]: consequently, there is some ''c'' in (''a'', ''b'') for which ''h′''(''c'') = 0. Now using the definition of ''h'' we have:
::&lt;math&gt;0=h'(c)=f'(c)-rg'(c) = f'(c)- \left (\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} \right ) g'(c).&lt;/math&gt;
:Therefore:
::&lt;math&gt;f'(c)= \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} g'(c),&lt;/math&gt;
:which implies the result.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* If ''g''(''a'') = ''g''(''b''), then, applying [[Rolle's theorem]] to ''g'', it follows that there exists ''c'' in (''a'', ''b'') for which ''g′''(''c'') = 0. Using this choice of ''c'', Cauchy's mean value theorem (trivially) holds.

==Generalization for determinants==
Assume that &lt;math&gt;f, g,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; are differentiable functions on &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; that are continuous on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;. Define

:&lt;math&gt; D(x)=\left |\begin{array}{ccc}f(x) &amp; g(x)&amp; h(x)\\ f(a) &amp; g(a) &amp; h(a)\\ f(b) &amp; g(b)&amp; h(b)\end{array}\right|&lt;/math&gt;

There exists &lt;math&gt;c\in(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; D'(c)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Notice that
:&lt;math&gt; D'(x)=\left |\begin{array}{ccc}f'(x) &amp; g'(x)&amp; h'(x)\\ f(a) &amp; g(a) &amp; h(a)\\ f(b) &amp; g(b)&amp; h(b)\end{array}\right|&lt;/math&gt;
and if we place &lt;math&gt;h(x)=1&lt;/math&gt;, we get Cauchy's mean value theorem. If we place &lt;math&gt;h(x)=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(x)=x&lt;/math&gt; we get '''Lagrange's mean value theorem'''.

The proof of the generalization is quite simple: each of &lt;math&gt;D(a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D(b)&lt;/math&gt; are determinants with two identical rows, hence &lt;math&gt;D(a)=D(b)=0&lt;/math&gt;. The Rolle's theorem implies that there exists &lt;math&gt;c\in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;D'(c)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Mean value theorem in several variables ==
The mean value theorem generalizes to real functions of multiple variables. The trick is to use parametrization to create a real function of one variable, and then apply the one-variable theorem.

Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be an open convex subset of &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; , and let &lt;math&gt;f:G\to\R&lt;/math&gt; be a differentiable function. Fix points &lt;math&gt;x,y\in G&lt;/math&gt; , and define &lt;math&gt;g(t)=f\Big((1-t)x+ty\Big)&lt;/math&gt; . Since &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is a differentiable function in one variable, the mean value theorem gives:

:&lt;math&gt;g(1)-g(0)=g'(c)&lt;/math&gt;

for some &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; between 0 and 1. But since &lt;math&gt;g(1)=f(y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(0)=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; , computing &lt;math&gt;g'(c)&lt;/math&gt; explicitly we have:

:&lt;math&gt;f(y)-f(x)=\nabla f\Big((1-c)x+cy\Big)\cdot (y-x)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; denotes a [[gradient]] and &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; a [[dot product]]. Note that this is an exact analog of the theorem in one variable (in the case &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt; this ''is'' the theorem in one variable). By the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]], the equation gives the estimate:

:&lt;math&gt;\Bigg|f(y)-f(x)\Bigg|\le\Bigg|\nabla f\Big((1-c)x+cy\Big)\Bigg|\ \Big|y - x\Big|.&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, when the partial derivatives of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; are bounded, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz continuous]] (and therefore [[Uniform continuity|uniformly continuous]]). Note that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not assumed to be continuously differentiable or continuous on the closure of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; . However, in order to use the chain rule to compute &lt;math&gt; g' &lt;/math&gt;, we really do need to know that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable; the existence of the &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; partial derivatives is not sufficient by itself {{clarify|date=March 2018| reason=Sufficient for what to be true?}}.

As an application of the above, we prove that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is constant if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is open and connected and every partial derivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is 0. Pick some point &lt;math&gt;x_0\in G&lt;/math&gt; , and let &lt;math&gt;g(x)=f(x)-f(x_0)&lt;/math&gt; . We want to show &lt;math&gt;g(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x\in G&lt;/math&gt; . For that, let &lt;math&gt;E=\{x\in G:g(x)=0\}&lt;/math&gt; . Then ''E'' is closed and nonempty. It is open too: for every &lt;math&gt;x\in E&lt;/math&gt; ,

:&lt;math&gt;\Big|g(y)\Big|=\Bigg|g(y)-g(x)\Bigg|\le (0)\Big|y-x\Big|=0&lt;/math&gt;

for every &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in some neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; . (Here, it is crucial that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are sufficiently close to each other.) Since &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is connected, we conclude &lt;math&gt;E=G&lt;/math&gt; .

The above arguments are made in a coordinate-free manner; hence, they generalize to the case when &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of a Banach space.

== Mean value theorem for vector-valued functions ==
There is no exact analog of the mean value theorem for vector-valued functions.

In ''Principles of Mathematical Analysis,'' [[Walter Rudin|Rudin]] gives an inequality which can be applied to many of the same situations to which the mean value theorem is applicable in the one dimensional case:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1979RudinW|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis (3rd ed.)|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=978-0-07-054235-8|location=New York|pages=113|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theorem.'''  ''For a continuous vector-valued function &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}^k&lt;/math&gt; differentiable on &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;x\in(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{f}'(x)|\geq\frac{1}{b-a}|\mathbf{f}(b)-\mathbf{f}(a)| &lt;/math&gt;.''

[[Jean Dieudonné]] in his classic treatise ''Foundations of Modern Analysis'' discards the mean value theorem and replaces it by mean inequality as the proof is not constructive and one cannot find the mean value and in applications one only needs mean inequality. [[Serge Lang]] in ''Analysis I ''uses the mean value theorem, in integral form, as an instant reflex but this use requires the continuity of the derivative. If one uses the [[Henstock–Kurzweil integral]] one can have the mean value theorem in integral form without the additional assumption that derivative should be continuous as every derivative is Henstock–Kurzweil integrable. The problem is roughly speaking the following: If ''f'' : ''U'' → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; is a differentiable function (where ''U'' ⊂ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is open) and if ''x'' + ''th'', ''x, h'' ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''t'' ∈ [0, 1] is the line segment in question (lying inside ''U''), then one can apply the above parametrization procedure to each of the component functions ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (''i'' = 1, ..., ''m'') of ''f'' (in the above notation set ''y'' = ''x'' + ''h''). In doing so one finds points ''x'' + ''t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;h'' on the line segment satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;f_i(x+h) - f_i(x) = \nabla f_i (x + t_ih) \cdot h.&lt;/math&gt;

But generally there will not be a ''single'' point ''x'' + ''t*h'' on the line segment satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;f_i(x+h) - f_i(x) = \nabla f_i (x + t^* h) \cdot h.&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''i'' ''simultaneously''. For example, define:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} f : [0, 2 \pi] \to \mathbf{R}^2 \\ f(x) = (\cos(x), \sin(x)) \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Then &lt;math&gt;f(2\pi) - f(0) = \mathbf{0} \in \mathbf{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;f_1'(x)=-\sin (x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_2'(x)=\cos (x)&lt;/math&gt; are never simultaneously zero as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ranges over &lt;math&gt;\left[0, 2 \pi\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

However a certain type of generalization of the mean value theorem to vector-valued functions is obtained as follows: Let ''f'' be a continuously differentiable real-valued function defined on an open interval ''I'', and let ''x'' as well as ''x'' + ''h'' be points of ''I''. The mean value theorem in one variable tells us that there exists some ''t*'' between 0 and 1 such that

:&lt;math&gt;f(x+h)-f(x) = f'(x+t^*h)\cdot h.&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, we have, by the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] followed by a change of variables,

:&lt;math&gt; f(x+h)-f(x) = \int_x^{x+h} f'(u) \, du = \left (\int_0^1 f'(x+th)\,dt\right)\cdot h.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the value ''f′''(''x'' + ''t*h'') at the particular point ''t*'' has been replaced by the mean value

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 f'(x+th)\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

This last version can be generalized to vector valued functions:

:'''Lemma 1.''' Let ''U'' ⊂ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; be open, ''f'' : ''U'' → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; continuously differentiable, and ''x'' ∈ ''U'', ''h'' ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; vectors such that the line segment ''x'' + ''th'',  0 ≤ ''t'' ≤ 1 remains in ''U''. Then we have:
::&lt;math&gt;f(x+h)-f(x) = \left (\int_0^1 Df(x+th)\,dt\right)\cdot h,&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''Df'' denotes the [[Jacobian matrix]] of ''f'' and the integral of a matrix is to be understood componentwise.

'''Proof.''' Let ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote the components of ''f'' and define:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} g_i : [0,1] \to \mathbf{R} \\ g_i(t) = f_i (x +th) \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

Then we have

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; f_i(x+h)-f_i(x) = g_i(1)-g_i(0) =\int_0^1 g_i'(t)\,dt \\
= {} &amp; \int_0^1 \left (\sum_{j=1}^n \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j} (x+th)h_j\right)\,dt = \sum_{j=1}^n \left (\int_0^1 \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}(x+th)\,dt\right)h_j.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The claim follows since ''Df'' is the matrix consisting of the components &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}.&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Lemma 2.''' Let ''v'' : [''a'', ''b''] → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; be a continuous function defined on the interval [''a'', ''b''] ⊂ '''R'''. Then we have
::&lt;math&gt;\left \|\int_a^b v(t)\,dt\right\|\leqslant \int_a^b \|v(t)\|\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof.''' Let ''u'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; denote the value of the integral
:&lt;math&gt;u:=\int_a^b v(t)\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;
Now we have (using the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]]):
:&lt;math&gt;\|u\|^2 = \langle u,u \rangle =\left \langle \int_a^b v(t) \, dt, u \right\rangle = \int_a^b \langle v(t),u \rangle \,dt \leqslant \int_a^b \| v(t) \|\cdot \|u \|\,dt = \|u\| \int_a^b \|v(t)\|\,dt&lt;/math&gt;
Now cancelling the norm of ''u'' from both ends gives us the desired inequality.

:'''Mean Value Inequality.''' If the norm of ''Df''(''x'' + ''th'') is bounded by some constant ''M'' for ''t'' in [0, 1], then
::&lt;math&gt;\|f(x+h)-f(x)\| \leqslant M\|h\|.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof.''' From Lemma 1 and 2  it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;\|f(x+h)-f(x)\|=\left \|\int_0^1 (Df(x+th)\cdot h)\,dt\right\|  \leqslant \int_0^1 \|Df(x+th)\| \cdot \|h\|\, dt \leqslant M\| h\|.&lt;/math&gt;

== Mean value theorems for definite integrals ==

===First mean value theorem for definite integrals===
[[File:积分中值定理.jpg|thumb|right|Geometrically: interpreting f(c) as the height of a rectangle and ''b''–''a'' as the width, this rectangle has the same area as the region below the curve from ''a'' to ''b''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathwords.com/m/mean_value_theorem_integrals.htm|title=Mathwords: Mean Value Theorem for Integrals|author=|date=|website=www.mathwords.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Let ''f'' : [''a'', ''b''] → '''R''' be a continuous function. Then there exists ''c'' in (''a'', ''b'') such that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = f(c)(b - a).&lt;/math&gt;

Since the mean value of ''f'' on [''a'', ''b''] is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) \, dx,&lt;/math&gt;

we can interpret the conclusion as ''f'' achieves its mean value at some ''c'' in (''a'', ''b'').&lt;ref name="Comenetz2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Comenetz|title=Calculus: The Elements| year=2002| publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-02-4904-5|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, if ''f'' : [''a'', ''b''] → '''R''' is continuous and ''g'' is an integrable function that does not change sign on [''a'', ''b''], then there exists ''c'' in (''a'', ''b'') such that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x) g(x) \, dx = f(c) \int_a^b  g(x) \, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

===Proof of the first mean value theorem for definite integrals===
Suppose ''f'' : [''a'', ''b''] → '''R''' is continuous and ''g'' is a nonnegative integrable function on [''a'', ''b'']. By the [[extreme value theorem]], there exists ''m'' and ''M'' such that for each ''x'' in [''a'', ''b''], &lt;math&gt;m\leqslant  f(x) \leqslant  M &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f[a,b] = [m, M]&lt;/math&gt;. Since ''g'' is nonnegative,

:&lt;math&gt;m \int_a^b g(x) \, dx \leqslant  \int^b_a f(x)g(x) \, dx \leqslant  M \int_a^b g(x) \, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Now let

:&lt;math&gt;I = \int_a^b g(x) \, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;I = 0&lt;/math&gt;, we're done since

:&lt;math&gt;0 \leqslant  \int_a^b f(x) g(x)\, dx \leqslant  0&lt;/math&gt;

means

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)g(x)\, dx=0,&lt;/math&gt;

so for any ''c'' in (''a'', ''b''),

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)g(x)\, dx = f(c) I = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''I'' ≠ 0, then

:&lt;math&gt;m \leqslant  \frac1I \int_a^b f(x)g(x)\,dx \leqslant  M.&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[intermediate value theorem]], ''f'' attains every value of the interval [''m'', ''M''], so for some ''c'' in [''a'', ''b'']

:&lt;math&gt;f(c) = \frac1I\int^b_a f(x) g(x) \, dx,&lt;/math&gt;

that is,

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x) g(x) \, dx = f(c) \int_a^b  g(x) \, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, if ''g'' is negative on [''a'', ''b''], then

:&lt;math&gt;M \int_a^b g(x) \, dx \leqslant  \int^b_a f(x)g(x) \, dx \leqslant  m \int_a^b g(x) \, dx,&lt;/math&gt;

and we still get the same result as above.

QED

===Second mean value theorem for definite integrals===
There are various slightly different theorems called the '''second mean value theorem for definite integrals'''.  A commonly found version is as follows:

:If ''G'' : [''a'', ''b''] → '''R''' is a positive [[monotone function|monotonically decreasing]] function and φ : [''a'', ''b''] → '''R''' is an integrable function, then there exists a number ''x'' in (''a'', ''b''] such that
::&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b G(t)\varphi(t)\,dt = G(a^+) \int_a^x \varphi(t)\,dt. &lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;G(a^+)&lt;/math&gt; stands for &lt;math&gt;{\lim_{x\to a^+}G(x)}&lt;/math&gt;, the existence of which follows from the conditions. Note that it is essential that the interval (''a'', ''b''] contains ''b''. A variant not having this requirement is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=E. W. |last=Hobson |year=1909 |title=On the Second Mean-Value Theorem of the Integral Calculus |journal=[[Proceedings London Mathematical Society|Proc. London Math. Soc.]] |volume=S2–7 |issue=1 |pages=14–23 |MR=1575669 |doi=10.1112/plms/s2-7.1.14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:If ''G'' : [''a'', ''b''] → '''R''' is a [[monotone function|monotonic]] (not necessarily decreasing and positive) function and φ : [''a'', ''b''] → '''R''' is an integrable function, then there exists a number ''x'' in (''a'', ''b'') such that
::&lt;math&gt; \int_a^b G(t)\varphi(t)\,dt = G(a^+) \int_a^x \varphi(t)\,dt + G(b^-) \int_x^b \varphi(t)\,dt. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Mean value theorem for integration fails for vector-valued functions ===
If the function &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; returns a multi-dimensional vector, then the MVT for integration is not true, even if the domain of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is also multi-dimensional.

For example, consider the following 2-dimensional function defined on an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional cube:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} G: [0,2\pi]^n \to \mathbb{R}^2 \\ G(x_1,\cdots,x_n)=\left (\sin(x_1+\cdots+x_n), \cos(x_1+\cdots+x_n)\right)\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

Then, by symmetry it is easy to see that the mean value of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; over its domain is (0,0):

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{[0,2\pi]^n} G(x_1,\cdots,x_n) dx_1 \cdots dx_n = (0,0)&lt;/math&gt;

However, there is no point in which &lt;math&gt;G=(0,0)&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;|G|=1&lt;/math&gt; everywhere.

==A probabilistic analogue of the mean value theorem==
Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be non-negative [[random variable]]s such that E[''X''] &lt; E[''Y''] &lt; ∞ and &lt;math&gt;X\leqslant_{st} Y&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. ''X'' is smaller than ''Y'' in the [[Stochastic ordering|usual stochastic order]]).  Then there exists an absolutely continuous non-negative random variable ''Z'' having [[probability density function]]

:&lt;math&gt; f_Z(x)={\Pr(Y&gt;x)-\Pr(X&gt;x)\over {\rm E}[Y]-{\rm E}[X]}\,, \qquad x\geqslant 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''g'' be a [[Measurable function|measurable]] and [[differentiable function]] such that E[''g''(''X'')], E[''g''(''Y'')] &lt; ∞, and let its derivative ''g′''  be measurable and [[Riemann integral|Riemann-integrable]]  on the interval [''x'', ''y''] for all ''y'' ≥ ''x'' ≥ 0.  Then, E[''g′''(''Z'')] is finite and&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Di Crescenzo |year=1999 |title=A Probabilistic Analogue of the Mean Value Theorem and Its Applications to Reliability Theory |journal=[[J. Appl. Probab.]] |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=706–719 |jstor=3215435 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm E}[g(Y)]-{\rm E}[g(X)]={\rm E}[g'(Z)]\,[{\rm E}(Y)-{\rm E}(X)].&lt;/math&gt;

== Generalization in complex analysis ==
As noted above, the theorem does not hold for differentiable complex-valued functions. Instead, a generalization of the theorem is stated such:&lt;ref name=PlanetMath&gt;{{cite web|title=Complex Mean-Value Theorem|url=http://planetmath.org/ComplexMeanValueTheorem.html|work=[[PlanetMath]]|publisher=[[PlanetMath]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''f'' : Ω → '''C''' be a [[holomorphic function]] on the open convex set Ω, and let ''a'' and ''b'' be distinct points in Ω. Then there exist points ''u'', ''v'' on ''L&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;'' (the line segment from ''a'' to ''b'') such that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}(f'(u)) = \mathrm{Re}\left ( \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} \right),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Im}(f'(v)) = \mathrm{Im}\left ( \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Where Re() is the Real part and Im() is the Imaginary part of a complex-valued function.

Whereas ''logic'' studies how [[formal system|logical system]]s can be used to construct [[Validity (logic)|valid]] and [[soundness|sound]] [[argument]]s, metalogic studies the properties of logical systems.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Gensler, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jpteBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Introduction to Logic], Routledge, 2001, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; Logic concerns the truths that may be derived using a logical system; metalogic concerns the truths that may be derived ''about'' the [[formal language|languages]] and systems that are used to express truths.&lt;ref name="metalogic"&gt;[[Geoffrey Hunter (logician)|Hunter, Geoffrey]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oHpMtskGcv0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Metalogic: An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First-Order Logic]'', University of California Press, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic objects of metalogical study are formal languages, formal systems, and their [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretations]]. The study of interpretation of formal systems is the branch of [[mathematical logic]]  that is known as [[model theory]], and the study of [[deductive system]]s is the branch that is known as [[proof theory]].

== Overview ==

=== Formal language ===
{{Main|Formal language}}

A ''formal language'' is an organized set of [[symbol (formal)|symbols]], the symbols of which precisely define it by shape and place. Such a language therefore can be defined without [[reference]] to the [[meaning (linguistics)|meanings]] of its expressions; it can exist before any [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] is assigned to it—that is, before it has any meaning. First order logic is expressed in some formal language. A formal grammar determines which symbols and sets of symbols are [[well-formed formula|formulas]] in a formal language.

A formal language can be formally defined as a set ''A'' of strings (finite sequences) on a fixed alphabet α. Some authors, including [[Rudolf Carnap]], define the language as the ordered pair &lt;α, ''A''&gt;.&lt;ref name="itslaia"&gt;[[Rudolf Carnap]] (1958) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hAvVAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Introduction to Symbolic Logic and its Applications]'', p.&amp;nbsp;102.&lt;/ref&gt; Carnap also requires that each element of α must occur in at least one string in ''A''.

=== Formation rules ===
{{Main|Formation rule}}

''Formation rules'' (also called ''formal grammar'') are a precise description of the [[well-formed formula]]s of a formal language. They are synonymous with the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[String (computer science)|strings]] over the [[alphabet]] of the formal language that constitute well formed formulas. However, it does not describe their [[semantics]] (i.e. what they mean).

=== Formal systems ===
{{Main|Formal system}}

A ''formal system'' (also called a ''logical calculus'', or a ''logical system'') consists of a formal language together with a [[Deductive system|deductive apparatus]] (also called a ''deductive system''). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of [[Rule of inference|transformation rule]]s (also called ''inference rules'') or a set of [[axiom]]s, or have both. A formal system is used to [[Proof theory|derive]] one expression from one or more other expressions.

A ''formal system'' can be formally defined as an ordered triple &lt;α,&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;d&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;d is the relation of direct derivability. This relation is understood in a comprehensive [[Sense and reference|sense]] such that the primitive sentences of the formal system are taken as directly [[formal proof|derivable]] from the [[empty set]] of sentences. Direct derivability is a relation between a sentence and a finite, possibly empty set of sentences. Axioms are so chosen that every first place member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;d is a member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; and every second place member is a finite subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;.

A ''formal system'' can also be defined with only the relation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;d.   Thereby can be omitted &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt;  and α in the definitions of ''interpreted formal language'', and ''interpreted formal system''. However, this method can be more difficult to understand and use.&lt;ref name = "itslaia"/&gt;

=== Formal proofs ===
{{Main|Formal proof}}

A ''formal proof'' is a sequence of well-formed formulas of a formal language, the last of which is a [[theorem]] of a formal system. The theorem is a [[Logical consequence|syntactic consequence]] of all the well formed formulae that precede it in the proof system. For a well formed formula to qualify as part of a proof, it must result from applying a rule of the deductive apparatus of some formal system to the previous well formed formulae in the proof sequence.

=== Interpretations ===
{{Main|Interpretation (logic)|Formal semantics (logic)}}

An ''interpretation'' of a formal system is the assignment of meanings to the symbols and [[Truth value|truth-value]]s to the sentences of the formal system. The study of interpretations is called [[Formal semantics (logic)|Formal semantics]]. ''Giving an interpretation'' is synonymous with ''constructing a [[Structure (mathematical logic)|model]]''.

== Important distinctions ==

=== Metalanguage–object language ===

{{Main|Metalanguage|Object language}}

In metalogic, formal languages are sometimes called ''object languages''. The language used to make statements about an object language is called a ''metalanguage''. This distinction is a key difference between logic and metalogic. While logic deals with ''proofs in a formal system'', expressed in some formal language, metalogic deals with ''proofs about a formal system'' which are expressed in a metalanguage about some object language.

=== Syntax–semantics ===
{{Main|Syntax (logic)|Formal semantics (logic)}}

In metalogic, 'syntax' has to do with formal languages or formal systems without regard to any interpretation of them, whereas, 'semantics' has to do with interpretations of formal languages. The term 'syntactic' has a slightly wider scope than 'proof-theoretic', since it may be applied to properties of formal languages without any deductive systems, as well as to formal systems. 'Semantic' is synonymous with 'model-theoretic'.

=== Use–mention ===
{{Main|Use–mention distinction}}

In metalogic, the words 'use' and 'mention', in both their noun and verb forms, take on a technical sense in order to identify an important distinction.&lt;ref name="metalogic"/&gt; The ''use–mention distinction'' (sometimes referred to as the ''words-as-words distinction'') is the distinction between ''using'' a word (or phrase) and ''mentioning'' it. Usually it is indicated that an expression is being mentioned rather than used by enclosing it in quotation marks, printing it in italics, or setting the expression by itself on a line. The enclosing in quotes of an expression gives us the [[name]] of an expression, for example:

:'Metalogic' is the name of this article.
:This article is about metalogic.

=== Type–token ===
{{Main|Type–token distinction}}

The ''type-token distinction'' is a distinction in metalogic, that separates an abstract concept from the objects which are particular instances of the concept. For example, the particular bicycle in your garage is a token of the [[Type–token distinction|type]] of thing known as "The bicycle." Whereas, the bicycle in your garage is in a particular place at a particular time, that is not true of "the bicycle" as used in the sentence: "''The bicycle'' has become more popular recently." This distinction is used to clarify the meaning of [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] of [[formal language]]s.

== History ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Metalogical questions have been asked since the time of [[Aristotle]]. However, it was only with the rise of formal languages in the late 19th and early 20th century that investigations into the foundations of logic began to flourish. In 1904, [[David Hilbert]] observed that in investigating the [[foundations of mathematics]] that logical notions are presupposed, and therefore a simultaneous account of metalogical and [[metamathematics|metamathematical]] principles was required. Today, metalogic and metamathematics are largely synonymous with each other, and both have been substantially subsumed by [[mathematical logic]] in academia. A possible alternate, less mathematical model may be found in the writings of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and other [[semiotics|semioticians]].

== Results ==
Results in metalogic consist of such things as [[formal proof]]s demonstrating the [[consistency]], [[completeness (logic)|completeness]], and [[Decidability (logic)|decidability]] of particular [[formal system]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1695">In [[calculus]], the '''method of normals''' was a technique invented by [[Descartes]] for finding [[surface normal|normal]] and [[tangent]] lines to [[curve]]s.  It represented one of the earliest methods for constructing tangents to curves.  The method hinges on the observation that the [[radius]] of a [[circle]] is always normal to the circle itself.  With this in mind Descartes would construct a circle that was tangent to a given curve.  He could then use the radius at the point of intersection to find the slope of a normal line, and from this one can easily find the slope of a tangent line.  

This was discovered about the same time as [[Fermat]]'s method of [[adequality]].  While Fermat's method had more in common with the [[infinitesimal]] techniques that were to be used later, Descartes' method was more influential in the early history of calculus. {{harv|Katz|2008}}

One reason Descartes' method fell from favor was the algebraic complexity it involved.  On the other hand this method can be used to rigorously define the [[derivative (mathematics)|derivative]] for a wide class of functions using neither infinitesimal nor [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] techniques.  It is also related to a completely general definition of differentiability given by [[Carathéodory]] {{harv|Range|2011}}.

In [[geometry]], '''pinwheel tilings''' are [[aperiodic tiling|non-periodic tilings]] defined by [[Charles Radin]] and based on a construction due to [[John H. Conway|John Conway]].
They are the first known non-periodic tilings to each have the property that their tiles appear in infinitely many orientations.

==The Conway tessellation==

[[image:pinwheel 1.svg|250px|thumb|right|Conway triangle decomposition into homothetic smaller triangles.]]
Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be the right triangle with side length &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt;.
Conway noticed that &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; can be divided in five isometric copies of its image by the dilation of factor &lt;math&gt;1/\sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[image:pinwheel 2.gif|250px|thumb|right|The increasing sequence of triangles which defines the Conway tiling of the plane.]]
By suitably rescaling and translating/rotating, this operation can be iterated to obtain an infinite increasing sequence of growing triangles all made of isometric copies of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.
The union of all these triangles yields a tiling of the whole plane by isometric copies of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.

In this tiling, isometric copies of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; appears in infinitely many orientations (this is due to the angles &lt;math&gt;\arctan(1/2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\arctan(2)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, both non-commensurable with &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;).
Despite this, all the vertices have rational coordinates.

==The pinwheel tilings==

[[image:pinwheel 3.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A pinwheel tiling: tiles can be grouped in sets of five (thick lines) to form a new pinwheel tiling (up to rescaling)]]
Radin relied on the above construction of Conway to define pinwheel tilings.
Formally, the pinwheel tilings are the tilings whose tiles are isometric copies of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, in which a tile may intersect another tile only either on a whole side or on half the length &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; side, and such that the following property holds.
Given any pinwheel tiling &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, there is a pinwheel tiling &lt;math&gt;P'&lt;/math&gt; which, once each tile is divided in five following the Conway construction and the result is dilated by a factor &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt;, is equal to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.
In other words, the tiles of any pinwheel tilings can be grouped in sets of five into homothetic tiles, so that these homothetic tiles form (up to rescaling) a new pinwheel tiling.

The tiling constructed by Conway is a pinwheel tiling, but there are uncountably many other different pinwheel tiling.
They are all ''locally undistinguishable'' (''i.e.'', they have the same finite patches).
They all share with the Conway tiling the property that tiles appear in infinitely many orientations (and vertices have rational coordinates).

The main result proven by Radin is that there is a finite (though very large) set of so-called prototiles, with each being obtained by coloring the sides of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, so that the pinwheel tilings are exactly the tilings of the plane by isometric copies of these prototiles, with the condition that whenever two copies intersect in a point, they have the same color in this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Radin, C. | title = The Pinwheel Tilings of the Plane | journal = [[Annals of Mathematics]] | volume = 139 | issue = 3 | pages =661–702 | date = May 1994 | url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.44.9723 | accessdate = 2007-10-25 | doi = 10.2307/2118575 | jstor = 2118575}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In terms of [[symbolic dynamics]], this means that the pinwheel tilings form a [[shift space#Characterization and sofic subshifts|sofic subshift]].

==Generalizations==

Radin and Conway proposed a three-dimensional analogue which was dubbed the [[quaquaversal tiling]].&lt;ref&gt;Radin, C., Conway, J., Quaquaversal tiling and rotations, preprint, Princeton University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; There are other variants and generalizations of the original idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sadun, L. | title = Some Generalizations of the Pinwheel Tiling | journal = [[Discrete and Computational Geometry]] | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages =79–110 | publisher = | location = | date = January 1998 | url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.241.1917 | format = PDF/PostScript | accessdate = 2007-10-25 | doi=10.1007/pl00009379| arxiv = math/9712263 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[image:Pinwheel fractal.png|250px|thumb|right|Pinwheel fractal]]
One gets a fractal by iteratively dividing &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; in five isometrics copies, following the Conway construction, and discarding the middle triangle (''ad infinitum''). This "pinwheel fractal" has [[Hausdorff dimension]] &lt;math&gt; d = \frac{\ln 4}{\ln \sqrt 5}\approx 1.7227&lt;/math&gt;.

==Use in architecture==
[[File:Federation-square-sandstone-facade.jpg|thumb|right|Federation Square's sandstone façade]]
[[Federation Square]], a building complex in Melbourne, Australia, features the pinwheel tiling.  In the project, the tiling pattern is used to create the structural sub-framing for the facades, allowing for the facades to be fabricated off-site, in a factory and later erected to form the facades.  The pinwheel tiling system was based on the single triangular element, composed of zinc, perforated zinc, sandstone or glass (known as a tile), which was joined to 4 other similar tiles on an aluminum frame, to form a "panel".  Five panels were affixed to a galvanized steel frame, forming a "mega-panel", which were then hoisted onto support frames for the facade.  The rotational positioning of the tiles gives the facades a more random, uncertain compositional quality, even though the process of its construction is based on pre-fabrication and repetition.  The same pinwheel tiling system is used in the development of the structural frame and glazing for the "Atrium" at Federation Square, although in this instance, the pin-wheel grid has been made "3-dimensional" to form a portal frame structure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5080">'''Polyhedral space''' is a certain [[metric space]]. A ([[Euclidean space|Euclidean]]) polyhedral space is a (usually finite) [[simplicial complex]] in which every simplex has a [[Flat (geometry)|flat]] metric. (Other spaces of interest are spherical and hyperbolic polyhedral spaces, where every simplex has a metric of constant positive or negative curvature). In the sequel all polyhedral spaces are taken to be Euclidean polyhedral spaces.

==Examples==
All 1-dimensional polyhedral spaces are just [[metric graph]]s. A good source of 2-dimensional examples constitute triangulations of 2-dimensional surfaces. The surface of a convex polyhedron in &lt;math&gt;R^3&lt;/math&gt; is a 2-dimensional polyhedral space.

Any [[PL-manifold]] (which is essentially the same as a [[simplicial manifold]], just with some technical assumptions for convenience) is an example of a polyhedral space. In fact, one can consider [[pseudo-manifold|pseudomanifolds]], although it makes more sense to restrict the attention to normal manifolds.

==Metric singularities==
In the study of polyhedral spaces (particularly of those that are also [[topological manifold]]s) metric singularities play a central role. Let a polyhedral space be an n-dimensional manifold. If a point in a polyhedral space that is an n-dimensional topological manifold has no neighborhood isometric to a Euclidean neighborhood in R^n, this point is said to be a metric singularity. It is a singularity of codimension k, if it has a neighborhood isometric to R^{n-k} with a [[metric cone]]. Singularities of codimension 2 are of major importance; they are characterized by a single number, the conical angle.

The singularities can also studied topologically. Then, for example, there are no topological singularities of codimension 2. In a 3-dimensional polyhedral space without a boundary (faces not glued to other faces) any point has a neighborhood homeomorphic either to an open ball or to a cone over the [[projective plane]]. In the former case, the point is necessarily a codimension 3 metric singularity. The general problem of topologically classifying singularities in polyhedral spaces is largely unresolved (apart from simple statements that e.g. any singularity is locally a cone over a spherical polyhedral space one dimension less and we can study singularities there).

==Curvature==
It is interesting to study the curvature of polyhedral spaces (the curvature in the sense of [[Alexandrov topology|Alexandrov spaces]]), specifically polyhedral spaces of nonnegative and nonpositive curvature. Nonnegative curvature on singularities of codimension 2 implies nonnegative curvature overall. However, this is false for nonpositive curvature. For example, consider R^3 with one octant removed. Then on the edges of this octant (singularities of codimension 2) the curvature is nonpositive (because of branching geodesics), yet it is not the case at the origin (singularity of codimension 3), where a triangle such as (0,0,e), (0,e,0), (e,0,0) has a median longer than would be in the Euclidean plane, which is characteristic of nonnegative curvature.

==Additional structure==
Many concepts of [[Riemannian geometry]] can be applied. There is only one obvious notion of [[parallel transport]] and only one natural [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]]. The concept of [[holonomy]] is strikingly simple in this case. The [[restricted holonomy group]] is trivial, and so there is a [[homomorphism]] from the [[fundamental group]] onto the [[holonomy group]]. It may be especially convenient to remove all singularities to obtain a space with a flat Riemannian metric and to study the holonomies there. One concepts thus arising are polyhedral Kähler manifolds, when the holonomies are contained in a group, conjugate to the [[unitary matrices]]. In this case, the holonomies also preserve a [[symplectic form]], together with a [[Complex manifold|complex structure]] on this polyhedral space (manifold) with the singularities removed. 
All the concepts such as [[differential form]], [[L2 differential form]], etc. are adjusted accordingly.

==Other topics==
Another direction of research are developments of [[dynamical billiards]] in polyhedral spaces, e.g. of nonpositive curvature (hyperbolic billiards). Positively curved polyhedral spaces arise also as [[link (geometry)|links]] of points (typically metric singularities) in Euclidean polyhedral spaces.

==History==

In full generality, polyhedral spaces were first defined by Milka &lt;ref&gt;Milka, A. D. Multidimensional spaces with polyhedral metric of nonnegative curvature. I. (Russian) Ukrain. Geometr. Sb. Vyp. 5--6 1968 103–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], '''Pugh's closing lemma''' is a result that links [[Orbit (dynamics) | periodic orbit]] solutions of [[Differential equation | differential equations]] to [[Chaos theory | chaotic behaviour]]. It can be formally stated as follows:

:Let &lt;math&gt; f:M \to M &lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt; C^1 &lt;/math&gt; [[diffeomorphism]] of a [[Compact space | compact]] [[Differentiable manifold | smooth manifold]] &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt;. Given a [[Wandering set | nonwandering point]] &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;, there exists a diffeomorphism &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt; arbitrarily close to &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt; C^1 &lt;/math&gt; [[topology]] of &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Diff}^1(M) &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is a [[periodic point]] of &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Charles C. |last=Pugh |title=An Improved Closing Lemma and a General Density Theorem |journal=American Journal of Mathematics |volume=89 |issue=4 |pages=1010–1021 |year=1967 |doi=10.2307/2373414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
Pugh's closing lemma means, for example, that any chaotic set in a bounded continuous [[dynamical system]] corresponds to a periodic orbit in a different but closely related dynamical system. As such, an open set of conditions on a bounded continuous dynamical system that rules out periodic behaviour also implies that the system cannot behave chaotically; this is the basis of some [[autonomous convergence theorem]]s.

In mathematics, the '''radical sign''' or '''radical symbol''' or '''root symbol''' is a [[Mathematical notation|symbol]] for the [[square root]] or [[Nth root|higher-order root]] of a number. The square root of a number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is written as
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x},&lt;/math&gt;
while the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th root of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is written as
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{x}.&lt;/math&gt;
It is also used for other meanings in more advanced mathematics, such as the [[radical of an ideal]].

==Principal square root==
Each positive real number has two square roots, one positive and the other negative. The square root symbol refers to the principal square root, which is the positive one. The two square roots of a negative number are both [[imaginary number]]s, and the square root symbol refers to the principal square root, the one with positive imaginary part. For the definition of the principal square root of other complex numbers, see [[Square root#Principal square root of a complex number]].

==Origin==

The origin of the root symbol √ is largely speculative.  Some sources imply that the symbol was first used by Arab mathematicians. One of those mathematicians was [[Abū al-Hasan ibn Alī al-Qalasādī]] (1421–1486). Legend has it that it was taken from the [[Arabic]] letter "{{rtl-lang|tg-Arab|ج}}" (''[[Gimel#Arabic ǧīm|ǧīm]]'', which is the first letter in the Arabic word "{{rtl-lang|tg-Arab|جذر}}" (''jadhir'', meaning "root").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002662.html |title=Language Log: ''Ab surd'' |accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many scholars,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} including [[Leonhard Euler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Institutiones calculi differentialis|author=Leonhard Euler|year=1755|language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe it originates from the letter "r", the first letter of the [[Latin]] word "[[radix]]" (meaning "root"), referring to the same [[Operation (mathematics)|mathematical operation]].

The symbol was first seen in print without the [[vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]] (the horizontal "bar" over the numbers inside the radical symbol) in the year 1525 in ''Die Coss'' by [[Christoff Rudolff]], a [[German people|German]] mathematician. In 1637 [[Renee Descartes|Descartes]] was the first to unite the German radical sign √ with the vinculum to create the radical symbol in common use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Florian|last=Cajori|title=A History of Mathematical Notations|volume=I|year=2012|origyear=1928|publisher=Dover|isbn=978-0-486-67766-8|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these characters differ in appearance from most mathematical typesetting
by omitting the [[overline]] connected to the radical symbol, which surrounds the argument of the square root function.

In [[LaTeX]] the square root symbol may be generated by the &lt;code&gt;\sqrt&lt;/code&gt; macro,
and the square root symbol without the overline may be generated by the &lt;code&gt;\surd&lt;/code&gt; macro.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7153">The '''random neural network (RNN)''' is a mathematical representation of an interconnected network of [[neuron]]s or [[Cell (biology)|cells]] which exchange [[Action potential|spiking signals]]. It was invented by [[Erol Gelenbe]] and is linked to the [[G-network]] model of queueing networks as well as to Gene Regulatory Network models. Each cell state is represented by an integer whose value rises when the cell receives an excitatory spike and drops when it receives an inhibitory spike. The spikes can originate outside the [[Neural network|network]] itself, or they can come from other cells in the networks. Cells whose internal excitatory state has a positive value are allowed to send out spikes of either kind to other cells in the network according to specific cell-dependent spiking rates. The model has a mathematical solution in steady-state which provides the [[joint probability distribution]] of the network in terms of the individual probabilities that each cell is excited and able to send out spikes. Computing this solution is based on solving a set of [[Nonlinearity|non-linear algebraic equations]] whose [[parameter]]s are related to the spiking rates of individual cells and their connectivity to other cells, as well as the arrival rates of spikes from outside the network. The RNN is a recurrent model, i.e. a neural network that is allowed to have complex feedback loops.

A highly energy-efficient implementation of random neural networks was demonstrated by [[Krishna Palem]] et al. using the Probabilistic CMOS or [[PCMOS]] technology and was shown to be c. 226–300 times more efficient in terms of Energy-Performance-Product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pubzone.org/dblp/conf/date/ChakrapaniACKPS06|title= Ultra Efficient Embedded SOC Architectures based on Probabilistic CMOS (PCMOS) Technology|author1=Lakshmi N.

Palem |author6=Balasubramanian Seshasayee |publisher=Design Automation and Test in Europe Conference (DATE), 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RNNs are also related to [[artificial neural network]]s, which (like the random neural network) have gradient-based [[Machine learning|learning algorithm]]s. The learning algorithm for an n-node random neural network that includes feedback loops (it is also a [[recurrent neural network]]) is of computational complexity O(n^3) (the number of computations is proportional to the cube of n, the number of neurons). The random neural network can also be used with other learning [[algorithm]]s such as [[reinforcement learning]]. The RNN has been shown to be a universal approximator for [[Bounded function|bounded]] and [[continuous function]]s.

'''SAMPL''', which stands for '''"Stochastic [[AMPL]]"''', is an [[algebraic modeling language]] resulting by expanding the well-known language [[AMPL]] with extended syntax and keywords. It is designed specifically for representing [[stochastic programming]] problems&lt;ref name="ExtendingAlgebraicLanguages"&gt;
{{cite journal | author=Christian Valente, Gautam Mitra, Mustapha Sadki and Robert Fourer| title=Extending algebraic modelling languages for stochastic programming| journal=INFORMS Journal on Computing| year=2009| volume=21| issue=1| pages=107–122| url=http://joc.journal.informs.org/content/21/1/107.abstract| doi=10.1287/ijoc.1080.0282}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and, through recent extensions, problems with chance constraints, integrated chance constraints and [[robust optimization]] problems. 
It can generate the deterministic equivalent version of the instances, using all the solvers AMPL connects to,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ampl.com/solvers.html&lt;/ref&gt; or generate an [[MPS (format)#extensions|SMPS]] representation and use specialized decomposition based solvers, like [[FortSP]].

== Language Features ==

SAMPL shares all language features with AMPL, and adds some constructs specifically designed for expressing scenario based [[stochastic programming]] and [[robust optimization]].

=== Stochastic programming features and constructs ===

To express scenario-based SP problems, additional constructs describe the tree structure and group the decision variable into stages. Moreover, it is possible to specify which parameter stores the probabilities for each branch of the tree and which set represents the scenario set. Other constructs to easily define chance constraints and integrated chance constraint in an SP problem are available as well.
Using these language constructs allows to retain the structure of the problem, hence making it available to the solvers, which might exploit it using specialized decomposition methods like [[Benders' decomposition]] to speed-up the solution.

=== Robust optimization constructs ===

SAMPL supports constructs to describe three types of robust optimization formulations:

== Availability ==

SAMPL is currently available as a part of the software AMPLDev (distributed by [http://www.optirisk-systems.com www.optirisk-systems.com]). It supports many popular 32- and 64-bit platforms including [[Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]]. A free evaluation version with limited functionality is available.&lt;ref&gt;http://optirisk-systems.com/products_ampldevSP.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

== A stochastic programming sample model ==

The following is the SAMPL version of a simple problem (Dakota&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Higle, Julia L, Wallace, Stein W| title=Sensitivity analysis and uncertainty in linear programming| journal=Interfaces| year=2003| volume=33| number=4| pages=53–60| publisher=INFORMS| doi=10.1287/inte.33.4.53.16370}}&lt;/ref&gt;), to show the SP related constructs. It does not include the data file, which follows the normal AMPL syntax (see the [[AMPL#example|example]] provided in the AMPL Wikipedia page for further reference).

 ''# Total final wealth, as expected total income from sales minus costs for the resources''
 maximize wealth: sum{s in Scen} P[s] * 
  (sum{p in Prod} Price[p] * amountsell[p,s] - sum{r in Resource} Cost[r] * buy[r]);

 ''# Make sure you have enough resources to produce what we intend to''

 production{p in Prod, s in Scen}: amountsell[p,s] &lt;= amountprod[p,s];
 ''# Make sure we do not sell more than the market demand''
 sales{p in Prod, s in Scen}: amountsell[p,s] &lt;= Demand[p,s];
 ''# Respect initial budget''
 budgetres: sum{r in Resource} Cost[r] * buy[r] &lt;= Budget;

== Solvers connectivity ==

SAMPL instance level format for SP problems is SMPS, and therefore the problem can be solved by any solver which supports that standard. One of such solvers (FortSP) is included in the standard SAMPL distribution. Regarding robust optimization problems, the needed solver depend on the specific formulation used, as Ben-Tal and Nemirovski formulation need a [[Second-order cone programming|second-order cone]] capable solver.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2725">In mathematical set theory, the '''Sacks property''' holds between two [[Model theory|models]] of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] if they are not "too dissimilar" in the following sense.

For &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; transitive models of set theory, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is said to have the Sacks property over &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for every function &lt;math&gt;g\in M&lt;/math&gt; mapping &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\omega\setminus\{0\}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; diverges to infinity, and every function &lt;math&gt;f\in N&lt;/math&gt; mapping &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; there is a [[Tree (set theory)|tree]] &lt;math&gt;T\in M&lt;/math&gt; such that for every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; the &lt;math&gt;n^{th}&lt;/math&gt; level of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; has cardinality at most &lt;math&gt;g(n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a branch of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The Sacks property is used to control the value of certain [[cardinal invariant]]s in [[forcing (set theory)|forcing]] arguments. It is named for [[Gerald Sacks|Gerald Enoch Sacks]].

A [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing notion]] is said to have the Sacks property if and only if the forcing extension has the Sacks property over the ground model.  Examples include [[List of forcing notions#Sacks forcing|Sacks forcing]] and [[List of forcing notions#Silver forcing|Silver forcing]].

[[Saharon Shelah|Shelah]] proved that when proper forcings with the Sacks property are [[iterated forcing|iterated]] using countable supports, the resulting forcing notion will have the Sacks property as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Schoof's algorithm''' is an efficient algorithm to count points on [[elliptic curve]]s over [[finite fields]]. The algorithm has applications in [[elliptic curve cryptography]] where it is important to know the number of points to judge the difficulty of solving the [[discrete logarithm problem]] in the [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of points on an elliptic curve.

The algorithm was published by [[René Schoof]] in 1985 and it was a theoretical breakthrough, as it was the first deterministic polynomial time algorithm for [[counting points on elliptic curves]]. Before Schoof's algorithm, approaches to counting points on elliptic curves such as the naive and [[baby-step giant-step]] algorithms were, for the most part, tedious and had an exponential running time.
 
This article explains Schoof's approach, laying emphasis on the mathematical ideas underlying the structure of the algorithm.


Let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be an [[elliptic curve]] defined over the finite field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{q}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;q=p^n&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; a prime and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; an integer &lt;math&gt;\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;. Over a field of characteristic &lt;math&gt;\neq 2, 3&lt;/math&gt; an elliptic curve can be given by a (short) Weierstrass equation
: &lt;math&gt;
y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B
&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;A,B\in \mathbb{F}_{q}&lt;/math&gt;. The set of points defined over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{q}&lt;/math&gt; consists of the solutions &lt;math&gt;(a,b)\in\mathbb{F}_{q}^2&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the curve equation and a [[point at infinity]] &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;. Using the [[Elliptic curve#The group law|group law]] on elliptic curves restricted to this set one can see that this set &lt;math&gt;E(\mathbb{F}_{q})&lt;/math&gt; forms an [[abelian group]], with &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; acting as the zero element.
In order to count points on an elliptic curve, we compute the cardinality of &lt;math&gt;E(\mathbb{F}_{q})&lt;/math&gt;.
Schoof's approach to computing the cardinality &lt;math&gt;\sharp E(\mathbb{F}_{q})&lt;/math&gt; makes use of [[Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves]] along with the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] and [[division polynomials]].

==Hasse's theorem==
{{main|Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves}}
Hasse's theorem states that if &lt;math&gt;E/\mathbb{F}_{q}&lt;/math&gt; is an elliptic curve over the finite field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{q}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\# E(\mathbb{F}_q)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies

: &lt;math&gt;
\mid q + 1 - \# E(\mathbb{F}_{q}) \mid \leq 2\sqrt{q}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This powerful result, given by Hasse in 1934, simplifies our problem by narrowing down &lt;math&gt;\# E(\mathbb{F}_{q})&lt;/math&gt; to a finite (albeit large) set of possibilities. Defining &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;q + 1 - \# E(\mathbb{F}_{q})&lt;/math&gt;, and making use of this result, we now have that computing the cardinality of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;N &gt; 4\sqrt{q}&lt;/math&gt;, is sufficient for determining &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and thus &lt;math&gt;\# E(\mathbb{F}_{q})&lt;/math&gt;. While there is no efficient way to compute &lt;math&gt;t \pmod N&lt;/math&gt; directly for general &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, it is possible to compute &lt;math&gt;t  \pmod l&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; a small prime, rather efficiently. We choose &lt;math&gt;S=\{l_1,l_2,...,l_r\}&lt;/math&gt; to be a set of distinct primes such that &lt;math&gt;\prod l_i = N &gt; 4\sqrt{q}&lt;/math&gt;. Given &lt;math&gt;t \pmod {l_i}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;l_i\in S&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] allows us to compute &lt;math&gt;t \pmod N&lt;/math&gt;.

In order to compute &lt;math&gt;t  \pmod l&lt;/math&gt; for a prime &lt;math&gt;l \neq p&lt;/math&gt;, we make use of the theory of the Frobenius endomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and [[division polynomials]]. Note that considering primes &lt;math&gt;l \neq p&lt;/math&gt; is no loss since we can always pick a bigger prime to take its place to ensure the product is big enough. In any case Schoof's algorithm is most frequently used in addressing the case &lt;math&gt;q=p&lt;/math&gt; since there are more efficient, so called &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; adic algorithms for small-characteristic fields.

==The Frobenius endomorphism==
Given the elliptic curve &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; defined over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{q}&lt;/math&gt; we consider points on &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbb{F}}_{q}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[algebraic closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{q}&lt;/math&gt;; i.e. we allow points with coordinates in &lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbb{F}}_{q}&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Frobenius endomorphism]] of &lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbb{F}}_{q}&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt; extends to the elliptic curve by &lt;math&gt; \phi : (x, y) \mapsto (x^{q}, y^{q})&lt;/math&gt;.

This map is the identity on &lt;math&gt;E(\mathbb{F}_{q})&lt;/math&gt; and one can extend it to the point at infinity &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;, making it a [[group morphism]] from &lt;math&gt;E(\bar{\mathbb{F}_{q}})&lt;/math&gt; to itself.

The Frobenius endomorphism satisfies a quadratic polynomial which is linked to the cardinality of &lt;math&gt;E(\mathbb{F}_{q})&lt;/math&gt; by the following theorem:
  
'''Theorem:''' The Frobenius endomorphism given by &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the characteristic equation

: &lt;math&gt;  \phi ^2 - t\phi + q = 0,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; t = q + 1 - \# E(\mathbb{F}_q)  &lt;/math&gt;

Thus we have for all &lt;math&gt;P=(x, y) \in E&lt;/math&gt; that &lt;math&gt;(x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}} ) + q(x, y) = t(x^{q}, y^{q})&lt;/math&gt;, where + denotes addition on the elliptic curve and &lt;math&gt;q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t(x^{q},y^{q})&lt;/math&gt;
denote scalar multiplication of &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and of &lt;math&gt;(x^{q},y^{q})&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

One could try to symbolically compute these points &lt;math&gt;(x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}})&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(x^{q}, y^{q})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; as functions in the [[Imaginary hyperelliptic curve#Coordinate ring|coordinate ring]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{q}[x,y]/(y^{2}-x^{3}-Ax-B)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;
and then search for a value of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies the equation. However, the degrees get very large and this approach is impractical.

Schoof's idea was to carry out this computation restricted to points of order &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; for various small primes &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;.
Fixing an odd prime &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, we now move on to solving the problem of determining &lt;math&gt;t_{l}&lt;/math&gt;, defined as &lt;math&gt;t  \pmod l&lt;/math&gt;, for a given prime &lt;math&gt;l \neq 2, p&lt;/math&gt;.   
If a point &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; is in the &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;-[[torsion subgroup]] &lt;math&gt;E[l]=\{P\in E(\bar{\mathbb{F}_{q}}) \mid lP=O \}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;qP = \bar{q}P&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\bar{q}&lt;/math&gt; is the unique integer such that  &lt;math&gt;q \equiv \bar{q}  \pmod l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mid \bar{q} \mid&lt; l/2&lt;/math&gt;.  
Note that &lt;math&gt;\phi(O) = O&lt;/math&gt; and that for any integer &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;r\phi (P) = \phi (rP)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;\phi (P)&lt;/math&gt; will have the same order as &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. Thus for &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; belonging to &lt;math&gt;E[l]&lt;/math&gt;, we also have &lt;math&gt;t(x^{q}, y^{q})= \bar{t}(x^{q}, y^{q})&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;t \equiv \bar{t}  \pmod l&lt;/math&gt;. Hence we have reduced our problem to solving the equation

: &lt;math&gt;  (x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}}) + \bar{q}(x, y) \equiv \bar{t}(x^{q}, y^{q}),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{q}&lt;/math&gt; have integer values in &lt;math&gt;[-(l-1)/2,(l-1)/2]&lt;/math&gt;.

==Computation modulo primes==
The {{mvar|l}}th [[division polynomial]] is such that its roots are precisely the {{mvar|x}} coordinates of points of order {{mvar|l}}. Thus, to restrict the computation of &lt;math&gt;(x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}}) + \bar{q}(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; to the {{mvar|l}}-torsion points means computing these expressions as functions in the coordinate ring of {{mvar|E}} ''and'' modulo the {{mvar|l}}th division polynomial. I.e. we are working in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{q}[x,y]/(y^{2}-x^{3}-Ax-B, \psi_{l})&lt;/math&gt;. This means in particular that the degree of {{mvar|X}} and  {{mvar|Y}} defined via &lt;math&gt;(X(x,y),Y(x,y)):=(x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}}) + \bar{q}(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; is at most 1 in {{mvar|y}} and at most &lt;math&gt;(l^2-3)/2&lt;/math&gt;
in {{mvar|x}}.

The scalar multiplication &lt;math&gt;\bar{q}(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; can be done either by [[exponentiation by squaring|double-and-add]] methods or by using the &lt;math&gt;\bar{q}&lt;/math&gt;th division polynomial. The latter approach gives:

: &lt;math&gt; 
\bar{q} (x,y) = (x_{\bar{q}},y_{\bar{q}}) = \left( x - \frac {\psi_{\bar{q}-1} \psi_{\bar{q}+1}}{\psi^{2}_{\bar{q}}}, \frac{\psi_{2\bar{q}}}{2\psi^{4}_{\bar{q}}} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\psi_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is the {{mvar|n}}th division polynomial. Note that   
&lt;math&gt;y_{\bar{q}}/y&lt;/math&gt; is a function in {{mvar|x}} only and denote it by &lt;math&gt;\theta(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

We must split the problem into two cases: the case in which &lt;math&gt;(x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}}) \neq \pm \bar{q}(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;, and the case in which  &lt;math&gt;(x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}}) = \pm \bar{q}(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that these equalities are checked modulo &lt;math&gt;\psi_l&lt;/math&gt;.

===Case 1: &lt;math&gt;(x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}}) \neq \pm \bar{q}(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;===
By using the [[Elliptic curves#The group law|addition formula]] for the group &lt;math&gt;E(\mathbb{F}_{q})&lt;/math&gt; we obtain:

: &lt;math&gt;
X(x,y) = \left( \frac{y^{q^{2}} - y_{\bar{q}}}{x^{q^{2}} - x_{\bar{q}}} \right) ^{2} - x^{q^{2}} - x_{\bar{q}}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Note that this computation fails in case the assumption of inequality was wrong.

We are now able to use the {{mvar|x}}-coordinate to narrow down the choice of &lt;math&gt;\bar{t}&lt;/math&gt; to two possibilities, namely the positive and negative case. Using the {{mvar|y}}-coordinate one later determines which of the two cases holds.

We first show that {{mvar|X}} is a function in {{mvar|x}} alone. Consider &lt;math&gt;(y^{q^{2}} - y_{\bar{q}})^{2}=y^{2}(y^{q^{2}-1}-y_{\bar{q}}/y)^{2}&lt;/math&gt;.
Since &lt;math&gt;q^{2}-1&lt;/math&gt; is even, by replacing &lt;math&gt;y^{2}&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x^3+Ax+B&lt;/math&gt;, we rewrite the expression as

: &lt;math&gt;
(x^3+Ax+B)((x^3+Ax+B)^{\frac{q^{2}-1}{2}}-\theta(x))
&lt;/math&gt;

and have that

: &lt;math&gt;
X(x)\equiv (x^3+Ax+B)((x^3+Ax+B)^{\frac{q^{2}-1}{2}}-\theta(x))\bmod \psi_l(x).
&lt;/math&gt;
 
Here, it seems not right, we throw away &lt;math&gt;x^{q^{2}}-x_{\bar{q}}&lt;/math&gt;?

Now if &lt;math&gt;X \equiv x^{q} _ {\bar{t}}\bmod \psi_l(x)&lt;/math&gt; for one &lt;math&gt;\bar{t}\in [0,(l-1)/2]&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\bar{t}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies

: &lt;math&gt;
\phi ^{2}(P) \mp \bar{t} \phi(P) + \bar{q}P = O
&lt;/math&gt;

for all {{mvar|l}}-torsion points {{mvar|P}}.

As mentioned earlier, using {{mvar|Y}} and &lt;math&gt;y_{\bar{t}}^{q}&lt;/math&gt; we are now able to determine which of the two values of &lt;math&gt;\bar{t}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\bar{t}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-\bar{t}&lt;/math&gt;) works.  This gives the value of &lt;math&gt;t\equiv \bar{t}\pmod l&lt;/math&gt;. Schoof's algorithm stores the values of &lt;math&gt;\bar{t}\pmod l&lt;/math&gt; in a variable &lt;math&gt;t_l&lt;/math&gt; for each prime {{mvar|l}} considered.

===Case 2: &lt;math&gt;(x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}}) = \pm \bar{q}(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;===
We begin with the assumption that &lt;math&gt;(x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}}) = \bar{q}(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;. Since {{mvar|l}} is an odd prime it cannot be that &lt;math&gt;\bar{q}(x, y)=-\bar{q}(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt;\bar{t}\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. The characteristic equation yields that &lt;math&gt;\bar{t} \phi(P) = 2\bar{q} P&lt;/math&gt;. And consequently that &lt;math&gt;\bar{t}^{2}\bar{q} \equiv (2q)^{2}  \pmod l&lt;/math&gt;.  
This implies that {{mvar|q}} is a square modulo {{mvar|l}}. Let &lt;math&gt;q \equiv w^{2}  \pmod l&lt;/math&gt;. Compute &lt;math&gt;w\phi(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{q}[x,y]/(y^{2}-x^{3}-Ax-B, \psi_{l})&lt;/math&gt; and check whether &lt;math&gt;
\bar{q}(x, y)=w\phi(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;. If so, &lt;math&gt;t_{l}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\pm 2w \pmod l&lt;/math&gt; depending on the y-coordinate.  
 
If {{mvar|q}} turns out not to be a square modulo {{mvar|l}} or if the equation does not hold for any of {{mvar|w}} and &lt;math&gt;-w&lt;/math&gt;, our assumption that &lt;math&gt;(x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}}) = +\bar{q}(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; is false, thus &lt;math&gt;(x^{q^{2}}, y^{q^{2}}) = - \bar{q}(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;. The characteristic equation gives &lt;math&gt;t_l=0&lt;/math&gt;.

===Additional case &lt;math&gt;l = 2&lt;/math&gt;===
If you recall, our initial considerations omit the case of &lt;math&gt;l = 2&lt;/math&gt;. 
Since we assume {{mvar|q}} to be odd, &lt;math&gt;q + 1 - t  \equiv  t \pmod  2&lt;/math&gt; and in particular, &lt;math&gt;t_{2} \equiv 0  \pmod 2&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;E(\mathbb{F}_{q})&lt;/math&gt; has an element of order 2. By definition of addition in the group, any element of order 2 must be of the form &lt;math&gt;(x_{0}, 0)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;t_{2} \equiv 0  \pmod 2&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^{3} + Ax + B&lt;/math&gt; has a root in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{q}&lt;/math&gt;, if and only if &lt;math&gt;\gcd(x^{q}-x, x^{3} + Ax + B)\neq 1&lt;/math&gt;.

     Output &lt;math&gt;q+1-t&lt;/math&gt;.

==Complexity==
Most of the computation is taken by the evaluation of &lt;math&gt;\phi(P)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi^{2}(P)&lt;/math&gt;, for each prime &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, that is computing &lt;math&gt;x^q&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y^q&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x^{q^2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y^{q^2}&lt;/math&gt; for each prime &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;. This involves exponentiation in the ring &lt;math&gt;R = \mathbb{F}_{q}[x, y]/ (y^2-x^3-Ax-B, \psi_l)&lt;/math&gt; and requires &lt;math&gt;O(\log q)&lt;/math&gt; multiplications. Since the degree of &lt;math&gt;\psi_l&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\frac{l^2-1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, each element in the ring is a polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;O(l^2)&lt;/math&gt;. By the [[prime number theorem]], there are around &lt;math&gt;O(\log q)&lt;/math&gt; primes of size &lt;math&gt;O(\log q)&lt;/math&gt;, giving that &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;O(\log q)&lt;/math&gt; and we obtain that &lt;math&gt;O(l^2) = O(\log^2q)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus each multiplication in the ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; requires &lt;math&gt;O(\log^4 q)&lt;/math&gt; multiplications in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{q}&lt;/math&gt; which in turn requires &lt;math&gt;O(\log^2 q)&lt;/math&gt; bit operations. In total, the number of bit operations for each prime &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;O(\log^7 q)&lt;/math&gt;. Given that this computation needs to be carried out for each of the &lt;math&gt;O(\log q)&lt;/math&gt; primes, the total complexity of Schoof's algorithm turns out to be &lt;math&gt;O(\log^8 q)&lt;/math&gt;. Using fast polynomial and integer arithmetic reduces this to &lt;math&gt;\tilde{O}(\log^5 q)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Improvements to Schoof's algorithm==

{{main|Schoof–Elkies–Atkin algorithm}}

In the 1990s, [[Noam Elkies]], followed by [[A. O. L. Atkin]], devised improvements to Schoof's basic algorithm by restricting the set of primes &lt;math&gt;S =  \{l_1, \ldots, l_s\}&lt;/math&gt; considered before to primes of a certain kind. These came to be called Elkies primes and Atkin primes respectively. A prime &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is called an Elkies prime if the characteristic equation: &lt;math&gt;\phi^2-t\phi+ q = 0&lt;/math&gt; splits over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_l&lt;/math&gt;, while an Atkin prime is a prime that is not an Elkies prime. Atkin showed how to combine information obtained from the Atkin primes with the information obtained from Elkies primes to produce an efficient algorithm, which came to be known as the [[Schoof–Elkies–Atkin algorithm]]. The first problem to address is to determine whether a given prime is Elkies or Atkin. In order to do so, we make use of modular polynomials, which come from the study of [[modular forms]] and an interpretation of [[Elliptic curve#Elliptic curves over the complex numbers|elliptic curves over the complex numbers]] as lattices. Once we have determined which case we are in, instead of using [[division polynomials]], we are able to work with a polynomial that has lower degree than the corresponding division polynomial: &lt;math&gt;O(l)&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;O(l^2)&lt;/math&gt;.  For efficient implementation, probabilistic root-finding algorithms are used, which makes this a [[Las Vegas algorithm]] rather than a deterministic algorithm.
Under the heuristic assumption that approximately half of the primes up to an &lt;math&gt;O(\log q)&lt;/math&gt; bound are Elkies primes, this yields an algorithm that is more efficient than Schoof's, with an expected running time of &lt;math&gt;O(\log^6 q)&lt;/math&gt; using naive arithmetic, and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{O}(\log^4 q)&lt;/math&gt; using fast arithmetic.  Although this heuristic assumption is known to hold for most elliptic curves, it is not known to hold in every case, even under the [[Generalized Riemann Hypothesis|GRH]].

'''Self-organization''', also called (in the [[social science]]s) [[spontaneous order]], is a process where some form of overall [[order and disorder|order]] arises from local interactions between parts of an initially disordered [[system]]. The process is spontaneous, not needing control by any external agent. It is often triggered by random [[Statistical fluctuations| fluctuations]], amplified by [[positive feedback]]. The resulting organization is wholly decentralized, [[:wikt:distribute|distributed]] over all the components of the system. As such, the organization is typically [[robust (disambiguation) |robust]] and able to survive or self-repair substantial perturbation. [[Chaos theory]] discusses self-organization in terms of islands of [[predictability]] in a sea of chaotic unpredictability.

Self-organization occurs in many [[physics|physical]], [[chemistry|chemical]], [[biology|biological]], [[robotics|robotic]], and [[cognitive]] systems. Examples of self-organization include [[crystallization]], thermal [[convection]] of fluids, [[chemical oscillator|chemical oscillation]], animal [[swarming]], [[neural circuit]]s, and [[artificial neural network]]s.

== Overview ==
Self-organization is realized&lt;ref name="G&amp;P 1971"&gt;Glansdorff, P., Prigogine, I. (1971). ''Thermodynamic Theory of Structure, Stability and Fluctuations'', Wiley-Interscience, London. {{ISBN|0-471-30280-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Extremal principles in non-equilibrium thermodynamics|physics of non-equilibrium processes]], and in [[chemical reaction]]s, where it is often described as [[self-assembly]]. The concept has proven useful in biology,&lt;ref name=Witzany&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Witzany | first1 = G | year = 2014 | title = Biological Self-Organization | url = | journal = International Journal of Signs and Semiotic Systems | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 1–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from molecular to ecosystem level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Compare: {{cite book| last1=Camazine| first1=Scott| title=Self-organization in Biological Systems| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMgyNN6Ufj0C| series=Princeton studies in complexity| edition=reprint| publisher=Princeton University Press| publication-date=2003| isbn=9780691116242| access-date=2016-04-05| year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cited examples of self-organizing behaviour also appear in the literature of many other disciplines, both in the [[natural sciences]] and in the [[social sciences]] such as [[economics]] or [[anthropology]]. Self-organization has also been observed in mathematical systems such as [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Ilachinski| first1=Andrew| title=Cellular Automata: A Discrete Universe| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Hx2lx_pEF8C| publisher=World Scientific| publication-date=2001| page=247| isbn=9789812381835| quote=We have already seen ample evidence for what is arguably the single most impressive general property of CA, namely their capacity for self-organization| year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-organization is not to be confused with the related concept of [[emergence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Feltz, Bernard et al |date=2006 |title=Self-organization and Emergence in Life Sciences |isbn=978-1-402-03916-4 |publisher= |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-organization relies on three basic ingredients:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bonabeau, Eric; Dorigo, Marco and Theraulaz, Guy |date=1999 |title=Swarm intelligence: from natural to artificial systems |isbn=0195131592 |publisher= |pages=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# strong dynamical non-linearity, often though not necessarily involving [[Positive feedback|positive]] and [[negative feedback]]
# balance of exploitation and exploration
# multiple [[interaction]]s

==Principles==
The cybernetician [[William Ross Ashby]] formulated the original principle of self-organization in 1947.&lt;ref name="ashby1947"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/00221309.1947.9918144| pmid=20270223| title=Principles of the Self-Organizing Dynamic System| journal=The Journal of General Psychology| volume=37| issue=2| pages=125–28| year=1947| last1=Ashby | first1=W. R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashby, W. R. (1962). [http://csis.pace.edu/~marchese/CS396x/Computing/Ashby.pdf "Principles of the self-organizing system"], pp. 255–78 in ''Principles of Self-Organization''. [[Heinz von Foerster]] and George W. Zopf, Jr. (eds.) U.S. Office of Naval Research.&lt;/ref&gt; It states that any deterministic [[dynamic system]] automatically evolves towards a state of equilibrium that can be described in terms of an [[attractor]] in a [[Attractor|basin]] of surrounding states. Once there, the further evolution of the system is constrained to remain in the attractor. This constraint implies a form of mutual dependency or coordination between its constituent components or subsystems. In Ashby's terms, each subsystem has adapted to the environment formed by all other subsystems.&lt;ref name=ashby1947/&gt;

The cybernetician [[Heinz von Foerster]] formulated the principle of "[[order and disorder|order]] from [[noise (signal processing)|noise]]" in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Von Foerster, H. (1960). [http://e1020.pbworks.com/f/fulltext.pdf "On self-organizing systems and their environments"], pp. 31–50 in ''Self-organizing systems''. M.C. Yovits and S. Cameron (eds.), Pergamon Press, London&lt;/ref&gt; It notes that self-organization is facilitated by random perturbations ("noise") that let the system explore a variety of states in its state space. This increases the chance that the system will arrive into the basin of a "strong" or "deep" attractor, from which it then quickly enters the attractor itself. The biophysicist [[Henri Atlan]] developed this concept by proposing the principle of "[[complexity]] from noise"&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Henri+Atlan%22%22complexity+from+noise%22 occurrences] on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=François |editor-first=Charles |editor-link=Charles François (systems scientist) |title=[[International Encyclopedia of Systems and Cybernetics]] |year=2011 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SZxnQgAACAAJ 1997] |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]] |location=[[Berlin]] |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=XCn2mn98uEAC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=%22complexity+from+noise+principle%22+Atlan+1972 107] |isbn=3-1109-6801-0 |id={{ISBN|978-3-110-96801-9}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-fr|le principe de complexité par le bruit}})&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.google.com/search?&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22Henri+Atlan%22%22complexité+par+le+bruit%22 occurrences] on Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; first in the 1972 book ''L'organisation biologique et la théorie de l'information''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22complexité+par+le+bruit%22%22L'Organisation+biologique+et+la+théorie+de+l'information%22+1972].&lt;/ref&gt; and then in the 1979 book ''Entre le cristal et la fumée''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22complexité+par+le+bruit%22%22Entre+le+cristal+et+la+fumée%22+1979].&lt;/ref&gt; The thermodynamicist [[Ilya Prigogine]] formulated a similar principle as "order through fluctuations"&lt;ref&gt;Nicolis, G. and Prigogine, I.

==History==
{{further|Spontaneous order}}

The idea that the [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of a system can lead to an increase in its organization has a long history. The ancient [[atomism|atomists]] such as [[Democritus]] and [[Lucretius]] believed that a designing intelligence is unnecessary to create order in nature, arguing that given enough time and space and matter, order emerges by itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 =Palmer |first1= Ada |author-link1= Ada Palmer |title= Reading Lucretius in the Renaissance |date= October 2014|publisher= Harvard University Press |isbn= 978-0-674-72557-7|quote= Ada Palmer explores how Renaissance readers, such as Machiavelli, Pomponio Leto, and Montaigne, actually ingested and disseminated Lucretius, ... and shows how ideas of emergent order and natural selection, so critical to our current thinking, became embedded in Europe’s intellectual landscape before the seventeenth century. |url= http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674725577&lt;!--url for quote--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[René Descartes]] presents self-organization hypothetically in the fifth part of his 1637 ''[[Discourse on Method]]''. He elaborated on the idea in his unpublished work ''[[The World (Descartes)|The World]]''.{{efn|For related history, see Aram Vartanian, ''Diderot and Descartes''.}}

[[Immanuel Kant]] used the term "self-organizing" in his 1790 ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'', where he argued that [[teleology]] is a meaningful concept only if there exists such an entity whose parts or "organs" are simultaneously ends and means. Such a system of organs must be able to behave as if it has a mind of its own, that is, it is capable of governing itself.&lt;ref name=Kant&gt;{{cite book|title= German Aesthetic|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eC88AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA64|publisher= CUP Archive|pages= 64–|id= GGKEY:TFTHBB91ZH2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In such a natural product as this every part is thought as ''owing'' its presence to the agency of all the remaining parts, and also as existing ''for the sake of the others'' and of the whole, that is as an instrument, or organ... The part must be an organ ''producing'' the other parts—each, consequently, reciprocally producing the others... Only under these conditions and upon these terms can such a product be an ''organized'' and ''self-organized'' being, and, as such, be called a ''physical end''.&lt;ref name=Kant/&gt;}}

[[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] (1796-1832) and [[Rudolf Clausius]] (1822-1888) discovered the [[second law of thermodynamics]] in the 19th century. It states that total [[entropy]], sometimes understood as disorder, will always increase over time in an [[isolated system]]. This means that a system cannot spontaneously increase its order without an external relationship that decreases order elsewhere in the system (e.g. through consuming the low-entropy energy of a battery and diffusing high-entropy heat).&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Carnot, S.]] (1824/1986).

18th-century thinkers had sought to understand the "universal laws of form" to explain the observed forms of living organisms. This idea became associated with [[Lamarckism]] and fell into disrepute until the early 20th century, when [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] (1860-1948) attempted to revive it.&lt;ref name=Ruse&gt;{{cite book |author1= Ruse, Michael |editor1-last= Henning |editor1-first= Brian G. |editor2-last= Scarfe |editor2-first= Adam |title= Beyond Mechanism: Putting Life Back Into Biology |date= 2013 |publisher= Lexington Books |page= 419 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3VtosxAtq-EC|chapter= 17. From Organicism to Mechanism-and Halfway Back?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychiatrist and engineer [[William Ross Ashby|W. Ross Ashby]] introduced the term "self-organizing" to contemporary science in 1947.&lt;ref name=ashby1947/&gt; It was taken up by the cyberneticians [[Heinz von Foerster]], [[Gordon Pask]], [[Anthony Stafford Beer|Stafford Beer]]; and von Foerster organized a conference on "The Principles of Self-Organization" at the University of Illinois' Allerton Park in June, 1960 which led to a series of conferences on Self-Organizing Systems.&lt;ref&gt;Asaro, P. (2007). [http://peterasaro.org/writing/Asaro%20HVF%26BCL.pdf "Heinz von Foerster and the Bio-Computing Movements of the 1960s"] in Albert Müller and [[Karl H. Müller]] (eds.) ''An Unfinished Revolution? Heinz von Foerster and the Biological Computer Laboratory'' BCL 1958–1976. Vienna, Austria: Edition Echoraum.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norbert Wiener]] took up the idea in the second edition of his ''Cybernetics: or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine'' (1961).

Self-organization was associated{{by whom?|date=May 2018}} with [[systems theory|general systems theory]] in the 1960s, but did not become commonplace in the scientific literature until physicists [[Synergetics (Haken)|Hermann Haken]] et al. and [[complex system]]s researchers adopted it in a greater picture from cosmology [[Erich Jantsch#The Self-Organizing Universe, 1979|Erich Jantsch]],{{huh?|date=May 2018}} chemistry with [[dissipative system]], biology and sociology as [[autopoiesis]] to [[system thinking]] in the following 1980s ([[Santa Fe Institute]]) and 1990s ([[complex adaptive system]]), until our days with the disruptive [[emerging technologies]] profounded by a [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizomatic]] [[network theory]].&lt;ref&gt;
As an indication of the increasing importance of this concept, when queried with the keyword &lt;tt&gt;self-organ*&lt;/tt&gt;, ''Dissertation Abstracts'' finds nothing before 1954, and only four entries before 1970. There were 17 in the years 1971–1980; 126 in 1981–1990; and 593 in 1991–2000.

The mathematical biologist [[Stuart Kauffman]] and other [[Structuralism (biology)|structuralists]] have suggested that self-organization may play roles alongside [[natural selection]] in three areas of [[evolutionary biology]], namely [[population dynamics]], [[molecular evolution]], and [[morphogenesis]].

===Computer science===

Phenomena from [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] such as [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]], [[random graph]]s, and some instances of [[evolutionary computation]] and [[artificial life]] exhibit features of self-organization. In [[swarm robotics]], self-organization is used to produce emergent behavior. In particular the theory of random graphs has been used as a justification for self-organization as a general principle of complex systems. In the field of [[multi-agent systems]], understanding how to engineer systems that are capable of presenting self-organized behavior is an active research area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Serugendo |first1=Giovanna Di Marzo et al |title=Self-organization in multi-agent systems |journal=Knowledge Engineering Review|date=June 2005|volume=20|issue=2|pages=165–89|doi=10.1017/S0269888905000494}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Optimization algorithm]]s can be considered self-organizing because they aim to find the optimal solution to a problem.

===Cybernetics===
{{main article|Self-organization in cybernetics}}

[[Norbert Wiener]] regarded the automatic serial [[System identification|identification]] of a [[black box]] and its subsequent reproduction as self-organization in [[cybernetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, Norbert (1962) "The mathematics of self-organising systems". ''Recent developments in information and decision processes'', Macmillan, N. Y. and Chapter X in ''Cybernetics, or control and communication in the animal and the machine'', The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of [[phase locking]] or the "attraction of frequencies", as he called it, is discussed&lt;!--yeah, but why are we mentioning it here?--&gt; in the 2nd edition of his ''[[Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Cybernetics, or control and communication in the animal and the machine'', The MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts and Wiley, NY, 1948. 2nd Edition 1962 "Chapter X "Brain Waves and Self-Organizing Systems" pp. 201–02.&lt;/ref&gt; [[K. Eric Drexler]] sees [[Molecular assembler|self-replication]] as a key step in nano and [[Universal assembler|universal assembly]]. By contrast, the four concurrently connected galvanometers of [[W. Ross Ashby]]'s [[Homeostat]] [[Hunting oscillation|hunt]], when perturbed, to converge on one of many possible stable states.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Ross Ashby|Ashby, William Ross]] (1952) ''Design for a Brain'', Chapter 5 Chapman &amp; Hall&lt;/ref&gt; Ashby used his state counting measure of [[variety (cybernetics)|variety]]&lt;ref&gt;Ashby, William Ross (1956) [http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/books/introcyb.pdf ''An Introduction to Cybernetics''], Part Two Chapman &amp; Hall&lt;/ref&gt; to describe stable states and produced the "[[Good Regulator]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system |author=Conant, R. C.|author2=Ashby, W. R. |journal=Int. J.

[[Warren McCulloch]] proposed "Redundancy of Potential Command"&lt;ref&gt;''Embodiments of Mind'' MIT Press (1965)"&lt;/ref&gt; as characteristic of the organization of the brain and human nervous system and the necessary condition for self-organization. [[Heinz von Foerster]] proposed Redundancy, ''R''=1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''H''/''H''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''H'' is [[entropy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=von Foerster, Heinz |author2= Pask, Gordon |title=A Predictive Model for Self-Organizing Systems, Part I|journal=Cybernetica|volume= 3|pages= 258–300|year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=von Foerster, Heinz |author2= Pask, Gordon |title=A Predictive Model for Self-Organizing Systems, Part II|journal=Cybernetica|volume= 4 |pages=20–55|year= 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence this states that unused potential communication bandwidth is a measure of self-organization.

In the 1970s [[Stafford Beer]] considered self-organization necessary for [[autonomy]] in persisting and living systems. He applied his [[viable system model]] to management. It consists of five parts: the monitoring of performance of the survival processes (1), their management by recursive application of regulation (2), [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] operational control (3) and development (4) which produce maintenance of identity (5) under environmental perturbation. Focus is prioritized by an alerting "algedonic loop" feedback: a sensitivity to both pain and pleasure produced from under-performance or over-performance relative to a standard capability.&lt;ref&gt;"Brain of the Firm" Alan Lane (1972); see also Viable System Model in "Beyond Dispute", and Stafford Beer (1994) "Redundancy of Potential Command" pp. 157–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s [[Gordon Pask]] argued that von Foerster's H and Hmax were not independent, but [[Gordon Pask#Interactions of Actors Theory|interacted]] via [[Countable set|countably infinite]] recursive concurrent [[spin (physics)|spin]] processes&lt;ref name=p1996/&gt; which he called concepts. His strict definition of concept "a procedure to bring about a relation"&lt;ref name=p1973/&gt; permitted his theorem "Like concepts repel, unlike concepts attract"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1108/03684920110391913| title=On Gordon Pask| journal=Kybernetes| volume=30| issue=5/6| pages=673–82| year=2001| last1=Green | first1=N. }}&lt;/ref&gt; to state a general spin-based principle of self-organization. His edict, an exclusion principle, "There are [[Gordon Pask#No Doppelgangers|No Doppelgangers]]" means no two concepts can be the same. After sufficient time, all concepts attract and coalesce as [[pink noise]]. The theory applies to all organizationally [[Closure (topology)|closed]] or homeostatic processes that produce [[Endurantism|enduring]] and [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] products which evolve, learn and adapt.&lt;ref&gt;Pask, Gordon (1993) [http://www.cybsoc.org/PasksIAT.PDF ''Interactions of Actors (IA), Theory and Some Applications''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="p1996"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pask, Gordon |year=1996 |url=http://www.cybsoc.org/GPprog.PDF |title=Heinz von Foerster's Self-Organisation, the Progenitor of Conversation and Interaction Theories |journal= Systems Research |volume=13|issue= 3 |pages=349–62 |doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-1735(199609)13:3&lt;349::aid-sres103&gt;3.3.co;2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Pask's Interactions of Actors "hard carapace" model is reflected in some of the ideas of [[emergence]] and [[Coherence (physics)|coherence]]. It requires a [[knot theory|knot]] [[Emergence#Mathematics|emergence topology]] that produces radiation during interaction with a [[unit cell]] that has a prismatic [[tensegrity]] structure. [[Robert B. Laughlin|Laughlin]]'s [[Emergence#CITEREFLaughlin2005|contribution]] to emergence reflects some of these constraints.--&gt;

===Human society===
[[File:CIA Map of International illegal drug connections.gif|thumb|right|Social self-organization in international drug routes]]
{{main|Spontaneous order}}

The self-organizing behaviour of social animals and the self-organization of simple mathematical structures both suggest that self-organization should be expected in human [[society]]. Tell-tale signs of self-organization are usually statistical properties shared with self-organizing physical systems. Examples such as [[Critical mass (sociodynamics)|critical mass]], [[herd behaviour]], [[groupthink]] and others, abound in [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[behavioral finance]] and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://cmol.nbi.dk/models/ Interactive models for self organization and biological systems]'' Center for Models of Life, Niels Bohr Institute, Denmark&lt;/ref&gt;

In social theory, the concept of self-referentiality has been introduced as a sociological application of self-organization theory by [[Niklas Luhmann]] (1984). For Luhmann the elements of a social system are self-producing communications, i.e. a communication produces further communications and hence a social system can reproduce itself as long as there is dynamic communication. For Luhmann human beings are sensors in the environment of the system. Luhmann developed an evolutionary theory of Society and its subsystems, using functional ''analyses'' and systems ''theory''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann, Niklas]] (1995) ''Social Systems''. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0804726256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In economics, a [[market economy]] is sometimes said to be self-organizing. [[Paul Krugman]] has written on the role that market self-organization plays in the business cycle in his book "The Self Organizing Economy".&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, P. (1995) ''The Self Organizing Economy''. Blackwell Publishers. {{ISBN|1557866996}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Hayek]] coined the term ''[[catallaxy]]''&lt;ref&gt;Hayek, F. (1976) ''Law, Legislation and Liberty, Volume 2: The Mirage of Social Justice''. University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe a "self-organizing system of voluntary co-operation", in regards to the spontaneous order of the free market economy. Neo-classical economists hold that imposing [[central planning]] usually makes the self-organized economic system less efficient. On the other end of the spectrum, economists consider that [[market failure]]s are so significant that self-organization produces bad results and that the state should direct production and pricing. Most economists adopt an intermediate position and recommend a mixture of market economy and [[command economy]] characteristics (sometimes called a [[mixed economy]]). When applied to economics, the concept of self-organization can quickly become ideologically imbued.&lt;ref name="Biel2009"&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Biel, R. |author2=Mu-Jeong Kho |url=http://rechercheregulation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/rr_working_serieid_2009-1.pdf |title=The Issue of Energy within a Dialectical Approach to the Regulationist Problematique |journal=Recherches &amp; Régulation Working Papers, RR Série ID 2009-1 |pages=1–21 |publisher=Association Recherche &amp; Régulation |date=November 2009 |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Marshall (New Zealand author)|Marshall, A.]] (2002) ''The Unity of Nature'', Chapter 5.

===Traffic flow===
{{main article|Three-phase traffic theory}}

The self-organizing behavior of drivers in [[traffic flow]] determines almost all the spatiotemporal behavior of traffic, such as traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck, highway capacity, and the emergence of moving traffic jams. In 1996–2002 these complex self-organizing effects were explained by [[Boris Kerner]]'s [[three-phase traffic theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kerner | first1 = Boris S. | year = 1998 | title = Experimental Features of Self-Organization in Traffic Flow | url = | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 81 | issue = | pages = 3797–3800| doi=10.1103/physrevlett.81.3797 | bibcode=1998PhRvL..81.3797K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Heinz Pagels]], in a 1985 review of [[Ilya Prigogine]] and [[Isabelle Stengers]]'s book ''Order Out of Chaos'' in ''[[Physics Today]]'', appeals to authority:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.fefox.com/ARTICLES/Pagels-PrigogineinPhysicsToday1985.pdf|author=Pagels, H. R. |title=Is the irreversibility we see a fundamental property of nature?|journal=Physics Today|date=January 1, 1985|pages=97–99|doi=10.1063/1.2813716|bibcode=1985PhT....38a..97P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Most scientists would agree with the critical view expressed in ''Problems of Biological Physics'' (Springer Verlag, 1981) by the biophysicist L. A. Blumenfeld, when he wrote: "The meaningful macroscopic ordering of biological structure does not arise due to the increase of certain parameters or a system above their critical values. These structures are built according to program-like complicated architectural structures, the meaningful information created during many billions of years of chemical and biological evolution being used." Life is a consequence of microscopic, not macroscopic, organization.}}

{{quote|In short, they [Prigogine and Stengers] maintain that [[arrow of time|time irreversibility]] is not derived from a time-independent microworld, but is itself fundamental. The virtue of their idea is that it resolves what they perceive as a "clash of doctrines" about the nature of [[time in physics]]. Most physicists would agree that there is neither empirical evidence to support their view, nor is there a mathematical necessity for it. There is no "clash of doctrines." Only Prigogine and a few colleagues hold to these speculations which, in spite of their efforts, continue to live in the twilight zone of scientific credibility.}}

In [[theology]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274) in his ''Summa Theologica'' assumes a teleological created universe in rejecting the idea that something can be a self-sufficient cause of its own organization:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3 Article 3. Whether God exists?] newadvent.org&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Since nature works for a determinate end under the direction of a higher agent, whatever is done by nature must needs be traced back to God, as to its first cause. So also whatever is done voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than human reason or will, since these can change or fail; for all things that are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an immovable and self-necessary first principle, as was shown in the body of the Article.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2305">In [[order theory|order-theoretic mathematics]], a [[graded poset|graded]] [[partially ordered set]] is said to have the '''Sperner property''' (and hence is called a '''Sperner poset'''), if no [[antichain]] within it is larger than the largest rank level (one of the sets of elements of the same rank) in the poset.&lt;ref name=stanley&gt;{{citation

A '''''k''-Sperner poset''' is a graded poset in  which no union of ''k'' antichains is larger than the union of the ''k'' largest rank levels,&lt;ref name=stanley/&gt; or, equivalently, the poset has a maximum [[k-family]] consisting of ''k'' rank levels.&lt;ref name=rosen/&gt; 

A '''strict Sperner poset''' is a graded poset in which all maximum antichains are rank levels.&lt;ref name=rosen/&gt;

A '''strongly Sperner poset''' is a graded poset which is ''k-Sperner'' for all values of 'k'' up to the largest rank value.&lt;ref name=rosen/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10619">In [[mathematics]], the '''Stiefel manifold''' &lt;math&gt;V_k(\R^n)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all [[orthonormal]] [[k-frame|''k''-frames]] in &lt;math&gt;\R^n.&lt;/math&gt; That is, it is the set of ordered ''k''-tuples of orthonormal [[vector (mathematics)|vectors]] in &lt;math&gt;\R^n.&lt;/math&gt; It is named after Swiss mathematician [[Eduard Stiefel]]. Likewise one can define the [[complex number|complex]] Stiefel manifold &lt;math&gt;V_k(\C^n)&lt;/math&gt; of orthonormal ''k''-frames in &lt;math&gt;\C^n&lt;/math&gt; and the [[quaternion]]ic Stiefel manifold &lt;math&gt;V_k(\H^n)&lt;/math&gt; of orthonormal ''k''-frames in &lt;math&gt;\H^n&lt;/math&gt; More generally, the construction applies to any real, complex, or quaternionic [[inner product space]].

In some contexts, a non-[[compact space|compact]] Stiefel manifold is defined as the set of all [[linearly independent]] ''k''-frames in &lt;math&gt;\R^n, \C^n,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\H^n;&lt;/math&gt; this is homotopy equivalent, as the compact Stiefel manifold is a [[deformation retract]] of the non-compact one, by [[Gram–Schmidt process|Gram–Schmidt]]. Statements about the non-compact form correspond to those for the compact form, replacing the orthogonal group (or unitary or symplectic group) with the [[general linear group]].

==Topology==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}&lt;/math&gt; stand for &lt;math&gt;\R,\C,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\H.&lt;/math&gt; The Stiefel manifold &lt;math&gt;V_k(\mathbb F^n)&lt;/math&gt; can be thought of as a set of ''n'' &amp;times; ''k'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] by writing a ''k''-frame as a matrix of ''k'' [[column vector]]s in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F^n.&lt;/math&gt; The orthonormality condition is expressed by ''A''*''A'' = &lt;math&gt;I_k&lt;/math&gt; where ''A''* denotes the [[conjugate transpose]] of ''A'' and &lt;math&gt; I_k&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ''k'' &amp;times; ''k'' [[identity matrix]]. We then have

:&lt;math&gt;V_k(\mathbb F^n) = \left\{A \in \mathbb F^{n\times k} : A^* A = I_k \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[topology (structure)|topology]] on &lt;math&gt;V_k(\mathbb F^n)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[subspace topology]] inherited from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}^{n\times k}.&lt;/math&gt; With this topology &lt;math&gt;V_k(\mathbb F^n)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[compact space|compact]] [[manifold]] whose dimension is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dim V_k(\R^n) &amp;= nk - \frac{1}{2}k(k+1) \\
\dim V_k(\C^n) &amp;= 2nk - k^2 \\
\dim V_k(\H^n) &amp;= 4nk - k(2k-1)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==As a homogeneous space==
Each of the Stiefel manifolds &lt;math&gt;V_k(\mathbb F^n)&lt;/math&gt; can be viewed as a [[homogeneous space]] for the [[group action|action]] of a [[classical group]] in a natural manner.

Every orthogonal transformation of a ''k''-frame in &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; results in another ''k''-frame, and any two ''k''-frames are related by some orthogonal transformation. In other words, the [[orthogonal group]] O(''n'') acts [[transitive action|transitively]] on &lt;math&gt;V_k(\R^n).&lt;/math&gt; The [[stabilizer subgroup]] of a given frame is the subgroup isomorphic to O(''n''−''k'') which acts nontrivially on the [[orthogonal complement]] of the space spanned by that frame.

Likewise the [[unitary group]] U(''n'') acts transitively on &lt;math&gt;V_k(\C^n)&lt;/math&gt; with stabilizer subgroup U(''n''−''k'') and the [[symplectic group]] Sp(''n'') acts transitively on &lt;math&gt;V_k(\H^n)&lt;/math&gt; with stabilizer subgroup Sp(''n''−''k'').

In each case &lt;math&gt;V_k(\mathbb F^n)&lt;/math&gt; can be viewed as a homogeneous space:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
V_k(\R^n) &amp;\cong \mbox{O}(n)/\mbox{O}(n-k)\\
V_k(\C^n) &amp;\cong \mbox{U}(n)/\mbox{U}(n-k)\\
V_k(\H^n) &amp;\cong \mbox{Sp}(n)/\mbox{Sp}(n-k)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

When ''k'' = ''n'', the corresponding action is free so that the Stiefel manifold &lt;math&gt;V_n(\mathbb F^n)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[principal homogeneous space]] for the corresponding classical group.

When ''k'' is strictly less than ''n'' then the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(''n'') also acts transitively on &lt;math&gt;V_k(\R^n)&lt;/math&gt; with stabilizer subgroup isomorphic to SO(''n''−''k'') so that

:&lt;math&gt;V_k(\R^n) \cong \mbox{SO}(n)/\mbox{SO}(n-k)\qquad\mbox{for } k &lt; n.&lt;/math&gt;

The same holds for the action of the [[special unitary group]] on &lt;math&gt;V_k(\C^n)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;V_k(\C^n) \cong \mbox{SU}(n)/\mbox{SU}(n-k)\qquad\mbox{for } k &lt; n.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus for ''k'' = ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1, the Stiefel manifold is a principal homogeneous space for the corresponding ''special'' classical group.

==Uniform measure==

The Stiefel manifold can be equipped with a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform measure]], i.e. a [[Borel measure]] that is [[invariant measure|invariant]] under the action of the groups noted above. For example, &lt;math&gt;V_1(\R^2)&lt;/math&gt; which is isomorphic to the unit circle in the Euclidean plane, has as its uniform measure the obvious uniform measure ([[arc length]]) on the circle.  It is straightforward to sample this measure on &lt;math&gt;V_k(\mathbb F^n)&lt;/math&gt; using Gaussian [[random matrix|random matrices]]: if &lt;math&gt;A\in\mathbb{F}^{n\times k}&lt;/math&gt; is a random matrix with [[independent and identically distributed|independent entries identically distributed]] according to the [[standard normal distribution]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}&lt;/math&gt; and ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''QR'' is the [[QR factorization]] of ''A'', then the matrices, &lt;math&gt;Q\in\mathbb{F}^{n\times k}, R\in\mathbb{F}^{k\times k}&lt;/math&gt; are [[independent random variables]] and ''Q'' is distributed according to the uniform measure on &lt;math&gt;V_k(\mathbb F^n).&lt;/math&gt; This result is a consequence of the [[Bartlett decomposition theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Muirhead| first = Robb J. | title = Aspects of Multivariate Statistical Theory | publisher = John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons, Inc., New York| year = 1982 | pages = xix+673| isbn = 0-471-09442-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special cases==

A 1-frame in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}^n&lt;/math&gt; is nothing but a unit vector, so the Stiefel manifold &lt;math&gt;V_1(\mathbb F^n)&lt;/math&gt; is just the [[unit sphere]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}^n.&lt;/math&gt; Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
V_1(\R^n) &amp;= S^{n-1}\\
V_1(\C^n) &amp;= S^{2n-1}\\
V_1(\H^n) &amp;= S^{4n-1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Given a 2-frame in &lt;math&gt;\R^n,&lt;/math&gt; let the first vector define a point in ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; and the second a unit [[tangent vector]] to the sphere at that point. In this way, the Stiefel manifold &lt;math&gt;V_2(\R^n)&lt;/math&gt; may be identified with the [[unit tangent bundle]] {{nowrap|to ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;.}}

When ''k'' = ''n'' or ''n''−1 we saw in the previous section that &lt;math&gt;V_k(\mathbb{F}^n)&lt;/math&gt; is a principal homogeneous space, and therefore [[diffeomorphic]] to the corresponding classical group:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
V_{n-1}(\R^n) &amp;\cong \mathrm{SO}(n)\\
V_{n-1}(\C^n) &amp;\cong \mathrm{SU}(n)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
V_{n}(\R^n) &amp;\cong \mathrm O(n)\\
V_{n}(\C^n) &amp;\cong \mathrm U(n)\\
V_{n}(\H^n) &amp;\cong \mathrm{Sp}(n)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Functoriality==
Given an orthogonal inclusion between vector spaces &lt;math&gt;X \hookrightarrow Y,&lt;/math&gt; the image of a set of ''k'' orthonormal vectors is orthonormal, so there is an induced closed inclusion of Stiefel manifolds, &lt;math&gt;V_k(X) \hookrightarrow V_k(Y),&lt;/math&gt; and this is [[functorial]]. More subtly, given an ''n''-dimensional vector space ''X'', the [[dual basis]] construction gives a bijection between bases for ''X'' and bases for the dual space &lt;math&gt;X^*,&lt;/math&gt; which is continuous, and thus yields a homeomorphism of top Stiefel manifolds &lt;math&gt;V_n(X) \stackrel{\sim}{\to} V_n(X^*).&lt;/math&gt; This is also functorial for isomorphisms of vector spaces.

==As a principal bundle==
There is a natural projection

:&lt;math&gt;p : V_k(\mathbb F^n) \to G_k(\mathbb F^n)&lt;/math&gt;

from the Stiefel manifold &lt;math&gt;V_k(\mathbb F^n)&lt;/math&gt; to the [[Grassmannian]] of ''k''-planes in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}^n&lt;/math&gt; which sends a ''k''-frame to the [[linear subspace|subspace]] spanned by that frame. The [[fiber (mathematics)|fiber]] over a given point ''P'' in &lt;math&gt;G_k(\mathbb F^n)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all orthonormal ''k''-frames contained in the space ''P''.

This projection has the structure of a [[principal bundle|principal ''G''-bundle]] where ''G'' is the associated classical group of degree ''k''. Take the real case for concreteness. There is a natural right action of O(''k'') on &lt;math&gt;V_k(\R^n)&lt;/math&gt; which rotates a ''k''-frame in the space it spans. This action is free but not transitive. The [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]]s of this action are precisely the orthonormal ''k''-frames spanning a given ''k''-dimensional subspace; that is, they are the fibers of the map ''p''. Similar arguments hold in the complex and quaternionic cases.

We then have a sequence of principal bundles:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathrm O(k)   &amp;\to V_k(\R^n) \to G_k(\R^n)\\
\mathrm U(k)   &amp;\to V_k(\C^n) \to G_k(\C^n)\\
\mathrm{Sp}(k) &amp;\to V_k(\H^n) \to G_k(\H^n)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[vector bundle]]s [[associated bundle|associated]] to these principal bundles via the natural action of ''G'' on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}^k&lt;/math&gt; are just the [[tautological bundle]]s over the Grassmannians. In other words, the Stiefel manifold &lt;math&gt;V_k(\mathbb F^n)&lt;/math&gt; is the orthogonal, unitary, or symplectic [[frame bundle]] associated to the tautological bundle on a Grassmannian.

When one passes to the &lt;math&gt;n\to \infty&lt;/math&gt; limit, these bundles become the [[universal bundle]]s for the classical groups.

==Homotopy==
The Stiefel manifolds fit into a family of [[Serre fibration|fibrations]]: 

:&lt;math&gt;V_{k-1}(\R^{n-1}) \to V_k(\R^n) \to S^{n-1},&lt;/math&gt; 

thus the first non-trivial [[homotopy group]] of the space &lt;math&gt;V_k(\R^n)&lt;/math&gt; is in dimension ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''k''. Moreover, 

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_{n-k} V_k(\R^n) \simeq \begin{cases} \Z &amp; n-k \text{ even or } k=1 \\ \Z_2 &amp; n-k \text{ odd and } k&gt;1 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

This result is used in the obstruction-theoretic definition of [[Stiefel–Whitney class]]es.

{{Calculus|Vector}}

In [[vector calculus]], and more generally [[differential geometry]], '''Stokes' theorem''' (also called the '''generalized Stokes theorem''' or the '''Stokes–Cartan theorem'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789400745575|title=Physics of Collisional Plasmas – Introduction to {{!}} Michel Moisan {{!}} Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a statement about the [[integral|integration]] of [[differential form]]s on [[manifolds]], which both simplifies and generalizes several [[theorem]]s from [[vector calculus]].  Stokes' theorem says that the integral of a differential form {{mvar|ω}} over the [[boundary of a manifold|boundary]] of some [[orientation (vector space)#Orientation on manifolds|orientable]] manifold {{math|Ω}} is equal to the integral of its [[exterior derivative]] {{mvar|dω}} over the whole of {{math|Ω}}, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\partial \Omega}\omega=\int_\Omega d\omega\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Stokes' theorem was formulated in its modern form by [[Élie Cartan]] in 1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Les Systèmes Différentiels Extérieurs et leurs Applications Géométriques|last=Cartan|first=Élie|publisher=Hermann|year=1945|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; following earlier work on the generalization of the theorems of vector calculus by [[Vito Volterra]], [[Édouard Goursat]], and [[Henri Poincaré]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Victor J.|date=1979-01-01|title=The History of Stokes' Theorem|jstor=2690275|journal=Mathematics Magazine|volume=52|issue=3|pages=146–156|doi=10.2307/2690275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Topology|last=Katz|first=Victor J.|publisher=Elsevier|year=1999|isbn=9780444823755|editor-last=James|editor-first=I.

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_\Gamma \mathbf{F}\, \cdot\, d{\mathbf{\Gamma}}  = \iint_S \nabla\times\mathbf{F}\, \cdot\, d\mathbf{S} &lt;/math&gt;

This classical statement, along with the classical [[divergence theorem]], the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], and [[Green's theorem]] are simply special cases of the general formulation stated above.

== Introduction ==
The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] states that the [[integral]] of a function {{mvar|f}} over the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} can be calculated by finding an [[antiderivative]] {{mvar|F}} of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|f}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Stokes' theorem is a vast generalization of this theorem in the following sense. 
* By the choice of {{mvar|F}}, {{math|1={{sfrac|''dF''|''dx''}} = ''f''(''x'')}}. In the parlance of [[differential form]]s, this is saying that {{math|''f''(''x'')&amp;thinsp;''dx''}} is the [[exterior derivative]] of the 0-form, i.e. function, {{mvar|F}}: in other words, that {{math|1=''dF'' = ''f''&amp;thinsp;''dx''}}. The general Stokes theorem applies to higher differential forms {{mvar|ω}} instead of just 0-forms such as {{mvar|F}}.
* A closed interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} is a simple example of a one-dimensional [[manifold with boundary]].  Its boundary is the set consisting of the two points {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}. Integrating {{mvar|f}} over the interval may be generalized to integrating forms on a higher-dimensional manifold. Two technical conditions are needed: the manifold has to be [[orientable]], and the form has to be [[compact support|compactly supported]] in order to give a well-defined integral.
* The two points {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} form the boundary of the closed interval. More generally, Stokes' theorem applies to oriented manifolds {{mvar|M}} with boundary. The boundary {{math|∂''M''}} of {{mvar|M}} is itself a manifold and inherits a natural orientation from that of {{mvar|M}}. For example, the natural orientation of the interval gives an orientation of the two boundary points. Intuitively, {{mvar|a}} inherits the opposite orientation as {{mvar|b}}, as they are at opposite ends of the interval. So, "integrating" {{mvar|F}} over two boundary points {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} is taking the difference {{math|''F''(''b'') − ''F''(''a'')}}.
In even simpler terms, one can consider the points as boundaries of curves, that is as 0-dimensional boundaries of 1-dimensional manifolds. So, just as one can find the value of an integral ({{math|1=''f''&amp;thinsp;''dx'' = ''dF''}}) over a 1-dimensional manifold ({{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}) by considering the anti-derivative ({{mvar|F}}) at the 0-dimensional boundaries ({{math|{''a'', ''b''}|}}), one can generalize the fundamental theorem of calculus, with a few additional caveats, to deal with the value of integrals ({{mvar|dω}}) over {{mvar|n}}-dimensional manifolds ({{math|Ω}}) by considering the antiderivative ({{mvar|ω}}) at the {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-dimensional boundaries ({{math|∂Ω}}) of the manifold.

So the fundamental theorem reads:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{[a, b]} f(x)\,dx = \int_{[a, b]} dF = \int_{\{a\}^- \cup \{b\}^+} F = F(b) - F(a)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Formulation for smooth manifolds with boundary==
Let {{math|Ω}} be an oriented [[smooth manifold]] with boundary of [[dimension]] {{mvar|n}} and let {{mvar|α}} be a [[smooth function|smooth]] {{mvar|n}}-[[differential form]] that is [[Support (mathematics)#Compact support|compactly supported]] on {{math|Ω}}. First, suppose that {{mvar|α}} is compactly supported in the domain of a single, [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] [[coordinate chart]] {{math|{''U'', ''φ''}|}}. In this case, we define the integral of {{mvar|α}} over {{math|Ω}} as

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega \alpha = \int_{\varphi(U)} \left(\varphi^{-1}\right)^* \alpha\,,&lt;/math&gt;

i.e., via the [[Pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of {{mvar|α}} to {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

More generally, the integral of {{mvar|α}} over {{math|Ω}} is defined as follows: Let {{math|{''ψ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}|}} be a [[partition of unity]] associated with a [[locally finite collection|locally finite]] [[cover (topology)|cover]] {{math|{''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}|}} of (consistently oriented) coordinate charts, then define the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega \alpha \equiv \sum_i \int_{U_i} \psi_i \alpha\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where each term in the sum is evaluated by pulling back to {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} as described above.  This quantity is well-defined; that is, it does not depend on the choice of the coordinate charts, nor the partition of unity.

The generalized Stokes theorem reads:

{{quotebox|align=center|quote='''Theorem.''' ''(Stokes–Cartan) If &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is a [[infinitely differentiable|smooth]] &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-[[differential form|form]] with [[compact support]] on smooth &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[manifold|manifold-with-boundary]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[boundary of a manifold|boundary]] of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; given the induced [[orientation (mathematics)#Geometric algebra|orientation]], and &lt;math&gt;i:\partial \Omega\hookrightarrow \Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[inclusion map]], then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega d\omega = \int_{\partial \Omega} i^*\omega&lt;/math&gt;.''}}

Conventionally, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\int_{\partial\Omega} i^*\omega&lt;/math&gt; is abbreviated as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\int_{\partial\Omega} \omega&lt;/math&gt;, since the pullback of a differential form by the inclusion map is simply its restriction to its domain: &lt;math&gt;i^*\omega=\omega|_{\partial\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;.  Here &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the [[exterior derivative]], which is defined using the manifold structure only.  The right-hand side is sometimes written as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\oint_{\partial\Omega} \omega&lt;/math&gt; to stress the fact that the &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-manifold &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt; has no boundary.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For  mathematicians this fact is known, therefore the circle is redundant and often omitted.  However, one should keep in mind here that in [[thermodynamics]], where frequently expressions as {{math|∮&lt;sub&gt;''W''&lt;/sub&gt; {''d''&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;''U''}|}} appear (wherein the total derivative, see below, should not be confused with the exterior one), the integration path {{mvar|W}} is a one-dimensional closed line on a much higher-dimensional manifold. That is, in a thermodynamic application, where {{mvar|U}} is a function of the temperature {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; :{{=}} ''T''}}, the volume {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; :{{=}} ''V''}}, and the electrical polarization {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; :{{=}} ''P''}} of the sample, one has
:&lt;math&gt;\{d_\text{total}U\}=\sum_{i=1}^3\frac{\partial U}{\partial\alpha_i}\,d\alpha_i\,,&lt;/math&gt;
and the circle is really necessary, e.g. if one considers the ''differential'' consequences of the ''integral'' postulate
:&lt;math&gt;\oint_W\,\{d_\text{total}U\}\, \stackrel{!}{=}\,0\,.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (This fact is also an implication of Stokes' theorem, since for a given smooth &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional manifold &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, application of the theorem twice gives &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\int_{\partial(\partial \Omega)}\omega=\int_\Omega d(d\omega)=0&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;(n-2)&lt;/math&gt;-form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, which implies that &lt;math&gt;\partial(\partial\Omega)=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.) The right-hand side of the equation is often used to formulate ''integral'' laws; the left-hand side then leads to equivalent ''differential'' formulations (see below).

The theorem is often used in situations where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is an embedded oriented submanifold of some bigger manifold, often &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^k&lt;/math&gt;, on which the form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is defined.

==Topological preliminaries; integration over chains==

Let {{mvar|M}} be a [[smooth manifold]]. A (smooth) singular [[Simplex|{{mvar|k}}-simplex]] in {{mvar|M}} is defined as a [[smooth map]] from the standard simplex in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} to {{mvar|M}}. The group {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'', '''Z''')}} of singular {{mvar|k}}-[[chain (algebraic topology)|chains]] on {{mvar|M}} is defined to be the [[free abelian group]] on the set of singular {{mvar|k}}-simplices in {{mvar|M}}. These groups, together with the boundary map, {{math|∂}}, define a [[chain complex]]. The corresponding homology (resp. cohomology) group is isomorphic to the usual [[singular homology]] group {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'', '''Z''')}} (resp. the [[singular cohomology]] group {{math|''H''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'', '''Z''')}}), defined using continuous rather than smooth simplices in {{mvar|M}}.

On the other hand, the differential forms, with exterior derivative, {{mvar|d}}, as the connecting map, form a cochain complex, which defines the [[de Rham cohomology]] groups {{math|''H''{{su|p=''k''|b=''dR''}}(''M'', '''R''')}}.

Differential {{mvar|k}}-forms can be integrated over a {{mvar|k}}-simplex in a natural way, by pulling back to {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Extending by linearity allows one to integrate over chains. This gives a linear map from the space of {{mvar|k}}-forms to the {{mvar|k}}th group of singular cochains, {{math|''C&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''(''M'', '''Z''')}}, the linear functionals on {{math|''C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''(''M'', '''Z''')}}. In other words, a {{mvar|k}}-form {{mvar|ω}} defines a functional

:&lt;math&gt;I(\omega)(c) = \oint_c \omega&lt;/math&gt;

on the {{mvar|k}}-chains. Stokes' theorem says that this is a chain map from de Rham cohomology to singular cohomology with real coefficients; the exterior derivative, {{mvar|d}}, behaves like the ''dual'' of {{math|∂}} on forms. This gives a homomorphism from de Rham cohomology to singular cohomology. On the level of forms, this means:

#closed forms, i.e., {{math|''dω'' {{=}} 0}}, have zero integral over ''boundaries'', i.e. over manifolds that can be written as {{math|∂∑&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; ''M&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and
#exact forms, i.e., {{math|''ω'' {{=}} ''dσ''}}, have zero integral over ''cycles'', i.e. if the boundaries sum up to the empty set: {{math|∑&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; ''M&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ∅}}.

[[De Rham's theorem]] shows that this homomorphism is in fact an isomorphism. So the converse to 1 and 2 above hold true. In other words, if {{math|{''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}|}} are cycles generating the {{mvar|k}}th homology group, then for any corresponding real numbers, {{math|{''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}|}}, there exist a closed form, {{mvar|ω}}, such that

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_{c_i} \omega = a_i\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and this form is unique up to exact forms.

Stokes' theorem on smooth manifolds can be derived from Stokes' theorem for chains in smooth manifolds, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manifolds, Tensors, and Forms|last=Renteln|first=Paul|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=9781107324893|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=158–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Formally stated, the latter reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Smooth Manifolds|last=Lee|first=John M.|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=9781441999818|location=New York|pages=481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underlying principle ==
[[Image:Stokes patch.svg|200px|left]]
To simplify these topological arguments, it is worthwhile to examine the underlying principle by considering an example for {{math|''d'' {{=}} 2}} dimensions. The essential idea can be understood by the diagram on the left, which shows that, in an oriented tiling of a manifold, the interior paths are traversed in opposite directions; their contributions to the path integral thus cancel each other pairwise. As a consequence, only the contribution from the boundary remains. It thus suffices to prove Stokes' theorem for sufficiently fine tilings (or, equivalently, [[simplex|simplices]]), which usually is not difficult.

{{Clear}}

==Generalization to rough sets==
[[Image:Green's-theorem-simple-region.svg|thumb|upright|180px|A region (here called {{mvar|D}} instead of {{math|Ω}}) with piecewise smooth boundary.  This is a [[manifold with corners]], so its boundary is not a smooth manifold.]]

The formulation above, in which {{math|Ω}} is a smooth manifold with boundary, does not suffice in many applications.  For example, if the domain of integration is defined as the plane region between two {{mvar|x}}-coordinates and the graphs of two functions, it will often happen that the domain has corners.  In such a case, the corner points mean that {{math|Ω}} is not a smooth manifold with boundary, and so the statement of Stokes' theorem given above does not apply.  Nevertheless, it is possible to check that the conclusion of Stokes' theorem is still true.  This is because {{math|Ω}} and its boundary are well-behaved away from a small set of points (a [[measure zero]] set).

A version of Stokes' theorem that extends to rough domains was proved by Whitney.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, ''Geometric Integration Theory,'' III.14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Assume that {{mvar|D}} is a connected bounded open subset of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Call {{mvar|D}} a ''standard domain'' if it satisfies the following property: There exists a subset {{mvar|P}} of {{math|∂''D''}}, open in {{math|∂''D''}}, whose complement in {{math|∂''D''}} has [[Hausdorff measure|Hausdorff {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-measure]] zero; and such that every point of {{mvar|P}} has a ''generalized normal vector''.  This is a vector {{math|'''v'''(''x'')}} such that, if a coordinate system is chosen so that {{math|'''v'''(''x'')}} is the first basis vector, then, in an open neighborhood around {{mvar|x}}, there exists a smooth function {{math|''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} such that {{mvar|P}} is the graph {{math|{ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) }|}} and {{mvar|D}} is the region {{math|{ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) }|}}.  Whitney remarks that the boundary of a standard domain is the union of a set of zero Hausdorff {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-measure and a finite or countable union of smooth {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-manifolds, each of which has the domain on only one side.  He then proves that if {{mvar|D}} is a standard domain in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{mvar|ω}} is an {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-form which is defined, continuous, and bounded on {{math|''D'' ∪ ''P''}}, smooth on {{mvar|D}}, integrable on {{mvar|P}}, and such that {{mvar|dω}} is integrable on {{mvar|D}}, then Stokes' theorem holds, that is,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_P \omega = \int_D d\omega\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The study of measure-theoretic properties of rough sets leads to [[geometric measure theory]].  Even more general versions of Stokes' theorem have been proved by Federer and by Harrison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harrison|first=J.|title=Stokes' theorem for nonsmooth chains|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society |series=New Series|volume=29|issue=2|date=October 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special cases==
The general form of the Stokes theorem using differential forms is more powerful and easier to use than the special cases. The traditional versions can be formulated using [[Cartesian coordinates]] without the machinery of differential geometry, and thus are more accessible. Further, they are older and their names are more familiar as a result. The traditional forms are often considered more convenient by practicing scientists and engineers but the non-naturalness of the traditional formulation becomes apparent when using other coordinate systems, even familiar ones like spherical or cylindrical coordinates. There is potential for confusion in the way names are applied, and the use of dual formulations.

===Kelvin–Stokes theorem===
[[Image:Stokes' Theorem.svg|thumb|right|An illustration of the Kelvin–Stokes theorem, with surface {{math|Σ}}, its boundary {{math|∂Σ}} and the "normal" vector {{mvar|n}}.]]

This is a (dualized) (1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional case, for a 1-form (dualized because it is a statement about [[vector field]]s). This special case is often just referred to as ''Stokes' theorem'' in many introductory university vector calculus courses and is used in physics and engineering. It is also sometimes known as the '''[[Curl (mathematics)|curl]]''' theorem.

The classical [[Kelvin–Stokes theorem]] relates the [[surface integral]] of the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a [[vector field]] over a surface {{math|Σ}} in Euclidean three-space to the [[line integral]] of the vector field over its boundary. It is a special case of the general Stokes theorem (with {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}}) once we identify a vector field with a 1-form using the metric on Euclidean 3-space. The curve of the line integral, {{math|∂Σ}}, must have positive [[curve orientation|orientation]], meaning that {{math|∂Σ}} points counterclockwise when the [[normal (geometry)|surface normal]], {{math|'''n'''}}, points toward the viewer.

One consequence of the Kelvin–Stokes theorem is that the [[field line]]s of a vector field with zero curl cannot be closed contours. The formula can be rewritten as:

&lt;div align=left&gt;
&lt;div class="messagebox standard-talk NavFrame"&gt;
&lt;div align=left&gt;
Suppose {{math|'''F'''(''P''(''x'',''y'',''z''),''Q''(''x'',''y'',''z''),''R''(''x'',''y'',''z''))}} is defined in region with smooth surface {{math|Σ}} and has first-order continuous [[partial derivatives]]. Then
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp; \iint_\Sigma \Bigg(\left(\frac{\partial R}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial Q}{\partial z} \right)\,dy\,dz +\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial z}-\frac{\partial R}{\partial x} \right) \,dz\,dx  +\left (\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right)\,dx\,dy\Bigg) \\[4pt]
= {} &amp; \oint_{\partial\Sigma} \Big(P\,dx+Q\,dy+R\,dz\Big)\,,\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;where {{mvar|P}}, {{mvar|Q}} and {{mvar|R}} are the components of {{math|'''F'''}}, and {{math|∂Σ}} is boundary of region with smooth surface {{math|Σ}}.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

===Green's theorem===
[[Green's theorem]] is immediately recognizable as the third integrand of both sides in the integral in terms of {{mvar|P}}, {{mvar|Q}}, and {{mvar|R}} cited above.

====In electromagnetism====
Two of the four [[Maxwell equations]] involve curls of 3-D vector fields and their differential and integral forms are related by the [[Kelvin–Stokes theorem]]. Caution must be taken to avoid cases with moving boundaries: the partial time derivatives are intended to exclude such cases. If moving boundaries are included, interchange of integration and differentiation introduces terms related to boundary motion not included in the results below (see [[Differentiation under the integral sign]]):

| &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\quad \oint_C \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{l} &amp;= \iint_S  \nabla \times \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} \\ &amp;= -\iint_S \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \cdot d\mathbf{A}\end{align}\quad &lt;/math&gt; (with {{mvar|C}} and {{mvar|S}} not necessarily stationary)

| [[Ampère's law]]&lt;br /&gt; (with Maxwell's extension):

|}
The above listed subset of Maxwell's equations are valid for electromagnetic fields expressed in [[SI units]]. In other systems of units, such as [[Maxwell's equations#CGS units|CGS]] or [[Gaussian units]], the scaling factors for the terms differ. For example, in Gaussian units, Faraday's law of induction and Ampère's law take the forms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=J.&amp;nbsp;D.|last=Jackson|title=Classical Electrodynamics|edition=2nd|publisher=Wiley|location=New York, NY|date=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=M.|last=Born|first2=E.|last2=Wolf|title=Principles of Optics|edition=6th|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|date=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \nabla \times \mathbf{E} &amp;= -\frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}} {\partial t}\,, \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{H} &amp;= \frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}} {\partial t} + \frac{4\pi}{c} \mathbf{J}\,, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

respectively, where {{mvar|c}} is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum.

===Divergence theorem===
Likewise, the [[Divergence theorem|Ostrogradsky–Gauss theorem]] (also known as the divergence theorem or Gauss's theorem)

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\mathrm{Vol} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} \, d_\mathrm{Vol} = \oint_{\partial \mathrm{Vol}} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\boldsymbol{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

is a special case if we identify a vector field with the {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-form obtained by contracting the vector field with the Euclidean volume form. An application of this is the case {{math|'''F''' {{=}} ''f'''''c'''}} where {{math|'''c'''}} is an arbitrary constant vector. Working out the divergence of the product gives
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf c \cdot \int_\mathrm{Vol} \nabla f \, d_\mathrm{Vol} = \mathbf c \cdot \oint_{\partial \mathrm{Vol}} f\, d\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Since this holds for all {{math|'''c'''}} we find
:&lt;math&gt;\int_\mathrm{Vol} \nabla f \, d_\mathrm{Vol} = \oint_{\partial \mathrm{Vol}} f\, d\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2597">In mathematics, the '''  Turán number''' T(''n'',''k'',''r'') for  ''r''-uniform [[hypergraph]]s of order ''n'' is the smallest number of ''r''-edges such that every [[induced subgraph]] on ''k'' vertices contains an edge. This number was determined for ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 by {{harvtxt|Turán|1941}}, and the  problem for general ''r'' was introduced in {{harvtxt|Turán|1961}}. The paper {{harv|Sidorenko|1995}} gives a survey of Turán numbers.

==Definitions==
Fix a set ''X'' of ''n'' vertices. For given ''r'', an '''''r''-edge''' or '''block''' is a set of ''r'' vertices. A set of blocks is called a '''Turán (''n'',''k'',''r'') system''' (''n'' ≥ ''k'' ≥ ''r'') if every ''k''-element subset of ''X'' contains a block.
The  '''  Turán number''' T(''n'',''k'',''r'') is the minimum size of such a system.

==Example==
The complements of the lines of the [[Fano plane]] form a Turán (7,5,4)-system. T(7,5,4) = 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg. 649, Example 61.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations to other combinatorial designs==
It can be shown that
::&lt;math&gt;T(n,k,r) \geq \binom{n}{r} {\binom{k}{r}}^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;
Equality holds if and only if there exists a [[Steiner system]] S(''n'' - ''k'', ''n'' - ''r'', ''n'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg. 649, Remark 61.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[combinatorial design|(''n'',''r'',''k'',''r'')-lotto design]] is an (''n'', ''k'', ''r'')-Turán system. Thus, T(''n'',''k'', ''r'') = L(''n'',''r'',''k'',''r'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg. 513, Proposition 32.12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Veblen Research Instructorship''' is a three-year position  offered by the Department of Mathematics at [[Princeton University]] and the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. This position was established in 1998 and offered each year to outstanding candidates in pure and applied mathematics who have received their Ph.D. within the last three years.

The Veblen instructors are Members of the Institute for Advanced Study and regular faculty members at Princeton University. The first and third year of the instructorship are spent at Princeton University and carry regular teaching responsibilities. The second year is spent at the Institute and dedicated to independent research of the instructor's choice.

The instructorship is named after  [[Oswald Veblen]] (1880&amp;ndash;1960), who was a Henry B. Fine Professor of Mathematics at the University of Princeton until 1932 and became the first professor at the Institute that same year.

It is often stored in a dedicated register, typically called [[status register]] or [[flag register]], along with other flags. The zero flag is typically abbreviated '''Z''' or '''ZF''' or similar in most documentation and assembly languages.

Along with a [[carry flag]], a [[sign flag]] and an [[overflow flag]], the zero flag is used to check the result of an arithmetic operation, including bitwise logical [[Instruction set|instruction]]s. It is set to 1, or true, if an arithmetic result is zero, and reset otherwise. This includes results which are not stored, as most traditional instruction sets implement the [[compare instruction]] as a subtract where the result is discarded. It is also common that processors have a bitwise AND-instruction that does not store the result.

In most processors, the zero flag is mainly used in conditional [[Branch (computer science)|branch]] instructions, which alter control flow on previous instruction results, but there are often other uses as well.

In some instruction sets such as the [[MIPS architecture]], a dedicated flag register is not used; jump instructions instead check a register for zero.
