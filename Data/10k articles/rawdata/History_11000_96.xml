[[File:ages-in-chaos.jpg|right|thumb|''Ages in Chaos'' book cover]]

'''''Ages in Chaos''''' is a book by the controversial writer [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], first published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] in 1952, which put forward a major revision of the history of the Ancient Near East, claiming that the histories of [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient Israel]] are five centuries out of step.  He followed this with a number of other works where he attempted to complete his reconstruction of ancient history, collectively known as the ''Ages in Chaos'' series.

Velikovsky's work has been harshly criticised, including even by some fellow chronological revisionists.

==Summary==
Velikovsky had put forward his ideas briefly in ''Theses for the Reconstruction of Ancient History'' in 1945, where he claimed that the history of the ancient Near East down to the time of [[Alexander the Great]] is garbled, but ''Ages in Chaos'' was his first full-length work on the subject.

His starting point for the first volume of the series was that [[the Exodus]] took place not, as orthodoxy has it, at some point during the Egyptian [[New Kingdom]], but at the fall of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Velikovsky ''Ages in Chaos''&lt;/ref&gt;  In this and later volumes, he made heavy use of the concept of "ghost doubles" or alter-egos: historical figures who were known by different names in two different sources (e.g. Egyptian and Greek) and were considered to be entirely different people living in different centuries, but who he proposed to be actually erroneously dated accounts of the same individuals and events.

First he claimed that the [[Ipuwer Papyrus]] came from the beginning of Egypt's [[Second Intermediate Period]], and that this was an Egyptian account of the [[Plagues of Egypt]].  He then identified [[Dudimose|Tutimaios]] as the [[Pharaoh of the Exodus]] (much earlier than any of the mainstream candidates), the [[Hyksos]] with the biblical [[Amalek]]ites, the Egyptian Pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]] with the Biblical [[Queen of Sheba]], the [[land of Punt]] with [[Solomon]]'s kingdom, and Pharaoh [[Thutmose III]] with the Biblical King [[Shishak]].  He claimed that the Egyptian [[Amarna letters]] from the late [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]] describe events from the kingdoms of Israel and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], from roughly the time of King [[Ahab]].

== Later works on ancient history ==
[[File:GD-EG-Caire-Musée061.JPG|right|thumb|Akhnaton]]
A second volume was due for publication shortly after this but was postponed.  Instead it was followed in 1960 by ''Oedipus and Akhnaton'', where he claimed that the story of the Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] was the origin of the Greek legend of [[Oedipus]], and that [[Amenophis III]] was [[Laius]], and [[Tutankhamun]] was [[Eteocles]].&lt;ref&gt;Velikovsky ''Oedipus and Akhnaton''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last two years of his life Velikovsky published a further two volumes of the series.  In ''Peoples of the Sea'' he dealt with the final period of his reconstruction, the Persian invasions of Egypt.  [[Manetho]]'s [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th dynasty]] here becomes identified with the dynasties which ruled a newly independent Egypt in the early 4th century BCE, and [[Nectanebo I]] is a ghost double of [[Rameses III]].&lt;ref&gt;Velikovsky ''Peoples of the Sea''&lt;/ref&gt;  Rameses III fought invasions by the [[Sea Peoples]], including the "Peleset", conventionally identified with the [[Philistines]].  According to Velikovsky, the "Peleset" are actually the Persians and the other Sea Peoples are their Greek mercenaries.  The [[Twenty-first dynasty of Egypt|21st dynasty]] then becomes a line of priest-kings who ruled in the [[oasis|oases]] simultaneously with the Persians.

[[File:RamsesIIEgypt.jpg|thumb|Ramses II]]
In ''Ramses II and His Time'' Velikovsky identified each of the major 19th dynasty pharaohs with a corresponding pharaoh of the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|26th dynasty]].  Thus, [[Ramses I]] was an alter-ego of [[Necho I]], [[Seti I]] of [[Psamtik I]], [[Ramses II]] of [[Necho II]], and [[Merneptah]] of [[Apries]].  In order to make these identifications work, Velikovsky claimed that the [[Hittites|Hittite Empire]] was an invention of modern historians, and the supposedly Hittite archaeological remains in modern [[Turkey]] were actually Chaldean, i.e. Neo-[[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonian]].  The Hittite kings are held to be ghost doubles of the Neo-Babylonian kings, and Rameses II's battle with the Hittites at [[Battle of Kadesh|Kadesh]] is identical to Necho's fight against [[Nebuchadrezzar II]] at [[Battle of Carchemish|Carchemish]], [[Nabopolassar]] is [[Mursili II]], [[Neriglissar]] is [[Muwatalli II|Muwatalli]], [[Labashi-Marduk]] is [[Mursili III|Urhi-Teshup]], and Nebuchadrezzar II is [[Hattusili III]].&lt;ref&gt;Velikovsky ''Ramses II and His Time''&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his death he considered that completing his reconstruction of ancient history would require a further two volumes: ''The Assyrian Conquest'' and ''The Dark Age of Greece''; these were never published in print in English, but online versions are available at the Velikovsky archive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.varchive.org/ The Immanuel Velikovsky Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the former work, Velikovsky separated the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th]] and [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th dynasties]], specifically arguing that over a century separated [[Ay]] and [[Horemheb]], conventionally regarded as his successor.  Instead, he had the 22nd through 25th dynasties follow upon the earlier part of the 18th, leading down to the Assyrian invasions of the early 7th century BCE.  The "great king" who crowned Horemheb was the Assyrian king.

The books have remained popular.  The British publisher [[Sidgwick &amp; Jackson]] reprinted ''Ages in Chaos'' ten times between 1953 and 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Velikovsky |1977 |p=iv (publisher's summary)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Paradigma reprinted it as recently as 2009.

==Controversy and criticism==
The revised chronology proposed by ''Ages in Chaos'' has been rejected by nearly all mainstream historians and [[Egyptology|Egyptologists]]. It was claimed, starting with early reviewers, that Velikovsky's usage of material for proof is often very selective.&lt;ref&gt;[[William F. Albright|Albright, William]] 1952. ''New York Herald Tribune Book Review'' April 20. Retelling the Near East's Ancient History. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Waldemar Kaempffert|Kaempffert, Waldemar]] 1952. ''New York Times Book Review'' April 20. Solomon, the Queen of Sheba, and the Egypt of Exodus. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stiebing, Jr., William H. 1984. Cosmic Catastrophism, Chap. III, in ''Ancient Astronauts, Cosmic Collisions'' Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|0-87975-260-2}}. pp. 57-80.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1965 the leading cuneiformist [[Abraham Sachs]], in a forum at [[Brown University]], discredited Velikovsky's use of [[Mesopotamia]]n [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;see transcript in ''Aeon'' 1992, Vol.3 No.1, pp.103-5, and also http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/vsachs.html&lt;/ref&gt; Velikovsky was never able to refute Sachs' attack.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Leroy Ellenberger|Ellenberger, Leroy]] 1992. ''Aeon'' '''3''' (1), section "Bonanza from Brown" in "Of Lessons, Legacies, and Litmus Tests: A Velikovsky Potpourri (Part One)", pp. 88-90. "Velikovsky confronted a panel of four professors [at Brown University on March 15, 1965]: [[Leon Cooper|Leon N. Cooper]] (physics), Bruno J Giletti (geology), Charles Smiley (astronomy) and Abraham J. Sachs (history of mathematics) [who was substituting for [[Otto Neugebauer]] ], moderated by [[Henry Kučera]] (linguistics). In the event, Velikovsky debated the first three handily. He was stunned by Sachs whose address was both a rhetorical and substantive ''tour de force''. Velikovsky's rebuttal began: 'Dr. Sachs threw so many accusations in that [[Philippic]] of his that I am at a difficulty to answer; but I invite Dr. Sachs to spend the hour and a half tomorrow at the meeting [at Diman House], and every one of you too, and point by point each of his statements will be proven wrong.' Unfortunately, Sachs did not show up the next day and Velikovsky did not even mention Sachs [according to the tape recording of the proceedings in the possession of [http://www.velikovsky.info/Warner_B._Sizemore Warner B. Sizemore] who loaned it to Ellenberger March 31, 1979]. Curiously, Velikovsky's file for the Brown trip contains typed rebuttals to all the panelists ''except'' Sachs, for whom only partial, penciled notes exist&amp;mdash;but later that year Velikovsky would reply to Kim J. Masters, a Princeton sophomore, within a week in ''The Daily Princetonian'' (Nov. 15, 1965) over a criticism of ''Oedipus and Akhnaton''. Velikovsky's rebuttal to Masters was scathing, running the gamut from haggling over details to ''ad hominems''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 [[fringe science]] expert [[Henry H. Bauer]] wrote ''Beyond Velikovsky: The History of a Public Controversy'', which ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' described as "the definitive treatise debunking Immanuel Velikovsky".&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1064461-2,00.html | title = Science on the Fringe | publisher = [[Time magazine]] | author = Michael D. Lemonick/Gainesville | date = 2005-05-24 | accessdate = 2008-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bauer accused Velikovsky of dogmatically asserting his own point of view to be correct, where at best this is only one possible interpretation of the historical material in question, and gives several examples from ''Ages in Chaos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Bauer |1999 |pp=158–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 Egyptologist David Lorton produced a detailed critique of chapter 3 of ''Ages in Chaos'', which identifies Hatshepsut with the Queen of Sheba, e.g. accusing Velikovsky of mistakes which he would have avoided if he had a basic knowledge of the languages of the ancient near east.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reocities.com/Athens/academy/1326/hatshepsut.html Lorton, David ''Hatshepsut, the Queen of Sheba, and Immanuel Velikovsky]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, following the much-postponed publication of further volumes in Velikovsky's ''Ages in Chaos'' series, the United Kingdom-based Society for Interdisciplinary Studies organised a conference in [[Glasgow]] specifically to debate the revised chronology.&lt;ref&gt;"Ages in Chaos?'-Proceedings of the Residential Weekend Conference, Glasgow, 7th-9th April 1978" ''Society for Interdisciplinary Studies Review'' Vol. VI, issue 1/2/3 84pp (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate conclusion of this work, by scholars including [[Peter James (historian)|Peter James]], John Bimson, Geoffrey Gammonn, and [[David Rohl]], was that this particular revision of chronology was untenable,&lt;ref&gt;Bimson, "Finding the Limits of Chronological Revision" in "Proceedings of the SIS Conference: Ages Still in Chaos" ''Chronology &amp; Catastrophism Review'' 2003&lt;/ref&gt; although they considered that the work had highlighted problems with the orthodox chronology.&lt;ref name=James&gt;{{harvnb |James |1991 |p=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Rohl, one of those involved in the 1978 Glasgow conference, has developed his own revised chronology. While he agrees that the Exodus should be dated to the collapse of the Middle Kingdom, and that Tutimaios is the [[Pharaoh of the Exodus]],&lt;ref name=rohl283&gt;{{harvnb |Rohl |1995 |p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are few points of contact between the Velikovsky and Rohl chronologies, largely because of the different methodologies used to resolve the later periods.&lt;ref name=rohl402&gt;{{harvnb |Rohl |1995 |p=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James, another Glasgow delegate who went on to publish a work challenging the concept of a widespread dark age at the [[Bronze Age collapse|end of the Bronze Age]], credited Velikovsky with "point[ing] the way to a solution by challenging Egyptian chronology", but criticised Velikovsky's chronology as "disastrously extreme", producing "a rash of new problems far more severe than those it hoped to solve" and noted that "Velikovsky understood little of archaeology and nothing of stratigraphy".&lt;ref name=James/&gt;

One important disagreement is that Rohl and James consider that the chronology of the ancient Near East becomes fixed by the conquests of the [[Assyria]]ns in the 7th century BCE.  Velikovsky carried his revisionism into the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]], and considered that chronology only becomes fixed by the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in the 4th century BCE.  They have also rejected some of Velikovsky's more extreme claims e.g. non-existence of Hittite Empire, changing the order of some Egyptian dynasties.  Rohl and James's views remain controversial and are not accepted by most historians.

==Legacy== 
In spite of the unrelenting hostility of mainstream historians, Velikovsky's revisionism continues to attract adherents. Following his death in 1979 Velikovsky's theories were championed by Lynn E. Rose, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at [[University at Buffalo|Buffalo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Ginenthal is the founder and principal contributor to an online journal ''The Velikovskian''. He has also authored a series of revisionist works under the title ''Pillars of the Past''. Emmet Sweeney has published his chronological revisions in a series of works entitled ''Ages in Alignment''.

Far from slavishly championing Velikovsky's chronology, these scholars believe that Velikovsky did not go far enough. Under the influence of [[Gunnar Heinsohn]] they have shortened Velikovsky's timeline of ancient history even more. The 12th Dynasty of ancient Egypt has been moved almost 1500 years closer to the present, ending with Alexander the Great's invasion in -331.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Little if any of this has been endorsed by the mainstream historians.

'''Andrzej Ajnenkiel''' (21 February 1931 – 10 April 2015) was a [[Poland|Polish]] historian. He specialized in the political history of Poland and the history of Polish law, especially [[constitutional law]].

From 1949 to 1954 Ajnenkiel studied law at the [[University of Warsaw]]. Since 1979 Ajnenkiel had been a professor at the Institute of History at the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] in Warsaw. In 1991 he gained a professor degree, the highest academic degree in Poland, and later a [[habilitation]]. He was a member and director of several historical societies, including the [[Polish Historical Society (Poland)|Polish Historical Society]].

'''António Galvão''' (c. 1490–1557), known in English as '''Antonio Galvano''', was a Portuguese soldier, [[chronicle]]r and administrator in the [[Maluku islands]], and a Renaissance historian, the first to present a comprehensive report of all the leading voyages and explorers up to 1550, either by Portuguese and by other nationalities. His works show a remarkable accuracy, especially the Treaty of Discovery published in Lisbon in 1563 and in English by [[Richard Hakluyt]] in 1601.

==Life==
António Galvão was the son of Duarte Galvão, chief diplomat and chronicler to king [[Afonso V of Portugal]].&lt;ref name="Décadas da Ásia, V"&gt;{{cite book |author1=João de Barros |author2=Manoel Severim de Faria |author3=João Baptista Lavanha |title=Da Asia de João de Barros e de Diogo de Couto, Volume 13, p. 91|publisher=Na Regia officina typografica|year=1780|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9582AAAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;ots=kww-OVYRL3&amp;dq=Ant%C3%B3nio%20Galv%C3%A3o%20governador%20de%20ternate&amp;pg=PA91#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1527 he sailed for [[Portuguese India]] where he became captain of the Maluku and governor of the fort of [[Ternate]] from 1536 to 1540. He is described in Chapter II of the Fifth [[João de Barros|Decade of Asia]]" as a respected governor, having sent a mission to Papua and receiving local embassies. He funded a seminar in Ternate, where he spent twelve thousand ''cruzados'' from the inheritance he had received from his father, and was known especially for his integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lach, Donald Frederick |title=Asia in the making of Europe: The century of discovery, p. 195|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ITsziXHYO1sC&amp;lpg=PA195&amp;dq=ant%C3%B3nio%20galv%C3%A3o%20francisco%20sousa%20tavares&amp;pg=PA195#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn= 0-226-46731-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1540 he handed the government of the fortress to D. Jorge de Castro and returned to Portugal, where he discovered to have fallen into disgrace.&lt;ref name="Décadas da Ásia, V" /&gt; He lived the last years in anonymity and poverty, in the Royal Hospital, awaiting a pension. There he died and was buried in 1557.

==Works==
António Galvão left two manuscripts. One was the treaty of the discoveries printed after his death, in 1563, in Lisbon by his friend Francisco de Sousa Tavares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/John_Carter_Brown_Library/Portugal/Overseas.html|title= Portuguese Overseas Travels and European Readers|author=John_Carter_Brown_Library|date=|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on numerous written sources and documents, the work presented for the first time a synthesis of all the discoveries made by Portuguese and Spanish until 1550. Richard Hakluyt had it translated and published in English in 1601 as "The discoveries of the world - by Antonio Galvano".
* ''Tratado que compôs o nobre &amp; notauel capitão Antonio Galuão, dos diuersos &amp; desuayrados caminhos, por onde nos tempos passados a pimenta &amp; especearia veyo da India às nossas partes, &amp; assi de todos os descobrimentos antigos &amp; modernos, que são feitos até a era de mil &amp; quinhentos &amp; cincoenta'', published 1563 in Lisbon by João da Barreira.

(A 1731 edition under the slightly altered title, ''Tratado dos Descobrimentos, antigos e modernos, feitos até a era de 1550'' was published in Lisbon by Oficina Ferreiriana).

The second manuscript was a history of the [[Moluccas]] (Maluku) with the title:

* ''Historia das Molucas, da natureza, e descubrimento daquellas terras divida em 10 livros''. ("History of the Moluccas, nature and discovery of the lands divided into 10 books")

This remained unpublished, the manuscript was passed by Francisco de Sousa Tavares to the crown. It is referred to by 16th-century chroniclers [[João de Barros]] and [[João Baptista Lavanha]]. It is alleged that a good part of it was reproduced verbatim within [[Damião de Góis]]'s 1566-67 ''Chronica del rey D. Manuel'', but all trace of the original Galvão manuscript disappeared after Góis's death.&lt;ref&gt;Diogo Barbosa Machado (1741) ''Bibliotheca Lusitana'', v.1, p.285&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, a document was found in the [[Archivo General de Indias]] in [[Seville]] with a history of the Maluku which was identified as being part (perhaps an early draft) of António Galvão's lost document. It was published in a bilingual (Portuguese-English) edition in 1971, arranged by Hubert Jacobs, under the title ''A Treatise on the Moluccas (c. 1544), probably the preliminary version of António Galvão's lost Historia das Moluccas'' (Rome: Jesuit Historical Society).

[[File:Chancellor Eisen approved 2.jpg|thumb|Arnold M. Eisen]]'''Arnold M. Eisen, Ph.D.''' (born 1951) is an American Judaic scholar who is [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] in New York.  Prior to this appointment, he served as the Koshland Professor of Jewish Culture and Religion and Chair of the Department of Religious Studies at [[Stanford University]]. Prior to joining the Stanford faculty in 1986, he taught at [[Tel Aviv University]] and [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=WhoWho/&gt;

== The Jewish Theological Seminary==
In 2006, Eisen was appointed as the seventh Chancellor of The [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]], replacing [[Rabbi]] Dr. [[Ismar Schorsch]]. Eisen is the second non-rabbi, after [[Cyrus Adler]], to hold this post. He is also the first person with a [[social science]] background to serve as Chancellor; previous chancellors had backgrounds in [[Jewish]] [[history]] or [[Talmud]]. He took office as Chancellor-elect on July 1, 2007, the day after Schorsch stepped down, and assumed the position full-time on July 1, 2008.

Since his appointment in 2007, he has increased JTS's impact on the communities it serves by transforming the education of religious leadership for Conservative Judaism; articulating a new vision for JTS; guiding the formulation of a strategic plan to implement that vision; and developing innovative programs in synagogue arts and practices, adult education, pastoral care, Jewish thought, interreligious dialogue, and the arts. His initiatives include new curricula for, and synergy among, all of JTS's five schools; the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110313112408/http://www.jtsa.edu/Academics/The_Institute_for_Jewish_Learning_at_JTS.xml Institute for Jewish Learning at JTS] (and its flagship program Con''text''); the interfaith Center for Pastoral Education at JTS; and the Tikvah Institute for Jewish Thought. By 2011, his [https://web.archive.org/web/20110402084505/http://www.jtsa.edu/Conservative_Judaism/Mitzvah_Initiative.xml Mitzvah Initiative] will involve some 75 congregations in a process of reflection upon "commandment, commandedness, and the Commander."{{citation needed|reason=Reads like PR|date=October 2014}}

==Scholarship and training==
Arnold Eisen served in the Department of Religious Studies at Stanford University, the Department of Jewish Philosophy at Tel Aviv University, and the Department of Religion at [[Columbia University]]. Dr. Eisen earned a PhD in the History of Jewish Thought from Hebrew University, a BPhil in the Sociology of Religion at [[Oxford University]], and a BA in Religious Thought from the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He was a student of Professor [[Samuel Tobias Lachs]].&lt;ref&gt;

}} Obituary.
&lt;/ref&gt; He previously served as Senior Lecturer at the [[Tel Aviv University]] and Assistant Professor at [[Columbia University]].

==Religious change==
He believes that [[American Jews]] feel connected to Jewish ritual but maintain autonomy to decide what to practice and thus many do not attend [[synagogue]] regularly.{{citation needed|reason=Claims without citations|date=October 2014}}

Eisen is a recognized expert in religious change and the modern transformation of [[Jewish]] religious belief and practice. He is also one of the world's foremost experts in the sociology of American Judaism. For the past twenty years, he has worked closely with synagogue and federation leadership around the country to analyze and address the issues of Jewish identity, the revitalization of Jewish tradition, and the redefinition of the American Jewish community.{{citation needed|reason=Claims without citations|date=October 2014}}

==Outside JTS==
Dr. Eisen sits on the board of directors of the Tanenbaum Center, the Covenant Foundation, and the Taube Foundation, and chairs the steering committee of the Academic Consortium. He is married to Dr. Adriane Leveen, a professor of the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Tanakh]]) at the [[Reform Judaism]] movement's [[Hebrew Union College]]. They have two children, Shulie, a recent graduate of [[Brandeis University]], and Nathaniel, a student at [[Stanford University]].

==Works==
His recent publications include a personal essay, ''Taking Hold of Torah: Jewish Commitment and Community in America'' (1997), which addresses the renewal of Jewish community and commitment in America through a series of five essays built around the Five Books of Moses; a historical work about the origins of contemporary dilemmas concerning these issues, entitled ''Rethinking Modern Judaism: Ritual, Commandment, Community'' (1998); and ''The Jew Within: Self, Family and Community in America'' (2000), co-authored with sociologist [[Steven M. Cohen]] (2000), which examines the meanings of Judaism and Jewish belonging to contemporary American Jews.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7022">'''Art historical photo archives''' (or photoarchives) are collections of reproductions of works of art that document paintings, drawings, prints, sculpture, architecture and sometimes installation photos. They are essential resource tools for the study of art history.  Image collections deepen understanding of specific objects of art and the careers of individual artists as they also provide the means for a comparative approach to the study of artists’ works, national schools and period styles.  The documentation that accompanies the images can also reveal patterns of art collecting, art market fluctuations and the changeable nature of public opinion.  Photo archives build their collections and gather documentation for the works of art they record through purchases, gifts and photography campaigns.  Information about ownership, condition, attribution, and subject identification is recorded at the time of acquisition and is frequently updated.

==History==

The  founders of important art historical photo archives believed that a deep and broad visual knowledge was necessary for the study of art history.   These pioneers,  including [[Richard Hamann]], [[Aby Warburg]], [[Sir Robert Witt]], [[William Martin Conway]], [[Bernard Berenson]], [[Cornelis Hofstede de Groot]] and [[Helen Clay Frick]], were the first to realize the potential of photography as a means to provide researchers with materials that strengthen the documentation and interpretation of works of art.   The photo archives they founded in the first half of the 20th century, now part of [[FotoMarburg]], the [[Warburg Institute]], the [[Witt Library]],  [[Villa I Tatti]], the [[Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie]], and the [[Frick Art Reference Library Photoarchive]],  are still used by countless researchers in the first half of the 21st century.

==Uses==

*Art historical photo archives collect images of works without regard to trends or the popular reception of any given artist’s work. They thus retain files for artists not held in high esteem but whose reputations among scholars may change in years to come.
*Many of the works of art recorded in photo archives are unpublished or relatively inaccessible since they reside in private collections or public institution storerooms.
*Art historical photo archives provide a forum for scholarly dialogue across the decades, affording art historians the opportunity to record opinions regarding attribution or current ownership of works they know well.
*As art history and art connoisseurship have matured, photo archives have played a key role, the fruits of which are most obvious in publications such as Bernard Berenson’s lists of works by Italian artists and Richard Offner’s Corpus of Florentine Painting (today continued by Miklos Boskovits).  The refinement of attributions of works of art recorded in a photo archive can lead to the reevaluation of an artist’s career or the identification of a new, previously unnamed master.  In this way, a photo archive functions in much the same way as the curatorial records of museum drawings departments, where annotations by scholars of several generations record the various attributions ascribed to the work over time.
*Photo archives aid researchers in their connoisseurship skills since they include copies, forgeries and pastiches.
*Multiple images of a single work of art help scholars trace the physical changes that have affected the object through time, damage, and conservation.  Photo archives often document the full visual record of a given work of art, information that is unlikely to be published because of financial limitations.
*Photo archives enable discovery and innovative scholarship as researchers browse within and across artist files.
*Photo archives are essential to the study of works of art that have been destroyed or lost as a result of war, fire or theft.

==Future==

In 2009 the Courtauld Institute in collaboration with the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz organized a series of conferences that were held in  London, Florence and New York to discuss the future of photo archives.  They felt that an examination of the origins of photo archives can help guide and shape their future and, at the same time, convey to the uninitiated how image resources continue to be used as essential elements for art historical research. Few doubt that if Helen Frick, Robert Witt, or W.M. Conway had lived to see the potential of digitizing the photo archives they established in the 1920s, they would have dedicated enormous resources and careful thought to realizing the digital future.  However, there is a problem for photo archives in that currently they have no copyright claim to the majority of the images in their collection and thus they are unable to display them on the web.  It is therefore now their task to develop and promote a new model for access and use of these extraordinary resources that will maximize the opportunities of current and future technical advances in a way that suits the demands of today’s scholars.  This selection process, which is implicit in digitization projects and will inevitably exclude some images, renders the analog archive as indispensable as ever in the digital era.  Whatever the method of delivery, whether the photograph itself or its digital surrogate, photo archives remain essential to the study of art history.  The conferences produced the [[Florence Declaration]], which made several recommendations for the preservation of analogue photo archives.  As of May 2011, nearly 500 scholars had signed the Declaration.

The '''Bale revolt''' or the '''Bale Peasant Movement''' was a [[guerrilla war]] in the southeastern [[Ethiopia]]n province of [[Bale Province, Ethiopia|Bale]] led by the local [[Oromo people|Oromo]] and [[Somali People|Somali]] population. The revolt targeted the settlement of the [[Amhara people]] and feudalistic system in place in the Ethiopian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mammo|first1=Tirfe|title=The Paradox of African Poverty|page=99|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-X_SuY5cteYC&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=Bale%20revolt%20in%20ethiopia&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20bale%20revolt%20was%20directed&amp;f=false|quote="The bale revolt was directed against new settlements in the region and the resultant shortage of arable land and high taxation by the central government and the land-lords"|isbn=9781569020494|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===1960 Ethiopian military coup===
{{Main|1960 Ethiopian coup attempt}}
On 13 December 1960, an attempt was made to overthrow Emperor [[Haile Selassie]]. The coup took place after the emperor left Ethiopia on a trip to [[Brazil]]. In the beginning of the revolt, rebels captured the Ethiopian capital of [[Addis Ababa]] and kidnapped the Ethiopian prince, 20 cabinet members, and many predominant politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Attempted Coup of 1960 and Its Aftermath|url=http://countrystudies.us/ethiopia/23.htm|website=Countrystudies|publisher=US LIbrary of Congress|quote=The coup was initially successful in the capital, as the rebels seized the crown prince and more than twenty cabinet ministers and other government leaders.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early stages, the coup was supported by the Imperial Guard. The Imperial Guard soon turned on the coup after the return of Emperor Haile on 17 December 1960. The forces of the Imperial Guard soon recaptured the city of [[Addis Ababa]] and freed government captives. The coup from that point on was considered a failure.

Today, some sources argue{{Weasel inline|date=August 2017}} the 1960 Ethiopian coup was the first major questioning of the Ethiopian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mammo|first1=Tirfe|title=The Paradox of African Poverty|page=99|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-X_SuY5cteYC&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=Bale%20revolt%20in%20ethiopia&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%201960%20coup%20for%20the%20first%20time%20questioned%20the%20power%20of%20the%20king%20to%20rule%20without%20the%20peoples%20consent.%22&amp;f=false|quote="The 1960 coup for the first time questioned the power of the king to rule without the peoples consent."|isbn=9781569020494|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethiopian Student Movement===
The movement began in the early 1960s. University students in Ethiopia questioned the government and monarchical rule. The small rebellion turned into a full-fledged student movement by 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethiopian students protest against Emperor Selaisse's regime, 1967-1974|url=http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/ethiopian-students-protest-against-emperor-selaisses-regime-1967-1974|website=Swarthmore|publisher=NV Data Base Swarthmore|quote="...unrest began to boil among the university students in the early 1960s, becoming a full-fledged student movement by 1967. Students began their push for political and social change and participation subtly in the form of poetry."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters were often determined to destroy and dismantle the entrenched feudal order to significantly improve the political and economic modernization of Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gemeda|first1=Guluma|title=Haile Selassie, Western Education, and Political Revolution in Ethiopia (review)|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nas/summary/v010/10.1.gemeda.html|website=Project MUSE|publisher=MUSE|quote="He belongs to a generation of students who believed in dismantling the entrenched feudal order to facilitate the political and economic modernization of Ethiopia."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many protesters partook in frequent and violence-oriented
verbal attacks on African governments for their corruption and abuse
of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balsvik |first1=Randi |title=Student Protest – University and State in Africa 1960–1995 |url=https://mercury.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/27565/ichaptersection_singledocument/f02100d1-af6c-43d7-89bb-090f8ab08f00/en/1998_02_e.pdf |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141226101358/http://mercury.ethz.ch/serviceengine/Files/ISN/27565/ichaptersection_singledocument/f02100d1-af6c-43d7-89bb-090f8ab08f00/en/1998_02_e.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-12-26 |website=ETH Zürich |quote="A prominent aspect of student protests was the frequent and violent verbal attacks on African governments for their corruption and abuse of power to enrich themselves and their families to the detriment of the country at large." }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement ended in 1974 and the [[Ethiopian Civil War]] began soon after.

==Revolt==
The revolt is believed to have started as a result of many peasants in the southeastern region of Ethiopia, primarily composed of the [[Oromo people]] and [[Somali people|Somali]] [[tribesmen]], refusing to pay taxes and allow access to land to the Ethiopian government. The peasants also had strong opposition of the settlement of the [[Amhara people]] in Bale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicolas|first1=Gildas|title=Protest in Ethiopia|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/18d681jd#page-15|page=55|website=Escholarship|publisher=UCLA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolt was led by [[Oromo people|Oromo]] leader and rebel figure [[Waqo Gutu]] and supported by the [[Somali Republic|Somali government]]. Waqo Gutu is believed to have started the rebellion when he received no government aid after a conflict over grazing rights. After receiving no aid, he went to Somalia to supply himself and other rebels with weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Marina and David Ottaway, ''Ethiopia: Empire in Revolution'' (New York: Africana, 1978), pp. 92f&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the landmark battles at Malka Anna near [[Ganale River]] in 1963, the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] combatants took down two military helicopters using a non-automatic rifle called Dhombir. Hence, the period from 1963 to 1970 is locally known as  the Dhombir war after the gun used by the Oromo fighters. The battle of Dhombir at Malka Anna was critical in that the rebels were able to capture and take a lot of weapons from the enemy thereby boosting their defensive capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Commemorating 50 Years of Oromo Struggle led by General Waqo Gutu|url = http://www.opride.com/oromsis/news/horn-of-africa/3717-commemorating-50-years-of-oromo-struggle-led-by-waqo-gutu|website = OPride – News and Views from the Horn of Africa|access-date = 2016-02-19|first = Mohammed|last = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 Somalia withdrew support for the rebellion after [[Somali Democratic Republic|changing government]].Soon after, an agreement was reached with the Ethiopian government and many predominant Oromo leaders were pardoned marking the end of the conflict.

The '''Bilsæte''' ("dwellers of the ridge") were a tribe or clan in [[Anglo-Saxon]] England living in an area surrounding a small ridge now occupied by the modern settlement of [[Bilston]] in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] of [[England]].

A grant of land from [[King Aethelred]] bestowing Wolverhampton on Lady [[Wulfrun]] in 985 named the settlement as ''Bilsatena'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&amp;type=charter&amp;id=860 ''Charter S 860'']&lt;/ref&gt; and a later [[Anglo-Saxon charters|Anglo-Saxon charter]] of 996 calls the settlement ''Bilsetnatun''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&amp;id=1380&amp;type=charter ''Charter S 1380'']&lt;/ref&gt; These names confirm the etymology (dwelling (''tun'') of the people (''saetna'') of the ridge (''bil''),&lt;ref name=Johnston&gt;Johnston, James B. (1915) ''The Place-Names of England and Wales''. London: John Murray&lt;/ref&gt; and disproves the alternative and better known etymology for Bilston (''Billestun'').

'''''Collateral Damage''''' is a 2002 American [[action thriller]] film directed by [[Andrew Davis (director)|Andrew Davis]] and starring [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Elias Koteas]], [[Francesca Neri]], [[Cliff Curtis]], [[John Leguizamo]] and [[John Turturro]]. The film was released in the United States on February 8, 2002.

The film tells the story of [[Los Angeles]] firefighter, Gordon Brewer (Arnold Schwarzenegger), who seeks to avenge his son and wife's death at the hands of a guerrilla commando, by traveling to [[Colombia]] and facing his family's killers. The original script for the film had the same plotline but would have addressed American policy in the Middle East by taking place in [[Libya]]; director Davis and his screenwriters chose Colombia as the new location because it had not been used as extensively and touched on a current geopolitical conflict area. Noted [[anti-war]] activist [[Stan Goff]] was hired as a consultant but later described the film as horrible and stated that taking on the job was the worst mistake he had ever made.

==Plot==
A bomb detonates in the plaza of the [[Colombia]]n Consulate building in [[Los Angeles]], killing nine people, including a caravan of Colombian officials and American intelligence agents. Among the civilians killed are the wife and son of [[Los Angeles City Fire Department|LAFD]] firefighter, Captain Gordon "Gordy" Brewer, who was injured in the explosion. A tape is sent to the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], in which a masked man calling himself ''"El Lobo"'' (''The Wolf'') claims responsibility, explaining it was in retaliation for the oppression of Colombia by the United States. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] believes ''El Lobo'' is a Colombian terrorist named Claudio Perrini. [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Special Agent Peter Brandt, the Colombia Station Chief, is harshly reprimanded for the incident by a [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Oversight Committee]], which promptly terminates all CIA operations in Colombia. Brandt angrily returns to [[Santa Cruz de Mompox|Mompós]] and meets with his paramilitary allies to plan a major offensive to take down Claudio.

Frustrated at the political [[red tape]] regarding the investigation, Brewer travels to Mompós to personally hunt down Claudio but is quickly arrested for illegal entry. The guerrillas stage a prison break to free their comrades and abduct Brewer to demand a large ransom for him. Brandt's unit is alerted to Brewer's presence in Colombia but arrive too late. Brewer escapes the prison, avoids being captured, and secures a guerrilla zone pass from Canadian mechanic Sean Armstrong. Armstrong introduces him to drug runner Felix Ramirez, the manager of the cocaine distribution facility that finances the guerrillas. Pretending to be a mechanic, Brewer rigs several [[improvised explosive device|improvised explosives]] and destroys the facility. Felix is blamed for the destruction of the drug plant and is executed in front of a hiding Brewer's eyes. Brewer infiltrates Claudio's headquarters and plants a bomb to kill him, but he is captured when he tries to prevent a woman, Selena, from being caught in the blast radius along with her son, Mauro. At Claudio's home compound, Selena reveals she is Claudio's wife. She and Claudio once lost their own child during an American attack, which compelled Claudio to become a terrorist; Selena found and adopted Mauro, whose parents were killed in the attack. Nevertheless, Selena sympathizes with Brewer and admits that Claudio is planning another bombing in [[Washington, D.C.]].

Meanwhile, Brandt's unit locates Claudio's compound and launches an attack. During the ensuing shootout, Selena helps free Brewer and, along with Brandt, travels back to the State Department in Washington, D.C. to help the search effort for Claudio. Selena identifies [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] as the target, and the FBI investigates. On the pretense of using the lavatory, Selena excuses herself from the command room and becomes irritated when Mauro refuses to come with her. When Brewer sees Selena make the same gesture as the masked man who claimed to be El Lobo in the tape, he realizes that she was the Wolf all along, and Claudio serves as her figurehead, and that the entire motive behind their cause is personal revenge for the death of their daughter at the hands of the US. Furthermore, Brewer surmises the real target is the State Department, and that he was used to help Selena get past the building's security. Brewer quickly throws Mauro's toy dinosaur, which is carrying a bomb, out a window moments before it explodes. Brandt, realizing Brewer's suspicions, is shot and killed trying to stop Selena from fleeing the building.

Brewer chases Selena to the basement of the building where she and Claudio ride off through the underground tunnels on a motorcycle. Brewer finds the tunnel control console and shuts the gates, preventing their escape. Brewer chops open some gas lines along the walls of the tunnel and, as they ride back, Selena shoots at Brewer, igniting the gas. Brewer jumps through a doorway just as the entire tunnel explodes. Selena and Claudio survive the blast, however, and attack him simultaneously. After a short, hand-to-hand fight, Selena is electrocuted by being tossed on the exposed circuitry of the control panel, and Claudio is finally killed when Brewer throws an axe into his chest. 

In the aftermath, Brewer carries Mauro in his arms as they leave the State Department. A newscast voiceover explains that Brewer will receive the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] for preventing one of the worst terrorist attacks in U.S. history from taking place.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5039">[[File:Chateau-de-Gisors.jpg|thumb|Castle at Gisors]]
The '''cutting of the elm''' was a diplomatic altercation between the kings of France and England in 1188, during which an [[elm]] tree near [[Gisors]] in [[Normandy]] was felled.

==Diplomatic significance==
[[File:Map_France_1180-fr.svg|thumb|France in 1180. The [[King of England]] held all the red territories. Gisors lay in the [[Vexin]], between Anglo-Norman land and the [[royal domain]].]]
In the 12th century, the tree marked the traditional place of Franco-Norman negotiations, as the field was located on the border between Normandy, ruled by the English king, and the royal domains of the French king.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Vincent, "[http://www.deremilitari.org/RESOURCES/ARTICLES/vincent.htm William Marshal, King Henry II and the Honour of Chateauroux]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.L. Warren, ''Henry II'', Yale University Press, p. 617.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accounts==

One account&lt;ref name="Foundations"&gt;Bradford Smith, ''The Foundations of the West - Course Material'', "[http://www.oglethorpe.edu/faculty/~b_smith/ou/bs_foundations_chapter8.htm Chapter 8 The Age of the Crusades - The Rise of France under Philip Augustus and of St. Louis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612192810/http://www.oglethorpe.edu/faculty/~b_smith/ou/bs_foundations_chapter8.htm |date=2008-06-12 }}".&lt;/ref&gt; narrates the meeting between [[Henry II of England|King Henry II of England]] and [[Philip II of France|King Philip II of France]] in 1188, following the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|fall of Jerusalem]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;At Gisors, Henry II and his advisers stood under an Elm tree while Philip and his entourage suffered in the full heat of the sun. After the meeting, Philip ordered the tree cut down and hacked to pieces, sending the message that he would offer no quarter to the English.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A quite different account is given by the [[Minstrel of Rheims]] (c. 1260), a thirteenth-century historical fiction:&lt;ref name="Minstrel"&gt;''[http://people.bu.edu/robbe/reims.htm A Thirteenth-Century Minstrel's Chronicle, a translation by Robert Levine of the Récits d'un ménestrel de Reims, a thirteenth-century historical fiction]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Richard I of England|King Richard]] sent a message to the counts of [[Sancerre]] and of [[Barre, Tarn|Barre]], telling them that they took the king's bread and gave him nothing in return but if they were brave enough to come to the elm tree at Gisors, he would consider them truly courageous. The French nobles sent the message back that they would come the next day, at the third hour, to cut the tree down, in spite of him. When the English king heard that they were coming to cut down the tree, he had the trunk reinforced with bands of iron, that were wrapped five times around it. The next morning the French nobles armed themselves, and assembled five squadrons of their men, one of which was led by the count of Sancerre, another by the count of [[Chartres]], the third by the count of [[Vendôme]], the fourth by the count of [[Nevers]], and the fifth by Sir William of Barre and Sir Alain of Roucy. They rode up to the elm tree at Gisors, with the crossbowmen and carpenters out front, and they had in their hands sharp axes and good pointed hammers, with which to cut the bands that were fastened around the tree. They stopped at the elm tree, tore off the bands, and cut it down, in spite of all resistance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Popular culture==

The event has been used in the history proposed by [[Pierre Plantard]] and other pseudo-historical theories. In this context, the ''Cutting of the elm'' was portrayed as marking the split between the [[Knights Templar]] and the [[Priory of Sion]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3843">'''Donna Carol Kurtz''' is an American classicist specializing in Greek art.  Born in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], she took her BA at the [[University of Cincinnati]] and her MA as a Woodrow Wilson Scholar at [[Yale]].  She read for a DPhil at [[Somerville College]] of the [[University of Oxford]] with a Marshall Scholarship, which she received in 1968 with her thesis ''The iconography of the Athenian white-ground lekythos'' under the supervision of Martin Robertson.  This formed the partial basis for her first individual monograph, ''Athenian white lekythoi: patterns and painters'',&lt;ref&gt;Oxford, Clarendon Press 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; a standard reference work for the [[white ground technique|white-ground]] lekythos.

After the death of [[John Beazley|Sir John Beazley]] in 1970, Kurtz organised his books, papers, notebooks, drawings and photographs to form the Beazley Archive,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/archive/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt; initially kept at the [[Ashmolean Museum]], and was named Beazley Archivist, a chair created for her.  The post is connected to [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson College]], where she remains a fellow. As Professor of Classical Art at the University, she lectured and tutored until her retirement in 2011.

Her scholarly output, especially in the first decades of her career, focussed on [[Greek pottery]].  Collaborations with [[Sir John Boardman|John Boardman (art historian)]] on ''Greek Burial Customs''&lt;ref&gt;London, Thames &amp; Hudson 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; and Brian Sparkes (edd.) on ''The Eye of Greece: studies in the art of Athens''&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, CUP 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; expanded the topics on which she wrote.  Her interest in the work of Beazley produced several articles and a posthumous collaboration in ''The Berlin Painter'',&lt;ref&gt;Oxford, Clarendon Press 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; which uses Beazley's drawings as the basis of study of anatomy and connoisseurship.  From 2000, with the publication of ''The reception of classical art in Britain: an Oxford story of plaster casts from the antique''&lt;ref&gt;Oxford, Beazley Archive: Archaeopress.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Reception of classical art: an introduction'',&lt;ref&gt;Oxford, Archaeopress 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; she has moved into the history of collections more fully.

== Digital projects ==

From 1979, the Beazley Archive was digitized, in collaboration with [[IBM]] and others.  Put on-line in 1998, it was one of the earliest large data-sets available; as the Classical Art Research Centre ([http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/index.htm CARC]) it now contains over 100,000 records.

In 2000, Kurtz launched CLAROS, the Classical Art Research Online Services,&lt;ref&gt;http://explore.clarosnet.org/XDB/ASP/clarosHome/about.html&lt;/ref&gt; an umbrella that included the Beazley archive as well as similar archives and research centres across Europe.  In 2007, she upgraded the database using [[semantic web]] technologies, in collaboration with the Oxford e-Research Centre (where she is now a senior researcher) and the Oxford Internet Institute (where she is now a research associate); the [http://explore.clarosnet.org/XDB/ASP/clarosHome/index.html site] went live in 2011.  It includes not only the original data from the Beazley Archive but also records of eastern ceramics, eastern and western sculpture, gems, drawings and photographs.

From 2013, Kurtz has helmed the Oxford [http://www.culturalheritage.ox.ac.uk/about|Cultural Heritage Programme], a collaboration between several divisions, incorporating conservation, commerce and law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4948">'''Dvorah Barzilay-Yegar''' (born 1933) is an Israeli historian, who has carried out many years of scholarly research into the life and political activities of [[Chaim Weizmann]], the first [[President of Israel]].

==Biography==

===Education===
Barzilay  was brought up in [[Rehovoth]], where she had her elementary and secondary education. She obtained her B.A. at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], in the Faculties of History and Sociology. Barzilay  served as a Lieutenant in the Israeli army's Department of History. When discharged, she obtained her M.A. at the Hebrew University in the Faculties of History and Jewish History. Following a period of research in England, she returned to Israel and was granted a Ph.D. Her doctoral work was on "A National Home for the Jewish People – The Concept in British Political Thinking and Policy Making, 1917–1923". At the same time, she studied at the Faculty of Education of the Hebrew University and was granted a Teaching Certificate. She then taught History at the secondary school in Rehovoth during 1958–1960.

===Academic activities===
In the years 1961–1974, Barzilay was a researcher and research editor on the Editorial Board of Weizmann's Letters and Papers, Jerusalem, and the Weizmann Archives in Rehovoth. In the years 1966–1969 she lived in London, where she was sent by the editorial board of Weizmann's letters and papers, to carry out research and to retrieve material at the British archives about Weizmann's activities during [[World War I]], especially in connection with the [[Balfour Declaration]]. She also published articles on this subject. On her return to Israel, she edited Volumes VII and VIII of Weizmann's letters which were later published in Hebrew and English.

In the years 1974–1980 Barzilay was research director and editor of Samuel Tolkowsky's "Zionist Political Diary, London 1915–1919, on the Making of Balfour Declaration" published (in Hebrew) by the Institute of Zionist Research at [[Tel-Aviv University]] and the [[Zionist Library]], Jerusalem.

In the years 1974–1985, Barzilay was research director and editor of the survey of archival sources of the history of [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate]] in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], 1914–1948, a project sponsored and financed by the [[Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] in Jerusalem, Israel (in collaboration with the [[British Academy]]). The results were later produced in a disk.

==Personal==
In 1979 Dvorah Barzilay married [[Moshe Yegar]], an historian and diplomat in the service of Israel's Foreign Office, and eventually joined him on his Foreign Office postings as Consul General in New York, and ambassador in Stockholm and Prague. In New York she taught as Adjunct Professor at [[Queens College of the City University of New York]], in Sweden she took part in academic conferences and in the Czech Republic she taught as Visiting Professor at [[Charles University in Prague]] and took part in academic conferences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2932">'''Emil von Ottenthal''' (15 June 1855, in [[Sand in Taufers]] &amp;ndash; 5 February 1931, in [[Vienna]]) was an Austrian historian and [[archivist]].

He studied history under [[Alfons Huber]] at the [[University of Innsbruck]] and with [[Theodor von Sickel]] at the Institut für Österreichische Geschichtsforschung (Institute for Austrian Historical Research) in [[University of Vienna|Vienna]]. In 1880 he obtained his [[habilitation]] for history at Innsbruck, and from 1882 was associated with the Austrian Historical Institute in [[Rome]]. From 1888 to 1912, with [[Oswald Redlich]], he published the ''Archiv-Berichte aus Tirol'' ("Archive Reports of [[History of Tyrol|Tyrol]]").&lt;ref name=AU&gt;[http://www.biographien.ac.at/oebl/oebl_O/Ottenthaler-Ottenthal_Emil_1855_1931.xml Ottenthaler von Ottenthal, Emil (1855-1931)] Österreichisches Biographisches Lexikon und biographische Dokumentation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DB&gt;[https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/gnd11717078X.html#ndbcontent Ottenthal, Emil (Ottenthaler) von] In: [[Neue Deutsche Biographie]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889 he became an associate professor at the University of Innsbruck, where in 1893 he attained a full professorship. In 1904 he succeeded [[Engelbert Mühlbacher]] as professor and director of the Institute for Austrian Historical Research in Vienna. From 1904 to 1926 he was a member of the central management of [[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]].&lt;ref name=AU/&gt;&lt;ref name=DB/&gt;

==Change of era==
* {{nihongo|'''''Genki gannen'''''|元亀元年}}; 1570: The era name was changed because of various wars. The previous era ended and a new one commenced in ''Eiroku'' 13, on the 23rd day of the 4th month.

==Events of the ''Genki'' era==
* '''1570''' (''Genki 1, 6th month''): The combined forces of the [[Azai clan]], led by [[Azai Nagamasa]], and the [[Asakura clan]], led by [[Asakura Yoshikage]], met the forces of [[Oda Nobunaga]] in a shallow riverbed which has come to be known as the [[Battle of Anegawa]]. [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] led forces which came to the aid of Oda's army; and Oda claimed the victory.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA388,M1  p. 388.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1571''' (''Genki 2, 9th month''): Nobunaga marched into [[Ōmi Province]] at the head of his army which surrounded Mt. Hiei. He massacred the priests and everyone else associated with the mountain temples; and then he gave orders that every structure on the mountain should be burned.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA388,M1  pp. 388–389.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1572''' (''Genki 3, 12th month''): [[Takeda Shingen]], the ''[[daimyō]]'' of [[Kai Province]], led his army into [[Tōtōmi Province]]  where he engaged the forces of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] at the [[Battle of Mikatagahara]].&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA389,M1  p. 389.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1573''' (''Genki 4, 2nd month''): Yoshinaka began to fortify Nijō Castle; and he sent messages to [[Azai Nagamasa]], [[Asakura Yoshikage]], and [[Takeda Shingen]], announcing his intention to engage Nobunaga.&lt;ref&gt;Hisashi, Fujiki ''et al.''

==Historical revisionism==
From 1995 Gleb Nosovsky is permanent co-author of books on the [[New Chronology (Fomenko-Nosovsky)|New Chronology]].
#Together with Kalashnikov and [[Anatoly Fomenko]] dated the [[Almagest]] of [[Claudius Ptolemy]] to around eleven and sixteenth century.
#Together with Fomenko dated some old Egyptian horoscopes ranging them from 1000 AD and up to as late as 1700 AD.
#In 2003, together with Fomenko used astronomical methods to calculate that [[Jesus]] lived in the 1152–1185 AD.
Most Russian scientists consider the New Chronology to be [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref name="bul1"&gt;[http://klnran.ru/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/VZN_01.pdf Bulletin "In defence of science" #1 (2006)] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] (in Russian) [http://www.ras.ru/FStorage/Download.aspx?id=163a672e-d17d-43fe-b57f-b5f8e7db7abf download in PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bul2"&gt;[http://klnran.ru/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/VZN_02.pdf Bulletin "In defence of science" #2 (2007)] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] (in Russian) [http://www.ras.ru/FStorage/Download.aspx?id=7f117c9a-ec2d-4c3b-aff3-2fcbaf550cbb download in PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Romani people}}
The [[Romani people]], also referred to depending on the sub-group as '''Roma''', '''[[Sinti]]''' or '''Sindhi''', or '''Kale''' are an [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] [[ethnic group]], who live primarily in [[Europe]]. They originated in northwest regions of the [[Indian subcontinent]]&lt;ref name="kenrick_intro"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kenrick|first=Donald|title=Historical Dictionary of the Gypsies (Romanies)|edition=2nd|url=http://chapters.scarecrowpress.com/08/108/0810854686ch1.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2007|page=xxxvii-xxxviii|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kenrick|first=Donald|title=Historical Dictionary of the Gypsies (Romanies)|edition=2nd|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2007|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/25294-origin-romani-people.html|title=Origin of the Romani People Pinned Down|work=LiveScience.com|author=Stephanie Pappas|date=6 December 2012|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left sometime between the 6th and 11th century to work in Middle Eastern courts of their own volition, or as slaves. A small number of nomadic groups were cut off from their return to the subcontinent by conflicts and moved west,&lt;ref name="kenrick_intro" /&gt; eventually settling in [[Europe]], [[Turkey]] and [[North Africa]] via [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kenrick|first=Donald|title=Historical Dictionary of the Gypsies (Romanies)|edition=2nd|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2007|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[File:Spiezer Schilling 749.jpg|thumb|250px|The initial arrival of Romani outside [[Bern]] in the 15th century, described by the chronicler as ''getoufte heiden'' "baptized heathens" and drawn wearing [[Saracen]]e style clothes and weapons ([[Spiezer Schilling]], p. 749).]]
The Romani have been described by [[Diana Muir|Diana Muir Appelbaum]] as unique among peoples because they have never identified themselves with a territory; they have no tradition of an ancient and distant homeland from which their ancestors migrated, nor do they claim the right to national sovereignty in any of the lands where they reside. Rather, Romani identity is bound up with the ideal of freedom expressed, in part, in having no ties to a homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, Diana, "[https://www.the-american-interest.com/2011/03/01/the-rootless-roma/ The Rootless Roma]", [[The American Interest]]&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of traditional origin stories and of a written history has meant that the origin and early history of the Romani people was long an enigma. Indian origin was suggested on linguistic grounds as early as the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-631-19605-1|title=Gypsies (Peoples of Europe)|edition=2nd|first=Angus|last=Fraser|publisher=Blackwell, Oxford|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory suggests that the name ultimately derives from a form ''[[Domba|ḍōmba]]-'' 'man of low caste living by singing and music', attested in [[Classical Sanskrit]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ralph L. Turner, ''A comparative dictionary of the Indo-Aryan languages'', p. 314. London: Oxford University Press, 1962-6.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative view is that the ancestors of the Romani were part of the military in [[North India|Northern India]]. When there were invasions by [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi]] and these soldiers were defeated, they were moved west with their families into the [[Byzantine Empire]] between AD 1000 and 1030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radoc.net/radoc.php?doc=art_b_history_origins&amp;lang=en&amp;articles=|title=On Romani Origins and Identity|publisher=RADOC|author=Ian Hancock|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genetic evidence identified an [[India]]n origin for Roma.&lt;ref name="Isabel"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130111094521/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982212012602 Isabel Mendizabal and 21 others, "Reconstructing the Population History of European Romani from Genome-wide Data"], ''Current Biology'', Available online 6 December 2012, accessed 12 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Comas"&gt;"Genomic Study Traces Roma to Northern India", ''New York Times'', 11 December 2012. Findings recently reported also in ''Current Biology''.&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic evidence connects the [[Romani people]] to the descendants of groups which emigrated from [[South Asia]] towards [[Central Asia]] during the medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;Hancock, Ian. Ame Sam e Rromane Džene/We are the Romani people. p. 13. {{ISBN|1-902806-19-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language origins===
Until the mid-to-late 18th century, theories of the origin of the Romani were mostly speculative. In 1782, Johann Christian Christoph Rüdiger published his research that pointed out the relationship between the [[Romani language]] and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llc.manchester.ac.uk/Research/Projects/romani/downloads/1/ruediger_translation.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929115310/http://www.llc.manchester.ac.uk/Research/Projects/romani/downloads/1/ruediger_translation.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-09-29|title=On the Indic Language and Origin of the Gypsies|first=Johann Christian Christoph|last=Rüdiger|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent work supported the hypothesis that Romani shared a common origin with the Indo-Aryan languages of Northern India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://romani.uni-graz.at/romani/ling/rom_gen.en.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050217161146/http://romani.uni-graz.at/romani/ling/rom_gen.en.shtml|archivedate=17 February 2005|first=Dieter W.|last=Halwachs|title=Romani - An Attempting Overview|date=21 April 2004|accessdate=26 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Romani grouping most closely with [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]] in a recent study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v426/n6965/pdf/nature02029.pdf|last1=Gray|first1=R.D.|last2=Atkinson|first2=Q.D.|title=Language-tree divergence times support the Anatolian theory of Indo-European origin|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Domari and Romani language====
{{Main|Domari language}}
[[Domari]] was once thought to be the "sister language" of Romani, the two languages having split after the departure from the [[South Asia]], but more recent research suggests that the differences between them are significant enough to treat them as two separate languages within the [[Central zone]] ([[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]) [[Saraiki language]] group of languages. The Dom and the Rom are therefore likely to be descendants of two different migration waves from the Indian subcontinent, separated by several centuries.&lt;ref name = What_is_Domari&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Domari?|url=http://romani.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/atmanchester/projects/domari.shtml|accessdate=23 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ROMANI_ORIGINS&gt;{{cite web|title=On romani origins and identity|url=http://www.radoc.net/radoc.php?doc=art_b_history_origins&amp;lang=en&amp;articles=true|accessdate=23 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rom-Dom numerals}}

===Genetic evidence===
Further evidence for the South Asian origin of the Romanies came in the late 1990s.  Researchers doing DNA analysis discovered that Romani populations carried large frequencies of particular [[Y chromosome]]s (inherited paternally) and [[mitochondrial DNA]] (inherited maternally) that otherwise exist only in populations from [[South Asia]].

47.3% of Romani men carry Y chromosomes of [[Haplogroup H (Y-DNA)#Distribution of H-M82 (H1a)|haplogroup H-M82]] which is rare outside [[South Asia]].&lt;ref name="kalaydjieva"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/bies.20287|title=A Newly Discovered Founder Population: The Roma/Gypsies|author=Kalaydjieva, L.|author2=Morar, B|author3=Chaix, R.|author4=Tang, H.|journal=BioEssays|volume=27|year=2005|pages=1084–1094|pmid=16163730|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitochondrial [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|haplogroup M]], most common in Indian subjects and rare outside Southern Asia, accounts for nearly 30% of Romani people.&lt;ref name="kalaydjieva"/&gt; A more detailed study of Polish Roma shows this to be of the M5 lineage, which is specific to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1111/j.1529-8817.2005.00222.x|title=Mitochondrial DNA Diversity in the Polish Roma|author1=Malyarchuk, B.A|author2=Grzybowski, T|author3=Derenko, M.V|author4=Czarny, J.|author5=Miscicka-Slivvka, D.|journal=Annals of Human Genetics|volume=70|pages=195–206|year=2006|pmid=16626330|issue=Pt 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, a form of the inherited disorder [[Congenital myasthenic syndrome|congenital myasthenia]] is found in Romani subjects.

A study from 2001 by Gresham et al. suggests "a limited number of related founders, compatible with a small group of migrants splitting from a distinct caste or tribal group".&lt;ref name="David_Gresham"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Origins and Divergence of the Roma (Gypsies)|pmid=11704928|year=2001|last1=Gresham|first1=D.|last2=Morar|first2=B.|last3=Underhill|first3=P.

====Connection with the Burushos and Pamiris====
The [[Burusho people|Burushos]] of [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]] have a paternal lineage genetic marker that is grouped with [[Pamiri languages|Pamiri]] speakers from [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tajikistan]], and the [[Sinti]] or Sindhi Romani ethnic group. This find of shared genetic haplogroups may indicate an origin of the Romani people in or around these regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/98/18/10244.full The Eurasian Heartland: A continental perspective on Y-chromosome diversity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221204211/http://www.pnas.org/content/98/18/10244.full |date=21 December 2016 }}, ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A mtdna or ydna study provides valuable information but a limitation of these studies is that they represent only one instantiation of the genealogical process. Autosomal data permits simultaneous analysis of multiple lineages, which can provide novel information about population history. According to a genetic study on autosomal data on Roma the source of Southasian Ancestry in Roma is North-West India. The two populations showing closest relatedness to Roma were Gujaratis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160115082108/http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.1696v1.pdf Moorjani et al.

==Early records==
Many ancient historians mention a tribe by the name of [[Sigynnae]] (Tsigani) on various locations in Europe. Early records of itinerant populations from India begin as early as the [[Sassanid]] period. Donald Kenrick notes the first recorded presence of ''[[Zott]]'' in [[Baghdad]] in AD 420, [[Khaneikin]] in AD 834.&lt;ref name="kenrick"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kenrick|first=Donald|title=Historical Dictionary of the Gypsies (Romanies)|edition=2nd|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary scholars have suggested one of the first written references to the Romanies, under the term ''"[[Athinganoi|Atsingani]]"'', (derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ἀτσίγγανοι - atsinganoi''), dates from the [[Byzantine]] era during a time of famine in the 9th century. In the year AD 800, [[Athanasia of Aegina|Saint Athanasia]] gave food to "foreigners called the Atsingani" near [[Thrace]]. Later, in AD 803, [[Theophanes the Confessor]] wrote that Emperor [[Nicephorus I|Nikephoros I]] had the help of the ''"Atsingani"'' to put down a riot with their "knowledge of magic". However, the Atsingani were a Manichean sect that disappeared from chronicles in the 11th century. ''"Atsinganoi"'' was used to refer to itinerant fortune tellers, ventriloquists and wizards who visited the Emperor [[Constantine IX]] in the year 1054.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuviyam.com/scr/index.asp?pLang=E&amp;pHead=90&amp;pMenu=1&amp;pIssue=31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101044043/http://www.kuviyam.com/scr/index.asp?pLang=E&amp;pHead=90&amp;pMenu=1&amp;pIssue=31|archivedate=1 November 2006|title=The Lost Tribes of India|author=Jeetan Sareen|publisher=Kuviyam Canada Inc|date=2002–2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[hagiographical]] text, ''The Life of St. George the Anchorite,'' mentions that the ''"Atsingani"'' were called on by Constantine to help rid his forests of the wild animals which were killing off his livestock.

==Arrival in Europe==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2018}}
[[File:Movimiento gitano.jpg|thumb|450px|The migration of the Romani people through the [[Middle East]] and [[Northern Africa]] to Europe.  The key shows the century of arrival in that area, e.g. ''S.XII'' is the 12th century]]
In 1323 [[Simon Simeonis]], an Irish Franciscan monk, described people in likeness to the "atsingani" living in [[Crete]]: ''We also saw outside this city &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Heraklion|Candia]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; a tribe of people, who worship according to the [[Byzantine Rite|Greek rite]], and assert themselves to be of the race of [[Cain]]. These people rarely or never stop in one place for more than thirty days, but always, as if cursed by God, are nomad and outcast. After the thirtieth day they wander from field to field with small, oblong, black, and low tents, like those of the [[Arabs]], and from cave to cave, because the place inhabited by them becomes after the term of thirty days so full of [[vermin]] and other filth that it is impossible to live in their neighbourhood.''&lt;ref&gt;https://celt.ucc.ie//published/T300002-001/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

1350 [[Ludolf von Sudheim]] mentioned a similar people with a unique language whom he called ''Mandapolos'', a word which some theorize was possibly derived from the Greek word ''Mantipolos - Μαντιπόλος''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.florilegium.org/files/CULTURES/Gypsies-msg.html|title=Gypsies-msg|publisher=Stefan's Florilegium|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aalphabetic+letter%3D*m%3Aentry+group%3D4%3Aentry%3Dmantipo%2Flos frenzied]" from ''mantis - μάντις'' (meaning "[[prophet]], [[fortune teller]]") and ''poleo - πολέω''.

Around 1360, a [[fiefdom]] (called the ''[[Feudum Acinganorum]]'') was established in [[Corfu]].

By the 14th century, the Romanies had reached the [[Balkans]] and [[Bohemia]]; by the 15th century, [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]; and by the 16th century, [[Russia]], [[Denmark]], [[Scotland]] and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name = "kenrick"/&gt; (although DNA evidence from mid-11th century skeletons in [[Norwich]] suggest that at least a few individuals may have arrived earlier, perhaps due to [[Viking]] enslavement of Romani from the eastern [[Mediterranean]] or liaisons with the [[Varangians]]&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, M.

Many Romanies also settled in [[Latin America]].

According to historian [[Norman Davies]], a 1378 law passed by the governor of [[Nauplion]] in the Greek [[Peloponnese]] confirming privileges for the "atsingani" is "the first documented record of Romany Gypsies in Europe".  Similar documents, again representing the Romanies as a group that had been exiled from Egypt, record them reaching [[Braşov]], [[Transylvania]] in 1416; [[Hamburg]], [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1418; and [[Paris]] in 1427.  A chronicler for a Parisian journal described them as dressed in a manner that the Parisians considered shabby, and reports that the Church had them leave town because they practiced [[Chiromancy|palm-reading]] and [[fortune-telling]].&lt;ref name="Norman Davies 1996 387–388"&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman Davies|authorlink=Norman Davies|title=Europe: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vD7SWb5lXBAC&amp;pg=PA387|accessdate=16 December 2014|edition=2nd|year=1997|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4070-9179-2|pages=387–388|chapter=Christendom in crisis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their early history shows a mixed reception. Although 1385 marks the first recorded transaction for a Romani slave in [[Wallachia]], they were issued safe conduct by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1417.&lt;ref name = "kenrick"/&gt; Romanies were ordered expelled from the [[Meissen]] region of Germany in 1416, [[Lucerne]] in 1471, [[Milan]] in 1493, [[France]] in 1504, [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] in 1512, [[Sweden]] in 1525, [[Kingdom of England|England]] in 1530 (see [[Egyptians Act 1530]]), and [[Denmark]] in 1536.&lt;ref name = "kenrick"/&gt; In 1510, any Romani found in Switzerland were ordered to be put to death, with similar rules established in England in 1554, Denmark in 1589, and Sweden in 1637, whereas [[Portugal]] began deportations of Romanies to its colonies in 1538.&lt;ref name = "kenrick"/&gt;

Later, a 1596 English statute, however, gave Romanies special privileges that other wanderers lacked; France passed a similar law in 1683. [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great of Russia]] declared the Romanies "crown slaves" (a status superior to [[serfs]]), but also kept them out of certain parts of [[St. Petersburg, Russia|the capital]].&lt;ref name="Norman Davies 1996 387–388"/&gt; In 1595, [[Ştefan Răzvan]] overcame his birth into slavery, and became the [[Voivode]] [[List of Moldavian rulers|(Prince) of Moldavia]].&lt;ref name = "kenrick"/&gt;

In [[Wallachia]], [[Transylvania]] and [[Moldavia]], Romanies were enslaved for five centuries, until [[abolitionism|abolition]] in the mid-19th century.

In the late 19th century, the Romani culture inspired in their neighbors a wealth of artistic works.  Among the most notable works are ''[[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]]'' and ''[[La Vie de Bohème]]''.&lt;ref name="Norman Davies 1996 387–388"/&gt;

===Settlement===
In 1758, [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] began a program of assimilation to turn  Romanies into ''ujmagyar'' (new Hungarians). The government built permanent huts to replace mobile tents, forbade travel, and forcefully removed children from their parents to be fostered by non-Romani.&lt;ref name="kenrick"/&gt; By 1894, the majority of Romanies counted in a Hungarian national census were sedentary. In 1830, Romani children in [[Nordhausen]] were taken from their families to be fostered by Germans.&lt;ref name="kenrick"/&gt;

Russia also encouraged settlement of all nomads in 1783, and the Polish introduced a settlement law in 1791. Bulgaria and Serbia banned nomadism in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="kenrick"/&gt;

In 1783, racial legislation against Romanies was repealed in the [[United Kingdom]], and a specific "Turnpike Act" was established in 1822 to prevent nomads from camping on the roadside, strengthened in the Highways Act of 1835.&lt;ref name = "kenrick"/&gt;

===Persecution===
{{Main|Antiziganism}}

In 1538, the first anti-ziganist (anti-Romani) legislation was issued in [[Moravia]] and [[Bohemia]], which were under [[Habsburg]] rule. Three years later, after a series of fires in [[Prague]] which were blamed on the Romani, [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] ordered them to be expelled. In 1545, the [[Diet of Augsburg]] declared that "whoever kills a Gypsy, will be guilty of no murder". The massive killing spree that resulted prompted the government to eventually step in and "forbid the drowning of Romani women and children".&lt;ref&gt;Crowe (2004) p.35&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1710, [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] ordered that "all adult males were to be hanged without trial, whereas women and young males were to be flogged and banished forever." In addition, they were to have their right ears cut off in the kingdom of Bohemia and their left ear in Moravia.&lt;ref name="romahistory.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romahistory.com/en/2-5-4.htm|title=The History of the Roma: 2.5.4: 1647 to 1714|publisher=Romahistory.com|first=Marko D.|last=Knudsen|accessdate=24 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017082735/http://www.romahistory.com/en/2-5-4.htm|archivedate=17 October 2013|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1530, England issued the [[Egyptians Act 1530|Egyptians Act]] which banned Romani from entering the country and required those living in the country to leave within 16 days. Failure to do so could result in confiscation of property, imprisonment and deportation. The act was amended with the Egyptians Act 1554, which ordered the Romani to leave the country within a month. Non-complying Romanies were executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mkheritage.co.uk/bfhng/docs/Sep10%20A%20Gypsy%20in%20the%20Family.htm |title=A Gypsy in the Family |author=Geof Lee |publisher=Mkheritage.co.uk |date=September 2010 |accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1660, Romanies were prohibited from residence in [[France]] by [[Louis XIV]].&lt;ref name="romahistory.com"/&gt;

In 1685, [[Portugal]] deported Romani to [[Brasil]].&lt;ref name="romahistory.com"/&gt;

===Pre-war organization===
In 1879, a national meeting of Romanies was held in the Hungarian town of [[Kisfalu]] (now [[Pordašinci]], [[Slovenia]]). Romanies in Bulgaria set up a conference in 1919 to protest for their right to vote, and a Romani journal, ''Istiqbal'' (Future) was founded in 1923.&lt;ref name="kenrick"/&gt;

In the [[Soviet Union]], the All-Russian Union of Gypsies was organized in 1925 with a journal, ''Romani Zorya'' (Romani Dawn) beginning two years later. The ''Romengiro Lav'' (Romani Word) writer's circle encouraged works by authors like [[Nikolay Aleksandrovich Pankov]] and [[Nina Dudarova]].&lt;ref name="kenrick"/&gt;

A General Association of the Gypsies of Romania was established in 1933 with a national conference, and two journals, ''Neamul Țiganesc'' (Gypsy Nation) and ''Timpul'' (Time). An "international" conference was organized in [[Bucharest]] the following year.&lt;ref name="kenrick"/&gt;

In Yugoslavia, Romani journal ''Romano Lil'' started publication in 1935.&lt;ref name="kenrick"/&gt;

===Porajmos===
{{main|Porajmos}}

During [[World War II]], the [[Nazism|Nazis]] murdered 220,000 to 500,000 Romanies in a [[genocide]] referred to as the ''[[Porajmos]]''. Like the [[Jew]]s, they were segregated into ghettoes before being sent to [[concentration camp]]s or [[extermination camp]]s. They were often killed on sight, especially by the [[Einsatzgruppen]] on the Eastern Front. 25% of European Roma perished in the genocide.

===Post-war history===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
In [[Communism|Communist]] central and eastern Europe, Romanies experienced assimilation schemes and restrictions of cultural freedom. The Romani language and Romani music were banned from public performance in [[Bulgaria]]. In Czechoslovakia, tens of thousands of Romanies from Slovakia, Hungary and Romania were re-settled in border areas of Czech lands and their nomadic lifestyle was forbidden. In Czechoslovakia, where they were labeled as a “socially degraded stratum,” Romani women were [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilized]] as part of a state policy to reduce their population. This policy was implemented with large financial incentives, threats of denying future social welfare payments, misinformation and [[Compulsory sterilization|involuntary sterilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Carol. "Persecution and Politicization: Roma (Gypsies) of Eastern Europe." Cultural Survival Quarterly, Summer 1995. Helsinki Watch. Struggling for Ethnic Identity: Czechoslovakia’s Endangered Gypsies. New York, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, Germany deported tens of thousands of migrants to central and eastern Europe. Sixty percent of some 100,000 Romanian nationals deported under a 1992 treaty were Romani.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times - [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/25/world/germany-and-romania-in-deportation-pact.htm Germany and Romania in Deportation Pact] dated 24 September 1992 Retrieved 19 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s and early 21st century many Romanies from central and eastern Europe attempted to migrate to western Europe or Canada. The majority of them were turned back. Several of these countries established strict [[visa (document)|visa]] requirements to prevent further migration.

In 2005, the [[Decade of Roma Inclusion]] was launched in nine [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Southeastern Europe]]an countries to improve the socio-economic status and social inclusion of the Romani minority across the region.

Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005 - 2015 has not been successful at all. The Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015 is coming to the end of its originally defined term. It initiated crucially important processes for Roma inclusion in Europe, and provided the impetus for an EU-led effort covering similar subject matter, the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 (EU Framework).&lt;ref&gt;European Commission - [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2011:0173:FIN:EN:PDF COM(2011)173].&lt;/ref&gt;

==America==
Romanies began immigrating to the [[United States]] in colonial times, with small groups in [[Virginia]] and [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]]. Larger-scale immigration began in the 1860s, with groups of [[Romnichal]] from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The largest number immigrated in the early 20th century, mainly from the [[Vlax]] group of [[Kalderash]]. Many Romanies also settled in other countries of the [[Americas]].

===Czech-Canadian Exodus===
In August 1997, [[Nova (Czech TV)|TV Nova]], a popular television station in the [[Czech Republic]], broadcast a documentary on the situation of Romanies who had emigrated to [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="exodus"&gt;[http://romove.radio.cz/en/clanek/18857 The Roma Exodus to Canada] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807014342/http://romove.radio.cz/en/clanek/18857 |date=7 August 2016}}, romove.radio.cz&lt;/ref&gt; The short report portrayed Romanies in Canada living comfortably with support from the state, and sheltered from racial discrimination and violence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091026165931/http://geocities.com/~patrin/canada.htm ERRC Statement Regarding Canada as Haven for Roma], Patrin Web Journal, 17 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, life was particularly difficult for many Romanies living in the Czech Republic. As a result of the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]], many Romanies were left without citizenship in either the Czech Republic or [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref name="promised"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cbc.ca/newsinreview/dec97/gypsies/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021003143753/http://cbc.ca/newsinreview/dec97/gypsies/index.html|archivedate=3 October 2002|title=Gypsies in Canada: The Promised Land?|work=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|date=December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the large flood in [[Moravia]] in July, many Romanies were left homeless yet unwelcome in other parts of the country.&lt;ref name="exodus"/&gt;

Almost overnight, there were reports of Romanies preparing to emigrate to Canada. According to one report, 5,000 Romani from the city of [[Ostrava]] intended to move. Mayors in some Czech towns encouraged the [[Emigration|exodus]], offering to help pay for flights so that Romanies could leave. The following week, the [[Canadian Embassy]] in Prague was receiving hundreds of calls a day from Romanies and flights between the Czech Republic and Canada were sold out until October.&lt;ref name="exodus"/&gt; In 1997, 1,285 people from the Czech Republic arrived in Canada and claimed [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|refugee status]], a rather significant jump from the 189 Czechs who did so the previous year.&lt;ref name="promised"/&gt;

Lucie Cermakova, a spokesperson at the Canadian Embassy in Prague, criticized the program, claiming it "presented only one side of the matter and picked out only nonsensical ideas." Marie Jurkovicova, a spokesperson for the Czech Embassy in Ottawa suggested that "the program was full of half-truths, which strongly distorted reality and practically invited the exodus of large groups of Czech Romanies. It concealed a number of facts."&lt;ref name="exodus"/&gt;

President [[Václav Havel]] and (after some hesitation) Prime Minister [[Václav Klaus]] attempted to convince the Romanies not to leave. With the help of Romani leaders like [[Emil Scuka]], Chairman of the [[Roma Civic Initiative]], they urged Romanies to remain in country and work to solve their problems with the larger Czech population.

The movement of Romanies to Canada had been fairly easy because [[Visa (document)|visa]] requirements for Czech citizens had been lifted by the [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada|Canadian government]] in April 1996. In response to the influx of Romanies, the Canadian government reinstated the visa requirements for all Czechs as of 8 October 1997.

==Romani nationalism==
[[File:Roma flag.svg|thumb|right|200px|[[Flag of the Romani people]]]]
A small Roma nationalist movement exists.

The first World Romani Congress was organized in 1971 near [[London]], funded in part by the [[World Council of Churches]] and the [[Government of India]]. It was attended by representatives from [[India]] and 20 other countries. At the congress, the green and blue flag from the 1933 conference, embellished with the red, sixteen-spoked [[chakra]], was reaffirmed as the national emblem of the Romani people, and the anthem, "''[[Gelem, Gelem]]''" was adopted.

The [[International Romani Union]] was officially established in 1977, and in 1990, the fourth World Congress declared April 8 to be [[International Day of the Roma]], a day to celebrate [[Romani society and culture|Romani culture]] and raise awareness of the issues facing the Romani community.

The 5th World Romany Congress in 2000 issued an official declaration of the Romany non-territorial nation.

The political philosopher [[Sheldon Wolin]] coined the term '''inverted totalitarianism'''  in 2003 to describe what he saw as the emerging form of [[government]] of the [[United States of America | United States]]. Wolin analysed the United States as increasingly turning into a [[managed democracy]] (similar to an [[illiberal democracy]]). He uses the term "inverted totalitarianism" to draw attention to the  [[totalitarianism |totalitarian]] aspects of the American political system while emphasizing its differences from proper [[totalitarianism]], such as [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] and [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] regimes.{{sfn | Wolin | 2008}}  

The book ''[[Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt]]'' (2012) by [[Chris Hedges]] and [[Joe Sacco]] portrays inverted totalitarianism as a system where [[corporation]]s have corrupted and subverted [[democracy]] and where economics trumps politics.&lt;ref name = Hedges-Liberal-Class&gt;{{cite book | first = Chris | last = Hedges | author-link = Chris Hedges | title = [[Death of the Liberal Class]] | pages = 14, 23–24, 25–26, 196, 200–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Hedges-As-It-Is&gt;{{Citation | first = Chris | last = Hedges | author-link = Chris Hedges | title = The World As It Is | ISBN = 978-1-56858-640-3 | publisher = [[Nation Books]] |date= April 2011 | pages = 3–7}}.

Every natural resource and living being is [[Commodification|commodified]] and exploited by large corporations to the point of collapse as excess [[consumerism]] and [[sensationalism]] lull and manipulate the [[citizenry]] into surrendering their liberties and their participation in government.&lt;ref name=CJ-TD/&gt;&lt;ref name=MargaretFlowers-2013-02/&gt;

== Inverted totalitarianism and managed democracy ==
Wolin argues that the United States is increasingly totalitarian as a result of repeated military mobilizations: to fight the [[Axis powers]] in the 1940s, to [[containment|contain]] the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]] and to fight the [[War on Terror]] after the [[September 11 attacks]].{{sfn |Wolin|2008| p=70}}&lt;ref name=Hedges-Liberal-Class/&gt;

Wolin describes this development toward inverted totalitarianism in terms of two conflicting political power centers, namely the constitutional imaginary and the power imaginary. Wolin speaks of imaginaries to include political tendencies as well as existing political conditions. He explains: {{quote|A political imaginary involves going beyond and challenging current capabilities, inhibitions, and constraints regarding power and its proper limits and improper uses. It envisions an organization of resources, ideal as well as material, in which a potential attributed to them becomes a challenge to realize it.{{sfn |Wolin|2008| p=18}}}}

Wolin explains that the constitutional imaginary "prescribes the means by which power is legitimated, accountable and constrained".{{sfn |Wolin|2008| p=19}} Referring to [[Thomas Hobbes]], Wolin understands the power imaginary as a quest for power that is rationalized by a fear of collective mortality. The power imaginary may "undermine or override the boundaries mandated in the constitutional imaginary"{{sfn |Wolin|2008| p=18}} through fears of a dangerous enemy: {{quote|A power imaginary is usually accompanied by a justifying mission ("to defeat communism" or "to hunt out terrorists wherever they may hide") that requires capabilities measured against an enemy whose powers are dynamic but whose exact location indeterminate.{{sfn |Wolin|2008| p=19}}}}

The power imaginary does not only reduce democracy within the United States, it also promotes the United States as "Superpower" that develops and expands its current position as the only global [[superpower]]: {{quote|While the versions of totalitarianism represented by Nazism and Fascism consolidated power by suppressing liberal political practices that had sunk only shallow cultural roots, Superpower represents a drive towards totality that draws from the setting where liberalism and democracy have been established for more than two centuries. It is Nazism turned upside-down, "inverted totalitarianism." While it is a system that aspires to totality, it is driven by an ideology of the [[cost-effective]] rather than of a "[[master race]]" (''Herrenvolk''), by the material rather than the "ideal."{{sfn | Wolin |2004| p=591}}}}

=== Comparison to the classical totalitarian regimes ===
Inverted totalitarianism shares similarities with the classical totalitarianism, like Nazi Germany. First of all, both regimes are totalitarian because they tend to dominate as much as possible. Both regimes use fear,{{sfn|Wolin|2008|p=56}} [[Preemptive war|preemptive wars]]{{sfn|Wolin|2008|p=48}} and elite domination,{{sfn|Wolin|2008|p=162}} but inverted and classical totalitarianism deviate in several important ways:
* Revolution – While the classical totalitarian regimes overthrew the established system, inverted totalitarianism instead exploits the legal and political constraints of the established democratic system and uses these constraints to defeat their original purpose.{{sfn|Wolin|2008|p=56}}
* Government – Whereas the classical totalitarian government was an ordered, idealized and coordinated whole,{{sfn|Wolin|2008|p=44}} inverted totalitarianism is a managed democracy which applies managerial skills to basic democratic political institutions.{{sfn|Wolin|2008|p=140}}
* Propaganda and dissent – Although propaganda plays an essential role in both the United States and Nazi Germany, the role it plays in the United States is inverted; that is, American propaganda "is only in part a state-centered phenomenon".{{sfn|Wolin|2008|p=xviii}} Whereas the production of propaganda was crudely centralized in Nazi Germany, in the United States it is left to highly [[Concentration of media ownership|concentrated media corporations]] and thus maintaining the illusion of a "[[Freedom of the press|free press]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Taking_the_risk_out_of_democracy.html?id=_UrtQ89Kp3YC|title=Taking the Risk Out of Democracy: Corporate Propaganda versus Freedom and Liberty}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this model, dissent is allowed, though the corporate media serve as a filter, allowing most people, with limited time available to keep themselves apprised of current events, to hear only points of view that the corporate media deem "serious".{{sfn|Wolin|2004|p=594}}&lt;ref name=Hedges-2010-01-24/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hedges-2012-10-03-TRNN&gt;{{Citation|url=http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=767&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=8887|title=US Elections: Pick Your Poison|type=interview|first=Chris|last=Hedges|author-link=Chris Hedges|publisher=[[The Real News Network]]|date=2012-10-03}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Democracy – Whereas the classical totalitarian regimes overthrew weak democracies/regimes, inverted totalitarianism has developed from a strong democracy. The United States even maintains its democracy is the model for the whole world.{{sfn|Wolin|2008|p=52}}
Wolin writes: {{quote|Inverted totalitarianism reverses things. It is all politics all of the time but a politics largely untempered by the political. Party squabbles are occasionally on public display, and there is a frantic and continuous politics among factions of the party, interest groups, competing corporate powers, and rival media concerns. And there is, of course, the culminating moment of national elections when the attention of the nation is required to make a choice of personalities rather than a choice between alternatives. What is absent is the political, the commitment to finding where the common good lies amidst the welter of well-financed, highly organized, single-minded interests rabidly seeking governmental favors and overwhelming the practices of representative government and public administration by a sea of cash.{{sfn|Wolin|2008|p=66}}}}
* Ideology – Inverted totalitarianism deviates from the Nazi regime as to ideology, i.e. cost-effectiveness versus master race. 
* Economy – In Nazi Germany, the state dominated the economic actors whereas in inverted totalitarianism corporations through [[lobbying]], political contributions and the [[Revolving door (politics)|revolving door]] dominate the United States, with the government acting as the servant of large corporations. This is considered "normal" rather than corrupt.{{sfn|Wolin|2008|pp=51,140}} 
* Nationalism – While Nazi Germany and [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]] were nationalistic, inverted totalitarianism is a global superpower based on global exchange of jobs, culture and commodities.{{sfn|Wolin|2008|p=50}}
* The people – While the classical totalitarian regimes aimed at the constant political mobilization of the populace, inverted totalitarianism aims for the mass of the populace to be in a persistent state of political apathy. The only type of political activity expected or desired from the citizenry is voting. Low electoral turnouts are favorably received as an indication that the bulk of the populace has given up hope that the government will ever significantly help them.{{sfn|Wolin|2008|p=64}}
* Punishment – While the classical totalitarian regimes punished harshly (imprisoning or killing political or ideological opponents and scapegoats), inverted totalitarianism in particular punishes by means of an economy of fear (minimizing social security, [[union busting| busting unions]], outdating skills, outsourcing jobs and so on).{{sfn|Wolin|2008|p=57-58,67}}
* Leader – While the classical totalitarian regimes had charismatic leaders that were the architects of the state, inverted totalitarianism does not depend on a certain leader, but produces its leaders who are akin to corporate leaders.{{sfn|Wolin|2008|p=44}}
* Social policy – While [[Nazism]] made life uncertain for the wealthy and privileged and had a [[social policy]] for the working class, inverted totalitarianism exploits the poor by reducing health and social programs and weakening working conditions.{{sfn|Wolin|2008|p=239}}

=== Managed democracy ===
The superpower claims both democracy and global [[hegemony]].{{sfn|Wolin|2008|p=97}} Democracy and hegemony is coupled by means of managed democracy, where the elections are free and fair but the people lack the actual ability to change the policies, motives and goals of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolin|first=Sheldon S.|authorlink=Sheldon Wolin|title=Democracy Incorporated: Managed Democracy and the Specter of Inverted Totalitarianism|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9175.html|isbn=0-691-13566-5}} p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; 

Managerial methods are applied to elections: {{quote|Managed democracy is the application of managerial skill to the basic democratic political institution of popular elections.{{sfn|Wolin|2008|p=140}}}}

By using managerial methods and developing management of elections, the democracy of the United States has become sanitized of political participation, therefore managed democracy is "a political form in which governments are legitimated by elections that they have learned to control".{{sfn|Wolin|2008|p=47}} Under managed democracy, the electorate is prevented from having a significant impact on policies adopted by the state because of the opinion construction and manipulation carried out by means of technology, social science, contracts and corporate subsidies.{{sfn|Wolin|2008|p=59-60}}

Managerial methods are also the means by which state and global corporations unite so that corporations increasingly assume governmental functions and services and corporations become still more dependent on the state. A main object of managed democracy is privatization and the expansion of the private, together with reduction of governmental responsibility for the welfare of the citizens.{{sfn|Wolin|2008|p=131,136}}

According to Wolin, the United States has two main totalizing dynamics:
* The first, directed outward, finds its expression in the global War on Terror and in the [[Bush Doctrine]] that the United States has the right to launch [[preemptive war]]s. This amounts to the United States seeing as illegitimate the attempt by any state to resist its domination.{{sfn|Wolin|2008|pp=82&amp;ndash;88}}&lt;ref name=Hedges-2010-01-24/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hedges-2012-10-03-TRNN/&gt;
* The second dynamic, directed inward, involves the subjection of the mass of the populace to economic "[[Rationalization (economics)|rationalization]]", with continual "[[Layoff|downsizing]]" and "[[outsourcing]]" of jobs abroad and dismantling of what remains of the [[welfare state]] created by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]]. [[Neoliberalism]] is an integral component of inverted totalitarianism. The state of insecurity in which this places the public serves the useful function of making people feel [[Learned helplessness|helpless]], therefore making it less likely they will become politically [[Activism|active]] and thus helping maintain the first dynamic.{{sfn|Wolin|2008|pp=27, 64&amp;ndash;65}}{{sfn|Wolin|2008|p=195}}&lt;ref name=Hedges-2010-01-24/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hedges-2012-10-03-TRNN/&gt;

== Reception ==
Sheldon Wolin's book ''Democracy Incorporated: Managed Democracy and the Specter of Inverted Totalitarianism'' received a [[Lannan Foundation#Lannan Literary Award for An Especially Notable Book|Lannan Literary Award for an Especially Notable Book]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lannan.org/literary/detail/sheldon-wolin-notable-book-award/notable-book-award/  Sheldon Wolin - 2008 Lannan Literary Award for An Especially Notable Book]. "This Lannan Notable Book Award recognizes Democracy Incorporated: Managed Democracy and the Specter of Inverted Totalitarianism by Sheldon Wolin." From the official website of the [[Lannan Foundation]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of Wolin's ''Democracy Incorporated'' in ''[[Truthdig]],'' political scientist and author [[Chalmers Johnson]] wrote that the book is a "devastating critique" of the contemporary government of the United States—including the way it has changed in recent years and the actions that "must" be undertaken "if it is not to disappear into history along with its classic totalitarian predecessors: Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany and Bolshevik Russia".&lt;ref name=CJ-TD/&gt; In Johnson's view, Wolin’s is one of the best analyses of why presidential elections are unlikely to be effective in mitigating the detrimental effects of inverted totalitarianism. Johnson writes that Wolin’s work is "fully accessible" and that understanding Wolin's argument "does not depend on possessing any specialized knowledge".&lt;ref name=CJ-TD/&gt; Johnson believes Wolin's analysis is more of an explanation of the problems of the United States than a description of how to solve these problems, "particularly since Wolin believes that the U.S. political system is corrupt"&lt;ref name=CJ-TD/&gt; and "heavily influenced by financial contributions primarily from wealthy and corporate donors, but that nonetheless Wolin’s analysis is still one of the best discourses on where the U.S. went wrong".&lt;ref name=CJ-TD&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.truthdig.com/arts_culture/item/20080515_chalmers_johnson_on_our_managed_democracy | title = Chalmers Johnson on Our ‘Managed Democracy’  | first = Chalmers | last = Johnson | author-link = Chalmers Johnson|newspaper=[[Truthdig]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kevin Zeese]] and Margaret Flowers expressed the following view:&lt;ref name=MargaretFlowers-2013-02/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;We are living in a time of Inverted Totalitarianism, in which the tools used to maintain the status quo are much more subtle and technologically advanced ... These include propaganda and major media outlets that hide the real news about conditions at home and our activities around the world behind distractions [...] Another tool is to create insecurity in the population so that people are unwilling to speak out and take risks for fear of losing their jobs [...] Changes in college education also silence dissent [...] Adjunct professors [...] are less willing to teach topics that are viewed as controversial. This, combined with massive student debt, are tools to silence the student population, once the center of transformative action.&lt;ref name=MargaretFlowers-2013-02&gt;{{Citation | url = http://truth-out.org/news/item/14489-lifting-the-veil-of-mirage-democracy-in-the-united-states | title = Lifting the Veil of Mirage Democracy in the United States|date= February 2013 | type = article | first = and [[Kevin Zeese]] | last = Margaret Flowers | newspaper = [[Truthout]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2971">'''John of Antioch''' was a 7th-century chronicler, who wrote in [[Greek language|Greek]]. He was a [[monk]], apparently contemporary with Emperor [[Heraclius]] (610&amp;ndash;41). Gelzer (''Sextus Julius Africanus'', 41) identifies the author with the [[Monophysite]] [[List of Syriac Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch|Syrian Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]] [[John of the Sedre]], who ruled from 630 to 648.

John of Antioch's chronicle, ''Historia chronike'', is a universal history stretching from [[Adam]] to the death of [[Phocas]]; it is one of the many adaptations and imitations of the better known chronicle of [[John Malalas]]. His sources include [[Sextus Julius Africanus]], [[Eusebius]], and [[Ammianus Marcellinus]]. Only fragments remain.

The fragments of the chronicle are contained in two collections, the Codex Parisinus 1763, which was published in an edition by [[Claudius Salmasius]], and the encyclopedia of history made by order of [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]] (912&amp;ndash;59), in fifty-three chapters. Of the Constantinian collection only parts remain (Krumbacher, ''Byzantinische Litteraturgebchichte'', 258&amp;ndash;60). Two titles: "Of Virtue and Vice" and "Of Conspiracies against Emperors" contain the literary remains of John of Antioch. A difficulty arises from the fact that a great part of the extracts (from the Roman Commonwealth of Justin I) differs considerably from the corresponding quotations in the Salmasian collection. The Constantinian passages are of the nature the old Hellenic writing of history, the Salmasian ones are rather [[Byzantine]] and [[Christian]]. The Salmasian compilation is older, and so appears to be the original text; the other is no doubt a re-arrangement made under the influence of the Hellenic Renaissance started by  patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]. But some authorities see in them two different originals and speak of a "Constantinian" and a "Salmasian" John of Antioch.

The Salmasian excerpts are edited by Cramer, ''Anecdota Graecae cod. mss. regiae Parisiensis'', II, Oxford 1839, 383&amp;ndash;401. Both series of fragments are in [[Karl Wilhelm Ludwig Müller|C. Muller]], "[https://archive.org/details/fragmentahistori04mueluoft Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum]", vol. IV, Paris, 1883, 535&amp;ndash;622; V, 27&amp;ndash;8.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3649">'''Julian Raymond Dennis Cobbing''' (born June 1944, [[London]]) is an [[England|English]] [[historian]], and [[professor]] of History at [[Rhodes University]] ([[Grahamstown]], [[South Africa]]), known best for his controversial and groundbreaking research into [[Zulu people|Zulu]] culture of the early 19th century.

Cobbing gained a BA from the [[University of London]] and a PhD from [[Lancaster University]]. He is regarded as the first historian to [[Historical revisionism|attempt to discredit conventional historical beliefs]] about the '[[Mfecane]]' - a period of wars during the 1820s and 1830s that resulted in the emergence of the [[Zulu Kingdom]]. In a paper published in the ''[[Journal of African History]]'' in 1988, Cobbing argued that the Mfecane had been the construct of [[Apartheid]] politicians and historians attempting to justify the longstanding oppression of [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|black South Africans]] by the [[Dominant minority|white minority]]. Instead of an internally induced process of black-on-black destruction, Cobbing argued that much of the violence had been brought about by European slave traders and settlers, who had contracted local tribal leaders to [[Slave trade|capture slaves for sale]] at [[Delagoa Bay]] (now [[Maputo]]). The rise of the Zulu state, under Cobbing's hypothesis, was thus more of a defensive reaction to the slave-trading activities of other tribes in the region, rather than a process of active internal aggression, as argued by some contemporary scholars.

Cobbing's hypothesis was highly controversial when first published. Several books and articles have been written focused on rebutting Cobbing's arguments – a prominent example being [[Roger B. Beck]]'s ''Slavery in South Africa: Captive Labor on the Dutch Frontier'', which featured a collection of articles challenging Cobbing's contentions. Often now referred to as the "Cobbing controversy", historians are still very much divided on the issue of the emergence of the Zulu nation and the accuracy of conventional accounts of the Mfecane. Most agree however that Cobbing's analysis offered several key breakthroughs, and offered a robust alternative to accounts of the Mfecane that had been taught in school history curricula during Apartheid.{{cn|date=September 2013}}

Cobbing spent two months as a visiting fellow at the [[University of Oxford]] in 2002. He currently lives in [[Grahamstown]], [[South Africa]], and recently retired from lecturing in history at [[Rhodes University]], where his course "The Origins of the Modern World Crisis" was very popular. Cobbing's current work focuses on a variety of subjects including the history of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' as a species and the modern world crisis.

'''Kafi Benz''' (born 1941) is an American author and artist who began participation in [[social entrepreneurship]] through [[environmental preservation]] and [[regional planning]] in 1959 as a member of the ''Jersey Jetport Site Association'', which opposed plans by the [[Port of New York Authority|New York Port Authority]] to found a new airport in the [[Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge#Wildlife Refuge Formation|Great Swamp]], the central feature of a massive 55 square mile [[Drainage basin|watershed]] in New Jersey bounded to the south and east by the [[Watchung Mountains]], 25 miles west of [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fws.gov/news/historic/1964/19640525b.pdf ''Great Swamp in New Jersey, Donated to Government as Wildlife Area, to be Dedicated''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907202759/http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/cuhis3057/textscans/MHDodge1932.htm |date=September 7, 2006 }}, United States Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, May 25, 1964, P.N.46917-64&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s she also became very active in [[historic preservation]], founding a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, [[Friends of Seagate Inc.]], for that purpose. The organization later was expanded to include concerns for additional areas in the arts and sciences. At the same time she founded the official web site of the sculptor [[Jim Gary]]. In 2001 it was moved to another web site she created that may feature other artists as well, ''Kafi Benz Productions''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kafi-benz.com Kafi Benz Productions] is a web site that in 2001 succeeded the ''Jim Gary Web Site by Kafi Benz''&lt;/ref&gt;

Born during 1941 in [[Chatham borough, New Jersey|Chatham]], New Jersey, her mother was a [[commercial artist]], [[graphic designer]], and illustrator and her father was a prominent physician and surgeon who was chief of staff at a hospital in [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]].

== Initial environmental conservation ==
The ''Jersey Jetport Site Association'' was a small, but effective conservation organization, circumventing the efforts of the [[Port of New York Authority|Port Authority]] to replace [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark Airport]] with a much larger complex farther to the west. After infiltrating meetings of the powerful authority headed by [[Austin J. Tobin]], that were held to marshal support among construction companies and unions, the members of the association distributed opposition literature and drew public attention to its efforts. Greater opposition arose among the residents of the massive area that would be affected once the issue was revealed by coverage of the expulsion of four of the ''JJSA'' members (Kafi Benz, Joan Kelly, Esty Weiss, and Betty White) from a meeting at a Newark hotel, the Essex House, in a local newspaper, the [[Newark Evening News]], on Thursday, December 3, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Leonard W., PhD, [http://www.tentowns.org/10t/suststew.htm ''Keynote Address to the Tenth Anniversary Celebration''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907202759/http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/cuhis3057/textscans/MHDodge1932.htm |date=September 7, 2006 }}, Ten Towns Committee (Great Swamp Watershed Management Committee), Sustainable Stewardship, June 24, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage quickly included publications such as the New York Times.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Clarence, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/1960/01/14/archives/plan-for-airport-argued-in-jersey-port-authority-expert-takes-stump.html Plan for Airport Argued in Jersey; Port Authority Expert Takes Stump in Madison but Audience Is Dubious]'', The New York Times, January 14, 1960, page 34, U.S. edition&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Great swamp map.png|thumb|200px|The Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge – 7,600 acres, almost {{convert|12|sqmi}}]] 
The ''JJSA'' was closely followed by a sister organization, a new sub-committee founded in Washington, D.C. within the ''North American Wildlife Foundation'', and these combined efforts led quickly to the establishment of the park that would become the ''[[Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge]]'' by an [[act of Congress]] on Thursday, November 3, 1960. Residents such as [[Geraldine R. Dodge]] and [[Marcellus Hartley Dodge, Sr.]] contributed the funds necessary to purchase the core of the swamp as the legal opposition progressed into a victory for the preservationists that led to the perpetual protection of the important [[natural habitat]]. Along with providing the funds to seek other donors, the influence of such prominent residents opened doors to legislators. Marcellus Dodge also was instrumental in establishing dialogue with established conservation groups.

The initial donation of land to the federal government as a park was {{convert|2600|acre|km2}}. The park now consists of {{convert|7600|acre|km2}} or almost 12&amp;nbsp;square miles of varied habitats. It was declared a [[National Natural Landmark]] in 1966 and given wilderness status in 1968.

During the final period of the founding of the park, Secretary of the Interior, [[Stewart Lee Udall]], headed the federal department which was in charge of parks. He supported the efforts of these [[conservation movement|conservationist]]s and commented that he believed they mounted the greatest effort ever made by residents in America to protect a natural habitat. Several national news magazines also noted the success the tiny organization achieved.

== Fine arts activities ==
In the late 1960s Benz became a director of the ''Somerset Art Association'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.somersetart.org/ The Center for Contemporary Art (formerly known as the Somerset Art Association)] is a regional art center with a comprehensive studio art school&lt;/ref&gt; then located in Bernardsville, New Jersey, exhibited fine art, and participated in the planning and administration of its annual competitive regional art show. The organization has been renamed as, ''The Center for Contemporary Art'' (CCA),[http://www.somersetart.org/] is located in [[Bedminster, New Jersey|Bedminster]], and is noted as a regional art center with a comprehensive studio art school, professional exhibition program, and a community outreach component. Her painting and sculpture works are held in private collections in several states. Occasionally sitting as a model for sculpture classes taught at the association by [[Berta Margoulies]] (a 1946 Guggenheim fellowship recipient),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,931023,00.html?promoid=googlep ''Art: Sculpture in Manhattan''], Time, Monday, April 25, 1938 – review of exhibition by a Manhattan [[Sculptors Guild]] organized by fifty-eight sculptors, "able and varied work was on hand [by sculptors] William Zorach, Warren Wheelock, Harold Cash, Herbert Ferber, José de Creeft, Chaim Gross, Maurice Glickman, Hy Freilicher, Berta Margoulies, Concetta Scaravaglione..." from magazine archives&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1996/03/22/MN40519.DTL Berta Margoulies O'Hare obituary], Friday, March 22, 1996, San Francisco Chronicle, page A.22&lt;/ref&gt; many sculptures of Benz have been exhibited by these students.

At that time a friendship with sculptor [[Jim Gary]] developed that would lead to her representing the sculptor at many times, eventually becoming his publicist, creating and maintaining the official web site for Gary and his work,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kafi-benz.com/display_0001_en.html ''Jim Gary's Twentieth Century Dinosaurs''], Kafi Benz Productions, September 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and becoming the director of his studio, ''Jim Gary's Twentieth Century Dinosaurs'', marketing and placing his works and exhibition.

When Gary died in January 2006, Benz established a memorial fund and led efforts to bring about the placement of sculptures from his traveling exhibition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belkcollege.uncc.edu/default.asp?id=66&amp;objId=7 retrieved January 2006 from web site of Belk College of Business] of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[Collection (museum)|single collection]] in a suitable museum or institution where the sculptures in the collection would remain open to the public. By 2009 negotiations with a site in [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]] seemed assured and much publicity ensued,&lt;ref&gt;''Cougars move over, dinosaurs on the way'', Longboat Key News, September 25, 2009, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; through 2010. That contract was not executed, however, and negotiations were redirected successfully to a museum in Tallahassee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kafi-benz.com/display.php?id=0004&amp;title=Tallahassee%20Museum%20will%20host%20Jim%20Gary%20sculpture%20exhibit&amp;newcnt=1 ''Tallahassee Museum will host Jim Gary sculpture exhibit''], Kafi Benz Productions, August 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011 twenty-one Gary sculptures were packed into vans and moved from Colts Neck, New Jersey for a ten-year display at the [[Tallahassee Museum]] in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Laura, [http://www.app.com/article/20110912/NJENT08/309120079/Jersey-s-loss-Florida-s-gain ''Jersey's Loss is Florida's Gain: Remembering an Arts Icon'', Jim Gary Sculptures Move to Tallahassee Museum], Asbury Park Press, 2011.09.12 Entertainment, the Arts, front page&lt;/ref&gt; When [[National Geographic Magazine]] was unable to meet the schedule, Benz invited three free-lance photographers to document the preparations and complex move with videos and still photographs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kafi-benz.com/display.php?id=0005&amp;title=zGalleries%20%97%20Moving%20Jim%20Gary%20works%20from%20Colts%20Neck&amp;newcnt=1 ''Moving Jim Gary works from Colts Neck''], Kafi Benz Productions, September 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

She represented painter Lee W. Hughes also, principally while he was a transparent [[watercolor]] artist,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernardsvillelibrary.org/Madelyn/Hughes.pdf ''Lee W. Hughes Legacy – Juried Art Show''], Bernardsville Public Library, Bernardsville, New Jersey, June 21 through July 30, 2007 honored the artist&lt;/ref&gt; with a studio and gallery in [[Mendham, New Jersey]]. She also represented his wife and her longtime friend, pencil [[art medium|medium]] artist Sue Hughes (née McQuillan), while she was working out of a studio in New Jersey and later, in California.

A search committee headed by Virginia Laudano,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ljworld.com/specials/terror_attack/slideshow12-1/pages/6.html ''Slide show of significant paintings prompted by the 9-11 terrorist attacks''], L J World, featured a painting by Virginia Laudano, accessed 2001&lt;/ref&gt; of the ''Art Club of Sun City Center'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artclubofscc.org/ ''Art Club in Sun City Center''], [[Sun City Center, Florida]], September 2011, newsletter includes a photograph of three instructors, including Virginia Laudano&lt;/ref&gt; invited Kafi Benz to judge its thirty-sixth annual art show held during February 2003&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/2003/02/07/Brandontimes/Sun_City_art_show_tod.shtml ''Sun City art show today''], St. Petersburg Times, Brandon Times on-line version, published February 7, 2003, 36th annual show held by SCC in February 2003&lt;/ref&gt; jointly with the prominent Tampa Bay area&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartsmap.com/detail.php?id=603 ''Gainor Roberts'' listing], ''[[The Arts Map]]'', Robin Colodzin and [[Jonathan Talbot]] [http://www.theartsmap.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gainor.biz/ Gainor Web Site]&lt;/ref&gt; multi-media artist, [[Gainor Roberts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fineartamerica.com/profiles/gainor-roberts.html?viewcomplete=true ''Gainor Roberts''] Fine Art America profile&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, Benz participated in a project with transparent watercolor artist, John Crawford, to publish his research of an early [[Renoir]] painting of Marie Le Coeur, that was among his art collection since its acquisition in Chicago during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Rachel, ''Local Man Discovers Masterpiece'', The Sun, a Media General Publication, August 8, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; He is the namesake of the ''John Crawford Art Education Studio'' that was created after his death at SouthShore Regional Library of Hillsborough County,&lt;ref&gt;[http://southshorefriends.com/ SouthShore Regional Library], [[Ruskin, Florida]]&lt;/ref&gt; which now features many of his own paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://southshorefriends.com/photos ''John Crawford Art Rooms''] shown on the lower right&lt;/ref&gt; The planned book was not published before his death.

Among several positions working with [[Denise Kowal]], the founder of the [[Sarasota Chalk Festival]], in 2012, Benz became the manager of its mural committee, ‘’Going Vertical’’, locating sites and co-ordinating the work of the international artists who performed their work as muralists on buildings in the region as part of the festival. During this time she developed a relationship with the French graffiti artist, [[MTO (muralist)|MTO]],&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.flickr.com/photos/mto-graff/ Street art and murals by MTO]'', Flicker, accessed 2012.10.12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://twistedsifter.com/2014/05/hyperrealistic-street-art-portraits-by-mto/ Hyper realistic street art portraits by MTO]''&lt;/ref&gt; that eventually, led to Benz being identified by him as the [[curator]] for several of the murals he later created independently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbanitewebzine.com/2013/11/29/mtos-road-trips-in-sarasota-and-miami-florida/ Road Trip mural on The Players theater in Sarasota]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://urbanitewebzine.com/2013/11/29/mtos-road-trips-in-sarasota-and-miami-florida/ MTO’s Road Trips In Sarasota and Miami, Florida]'', Urbanite, November 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.en.ozartsetc.com/2013/12/03/mto-road-trip-part-2-new-mural-florida-usa/ MTO – Road Trip Part 2 New Mural @ Florida, USA]'', Ozarts Etc, December 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; During the festival of 2012, he had become the subject of intense focus in the community because of curious interpretations of some of his murals that grew into a veritable polarized controversy, perpetuated by those projecting those unsupported interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jessi, [http://www.thisweekinsarasota.com/get-a-ringside-seat-mto-is-not-pulling-any-punches-in-his-latest-mural/ ''Get a ringside seat: MTO is not pulling any punches in his latest mural''], This Week in Sarasota, December 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy raged on for months and led to the destruction of the huge mural that provoked it. She also became the co-translator and narrator of a [[documentary film]] MTO created about his perspective of the saga and the murals he painted in response to various stages of it, as they unfolded. The film, ''FL: unpremeditated movie'',&lt;ref&gt;MTO, [http://vimeo.com/59805736 ''FL: unpremeditated movie''], 2013, Berlin, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; was released in March 2013.

== Return to preservation ==

During the 1980s Benz became active in environmental and historic preservation in [[Sarasota, Florida]]. She joined the ''Sarasota Alliance for Historic Preservation, Inc.'' shortly after Veronica Morgan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialweb.net/Events/87218.lasso ''Artist's Talk by Veronica Morgan''], Social Web, January 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; founded the organization in 1984, and has served in several positions among its officers as well as being a director of the organization over the years.

Jerris Foote participated in both projects.

Toward the end of the decade, Benz participated in documentation of other archaeological and historical sites. She was cited as a special contributor to the survey of archaeological, historical, cultural, and natural resources in the coastal areas of Sarasota County that was conducted by the Florida department of environmental regulation as well as for recommending sites deserving further research.&lt;ref&gt;''An Historic Resources Survey of the Coastal Zone of Sarasota County, Florida'', prepared for the Sarasota County Board of County Commissioners, Sarasota County Department of Natural Resources, and the Sarasota County Department of Historical Resources by the [[University of South Florida]] Department of Anthropology, Tampa, Florida for the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation per CM.235 Agreement for Cultural Resources Management; March 1990, pp. 5, 213 "...A great deal of information was generously shared by colleagues and concerned Sarasota County residents. We wish to acknowledge the special contributions of the following: ...Kafi Benz, Dudley deGroot..."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:1940s advertisement 83d40m w Crosley image .png|thumb|100px|Powel Crosley, Jr. circa 1949 - ''Sarasota County History Center'']]
In the late 1980s Benz founded [[Friends of Seagate Inc.]], which championed the preservation of the remaining portions of [[Seagate (Manatee County, Florida)|Seagate]], a subdivision platted in 1925 that became the Crosleys' estate in 1929. The property was sold to the Horton family in 1948, and was purchased in the late 1970s for development into a club-based condominium project by the [[Robert Campeau|Campeau Corporation]]. Although the property had been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1982,&lt;ref name=NRPH-Seagate&gt;{{Cite web |author=Michael Zimny and Sarah Kearns |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory ––Nomination Form: Seagate | work = |publisher=National Park Service |date=January 21, 1983 |url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail?assetID=cbfaf743-13ef-4a25-a395-3958ffc8c96b|format=pdf | accessdate =May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Kenwyn Caranna and Carlos Galarza| title =Historic But Dilapidated Estate Wins Reprive | journal =Bradenton Herald | volume = | issue = | pages =A1 | publisher = | location = Bradenton, Florida | date = August 15, 1990| url =| accessdate =}} See also:{{cite journal| author=Carlos Galarza| title =Campeau's Bay Front Land Remains in Real Estate Limbo | journal = Bradenton Herald | volume = | issue =|page=B1 | publisher = | location =Bradenton, Florida | date =September 20, 1990| url =| accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; little protection is afforded through listing and Benz's concerns were for both historic preservation and environmental conservation. Unfortunately, the condominium market in Florida had collapsed shortly after Campeau acquired the property and the ambitious plans to use the 1929 home and auxiliary buildings as the clubhouse and headquarters of the development were never realized. Work permits were kept alive by intermittent, but unrelated and minimal construction until the corporation began to collapse. That collapse led to the demise of many of the most [[Allied Stores|prestigious department stores]] in America—such as [[Bonwit Teller]]—having been acquired by the failing [[Federated Department Stores]] division that had become part of Campeau.

The Seagate property changed hands several times with several inglorious plans submitted for redevelopment that met with opposition until Friends of Seagate was founded and Benz's campaign for acquisition was begun, that resulted finally, in public acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;LaHurd, Jeff, [http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20151115/article/151119774?p=1&amp;tc=pg&amp;tc=ar ''Powel Crosley, Jr. remembered as a visionary''], Sarasota Herald Tribune, Sunday, November 15, 2015, page B-1&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 the property was acquired by the state of Florida with a division into two portions, the bay front residence and {{convert|16|acre|ha}} being overseen by Manatee County and the much larger, eastern portion of the property along [[Tamiami Trail]] being overseen by [[New College of Florida|New College]] and [[University of South Florida]] until their separation and the resulting development of this portion into a new campus only for the satellite, commuter campus of the university. Following the public acquisition of the property the objectives of Benz's organization were expanded to broader preservation issues involving archaeological, artistic, cultural, environmental, and historical aspects of the region. [[Lake Underwood]], a patron to Friends of Seagate, provided much of the funding and equipment for the expansion of the organization.

In 2002, Benz also led Friends of Seagate Inc. in its commitment as the nonprofit environmental entity to hold land in a partnership with the [[Sarasota]] municipal government as the eligible local governmental entity, applying for a state grant for funding through the ''[[Florida Forever|Florida Forever Program]]'', (Florida's premier conservation and recreation lands acquisition program) amounting to $1,505,625 for acquisition of ''Rus in Ur'be'', a large land parcel in the center of the Indian Beach Sapphire Shores neighborhood, as a neighborhood park. The parcel includes more than {{convert|11|acre|ha}} and contained a great deal of wooded and undeveloped land, [[wetlands]], a tennis court, and a [[Sarasota School of Architecture]] structure that served as a private clubhouse or recreational lounge for a bay front home opposite it on Bay Shore Road that had been sold separately from the house and held for a long time by a developer. The clubhouse was roofed with glazed blue Japanese [[ceramic]] tiles, used [[cypress|pecky cypress]] timbers for [[Framing (construction)|framing]], and had expansive glass partitions along the western [[Elevation (view)#Elevation|elevation]], facing the tennis courts.&lt;ref&gt;Funding Status Report, State of Florida, Florida Forever Cycle FF2, Florida Communities Trust – Department of Community Affairs, 2002, www.dca.state.fl.us/fct/ParksandOpenSpace/.../2002FundingStatusReport.xls 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The project retained its status among those not able to be included for state funding in that cycle, but was sold for private development before the next cycle began. The structure was demolished and the tennis courts destroyed, [[plat]]s for development with single family homes were surveyed, and a private road paved through the parcel, but no structures were built prior to the downturn of the real estate market as the speculation boom of the 1990s and 2000s collapsed. Several development projects have been proposed for the parcel. The property remained undeveloped through the next decade and often was identified as a likely location for a neighborhood park as other efforts continued. In 2014 the property was acquired out of foreclosure and may be destined for residential development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20140714/ARTICLE/140719843/0/ Indian Beach development to resume, 2014.07.14]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planning ==

Interest in regional and local [[urban planning|planning]] led Benz to participate in community planning projects,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sarasotaclerk.com/FileLib/20080324.pdf Sarasota Planning Board], March 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McQuaid, Kevin, [http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20020804/NEWS/208040578 ''Sarasota tweaks its plan''], [[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]], Sunday, August 4, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McQuaid, Kevin, [http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20020815/NEWS/208150419 ''Board hearing will focus on master plan''], [[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]], Thursday, August 15, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drouin, Roger, [http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20080904/ARTICLE/809040431 ''Sarasota officials delay marina vote''], [[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]], Thursday, September 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benz, Kafi, [http://www.srqmagazine.com/JMailer/SRQDailyV2LeftContent.cfm?conID=7054&amp;masID=3346 ''Fast-Track Cautions Misconstrued''], Op-Ed, SRQ Daily, Saturday, July 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the designs for the campuses of both [[New College of Florida|New College]] and the [[University of South Florida Sarasota – Manatee#History|University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee]].

The establishment of MPOs throughout the nation as an aspect of local government in the United States was mandated by congressional legislation. Depending upon the area, the governance of an MPO may be planning for a single community, county-wide, multiple or bi-county-wide, or regional. The area of an MPO may cross other established jurisdictional lines of government. By federal law, any urbanized area with a population exceeding 50,000 is required to form an MPO to guide transportation planning in the metropolitan area. MPOs are funded by the federal government in conjunction with additional funds contributed by the state and local governments of the regions in which they are formed. The need for larger regional transportation planning co-operation has driven the establishment of additional agencies within the MPO structure, such as the Chairs Coordinating Committee, with much larger focus to draw the officials from the MPO organizations in many regions into the national effort to integrate transportation planning more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Valerie, [http://www.allbusiness.com/management/change-management/1122542-1.html/ Institute of Transportation Engineers, ITE Journal], January 1, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Decades later, the federal highway standards now support the use of true modern roundabouts and some states have begun requiring road planners to defend any proposal lacking this innovative intersection design. Insurance companies now advocate it as well, to reduce fatalities and injuries, and to prevent extensive damage to automobiles at intersection crashes.

'''Sir Keith Sinclair''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (5 December 1922 &amp;ndash; 20 June 1993) was a [[poet]] and noted [[History|historian]] of New Zealand.

==Academic career==
Born and raised in [[Auckland]], Sinclair was a student at [[University of Auckland|Auckland University College]], which was then part of the [[University of New Zealand]].  He was awarded a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at the College and was made a [[professor]] of history at the [[University of Auckland]] in 1963.&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sir-keith-sinclair-1459112.html |title=Obituary: Sir Keith Sinclair |last1=Chan |first1=Stephen |date=4 August 1993 |website=Independent |publisher= |access-date=22 February 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Sinclair and fellow lecturer [[Robert Chapman (academic)|Bob Chapman]] established [[The University of Auckland]] Art Collection, beginning with the purchase of several paintings and drawings by [[Colin McCahon]]. The Collection is now managed by the Centre for Art Research, based at the [[Gus Fisher Gallery]].

Sinclair won widespread acclaim for his first book of history, ''The Origins of the [[New Zealand land wars|Maori Wars]]'' (1957). His next book, ''A History of New Zealand'' (1959), is often regarded as a classic in [[History of New Zealand|New Zealand history]]. The book remains in print, being revised several times, the last, with additions by fellow academic [[Raewyn Dalziel]], in 2000.  In 1967 he founded the ''New Zealand Journal of History''.

In both his poetry and his work as a historian, Sinclair was a [[nationalist]], in the sense that he was concerned with forging a [[nation|national identity]] for New Zealand that was independent of its [[British Empire|colonial]] origins.&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt;

==Political life==
In the [[New Zealand general election, 1969|1969 general election]] he was the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] candidate for [[Eden (New Zealand electorate)|Eden]]. He won the electorate on the night, but was defeated 3 weeks later on the final count (including special votes) by only 67 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Norton |first= Clifford |title= New Zealand Parliamentary Election Results 1946-1987: Occasional Publications No 1, Department of Political Science |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear=  |year= 1988 |publisher=  Victoria University of Wellington |location=  Wellington |isbn= 0-475-11200-8 |oclc= |page=220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he wrote an acclaimed biography of Labour Prime Minister [[Walter Nash]] who had left his vast personal archives at Sinclair's disposal. The book won the 1977 National Book Award.&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt;

==Later life==
Sinclair was awarded a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1983 and knighted for services to history in 1985.&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt; He then taught history at the University of Auckland until his retirement in 1987. ''Halfway Round the Harbour'', an [[autobiography]], was published [[posthumous work|posthumously]] in 1993.

In 2003, the University of Auckland established the Keith Sinclair Chair in History in his honour. In 2005, he was named one of [[New Zealand's Top 100 History Makers]].

One of his sons is the actor [[Harry Sinclair]]; another, [[Stephen Sinclair|Stephen]], is a New Zealand playwright and poet.

'''Koryun''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: {{lang|hy|[[wikt:Կորյուն|Կորյուն]]}} or {{lang|hy|[[wikt:Կորիւն|Կորիւն]]}}, also transliterated as ''Koriwn'', ''Koriun'', ''Goriun'' or ''Gorune'') was the earliest [[Armenian language|Armenian-language historian]]. Writing in the fifth century, his "Life of Mashtots" contains many details about the [[evangelism|evangelization]] of [[Armenia]] and the invention of the [[Armenian alphabet]]. 
Some Armenian and European scholars, such as G. Alishan, O. Torosyan, G. Fintigliyan, A. Sarukhan, G. Ter-Mkrtchyan (Miaban), S. Weber and others, have speculated that Koryun could have been an ethnic Georgian (Iberian) or Georgian-Armenian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vehi.net/istoriya/armenia/korun/intro.html Koryun, "Life of Mashtots", translation into Russian and intro by Sh.

Melik-Oghajanyan, Moscow, 1962, footnotes 15-21]&lt;/ref&gt; Having received his early education under [[Mesrob Mashtots]], Koryun went to [[Byzantium]] for higher studies, returning to Armenia with other students in 432. He was a close friend of [[Eznik Koghbatsi]] and [[Ghevond]]. Later, he was appointed [[Bishop]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. He has been listed among the junior translators. His style is original, but somewhat obscure due to grammatical irregularities. To him have been attributed the translations of the three apocryphal books of the [[Maccabees]]. Koryun was the origin of the claim that the [[Georgian alphabet]] was created by Mesrob Mashtots [http://www.matiane.com/koryun.htm].

After the death of Mashtots, Koryun was tasked by Hovsep Hoghotsmetsi, one of the spiritual leaders at that time, to start writing Mesrop's biography. Now his work is known as "Varq Mashtotsi" (Life of Mashtots). He finished his work before the Avarayr battle in 451 and new political developments in the region. In the modern period it was translated into Russian, English, French and German.

{{Other uses|Superposition (disambiguation)}}
{{no footnotes|date=March 2015}}

[[Image:IsfjordenSuperposition.jpg|thumb|250px|Layer upon layer of rocks on north shore of [[Isfjord (Svalbard)|Isfjord]], [[Svalbard]], [[Norway]]. Since there is no overturning, the rock at the bottom is older than the rock on the top by the Law of Superposition.]]

The '''law of superposition''' is an axiom that forms one of the bases of the sciences of [[geology]], [[archaeology]], and other fields dealing with geological [[stratigraphy]]. It is a form of [[relative dating]]. In its plainest form, it states that in undeformed stratigraphic sequences, the oldest [[stratum|strata]] will be at the bottom of the sequence. This is important to [[relative dating|stratigraphic dating]], which assumes that the law of superposition holds true and that an object cannot be older than the materials of which it is composed.

==History==
The law of superposition was first proposed in the late 17th century by the Danish scientist [[Nicolas Steno]].{{cite needed|date=September 2018}}  In the English-language literature, the law was popularized by [[William 'Strata' Smith|William "Strata" Smith]], who used it to produce the first geologic map of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Wyse Jackson, ''The Chronologers' Quest: The Search for the Age of the Earth'', Cambridge University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|1139457578}}, pp.127-8.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the first of [[Smith's laws]].

==Archaeological considerations==
Superposition in archaeology and especially in [[Stratification (archaeology)|stratification]] use during [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] is slightly different as the processes involved in laying down archaeological strata are somewhat different from geological processes. Man-made intrusions and activity in the [[archaeological record]] need not form chronologically from top to bottom or be deformed from the horizontal as natural strata are by equivalent processes. Some archaeological strata (often termed as [[Archaeological context|contexts]] or layers) are created by undercutting previous strata. An example would be that the silt back-fill of an underground drain would form some time after the ground immediately above it. Other examples of non vertical superposition would be modifications to standing structures such as the creation of new doors and windows in a wall. Superposition in [[archaeology]] requires a degree of interpretation to correctly identify chronological [[Sequence (archaeological)|sequences]] and in this sense superposition in archaeology is more dynamic and multi-dimensional.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2271">In [[historical linguistics]], a '''macrofamily''', also called a '''superfamily''' or '''phylum''', is a proposed genetic relationship grouping together language families (also isolates) in a larger scale classification.&lt;ref name="Campbell 2007"&gt;[[Lyle Campbell|Campbell, Lyle]] and [[Mauricio Mixco|Mixco, Mauricio J.]] (2007), ''A Glossary of Historical Linguistics'', University of Utah Press/Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[P. H. Matthews|Matthews, P.H.]] (2007), ''Oxford Concise Dictionary of Linguistics'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Lyle Campbell|Campbell]]&lt;ref name="Campbell 2004"&gt;[[Lyle Campbell|Campbell, Lyle]] (2004), ''Historical Linguistics: An Introduction'', Edinburgh University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; regards this term as superfluous, preferring "[[language family]]" for those classifications for which there is consensus and "'''distant genetic relationship'''" for those for which there is no, or not yet, consensus, whether due to lack of documentation or scholarship of the constituent languages, or to an estimated time depth thought by many linguists to be too great for reconstruction.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

More rarely, the term has also been applied to an exceptionally large [[language family]], such as [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Igor Diakonoff|Diakonoff, Igor M.]] (1996), "Some reflections on the Afrasian linguistic macrofamily."

==Life==

Daoud was the author of the twelve volume ''Tarikh Titwan'' ([[History of Tétouan|History of Tetouan]]) and publisher of the magazine ''Es-Salam''.

He tutored both the caliph, [[Muley Hassan ben el Mehdi]] and [[Ahmed Belbachir Haskouri]] in Tetouan's palace where they both grew up.&lt;ref&gt;Raissouni, Mohammed Muntasir(1995).

'''Musa Haji Ismail Galal''' ({{lang-so|Muuse Xaaji Ismaaciil Galaal}}, {{lang-ar|موسى الحاج اسماعيل جلال}}) (1917&amp;ndash;1980) was a [[Somali people|Somali]] writer, scholar, linguist, historian and [[polymath]].

==Biography==
Galal was born in 1917 in [[Burao]]. He hails from the [[Habar Jeclo]] clan of the [[Isaaq]]. He is noted for having contributed to the development of [[Wadaad's writing]]. In the 1950s, Galal introduced a more radical alteration of the [[Arabic script]] to represent the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] [[Somali language]]. He came up with an entirely new set of symbols for the [[Somali grammar|Somali vowels]]. I.M. Lewis (1958) considers this to be the most accurate Arabic script to have been devised for the Somali language. &lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Lewis, p.139-140&lt;/ref&gt; 
A prolific writer, Galal was also among the foremost authorities on the Somali [[Astrology|astrological]], [[Meteorology|meteorological]] and [[Calendar|calendrical]] systems. He devoted two major works to traditional Somali science, both of which are regarded as classics in [[Somali Studies]].

After a long scholarly career, Galal died in 1980.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;

In his honour, the Somali Studies Association periodically presents the ''Musa Galaal Award'' to Somalists whose work on Somali history and culture has earned distinction.

The '''National Museum of History and Art''' ({{lang-lb|Nationalmusée fir Geschicht a Konscht}}, {{lang-fr|Musée national d'histoire et d'art}}, {{lang-de|Nationalmuseum für Geschichte und Kunst}}), abbreviated to '''MNHA''', is a [[museum]] located in [[Luxembourg City]], in southern [[Luxembourg]].  It is dedicated to displaying [[Work of art|artwork]]s and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefact]]s from all epochs of [[History of Luxembourg|Luxembourg history]].  The museum is situated in [[Fishmarket]], the historic heart of the city, in the [[Ville Haute]] [[Quarters of Luxembourg City|quarter]].

==History==
[[File:Luxembourg MNHA 261 Epona Dalheim.jpg|thumb|150px|A Roman carving from Dalheim in the museum]]
[[File:Lang Barrage 1913.jpg|thumb|''[[The Dam]]'', 1913, by [[Dominique Lang]], is held in the museums collection]] 
The first proposal for such a museum was made during the [[French First Republic|French]] occupation of the [[French Revolutionary Wars|Revolutionary Wars]], when Luxembourg was annexed into the [[Départements of France|département]] of [[Forêts]].  However, the museum was never opened, despite the expropriation of a number of artefacts from the church.&lt;ref name="Historique"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnha.public.lu/musee/historique/index.html |title=Historique |accessdate=2007-01-02 |work= |publisher=Musée national d'histoire et d'art |language=fr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219102800/http://www.mnha.public.lu/musee/historique/index.html |archivedate=2007-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the affirmation of Luxembourg's independence under the [[Treaty of London, 1839|1839 Treaty of London]] came a greater interest by native Luxembourgers in promoting the history of their country.  In 1845, historians and archaeologists formed the 'Society for the Study and Preservation of Historic Monuments in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg' ({{lang-fr|Société pour la recherche et la conservation des monuments historiques dans le Grand-Duché de Luxembourg}}), regularly known as the 'Archaeological Society' ({{lang-fr|Société archéologique}}).&lt;ref name="Historique" /&gt;  The society took over the responsibility of maintaining a collection of historic antiquities from Luxembourg City's [[wikt:athenaeum|Athenaeum]].

In 1868, the Society received a boost from the establishment of the [[Royal-Grand Ducal Institute]] ({{lang-fr|Institut royal grand-ducal}}),&lt;ref&gt;To become just the 'Grand Ducal Institute' ({{lang-fr|Institut Grand-Ducal}}) in 1890, when the [[personal union]] of Luxembourg and the [[Netherlands]] ended.&lt;/ref&gt; amongst the responsibilities of which was the conservation of archaeological collections.&lt;ref name="Historique" /&gt;

The museum has been expanded with a new building designed by Christian Bauer et Associés, opened in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnha.public.lu/musee/restructuration/index.html National Museum of History and Art: Restructuration], retrieved 25 March 2010 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Mozambican War of Independence}}

'''Operation Abanadela''' was a military operation launched by the Portuguese Armed Forces in Mozambique during the [[Mozambican War of Independence]] against [[FRELIMO]] guerrillas in July 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.ci.uc.pt/cd25a/wikka.php?wakka=combates|title=Centro de Documentação 25 de Abril - Universidade de Coimbra|website=www1.ci.uc.pt|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; designates a set of patrols carried out along the [[Zambezi River]] in Mozambique between the 20th and the 30th July 1970 in order to protect the construction of the [[Cahora Bassa]] dam from possible attacks the guerrillas of FRELIMO and the passage of these to the south towards [[Tete]]. The Portuguese patrols were carried out by small groups of soldiers from the [[Portuguese Marine Corps]].

==Background==
===Cahora Bassa Dam===
When, in 1969, the Minister of Economy, Dias Rosas, argued against the system of financing organized to build the Cahora Bassa dam, which made the Portuguese State the guarantor of the work and left out South Africa's financial risks, which would be the main client, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Franco Nogueira, remarked that the dam was not business, but symbol of the will of the Portuguese to remain in Africa. The Minister of Economy, one of the government's technocrats, eventually resigned, after which the last illusions of rational investment were left with such arguments. The Cahora Bassa Dam is a classic example of the divorce between politics and strategy.

All the surrounding factors represented obvious and enormous risk: its deployment in war territory, a short distance of two hundred kilometres from the perilous border with Zambia, the six hundred kilometres separating it from the port of landing of the materials, Beira, and the eight hundred kilometres of the energy transport line in Mozambican territory, with 6,000 support posts. In addition, the energy produced by the dam could not be spent in Mozambique due to lack of installed industrial capacity and was not indispensable to its main destination, South Africa, since it had alternative sources. In short, Cahora Bassa was unnecessary as an energy producer, it was doubtful viability as an economic enterprise, and its construction and exploitation were at high risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guerracolonial.org/index.php?content=181|title=Guerra Colonial :: 1961-1974|website=www.guerracolonial.org|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two sides of the conflict understood the construction of the dam as a challenge that would decide the fate of the war, since for the Portuguese regime it represented the affirmation of its vitality and, more than that, the transmission abroad of the certainty of being able to win that war. Politically, it would give the image of Portugal strong, capable of motivating international support and attract economic investments, which would translate into political commitments. For Frelimo, the construction of the dam and its normal exploitation would imply the image of weakness and inability to control the land and the populations. Worse than that, its success could be accompanied by the installation of about one million white settlers in the Zambezi valley, which would decisively alter the human environment of the zone where the movement acted.

Significantly, in the first interview he gave as Frelimo's president, Samora Machel, still in 1970, and before Kaulza de Arriaga launched Operation Gordian Node, he said that preventing the construction of the dam continued to be Frelimo's main objective. Cahora Bassa was thus transformed into the decisive goal that materialised the victory of the attacker or the defender. But before progressing to the construction of the dam, it was indispensable for the Government to obtain the guarantee, on the part of the military, of the security of the enterprise and the respective line of transport of energy.

The analysis of the situation, which led Defence Minister Sá Viana Rebelo in 1968 to respond positively to this question. As for the enemy, on a reasonable assessment of Frelimo's military potential, its objectives and areas of action, it seemed unlikely that in three years the guerrillas would have been able to travel eight hundred kilometres from their base in Tanzania to settle and to spread through the Tete area on the two banks of the Zambezi so as to oblige, in 1971, to affect almost half of the Portuguese troops in Mozambique to the safety of the dam.

It was admitted in the initial study that between the Zambezi River and the Zambian border some small guerrilla groups would be set up, which would make the area operationally identical to that of Niassa. The Portuguese staff was certain that on the southern bank of the river, whose frontier was controlled by Rhodesia, it would be impossible to develop significant actions on the part of Frelimo. In order to guarantee this scenario, it was enough to strengthen the area north of the Zambezi, which was done by placing battalions at Furancungo and Bene, whose mission was to prevent infiltrations from Zambia through the Capoche river valley. With regard to the safety of the eight hundred kilometres of power transmission line, they were running along the border with Rhodesia and South Africa, so there would be no serious problems in this field either.

The Portuguese optimism of 1968 was reinforced by the conviction that local populations are not very permeable to Frelimo propaganda, and still less available to organise and fight because they are peasants with little political awareness, they are dispersed and have some tradition of emigration to South Africa. This scenario changed radically in three years. In 1971, it was necessary for the Portuguese forces to install COFI, first in Chicoa and then in Estima, at the base of the mountains of Cahora Bassa, command of large operations.

The reason for changing the assumptions on which the previous analysis was based was, first and foremost, the acute awareness of the importance of the construction of the dam by Frelimo. The nationalist leaders quickly became aware of the danger it posed and began immediately to prepare the response. Their efforts at political penetration have been directed to this area, in a process in which they tried not to overlook them, but which provoked some confrontations with the traditional authorities, developed a network of contacts that assured them transit and installation facilities in Zambia, repositioned weapons and equipment and recognised objectives and berth of refuge. That is, they sought to provide a solid foundation for a response that they knew was not easy. Frelimo's preparatory actions in Tete underwent a significant evolution in 1970.

The arrival of General Kaulza de Arriaga and the major operations he set in the north forced the movement to withdraw from the Planalto dos Macondes some of its staff, which were available for use in other areas . Tete has become your destination. On the other hand, the large concentration of Portuguese forces in the North further alleviated the military pressure in that zone, which was used by Frelimo to pass as many personnel and equipment to the south of the Zambezi as possible. At the beginning of 1971, three hundred guerrillas entered Mozambique to reach Zumbo near the border with Rhodesia and then progressed towards Zobué, on the border with Malawi, and engulfed Angonia from the south. The conditions were thus met for Frelimo to start actions in the Tete area as soon as Operation Gordian Node ended, which forced the transfer of Portuguese forces in the North. In fact, the great operations of Kaúlza de Arriaga in the Planalto dos Macondes will accelerate the decision of Frelimo to increase the fight in Tete.

By early 1971, the data had already been released. The main board playing the war in Mozambique was Tete and Cahora Bassa, with their umbilical cord, the Beira corridor, at a time when Portuguese troops were still deeply involved in Operation Frontier with Rovuma. As of 1971, the Cahora Bassa dam now requires the mobilisation of an increasing volume of means to defend it. The military device mounted aims to achieve three objectives: - Defend Cahora Bassa through the Cahora Bassa Defence Operational Command (CODCB); - Guarantee the transportation of materials through the Command of Critical Loads; - Prevent the spread of Frelimo south of the Zambezi River, and protect the future energy transport line through COFI and an ever-tightening mesh grid. The facility was continuously strengthened with regular, interventional units, GE and GEP, and the area underwent successive refurbishments, culminating in the creation of the Tete Operational Zone (ZOT) in May 1971.

In 1973, an advanced command of the Territorial Command of the Center, in Vila Gouveia, with the explicit mission of trying to stop the progression of Frelimo further south, a threat that was already being drawn.

Until 1974, the situation in Tete would not be aggravated by the progress of Frelimo's activities in areas nearer to Beira, but the awareness of the Portuguese military was so strong that its decisive objective was to secure the conclusion of the with which they had committed themselves, who had always understood that they were complying with it by avoiding significant disturbances in their work, despite the fact that their enemy had already forced them to concentrate around them more than 50 per cent of the total workforce in Mozambique, to have them involved in a war of attrition in which, with increasing frequency, they were confronted with delicate situations against black populations, religious authorities and in which they were discredited before the white settlers. Frelimo, with an economic war on casualties, was expanding its activities around Cahora Bassa and threatened to control the Isthmus of Beira, which would separate northern South Mozambique, by taking action in Vila Pery, Vila Gouveia and Inhaminga. Cahora Bassa, who had been presented as a symbol of victory, was finally bringing the war to the heart of Mozambique and accelerating its outcome.

Most sources use Dupuy's commando brigade designations: 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, and 134. But Dani Asher clearly defines six commando groups (group = brigade size). Each group contained 3 to 5 commando battalions totalling 24 battalions. He doesn't identify the groups, but from Arab sources, the following designations are available: 39, 127, 129, 136, 139, and 145.&lt;ref name=TOB2&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.testofbattle.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=38999|title=Command Decision - Test of Battle -- View topic - Chinese Farm OB|website=www.testofbattle.com|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6905">'''Paul Misraki''' (28 January 1908 – 29 October 1998) was a French composer of popular music and [[film music|film scores]]. Over the course of over 60 years, Misraki wrote the music to 130 films,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006201/ Paul Misraki]&lt;/ref&gt; scoring works by directors like [[Jean Renoir]], [[Claude Chabrol]], [[Jacques Becker]], [[Jean-Pierre Melville]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]], [[Orson Welles]], [[Luis Buñuel]] and [[Roger Vadim]].

[[File:Paul Misraki.jpg|thumb|Paul Misraki, Composer]]

For his work, he was made a [[Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur]].

==Biography and film career==
Born '''Paul Misrachi'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jazzhouse.org/gone/lastpost2.php3?edit=920543541 Paul Misraki: 1908-1998]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Constantinople]], [[Ottoman Empire]] (now [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]) into a French [[Jewish]] family of Italian descent, Misraki showed an early aptitude for music. He went to [[Paris]] to study classical composition, and by the 1930s had become an established [[jazz pianist]], [[music arranger|arranger]], and writer of popular songs; around this time he began composing film scores, with his first known work being for [[Jean Renoir]]'s first [[sound film]], ''[[On purge bébé]]'', for which he was uncredited.

Like Renoir, Misraki fled France during the [[World War II]] [[Occupation of France by Nazi Germany|German occupation]]. After a brief stay in [[Argentina]], Misraki ended up in [[Hollywood]], where he composed the music to all of Renoir's American films. After the war, Misraki returned to France, working busily throughout the 1950s, a period when he was routinely scoring half a dozen or more films a year. These included numerous films by [[Yves Allégret]] and [[Jean Boyer (director)|Jean Boyer]], as well as two films by Jacques Becker (''{{Interlanguage link multi|Ali Baba et les quarante voleurs|fr|3=Ali Baba et les Quarante Voleurs (film, 1954)}}'' and ''[[Montparnasse 19]]'') and [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Mr. Arkadin]]''.

The 1960s saw Misraki slow down slightly, writing only 2-3 scores a year. During this period, he worked with many of the leading French directors of the period, including [[Jean-Luc Godard]] (on ''[[Alphaville (film)|Alphaville]]''), Jean-Pierre Melville (on ''[[Le Doulos]]'') and [[Claude Chabrol]], for whom he scored several films.

Misraki composed intermittently throughout the last two decades of his life. He composed his last score at age 85;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0227760/ Vérité en face, La (1993) (TV)]&lt;/ref&gt; by this point he had been working almost exclusively in television for several years. He died of natural causes at age 90 in [[Paris]].

===Career as composer of popular songs===
Misraki first found acclaim as a composer and lyricist of popular songs. His first hit was 1935's "{{Interlanguage link multi|Tout va très bien madame la marquise|fr|3=Tout va très bien madame la marquise (chanson)}}," and during his careers in France, America and Argentina he wrote successful songs in French, English and Spanish.
In 1998, at the age of 90 years, Misraki collaborates with Singer Raquel Bitton on her American  tribute to his songs in a CD entitled "In a Jazzy mood".

===Other interests===

Outside music, Misraki was interested in [[religion]], [[Ufology]] and [[extraterrestrial life]]. Misraki was an early proponent of the [[ancient astronaut]] hypothesis. In 1962 Misraki published his book ''Les Extraterrestres'' in France&lt;ref&gt;Profile of Paul Misraki in UFOs in the 1980s by Jerome Clark, Apogee Books, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; which was later reprinted in English under the title of ''Flying Saucers Through The Ages'' in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;Flying Saucers Through the Ages, Paul Misraki (Paul Thomas), Tandem, G. Gibbons (Translator), new edition 1973, {{ISBN|978-0-426-12722-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; he first published the book under the pen name of ''Paul Thomas'' as he believed that if his real identity was revealed, his reputation as a musician might be damaged; however, he later revealed his identity, and a number of American editions of the book were published under his real name. In the book, Misraki claimed that [[angels]] from the [[Bible]] were [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], that the Bible and other ancient texts are filled with many UFO [[flying saucer]] sightings, and that throughout human history there was intervention from extraterrestrial aliens. Misraki was also one of the first authors to suggest that [[apparitional experience|apparitions]] may be UFO related phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ufoupdateslist.com/1998/nov/m06-012.shtml Profile for Paul Misraki at UFO updates]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ufologist [[Jacques Vallée]] studied some of Misraki's UFO theories and visited Misraki in [[Paris]] in September 1962 to discuss them with him, in his journals Vallée described Misraki as a "deeply reflective man" and a "religious scholar".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Vallee, Forbidden science: journals, 1957-1969, 1993, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Misraki was also a supporter of [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] and his theory of [[omega point]], and wrote a number of papers on his work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teilhard.org/panier/1_fichiers/formation1.MISRAKI.pdf INITIATION À "LA PENSÉE DE TEILHARD"]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3263">'''The period eye''' is a concept that was devised by [[Michael Baxandall]] and described in his innovative ''Painting and Experience in Fifteenth-Century Italy: A Primer in the Social History of Pictorial Style'' where he used it to describe the cultural conditions under which art in the [[Renaissance]] was created, viewed, and understood.

==The concept==
Baxandall argued that everyone processes visual information in the brain in a different way, using a combination of innate skills and skills based on experience, which are often culturally determined. He suggested that cultural factors influence the visual characteristics that are attractive at any particular time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dartfac/features/0102/art.html "In the Eyes of the Beholder" by Tamara Steinert] Dartmouth Faculty Scholarship Today - Features, 2003. Retrieved 23 November 2011.[https://www.webcitation.org/63Q7gHwSO Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; The period eye examines how artists and their works functioned in their original social, commercial and religious context and has been called an "''...anthropological analysis of a society’s visual culture''." &lt;ref&gt;Langdale, A. (1999) "Aspects of the Critical Reception and Intellectual History of Baxandall's Concept of the Period Eye." in Rifkin, A. (ed.) ''About Michael Baxandall''. Wiley-Blackwell, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; that "''...emphasizes the cultural constructedness of vision...''".&lt;ref&gt;Randolph, A.W. (2004), "Gendering the Period Eye: Deschi da Parto and Renaissance Visual Culture" in ''Art History'', Volume 27, Issue 4, pp. 538-562.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept attempts to  reconstruct the mental and visual equipment brought to bear on works of art in a particular place and time and "''...the social acts and cultural practices that shape attention to visual form within a given culture''." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/inmemoriam/michaeldavidkighleybaxandall.html In Memoriam: Michael David Kighley Baxandall by [[Margaretta M. Lovell]] &amp; Elizabeth Honig.] University of California, 2009. Retrieved 23 November 2011. [https://www.webcitation.org/63QB5axud Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Baxandall developed the concept in greater detail in the case-studies in ''The Limewood Sculptors of Renaissance Germany'' (1980) and ''Patterns of Intention'' (1985).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2575466/Michael-Baxandall.html "Michael Baxandall" in ''The Telegraph'' 17 August 2008.] Retrieved 22 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Princess Maria Gabriella of Savoy''' (Maria Gabriella Giuseppa Aldegonda Adelaide Ludovica Felicita Gennara; born 24 February 1940) is the middle daughter of Italy's last king, [[Umberto II of Italy|Umberto II]], and [[Marie José of Belgium]], the "May Queen", and a sister of the [[pretender]] to their father's throne, [[Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples]]. She is an historical writer.

==Life==
Maria Gabriella di Savoia was the third child of the Prince and Princess of Piedmont, born in [[Naples]], Italy in 1940.&lt;ref name="burke"&gt;[[Hugh Massingberd|Montgomery-Massingberd, Hugh]]. "[[Burke's Peerage|Burke’s]] Royal Families of the World: ''Volume I Europe &amp; Latin America'', 1977, p. 367. {{ISBN|0-85011-023-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her older siblings were [[Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Parma|Princess Maria Pia]] and [[Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples|Prince Vittorio Emanuele]], while the younger was [[Princess Maria Beatrice of Savoy|Princess Maria Beatrice]].&lt;ref name=petit&gt;de Badts de Cugnac, Chantal. [[:fr:Guy Coutant de Saisseval|Coutant de Saisseval, Guy]]. Le Petit Gotha. Nouvelle Imprimerie Laballery. Paris. 2002. pp. 620-621. (French) {{ISBN|2-9507974-3-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents, married since 1930, were unhappy together, as her mother confessed in an interview many years later (''On n'a jamais été heureux'', "We were never happy"){{Ref?|date=April 2017}}, and separated after the Italian monarchy was abolished following the [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946|1946 referendum]]. To avoid capture by Nazi troops her mother had fled Italy to neutral Switzerland with Maria Gabriella and her siblings, where they took refuge from September 1943 until their return to Italy in 1945, by which time their father had become lieutenant-general of the kingdom for his father, [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel III]]. Exiled after the fall of the monarchy, the family gathered briefly in Portugal, whence she, her sisters and brother soon returned with their mother to Switzerland, while their father remained in the [[Portuguese Riviera]].&lt;ref name=petit/&gt; Being Catholics, her parents never divorced.

Educated in Switzerland, Maria Gabriella also took courses in a school associated with the [[Louvre]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=petit/&gt; After her father's death, and with her brother's approval, she launched the King Umberto II Foundation in [[Lausanne]], dedicated to preserving the history and legacy of the [[House of Savoy]].&lt;ref name=petit/&gt; She participated in numerous cultural presentations and organized an exhibit in [[Albertville]] during the [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Olympics]].&lt;ref name=petit/&gt; At the beginning of the 21st century she co-authored a number of books, mostly with Stefano Papi.

===Suggested marriage to the Shah of Iran===
In the 1950s, [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi]], Shah of Iran, then divorced from his second wife, indicated his interest in marrying Princess Maria Gabriella. [[Pope John XXIII]] reportedly vetoed the suggestion. In an editorial about the rumors surrounding the marriage of "a Muslim sovereign and a Catholic princess", the [[Holy See|Vatican]] newspaper, ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', wrote that the match constituted "a grave danger."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hofmann, "Pope Bans Marriage of Princess to Shah", ''[[New York Times]]'', 24 February 1959, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and child==
She married Robert Zellinger de Balkany (4 August 1931 in [[Iclod, Cluj|Ichlod]], Romania - 19 September 2015 in [[Geneva]], Switzerland) on 12 February 1969 in [[Sainte-Mesme]]. The religious wedding was celebrated later on 21 June 1969 at [[Èze|Eze-sur-Mer]].&lt;ref name="burke"/&gt; The couple separated in 1976 and divorced in November 1990. They had one child:

* Marie Elizabeth Zellinger de Balkany (born 2 March 1972),&lt;ref name=petit/&gt; married Olivier Janssens (born 1966) on 31 October 2002 and has four children:
** Gabriella Luise Maria Janssens (born 7 March 2004);

The '''Republic of Maryland''' (also known variously as the '''Independent State of Maryland''', '''Maryland-in-Africa''', and '''Maryland in Liberia''') was a small country that existed from 1834 to 1857, when it was merged into what is now [[Liberia]]. The area was first settled in 1834 by freed [[African-American]] slaves and [[free people of color|freeborn African Americans]] primarily from the [[United States|U.S.]] [[U.S. states|state]] of [[Maryland]], under the auspices of the [[Maryland State Colonization Society]].&lt;ref name="Repository p.42"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jx8SAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42 ''The African Repository, Volume 14, p.42] Retrieved March 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Richard, ''On Afric's Shore: A History of Maryland in Liberia, 1834-1857''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The larger [[American Colonization Society]] was founded in 1816; it supported the settlement of thousands of free African Americans to their colony based in [[Monrovia]] in West Africa, along the coast. There were also initially separate settlements founded by state colonization societies of [[Mississippi]], [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Louisiana]]. In 1838, these African-American settlements were united into the Commonwealth of Liberia, which declared its independence from the American Colonization Society in July 26, 1847. The Maryland colony remained separate from Commonwealth of Liberia, as the colonization society wished to maintain its trade monopoly in the area. On February 2, 1841, Maryland-in-Africa became the Independent State of Maryland. Following [[Maryland independence referendum, 1853|an independence referendum]] in 1853, the state declared its independence on May 29, 1854 under the name Maryland in Liberia,&lt;ref name="constitution p.1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aCMSAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 ''Constitution and Laws of Maryland in Liberia'', p.1] Retrieved March 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; with its capital at [[Harper, Liberia|Harper]].

{{main|American Colonization Society}}
{{further|African Americans in Maryland}}
The American Colonization Society had been founded in 1816, in part due to alarms over the violence of the [[Haitian Revolution|Haitian slave revolution and its aftermath]], which resulted in independence for that country in 1804. Fears were raised about the effects of emancipation of slaves in the United States. 

In this period, both slaveholders and abolitionists collaborated on the project to transport free blacks to Africa, though for different purposes. They suggested it was "repatriation" but by this point, most African Americans were native-born in the United States. Slaveholders believed that free blacks threatened the stability of slave societies. Abolitionists hoped to encourage slaveholders to free their slaves and also worried about the discrimination faced by free blacks in the United States. Those who supported relocation to West Africa believed the African-Americans might be able to form a better society for themselves there, away from white discrimination. While thousands of free blacks did relocate to the colony, most{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} free African-Americans opposed this project, claiming their native-born status in the United States and wanting to mitigate inequities there.

Maryland had an increasing proportion of free blacks among its African-American population. During the first two decades after the Revolution, about 25% of blacks were freed, in part because slaveholders were inspired by the war's ideals. Practically, changing labor needs meant that fewer slaves were required.&lt;ref name="freehling"/&gt; By 1810 some 30% of northern Maryland's blacks were free, in what was a more urbanized region,  but so were 20% of blacks in the southern part of the state.&lt;ref name="freehling"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iqdoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA201 William H. Freehling, ''The Road to Disunion: Secessionists at Bay, 1776-1854'', Vol.1, Oxford University Press, 1991, p. 201]&lt;/ref&gt; In the next two decades the number of free blacks increased markedly in the northern part of the state, and many congregated to [[Baltimore]], the state's and the South's largest city.&lt;ref name="freehling"/&gt; By 1830 Maryland had a total of 52,938 free blacks: 51.3% of blacks in northern Maryland were free, and the black population of Baltimore was 75% free. In southern Maryland, free blacks made up 24.7% of the black population.&lt;ref name="freehling"/&gt;

The [[Maryland State Colonization Society]] was originally a branch of the American Colonization Society, which had founded the colony of Liberia at [[Monrovia]] on January 7, 1822. The Maryland Society decided to establish a new settlement of its own to accommodate its emigrants and with the intention of controlling trade to the colony. In December 1831, the Maryland state legislature in the United States appropriated US$10,000 for 26 years to transport 10,000 free blacks and ex-slaves, and 400 Caribbean slaves from the [[United States]] and the Caribbean islands, respectively, to Africa. It founded the Maryland State Colonization Society for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=e_cMAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22cape+palmas%22+%22maryland+state+colonization+society%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=OFh80PmmPS&amp;sig=kH-uIKuFbdQUvQk4YbI2YckqxUE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA7,M1 Latrobe, John H. B., p.125, ''Maryland in Liberia: a History of the Colony Planted By the Maryland State Colonization Society Under the Auspices of the State of Maryland, U. S. At Cape Palmas on the South-West Coast of Africa, 1833-1853'', published in 1885.] Retrieved 16 Feb 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Settlement of Cape Palmas===

[[File:Cape Palmas etch.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Etching of [[Cape Palmas]], circa 1853.]]
[[File:Cape Palmas mission.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Cape Palmas]] mission, circa 1840.]]

The first area in the Republic of Maryland to be settled by the Maryland Colonization Society was [[Cape Palmas]], in 1834, somewhat south of the rest of the American colony.&lt;ref name="Repository p.42" /&gt; The Cape is a small, rocky peninsula connected to the mainland by a sandy isthmus. Immediately to the west of the peninsula is the estuary of the [[Hoffman River]]. Approximately 21&amp;nbsp;km (15&amp;nbsp;mi) along the coast to the east, the [[Cavalla River]] empties into the sea, marking the border between Liberia and the [[Ivory Coast]]. It marks the western limit of the [[Gulf of Guinea]], according to the International Hydrographic Organisation (IHO).

Most of the settlers &lt;!-- Number? years settled? --&gt;were freed [[African-American]] slaves and freeborn African Americans primarily from the [[U.S. states|state]] of [[Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hall, ''On Afric's Shore: A History of Maryland in Liberia, 1834-1857,'' Baltimore: Maryland Historical Society, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Colonization Society organizers thought they could establish new trading ties by relocating African Americans to West Africa. The colony was named Maryland In Africa (also known as Maryland in Liberia) on February 12, 1834.

===John Brown Russwurm===
[[File:Jbruss.jpg|thumb|150px|John Brown Russwurm, first black governor of Maryland in Africa from 1836-1851.]]

In 1836 the colony appointed its first black governor, [[John Brown Russwurm]] (1799–1851), who served as governor for more than a dozen years until his death. Russwurm encouraged the immigration of [[African Americans]] to Maryland in Africa, and supported agriculture and trade.&lt;ref name=TCL&gt;{{cite news | url = http://communityleader.mainetoday.com/story.html?ID=978 | title = Crossing the color line | last = Lear | first = Alex | date = 2006-12-07 | publisher = The Community Leader | accessdate = 2008-01-31 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110714021323/http://communityleader.mainetoday.com/story.html?ID=978 | archivedate = 2011-07-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had begun his career working as the colonial secretary for the [[American Colonization Society]] between 1830 and 1834. He also worked as the editor of the ''[[Liberia Herald]].'' He resigned this post in 1835 to protest America's colonization policies.&lt;!-- What, specifically? --&gt;

In 1838, a number of other [[Americo-Liberian|American]] settlements on the west coast of Africa united to form the [[Commonwealth of Liberia]], which declared its independence in July 26, 1847. 

The colony of Maryland in Liberia remained independent, as the Maryland State Colonization Society wished to maintain its trade monopoly in the area. On February 2, 1841, Maryland-in-Africa was granted statehood and became the State of Maryland. In 1847 the Maryland State Colonization Society published the ''Constitution and Laws of Maryland in Liberia'', based on the [[United States Constitution]].

===Declaration of Independence, and annexation by Liberia===
On May 29, 1854, the State of Maryland declared its independence, naming itself Maryland in Liberia,&lt;ref name="constitution p.1" /&gt; with its capital at [[Harper, Liberia|Harper]]. It was also known as the Republic of Maryland. It held the land along the coast between the [[Grand Cess]] and [[San Pedro River (Liberia)|San Pedro]] rivers. It lasted three years as an independent state.

Soon afterward, local tribes including the [[Grebo (ethnic group)|Grebo]] and the [[Kru people|Kru]] attacked the State of Maryland in retaliation for its disruption of the slave trade, by which they had profited.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Unable to maintain its own defense, Maryland appealed for help to Liberia, its more powerful neighbor. President Roberts sent military assistance, and an alliance of Marylanders and Liberian militia troops successfully repelled the local tribesmen. The Republic of Maryland recognized that it could not survive as an independent state, and following a [[Maryland annexation referendum, 1857|referendum]], Maryland was annexed by Liberia on April 6, 1857, becoming known as [[Maryland County]].

{{Theosophy}}
'''Root races''' are stages in human [[evolution]] in the [[esoteric cosmology]] of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]], as described in her book ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' (1888). These races existed mainly on [[Lost lands|now-lost continents]]. Blavatsky's model was developed by later theosophists, most notably [[William Scott-Elliot]] in ''The Story of Atlantis'' (1896) and ''The Lost Lemuria'' (1904). [[Annie Besant]] further developed the model in [[Man: whence, how and whither, a record of clairvoyant investigation|''Man: Whence, How and Whither'']] (1913). Both Besant and Scott-Elliot relied on information from [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] obtained by "astral clairvoyance". Further elaboration was provided by [[Rudolf Steiner]] in ''Atlantis and Lemuria'' (1904).&lt;ref&gt;''Atlantis and Lemuria, The Submerged Continents of Atlantis and Lemuria, Cosmic Memory (Prehistory of Earth and Man), Aus der Akasha-Chronik.'' Rudolf Steiner (Written 1904; GA 11 / Bn 11)[http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA011/] English Edition, trans. Max Gysi [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA011/English/TPS1911/GA011_cover.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf Steiner, and subsequent theosophist authors, have called the time periods associated with these races, '''Epochs''' (Steiner felt that the term "race" was not adequate anymore for modern humanity).

==Sources==
According to historian [[James Webb (historian)|James Webb]], the [[occult]] concept of succeeding [[prehistory|prehistoric]] races, as later adopted by Blavatsky, was first introduced by the French author [[Antoine Fabre d'Olivet]] in his ''Histoire philosophique du genre humain'' (1824).&lt;ref&gt;James Webb, ''The Occult Underground'', Open Court, La Salle 1974, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, historian Goffe Jensma claims that the concept of root races was first articulated in the Dutch esotericist book [[Oera Linda]], which was translated into English by William Sandbach in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;Jensma, Goffe (November 2007), "How to Deal with Holy Books in an Age of Emerging Science. The Oera Linda Book as a New Age Bible", Fabula 48 (3–4): 229–249&lt;/ref&gt; Also prior to Blavatsky, the root races were described by the English theosophist [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]] in [[Esoteric Buddhism (book)|''Esoteric Buddhism'']] (1883).

==Locations of the proposed former continents==
Some post-theosophical writers, attempting to reconcile current geological science with some earlier theosophical teachings, have equated [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]] with the former [[supercontinent]] of [[Gondwana]], but this is not theosophy. Early theosophical teachings agree with the original statements of [[Eduard Suess]], who argued that Gondwanaland consisted of parts of the present continents in their present positions, but joined to one another by other lands that have since been submerged. This is also the position of Master [[Samael Aun Weor]].

[[Atlantis]], in the Theosophical cosmology, was a continent that covered a significant part of what is now the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;See L. Sprague de Camp, ''Lost Continents: The Atlantis Theme in History, Science, and Literature'', Dover Publications, 1970 for a scientific analysis of the concept of lost continents.&lt;/ref&gt; The large continent of Atlantis is said to have "first divided, and then broken later on into seven peninsulas and islands". When the main part of Atlantis began to sink, Atlantean settlers migrated to the new lands which were rising to the east, west, and south. These new lands became the Americas, Africa, parts of Asia, and the present European countries, stretching from the [[Ural Mountains]] of Russia, westward to include the islands of Ireland and Britain, and even farther westward than that in former times. Some emigrants from the remaining islands in the Atlantic settled on new islands to the east which later consolidated into what is now the district of the Abyssinian highlands and lands somewhat to the north. Atlantis perished through flooding and submergence in 9,564 BC,&lt;ref name="Powell-50"/&gt; and its destruction is explained by claiming successive disturbances in the axial rotation of Earth which caused [[earthquake]]s, which led to the sudden sinking of Atlantis.

==Root races, epochs and sub-races==

According to Blavatsky's writings, there will be seven root races assembled for our Earth; each root race is divided into seven subraces.  Only five root races have appeared so far;{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=236}} the sixth is expected to emerge in the 28th century. [[Francis Bacon]] (whom theosophy considers to be the legendary [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|Count of St. Germain]]) in his work ''The New Atlantis'' (1627) describes a potential future civilisation which lives on a land called Bensalem.

===The first root race (Polarian)===

The first root race was "[[Etheric plane|ethereal]]", i.e. they were composed of etheric matter.  They reproduced by dividing like an [[amoeba]].  Earth was still cooling at that time. The first mountain to arise out of the stormy primeval ocean was [[Mount Meru]].&lt;ref name="Powell-31"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 188-192. (Ch. 31. "The Earth: The first root-race.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The second root race (Hyperborean)===
The second root race lived in [[Hyperborea]]. The second root race was colored golden yellow.  Hyperborea included what is now Northern Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia, Northern Asia and [[Kamchatka]].  The climate was [[Tropical climate|tropical]] because Earth had not yet developed an axial tilt.  The esoteric name of their continent is ''Plaksha'';&lt;ref name="Powell-11"/&gt; they called themselves the ''Kimpurshas''.  They reproduced by [[budding]].&lt;ref name="Powell-32"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 193-196. (Ch. 32. "The Earth: The second root-race.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The third root race (Lemurian)===
[[File:Map of Lemuria.jpg|thumb|Map of Lemuria superimposed over the modern continents from William Scott-Elliot, ''The Story of Atlantis and Lost Lemuria''.]]
The third root race, the Lemurian lived in [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]].  The esoteric name of Lemuria is ''Shalmali''.&lt;ref name="Powell-11"/&gt; Lemuria, according to Theosophists, existed in a large part of what is now the Indian Ocean including Australia and extending into the South Pacific Ocean; its last remnants are the Australian continent, the island of [[New Guinea]], and the island of [[Madagascar]].  Lemuria sank gradually and was eventually destroyed by incessantly erupting volcanoes.&lt;ref name="Powell-33"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 193-215. (Ch. 33. "The Earth: The third root-race: Lemurian.)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was thought by geologists that the [[Age of the Earth|age of the earth]] was only about 200 million years (because [[radioactive dating]] had not yet come into use), so the [[geological epoch]]s were believed to have occurred at a much later time than is thought to be the case today.  According to traditional Theosophy, the Lemurian root race began 34½ million years ago, in the middle of what was then believed to be the [[Jurassic]]; thus, the people of Lemuria coexisted with the [[dinosaur]]s. The Lemurian race was much taller and bigger than our current race.{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=236}} The first three subraces of the Lemurians reproduced by laying eggs, but the fourth subrace, beginning 16½ million years ago, began to reproduce like modern humans.&lt;ref name="Powell-33"/&gt; As Lemuria was slowly submerged due to volcanic eruptions, the Lemurians colonized the areas surrounding Lemuria, i.e. Africa, Southern India and the East Indies. The descendants of the Lemurian root race, according to traditional Theosophy, include the [[Capoid race]], the [[Bantu people|Congoid race]], the [[Dravidians]], and the [[Australoid race]].

===The fourth root race (Atlantean)===
This race inhabited Atlantis.

====Subraces of the Atlantean root race====

The fourth root race, the Atlantean, according to Theosophy arose approximately 4,500,000 years ago in Africa from the fourth subrace of the Lemurians in a part of Africa that had been colonized by that subrace in the area now inhabited by the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]].&lt;ref name="Powell-35"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 219-224. Ch. 35. "The fourth (Atlantean) root-race: The Rmoahal".&lt;/ref&gt; According to Theosophists the first Atlantean subrace was the result of the last, or seventh Lemurian subrace, [[Manu (Theosophy)#Theosophy|Chankshusha Manu]], which migrated first to the south of the Atlantean continent and, from there, migrated further north.  The esoteric name of [[Atlantis]] is ''Kusha''.&lt;ref name="Powell-11"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 55-59. (Ch. 11. "Races and Sub-races".)&lt;/ref&gt; The Atlantean root race had [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian]] features; they began with bronze skin and gradually evolved into the [[Color terminology for race|red]] [[American Indian race|American Indian]], [[Color terminology for race|brown]] [[Malayan race|Malayan]], and [[Color terminology for race|yellow]] [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian]] races, because some Atlanteans eventually migrated to the Americas and Asia. The seven subraces of the Atlantean root race were
#the Rmoahal
#the Tlavati ([[Cro-Magnon]]s)
#the [[Toltec]] (a term which Theosophists use as a synonym for the Atlantean ancestors of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]])
#the [[Turanian]]
#the original [[Semites]] (i.e. [[Phoenicians]])
#the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]]s, and
#the [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian]], which migrated to and colonized [[Central Asia]], [[East Asia]], and [[Southeast Asia]].

The descendants of the Atlanteans according to traditional Theosophy include those of the [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian race]], the [[Malayan race]], and the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian race]] as well as some people of what in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was called the "[[Olive skin|olive-skinned]]" [[Mediterranean race]].&lt;ref name="Powell-35"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-36"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 25-26. (Ch. 36. "The second Atlantean sub-race: the Tlavatli".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-38"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-39"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 252-263. (Ch. 39. "Ancient Peru: A Toltec remnant".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-40"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 264-265. (Ch. 40. "The fourth Atlantean sub-race: the Turanian".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-41"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 266-276. (Ch. 41. "A Turanian : Chaldae, B.C. 19,000".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-42"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 276-278. (Ch. 42. "The fifth Atlantean sub-race: the original Semites".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-43"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 279-280. (Ch. 43. "The sixth Atlantean sub-race: the Akkadian".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-44"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 281. (Ch. 44. "The seventh Atlantean sub-race: the Mongolian".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-45"/&gt;

====The civilization of Atlantis====
{{anchor|civil-atl}}&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Maitreya (Theosophy)]] --&gt;
{{Main|Atlantis}}

During the long period of time when Atlantis was ruled by the Toltecs (the ancestors of the [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Amerindians]]), the civilization of Atlantis was at its height. This was the period between about 1,000,000 and 900,000 years ago, called the ''[[Golden Age]] of Atlantis''. The Atlanteans had many luxuries and conveniences. Their capital city was called ''The City of the Golden Gates''. At its height, it had two million inhabitants. There were extensive [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]s leading to the city from a mountain lake. The Atlanteans had [[airship]]s powered by the [[vril]] that could seat two to eight people. The [[economic system]] was [[Socialism|socialist]] like that of the [[Incas]]. Atlanteans were the first to develop organized warfare. The military deployed vril-powered air battleships that contained 50 to 100 fighting men. These air battleships deployed [[Chemical warfare|poison gas]] bombs. The [[infantry]] fired fire-tipped arrows. The Toltecs on Atlantis worshipped the [[Sun worship|Sun]] in temples as grand as those of [[ancient Egypt]] that were decorated in bright colors. The sacred word used in [[meditation]] was [[Tau]] (this was the equivalent of the Aryan sacred word [[Om]]). As noted above, the Toltecs colonized all of North America and South America and thus became the people we know as the Amerindians.&lt;ref name=Powell-37&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 227-236. (Ch. 37. "The Third Atlantean Subrace: The Toltec".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Powell-38&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 237-251. (Ch. 38. "The Civilization of Atlantis".)&lt;/ref&gt; The downfall of Atlantis started when some of the Toltecs began to practice [[black magic]] about 850,000 BC, corrupted by the dragon "Thevetat",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Atlantis and the Cycles of Time: Prophecies, Traditions, and Occult Revelations | first=Joscelyn | last=Godwin | publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co | year=2010 | isbn=1594772622 | page=68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; remembered as [[Devadatta]], the opponent of [[Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Five Years of Theosophy | editor=George Robert Snow Mead | publisher=Echo Library | year=2007 | isbn=1406815284 | page=181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The people began to become selfish and [[Economic materialism|materialistic]]. Soon thereafter, the Turanians (the ancestors of the people we now know as the [[Turkic peoples]]) became dominant in much of Atlantis. The Turanians continued the practice of black magic which reached its height about 250,000 BC and continued until the final sinking of Atlantis, although they were opposed by [[Magic (paranormal)|white magic]]ians. The Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]] incarnated as the Emperor of Atlantis in 220,000 BC to oppose the black magicians.&lt;ref name="Besant-127"&gt;Besant/Leadbeater, ''Man: How, Whence, and Whither?'', p. 127-137. (Ch. 9 "Black Magic in Atlantis".)&lt;/ref&gt; The black magicians used [[magical spell]]s to breed human-animal [[Chimera (genetics)#Chimeras in research|chimeras]] to use as [[sex slave]]s. They also had an army composed of chimeras that were composites composed of a human body with the heads of fierce predators such as lions, tigers and bears, that ate enemy corpses on the battlefield.&lt;ref name="Besant-127"/&gt; The war between the white magicians and the [[black magic]]ians continued until the end of Atlantis. The [[Ascended master|Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] [[telepathy|telepathically]] warned their disciples (the white magicians) to flee Atlantis in ships while there was still time to get out before the final [[wiktionary:Cataclysm|cataclysm]]. As noted above, the final sudden submergence of Atlantis due to earthquakes occurred in 9,564 BC .&lt;ref name="Powell-50"/&gt;

==={{anchor|aryas}}The fifth root race (Aryan)&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] [[Aryan]] --&gt;===

====Early beginnings of the Aryan root race====

Blavatsky asserted humanity was in the fifth root race, the [[Aryan race]], which Theosophists believe to have emerged from the previous fourth root race (Atlantean root race) beginning about 100,000 years ago in Atlantis.  (According to Powell, when Madame Blavatsky stated the Aryan root race was 1,000,000 years old, she meant that the [[soul]]s of the people that later physically incarnated as the first Aryans about 100,000 years ago began to incarnate in the bodies of Atlanteans 1,000,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=Powell-37/&gt; However, another way of interpreting this is that Nature began to create the Aryan race before the final cataclysms.) Theosophists believe the Aryan root race was physically progenerated by the [[Manu (Theosophy)#Theosophy|Vaivasvatu Manu]], one of the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]].  The present-day ethnic group most closely related to the new race is the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]].  The small band of only 9,000 people constituting the then small Aryan root race migrated out of Atlantis in 79,797 BC. The [[bard]]s of the new [[White people|white]] root-race poetically referred to the new race as being ''moon-colored''.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. and Besant, Annie ''Main: Whence, How, and Whither?'' Wheaton, Illinois:1913 Theosophical Press Pages 249-254&lt;/ref&gt; A small group of these Aryan migrants from Atlantis split from the main body of migrants and went south to the shore of an inland sea in what was then a verdant and lush [[Sahara]] where they founded the "City of the Sun". The main body of migrants continued onwards to an island called the "white island" in the middle of what was then an inland sea in what is now the [[Gobi desert]], where they established the "City of the Bridge".&lt;ref name="Powell-45"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 282-286. (Ch. 45. "The Beginnings of the Fifth (Aryan) Root Race".)&lt;/ref&gt; (The "City of the Bridge" was constructed directly below the [[Etheric plane|etheric]] city called [[Shamballa]] where Theosophists believe the governing [[deity]] of Earth, [[Sanat Kumara]], dwells; thus, the ongoing evolution of the Aryan root race has been divinely guided by the being Theosophists call "The Lord of the World".)

The esoteric name of the whole of the present land surface of Earth, i.e. the [[Afro-Eurasia|World Island]], the Americas, the Australian continent and Antarctica taken as a whole is ''Krauncha''.&lt;ref name="Powell-11"/&gt;

Generally speaking, a large percentage of the people who live in the time of the period of the fifth root race are part of the fifth root race. However Blavatsky also opines that some [[Semitic peoples]] have become "degenerate in spirituality".  She asserted that some peoples descended from the Lemurians are "semi-animal creatures".  These latter include "the [[Tasmanian Aborigines|Tasmanians]], a portion of the [[Australian Aborigines|Australians]] and a mountain tribe in China." There are also "considerable numbers of the mixed Lemuro-Atlantean peoples produced by various crossings with such semi-human stocks -- e.g., the wild men of Borneo, the [[Veddhas]] of [[Ceylon]], most of the remaining [[Australian Aborigines|Australians]], [[Bushmen]], [[Negritos]], [[Andaman Islanders]], etc."&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'' vol. 2, p. 195f.&lt;/ref&gt; All these aforementioned groups mentioned by Blavatsky except the purported "wild men of Borneo" (not to be confused with the famous circus duo, the [[Wild Men of Borneo]]) are part of what was in the late 19th and most of the 20th century was called the [[Australoid race]] (except for the [[Bushmen]], part of the [[Capoid race]]), both of which races, as noted above, were believed by traditional Theosophists to have been descended from the Lemurians.

====Subraces of the Aryan root race====

Blavatsky described the fifth root race with the following words: ''"The Aryan races, for instance, now varying from dark brown, almost black, red-brown-yellow, down to the whitest creamy colour, are yet all of one and the same stock&amp;nbsp;– the Fifth Root-Race&amp;nbsp;– and spring from one single progenitor'',&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'', vol. 2, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; which Hindus call [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]. Theosophists believe that each root race has a separate and distinct progenitor.

The subraces of the Aryan Fifth Root Race include the first subrace, the [[Indo-Aryans|Hindu]], which migrated from the "City of the Bridge" on the white island in the middle of the Gobi inland sea to [[India]] in 60,000 BC; the second subrace, the [[Arabs|Arabian]], which migrated from the "City of the Bridge" to [[Arabia]] in 40,000 BC; the third subrace, the [[Iranian peoples|Persian]], which migrated from the "City of the Bridge" to [[Persia]] in 30,000 BC; the fourth subrace, the [[Celts]], which migrated from the "City of the Bridge" to [[Western Europe]] beginning in 20,000 BC (the [[Mycenaeans|Mycenaean Greeks]] are regarded as an offshoot of the Celtic subrace that colonized Southeast Europe); and the fifth subrace, the [[Teutons|Teutonic]], which also migrated from the "City of the Bridge" to what is now Germany beginning in 20,000 BC (the [[Slav]]s are regarded as an offshoot of the Teutonic subrace that colonized Russia and surrounding areas).&lt;ref name="Powell-50"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 308-316. (Ch. 50. "The fourth Aryan sub-race: The Keltic, B.C. 20,000".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-45"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-46"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 287-289. (Ch. 46. "The City of the Bridge".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-47"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 290-294. (Ch. 47. "The first Aryan sub-race: The Hindu, B.C. 60,000".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-48"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 295-301. (Ch. 48. "The second Aryan sub-race: The Arabian, B.C. 40,000".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-49"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 302-307. (Ch. 49. "The third Aryan sub-race: The Iranian, B.C. 30,000".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-51"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 317-320. (Ch. 51. "The fourth Aryan sub-race: The Teutonic, B.C. 20,000".)&lt;/ref&gt;

====The emergence of the sixth subrace of the Aryan root race====

According to Blavatsky the sixth subrace of the Aryan root race will begin to evolve in the area of the United States in the early 21st century.  This sixth subrace of the Aryan root race will be called the ''Australo-American subrace'' and is believed by Theosophists to be now arising from the Teutonic subrace of the Aryan root race in Australia and in the Western United States (many individuals of the new subrace will be born in [[California]]) and its surrounding nearby areas (i.e., the Australo-American subrace is in arising from the [[European Americans|Anglo-American]], [[English Canadians|Anglo-Canadian]], [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|Anglo-Australian]] and presumably also the [[New Zealand European|Anglo-New Zealander]] [[ethnic group]]s).&lt;ref name="Powell-52"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 326-330. (Ch. 52 "The Aryan Sixth Sub-Race").&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth or Australo-American sub-race will "possess certain [[psychic powers]], and for this the [[pituitary body]] will be developed, thus giving an additional sense, that of cognising [[Aura (paranormal)|astral emotions]] in the ordinary waking consciousness. We may say that in general the sixth sub-race will bring in wisdom and intuition, blending all that is best in the intelligence of the fifth subrace and the emotion of the fourth."&lt;ref name="Powell-52"/&gt;

===The sixth root race===

According to [[C. W. Leadbeater]], a colony will be established in [[Baja California]] by the [[Theosophical Society]] under the guidance of the [[Ascended masters|Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] in the 28th century for the intensive selective [[Eugenics|eugenic]] breeding of the sixth root race.  The Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]] will physically incarnate in order to be the [[Manu (Theosophy)|Manu]] ("progenitor") of this new root race.&lt;ref name="Besant-353"&gt;Besant/Leadbeater, ''Man: How, Whence, and Whither?'', p. 353-495.&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, the world will be powered by [[nuclear power]] and there will be a single [[world government]] led by a person who will be the reincarnation of [[Julius Caesar]].&lt;ref name="Besant-353"/&gt; Tens of thousands of years in the future, a new continent will arise in the Pacific Ocean that will be the future home of the sixth root race.&lt;ref name="Powell-54"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 330-347. (Ch. 54. "The sixth and seventh root-races.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[California]] west of the [[San Andreas Fault]] will break off from the mainland of North America and become the [[Island of California]] off the eastern coast of the new continent.&lt;ref name="Powell-52"/&gt;

====Subraces of the sixth root race====

[[Victor Skumin]] proposed a [[definition]] and classification of '''''Homo spiritalis''''' ([[Latin]]: "spiritual man"), the sixth root race,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Victor Skumin|Skumin]] |first=V.

===The seventh root race===

The seventh root race will arise from the seventh subrace of the sixth root race on the future continent that the sixth root race will be living on that will arise from the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name="Powell-54"/&gt; The continent they will inhabit is esoterically called ''[[Pushkara]]''.&lt;ref name="Powell-11"/&gt;

==Migration to Mercury==

It is believed by some [[Neo-Theosophy|Neo-Theosophists]] that after the present [[Round (Theosophy)|round]] of human spiritual evolution by reincarnation of [[soul]]s in root races is completed several dozen million years from now, the human race will migrate to the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] to continue its spiritual and physical evolution.&lt;ref name="Powell-54"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritofra.com/EC_etheric_planes.htm Planetary Schemes of Our Solar System According to Theosophy:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theosophical belief in the brotherhood of humanity==

Modern writers within theosophy or influenced by theosophy defend Blavatsky's use of the terms Aryan race and root race as "not connected to demagogic ideas".{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} They say{{who|date=September 2014}} that the classification of humanity into races is still practiced today and that Blavatsky and subsequent [[esoteric]] philosophers who expressed similar lines of thought intended a Universal Brotherhood of humanity. Yet root race philosophy is not void of directly biologically racial elements.

Blavatsky promulgated her ideology in a layered, multidimensional style and way, and paradoxical truth was key to her metaphysics. Seemingly paradoxical statements underpin root race theoretic philosophy existing beyond bifurcations of "liberal" or "illiberal" notions. Blavatsky wrote that, while "all men have spiritually and physically the same origin" and that "mankind is essentially of one and the same essence"&lt;ref&gt;''The Key to Theosophy'', Section 3&lt;/ref&gt;—nevertheless, in ''The Secret Doctrine'', Blavatsky posits: "Verily mankind is 'of one blood,' but not of the same essence." The interrelationship between spirituality and root race developmental history is nonlinear and complex. Thus: "Esoteric history teaches that idols and their worship died out with the Fourth Race, until the survivors of the hybrid races of the latter (The Chinese, Africans, etc.,.) gradually brought the worship back." &lt;ref name="doctrine"&gt;Blavatsky, Helena, ''The Secret Doctrine'', Vol. 2, Page  294. [http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sd/sd2-1-17.htm Online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first aim of the Theosophical Society she founded is "To form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or colour", and her writings also include references emphasizing the unity of humanity: "all men have spiritually and physically the same origin" and that "mankind is essentially of one and the same essence".{{sfn|Blavatsky|1962|loc=Section 3}}

Cranston quoted Blavatsky saying that in reality there is no inferior or low-grade races because all of it are one common humankind.{{sfn|Cranston|1995|p=400}} {{sfn|Blavatsky|1888b|loc=Stanza IX}}

The '''''Tallinn Manual''''' (originally entitled, ''Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare'') is an academic, non-binding study on how international law (in particular the [[jus ad bellum]] and [[international humanitarian law]]) applies to cyber conflicts and [[cyber warfare]]. Between 2009 and 2012, the ''Tallinn Manual'' was written at the invitation of the [[Tallinn]]-based [[NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence]] by an international group of approximately twenty experts. In April 2013, the manual was published by [[Cambridge University Press]].

In late 2009, the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence convened an international group of legal scholars and practitioners to draft a manual addressing the issue of how to interpret international law in the context of cyber operations and cyber warfare. As such, it was the first effort to analyse this topic comprehensively and authoritatively and to bring some degree of clarity to the associated complex legal issues.&lt;ref name="SchmittMichael"&gt;Schmitt, Michael N (Gen. ed.) (2013). ''Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare''. New York, United States of America: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process and authors ==
Collectively calling themselves the International Group of Experts, the authors of the ''Tallinn Manual'' include highly respected legal scholars and legal practitioners with experience in cyber issues who were consulted throughout the duration of the project by information technology specialists. The group was led by Professor [[Michael N. Schmitt]], chairman of the international law department at the United States [[Naval War College]], who also served as the project director. Other members of the group included Professor Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg from [[Viadrina European University]], Air Commodore (ret.) William H. Boothby from the United Kingdom [[Royal Air Force]], Professor Thomas C. Wingfield from the [[George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies]], Bruno Demeyere formerly from the [[Université catholique de Louvain|Catholic University of Leuven]], Professor Eric Talbot Jensen from [[Brigham Young University]], Professor Sean Watts from [[Creighton University]], Dr. Louise Arimatsu from [[Chatham House]], Captain (Navy) Geneviève Bernatchez from the office of the judge advocate general of the [[Canadian Forces]], Colonel Penny Cumming from the [[Australian Defence Force]], Professor Robin Geiss from the [[University of Potsdam]], Professor Terry D. Gill from the [[University of Amsterdam]], Netherlands Defence Academy, and [[Utrecht University]], Professor Derek Jinks from the [[University of Texas]], Professor Jann Kleffner from the [[Swedish National Defence College]], Dr. Nils Melzer from the [[Geneva Centre for Security Policy]], and Brigadier General (ret.) [[Kenneth Watkin]] from the [[Canadian Forces]]. The technical advisors were Professor James Bret Michael from the United States [[Naval Postgraduate School]] as well as Dr. Kenneth Geers and Dr. Rain Ottis, both of whom previously were associated with the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence.

Three organisations were represented by observers throughout the drafting process: [[NATO]] through its [[Allied Command Transformation]] due to the relationship of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence with NATO,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_68372.htm |title=NATO – Topic: Centres of Excellence |publisher=Nato.int |date=2012-07-30 |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] because of its “guardian” role of international humanitarian law, and [[United States Cyber Command]] due to its ability to provide the perspective of an operationally mature entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=14030 |title=News Release: Cyber Command Achieves Full Operational Capability |publisher=Defense.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; To add to the academic credibility of the ''Tallinn Manual'', prior to publication it was peer-reviewed by thirteen international legal scholars.&lt;ref name="SchmittMichael"/&gt;

When a draft of the ''Tallinn Manual'' was posted on the web site of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccdcoe.org/249.html |title=The Tallinn Manual |publisher=Ccdcoe.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424162717/http://ccdcoe.org/249.html |archivedate=2013-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it immediately drew the attention of the legal community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyle |first=Ashley |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/251279-international-law-takes-on-cyber-significant-challengs-ahead |title=International law takes on cyber: significant challenges ahead  |publisher=Thehill.com |date=2012-09-24 |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as online media outlets reporting mainly on technology questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securityweek.com/security-think-tank-analyzes-how-international-law-applies-cyber-war |title=Security Think Tank Analyzes How International Law Applies to Cyber War |publisher=SecurityWeek.Com |date=2012-09-04 |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, after its official publication on March 15, 2013 at Chatham House, the issue of international law and how that governs cyber warfare was discussed widely among international media with references to the manual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/03/can-nato-drone-computer-hackers; |title=Politics |publisher=Mother Jones |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nakashima |first=Ellen |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/in-cyberwarfare-rules-of-engagement-still-hard-to-define/2013/03/10/0442507c-88da-11e2-9d71-f0feafdd1394_story.html |title=In cyberwarfare, rules of engagement still hard to define  |publisher=Articles.washingtonpost.com |date=2013-03-10 |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mark Gollom |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2013/03/20/f-cyber-attacks-international-law.html |title=Are there international rules for cyberwarfare?  |publisher=CBC News|date=2013-03-21 |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although frequently referred to as a NATO manual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Owen Bowcott, legal affairs correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/18/rules-cyberwarfare-nato-manual; |title=Rules of cyberwar: don't target nuclear plants or hospitals, says Nato manual &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2013-03-18|accessdate=2013-04-20 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Technology |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/9939401/Rules-of-cyberwar-set-out-for-first-time-in-Nato-manual.html |title=Rules of cyberwar set out for first time in Nato manual |publisher=Telegraph |date= 2013-03-19|accessdate=2013-04-20 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is incorrect. The ''Tallinn Manual'' is an independent academic research product representing only the views of its authors in their personal capacity. The manual does not represent the views of NATO nor any other organisation or state, including those represented by the observers. Being the first authoritative restatement of the application and interpretation of international law in the cyber context, however, it may be anticipated that the manual will have an effect on how states and organisations will formulate their approaches and positions in those matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koh |first=Harold Hongju |url=http://www.harvardilj.org/2012/12/online_54_koh/ |title=International Law in Cyberspace: Remarks of Harold Koh |publisher= Harv.

== Format ==
The practice of producing non-binding manuals on the application of international humanitarian law is not new. The ''Tallinn Manual'' followed in the footsteps of similar efforts, such as the [[International Institute of Humanitarian Law]]’s [[San Remo Manual]] on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea and the Harvard Program on Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research’s [[HPCR Manual on International Law Applicable to Air and Missile Warfare|Manual on International Law Applicable to Air and Missile Warfare]].

The manual is divided into sections referred to as “black letter rules” and their accompanying commentary. Essentially, the rules are restatements of international law in the cyber context, as understood and agreed to, by all of the authors. Since the adoption of any rule required consensus among the authors (not including the observers) the commentary attached to each rule serves a critical purpose of outlining differences of opinion as to the precise application of the rule. The commentary also identifies the legal basis of the rules, explains their normative content, and addresses practical implications in the cyber context.&lt;ref name="SchmittMichael" /&gt;

==Tallinn 2.0==
Tallinn 2.0, which followed the original manual, was designed to expand the scope of the ''Tallinn Manual''. Tallinn 2.0 was released in February 2017 and published by Cambridge University Press in the form of a book.&lt;ref name="http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/law/humanitarian-law/tallinn-manual-20-international-law-applicable-cyber-operations-2nd-edition?format=PB#y2Xr611vIwu3vIey.97"&gt; Cambridge University Press, February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2017/02/09/what-tallinn-manual-2-0-teaches-us-about-the-new-cyber-order/#2e000999928b"&gt; Leetaru, Kalev. ''Forbes''. "What Tallinn Manual 2.0 teaches us about the new cyber order." Retrieved 15 June, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus of the original ''Tallinn Manual'' is on the most disruptive and destructive cyber operations—those that qualify as ‘armed attacks’ and therefore allowing states to respond in self-defense—and those taking place during armed conflict. Since the threat of cyber operations with such consequences is especially alarming to states, most academic research has focused on these issues. Tallinn 2.0 refers to cyber "operations" as opposed to cyber "conflict" from the original Tallinn Manual.&lt;ref name="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2017/02/09/what-tallinn-manual-2-0-teaches-us-about-the-new-cyber-order/#2e000999928b"&gt; Leetaru, Kalev. ''Forbes''. "What Tallinn Manual 2.0 teaches us about the new cyber order." Retrieved 15 June, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

States are challenged daily, however, by malevolent cyber operations that do not rise to the aforementioned level. The Tallinn 2.0 project examines the international legal framework that applies to such cyber operations. The relevant legal regimes include the law of state responsibility, the law of the sea, international telecommunications law, space law, diplomatic and consular law, and, with respect to individuals, human rights law. Tallinn 2.0 also explores how the general principles of international law, such as sovereignty, jurisdiction, due diligence, and the prohibition of intervention, apply in the cyber context.

A senior fellow at the centre, Professor Michael Schmitt from the United States Naval War College and the University of Exeter, directs the Tallinn 2.0 project. Ms. Liis Vihul of the centre serves as its project manager. A team of legal and IT experts from the centre supports the effort. Similarly to its predecessor, the expanded edition of the ''Tallinn Manual'' will represent only the views of the International Group of Experts, but not of NATO, the NATO CCD COE, its sponsoring nations, nor any other state or organization.&lt;ref&gt;Nato Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence.

'''''The Boy and the Blind Man''''' ({{lang-fr|Le Garçon et l'aveugle}}) is the name of a 13th-century [[France|French]] play; considered the oldest surviving French [[farce]]. It is an [[anonymous work]].

In the play there are two scoundrels, a "blind" beggar and his servant boy. The blind beggar has a secret hoard of coins, which the boy tricks away from him. The boy deceives, robs then beats his master—the trickster has become the tricked.

It was a simple play with no props and could be performed by two actors anywhere. It probably is one of many performed by wandering [[jongleur]]s catering to the tastes and theme of market days and fairs. An important business for the actors was to collect money from spectators, and the actors beggar-man part in the play allowed for comic audience participation.

Because the deceiver is deceived, along with [[slapstick]] action, it is considered the oldest surviving farce in [[French literature]]. This means it is the oldest to survive in written form, but is part of a much older [[Oral literature|oral tradition]].

This "trickster is tricked" theme, and that of the [[cuckold]]ed husband, were the main preoccupations of the medieval farceur.  The play is in many respects identical to the first chapter of "The Life of Lazarillo de Tormes," a [[picaresque novel]] published anonymously in Spain in 1554.  The play may have served as source material for the book, or both may have emerged from a common folktale.

Also on 4 January, the director of Israel's internal security agency, the [[Shin Bet]], told the cabinet that [[Hamas]] leaders both at home and in exile felt that their organisation was facing an "existential threat" and was "willing to reach an agreement" on a ceasefire.  However, Foreign Minister [[Tzipi Livni]] said that Israel did not intend to conclude a "diplomatic product" with Hamas. Such a move had been avoided in the past out of fear of legitimising Hamas as a negotiating partner.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Hamas sources told ''The Jerusalem Post'' that members of [[al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]], the [[Popular Resistance Committees]], [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]] and the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] were participating in the fighting against the IDF, and that they were making use of U.S. and Israeli weapons confiscated from members of [[Fatah]] in the [[2007 Battle of Gaza]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1230733174237&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Hamas: We're using PA arms to battle IDF] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224113253/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1230733174237&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |date=24 February 2012 }}, ''The Jerusalem Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

Fatah officials in Ramallah told The Jerusalem Post that Hamas militiamen had been assaulting many Fatah activists since the beginning of the operation last Saturday. They said at least 75 activists were shot in the legs while others had their hands broken.

Israel continued to refuse foreign journalists' access to the Gaza Strip. The continuing ban on foreign media access drew criticism from journalists that Israel was trying to "manage" the story.

At least 12 [[Palestinians]] were killed in fresh strikes in the [[Gaza Strip]]. At least 15 rockets hit Israel, causing no casualties.&lt;ref name="reuters1"/&gt;

Following the strikes, [[Israel]] initiated a three-hour "humanitarian" truce. The [[Israeli army]] refrained from attacks from 1 to 4 pm, though there were reports of exchanges of fire between Israeli forces and Hamas during that period. During the temporary truce, 80 aid trucks were allowed to enter the Strip, some of which delivered industrial fuel to Gaza's power plant. Access was granted to previously closed regions, to allow residents access to supplies. According to Israeli sources, they planned to repeat this move daily. Fighting resumed immediately following the end of the truce.&lt;ref name="Haaretz_truce"&gt;{{cite web|title=Clashes resume in Gaza City after 3-hour humanitarian truce |url = http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1053498.html| publisher=[[Haaretz]]|date=7 January 2009|accessdate=7 January 2009|author=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Katyusha rockets from [[Lebanon]] territory were fired at the northern Israeli city of Nahariyya. Two civilians were injured. The IDF returned fire at the launch sites in southern Lebanon.

The United Nations Security Council met and passed a resolution "stressing the urgency of and calls for an immediate, durable and fully respected ceasefire, leading to the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza", and welcoming the Egyptian initiative, among other points.&lt;ref name="UN_SRES18602009"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-RES-1860(2009) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=2009 |resolution_number=1860 |accessdate=15 January 2009|date=8 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[United States]] abstained on the vote, [[Condoleezza Rice]] explained to the Council that the U.S. thought it important to see the outcomes of the Egyptian mediation efforts in order to see what the resolution might have been supporting, but that "after a great deal of consideration, we decided that the resolution -- the text of which we support, the goals of which we support and the objectives of which we fully support -- should indeed be allowed to go forward."{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The order to abstain on the resolution, which U.S. diplomats had helped to draft, reportedly came at the last minute from President Bush, following pressure from the Israeli government, who issued a statement that the resolution was "not practical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/09/gaza-us-security-council-abstention|title=White House 'behind' US volte-face on ceasefire call 9 January 2009|publisher=The Guardian | location=London | first=Julian | last=Borger | date=9 January 2009 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an unusually public rebuke, the Israeli Prime Minister boasted of how he had phoned up President Bush while Bush was in the middle of a speech, and how the incident left Rice "pretty embarrassed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/01/13/america/13olmert.php|title=Olmert says he made Rice change vote|date=13 January 2009|first=Mark|last=Landler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====9 January 2009====
The Israeli offensive continued, despite the passing of a UN Security resolution calling for an immediate and durable ceasefire.

Israel dismissed the Security Council resolution as "impractical": Ehud Olmert's office said that more Hamas rockets "only prove that the U.N.'s decision is not practical and will not be kept in practice by the Palestinian murder organizations."&lt;ref name="palestinians1"&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090110/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_israel_palestinians Israel tells Gazans to brace for war escalation - Yahoo!

Hamas objected to not being consulted during the drafting of the resolution: "Nobody consulted Hamas or talked to Hamas. Nobody put Hamas in the picture and yet Hamas is required to accept it. This is unacceptable," Mohammed Nazzal, a senior Hamas official based in Syria, told Al-Arabiya television.&lt;ref name="palestinians1"/&gt;

At least 30 rockets were fired at southern Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1054247.html|title=Gaza Rocket Hits Playground in Ashdod, Amid Barrage on Negev|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas claimed to have hit the [[Tel Nof]] airbase, some {{convert|27|km|mi}} from Tel Aviv, which, if true, would make it the farthest strike to date.&lt;ref name=Melman&gt;{{cite web|title=Hamas claims it hit IAF base 27km from Tel Aviv|author=Yossi Melman|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1054233.html|date=10 January 2009|accessdate=10 January 2009|publisher=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas also announced that Mahmoud Abbas' term as President had expired, and that while they do not expect Abbas to step down while the war continues in Gaza, they no longer recognize his legitimacy. Abbas responded that he still had another year, citing a law that says presidential and parliamentary elections should be held at the same time.&lt;ref name=UPI0109&gt;{{cite web|title=Hamas: Abbas no longer president|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/01/09/Hamas_Abbas_no_longer_president/UPI-19361231560412/|date=9 January 2009|accessdate=10 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Condoleezza Rice said that it was "difficult" to protect civilians in a place as densely populated as Gaza — an area {{convert|25|mi|km}} long and roughly six miles wide.&lt;ref name="palestinians1"/&gt; A UN report on Gaza noted that "the borders are closed, making this one of the rare conflicts where civilians have no place to flee."&lt;ref name="ocha_report_1_7"/&gt;

A three-hour truce took place on 9 January. Palestinians fired three Grad-type rockets at Ashdod, shortly after 1 pm, the truce's start-time. While supplies were being transferred through [[Kerem Shalom]] border crossing, Palestinians fired several mortar shells at the terminal. No casualties were reported.&lt;ref name=jpost_jan9_truce&gt;{{cite web|title=Mortar shells fired at Kerem Shalom|publisher=[[Jerusalem Post]]|date=9 January 2009|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1231424898375&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN said its aid workers would resume movement, having received assurances from Israel that they were not being targeted.&lt;ref name="ynetnews_UNaid_Jan9"/&gt;

At around 23:00, an Israeli [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] destroyed a [[Norwegian People's Aid]] (NPA) car that was clearly marked with the NPA logo, outside the home of an NPA employee, Mahmoud Hamada, at [[al-Shati (camp)|al-Shati refugee camp]] in northern Gaza. Nobody was injured. Surrounding buildings were severely damaged. The Secretary-General of NPA, [[Petter Eide]], said that there are no military targets in the area. Raymond Johansen of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] stated that the incident was a "clear violation of [[international law]]."&lt;ref name="maan_NorwayPA"&gt;{{cite news | pages= | title=Norwegian People's Aid car hit by missile, Foreign Ministry calls incident "clear violation of international law" | date=10 January 2009 | publisher=[[Ma'an News Agency]] | url=http://www.maannews.net/en/index.php?opr=ShowDetails&amp;ID=34840 | accessdate=11 January 2009 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5djZcDjrj?url=http://www.maannews.net/en/index.php?opr=ShowDetails&amp;ID=34840 | archivedate=11 January 2009 | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NPA1101"&gt;{{cite web| title =NPA car hit by missile in Gaza| work =| publisher =Norwegian People’s Aid| date =10 January 2009| url =http://www.npaid.org/?module=Articles;action=Article.publicShow;ID=7254| format =| doi =| accessdate =11 January 2009| archiveurl =https://www.webcitation.org/5djfRPZza?url=http://www.npaid.org/?module=Articles;action=Article.publicShow;ID=7254| archivedate =11 January 2009| deadurl =yes| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No rockets were fired into Israel overnight, a sharp drop from the dozens of projectiles that were launched in the early days of the offensive; during the morning, three rockets struck the southern city of Ashkelon, lightly wounding two people. Six additional rockets landed in open areas, with no casualties.&lt;ref name="palestinians1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haaretz_rockets_Jan10"&gt;{{cite web|title=

The Israeli military said that in Gaza it had killed more than 15 terrorists and that IDF aircraft had attacked more than 40 targets throughout Gaza striking ten rocket-launching sites, weapons-storage facilities, smuggling tunnels, an anti-aircraft missile launcher and gunmen. Although Palestinian hospital officials could confirm only four deaths they also stated that fighting has hindered paramedics from collecting bodies and treating the wounded. Palestinian medical officials said that eight people were killed by Israeli tank fire Saturday in the town of Jebailiya and the dead appeared to be civilians per paramedics on the scene.&lt;ref name="palestinians1"/&gt;

The Israeli military said it would halt the fire in Gaza for three hours on Saturday to allow the territory's besieged residents to leave their homes and stock up on supplies. Medics use the lull to rescue casualties in areas of fighting, and aid groups also rush through food distribution.&lt;ref name="palestinians1"/&gt;

The Palestinian Authority president urged both Israel and Hamas to agree to an Egypt-brokered truce Saturday, but he singled out Israel, saying it would be responsible for a "waterfall of blood" if it didn't accept the deal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090110/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_mideast_diplomacy Palestinian leader says 'aggression' must stop - Yahoo!

On 10 January the IDF stated that Hamas fighters are suffering from exhaustion. An IDF military commander said that Hamas militants are beginning to desert battle and refuse orders. Israeli military claims that Hamas younger operatives refused to venture outside to lob mortars against Israeli forces, prompting a senior Hamas leader, Amir Mansi, to operate the mortar himself. After IDF soldiers identified the source of fire, they shot and killed Mansi, wounding two others involved in the attack. Amir Mansi has been reported as an expert in the Grad rocket launching program, having been trained by Hezbollah. Also, the IDF stated that more than 300 Hamas fighters have been killed so far in the operation, the highest estimate so far, and at least 120 have been captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1054245.html|title=IDF: Hamas Men Beginning to Desert; Army Steps Up Gaza Op|work=Haaretz.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117011018/http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1054245.html|archivedate=17 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the reports, entire Hamas companies have been eliminated by the Israeli forces.

[[File:GazaWPshelling.gif|thumbnail|Phosphorus cluster bombs dropped on populated areas on 11 January]]

The [[Israeli Air Force|IAF]] attacked overnight a [[mosque]] in the town of [[Rafah]], which according to Israel was being used as a Hamas training camp, a meeting place and a weapons cache. The [[Israeli Defence Forces|IDF]] reported that the mosque contained machine-guns and [[anti-aircraft]] missiles.&lt;ref name=ynet_reportJan11&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaza Report: IDF kills 10 Palestinian gunmen |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3654019,00.html|publisher = [[YNET]]|date=11 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli and Palestinian officials report that at least 40 [[Hamas]] gunmen were killed in a battle with [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] soldiers in the Gaza City neighborhood of [[Sheikh Ajalin]].

Two rockets landed in the city of Beersheba, a half an hour before the city's high schools were to reopen after being closed for more than 10 days. Some 65% of Beersheba's 11 and 12th graders (about 2.700 students) were to return to school and study in bomb shelters.&lt;ref name=ynet_reportJan11_rockets&gt;{{cite news|title=Rockets hit Beersheba as youths head to school |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3653936,00.html |publisher = [[YNET]]|date=11 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two terrorists and a woman were killed by Israeli strikes in the southern Gaza Strip. Dozens were injured in attacks near the village of Khouza to the east of Khan Younis. Palestinian medics in the area said that the injured suffered from burns and gas inhalations, symptoms indicating exposure to white phosphorus. Israel rejected the claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaza hit by new Israeli strikes|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7822623.stm|date=11 January 2009 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been rumors circulating in the Egyptian media that IAF strikes have wounded the captive Israeli soldier [[Gilad Shalit]]. A spokesman of Hamas politburo, [[Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook|Moussa Abu Marzuk]], said that Shalit's condition is no longer a concern for Hamas. An Israeli Defense Ministry official dismissed the comments as "psychological warfare".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1054469.html Report: Hamas official says Shalit's fate is no longer group's concern - Haaretz - Israel News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Vice Premier [[Haim Ramon]] in an interview with Army Radio added that Hamas is using Shalit as a "bargaining chip" hoping for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the captured soldier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1050915.html|title=Report: Captive IDF Soldier Shalit Wounded in Gaza Air Strikes|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 January, the IDF started to deploy thousands of reservists into the Gaza Strip for the first time since Israeli offensive against Hamas begun 16 days ago. The Israeli government announced that it had approved tens of thousands of call-ups of its reserve forces before the ground operation started on 3 January. The troops have been refreshing on their urban training since then, and the bulk of the fighting has been done by [[Golani Brigade|Golani]] and [[Givati Brigade|Givati]] brigades. Analysts comment that this suggests Israel is intensifying its military efforts against Hamas.&lt;ref name="fjparticle2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1054531.html|title=IDF Begins Deploying Reservists Into Gaza as Part of Ground Op|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Israeli patrol came under fire on the Syrian border on Sunday. The soldiers did not return fire and no casualties were reported, although the vehicle they were traveling in sustained damage. The IDF assessed that the [[Military of Syria|Syrian army]] was not involved, believing it was Palestinians protesting the Gaza operation. It was the second cross-border attack in three days after three [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]] rockets were fired into northern Israel on 8 January from Lebanon. Israel filed a complaint to the [[United Nations Disengagement Observer Force Zone|UNDOF]] in [[Syria]] which sent a team to investigate the reports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1231424924849&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Gunshots fired from Syria at Golan | Israel | Jerusalem Post&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://cnnwire.blogs.cnn.com/2009/01/11/un-investigates-gunfire-at-israel-syria-border/ | work=CNN | title=U.N. investigates gunfire at Israel-Syria border | accessdate=25 May 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] attached to the explosives extended to a [[Gaza Zoo|zoo]] located dozens of yards away. The soldiers managed to neutralize the bomb before it went off.

In the afternoon, during the "humanitarian corridor" - a time in which the Israeli army holds it fire and allows civilians in Gaza to receive aid - [[Hamas]] terrorists fired several rocket barrages. A rocket fired from the northern Gaza Strip hit a wall surrounding a kindergarten in [[Ashdod]]. There were no reports of damage or injury, but a few people were treated for shock. Other rockets were fired at [[Ashkelon]], [[Sderot]], [[Kiryat Malachi]], and [[Eshkol Regional Council]].&lt;ref name  = ynet_rockets_humanitarian&gt;{{cite web|title=Rocket lands near Ashdod kindergarten; no injuries| publisher= [[YNET]] |date=11 January 2009|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3654153,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January, four Israeli paratroopers were wounded in northern Gaza. A unit of Israeli paratroopers also discovered a Hamas tunnel, and shot and killed a female would-be suicide bomber. Israeli ground troops and aircraft targeted over 25 Hamas sites, including tunnels and weapons caches, killing four Hamas fighters and five civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Reuters]] - ''Israeli forces squeeze Gaza''&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli forces continued their advance, with reports of fierce fighting around Gaza City.

The [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] reported on 12 January that four soldiers were wounded, one seriously. The troops were part of a [[paratrooper]] unit that was operating in northern Gaza.

The Israeli army refuted these claims.{{cn|date=September 2018}}
Another paratrooper unit discovered and eventually destroyed a [[tunnel]] in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] that, according to the IDF, was meant to transfer [[suicide bomber]]s into Israel. The tunnel was found some 300 meters from the fence on the border with Israel. It was also reported that the soldiers shot and killed a female would-be suicide bomber.&lt;ref name="haaretz1"/&gt; During the day the military, backed by the IAF, targeted over 25 sites on Monday, including tunnels and weapon caches, killing 9 Palestinians, five of whom, according to Palestinian officials, were civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE5053R720090113 | work=Reuters | title=Israeli forces squeeze Gaza | date=13 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US President [[George W. Bush]] threw his support behind Israel once more on 12 January. The President was quoted with saying that he believes a sustainable [[ceasefire]] will only be achieved if [[Hamas]] stops firing [[Qassam rocket|rockets]] at Israel and that it is solely Hamas' choice to make. He reiterated Israel's right to defend herself but hoped she  "continued to be mindful of the innocent folk" and help with humanitarian aid transfer into Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE5053R720090113?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=10112 | work=Reuters | title=Israeli forces squeeze Gaza | date=13 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, it was reported that Hamas raided over 100 trucks with humanitarian aid meant for civilians and sold it to the highest bidder. Israeli forces stopped several attempts to smuggle prohibited goods into Israel, namely electronics, since Defense Minister [[Ehud Barak]] said they do not classify as humanitarian aid. Israel still allows certain repair items to flow into Gaza to repair the damaged electric grid.&lt;ref name="fjparticle3"&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1231424932109&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Hamas raids aid trucks, sells supplies | Confronting Hamas | Jerusalem Post&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001164132/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&amp;cid=1231424932109 |date=1 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel is considering establishing a [[field hospital]] outside of the Gaza Strip to facilitate medical aid for Palestinians civilians wounded in the conflict between Israel and Hamas. Under the plan, Israel is also considering bringing the facility inside the Palestinian territory to make it more accessible for the Palestinians seeking treatment. The hospital would be run by the IDF Medical Corps. Throughout the conflict, IDF has allowed the passage of over 900 trucks and facilitated with the transfer of over 20,000 tons of basic food and supplies.&lt;ref name="fjparticle3"/&gt;

As the Palestinian death toll exceeded 900, in a statement the IDF said it believes 400 of those are known Hamas fighters, adding that a "significant number are also Hamas operatives" in the remaining 500 dead.&lt;ref name="fjparticle3"/&gt;

More than 50 air strikes were carried out in Gaza overnight, ahead of the expected vote by Israel's cabinet on a proposal for a ceasefire. Heavy explosions echoed south of Gaza City.

United Nations officials say two children, aged five and seven, were killed when Israeli tank fire hit a UN school where hundreds had taken shelter in the northern town of Beit Lahiya. A UN spokesman, Chris Gunness, said an investigation ought to be held "to determine whether a war crime has been committed". Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor rejected the call, saying: "There's not the slightest piece of evidence to support such allegations."&lt;ref name="middle1"/&gt;

====18 January 2009====
Israel implemented a unilateral cease-fire early Sunday and in announcing the cease-fire late Saturday, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said Israel had achieved its goals and more,  stating that "Hamas was hit hard, in its military arms and in its government institutions. Its leaders are in hiding and many of its men have been killed." According to Olmert's statement, the cease-fire went into effect at 2 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) with the IDF warning that attacks on soldiers or civilians "will be met with a harsh response." If Hamas holds its fire, the military "will weigh pulling out of Gaza at a time that befits us," Olmert said. If not, Israel "will continue to act to defend our residents."&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090118/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_israel_palestinians Israel pulling out of Gaza; Hamas ceases fire - Yahoo!

The first death after the cease-fire was a Palestinian farmer who was shot dead by Israeli soldier while checking his farm in [[Khan Younis]], on 18 January morning. The Israeli army said they shot the farmer because he was approaching land occupied at that moment by Israeli ground troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-01/18/content_10678349.htm|title=First Palestinian shot dead after Israel's unilateral ceasefire_English_Xinhua|publisher=|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''True History: An Account of Cannibal Captivity in Brazil''''' (German: ''Warhaftige Historia und beschreibung eyner Landtschafft der Wilden Nacketen, Grimmigen Menschfresser-Leuthen in der Newenwelt America gelegen)'' is an account published by the [[Germany|German]] soldier [[Hans Staden]] in 1557 describing his two trips to the new world.  The book is best known for Staden's descriptions of his experiences while held captive by the [[Tupinambá people|Tupinambá]] near [[Curitiba]], [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitehead|first=Neil L.|date=2000|title=Hans Staden and the Cultural Politics of Cannibalism|url=|journal=Hispanic American Historical Review|volume=80|pages=721–751|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''True History'' became one of the best-selling travel narratives of the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Germany and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History|last=Häberlein|first=M.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2005|isbn=|editor-last=Adam|editor-first=Thomas|location=Santa Barbara|pages=|chapter=Hans Staden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hans Staden arrived in Brazil as a gunner for the Portuguese in 1550 and was taken as a prisoner of war by the [[Tupinambá people|Tupinamabá]] people of Brazil. The Tupinamabá had a reputation of performing cannibalistic rituals, especially with prisoners of war. Since the Tupinamabá were French allies and the French and Portuguese were enemies, the account was a dramatic first person account from a Portuguese view of the Natives.

== Synopsis ==
''True History: An Account of Cannibal Captivity in Brazil'' shares various observations Hans Staden, a German explorer, had on a tribal group in Brazil called Tupinambá. This travel log consists of two introductions, list of illustrations, and two parts, with fifty-three and thirty-six chapters. Throughout the book, Staden utilizes his illustrations to visually depict his observations. Furthermore, Staden introduces cannibalism as a cultural and religious practice to his readers alongside with his survival journey. Overall, he shares his personal views on the indigenous culture, tradition, and lifestyle from the perspective of a European captive.

Staden’s experience begins with being captured by two Tupinambá males—Jeppipo Wasu and Alkindar Miri—and brought to a small village called Uwattibi [Ubatuba].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hans Staden’s True History: An Account of Cannibal Captivity in Brazil|last=Staden|first=Hans|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; His initial response in encountering the indigenous people showed fear because they desired to eat his flesh. Religious rituals such as singing, dancing, and worshiping that insinuated cannibalistic intentions aggravated Staden’s emotional stress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ipperu Wasu, who held Staden as a captive, bestowed Staden to Alkindar Miri in return of a favor. Staden believed his death would involve barbaric methods; however, he underwent a series of rites. The Tupinambá people decorated Staden with strings and rings, and further continued to dance as a form of ritual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Tupinambá distrusted the Portuguese, rather favored the French who established a diplomatic relation through trades. Unfortunately, the Tupinambá people categorized Staden as a Portuguese, which definitively put him an inevitable situation of death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreover, the two natives who captured Staden harbored hostility against the Portuguese who slain their father. Their vengefulness intensified Staden’s fate. Despite Staden’s attempt to convince the Tupinambá by lying about his nationality as French, a Frenchman disproved Staden’s words.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Staden believed the Frenchman would support him based on their mutual religious background. Instead, the Frenchman advocated the Tupinambá and departed as soon as he had his load ready.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After being imprisoned for several days, the Tupinambá transported Staden to another village called Arirab [Ariro] where he met their highest king, Konyan Bebe. During his temporary visit, Staden continued to persuade the king that he is not an enemy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He flattered the king by noting his fierce and belligerent personality, which the king regardlessly proceeded on questioning Staden’s nationality as well as sharing personal stories of how he slain the Portuguese.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After being interrogated, the Tupinambá brought Staden back to Uwattibi. Staden expected his death on the arrival.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the Tupiniquins attacked the village during which Staden volunteered to assist the Tupinambá in the combat. Despite his demonstration, Staden was placed under surveillance again.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Part II, Staden shares his observations on the Tupinambá nature, culture, and lifestyle. His overall perception of South America emphasized the rich forest and mountains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He describes the indigenous people as savages who are naked, dark skinned, dexterous, and have facial paintings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For residential environment, he argues that the dwellings were architecturally well protected from enemies with resources such as food and wood located in close proximity within their huts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Staden notes the technology devised by the indigenous people. He suggests the natives create fire through using friction that later plays a crucial role in manufacturing cooking utensils such as pots.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In regions with no European presence, the natives utilize animal tools to cut and hew, as they are unaware of axes, knives, and scissors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similarly, European influence exists partially across the indigenous population. For example, Staden mentions few tribal groups that participated in trades with the Europeans consume salts, whereas those who did not eat no salt.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, Staden mentions boiling as an essential part in the culinary culture among the natives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, the indigenous hunting techniques that involve using tools such as bows, arrows, and nets serve as a huge contributor to the food supply.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Staden states “It seldom happens that a man returns empty-handed from hunting.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreover, although Staden notes the indigenous communities “do not have any particular form of government or law,”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; he takes account of chiefs as an integral political figure who tend to show competency in waging wars. Staden, therefore, argues social hierarchy exists in the indigenous societies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==
Hans Staden was a German traveler born around 1520 in [[Hesse]], a principality of what was then known as the “Holy Roman Empire.” Throughout his education, he studied in several towns throughout Hesse and even served as a soldier. It came as a surprise to all when in 1547, Staden declared that he would be leaving Hesse for India. He soon found himself in Latin America. While it could be argued that his immigration to several towns throughout Hesse led to his life of exploration, it is not clear what prompted him to leave Hesse.

Throughout his endeavors as a traveler, Staden was known as a “[[go-between]],” a mediator of sorts between the Europeans and the Indigenous tribes. In addition to mediation, he also acted as a broker and translator for the Europeans. He was a mediator in multiple aspects, including social, economic and trade. However, like any other “go-between,” he did not take sides.

It was because of Staden’s capture by the Tupinambá that he became a “go-between.” There are a couple main reasons for this. Unlike the many others of the time who were captured by indigenous tribes, pirates, and fugitive slaves, he contained abundant knowledge of the land, geography and people. The second main reason is that during his time as a captive, he made a conscious effort to learn the Tupinambá’s language, beliefs and customs.

Once Staden gained this abundant knowledge of Tupinambá, they became pawns in his game. He began to deceive them. He achieved this in multiple ways. He claimed that the tribe’s oracles and gourds, known as “Tamaraka,” were lying about him. He changed his self-image, in order to make his capturers fear him. In addition to working against them, he also made offers to be their healer, mercenary and even prophet. Due to his refusal to choose a side, it would seem unclear whether or not his manipulation of the Tupinambá helped or hurt his chances of being set free.

In 1552, after being released by Charles V, Staden returned home to Hesse, where he remained until his death in 1579. Allegedly, in 1556, he had even spoken to prince Landgrave Phillip about his book True History. It would come as another surprise when he classified his book as an adventure story and described the story as being much more leisurely than the actual events themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, Eve M., and Alida C. Metcalf. The return of Hans Staden: a go-between in the Atlantic world. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The reception of Hans Staden’s narrative has been relatively positive. His book was a great success in 16th century Europe and was one of the most popular travel narratives of its time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://0-search-credoreference-com.dewey2.library.denison.edu/content/entry/abcgeamrle/staden_hans/0|title=Germany and the Americas: culture, politics and history|last1=Häberlein|first1=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics agree that Staden’s novel is a fantastic source to learn about indigenous cultures and is quite incomparable to other sources about the same subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brotherston|first1=Gordon|date=December 2009|title=Reviewed Work(s): Hans Staden's True History: An Account of Cannibal Captivity in Brazil by Hans Staden, Neil L.

== Historical Context ==
During Staden's Adventures, a confrontation was at hand between the French, Spanish, and Portuguese whose naval power was unmatched at the time.  They contended for resources, and control of global trading, which often resulted in violence.&lt;ref name="Millennium Web Catalog"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://0-www.jstor.org.dewey2.library.denison.edu/stable/pdf/27867848.pdf?refreqid=excelsior:0b9f7c8b42ee34015dcbbe7018de0fd6|title=Millennium Web Catalog|website=0-www.jstor.org.dewey2.library.denison.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Brazil's position as a top priority resource, it became a very violent place.  Native tribes were forced to form alliances with western powers to survive.  One tribe, known as the Tupiniquin, allied with the Portuguese, another called the Tupinamba allied with the French.&lt;ref name="Millennium Web Catalog"/&gt;  As a mercenary, Staden fought for both Portugal and France, but eventually ended up part of a Garrison in a Portuguese settlement, which is why he was captured by the Tupinamba.  Additionally, Staden's experiences was one of the first reported cases of cannibalism by a European, and caused turmoil in the world of Anthropology, which previously disputed the very existence of Cannibalism.&lt;ref name="Millennium Web Catalog"/&gt;

The '''Yehud coinage''' is a series of small silver coins bearing the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] inscription ''Yehud''.&lt;ref name="google225"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xrYEWKLTmfsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Zadoks+heirs:+the+role+and+development+of+the+High+Priesthood+in+ancient+Israel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ycSfXluYXr&amp;sig=vASja0HsYRM9u7xMUZnVNPvMEpA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fkieTbPILoXuuAPvwZm_BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Rooke, Deborah W., "Zadok's heirs: the role and development of the High Priesthood in ancient Israel" (Oxford, 2000) p.225]&lt;/ref&gt; They derive their name from the inscription YHD (𐤉‬𐤄𐡃‬) , "Yehud", the Aramaic name of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] Persian province of [[Yehud Medinata|Yehud]]; others are inscribed YHDH, the same name in Hebrew.

==Types of coinage==
The YHD coins are believed to date from the Persian period. On the other hand, it is possible that the YHDH coins are from the following [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] period.&lt;ref name="google225"/&gt;

Mildenburg dates Yehud coins from the early 4th century BCE to the reign of [[Ptolemy I]] (312–285 BCE), while [[Ya'akov Meshorer|Meshorer]] believes there was a gap during Ptolemy I's time and that minting resumed during [[Ptolemy II]] and continued into [[Ptolemy III]], although this has been questioned.&lt;ref name="google225"/&gt; The earlier coins were almost certainly produced in imitation of [[Economy of ancient Greece#Currency|Athenian coins]], and were used locally as small change to supplement the larger denominations from more centralised mints elsewhere in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xrYEWKLTmfsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Zadoks+heirs:+the+role+and+development+of+the+High+Priesthood+in+ancient+Israel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ycSfXluYXr&amp;sig=vASja0HsYRM9u7xMUZnVNPvMEpA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fkieTbPILoXuuAPvwZm_BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Rooke, Deborah W., "Zadok's heirs: the role and development of the High Priesthood in ancient Israel" (Oxford, 2000) pp. 225–6]&lt;/ref&gt;

A lot of these coins were probably minted in Jerusalem.

==The use of figural art==
Unlike later Jewish coinage, Yehud coins depict living creatures, flowers and even human beings. 

During the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]] period figural art was frequently used, such as the [[cherub]]im over the [[Ark of the Covenant]], the twelve oxen that supported the giant [[Molten Sea|laver]] in front of [[Solomon]]'s Temple, etc. Thus, it is likely that the Yehud coins are continuing the use of figural art from the previous period. The prohibition against graven images in Exodus was probably seen as relating only to [[idolatry|idolatrous]] images rather than the purely decorative.

Depictions on the coinage include imagery borrowed from other cultures, such as the Athenian Owl, and various [[mythology|mythological]] creatures.
The lily flower was also commonly portrayed.

Various human images are also portrayed. Some coins bear images of Persian rulers. The identity of other human images are not always clear; some of them may even be images of Jewish leaders, such as Temple priests.&lt;ref&gt;Lee I. Levine, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kkHfmXyUjXEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Jerusalem: Portrait of the City in the Second Temple Period (538 B.C.E. – 70 C.E.)''.] Jewish Publication Society, 2002 {{ISBN|0827607504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One coin depicts an enthroned deity, claimed by some experts to be [[Yahu|Yahweh]], while this is disputed by others.&lt;ref&gt;Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible
by [[David Noel Freedman]], Allen C. Myers, Astrid B. Beck Published by Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000 {{ISBN|0-8028-2400-5}}, pg 914&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested recently that this coin was actually minted in [[Samaria]] and depicts Samarian Yahweh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ms.limsoup.net/Shenkar,%20The%20Coin%20of%20the%20%27God%20on%20a%20Winged%20Wheel%27.pdf Shenkar, M. “The Coin of the ‘God on the Winged Wheel’”,  ''BOREAS. Münstersche Beiträge zur Archäologie 30/31'', 2009, pp. 13–23]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coin features==
The coins from the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] period tend to be inscribed in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] "square script" or [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Paleo-Hebrew]] and use the Aramaic spelling of the province as 'y-h-d', while those coins from the [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]]/[[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] period (or maybe earlier) are inscribed in the Paleo-Hebrew script and usually spell Judea as 'y-h-d', 'y-h-d-h' or 'y-h-w-d-h'.&lt;ref&gt;The Emergence of Yehud in the Persian Period: A Social and Demographic Study by Charles E. Carter Published by Continuum International Publishing Group, 1999
{{ISBN|1-84127-012-1}}, pg269&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent study by Yehoshua Zlotnik attempts to relate different kinds of coins, and the specifics of their manufacture to the changing political situation in Judea in the 4th century BCE. He deals with different coins-types, and with such unusual phenomena as minting on only one side of the coin, and seemingly deliberate flaws on certain dies. According to Zlotnik, these and other features can clarify the political state of affairs in Judah -- such as independence, autonomy, or transition period.&lt;ref&gt;Yehoshua Zlotnik (2009), [https://www.academia.edu/620281/Coin_minting_in_Eretz_Israel_during_the_Persian_period-does_it_reflect_various_political_situation ''Coin minting in Eretz Israel during the Persian period – does it reflect various political situations?''] The Open University of Israel, Department of History, Philosophy and Judaic Studies&lt;/ref&gt; Zlotnik also does a comparison of Yehud coins with contemporary coins from various neighbouring mints, such as Samaria, Edom and Sidon.

Mildenberg divides most of the Persian period 'Yehud' coinage into three groups: an early group of poorly defined coins with the head of [[Athena]] on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] with her owl on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] with the inscription 'y-h-d' in [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Paleo-Hebrew]]; the second group are more clearly defined and depict a lily, and an [[Egypt]]ian [[falcon]] (see pictures), and the head of the Persian king, with the inscription 'y-h-d'; the third group has the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] inscription 'Hezekiah the governor' (yhzqyh hphh). All these coins have been found in the area of Judea.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Jews and Judaism in the Second Temple Period: Yehud, the Persian Province of Judah by Lester L. Grabbe Published by Continuum International Publishing Group, 2004 {{ISBN|0-567-08998-3}}, pg 65&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yehud coins come in two denominations, approximately .58&amp;nbsp;gram as a ''[[Gerah|ma'ah]]'' and approximately .29&amp;nbsp;gram as a half ''ma'ah'' (''[[chatzi ma'ah]]''). These coins might have been minted in the first 40 years of the [[Second Temple]] era. For larger coinage, they first used [[Achaemenid coinage|Persian coinage]], the [[Persian daric]] and the [[Achaemenid coinage|Sigloi]]; then Greek ([[Alexandrian Empire]]) coins like the [[drachma]] and the [[tetradrachm]].
