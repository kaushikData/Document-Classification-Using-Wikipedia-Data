'''Argutite''' ([[germanium|Ge]][[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a rare [[germanium]] [[oxide mineral]]. It is a member of the [[rutile]] group.

It was first described for an occurrence in the Argut deposit, central [[Pyrenees]], [[Haute-Garonne]], [[France]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt; The [[Type locality (geology)|type locality]] is within a zinc ore deposit within  lower [[Paleozoic]] [[sedimentary rock]]s that have undergone [[metamorphism]]. Associated minerals include [[sphalerite]], [[cassiterite]], [[siderite]] and [[briartite]].&lt;ref name=HBM/&gt;

'''Chemotropism'' is growth of organisms such as [[bacteria]] and [[plant]]s, navigated by chemical [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] from outside of the organism or organism's part. 
The response of the organism or organism part is termed ‘positive’ if the growth is towards the stimulus, or ‘negative’ if the growth is away from the stimulus.

==Chemotropism in plants==
[[File:PSM V77 D352 The course of the pollen tube in a rock rose.png|thumb|PSM V77 D352 The course of the pollen tube in a rock rose]]

An example of chemo-tropic movement can be seen during the growth of the [[pollen tube]], where growth is always towards the ovules. It can be also written that conversion of flower into fruit is an example of chemotropism.

[[Fertilization]] of flowers by pollen is achieved because the [[Ovary (plants)|ovary]] releases chemicals that produce a positive chemo-tropic response from the developing pollen tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reger|first1=BJ|last2=Chaubal|first2=R|last3=Pressey|first3=R|title=Chemo-tropic responses by pearl millet pollen tubes|journal=Sexual plant reproduction|date=1992|volume=5|issue=1|pages=47–56|doi=10.1007/BF00714557|url=https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/download/15080/PDF|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of positive and negative chemotropism is shown by a plant’s roots; the roots grow towards useful [[minerals]] displaying positive chemotropism, and grow away from harmful [[acids]] displaying negative chemotropism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henke|first1=Michael|last2=Sarlikioti|first2=Vaia|title=Exploring root developmental plasticity to nitrogen with a three-dimensional architectural model.|journal=Plant Soil|date=3 August 2014|volume=385|pages=49–62|doi=10.1007/s11104-014-2221-7|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11104-014-2221-7|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newcombe|first1=Frederick C.|last2=Rhodes|first2=Anna L. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Chemotropism of Roots|journal=Botanical Gazette|date=1904|volume=37|issue=1|pages=22–35|jstor=2465652|doi=10.1086/328441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemotropism in animals==

[[File:Developmental-axon-stretch-stimulates-neuron-growth-while-maintaining-normal-electrical-activity-Video4.ogv|thumb|]]

Another example of chemotropic movement includes the growth of individual neuronal cell [[axons]] in response to extracellular signals. These signals guide the developing axon to [[innervate]] the correct target tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tessier-Lavigne,  Placzek,  Lumsden,  Dodd,  Jessell|title=Chemotropic guidance of developing axons in the mammalian central nervous system|journal=Nature|volume=336|issue=6201|pages=775–8|pmid=3205306|year=1988|doi=10.1038/336775a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neuronal growth cones are guided by gradients of chemoattractant molecules emanating from their intermediate or final targets. There is evidence that the axons of peripheral neurons are guided by chemotropism and the directed growth of some central axons is also a chemo-tropic response, it remains to be determined whether chemotropism also operates in the central nervous system. Evidence of chemotropism has also been noted in neuronal regeneration, where chemotropic substances guide the ganglionic neurites towards the degenerated neuronal stump.&lt;ref name="pmid7649810"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gu X, Thomas PK, King RH | title = Chemotropism in nerve regeneration studied in tissue culture | journal = Journal of Anatomy | volume = 186 | issue = 1| pages = 153–63 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7649810 | pmc = 1167281 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other examples of Chemotropism==

The addition of atmospheric nitrogen, also called nitrogen fixation, is an example of chemotropism.

Chemotropism is different from [[Chemotaxis]], the major difference being that chemotropism is related to growth, while chemotaxis is related to locomotion.

'''DIII-D''' is a [[tokamak]] that has been operated since the late 1980s by [[General Atomics]] (GA) in [[San Diego]], USA, for the U.S. Department of Energy. The DIII-D National Fusion Facility is part of the ongoing effort to achieve [[magnetic confinement fusion|magnetically confined fusion]]. The mission of the DIII-D Research Program is to establish the scientific basis for the optimization of the [[tokamak]] approach to fusion energy production.&lt;ref&gt;DIII-D {{cite web |url=https://fusion.gat.com/global/diii-d/home |title=DIII-D |accessdate= Feb 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DIII-D was built on the basis of the earlier Doublet III, the third in a series of machines built at GA to experiment with tokamaks having non-circular plasma cross sections. This work demonstrated that certain shapes strongly suppressed a variety of instabilities in the plasma, which led to much higher plasma pressure and performance. DIII-D is so-named because the plasma is shaped like the letter D, a shaping that is now widely used on modern designs, and has led to the class of machines known as "advanced tokamaks." Advanced tokamaks are characterized by operation at high [[Beta (plasma physics)|plasma β]] through strong [[plasma shaping]], active control of various plasma instabilities, and achievement of steady-state current and pressure profiles that produce high energy confinement for high fusion gain (ratio of fusion power to heating power).

DIII-D is one of two large magnetic fusion experiments in the U.S. (the other being [[National Spherical Torus Experiment|NSTX-U]] at [[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory|PPPL]]) supported by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.  The program is focusing on R&amp;D for pursuing steady-state advanced tokamak operation and supporting design and operation of the [[ITER]] experiment now under construction in France. ITER is designed to demonstrate a self-sustained burning plasma that will produce 10 times as much energy from fusion reactions as it requires for heating.

==DIII-D Research Program==
The DIII-D research program is a large international collaboration, with over 600 users participating from more than 100 institutions. [[General Atomics]] operates the [[San Diego]]-based facility for the [[United States Department of Energy]] through the Office of Fusion Energy Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;General Atomics - Magnetic Fusion Energy. {{cite web|url=http://www.ga.com/magnetic-fusion |title=ga.com |accessdate= Feb 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in DIII-D aims to elucidate the basic physics processes that govern the behavior of a hot magnetized plasma, and to establish a scientific basis for future burning plasma devices such as ITER. Ultimately, the goal is to use this understanding to develop an economically attractive a fusion power plant.

The tokamak consists of a toroidal vacuum chamber surrounded by magnetic field coils which contain and shape the plasma. The plasma is created by applying a voltage to generate a large electrical current (more than one million amperes) in the chamber. The plasma is heated to temperatures ten times hotter than that of the sun by a combination of high-power neutral beams and microwaves. The plasma conditions are measured using instrumentation based on intense lasers, microwaves, and other precision plasma diagnostics.

==History==
[[Image:HD.6D.746 (13471451483).jpg|thumb|Schematic of Doublet II]]
In May 1974, AEC selected General Atomics to build the Doublet III magnetic fusion experiment based on the success of earlier Doublet I and II magnetic confinement experiments. In Feb 1978, the Doublet III fusion experiment achieved its first operation with plasma at General Atomics. The machine was later upgraded and renamed DIII-D in 1986.  
&lt;ref&gt;General Atomics History. May 1974 and Feb 1978.{{cite web|url=http://www.ga.com/history | title=ga.com |accessdate= Feb 17, 2018}} url=http://www.ga.com/Websites/ga/images/about/history/1974-may.jpg, url=http://www.ga.com/Websites/ga/images/about/history/1978-february.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

The DIII-D program achieved several milestones in fusion development, including the highest [[Beta (plasma physics)|plasma β]] (ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure) ever achieved at the time (early 1980s) and the highest neutron flux (fusion rate) ever achieved at the time (early 1990s).

A '''diesel locomotive''' is a type of [[railway]] [[locomotive]] in which the [[prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]] is a [[diesel engine]]. Several types of diesel locomotive have been developed, differing mainly in the means by which mechanical power is conveyed to the [[driving wheel]]s.

Early [[internal combustion engine|internal combusition]] locomotives and railcars used [[kerosene]] and [[gasoline]] as their fuel. Dr. [[Rudolf Diesel]] patented his first [[Diesel engine|compression ignition engine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |inventor=Rudolf Diesel |country=U.S. |number=608,845 |fdate=15 July 1895 |issue-date=9 August 1898 |url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT608845&amp;id=vQVgAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=608845 |title=Internal-combustion engine}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1898, and steady improvements in the design of diesel engines reduced their physical size and improved their power-to-weight ratio to a point where one could be mounted in a locomotive. Internal combustion engines only operate efficiently within a limited [[torque]] range, and while low power gasoline engines can be coupled to a mechanical [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], the more powerful diesel engines required the development of new forms of transmission.

The first successful diesel engines used [[diesel–electric transmission]]s, and by 1925 a small number of diesel locomotives of {{convert|600|hp|kW|abbr=on}} were in service in the United States. In 1930, Armstrong Whitworth of the United Kingdom delivered two {{convert|1200|hp|kW|abbr=on}} locomotives using [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer]]-designed engines to [[Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway]] of Argentina. In 1933, diesel-electric technology developed by [[Maybach]] was used propel the [[DRG Class SVT 877]], a high speed intercity two-car set, and went into series production with other streamlined car sets in Germany starting in 1935. In the USA, diesel-electric propulsion was brought to high speed mainline passenger service in late 1934, largely through the research and development efforts of [[General Motors]] from 1930&amp;ndash;34 and advances in lightweight carbody design by the [[Budd Company]].

The economic recovery from the [[Second World War]] saw the widespread adoption of diesel locomotives in many countries. They offered greater flexibility and performance than [[steam locomotive]]s, as well as substantially lower operating and maintenance costs. Diesel–hydraulic transmissions were intrdouced in the 1950s, but from the 1970s onwards diesel–electric transmission has dominated.{{cn|date=September 2018}}


==History==

===Adaptation of the diesel engine for rail use===
[[File:Priestmann Oil Engine - Fig 150 p461 The Steam engine and gas and oil engines John Perry.PNG|thumb|Diagram of Priestman Oil Engine from ''The Steam engine and gas and oil engines'' (1900) by John Perry]]
[[File:Acsev56.jpg|thumb|Petrol-electric [[Weitzer railmotor]], first 1903, series 1906]]

The earliest recorded example of the use of an internal combustion engine in a railway locomotive is the prototype designed by [[William Dent Priestman]], which was examined by [[Sir William Thomson]] in 1888 who described it as a ''"[Priestman oil engine] mounted upon a truck which is worked on a temporary line of rails to show the adaptation of a petroleum engine for locomotive purposes."''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|magazine= The Engineer| date = 24 April 1956| page = 254| title = Motive power for British Railways|url = http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/images/5/56/Er19560824.pdf| volume =202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = |journal = The Electrical Review| volume =22|page = 474| date= 4 May 1888|quote = ''A small double cylinder engine has been mounted upon a truck, which is worked on a temporary line of rails, in order to show the adaptation of a petroleum engine for locomotive purposes, on tramways''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, a {{convert|20|hp|kW|abbr=on}} two axle machine built by [[Priestman Brothers]] was used on the [[Hull Docks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal = Diesel Railway Traction|volume = 17|year= 1963 |page=25| quote=''In one sense a dock authority was the earliest user of an oil-engined locomotive, for it was at the Hull docks of the North Eastern Railway that the Priestman locomotive put in its short period of service in 1894''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=| title = railway Locomotives| page  =42| first  =John R.|last = Day| first2= Basil Knowlman|last2 = Cooper| year  =1960|quote=''The diesel has quite a long history, and the first one ran as far back as 1894. This was a tiny 30-h.p. two-axle standard-gauge locomotive with a two- cylinder engine designed by William Dent Priestman''| publisher= Frederick Muller}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896 an oil-engined railway locomotive was built for the [[Royal Arsenal]], [[Woolwich]], [[England]], in 1896, using an engine designed by [[Herbert Akroyd Stuart]].&lt;ref name="BICL"&gt;{{cite book |title=The British Internal Combustion Locomotive 1894-1940 |author=Webb, Brian |publisher=David &amp; Charles |year=1973 |isbn=978-0715361153}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not, strictly, a diesel because it used a [[hot bulb engine]] (also known as a semi-diesel) but it was the precursor of the diesel.

Following the expiration of Dr. Rudolf Diesel's patent in 1912, his engine design was successfully applied to marine propulsion and stationary applications.  However, the massiveness and poor power-to-weight ratio of these early engines made them unsuitable for propelling land-based vehicles.  Therefore, the engine's potential as a railroad [[prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]] was not initially recognized.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=15}} This changed as development reduced the size and weight of the engine.

In 1906, Rudolf Diesel, [[Adolf Klose]] and the steam and diesel engine manufacturer Gebrüder Sulzer founded Diesel-Sulzer-Klose GmbH to manufacture diesel-powered locomotives. Sulzer had been manufacturing Diesel engines since 1898. The Prussian State Railways ordered  a diesel locomotive from the company in 1909, and after test runs between Winterthur and Romanshorn the diesel–mechanical locomotive was delivered in Berlin in September 1912. The world's first diesel-powered locomotive was operated in the summer of 1912 on the [[Winterthur–Romanshorn railroad]] in Switzerland, but was not a commercial success.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=12}} During further test runs in 1913 several problems were found. After the First World War broke out in 1914, all further trials were stopped. The locomotive weight was 95 tonnes and the power was 883&amp;nbsp;kW with a maximum speed of 100&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Glatte | first = Wolfgang | title = Deutsches Lok-Archiv: Diesellokomotiven 4.

===Early diesel locomotives and railcars in US===

====Early American developments====
[[Adolphus Busch]] purchased the American manufacturing rights for the diesel engine in 1898 but never applied this new form of power to transportation. He founded the [[Busch-Sulzer]] company in 1911.
Only limited success was achieved in the early twentieth century with internal combustion engined railcars, owing in part to difficulties with mechanical drive systems.&lt;ref name="Stover 212"&gt;{{cite book | last = Stover | first = John F. | title = American Railroads| publisher = The [[University of Chicago Press]]| year =1997| location =[[Chicago, Illinois]]| page =212  | isbn =978-0-226-77658-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[General Electric]] (GE) entered the [[railcar]] market in the early twentieth century, as [[Thomas Edison]] possessed a patent on the electric locomotive, his design actually being a type of electrically propelled railcar.&lt;ref&gt;Edison, Thomas A. U.S. Patent No. 493,425, filed January 19, 1891, and issued March 14, 1891 ''Accessed via the Edison Papers at: [http://edison.rutgers.edu/patents/00493425.PDF US Patent #493,425] on February 8, 2007.''&lt;/ref&gt;  GE built its first electric locomotive prototype in 1895.  However, high electrification costs caused GE to turn its attention to internal combustion power to provide electricity for electric railcars. Problems related to co-coordinating the prime mover and [[traction motor|electric motor]] were immediately encountered, primarily due to limitations of the [[Ward Leonard control|Ward Leonard]] current control system that had been chosen.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

A significant breakthrough occurred in 1914, when [[Hermann Lemp]], a [[GE]] electrical engineer, developed and patented a reliable [[direct current]] electrical control system (subsequent improvements were also patented by Lemp).&lt;ref&gt;Lemp, Hermann. U.S. Patent No. 1,154,785, filed April 8, 1914, and issued September 28, 1915. ''Accessed via Google Patent Search at: [http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT1154785&amp;id=UhpBAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=1154785 US Patent #1,154,785] on February 8, 2007.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Lemp's design used a single lever to control both engine and generator in a coordinated fashion, and was the [[prototype]] for all internal combustion–electric drive control systems.

In 1917–18, GE produced three experimental diesel–electric locomotives using Lemp's control design, the first known to be built in the United States.&lt;ref name="SDSG"&gt;{{harvnb|Pinkepank|1973|pp=139–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this development, the 1923 [[Kaufman Act]] banned steam locomotives from [[New York City]] because of severe pollution problems. The response to this law was to electrify high-traffic rail lines.  However, electrification was uneconomical to apply to lower-traffic areas.

The first regular use of diesel–electric locomotives was in [[Switcher|switching]] (shunter) applications, which were more forgiving than mainline applications of the limitations of contemporary diesel technology and where the idling economy of diesel relative to steam would be most beneficial.  GE entered a collaboration with the [[American Locomotive Company]] (ALCO) and [[Ingersoll-Rand]] (the "AGEIR" consortium) in 1924 to produce a prototype {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} "boxcab" locomotive delivered in July 1925. This locomotive demonstrated that the diesel–electric power unit could provide many of the benefits of an [[electric locomotive]] without the railroad having to bear the sizeable expense of electrification.{{sfn|Churella|1998|pp=25-27}} The unit successfully demonstrated, in switching and local freight and passenger service, on ten railroads and three industrial lines.&lt;ref&gt;Evolution of the American Diesel Locomotive, J Parker Lamb 2007, Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-253-34863-0}}, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;  Westinghouse Electric and Baldwin collaborated to build switching locomotives starting in 1929.  However, the [[Great Depression]] curtailed demand for Westinghouse's electrical equipment, and they stopped building locomotives internally, opting to supply electrical parts instead.{{sfn|Churella|1998|pp=28-30}}

In June 1925, [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] outshopped a prototype diesel–electric locomotive for "special uses" (such as for runs where water for steam locomotives was scarce) using electrical equipment from [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Railroads To Try Diesel Locomotive |newspaper=Special to the New York Times |date=February 18, 1925 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its twin-engine design was not successful, and the unit was scrapped after a short testing and demonstration period.{{sfn|Pinkepank|1973|p=283}} Industry sources were beginning to suggest “the outstanding advantages of this new form of motive power”.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=27}}  In 1929, the [[Canadian National Railways]] became the first North American railway to use diesels in mainline service with two units, 9000 and 9001, from Westinghouse.{{sfn|Pinkepank|1973|p=409}}  However, these early diesels proved expensive and unreliable, with their high cost of acquisition relative to steam unable to be realized in operating cost savings as they were frequently out of service.  It would be another five years before diesel-electric propulsion would be successfully used in mainline service, and nearly ten years before it would show real potential to fully replace steam.  

Before diesel power could make inroads into mainline service, the limitations of diesel engines circa 1930 - low power-to-weight ratios and narrow output range - had to be overcome.  A major effort to overcome those limitations was launched by [[General Motors]] after they moved into the diesel field with their acquisition of the [[Winton Engine Company]], a major manufacturer of diesel engines for marine and stationary applications, in 1930. Supported by the General Motors Research Division, GM's [[Cleveland Diesel Engine Division|Winton Engine Corporation]] sought to develop diesel engines suitable for high speed mobile use.  The first milestone in that effort was delivery in early 1934 of the Winton 201A, a [[two-stroke]], [[Roots Blower|Roots-blown]], [[Uniflow scavenging|uniflow-scavenged]], [[Unit injector|unit-injected]] [[diesel engine]] that could deliver the required performance for a fast, lightweight passenger train.  The second milestone, and the one that got American railroads moving towards diesel, was the 1938 delivery of GM's  [[EMD 567|Model 567]] engine that was designed specifically for locomotive use, bringing a fivefold increase in life of some mechanical parts and showing its potential for meeting the rigors of freight service.&lt;ref name=Kettering&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://utahrails.net/pdf/EMD_567_History_and_Development_1951.pdf |title=History and Development of the 567 Series General Motors Locomotive Engine |author=Kettering, E.W. |date={{date|1951-11-29|dmy}} |publisher=Electro-Motive Division, General Motors Corporation |conference=ASME 1951 Annual Meeting |location=Atlantic City, New Jersey |accessdate={{date|2015-01-06|dmy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diesel–electric railroad locomotion entered  mainline service when the [[Burlington Railroad]] and [[Union Pacific]] used custom-built diesel "[[streamliner]]s" to haul passengers, starting in late 1934.&lt;ref name="Stover 212"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=79oDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RasMTuyGFYifsQLC3sGzCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Diesel Streamliners Now Link Coast-to-Coast"] ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1937&lt;/ref&gt;Burlington's ''[[Burlington Zephyr|Zephyr]]'' trainsets evolved from articulated three car sets with 600 hp power cars in 1934 and early 1935, to the ''Denver Zephyr'' semi-articulated ten car trainsets pulled by cab-booster power sets introduced in late 1936.  Union Pacific started diesel streamliner service between Chicago and Portland Oregon in June 1935, and in the following year would add Los Angeles and Oakland California, and Denver Colorado to the destinations of diesel streamliners out of Chicago.  The Burlington and Union Pacific streamliners were built by the [[Budd Company]] and the [[Pullman-Standard|Pullman-Standard Company]], respectively, using the new Winton engines and power train systems designed by GM's [[Electro-Motive Corporation]].  EMC's experimental [[EMC 1800 hp B-B|1800 hp B-B]] locomotives of 1935 demonstrated the multiple-unit control systems used for the cab/booster sets and the twin engine format used with the later ''Zephyr'' power units.  Both of those features would be used in EMC's later production model locomotives.  The lightweight diesel streamliners of the mid-1930s demonstrated the advantages of diesel for passenger service with breakthrough schedule times, but diesel locomotive power would not fully come of age until regular series production of mainline diesel locomotives commenced and it was shown suitable for full-size passenger and freight service.

====First American series production locomotives====
Following their 1925 prototype, he AGEIR consortium produced 25 more units of {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} "60 ton" [[ALCO boxcab|AGEIR boxcab]] [[switcher|switching locomotives]] between 1925 and 1928 for several New York City railroads, making them the first series-produced diesel locomotives.  {{sfn|Pinkepank|1973|p=209–211}}  The consortium also produced seven twin-engine "100 ton" boxcabs and one hybrid trolley/battery unit with a diesel-driven charging circuit.  ALCO acquired the [[McIntosh &amp; Seymour]] Engine Company in 1929 and entered series production of {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|600|hp|kW|abbr=on}} single-cab switcher units in 1931.  ALCO would be the pre-eminent builder of switch engines through the mid-1930s and would adapt the basic switcher design to produce versatile and highly successful, albeit relatively low powered, road locomotives.  

GM, seeing the success of the custom streamliners, sought to expand the market for diesel power by producing standardized locomotives under their [[Electro-Motive Corporation]].  In 1936 EMC's new factory started production of switch engines.  In 1937 the factory started producing their new [[EMD E-unit|E series]] streamlined passenger locomotives, which would be upgraded with more reliable purpose-built engines in 1938.  Seeing the performance and reliability of the new [[EMD 567|567 model]] engine in passenger locomotives, EMC was eager to demonstrate diesel's viability in freight service.

Following the successful 1939 tour of [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMC's]] [[EMD FT|FT]] demonstrator freight locomotive set, the stage was set for dieselization of American railroads.  In 1941 [[ALCO-GE]] introduced the [[ALCO RS-1|RS-1]] road-switcher that occupied its own market niche while EMD's [[EMD F-unit|F series]] locomotives were sought for mainline freight service.  The US entry into World War II slowed conversion to diesel; the War Production Board put a halt to building new passenger equipment and gave naval uses priority for diesel engine production.  During the [[Big Inch|petroleum crisis of 1942-43]], coal-fired steam had the advantage of not using fuel that  was in critically short supply.   EMD was later allowed to increase production of its FT locomotives and ALCO-GE was allowed to produce a limited number of [[DL-109]] road locomotives, but most in the locomotive business were restricted to making switch engines and steam locomotives.  

In the early postwar era, EMD dominated the market for mainline locomotives with their E and F series locomotives.  ALCO-GE in the late 1940s produced switchers and road-switchers that were successful in the short-haul market.  However, EMD launched their [[EMD GP7|GP series]] road-switcher locomotives in 1949, which displaced all other locomotives in the freight market including their own F series locomotives.  GE subsequently dissolved its partnership with ALCO and would emerge as EMD's main competitor in the early 1960s, eventually taking the top position in the locomotive market from EMD.  

Early diesel–electric locomotives in the United States used direct current (DC) traction motors, but alternating current (AC) motors came into widespread use in the 1990s, starting with the [[EMD SD70 series|Electro-Motive SD70MAC]] in 1993 and followed by the [[GE AC4400CW|General Electric's AC4400CW]] in 1994 and [[GE AC6000CW|AC6000CW]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Brian, ''Locomotive'', 2001, pp 120, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early diesel locomotives and railcars in Europe===

====First functional diesel vehicles====
[[File:Limousin2010RVT01.jpg|thumb|[[Switzerland|Swiss]] &amp; [[Germany|German]] co-production: world's first functional diesel–electric railcar 1914]]
In 1914, world's first functional diesel–electric railcars were produced for the ''Königlich-Sächsische Staatseisenbahnen'' ([[Royal Saxon State Railways]]) by [[Waggonfabrik Rastatt]] with electric equipment from [[Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie]] and diesel engines from [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer AG]]. They were classified as [[Saxon DET 1-2|DET 1 and DET 2]] ([[:de:Sächsischer DET 1–2|de.wiki]]). Due to shortage of petrol products during [[World War I]], they remained unused for regular service in Germany. In 1922, they were sold to Swiss [[Compagnie du Chemin de fer Régional du Val-de-Travers]] ([[:fr:Régional du Val-de-Travers|fr.wiki]]), where they were used in regular service up to the [[Railway electrification system|electrification]] of the line in 1944. Afterwards, the company kept them in service as boosters till 1965.

[[Fiat]] claims a first Italian diesel–electric locomotive built in 1922, but little detail is available.  A Fiat-TIBB diesel–locomotive "A", of 440CV, is reported to have entered service on the Ferrovie Calabro Lucane in southern Italy in 1926, following trials in 1924-5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferrovie.it/forum/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=13653|title=vecchia loco ferrovie della Calabria - Ferrovie.it|website=www.ferrovie.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, two diesel–electric locomotives were taken in service by the [[Rail transport in the Soviet Union|Soviet railways]], almost at one time:
[[File:Teplovoz Eel2 (2).jpg|thumb|left|World's first useful diesel locomotive for long distances [[Russian locomotive class E el-2|SŽD Eel2]], 1924 in [[Kiev]]]]
* The engine Э&lt;sup&gt;эл&lt;/sup&gt;2 ([[Russian locomotive class E el-2|E&lt;sup&gt;el&lt;/sup&gt;2]] original number Юэ 001/Yu-e 001) started on October 22. It had been designed by a team led by [[Yuri Lomonosov]] and built 1923–1924 by [[Maschinenfabrik Esslingen]] in Germany. It had 5 driving axles (1'E1'). After several test rides, it hauled trains for almost three decades from 1925 to 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://izmerov.narod.ru/first/thefirst3.html|title=The first russian diesel locos|website=izmerov.narod.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though proved to be world's first functional diesel locomotive, it did not become a series,  but it became a model for several classes of Soviet diesel locomotives.
* The engine Щэл1 ([[Russian locomotive class shch-el-1|Shch-el 1]], original number ''Юэ2/Yu-e 2)'', started on November 9. It had been developed by [[Yakov Modestovich Gakkel]] ([[:ru:Гаккель, Яков Модестович|ru.wiki]]) and built by [[Baltic Shipyard]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. It had ten driving axles in three [[bogie]]s (1' Co' Do' Co' 1'). From 1925 to 1927, it hauled trains between [[Moscow]] and [[Kursk]] and in [[Caucasus]] region. Due to technical problems, afterwards it was out of service. Since 1934, it was used as a stationary electric generator.

In 1935, [[Krauss-Maffei]], [[MAN AG|MAN]] and [[Voith]] built the first diesel–hydraulic locomotive, called [[DRG Class V 140|V 140]], in Germany. The German railways (DRG) being very pleased with the performance of that engine, diesel–hydraulics became the mainstream in diesel locomotives in Germany.  Serial production of diesel locomotives in Germany began after World War II.

====Switchers====
[[File:Rangeerlocomotor NS 228.jpg|thumb|Shunter of [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]] from 1934, in modern livery]]
In many railway stations and industrial compounds, steam shunters had to be kept hot during lots of breaks between scattered short tasks. Therefore, diesel traction became economical for [[Shunting (rail)|shunting]] before it became economical for hauling trains. The construction of diesel shunters began in 1920 in France, in 1925 in Denmark, in 1926 in the Netherlands, and in 1927 in Germany. After few years of testing, hundreds of units were produced within a decade.

====Diesel railcars for regional traffic====
[[File:Autorail Renault VH2211 Mulhouse FRA 001.jpg|thumb|Renault VH, [[History of rail transport in France|France]], 1933/34]]
Diesel-powered or "oil-engined" railcars, generally diesel–mechanical, were developed by various European manufacturers in the 1930s, e.g. by [[William Beardmore and Company]] for the [[Canadian National Railways]] (the [[Beardmore Tornado]] engine was subsequently used in the [[R101]] airship). Some of those series for regional traffic were begun with gasoline motors and then continued with diesel motors, such as Hungarian BC&lt;sup&gt;mot&lt;/sup&gt; (The class code doesn't tell anything but "railmotor with 2nd and 3rd class seats".), 128 cars built 1926 – 1937, or German [[Wismar railbus]]es (57 cars 1932 – 1941). In France, the first diesel railcar was [[Renault VH]], 115 units produced 1933/34.
In Italy, after 6 Gasoline cars since 1931, Fiat and [[Società Italiana Ernesto Breda|Breda]] built a lot of diesel railmotors, more than 110 from 1933 to 1938 and 390 from 1940 to 1953, [[FS Class ALn 772|Class 772]] known as ''Littorina'', and Class ALn 900.

====High-speed railcars====
In the 1930s, streamlined highspeed diesel railcars were developed in several countries:
* In Germany, the [[Flying Hamburger]] was built in 1932. After a test ride in December 1932, this two coach diesel railcar (in English terminology a DMU2) started service at [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]] (DRG) in February 1933. It became the prototype of [[DRG Class SVT 137]] with 33 more highspeed DMUs, built for DRG till 1938, 13 DMU 2 ("Hamburg" series), 18 DMU 3 ("Leipzig" and "Köln" series), and 2 DMU 4 ("Berlin" series).
* French [[SNCF]] classes XF 1000 and XF 1100 comprised 11 high speed DMUs, also called TAR, built 1934–1939.
* In Hungary, [[Ganz Works]] built [[Arpád railmotor]] ([[:hu:Aamot|see hu.wiki]] and [[:de:MÁV-Baureihe Árpád|de.wiki]]), a kind of a luxurious railbus in a series of 7 items since 1934, and started to build [[Hargita]] DMU amazingly in 1944 ([[:hu:Hargita motorvonat|see hu.wiki]])

====Further developments====
[[File:LMS 10000 at Derby.jpg|thumb|[[British Rail Class D16/1]], since 1948]]In 1945, a batch of 30 Baldwin diesel–electric locomotives, [[Baldwin 0-6-6-0 1000]], was delivered from the United States to the railways of the Soviet Union.

In 1947, the London Midland &amp; Scottish Railway introduced the first of a pair of {{convert|1600|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Co-Co diesel–electric locomotives (later [[British Rail Class D16/1]]) for regular use in the United Kingdom, although British manufacturers such as Armstrong Whitworth had been exporting diesel locomotives since 1930.  Fleet deliveries to British Railways, of other designs such as Class 20 and Class 31, began in 1957.

Series production of diesel locomotives in Italy began in the mid-1950s. Generally, diesel traction in Italy was of less importance than in other countries, as it was amongst the most advanced countries in electrification of the main lines and, as a result of Italian geography, even on many domestic connections freight transport over sea is cheaper than rail transport.

===Early diesel locomotives and railcars in Asia===

====Japan====
In Japan, starting in the 1920s, some petrol-electric railcars were produced. The first diesel–electric traction and the first air-streamed vehicles on Japanese rails were the two DMU3s of class Kiha 43000 (キハ43000系) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rail.hobidas.com/photo/archives/2005/07/50.html|title=DD50 5　DD50 2｜随時アップ：消えた車輌写真館｜鉄道ホビダス|website=rail.hobidas.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Japan's first series of diesel locomotives was class DD50 (国鉄DD50形デ), twin locomotives, developed since 1950 and in service since 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.yahoo.co.jp/h53001126/4568133.html|title=キハ４３０００の資料 - しるねこの微妙な生活／浮気心あれば水心!?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====China====
One of the first home developed diesel vehicles of China was the DMU [[Dong Feng DMU|Dongfeng]] (东风), produced in 1958 by [[CSR Sifang Co Ltd.|CSR Sifang]].
Series production of China's first diesel locomotive class, the DFH 1, began in 1964 following construction of a prototype in 1959.

===Early diesel locomotives and railcars in Australia===
[[File:McKeen railmotor at Wodonga.jpg|thumb|A Mckeen railcar in Wodonga, Australia, 1911]]

The [[Trans-Australian Railway]] built 1912 to 1917 by Commonwealth Railways (CR) passes through 2000&amp;nbsp;km of waterless (or salt watered) desert terrain unsuitable for steam locomotives.  The original engineer [[Henry Deane (engineer)|Henry Deane]] envisaged [[Diesel engine|diesel operation]] to overcome such problems.&lt;ref name=burk&gt;Burke, A 1991., ''Rails through the Wilderness''; New South Wales University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Some have suggested that the CR worked with the South Australian Railways to trial diesel traction.&lt;ref&gt;Holden, R 2006 No. 259 : the curious story of a forgotten locomotive, Railmac Publications&lt;/ref&gt; However, the technology was not developed enough to be reliable.

As in Europe, the usage of internal combustion engines advanced more readily in self-propelled railcars than in locomotives.
* Some Australian railway companies bought [[McKeen railcars]].
* In the 1920s and 1930s, more reliable Gasoline railmotors were built by Australian industries.
* Australia's first diesel railcars were the NSWGR 100 Class (PH later DP) Silver City Comet cars in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Rail Motors and XPTs, David Cooke, ARHS, NSW Division, 1984 pp40-59&lt;/ref&gt;
* High speed vehicles for those days' possibilities on {{RailGauge|3ft6in|lk=on}} were the 10 [[NZR RM class (Vulcan)|Vulcan railcars]] of 1940 for New Zealand.

==Transmission types==
Unlike steam engines, internal combustion engines require a transmission to power the wheels. The engine must be allowed to continue to run when the locomotive is stopped.

===Diesel–mechanical===
[[File:DieselMechanicalLocomotiveSchematic.svg|thumb|Schematic illustration of a diesel mechanical locomotive]]

A diesel–mechanical locomotive uses a [[Transmission (mechanics)|mechanical transmission]] in a fashion similar to that employed in most road vehicles. This type of transmission is generally limited to low-powered, low speed [[shunting (rail)|shunting]] (switching) locomotives, lightweight [[multiple unit]]s and self-propelled [[railcar]]s.

[[Image:D2069 at Doncaster Works.JPG|thumb|left|A [[British Rail Class 03]] diesel–mechanical [[shunter]] with a [[Jackshaft (locomotive)|jackshaft]] under the cab.]]
The mechanical transmissions used for railroad propulsion are generally more complex and much more robust than standard-road versions.  There is usually a [[fluid coupling]] interposed between the engine and gearbox, and the gearbox is often of the [[epicyclic gearing|epicyclic (planetary)]] type to permit shifting while under load.  Various systems have been devised to minimise the break in transmission during gear changing; e.g., the S.S.S. (synchro-self-shifting) gearbox used by [[Hudswell Clarke]].

Diesel–mechanical propulsion is limited by the difficulty of building a reasonably sized transmission capable of coping with the power and [[torque]] required to move a heavy train.  A number of attempts to use diesel–mechanical propulsion in high power applications have been made (e.g., the {{convert|1500|kW|hp|abbr=on}} [[British Rail 10100]] locomotive), although none have proved successful in the end.

===Diesel–electric===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
{{see also|Diesel–electric transmission}}
{{For|locomotives powered by both external electricity and diesel fuel|#Electro-diesel}}
{{for|locomotives powered by a combination of diesel or fuel cells and batteries or ultracapacitors|hybrid train}}
[[File:DieselElectricLocomotiveSchematic.svg|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of diesel electric locomotive]]
In a '''diesel–electric''' locomotive, the diesel engine drives either an electrical [[Electric generator|DC generator]] (generally, less than {{convert|3000|hp}} net for traction), or an electrical [[alternator|AC alternator-rectifier]] (generally {{convert|3000|hp}} net or more for traction), the output of which provides power to the [[traction motor]]s that drive the locomotive. There is no mechanical connection between the diesel engine and the wheels.

The important components of diesel–electric propulsion are the diesel engine (also known as the [[Prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]]), the main generator/alternator-rectifier, traction motors (usually with four or six axles), and a control system consisting of the engine [[governor (device)|governor]] and electrical or electronic components, including [[switchgear]], [[rectifiers]] and other components, which control or modify the electrical supply to the traction motors. In the most elementary case, the generator may be directly connected to the motors with only very simple switchgear.

[[File:Metra Locomotives F40PH-2 &amp; MP36PH-3S.jpg|thumb|left|The [[EMD F40PH]] (left) and [[MPI MPXpress]]-series MP36PH-3S (right) [[locomotive]]s [[Railway coupling|coupled]] together by [[Metra]] use [[diesel–electric transmission]].]]
[[Image:2TE10U Russian Locomotive.jpg|thumb|right|Soviet 2TE10U locomotive]]
Originally, the traction motors and generator were [[direct current|DC]] machines. Following the development of high-capacity [[silicon rectifiers]] in the 1960s, the DC generator was replaced by an [[alternator]] using a [[diode bridge]] to convert its output to DC. This advance greatly improved locomotive reliability and decreased generator maintenance costs by elimination of the [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] and [[brush (electric)|brushes]] in the generator.  Elimination of the brushes and commutator, in turn, disposed of the possibility of a particularly destructive type of event referred to as a [[flashover (electrical)|flashover]], which could result in immediate generator failure and, in some cases, start an engine room fire.

Current North American practice is for four axles for high-speed passenger or "time" freight, or for six axles for lower-speed or "manifest" freight. The most modern units on "time" freight service tend to have six axles underneath the frame. Unlike those in "manifest" service, "time" freight units will have only four of the axles connected to traction motors, with the other two as idler axles for weight distribution.

In the late 1980s, the development of high-power [[Variable-frequency drive|variable-voltage/variable-frequency]] (VVVF) drives, or "traction inverters," has allowed the use of polyphase AC traction motors, thus also eliminating the motor commutator and brushes.  The result is a more efficient and reliable drive that requires relatively little maintenance and is better able to cope with overload conditions that often destroyed the older types of motors.

====Diesel–electric control====
[[Image:S3DieselElectricLocomotiveSRM.jpg|thumb|left|[[Montreal Locomotive Works|MLW]] model S-3 produced in 1957 for the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] adhering to designs by [[American Locomotive Company|ALCO]].]]
A diesel–electric locomotive's power output is independent of road speed, as long as the unit's generator current and voltage limits are not exceeded. Therefore, the unit's ability to develop [[tractive effort]] (also referred to as drawbar pull or [[tractive force]], which is what actually propels the train) will tend to inversely vary with speed within these limits. (See power curve below). Maintaining acceptable operating parameters was one of the principal design considerations that had to be solved in early diesel–electric locomotive development and, ultimately, led to the complex control systems in place on modern units.

====Throttle operation====

[[Image:116U-rabmash.jpg|thumb|Cab of the Russian locomotive 2TE116U, 11 — throttle]]

The prime mover's [[Power (physics)|power]] output is primarily determined by its rotational speed ([[revolutions per minute|RPM]]) and fuel rate, which are regulated by a [[governor (device)|governor]] or similar mechanism.  The governor is designed to react to both the throttle setting, as determined by the engine driver and the speed at which the prime mover is running.&lt;ref&gt;[[Control theory]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Locomotive power output, and thus speed, is typically controlled by the engine driver using a stepped or "notched" [[throttle]] that produces [[binary data|binary]]-like electrical signals corresponding to throttle position.  This basic design lends itself well to [[multiple unit]] (MU) operation by producing discrete conditions that assure that all units in a [[consist]] respond in the same way to throttle position.  Binary encoding also helps to minimize the number of [[Multiple-unit train control#Locomotive applications|trainlines]] (electrical connections) that are required to pass signals from unit to unit.  For example, only four trainlines are required to encode all possible throttle positions.

North American locomotives, such as those built by [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] or [[General Electric]], have nine throttle positions, one idle and eight power (as well as an emergency stop position that shuts down the prime mover). Many [[UK]]-built locomotives have a ten-position throttle.  The power positions are often referred to by locomotive crews as "run 3" or "notch 3", depending upon the throttle setting.

In older locomotives, the throttle mechanism was [[ratchet (device)|ratcheted]] so that it was not possible to advance more than one power position at a time. The engine driver could not, for example, pull the throttle from notch 2 to notch 4 without stopping at notch 3. This feature was intended to prevent rough train handling due to abrupt power increases caused by rapid throttle motion ("throttle stripping," an operating rules violation on many railroads).  Modern locomotives no longer have this restriction, as their control systems are able to smoothly modulate power and avoid sudden changes in [[train]] loading regardless of how the engine driver operates the controls.

When the throttle is in the idle position, the prime mover will be receiving minimal fuel, causing it to idle at low RPM.  In addition, the traction motors will not be connected to the main generator and the generator's field windings will not be excited (energized) — the generator will not produce electricity with no excitation.  Therefore, the locomotive will be in "neutral".  Conceptually, this is the same as placing an automobile's transmission into neutral while the engine is running.

To set the locomotive in motion, the [[reverser handle|reverser control handle]] is placed into the correct position (forward or reverse), the [[air brake (rail)|brake]] is released and the throttle is moved to the run 1 position (the first power notch). An experienced engine driver can accomplish these steps in a coordinated fashion that will result in a nearly imperceptible start. The positioning of the reverser and movement of the throttle together is conceptually like shifting an automobile's automatic transmission into gear while the engine is idling

Placing the throttle into the first power position will cause the traction motors to be connected to the main generator and the latter's field coils to be excited. With excitation applied, the main generator will deliver electricity to the traction motors, resulting in motion. If the locomotive is running "light" (that is, not coupled to the rest of a train) and is not on an ascending grade, it will easily accelerate. On the other hand, if a long train is being started, the locomotive may stall as soon as some of the slack has been taken up, as the drag imposed by the train will exceed the tractive force being developed. An experienced engine driver will be able to recognize an incipient stall and will gradually advance the throttle as required to maintain the pace of acceleration.

As the throttle is moved to higher power notches, the fuel rate to the prime mover will increase, resulting in a corresponding increase in RPM and horsepower output. At the same time, main generator field excitation will be proportionally increased to absorb the higher power. This will translate into increased electrical output to the traction motors, with a corresponding increase in tractive force. Eventually, depending on the requirements of the train's schedule, the engine driver will have moved the throttle to the position of maximum power and will maintain it there until the train has accelerated to the desired speed.

As will be seen in the following discussion, the propulsion system is designed to produce maximum traction motor torque at start-up, which explains why modern locomotives are capable of starting trains weighing in excess of 15,000 tons, even on ascending grades.  Current technology allows a locomotive to develop as much as 30 percent of its loaded driver weight in tractive force, amounting to some {{convert|120000|lbf|kN}} of [[tractive force|drawbar pull]] for a large, six-axle freight (goods) unit.  In fact, a [[consist]] of such units can produce more than enough drawbar pull at start-up to damage or derail cars (if on a curve) or break couplers (the latter being referred to in North American railroad slang as "jerking a lung"). Therefore, it is incumbent upon the engine driver to carefully monitor the amount of power being applied at start-up to avoid damage. In particular, "jerking a lung" could be a calamitous matter if it were to occur on an ascending grade, except that the safety inherent in the correct operation of [[air brake (rail)|automatic train brakes]] installed in wagons today, prevents runaway trains by automatically applying the wagon brakes when train line air pressure drops.

====Propulsion system operation====
[[Image:3000hp curve ver2.jpg|thumb|350px|Typical main generator constant power curve at "notch 8"]]
[[Image:116U-left-corridore-diesel.jpg|thumb|Left corridor of power compartment of Russian locomotive 2TE116U, 3 — alternator, 4 — rectifier, 6 — diesel]]
A locomotive's control system is designed so that the main generator [[electrical power]] output is matched to any given engine speed. Given the innate characteristics of traction motors, as well as the way in which the motors are connected to the main generator, the generator will produce high current and low voltage at low locomotive speeds, gradually changing to low current and high voltage as the locomotive accelerates. Therefore, the net power produced by the locomotive will remain constant for any given throttle setting (''see power curve graph for notch 8'').

In older designs, the prime mover's governor and a companion device, the load regulator, play a central role in the control system. The governor has two external inputs: requested engine speed, determined by the engine driver's throttle setting, and actual engine speed ([[feedback]]). The governor has two external control outputs: [[fuel injector]] setting, which determines the engine fuel rate, and load regulator position, which affects main generator excitation.  The governor also incorporates a separate overspeed protective mechanism that will immediately cut off the fuel supply to the injectors and sound an alarm in the [[Cab (locomotive)|cab]] in the event the prime mover exceeds a defined RPM.  Not all of these inputs and outputs are necessarily electrical.

The load regulator is essentially a large [[potentiometer]] that controls the main generator power output by varying its field excitation and hence the degree of loading applied to the engine.  The load regulator's job is relatively complex, because although the prime mover's power output is proportional to RPM and fuel rate, the main generator's output is not (which characteristic was not correctly handled by the [[Ward Leonard control|Ward Leonard]] elevator- and hoist-type drive system that was initially tried in early locomotives). Instead, a quite complex electro-hydraulic [[Woodward, Inc.|Woodward]] governor was employed. Today, this important function would be performed by the Engine control unit, itself being a part of the Locomotive control unit.
[[File:Russian Diesel Locomotive TEP80.JPG|right|thumb|Russian diesel locomotive TEP80]]
As the load on the engine changes, its rotational speed will also change. This is detected by the governor through a change in the engine speed feedback signal.  The net effect is to adjust both the fuel rate and the load regulator position so that engine RPM and [[torque]] (and thus power output) will remain constant for any given throttle setting, regardless of actual road speed.

In newer designs controlled by a “traction computer,” each engine speed step is allotted an appropriate power output, or “kW reference”, in software. The computer compares this value with actual main generator power output, or “kW feedback”, calculated from traction motor current and main generator voltage feedback values. The computer adjusts the feedback value to match the reference value by controlling the excitation of the main generator, as described above. The governor still has control of engine speed, but the load regulator no longer plays a central role in this type of control system. However, the load regulator is retained as a “back-up” in case of engine overload.  Modern locomotives fitted with [[electronic fuel injection]] (EFI) may have no mechanical governor; however a “virtual” load regulator and governor are retained with computer modules.

Traction motor performance is controlled either by varying the DC voltage output of the main generator, for DC motors, or by varying the frequency and voltage output of the [[Variable-frequency drive|VVVF]] for AC motors.  With DC motors, various connection combinations are utilized to adapt the drive to varying operating conditions.

At standstill, main generator output is initially low voltage/high current, often in excess of 1000 [[ampere]]s per motor at full power.  When the locomotive is at or near standstill, current flow will be limited only by the DC resistance of the motor windings and interconnecting circuitry, as well as the capacity of the main generator itself.  Torque in a [[Traction motor|series-wound motor]] is approximately proportional to the square of the current. Hence, the traction motors will produce their highest torque, causing the locomotive to develop maximum [[tractive effort]], enabling it to overcome the inertia of the train. This effect is analogous to what happens in an automobile [[automatic transmission]] at start-up, where it is in first gear and thus producing maximum torque multiplication.

As the locomotive accelerates, the now-rotating motor armatures will start to generate a [[counter-electromotive force]] (back EMF, meaning the motors are also trying to act as generators), which will oppose the output of the main generator and cause traction motor current to decrease. Main generator voltage will correspondingly increase in an attempt to maintain motor power, but will eventually reach a plateau. At this point, the locomotive will essentially cease to accelerate, unless on a downgrade. Since this plateau will usually be reached at a speed substantially less than the maximum that may be desired, something must be done to change the drive characteristics to allow continued acceleration. This change is referred to as "transition," a process that is analogous to shifting gears in an automobile.

Transition methods include:
* Series / Parallel or "motor transition".
** Initially, pairs of motors are connected in series across the main generator. At higher speed, motors are reconnected in parallel across the main generator.
* "Field shunting", "field diverting", or "weak fielding".
** Resistance is connected in parallel with the motor field. This has the effect of increasing the [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] current, producing a corresponding increase in motor torque and speed.

Both methods may also be combined, to increase the operating speed range.
* Generator / rectifier transition
** Reconnecting the two separate internal main generator [[alternator|stator windings]] of two rectifiers from parallel to series to increase the output voltage.

In older locomotives, it was necessary for the engine driver to manually execute transition by use of a separate control. As an aid to performing transition at the right time, the [[ammeter|load meter]] (an indicator that shows the engine driver how much current is being drawn by the traction motors) was calibrated to indicate at which points forward or backward transition should take place. Automatic transition was subsequently developed to produce better operating efficiency and to protect the main generator and traction motors from overloading from improper transition.

Modern locomotives incorporate traction ''inverters'', AC to DC, with the capability to deliver 1,200 volts (earlier traction ''generators'', DC to DC, had the capability to deliver only 600 volts). This improvement was accomplished largely through improvements in silicon diode technology. With the capability to deliver 1,200 volts to the traction motors, the necessity for "transition" was eliminated.

====Dynamic braking====
{{Main article|Dynamic brake}}
A common option on diesel–electric locomotives is [[Dynamic braking|dynamic (rheostatic) braking]].

Dynamic braking takes advantage of the fact that the [[traction motor]] armatures are always rotating when the locomotive is in motion and that a motor can be made to act as a [[electrical generator|generator]] by separately exciting the field winding.  When dynamic braking is utilized, the traction control circuits are configured as follows:
* The field winding of each traction motor is connected across the main generator.
* The armature of each traction motor is connected across a forced-air-cooled [[resistor|resistance grid]] (the dynamic braking grid) in the roof of the locomotive's hood.
* The prime mover RPM is increased and the main generator field is excited, causing a corresponding excitation of the traction motor fields.

The aggregate effect of the above is to cause each traction motor to generate electric power and dissipate it as heat in the dynamic braking grid.  A fan connected across the grid provides forced-air cooling.  Consequently, the fan is powered by the output of the traction motors and will tend to run faster and produce more airflow as more energy is applied to the grid.

Ultimately, the source of the energy dissipated in the dynamic braking grid is the motion of the locomotive as imparted to the traction motor armatures.  Therefore, the traction motors impose drag and the locomotive acts as a brake.  As speed decreases, the braking effect decays and usually becomes ineffective below approximately 16&amp;nbsp;km/h (10&amp;nbsp;mph), depending on the gear ratio between the traction motors and [[axle]]s.

Dynamic braking is particularly beneficial when operating in mountainous regions; where there is always the danger of a runaway due to overheated friction brakes during descent.  In such cases, dynamic brakes are usually applied in conjunction with the [[air brake (rail)|air brakes]], the combined effect being referred to as [[blended brake|blended braking]].  The use of blended braking can also assist in keeping the slack in a long train stretched as it crests a grade, helping to prevent a "run-in", an abrupt bunching of train slack that can cause a derailment.  Blended braking is also commonly used with [[commuter train]]s to reduce wear and tear on the mechanical brakes that is a natural result of the numerous stops such trains typically make during a run.

====Electro-diesel====
[[Image:GE Genesis P32AC-DM 202 MNCRR Ossining.jpg|thumb|[[Metro-North]]'s [[GE Genesis#P32AC-DM|GE Genesis P32AC-DM]] electro-diesel locomotive can also operate off of [[third-rail]] electrification.]]
{{Main article|Electro-diesel locomotive}}
These special locomotives can operate as an [[electric locomotive]] or as a diesel locomotive.  The [[Long Island Rail Road]], [[Metro-North Railroad]] and [[New Jersey Transit Rail Operations]] operate dual-mode diesel–electric/third-rail ([[Overhead line|catenary]] on NJTransit) locomotives between non-electrified territory and [[New York City]] because of a local law banning diesel-powered locomotives in [[Manhattan]] tunnels.  For the same reason, [[Amtrak]] operates a fleet of dual-mode locomotives in the New York area.  [[British Rail]] operated dual diesel–electric/electric locomotives designed to run primarily as electric locomotives with reduced power available when running on diesel power.  This allowed railway yards to remain un-electrified, as the third rail power system is extremely hazardous in a yard area.

===Diesel–hydraulic===
&lt;!-- The material on torque converters is confusing and somewhat inaccurate. The editor should examine the torque converter article for correct terminology. --&gt;
Diesel–hydraulic locomotives use one or more [[torque converter]]s, in combination with gears, with a mechanical final drive to convey the power from the diesel engine to the wheels.

====Hydrostatic transmission====

Hydraulic drive systems using a hydrostatic [[hydraulic drive system]] have been applied to rail use. Modern examples included {{convert|350|to|750|hp|abbr=on}}  shunting locomotives by [[Cockerill Maintenance &amp; Ingénierie|CMI Group]] (Belgium),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cmigroupe.com/en/p/shunting-locomotives| work = www.cmigroupe.com| accessdate =February 2014 | title = Shunting locomotives}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4 to 12 tonne {{convert|35|to|58|kW|abbr=on}} narrow gauge industrial locomotives by [[Atlas Copco]] subsidiary GIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.gia.se/gia/products/locomotives/ |title=Locomotives |work=www.gia.se |accessdate=February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330074808/http://www.gia.se/gia/products/locomotives/ |archivedate=2014-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrostatic drives are also utilised in railway maintenance machines (tampers, rail grinders).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url =|first  =Brian| last = Solomon| title = Railway Maintenance Equipment: The Men and Machines That Keep the Railroads Running| publisher = Voyager Press| year = 2001|pages =78, 96|isbn = 978-0760309759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Application of hydrostatic transmissions is generally limited to small shunting locomotives and rail maintenance equipment, as well as being used for non-tractive applications in diesel engines such as drives for traction motor fans.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

====Hydrokinetic transmission====
{{see also|Torque converter|Fluid coupling}}
[[Image:Db-220002-01-c.jpg|thumb|right|[[Deutsche Bundesbahn|DB]] class [[DB class V 200|V 200]] diesel–hydraulic]]
[[Image:ID diesel loco BB 303-84-12 120920-0145 mdn.JPG|thumb|right|A Henschel (Germany) diesel–hydraulic locomotive in [[Medan]], [[North Sumatra]] ]]
Hydrokinetic transmission (also called hydrodynamic transmission) uses a [[torque converter]]. A torque converter consists of three main parts, two of which rotate, and one (the [[stator]]) that has a lock preventing backwards rotation and adding output torque by redirecting the oil flow at low output RPM. All three main parts are sealed in an oil-filled housing. To match engine speed to load speed over the entire speed range of a locomotive some additional method is required to give sufficient range. One method is to follow the torque converter with a mechanical gearbox which switches ratios automatically, similar to an automatic transmission on a car. Another method is to provide several torque converters each with a range of variability covering part of the total required; all the torque converters are mechanically connected all the time, and the appropriate one for the speed range required is selected by filling it with oil and draining the others. The filling and draining is carried out with the transmission under load, and results in very smooth range changes with no break in the transmitted power.

Diesel–hydraulic locomotives are less efficient than diesel–electrics. The first-generation BR diesel hydraulics were significantly less efficient (c. 65%) than diesel electrics (c. 80%){{citation needed|date=February 2014}} — moreover initial versions were found in many countries to be mechanically more complicated and more likely to break down.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Hydraulic transmission for locomotives was developed in Germany.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} There is still debate over the relative merits of hydraulic vs. electrical transmission systems: advantages claimed for hydraulic systems include lower weight, high reliability, and lower capital cost.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

By the 21st century, for diesel locomotive traction worldwide the majority of countries used diesel–electric designs, with diesel hydraulic designs not found in use outside Germany and Japan, and some neighbouring states, where it is used in designs for freight work.

In Germany and Finland, diesel–hydraulic systems have achieved high reliability in operation.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In the UK the diesel–hydraulic principle gained a poor reputation due to the poor durability and reliability of the Maybach [[Mekydro]] hydraulic transmission.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Argument continues over the relative reliability of hydraulic systems, with questions over whether data has been manipulated to favour local suppliers over non-German ones.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===== Multiple units=====
Diesel–hydraulic drive is common in multiple units, with various transmission designs used including [[Voith]] torque converters, and [[fluid coupling]]s in combination with mechanical gearing.

The majority of [[British Rail]]'s second generation passenger DMU stock used hydraulic transmission. In the 21st century designs using hydraulic transmission include [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]]{{'s}} [[Turbostar]], [[Bombardier Talent|Talent]], [[RegioSwinger]] families; diesel engined versions of [[Siemens]]{{'s}} [[Desiro]] platform, and the [[Stadler Regio-Shuttle]].

Diesel–hydraulic locomotives have a smaller market share than those with diesel electric transmission - the main worldwide user of main-line hydraulic transmissions was the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], with designs including the 1950s [[DB class V 200]], and the 1960 and 1970s [[DB Class V 160 family]]. [[British Rail]] introduced a number of diesel hydraulic designs during it [[1955 Modernisation Plan]], initially license built versions of German designs (see [[:Category:Diesel-hydraulic locomotives of Great Britain|Category:Diesel–hydraulic locomotives of Great Britain]]). In Spain [[RENFE]] used high power to weight ratio twin engined German designs to haul high speed trains from the 1960s to 1990s. (see [[RENFE Class 340|RENFE Classes 340]], [[RENFE Class 350|350]], [[RENFE Class 352|352]], [[RENFE Class 353|353]], [[RENFE Class 354|354]])

Other main-line locomotives of the post war period included the 1950s [[GMD GMDH-1]] experimental locomotives; the [[Henschel &amp; Son]] built [[South African Class 61-000]]; in the 1960s [[Southern Pacific]] bought 18 Krauss-Maffei [[KM ML-4000]] diesel–hydraulic locomotives. The [[Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western]] also bought three, all of which were later sold to SP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In Finland, over 200 Finnish-built VR class [[VR Class Dv12|Dv12]] and Dr14 diesel–hydraulics with [[Voith]] transmissions have been continuously used since the early 1960s. All units of Dr14 class and most units of Dv12 class are still in service. VR has abandoned some weak-conditioned units of 2700 series Dv12s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iltasanomat.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/uutinen.asp?id=1740927 Suruliputus saatteli veturit viimeiselle matkalle] {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century series production standard gauge diesel–hydraulic designs include the [[Voith Gravita]], ordered by [[Deutsche Bahn]], and the [[Vossloh G2000]], [[Vossloh G1206|G1206]] and [[Vossloh G1700 BB|G1700]] designs, all manufactured in Germany for freight use.

===Diesel–steam===
[[File:Teploparovoz TP1.jpg|thumb|Soviet Locomotive TP1]]
{{Main article|Steam diesel hybrid locomotive}}
Steam-diesel hybrid locomotives can use steam generated from a boiler or diesel to power a piston engine. The ''Cristiani Compressed Steam System'' used a diesel engine to power a compressor to drive and recirculate steam produced by a boiler; effectively using steam as the power transmission medium, with the diesel engine being the [[prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/compsteam/compsteam.htm The Paragon-Cristiani Compressed Steam System] ''dslef.dsl.pipex.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diesel–pneumatic===
The diesel-pneumatic locomotive was of interest in the 1930s because it offered the possibility of converting existing steam locomotives to diesel operation.  The frame and cylinders of the steam locomotive would be retained and the boiler would be replaced by a diesel engine driving an [[air compressor]].  The problem was low [[thermal efficiency]] because of the large amount of energy wasted as heat in the air compressor.  Attempts were made to compensate for this by using the diesel exhaust to re-heat the compressed air but these had limited success.  A German proposal of 1929 did result in a prototype&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/diesair/diesair.htm |title=A German Diesel-Pneumatic Locomotive |publisher=Douglas-self.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a similar British proposal of 1932, to use an [[LNER Class R1]] locomotive, never got beyond the design stage.

==Multiple-unit operation==
[[Image:GM-EMD 2000.jpg|thumb|Diesel–electric locomotive built by EMD for service in the UK and continental Europe.]]
Most diesel locomotives are capable of [[Multiple-unit train control|multiple unit operation (MU)]] as a means of increasing [[horsepower]] and [[tractive effort]] when hauling heavy trains. All [[North America]]n locomotives, including export models, use a standardized [[Association of American Railroads|AAR]] electrical control system interconnected by a 27-pin [[jumper cable]] between the units. For UK-built locomotives, a number of incompatible control systems are used, but the most common is the Blue Star system, which is electro-pneumatic and fitted to most early diesel classes. A small number of types, typically higher-powered locomotives intended for passenger only work, do not have multiple control systems. In all cases, the electrical control connections made common to all units in a [[consist]] are referred to as [[trainline (railroad)|trainlines]].  The result is that all locomotives in a [[consist]] behave as one in response to the engine driver's control movements.

The ability to couple diesel–electric locomotives in an MU fashion was first introduced in the [[EMD FT]] four-unit demonstrator that toured the United States in 1939. At the time, American railroad work rules required that each operating locomotive in a train had to have on board a full crew. [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] circumvented that requirement by coupling the individual units of the demonstrator with [[Drawbar (haulage)|drawbars]] instead of conventional [[Railway coupling|knuckle couplers]] and declaring the combination to be a single locomotive.  Electrical interconnections were made so one engine driver could operate the entire consist from the head-end unit.  Later on, work rules were amended and the semi-permanent coupling of units with drawbars was eliminated in favour of couplers, as servicing had proved to be somewhat cumbersome owing to the total length of the consist (about 200 feet or nearly 61 meters).

In mountainous regions, it is common to interpose [[helper locomotive]]s in the middle of the train, both to provide the extra power needed to ascend a grade and to limit the amount of [[tensile stress|stress]] applied to the [[Railway coupling#Drawgear|draft gear]] of the car coupled to the head-end power.  The helper units in such [[distributed power]] configurations are controlled from the lead unit's cab through coded radio signals.  Although this is technically not an MU configuration, the behaviour is the same as with physically interconnected units.

===Cab arrangements===
Cab arrangements vary by builder and operator. Practice in the U.S. has traditionally been for a cab at one end of the locomotive with limited visibility if the locomotive is not operated cab forward. This is not usually a problem as U.S. locomotives are usually operated in pairs, or threes, and arranged so that a cab is at each end of each set. European practice is usually for a cab at each end of the locomotive as trains are usually light enough to operate with one locomotive. Early U.S. practice was to add power units without cabs (booster or [[B unit]]s) and the arrangement was often A-B, A-A, A-B-A, A-B-B, or A-B-B-A where A was a unit with a cab. Center cabs were sometimes used for switch locomotives.

===Cow-calf===
{{Main article|Cow-calf}}
In North American railroading, a [[cow-calf]] set is a pair of switcher-type locomotives: one (the cow) equipped with a driving cab, the other (the calf) without a cab, and controlled from the cow through cables.  Cow-calf sets are used in heavy switching and [[hump yard]] service. Some are radio controlled without an operating engineer present in the cab. This arrangement is also known as [[Master-slave (technology)|master-slave]]. Where two connected units were present, [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] called these TR-2s (approximately {{convert|2,000|HP|abbr=on|disp=or}}); where three units, TR-3s (approximately {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

Cow-calves have largely disappeared as these engine combinations exceeded their economic lifetimes many years ago.

Present North American practice is to pair two {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on}} [[EMD GP40-2|GP40-2]] or [[EMD SD40-2|SD40-2]] road switchers, often nearly worn-out and very soon ready for rebuilding or scrapping, and to utilize these for so-called "transfer" uses, for which the TR-2, TR-3 and TR-4 engines were originally intended, hence the designation TR, for "transfer".

Occasionally, the second unit may have its prime-mover and traction alternator removed and replaced by concrete or steel ballast and the power for traction obtained from the master unit. As a 16-cylinder prime-mover generally weighs in the {{convert|36,000|lb|adj=on}} range, and a {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on}} traction alternator generally weighs in the {{convert|18,000|lb|adj=on}} range, this would mean that {{convert|54,000|lb|abbr=on}} would be needed for ballast.

A pair of fully capable "Dash 2" units would be rated {{convert|6,000|HP|abbr=on}}. A "Dash 2" pair where only one had a prime-mover/alternator would be rated {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on}}, with all power provided by master, but the combination benefits from the tractive effort provided by the slave as engines in transfer service are seldom called upon to provide {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on}} much less {{convert|6,000|HP|abbr=on}} on a continuous basis.

==Fittings and appliances==

===Flameproofing===
A standard diesel locomotive presents a very low fire risk but “flame proofing” can reduce the risk even further.  This involves fitting a water-filled box to the exhaust pipe to quench any red-hot carbon particles that may be emitted.  Other precautions may include a fully insulated electrical system (neither side earthed to the frame) and all electric wiring enclosed in conduit.

The flameproof diesel locomotive has replaced the [[fireless steam locomotive]] in areas of high fire risk such as [[oil refineries]] and [[ammunition dump]]s.  Preserved examples of flameproof diesel locomotives include:
* ''Francis Baily of Thatcham'' (ex-[[RAF Welford]]) at [[Southall Railway Centre]]
* ''Naworth'' (ex-[[National Coal Board]]) at the [[South Tynedale Railway]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strps.org.uk/str/stocklist/locos/04-Naworth.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106030908/http://www.strps.org.uk/str/stocklist/locos/04-Naworth.htm |date=January 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Latest development of the "Flameproof Diesel Vehicle Applied New Exhaust Gas Dry Type Treatment System” does not need the water supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200210/000020021002A0274001.php/ |title=Development of the Flameproof Diesel Vehicle Applied New Exhaust Gas Dry Type Treatment System |publisher=Sciencelinks.jp |date=2009-03-18 |accessdate=2011-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217004508/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200210/000020021002A0274001.php/ |archivedate=2012-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lights===
[[File:Canadian National diesels southbound on the Norfolk Southern near Polaris Mall in Columbus, Ohio (2092116881).jpg|thumb|right|A [[Canadian National Railway]] train showing the placement of the headlight and ditch lights on the locomotive.]]
The lights fitted to diesel locomotives vary from country to country. North American locomotives are fitted with two headlights (for safety in case one malfunctions) and a pair of ditch lights. The latter are fitted low down at the front and are designed to make the locomotive easily visible as it approaches a [[grade crossing]]. Older locomotives may be fitted with a Gyralite or [[Mars Light]] instead of the ditch lights.

==Environmental impact==
{{See also|Diesel exhaust}}
Although diesel locomotives generally emit less sulphur dioxide, a major [[Pollution|pollutant]] to the environment, and greenhouse gases than steam locomotives, they are not completely clean in that respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.niu.edu/northerntoday/2008/sept22/locomotive.shtml |title=Engineering gets $1 million grant to make locomotives leaner, greener |publisher=Northern Illinois University |last=King |first=Joe |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910064330/http://www.niu.edu/northerntoday/2008/sept22/locomotive.shtml |archivedate=2012-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, like other diesel powered vehicles, they emit [[NOx|nitrogen oxides]] and [[fine particles]], which are a risk to public health. In fact, in this last respect diesel locomotives may perform worse than steam locomotives.

For years, it was thought by American government scientists who measure [[air pollution]] that diesel locomotive engines were relatively clean and emitted far less health-threatening emissions than those of diesel trucks or other vehicles; however, the scientists discovered that because they used faulty estimates of the amount of fuel consumed by diesel locomotives, they grossly understated the amount of pollution generated annually (In Europe, where most major railways have been electrified, there is less concern). After revising their calculations, they concluded that the annual emissions of nitrogen oxide, a major ingredient in [[smog]] and [[acid rain]], and soot would be by 2030 nearly twice what they originally assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/13/AR2006081300530.html | title = Attention to Locomotives' Emissions Renewed | work = Washington Post | last = Eilperin | first = Juliet | date = 2006-08-14 | accessdate = 2011-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-02-14/news/ct-met-metra-air-testing-20110213_1_scott-fruin-outbound-trains-oldest-trains | title = Metra finds 'alarming' pollution on some trains | work = Chicago Tribune | last = Hawthorne | first = Michael | date = February 14, 2011 | accessdate = 2011-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This would mean that diesel locomotives would be releasing more than 800,000 tons of nitrogen oxide and 25,000 tons of soot every year within a quarter of a century, in contrast to the EPA's previous projections of 480,000 tons of [[nitrogen dioxide]] and 12,000 tons of soot. Since this was discovered, to reduce the effects of the diesel locomotive on [[human]]s (who are breathing the noxious emissions) and on [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, it is considered practical to install traps in the diesel engines to reduce pollution levels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://topnews.us/content/238438-study-installed-traps-diesel-engines-reduce-pollution-levels | title = Study: Installed Traps In Diesel Engines Reduce Pollution Levels | work = Top News | last = Wilkins | first = Davell | date = 2011-04-13 | accessdate = 2011-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other forms (e.g., use of [[biodiesel]]).

Diesel locomotive pollution has been of particular concern in the city of [[Chicago]]. The ''Chicago Tribune'' reported levels of diesel soot inside locomotives leaving Chicago at levels hundreds of times above what is normally found on streets outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.myfoxchicago.com/dpp/news/metro/metra-train-cars-pollution-soot-worse-report-20110214 | title = Pollution on Metra Trains Worse Than Thought: Report | work = Fox Chicago News | date = 2011-02-14 | accessdate = 2011-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents of several neighborhoods are most likely exposed to diesel emissions at levels several times higher than the national average for urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/22/us/22cnccarbon.html | title = Black Carbon Testing Finds High Levels | work = The New York Times | last = Lydersen | first = Kari | date = April 21, 2011 | accessdate = August 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mitigation===
In 2008, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) mandated regulations requiring all new or refurbished diesel locomotives to meet [[Not-To-Exceed|Tier II]] pollution standards that slash the amount of allowable soot by 90% and require an 80% reduction in [[nitrogen oxide]] emissions. ''See''  [[List of low emissions locomotives]].

Other technologies that are being deployed to reduce locomotive emissions and fuel consumption include "Genset" switching locomotives and hybrid [[Green Goat]] designs. Genset locomotives use multiple smaller high-speed diesel engines and generators (generator sets), rather than a single medium-speed diesel engine and a single generator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.northeastdiesel.org/pdf/low-emissions-switcher-012206.pdf| format=PDF| title=Multi-Engine GenSet Ultra Low Emissions Road-Switcher Locomotive| publisher=National Railway Equipment Company| accessdate=2012-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the cost of developing clean engines, these smaller high-speed engines are based on already developed truck engines. Green Goats are a type of [[Hybrid train|hybrid]] switching locomotive utilizing a small diesel engine and a large bank of rechargeable batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.railpower.com/products_hl.html | accessdate = 2012-06-03 | title = Railpower Technologies Products| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080114062221/http://www.railpower.com/products_hl.html| archivedate = January 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trainweb.org/gensets/railpower.html RJ Corman Railpower Genset &amp; Hybrid Switchers]. Trainweb.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Switching locomotives are of particular concern as they typically operate in a limited area, often in or near urban centers, and spend much of their time idling. Both designs reduce pollution below EPA Tier II standards and cut or eliminate emissions during idle.

==Diesel's advantages over steam==
As diesel locomotives advanced, the cost of manufacturing and operating them dropped, and they became cheaper to own and operate than steam locomotives. In North America, [[steam locomotive]]s were custom-made for specific railway routes, so economies of scale were difficult to achieve.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=10}} Though more complex to produce with exacting manufacturing tolerances ({{convert|1/10000|in|adj=on|disp=or}} for diesel, compared with {{convert|1/100|in|adj=on}} for steam), diesel locomotive parts were easier to mass produce. [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] offered almost five hundred steam models in its heyday, while [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] offered fewer than ten diesel varieties.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=19}}. In the United Kingdom, [[British Railways]] built steam locomotives to standard designs from 1951 onwards. These included standard, interchangeable parts, and were cheaper to produce than the diesel locomotives then available. The capital cost per [[Tractive force|drawbar horse power]] was £13 6s (steam), £65 (diesel), £69 7s (turbine) and £17 13s (electric).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=Railway Magazine |date=January 1951 |page=60-61 |title=Standardisation and Comparative Costs of Motive Power on B.R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diesel locomotives offer significant operating advantages over steam locomotives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdrm.org/faqs/hostling.html http://www.sdrm.org/faqs/hostling.html], Phil Jern "How to Boot a Steam Locomotive" (1990) San Diego Railroad Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; They can safely be operated by one person, making them ideal for switching/shunting duties in yards (although for safety reasons many main-line diesel locomotives continue to have 2-man crews: an engineer and a conductor/switchman) and the operating environment is much more attractive, being quieter, fully weatherproof and without the dirt and heat that is an inevitable part of operating a steam locomotive. Diesel locomotives can be worked [[multiple working|in multiple]] with a single crew controlling multiple locomotives in a single train — something not practical with steam locomotives. This brought greater efficiencies to the operator, as individual locomotives could be relatively low-powered for use as a single unit on light duties but marshaled together to provide the power needed on a heavy train. With steam traction a single very powerful and expensive locomotive was required for the heaviest trains or the operator resorted to [[double heading]] with multiple locomotives and crews, a method which was also expensive and brought with it its own operating difficulties.

Diesel engines can be started and stopped almost instantly, meaning that a diesel locomotive has the potential to incur no fuel costs when not being used. However, it is still the practice of large North American railroads to use straight water as a coolant in diesel engines instead of coolants that incorporate anti-freezing properties; this results in diesel locomotives being left idling when parked in cold climates instead of being completely shut down. A diesel engine can be left idling unattended for hours or even days, especially since practically every diesel engine used in locomotives has systems that automatically shut the engine down if problems such as a loss of oil pressure or coolant loss occur. IAutomatic start/stop systems are available which monitor coolant and engine temperatures. When he unit is close to having its coolant freeze, the system restarts the diesel engine to warm the coolant and other systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ztr.com/smartstart.php SmartStart® IIe - Automatic Engine Start/Stop System]. Ztr.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steam locomotives require intensive maintenance, lubrication, and cleaning before, during, and after use. Preparing and firing a steam locomotive for use from cold can take many hours. They can be kept in readiness between uses with a low fire, but this requires regular stoking and frequent attention to maintain the level of water in the boiler. This may be necessary to prevent the water in the boiler freezing in cold climates, so long as the water supply itself is not frozen.

The maintenance and operational costs of steam locomotives were much higher than diesels. Annual maintenance costs for steam locomotives accounted for 25% of the initial purchase price. Spare parts were cast from wooden masters for specific locomotives. The sheer number of unique steam locomotives meant that there was no feasible way for spare-part inventories to be maintained.{{sfn|Churella|1998|pp=12-17}} With diesel locomotives spare parts could be mass-produced and held in stock ready for use and many parts and sub-assemblies could be standardized across an operator's fleet using different models of locomotive from the same builder. Modern diesel locomotives are designed to allow the power assemblies the be replaced, which greatly reduces the time that a locomotive is out of revenue-generating service when it requires maintenance.&lt;ref name="Kettering" /&gt;

Steam engines required large quantities of coal and water, which were expensive variable operating costs.&lt;ref name="Stover 213"&gt;Stover, 213&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the [[thermal efficiency]] of steam was considerably less than that of diesel engines. Diesel's theoretical studies demonstrated potential thermal efficiencies for a compression ignition engine of 36% (compared with 6–10% for steam), and an 1897 one-cylinder prototype operated at a remarkable 26% efficiency.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=14}}

However, one study published in 1959 suggested that many of the comparisons between diesel and steam locomotives were made unfairly mostly because diesels were newer. After painstaking analysis of financial records and technological progress, the author found that if research had continued on steam technology instead of diesel, there would be negligible financial benefit in converting to diesel locomotion.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, H. F. (1959). Economic results of diesel electric motive power on the railways in the United States. ''Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, 175''(1), 257-317. doi:10.1243/PIME_PROC_1961_175_025_02&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1960s, diesel locomotives had effectively replaced steam locomotives where electric traction was not in use.&lt;ref name="Stover 213"/&gt; Attempts to develop [[advanced steam technology]] continue in the 21st century but have not made a significant impact.

'''Domsjö Fabriker''' is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Refining|refinery]] located in [[Örnsköldsvik]] that converts raw forest materials into specialty [[cellulose]], [[lignin]], and [[bio-ethanol]]. In 2000 it was spun off from the forest company [[Mo och Domsjö AB]] (MoDo), of which it had been a part since the early 20th century, and sold to a private consortium. On April 18, 2011, it was announced that [[India]]'s [[Aditya Birla Group]] had acquired the company for US$340 million.

The push and pull between energy independence/nationalism and appeasement of conservationist groups (representing the concerns of environmentalists and indigenous groups) has been evident in the country’s shifting stance on renewable energies and fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Refinery of the Pacific Eloy Alfaro ==
In 2016, oil made up 30% of Ecuador's total exports at a value $5.05 billion; it ranked as the 55th largest oil exporter in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/ecu/|title=OEC-Ecuador (ECU) Exports, Imports, and Trade Partners|last=|first=|date=|website=atlas.media.mit.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having three small refineries in the Esmeraldas, Shushufundi, and La Libertad sites operated by Petroecuador, the country lacks the ability to refine heavy crude.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As such, Ecuador is a net importer of refined fuels, buying mainly from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/28102012-ecuador-energy-profile-leading-source-of-crude-oil-imports-for-the-us-west-coast-analysis/|title=Ecuador Energy Profile: Leading Source Of Crude Oil Imports For The US West Coast – Analysis|date=2012-10-28|work=Eurasia Review|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Refinery of the Pacific Eloy Alfaro (RDP), a petrochemical company with a compound currently under development, would allow Ecuador to refine up to 300,000 barrels/day once fully operational. The company is owned by Petroecuador, [[PDVSA|Petroleos de Venezuela SA]], and the [[China National Petroleum Corporation]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The project is estimated to cost $12 billion and return $3 billion/year that would otherwise be spent on refined fuels. It is being constructed in El Aromo, in the coastal province of [[Manabí Province|Manabi]]. Completion of the refinery would take place in two phases, the first yielding a processing capacity of 200,000 barrels/day and the second adding another 100,000 barrels/day. 

The necessary access roads and central camp were completed in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hydrocarbons-technology.com/projects/pacfico-eloy-alfaro-refinery-and-petrochemical-complex/|title=Pacífico Eloy Alfaro Refinery and Petrochemical Complex - Hydrocarbons Technology|work=Hydrocarbons Technology|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the company announced the completion of the La Esperanza Multipurpose Aqueduct, a prerequisite project that would supply the refinery with water necessary for its processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bnamericas.com/company-profile/en/refineria-del-pacifico-eloy-alfaro-rdp-cem-refineria-del-pacifico|title=Refinería Del Pacífico Eloy Alfaro RDP-CEM (Refinería Del Pacífico) - BNamericas|work=BNamericas|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a current investment sum of $1.23 billion from Petroecuador, the venture has seen financing setback.

Sumak kawsay describes the state's harmony with its different ethnic cultures and natural environments. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Energy Sovereignty ==
Ecuador’s 20th constitution (established in 2008) mentions multiple forms of sovereignty, including energy sovereignty. Self-sufficiency is one of the pillars of energy sovereignty as discussed by former President Rafael Correa’s administration. The administration called for the following objectives:

1.) an increase in the capacity for extracting natural resources

2.) a decrease in the imports of processed fuels

3.) a shift in electricity generation towards hydropower facilities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitz-Henry|first=Erin|date=2015-07-01|title=Greening the Petrochemical State: Between Energy Sovereignty and Sumak Kawsay in Coastal Ecuador|journal=The Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=264–284|doi=10.1111/jlca.12148|issn=1935-4940}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another pillar of energy sovereignty previously discussed by the administration is the defense of natural resources against international energy companies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The change in energy imports does not reflect the original proposal. Since 2008, Ecuador has more than doubled its imports of gasoline/diesel (1.494M tonnes/year to 3.175M tonnes/year) while less than halving its imports of fuel oil (531K tonnes/year to 286K tonnes/year).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/countries/non-membercountries/ecuador/|title=Ecuador|website=www.iea.org|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contribution of hydropower to electricity, however, does meet the originally proposed plan. It has risen since 2008 (back then at 11,294 GWh), while the electricity generated from oil has decreased (from 5,554 GWh).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ecuador has also increased oil production and exportation. In July 2017, the country announced it would keep increasing exports, publicly breaking rank with OPEC. The organization had promised to lower overall barrel production as global oil prices plummeted. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-18/ecuador-plans-higher-oil-output-missing-opec-cut-commitment|title=An OPEC Country Breaks Ranks and Increases Oil Output|date=2017-07-18|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has also been described as [[luminescence]] intermittency.&lt;ref name="Krauss" /&gt;
Similar behavior has been observed in crystals made of other materials. For example, porous silicon also exhibits this affect.&lt;ref name=Krauss/&gt;

==Colloidal nanocrystals==

Colloidal nanocrystals are a new class of [[optics|optical material]]s that essentially constitute a new form of matter that can be considered as "artificial atoms." Like atoms, they have discrete optical [[energy spectra]] that are tunable over a wide range of wavelengths. The desired behavior and transmission directly correlates to their size. To change the emitted wavelength, the crystal is grown larger or smaller. Their electronic and optical properties can be controlled by this method. For example, to change the emission from one visible wavelength to another simply use a larger or smaller grown crystal. However, this process would not be effective in conventional [[semiconductors]] such as [[gallium arsenide]].&lt;ref name=cartwright&gt;

The nanocrystal size controls a widely tunable [[absorption band]] resulting in widely tunable [[emission spectra]]. This tunability combined with the optical stability of nanocrystals and the great chemical flexibility in the nanocrystal growth have resulted in the widespread nanocrystal applications in use today. Practical device applications range from [[laser|low-threshold lasers]] to [[solar cells]] and [[superlens|biological imaging]] and tracking.&lt;ref name=blink-nrl/&gt;&lt;ref name=bruchez&gt;

The missing 30% efficiency turns out to be an intrinsic property of nanocrystals.&lt;ref name=wang/&gt;

==Random behavior==
[[File:Core-shell np pic.png|thumb|right|A representation of core-shell nanocrystals]]

Studies of single colloidal nanocrystals show that they randomly turn their [[photoluminescence]] on and off even under continuous light illumination.
This tends to hinder progress for engineers and scientists who study single colloidal nanocrystals and try to use their [[fluorescence|fluorescent properties]] for biological imaging or [[laser|lasing]].&lt;ref name=blink-nrl/&gt;&lt;ref name=wang/&gt;

The blinking in nanocrystals was first reported in 1996. The discovery was unexpected. The consensus is that blinking happens because illuminated nanocrystals can be charged (or [[ionize]]d), and then neutralized. Under normal conditions when nanocrystal is neutral, a [[photon]] excites an [[electron-hole pair]], which then recombines, emitting another photon and leading to photoluminescence. This process is called [[radiative recombination]]. If however, the nanocrystal is charged, the extra carrier triggers a process called non-radiative [[Auger recombination]], where exciton energy is transferred to an extra electron or hole. Auger recombination occurs orders of magnitude faster than the radiative recombination. So photoluminescence is almost entirely suppressed in charged nanocrystals. Scientists still do not fully understand the origin of the charging and neutralization process. One of the photoexcited carriers (the electron or the hole) must be ejected from the nanocrystal. At some later time, the ejected charge returns to the nanocrystal (restoring charge neutrality and therefore radiative recombination). The details of how these processes occur still are not understood.&lt;ref name=blink-nrl/&gt;&lt;ref name=wang/&gt;

==Solutions==
Researchers are attempting to eliminate the problem of blinking nanocrystals. One common solution is to suppress nanocrystal ionization. This could be done, for example, by growing a very thick semiconductor shell around the nanocrystal core. However, blinking was reduced, not eliminated, because the fundamental processes responsible for blinking - the non-radiative Auger recombination- were still present.&lt;ref name=blink-nrl&gt;

In [[petroleum]] exploration and development, '''formation evaluation''' is used to determine the ability of a borehole to produce [[petroleum]].  Essentially, it is the process of "recognizing a commercial well when you drill one".

Modern rotary drilling usually uses a heavy mud as a lubricant and as a means of producing a confining pressure against the formation face in the borehole, preventing blowouts.  Only in rare and catastrophic cases, do oil and gas wells ''come in'' with a fountain of gushing oil.  In real life, that is a ''[[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]]''&amp;mdash;and usually also a financial and environmental disaster.  But controlling blowouts has drawbacks&amp;mdash;mud filtrate soaks into the formation around the borehole and a mud cake plasters the sides of the hole.  These factors obscure the possible presence of oil or gas in even very porous formations. Further complicating the problem is the widespread occurrence of small amounts of petroleum in the rocks of many [[sedimentary]] provinces.  In fact, if a sedimentary province is absolutely barren of traces of petroleum, it is not feasible to continue drilling there.

The formation evaluation problem is a matter of answering two questions:
#What are the lower limits for porosity, permeability and upper limits for water saturation that permit profitable production from a particular formation or pay zone; in a particular geographic area; in a particular economic climate.
#Do any of the formations in the well under consideration exceed these lower limits.

It is complicated by the impossibility of directly examining the formation. It is, in short, the problem of looking at the formation ''indirectly''.

==Formation evaluation tools==

{{further|Well logging}}
Tools to detect oil and gas have been evolving for over a century. The simplest and most direct tool is [[well cuttings]] examination.  Some older oilmen ground the cuttings between their teeth and tasted to see if crude oil was present. Today, a wellsite geologist or mudlogger uses a low powered stereoscopic [[microscope]] to determine the [[lithology]] of the formation being drilled and to estimate porosity and possible oil staining.  A portable [[ultraviolet]] light chamber or "Spook Box" is used to examine the cuttings for [[fluorescence]].  Fluorescence can be an indication of crude oil staining, or of the presence of fluorescent minerals.  They can be differentiated by placing the cuttings in a solvent filled watchglass or dimple dish.  The solvent is usually [[carbon tetrachlorethane]].  Crude oil dissolves and then redeposits as a fluorescent ring when the solvent evaporates.  The written strip chart recording of these examinations is called a sample log or mudlog.

Well cuttings examination is a learned skill.  During drilling, chips of rock, usually less than about 1/8&amp;nbsp;inch (6&amp;nbsp;mm) across, are cut from the bottom of the hole by the bit.  Mud, jetting out of holes in the bit under high pressure, washes the cuttings away and up the hole.  During their trip to the surface they may circulate around the turning drillpipe, mix with cuttings falling back down the hole, mix with fragments caving from the hole walls and mix with cuttings travelling faster and slower in the same upward direction.  They then are screened out of the mudstream by the [[shale shaker]] and fall on a pile at its base.  Determining the type of rock being drilled at any one time is a matter of knowing the 'lag time' between a chip being cut by the bit and the time it reaches the surface where it is then examined by the wellsite geologist (or [[mudlogger]] as they are sometimes called). A sample of the cuttings taken at the proper time will contain the current cuttings in a mixture of previously drilled material.  Recognizing them can be very difficult at times, for example after a "bit trip" when a couple of miles of drill pipe has been extracted and returned to the hole in order to replace a dull bit.  At such a time there is a flood of foreign material knocked from the borehole walls (cavings), making the mudloggers task all the more difficult.

===Coring===

One way to get more detailed samples of a formation is by coring.  Two techniques commonly used at present.  The first is the "whole core", a cylinder of rock, usually about 3" to 4" in diameter and up to {{convert|50|ft|m}} to {{convert|60|ft|m}} long.  It is cut with a "core barrel", a hollow pipe tipped with a ring-shaped diamond chip-studded bit that can cut a plug and bring it to the surface.  Often the plug breaks while drilling, usually in shales or fractures and the core barrel jams, slowly grinding the rocks in front of it to powder.  This signals the driller to give up on getting a full length core and to pull up the pipe.

Taking a full core is an expensive operation that usually stops or slows drilling for at least the better part of a day.  A full core can be invaluable for later reservoir evaluation.  Once a section of well has been drilled, there is, of course, no way to core it without drilling another well.

Another, cheaper, technique for obtaining samples of the formation is "[[Sidewall Coring]]".  One type of sidewall cores is percussion cores.  In this method, a steel cylinder&amp;mdash;a coring gun&amp;mdash;has hollow-point steel bullets mounted along its sides and moored to the gun by short steel cables.  The coring gun is lowered to the bottom of the interval of interest and the bullets are fired individually as the gun is pulled up the hole.  The mooring cables ideally pull the hollow bullets and the enclosed plug of formation loose and the gun carries them to the surface.  Advantages of this technique are low cost and the ability to sample the formation after it has been drilled.  Disadvantages are possible non-recovery because of lost or misfired bullets and a slight uncertainty about the sample depth.  Sidewall cores are often shot "on the run" without stopping at each core point because of the danger of differential sticking.  Most service company personnel are skilled enough to minimize this problem, but it can be significant if depth accuracy is important.

A second method of sidewall coring is rotary sidewall cores.  In this method, a circular-saw assembly is lowered to the zone of interest on a wireline, and the core is sawed out.  Dozens of cores may be taken this way in one run.  This method is roughly 20 times as expensive as percussion cores, but yields a much better sample.

A serious problem with cores is the change they undergo as they are brought to the surface.  It might seem that cuttings and cores are very direct samples but the problem is whether the formation at depth will produce oil or gas.  Sidewall cores are deformed and compacted and fractured by the bullet impact.  Most full cores from any significant depth expand and fracture as they are brought to the surface and removed from the core barrel.  Both types of core can be invaded or even flushed by mud, making the evaluation of formation fluids difficult.  The formation analyst has to remember that all tools give indirect data.

===Mud logging===

Mud logging (or Wellsite Geology) is a [[well logging]] process in which [[drilling mud]] and drill bit cuttings from the formation are evaluated during drilling and their properties recorded on a strip chart as a visual analytical tool and stratigraphic cross sectional representation of the well. The [[drilling mud]] which is analyzed for [[hydrocarbon]] gases, by use of a [[gas chromatograph]], contains drill bit cuttings which are visually evaluated by a mudlogger and then described in the mud log.  The total gas, chromatograph record, lithological sample, pore pressure, shale density,D-exponent, etc. (all lagged parameters because they are circulated up to the surface from the bit) are plotted along with surface parameters such as rate of penetration (ROP), Weight On Bit (WOB),rotation per minute etc. on the mudlog which serve as a tool for the [[mudlogger]], drilling engineers, [[mud engineer]]s, and other service personnel charged with drilling and producing the well.

===Wireline logging===

The oil and gas industry uses wireline logging to obtain a continuous record of a formation's rock properties. Wireline logging can be defined as being "The acquisition and analysis of geophysical data performed as a function of well bore depth, together with the provision of related services." Note that "wireline logging" and "mud logging" are not the same, yet are closely linked through the integration of the data sets. The measurements are made referenced to "TAH" - True Along Hole depth: these and the associated analysis can then be used to infer further properties, such as hydrocarbon saturation and formation pressure, and to make further drilling and production decisions.

Wireline logging is performed by lowering a 'logging tool' - or a string of one or more instruments - on the end of a wireline into an oil well (or borehole) and recording petrophysical properties using a variety of sensors. Logging tools developed over the years measure the natural gamma ray, electrical, acoustic, stimulated radioactive responses, electromagnetic, nuclear magnetic resonance, pressure and other properties of the rocks and their contained fluids. For this article, they are broadly broken down by the main property that they respond to.

The data itself is recorded either at surface (real-time mode), or in the hole (memory mode) to an electronic data format and then either a printed record or electronic presentation called a "well log" is provided to the client, along with an electronic copy of the raw data. Well logging operations can either be performed during the drilling process (see Logging While Drilling), to provide real-time information about the formations being penetrated by the borehole, or once the well has reached Total Depth and the whole depth of the borehole can be logged.

Real-time data is recorded directly against measured cable depth. Memory data is recorded against time, and then depth data is simultaneously measured against time. The two data sets are then merged using the common time base to create an instrument response versus depth log. Memory recorded depth can also be corrected in exactly the same way as real-time corrections are made, so there should be no difference in the attainable TAH accuracy.

The measured cable depth can be derived from a number of different measurements, but is usually either recorded based on a calibrated wheel counter, or (more accurately) using magnetic marks which provide calibrated increments of cable length. The measurements made must then be corrected for elastic stretch and temperature.[1]

There are many types of wireline logs and they can be categorized either by their function or by the technology that they use. "Open hole logs" are run before the oil or gas well is lined with pipe or cased. "Cased hole logs" are run after the well is lined with casing or production pipe.[2]

Wireline logs can be divided into broad categories based on the physical properties measured.

===Electric logs===
In 1928, the [[Schlumberger brothers]] in France developed the workhorse of all formation evaluation tools: the electric log.  Electric logs have been improved to a high degree of precision and sophistication since that time, but the basic principle has not changed.  Most underground formations contain water, often salt water, in their [[porosity|pore]]s.  The resistance to electric current of the total formation&amp;mdash;rock and fluids&amp;mdash;around the borehole is proportional to the sum of the volumetric proportions of mineral grains and conductive water-filled pore space.  If the pores are partially filled with gas or oil, which are resistant to the passage of electric current, the bulk formation resistance is higher than for water filled pores.  For the sake of a convenient comparison from measurement to measurement, the electrical logging tools measure the resistance of a cubic meter of formation.  This measurement is called ''resistivity''.

Modern [[resistivity logging]] tools fall into two categories, Laterolog and Induction, with various commercial names, depending on the company providing the logging services.

Laterolog tools send an electric current from an electrode on the sonde directly into the formation.  The return electrodes are located either on surface or on the sonde itself.  Complex arrays of electrodes on the sonde (guard electrodes) focus the current into the formation and prevent current lines from fanning out or flowing directly to the return electrode through the borehole fluid.  Most tools vary the voltage at the main electrode in order to maintain a constant current intensity.  This voltage is therefore proportional to the resistivity of the formation.  Because current must flow from the sonde to the formation, these tools only work with conductive borehole fluid.  Actually, since the resistivity of the mud is measured in series with the resistivity of the formation, laterolog tools give best results when mud resistivity is low with respect to formation resistivity, i.e., in salty mud.
   
Induction logs use an electric coil in the sonde to generate an alternating current loop in the formation by induction.  This is the same physical principle as is used in electric transformers.  The alternating current loop, in turn, induces a current in a receiving coil located elsewhere on the sonde.  The amount of current in the receiving coil is proportional to the intensity of current loop, hence to the conductivity (reciprocal of resistivity) of the formation.  Multiple transmitting and receiving coils are used to focus formation current loops both radially (depth of investigation) and axially (vertical resolution).  Until the late 80’s, the workhorse of induction logging has been the 6FF40 sonde which is made up of six coils with a nominal spacing of {{convert|40|in|mm}}.  Since the 90’s all major logging companies use so-called array induction tools.  These comprise a single transmitting coil and a large number of receiving coils.  Radial and axial focusing is performed by software rather than by the physical layout of coils.  Since the formation current flows in circular loops around the logging tool, mud resistivity is measured in parallel with formation resistivity.  Induction tools therefore give best results when mud resistivity is high with respect to formation resistivity, i.e., fresh mud or non-conductive fluid.   In oil-base mud, which is non conductive, induction logging is the only option available.

Until the late 1950s electric logs, mud logs and sample logs comprised most of the oilman's armamentarium.  Logging tools to measure porosity and permeability began to be used at that time.  The first was the microlog.  This was a miniature electric log with two sets of electrodes.  One measured the formation resistivity about 1/2" deep and the other about 1"-2" deep.  The purpose of this seemingly pointless measurement was to detect permeability.  Permeable sections of a borehole wall develop a thick layer of mudcake during drilling.  Mud liquids, called filtrate, soak into the formation, leaving the mud solids behind to -ideally- seal the wall and stop the filtrate "invasion" or soaking.  The short depth electrode of the microlog sees mudcake in permeable sections.  The deeper 1" electrode sees filtrate invaded formation.  In nonpermeable sections both tools read alike and the traces fall on top of each other on the stripchart log.  In permeable sections they separate.

Also in the late 1950s porosity measuring logs were being developed.  The two main types are: nuclear porosity logs and sonic logs.

===Porosity logs===
The two main nuclear porosity logs are the Density and the Neutron log.

Density logging tools contain a [[caesium-137]] [[gamma ray]] source which irradiates the formation with 662&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|keV]] gamma rays. These gamma rays interact with electrons in the formation through [[Compton scattering]] and lose energy. Once the energy of the gamma ray has fallen below 100&amp;nbsp;keV, photolectric absorption dominates: gamma rays are eventually absorbed by the formation. The amount of energy loss by Compton scattering is related to the number electrons per unit volume of formation. Since for most elements of interest (below Z = 20) the ratio of atomic weight, A, to atomic number, Z, is close to 2, gamma ray energy loss is related to the amount of matter per unit volume, i.e., formation density.

A gamma ray detector located some distance from the source, detects surviving gamma rays and sorts them into several energy windows. The number of high-energy gamma rays is controlled by compton scattering, hence by formation density. The number of low-energy gamma rays is controlled by photoelectric absorption, which is directly related to the average atomic number, Z, of the formation, hence to [[lithology]]. Modern density logging tools include two or three detectors, which allow compensation for some borehole effects, in particular for the presence of mud cake between the tool and the formation.

Since there is a large contrast between the density of the minerals in the formation and the density of pore fluids, porosity can easily be derived from measured formation bulk density if both mineral and fluid densities are known.

Neutron porosity logging tools contain an [[americium]]-[[beryllium]] [[neutron]] source, which irradiates the formation with neutrons. These neutrons lose energy through elastic collisions with nuclei in the formation.  Once their energy has decreased to thermal level, they diffuse randomly away from the source and are ultimately absorbed by a nucleus. Hydrogen atoms have essentially the same mass as the neutron; therefore hydrogen is the main contributor to the slowing down of neutrons.  A detector at some distance from the source records the number of neutron reaching this point. Neutrons that have been slowed down to thermal level have a high probability of being absorbed by the formation before reaching the detector. The neutron counting rate is therefore inversely related to the amount of hydrogen in the formation. Since hydrogen is mostly present in pore fluids (water, hydrocarbons) the count rate can be converted into apparent porosity. Modern neutron logging tools usually include two detectors to compensate for some borehole effects. Porosity is derived from the ratio of count rates at these two detectors rather than from count rates at a single detector.

The combination of neutron and density logs takes advantage of the fact that lithology has opposite effects on these two porosity measurements.  The average of neutron and density porosity values is usually close to the true porosity, regardless of lithology.  Another advantage of this combination is the "gas effect."  Gas, being less dense than liquids, translates into a density-derived porosity that is too high.  Gas, on the other hand, has much less hydrogen per unit volume than liquids: neutron-derived porosity, which is based on the amount of hydrogen, is too low.  If both logs are displayed on compatible scales, they overlay each other in liquid-filled clean formations and are widely separated in gas-filled formations.

Sonic logs use a pinger and microphone arrangement to measure the velocity of sound in the formation from one end of the sonde to the other.  For a given type of rock, acoustic velocity varies indirectly with porosity. If the velocity of sound through solid rock is taken as a measurement of 0% porosity, a slower velocity is an indication of a higher porosity that is usually filled with formation water with a slower sonic velocity.

Both sonic and density-neutron logs give porosity as their primary information.  Sonic logs read farther away from the borehole so they are more useful where sections of the borehole are caved.  Because they read deeper, they also tend to average more formation than the density-neutron logs do.  Modern sonic configurations with pingers and microphones at both ends of the log, combined with computer analysis, minimize the averaging somewhat.  Averaging is an advantage when the formation is being evaluated for seismic parameters, a different area of formation evaluation.  A special log, the Long Spaced Sonic, is sometimes used for this purpose.  Seismic signals (a single undulation of a sound wave in the earth) average together tens to hundreds of feet of formation, so an averaged sonic log is more directly comparable to a seismic waveform.

Density-neutron logs read the formation within about four to seven inches (178&amp;nbsp;mm)  of the borehole wall.  This is an advantage in resolving thin beds.  It is a disadvantage when the hole is badly caved.  Corrections can be made automatically if the cave is no more than a few inches deep.  A caliper arm on the sonde measures the profile of the borehole and a correction is calculated and incorporated in the porosity reading.  However, if the cave is much more than four inches deep, the density-neutron log is reading little more than drilling mud.

===Lithology logs - SP and gamma ray===
There are two other tools, the SP log and the Gamma Ray log, one or both of which are almost always used in wireline logging.  Their output is usually presented along with the electric and porosity logs described above.  They are indispensable as additional guides to the nature of the rock around the borehole.

The SP log, known variously as a "Spontaneous Potential", "Self Potential" or "Shale Potential" log is a voltmeter measurement of the voltage or electrical potential difference between the mud in the hole at a particular depth and a copper ground stake driven into the surface of the earth a short distance from the borehole.  A salinity difference between the drilling mud and the formation water acts as a natural battery and will cause several voltage effects.  This "battery" causes a movement of charged ions between the hole and the formation water where there is enough permeability in the rock.  The most important voltage is set up as a permeable formation permits ion movement, reducing the voltage between the formation water and the mud.  Sections of the borehole where this occurs then have a voltage difference with other nonpermeable sections where ion movement is restricted.  Vertical ion movement in the mud column occurs much more slowly because the mud is not circulating while the drill pipe is out of the hole.  The copper surface stake provides a reference point against which the SP voltage is measured for each part of the borehole.  There can also be several other minor voltages, due for example to mud filtrate streaming into the formation under the effect of an overbalanced mud system.  This flow carries ions and is a voltage generating current.  These other voltages are secondary in importance  to the voltage resulting from the salinity contrast between mud and formation water.

The nuances of the SP log are still being researched.  In theory, almost all porous rocks contain water.  Some pores are completely filled with water.  Others have a thin layer of water molecules wetting the surface of the rock, with gas or oil filling the rest of the pore.  In sandstones and porous limestones there is a continuous layer of water throughout the formation.  If there is even a little permeability to water, ions can move through the rock and decrease the voltage difference with the mud nearby.  Shales do not allow water or ion movement.  Although they may have a large water content, it is bound to the surface of the flat clay crystals comprising the shale.  Thus mud opposite shale sections maintains its voltage difference with the surrounding rock.  As the SP logging tool is drawn up the hole it measures the voltage difference between the reference stake and the mud opposite shale and sandstone or limestone sections.  The resulting log curve reflects the permeability of the rocks and, indirectly, their lithology.  SP curves degrade over time, as the ions diffuse up and down the mud column.  It also can suffer from stray voltages caused by other logging tools that are run with it.  Older, simpler logs often have better SP curves than more modern logs for this reason.  With experience in an area, a good SP curve can even allow a skilled interpreter to infer [[Sedimentary depositional environment|sedimentary environments]] such as deltas, point bars or offshore tidal deposits.

The gamma ray log is a measurement of naturally occurring gamma radiation from the borehole walls.  Sandstones are usually nonradioactive quartz and limestones are nonradioactive calcite.  Shales however, are naturally radioactive due to potassium isotopes in clays, and adsorbed uranium and thorium.  Thus the presence or absence of gamma rays in a borehole is an indication of the amount of shale or clay in the surrounding formation.  The gamma ray log is useful in holes drilled with air or with oil based muds, as these wells have no SP voltage.  Even in water-based muds, the gamma ray and SP logs are often run together.  They comprise a check on each other and can indicate unusual shale sections which may either not be radioactive, or may have an abnormal ionic chemistry.  The gamma ray log is also useful to detect coal beds, which, depending on the local geology, can have either low radiation levels, or high radiation levels due to adsorption of uranium.  In addition, the gamma ray log will work inside a steel casing, making it essential when a cased well must be evaluated.

==Interpreting the tools==

The immediate questions that have to be answered in deciding to complete a well or to plug and abandon (P&amp;A) it are:
*Do any zones in the well contain producible hydrocarbons?
*How much?
*How much, if any, water will be produced with them?

The elementary approach to answering these questions uses the [[Archie's law|Archie Equation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3963">A '''hayrake table''' is a distinct pattern of [[table (furniture)|table]] produced as part of the English [[Arts and Crafts movement]] in the early part of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its distinctive feature is the arrangement of the lower [[stretcher (furniture)|stretcher]] between the legs as a double-ended Y-shape. The shape of each end, and their [[Joinery (woodworking)|joinery]], was based on traditional English craft woodworking and the construction of wooden [[hay rake]]s. The stretcher is not merely a simple Y shape, but its junction is braced by a T-shaped joint, as was needed for the work of a rake. Some modern reproductions simplify this to a plain Y, abandoning the design's original roots.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

These tables are best known as the work of [[Ernest Gimson]]&lt;ref name="FWW, " &gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his associates the [[Barnsley brothers]]&lt;ref name="FWW, 2012" /&gt; and [[Peter Waals]]&lt;ref name="Gloag, Waals" &gt;{{harvnb|Gloag|1925|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; at their Daneway workshops in [[Sapperton, Gloucestershire]]. Other Arts and Crafts designers of the period also produced them, particularly those in the [[Cotswolds]] such as [[Sydney Gordon Russell|Gordon Russell]]&lt;ref name="Gloag, Russell" &gt;{{harvnb|Gloag|1925|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timber used in their construction was, as for other Arts and Crafts work, locally-grown English hardwoods. Most were produced in [[Quercus alba|oak]] although some, like the original hay rakes, were made in [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash]].

The design varies between makers, mostly in its details. Gimson's tables are considered the finest and the canonical example of the design.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Their edges are heavily [[chamfer]]ed, a typically Gimson feature, which is derived from the finishing of the original agricultural tools. This chamfer also has the practical benefit for a table stretcher of reduced wear from feet on an otherwise sharp edge. Gimson's distinctive use of gentle [[stopped chamfer]]s evokes the framing of Gloucestershire wagons. Gimson's tables also have their edges finished with bands of [[chip carving]] or sometimes with [[inlay|inlaid]] bands of light [[holly]] and dark [[bog oak]].&lt;ref name="Vickers" &gt;{{Cite web

Although less well-known than some other iconic Arts and Crafts pieces, the hayrake table remains a popular design to this day. They are produced both commercially&lt;ref name="Vickers" /&gt; and as plans for hobbyists.&lt;ref name="FWW, 2012" &gt;{{Cite journal

== Continuous heteroazeotropic distillation ==
Heterogeneous distillation means that during the distillation the liquid phase of the mixture is immiscible.
In this case on the plates can be two liquid phases and the top vapour condensate splits in two liquid phases, which can be separated in a decanter.
The simplest case of continuous heteroazeotropic distillation is the separation of a binary heterogeneous azeotropic mixture. In this case the system contains two columns and a decanter. The fresh feed (A-B) is added into the first column. (The feed may also be added into the decanter directly or into the second column depending on the composition of the mixture). From the decanter the A-rich phase is withdrawn as reflux into the first column while the B-rich phase is withdrawn as reflux into the second column. This mean the first column produces "A" and the second column produces "B" as a bottoms product. In the industry the butanol-water mixture is separated with this technique.

[[Image:conti hetero 1.png]]

At the previous case the binary system forms already a heterogeneous azeotrope. The other application of the heteroazeotropic distillation is the separation of a binary system (A-B) forming a homogeneous azeotrope. In this case an entrainer or solvent is added to the mixture in order to form an heteroazeotrope with one or both of the components in order to help the separation of the original A-B mixture.

== Batch heteroazeotropic distillation ==
Batch heteroazeotropic distillation is an efficient method for the separation of azeotropic and
low relative volatility (low α) mixtures. A third component (entrainer, E) is added to the
binary A-B mixture, which makes the separation of A and B possible. The entrainer forms a
heteroazeotrope with at least one (and preferably with only one (selective entrainer)) of the
original components.
The main parts of the conventional batch distillation columns are the following:
- pot (include reboiler)
- column
- condenser to condense the top vapour
- product receivers
- (entrainer fed)
In case of the heteroazeotropic distillation the equipment is completed with a decanter, where the two liquid phases are split.

[[Image:bhad column.png]]

Three different cases are possible for the addition of the entrainer:

1, Batch Addition of the Entrainer: The total quantity of the entrainer is added to the charge before the start of the procedure.
 
2, Continuous Entrainer Feeding: The total quantity of the entrainer is introduced continuously to the column.

3, Mixed Addition of the Entrainer: The combination of the batch addition and continuous feeding of the entrainer. We added one part of the entrainer to the charge before the start of the distillation and the other part continuously during distillation.

In the last years the batch heteroazeotropic distillation has come into prominenece so several studies have been published. The heteroazeotropic batch distillation was investigated by feasibility studies, rigorous simulation calculations and laboratory experiments. Feasibility analysis is conducted in Modla et al.&lt;ref&gt;Modla G., P. Lang, K. Molnar, ”Batch Heteroazeotropic Rectification of a Low Relative Volatility Mixture under Continuous Entrainer Feeding”, 6-th World Congress of Chemical Engineering, Melbourne, Australia, (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Modla G., P. Lang, B. Kotai and K. Molnar, ”Batch Heteroazeotropic Rectification of a Low Relative Volatility Mixture under Continuous Entrainer Feeding”, AICHE J., 49., 2533-2552 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; and Rodriguez-Donis et al.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez-Donis I., V. Gerbaud, and X. Joulia, ”Feasibility of Heterogenous Batch Distillation”, AIChE J., 48, 1168-1178, (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; for the separation of low-relative-volatility and azeotropic mixtures by heterogeneous batch distillation in a batch rectifier.

'''Hybtonite''' is trademark of [[Amroy Europe Oy]] for carbon nanoepoxy [[Synthetic resin|resins]].
It is a family of composite resins reinforced with [[carbon nanotubes]] (CNTs).

The material and the manufacturing method were originally developed in the Nanoscience Center of [[University of Jyväskylä]] during the years 2002 to 2004.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{Cite web

CNTs can then chemically react with [[epoxy]] resin or other material forming strong [[covalent bond]]s.
This results in a more durable hybrid composite structure that is between 20 and 30% stronger (with only 0.5% CNT contents) than a conventional reinforced plastic.&lt;ref name="Pagni"&gt;{{Cite web

The manufacturing process allows controlling the material properties such as [[electrical conductivity]], [[thermal conductivity]] and [[viscosity]].
Different forms of hybtonite are available for different purposes such as laminating ([[Fiberglass|glass fiber]], [[carbon fiber]]), epoxy paints and glues.

'''Indium(III) oxide''' ([[Indium|In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]][[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]) is a [[chemical compound]], an [[amphoteric]] [[oxide]] of [[indium]].

==Physical properties==

===Crystal structure===
Amorphous indium oxide is insoluble in water but soluble in acids, whereas crystalline indium oxide is insoluble in both water and acids. The crystalline form exist in two phases, the cubic ([[bixbyite]] type)&lt;ref name="Marezio1966" /&gt; and rhombohedral ([[corundum]] type). Both phases have a [[band gap]] of about 3 eV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Walsh, A|title=Nature of the Band Gap of In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Revealed by First-Principles Calculations and X-Ray Spectroscopy|pmid=18518246|display-authors=1|year=2008|last2=Da Silva|first2=JL|last3=Wei|first3=SH|last4=Körber|first4=C|last5=Klein|first5=A|last6=Piper|first6=LF|last7=Demasi|first7=A|last8=Smith|first8=KE|last9=Panaccione|first9=G|volume=100|issue=16|pages=167402|journal=Physical Review Letters|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.167402|url=http://people.bath.ac.uk/aw558/publications/2008/prl_in2o3_08.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|title=Band gap, electronic structure, and surface electron accumulation of cubic and rhombohedral In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.79.205211 |first=P.

Thin films of [[chromium]]-[[doped]] indium oxide (In&lt;sub&gt;2−x&lt;/sub&gt;Cr&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are a [[magnetic semiconductor]] displaying high-temperature [[ferromagnetism]], single-[[phase (matter)|phase]] crystal structure, and [[semiconductor]] behavior with high concentration of [[charge carrier]]s. It has possible applications in [[spintronics]] as a material for spin injectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2345/i0899-8205-40-4-267.1|url=http://news.mit.edu/2006/spintronics-0524|title=New Material Puts Its Own Spin on Electronics|journal=Biomedical Instrumentation &amp; Technology|volume=40|issue=4|pages=267|year=2006}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Thin polycrystalline films of indium oxide doped with Zn are highly conductive (conductivity ~10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; S/m) and even superconductive at helium temperatures. The superconducting transition temperature T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; depends on the doping and film structure and is below 3.3 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/1468-6996/9/4/044208 |pmid=27878025|title=Superconductivity in transparent zinc-doped In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films having low carrier density|year=2008|last1=Makise|first1=Kazumasa|last2=Kokubo|first2=Nobuhito|last3=Takada|first3=Satoshi|last4=Yamaguti|first4=Takashi|last5=Ogura|first5=Syunsuke|last6=Yamada|first6=Kazumasa|last7=Shinozaki|first7=Bunjyu|last8=Yano|first8=Koki|last9=Inoue|first9=Kazuyoshi|last10=Nakamura|first10=Hiroaki|journal=Science and Technology of Advanced Materials|volume=9|issue=4|pages=044208|display-authors=8|pmc=5099639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==
Bulk samples can be prepared by heating [[indium(III) hydroxide]] or the nitrate, carbonate or sulfate.&lt;ref name="downs"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Chemistry of aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium| author = Downs, Anthony John | publisher = Springer| year = 1993| isbn = 0-7514-0103-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thin films of indium oxide can be prepared by [[sputter deposition|sputtering]] of indium target in [[argon]]/[[oxygen]] atmosphere. They can be used as [[diffusion barrier]]s ("[[barrier metal]]s") in [[semiconductor]]s, e.g. to inhibit [[diffusion]] between [[aluminium]] and [[silicon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://authors.library.caltech.edu/2310/|title = Indium oxide diffusion barriers for Al/Si metallizations|author = Kolawa, E. and Garland, C. and Tran, L. and Nieh, C.

[[Monocrystal]]line [[nanowire]]s were synthetized from indium oxide by laser ablation, allowing precise diameter control down to 10&amp;nbsp;nm. [[Field effect transistor]]s were fabricated from those.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1196/annals.1292.007|title=Synthesis, Electronic Properties, and Applications of Indium Oxide Nanowires|year=2003|last1=Li|first1=C|last2=Zhang|first2=D|last3=Han|first3=S|last4=Liu|first4=X|last5=Tang|first5=T|last6=Lei|first6=B|last7=Liu|first7=Z|last8=Zhou|first8=C|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1006|pages=104–21|pmid=14976013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indium oxide nanowires can serve as sensitive and specific [[redox]] [[protein]] [[sensor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.foresight.org/Conferences/MNT11/Abstracts/Rouhanizadeh/index.html| title = Applying Indium Oxide Nanowires as Sensitive and Specific Redox Protein Sensors|publisher = Foresight Nanotech Institute|accessdate = 2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sol-gel]] method is another way to prepare the nanowires.

Indium oxide can serve as a [[semiconductor material]], forming [[heterojunction]]s with [[p-type semiconductor|p]]-[[indium phosphide|InP]], [[n-type semiconductor|n]]-[[gallium arsenide|GaAs]], n-[[silicon|Si]], and other materials. A layer of indium oxide on a silicon substrate can be deposited from an [[indium trichloride]] solution, a method useful for manufacture of [[solar cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Feng, Tom and Ghosh, Amal K. (1984) "Method for forming indium oxide/n-silicon heterojunction solar cells" {{US Patent| 4436765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Indium oxide is used in some types of batteries, [[thin film]] [[infrared]] reflectors transparent for visible light ([[hot mirror]]s), some [[optical coating]]s, and some [[antistatic coating]]s. In combination with [[tin dioxide]], indium oxide forms [[indium tin oxide]] (also called tin doped indium oxide or ITO), a material used for transparent conductive coatings.

In semiconductors, indium oxide can be used as an [[n-type semiconductor]] used as a [[resistor|resistive element]] in [[integrated circuit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceramic-materials.com/cermat/oxide/in2o3.html|title = In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Indium Oxide)|publisher = CeramicMaterials.info|accessdate = 2008-10-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080630082830/http://ceramic-materials.com/cermat/oxide/in2o3.html |archivedate = 2008-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[histology]], indium oxide is used as a part of some [[stain (biology)|stain]] formulations.

The '''International Petroleum Exchange''', now '''ICE Futures''' (since 2005-04-7), based in [[London]], was one of the world's largest energy [[futures exchange|futures and options exchanges]]. Its flagship commodity, ''[[Brent Crude]]'' was a world benchmark for oil prices, but the exchange also handled [[futures contract]]s and [[option (finance)|option]]s on [[fuel oil]], [[natural gas]], [[electricity]] (baseload and peakload), coal contracts and, as of 22 April 2005, [[carbon emission]] allowances with the [[European Climate Exchange]] (ECX).

The IPE was acquired by the [[Intercontinental Exchange]] in 2001. The IPE was an [[open outcry]] exchange until 7 April 2005, when its name was changed to '''ICE Futures''' and all trading was shifted onto an [[electronic trading platform]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4415905.stm "Open outcry trading to end on IPE"]. ''BBC News'', 7 April, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:International Petroleum Exchange logo.svg|thumb|100px|International Petroleum Exchange logo]]
Until the 1970s, the price of oil was relatively stable with production largely controlled by the biggest oil companies. During that decade two oil price shocks led to continued price [[volatility (finance)|volatility]] in the market; short-term physical markets evolved, and the need to hedge emerged.

A group of energy and futures companies founded the IPE in 1980, and the first contract, for gas oil futures, was launched the following year.&lt;ref name="Treat2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Elting Treat|title=Energy Futures: Trading Opportunities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FaVcwN2KmOAC&amp;pg=PA348|date=January 2000|publisher=PennWell Books|isbn=978-0-87814-752-6|pages=348–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1988, the IPE launched [[Brent Crude]] futures. 

Since its inception, oil futures and latterly options have been traded in pits on the [[Open outcry|trading floor]] using the open outcry system. As business volumes have grown, the IPE has moved location several times to accommodate new pits and more traders.

The Exchange has experienced incremental growth, year-on-year for most of its history. Complexity, but also efficiency have increased as new trading instruments such as [[swap (finance)|swap]]s, futures, and options have been developed.

==Contracts==
Since 1997, the ICE Futures has expanded its offerings from Brent Crude and Gas Oil to include Natural Gas (1997), Electricity (2004), and ECX carbon [[financial instrument]]s (2005). These expansions have allowed ICE Futures to offer a wider range of energy products. More advanced transactions are also now possible, due to cross- and multi-product transactions, which eliminate the need to use multiple markets or an adviser.

Sodium loses its outer [[electron]] to give it a stable [[electron configuration]], and this electron enters the fluorine atom [[exothermic]]ally. The oppositely charged ions &amp;ndash; typically a great many of them &amp;ndash; are then attracted to each other to form a solid.]]
'''Ionic bonding''' is a type of [[chemical bond]]ing that involves the [[Coulomb's law|electrostatic attraction]] between oppositely charged [[ion]]s, and is the primary interaction occurring in [[ionic compound]]s. It is one of the main bonds along with [[Covalent bond]] and [[Metallic bonding]]. Ions are atoms that have gained one or more [[electrons]] (known as [[anion]]s, which are negatively charged) and atoms that have lost one or more electrons (known as [[cation]]s, which are positively charged). This transfer of electrons is known as '''electrovalence''' in contrast to [[covalent bond|covalence]]. In the simplest case, the cation is a [[metal]] atom and the anion is a [[nonmetal]] atom, but these ions can be of a more complex nature, e.g. molecular ions like {{chem|NH|4|+}} or {{chem|SO|4|2−}}. In simpler words, an ionic bond is the transfer of electrons from a [[metal]] to a [[non-metal]] in order to obtain a full valence shell for both atoms.

It is important to recognize that ''clean'' ionic bonding – in which one atom or molecule completely transfers an electron to another cannot exist: all ionic compounds have some degree of [[covalent bond]]ing, or electron sharing. Thus, the term "ionic bonding" is given when the ionic character is greater than the covalent character – that is, a bond in which a large [[electronegativity]] difference exists between the two atoms, causing the bonding to be more polar (ionic) than in covalent bonding where electrons are shared more equally. Bonds with partially ionic and partially covalent character are called [[polar covalent bond]]s. 

Ionic compounds conduct [[electricity]] when molten or in solution, typically as a solid. Ionic compounds generally have a high [[melting point]], depending on the charge of the ions they consist of. The higher the charges the stronger the cohesive forces and the higher the melting point. They also tend to be [[Solubility|soluble]] in water; the stronger the cohesive forces, the lower the solubility. 

==Overview==
Atoms that have an almost full or almost empty [[valence shell]] tend to be very [[chemical reaction|reactive]]. Atoms that are strongly electronegative (as is the case with [[halogens]]) often have only one or two empty orbitals in their valence shell, and frequently [[chemical bond|bond]] with other molecules or gain electrons to form [[anions]]. Atoms that are weakly electronegative (such as [[alkali metals]]) have relatively few valence electrons, which can easily be shared with atoms that are strongly electronegative. As a result, weakly electronegative atoms tend to distort their electron cloud and form [[cations]].

==Formation==
Ionic bonding can result from a [[redox]] reaction when atoms of an element (usually [[metal]]), whose [[ionization energy]] is low, give some of their electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration. In doing so, cations are formed. An atom of another element (usually nonmetal) with greater [[electron affinity]] accepts the electron(s) to attain a stable electron configuration, and after accepting electron(s) an atom becomes an anion. Typically, the stable electron configuration is one of the [[noble gases]] for elements in the [[s-block]] and the [[p-block]], and particular [[electron configuration|stable electron configurations]] for [[d-block]] and [[f-block]] elements. The electrostatic attraction between the anions and cations leads to the formation of a solid with a [[crystallographic lattice]] in which the ions are stacked in an alternating fashion. In such a lattice, it is usually not possible to distinguish discrete molecular units, so that the compounds formed are not molecular in nature. However, the ions themselves can be complex and form molecular ions like the acetate anion or the ammonium cation.

For example, common [[table salt]] is [[sodium chloride]]. When [[sodium]] (Na) and [[chlorine]] (Cl) are combined, the sodium atoms each lose an [[electron]], forming cations (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), and the chlorine atoms each gain an electron to form anions (Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). These ions are then attracted to each other in a 1:1 ratio to form sodium chloride (NaCl).
: Na + Cl → Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → NaCl 

However, to maintain charge neutrality, strict ratios between anions and cations are observed so that ionic compounds, in general, obey the rules of stoichiometry despite not being molecular compounds. For compounds that are transitional to the alloys and possess mixed ionic and metallic bonding, this may not be the case anymore. Many sulfides, e.g., do form non-stoichiometric compounds.

Many ionic compounds are referred to as '''salts''' as they can also be formed by the neutralization reaction of an Arrhenius base like NaOH with an Arrhenius acid like HCl

: NaOH + HCl →  NaCl + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
  
The salt NaCl is then said to consist of the acid rest Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and the base rest Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[Image:Ionic bonding.svg|thumb|right|225px|Representation of ionic bonding between [[lithium]] and [[fluorine]] to form [[lithium fluoride]]. Lithium has a low ionization energy and readily gives up its lone [[valence electron]] to a fluorine atom, which has a positive electron affinity and accepts the electron that was donated by the lithium atom. The end-result is that lithium is [[isoelectronicity|isoelectronic]] with [[helium]] and fluorine is isoelectronic with [[neon]]. Electrostatic interaction occurs between the two resulting ions, but typically aggregation is not limited to two of them. Instead, aggregation into a whole lattice held together by ionic bonding is the result.]] 

The removal of electrons from the cation is endothermic, raising the system's overall energy. There may also be energy changes associated with breaking of existing bonds or the addition of more than one electron to form anions. However, the action of the anion's accepting the cation's valence electrons and the subsequent attraction of the ions to each other releases (lattice) energy and, thus, lowers the overall energy of the system.

Ionic bonding will occur only if the overall energy change for the reaction is favorable. In general, the reaction is exothermic, but, e.g., the formation of mercuric oxide (HgO) is endothermic. The charge of the resulting ions is a major factor in the strength of ionic bonding, e.g. a salt C&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is held together by electrostatic forces roughly four times weaker than C&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; according to Coulombs law, where C and A represent a generic cation and anion respectively. The sizes of the ions and the particular packing of the lattice are ignored in this rather simplistic argument.

==Structures==
{{Main|Ionic compound}}
Ionic compounds in the solid state form lattice structures. The two principal factors in determining the form of the lattice are the relative charges of the ions and their relative sizes. Some structures are adopted by a number of compounds; for example, the structure of the rock salt [[sodium chloride]] is also adopted by many [[alkali metals|alkali]] halides, and binary oxides such as [[magnesium oxide]]. [[Pauling's rules]] provide guidelines for predicting and rationalizing the crystal structures of ionic crystals

==Strength of the bonding==
{{main|Lattice energy}}

For a solid crystalline ionic compound the [[enthalpy]] change in forming the solid from gaseous ions is termed the [[lattice energy]].
The experimental value for the [[lattice energy]] can  be determined using the [[Born–Haber cycle]]. It can also be calculated (predicted) using the [[Born–Landé equation]] as the sum of the [[electrostatic potential energy]], calculated by summing interactions between cations and anions, and a short-range repulsive potential energy term. The electrostatic potential can be expressed in terms of the interionic separation and a constant ([[Madelung constant]]) that takes account of the geometry of the crystal. The further away from the nucleus the weaker the shield. The [[Born-Landé equation]] gives a reasonable fit to the lattice energy of, e.g., sodium chloride, where the calculated (predicted) value is −756&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, which compares to −787&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol using the [[Born–Haber cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;David Arthur Johnson, ''Metals and Chemical Change'', Open University, Royal Society of Chemistry, 2002, {{ISBN|0-85404-665-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linus Pauling, ''The Nature of the Chemical Bond and the Structure of Molecules and Crystals: An Introduction to Modern Structural Chemistry'', Cornell University Press, 1960 {{ISBN|0-801-40333-2}}  {{DOI|10.1021/ja01355a027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polarization effects==
[[Ion]]s in [[crystal lattice]]s of purely ionic compounds are [[sphere|spherical]]; however, if the positive ion is small and/or highly charged, it will distort the electron cloud of the negative ion, an effect summarised in [[Fajans' rules]]. This [[Polarization (electrostatics)|polarization]] of the negative ion leads to a build-up of extra charge density between the two [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], that is, to partial covalency. Larger negative ions are more easily polarized, but the effect is usually important only when positive ions with [[electrical charge|charges]] of 3+ (e.g., Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) are involved. However, 2+ ions (Be&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) or even 1+ (Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) show some polarizing power because their sizes are so small (e.g., LiI is ionic but has some covalent bonding present).  Note that this is not the [[ionic polarization]] effect that refers to displacement of ions in the lattice due to the application of an electric field.

==Comparison with covalent bonding==
In ionic bonding, the atoms are bound by attraction of oppositely charged ions, whereas, in [[covalent bond]]ing, atoms are bound by sharing electrons to attain stable electron configurations. In covalent bonding, the [[molecular geometry]] around each atom is determined by valence shell electron pair repulsion [[VSEPR]] rules, whereas, in ionic materials, the geometry follows maximum [[close-packing|packing]] rules. One could say that covalent bonding is more ''directional'' in the sense that the energy penalty for not adhering to the optimum bond angles is large, whereas ionic bonding has no such penalty. There are no shared electron pairs to repel each other, the ions should simply be packed as efficiently as possible. This often leads to much higher [[coordination number]]s. In NaCl, each ion has 6 bonds and all bond angles are 90°. In CsCl the coordination number is 8. By comparison carbon typically has a maximum of four bonds.

Purely ionic bonding cannot exist, as the proximity of the entities involved in the bonding allows some degree of sharing [[electron density]] between them. Therefore, all ionic bonding has some covalent character. Thus, bonding is considered ionic where the ionic character is greater than the covalent character. The larger the difference in [[electronegativity]] between the two types of atoms involved in the bonding, the more ionic (polar) it is. Bonds with partially ionic and partially covalent character are called [[polar covalent bond]]s. For example, Na–Cl and Mg–O interactions have a few percent covalency, while Si–O bonds are usually ~50% ionic and ~50% covalent. [[Linus Pauling|Pauling]] estimated that an electronegativity difference of 1.7 (on the [[Electronegativity#Pauling electronegativity|Pauling scale)]] corresponds to 50% ionic character, so that a difference greater than 1.7 corresponds to a bond which is predominantly ionic.&lt;ref&gt;L. Pauling ''The Nature of the Chemical Bond'' (3rd ed., Oxford University Press 1960) p.98-100.&lt;/ref&gt;
Ionic character in covalent bonds can be directly measured for atoms having quadrupolar nuclei (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N, &lt;sup&gt;81,79&lt;/sup&gt;Br, &lt;sup&gt;35,37&lt;/sup&gt;Cl or &lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;I). These nuclei are generally objects of NQR [[nuclear quadrupole resonance]] and NMR [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] studies. Interactions between the nuclear quadrupole moments ''Q'' and the electric field gradients (EFG) are characterized via the nuclear quadrupole coupling constants
:QCC = {{sfrac|''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;zz&lt;/sub&gt;''Q''|''h''}} 
where the ''eq''&lt;sub&gt;zz&lt;/sub&gt; term corresponds to the principal component of the EFG tensor and ''e'' is the elementary charge. In turn, the electric field gradient opens the way to description of bonding modes in molecules when the QCC values are accurately determined by NMR or NQR methods.  

In general, when ionic bonding occurs in the solid (or liquid) state, it is not possible to talk about a single "ionic bond" between two individual atoms, because the cohesive forces that keep the lattice together are of a more collective nature. This is quite different in the case of covalent bonding, where we can often speak of a distinct bond localized between two particular atoms. However, even if ionic bonding is combined with some covalency, the result is ''not'' necessarily discrete bonds of a localized character. In such cases, the resulting bonding often requires description in terms of a band structure consisting of gigantic molecular orbitals spanning the entire crystal. Thus, the bonding in the solid often retains its collective rather than localized nature. When the difference in electronegativity is decreased, the bonding may then lead to a semiconductor, a semimetal or eventually a metallic conductor with metallic bonding.

After [[Dwight D.

Eisenhower|Eisenhower]].

On September 12, 1957, when Graham was 51, he was appointed as a commissioner of the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] by Eisenhower,&lt;ref name="Anders"/&gt; and as a delegate to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].&lt;ref name="President1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4709">A '''Kelvin–Voigt material''', also called a '''Voigt material''', is a [[viscoelastic]] material having the properties both of [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and [[viscosity]]. It is named after the British physicist and engineer [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] and after German physicist [[Woldemar Voigt]].

== Definition ==

The Kelvin–Voigt model, also called the Voigt model, can be represented by a purely viscous damper and purely elastic spring connected in parallel as shown in the picture.

[[Image:Kelvin Voigt diagram.svg|right|frame| Schematic representation of Kelvin–Voigt model.]]

If we connect these two elements in series we get a model of a [[Maxwell material]].

Since the two components of the model are arranged in parallel, the strains in each component are identical:

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_\text{Total} = \varepsilon_S = \varepsilon_D. &lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript D indicates the stress–strain in the damper and the subscript S indicates the stress–strain in the spring. Similarly, the total stress will be the sum of the stress in each component:

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_\text{Total} = \sigma_S + \sigma_D. &lt;/math&gt;

From these equations we get that in a Kelvin–Voigt material, [[Stress (physics)|stress]] σ, [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] ε and their rates of change with respect to time ''t'' are governed by equations of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma (t) = E \varepsilon(t) + \eta \frac {d\varepsilon(t)} {dt},&lt;/math&gt;

or, in dot notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma  = E \varepsilon + \eta \dot {\varepsilon},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is a modulus of elasticity and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[viscosity]]. The equation can be applied either to the [[shear stress]] or [[normal stress]] of a material.

== Effect of a sudden stress ==

If we suddenly apply some constant stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; to Kelvin–Voigt material, then the deformations would approach the deformation for the pure elastic material &lt;math&gt; \sigma_0/E&lt;/math&gt; with the difference decaying exponentially:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(t)=\frac {\sigma_0}{E} (1-e^{-\lambda t}), &lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is time and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; the rate of relaxation &lt;math&gt; \lambda=\frac {E}{\eta} &lt;/math&gt;. Conversely, the value &lt;math&gt; \tau=\frac {\eta}{E} &lt;/math&gt; is known as the [[retardation time]].

If we would free the material at time &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt;, then the elastic element would retard the material back until the deformation becomes zero. The retardation obeys the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(t&gt;t_1)=\varepsilon(t_1)e^{-\lambda (t-t_1)}. &lt;/math&gt;

The picture shows the dependence of the dimensionless deformation &lt;math&gt;\frac {E\varepsilon(t)} {\sigma_0} &lt;/math&gt; 
on dimensionless time &lt;math&gt;\lambda t&lt;/math&gt;. In the picture the stress on the material is loaded at time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;, and released at the later dimensionless time &lt;math&gt;t_1^*=\lambda t_1&lt;/math&gt;.
[[Image:Kelvin deformation 2.png|right|frame|Dependence of dimensionless deformation
upon dimensionless time under constant stress|Dependence of dimensionless deformation
upon dimensionless time under constant stress]]

Since all the deformation is reversible (though not suddenly) the Kelvin–Voigt material is a [[solid]].

The Voigt model predicts creep more realistically than the Maxwell model, because in the infinite time limit the strain approaches a constant:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\to\infty}\varepsilon = \frac{\sigma_0}{E},&lt;/math&gt;

while a Maxwell model predicts a linear relationship between strain and time, which is most often not the case. Although the Kelvin–Voigt model is effective for predicting creep, it is not good at describing the relaxation behavior after the stress load is removed.

== Dynamic modulus ==

The complex [[dynamic modulus]] of the Kelvin–Voigt material is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;E^\star ( \omega ) = E + i \eta \omega. &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the real and imaginary components of the dynamic modulus are:

:&lt;math&gt;E_1 = \Re [E( \omega )] = E, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_2 = \Im [E( \omega )] = \eta \omega. &lt;/math&gt;

Note that &lt;math&gt;E_1&lt;/math&gt; is constant, while &lt;math&gt;E_2&lt;/math&gt; is directly proportional to frequency (where the apparent viscosity, &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;, is the constant of proportionality).

'''Kenule Beeson''' "'''Ken'''" '''Saro-Wiwa''' (10 October 1941 – 10 November 1995) was a Nigerian writer, television producer, environmental activist, and winner of the [[Right Livelihood Award]] and the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]]. Saro-Wiwa was a member of the [[Ogoni people]], an ethnic minority in Nigeria whose homeland, [[Ogoniland]], in the [[Niger Delta]] has been targeted for [[extraction of petroleum|crude oil extraction]] since the 1950s and which has suffered extreme [[environmental damage]] from decades of indiscriminate petroleum waste dumping. Initially as spokesperson, and then as president, of the [[Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People]] (MOSOP), Saro-Wiwa led a [[nonviolent resistance|nonviolent campaign]] against [[environmental degradation]] of the land and waters of Ogoniland by the operations of the [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[Petroleum industry in Nigeria|petroleum industry]], especially the [[Royal Dutch Shell]] company. He was also an outspoken critic of the [[Nigerian government]], which he viewed as reluctant to enforce environmental regulations on the foreign petroleum companies operating in the area.

At the peak of his non-violent campaign, he was tried by a special [[military tribunal]] for allegedly masterminding the gruesome murder of Ogoni chiefs at a pro-government meeting, and [[hanged]] in 1995 by the [[military dictatorship]] of General [[Sani Abacha]]. His execution provoked international outrage and resulted in Nigeria's suspension from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] for over three years.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born Kenule Tsaro-Wiwa, the son of [[Jim Wiwa]], a forest ranger and his third wife, Widu. He changed his name to Saro-Wiwa after the Nigerian Civil war.{{sfn|Doron|Falola|2016|p=35}} His father's hometown is the village of Bori, Ogoniland whose residents speak the Khana dialect of Ogoni language. Saro-Wiwa spent his childhood in an Anglican home and eventually proved himself to be an excellent student; he received primary education at a Native Authority school in Bori, {{sfn|Doron|Falola|2016|p=36}} then attended secondary school at [[Government College Umuahia]]. A distinguished student, Saro-Wiwa was captain of the  table tennis team and amassed school prizes in history and English.{{sfn|Doron|Falola|2016|p=39}} At Umuahia, he was the only student from Ogoni land but fellow students were mandated to speak English which made Saro-Wiwa feel Nigerian; he embraced the language as a useful way to communicate to a larger audience at home and abroad. On completion of secondary education, he obtained a scholarship to study English at the [[University of Ibadan]]. At Ibadan, he plunged into academic and cultural interests, he won departmental prizes in 1963 and 1965 and worked for a drama troupe.{{sfn|Doron|Falola|2016|p=41}} The travelling drama troupe performed in Kano, Benin Ilorin and Lagos and collaborated with the [[Nottingham Playhouse]] theatre group that included a young [[Judi Dench]].{{sfn|Doron|Falola|2016|p=41}} He briefly became a teaching assistant at the [[University of Lagos]] and later at University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Saro-Wiwa was an African literature lecturer in Nsukka when the Civil war broke out, he supported the Federal Government and had to leave the region for his hometown of Bori. On his journey to Port-Harcourt, he witnessed the multitudes of refugees returning to the East, a scene he described as a "sorry sight to see".{{sfn|Doron|Falola|2016|p=50}} Three days after his arrival, nearby Bonny was liberated by federal troops. He and his family then stayed in Bonny, he travelled back to Lagos and took a position at the [[University of Lagos]] which did not last long as he was called back to Bonny.

He called back to become the Civilian Administrator for the port city of [[Bonny, Nigeria|Bonny]] in the [[Niger Delta]] and during the [[Nigerian Civil War]] positioned himself as an Ogoni leader dedicated to the Federal cause.  {{sfn|Doron|Falola|2016|p=43}}He followed his job as an administrator with an appointment as a commissioner in the old Rivers State. His best known novel, ''[[Sozaboy: A Novel in Rotten English]]'', tells the story of a naive village boy recruited to the army during the Nigerian Civil War of 1967 to 1970, and intimates the political corruption and [[patronage]] in Nigeria's [[military regime]] of the time. Saro-Wiwa's war diaries, ''[[On a Darkling Plain]]'', document his experience during the war. He was also a successful businessman and television producer. His satirical television series, ''[[Basi &amp; Company]]'', was wildly popular, with an estimated audience of 30 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brooke|first=James|title=Enugu Journal; 30 Million Nigerians are Laughing at Themselves|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/24/world/enugu-journal-30-million-nigerians-are-laughing-at-themselves.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 July 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, Saro-Wiwa served as the Regional Commissioner for Education in the [[Rivers State]] Cabinet, but was dismissed in 1973 because of his support for Ogoni [[autonomy]]. In the late 1970s, he established a number of successful business ventures in retail and real estate, and during the 1980s concentrated primarily on his writing, journalism and television production. In 1977, he became involved in the political arena running as the candidate to represent Ogoni in the Constituent Assembly. Saro-Wiwa lost the election in a narrow margin.{{sfn|Doron|Falola|2016|p=64}} It was during this time he had a fall out with his friend Edwards Kobani.

His intellectual work was interrupted in 1987 when he re-entered the political scene, appointed by the newly installed dictator [[Ibrahim Babangida]] to aid the country's transition to democracy. But Saro-Wiwa soon resigned because he felt Babangida's supposed plans for a return to democracy were disingenuous. Saro-Wiwa's sentiments were proven correct in the coming years, as Babangida failed to relinquish power. In 1993, Babangida annulled Nigeria's general elections that would have transferred power to a civilian government, sparking mass civil unrest and eventually forcing him to step down, at least officially, that same year.&lt;ref name="Oxford05"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appiah|first1=Anthony|last2=Gates|first2=Henry|url=https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC|title=Encyclopedia of Africa, Volume 1|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=|isbn=0195337700|page=356|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Works===
Saro-Wiwa's works include TV, drama and prose writing. His earlier works from 1970s to 1980s are mostly satirical displays that portrays a counter-image of Nigerian society{{sfn|Davis|Matzke|Raji|Ohaeto|2006|p=269}} but his later writings were more inspired by political dimensions such as environmental and social justice than satire.

''Transistor Radio'', one of his best known plays{{sfn|Davis|Matzke|Raji|Ohaeto|2006|p=270}} was written for a revue during his university days at Ibadan but still resonated well with Nigerian society and was adapted into a television series. Some of his works drew inspiration from the play. In 1972, a radio version of the play was produced and in 1985, he produced, Basi and Company, a successful screen adaption of the play. Saro-Wiwa included the play in ''Four Farcical Plays'' and '' Basi and Company: Four Television Plays''. ''Basi and company'', an adaptation of ''Transistor Radio'' ran on television from 1985 to 1990. A farcical comedy,{{sfn|Davis|Matzke|Raji|Ohaeto|2006|p=273}} the show chronicles city life and is anchored by the protagonist, Basi, a resourceful and street wise character looking for ways to achieve his goal of obtaining millions which always ends to become an illusive mission.

In 1985, the Biafran Civil War novel ''Sozaboy'' was published. The protagonist's language was written in nonstandard English or what Saro-Wiwa called "Rotten English", a hybrid language of pidgin English, standard English and broken English.&lt;ref&gt;91&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activism===
In 1990, Saro-Wiwa began devoting most of his time to human rights and environmental causes, particularly in Ogoniland. He was one of the earliest members of the [[Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People]] (MOSOP), which advocated for the rights of the Ogoni people. The Ogoni Bill of Rights, written by MOSOP, set out the movement's demands, including increased autonomy for the Ogoni people, a fair share of the proceeds of oil extraction, and remediation of environmental damage to Ogoni lands. In particular, MOSOP struggled against the degradation of Ogoni lands by [[Royal Dutch Shell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiwavshell.org/about/about-wiwa-v-shell/|title=About Wiwa v. Shell|publisher=[[Wiwa family lawsuits against Royal Dutch Shell]]|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Saro-Wiwa was imprisoned for several months, without trial, by the Nigerian military government.

Saro-Wiwa was Vice Chair of the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]] (UNPO) General Assembly from 1993 to 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unpo.org/article/11820|title=Clean the Niger Delta – 'We all stand before history', Ken Saro-Wiwa, 1995|date=19 October 2010|publisher=[[UNPO]]|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNPO is an international, nonviolent, and democratic organisation (of which MOSOP is a member). Its members are indigenous peoples, minorities, and unrecognised or occupied territories who have joined together to protect and promote their human and cultural rights, to preserve their environments and to find nonviolent solutions to conflicts which affect them.

In January 1993, MOSOP organised peaceful marches of around 300,000 Ogoni people – more than half of the Ogoni population – through four Ogoni urban centres, drawing international attention to their people's plight. The same year the Nigerian government occupied the region militarily.

===Arrest and execution===
Saro-Wiwa was arrested again and detained by Nigerian authorities in June 1993 but was released after a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adiama.com/ancestralconnections/2009/11/22/the-life-death-of-ken-saro-wiwa-the-struggle-for-justice-in-the-niger-delta/|title=The Life &amp; Death of Ken Saro-Wiwa: The Struggle for Justice in the Niger Delta|work=adiama.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 21 May 1994 four Ogoni chiefs (all on the conservative side of a schism within MOSOP over strategy) were brutally murdered. Saro-Wiwa had been denied entry to Ogoniland on the day of the murders, but he was arrested and accused of incitement to them. He denied the charges but was imprisoned for over a year before being found guilty and sentenced to death by a specially convened tribunal. The same happened to eight other MOSOP leaders who, along with Saro-Wiwa, became known as the [[Ogoni Nine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/08/nigeria-usa | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Shell pays out $15.5m over Saro-Wiwa killing | first=Ed | last=Pilkington | date=9 June 2009 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the defendants' lawyers resigned in protest against the alleged rigging of the trial by the Abacha regime. The resignations left the defendants to their own means against the tribunal, which continued to bring witnesses to testify against Saro-Wiwa and his peers. Many of these supposed witnesses later admitted that they had been bribed by the Nigerian government to support the criminal allegations. At least two witnesses who testified that Saro-Wiwa was involved in the murders of the Ogoni elders later recanted, stating that they had been bribed with money and offers of jobs with Shell to give false testimony, in the presence of Shell's lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Entine |first=Jon |url=http://www.aei.org/publication/seeds-of-ngo-activism-shell-capitulates-in-saro-wiwa-case/ |title=Seeds of NGO Activism: Shell Capitulates in Saro-Wiwa Case |publisher=NGO Watch |date=18 June 2009 |accessdate=14 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial was widely criticised by human rights organisations and, half a year later, Ken Saro-Wiwa received the Right Livelihood Award for his courage, as well as the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goldmanprize.org/recipient/ken-saro-wiwa/ |title=Ken Saro-Wiwa |publisher=The Goldman Environmental Prize |year=1995 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 November 1995, Saro-Wiwa and the rest of the Ogoni Nine were killed by [[hanging]] by military personnel. They were buried in [[Port Harcourt Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="cemetery1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/450161/NIGERIAS-MILITARY-LEADERS-HANG-PLAYWRIGHT-AND-8-OTHER-ACTIVISTS.html?pg=all|title=Nigeria's Military Leaders Hang Playwright And 8 Other Activists|work=Deseretnews.com|publisher=Deseret News Publishing Company|date=11 November 1995 |accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1989 [[short story]] "Africa Kills Her Sun", Saro-Wiwa in a resigned, melancholic mood, foreshadowed his own execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qessays.com/essay-on-qafrica-kills-her-sunq/|title=Review of Africa Kills Her 'Sun'|work=Qessays}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/africa-kills-her-sun-salem/africa-kills-her-sun|title=Africa Kills Her Sun Summary|work=eNotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngishili.com/ Ken Saro-Wiwa, ''Africa Kills Her Sun'', p. 365.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family lawsuits against Royal Dutch Shell==
{{Main|Wiwa family lawsuits against Royal Dutch Shell}}
Beginning in 1996, the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] (CCR), [[EarthRights International]] (ERI), Paul Hoffman of Schonbrun, DeSimone, Seplow, Harris &amp; Hoffman and other human rights attorneys have brought a series of cases to hold Shell accountable for alleged human rights violations in Nigeria, including [[summary execution]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[torture]], inhumane treatment and [[arbitrary arrest]] and detention. The lawsuits are brought against Royal Dutch Shell and Brian Anderson, the head of its Nigerian operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiwavshell.org/|title=Wiwa et al v. Royal Dutch Petroleum et al.|work=Center for Constitutional Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cases were brought under the [[Alien Tort Statute]], a 1978 statute giving non-US citizens the right to file suits in US courts for international human rights violations, and the [[Torture Victim Protection Act]], which allows individuals to seek damages in the US for torture or extrajudicial killing, regardless of where the violations take place.

The [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] set a trial date of June 2009. On 9 June 2009 [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] agreed to an out-of-court settlement of US$15.5 million to victims' families. However, the company denied any liability for the deaths, stating that the payment was part of a reconciliation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shell settles Nigeria deaths case |publisher=BBC |date=9 June 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8090493.stm |accessdate=9 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement given after the settlement, Shell suggested that the money was being provided to the relatives of Saro-Wiwa and the eight other victims, to cover the legal costs of the case and also in recognition of the events that took place in the region.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |title=Shell to Pay $15.5 Million to Settle Nigerian Case |publisher=''New York Times'' |date=9 June 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/09/business/global/09shell.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss |accessdate=9 June 2009 | first=Jad | last=Mouawad}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the funding is also expected to be used to set up a development trust for the [[Ogoni people]], who inhabit the [[Niger Delta]] region of Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shell agrees $15.5m settlement over death of Saro-Wiwa and eight others |publisher=''[[The Times]]'' |date=9 June 2009 |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/natural_resources/article6459634.ece |accessdate=9 June 2009 | location=London | first=Christine | last=Seib}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement was made just days before the trial, which had been brought by Ken Saro-Wiwa's son, was due to begin in New York.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Legacy==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2012|talk=y}}

'''Lamma Power Station''' ({{zh|t=南丫發電廠}}), informally known as '''Lamma Island Power Station''', is a [[Fossil-fuel power station|coal and gas-fired power station]] in Po Lo Tsui, [[Lamma Island]], [[Hong Kong]]. With the installed capacity of 3,736 MW, the power station is the second largest coal-fired power station in Hong Kong after [[Castle Peak Power Station]].

Built in 1982 (with several later additions) for [[Hongkong Electric]], the station provides power to [[Hong Kong Island]] and [[Lamma Island]]. By mid-2006, the total installed capacity of the power station was 3,736 MW.

'''Large eddy simulation (LES)''' is a mathematical model for [[turbulence]] used in [[computational fluid dynamics]]. It was initially proposed in 1963 by [[Joseph Smagorinsky]] to simulate atmospheric air currents,&lt;ref name="Smagorinsky_1963"&gt;{{Cite journal

The simulation of turbulent flows by numerically solving the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] requires resolving a very wide range of time and length scales, all of which affect the flow field.  Such a resolution can be achieved with [[direct numerical simulation]] (DNS), but DNS is computationally expensive, and its cost prohibits simulation of  practical engineering systems with complex geometry or flow configurations, such as turbulent jets, pumps, vehicles, and landing gear.

The principal idea behind LES is to reduce the computational cost by ignoring the smallest length scales, which are the most computationally expensive to resolve, via [[Filter (signal processing)|low-pass filtering]] of the [[Navier–Stokes equations]].  Such a low-pass filtering, which can be viewed as a time- and spatial-averaging, effectively removes small-scale information from the numerical solution.  This information is not irrelevant, however, and its effect on the flow field must be modeled, a task which is an active area of research for problems in which small-scales can play an important role, such as near-wall flows &lt;ref name="piomelli-02"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Piomelli, Ugo |author2=Elias Balaras |title= Wall-layer models for large-eddy simulations.|journal=Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics|year=2002|volume=34|doi=10.1146/annurev.fluid.34.082901.144919|bibcode=2002AnRFM..34..349P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spalart-09"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spalart, P.

An [[Filter (large eddy simulation)|LES filter]] can be applied to a spatial and temporal field &lt;math&gt;\phi(\boldsymbol{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; and perform a spatial filtering operation, a temporal filtering operation, or both.  The filtered field, denoted with a bar, is defined as:&lt;ref name="Pope_2000"&gt;{{cite book|title=Turbulent Flows|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press |author=Pope, S. B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sagaut_2006"&gt;{{cite book
|author=Sagaut, Pierre

:&lt;math&gt;
\overline{\phi(\boldsymbol{x},t)} = \displaystyle{
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \phi(\boldsymbol{r},\tau) G(\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{r},t - \tau) d\tau d \boldsymbol{r}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the filter convolution kernel.  This can also be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\overline{\phi} = G \star \phi .
&lt;/math&gt;

The filter kernel &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; has an associated cutoff length scale &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; and cutoff time scale &lt;math&gt;\tau_{c}&lt;/math&gt;.  Scales smaller than these are eliminated from &lt;math&gt;\overline{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;.  Using the above filter definition, any field &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; may be split up into a filtered and sub-filtered (denoted with a prime) portion, as

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi = \bar{\phi} + \phi^{\prime} .
&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note that the [[Filter (large eddy simulation)|large eddy simulation filtering operation]] does not satisfy the properties of a [[Reynolds operator]].

== Filtered governing equations ==

The governing equations of LES are obtained by filtering the [[partial differential equations]] governing the flow field &lt;math&gt;\rho \boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x},t)&lt;/math&gt;.  There are differences between the incompressible and compressible LES governing equations, which lead to the definition of a new filtering operation.

=== Incompressible flow ===

For incompressible flow, the [[Continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|continuity equation]] and Navier–Stokes equations are filtered, yielding the filtered incompressible continuity equation,

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{ \partial \bar{u_i} }{ \partial x_i } = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

and the filtered Navier–Stokes equations,

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{ \partial \bar{u_i} }{ \partial t }
+ \frac{ \partial }{ \partial x_j } \left( \overline{ u_i u_j } \right) 
= - \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{ \partial \overline{p} }{ \partial x_i } 
+ \nu \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} \left( \frac{ \partial \bar{u_i} }{ \partial x_j } + \frac{ \partial \bar{u_j} }{ \partial x_i } \right)
= - \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{ \partial \overline{p} }{ \partial x_i } 
+ 2 \nu \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} S_{ij},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the filtered pressure field and &lt;math&gt;S_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the rate-of-strain tensor.  The [[nonlinear]] filtered advection term &lt;math&gt;\overline{u_i u_j}&lt;/math&gt; is the chief cause of difficulty in LES modeling.  It requires knowledge of the unfiltered velocity field, which is unknown, so it must be modeled.  The analysis that follows illustrates the difficulty caused by the nonlinearity, namely, that it causes interaction between large and small scales, preventing separation of scales.

The filtered advection term can be split up, following Leonard (1974),&lt;ref name="Leonard_1974"&gt;{{cite journal
|last=Leonard
|first=A.
|year=1974
|title=Energy cascade in large-eddy simulations of turbulent fluid flows

|doi=10.1016/S0065-2687(08)60464-1|bibcode = 1975AdGeo..18..237L }}&lt;/ref&gt; as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\overline{u_i u_j} = \tau_{ij}^{r} + \overline{u}_i \overline{u}_j
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau_{ij}^{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the residual stress tensor, so that the filtered Navier Stokes equations become

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{ \partial \bar{u_i} }{ \partial t }
+ \frac{ \partial }{ \partial x_j } \left( \overline{u}_i \overline{u}_j \right) 
= - \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{ \partial \overline{p} }{ \partial x_i } 
+ 2 \nu \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} \bar{S}_{ij}
- \frac{ \partial \tau_{ij}^{r} }{ \partial x_j }
&lt;/math&gt;

with the residual stress tensor &lt;math&gt;\tau_{ij}^{r}&lt;/math&gt; grouping all unclosed terms.  Leonard decomposed this stress tensor as &lt;math&gt;\tau_{ij}^{r} = L_{ij} + C_{ij} + R_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and provided physical interpretations for each term.  &lt;math&gt;L_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, the Leonard tensor, represents interactions among large scales, &lt;math&gt;R_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, the Reynolds stress-like term, represents interactions among the sub-filter scales (SFS), and &lt;math&gt;C_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, the Clark tensor,&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite journal

This is made challenging by the fact that the sub-filter scale stress tensor &lt;math&gt;\tau_{ij}^{r}&lt;/math&gt; must account for interactions among all scales, including filtered scales with unfiltered scales.

The filtered governing equation for a passive scalar &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, such as mixture fraction or temperature, can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{ \partial \overline{\phi} }{ \partial t }
+ \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} \left( \overline{u}_j \overline{\phi} \right)
= \frac{\partial \overline{J_{\phi}} }{\partial x_j} 
+ \frac{ \partial q_{ij} }{ \partial x_j }
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J_{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is the diffusive flux of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;q_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the sub-filter stress tensor for the scalar &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.  The filtered diffusive flux &lt;math&gt;\overline{J_{\phi}}&lt;/math&gt; is unclosed, unless a particular form is assumed for it (e.g. a gradient diffusion model &lt;math&gt;J_{\phi} = D_{\phi} \frac{ \partial \phi }{ \partial x_i }&lt;/math&gt;).  &lt;math&gt;q_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is defined analogously to &lt;math&gt;\tau_{ij}^{r}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
q_{ij} = \bar{\phi} \overline{u}_j - \overline{\phi u_j}
&lt;/math&gt;

and can similarly be split up into contributions from interactions between various scales.  This sub-filter tensor also requires a sub-filter model.

====Derivation====
Using [[Einstein notation]], the Navier–Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid in Cartesian coordinates are
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_i} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial u_iu_j}{\partial x_j}
= - \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial x_i}
+ \nu \frac{\partial^2 u_i}{\partial x_j \partial x_j}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Filtering the momentum equation results in
: &lt;math&gt; \overline{\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial t}} + \overline{\frac{\partial u_iu_j}{\partial x_j}}
= - \overline{\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial x_i}}
+ \overline{\nu \frac{\partial^2 u_i}{\partial x_j \partial x_j}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

If we assume that filtering and differentiation commute, then
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \bar{u_i}}{\partial t} + \overline{\frac{\partial u_iu_j}{\partial x_j}}
= - \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \bar{p}}{\partial x_i}
+ \nu \frac{\partial^2 \bar{u_i}}{\partial x_j \partial x_j}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation models the changes in time of the filtered variables &lt;math&gt;\bar{u_i}&lt;/math&gt;.  Since the unfiltered variables &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; are not known, it is impossible to directly calculate &lt;math&gt;\overline{\frac{\partial u_iu_j}{\partial x_j}}&lt;/math&gt;.  However, the quantity &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \bar{u_i}\bar{u_j}}{\partial x_j}&lt;/math&gt; is known.  A substitution is made:
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \bar{u_i}}{\partial t} +  \frac{\partial \bar{u_i}\bar{u_j}}{\partial x_j}
= - \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \bar{p}}{\partial x_i}
+ \nu \frac{\partial^2 \bar{u_i}}{\partial x_j \partial x_j}
- \left(\overline{ \frac{\partial u_iu_j}{\partial x_j}} -  \frac{\partial \bar{u_i}\bar{u_j}}{\partial x_j}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\tau_{ij} = \overline{u_i u_j} - \bar{u_i} \bar{u_j}&lt;/math&gt;. The resulting set of equations are the LES equations:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \bar{u_i}}{\partial t} + \bar{u_j} \frac{\partial \bar{u_i}}{\partial x_j}
= - \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \bar{p}}{\partial x_i}
+ \nu \frac{\partial^2 \bar{u_i}}{\partial x_j \partial x_j}
- \frac{\partial\tau_{ij}}{\partial x_j}.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Compressible governing equations ===

For the governing equations of compressible flow, each equation, starting with the conservation of mass, is filtered.  This gives:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial \overline{\rho}}{\partial t} + \frac{ \partial \overline{u_i \rho} }{\partial x_i} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

which results in an additional sub-filter term.  However, it is desirable to avoid having to model the sub-filter scales of the mass conservation equation.  For this reason, Favre&lt;ref name="Favre_1983"&gt;{{cite journal
|author=Favre, Alexandre
|title=Turbulence: space-time statistical properties and behavior in supersonic flows
|year=1983
|journal=Physics of Fluids A
|volume=23
|issue=10
|pages=2851–2863
|doi=10.1063/1.864049|bibcode = 1983PhFl...26.2851F }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a density-weighted filtering operation, called Favre filtering, defined for an arbitrary quantity &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\tilde{\phi} = \frac{ \overline{\rho \phi} }{ \overline{\rho} }
&lt;/math&gt;

which, in the limit of incompressibility, becomes the normal filtering operation.  This makes the conservation of mass equation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial \overline{\rho}}{\partial t} + \frac{ \partial \overline{\rho} \tilde{u_i} }{ \partial x_i } = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

This concept can then be extended to write the Favre-filtered momentum equation for compressible flow.  Following Vreman:&lt;ref name="Vreman_1995"&gt;{{cite journal
|author1=Vreman, Bert
|author2=Geurts, Bernard

|doi=10.1007/BF00849116
|title=Subgrid-modelling in LES of compressible flow
|pages=191–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{ \partial \overline{\rho} \tilde{u_i} }{ \partial t }
+ \frac{ \partial \overline{\rho} \tilde{u_i} \tilde{u_j} }{ \partial x_j }
+ \frac{ \partial \overline{p} }{ \partial x_i }
- \frac{ \partial \tilde{\sigma}_{ij} }{ \partial x_j }
= - \frac{ \partial \overline{\rho} \tau_{ij}^{r} }{ \partial x_j }
+ \frac{ \partial }{ \partial x_j } \left( \overline{\sigma}_{ij} - \tilde{\sigma}_{ij} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the shear stress tensor, given for a Newtonian fluid by:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_{ij} = 2 \mu(T) S_{ij} - \frac{2}{3} \mu(T) \delta_{ij} S_{kk}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the term &lt;math&gt;\frac{ \partial }{\partial x_j} \left( \overline{\sigma}_{ij} - \tilde{\sigma}_{ij} \right)&lt;/math&gt; represents a sub-filter viscous contribution from evaluating the viscosity &lt;math&gt;\mu(T)&lt;/math&gt; using the Favre-filtered temperature &lt;math&gt;\tilde{T}&lt;/math&gt;.  The subgrid stress tensor for the Favre-filtered momentum field is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\tau_{ij}^{r} = \widetilde{ u_i \cdot u_j } - \tilde{u_i} \tilde{u_j}
&lt;/math&gt;

By analogy, the Leonard decomposition may also be written for the residual stress tensor for a filtered triple product &lt;math&gt;\overline{\rho \phi \psi}&lt;/math&gt;.  The triple product can be rewritten using the Favre filtering operator as &lt;math&gt;\overline{\rho} \widetilde{\phi \psi}&lt;/math&gt;, which is an unclosed term (it requires knowledge of the fields &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, when only the fields &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\psi}&lt;/math&gt; are known).  It can be broken up in a manner analogous to &lt;math&gt;\overline{u_i u_j}&lt;/math&gt; above, which results in a sub-filter stress tensor &lt;math&gt;\overline{\rho} \left( \widetilde{\phi \psi} - \tilde{\phi} \tilde{\psi} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.  This sub-filter term can be split up into contributions from three types of interactions: the Leondard tensor &lt;math&gt;L_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, representing interactions among resolved scales; the Clark tensor &lt;math&gt;C_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, representing interactions between resolved and unresolved scales; and the Reynolds tensor &lt;math&gt;R_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, which represents interactions among unresolved scales.&lt;ref name="Sagaut_2009"&gt;{{cite book

=== Filtered kinetic energy equation ===

In addition to the filtered mass and momentum equations, filtering the kinetic energy equation can provide additional insight.  The kinetic energy field can be filtered to yield the total filtered kinetic energy:

:&lt;math&gt;
\overline{E} = \frac{1}{2} \overline{ u_i u_i }
&lt;/math&gt;

and the total filtered kinetic energy can be decomposed into two terms: the kinetic energy of the filtered velocity field &lt;math&gt;E_f&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
E_f = \frac{1}{2} \overline{u_i}  \, \overline{u_i}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the residual kinetic energy &lt;math&gt;k_r&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
k_r = \frac{1}{2} \overline{ u_i u_i } - \frac{1}{2} \overline{u_i} \, \overline{u_i} = \frac{1}{2} \tau_{ii}^{r}
&lt;/math&gt;

such that &lt;math&gt;\overline{E} = E_f + k_r&lt;/math&gt;.

The conservation equation for &lt;math&gt;E_f&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained by multiplying the filtered momentum transport equation by &lt;math&gt;\overline{u_i}&lt;/math&gt; to yield:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial E_f}{\partial t} 
+ \overline{u_j} \frac{\partial E_f}{\partial x_j} 
+ \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \overline{u_i} \bar{p} }{ \partial x_i }
+ \frac{\partial \overline{u_i} \tau_{ij}^{r}}{\partial x_j} 
- 2 \nu \frac{ \partial \overline{u_i} \bar{S_{ij}} }{ \partial x_j }
= 
- \epsilon_{f} 
- \Pi
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_{f} = 2 \nu \bar{S_{ij}} \bar{S_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt; is the dissipation of kinetic energy of the filtered velocity field by viscous stress, and &lt;math&gt;\Pi = -\tau_{ij}^{r} \bar{S_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt; represents the sub-filter scale (SFS) dissipation of kinetic energy.

The terms on the left-hand side represent transport, and the terms on the right-hand side are sink terms that dissipate kinetic energy.&lt;ref name="Pope_2000" /&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; SFS dissipation term is of particular interest, since it represents the transfer of energy from large resolved scales to small unresolved scales.  On average, &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; transfers energy from large to small scales.  However, instantaneously &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; can be positive ''or'' negative, meaning it can also act as a source term for &lt;math&gt;E_f&lt;/math&gt;, the kinetic energy of the filtered velocity field.  The transfer of energy from unresolved to resolved scales is called '''backscatter''' (and likewise the transfer of energy from resolved to unresolved scales is called '''forward-scatter''').&lt;ref name="Piomelli_1991"&gt;{{cite journal

== Numerical methods for LES ==

Large eddy simulation involves the solution to the discrete filtered governing equations using [[computational fluid dynamics]].  LES resolves scales from the domain size &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; down to the filter size &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;, and as such a substantial portion of high wave number turbulent fluctuations must be resolved.  This requires either [[High-resolution scheme|high-order numerical schemes]], or fine grid resolution if low-order numerical schemes are used.  Chapter 13 of Pope&lt;ref name="Pope_2000" /&gt; addresses the question of how fine a grid resolution &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is needed to resolve a filtered velocity field &lt;math&gt;\overline{u}(\boldsymbol{x})&lt;/math&gt;.  Ghosal&lt;ref name="Ghosal_1996"&gt;{{cite journal

While even-order schemes have truncation error, they are non-dissipative,&lt;ref name="Leveque_1992"&gt;{{cite book

|publisher=Birkhäuser Basel
|edition=2nd
|isbn=978-3-7643-2723-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because subfilter scale models are dissipative, even-order schemes will not affect the subfilter scale model contributions as strongly as dissipative schemes.

=== Filter implementation ===

The filtering operation in large eddy simulation can be implicit or explicit.  Implicit filtering recognizes that the subfilter scale model will dissipate in the same manner as many numerical schemes.  In this way, the grid, or the numerical discretization scheme, can be assumed to be the LES low-pass filter.  While this takes full advantage of the grid resolution, and eliminates the computational cost of calculating a subfilter scale model term, it is difficult to determine the shape of the LES filter that is associated with some numerical issues.  Additionally, truncation error can also become an issue.&lt;ref name="Grinstein_2007"&gt;{{cite book
|title=Implicit large eddy simulation

|author2=Margolin, Len
|author3=Rider, William
|year=2007
|publisher=Cambridge University Press
|isbn=978-0-521-86982-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In explicit filtering, an [[Filter (large eddy simulation)|LES filter]] is applied to the discretized Navier–Stokes equations, providing a well-defined filter shape and reducing the truncation error.  However, explicit filtering requires a finer grid than implicit filtering, and the computational cost increases with &lt;math&gt;(\Delta x)^4&lt;/math&gt;. Chapter 8 of Sagaut (2006) covers LES numerics in greater detail.&lt;ref name="Sagaut_2006" /&gt;

== Boundary conditions of large eddy simulations ==
Inlet boundary conditions affect the accuracy of LES significantly, and the treatment of inlet conditions for LES is a complicated problem. Theoretically, a good boundary condition for LES should contain the following features:&lt;ref name="Li_P"&gt;Li, P., Eckels, S., Mann, G., Zhang, N. A Method of Measuring Turbulent Flow Structures With Particle Image Velocimetry and Incorporating Into Boundary Conditions of Large Eddy Simulations. ASME. J. Fluids Eng. 2018;140(7):071401-071401-11. doi:10.1115/1.4039256.&lt;/ref&gt; 

(1) providing accurate information of flow characteristics, i.e. velocity and turbulence; 

(2) satisfying the Navier-Stokes equations and other physics;

(3) being easy to implement and adjust to different cases. 

Currently, methods of generating inlet conditions for LES are broadly divided into two categories classified by Tabor et al.:&lt;ref&gt;Tabor, G. R., &amp; Baba-Ahmadi, M. H. (2010). Inlet conditions for large eddy simulation: a review. Computers &amp; Fluids, 39(4), 553-567.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first method for generating turbulent inlets is to synthesize them according to particular cases, such as Fourier techniques, principle orthogonal decomposition (POD) and vortex methods. The synthesis techniques attempt to construct turbulent field at inlets that have suitable turbulence-like properties and make it easy to specify parameters of the turbulence, such as turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation rate. In addition, inlet conditions generated by using random numbers are computationally inexpensive. However, one serious drawback exists in the method. The synthesized turbulence does not satisfy the physical structure of fluid flow governed by Navier-Stokes equations.&lt;ref name="Li_P" /&gt; 

The second method involves a separate and precursor calculation to generate a turbulent database which can be introduced into the main computation at the inlets. The database (sometimes named as ‘library’) can be generated in a number of ways, such as cyclic domains, pre-prepared library, and internal mapping. However, the method of generating turbulent inflow by precursor simulations requires large calculation capacity. 

Researchers examining the application of various types of synthetic and precursor calculations have found that the more realistic the inlet turbulence, the more accurate LES predicts results.&lt;ref name="Li_P" /&gt;

== Modeling unresolved scales ==

To discuss the modeling of unresolved scales, first the unresolved scales must be classified. They fall into two groups: '''resolved sub-filter scales''' (SFS), and '''sub-grid scales'''(SGS).

The resolved sub-filter scales represent the scales with wave numbers larger than the cutoff wave number &lt;math&gt;k_c&lt;/math&gt;, but whose effects are dampened by the filter.  Resolved sub-filter scales only exist when filters non-local in wave-space are used (such as a [[Filter (large eddy simulation)#Box filter|box]] or [[Filter (large eddy simulation)#Gaussian filter|Gaussian]] filter).  These resolved sub-filter scales must be modeled using filter reconstruction.

Sub-grid scales are any scales that are smaller than the cutoff filter width &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;.  The form of the SGS model depends on the filter implementation.  As mentioned in the [[#Numerical Methods for LES|Numerical methods for LES]] section, if implicit LES is considered,  no SGS model is implemented and the numerical effects of the discretization are assumed to mimic the physics of the unresolved turbulent motions.

=== Sub-grid scale models ===

Without a universally valid description of turbulence,  empirical information must be utilized when constructing and applying SGS models, supplemented with fundamental physical constraints such as [[Galilean invariance]]&lt;ref name="Pope_2000" /&gt;
.&lt;ref name="Meneveau_2010"&gt;{{cite journal
|title=Turbulence: Subgrid-Scale Modeling

|pages=9489.
|doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.9489
|bibcode=2010SchpJ...5.9489M
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two classes of SGS models exist; the first class is '''functional models''' and the second class is '''structural models'''.  Some models may be categorized as both.

==== Functional (eddy–viscosity) models ====

Functional models are simpler than structural models, focusing only on dissipating energy at a rate that is physically correct.  These are based on an artificial eddy viscosity approach, where the effects of turbulence are lumped into a turbulent viscosity.  The approach treats dissipation of kinetic energy at sub-grid scales as analogous to molecular diffusion.  In this case, the deviatoric part of &lt;math&gt;\tau_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is modeled as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\tau_{ij}^r - \frac{1}{3} \tau_{kk} \delta_{ij} = -2 \nu_\mathrm{t} \bar{S}_{ij}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\nu_\mathrm{t}&lt;/math&gt; is the turbulent eddy viscosity and &lt;math&gt;\bar{S}_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\partial \bar{u}_i }{\partial x_j} + \frac{\partial \bar{u}_j}{ \partial x_i} \right)&lt;/math&gt; is the rate-of-strain tensor.

Based on dimensional analysis, the eddy viscosity must have units of  &lt;math&gt;\left[ \nu_\mathrm{t} \right] = \frac{\mathrm{m^2}}{\mathrm{s}}&lt;/math&gt;.  Most eddy viscosity SGS models model the eddy viscosity as the product of a characteristic length scale and a characteristic velocity scale.

===== Smagorinsky–Lilly model =====

The first SGS model developed was the Smagorinsky–Lilly SGS model, which was developed by [[Joseph Smagorinsky|Smagorinsky]]&lt;ref name="Smagorinsky_1963" /&gt; and used in the first LES simulation by Deardorff.&lt;ref name="Deardorff_1970" /&gt;  It models the eddy viscosity as:

:&lt;math&gt;\nu_\mathrm{t} 
= (C_s \Delta_g)^2\sqrt{2\bar{S}_{ij}\bar{S}_{ij}} 
= (C_s \Delta_g)^2 \left| S \right|
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta_g&lt;/math&gt; is the grid size and &lt;math&gt;C_s&lt;/math&gt; is a constant.

This method assumes that the energy production and dissipation of the small scales are in equilibrium - that is, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = \Pi&lt;/math&gt;.

===== Germano dynamic model =====

Germano et al.&lt;ref name="Germano_1991"&gt;{{cite journal
|title=A dynamic subgrid‐scale eddy viscosity model
|author1=Germano, M.
|author2=Piomelli, U.

|issue=7
|authorlink3=Parviz Moin }}
&lt;/ref&gt; identified a number of studies using the Smagorinsky model that each found different values for the Smagorinsky constant &lt;math&gt;C_s&lt;/math&gt; for different flow configurations.  In an attempt to formulate a more universal approach to SGS models, Germano et al. proposed a dynamic Smagorinsky model, which utilized two filters: a grid LES filter, denoted &lt;math&gt;\overline{\cdot}&lt;/math&gt;, and a test LES filter, denoted &lt;math&gt;\hat{\cdot}&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case, the resolved turbulent stress tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{L}_{ij} = T_{ij}^r - \hat{\tau}_{ij}^r
&lt;/math&gt;

which is also called the Germano identity.  The quantity &lt;math&gt;T_{ij}^r = \widehat{\overline{u_i u_j}} - \hat{\bar{u}}_i \hat{\bar{u}}_j&lt;/math&gt; is the residual stress tensor for the test filter scale, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\tau}_{ij}^r = \widehat{ \overline{ u_i u_j }} - \widehat{ \overline{u}_i \overline{u}_j }&lt;/math&gt; is the residual stress tensor for the grid filter, then test filtered.

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; represents the contribution to the SGS stresses by length scales smaller than the test filter width &lt;math&gt;\hat{\Delta}&lt;/math&gt; but larger than the grid filter width &lt;math&gt;\overline{\Delta}&lt;/math&gt;. The dynamic model then finds the coefficient that best complies with the Germano identity.
However, since the identity is a tensorial equation, it is overdetermined (five equations for one unknown), prompting Lilly
&lt;ref name="Lilly_1992"&gt;{{cite journal
|title=A proposed modification of the Germano subgrid-scale closure method

to propose a minimum least-square error method that leads to an equation for &lt;math&gt;C_s&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
C_s^2 = \frac{ \mathcal{L}_{ij} \mathcal{M}_{ij} }{ \mathcal{M}_{ij} \mathcal{M}_{ij} }
&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_{ij} 
= 2 \overline{\Delta}^2 \left( 
\overline{ \left| \hat{S} \right| \hat{S}_{ij} } 
- \alpha^2 \left| \overline{\hat{S}} \right| \overline{\hat{S}}_{ij}
\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \hat{\Delta} / \overline{\Delta}.&lt;/math&gt;

However, this procedure was numerically unstable since the numerator could become negative and large fluctuations in &lt;math&gt;C_s&lt;/math&gt; were often observed. Hence, additional averaging of the error in the minimization is often employed, leading to:

: &lt;math&gt;
C_s^2 = \frac{ 
\left\langle \mathcal{L}_{ij} \mathcal{M}_{ij} \right\rangle
}{ 
\left\langle \mathcal{M}_{ij} \mathcal{M}_{ij} \right\rangle
}
&lt;/math&gt;

This has made the dynamic model more stable and making the method more widely applicable. Inherent in the procedure is the assumption that the coefficient &lt;math&gt;C_s&lt;/math&gt; is invariant of scale (see review

==Causes==
LBW is either caused by [[preterm birth]] (that is, a low [[gestational age]] at birth, commonly defined as younger than 37 weeks of gestation) or the infant being [[small for gestational age]] (that is, a slow [[prenatal growth rate]]), or a combination of both.

In general, risk factors in the mother that may contribute to low birth weight include young ages, multiple pregnancies, previous LBW infants, poor nutrition, heart disease or [[hypertension]], untreated [[coeliac disease]], drug addiction, alcohol abuse, and insufficient [[prenatal care]]. Environmental risk factors include smoking, lead exposure, and other types of air pollutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umm.edu/pregnancy/000142.htm |title=Labor and delivery - Low Birth Weight |publisher=Umm.edu |date=2008-10-22 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TersigniCastellani2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tersigni|first1=C.|last2=Castellani|first2=R.|last3=de Waure|first3=C.|last4=Fattorossi|first4=A.|last5=De Spirito|first5=M.|last6=Gasbarrini|first6=A.|last7=Scambia|first7=G.|last8=Di Simone|first8=N.|title=Celiac disease and reproductive disorders: meta-analysis of epidemiologic associations and potential pathogenic mechanisms|journal=Human Reproduction Update|volume=20|issue=4|year=2014|pages=582–593|issn=1355-4786|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmu007|pmid=24619876}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SacconeBerghella2015&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Saccone G, Berghella V, Sarno L, Maruotti GM, Cetin I, Greco L, Khashan AS, McCarthy F, Martinelli D, Fortunato F, Martinelli P|title=Celiac disease and obstetric complications: a systematic review and metaanalysis |journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol |volume=214 |issue=2 |pages= 225–34|date= Oct 9, 2015 |pmid=26432464|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2015.09.080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preterm birth===
{{Further|Preterm birth}}
Four different pathways have been identified that can result in preterm birth and have considerable evidence: precocious fetal endocrine activation, uterine overdistension, decidual bleeding, and intrauterine inflammation/infection.&lt;ref name=Simham2007&gt;
{{cite journal

 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra050435
}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a practical point a number of factors have been identified that are associated with preterm birth, however, an association does not establish causality.

===Being small for gestational age===
{{Further|Small for gestational age}}
Being [[small for gestational age]] can be constitutional, that is, without an underlying pathological cause, or it can be secondary to [[intrauterine growth restriction]], which, in turn, can be secondary to many possible factors. For example, babies with [[congenital anomalies]] or [[chromosomal abnormalities]] are often associated with LBW. Problems with the [[placenta]] can prevent it from providing adequate oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Infections during pregnancy that affect the fetus, such as [[rubella]], [[cytomegalovirus]], [[toxoplasmosis]], and [[syphilis]], may also affect the baby's weight.

===Environmental factors===
While active [[Smoking and pregnancy|maternal tobacco smoking]] has well established adverse [[perinatal]] outcomes such as LBW, that mothers who smoke during pregnancy are twice as likely to give birth to low-birth weight infants. Review on the effects of passive maternal smoking, also called environmental tobacco exposure (ETS), demonstrated that increased risks of infants with LBW were more likely to be expected in ETS-exposed mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Knopik VS. Maternal smoking during pregnancy and child outcomes: real or spurious effect? Dev Neuropsychol. 2009;34(1):1-36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salmasi G, Grady R, Jones J, et al. Environmental tobacco smoke exposure and perinatal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analyses. Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand. 2010;89(4):423-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding [[environmental toxins in pregnancy]], elevated blood lead levels in pregnant women, even those well below 10&amp;nbsp;ug/dL can cause [[miscarriage]], [[premature birth]], and LBW in the offspring. With 10&amp;nbsp;ug/dL as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's “level of concern”, this cut-off value really needs to arise more attentions and implementations in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland LM, Minter ML, Cobb KA, et al. Lead hazards for pregnant women and children: part 1: immigrants and the poor shoulder most of the burden of lead exposure in this country. Part 1 of a two-part article details how exposure happens, whom it affects, and the harm it can do. Am J Nurs. 2008 Oct;108(10):40-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The combustion products of solid fuel in developing countries can cause many adverse health issues in people. Because a majority of pregnant women in developing countries, where rate of LBW is high, are heavily exposed to indoor air pollution, increased relative risk translates into substantial population attributable risk of 21% of LBW.&lt;ref&gt;Pope DP, Mishra V, Thompson L, et al.

One environmental exposure which has been found to increase the risk of low birth weight is [[Particulates|particulate matter]], a component of ambient [[air pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants|title=Criteria Air Pollutants|last=EPA, OAR|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because particulate matter is composed of extremely small particles, even nonvisible levels can be inhaled and present harm to the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/air/particulate_matter.html|title=CDC - Air Quality - Particle Pollution|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particulate matter exposure can cause inflammation, oxidative stress, endocrine disruption, and impaired oxygen transport access to the placenta,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erickson|first=Anders C.|last2=Arbour|first2=Laura|date=2014-11-26|title=The Shared Pathoetiological Effects of Particulate Air Pollution and the Social Environment on Fetal-Placental Development|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/901017|journal=Journal of Environmental and Public Health|language=en|volume=2014|pages=1–20|doi=10.1155/2014/901017|issn=1687-9805|pmc=4276595|pmid=25574176}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which are mechanisms for heightening the risk of low birth weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Pei-Chen|last2=Talbott|first2=Evelyn O.|last3=Roberts|first3=James M.|last4=Catov|first4=Janet M.|last5=Bilonick|first5=Richard A.|last6=Stone|first6=Roslyn A.|last7=Sharma|first7=Ravi K.|last8=Ritz|first8=Beate|date=2012-08-01|title=Ambient air pollution exposure and blood pressure changes during pregnancy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935112001818|journal=Environmental Research|volume=117|pages=46–53|doi=10.1016/j.envres.2012.05.011|pmc=3656658|pmid=22835955|bibcode=2012ER....117...46L}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce exposure to particulate matter, pregnant women can monitor the EPA’s [[Air quality index|Air Quality Index]] and take personal precautionary measures such as reducing outdoor activity on low quality days, avoiding high-traffic roads/intersections, and/or wearing personal protective equipment (i.e., facial mask of industrial design). Indoor exposure to particulate matter can also be reduced through adequate ventilation, as well as use of clean heating and cooking methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oar/particlepollution/|title=Particulate matter|last=|first=|date=May 19, 2009|website=EPA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/risk/recordisplay.cfm?deid=216546|title=2009 Final Report: Integrated Science Assessment for Particulate Matter|last=Group|first=US EPA National Center for Environmental Assessment, Research Triangle Park Nc, Environmental Media Assessment|last2=Sacks|first2=Jason|website=cfpub.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A correlation between maternal exposure to CO and low birth weight has been reported that the effect on birth weight of increased ambient CO was as large as the effect of the mother smoking a pack of cigarettes per day during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Lewtas J. Air pollution combustion emissions: characterization of causative agents and mechanisms associated with cancer, reproductive, and cardiovascular effects. Mutat Res. 2007 Nov-Dec;636(1-3):95-133.&lt;/ref&gt;  
It has been revealed that adverse reproductive effects (e.g., risk for LBW) were correlated with maternal exposure to air pollution combustion emissions in Eastern Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Townsend CL, Maynard RL |date=Oct 2002  | title = Effects on health of prolonged exposure to low concentrations of carbon monoxide | url = | journal = Occup Environ Med | volume = 59 | issue = 10| pages = 708–11 | doi=10.1136/oem.59.10.708 | pmid=12356933 | pmc=1740215}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mercury is a known toxic heavy metal that can harm fetal growth and health, and there has been evidence showing that exposure to mercury (via consumption of large [[oily fish]]) during pregnancy may be related to higher risks of LBW in the offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gochfeld M, Burger J |date=Aug 2005  | title = Good fish/bad fish: a composite benefit-risk by dose curve | url = | journal = Neurotoxicology | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 511–20 | doi=10.1016/j.neuro.2004.12.010|pmid=15979722  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was revealed that, exposure of pregnant women to airplane noise was found to be associated with low birth weight. Aircraft noise exposure caused adverse effects on fetal growth leading to low birth weight and preterm infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kawada T |date=Feb 2004  | title = The effect of noise on the health of children | url = | journal = J Nippon Med Sch. | volume = 71 | issue = 1| pages = 5–10 | doi=10.1272/jnms.71.5|pmid=15129589  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Matsui T, Matsuno T, Ashimine K, etal |date=Sep 2003  | title = Association between the rates of low birth-weight and/or preterm infants and aircraft noise exposure | url = | journal = Nippon Eiseigaku Zasshi | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 385–94 | doi=10.1265/jjh.58.385|pmid=14533568  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Periodontal health==
Low birthweight, pre-term birth and pre-eclampsia have been associated with maternal periodontitis exposure. But the strength of the observed associations is inconsistent and vary according to the population studied, the means of periodontal assessment and the periodontal disease classification employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanz|first1=M|title=Periodontitis and adverse pregnancy outcomes: consensus report of the Joint EFP/AAP Workshop on Periodontitis and Systemic Diseases|journal=J Periodontol|date=April 2013|volume=84|issue=4 suppl|page=S164–9|doi=10.1902/jop.2013.1340016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the best is that the risk of low birth weight can be reduced with very simple therapy. Treatment of periodontal disease during gestation period is safe and reduction in inflammatory burden reduces the risk of preterm birth as well as low birth weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shah|first1=Monali|title=Effect of nonsurgical periodontal therapy during gestation period on adverse pregnancy outcome: a systematic review|journal=J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med|date=November 2013|volume=26|issue=17|pages=1691–5|doi=10.3109/14767058.2013.799662|pmid=23617740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
LBW is closely associated with fetal and [[Perinatal mortality]] and [[Morbidity]], inhibited growth and cognitive development, and chronic diseases later in life. At the population level, the proportion of babies with a LBW is an indicator of a multifaceted public-health problem that includes long-term maternal malnutrition, ill health, hard work and poor health care in pregnancy. On an individual basis, LBW is an important predictor of newborn health and survival and is associated with higher risk of infant and childhood mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stevens-Simon C, Orleans M |date=Sep 1999  | title = Low-birthweight prevention programs: the enigma of failure | url = | journal = Birth | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 184–91 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-536x.1999.00184.x|pmid=10655819  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low birth weight constitutes as sixty to eighty percent of the [[infant mortality]] rate in developing countries. Infant mortality due to low birth weight is usually directly causal, stemming from other medical complications such as preterm birth, poor maternal nutritional status, lack of [[prenatal care]], maternal sickness during pregnancy, and an unhygienic home environment.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Andrews|first=K.M.|author2=Brouillette, D.B |author3=Brouillette, R.T. |encyclopedia=

==Epidemiology==
A study by the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ) found that of the 3.8 million births that occurred in the United States in 2011, approximately 6.1% (231,900) were diagnosed with low birth weight (&lt;2,500 g).  Approximately 49,300 newborns (1.3%) weighed less than 1,500 grams (VLBW).&lt;ref&gt;Kowlessar N.M., Jiang H.J., and Steiner C. Hospital Stays for Newborns, 2011. HCUP Statistical Brief #163.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3371">A '''nitrogen rejection unit''' (NRU) selectively removes [[nitrogen]] from a gas. The name can be applied to any system that removes nitrogen from [[natural gas]].

For high flow-rate applications, typically &gt;15 MMSCFD, [[cryogenic]] processing is the norm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chartindustries.com/Energy/Energy-Products/Nitrogen-Rejection Nitrogen Rejection]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a [[distillation]] process which utilizes the different volatilities of [[methane]] ([[boiling point]] of −161.6&amp;nbsp;°C) and [[nitrogen]] (boiling point of −195.69&amp;nbsp;°C) to achieve separation. In this process, a system of compression and distillation columns drastically reduces the temperature of the gas mixture to a point where methane is liquified and the nitrogen is not. For smaller applications, a series of heat exchangers may be used as an alternative to distillation columns.

For smaller volumes of gas, a system utilizing [[Pressure Swing Adsorption]] (PSA) is a more typical method of separation.  In PSA, methane and nitrogen can be separated by using an adsorbent with an aperture size very close to the molecular diameter of the larger species, in this case methane (3.8 [[angstroms]]). This means nitrogen is able to diffuse through the adsorbent, filling adsorption sites, whilst methane is not. This results in a purified natural gas stream that fits pipeline specifications. The adsorbent can then be regenerated, leaving a highly pure nitrogen stream. PSA is a flexible method for nitrogen rejection, being applied to both small and large flow rates.

The operating conditions of various PSA units are quite variable.  Depending on the vendor, high degrees of pretreatment of the gas stream (removal of water vapor and heavy hydrocarbons) may be necessary for the system to operate optimally and without damage to the adsorbent material.  Moreover, the degree of hydrocarbon recoveries (75% vs 95%) and purities can vary considerably.  The economic viability of any PSA unit will be highly dependent on such factors.

An estimated 25% of the US natural gas reserves contain unacceptably large quantities of nitrogen.  Nitrogen is inert and lowers the energy value per volume of natural gas.  It also takes up capacity in pipelines that could be used for valuable methane.

Pipeline specifications for nitrogen are extremely variable, though "no more than 4% nitrogen" seems to be the most typical specification.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

'''ONE Gas, Inc.''' is a stand-alone, 100 percent regulated, publicly traded [[natural gas]] utility and is one of the largest natural gas utilities in the United States. 

ONE Gas provides natural gas distribution services to more than 2 million customers in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. Headquartered in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], it comprises three operating companies–[[Oklahoma Natural Gas]], Kansas Gas Service, and Texas Gas Service. Its service territory covers most of Oklahoma, much of the eastern half of Kansas, and several disparate portions of Texas.

Its largest natural gas distribution markets by customer count are Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Okla.; Kansas City, Wichita and Topeka, Kan.; and Austin and El Paso, Texas. ONE Gas serves residential, commercial, industrial, transportation and wholesale customers in all three states. It is the largest natural gas distributor in Oklahoma and Kansas, and the third-largest in Texas, in terms of customer count.

ONE Gas was founded in February 2014 when [[ONEOK]] spun off its distribution subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2014-01-09/oneok-spinning-off-natural-gas-distribution-ops |title=Oneok spinning off natural gas distribution ops |publisher=Businessweek |date=2014-01-09 |accessdate=2014-04-17|archivedate=2014-01-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110024319/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2014-01-09/oneok-spinning-off-natural-gas-distribution-ops}}&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, ONEOK was spinning out the core of the original Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, which was founded in 1906 and changed its name to ONEOK in 1980.

'''Omnishale process''' (also known as the ''Petro Probe process'') is an ''[[in situ]]'' [[shale oil extraction]] technology to convert [[kerogen]] in [[oil shale]] to [[shale oil]]. This process is classified as an externally generated hot gas technology.  The technology is developed by General Synfuels International, a subsidiary of Earth Search Sciences.&lt;ref name=ess090610&gt;

==History==
The Omnishale shale oil extraction ''in situ'' technology was invented by Ron McQueen and developed and tested by Petro Probe and General Synfuels International.  On 11 October 2005, a subsidiary of Earth Search Sciences Petro Probe acquired an unlimited license to use Omnishale shale oil extraction technology developed by General Synfuels International, Inc. On 15 August 2008, Earth Search Sciences acquired General Synfuels International and oil shale activities of Petro Probe were transferred to General Synfuels International. In 2009, General Synfuels International started a cooperation with [[Anadarko Petroleum]].&lt;ref name=trib&gt;

==Technology==
The Omnishale shale oil extraction ''in situ'' technology of Earth Search Sciences was invented by Ron McQueen and developed by Petro Probe and General Synfuels International. In this process, holes are drilled into the oil shale formation and a processing inlet conduit is placed within holes. Pressurized air super heated by an above-ground combustor is directed into the oil shale formation through the inlet conduit. As a result, the kerogen in oil shale is heated and converted to a gaseous state.&lt;ref name=patriot/&gt;&lt;ref name=DOE&gt;

[[File:UVLM simulation of an aircraft model.png|thumb|Simulation of a flying airplane in Open VOGEL]]
'''Open VOGEL'''&lt;ref&gt;The Open VOGEL community (www.openvogel.com)&lt;/ref&gt; is an open source computer program intended for the simulation of aerodynamic problems through the [[Vortex lattice method|Unsteady Vortex Lattice Method]] and first order singularity panels (vortex rings, flat doublet panels and flat source/sink panels).
The code has been fully developed in the .NET framework using [[Visual Studio Express]] and it is published under [[General Public License]], [[GPLv3]].

The Open VOGEL framework consists in a library of models (which includes slender surfaces, fuselages and other components), a set of [[winforms]]-based [[GUI]] tools, a calculation core with generalized definitions based in [[potential flow]] and a main frame that manages all the components.

The novel feature of Open VOGEL is that users can add their own models to the library, and expand that way the general capabilities of the software or adapt it for a specific purpose. In that sense, the software acts as a basic framework for research applications. 
Any university, research facility or individual in the world is authorized to take the source code, improve it and release it under GPLv3 for further use in the aeronautical community.

The idea behind this way of working is that those who use the software for practical applications can directly benefit from what researchers are achieving, so that their results can be directly put into practice.

== Modelling ==
[[File:Evaluation of two different models.png|thumb|Within the limitations of discrete potential flow modelling, Open VOGEL allows designers to quickly evaluate multiple configurations in the early design stages.]]
One of the key features of Open VOGEL is that it provides built-in tools intended to facilitate the creation of geometrical models. Each component is defined in a parametric way, and the software resolves the geometry to generate a suitable mesh optimized for the calculation core.

Open VOGEL currently allows three types of models: slender lifting surfaces, closed fuselages and jet engine nacelles (tubular cylinders).

=== Slender surfaces ===

Slender surfaces are bounded lattices specifically intended to simulate wings. The actual model can be viewed as a paper sheet, but their behavior approaches very well to that of thin wings. Open VOGEL employs this kind of surfaces because they require less than a half of the number of panels required to generate a full 3D model, while they achieve very good results in the prediction of the main air-loads (lift, induced drag and parasitic drag through an experimental polar curve).

Open VOGEL lets designers construct wings by shaping a set of adjacent quadrilateral macro-panels. The software contains a built-in tool to manage the main geometrical parameters (such as dihedral, sweepback, profile and twisting) of each of these macro-panels. This allows users to recreate a very wide variety of models.

Lifting surfaces are modeled with an [[structured grid]] characterized by a constant number of chord-wise panels. The user is allowed to refine the mesh by changing the number of chord-wise and span-wise panels.
When lifting surfaces are introduced to the calculation model, they are modeled as slender panels. This means that Neumann's boundary conditions (BC) are imposed, and that the lift becomes dependent on the change in tangent velocity across the panel.

=== Fuselages ===
[[File:Fuselage mapping.png|thumb|Anchor regions are mapped to a 2D rectangle in order to generate an structured grid.]]
Fuselages in Open VOGEL are lofted surfaces generated from a collection of parallel cross-sections distributed in a longitudinal direction. The resulting mesh is generated by connecting nodal points uniformly distributed around the outline of several virtual cross sections, which are computed by linear interpolation between the user-defined cross-sections.

One or more lifting surfaces can be attached to a fuselage by means of features called ''anchors''. An anchor is a set of slender panels that belong to the fuselage and serve as a bridge between the root of a wing and the panels of the fuselage. Anchors are needed to provide a transition in the circulation of both surfaces, i.e., to properly model a physical connection between both of them. Without anchors, the gap between the two surfaces would leak, creating regions of very high airspeed and a consequent wrong prediction of the air-loads.

The orientation and position of fuselages can be changed as with any other surface, but if one or more lifting surfaces are attached to it, the anchors will only work properly if the fuselage is kept in the original position and orientation (no translation nor rotation applied).
Anchoring two or more surfaces to a fuselage is only possible when the surfaces are sufficiently staggered so that they don't share any plane transverse to the fuselage. This limitation is a pure consequence of the meshing technique. When meshing a fuselage, each anchored lifting surface is assigned to a longitudinal chunk of fuselage that is meshed apart, so that the number of longitudinal panels in that longitudinal band matches the number of chord-wise panels of the wing. This method has been represented in the picture here beside.

=== Fan ducts ===

Fan ducts (or jet-engine nacelles) can also be added to the model. In the calculation core these surfaces are managed as slender surfaces, with the exception that drag is not computed.

== Calculation capabilities ==

Because Open VOGEL is based in the Unsteady Vortex Lattice Method, it can simulate steady and unsteady problems. The unsteady solver is not only used to simulate gusts, but it is the core of the aeroelastic module. By linking a structural FE model with the UVLM, Open VOGEL can also simulate the unsteady transit of flexible wings and the deformation of wings in the steady state.

=== The aerodynamic calculation core ===

==== Introduction ====
Open VOGEL relies on an [[object-oriented]] multi-threading calculation core (CC). The aerodynamic part of the CC (the ACC) is based in hierarchical structure of classes that begins with the definition of ''vortex rings'', which in turn, can be assembled together as bricks to form a ''lattice''.

Lattices can be of two types: "bounded" or "free". Bounded lattices represent all solid boundaries where boundary conditions have to be imposed, while free lattices represent the wakes shed by the bounded lattices. Because of this parent-child relation, each bounded lattice contains a stack of wakes that can be automatically shed by its parent bounded lattice based on information about the primitive shedding edges.

Boundary conditions are imposed at vortex ring level. Vortex rings can be triangular or quadrilateral, but most importantly, they can be slender or solid. On slender rings, [[Neumann boundary conditions]] are imposed, while on solid rings, [[Dirichlet boundary conditions]] are imposed. Imposing one BC or the other implies calculating the local velocity or the local velocity potential.

The calculation of the velocity and the velocity potential at a given point is encapsulated inside the class definition of the vortex rings. The method that is actually implemented differ from the topology of the inducing ring (triangular or quadrilateral). Each lattice exposes then a method that allows the same calculation at lattice level by running over all contained rings.

The ACC will impose the boundary conditions by solving a system of linear equations. In a rigid model-problem, it will build a unique matrix of coefficients, generate the LU decomposition, and reuse that same matrices to find the circulation in the rings at every time step. For aeroelastic simulations, however, because the relative position of the rings is permanently changing due to the deformation of the lattices, the CC will recalculate the influence matrix and LU decomposition at each time step.

The right hand side of the system of equations containing the free-velocity and source-potential terms, is only updated at each time for unsteady problems.

==== The math behind the software ====

Because Open VOGEL deals with several types of panels and boundary conditions, the math and the implemented algorithms are a bit more complex than those required when only working with vortex rings.

The basic problem when dealing with vortex rings is to find out the circulation associated to the rings where the non-penetration boundary condition has to be imposed (the bounded lattices). Because the velocity associated to a vortex ring at a given point depends linearly on the circulation of that ring, a system of linear equations can be written, so that when solved, it will provide the value of the local circulations that will cancel the normal velocity at each control point. The matrix problem for this situation can be found in the article about the [[vortex lattice method]].

Now, when closed bodies such as fuselages need to be modeled, the total potential inside the body is required to equal a given constant value (typically chosen as zero).
This is a different kind of problem that requires, first of all, calculating the potential of sink/source and doublet panels at a given point located immediately under the surface of the body, and secondly, arranging the new system of equations in the global matrix problem.

The calculation of the velocity potential associated to constant sink/source panels and vortex rings (constant doublets) at a given point in space is quite complex. Open VOGEL reduces the complexity level by projecting the quadrilateral panels in its normal direction, so that they can be represented by a flat panel (triangular panels do not need to be projected since they are always flat). The calculation of the velocity potential under such situation can be found in this reference.&lt;ref&gt;"Low speed aerodynamics", Allen Plotkin, Joseph Katz&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, this method has some associated leakage, which depends on how well panels are approach by their flat counterpart.

When working with sink/source panels, the intensity vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt; associated to them is not an unknown. In fact, when the internal potential is targeted to zero, their intensity depends on the value of the normal free air-stream velocity:

&lt;math&gt;s_i = - \mathbf{V}_\infty \cdot \mathbf{n}_i&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the unit potential corresponding to each one of them at each control point can be calculated once and stored in a source/sink potential matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}_s&lt;/math&gt;. This matrix is then reused to compute the total sink/source potential when necessary as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\varphi}_s = \mathbf{M}_s \mathbf{s}&lt;/math&gt;

The unknowns of the Dirichlet problem are the doublet intensities of each panel surrounding the body, represented here by vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d}&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly to the sources, we can write a matrix of unit-intensity potential associated to them:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\varphi}_d = \mathbf{M}_d \mathbf{d}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the potential associated to the wakes needs to be added. Because wakes are constantly changing their shape, in place of building a matrix, we rather include their potential as a summation of individual contributions:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\varphi}_w = \sum_{j=1}^N \varphi_{wi}&lt;/math&gt;

Because wakes are shed from lifting surfaces, their potential is only associated to constant doublet panels of known intensity. When wake panels are far enough from the body, they can be approached by point doublets, which have much simpler potential functions. This solution is known as ''the far field potential''.

The Dirichlet problem is then represented by the next system or linear equations

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}_d \mathbf{d} = - \mathbf{M}_s \mathbf{s} - \sum_{j=1}^N \varphi_{wi}&lt;/math&gt;

which needs to be assembled and solved together with the Neumann problem in a global matrix problem.

==== Multi-threading operation ====

When the velocity or velocity-potential has to be calculated at all control points in a bounded lattice, a [[Multithreading (software)|multi-threading]] operation is started: for each control point in the targeting lattice, all rings from all bounded lattices and associated wakes are run over in an isolated thread. This multi-threading system allows running several vortex rings simultaneously, what considerably reduces the calculation time in multiple-cores machines. The reduction of time is proportional to the number of processors in the machine.

The next lines of code show how the parallelization works.

=== Aeroelastic capabilities ===

Open VOGEL counts with an integrated aeroelastic module that allows treating the interaction between a beam-based structure and a slender surface.
This interaction is simulated by [[dynamic mode decomposition]] and numerical integration in the time-domain.

A '''paint sealant''' is a [[sealant]] that protects cars from [[ultraviolet]] rays and [[acid rain]]. Paint sealants protect cars' finishes, and can make cars shiny. There are synthetic sealants and [[carnauba]] waxes.

Salt may be a factor that many protective sealants do not defend against, and thus salt water may break down protective layers to get at the metal and corrode it.

'''Paint sealant''' works by filling into the pores and irregular surface of the body thereby creating a smooth finish on top. The way it helps is it denies a sticking surface to foreign substance and they come off the car easily without further damaging the car surface

[[Carbon fiber]] is often time produced using two main methods: through the use of Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and from pitch.&lt;ref name = "Matsumoto 1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Matsumoto | first1 = T | year = 1995 | title = Mesophase pitch and its carbon fibers | url = http://pac.iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/1985/pdf/5711x1553.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Pure and Applied Chemistry | volume =  | issue = | page = | doi = 10.1351/pac198557111553 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;Yamamoto, I., Fukagawa, T., and Muroi, M., Pitch based carbon fibers, United States Patent Office, 1999.

(http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a244780.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pitch (resin)|Pitch]] is a viscoelastic material that is composed of aromatic hydrocarbons. Pitch is produced via the distillation of carbon-based materials, such as plants, crude oil, and coal.&lt;ref name="Matsumoto 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dtic.mil"/&gt; Pitch is isotropic, but can be made anisotropic through the use of heat treatments. However, the most important in carbon fiber production is [[mesophase]] pitch due to the ability to melt spin anisotropic mesophase pitch without filament breakage.

The mesophase pitch forms a [[thermotropic crystal]], which allows the pitch to become organized and form linear chains without the use of tension. Mesophase pitch is made by polymerizing isotropic pitch to a higher molecular weight. The melting point for the mesophase pitch is roughly 300&amp;nbsp;°C. An advantage in the production of Pitch carbon fibers over PAN carbon fibers is that Pitch carbon fibers do not require constant tension on the fibers at all processing stages. Pitch based carbon fibers have been found to be more sheet-like in their crystal structure, as opposed to PAN based carbon fibers, which are more granular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huang | first1 = Y. | last2 = Young | first2 = R.J. | year = 1995 | title = Effect of Fibre Microstructure upon the Modulus of PAN- and Pitch-based Carbon Fiber | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000862239400109D# | journal = Carbon | volume =  33| issue = | pages =  97–107| doi=10.1016/0008-6223(94)00109-D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four main steps in the production of carbon fiber from pitch 1) melt spinning 2) oxidization/precarbonization 3) carbonization and 4) graphitization.&lt;ref name="Matsumoto 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Singer | first1 = L.S. | year = 1978 | title = The mesophase and high modulus carbon fibers from pitch | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0008622378900854 | journal = Carbon | volume =  16| issue = | pages =  409–415| doi=10.1016/0008-6223(78)90085-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Singer | first1 = L.S. | year = 1981 | title = Carbon fibres from mesophase pitch | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0016236181901472 | journal = Fuel | volume =  60| issue = | pages =  839–847| doi=10.1016/0016-2361(81)90147-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1) [[Melt spinning]] is the method of forming fibers through the rapid cooling of a melt; due to the fast rates of cooling, the mesophase pitch is able to become highly oriented. Mesophase pitch can be melt spun, but because of its flow characteristics the process can be difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Huang, X., Fabrication and Properties of Carbon Fibers, Materials, 2009. (http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/2/4/2369)&lt;/ref&gt; The viscosity of mesophase pitch is more sensitive to temperature than other melt-spun materials. Therefore, during the creation of pitch based fibers the temperature and heat transfer rate must be carefully controlled.

2) Oxidization/Precarbonization is used in order to cross-link the fibers to the point where they cannot be melted or fused together.&lt;ref name="Matsumoto 1995"/&gt; This step is extremely important because it produces fibers that are stable at the high temperatures of carbonization and graphitization; otherwise, the fibers would fail in those steps of the process.

3) [[Carbonization]] is the process removing all nonorganic elements. In the case of carbon fibers, all elements except for carbon are removed. This is achieved by heating the fibers to high temperatures in an environment without oxygen.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewis | first1 = I.C. | year = 1982 | title = Chemistry of Carbonization | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0008622382900896 | journal = Carbon | volume =  20| issue = | pages =  519–529| doi=10.1016/0008-6223(82)90089-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This step removes all impurities from the fibers and leaves crystalline carbon structures. These structures are mostly hexagonal in shape and are composed of entirely carbon.

4) Graphitization is the process of treating the fibers at high temperatures in order to improve the alignment and orientation of the crystalline regions along the fiber direction [1,8]. Having the crystalline regions aligned, stacked, and oriented along the fiber direction increases the overall strength of the carbon fiber.

The high strength of carbon fiber can be attributed to these four main processes. Having high levels of crystalline regions allows the fibers to withstand high levels of stress. These crystalline regions are formed via the melt spinning process; the crystals are stiff areas that do not deform when an external stress is applied. Orienting and aligning these crystalline regions gives further strength to the fibers, specifically if the orientation is along the fiber axis. Carbonization and graphitization are the two processes responsible for this alignment of the crystalline regions. Pitch based carbon fiber is lower in strength than [[fiberglass]]; however, it has a very high [[elastic modulus]].

Pitch-based carbon fibers have various end uses due to their high strength. These fibers are used within the aerospace industry due to their high modulus and higher price{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}. These fibers could be used within the automotive and sports industries, but the cheaper PAN based carbon fibers provide a high enough strength for these applications.

The '''[[Blade pitch|pitch]] [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]''', also named blade bearing, is a component of modern [[wind turbine]]s which connect the rotor hub and the rotor blade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/0470846062|title=Wind Energy Handbook - Burton - Wiley Online Library|last=Burton|first=Tony|last2=Sharpe|first2=David|last3=Jenkins|first3=Nick|last4=Bossanyi|first4=Ervin|language=en|doi=10.1002/0470846062}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bearing allows the required oscillation to control the loads and power of the wind turbine.

Mostly large [[Rolling-element bearing|rolling element bearing]] are used as pitch bearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:hbp1QJyfdosJ:citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.610.8882&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=de&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=de|title=Wind Turbine Design Guideline DG03: Yaw and Pitch Rolling Bearing Life|last=NREL|first=T.

== Load situation ==

The load and operating situation of pitch bearings are for rolling element bearings comparatively unfavorable. The bearings are exposed to high loads and small [[Reciprocating motion|reciprocating]] movements created by the pitch system or [[vibration]]s from the [[Wind|wind profile]]. The small reciprocating movements between rolling elements and raceway can lead to wear phenomena like [[false brinelling]] and [[Fretting|fretting corrosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316543220_Time-dependent_analyses_of_wear_in_oscillating_bearing_applications|title=Time-dependent analyses of wear in oscillating bearing applications (PDF Download Available)|last=Schwack|first=Fabian|last2=Artjom|first2=Byckov|date=|website=ResearchGate|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-19|last3=Bader|first3=Norbert|last4=Poll|first4=Gerhard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the high loads can lead to [[Truncation (geometry)|truncation]] of the contact ellipse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308890408_Free_Contact_Angles_in_Pitch_Bearings_and_their_Impact_on_Contact_and_Stress_Conditions|title=Free Contact Angles in Pitch Bearings and their Impact on Contact and Stress Conditions (PDF Download Available)|last=Schwack|first=Fabian|last2=Stammler|first2=Matthias|date=|website=ResearchGate|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-19|last3=Flory|first3=Heiko|last4=Poll|first4=Gerhard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the small reciprocating movements calculation methods to estimate the [[Fatigue (material)|bearing service life]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwack|first=F.|last2=Stammler|first2=M.|last3=Poll|first3=G.|last4=Reuter|first4=A.|date=2016|title=Comparison of Life Calculations for Oscillating Bearings Considering Individual Pitch Control in Wind Turbines|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1742-6596/753/i=11/a=112013|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series|language=en|volume=753|issue=11|pages=112013|doi=10.1088/1742-6596/753/11/112013|issn=1742-6596}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[friction torque]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stammler|first=Matthias|last2=Schwack|first2=Fabian|last3=Bader|first3=Norbert|last4=Reuter|first4=Andreas|last5=Poll|first5=Gerhard|title=Friction  torque  of  wind-turbine  pitch  bearings &amp;amp;ndash; comparison  of  experimental results with available models|url=https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-2017-20|journal=Wind Energy Science Discussions|pages=1–16|doi=10.5194/wes-2017-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; are not usable for pitch bearings.

'''Pixels per inch''' ('''ppi''') or '''pixels per centimeter''' ('''ppcm''') are measurements of the '''[[pixel]] density''' (resolution) of an electronic image device, such as a [[computer displays|computer monitor]] or [[television]] display, or image digitizing device such as a [[digital photography|camera]] or [[image scanner]]. Horizontal and vertical density are usually the same, as most devices have [[square pixel]]s, but differ on devices that have non-square pixels.

Pixels per inch (or pixels per centimeter) can also describe the resolution, in pixels, of an image file. A 100×100 pixel image printed in a 1&amp;nbsp;inch square has a resolution of 100 pixels per inch. Used this way, the measurement is meaningful when printing an image. It has become commonplace to refer to PPI as [[dots per inch|DPI]], even though PPI refers to input resolution. Industry standard, good quality photographs usually require 300&amp;nbsp;pixels per inch, at 100% size, when printed onto [[coated paper]] stock, using a printing screen of 150 [[lines per inch]] (lpi). This delivers a [[quality factor]] of 2, which is optimum. The lowest acceptable quality factor is considered 1.5, which equates to printing a 225&amp;nbsp;ppi image using a 150&amp;nbsp;lpi screen onto coated paper. {{Citation needed|reason=No definitions for quality factor numbers, who claims it is optimum quality, more on talk page|date=August 2013}}

Screen frequency is determined by the type of paper the image is printed on. An absorbent paper surface, uncoated recycled paper for instance, lets ink droplets spread (dot gain)—so requires a more open printing screen. Input resolution can therefore be reduced to minimize file size without loss in quality, as long as the quality factor of 2 is maintained. This is easily determined by doubling the line frequency. For example, printing on an uncoated paper stock often limits printing screen frequency to no more than 120&amp;nbsp;lpi, therefore, a quality factor of 2 is achieved with images of 240&amp;nbsp;ppi.

[[Image:Square 200x200.svg|right|frame|The outside of the square shown above is 200&amp;nbsp;pixels by 200&amp;nbsp;pixels. To determine a monitor's ppi, set the OS DPI scaling setting at 100% and the browser's zoom at 100%, then measure the width and height, in inches, of the square as displayed on a given monitor. Dividing 200 by the measured width or height gives the monitor's horizontal or vertical ppi, respectively, at the current screen resolution.]]

== Computer displays ==
The PPI of a [[computer display]] is related to the size of the display in [[inch]]es and the total number of [[pixel]]s in the horizontal and vertical directions. This measurement is often referred to as [[dots per inch]], though that measurement more accurately refers to the resolution of a [[computer printer]].

For example, a 15-inch (38&amp;nbsp;cm) display whose dimensions work out to 12&amp;nbsp;inches (30.48&amp;nbsp;cm) wide by 9&amp;nbsp;inches (22.86&amp;nbsp;cm) high, capable of a maximum 1024×768 (or [[XGA]]) pixel resolution, can display around 85&amp;nbsp;PPI in both the horizontal and vertical directions. This figure is determined by dividing the width (or height) of the display area in pixels by the width (or height) of the display area in inches. It is possible for a display to have different horizontal and vertical PPI measurements (e.g., a typical 4:3&amp;nbsp;ratio CRT monitor showing a 1280×1024 mode computer display at maximum size, which is a 5:4&amp;nbsp;ratio, not quite the same as 4:3). The apparent PPI of a monitor depends upon the screen resolution (that is, the number of pixels) and the size of the screen in use; a monitor in 800×600 mode has a lower PPI than does the same monitor in a 1024×768 or 1280×960 mode.

The [[dot pitch]] of a computer display determines the absolute limit of possible pixel density.
Typical circa-2000 [[cathode ray tube]] or [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] computer displays range from 67 to 130&amp;nbsp;PPI, though desktop monitors have exceeded 200&amp;nbsp;PPI and contemporary small-screen mobile devices often exceed 300&amp;nbsp;PPI, sometimes by a wide margin.

In January 2008, [[Kopin Corporation]] announced a 0.44&amp;nbsp;inch (1.12&amp;nbsp;cm) [[SVGA]] LCD with a pixel density of 2272&amp;nbsp;PPI (each pixel only 11.25μm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://optics.org/cws/article/industry/32411 | title=Kopin unveils smallest color SVGA display | publisher=optics.org | date=11 January 2008 | accessdate=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[Holography]] applications demand even greater pixel density, as higher pixel density produces a larger image size and wider viewing angle. [[Spatial light modulator]]s can reduce pixel pitch to 2.5&amp;nbsp;[[μm]], giving a pixel density of 10,160&amp;nbsp;PPI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://144.206.159.178/ft/CONF/16427337/16427346.pdf Horizontally scanning holography to enlarge both image size and viewing zone angle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120084833/http://144.206.159.178/ft/CONF/16427337/16427346.pdf |date=2013-01-20 }} Naoya Okada and Yasuhiro Takaki, Proc. SPIE Vol. 7233 723309-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Some observations indicate that the unaided human generally can't differentiate detail beyond 300 PPI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://prometheus.med.utah.edu/~bwjones/2010/06/apple-retina-display/ | title=Apple Retina Display | publisher=Jonesblog | date=24 June 2010 | accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this figure depends both on the distance between viewer and image, and the viewer’s [[visual acuity]].  The human eye also responds in a different way to a bright, evenly lit interactive display from how it does to prints on paper.

High pixel density display technologies would make [[Supersampling|supersampled antialiasing]] obsolete, enable true [[WYSIWYG]] graphics and, potentially enable a practical “[[paperless office]]” era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/443/wisnieff.html | title=Electronic displays for information technology | publisher=IBM Journal of Research and Development Volume 44, Number 3, 2000 | date=10 November 1999 | accessdate=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For perspective, such a device at 15&amp;nbsp;inch (38&amp;nbsp;cm) [[Visual display unit#Diagonal size|screen size]] would have to display more than four [[Full HD]] screens (or [[WQUXGA]] resolution).

Development of a display with ~900&amp;nbsp;ppi allows for three pixels with 16-bit color to act as sub-pixels to form a ''pixel cluster''. These pixel clusters act as regular pixels at ~300&amp;nbsp;ppi to produce a 48-bit color display.

The PPI pixel density specification of a display is also useful for calibrating a monitor with a printer. Software can use the PPI measurement to display a document at "actual size" on the screen.

=== Calculation of monitor PPI ===
[[File:Display resolution and pixel density.png|thumb]]
Theoretically, PPI can be calculated from knowing the diagonal size of the screen in inches and the resolution in pixels (width and height). This can be done in two steps:

1. Calculate diagonal resolution in pixels using the [[Pythagorean theorem]]:

:&lt;math&gt;d_p = \sqrt{w_p^2 + h_p^2}&lt;/math&gt;

2. Calculate PPI:

:&lt;math&gt;PPI = \frac{d_p}{d_i}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;d_p&lt;/math&gt; is diagonal resolution in pixels
* &lt;math&gt;w_p&lt;/math&gt; is width resolution in pixels
* &lt;math&gt;h_p&lt;/math&gt; is height resolution in pixels
* &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; is diagonal size in inches (this is the number advertised as the size of the display).

For example, :
* For a 21.5&amp;nbsp;inch (54.61&amp;nbsp;cm) screen with a 1920×1080 resolution (in which &lt;math&gt;w_p&lt;/math&gt; = 1920, &lt;math&gt;h_p&lt;/math&gt; = 1080 and &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; = 21.5), we get 102.46&amp;nbsp;PPI;
* For a typical 10.1&amp;nbsp;inch [[netbook]] screen with a 1024×600 resolution (in which &lt;math&gt;w_p&lt;/math&gt; = 1024, &lt;math&gt;h_p&lt;/math&gt; = 600 and &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; = 10.1), we get 117.5&amp;nbsp;PPI.
* For 27 inch screen with a 2560x1440 resolution we get &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{2560^2 + 1440^2}}{27}&lt;/math&gt; = 108.8&amp;nbsp;PPI.
Note that these calculations may not be very precise. Frequently, screens advertised as “X inch screen” can have their real physical dimensions of viewable area differ, for example:
* [[Apple Inc.]] advertised their mid-2011 [[iMac]] as a "21.5&amp;nbsp;inch (viewable) [...] display,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apple.com/imac/specs.html Apple iMac Tech Specs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018210809/http://www.apple.com/imac/specs.html |date=2012-10-18 }}, [[Apple Inc.]]. Accessed on 27 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but its actual viewable area is 545.22&amp;nbsp;mm or 21.465 inches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.displayalliance.com/storage/1-spec-sheets/LM215WF3-SDA1.pdf LM215WF3 LCD Product Specification], [[LG Display]]. Accessed on 27 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The more precise figure increases the calculated PPI from 102.46 (using 21.5) to 102.63.
* The [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] LP2065 20&amp;nbsp;inch (50.8&amp;nbsp;cm) monitor has an actual viewable area of 20.1&amp;nbsp;inch (51&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref&gt;[http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF06a/382087-382087-64283-72270-444767-1815933.html HP LP2065 20-inch (50.8&amp;nbsp;cm) LCD Monitor - Specifications and Warranty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410202021/http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF06a/382087-382087-64283-72270-444767-1815933.html |date=2008-04-10 }} ([[Hewlett-Packard Company]] official website)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Calculating PPI of camera view screens ===
Camera manufacturers often quote view screens in 'number of dots'.  This is not the same as the number of pixels, because there are 3 'dots' per pixel – red, green and blue. For example, the Canon 50d is quoted as having 920,000&amp;nbsp;dots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos50d/ dpreview.com, Canon EOS 50d]&lt;/ref&gt;  This translates as 307,200&amp;nbsp;pixels (x3 = 921,600&amp;nbsp;dots).  Thus the screen is 640×480 pixels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/21/a-quick-psa-on-dots-versus-pixels-in-lcds/ Techcrunch.com, dots vs pixels]&lt;/ref&gt;

This must be taken into account when working out the PPI.  Using the above calculations requires the screen's dimensions, but other methods require the total pixels, not total dots. 'Dots' and 'pixels' are often confused in reviews and specs when viewing information about digital cameras specifically.

== Scanners and cameras ==
"PPI" or "pixel density" may also describe [[image scanner]] resolution. In this context, PPI is synonymous with [[samples per inch]]. In digital photography, pixel density is the number of pixels divided by the area of the sensor. A typical [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|DSLR]], circa 2013, has 1–6.2 MP/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; a typical compact has 20–70&amp;nbsp;MP/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

For example, [[Sony Alpha SLT-A58]] has 20.1&amp;nbsp;megapixels on an APS-C sensor having 6.2&amp;nbsp;MP/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; since a compact camera like Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX50V has 20.4&amp;nbsp;megapixels on an 1/2.3" sensor having 70&amp;nbsp;MP/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The professional camera has a lower PPI than a compact camera, because it has larger photodiodes due to having far larger sensors.

== Smartphones ==
[[Smartphone]]s use small displays, but modern smartphone displays have a larger PPI rating, such as the [[Samsung Galaxy S7]] with a quad HD display at 577 PPI, Fujitsu F-02G with a quad HD display at 564 PPI,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itmedia.co.jp/mobile/articles/1410/07/news140.html |title=富士通が最新のドコモスマホやタブレットを披露　5G通信の取り組みも |author=村上万純 |date=October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[LG G6]] with quad HD display at 564 PPI or – XHDPI or [[Oppo Find 7]] with 534 PPI on 5.5" display – XXHDPI (see section below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/02/12/oppo-find-7-2k-1080p-variants/ |title=Oppo's next smartphone due in March with 2K and 1080p display options |author=Richard Lai |date=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sony Mobile|Sony]]'s [[Sony Xperia XZ Premium|Xperia XZ Premium]] has a [[4K resolution|4K]] display with a pixel density of 807 PPI, the highest of any smartphone as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_xz_premium-8593.php|title=Sony Xperia XZ Premium - Full phone specifications|website=www.gsmarena.com|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Named pixel densities ==
The [[Google]] [[Android (operating system)|Android]] developer documentation&lt;ref&gt;[http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources.html#AlternativeResources Providing Resources, Android Developers]&lt;/ref&gt; groups displays by their approximate pixel densities&lt;ref&gt;[https://material.io/devices/ Material Design - Device Metrics]&lt;/ref&gt; into the following categories:

The digital publishing industry primarily uses "pixels per inch" but sometimes "pixels per centimeter" is used or a conversion factor is given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.washington.edu/accessit/webdesign/student/unit4/module2/web_graphics_basics.htm| title=Web Graphics Basics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.utads.com/ad_specs/glossary.html| title=Utads.com Glossary of Terms}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monarda.se/extra/ppi-test/ppitest_english.htm| title=Resolution, dpi and ppi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] image file format only allows the meter as the unit for pixel density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#11pHYs| title=PNG file format, pHYs chunk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Image file format support ==

The following table show how pixel density is supported by popular image file formats. In the second column, "length" refers to horizontal and vertical size in inches, centimeters, etc., whereas "pixel" refers only to the number of pixels found along the horizontal and vertical dimension. The cell colors used do not indicate how feature-rich a certain image file format is, but what density support can be expected of a certain image file format. Often-used image file formats that do not support pixel density are added for counter-example purposes.

Even though image manipulation software can optionally set density for some image file formats, not many other software uses density information when displaying images. Web browsers, for example, ignore any density information. Named pixel densities is used mainly for browsers and mobile apps. As the table shows, support for density information in image file formats varies enormously and should be used with great care in a controlled context.

A '''power flash''' is a flash of light caused by arcing electrical discharges from damaged electrical equipment, most often severed [[Overhead power line|power line]]s. They are often caused by strong winds, especially those from [[tropical cyclone]]s and [[tornado]]es, and occasionally by intense [[downburst]]s and [[derecho]]es. [[Storm spotting|Storm spotters]] and meteorologists use these flashes to spot tornadoes which would otherwise be invisible due to rain or darkness. They can be distinguished from [[lightning]] by the fact that they originate at ground level, the blue color of the flash, and depending on distance, the sound of high-voltage lines shorting out.

In [[condensed matter physics]], a '''pseudogap''' describes a state where the [[Fermi surface]] of a material possesses a partial [[energy gap]], for example, a [[band theory|band structure]] state where the Fermi surface is gapped only at certain points.&lt;ref name=timusk1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Timusk|first=Tom|author2=Bryan Statt |title=The pseudogap in high-temperature superconductors: an experimental survey|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|year=1999|volume=62|issue=1|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/62/1/002|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9905219.pdf|accessdate=4 June 2012|arxiv = cond-mat/9905219 |bibcode = 1999RPPh...62...61T|pages=61–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term pseudogap was coined by [[Nevill Mott]] in 1968 to indicate a minimum in the density of states at the [[Fermi level]], ''N(E&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;)'', resulting from [[Coulomb repulsion]] between electrons in the same atom, a [[band gap]] in a disordered material or a combination of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = N. F. Mott | title = Metal-Insulator Transition | year = 1968 | journal = [[Reviews of Modern Physics]] | volume = 40 | pages = 677–683 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.40.677 | bibcode= 1968RvMP...40..677M | issue = 4| citeseerx = 10.1.1.559.1764 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern context pseudogap is a term from the field of [[high-temperature superconductivity]] which refers to an energy range (normally near the [[Fermi level]]) which has very few states associated with it. This is very similar to a true 'gap', which is an energy range that contains no allowed states. Such gaps open up, for example, when electrons interact with the lattice. The pseudogap phenomenon is observed in a region of the phase diagram generic to cuprate high-temperature superconductors, existing in underdoped specimens at temperatures above the superconducting transition temperature.

Only certain electrons 'see' this gap.  The gap, which should be associated with an insulating state, only exists for electrons traveling parallel to the copper-oxygen bonds.&lt;ref name=nature-2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mannella|first=N.|title=Nodal quasiparticle in pseudogapped colossal magnetoresistive manganites|journal=Nature|year=2005|volume=438|pages=474–478|doi=10.1038/nature04273|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7067/full/nature04273.html|accessdate=24 June 2012|arxiv = cond-mat/0510423 |bibcode = 2005Natur.438..474M |display-authors=etal|pmid=16306987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrons traveling at 45° to this bond can move freely throughout the crystal.  The [[Fermi surface]] therefore consists of [[Fermi arc]]s forming pockets centered on the corner of the [[Brillouin zone]].  In the pseudogap phase these arcs gradually disappear as the temperature is lowered until only four points on the diagonals of the Brillouin zone remain ungapped.

On one hand, this could indicate a completely new electronic phase which consumes available states, leaving only a few to pair up and superconduct.  On the other hand, the similarity between this partial gap and that in the superconducting state could indicate that the pseudogap results from preformed [[Cooper pair]]s.

Recently a pseudogap state has also been reported in strongly disordered conventional superconductors such as [[Titanium nitride|TiN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Benjamin Sacépé |author2=Claude Chapelier |author3=Tatyana I.

==Experimental evidence==

A pseudogap can be seen with several different experimental methods. One of the first observations was in NMR measurements of YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6+''x''&lt;/sub&gt; by H. Alloul ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alloul |first1=H. |last2=Ohno |first2=T. |last3=Mendels |first3=P. |title=&lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Y NMR evidence for a fermi-liquid behavior in YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6+''x''&lt;/sub&gt; |journal=Physical Review Letters |date=16 October 1989 |volume=63 |issue=16 |pages=1700–1703 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.63.1700}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[specific heat]] measurements by Loram ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J. W. Loram |author2=K. A. Mirza |author3=J. R. Cooper |author4=W. Y. Liang  |last-author-amp=yes | title = Electronic specific heat of YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6+''x'&lt;/sub&gt;' from 1.8 to 300 K | year = 1993 | journal = [[Physical Review Letters]] | volume = 71 | issue = 11 | pages = 1740–1743 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.71.1740 | bibcode=1993PhRvL..71.1740L}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pseudogap is also apparent in [[ARPES]] (Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy) and STM ([[Scanning tunneling microscope]]) data, which can measure the [[density of states]] of the electrons in a material.

==Mechanism==
The origin of the pseudogap is controversial and still subject to debate in the condensed matter community. Two main interpretations are emerging:

'''1. The scenario of preformed pairs'''
In this scenario, electrons form pairs at a temperature ''T*'' that can be much larger than the critical temperature ''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' where superconductivity appears. Values of ''T*'' of the order of 300 K have been measured in underdoped cuprates where ''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' is about 80 K. The superconductivity does not appear at ''T*'' because large phase fluctuations of the pairing field cannot order at this temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=V.J. Emery |author2=S.A. Kivelson | title = Importance of phase fluctuations in superconductors with small superfluid density | year = 1995 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 374 | pages = 434–437 | doi = 10.1038/374434a0 |bibcode = 1995Natur.374..434E | issue=6521}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pseudogap is then produced by incoherent fluctuations of the pairing field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marcel Franz  | title = Superconductivity: Importance of fluctuations | year = 2007 | journal = [[Nature Physics]] | volume = 3 | pages = 686–687 | doi = 10.1038/nphys739 |bibcode =   2007NatPh...3..686F| issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pseudogap is a normal state precursor of the superconducting gap due to local, dynamic pairing correlations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mohit Randeria  |author2=Nandini Trivedi  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Pairing Correlations above Tc and pseudogaps in underdoped cuprates | year = 1998 | journal = [[Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids]] | volume = 59 | issue = 10–12 |pages=1754–1758 | doi=10.1016/s0022-3697(98)00099-7|bibcode=1998JPCS...59.1754R}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view is supported by a quantitative approach of the attractive pairing model to specific heat experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Philippe Curty  |author2=Hans Beck,   |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Thermodynamics and Phase Diagram of High Temperature Superconductors | year = 2003 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 91 | pages = 257002 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.257002 | pmid = 14754139 | issue = 25 | bibcode=2003PhRvL..91y7002C|arxiv = cond-mat/0401124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
'''2. The scenario of a non-superconductivity-related pseudogap'''
In this class of scenarios, many different possible origins have been put forward, such as the formation of [[Charge density wave|electronic stripes]], [[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] ordering, or other exotic [[order parameter]]s competing with superconductivity.

=== Description ===
''Chenopodium quinoa'' is a [[dicotyledon]]ous [[Annual plant|annual]] plant, usually about {{convert|1|–|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. It has broad, generally powdery, hairy, lobed leaves, normally arranged [[Alternate leaf|alternately]]. The woody central [[plant stem|stem]] is branched or unbranched depending on the variety and may be green, red or purple. The flowering [[panicle]]s arise from the top of the plant or from [[leaf axils]] along the stem. Each panicle has a central axis from which a secondary axis emerges either with flowers (amaranthiform) or bearing a tertiary axis carrying the flowers (glomeruliform).&lt;ref name="Lost crops" /&gt; The green [[Ovary (plants)|hypogynous]] flowers have a simple [[Petal|perianth]] and are generally [[Self-Fertilization|self-fertilizing]].&lt;ref name="Lost crops" &gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iT0rAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA149#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Lost Crops of the Incas: Little-Known Plants of the Andes with Promise for Worldwide Cultivation|publisher=U.S. National Research Council, Advisory Committee on Technology Innovation, National Academies |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reinhard Lieberei, Christoph Reissdorff  |author2=Wolfgang Franke |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Georg Thieme Verlag|title=Nutzpflanzenkunde|year=2007|isbn=978-3135304076}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fruits (seeds) are about {{convert|2|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} in diameter and of various colors—from white to red or black, depending on the [[cultivar]].&lt;ref name=" Oxford"&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Oxford Book of Food Plants|author1=Vaughn, JG|author2=Geissler, CA|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199549467|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UdKxFcen8zgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural distribution===
''Chenopodium quinoa'' is believed to have been domesticated in the Peruvian Andes from wild or weed populations of the same species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/mcm193v1 | author = [[Barbara Pickersgill]] | title = Domestication of Plants in the Americas: Insights from Mendelian and Molecular Genetics | journal = Annals of Botany | date = August 31, 2007 | doi = 10.1093/aob/mcm193 | volume = 100 | pmid = 17766847 | issue = 5 | pmc = 2759216 | pages = 925–40 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071021154818/http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/mcm193v1 | archivedate = October 21, 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are non-cultivated quinoa plants (''Chenopodium quinoa'' var.

===Saponins and oxalic acid===
In their natural state, the seeds have a coating which contains bitter-tasting [[saponin]]s, making them [[unpalatable]].&lt;ref name="Lost crops" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jarvis"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=David E.|last2=Ho|first2=Yung Shwen|last3=Lightfoot|first3=Damien J.|last4=Schmöckel|first4=Sandra M.|last5=Li|first5=Bo|last6=Borm|first6=Theo J.

==Cultivation==

===Climate requirements===
The plant's growth is highly variable due to the number of different subspecies, varieties and [[landrace]]s (domesticated plants or animals adapted to the environment in which they originated). However, it is generally undemanding and altitude-hardy; it is grown from coastal regions to over {{convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the Andes near the equator, with most of the cultivars being grown between {{convert|2500|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Depending on the variety, optimal growing conditions are in cool climates with temperatures that vary between {{convert|-4|C|F}} during the night to near {{convert|35|C|F}} during the day. Some cultivars can withstand lower temperatures without damage. Light frosts normally do not affect the plants at any stage of development, except during flowering. Midsummer frosts during flowering, a frequent occurrence in the Andes, lead to sterilization of the pollen. Rainfall requirements are highly variable between the different cultivars, ranging from {{convert|300|to|1000|mm|in|abbr=on}} during the [[growing season]]. Growth is optimal with well-distributed rainfall during early growth and no rain during seed maturation and harvesting.&lt;ref name="Lost crops" /&gt;

==== United States ====
Quinoa has been cultivated in the United States, primarily in the high elevation [[San Luis Valley]] of [[Colorado]] where it was introduced in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url = http://www.localfoodshift.pub/growing-quinoa-in-colorado-an-interview-with-paul-new-white-mountain-farm/|date=February 2016|title = Growing Quinoa in Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this high-altitude desert valley, maximum summer temperatures rarely exceed {{convert|30|°C|°F}} and night temperatures are about {{convert|7|°C|°F}}. Due to the short growing season, North American cultivation requires short-maturity varieties, typically of Bolivian origin.

==== Europe ====
Several countries within Europe, including France, England, The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Spain, have successfully grown quinoa on a commercial scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = European Quinoa Group|url = http://www.quinoaeurope.eu/|website = www.quinoaeurope.eu|accessdate = 2015-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, within the UK, crops have been grown to scale and mechanically harvested in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-1F7TrniyI|accessdate = 2015-12-27|title=Pret A Manger – The journey of our British quinoa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sowing===
Quinoa plants do best in sandy, well-drained soils with a low nutrient content, moderate salinity, and a soil pH of 6 to&amp;nbsp;8.5. The [[seedbed]] must be well prepared and drained to avoid waterlogging.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Soil and pests===
Yields are maximised when {{convert|170|to|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[nitrogen|N]] per hectare are available.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The addition of phosphorus does not improve yield. In eastern North America, it is susceptible to a [[leaf miner]] that may reduce crop success. (It also affects the common weed and close relative ''[[Chenopodium album]]'', but ''C. album'' is much more resistant.)

===Genetics===
The [[genome]] of quinoa was sequenced in 2017 by researchers at [[King Abdullah University of Science and Technology]] in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name="jarvis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-38908321 |title=Quinoa genome could see 'super-food' prices tumble |publisher=BBC News |date=8 February 2017|accessdate=9 February 2017|last1=McGrath |first1=Matt }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through [[genetic engineering]], the plant is being modified to have higher [[crop yield]], improved tolerance to heat and [[biotic stress]], and greater sweetness through saponin inhibition.&lt;ref name="jarvis" /&gt;

===Harvesting===

Traditionally, quinoa grain is harvested by hand, and only rarely by machine, because the extreme variability of the maturity period of most Quinoa cultivars complicates mechanization. Harvest needs to be precisely timed to avoid high seed losses from shattering, and different panicles on the same plant mature at different times. The [[crop yield]] in the Andean region (often around 3 t/ha up to 5 t/ha) is comparable to wheat yields. In the United States, varieties have been selected for uniformity of maturity and are mechanically harvested using conventional small grain combines.

=== Processing ===
The plants are allowed to stand until the stalks and seeds have dried out and the grain has reached a moisture content below 10%.
Handling involves [[threshing]] the seedheads from the [[chaff]] and [[winnowing]] the seed to remove the [[husk]]. Before storage, the seeds need to be dried in order to avoid [[germination]].&lt;ref name="Lost crops" /&gt; Dry seeds can be stored raw until being washed or mechanically processed to remove the [[pericarp]] to eliminate the bitter layer containing saponins. The seeds must be dried again before being stored and sold in stores.

The resulting effect on traditional production regions in Peru and Bolivia also influenced new commercial quinoa production elsewhere in the world, such as the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Small (2013), 'Quinoa – is the United Nations' featured crop of 2013 bad for biodiversity?', ''Biodiversity'', 14:3, 169-179 (p. 176), DOI:10.1080/14888386.2013.835551.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Alastair Bland |title=Quinoa Craze Inspires North America To Start Growing Its Own |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/11/29/166155875/quinoa-craze-inspires-north-america-to-start-growing-its-own |publisher=NPR |accessdate=28 July 2018 |date=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2017, quinoa was being cultivated in some 50 countries.&lt;ref name=amrc/&gt;

In 2016, world production of quinoa was 148,720 tonnes, led by [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] with 97% of the total combined (table).&lt;ref name=faostat16/&gt;

===Effects on growers of rising demand===

Rising quinoa prices over the period 2006 to 2017 may have reduced affordability of traditional consumers to consume quinoa.&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="complicated"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2013/01/quinoa-good-evil-or-just-really-complicated|title=Quinoa: Good, Evil, or Just Really Complicated?|author=Tom Philpott|date=|publisher=Mother Jones|accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Ernest Small (2013), 'Quinoa – is the United Nations' featured crop of 2013 bad for biodiversity?', ''Biodiversity'', 14:3, 169-179 (pp. 176-77), DOI:10.1080/14888386.2013.835551.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2016 study using Peru's [[Encuesta Nacional de Hogares]] found that during 2004-2013 rising quinoa prices led to net economic benefits for producers,&lt;ref&gt;Marc F. Bellemare, Johanna Fajardo-Gonzalez and  Seth R. Gitter, 'Foods and Fads: The Welfare Impacts of Rising Quinoa Prices in Peru', Towson University Department of Economics Working Paper Series Working Paper No. 2016-06 (March 2016), http://webapps.towson.edu/cbe/economics/workingpapers/2016-06.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; and other commentary has suggested similar conclusions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/07/16/202737139/is-our-love-of-quinoa-hurting-or-helping-farmers-who-grow-it|title=Your Love Of Quinoa Is Good News For Andean Farmers|author=Allison Aubrey|date=2013-06-07|work=NPR|accessdate=2013-08-01}}

It's improving Peruvian farmers' lives|newspaper=The Guardian|author=Alexander Kasterine|date=17 July 2016|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that as quinoa producers rise above [[Subsistence|subsistence-level income]], they switch their own consumption to [[Processed foods|Western processed foods]] which are often less healthy than a traditional, quinoa-based diet, whether because quinoa is held to be worth too much to keep for oneself and one's family, or because processed foods have higher status despite their poorer nutritional value.&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="complicated" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Efforts are being made in some areas to distribute quinoa more widely and ensure that farming and poorer populations have access to it and have an understanding of its nutritional importance, including use in free [[School Breakfast Program|school breakfasts]] and [[government provision]]s distributed to pregnant and nursing women in need.&lt;ref name="complicated" /&gt;

In terms of wider social consequences, research on traditional producers in Bolivia has emphasised a complex picture. The degree to which individual producers benefit from the global quinoa boom depends on its [[mode of production]], for example through producer associations and co-operatives such as the [[Asociación Nacional de Productores de Quinua]] (founded in the 1970s), contracting through vertically-integrated private firms, or wage labour.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Ofstehage, 'The construction of an alternative quinoa economy: balancing solidarity, household needs, and profit in San Agustín, Bolivia', ''Agriculture and Human Values'' (2012) 29:441–454

The growth of quinoa consumption in nonindigenous regions has raised concerns over [[food security]], such as unsustainably intensive farming of the crop, expansion of farming into ecologically fragile ecosystems, threatening both the sustainability of producer agriculture and the biodiversity of quinoa.&lt;ref name="Ernest Small 2013"&gt;Ernest Small (2013), 'Quinoa – is the United Nations' featured crop of 2013 bad for biodiversity?', ''Biodiversity'', 14:3, 169-179, DOI:10.1080/14888386.2013.835551.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.-E.

World demand for quinoa is sometimes presented in the media particularly as being caused by rising [[veganism]],&lt;ref name="The Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://inews.co.uk/opinion/sanctimonious-vegans-well-look-closely-diets-global-impact/|title=Sanctimonious vegans would do well to think about their diet's global impact|last=Alibhai-Brown|first=Yasmin|date=January 8, 2018|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but academic commentary has noted that promoting meat consumption as an ethical alternative to eating quinoa is generally inconsistent with achieving a sustainable world food supply.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Small (2013), 'Quinoa – is the United Nations' featured crop of 2013 bad for biodiversity?', ''Biodiversity'', 14:3, 169-179 (p. 177), DOI:10.1080/14888386.2013.835551.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kosher certification==
Quinoa is used in the Jewish community as a substitute for the [[Chametz|leavened grains]] that are forbidden during the [[Passover]] holiday. Several [[kosher]] certification organizations refuse to certify it as being kosher for Passover, citing reasons including its resemblance to prohibited grains or fear of cross-contamination of the product from nearby fields of prohibited grain or during packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://life.nationalpost.com/2013/03/25/jews-divided-by-great-passover-debate-is-quinoa-kosher/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130411105834/http://life.nationalpost.com/2013/03/25/jews-divided-by-great-passover-debate-is-quinoa-kosher/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 11, 2013|title=Jews divided by great Passover debate: Is quinoa kosher?|author=Hopper, Tristin|date=March 25, 2013|work=[[National Post]]|accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in December 2013 the [[Orthodox Union]], the world's largest [[kosher certification agency]], announced it would begin certifying quinoa as kosher for Passover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.forward.com/the-jew-and-the-carrot/189844/quinoa-ruled-kosher-for-passover/|author=Nemes, Hody|date=December 23, 2013|title=Quinoa Ruled Kosher for Passover|publisher=Forward|accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19078">The '''Rashba effect''', also called '''Bychkov-Rashba effect''', is a momentum-dependent splitting of [[Spin (physics)|spin]] bands in bulk [[crystal]]s&lt;ref group="note"&gt;More specifically, uniaxial noncentrosymmetric crystals.&lt;/ref&gt; and low-dimensional [[condensed matter]] systems (such as [[heterostructure]]s and [[surface states]]) similar to the splitting of [[particle]]s and [[anti-particle]]s in the [[Dirac equation|Dirac]] Hamiltonian. The splitting is a combined effect of [[spin–orbit interaction]] and asymmetry of the crystal potential, in particular in the direction perpendicular to the two-dimensional plane (as applied to surfaces and heterostructures). This effect is named in honour of [[Emmanuel Rashba]],  who discovered it with Valentin I. Sheka in 1959 &lt;ref&gt;E. I. Rashba and V. I. Sheka, Fiz. Tverd. Tela - Collected Papers (Leningrad), v.II, 162-176 (1959) (in Russian), English translation: Supplemental Material to the paper by G. Bihlmayer, O. Rader, and R. Winkler, Focus on the Rashba effect, New J. Phys. '''17''', 050202 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; for three-dimensional systems and afterward with

Remarkably, this effect can drive a wide variety of novel physical phenomena, especially operating electron spins by electric fields, even when it is a small correction to the band structure of the two-dimensional metallic state.  An examples of a physical phenomena that can be explained by Rashba model is the anisotropic [[magnetoresistance]] (AMR).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;AMR in most common magnetic materials was reviewed by {{Harvard citation no brackets|McGuire|Potter|1975|}}. A more recent work ({{Harvard citation no brackets|Schliemann|Loss|2003}}) focused on the possibility of Rashba-effect-induced AMR and some extensions and corrections were given later ({{Harvard citation no brackets|Trushin|Výborný|Moraczewski|Kovalev|2009}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGuire|first=T.|author2=Potter|first2=R.|date=|year=1975|title=Anisotropic magnetoresistance in ferromagnetic 3d alloys|url=|journal=IEEE Transactions on Magnetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=1018–1038|bibcode=1975ITM....11.1018M|doi=10.1109/TMAG.1975.1058782|ref=harv|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schliemann|first=John|author2=Loss|first2=Daniel|date=|year=2003|title=Anisotropic transport in a two-dimensional electron gas in the presence of spin-orbit coupling|url=|journal=Physical Review B|volume=68|page=165311|pages=|arxiv=cond-mat/0306528|bibcode=2003PhRvB..68p5311S|doi=10.1103/physrevb.68.165311|ref=harv|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trushin|first=Maxim|last2=Výborný|first2=Karel|last3=Moraczewski|first3=Peter|last4=Kovalev|first4=Alexey A.|last5=Schliemann|first5=John|last6=Jungwirth|first6=T.|date=2009|title=Anisotropic magnetoresistance of spin-orbit coupled carriers scattered from polarized magnetic impurities|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.80.134405|journal=Physical Review B|volume=80|issue=13|pages=134405|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.80.134405|ref=harv|via=|arxiv=0904.3785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lately, a momentum dependent pseudospin-orbit coupling has been realized in cold atom systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lin|first=Y.-J. |author2=K. Jiménez-García |author3=I. B.

==Hamiltonian==
The Rashba effect is most easily seen in the simple model Hamiltonian known as the Rashba Hamiltonian 
:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\rm R}=\alpha(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\times\mathbf{p})\cdot \hat{z}
&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the Rashba coupling, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[momentum]] and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Pauli matrix]] vector.
This is nothing but a two-dimensional version of the Dirac Hamiltonian (with a 90 degrees rotation of the spins).

The Rashba model in solids can be derived in the framework of the [[k·p perturbation theory]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Winkler|first=Ronald|title=Spin-orbit Coupling Effects in Two-Dimensional Electron and Hole Systems|publisher=Springer Tracts in Modern Physics|location=New-York|url=http://www.physics.udel.edu/~bnikolic/QTTG/NOTES/SPINTRONICS/WINKLER=spin_orbit_coupling_effect_in_2d_electron_and_hole_systems.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; or from the point of view of a [[tight binding]] approximation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=L. Petersena  |author2=P. Hedegård |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A simple tight-binding model of spin–orbit splitting of sp-derived surface states|journal=Surface Science|year=2000|volume=459|issue=1-2|pages=49–56|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039602800004416|doi=10.1016/S0039-6028(00)00441-6|bibcode=2000SurSc.459...49P}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the specifics of these methods are considered tedious and many prefer an intuitive toy model that gives qualitatively the same physics (quantitatively it gives a poor estimation of the coupling &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;). Here we will introduce the intuitive [[toy model]] approach followed by a sketch of a more accurate derivation.

== Naive derivation==
The Rashba effect is a direct result of inversion symmetry breaking in the direction perpendicular to the two-dimensional plane. Therefore, let us add to the [[Hamiltonian function|Hamiltonian]] a term that breaks this symmetry in the form of an electric field
:&lt;math&gt;
H_E= - E_0 z
&lt;/math&gt;,
Due to relativistic corrections an electron moving with velocity '''''v''''' in the electric field will experience an effective magnetic field '''''B'''''
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{B}=-(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{E})/c^2
&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light. This magnetic field couples to the electron spin
:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\mathrm{SO}}=\frac{g\mu_{\rm B}}{2c^2}(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{E})\cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;-g\mu_{\rm B} \mathbf{\sigma}/2&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron magnetic moment]].

Within this toy model, the Rashba Hamiltonian is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\mathrm{R}}=\alpha(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\times\mathbf{p})\cdot \hat{z}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac{g\mu_{\rm B}E_0}{2mc^2}&lt;/math&gt;. However, while this "toy model" is superficially convincing, the [[Ehrenfest theorem]] seems to suggest that since the electronic motion in the &lt;math&gt;\hat{z}&lt;/math&gt; direction is that of a bound state that confines it to the 2D surface, the time-averaged electric field (i.e., including that of the potential that binds it to the 2D surface) that the electron experiences must be zero! When applied to the toy model, this argument seems to rule out the Rashba effect (and caused much controversy prior to its experimental confirmation), but turns out to be subtly-incorrect when applied to a more realistic model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=P. Pfeffer  |author2=W. Zawadzki |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Spin splitting of conduction subbands in III-V heterostructures due to inversion asymmetry|journal=Physical Review B|year=1999|volume=59|pages=R5312-5315|bibcode = 1999PhRvB..59.5312P |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.59.R5312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. While the above naive derivation provides correct analytical form of the Rashba Hamiltonian, it is inconsistent because the effect comes from mixing energy bands (interband matrix elements) rather from intraband term of the naive model. Consistent approach explains large magnitude of the effect that includes in the denominator instead of the [[Dirac]] gap of &lt;math&gt;mc^2&lt;/math&gt; of the order of MeV combination of splittings the energy bands in a crystal that are about eV, see next section.

== Estimation of the Rashba coupling in a realistic system – the tight binding approach==
In this section we will sketch a method to estimate the coupling constant &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; from microscopics using a tight-binding model. Typically, the itinerant electrons that form the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) originate in atomic '''''s''''' and '''''p''''' orbitals. For the sake of simplicity let's consider holes in the &lt;math&gt;p_z&lt;/math&gt; band.&lt;ref&gt;Typically in semiconductors the Rashba splitting is considered for the '''''s''''' band around the &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_6&lt;/math&gt; point. In the discussion above we consider only the mixing of the anti-bonding '''''p''''' bands. However, the induced Rashba splitting is simply given by the hybridization between '''''p''''' and '''''s''''' bands. Therefore, this discussion is actually all one needs to understand the Rashba splitting at near the &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_6&lt;/math&gt; point.&lt;/ref&gt; In this picture electrons fill all the &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; states except for a few holes near the &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; point.

The necessary ingredients to get Rashba splitting are atomic spin-orbit coupling
:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\mathrm{SO}}=\Delta_{\mathrm{SO}} \mathbf{L} \otimes \boldsymbol{\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;,
and an asymmetric potential in the direction perpendicular to the 2D surface
:&lt;math&gt;
H_{E}=E_0 \,z
&lt;/math&gt;,

The main effect of the symmetry breaking potential is to open a band gap &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\mathrm{BG}}&lt;/math&gt; between the isotropic &lt;math&gt;p_z&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;p_x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_y&lt;/math&gt; bands. The secondary effect of this potential is that it [[Orbital hybridisation|hybridizes]] the &lt;math&gt;p_z&lt;/math&gt; with the &lt;math&gt;p_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_y&lt;/math&gt; bands. This hybridization can be understood within a tight-binding approximation. The hopping element from a &lt;math&gt;p_z&lt;/math&gt; state at site &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; with spin &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; to a &lt;math&gt;p_{x}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;p_{y}&lt;/math&gt; state at site j with spin &lt;math&gt;\sigma'&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
t_{ij;\sigma \sigma'}^{x,y}=\langle p_z,i;\sigma | H | p_{x,y},j ;\sigma'\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the total Hamiltonian. In the absence of a symmetry breaking field, i.e. &lt;math&gt;H_E= 0&lt;/math&gt;, the hopping element vanishes due to symmetry. However, if &lt;math&gt;H_E\ne 0&lt;/math&gt; then the hopping element is finite. For example, the nearest neighbor hopping element is 
:&lt;math&gt;
t_{\sigma \sigma'} ^{x,y}=E_0 \langle p_z,i ;\sigma| z | p_{x,y},i+1_{x,y} ;\sigma'\rangle = t_0 \,\mathrm{sgn}(1_{x,y})
\delta_{\sigma \sigma'}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;1_{x,y}&lt;/math&gt; stands for unit distance in the &lt;math&gt;x,y&lt;/math&gt; direction respectively and &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\sigma \sigma'}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Kronecker delta|Kronecker's delta]].

The Rashba effect can be understood as a second order perturbation theory in which a spin-up hole, for example, jumps from a &lt;math&gt;|p_z,i;\uparrow\rangle&lt;/math&gt; state to a &lt;math&gt;|p_{x,y},i+1_{x,y};\uparrow\rangle&lt;/math&gt; with amplitude &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; then uses the spin[[spin–orbit interaction|–]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;orbit coupling to flip spin and go back down to the &lt;math&gt;|p_z,i+1_{x,y};\downarrow\rangle&lt;/math&gt; with amplitude &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\mathrm{SO}}&lt;/math&gt;. 
Note that overall the hole hopped one site and flipped spin.
The energy denominator in this perturbative picture is of course &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\mathrm{BG}}&lt;/math&gt; such that all together we have
:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha\approx {a \,t_0 \,\Delta_{\mathrm{SO}}\over \Delta_{\mathrm{BG}}}
&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the interionic distance. This result is typically several orders of magnitude larger than the naive result derived in the previous section.

==Application==
''[[Spintronics]]'' - Electronic devices are based on the ability to manipulate the electrons position by means of electric fields. Similarly, devices can be based on the manipulation of the spin degree of freedom. The Rashba effect allows to manipulate the spin by the same means, that is, without the aid of a magnetic field. Such devices have many advantages over their electronic counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;D. Bercioux and P. Lucignano,
 Quantum transport in Rashba spin–orbit materials: a review, Rep. Prog. Phys. '''78''', 106001 (2015); https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00570.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spintronics-info.com/electron-spin-splitting-rashba-effect-shown-bismuth-selenide Rashba Effect in Spintronic Devices]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Topological quantum computation]]'' - Lately it has been suggested that the Rashba effect can be used to realize a p-wave superconductor.&lt;ref name="SF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PW" /&gt; Such a superconductor has very special [[edge-states]] which are known as [[Majorana fermion|Majorana bound states]]. The non-locality immunizes them to local scattering and henceforth they are predicted to have long [[coherence (physics)|coherence]] times. Decoherence is one of the largest barriers on the way to realize a full scale [[quantum computer]] and these immune states are therefore considered good candidates for a [[qubit|quantum bit]].

{{main|Dresselhaus effect}}

The Rashba spin-orbit coupling is typical for systems with uniaxial symmetry, e.g., for hexagonal crystals of CdS and CdSe for which it was originally found &lt;ref&gt;E. I. Rashba and V. I. Sheka, Fiz. Tverd. Tela - Collected Papers (Leningrad), v.II, 162-176 (1959) (in Russian), English translation: Supplemental Material to the paper by G. Bihlmayer, O. Rader, and R. Winkler, Focus on the Rashba effect, New J. Phys. '''17''', 050202 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; and perovskites, and also for heterostructures where it develops as a result of a symmetry breaking field in the direction perpendicular to the 2D surface.&lt;ref&gt;Yu. A. Bychkov and E. I. Rashba, Properties of a 2D electron gas with a lifted spectrum degeneracy, Sov. Phys. - JETP Lett. '''39''', 78-81 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; All these systems lack inversion symmetry. A similar effect, known as the Dresselhaus spin orbit coupling&lt;ref&gt;G. Dresselhaus, Spin-Orbit Coupling Effects in Zinc Blende Structures, Phys. Rev. '''100''', 580  (1955)&lt;/ref&gt; arises in cubic crystals of A&lt;sub&gt;III&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; type lacking inversion symmetry and in [[quantum well]]s manufactured from them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3546">A '''reversible hydrogen electrode''' ('''RHE''') is a [[reference electrode]], more specifically a subtype of the [[standard hydrogen electrode]]s, for [[electrochemical]] processes. Unlike the standard hydrogen electrode, its measured [[potential]] does not change with the [[pH]], so it can be directly used in the electrolyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/jp037126d |title=The reversible hydrogen electrode:  potential-dependent activation energies over platinum from quantum theory|year=2004|last1=Cai|first1=Yu|last2=Anderson|first2=Alfred B.|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry B|volume=108|issue=28|pages=9829}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Staehler, M. |author2=Wipperman, K. |author3=Stolten, D.  |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://www.electrochem.org/dl/ma/206/pdfs/1863.pdf |title=Instabilities of the reversible hydrogen reference electrode in direct methanol fuel cells|journal=2004 Joint International Meeting of the Electrochemical Society, abstract 1863}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=84265 |title=Hydrogen overvoltage|author1=MacInnes, Duncan A.  |author2=Adler, Leon |lastauthoramp=yes |pmc=1091559|pmid=16576366|year=1919|volume=5|issue=5|pages=160–3|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|doi=10.1073/pnas.5.5.160|bibcode=1919PNAS....5..160M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name refers to the fact that the electrode is in the actual electrolyte solution and not separated by a [[salt bridge]]. The hydrogen ion concentration is therefore not 1, but corresponds to that of the  electrolyte solution; in this way we can achieve a stable potential with a changing pH value. 
The potential of the RHE correlates to the pH value:
:&lt;math&gt;E_0 = 0.000 - 0.059\times\mathrm{pH}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, for hydrogen electrodes in which the reaction:

:&lt;chem&gt; {2H3O+} + {2e^-} &lt;=&gt; {H2} + {2H2O}&lt;/chem&gt;

expires, the following dependence of the [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] potential {{mvar|E}}, hydrogen pressure &lt;math chem&gt;p\ce{[H2]}&lt;/math&gt; and the activity &lt;math chem&gt;a\ce{[H3O+]}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[hydronium]] ions:

:&lt;math chem&gt; E = E_{00}   +   \frac{R\;T}{F} \left(  \ln \left( a[\ce{H3O+}] \right) - \tfrac{1}{2}\ln\left( \;p[\ce{H2}] \right)  \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;E_{00}&lt;/math&gt; is the standard reduction potential (this is by definition equal to zero), R is the [[universal gas constant]], T the [[absolute temperature]] and F is the [[Faraday constant]].

Surges occur in the [[electrolysis of water]] which means that the required [[cell voltage]] due to kinetic inhibition is higher than the equilibrium potential. The voltage increases with increasing current density at the electrodes. The measurement of equilibrium potentials is therefore possible without power.

==Principle==
The reversible hydrogen electrode is a fairly practical and reproducible electrode "standard."  The term refers to a hydrogen electrode immersed in the electrolyte solution actually used.

The benefit of that electrode is that no [[salt bridge]] is needed:
* no contamination of the electrolyte by Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; or SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;
* no diffusion potentials at the electrolyte bridge ([[liquid junction potential]]). This is important at temperature different to 25&amp;nbsp;°C.
* long time measurements possible (no electrolyte bridge means no maintenance of the bridge)

The [[solar furnace]] of Uzbekistan was built in 1981, and is located 45 kilometers away from [[Tashkent]] city. The furnace is the largest in [[Asia]]. It uses a curved mirror, or an array of mirrors, acting as a parabolic reflector, which can reach temperatures of up to 3,000 degrees [[Celsius]]. The solar furnace of Uzbekistan can be visited by anyone who is interested in [[solar energy]] and wants to see its distinctive construction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uzbekjourneys.com/2012/02/solar-energy-in-uzbekistan.html Information about the solar furnace of Uzbekistan] uzbekjourneys.com Retrieved 02.04.2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== About ==
[[File:Four solaire 001.jpg|thumb|Solar furnace of [[France]]]]
The heat which is produced by the solar furnace is considered to be very clean, without any pollutants. There are different ways of using this energy, such as hydrogen fuel production, foundry applications and high temperature testing. The solar furnace of Uzbekistan is sometimes called the Sun Institute of Uzbekistan. The furnace is a complex optical and mechanical construction, with 63 flat mirrors automatically controlled to track the [[sun]] in unison and redirect the solar thermal energy towards the crucible. The furnace was first opened in May 1981, and it is located 1100 meters above sea level. The furnace covers a huge area in the mountains, and consists of 4 complex subdivisions, which are: the main building of “Solar furnace of Uzbekistan”, heliostatic field, concentrator and manufacturing tower. The solar furnace of Uzbekistan was ready for use in 6 years, which means it was built between the years of 1981 and 1987. The place for the solar furnace of Uzbekistan was chosen carefully, because the sun shines there for 270 days a year. The small solar furnace at the complex has the diameter of 2 meters. The heliostatic field of the solar furnace of Uzbekistan currently consists of about 62 heliostats which are installed in a staggered order. The field uses 12090 mirrors in total, and Is the largest concentrator in the world, with an area of 1849 square meters. The concentrator at the furnace uses 10,700 mirrors, and the southern part of the concentrator is covered with special sunscreens. The solar furnace of Uzbekistan is controlled by employees from the laboratory on the 6th floor, and the observation ground is located on the highest spot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.industrytap.com/gigantic-solar-furnace-uzbekistan-melts-metal/27741 Article about the solar furnace in Uzbekistan, in English language] industrytap.com Retrieved 02.04.2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://englishrussia.com/2012/01/25/the-solar-furnace-of-uzbekistan/5/ Article with picture about the solar furnace of Uzbekistan in English language] englishrussia.com Retrieved 02.04.2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Staebler–Wronski Effect''' (SWE) refers to light-induced [[metastability|metastable]] changes in the properties of hydrogenated [[amorphous silicon]].

The defect density of hydrogenated [[amorphous silicon]] (a-Si:H) increases with light exposure, causing an increase in the [[carrier generation and recombination|recombination current]] and reducing the efficiency of the conversion of [[sunlight]] into [[electricity]].

It was discovered by [[David L. Staebler]] and [[Christopher R. Wronski]] in 1977. They showed that the [[dark current (physics)|dark current]] and [[photoconductivity]] of hydrogenated [[amorphous silicon]] can be reduced significantly by prolonged illumination with intense light. However, on heating the samples to above 150&amp;nbsp;°C, they could reverse the effect.&lt;ref name="StaeblerWronski1977"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Staebler|first1=D. L.|last2=Wronski|first2=C. R.|title=Reversible conductivity changes in discharge-produced amorphous Si|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=31|issue=4|year=1977|pages=292|issn=0003-6951|doi=10.1063/1.89674|bibcode = 1977ApPhL..31..292S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==

===Some experimental results===

* Photoconductivity and dark conductivity decrease rapidly at first before stabilizing at a lower value.
* Interruptions in the illumination has no effect on the subsequent rate of change. Once the sample is illuminated again, the photoconductivity will drop as though there was no interruption.

===Suggested explanations===
The exact nature and cause of the Staebler–Wronski effect is still not well known. [[Nanocrystalline silicon]] suffers less from the Staebler–Wronski effect than amorphous silicon, suggesting that the disorder in the amorphous silicon Si network plays a major role. Other properties that could play a role are hydrogen concentration and its complex bonding mechanism, as well as the concentration of impurities.

Historically, the most favored model has been the hydrogen bond switching model.&lt;ref name="Kołodziej2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kołodziej |first=A. |date=2004 |title=Staebler-Wronski effect in amorphous silicon and its alloys |url=https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.baztech-article-BWA1-0005-0076 |journal=Opto-Electronics Review |publisher= |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=21–32 |access-date=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposes that an electron-hole pair formed by the incident light may recombine near a weak Si–Si bond, releasing energy sufficient to break the bond. A neighbouring H atom then forms a new bond with one of the Si atoms, leaving a [[dangling bond]]. These dangling bonds can trap electron-hole pairs, thus reducing the current that can pass through. However, new experimental evidence is casting doubt on this model. More recently, the ''H collision model'' proposed that two spatially separated recombination events cause emission of mobile hydrogen from Si–H bonds to form two dangling bonds, with a metastable paired H state binding the hydrogen atoms at a distant site.&lt;ref&gt;H.M. Branz, The hydrogen collision model: Quantitative description of metastability in amorphous silicon, Phys. Rev. B, '''59''' 5498, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
The efficiency of an amorphous silicon solar cell typically drops during the first six months of operation. This drop may be in the range from 10% up to 30% depending on the material quality and device design. Most of this loss comes in the [[Fill factor (solar cell)|fill factor]] of the cell. After this initial drop, the effect reaches an equilibrium and causes little further degradation. The equilibrium level shifts with [[operating temperature]] so that performance of modules tend to recover some in the summer months and drop again in the winter months.&lt;ref&gt;Uchida,Y and Sakai,H. Light Induced Effects in a-Si:H Films and Solar Cells, Mat. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc., Vol. 70,1986&lt;/ref&gt; Most commercially available a-Si modules have SWE degradation in the 10–15% range and suppliers typically specify efficiency based on performance after the SWE degradation has stabilized. In a typical [[amorphous silicon]] solar cell the efficiency is reduced by up to 30% in the first 6 months as a result of the Staebler–Wronski effect, and the fill factor falls from over 0.7 to about 0.6. This light induced degradation is the major disadvantage of amorphous silicon as a [[photovoltaic]] material.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Jenny (2003). ''The Physics of Solar Cells''. Imperial College Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of reducing the SWE==
*Using [[nanocrystalline silicon]] instead of [[amorphous silicon]]
*Operating at a higher temperature. This can be accomplished by integrating the PV in a [[photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collector]] (PVT).
*Stacking one or more thinner layers of amorphous silicon together with other materials to form a [[multijunction solar cell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://photochemistry.epfl.ch/EDEY/B_Strahm.ppt Staebler-Wronski effect in amorphous silicon PV and procedures to limit degradation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306163152/http://photochemistry.epfl.ch/EDEY/B_Strahm.ppt |date=6 March 2007 }}, EY-1.1: 28 October 2005, Benjamin Strahm, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Centre de Recherches en Physique des Plasmas(Power Point Slide Show)&lt;/ref&gt; The higher electric field which applies in the thinner layers appears to reduce the SWE.

A '''stand-alone power system''' ('''SAPS''' or '''SPS'''), also known as '''remote area power supply''' ('''RAPS'''), is an [[off-the-grid]] [[electricity]] system for locations that are not fitted with an [[electricity distribution]] system. Typical SAPS include one or more methods of [[electricity generation]], [[Grid energy storage|energy storage]], and regulation.

Electricity is typically generated by one or more of the following methods:
* [[Photovoltaic system]] using [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s
* [[Wind turbine]]
* [[Geothermal]] source
* [[Micro combined heat and power]]
* [[Micro hydro]]
* [[Diesel generator|Diesel]] or [[biofuel]] generator
* [[Thermoelectric generator]] (TEGs)

Storage is typically implemented as a [[Battery (electricity)|battery bank]], but other solutions exist including [[fuel cell]]s. Power drawn directly from the battery will be [[direct current]]  [[extra low voltage]] (DC ELV), and this is used especially for lighting as well as for DC appliances. An [[inverter]] is used to generate AC [[low voltage]], which more typical appliances can be used with.

[[File:Depuradora de Lluc.JPG|320px|thumb|right|A typical stand-alone [[solar PV system]] at a sewage treatment plant in  [[Santuari de Lluc]], Spain]]

Stand-alone [[photovoltaic power systems]] are independent of the [[utility grid]] and may use solar panels only or may be used in conjunction with a diesel generator, a wind turbine or batteries.&lt;ref name=source&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewable-energy-sources.com/2010/04/20/stand-alone-photovoltaic-systems/|title=Stand-Alone Photovoltaic Systems|publisher=renewable-energy-sources.com|accessdate=2011-07-21|work=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713082559/http://www.renewable-energy-sources.com/2010/04/20/stand-alone-photovoltaic-systems/|archivedate=2011-07-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trisanita.org/jases/asespaper2010/ases09v5n1y2010.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426001412/http://www.trisanita.org/jases/asespaper2010/ases09v5n1y2010.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-04-26|title=A STAND-ALONE PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEM, CASE STUDY: A RESIDENCE IN GAZA|publisher=trisanita.org|accessdate=2011-07-21|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
&lt;!-- [[Image:PV-system log cabin.png|280px|thumb|right|A schematic of a direct-coupled system, consisting (from left to right) of PV module, battery, inverter, and AC load]] --&gt;
The two types of stand-alone photovoltaic power systems are direct-coupled system without batteries and stand alone system with batteries.

=== Direct-coupled system ===
The basic model of a direct coupled system consists of a solar panel connected directly to a dc load. As there are no battery banks in this setup, energy is not stored and hence it is capable of powering common appliances like fans, pumps etc. only during the day. [[MPPT]]s are generally used to efficiently utilize the Sun's energy especially for electrical loads like positive-displacement water pumps. Impedance matching is also considered as a design criterion in direct-coupled systems.&lt;ref name=source/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eai.in/ref/ae/sol/cs/tech/saps/stand_alone_solar_pv_systems.html|title=Stand Alone PV Systems|publisher=eai.in|accessdate=2011-07-21|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stand alone system with batteries ===
[[Image:PV-system country home1.png|thumb|Schematic of a stand-alone PV system with battery and charger]]
In stand-alone photovoltaic power systems, the electrical energy produced by the photovoltaic panels cannot always be used directly. As the demand from the load does not always equal the solar panel capacity, battery banks are generally used.
The primary functions of a storage battery in a stand-alone PV system are:
* '''Energy Storage Capacity and Autonomy''': To store energy when there is an excess is available and to provide it when required.
* '''Voltage and Current Stabilization''': To provide stable current and voltage by eradicating transients.
* '''Supply Surge Currents''': to provide surge currents to loads like motors when required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localenergy.org/pdfs/Document%20Library/Fundamentals%20of%20batteries%20and%20charge%20control.pdf|title=SBatteries and Charge Control in Stand-Alone Photovoltaic Systems-Fundamentals and Application|publisher=localenergy.org|accessdate=2011-07-21|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hybrid system==
{{See also|Hybrid power|Hybrid renewable energy system|Solar hybrid power system|Wind hybrid power system}}

The ''hybrid power plant'' is a complete electrical power supply system that can be easily configured to meet a broad range of remote power needs. There are three basic elements to the system - the power source, the [[Battery (electricity)|battery]], and the power management center. Sources for [[hybrid power]] include [[wind turbine]]s, [[diesel engine]] generators, thermoelectric generators and [[solar PV system]]s. The battery allows autonomous operation by compensating for the difference between power production and use. The power management center regulates power production from each of the sources, controls power use by classifying loads, and protects the battery from service extremes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Badwal|first1=Sukhvinder P. S.|last2=Giddey|first2=Sarbjit S.|last3=Munnings|first3=Christopher|last4=Bhatt|first4=Anand I.|last5=Hollenkamp|first5=Anthony F.|title=Emerging electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies|journal=Frontiers in Chemistry|date=24 September 2014|volume=2|doi=10.3389/fchem.2014.00079|pmid=25309898|pmc=4174133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ginn|first1=Claire|title=Energy pick n’ mix: are hybrid systems the next big thing?|url=https://blog.csiro.au/energy-pick-n-mix-hybrid-systems-next-big-thing/|website=www.csiro.au|publisher=CSIRO|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== System monitoring ==
Monitoring photovoltaic systems can provide useful information about their operation and what should be done to improve performance,  but if the data are not reported properly, the effort is wasted.  To be helpful, a monitoring report must provide information on the relevant aspects of the operation in terms that are easily understood by a third party. Appropriate performance parameters need to be selected, and their values consistently updated with each new issue of the report.  In some cases it may be beneficial to monitor the performance of individual components in order to refine and improve system performance, or be alerted to loss of performance in time for preventative action.  For example, monitoring battery charge/discharge profiles will signal when  replacement is due before downtime from system failure is experienced.&lt;ref name=iea&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/index.php?id=9&amp;eID=dam_frontend_push&amp;docID=377|title=Guidelines for Monitoring Stand-Alone Photovoltaic Systems: Methodology and Equipment|publisher=iea-pvps.org|accessdate=2011-07-21|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IEC standard 61724 ===
IEC has provided a set of monitoring standards called the "Standard for Photovoltaic system performance monitoring" ([[IEC 61724]]). It focusses on the photovoltaic system's electrical performance and it does not address hybrids or prescribe a method for ensuring that performance assessments are equitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1998|title=Photovoltaic system performance monitoring – Guidelines for measurement, data exchange and analysis|journal=IEC standard 61724, Geneva|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance assessment ==
Performance assessment involves:
* Data collection, which is a straightforward process of measuring parameters.
* Evaluation of that data in a manner that provides useful information.
* Dissemination of useful information to the end user.&lt;ref name=iea/&gt;

== Load related problems ==
The wide range of load related problems identified are classified into the following types:
* ''Wrong selection'': Some loads cannot be used with stand-alone PV systems.
* ''House wiring'': Inadequate or low quality wiring and protection devices can affect the system's response.
* ''Low efficiency'': Low efficiency loads may increase energy consumption.
* ''Stand-by loads'': Stand-by mode of some loads waste energy.
* ''Start-up'': High current drawn by some loads during start-up Current spikes during the start-up can overload the system temporarily.
* ''Reactive power'': The circulating current can differ from the current consumed when capacitive or inductive loads are used.
* ''Harmonic distortion'': Non-linear loads may create distortion of the inverter waveform.
* ''Mismatch between load and inverter size'': When a higher rated inverter is used for a lower capacity load, overall efficiency is reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/index.php?id=9&amp;eID=dam_frontend_push&amp;docID=375|title=Use of appliances in Stand-Alone PV Power supply systems: problems and solutions|publisher=iea-pvps.org|accessdate=2011-07-21|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''third brush dynamo''' was a type of [[dynamo]], an [[electrical generator]], formerly used for [[car battery|battery]] charging on [[motor vehicle]]s.  It was superseded, first by a two-brush dynamo equipped with an external [[voltage regulator]], and later by an [[alternator (automotive)|alternator]].  

==Construction==
As the name implies, the machine had three [[Brush (electric)|brushes]] in contact with the [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]].  One was [[Ground (electricity)|earthed]] to the frame of the vehicle and another was connected (through a reverse-current cut-out) to the live terminal of the vehicle's battery.  The third was connected to the [[field coil|field winding]] of the dynamo.  The other end of the field winding was connected to a switch which could be adjusted (by inserting or removing resistance) to give "low" or "high" charge.  This switch was sometimes combined with the vehicle's light switch so that switching on the headlights simultaneously put the dynamo in high charge mode.

==Disadvantages==
The third brush dynamo had the advantage of simplicity but, by modern standards, it gave poor voltage regulation.  This led to short battery life as a result of over-charging or under-charging.

'''Vasile Adam''' (born October 10, 1956 in the [[Soviet Union]]), in little town, [[Nisporeni]]) is Moldovan woodcarver known for furniture-making and icons.

His works are mostly traditional woodworking. Artist has a workshop (from 1996) in his native town in which he provide integrated courses of the woodcarving. Also Vasile Adam works predominantly for private clients. His creations and projects are spread among national collections as well as international ones.

Major works of the artist was donated to chapel of [[Romanian People's Salvation Cross]] and to monastery 'Ciuflea' located in [[Chisinau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ziarulnational.md/nisporeni-parintele-sfintilor „Părintele” sfinților], newspaper "Ziarul național"&lt;/ref&gt;

In his career, the woodworker tried different techniques and traditions in art, including sculpture. One of his stone creations is a monument to the Soviet heroes, who have died during the World War II. The monument rises over the German town Templin.

Adam is a member of [[Handicraftsmen's union of Moldova]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handicrafts.md/en/wood-carving/adam-vasile Artist's profile on Official page of Handicraftsmen's union of Moldova]&lt;/ref&gt; and Academy of Traditional Arts (Sibiu, [[Romania]])

'''Vortex Bladeless S.L''' is a Spanish tech startup that developed a multi-patented wind turbine without blades. In 2014, Vortex Bladeless won The South Summit Award in the category of energy and industry for the best project.

== History ==
Vortex Bladeless S.L is a wind energy Spanish startup that  was founded in 2013 by David Yáñez, David Suriol and Raúl Martín, exclusively dedicated to the development and marketing of Vortex.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; This multi-patented wind turbine without blades is able to capture the kinetic wind energy by 'vortex shedding' and transform it into electricity.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vortex-bladeless-wind-energy-project-team-receives-altair-cae-suite-donation-300247351.html|title=Vortex Bladeless Wind Energy Project Team Receives Altair CAE Suite Donation|last=Altair|website=www.prnewswire.com|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; The idea emerged in 2002 when David Yáñez, the inventor, saw a video of the [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge disaster]] and led him to the idea of a bladeless wind turbine.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://amagazine.com.au/stylish-sustainability-out-of-spain/|title=Smart sustainability out of Spain|date=2015-10-02|newspaper=A Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new technology seeks to overcome issues related to traditional wind turbines such as maintenance, amortization, noise, environmental impact, logistics, and visual aspects.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  In April 2015, Vortex relocated to Boston and formed a coalition with representatives from Harvard University, IDEO, TerraForm Power and Dat Venture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vortexbladeless.com/blog.php|title=Vortex|last=vortexbladeless|website=Vortex Bladeless|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billtucker/2015/05/07/wind-power-without-the-mills/#6f2e68e025ee|title=Wind Power Without The Mills|last=Tucker|first=Bill|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The improvement of its product has been funded by Repsol Foundation Grant, Spanish Angels Investors and a loan from the Spanish government.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.repsol.com/es_es/corporacion/prensa/Newsletter/proyecto-vortex.aspx|title=Conoce mejor a dos de los ganadores: Proyecto Vortex - repsol.com|website=www.repsol.com|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vortex also launched a crowdfunding campaign on June 1, 2015 to fund part of its commercialization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/vortex-bladeless-a-wind-generator-without-blades--3#/|title=Vortex Bladeless: a wind generator without blades|website=Indiegogo|language=es-ES|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the company's focus is on the development of small wind products, with mass power generation devices planned for the future.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Vortex's innovation comes from its unusual shape, where a [[fiberglass]] and [[Carbon fibers|carbon fiber]] mast oscillates in the wind taking advantage of the [[vortex shedding]] effect.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; At the bottom of the mast a carbon fiber rod moves inside a [[linear alternator]] that generates the electricity, with no moving parts in contact.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.engineering.com/Library/ArticlesPage/tabid/85/ArticleID/10223/Vortex-Bladeless-Generates-Power-from-Wind-without-Blades.aspx|title=Vortex Bladeless Generates Power from Wind without Blades &gt; ENGINEERING.com|last=ENGINEERING.com|website=www.engineering.com|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.powermag.com/new-approach-powers-bladeless-wind-turbine/|title=New Approach Powers Bladeless Wind Turbine|last=Patel|first=Sonal|date=July 1, 2015|work=|publisher=Power Magazine|access-date=June 27, 2018|via=EBSCOHost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vortex has a small [[carbon footprint]], is noiseless, has low center of gravity and allows for small foundation dimensions, so more generators can be placed in an area, at twice the density of traditional turbines.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Vortex bladeless wind energy project team receives altair CAE suite donation.|last=|first=|date=2016|work=|publisher=Diario La Razón|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person's '''waist-to-height ratio''' ('''WHtR'''), also called '''waist-to-stature ratio''' ('''WSR'''), is defined as their [[waist]] circumference divided by their height, both measured in the same units. The WHtR is a measure of the distribution of [[body fat]]. Higher values of WHtR indicate higher risk of obesity-related cardiovascular diseases; it is correlated with [[abdominal obesity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=CM Lee, Huxley RR, Wildman RP, Woodward M|title=Indices of abdominal obesity are better discriminators of cardiovascular risk factors than BMI: a meta-analysis'|journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology|volume=61|issue=7|date=July 2008|pages=646–653|pmid=18359190|doi=10.1016/j.jclinepi.2007.08.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study that followed 11,000 subjects for up to eight years concluded that WHtR is a much better measure of the risk of heart attack, stroke or death than the more widely used [[body mass index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The predictive value of different measures of obesity for incident cardiovascular events and mortality.|author=Schneider|journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism|volume=95|issue=4|year=2010|pages=1777–1785|url=http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/95/4/1777|doi=10.1210/jc.2009-1584|pmid=20130075|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2011 study that followed 60,000 participants for up to 13 years found that [[waist–hip ratio]] (when adjusted for BMI) was a better predictor of ischemic heart disease mortality than WHtR.&lt;ref name="MørkedalRomundstad2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mørkedal|first1=Bjørn|last2=Romundstad|first2=Pål R|last3=Vatten|first3=Lars J.|title=Informativeness of indices of blood pressure, obesity and serum lipids in relation to ischaemic heart disease mortality: the HUNT-II study|journal=European Journal of Epidemiology|volume=26|issue=6|year=2011|pages=457–461|issn=0393-2990|doi=10.1007/s10654-011-9572-7|pmid=21461943|pmc=3115050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, WHtR was not a predictor for new-onset diabetes melitus in at least one study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Inability of waist-to-height ratio to predict new onset diabetes mellitus among older adults in Taiwan: A five-year observational cohort study|author=Ren-Jieh Kuo|journal=Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics|volume=53|issue=1|year=2011|pages=e1-e4|url=http://www.aggjournal.com/article/S0167-4943%2810%2900130-5/abstract|doi=10.1016/j.archger.2010.05.005|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A WHtR of over 0.5 is critical and signifies an increased risk; a 2010 systematic review of published studies concluded that "WHtR may be advantageous because it avoids the need for age-, sex- and ethnic-specific boundary values".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A systematic review of waist-to-height ratio as a screening tool for the prediction of cardiovascular disease and diabetes: 0·5 could be a suitable global boundary value. |vauthors=Browning Lucy M, etal |journal=Nutrition research reviews|volume=23|issue=02|year=2010|pages=247–69|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?aid=7929311|doi=10.1017/S0954422410000144}}&lt;/ref&gt; For people under 40 the critical value is 0.5, for people aged 40–50 the critical value is between 0.5 and 0.6, and for people over 50 the critical values start at 0.6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hospimedica.com/critical-care/articles/294746805/waist-height-ratio-better-than-bmi-for-gauging-mortality.html |title=Waist-Height Ratio Better Than BMI for Gauging Mortality |date=18 Jun 2013 |accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
