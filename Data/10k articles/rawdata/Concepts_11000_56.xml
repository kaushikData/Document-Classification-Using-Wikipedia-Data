Hindu religious NGOs, including MHS, decided to form a special committee after the burial of Murthi according to Islamic rights, to study and make recommendations on the issues of conversions to Islam, namely grabbing of dead bodies and conversions of children. Mr.P. Waythamoorthy was made the Chairman of this special committee.However, after more cases of temple demolitions and conversions, this committee evolved and saw the formation of Hindraf in June 2007 with the involvement of religious NGO's, politicians and other Indian-based NGO's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religious Freedom and the Indian Community in Malaysia|last=Vaithilingam.

The '''2007 HINDRAF rally''' was a rally held in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]], on 25 November 2007. The rally organiser, the [[HINDRAF|Hindu Rights Action Force]], had called the protest over alleged discriminatory policies which favour ethnic [[Malaysian Malay|Malays]]. The rally was the second such street protest after the [[2007 Bersih rally]] in Kuala Lumpur on 10 November 2007. The rally started when a crowd estimated to be between 5,000 and 30,000 people gathered outside the [[Petronas Twin Towers]] at midnight, early Sunday morning.

At least 240 people were detained, but half of them were later released.

==Background==
'''Religious persecution''' has been formidable source of marginalization of the people of Indian origin in Malaysia.Between April to May 2006, [[Demolition of Hindu temples in Malaysia|several Hindu temples were demolished]] by city hall authorities in the country, accompanied by violence against Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930195228/http://www.malaysiakini.com/opinionsfeatures/52600 Temple row - a dab of sensibility please],''malaysiakini.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noor|first=Farish Ahmad Noor|date=2008|title=The Hindu Rights Action Force (Hindraf) of Malaysia: Communitarianism Across Borders?|url=http://hdl.handle.net?10220/40159|journal=|volume=|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 April 2006, the Malaimel Sri Selva Kaliamman Temple in Kuala Lumpur was destroyed by the City Hall authorities because of violation of construction laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-malaysia-demolishes-century-old-hindu-temple-1025317 |title=Malaysia demolishes century-old Hindu temple |publisher=[[Daily News and Analysis]] |accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The president of the Consumers Association of Subang and Shah Alam in Selangor State has been helping to organize efforts to stop the local authorities in the Muslim dominated city of Shah Alam from demolishing a 107-year-old Hindu temple. The growing Islamization in Malaysia is a cause for concern to many Malaysians who follow minority religions such as Hinduism.On 11 May 2006, armed city hall officers from [[Kuala Lumpur]] forcefully demolished part of a 60-year-old suburban temple that serves more than 1,000 Hindus because i[[Kuala Lumpur|was built]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ld illegally.Moreover, the demolition of the Seri Maha Mariamman Temple in Padang Jawa, Shah Alam just a few days before Deepavali which is most important Hindu festival of lights in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Karmveer|date=2013|title=Challenges to the Rights of Malaysians of Indian Descent|url=http://www.e-ir.info/2013/02/06/challenges-to-the-rights-of-malaysians-of-indian-descent|journal=E-International Relation|volume=|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noor|first=Farish Ahmad Noor|date=2008|title=The Hindu Rights Action Force of Malaysia: Communication Borders?|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10220/40159|journal=|volume=|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only that, an interesting case was the attempted demolition of the Sri Kaliamman Temple just outside Angkasapuri, which is the headquarters for Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM).The temple was asked to evacuate for security reasons stating that it was a security risk. The President of Temple confirmed that it was authorized by a former Minister of Information that the temple which was built by the staff of RTM remain at its present location which is part of the land of Angkasapuri. As the leader of Hindu delegation in the Committee, he enquired with the National Security Council representatives at the meeting whether the surau or the proposed site for the RM5million new mosque in the Angkasapuri compound was open for the staff only or the public as well.He stated that if the public is allowed to visit this Islamic place of worship, then how does the question of security arise when the temple is outside the compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religious Freedom and Malaysian Indian|last=Vaithilingam .A|first=A.

The Hindu Rights Action Force or [[HINDRAF]], a coalition of several NGO's, have protested these demolitions by lodging complaints with the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]] but with no response.&lt;ref name="Finexp"&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 Hindu group protests 'temple cleansing' in Malaysia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704022731/http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 |date=4 July 2007 }},''Financial Express''&lt;/ref&gt; Many Hindu advocacy groups have protested what they allege is a systematic plan of temple cleansing in Malaysia. The official reason given by the Malaysian government has been that the temples were built "illegally". However, several of the temples are centuries old.
According to a lawyer for [[HINDRAF]], a [[Hindu temple]] is demolished in [[Malaysia]] once every three weeks.

'''Affirmative Action Policy''' is to ensure the peace and stability in the pluralist society of Malaysia.It was found to address Malay grievances.The government introduced a

number of policies to improve the condition of the Bumiputeras in all sectors of life.In 1971 the New Economic Policy was launched, effectively imposing a regime of

positive discrimination for Malays in a variety of sectors from education and business to the bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Karmweer Singh|date=2013|title=Challenges to the Rights of Malaysians of Indian Descent|url=http://www.e-ir.info/2013/02/06/challenges-to-the-rights-of-malaysians-of-indian-descent|journal=E-INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS|volume=|pages=9|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later revisions of this, such as the New Development Plan

(1991-2000) as well as the New Vision Policy (2000-2010),all targeted the promotion of the local Malay population.Although, the NEP was meant to eliminate poverty in

rural sectors,it had bypassed the private plantation which included the rubber plantation that employed a large number of Indian labourers.Statistics clearly showed that

more than 75% of Indians were in 1970 classified as low wages labourers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Socio-Legal Study of the Indian Minority in Malaysia|last=Kananatu|first=Thaatchaayini|publisher=Institute of Ethnic Studies (KITA),(UKM)|year=2016|isbn=978-967-0741-20-8|location=Selangor, Malaysia|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; The socio-economic situation of the Indian Tamil plantation labour in particular was a major

concern of the Malaysian Indian Congress(MIC).After Independence,the MIC President Tun V.T.Sambanthan had established the National Land Finance plantations that

were facing fragmentation.Without government aid it was considered a gergantuan task,and plea was made to low wages,loss of jobs and homes due to the fragmentation

exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Socio-Legal Study of the Indian Minority in Malaysia|last=Kananatu|first=Thaatchaayini Kananatu|publisher=Institute of Ethnic Studies|year=2016|isbn=978-967-0741-20-8|location=Selangor, Malaysia|pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1974 MIC Bluebook,spearheaded by the MIC President V.Manickavasagam,contained key proposals which included increase of Indian share capital,ownership and

control achievement of racial balance in public employment,offer of Indian who were restricted under the Employment Act 1968 and abolish the Contract Labour

System,allotment of new housing and Introduction of a systematic academic scheme for Tamil schools are recommended under the Aziz Commission Report.&lt;ref name="Kananatu 2016 181"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Socio-Legal Study of the Indian Minority in Malaysia|last=Kananatu|first=Thaatchaayini|publisher=Institute of Ethnic Studies (KITA) (UKM)|year=2016|isbn=978-967-0741-20-8|location=Selangor, Malaysia|pages=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MIC

Bluebook proposals indicate the socioeconomic grievances faced by the Indian Tamil plantation labour. The early efforts made by the MIC,none of the Bluebook

recommendation were taken into consideration.Following the fragmentation and redevelopment of rubber plantation land,the mid-1980 onward witnessed the gradual

urbanization of the Indian Tamil Plantation labour and the continued disregard of this particular class-based group's grievances by government policy and poverty

reduction programmes.The situation was found to worsen when rubber plantation were bought over through Permodalan Nasional Berhad(PNB),a Malay trust agency.As

such,the complicity between the private corporations and government established an unequal bargaining position between the plantation corporations and the Indian

Tamil plantation labour.&lt;ref name="Kananatu 2016 181"/&gt;

Without adequate labour representation and political clout, the Indian Tamil plantation labour face serious socio-economic problems such as loss jobs,eviction from estate

homes and forced relocation to urban squatters.By the mid-1990s,it was reported that 70.5% of Indians were employed low-waged labour in agricultural, manufacturing

and industrial jobs.The forced urbanization had led to the constitution of an urban Indian underclass that as facing social and economic grievances such as urban

poverty,lack of education,unemployment and social problems such as the escalation of crime among youths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Socio- Legal Study of the Indian Minority in Malaysia|last=Kananatu|first=Thaatchaiyini|publisher=Institute of Ethnic Studies|year=2016|isbn=978-967-0741-20-8|location=Selangor, Malaysia|pages=181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development programmes initiated under the National

Development Policy(NDP) and the socioeconomic programmes under the NEP had failed to consider the socioeconomic situation of the Indian Tamil plantation labour as

it was outside purview of the race-basd affirmative action policy.

'''Political Representation'''.MIC is the biggest India political party and a constituent of the rulling coalition government at the centre since independence does not have

much political clout and has not been able to do anything substantial to improve the lot of the Indians.Indian non-governmental organizations(NGOs),community and self-help groups among the urban Indian middle class have attempted to solve the socio-economic problems faced by the former Indian Tamil plantation labour.However,

contemporary Indian civil society is generally divided due to differences in ideology.The class-based approach taken by community groups such as Alaigal and JERIT

have successfully mobilized the Indian Tamil Plantation labour to seek their legal rights against unlawful eviction from homes and to obtain adequate and fair

compensation for retrenchment from plantation jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Socio-Legal Study of the Indian Minority in Malaysia|last=Kananatu|first=Thaatchaayini|publisher=Institute of Ethnic Studies KITA, UKM|year=2016|isbn=978-967-0741-20-8|location=Selangor, Malaysia|pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The urban Indian middle class had lost confidence in the political elites of the MIC who was seen as having a weak

bargaining clout within the communal Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition.The race-based politics of the BN was seen to have failed in resolving the serious issues faced by

class based group among the Indians.

Moreover,the unresolved Kampung Medan incident in 2001, which was reported to be a series of clashes between the Indian and Malay residents in the poorer urban

settlement of Kampung Medan in the state of Selangor, had deeply affected both the urban Indian underclass as well as the urban Indian middle-class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Socio- Legal Study of the Indian Minority in Malaysia|last=Kananatu|first=Thaatchaiyini|publisher=Institute of Ethnic Studies (KITA) (UKM)|year=2016|isbn=978-967-0741-20-8|location=Selangor, Malaysia|pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the

Malaysian Human Rights Commission to investigate the causes of the incident had further exacerbated the loss of confidence in the government.Indian civil society had

viewed the incident as a mob attack against the Malaysian Human Rights Commission for falling to hold an inquiry on the matter.The High Court in the case took a restrictive approach in inter receptivity to public policy reference to the victims of the Kampung Medan incident as being of Indian origin and of Tamil ethnicity,the court replied that: "Whatever one uses to describe those victims,it makes not a whit of a difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Socio-Legal Study of the Indian Minority in Malaysia|last=Kananatu|first=Thaatchaayini|publisher=Institute of Ethnic Studies|year=2016|isbn=978-967-0741-20-8|location=Selangor, Malaysia|pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judiciary disregarded the class based as well as the race based identity of the victims and only took into consideration the technically of legal procedural arguments.The judgement also meant that the victims of Kampong Medan did not have any further recourse to justice.

The issue of forced religious conversion has also been at the forefront. The trigger incidents were the 2007 series of legal cases involving the custody rights of non-

Muslim Indian mothers against the unilateral rights of their newly converted Muslims husbands to convert their children to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noor|first=Farish Ahmad Noor|date=2008|title=The Hindu Right Action Force(Hindraf) of Malaysia: Communitarianism Border|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10220/40159|journal=|volume=|pages=25|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two legal battles that became a

serious concern among the Indians were Shamala's case in 2003, and Subashini's case in 2007.Inboth,h the cases, the originally Hindu husband converted to Islam and the

attempted to unilaterally convert their children to Islam without the non-Muslims wife's legal permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Socio-Legal Study of the Indian Minority in Malaysia|last=Kananatu|first=Thaatchaayini|publisher=Institute of Ethnic Studies (KITA)(UKM)|year=2016|isbn=978-967-0741-20-8|location=Selangor, Malaysia|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many such cases of conversion to Islam either

voluntary or forced upon the ethnic Indian community, which has caused fear and apprehensions among the group.

==Petition to the United Kingdom==
[[Image:HINDRAFQueen.jpg|thumb|A HINDRAF activist carries a poster of [[Elizabeth II]] during the march to deliver their petition to the British [[High Commission]]]]

On 31 August 2007, the 50th anniversary of [[Malaysia]]'s independence, [[Waytha Moorthy Ponnusamy|P. Waytha Moorthy]], a HINDRAF lawyer filed a [[class action]] suit against the [[Government of the United Kingdom]] at The [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in [[London]] for US$4 trillion (US$1 million for every [[Malaysian Indian]]) for "withdrawing after granting independence and leaving us (Indians) unprotected and at the mercy of a majority Malay-Muslim government that has violated our rights as minority Indians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policewatchmalaysia.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1188457297&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=9&amp; |title=名古屋に住むコがネイルスクールに進学。 |publisher=Policewatchmalaysia.com |date= |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as guaranteed in the [[Constitution of Malaysia|Federal Constitution]] when independence was granted.&lt;ref name="T"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuppusamy |first=Baradan |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1687973,00.html |title=Facing Malaysia's Racial Issues |publisher=TIME |date=26 November 2007 |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawsuit is not only claiming 4 trillion [[Pound Sterling|British Pounds]] as compensation, it is also seeking to strike out [[Article 153 of the Malaysian Constitution]] which acknowledges the special position of Malays and the legitimate rights of other races, but is often seen as endorsement of [[Ketuanan Melayu|Malay Supremacy]] and for the court to declare that Malaysia is a [[secular state]] and not an [[Islamic state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=39221 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211003316/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=39221 |archivedate=11 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as declared by former Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad|Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad]] who is partly Indian himself.

As the group, which represents mainly working class [[Indian Malaysian]]s, could not afford the legal fees required, a petition was circulated with 100,000 signatures to be presented to [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] to appoint a [[Queen's counsel]] to argue the case.&lt;ref name="T"/&gt; The purpose of the rally was to hand over a 100,000 signature memorandum to the [[British High Commission]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]].

HINDRAF organised the rally on Sunday, 25 November 2007 to submit the petition at the British [[High Commission]].

==Government roadblocks==
Malaysian police refused to grant a permit for the rally,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www5.malaysiakini.com/news/75027 |title=Malaysiakini (needs subscription) |access-date=6 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205220911/http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/75027 |archive-date=5 December 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and set up roadblocks in [[Klang Valley]] along roads leading up to the rally to screen motorists entering the city center and identify "troublemakers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.detikdaily.net/m3/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1204 |title=Detikdaily - Hindraf rally: Arrests, roadblocks will make it worse&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=6 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071125005115/http://www.detikdaily.net/m3/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1204 |archive-date=25 November 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also advised the public not to participate in the rally,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRxMhk9cD40|title=Hindraf rally: Cops warn of 'stern action'|work=YouTube|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arrested three leaders of HINDRAF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEIE3N_DvXA|title=Another Hindraf lawyer arrested|work=YouTube|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many shops around Kuala Lumpur including [[Suria KLCC]] were closed on that day in fear of trouble from the rally.

One day before the rally, police arrested three HINDRAF lawyers, [[P. Uthayakumar]], [[P. Waytha Moorthy]] and V. Ganabatirau for sedition charges. Uthayakumar and Ganabatirau posted bail of 800 [[Malaysian ringgit]]s each, but Waytha Moorthy refused bail as a sign of protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=54188 |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603232003/http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=54188 |archive-date=3 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=6&amp;art_id=57494&amp;sid=16446487&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20071124&amp;fc=10 |title=China's Business Newspaper |publisher=The Standard |date= |accessdate=12 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916172221/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=6&amp;art_id=57494&amp;sid=16446487&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20071124&amp;fc=10 |archive-date=16 September 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianmalaysian.com/sound/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=777 |title=iMOL Archives - Hindraf: Let us hand petition and go home |publisher=Indianmalaysian.com |date= |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Kosovo|Republic of Kosovo]], the Law on Access to Official Documents was enacted in 2010. The law repealed and superseded various other legislation and administrative orders that were previously in force.&lt;ref name=K2.0&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kosovotwopointzero.com/en/kosovar-journalists-need-demand-implementation-access-information-rights |title=Kosovar journalists need to demand implementation of their access to information rights|last=Sheremeti |first=Furtuna |date=31 January 2017 |website=Kosovotwopointzero.com |publisher=Kosovo 2.0 |access-date=9 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right of access to public information is guaranteed by the Constitution. Several secondary acts aims at realizing the right and implement the 2010 Law. However, full implementation is lacking, the courts are slow to respond to appeals due to persistent backlogs in the judicial system.&lt;ref name=FH2015&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/kosovo |title=Kosovo. Freedom of the Press 2015 |last= |first= |date= 2015 |website=FreedomHouse.org |publisher=Freedom House |access-date=30 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when the appeals process work, the institutions appear willing to ignore the rulings of the court when it comes to transparency and access to public information.&lt;ref name="BIRN2016"&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |title=Transparency in the Balkans and Moldova |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/file/show/Transparency-in-the-Balkans-and-Moldova.pdf  |publisher=Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) |issue= |access-date= 30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, in 2016, the law on access to public documents is undergoing a procedure of amendment together with other laws to which it should be harmonized.&lt;ref name=K2.0/&gt;

==Legal framework==
In Kosovo [[Access to public information in Europe|access to public information]] is a right guaranteed by Article 41 of the Constitution which establishes that every person is entitled of the right of access to public information and that documents held by public institutions and organs of state authorities are public, except for information that can be concealed by law for reasons due to privacy, business trade secrets or public security.&lt;ref name=kryeministri&gt;{{cite journal |author=Besim M. Kajtazi |date=2013 |title= Legislation Summary on the Right of Access to Public Documents |url=http://www.kryeministri-ks.net/repository/docs/II.__SUMMARY_ON_THE_RIGHT_OF_ACCESS_TO_PUBLIC_DOCUMENTS.pdf |publisher=the Republic of Kosovo. The Office of the Prime Minister |issue= |access-date= 30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the right of access to official documents is guaranteed by many international agreements and declarations, such as the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] and Protocols which are directly applicable in the Republic of Kosovo and have priority in case of conflict of applicable laws.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

There are also special laws regulating the application of the right of access to public information, such as the Law on Administrative procedure and the Law on Civil Service of the Republic of Kosovo.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

Specifically, to implement the constitutional right of every person to have access, upon request, to documents of public interest held by public authorities, in 2010 the Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo approved the '''Law no. 03/L-215 on Access to Public Documents (LAPD).''' The LAPD Law applies to all documents maintained, drafted and received by public institutions and is based on ten principles:
* everyone has the right of access to information;
* access is the rule, secret is the exception;
* the law applies to all public bodies;
* the request should be simple, fast and free for the requester;
* officials have the duty to support the applicants in their search for information;
* the refusal should be justified;
* public interest is more important than secret;
* the right to appeal is guaranteed in case of negative reply;
* public authorities should proactively publish basic information;
* the right to information should be guaranteed by an independent body.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

===Procedures for exercising the right of access to information===
Requesting and obtaining public information is free of charge. A fee may only be charged to applicants for copies of the document requested and have to be reasonable and aiming at only covering the actual costs of reproduction and document delivery.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt; Exceptions to the right of access to public information can be applied and are defined by law.

According to the relevant law, access to public information may be restricted only for the purpose of protecting the public legitimate interests of life or other legitimate private interests, such as the right to privacy and for public security reasons.&lt;ref name="kryeministri" /&gt;  Other reasons for exceptions include: defence and international relations; detection and investigation of criminal activities, disciplinary investigations, atc.&lt;ref name="BIRN2016" /&gt;

The request can be made in writing or orally.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016/&gt;

Public institutions have to respond to citizens' requests within seven days with their decision to fully or partially grant the access. The deadline for review may be exceptionally extended to 15 days.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

The respect of the right of access to public information is guaranteed by the [[Ombudsman|Ombudsperson Institution]], an independent body supporting citizens to realize the right of access to documents that have been denied, according to the Law on Ombudsperson.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

In case of rejection of the applicant's request, and non-response by the relevant authority within the deadline, the applicant can start an appeal procedure in front of the Ombudsperson Institutions or the competent courts, in accordance with applicable law.&lt;ref name=kryeministri/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==

The implementation of the laws on access to public information is problematic.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016/&gt; According to the 2016 [[European Commission]] Progress Report, in practice the right of access to public information is “undermined by the authorities’ fragmented and unclear approach”.&lt;ref name=CE2016&gt;{{cite journal |author= |date=9 November 2016 |title= Commission staff working Document Kosovo* 2016 Report |url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2016/20161109_report_kosovo.pdf  |publisher=European Commission |issue= |access-date= 30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, according to the [[Balkan Investigative Reporting Network|Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN)]]  the realization of the right is hindered by a secretive mentality and culture of many public authorities in the country.&lt;ref name=BIRN2014&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drejtesianekosove.com/repository/docs/report_on_access_to_public_documents_2013-2014_824655.pdf |title=Report on Access to Public Documents 2013-2014 |last= |first= |date=June 2014 |website= |publisher=Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) |access-date=30 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, According to the news portal [[Kosovo 2.0]], institutions tend to disclose information on less important issues and when lower level institutions, such as municipalities, are involved.&lt;ref name=K2.0/&gt; Other flaws in the application of the law consists in its misinterpretation, for instance in distinguishing between what to consider private and what a public interest, and the application of ''ad hoc'' administrative measures by certain institutions. According to Kosovo 2.0, even when the law is very clear in specifying procedures, certain institutions have created their own procedures which are not always in line with the law, resulting in barriers for interested applicants. For instance, there are numerous institutions requiring the payment of 1 euro when filling a freedom of information request, which is in contradiction with the law.&lt;ref name=K2.0/&gt; Another problem concerns the officials who are responsible for receiving and processing freedom of information requests. According to Kosovo 2.0 in many cases they are not properly trained to effectively execute the law.&lt;ref name=K2.0/&gt;

In Kosovo, the majority of requests for accessing public information are submitted by journalists, activists and civil society organizations, and very few by citizens that are not fully aware of their right of access to public information.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016/&gt; According to a survey carried out in 2012, the level of knowledge about the content of the law on access to public information among citizens was extremely deficient, as well as their interest in making requests for access to public documents.&lt;ref name=FOL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://levizjafol.org/folnew/kosovo-with-a-low-level-of-implementation-of-the-law-on-access-to-public-documents/?lang=en   |title=Kosovo with a low level of implementation of the law on access to public documents |last= |first= |date= 28 September 2012 |website=Levizjafol.org |publisher=Lëvizja FOL Movement |access-date=30 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To test and monitor the implementation of the law, BIRN has submitted a series of requests for information to the majority of public institutions, at all levels, in Kosovo. From June 2013 to May 2014, it submitted a total of 125 official requests: of the requests submitted, 68 were denied, 50 approved and 7 partially denied, meaning that requested documents were received in only 40 per cent of cases. This result is considered as “rather poor” by the organisation.&lt;ref name=BIRN2014/&gt; During the same monitoring period, one of the major problems observed by BIRN concerned access to courts information, in particular indictments.&lt;ref name=BIRN2014/&gt; Another common problem highlighted by the organization is that, in practice and despite the law’s provisions, the institution that does not have the information requested usually rejects the requests, rather than forwarding it to another  institution that may have it as required by the law.&lt;ref name=BIRN2014/&gt; According to another test, implemented between October 2013 to April 2016, only 25 per cent of BIRN’s requests were approved and 38 were rejected.&lt;ref name=BIRN2016/&gt;

'''''Beneficium inventarii''''' (literally '''benefit of the inventory''') is a [[legal doctrine]] introduced into [[Roman law]] by [[Justinian I]] to limit the [[legal liability|liability]] of [[Beneficiary|heirs]] resulting from an [[Insolvency|insolvent]] [[Estate (law)|estate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/b/beneficium-inventarii/ Definition at USLegal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine, which is in force today in many [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law systems]], applies to both [[Will (law)|wills]] and [[Intestacy|intestate]] successions. An heir may accept a succession under ''beneficium inventarii'' without being liable for the debts attaching to the estate or to the claims of [[Will (law)|legatees]] beyond the estate's value as previously determined by inventory.

[[File:Anagram canonical svg.svg|thumb|Algorithmic [[anagram]] test using [[multiset]]s as canonical forms: The strings "&lt;tt&gt;madam curie&lt;/tt&gt;" and "&lt;tt&gt;radium came&lt;/tt&gt;" are given as [[C (programming language)|C]] arrays. Each one is converted into a canonical form by sorting. Since both sorted strings literally agree, the original strings were anagrams of each other.]]
In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], a '''canonical''', '''normal''', or '''standard'''  '''form''' of a [[mathematical object]] is a standard way of presenting that object as a [[mathematical expression]]. The distinction between "canonical" and "normal" forms varies by subfield. In most fields, a canonical form specifies a ''unique'' representation for every object, while a normal form simply specifies its form, without the requirement of uniqueness.

The canonical form of a [[positive integer]] in [[decimal representation]] is a finite sequence of digits that does not begin with zero.

More generally, for a class of objects on which an [[equivalence relation]] is defined, a '''canonical form''' consists in the choice of a specific object in each class. For example, [[Jordan normal form]] is a canonical form for [[matrix similarity]], and the [[row echelon form]] is a canonical form, when one considers as equivalent a matrix and its left product by an [[invertible matrix]].

In computer science, and more specifically in [[computer algebra]], when representing mathematical objects in a computer, there are usually many different ways to represent the same object. In this context, a '''canonical form''' is a representation such that every object has a unique representation. Thus, the equality of two objects can easily be tested by testing the equality of their canonical forms. However canonical forms frequently depend on arbitrary choices (like ordering the variables), and this introduces difficulties for testing the equality of two objects resulting on independent computations. Therefore, in computer algebra, ''normal form'' is a weaker notion: A '''normal form''' is a representation such that zero is uniquely represented. This allows testing for equality by putting the difference of two objects in normal form.

'''Canonical form''' can also mean a [[differential form]] that is defined in a natural (canonical) way.

In computer science, data that has more than one possible representation can often be canonicalized into a completely unique representation called its '''canonical form'''.  Putting something into canonical form is [[canonicalization]].&lt;ref&gt;The term 'canonization' is sometimes incorrectly used for this.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Suppose we have some set ''S'' of objects, with an [[equivalence relation]] ''R''. A '''canonical form''' is given by designating some objects of ''S'' to be "in canonical form", such that every object under consideration is equivalent to exactly one object in canonical form. In other words, the canonical forms in ''S'' represent the equivalence classes, once and only once. To test whether two objects are equivalent, it then suffices to test their canonical forms for equality.
A canonical form thus provides a [[classification theorem]] and more, in that it not just classifies every class, but gives a distinguished (canonical) representative.

Formally, a canonicalization with respect to an equivalence relation ''R'' on a set ''S'' is a mapping ''c'':''S''→''S'' such that for all ''s'', ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''S'':
# ''c''(''s'') = ''c''(''c''(''s'')) &amp;nbsp; ([[idempotence]]),
# ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''R'' ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if ''c''(''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''c''(''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;nbsp; (decisiveness), and 
# ''s'' ''R'' ''c''(''s'') &amp;nbsp; (representativeness). 
Property 3 is redundant, it follows by applying 2 to 1.

In practical terms, one wants to be able to recognize the canonical forms. There is also a practical, algorithmic question to consider: how to pass from a given object ''s'' in ''S'' to its canonical form ''s''*? Canonical forms are generally used to make operating with equivalence classes more effective. For example, in [[modular arithmetic]], the canonical form for a residue class is usually taken as the least non-negative integer in it. Operations on classes are carried out by combining these representatives and then reducing the result to its least non-negative residue.
The uniqueness requirement is sometimes relaxed, allowing the forms to be unique up to some finer equivalence relation, like allowing reordering of terms (if there is no natural ordering on terms).

A canonical form may simply be a convention, or a deep theorem.

For example, polynomials are conventionally written with the terms in descending powers: it is more usual to write ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x'' + 30 than ''x'' + 30 + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, although the two forms define the same polynomial. By contrast, the existence of [[Jordan canonical form]] for a matrix is a deep theorem.

==Examples==
Note: in this section, "[[up to]]" some equivalence relation E means that the canonical form is not unique in general, but that if one object has two different canonical forms, they are E-equivalent.

*The equation of a circle: &lt;math&gt;(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2&lt;/math&gt;

* All edges are tangent to the unit sphere, and

In the untyped lambda calculus, e.g., the term &lt;math&gt;(\lambda x.(x x) \; \lambda x.(x x))&lt;/math&gt; doesn't have a normal form. In the typed lambda calculus, every well-formed term can be rewritten to its normal form.

=== Dynamical systems ===
* [[Normal form (dynamical systems)]]

===Graph theory===
{{main article|Graph canonization}}
In [[graph theory]], a branch of mathematics, '''graph canonization''' is the problem finding a canonical form of a given graph ''G''. A canonical form is a [[Graph labeling|labeled graph]] Canon(''G'') that is [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] to ''G'', such that every graph that is isomorphic to ''G'' has the same canonical form as ''G''. Thus, from a solution to the graph canonization problem, one could also solve the problem of [[graph isomorphism]]: to test whether two graphs ''G'' and ''H'' are isomorphic, compute their canonical forms Canon(''G'') and Canon(''H''), and test whether these two canonical forms are identical.

===Differential forms===
Canonical [[differential form]]s include the [[canonical one-form]] and [[canonical symplectic form]], important in the study of [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] and [[symplectic manifold]]s.

=== Computing ===
In [[computing]], the reduction of data to any kind of canonical form is commonly called ''data normalization''.

For instance, [[database normalization]] is the process of organizing the [[Field (computer science)|fields]] and [[Table (database)|table]]s of a [[relational database]] to minimize [[Data redundancy|redundancy]] and dependency. 

In the field of [[software security]], a common [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] is unchecked [[malicious input]]. The mitigation for this problem is proper [[input validation]]. Before input validation may be performed, the input must be normalized, i.e., eliminating encoding (for instance [[Character encodings in HTML|HTML encoding]]) and reducing the input data to a single common [[character set]].

Other forms of data, typically associated with [[signal processing]] (including [[Audio signal processing|audio]] and [[Image processing|imaging]]) or [[machine learning]], can be normalized in order to provide a limited range of values.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14426">'''Comparative physiology''' is a [[List of academic disciplines|subdiscipline]] of [[physiology]] that studies and exploits the diversity of functional characteristics of various kinds of [[organisms]].  It is closely related to [[evolutionary physiology]] and [[environmental physiology]].  Many universities offer undergraduate courses that cover comparative aspects of animal physiology. According to [[Clifford Ladd Prosser]], "Comparative Physiology
is not so much a defined discipline as a viewpoint, a philosophy."&lt;ref name="Prosser1975"/&gt;

==History==
Originally, [[physiology]] focused primarily on human beings, in large part from a desire to improve [[medical]] practices.  When physiologists first began comparing different [[species]] it was sometimes out of simple curiosity to understand how organisms work but also stemmed from a desire to discover basic physiological principles.  This use of specific organisms convenient to study specific questions is known as the [[Krogh Principle]].

==Methodology==
C. Ladd Prosser,&lt;ref name='Greenbergetal1975'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenberg|first=M. J. |author2=P. W. Hochachka |author3=C. P. Mangum |year=1975|title=Biographical data:  Clifford Ladd Prosser| url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|issn=|volume=194|issue=1|pages=5–12|doi=10.1002/jez.1401940102|pmid=1104756}}&lt;/ref&gt; a founder of modern comparative physiology, outlined a broad agenda for comparative physiology in his 1950 edited volume (see summary and discussion in [[Theodore Garland, Jr.|Garland]] and Carter&lt;ref name="GarlandCarter1994"/&gt;):

1.  To describe how different kinds of animals meet their needs.
:This amounts to cataloging functional aspects of biological diversity, and has recently been criticized as "stamp collecting" with the suggestion that the field should move beyond that initial, exploratory phase.&lt;ref name='MangumHochachka1998'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mangum|first=C. P.|author2=P. W. Hochachka|year=1998|title=New directions in comparative physiology and biochemistry: mechanisms, adaptations, and evolution| url=|journal=Physiological Zoology|issn=|volume=71|issue=5|pages=471–484|doi=|pmid=9754524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2.  The use of physiological information to reconstruct	[[phylogenetic]] relationships of organisms.&lt;br /&gt;
:In principle physiological information could be used just as morphological information or [[DNA]] sequence is used to measure evolutionary divergence of organisms.  In practice, this has rarely been done, for at least four reasons:
:* physiology doesn't leave many [[fossil]] cues,
:* it can't be measured on [[museum]] specimens,
:* it is difficult to quantify as compared with morphology or DNA sequences, and
:* physiology is more likely to be adaptive than DNA, and so subject to parallel and [[convergent evolution]], which confuses phylogenetic reconstruction.

3.  To elucidate how physiology mediates interactions between organisms and their environments.
:This is essentially [[physiological ecology]] or ecological physiology.

4.  To identify "model systems" for studying particular physiological functions.
:Examples of this include using squid giant axons to understand general principles of nerve transmission, using rattlesnake tail shaker muscles for measurement of in vivo changes in metabolites (because the whole animal can be put in an NMR machine),&lt;ref name='Conley_Lindstedt_1996'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conley|first=K. E.|author2=S. L. Lindstedt|year=1996|title=Rattlesnake tail-shaking: minimal cost per twitch in striated muscle| url=|journal=Nature|issn=|volume=383|pmid=8779716|issue=6595|pages=71–73|doi=10.1038/383071a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of ectothermic poikilotherms to study effects of temperature on physiology.

5.  To use the "kind of animal" as an experimental variable.
: "While other branches of physiology use such variables as light, temperature, oxygen tension, and hormone balance, comparative physiology uses, in addition, species or animal type as a variable for each function." &lt;ref name='prosser1950'&gt;Prosser (1950, p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;
: 25 years later, Prosser put things this way: "I like to think of it as that method in physiology which uses kind of organism as one experimental variable."&lt;ref name='Prosser1975'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prosser|first=C. L.|year=1975|title=Prospects for comparative physiology and biochemistry| url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|issn=|volume=194|pmid=1194870|issue=1|pages=345–348|doi=10.1002/jez.1401940122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative physiologists often study organisms that live in "extreme" [[Natural environment|environments]] (e.g., deserts) because they expect to find especially clear examples of evolutionary adaptation.&lt;ref name='GarlandCarter1994'&gt;{{cite journal|last= [[Theodore Garland, Jr.|Garland]] |first=T., Jr.|author2=P. A. Carter|year=1994|title=Evolutionary physiology| url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/GarlCa94.pdf|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|issn=|volume=56|issue=|pages=579–621|doi=10.1146/annurev.ph.56.030194.003051|pmid= 8010752}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One example is the study of water balance in desert-inhabiting mammals, which have been found to exhibit kidney specializations.&lt;ref name='Al-kahtani_et_al_2004'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Al-kahtani|first=M.A. |author2=C. Zuleta |author3=E. Caviedes-Vidal |author4=[[Theodore Garland, Jr|T. Garland, Jr.]] |year=2004|title=Kidney mass and relative medullary thickness of rodents in relation to habitat, body size, and phylogeny| url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Al-kahtaniEA2004.pdf|journal=Physiological and Biochemical Zoology |issn=|volume=77|issue=3|pages=346–365|doi=10.1086/420941|pmid=15286910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, comparative physiologists have been attracted to "unusual" organisms, such as very large or small ones.  As an example, of the latter, [[hummingbirds]] have been studied.  As another example, [[giraffe]] have been studied because of their long necks and the expectation that this would lead to specializations related to the regulation of [[blood pressure]].  More generally, [[ectothermic]] [[vertebrates]] have been studied to determine how [[blood]] [[acid-base balance]] and [[pH]] change as [[body temperature]] changes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13805">In the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]], as in the [[Euclidean plane]], each point can be uniquely identified by two [[real number]]s. Several qualitatively different ways of coordinatizing the plane in hyperbolic geometry are used.

This article tries to give an overview of several coordinate systems in use for the two-dimensional hyperbolic plane.

In the descriptions below the constant [[Gaussian curvature]] of the plane is&amp;nbsp;−1. [[Hyperbolic function#Sinh|Sinh]], [[Hyperbolic function#Cosh|cosh]] and [[Hyperbolic function#Tanh|tanh]] are [[hyperbolic functions]].

==Polar coordinate system ==

[[Image:Examples of Polar Coordinates.svg|thumb|250px|Points in the polar coordinate system with pole ''O'' and polar axis ''L''. In green, the point with radial coordinate 3 and angular coordinate 60 degrees or {{nowrap|(3, 60°)}}. In blue, the point {{nowrap|(4, 210°)}}.]]

The '''polar coordinate system''' is a [[dimension|two-dimensional]] [[coordinate system]] in which each [[point (mathematics)|point]] on a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] is determined by a [[distance]] from a reference point and an [[angle]] from a reference direction.

The reference point (analogous to the origin of a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian system]]) is called the ''pole'', and the [[ray (geometry)|ray]] from the pole in the reference direction is the ''polar axis''. The distance from the pole is called the ''radial coordinate'' or ''radius'', and the angle is called the ''angular coordinate'', or ''polar angle''.

From the hyperbolic law of cosines, we get that the distance between two points given in polar coordinates is

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist} (\langle r_1, \theta_1 \rangle, \langle r_2, \theta_2 \rangle) = \operatorname{arcosh} \, \left( \cosh r_1 \cosh r_2 - \sinh r_1 \sinh r_2 \cos (\theta_2 - \theta_1) \right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding metric tensor is: &lt;math&gt; (\mathrm{d} s)^2 = (\mathrm{d} r)^2 + \sinh^2 r \, (\mathrm{d} \theta)^2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The straight lines are described by equations of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \theta = \theta_0 \pm \frac{\pi}{2} \quad \text{ or } \quad \tanh r = \tanh r_0 \sec (\theta - \theta_0) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are the coordinates of the nearest point on the line to the pole.

==Quadrant model system==
The [[Poincaré half-plane model]] is closely related to a model of the hyperbolic plane in the quadrant ''Q'' = {(''x,y''): ''x'' &gt; 0, ''y'' &gt; 0}. For such a point the [[geometric mean]] &lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt {x y} &lt;/math&gt; and the [[hyperbolic angle]] &lt;math&gt;u = \ln \sqrt {x/y}&lt;/math&gt; produce a point (''u,v'') in the upper half-plane. The hyperbolic metric in the quadrant depends on the Poincaré half-plane metric. The [[hyperbolic motion|motions]] of the Poincaré model carry over to the quadrant; in particular the left or right shifts of the real axis correspond to [[hyperbolic rotation]]s of the quadrant. Due to the study of ratios in physics and economics where the quadrant is the universe of discourse, its points are said to be located by [[hyperbolic coordinates]].

==Cartesian-style coordinate systems ==

In hyperbolic geometry [[rectangles]] do not exist. The sum of the angles of a quadrilateral in hyperbolic geometry is always less than 4 [[right angle]]s (see [[Lambert quadrilateral]]). Also in hyperbolic geometry there are no equidistant lines (see [[hypercycle (geometry)|hypercycles]]). This all has influences on the coordinate systems.

There are however different coordinate systems for hyperbolic plane geometry. All are based on choosing a real (non [[ideal point|ideal]]) point (the [[Origin (mathematics)|Origin]]) on a chosen directed line (the ''x''-axis) and after that many choices exist.

===Axial coordinates ===

Axial coordinates ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;  and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; are found by constructing a ''y''-axis perpendicular to the ''x''-axis through the origin.&lt;ref name="martin analytic"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=George E.|title=The foundations of geometry and the non-Euclidean plane|date=1998|publisher=Springer|location=New York, NY|isbn=0387906940|pages=447–450|edition=Corrected 4. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]], the coordinates are found by dropping perpendiculars from the point onto the ''x'' and ''y''-axes. ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; is the distance from the foot of the perpendicular on the ''x''-axis to the origin (regarded as positive on one side and negative on the other); ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; is the distance from the foot of the perpendicular on the ''y''-axis to the origin.

Every point and most [[ideal point]]s have axial coordinates, but not every pair of real numbers corresponds to a point.

If &lt;math&gt; \tanh^2 (x_a) + \tanh^2 (y_a) = 1 &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; P(x_a , y_a) &lt;/math&gt; is an ideal point.

If &lt;math&gt; \tanh^2 (x_a) + \tanh^2 (y_a) &gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; P(x_a , y_a) &lt;/math&gt; is not a point at all.

The distance of a point &lt;math&gt;P(x_a , y_a)&lt;/math&gt; to the ''x''-axis is &lt;math&gt;\operatorname {artanh}  \left( \tanh(y_a) \cosh(x_a) \right) &lt;/math&gt;.  To the ''y''-axis it is &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{artanh} \left( \tanh(x_a) \cosh(y_a) \right) &lt;/math&gt;.

The relationship of axial coordinates to polar coordinates (assuming the origin is the pole and that the positive ''x''-axis is the polar axis) is
:&lt;math&gt; x = \operatorname {artanh} \, (\tanh r \cos \theta) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y = \operatorname {artanh} \, (\tanh r \sin \theta) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; r = \operatorname {artanh} \, (\sqrt{\tanh^2 x + \tanh^2 y} \, ) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \theta = 2 \operatorname {artan} \, \left( \frac{\tanh y}{\tanh x + \sqrt{\tanh^2 x + \tanh^2 y} } \right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Lobachevsky coordinates===

The Lobachevsky coordinates ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''ℓ''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''ℓ''&lt;/sub&gt; are found by dropping a perpendicular onto the ''x''-axis. ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''ℓ''&lt;/sub&gt; is the distance from the foot of the perpendicular to the ''x''-axis to the origin (positive on one side and negative on the other, the same as in [[#Axial coordinates|axial coordinates]]).&lt;ref name="martin analytic"/&gt;

''y''&lt;sub&gt;''ℓ''&lt;/sub&gt; is the distance along the perpendicular of the given point to its foot (positive on one side and negative on the other).

: &lt;math&gt; x_l = x_a \  , \  \tanh(y_l) = \tanh(y_a) \cosh(x_a) \  , \  \tanh(y_a) = \frac{\tanh(y_l)}{\cosh(x_l)} &lt;/math&gt;.

The Lobachevsky coordinates are useful for integration for length of curves&lt;ref name="Smorgorzhevsky"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smorgorzhevsky|first1=A.S.|title=Lobachevskian  geometry|date=1982|publisher=Mir|location=Moscow|pages=64–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; and area between lines and curves.{{Example needed}}

Lobachevsky coordinates are named after [[Nikolai Lobachevsky]] one of the discoverers of [[hyperbolic geometry]].

Construct a Cartesian-like coordinate system as follows. Choose a line (the ''x''-axis) in the hyperbolic plane (with a standardized curvature of -1) and label the points on it by their distance from an origin (''x''=0) point on the ''x''-axis (positive on one side and negative on the other). For any point in the plane, one can define coordinates ''x'' and ''y'' by dropping a perpendicular onto the ''x''-axis. ''x'' will be the label of the foot of the perpendicular. ''y'' will be the distance along the perpendicular of the given point from its foot (positive on one side and negative on the other). Then the distance between two such points will be

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist} (\langle x_1, y_1 \rangle, \langle x_2, y_2 \rangle) = \operatorname{arcosh} \left( \cosh y_1 \cosh (x_2 - x_1) \cosh y_2 - \sinh y_1 \sinh y_2 \right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula can be derived from the formulas about [[hyperbolic triangle]]s.

The corresponding metric tensor is: &lt;math&gt; (\mathrm{d} s)^2 = \cosh^2 y \, (\mathrm{d} x)^2 + (\mathrm{d} y)^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

In this coordinate system, straight lines are either perpendicular to the ''x''-axis (with equation ''x'' = a constant) or described by equations of the form
:&lt;math&gt; \tanh y = A \cosh x + B \sinh x \quad \text{ when } \quad A^2 &lt; 1 + B^2 &lt;/math&gt;
where ''A'' and ''B'' are real parameters which characterize the straight line.

The relationship of Lobachevsky coordinates to polar coordinates (assuming the origin is the pole and that the positive ''x''-axis is the polar axis) is
:&lt;math&gt; x = \operatorname {artanh} \, (\tanh r \cos \theta) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y = \operatorname {arsinh} \, (\sinh r \sin \theta) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; r = \operatorname {arcosh} \, (\cosh x \cosh y) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \theta = 2 \operatorname {artan} \, \left( \frac{\sinh y}{\sinh x \cosh y + \sqrt{\cosh^2 x \cosh^2 y - 1} } \right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Horocycle-based coordinate system ===

[[File:Horocycle-based coordinate system.svg|thumb|Horocycle-based coordinate system]]

Another coordinate system uses the distance from the point to the [[horocycle]] through the origin centered around &lt;math&gt; \Omega = (0, + \infty )&lt;/math&gt; and the arclength along this horocycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramsay|first1=Arlan|last2=Richtmyer|first2=Robert D.|title=Introduction to hyperbolic geometry|date=1995|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=0387943390|pages=97–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Draw the [[horocycle]] ''h''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; through the origin centered at the [[ideal point]] &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; at the end of the ''x''-axis.

From point P draw the line ''p'' asymptotic to the ''x''-axis to the right [[ideal point]] &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt;. ''P''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; is the intersection of line ''p'' and horocycle ''h''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;.

The coordinate ''x''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;  is the distance from P to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; – positive if P is between ''P''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt;, negative if ''P''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; is between P and &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt;.

The coordinate ''y''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; is the arclength along horocycle ''h''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; from the origin to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;.

The distance between two points given in these coordinates is
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dist} (\langle x_1, y_1 \rangle, \langle x_2, y_2 \rangle) = \operatorname{arcosh} ( \cosh (x_2 - x_1) + \tfrac12 (y_2 - y_1)^2 \exp (- x_1 - x_2) ) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding metric tensor is: &lt;math&gt; (\mathrm{d} s)^2 = (\mathrm{d} x)^2 + \exp (-2 x) \, (\mathrm{d} y)^2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The straight lines are described by equations of the form ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;a constant or

:&lt;math&gt; x = \tfrac12 \ln ( \exp (2 x_0) - (y - y_0)^2 ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are the coordinates of the point on the line nearest to the ideal point &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. having the largest value of ''x'' on the line).

==Model-based coordinate systems ==

Model-based coordinate systems use one of the [[hyperbolic geometry#models of hyperbolic plane|models of hyperbolic geometry]] and take the Euclidean coordinates inside the model as the hyperbolic coordinates.

===Beltrami coordinates ===

The Beltrami coordinates of a point are the Euclidean coordinates of the point when the point is mapped in the [[Beltrami–Klein model]] of the hyperbolic plane, the ''x''-axis is mapped to the segment {{nowrap|(−1,0) − (1,0)}} and the origin is mapped to the centre of the boundary circle.&lt;ref name="martin analytic"/&gt;

The following equations hold:

: &lt;math&gt; x_b = \tanh (x_a), \  y_b = \tanh(y_a) &lt;/math&gt;

===Poincaré coordinates ===

The Poincaré coordinates of a point are the Euclidean coordinates of the point when the point is mapped in the [[Poincaré disk model]] of the hyperbolic plane,&lt;ref name="martin analytic"/&gt; the ''x''-axis is mapped to the segment {{nowrap|(−1,0) − (1,0)}} and the origin is mapped to the centre of the boundary circle.

The Poincaré coordinates, in terms of the Beltrami coordinates, are:

: &lt;math&gt; x_p = \frac{x_b}{1+\sqrt{1 -x_b^2 - y_b^2 }}, \ \ 
y_p = \frac{y_b}{1+\sqrt{1 -x_b^2 - y_b^2 }} &lt;/math&gt;

===Weierstrass coordinates ===

The Weierstrass coordinates of a point are the Euclidean coordinates of the point when the point is mapped in the [[hyperboloid model]] of the hyperbolic plane, the ''x''-axis is mapped to the (half) [[hyperbola]] &lt;math&gt;(t \ , \ 0 \ , \ \sqrt{t^2+1} ) &lt;/math&gt; and the origin is mapped to the point (0,0,1).&lt;ref name="martin analytic"/&gt;

The point P with axial coordinates (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;) is mapped to

: &lt;math&gt; \left( \frac{\tanh x_a}{\sqrt{1 -\tanh^2 x_a - \tanh^2 y_a }} \ ,
\ \frac{\tanh y_a}{\sqrt{1 -\tanh^2 x_a - \tanh^2 y_a }} \ ,
\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 -\tanh^2 x_a - \tanh^2 y_a }} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

===Hyperbolic barycentric coordinates===

From [[Gyrovector space#triangle center]]

The study of [[triangle center]]s traditionally is concerned with Euclidean geometry, but triangle centers can also be studied in hyperbolic geometry. Using gyrotrigonometry, expressions for trigonometric barycentric coordinates can be calculated that have the same form for both euclidean and hyperbolic geometry. In order for the expressions to coincide, the expressions must ''not'' encapsulate the specification of the anglesum being 180 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajmaa.org/searchroot/files/pdf/v6n1/v6i1p18.pdf Hyperbolic Barycentric Coordinates],

In a more general sense, the term is used for such words also when they are not used as a reflex-like answer and even for any widely used words that (due to a similar change) now have a broad and vague range of meanings in many very different situations (e.g. case, awfully, fix, job, payoff).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.word.com/idictionary/counterword+|title=Definition of COUNTERWORD|website=i.word.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since such change due to very frequent use occurs much more rapidly than the change in meaning all words go through, and since such words are even sometimes still simultaneously used in their original sense, the new usage is often considered incorrect by some speakers. Other examples include ''nice'', ''terrific'', ''terrible'', ''awful'', ''tremendous'', ''swell'', ''hopefully'' and ''very fine'' (degrading the meaning of ''fine'' to "OK").

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' does not support this and defines counter-word as "countersign", noting that its usage is military and obsolete with a single quotation from 1678.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/43064?redirectedFrom=counterword#eid "counter-word"], ''Oxford English Dictionary''.

'''Dino Ciccarelli''' (born February 8, 1960) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] former professional [[ice hockey|hockey]] player who played 19 seasons in the [[National Hockey League]], primarily with the [[Minnesota North Stars]], but also notably with the [[Detroit Red Wings]], with whom he had his third-highest scoring season. He scored 1,200 points in his NHL career.  His 608 career NHL goals are also the most goals scored by a draft-eligible player who was not drafted by an NHL team.&lt;ref name=recordsbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Banks|first=Don Weekes &amp; Kerry|title=The unofficial guide to even more of hockey's most unusual records|year=2004|publisher=Greystone Books|location=Vancouver [etc.]|isbn=1-55365-062-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Wayne Gretzky was not draft-eligible as he began his pro career at age 17 in the WHA.--&gt; Ciccarelli was elected to the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 2010.

==Playing career==

===Sarnia Bees===
Ciccarelli grew up playing minor hockey in his hometown of [[Sarnia]], [[Ontario]] in the Southwestern Ontario Minor Hockey League of the [[Ontario Minor Hockey Association]]. He made Sarnia's Jr. 'B' hockey team as a 15-year-old in the fall of 1975 and ended up leading it in scoring with 45 goals and 43 assists for 88 points in just 40 games. He is one of two Sarnia Jr. 'B' graduates to go on to be elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame (the other being [[Phil Esposito]], who led the [[Sarnia Legionnaires (1954–1970)|Sarnia Legionnaires]] in scoring in 1961).

===London Knights===
Ciccarelli joined the [[London Knights]] of the [[Ontario Major Junior Hockey League|OMJHL]] as a 16-year-old for the [[1976-77 OMJHL season|1976-77]] season.  In his first season with the Knights, Ciccarelli had 39 goals and 82 points in 66 games, finishing fifth in team scoring.  In the playoffs, Ciccarelli had 11 goals and 24 points in 20 games, as London lost to the [[Ottawa 67's]] in the [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]] finals.

In his second season with the Knights in [[1977-78 OMJHL season|1977-78]], Ciccarelli scored a league high 72 goals, and added 70 assists for 142 points, which was third highest total in the OMJHL.  In the post-season, Ciccarelli contributed six goals and 16 points in nine games.  After the season, Ciccarelli was awarded the [[Jim Mahon Memorial Trophy]], which is given to the highest scoring right winger in the OMJHL.

Injuries cut short Ciccarelli's [[1978-79 OMJHL season|1978-79]] season, as he appeared in only 30 games, scoring eight goals and 19 points.  In seven playoff games, Ciccarelli scored three goals and eight points.  After not being selected in the [[NHL Entry Draft]], Ciccarelli signed a contract with the [[Minnesota North Stars]] on September 28, 1979.

The North Stars kept Ciccarelli with the Knights for the [[1979-80 OMJHL season|1979-80]], and Ciccarelli rebounded, scoring 50 goals and 103 points.  In five games in the playoffs, Ciccarelli scored two goals, and finished with eight points.

===Minnesota North Stars===
Ciccarelli made his professional hockey debut with the [[Oklahoma City Stars (ice hockey)|Oklahoma City Stars]] of the [[Central Hockey League (1963-1984)|CHL]] at the end of the 1979-80 season.  In six games with Oklahoma City, Ciccarelli had three goals and five points.

He spent most of the 1980-81 season with Oklahoma City, playing in 48 games, scoring 32 goals and 57 points.  Ciccarelli was brought up to the [[National Hockey League]], and in 32 games with the [[Minnesota North Stars]], Ciccarelli had 18 goals and 30 points.  In the playoffs, Ciccarelli scored 14 goals and 21 points in 19 games, as the North Stars lost to the [[New York Islanders]] in the [[1981 Stanley Cup Finals]].

Ciccarelli spent the entire [[1981-82 NHL season]] with the North Stars, playing in 76 games, scoring a team high 55 goals, while earning 106 points for the season. During the season, Ciccarelli played in the [[1982 NHL All-Star Game]], hosted by the [[Washington Capitals]], with the [[Campbell Conference]], where he assisted on a goal by [[Wayne Gretzky]] in a 4-2 loss to the [[Wales Conference]].  In the playoffs, Ciccarelli had three goals and four points in four games.

He saw a decrease in offensive production during the [[1982-83 NHL season|1982-83]] season, scoring 37 goals and 75 points in 77 games, which was 18 fewer goals and 31 less points than the previous season. Ciccarelli did appear in the [[1983 NHL All-Star Game]], hosted by the [[New York Islanders]].  Ciccarelli had a goal and an assist as the [[Campbell Conference]] defeated the [[Wales Conference]] 9-3. In the post-season, Ciccarelli appeared in nine games, scoring four goals and 10 points.

Ciccarelli had another solid season with Minnesota in [[1983-84 NHL season|1983-84]], scoring 38 goals and 71 points in 79 games, helping the North Stars into the playoffs once again. In 16 playoff games, Ciccarelli had four goals and nine points, as the North Stars lost to the [[Edmonton Oilers]] in the [[Campbell Conference]] finals.

Injuries cut short Ciccarelli's season in [[1984-85 NHL season|1984-85]], playing in only 51 games, Ciccarelli scored 15 goals and 32 points, his lowest point total since his rookie season in 1980-81, and the lowest goal total of his NHL career. In nine playoff games, Ciccarelli had three goals and six points.

Ciccarelli had a healthy [[1985-86 NHL season|1985-86]] season, playing in 75 games, he led the North Stars with 44 goals, while finishing second in points with 89, which were his highest totals since 1981-82. In five playoff games, Ciccarelli was held to an assist.

In [[1986-87 NHL season|1986-87]], Ciccarelli improved his offensive numbers once again, scoring 52 goals and 103 points in 80 games, which both led the club in scoring.  The North Stars struggled during the season, and failed to qualify for the post season.

Ciccarelli had his third straight 40+ goal season in [[1987-88 NHL season|1987-88]], as he once again led Minnesota with 41 goals and 86 points in 67 games.  It was another tough season for the team though, as they missed the playoffs for the second straight season.

In [[1988-89 NHL season|1988-89]], Ciccarelli made his first all-star game appearance in six years, as he played with the [[Campbell Conference]] in the [[1989 NHL All-Star Game]] held in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]]. In the game, Ciccarelli assisted on a goal by [[Steve Yzerman]], as the [[Campbell Conference]] won the game over the [[Wales Conference]] by a score of 9-5. Overall with Minnesota, Ciccarelli played in 65 games, scoring 32 goals and 59 points. On March 7, 1989, the North Stars traded Ciccarelli and [[Bob Rouse]] to the [[Washington Capitals]] for [[Mike Gartner]] and [[Larry Murphy (ice hockey)|Larry Murphy]].

===Washington Capitals===
Ciccarelli finished the [[1988-89 NHL season|1988-89]] season with the [[Washington Capitals]], playing just 11 games, Ciccarelli scored 12 goals and 15 points, helping the team into the playoffs.  He played his first game as a Capital on March 8, 1989, getting no points in a 3-2 loss to the [[Montreal Canadiens]].  He scored his first goal with Washington on March 11, 1989, scoring against [[John Vanbiesbrouck]] in a 4-2 win over the [[New York Rangers]].  On March 18, 1989, Ciccarelli had a four-goal, seven point game in a huge 8-2 victory over the [[Hartford Whalers]].  Ciccarelli appeared in his first playoff game with the Capitals on April 5, 1989, getting no points in a 3-2 win over the [[Philadelphia Flyers]].  He scored his first playoff goal with Washington on April 6, 1989, scoring against [[Ron Hextall]] in a 3-2 loss.  Ciccarelli played in six games, scoring three goals and six points as the Capitals were eliminated by the Flyers.

In Ciccarelli's first full season with the Capitals, he scored 41 goals in [[1989-90 NHL season|1989-90]], which marked his fifth consecutive season of 40+ goals, while finishing with a team high 79 points.

His junior team, the [[London Knights]], also retired Ciccarelli's number 8.

Ciccarelli owned the nightclub Club 22 in [[Shelby Charter Township, Michigan|Shelby Charter Township]], named for the jersey number he wore with the Capitals, Red Wings, Lightning and Panthers.  It was closed in 2011. Shortly after closing, Ciccarelli opened a sports bar in the same location. The name of the establishment is Ciccarelli's Sports Bar Theater, named after the "theater" style atmosphere.&lt;ref name=oak10Feb2011&gt;{{cite news|last=Hotts|first=Mitch|title=Ciccarelli to close Club 22, score again with new sports bar in Shelby Township|url=http://www.theoaklandpress.com/articles/2011/02/10/news/doc4d53f5acf2418683427874.txt|accessdate=14 April 2011|newspaper=[[The Oakland Press]]|date=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since opened two additional sports bars, one across from the [[Palace of Auburn Hills]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mathes|first=Dale|title=A Taste of Hockeytown Comes to Auburn Hills|url=http://auburnhillsdevelopment.com/2014/02/17/a-taste-of-hockeytown-comes-to-auburn-hills/|date=7 February 2014|website=Developing Thoughts|access-date=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other at the site of the former Post Bar in downtown Detroit, near [[Cobo Center]]. The Detroit location is only open for Red Wings home games and other special events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redwings.nhl.com/club/blogpost.htm?id=20916|title=Ciccarelli re-opens old Detroit landmark|last=Roose|first=Bill|date=1 October 2013|website=The Wheel Deal|publisher=Detroit Red Wings|access-date=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], '''emergentism''' is the belief in [[emergence]], particularly as it involves [[consciousness]] and the [[philosophy of mind]], and as it contrasts (or not) with [[reductionism]]. A property of a [[system]] is said to be emergent if it is a new outcome of some other properties of the system and their interaction, while it is itself  different from them.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Timothy and Wong, Hong Yu, "Emergent Properties", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/properties-emergent/&gt;.
&lt;/ref&gt; Emergent properties are not identical with, reducible to, or deducible from the other properties. The different ways in which this independence requirement can be satisfied lead to variant types of emergence.

== Forms ==
All varieties of emergentism strive to be compatible with [[physicalism]],{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} the theory that the universe is composed exclusively of physical entities, and in particular with the evidence relating changes in the brain with changes in mental functioning. Many forms of emergentism, including proponents of complex adaptive systems, do not hold a material but rather a relational or processural view of the universe. Furthermore, they view [[mind–body dualism]] as a conceptual error insofar as mind and body are merely different types of relationships. As a theory of mind (which it is not always), emergentism differs from [[idealism]], [[eliminative materialism]], [[identity theory of mind|identity theories]], [[neutral monism]], [[panpsychism]], and [[substance dualism]], whilst being closely associated with [[property dualism]]. It is generally not obvious whether an emergent theory of mind embraces [[mental causation]] or must be considered [[epiphenomenal]].

Some varieties of emergentism are not specifically concerned with the [[mind–body problem]], and instead suggest a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] or layered view of the whole of nature, with the layers arranged in terms of increasing [[complexity]] with each requiring its own [[special science]]. Typically [[physics]] ([[mathematical physics]], [[particle physics]], and [[classical physics]]) is basic, with [[chemistry]] built on top of it, then [[biology]], [[psychology]], and [[social sciences]]. Reductionists respond that the arrangement of the sciences is a matter of convenience, and that chemistry is derivable from physics (and so forth) ''in principle'', an argument which gained force after the establishment of a quantum-mechanical basis for chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Crane, T. ''The Significance of Emergence''&lt;/ref&gt;

Other varieties see [[mind]] or [[consciousness]] as specifically and anomalously requiring emergentist explanation, and therefore constitute a family of positions in the [[philosophy of mind]]. [[Douglas Hofstadter]] summarises this view as ''"the soul is more than the sum of its parts"''. A number of philosophers have offered the argument that [[qualia]] constitute the [[hard problem of consciousness]], and resist reductive explanation in a way that all other phenomena do not. In contrast, reductionists generally see the task of accounting for the possibly atypical properties of mind and of living things as a matter of showing that, contrary to appearances, such properties are indeed fully accountable in terms of the properties of the basic constituents of nature and therefore in no way genuinely atypical.

Intermediate positions are possible: for instance, some emergentists hold that emergence is neither universal nor restricted to consciousness, but applies to (for instance) living creatures, or [[self-organising]] systems, or [[complex systems]].

Some philosophers hold that emergent properties causally interact with more fundamental levels, an idea known as [[downward causation]]. Others maintain that higher-order properties simply [[supervene]] over lower levels without direct causal interaction.

All the cases so far discussed have been synchronic, i.e. the emergent property exists simultaneously with its basis.
Yet another variation operates diachronically. Emergentists of this type believe that ''genuinely novel properties'' can come into being, without being accountable in terms of the preceding history of the universe. (Contrast with [[indeterminism]] where it is only the ''arrangement or configuration'' of matter that is unaccountable). These evolution-inspired theories often have a [[theological]] aspect, as in the [[process philosophy]] of [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Charles Hartshorne]].

== Relationship to vitalism ==

A refinement of [[vitalism]] may be recognized in contemporary molecular histology in the proposal that some key organising and structuring features of organisms, perhaps including even life itself, are examples of [[emergence|emergent process]]es; those in which a complexity arises, out of interacting chemical processes forming interconnected feedback cycles, that cannot fully be described in terms of those processes since the system as a whole has properties that the constituent reactions lack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schultz | first1 = SG | title = A century of (epithelial) transport physiology: from vitalism to molecular cloning | journal = The American Journal of Physiology | volume = 274 | issue = 1 Pt 1 | pages = C13–23 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9458708 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gilbert | first1 = SF | last2 = Sarkar | first2 = S | title = Embracing complexity: organicism for the 21st century | journal = Developmental Dynamics | volume = 219 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–9 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10974666 | doi = 10.1002/1097-0177(2000)9999:9999&lt;::AID-DVDY1036&gt;3.0.CO;2-A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether emergent system properties should be grouped with traditional vitalist concepts is a matter of semantic controversy.&lt;ref&gt;see "Emergent Properties" in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. online at [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties-emergent/ Stanford University] for explicit discussion; briefly, some philosophers see emergentism as midway between traditional spiritual vitalism and mechanistic reductionism; others argue that, structurally, emergentism is equivalent to vitalism. See also Emmeche C (2001) Does a robot have an Umwelt?

According to Emmeche ''et al.'' (1997):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"On the one hand, many scientists and philosophers regard emergence as having only a pseudo-scientific status. On the other hand, new developments in physics, biology, psychology, and crossdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science, artificial life, and the study of non-linear dynamical systems have focused strongly on the high level 'collective behaviour' of complex systems, which is often said to be truly emergent, and the term is increasingly used to characterize such systems."&lt;ref name ="Emmeche 1997"&gt;Emmeche C (1997) EXPLAINING EMERGENCE:towards an ontology of levels. Journal for General Philosophy of Science [http://www.nbi.dk/~emmeche/coPubl/97e.EKS/emerg.html available online]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Emmeche ''et al.'' (1998) state that "there is a very important difference between the vitalists and the emergentists: the vitalist's creative forces were relevant only in organic substances, not in inorganic matter. Emergence hence is creation of new properties regardless of the substance involved." "The assumption of an extra-physical vitalis (vital force, [[entelechy]], [[élan vital]], etc.), as formulated in most forms (old or new) of vitalism, is usually without any genuine explanatory power. It has served altogether too often as an [[intellectual tranquilizer]] or [[verbal sedative]]—stifling scientific inquiry rather than encouraging it to proceed in new directions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhicontrib2.cgi?id=dv3-69 Dictionary of the History of Ideas&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511191629/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhicontrib2.cgi?id=dv3-69 |date=2011-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===John Stuart Mill===
[[John Stuart Mill]] outlined his version of emergentism in ''[[System of Logic]]'' (1843). Mill argued that the properties of some physical systems, such as those in which [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic forces]] combine to produce simple motions, are subject to a law of nature he called the "[[Composition of Causes]]". According to Mill, emergent properties are not subject to this law, but instead amount to more than the sums of the properties of their parts.

Mill believed that various [[chemical reaction]]s (poorly understood in his time) could provide examples of emergent properties, although some critics believe that modern [[physical chemistry]] has shown that these reactions can be given satisfactory [[reductionist]] explanations. For instance, it has been claimed by Dirac that the whole of chemistry is, in principle,
contained in the [[Schrödinger equation]].&lt;ref&gt;

===C. D. Broad===
British philosopher [[C. D. Broad]] defended a realistic [[epistemology]] in ''[[The Mind and its Place in Nature]]'' (1925) arguing that [[emergent materialism]] is the most likely solution to the mind–body problem.

Broad defined emergence as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Put in abstract terms the emergent theory asserts that there are certain wholes, composed (say)
of constituents A, B, and C in a relation R to each other; that all wholes composed of
constituents of the same kind as A, B, and C in relations of the same kind as R have certain
characteristic properties; that A, B, and C are capable of occurring in other kinds of complex
where the relation is not of the same kind as R; and that the characteristic properties of the
whole R(A, B, C) cannot, even in theory, be deduced from the most complete knowledge of
the properties of A, B, and C in isolation or in other wholes which are not of the form R(A, B,
C).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This definition amounted to the claim that mental properties would count as emergent if and only if [[philosophical zombie]]s were metaphysically possible{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. Many philosophers take this position to be inconsistent with some formulations of [[psychophysical parallelism|psychophysical]] [[supervenience]].

===C. Lloyd Morgan and Samuel Alexander===
[[Samuel Alexander]]'s views on emergentism, argued in ''[[Space, Time, and Deity]]'' (1920), were inspired in part by the ideas in psychologist [[C. Lloyd Morgan]]'s ''[[Emergent evolution|Emergent Evolution]]''. Alexander believed that emergence was fundamentally inexplicable, and that emergentism was simply a "brute empirical fact":

"The higher quality emerges from the lower level of existence and has its roots therein, but it emerges therefrom, and it does not belong to that level, but constitutes its possessor a new order of existent with its special laws of behaviour. The existence of emergent qualities thus described is something to be noted, as some would say, under the compulsion of brute empirical fact, or, as I should prefer to say in less harsh terms, to be accepted with the “natural piety” of the investigator. It admits no explanation." ([[Space, Time, and Deity]])

Despite the causal and explanatory gap between the phenomena on different levels, Alexander held that emergent qualities were ''not'' [[epiphenomenal]]. His view can perhaps best be described as a form of [[non-reductive physicalism]] (NRP) or [[supervenience]] theory.

=== Ludwig von Bertalanffy ===
[[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] founded [[general system theory]] (GST), which is a more contemporary approach to emergentism. A popularization of many of the elements of GST may be found in ''[[The Web of Life]]'' by [[Fritjof Capra]].

=== Jaegwon Kim ===
[[Image:Figure1.gif|thumb|right|Figure demonstration how M1 and M2 are not reduced to P1 and P2.]]
Addressing emergentism  (under the guise of [[non-reductive physicalism]]) as a solution to the [[mind–body problem]] [[Jaegwon Kim]] has raised an objection based on [[causal closure]] and [[overdetermination]].

Emergentism strives to be compatible with physicalism, and physicalism, according to Kim, has a principle of causal closure according to which every physical event is fully accountable in terms of physical causes. This seems to leave no "room"
for [[mental causation]] to operate. If our bodily movements were caused by the preceding state of our bodies ''and'' our decisions and intentions, they would be overdetermined. Mental causation in this sense is not
the same as [[free will]], but is only the claim that mental states are causally relevant. If emergentists respond by abandoning the idea of mental causation, their position becomes a form of [[epiphenomenalism]].

In detail: he proposes (using the chart on the right) that ''M1'' causes ''M2'' (these are mental events) and ''P1'' causes ''P2'' (these are physical events). ''P1'' realises ''M1'' and ''P2'' realises ''M2''. However ''M1'' does not causally effect ''P1'' (i.e., ''M1'' is a [[consequent]] event of ''P1''). If ''P1'' causes ''P2'', and ''M1'' is a result of ''P1'', then ''M2'' is a result of ''P2''. He says that the only alternatives to this problem is to accept [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] (where the mental events are independent of the physical events) or [[eliminativism]] (where the mental events do not exist).&lt;!--Crane and Sperry-http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=11&amp;ved=0CBUQFjAAOAo&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fweb.mac.com%2Fcranetim%2FTims_website%2FOnline_papers_files%2FSignificance%2520of%2520emergence.pdf&amp;rct=j&amp;q=sperry%20emergentism&amp;ei=RKBtTZipM4is8AOZ262RBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHTERxqtuGVtJkSRPN2oLVodix0rw&amp;cad=rja--&gt;

'''Environmental economics''' is a sub-field of [[economics]] that is concerned with environmental issues. It has become a widely studied topic due to growing concerns in regards to the environment in the twentyfirst century. Quoting from the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] Environmental Economics program:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... Environmental Economics ... undertakes theoretical or empirical studies of the economic effects of national or local environmental policies around the world ... . Particular issues include the costs and benefits of alternative environmental policies to deal with air pollution, water quality, toxic substances, solid waste, and global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Environmental economics is distinguished from [[ecological economics]] in that ecological economics emphasizes the economy as a subsystem of the ecosystem with its focus upon preserving [[natural capital]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eoearth.org/article/Environmental_and_ecological_economics Lead Author: Robert Nadeau Article Topics: Ecological economics and Environmental economics Last Updated: August 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeroen C.J.M. van den Bergh (2001).

Ecological Economics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics and concepts==
{{Economics sidebar}}

===Market failure===
Central to environmental economics is the concept of [[market failure]].  Market failure means that markets fail to allocate resources efficiently. As stated by Hanley, Shogren, and White (2007) in their textbook ''Environmental Economics'':&lt;ref&gt;Hanley, N., J. Shogren, and B. White (2007). Environmental Economics in Theory and Practice, Palgrave, London.&lt;/ref&gt; "A market failure occurs when the market does not allocate scarce resources to generate the greatest social welfare. A wedge exists between what a private person does given market prices and what society might want him or her to do to protect the environment.  Such a wedge implies wastefulness or economic inefficiency; resources can be reallocated to make at least one person better off without making anyone else worse off." Common forms of market failure include externalities, non-excludability and [[Rivalry (economics)|non-rivalry]].

===Externality===
An [[externality]] exists when a person makes a choice that affects other people in a way that is not accounted for in the market price. An externality can be positive or negative, but is usually associated with negative externalities in environmental economics. For instance, water seepage in residential buildings happen in upper floor affect the lower floor.&lt;ref&gt;Rita Yi Man Li (2012), The Internalisation Of Environmental Externalities Affecting Dwellings: A Review Of Court Cases In Hong Kong, Economic Affairs, Volume 32, Issue 2, pages 81–87&lt;/ref&gt; Another example concerns how the sale of Amazon timber disregards the amount of carbon dioxide released in the cutting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Environmental degradation replaces classic imperialism|last=Chapman|first=Same|date=May 3, 2012|work=The Whitman College Pioneer: Whitman College|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2018}} Or a firm emitting [[pollution]] will typically not take into account the costs that its pollution imposes on others.  As a result, pollution may occur in excess of the 'socially efficient' level, which is the level that would exist if the market was required to account for the pollution. A classic definition influenced by [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[James Meade]] is provided by Heller and Starrett (1976), who define an externality as "a situation in which the private economy lacks sufficient incentives to create a potential market in some good and the nonexistence of this market results in losses of [[Pareto efficiency]]".&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Walter P. and David A. Starrett (1976), On the Nature of Externalities, in: Lin, Stephen A.Y. (ed.), Theory and Measurement of Economic Externalities, Academic Press, New York, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;  In economic terminology, externalities are examples of [[market failure]]s, in which the unfettered market does not lead to an efficient outcome.

===Common goods and public goods===
When it is too costly to exclude some people from access to an environmental resource, the resource is either called a [[common-pool resource|common property resource]] (when there is rivalry for the resource, such that one person's use of the resource reduces others' opportunity to use the resource) or a [[public good]] (when use of the resource is [[rivalry (economics)|non-rivalrous]]). In either case of non-exclusion, market allocation is likely to be inefficient.

These challenges have long been recognized. [[Garrett Hardin|Hardin]]'s (1968) concept of the [[tragedy of the commons]] popularized the challenges involved in non-exclusion and common property. "Commons" refers to the environmental asset itself, "common property resource" or "common pool resource" refers to a property right regime that allows for some collective body to devise schemes to exclude others, thereby allowing the capture of future benefit streams; and "open-access" implies no ownership in the sense that property everyone owns nobody owns.&lt;ref name="Ostrom, E 1990"&gt;Ostrom, E. 1990. Governing the Commons. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic problem is that if people ignore the scarcity value of the commons, they can end up expending too much effort, [[over harvesting]] a resource (e.g., a fishery). Hardin theorizes that in the absence of restrictions, users of an open-access resource will use it more than if they had to pay for it and had exclusive rights, leading to [[environmental degradation]].  See, however, [[Elinor Ostrom|Ostrom]]'s (1990) work on how people using real common property resources have worked to establish self-governing rules to reduce the risk of the tragedy of the commons.&lt;ref name="Ostrom, E 1990"/&gt;

The [[mitigation of climate change]] effects is an example of a public good, where the social benefits are not reflected completely in the market price. This is a public good since the risks of climate change are both non-rival and non-excludable.  Such efforts are non-rival since climate mitigation provided to one does not reduce the level of mitigation that anyone else enjoys.  They are non-excludable actions as they will have global consequences from which no one can be excluded. A country's incentive to invest in carbon abatement is reduced because it can "[[Free rider problem|free ride]]" off the efforts of other countries. Over a century ago, Swedish economist [[Knut Wicksell]] (1896) first discussed how public goods can be under-provided by the market because people might conceal their preferences for the good, but still enjoy the benefits without paying for them.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Valuation ===
Assessing the economic value of the environment is a major topic within the field. Use and indirect use are tangible benefits accruing from [[natural resource]]s or [[ecosystem services]] (see the [[Ecological economics#Nature|nature section]] of ecological economics). Non-use values include existence, option, and bequest values. For example, some people may value the existence of a diverse set of species, regardless of the effect of the loss of a species on ecosystem services. The existence of these species may have an option value, as there may be the possibility of using it for some human purpose. For example, certain plants may be researched for drugs. Individuals may value the ability to leave a pristine environment to their children.

Use and indirect use values can often be inferred from revealed behavior, such as the cost of taking [[travel cost analysis|recreational trips]] or using [[hedonic model|hedonic methods]] in which values are estimated based on observed prices.  Non-use values are usually estimated using stated preference methods such as [[contingent valuation]] or [[choice modelling]]. Contingent valuation typically takes the form of surveys in which people are asked how much they would pay to observe and recreate in the environment ([[willingness to pay]]) or their willingness to accept (WTA) compensation for the destruction of the environmental good. [[Hedonic pricing]] examines the effect the environment has on economic decisions through housing prices, traveling expenses, and payments to visit parks.&lt;ref&gt;Harris J. (2006). ''Environmental and Natural Resource Economics: A Contemporary Approach''. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solutions==
Solutions advocated to correct such externalities include:

* '' [[United States Environmental Protection Agency#Related legislation|Environmental regulations]]''. Under this plan, the economic impact has to be estimated by the regulator. Usually this is done using [[cost-benefit analysis]].  There is a growing realization that regulations (also known as "command and control" instruments) are not so distinct from economic instruments as is commonly asserted by proponents of environmental economics.  E.g.1 regulations are enforced by fines, which operate as a form of tax if pollution rises above the threshold prescribed.  E.g.2 pollution must be monitored and laws enforced, whether under a pollution tax regime or a regulatory regime.  The main difference an environmental economist would argue exists between the two methods, however, is the total cost of the regulation.  "Command and control" regulation often applies uniform emissions limits on polluters, even though each firm has different costs for emissions reductions.  Some firms, in this system, can abate inexpensively, while others can only abate at high cost.  Because of this, the total abatement has some expensive and some inexpensive efforts to abate.  Consequently, modern "Command and control" regulations are oftentimes designed in a way, which addresses these issues by incorporating utility parameters. For instance, CO2 emission standards for specific manufacturers in the automotive industry are either linked to the average vehicle footprint (US system) or average vehicle weight (EU system) of their entire vehicle fleet. Environmental economic regulations find the cheapest emission abatement efforts first, then the more expensive methods second.  E.g. as said earlier, trading, in the quota system, means a firm only abates if doing so would cost less than paying someone else to make the same reduction.  This leads to a lower cost for the total abatement effort as a whole.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* ''[[quota on pollution|Quotas on pollution]]''. Often it is advocated that pollution reductions should be achieved by way of [[tradeable emissions permits]], which if freely traded may ensure that reductions in pollution are achieved at least cost. In theory, if such tradeable quotas are allowed, then a firm would reduce its own pollution load only if doing so would cost less than paying someone else to make the same reduction.  In practice, tradeable permits approaches have had some success, such as the U.S.'s sulphur dioxide trading program or the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, and interest in its application is spreading to other environmental problems.
* ''[[Tax, tariff and trade|Taxes and tariffs on pollution]]''. Increasing the costs of polluting will discourage polluting, and will provide a "dynamic incentive," that is, the disincentive continues to operate even as pollution levels fall.  A pollution tax that reduces pollution to the socially "optimal" level would be set at such a level that pollution occurs only if the benefits to society (for example, in form of greater production) exceeds the costs. Some advocate a major shift from taxation from income and sales taxes to tax on pollution - the so-called "[[green tax shift]]."
* ''Better defined [[property rights]]''. The [[Coase Theorem]] states that assigning property rights will lead to an optimal solution, regardless of who receives them, if [[transaction costs]] are trivial and the number of parties negotiating is limited. For example, if people living near a factory had a right to clean air and water, or the factory had the right to pollute, then either the factory could pay those affected by the pollution or the people could pay the factory not to pollute. Or, citizens could take action themselves as they would if other property rights were violated. The US River Keepers Law of the 1880s was an early example, giving citizens downstream the right to end pollution upstream themselves if government itself did not act (an early example of [[bioregional democracy]]).  Many markets for "pollution rights" have been created in the late twentieth century—see [[emissions trading]]. According to the Coase Theorem, the involved parties will bargain with each other, which results in an efficient solution. However, modern economic theory has shown that the presence of asymmetric information may lead to inefficient bargaining outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Myerson|first=Roger B|last2=Satterthwaite|first2=Mark A|date=1983|title=Efficient mechanisms for bilateral trading|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0531(83)90048-0|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|volume=29|issue=2|pages=265–281|doi=10.1016/0022-0531(83)90048-0|issn=0022-0531|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Rob (1989) has shown that pollution claim settlements will not lead to the socially optimal outcome when the individuals that will be affected by pollution have learned private information about their disutility already before the negotiations take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rob|first=Rafael|date=1989|title=Pollution claim settlements under private information|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0531(89)90022-7|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|volume=47|issue=2|pages=307–333|doi=10.1016/0022-0531(89)90022-7|issn=0022-0531|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldlücke and Schmitz (2018) have shown that inefficiencies may also result if the parties learn their private information only after the negotiations, provided that the feasible transfer payments are bounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldlücke|first=Susanne|last2=Schmitz|first2=Patrick W.|date=2018|title=Pollution claim settlements reconsidered: Hidden information and bounded payments|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2018.08.005|journal=European Economic Review|volume=110|pages=211–222|doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2018.08.005|issn=0014-2921|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
Environmental economics is related to [[ecological economics]] but there are differences. Most environmental economists have been trained as economists. They apply the tools of economics to address environmental problems, many of which are related to so-called market failures—circumstances wherein the "[[invisible hand]]" of economics is unreliable.  Most ecological economists have been trained as ecologists, but have expanded the scope of their work to consider the impacts of humans and their economic activity on ecological systems and services, and vice versa. This field takes as its premise that economics is a strict subfield of [[ecology]].  Ecological economics is sometimes described as taking a more pluralistic approach to [[natural environment|environmental]] problems and focuses more explicitly on long-term environmental sustainability and issues of scale.

Environmental economics is viewed as more pragmatic in a [[price system]]; ecological economics as more idealistic in its attempts not to use [[money]] as a primary arbiter of decisions. These two groups of specialists sometimes have conflicting views which may be traced to the different philosophical underpinnings.

Another context in which [[Externality|externalities]] apply is when [[globalization]] permits one player in a market who is unconcerned with [[biodiversity]] to undercut prices of another who is - creating a [[race to the bottom]] in regulations and conservation. This, in turn, may cause loss of [[natural capital]] with consequent erosion, water purity problems, diseases, desertification, and other outcomes which are not [[Pareto efficiency|efficient]] in an economic sense. This concern is related to the subfield of [[sustainable development]] and its political relation, the [[anti-globalization movement]].

Environmental economics was once distinct from [[resource economics]]. Natural resource economics as a subfield began when the main concern of researchers was the optimal commercial exploitation of natural resource stocks. But resource managers and policy-makers eventually began to pay attention to the broader importance of natural resources (e.g. values of fish and trees beyond just their commercial exploitation). It is now difficult to distinguish "environmental" and "natural resource" economics as separate fields as the two became associated with [[sustainability]].  Many of the more radical [[green economists]] split off to work on an alternate [[political economy]].

Environmental economics was a major influence on the theories of [[natural capitalism]] and [[environmental finance]], which could be said to be two sub-branches of environmental economics concerned with resource conservation in production, and the [[value of biodiversity]] to humans, respectively.  The theory of [[natural capitalism]] (Hawken, Lovins, Lovins) goes further than traditional environmental economics by envisioning a world where natural services are considered on par with [[Capital (economics)|physical capital]].

The more radical [[Green economists]] reject neoclassical economics in favour of a new [[political economy]] beyond [[capitalism]] or [[communism]] that gives a greater emphasis to the interaction of the human economy and the natural environment, acknowledging that "economy is three-fifths of ecology" - Mike Nickerson.

These more radical approaches would imply changes to [[money supply]] and likely also a [[bioregional democracy]] so that political, economic, and ecological "environmental limits" were all aligned, and not subject to the [[arbitrage]] normally possible under [[capitalism]].

An emerging sub-field of environmental economics studies its intersection with [[development economics]]. Dubbed "envirodevonomics" by [[Michael Greenstone]] and B. Kelsey Jack in their paper "Envirodevonomics: A Research Agenda for a Young Field," the sub-field is primarily interested in studying "why environmental quality [is] so poor in developing countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greenstone |first1=Michael |last2=Jack |first2=B. Kelsey |title=Envirodevonomics: A Research Agenda for an Emerging Field |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=5–42 |doi=10.1257/jel.53.1.5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A strategy for better understanding this correlation between a country's GDP and its environmental quality involves analyzing how many of the central concepts of environmental economics, including market failures, externalities, and willingness to pay, may be complicated by the particular problems facing developing countries, such as political issues, lack of infrastructure, or inadequate financing tools, among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inclusive green growth the pathway to sustainable development.|date=May 2012|publisher=World Bank|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-9552-3|pages=12–13|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTSDNET/Resources/Inclusive_Green_Growth_May_2012.pdf|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Five Strengths''' ([[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]]: ''{{IAST|pañcabalāni}}'') in Buddhism are [[Saddha|faith]], [[Viriya|energy]], [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]], [[Samadhi (Buddhism)|concentration]], and [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]].  They are one of the seven sets of "[[Bodhipakkhiyadhamma|qualities conducive to enlightenment]]." They are parallel facets of the five "[[Indriya|spiritual faculties]]."

==Exegesis==
Faith and Wisdom balance each other, as do Energy and Concentration.
The Five Faculties are ‘controlling' faculties because they control or master their opposites.
The faculties and powers are two aspects of the same thing.

#Faith/Conviction ([[Faith in Buddhism|saddhā]] bala) - controls doubt
#Energy/Effort/Persistence ([[Vīrya|viriya]] bala) – controls laziness
#Mindfulness ([[Sati (Buddhism)|sati]] bala) - controls heedlessness
#Concentration ([[Samadhi|samādhi]] bala) - controls distraction
#Wisdom/Discernment ([[Prajñā (Buddhism)|paññā]] bala) – controls ignorance

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7262">In [[Riemannian geometry]], the '''fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry''' states that on any [[Riemannian manifold]] (or [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]) there is a unique [[torsion (differential geometry)|torsion-free]] metric [[affine connection|connection]], called the '''[[Levi-Civita connection]]''' of the given metric. Here a '''metric''' (or '''Riemannian''') connection is a connection which preserves the [[metric tensor]]. More precisely:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Fundamental Theorem of Riemannian Geometry.''' Let (''M'', ''g'') be a [[Riemannian manifold]] (or [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]). Then there is a unique connection ∇ which satisfies the following conditions:
*for any vector fields ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'' we have 
::&lt;math&gt;\partial_X \langle Y,Z \rangle = \langle \nabla_X Y,Z  \rangle + \langle Y,\nabla_X Z \rangle,&lt;/math&gt; 
:where &lt;math&gt; \partial_X \langle Y,Z \rangle &lt;/math&gt; denotes the derivative of the function &lt;math&gt; \langle Y,Z \rangle &lt;/math&gt; along vector field ''X''.
*for any vector fields ''X'', ''Y'', 
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla_XY-\nabla_YX=[X,Y],&lt;/math&gt; 
:where [''X'', ''Y''] denotes the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]] for [[vector field]]s ''X'', ''Y''. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first condition means that the metric tensor is preserved by [[parallel transport]], while the second condition expresses the fact that the [[torsion (differential geometry)|torsion]] of ∇ is zero.

An extension of the fundamental theorem states that given a pseudo-Riemannian manifold there is a unique connection preserving the [[metric tensor]] with any given vector-valued 2-form as its torsion. The difference between an arbitrary connection (with torsion) and the corresponding Levi-Civita connection is the [[contorsion tensor]].

The following technical proof presents a formula for [[Covariant derivative#Coordinate description|Christoffel symbol]]s of the connection in a local coordinate system. For a given metric this set of equations can become rather complicated. There are quicker and simpler methods to obtain the Christoffel symbols for a given metric, e.g. using the [[action (physics)|action]] integral and the associated Euler-Lagrange equations.

==Geodesics defined by a metric or a connection==

A [[metric tensor|metric]] defines the curves which are [[geodesic]]s ; but a [[affine connection|connection]] also defines the geodesics (see also [[Parallel transport#Recovering the connection from the parallel transport parallel|parallel transport]]). A connection &lt;math&gt;\bar{\nabla}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be equal to another &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; in two different ways:&lt;ref&gt;[http://strangebeautiful.com/other-texts/spivak-intro-diff-geom-v2-3ed.pdf   spivak introduction to differential geometry, volume 2, 3rd edition, p.249]&lt;/ref&gt;
*obviously if &lt;math&gt;\bar{\nabla}_X Y = \nabla_X Y&lt;/math&gt; for every vectors fields &lt;math&gt;X,Y&lt;/math&gt;
*if &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{\nabla}&lt;/math&gt; define the same geodesics '''and''' have the same [[Torsion tensor|torsion]]
This means that two different connections can lead to the same geodesics while giving different results for some vector fields.

Because a metric also defines the geodesics of a differential manifold, for some metric there is not only one connection defining the same geodesics &lt;small&gt;(some examples can be found of a connection on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; leading to the straight lines as geodesics but having some torsion in contrary to the trivial connection on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the usual [[directional derivative]])&lt;/small&gt; , and given a metric, the only connection which defines the same geodesics (which leaves the metric unchanged by [[parallel transport]]) '''and''' which is [[torsion tensor|torsion-free]] is the [[Levi-Civita connection]] (which is obtained from the metric by differentiation).

==Proof of the theorem==
Let ''m'' be the dimension of ''M'' and, in some local chart, consider the standard coordinate vector fields

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial}_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}, \qquad i=1,\dots,m. &lt;/math&gt;

Locally, the entry ''g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the metric tensor is then given by

:&lt;math&gt;g_{i j} = \left \langle {\partial}_i, {\partial}_j \right \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

To specify the connection it is enough to specify, for all ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'',

:&lt;math&gt;\left \langle \nabla_{\partial_i}\partial_j, \partial_k \right \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

We also recall that, locally, a [[Covariant derivative#Coordinate description|connection]] is given by ''m''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; smooth functions

:&lt;math&gt;\left \{ \Gamma^l {}_{ij} \right \},&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\partial_i} \partial_j = \sum_l \Gamma^l_{ij} \partial _l.&lt;/math&gt;

The torsion-free property means

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{ \partial _i} \partial _j = \nabla_{\partial_j} \partial_i.&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, compatibility with the Riemannian metric implies that

:&lt;math&gt; \partial_k g_{ij}  =  \left \langle \nabla_{\partial_k}\partial_i, \partial_j \rangle + \langle \partial_i, \nabla_{\partial_k} \partial_j \right \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

For a fixed, ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'', permutation gives 3 equations with 6 unknowns. The torsion free assumption reduces the number of variables to 3. Solving the resulting system of 3 linear equations gives unique solutions

:&lt;math&gt;\left \langle \nabla_{ \partial_i }\partial_j, \partial_k \right \rangle  = \tfrac{1}{2} \left ( \partial_i g_{jk}- \partial_k g_{ij} + \partial_j g_{ik} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

This is the '''first Christoffel identity'''.

Since

:&lt;math&gt;\left \langle \nabla_{ \partial_i }\partial_j, \partial_k \right \rangle = \Gamma^l _{ij} g_{lk},&lt;/math&gt;

where we use Einstein summation convention.  That is, an index repeated [[subscript and superscript]] implies that it is summed over all values. Inverting the metric tensor gives the '''second Christoffel identity''':

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^l_{ij} = \tfrac{1}{2} \left ( \partial_i g_{jk}- \partial_k g_{ij} + \partial_j g_{ik} \right ) g^{kl}.&lt;/math&gt;

Once again, with Einstein summation convention.  The resulting unique connection is called the '''Levi-Civita connection'''.

==The Koszul formula==
An alternative proof of the Fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry proceeds by showing that a torsion-free metric connection on a Riemannian manifold is necessarily given by the '''Koszul formula''':

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{ll}2 g(\nabla_XY, Z) &amp;=\, \partial_X (g(Y,Z)) + \partial_Y (g(X,Z)) - \partial_Z (g(X,Y)) \\&amp;\quad+\, g([X,Y],Z) - g([X,Z],Y) - g([Y,Z],X).\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

This proves the uniqueness of the Levi-Civita connection. Existence is proven by showing that this expression is tensorial in ''X'' and ''Z'', satisfies the Leibniz rule in ''Y'', and that hence defines a connection. This is a metric connection, because the symmetric part of the formula in ''Y'' and ''Z'' is the first term on the first line; it is torsion-free because the anti-symmetric part of the formula in ''X'' and ''Y'' is the first term on the second line.

{{Corporatism sidebar|expanded=Related}}
'''''Gemeinschaft''''' ({{IPA-de|ɡəˈmaɪnʃaft}}) and '''''Gesellschaft''''' ({{IPA-de|ɡəˈzɛlʃaft|}}), generally translated as "[[community]] and [[society]]", are categories which were used by the [[Germany|German]] [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] in order to categorize social ties into two dichotomous sociological types which define each other. [[Max Weber]], who is generally recognized as being a founding figure in sociology, also wrote extensively about the relationship between ''Gemeinschaft'' and ''Gesellschaft''. Weber wrote in direct response to Tönnies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==''Gemeinschaft''–''Gesellschaft'' dichotomy==
The ''Gemeinschaft–Gesellschaft'' [[dichotomy]] was proposed by Tönnies as a purely conceptual tool rather than as an [[ideal type]] in the way it was used by [[Max Weber]] to accentuate the key elements of a historic/social change. According to the dichotomy, social ties can be categorized, on one hand, as belonging to personal [[social interaction]]s, and the roles, values, and beliefs based on such interactions (''[[Gemeinschaft]]'', German, commonly translated as "[[community]]"), or on the other hand as belonging to indirect interactions, impersonal roles, formal values, and beliefs based on such interactions (''[[Gesellschaft]]'', German, commonly translated as "[[society]]").&lt;ref&gt;Tönnies, Ferdinand (1887). ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'', Leipzig: Fues's Verlag.  An English translation of the 8th edition 1935 by Charles P. Loomis appeared in 1940 as ''Fundamental Concepts of Sociology (Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft)'', New York: American Book Co.;  in 1955 as ''Community and Association (Gemeinschaft und gesellschaft''[sic]'')'', London:  Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul;  and in 1957 as ''Community and Society'', East Lansing: Michigan State U.P.  Loomis includes as an Introduction, representing Tönnies' "most recent thinking", his 1931 article "Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft" in ''Handwörterbuch der Soziologie'' (Stuttgart, Enke V.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Tönnies was a [[Thomas Hobbes]] scholar{{mdash}}he edited the standard modern editions of Hobbes's ''The Elements of Law''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobbes|first1=Thomas|editor1-last=Tönnies|editor1-first=Ferdinand|title=The Elements of Law Natural and Politic|date=1889|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Behemoth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobbes|first1=Thomas|editor1-last=Tönnies|editor1-first=Ferdinand|title=Behemoth or the Long Parliament|date=1889|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his study of Hobbes that encouraged Tönnies to devote himself wholly to the [[philosophy of history]] and the [[philosophy of law]]. And it has been argued that he derived both categories from Hobbes's concepts of "concord" and "union".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hont|first1=Istvan|editor1-last=Kapossy|editor1-first=Béla|editor2-last=Sonenscher|editor2-first=Michael|title=Politics in Commercial Society: Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith|date=2015|publisher=Harvard UP|location=Cambridge, MA|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second edition, published in 1912, of the work in which Tönnies further promoted the concepts turned out to be an unexpected but lasting success&lt;ref&gt;Published with a more abstract subtitle ''Basic Terms of Pure Sociology'' (In German: "Grundbegriffe der reinen Soziologie").&lt;/ref&gt; after the first edition was published in 1887 with the subtitle "Treatise on Communism and Socialism as Empirical Patterns of Culture".&lt;ref&gt;In German: ''Abhandlung des Communismus und des Socialismus als empirischer Culturformen''&lt;/ref&gt; Seven more German editions followed, the last in 1935,&lt;ref&gt;  The 1935 edition was reprinted in 2005 by Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt.&lt;/ref&gt; and it became part of the general stock of ideas with which pre-1933 German intellectuals were quite familiar. The book sparked a revival of [[Corporatism|corporatist]] thinking, including the rise of [[neo-medievalism]], the rise of support for [[guild socialism]], and caused major changes in the field of sociology.&lt;ref name="Peter F. Klarén 1986. Pp. 221"&gt;Peter F. Klarén, Thomas J. Bossert. ''Promise of development: theories of change in Latin America''. Boulder, Colorado, USA: Westview Press, 1986. P. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts ''Gemeinschaft'' and ''Gesellschaft'' were also used by Max Weber in ''Economy and Society'', which was first published in 1921.  Weber wrote in direct response to Tönnies,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Weber 1968:4, and 40-43)&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that ''Gemeinschaft'' is rooted in a "subjective feeling" that may be "affectual or traditional". ''Gesellschaft''-based relationships, according to Weber, are rooted in "rational agreement by mutual consent", the best example of which is a commercial contract.  To emphasize the fluidity and amorphousness of the relationship between ''Gemeinschaft'' and ''Gesellschaft'', Weber modified the terms in German to ''Vergemeinschaftung'', and ''Vergesellschaftung'', which are the [[gerund]] forms of the German words.&lt;ref&gt;For more discussion see Waters and Waters 2015:3-6, in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society.  New York: Palsgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt;  Weber's distinction between ''Gemeinschaft'' and ''Gesellschaft'' is highlighted in the essay "Classes, Stände, Parties",&lt;ref&gt;Weber 2015:37-58 in Weber's ''Rationalism and Modern Society'', Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters eds. New York: Palsgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt; which is the basis for Weber's [[three-component theory of stratification]].

Having propounded his conception of the ''Gemeinschaft''–''Gesellschaft'' dichotomy, Tönnies was drawn into a sharp polemic with [[Émile Durkheim]]. In a review of Tönnies' book in 1889, Durkheim interpreted ''Gemeinschaft'' as an organic community, and ''Gesellschaft'' as a mechanical one, reproaching Tönnies for considering the second type of social organisation artificial, and not seeing the transition from the one type to the other. Tönnies did not agree with such an interpretation of his views, and in turn, when reviewing Durkheim's ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' (1896), wrote that Durkheim's whole sociology was a modification and variant of Spencer's, which was also unjust.{{clarify |date=December 2017 |reason= How was Tönnies wrong? }}

==Globalization==

[[Eric Hobsbawm]] argued that, as [[globalization]] turns the entire planet into an increasingly remote kind of ''Gesellschaft'', so too collective [[identity politics]] seeks for a fictitious remaking of the qualities of ''Gemeinschaft'' by artificially reforging group bonds and identities.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm, ''Globalisation, Democracy and Terrorism'' (2007) p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fredric Jameson]] highlights the ambivalent envy felt by those constructed by ''Gesellschaft'' for remaining enclaves of ''Gemeinschaft'', even as they inevitably corrode their existence.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks ed., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outside sociology ==
In [[business]] usage, ''Gesellschaft'' is the German term for "[[company]]", as in ''[[Aktiengesellschaft]]'' or ''[[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung]]'' (''GmbH'').  "Gemeinschaft" is used to identify groups which have or are claimed to have an element of affective loyalty. One important usage is in the German name for the [[European Economic Community]], ''Europäische Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft''.

The German phrase for "mutual insurance company" includes both words, "mutual" and "company." In the 1980's, the Frankenmuth Mutual Insurance Company, headquartered in the German-American city of Frankenmuth, Michigan, released various promotional items such as matchbooks, featuring, in a traditional German Fraktur font, a translation of their company's name, "Frankenmuth Gemeinschafts Versicherinungs Gesellschaft."

==Overview==
Group concept mapping integrates qualitative group processes with [[multivariate analysis]] to help a group organize and visually represent its ideas on any topic of interest through a series of related maps.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; It combines the ideas of diverse participants to show what the group thinks and values in relation to the specific topic of interest. It is a type of structured conceptualization used by groups to develop a conceptual framework, often to help guide evaluation and planning efforts.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; Group concept mapping is participatory in nature, allowing participants to have an equal voice and to contribute through various methods.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; A group concept map visually represents all the ideas of a group and how they relate to each other, and depending on the scale, which ideas are more relevant, important, or feasible.

==Process==

Group concept mapping involves a structured multi-step process, including [[brainstorming]], sorting and rating, [[multidimensional scaling]] and [[cluster analysis]], and the generation and interpretation of multiple maps.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt; The first step requires participants to brainstorm a large set of statements relevant to the topic of interest, usually in response to a focus prompt. Participants are then asked to individually sort those statements into categories based on their perceived similarity and rate each statement on one or more scales, such as importance or feasibility.

The data is then analyzed using The Concept System software, which creates a series of interrelated maps using [[multidimensional scaling]] (MDS) of the sort data, [[hierarchical clustering]] of the MDS coordinates applying [[Ward's method]], and the computation of average ratings for each statement and cluster of statements.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;Rosas SR, Camphausen (2007). The use of concept mapping for scale development and validation in evaluation. Evaluation and Program Planning, 30, 125–135.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting maps display the individual statements in two-dimensional space with more similar statements located closer to each other, and grouped into clusters that partition the space on the map. The Concept System software also creates other maps that show the statements in each cluster rated on one or more scales, and absolute or relative cluster ratings between two cluster sets. As a last step in the process, participants are led through a structured interpretation session to better understand and label all the maps.

==History==
Group concept mapping was developed as a methodology in the late 1980s by William M.K. Trochim at [[Cornell University]]. Trochim is considered to be a leading evaluation expert, and he has taught evaluation and research methods at Cornell since 1980.&lt;ref name="ref4"&gt;Cornell University, College of Human Ecology (2012). William Trochim biographical statement. http://www.human.cornell.edu/bio.cfm?netid=wmt1.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally called "concept mapping", the methodology has evolved since its inception with the maturation of the field and the continued advancement of the software, which is now a Web application.

==Uses==
Group concept mapping can be used with any group for any topic of interest. It is often used by government agencies, academic institutions, national associations, not-for-profit and community-based organizations, and private businesses to help turn the ideas of the group into measurable actions. This includes in the areas of organizational development, strategic planning, needs assessment, curriculum development, research, and evaluation.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; Group concept mapping is well-documented, well-established methodology, and it has been used in hundreds of published papers.

==Versus concept mapping and mind mapping==
{{Main|Concept map|Mind map}}
More generally, concept mapping is any process used for visually representing relationships between ideas in pictures or diagrams.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; A [[concept map]] is typically a diagram of multiple ideas, often represented as boxes or circles, linked in a [[Graph drawing|graph (network) structure]] through arrows and words where each idea is connected to another.&lt;ref name="ref5" /&gt; The technique was originally developed in the 1970s by [[Joseph D. Novak]] at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;Novak JD, Gowin DB (1984). Learning How to Learn. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Concept mapping may be done by an individual or a group.

A [[mind map]] is a diagram used to visually represent information, centering on one word or idea with categories and sub-categories radiating off of it in a [[tree structure]].&lt;ref&gt;Buzan T (2010). The Mind Map Book: Unlock Your Creativity, Boost Your Memory, Change Your Life. Essex: British Broadcasting Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Popularized by [[Tony Buzan]] in the 1970s, mind mapping is often a spontaneous exercise done by an individual or group to gather information about what they think around a single topic.

Unlike Novak's concept maps and Buzan's mind maps, ''group concept mapping'' has a structured mathematical process (sorting and rating, [[multidimensional scaling]] and [[cluster analysis]]) for organizing and visually representing multiple ideas of a group through a series of specific steps.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; In other words, in group concept mapping, the resulting visual representations are mathematically generated from mixed ([[Qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[Quantitative research|quantitative]]) data collected from a group of [[Human subject research|research subject]]s, whereas in Novak's concept maps and Buzan's mind maps the visual representations are drawn directly by the subjects resulting in diagrams that are qualitative data and final product at the same time.

'''Hanlon's razor''' is an [[aphorism]] expressed in various ways, including:

:Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.&lt;ref name="Wigosky-2004"/&gt;
It suggests a way of eliminating unlikely explanations ("[[attribution (psychology)|attribution]]s") for human behavior and its consequences. Statements of this kind are known as [[philosophical razor]]s. It is an [[List of eponymous laws|eponymous law]], probably named after a Robert J. Hanlon.

'''ISO 8601''' ''Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange – Representation of dates and times'' is an [[international standard]] covering the exchange of [[Calendar date|date]]- and [[time]]-related data. It was issued by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and was first published in 1988. The purpose of this standard is to provide an unambiguous and well-defined method of representing dates and times, so as to avoid misinterpretation of numeric representations of dates and times, particularly when data are transferred between [[Date and time notation by country|countries with different conventions]] for writing numeric dates and times.

In general, ISO 8601 applies to representations and formats of dates in the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] (and potentially [[proleptic Gregorian calendar|proleptic Gregorian]]) calendar, of times based on the [[24-hour clock|24-hour timekeeping system]] (with optional [[UTC offset]]), of [[Time interval#Time-like concepts: terminology|time intervals]], and combinations thereof.&lt;ref name=scope&gt;ISO 8601:2004[E] section 1 Scope&lt;/ref&gt; The standard does not assign any specific meaning to elements of the date/time to be represented; the meaning will depend on the context of its use.  In addition, dates and times to be represented cannot include words with no specified numerical meaning in the standard (e.g., names of [[Chinese calendar correspondence table|years in the Chinese calendar]]) or that do not use [[Character (computing)|characters]] (e.g., images, sounds).&lt;ref name=scope /&gt;

In representations for interchange, dates and times are arranged so the largest temporal term (the year) is placed to the left and each successively smaller term is placed to the right of the previous term. Representations must be written in a combination of [[Arabic numerals]] and certain characters (such as "-", ":", "T", "W", and "Z") that are given specific meanings within the standard; the implication is that some commonplace ways of writing parts of dates, such as "January" or "Thursday", are not allowed in interchange representations.

==History==
The first edition of the ISO 8601 standard was published as ''ISO&amp;nbsp;8601:1988'' in 1988. It unified and replaced a number of older ISO standards on various aspects of date and time notation: [[ISO 2014]], [[ISO 2015]], [[ISO 2711]], [[ISO 3307]], and [[ISO 4031]].&lt;ref name=doc2004&gt;{{citation
 |title=ISO 8601:2004(E)
 |date=2004-12-01
 |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]
 |quote=Annex A ... From that concept representations of all other date and time values were logically derived; thus, ISO 2014, ISO 3307 and ISO 4031 have been superseded.... Identification of a particular date by means of ordinal dates (ISO 2711) and by means of the week numbering system (ISO 2015) were alternative methods that the basic concept of this International Standard could also encompass; thus, ISO 2015 and ISO 2711 have now been superseded.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been superseded by a second edition ''ISO&amp;nbsp;8601:2000'' in 2000 and by the current third edition ''ISO&amp;nbsp;8601:2004'' published on 2004-12-01. ISO 8601 was prepared by,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ISO 8601:2004(E)|date=2004-12-01|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]|at=p. iv Foreword}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is under the direct responsibility of, [[List of ISO technical committees|ISO Technical Committee]] TC 154.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=53186&amp;published=on TC 154 Processes, data elements and documents in commerce, industry and administration], Technical committees{{spaced ndash}}ISO&lt;/ref&gt;

ISO 2014, though superseded, is the standard that originally introduced the all-numeric date notation in most-to-least-significant order {{nowrap|[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]}}. The ISO week numbering system was introduced in ISO 2015, and the identification of days by ordinal dates was originally defined in ISO 2711.

{{anchor|EDTF}}ISO 8601 is currently in the process of being updated and split into two parts anticipated to be released in {{Update after|2019|03|reason=working draft's schedule|text=2019-03}}. The draft ISO/DIS 8601-1:2016 represents the slightly updated contents of the current ISO 8601 standard,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171019211402/https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/ISO_DIS%208601-1.pdf ISO/DIS 8601-1:2016-10-26]&lt;!-- Was: https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/ISO_DIS%208601-1.pdf ; dead link as of 2018-08-07 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.din.de/de/mitwirken/normenausschuesse/nia/entwuerfe/wdc-beuth:din21:266843241 German draft ''E DIN ISO 8601-1:2017-02 Datenelemente und Austauschformate - Informationsaustausch - Darstellung von Datum und Uhrzeit - Teil 1: Grundlegende Regeln (ISO/DIS 8601-1:2016)''], DIN-Normenausschuss Informationstechnik und Anwendungen (NIA)&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the draft ISO/DIS 8601-2:2016 defines various extensions such as uncertainties or parts of the Extended Date/Time Format (EDTF).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/iso-tc154-wg5_n0039_iso_wd_8601-2_2016-02-16.pdf ISO/WD 8601-2:2016-02-16]&lt;!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20171019222039/https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/iso-tc154-wg5_n0039_iso_wd_8601-2_2016-02-16.pdf --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/ISO_DIS%208601-2.pdf ISO/DIS 8601-2:2016-10-26]&lt;!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20171020000043/https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/ISO_DIS%208601-2.pdf --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.din.de/de/mitwirken/normenausschuesse/nia/entwuerfe/wdc-beuth:din21:266843381 German draft ''E DIN ISO 8601-2:2017-02 Datenelemente und Austauschformate - Informationsaustausch - Darstellung von Datum und Uhrzeit - Teil 2: Erweiterungen (ISO/DIS 8601-2:2016)''], DIN-Normenausschuss Informationstechnik und Anwendungen (NIA)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/ EDTF]&lt;!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20171020000354/https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/ --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/pre-submission.html Extended Date/Time Format (EDTF) 1.0 2012/2014]&lt;!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20170715194139/http://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/pre-submission.html --&gt; Draft Submission&lt;/ref&gt;

==General principles==
*Date and time values are ordered from the largest to smallest unit of time: year, month (or week), day, hour, minute, second, and fraction of second. The [[lexicographical order]] of the representation thus corresponds to chronological order, except for date representations involving negative years. This allows dates to be naturally [[sorting|sorted]] by, for example, file systems.
*Each date and time value has a fixed number of digits that must be padded with [[leading zero]]s.
*Representations can be done in one of two formats{{spaced ndash}}a basic format with a minimal number of separators or an extended format with separators added to enhance human readability.&lt;ref name=isofaqtnd&gt;ISO, FAQ: ''[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601 Numeric representation of Dates and Time]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime "Date and Time Formats"].&lt;/ref&gt; The standard notes that "The basic format should be avoided in plain text."&lt;ref&gt;ISO 8601:2004 section 2.3.3 basic format&lt;/ref&gt; The separator used between date values (year, month, week, and day) is the [[hyphen]], while the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] is used as the separator between time values (hours, minutes, and seconds).&lt;!--dead link: [http://lists.ebxml.org/archives/ebxml-core/200104/pdf00005.pdf]--&gt; For example, the 6th day of the 1st month of the year 2009 may be written as {{nowrap|"2009-01-06"}} in the extended format or simply as "20090106" in the basic format without ambiguity.
*For reduced accuracy,&lt;ref name=AccuracyVsPrecision&gt;ISO 8601 uses the word ''accuracy'', not ''precision'', in the relevant section, e.g: 2.3.7 representation with reduced accuracy.&lt;/ref&gt; any number of values may be dropped from any of the date and time representations, but in the order from the least to the most significant.  For example, "2004-05" is a valid ISO 8601 date, which indicates May (the fifth month) 2004.  This format will never represent the 5th day of an unspecified month in 2004, nor will it represent a time-span extending from 2004 into 2005.
*If necessary for a particular application, the standard supports the addition of a [[Decimal fractions|decimal fraction]] to the smallest time value in the representation.

The standard uses the [[Gregorian calendar]], which serves as an international standard for civil use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

ISO 8601 fixes a reference calendar date to the Gregorian calendar of 20 May 1875 as the date the {{lang|fr|Convention du Mètre}} ([[Metre Convention]]) was signed in [[Paris]]. However, ISO calendar dates before the Convention are still compatible with the Gregorian calendar all the way back to the official introduction of the Gregorian calendar on {{nowrap|1582-10-15}}. Earlier dates, in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]], may be used by mutual agreement of the partners exchanging information. The standard states that every date must be consecutive, so usage of the [[Julian calendar]] would be contrary to the standard (because at the switchover date, the dates would not be consecutive).

===Years===
{| class="infobox" style="text-align:center; width:23em"
|-
| YYYY
|-
| ±&lt;u&gt;Y&lt;/u&gt;YYYY
|}
ISO 8601 prescribes, as a minimum, a four-digit year [YYYY] to avoid the [[year 2000 problem]]. It therefore represents years from 0000 to 9999, year 0000 being equal to 1 [[Anno Domini|BC]] and all others [[AD]]. However, years prior to [[Gregorian calendar|1583]] are not automatically allowed by the standard. Instead "values in the range [0000] through [1582] shall only be used by mutual agreement of the partners in information interchange."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ISO 8601:2004(E)
|date=2004-12-01
|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]
|at=section 4.1.2.1 General
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To represent years before [[Year zero|0000]] or after [[Year 10,000 problem|9999]], the standard also permits the expansion of the year representation but only by prior agreement between the sender and the receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ISO 8601:2004(E)
|date=2004-12-01
|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]
|quote=3.5 Expansion ... By mutual agreement of the partners in information interchange, it is permitted to expand the component identifying the calendar year, which is otherwise limited to four digits. This enables reference to dates and times in calendar years outside the range supported by complete representations, i.e. before the start of the year [0000] or after the end of the year [9999].}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An expanded year representation [±&lt;u&gt;Y&lt;/u&gt;YYYY] must have an agreed-upon number of extra year digits beyond the four-digit minimum, and it must be prefixed with a + or − sign&lt;ref&gt;ISO 8601:2004 sections 3.4.2, 4.1.2.4&lt;/ref&gt; instead of the more common [[Anno Domini|AD/BC]] (or [[Common Era|CE/BCE]]) notation; by convention 1 BC is labelled [[year zero|+0000]], 2 BC is labeled −0001, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Annex B.1.1 of the standard.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calendar dates===
{| class="infobox" style="text-align:center; width:23em"
| YYYY-MM-DD ||''or''|| YYYYMMDD
|-
| YYYY-MM
| colspan="2"| (''but not'' YYYYMM)
|-
| --MM-DD ||''or''|| --MMDD
|}

Calendar date representations are in the form shown in the adjacent box. [YYYY] indicates a four-digit year, 0000 through 9999. [MM] indicates a two-digit month of the year, 01 through 12. [DD] indicates a two-digit day of that month, 01 through 31.  For example, "5 April 1981" may be represented as either {{nowrap|"1981-04-05"}}&lt;ref name=isofaqtnd/&gt; in the ''extended format'' or "19810405" in the ''basic format''.

The standard also allows for calendar dates to be written with reduced accuracy.&lt;ref name=AccuracyVsPrecision/&gt; For example, one may write {{nowrap|"1981-04"}} to mean "1981 April". The 2000 version allowed writing {{nowrap|"--04-05"}} to mean "April 5"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350#section-4.3.1
 |title=RFC 6350 - vCard Format Specification
 |accessdate=2016-06-29

 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]
 |quote=Truncated representation, as specified in [ISO.8601.2000], Sections 5.2.1.3 d), e), and f), is permitted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the 2004 version does not allow omitting the year when a month is present. One may simply write "1981" to refer to that year or "19" to refer to the [[century]] from 1900 to 1999 inclusive.  Although the standard allows both the YYYY-MM-DD and YYYYMMDD formats for complete calendar date representations, if the day [DD] is omitted then only the {{nowrap|YYYY-MM}} format is allowed. By disallowing dates of the form YYYYMM, the standard avoids confusion with the [[#Truncated representations|truncated representation]] YYMMDD (still often used).

===Week dates===
{{Main article|ISO week date}}
{| class="infobox" style="text-align:center; width:23em"
| YYYY-Www ||''or''|| YYYYWww
|-
| YYYY-Www-D ||''or''|| YYYYWwwD
|}
Week date representations are in the formats as shown in the adjacent box.  [YYYY] indicates the ''ISO week-numbering year'' which is slightly different from the traditional [[Gregorian calendar]] year (see below).  [Www] is the ''[[week number]]'' prefixed by the letter ''W'', from W01 through W53. [D] is the ''weekday number'', from 1 through 7, beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday.

There are several mutually equivalent and compatible descriptions of week 01:
*the week with the year's first Thursday in it (the formal ISO definition),
*the week with 4 January in it,
*the first week with the majority (four or more) of its days in the starting year, and
*the week starting with the Monday in the period 29 December – 4 January.

As a consequence, if 1 January is on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, it is in week 01. If 1 January is on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday, it is in week 52 or 53 of the previous year (there is no week 00). 28 December is always in the last week of its year.

The week number can be described by counting the Thursdays: week 12 contains the 12th Thursday of the year.

The ''ISO week-numbering year'' starts at the first day (Monday) of week 01 and ends at the Sunday before the new ISO year (hence without overlap or gap). It consists of 52 or 53 full weeks. The first ISO week of a year may have up to three days that are actually in the Gregorian calendar year that is ending; if three, they are Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  Similarly, the last ISO week of a year may have up to three days that are actually in the Gregorian calendar year that is starting; if three, they are Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The Thursday of each ISO week is always in the Gregorian calendar year denoted by the ISO week-numbering year.

Examples:
*{{#time: l j F Y |2008-12-29}} is written "{{#time: o-"W"W-N|2008-12-29}}"
*{{#time: l j F Y |2010-01-03}} is written "{{#time: o-"W"W-N|2010-01-03}}"

===Ordinal dates===
{| class="infobox" style="text-align:center; width:23em"
| YYYY-DDD ||''or''|| YYYYDDD
|}

An [[ordinal date]] is a simple form for occasions when the arbitrary nature of week and month definitions are more of an impediment than an aid, for instance, when comparing dates from different calendars.  As represented above, [YYYY] indicates a year. [DDD] is the day of that year, from 001 through 365 (366 in [[leap year]]s). For example, {{nowrap|"1981-04-05"}} is also {{nowrap|"1981-095"}}.

This format is used with simple hardware systems that have a need for a date system, but where including full calendar calculation software may be a significant nuisance.  This system is sometimes referred to as "Julian Date", but this can cause confusion with the astronomical [[Julian day]], a sequential count of the number of days since day 0 beginning {{nowrap|1 January 4713 BC}} Greenwich noon, Julian proleptic calendar (or noon on ISO date {{nowrap|-4713-11-24}} which uses the Gregorian proleptic calendar with a year [0000]).

==Times==
{| class="infobox" style="text-align:center; width:23em"
|hh:mm:ss.sss
|''or''
|hhmmss.sss
|-
| hh:mm:ss ||''or''|| hhmmss
|-
| hh:mm ||''or''|| hhmm
|-
| || hh ||
|}

ISO 8601 uses the [[24-hour clock]] system.  The ''basic format'' is [hh][mm][ss] and the ''extended format'' is [hh]:[mm]:[ss].
*[hh] refers to a zero-padded [[hour]] between 00 and 24 (where 24 is only used to denote midnight at the end of a calendar day).&lt;!--see below--&gt;
*[mm] refers to a zero-padded [[minute]] between 00 and 59.
*[ss] refers to a zero-padded [[second]] between 00 and 60 (where 60 is only used to denote an added [[leap second]]).
So a time might appear as either "134730" in the ''basic format'' or "13:47:30" in the ''extended format''.

Either the seconds, or the minutes and seconds, may be omitted from the basic or extended time formats for greater brevity but decreased accuracy: [hh]:[mm], [hh][mm] and [hh] are the resulting reduced accuracy time formats.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 8601:2004 section 4.2.2.3 Representations with reduced accuracy&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Midnight]]'' is a special case and may be referred to as either "00:00" or "24:00". The notation "00:00" is used at the beginning of a calendar day and is the more frequently used. At the end of a day use "24:00". "2007-04-05T24:00" is the same instant as "2007-04-06T00:00" (see ''[[#Combined date and time representations|Combined date and time representations]]'' below).

Decimal fractions may be added to any of the three time elements. However, a fraction may only be added to the lowest order time element in the representation. A [[decimal mark]], either a [[comma (punctuation)|comma]] or a [[full stop|dot]] (without any preference as stated in resolution 10 of the 22nd General Conference CGPM in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Time zone designators===

[[Time zone]]s in ISO 8601 are represented as local time (with the location unspecified), as [[UTC]], or as an offset from UTC.

If no UTC relation information is given with a time representation, the time is assumed to be in local time. While it ''may'' be safe to assume local time when communicating in the same time zone, it is ambiguous when used in communicating across different time zones. Even within a single geographic time zone, some local times will be ambiguous if the region observes [[daylight saving time]]. It is usually preferable to indicate a time zone (zone designator) using the standard's notation.

====Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)====
If the time is in [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], add a ''Z'' directly after the time without a space. ''Z'' is the zone designator for the zero UTC offset. "09:30 UTC" is therefore represented as "09:30Z" or "0930Z". "14:45:15 UTC" would be "14:45:15Z" or "144515Z".

The ''Z'' suffix in the ISO 8601 time representation is sometimes referred to as "Zulu time" because the same letter is used to designate the [[List of military time zones|Zulu time zone]]. However the ACP 121 standard that defines the list of military time zones makes no mention of UTC and derives the "Zulu time" from the [[Greenwich Mean Time]]&lt;ref name="ACP_121_I"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rnzncomms.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/acp121_i_2010.pdf |title=COMMUNICATION INSTRUCTIONS GENERAL ACP 121(I) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=October 2010 |website= |publisher=[[Combined Communications Electronics Board]] |access-date=2018-01-15 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was formerly used as the international civil time standard. GMT is no longer precisely defined by the scientific community and can refer to either UTC or [[UT1]] depending on context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |ref=harv |title=Time: From Earth Rotation to Atomic Physics |authorlink=Dennis D. McCarthy |last=McCarthy |first=Dennis D. |last2=Seidelmann |first2=Kenneth P. |isbn=978-3-527-40780-4 |publisher=[[Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA]] |location=Weinheim |year=2009 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Time offsets from UTC====
The [[UTC offset|offset from UTC]] is appended to the time in the same way that 'Z' was above, in the form ±[hh]:[mm], ±[hh][mm], or ±[hh].  So if the time being described is one hour ahead of UTC (such as the time in [[Berlin]] during the winter), the zone designator would be "+01:00", "+0100", or simply "+01". To represent a time behind UTC the offset is negative. For example, the time in [[New York City|New York]] during standard (not daylight saving) hours is [[UTC−05:00]] and the zone designator would then be "&amp;minus;05:00", "&amp;minus;0500", or simply "&amp;minus;05". For other time offsets see [[List of UTC time offsets]]. To represent a negative offset, ISO 8601 specifies using either a hyphen&amp;ndash;minus or a [[minus sign]] character. If the interchange character set is limited and does not have a minus sign character, then the hyphen&amp;ndash;minus should be used.  [[ASCII]] does not have a minus sign, so its hyphen&amp;ndash;minus character (code is 45 decimal or 2D hexadecimal) would be used. If the character set has a minus sign, then that character should be used. [[Unicode]] has a minus sign, and its character code is U+2212 (2212 hexadecimal); the [[HTML entity|HTML character entity]] invocation is &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;minus;&lt;/code&gt;.

The following times all refer to the same moment: "18:30Z", "22:30+04", "1130&amp;minus;0700", and "15:00&amp;minus;03:30". [[Nautical time]] zone letters are not used with the exception of Z. To calculate UTC time one has to subtract the offset from the local time, e.g. for "15:00&amp;minus;03:30" do 15:00 &amp;minus; (&amp;minus;03:30) to get 18:30 UTC.

An offset of zero, in addition to having the special representation "Z", can also be stated numerically as "+00:00", "+0000", or "+00".  However, it is not permitted to state it numerically with a negative sign, as "&amp;minus;00:00", "&amp;minus;0000", or "&amp;minus;00".  The section dictating sign usage (section 3.4.2 in the 2004 edition of the standard) states that a plus sign must be used for a positive or zero value, and a minus sign for a negative value.  Contrary to this rule, RFC 3339, which is otherwise a profile of ISO 8601, permits the use of "-00", with the same denotation as "+00" but a differing connotation.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 3339{{spaced ndash}}Unknown local offset convention&lt;/ref&gt;

ISO 8601 permits the hyphen (-) to be used as the minus (&amp;minus;) character when the character set is limited.&lt;ref&gt;ISO 8601 &amp;sect;3.4.1 stating, "In an environment where use is made of a character repertoire based on ISO/IEC 646, 'hyphen' and 'minus' are both mapped onto 'hyphen-minus'. Representations with a 'plus-minus' shall only be used in such environment if the interchange repertoire includes 'plus-minus'."&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, RFC 3339 explicitly requires the hyphen (-) symbol to represent negative offsets and does not allow for use of the minus (&amp;minus;) symbol.&lt;ref&gt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6 time-numoffset defined with hyphen symbol&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combined date and time representations==
{| class="infobox" style="text-align:center; width:23em"
|-
| &amp;lt;date&amp;gt;T&amp;lt;time&amp;gt;
|}

A single point in time can be represented by concatenating a complete date expression, the letter ''T'' as a delimiter, and a valid time expression. For example, {{nowrap|"2007-04-05T14:30"}}.

If a time zone designator is required, it follows the combined date and time. For example,  "2007-04-05T14:30Z" or "2007-04-05T12:30-02:00".

Either basic or extended formats may be used, but both date and time must use the same format. The date expression may be calendar, week, or ordinal, and must use a complete representation. The time may be represented using a specified reduced accuracy format.&lt;ref name=AccuracyVsPrecision/&gt;  It is permitted to omit the 'T' character by mutual agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document
|title=ISO 8601:2004(E)
|date=2004-12-01
|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]
|quote=4.3.2 NOTE: By mutual agreement of the partners in information interchange, the character [T] may be omitted in applications where there is no risk of confusing a date and time of day representation with others defined in this International Standard.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Durations==
{| class="infobox" style="text-align:center; width:23em"
|-
| PnYnMnDTnHnMnS
|-
| PnW
|-
| P&amp;lt;date&amp;gt;T&amp;lt;time&amp;gt;
|}
Durations define the amount of intervening time in a time interval and are represented by the format P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S or P[n]W as shown to the right.  In these representations, the [n] is replaced by the value for each of the date and time elements that follow the [n].  Leading zeros are not required, but the maximum number of digits for each element should be agreed to by the communicating parties.  The capital letters ''P'', ''Y'', ''M'', ''W'', ''D'', ''T'', ''H'', ''M'', and ''S'' are designators for each of the date and time elements and are not replaced.

*''P'' is the duration designator (for ''period'') placed at the start of the duration representation.
*''Y'' is the year designator that follows the value for the number of years.
*''M'' is the month designator that follows the value for the number of months.
*''W'' is the week designator that follows the value for the number of weeks.
*''D'' is the day designator that follows the value for the number of days.
*''T'' is the time designator that precedes the time components of the representation.
**''H'' is the hour designator that follows the value for the number of hours.
**''M'' is the minute designator that follows the value for the number of minutes.
**''S'' is the second designator that follows the value for the number of seconds.

For example, "P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S" represents a duration of "three years, six months, four days, twelve hours, thirty minutes, and five seconds".

Date and time elements including their designator may be omitted if their value is zero, and lower order elements may also be omitted for reduced precision. For example, "P23DT23H" and "P4Y" are both acceptable duration representations. However, at least one element must be present, thus "P" is not a valid representation for a duration of 0 seconds. "PT0S" or "P0D", however, are both valid and represent the same duration. 

To resolve ambiguity, "P1M" is a one-month duration and "PT1M" is a one-minute duration (note the time designator, T, that precedes the time value). The smallest value used may also have a decimal fraction, as in "P0.5Y" to indicate half a year. This decimal fraction may be specified with either a [[comma]] or a [[full stop]], as in "P0,5Y" or "P0.5Y".  The standard does not prohibit date and time values in a duration representation from exceeding their "carry over points" except as noted below.  Thus, "PT36H" could be used as well as "P1DT12H" for representing the same duration. But keep in mind that "PT36H" is not the same as "P1DT12H" when switching from or to [[Daylight saving time]].

Alternatively, a format for duration based on combined date and time representations may be used by agreement between the communicating parties either in the basic format PYYYYMMDDThhmmss or in the extended format {{nowrap|P[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]T[hh]:[mm]:[ss]}}.  For example, the first duration shown above would be {{nowrap|"P0003-06-04T12:30:05"}}.  However, individual date and time values cannot exceed their [[modular arithmetic|moduli]] (e.g. a value of 13 for the month or 25 for the hour would not be permissible).&lt;ref&gt;ISO 8601:2004 section 4.4.3.3 Alternative format&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the standard describes durations as part of time intervals, which are discussed in the next section, the duration format is widely used independent of time intervals, as with the Java 8 Duration class&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Java 8 Class Duration|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence-|website=Java Platform Standard Edition 8|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amazon Alexa Duration|url=https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/slot-type-reference.html#duration|website=Amazon Developer|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Time intervals==
{| class="infobox" style="text-align:center; width:23em"
|-
| &lt;start&gt;/&lt;end&gt;
|-
| &lt;start&gt;/&lt;duration&gt;
|-
| &lt;duration&gt;/&lt;end&gt;
|-
| &lt;duration&gt;
|}
A time interval is the intervening time between two time points. The amount of intervening time is expressed by a duration (as described in the previous section).  The two time points (start and end) are expressed by either a combined date and time representation or just a date representation.

There are four ways to express a time interval:

#Start and end, such as "2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z"
#Start and duration, such as "2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/P1Y2M10DT2H30M"
#Duration and end, such as "P1Y2M10DT2H30M/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z"
#Duration only, such as "P1Y2M10DT2H30M", with additional context information

Of these, the first three require two values separated by an ''interval designator'' which is usually a solidus (more commonly referred to as a [[slash (punctuation)|forward slash]] "/"). Section 4.4.2 of the standard notes that: "In certain application areas a double hyphen is used as a separator instead of a solidus." The standard does not define the term "double hyphen", but previous versions used notations like "2000--2002".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/iso8601.html |title=Info on ISO 8601, the date and time representation standard |publisher=Cs.tut.fi |date= |accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of a double hyphen instead of a solidus allows inclusion in computer [[filename]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hydrogold.com.au/news_2012.html#iso8601 |title=ISO 8601 - Getting with the Times (and Dates) |date=2012-01-01| publisher=Hydrogold |accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A solidus is a [[Filename#Reserved characters and words|reserved character]] and not allowed in a filename in common operating systems.

For &lt;start&gt;/&lt;end&gt; expressions, if any elements are missing from the end value, they are assumed to be the same as for the start value including the time zone. This feature of the standard allows for concise representations of time intervals.  For example, the date of a two-hour meeting including the start and finish times could be simply shown as "2007-12-14T13:30/15:30", where "/15:30" implies "/2007-12-14T15:30" (the same date as the start), or the beginning and end dates of a monthly billing period as "2008-02-15/03-14", where "/03-14" implies "/2008-03-14" (the same year as the start).

If greater precision is desirable to represent the time interval, then more time elements can be added to the representation. An interval denoted {{nowrap|"2007-11-13/15"}} can start at any time on {{nowrap|2007-11-13}} and end at any time on {{nowrap|2007-11-15}}, whereas {{nowrap|"2007-11-13T09:00/15T17:00"}} includes the start and end times.
To explicitly include all of the start and end dates, the interval would be represented as {{nowrap|"2007-11-13T00:00/15T24:00"}}.

===Repeating intervals===
{| class="infobox" style="text-align:center; width:23em"
|-
| Rnn/&lt;interval&gt;
|-
| R/&lt;interval&gt;
|}
Repeating intervals are specified in clause "4.5 Recurring time interval". They are formed by adding "R[n]/" to the beginning of an interval expression, where ''R'' is used as the letter itself and [n] is replaced by the number of repetitions. Leaving out the value for [n] means an unbounded number of repetitions. If the interval specifies the start (forms 1 and 2 above), then this is the start of the repeating interval. If the interval specifies the end but not the start (form 3 above), then this is the end of the repeating interval. For example, to repeat the interval of "P1Y2M10DT2H30M" five times starting at {{nowrap|"2008-03-01T13:00:00Z"}}, use {{nowrap|"R5/2008-03-01T13:00:00Z/P1Y2M10DT2H30M"}}.

==Truncated representations==
ISO 8601:2000 allowed truncation (by agreement), where leading components of a date or time are omitted. Notably, this allowed two-digit years to be used and the ambiguous formats YY-MM-DD and YYMMDD. This provision was removed in ISO 8601:2004.

==Usage==
On the [[Internet]], the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) uses ISO 8601 in defining a profile of the standard that restricts the supported date and time formats to reduce the chance of error and the complexity of software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime Note about Date and Time Formats to W3C from Reuters]&lt;!--should be XML Schema--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

RFC 3339 defines a profile of ISO 8601 for use in [[Internet protocol suite|Internet protocols]] and [[Internet standard|standards]]. It explicitly excludes durations and dates before the [[common era]]. The more complex formats such as week numbers and ordinal days are not permitted.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 3339, section 5.6&lt;/ref&gt;

RFC 3339 deviates from ISO 8601 in allowing a zero time zone offset to be specified as "-00:00", which ISO 8601 forbids.  RFC 3339 intends "-00:00" to carry the connotation that it is not stating a preferred time zone, whereas the conforming "+00:00" or any non-zero offset connotes that the offset being used is preferred.  This convention regarding "-00:00" is derived from earlier RFCs, such as [[RFC 2822]] which uses it for timestamps in [[email]] headers.  RFC 2822 made no claim that any part of its timestamp format conforms to ISO 8601, and so was free to use this convention without conflict.

ISO 8601 is referenced by several specifications, but the full range of options of ISO 8601 is not always used. For example, the various [[electronic program guide]] standards for TV, digital radio, etc. use several forms to describe points in time and durations. The [[ID3]] audio meta-data specification also makes use of a subset of ISO 8601.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.id3.org/id3v2.4.0-structure|title=ID3 tag version 2.4.0 - Main Structure|last=Nilsson|first=M.|date=2000-11-01|publisher=id3.org|pages=§4|accessdate=2009-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[X.690]] encoding standard's [[GeneralizedTime]] makes use of another subset of ISO 8601.

The [[ISO 8601 week date]], as of 2006, appeared in its basic form on major brand commercial packaging in the United States. Its appearance depended on the particular packaging, canning, or bottling plant more than any particular brand. The format is particularly useful for quality assurance, so that production errors can be readily traced to work weeks, and products can be correctly targeted for recall.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7113">In [[mathematics]], an '''indexed family''' is informally a collection of objects, each associated with an index from some index set. For example, a ''family of [[real number]]s, indexed by the set of [[integer]]s'' is a collection of real numbers, where a given function selects for each integer one real number (possibly the same).

More formally, an indexed family is a  [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] together with its [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] ''I'' and [[Image (mathematics)|image]] ''X''. Often the [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] of the set ''X'' are referred to as making up the family. In this view indexed families are interpreted as collections instead of as functions. The set ''I'' is called the ''index (set)'' of the family, and ''X'' is the ''indexed set''.

==Mathematical statement==

'''Definition.''' Let ''I'' and ''X'' be sets and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; a [[surjective function]], such that
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 x\colon I &amp;\to X \\
 i &amp;\mapsto x_i = x(i),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
then this establishes a '''family of elements in ''X'' indexed by ''I'' ''', which is denoted by (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; or simply (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;), when the index set is assumed to be known. Sometimes angle brackets or braces are used instead of parentheses, the latter with the risk of mixing-up families with sets.

An indexed family can be turned into a set by considering the set &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{X} = \{ x_i : i \in I \} &lt;/math&gt;, that is, the image of ''I'' under ''x''. Since the mapping x is not required to be [[Injective function|injective]], there may exist &lt;math&gt;i,j \in I &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;i \neq j&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_i = x_j&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;| \mathcal{X}| \leq |I|,&lt;/math&gt; where |''A''| denotes the cardinality of the set ''A''.

The index set is not restricted to be countable, and, of course, a subset of a powerset may be indexed, resulting in an '''indexed family of sets'''. For the important differences in sets and families see below.

==Examples==

===Index notation===
Whenever [[index notation]] is used the indexed objects form a family. For example, consider the following sentence.
*The vectors ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are linearly independent. 
Here (''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i'' ∈ {1, …, ''n''}&lt;/sub&gt; denotes a family of vectors. The ''i''-th vector ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; only makes sense with respect to this family, as sets are unordered and there is no ''i''-th vector of a set. Furthermore, [[linear independence]] is only defined as the property of a collection; it therefore is important if those vectors are linearly independent as a set or as a family. 

If we consider ''n''&amp;nbsp;= 2 and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= (1, 0), the ''set'' of them consists of only one element and is linearly independent, but the family contains the same element twice and is linearly dependent.

===Matrices===
Suppose a text states the following:
*A square matrix ''A'' is invertible, [[if and only if]] the rows of ''A'' are linearly independent. 

As in the previous example it is important that the rows of ''A'' are linearly independent as a family, not as a set. For Example, consider the matrix
:&lt;math&gt; A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} . &lt;/math&gt;
The ''set'' of rows only consists of a single element (1, 1) and is linearly independent, but the matrix is not invertible. The ''family'' of rows contains two elements and is linearly dependent. The statement is therefore correct if it refers to the family of rows, but wrong if it refers to the set of rows. (The statement is also correct when "the rows" is interpreted as referring to a [[multiset]], in which the elements are also kept distinct but which lacks some of the structure of an indexed family.)

== Functions, sets and families ==
[[Surjective]] [[function (mathematics)|functions]] and families are formally equivalent, as any function ''f'' with [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] ''I'' induces a family (''f''(''i''))&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;.  In practice, however, a family is viewed as a collection, not as a function: being ''an element of a family'' is equivalent with being in the range of the corresponding function. A family contains any element exactly once, [[if and only if]] the corresponding function is [[injective]]. 

Like a [[Set (mathematics)|set]], a family is a container and any set ''X'' gives rise to a family (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''x''∈''X''&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus any set naturally becomes a family. For any family (''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; there is the set of all elements {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; | ''i''∈''I''}, but this does not carry any information on multiple containment or the structure given by ''I''.  Hence, by using a set instead of the family, some information might be lost.

== Examples ==
Let '''n''' be the finite set {1, 2, …, ''n''}, where ''n'' is a positive [[integer]].
* An [[ordered pair]] is a family indexed by the two element set '''2'''&amp;nbsp;= {1, 2}.
* An [[tuple|''n-''tuple]] is a family indexed by '''n'''.
* An infinite [[sequence]] is a family indexed by the [[natural numbers]].
* A [[tuple|list]] is an ''n-''tuple for an unspecified ''n'', or an infinite sequence.
* An ''n''×''m'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] is a family indexed by the [[cartesian product]] '''n'''&amp;times;'''m'''.
* A [[net (mathematics)|net]] is a family indexed by a [[directed set]].

==Operations on families==

Index sets are often used in sums and other similar operations. For example, if (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; is a family of numbers, the sum of all those numbers is denoted by

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i\in I}a_i. &lt;/math&gt;

When (''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[family of sets]], the [[union (set theory)|union]] of all those sets is denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i\in I}A_i. &lt;/math&gt;

Likewise for [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]s and [[cartesian product]]s.

==Subfamily==

A family (''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''J''&lt;/sub&gt; is a '''subfamily''' of a family (''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;, [[if and only if]] ''J'' is a subset of ''I'' and for all ''i'' in ''J'' 
:''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;

==Usage in category theory==
{{main|Diagram (category theory)}}

The analogous concept in [[category theory]] is called a '''[[diagram (category theory)|diagram]]'''. A diagram is a [[functor]] giving rise to an indexed family of objects in a [[category theory|category]] '''''C''''', indexed by another category '''''J''''', and related by [[morphism]]s depending on two indices.

'''International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers''' is observed annually on December 17 by [[sex worker]]s, their advocates, friends, families and allies. Originally conceived as a [[memorial]] and [[vigil]] for the victims of the [[Green River Killer]] in [[Seattle]] [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], United States (US), it has evolved into an annual international event. The day calls attention to [[hate crimes]] committed against sex workers worldwide, as well as the need to remove the [[social stigma]] and [[discrimination]] that have contributed to violence against sex workers and indifference from the communities they are part of. Sex worker activists also state that custom and prohibitionist laws perpetuate such violence.

==Background==
First observed in 2003,&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;{{cite web|title=Candlelight Vigil Calls for an End to Violence Against Sex Workers International Memorial Day Focuses Attention on Violence Against Sex Workers|url=http://www.sexworkersproject.org/releases/PressRelease20031210.html|work=Urban Justice Center|publisher=Sex Workers Project|accessdate=16 December 2013|author=Susan Blake|format=PDF|date=17 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; the International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers was founded by [[Annie Sprinkle|Dr. Annie Sprinkle]] and the [[Sex Workers Outreach Project USA|Sex Workers Outreach Project USA (SWOP-USA)]],&lt;ref name="Press" /&gt; an American [[sex worker rights]] organization. In a public letter, Sprinkle states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Violent crimes against sex workers go underreported, unaddressed and unpunished. There really are people who don't care when prostitutes are victims of hate crimes, beaten, raped, and murdered. No matter what you think about sex workers and the politics surrounding them, sex workers are a part of our neighborhoods, communities and families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A public letter from Annie Sprinkle|url=http://www.december17.org/about/from-annie-sprinkle/|work=December17.org|publisher=December17.org|accessdate=16 December 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Dec17 RedUmbrella.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Logo of the International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers]]

==Red umbrella symbol==
The red umbrella is an important symbol for sex worker rights and is used for events that are held on December 17. The red umbrella symbol was first used by sex workers in [[Venice]], Italy in 2001. Slovenian artist Tadej Pogacar collaborated with sex workers to create the "Prostitute Pavilion" and  CODE: RED art installation for the 49th [[Venice Biennale]] of Art. Sex workers also held a street demonstration, the Red Umbrellas March, to protest inhumane work conditions and human rights abuses.&lt;ref name="Red"&gt;{{cite web|title=Under the Red Umbrella|url=http://www.sexworkeurope.org/campaigns/red-umbrella-campaigns|work=Intl. Committee on the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe (ICRSE)|publisher=Intl. Committee on the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe (ICRSE)|accessdate=22 December 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Committee on the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe (ICRSE) adopted the red umbrella as a symbol of resistance to discrimination in 2005. A corresponding march was organised as the closing event to the European Conference on Sex Work, Human Rights, Labour and Migration conference, held in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], at which almost 200 participants appeared.&lt;ref name="Red" /&gt;

The '''International Fellowship of Reconciliation''' ('''IFOR''') is a non-governmental organization founded in 1914 in response to the horrors of war in Europe. Today IFOR counts 72 branches, groups and affiliates in 48 countries on all continents. IFOR members promote [[nonviolence]], [[human rights]] and [[reconciliation (ethnic relations)|reconciliation]] through public education efforts, training programs and campaigns. The IFOR International Secretariat in [[Alkmaar]], [[Netherlands]] facilitates communication among IFOR members, links branches to capacity building resources, provides training in gender-sensitive [[nonviolence]] through the  Women Peacemakers Program, and helps coordinate international campaigns, delegations and urgent actions. IFOR has [[ECOSOC]] status at the [[United nations|United Nations]].

==History==

===Origins in wartime===
The first body to use the name "[[Fellowship of Reconciliation]]" was formed as a result of a pact made in August 1914 at the outbreak of the [[First World War]] by two [[Christian]]s, [[Henry Hodgkin]] (an English [[Quaker]]) and [[Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze]] (a German [[Lutheran]]), who were participating in a [[Christian pacifism|Christian pacifist]] conference in [[Konstanz]], southern Germany (near Switzerland).  On the platform of the railway station at [[Cologne]], they pledged to each other that, "We are one in Christ and can never be at war".&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Brock (historian)|Peter Brock]] and Nigel Young,
''Pacifism in the Twentieth Century''. Syracuse University Press, New York, 1999 {{ISBN|0-8156-8125-9}}
(p. 24).&lt;/ref&gt;

To take that pledge forward, Hodgkin organised a conference in [[Cambridge]] in 1915 and founded the "Fellowship of Reconciliation" (FOR England).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.for.org.uk|title=Home - Fellowship of Reconciliation|date=16 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German branch, Versöhnungsbund,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.versoehnungsbund.de/en|title=International Fellowship of Reconciliation - German Branch - Internationaler Versöhnungsbund|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded later. It held its first conference in 1932, but in 1933, when Hitler came to power, it dissolved. Schultze was arrested twenty-seven times during World War I and was forced to live in exile during the Nazi period. FOR Germany was officially reestablished just in 1956 with Dr Siegmund Schultze as President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forusa.org/content/rebel-passion-eighty-five-years-fellowship-reconciliation|title=The Rebel Passion: Eighty-Five Years of the Fellowship of Reconciliation - Fellowship of Reconciliation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Shortly after the Cambridge conference, in the autumn of 1915, Henry Hodgkin went over to America and, the 11th and 12 November, the  American Fellowship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forusa.org|title=Fellowship of Reconciliation - Working for peace, justice and nonviolence since 1915|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded during a Conference at Garden City, Long Island. More than a thousand members enrolled in the American Fellowship before and during the war, which, for the U.S.A., begun on April 6, 1917.
Because of the war, it was not possible to travel to other countries and the Fellowship of Reconciliation focused its activities on trying to influence public opinion, to help victims of war and war prisoners. 600 people in England went to prison for helping more than 16.000 imprisoned during the war.  When conscription began in Britain in 1916 and in the United States many FOR members refused military service.&lt;ref&gt;Vera Brittain, "The Rebel Passion: a History of Some Pioneer Peace-Makers", George Allen and Unwin ltd, London, 1964, p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

===After World War one: strengthening the international movement===
[[File:1919-IFOR-c.png|thumb|First international gathering of International Fellowship of Reconciliation at [[Bilthoven]], Netherlands, in 1919.]]

After the end of the war, in 1919, the different Fellowships of Reconciliation raised in those years all around Europe and in the USA agreed to found the International Fellowship of Reconciliation as an umbrella organisation to which they affiliated as members.  In October 1919 Christian pacifists from 10 different countries met in the Netherlands, in the town of Bilthoven, to establish the "Movement Towards a Christian International" later called "International Fellowship of Reconciliation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = John | last = Ferguson | title = The Fellowship of Reconciliation |series=History| publisher = IFOR | journal = The Cambridge Review |date=December 1984 | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.ifor.org/articles/IFOR_history_by_J._Ferguson_1984_-_REVISED.pdf |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061004074828/http://www.ifor.org/articles/IFOR_history_by_J._Ferguson_1984_-_REVISED.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  IFOR first secretary was the Swiss pacifist [[Pierre Cérésole]] jailed several times for his peace witness. He established the [[International Voluntary Service for Peace#From reconciliation to emergency aid .281920.29|Service Civil]] (International Voluntary Service for Peace), initially organizing work camps in areas torn apart by war, with volunteers from former enemy countries. Relief for the victims of war was carried out, and international conferences and meetings spread the work of peace to many other parts of the globe.  Immediately after Bilthoven IFOR appointed travelling secretaries such as [[John Nevin Sayre]], [[André and Magda Trocmé|André Trocmé]], [[Muriel Lester]], Henri Rose and Percy Bartlett.  They travelled carrying the Fellowship's messages around Europe, in Scandinavia, Central Europe, Poland, the Baltic States and the Balkans, giving life to several international conferences that took place between the two world wars.  The first one gathered 200 delegates from 20 nations (also India, Burma and Ukraine) in Sonntagberg in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Vera | last = Brittain | title = The Rebel Passion: A Short History of Some Pioneer Peace-Makers | publisher = George-Allen &amp; Unwin | place = London | year = 1964 | page = 48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many others followed and, in such a tense historical moment, IFOR members discussed about the necessity of disarmament and of a new role of Churches, asking clergymen to make a strong stand against the idea of "righteous wars".  In 1932, the IFOR led a Youth Crusade across Europe in support of the Geneva World Disarmament Conference.  Protestants and Catholics from all over converged on Geneva by various routes, reaching over 50,000 people and presenting to the Conference a petition calling for total disarmament among the nations.

===Ambassadors of Reconciliation===
At the end of the 1930s, given the unstable international situation, IFOR established Embassies of Reconciliation that initiated peace efforts not only in Europe but in Japan and China as well.  "Ambassadors of Reconciliation", such as George Lansbury, [[Muriel Lester]] and Anne Seesholtz, visited many world leaders, including [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Leon Blum]] and [[Franklin D Roosevelt]].  Muriel Lester, English social worker, served as IFOR travelling secretary throughout the world, helping to establish its work in many countries. She met [[Mahatma Gandhi]], first in London when, in 1931, he spent some time at [[Kingsley Hall]], a community center with educational, social and recreational purposes, run by her and her sister Doris, and then in India when she went with him in Bihar on his anti-untouchability tour during 1934.  When [[World War II]] broke out, travels and communications became almost impossible. In many countries IFOR members suffered persecution for publicly preaching pacifism. IFOR's members, especially in America tried by inter-church mediation to find ways of ending the war, to help coscientious objectors, and struggled against internment of Japanese Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Vera | last = Brittain | title = The Rebel Passion: A Short History of Some Pioneer Peace-Makers | publisher = George-Allen &amp; Unwin | place = London | year = 1964 | page = 59}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In France, IFOR members [[André and Magda Trocmé]], with the help of the villagers of le [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon|Chambon sur Lignon]], saved the lives of thousands of Jews escaping the Holocaust. In Belgium, feminist Magda Yoors Peeters defends Jewish refugees and conscientious objectors.

===Supporting nonviolent movements around the world===
After the war, travelling secretaries continued their work. IFOR branches and affiliates in Latin America, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East grew consistently also thanks to the work of [[Jean Goss]] and [[Hildegard Goss-Mayr]] from Paris and Vienna, three times nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref name="pb"&gt;{{citation |authorlink1=Peter Brock (historian) |first1=Peter |last1=Brock |first2=Nigel |last2=Young |title=Pacifism in the Twentieth Century |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=New York |year=1999 |isbn=0-8156-8125-9 |pages=376–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand pacifist [[Ormond Burton]] represented the IFOR in that nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=John |last=Button |title=The Radicalism Handbook: Radical Activists, Groups and Movements of the Twentieth Century |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=1995 |isbn=0-87436-838-3 |page=119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From such labors arose Servicio Paz y Justicia (SERPAJ)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serpajamericalatina.org/|title=Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout Latin America. SERPAJ's founder [[Adolfo Pérez Esquivel|Adolfo Perez Esquivel]] from Argentina was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1980.&lt;ref name="pb" /&gt; SERPAJ participated in the nonviolent resistance to Chile's 16-year-long military dictatorship, which culminates in free elections that restored democracy. Hildegard Goss-Mayrs' training in active nonviolence contributed significantly to the people power overthrow of the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] dictatorship in the [[Philippines]] in 1986, as well as the growth of nonviolent movements in Asia and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Richard | last = Deats | title = Marked for Life: The Story of Hildegard Goss-Mayr | publisher = New City Press | place = Hyde park, NY | year = 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Goss-Mayrs, IFOR Honorary Presidents, were central to the global spread of active nonviolence movement.

==IFOR members==
IFOR has 72 members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.it/maps/ms?msid=214698436680848045660.0004c04fff384994c2417&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=13.55691,8.778076&amp;spn=139.474293,226.054688|title=International Fellowship of Reconciliation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 48 countries in all continents.

==How IFOR works==

===Decade for a Culture of Nonviolence===
Since the initiation of the United Nations Decade for a Culture of Peace and Nonviolence for the Children of the World, in 2001, IFOR members have been active in working for peace education and in working to establish national coalitions to support the Decade.

===Nonviolence education and training===
IFOR assists groups and individuals to find ways in which they can transform conflicts into positive and growth oriented interactions that involve dialogue and lead to reconciliation. The  Nonviolent Education Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nv-e.org/|title=*NVE - Non Violent Education*|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims at supporting sustainable implementation of nonviolence/nonviolent education, peace education and violence prevention in compulsory kindergarten and school education and thus consequent implementation of Children’s Rights expressed in the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].  This is done through various presentations and training programs, as well as through the creation of resource materials and contact with trainers and resource people.

===Youth empowerment===
Thanks to the Youth Working Group, IFOR provides young people with the skills and opportunities to become active peacemakers. This is done through nonviolence and leadership training, campaigning, and through internships with IFOR branches and groups, or with the International Secretariat.

===Interfaith cooperation===
Religion has on occasion played a central role in fomenting conflict but can also be a source of inspiration and leadership for peace. IFOR sponsors interfaith delegations to areas of conflict and publishes material on nonviolence from different religious traditions.

===Disarmament===
Since our founding, IFOR has opposed war and preparations for war. IFOR members support conscientious objectors, campaign for a ban on land mines, and oppose nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction. During their annual meeting, European members from different branches of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation issued the Declaration of Prali,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifor-mir.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Read-the-Declaration-of-Prali-on-Military-Spending.pdf|title=Read the Declaration of Prali on Military Spending|format=PDF|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in occasion of the Global day of Action on Military Spending,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demilitarize.org/|title=Global Campaign on Military Spending - Cut Military Spending - Fund Human Needs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 17 April 2012.  The Peace and Constitution Committee Working Group promotes actions to raise awareness on the [[article 9 of the Japanese Constitution]] which denounces war and war-preparation activities.

===Gender justice===
In 2006 IFOR adopted a Gender Policy in which IFOR recognizes that there is a continuum of violence against women that must be confronted, from family violence in the private sphere to armed conflict in the public sphere. Unequal power relations between women and men are one root of violence, conflict and militarization, where women are often severely abused. Gender justice means that women and men can equally contribute to and benefit from peace building, non-violent conflict resolution and reconciliation.  This gender policy recognizes that gender equality is an integral part of IFOR’s fundamental values and is a core spiritual value. A transformation of the power relations between women and men is a prerequisite for a culture of peace and non-violence, and must be promoted throughout IFOR.  The Women Peacemaker Program (WPP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifor.org/WPP/|title=About IFOR|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an IFOR program that works to ensure the possibility for women's access to peace negotiations and promotes the application of IFOR’s Gender Policy. 

The successful program has been institutionalized by the end of 2012.

==International representation==
IFOR maintains permanent representatives at the United Nations (UN) in New York, Geneva, Vienna and Paris (UNESCO) who regularly participate in conferences and meetings of UN bodies, providing testimony and expertise from different regional perspectives, promoting non-violent alternatives in the fields of human rights, development, and disarmament. 
IFOR has observer and consultative status to the United Nations, United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and UNESCO organizations.

==Life and career==
Lewin grew up in [[Maui]] and obtained her [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Architecture and [[Computer Aided Design]] from the [[University of Colorado Boulder]], later obtaining her [[Master of Professional Studies|M.P.S.]] degree in Interactive Design from [[Tisch School of the Arts]].&lt;ref name="CBS Denver" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Time /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Sabah" /&gt;

Her most known work, ''The Pool'', featured on ''[[Wired magazine|Wired]]'',&lt;ref name="Wired feature"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Senese|first1=Mike|title=SXSW’s Maker Takeover Flashes, Then Fizzles|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/03/sxsws-maker-takeover/|website=Wired|publisher=Wired|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of over 200 [[LED]]-lit platforms that change colours ...according to pressure and speed changes elicited by viewers' interactions with the system.&lt;ref name="CBS Denver"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sadusky|first1=Heather|title=We Are Still The Wild West: TEDx Invigorates Denver|url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/2015/06/14/we-are-still-the-wild-west-tedx-invigorates-denver/|website=CBS Denver|publisher=CBS Denver|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite web|last1=D’Addario|first1=Daniel|title=Pop Chart|url=http://time.com/3706715/pop-chart/|website=Time|publisher=Time|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Sabah"&gt;{{cite web|last1=ALDINÇ|first1=Burcu|title=Both young and old to be enchanted by light artwork|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/arts-culture/2015/10/05/both-young-and-old-to-be-enchanted-by-light-artwork|website=Daily Sabah|publisher=Daily Sabah|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Termed an "interactive light sculpture", where human interaction is necessary for its display, this installation has toured several countries.&lt;ref name="Palm Beach Daily News install"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sjostrom|first1=Jan|title=Light up the night: Interactive installation to illuminate waterfront|url=http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/news/local/light-up-the-night-interactive-installation-to-ill/nmTn7/|website=Palm Beach Daily News|publisher=Palm Beach Daily News|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specializing in works that involve technology and human interaction, she often includes musical elements into her creations. For instance, other projects or hers include [[laser harp]]s, where people elicit music via interrupting the laser arrangements.&lt;ref name="CBS Denver" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boulder Weekly2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moutinho|first1=Amada|title=Out of the Box|url=http://www.boulderweekly.com/article-14249-out-of-the-box.html|website=Boulder Weekly|publisher=Boulder Weekly|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Times-Picayune"&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacCash|first1=Doug|title=Voodoo Fest 2009 puts an emphasis on the visual|url=http://www.nola.com/voodoofest/index.ssf/2009/10/voodoo_experience_2009_puts_an.html|website=The Times-Picayune|publisher=The Times-Picayune|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="medium" /&gt;

According to the ''[[Boulder Weekly]]'', [[Google]] commissioned Lewin to "create an Android app for tracking feedback between her innovations and the groups of people interacting with them".&lt;ref name="Boulder Weekly"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bosler|first1=Cayte|title=Art in a digital world|url=http://www.boulderweekly.com/article-11238-art-in-a-digital-world.html|website=Boulder Weekly|publisher=Boulder Weekly|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewin, along with her ''Pool'' installation, was featured by the [[BBC News]] in May 2013.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dailey|first1=Kate|last2=Bressanin|first2=Anna|last3=Shnitser|first3=Ilya|title=Jen Lewin: Artist dazzles with light-and-sound installations|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22487281|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kyriarchy''', pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|aɪ|ɹ|i|ɑɹ|k|i}}, is in [[feminist theory]], a [[social system]] or set of connecting social systems built around [[Domination (sociology)|domination]], [[oppression]], and [[submission]]. The word was coined by [[Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza]] in 1992 to describe her theory of interconnected, interacting, and self-extending systems of domination and submission, in which a single individual might be oppressed in some relationships and [[Privilege (social inequality)|privileged]] in others. It is an [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] extension of the idea of [[patriarchy]] beyond gender.&lt;ref name="kwok"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza and Postcolonial Studies |author = Kwok Pui-lan | author-link = Kwok Pui-lan |year = 2009 |journal = Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion |volume = 25 |issue = 1 |pages = 191–197 |publisher = Indiana University Press |jstor =10.2979/fsr.2009.25.1.191  |doi=10.2979/fsr.2009.25.1.191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyriarchy encompasses [[sexism]], [[racism]], [[speciesism]], [[homophobia]], [[classism]], [[economic justice|economic injustice]], [[colonialism]], [[militarism]], [[ethnocentrism]], [[anthropocentrism]], and other forms of dominating hierarchies in which the subordination of one person or group to another is internalized and institutionalized.{{r|teraudkalns}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Her Master's Tools?: Feminist And Postcolonial Engagements of Historical-critical Discourse|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RO9YnY2xKaQC|publisher = BRILL|date = 2005|isbn = 9004130527|language = en|first = Caroline Vander|last = Stichele|first2 = Todd C.|last2 = Penner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term was coined by Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza&lt;ref name="fiorenza_2001"&gt;{{cite book |title = Wisdom Ways: Introducing Feminist Biblical Interpretation |chapter = Glossary |last = Schüssler Fiorenza |first = Elisabeth |authorlink = Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza |publisher = Orbis Books |location = New York |year = 2001 |chapterurl = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dku%2Frios |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ufDNBgAAQBAJ |isbn=1608332527}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1992 when she published her book ''But She Said: Feminist Practices of Biblical Interpretation''.&lt;ref name="fiorenza_2009"&gt;{{cite book |title = Prejudice and Christian beginnings: investigating race, gender, and ethnicity in early Christian studies |chapter = Introduction: Exploring the Intersections of Race, Gender, Status and Ethnicity in Early Christian Studies |last = Schüssler Fiorenza |first = Elisabeth |authorlink = Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza |editor1-last  = Nasrallah |editor1-first = Laura |editor2-last = Schüssler Fiorenza |editor2-first = Elisabeth |publisher = Fortress Press |location = Minneapolis |year = 2009 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u7XoAi3VfOEC |isbn=1451412843}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from {{lang-el|κύριος, [[kyrios]]}}, "lord, master" and {{lang-el|ἄρχω, archō}}, "to lead, rule, govern".&lt;ref name=fiorenza_2009 /&gt;{{r|teraudkalns}} The word "kyriarchy" ({{lang-el|κυριαρχία, kyriarchia}}, a valid Greek formation, though it is not found in ancient Greek) can now be used to mean "[[sovereignty]]", i.e. the rulership of a sovereign.

== Usage ==
The term was originally developed in the context of feminist theological discourse, and has been used in some other areas of academia as a non-gender based descriptor of systems of power, as opposed to [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Susana|title=Close Kin and Distant Relatives: The Paradox of Respectability in Black Women's Literature|date=February 4, 2014|publisher=University of Virginia Press|isbn=0813935512|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXWjAQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=kyriarchy&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also widely used outside of scholarly contexts.&lt;ref name=osborne&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Osborne|first1=Natalie|title=Intersectionality and kyriarchy: A framework for approaching power and social justice in planning and climate change adaptation|journal=Planning Theory|date=2015|volume=14|issue=2|page=132|doi=10.1177/1473095213516443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural positions==
Schüssler Fiorenza describes interdependent "stratifications of gender, race, class, religion, [[heterosexism|heterosexualism]], and age" as ''structural positions'' assigned at birth. She suggests that people inhabit several positions, and that positions with privilege become nodal points through which other positions are experienced. For example, in a context where gender is the primary privileged position (e.g., [[patriarchy]]), gender becomes the nodal point through which sexuality, race, and class are experienced. In a context where class is the primary privileged position (i.e., [[classism]]), gender and race are experienced through class dynamics. Fiorenza stresses that kyriarchy is not a hierarchical system as it does not focus on one point of domination. Instead it is described as a "complex pyramidal system" with those on the bottom of the pyramid experiencing the "full power of kyriarchal oppression". The kyriarchy is recognized as the [[status quo]] and therefore its oppressive structures may not be recognized.&lt;ref name=fiorenza_2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name="reed-bouley" /&gt;

To maintain this system, kyriarchy relies on the creation of a servant class, race, gender, or people. The position of this class is reinforced through "education, socialization, and brute violence and [[malestream]] rationalization".&lt;ref name=fiorenza_2009 /&gt; Tēraudkalns suggests that these structures of oppression are self-sustained by [[internalized oppression]]; those with relative power tend to remain in power, while those without tend to remain disenfranchised.&lt;ref name="teraudkalns"&gt;{{cite book |title = Religion and political change in Europe: past and present |chapter = Construction of Masculinities in Contemporary Christianity |pages = 223–232 |last = Tēraudkalns |first = Valdis |editor-last = Cimdiņa |editor-first = Ausma |publisher = PLUS |year = 2003 |isbn=8884921414}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structures of oppression also amplify and feed into each other.&lt;ref name="reed-bouley"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Antiracist Theological Education as a Site of Struggle for Justice|last = Reed-Bouley|first = Jennifer|date = Spring 2012|journal = Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion|doi = 10.2979/jfemistudreli.28.1.178|volume=28|pages=178–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most investigators accept the definition of '''language intensity''' proposed by John Waite Bowers:&lt;ref&gt;http://comm.colorado.edu/bowersj/; (1963), p. 345; 1964, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; a quality of language that "indicates the degree to which the speaker's attitude toward a concept deviates from neutrality." Intensity as a [[lexical variable]] in [[communication studies]] has generated extensive empirical research.

==Theoretical setting==
A theory proposed by Bradac, Bowers, and Courtright (1979, 1980) asserts causal relationships among intensity and a number of other psychological, social, and communication variables. An experimental study by Hamilton, Hunter, and Burgoon (1990) generally supports the relationships proposed by the theory at least in the limited domain of persuasion.
 
Intensity has been related to:
* Other message variables including [[verbal immediacy]], [[lexical diversity]] (Bowers, 2006; Bradac, Bowers, &amp; Courtright, 1979, 1980), [[message style]] (Burgoon &amp; Miller, 1971), and [[verbal aggressiveness]] (Greenberg, 1976)
* Psychological variables such as [[cognitive stress]] (Bradac, Konsky, &amp; Elliott, 1976; Burgoon &amp; Miller, 1971; Daly &amp; Miller, 1975; Franzwa, 1969; Osgood &amp; Walker, 1975), arousal (Bowers, 1963; Carmichael &amp; Cronkhite, 1965), and need for approval (Basehart, 1971)
* Attributional variables including attributions of [[source internality]] (Bradac, Hosman, &amp; Tardy, 1978; Rotter, 1966), attributions of [[source competence]] (Burgoon, Jones, &amp; Stewart, 1975; Infante, 1975; McEwen &amp; Greenberg, 1970; Mehrley &amp; McCroskey, 1970; Miller &amp; Basehart, 1969; Miller &amp; Lobe, 1967), and attributions of source similarity with audience (Bourhis, Giles, &amp; Taajfel, 1973; McEwen &amp; Greenberg, 1970; Miller &amp; Basehart, 1969; Wheeless, 1978)
* Speaker–audience attitudinal [[congruence relation|congruency]] and [[discrepancy function|discrepancy]] (Infante, 1975; McEwen &amp; Greenberg, 1970; Mehrley &amp; McCroskey, 1970)

{{Language politics}}
[[File:French and Flemish Sign in Brussels.jpg|thumb|The politics of language are evident in French-speaking Brussels, which is located in the Flanders region of Belgium, where people typically speak Flemish.  Divisive preference of either language is avoided by using both French and Flemish on nearly all signs in Brussels.]]
'''Language politics''' is the way language and linguistic differences between peoples are dealt with in the political arena.  This could manifest as government recognition, as well as how language is treated in official capacities.  Some examples:

*Legal status of a language as an [[official language]] in a [[jurisdiction (area)|country, state, or other jurisdiction]]. This generally means that all official documents affecting a country or region are published in the official language(s), but not in those that are not. Evidence in a court of law may also be expected to be presented in an official language.&lt;ref name=Patten2011&gt;{{cite journal |title= Political Theory and Language Policy |author= Alan Patten |journal= Political Theory |volume=29 |number=5 |date=October 2011 |pages=691–715 |publisher=Princeton|url= http://www.princeton.edu/~apatten/languagepolicy_politicaltheory.pdf |accessdate= September 7, 2018 |format=pdf|doi=10.1177/0090591701029005005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In countries where there are more than one main language, there are often political implications in decisions that are seen to promote one group of speakers over another, and this is often referred to as language politics. An example of a country with this type of language politics is [[Belgium]].
*In countries where there is one main language, immigrants seeking full [[citizenship]] may be expected to have a degree of fluency in that language ('language politics' then being a reference to the debate over the appropriateness of this). This has been a feature of [[Australian politics]].
*At various times [[minority language]]s have either been promoted or banned in schools, as politicians have either sought to promote a minority language with a view to strengthening the cultural identity of its speakers, or banning its use (either for teaching, or on occasion an entire ban on its use), with a view to promoting a national identity based on the majority language. An example of recent promotion of a minority language are [[Welsh language|Welsh]] or [[Leonese language|Leonese]] by the Leonese City Council, an example of official discouragement of a minority language is [[Breton language|Breton]].
*Language politics also sometimes relates to [[dialect]], where speakers of a particular dialect are perceived as speaking a more culturally 'advanced' or 'correct' form of the language. Politicians may therefore try to use that dialect rather than their own when in the public eye. Alternatively, at times those speaking the dialect perceived as more 'correct' may try to use another dialect when in the public eye to be seen as a 'man/woman of the people'.
*To promote national identity, what are strictly dialects of the same language may be promoted as separate languages to promote a sense of national identity (examples include [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]&amp;nbsp;– the latter two also use different scripts for what is linguistically the same language&amp;nbsp;– [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] for Serbian and [[Latin alphabet|roman script]] for Croatian). Whether or not something is a language can also involve language politics, for instance, [[Political views on the Macedonian language|Macedonian]].
*The use of 'he' and other words implying the masculine in documents has been a political issue relating to [[women's rights]].
*The use of words which are considered by some to have negative implications to describe a group of people e.g. Gypsies (or even more negatively, 'Gypos') instead of [[Romani people|Romani]], or indeed using the term 'Gypsies' to cover [[Irish Traveller|Traveller]] peoples as well as Romanies.
*'[[Political correctness]]' issues often stem from the use of words. For instance, some may object to the person in charge of an organisation being referred to as 'chairman', on the grounds that it implies a man must be in charge.
*Co-existence of competing spelling systems for the same language, associated with different political camps. E.g.
** [[Debate on traditional and simplified Chinese characters]]
** [[Reforms of Russian orthography|Simplification of Russian orthography]]; proposals for such a reform were viewed as subversive in the late years of the Russian Empire and were implemented by the  [[Bolshevik]]s in 1918, after which the "old orthography" became associated with the [[White movement]].
** The two spelling systems for the [[Belarusian language]], one of which is associated with the country's political opposition.
Language is also utilised in political matters to unify, organise and criticise in order to unify a political group.
* The [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet]] preserved in [[Transnistria]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4940">The '''lazy user model of solution selection''' ('''LUM''') is a model in [[information systems]] proposed by Tétard and Collan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Collan, M.|author2=Tetard, F.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2007|title=Lazy User Theory of Solution Selection|conference=Proceedings or the CELDA 2007 Conference|pages=273–278|location=Algarve, Portugal, 7–9, December, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; that tries to explain how an individual selects a solution to fulfill a need from a set of possible solution alternatives. LUM expects that a solution is selected from a set of available solutions based on the amount of effort the solutions require from the user&amp;nbsp;– the user is supposed to select the solution that carries the least effort. The model is applicable to a number of different types of situations, but it can be said to be closely related to [[technology acceptance model]]s.

The model draws from earlier works on how least effort affects human behaviour in information seeking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zipf, G.K.|year=1949|title=Human Behavior and the Principle of Least Effort|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading MA, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in scaling of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ferrer i Cancho, R.|author2=R.V. Solé|lastauthoramp=y|title=Least effort and the origins of scaling in human language|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2003|volume=100|issue=7|pages=788–91|doi=10.1073/pnas.0335980100|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/100/3/788.full.pdf|pmid=12540826|pmc=298679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier research within the discipline of [[information systems]] especially within the topic of technology acceptance and technology adoption is closely related to the lazy user model.

==The model structure==
The model starts from the observation that there is a "[[user need]]", i.e. it is expected that there is a "clearly definiable, fully satisfiable want" that the user wants satisfied (it can also be said that the user has a problem that he/she wants solved). So there is a place for a solution, product, or service.

The user need defines the set of possible solutions (products, services etc.) that fulfill the user need. The basic model considers for simplicity needs that are 100% satisfiable and services that 100% satisfy the needs. This means that only the solutions that solve the problem are relevant. This logically means that the need defines the possible satisfying solutions&amp;nbsp;– a set of solutions (many different products/services) that all can fulfill the user need. LUM is not limited to looking at one solution separately.

All of the solutions in the set that fulfill the need have their own characteristics; some are good and suitable for the user, others unsuitable and unacceptable&amp;nbsp;– for example, if the user is in a train and wants to know what the result from a tennis match is right now, he/she may only use the types of solutions to the problem that are available to him/her. The "user state" determines the set of available/suitable solutions for the user and thus limits the (available) set of possible solutions to fulfill the user need. The user state is a very wide concept, it is the user characteristics at the time of the need. The user state includes, e.g., age, wealth, location ... everything that determines the state of the user in relation to the solutions in the set of the possible solutions to fulfill the user need.

The model supposes that after the user need has defined the set of possible solutions that fulfill the user need and the user state has limited the set to the available plausible solutions that fulfill the user need the user will "select" a solution from the set to fulfill the need. Obviously if the set is empty the user does not have a way to fulfill the need. The lazy user model assumes that the user will make the selection from the limited set based on the lowest level of effort. Effort is understood as the combination of monetary cost + time needed + physical/mental effort needed.&lt;ref name="HICSS"&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Franck Tetard|author2=Mikael Collan|title=Lazy User Theory: A Dynamic Model to Understand User Selection of Products and Services|work=hicss|pages=1–9|conference=42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences|year=2009|url=https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/hicss/2009/3450/00/09-13-01.pdf|doi=10.1109/HICSS.2009.287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Considerations==
The lazy user theory has implications when thinking about the effect of learning in technology adoption (for example in the adoption of new information systems).&lt;ref name="HICSS"/&gt;

A '''mechanical biological treatment''' system is a type of waste processing facility that combines a sorting facility with a form of biological treatment such as [[composting]] or [[anaerobic digestion]]. MBT plants are designed to process [[municipal solid waste|mixed household waste]] as well as [[commercial waste|commercial]] and [[industrial waste]]s.

==Process==
[[File:Mechanical biological treatment flowchart.svg|right|thumbnail|350px|Process flow chart]]
The terms ''mechanical biological treatment'' or ''mechanical biological pre-treatment'' relate to a group of [[list of solid waste treatment technologies|solid waste treatment systems]]. These systems enable the recovery of materials contained within the [[mixed waste]] and facilitate the stabilisation of the [[biodegradable]] component of the material.&lt;ref&gt;Enviros (2006) [http://www.mbt.landfill-site.com/ Mechanical biological treatment website], ''www.mbt.landfill-site.com'', Waste Technology Home Page, Accessed 22.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juniper (2005) [http://www.juniper.co.uk/Publications/downloads.html MBT: A Guide for Decision Makers – Processes, Policies &amp; Markets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817181127/http://www.juniper.co.uk/Publications/downloads.html |date=2007-08-17 }}, ''www.juniper.co.uk'', (Project funding supplied by Sita Environmental Trust), Accessed 22.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;

The sorting component of the plants typically resemble a [[materials recovery facility]]. This component is either configured to recover the individual elements of the waste or produce a [[refuse-derived fuel]] that can be used for the generation of power.

The components of the mixed waste stream that can be recovered include:
*[[Ferrous metal]]
*[[Non-ferrous metal]]
* [[Plastic]]
* [[Glass]]

==Terminology==
MBT is also sometimes termed biological mechanical treatment (BMT), however this simply refers to the order of processing (i.e., the biological phase of the system precedes the mechanical sorting). MBT should not be confused with [[mechanical heat treatment]] (MHT).

== Mechanical sorting ==
{{See also|Materials recovery facility}}
[[Image:MBT sorting.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|Wet material recovery facility, [[Hiriya]], [[Israel]] ]]

The "mechanical" element is usually an automated mechanical [[sorting]] stage. This either removes [[recyclable]] elements from a mixed waste stream (such as metals, plastics, glass, and paper) or processes them. It typically involves factory style [[conveyor]]s, industrial [[magnet]]s, [[eddy current separators]], [[trommel]]s, [[Industrial shredder|shredders]], and other tailor made systems, or the sorting is done manually at hand picking stations. The mechanical element has a number of similarities to a [[materials recovery facility]] (MRF).&lt;ref&gt;Sita (2004) [http://www.sita.co.uk/assets/PP_MBT.pdf Sita Mechanical Biological Treatment Position Paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908000656/http://www.sita.co.uk/assets/PP_MBT.pdf |date=2006-09-08 }}, ''www.sita.co.uk'', Accessed 22.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;

Some systems integrate a wet MRF to separate by density and flotation and to recover and wash the recyclable elements of the waste in a form that can be sent for recycling. MBT can alternatively process the waste to produce a high calorific fuel termed [[refuse derived fuel]] (RDF). RDF can be used in [[cement kiln]]s or thermal [[Combustion power plant|combustion power plants]] and is generally made up from plastics and biodegradable organic waste. Systems which are configured to produce RDF include the Herhof and Ecodeco processes. It is a common misconception that all MBT processes produce RDF; this is not the case, and depends strictly on system configuration and suitable local markets for MBT outputs.

== Biological processing ==
{{See also|composting|anaerobic digestion}}

[[Image:MBT anaerobicdigesters.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|Twin stage &amp; [[upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion]] (UASB) [[anaerobic digester]]s]]

The "biological" element refers to either:
*[[Anaerobic digestion]]
*[[Composting]]
*[[Biodrying]]

Anaerobic digestion harnesses anaerobic microorganisms to break down the [[biodegradable waste|biodegradable]] component of the waste to produce [[biogas]] and [[digestate|soil improver]]. The biogas can be used to generate [[electricity]] and [[heat]].

Biological can also refer to a composting stage. Here the organic component is broken down by naturally occurring aerobic microorganisms. They breakdown the waste into carbon dioxide and compost. There is no green energy produced by systems employing only composting treatment for the biodegradable waste.

In the case of biodrying, the waste material undergoes a period of rapid heating through the action of aerobic microbes. During this partial composting stage the heat generated by the microbes result in rapid drying of the waste. These systems are often configured to produce a refuse-derived fuel where a dry, light material is advantageous for later transport and combustion.

Some systems incorporate both anaerobic digestion and composting. This may either take the form of a full anaerobic digestion phase, followed by the maturation (composting) of the digestate. Alternatively a partial anaerobic digestion phase can be induced on water that is percolated through the raw waste, dissolving the readily available sugars, with the remaining material being sent to a [[windrow composting]] facility.

By processing the biodegradable waste either by anaerobic digestion or by [[compost]]ing MBT technologies help to reduce the contribution of [[greenhouse gas]]es to [[global warming]].

Usable wastes for this system:
*[[Municipal solid waste]]
*[[Commercial waste|Commercial]] and [[industrial waste]]
*[[Sewage sludge]]

Possible products of this system:
* Renewable fuel (biogas) leading to renewable power
* Recovered recycable materials such as metals, paper, plastics, glass etc.
*[[Digestate]] - an organic fertiliser and soil improver
*[[Carbon credit|Carbon credits]] – additional revenues
* High calorific fraction [[Refuse-derived fuel|refuse derived fuel]] - renewable fuel content dependent upon biological component
* Residual unusable materials prepared for their final safe treatment (e.g., [[incineration]] or [[gasification]]) and/or [[landfill]]

Further advantages:
* Small fraction of inert [[residual waste]]
* Reduction of the waste volume to be deposited to at least a half (density &gt; 1.3 t/m³), thus the lifetime of the landfill is at least twice as long as usually
* Utilisation of the [[leachate]] in the process
* [[Landfill gas]] not problematic as biological component of waste has been stabilised
* Daily covering of landfill not necessary

== Consideration of applications ==
MBT systems can form an integral part of a region's waste treatment infrastructure. These systems are typically integrated with [[kerbside collection]] schemes. In the event that a refuse-derived fuel is produced as a by-product then a combustion facility would be required. This could either be an incineration facility or a gasifier.

Alternatively MBT solutions can diminish the need for home separation and kerbside collection of recyclable elements of waste. This gives the ability of local authorities, municipalities and councils to reduce the use of waste vehicles on the roads and keep recycling rates high.

==Position of environmental groups==
[[Friends of the Earth]] suggests that the best environmental route for [[municipal solid waste|residual waste]] is to firstly maximise removal of remaining recyclable materials from the waste stream (such as metals, plastics and paper). The amount of waste remaining should be composted or anaerobically digested and disposed of to [[landfill]], unless sufficiently clean to be used as compost.

A report by Eunomia&lt;ref&gt;Eunomia (2006) [http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/reports/changing_climate.pdf A changing climate for energy from waste?]&lt;/ref&gt; undertook a detailed analysis of the climate impacts of different residual waste technologies. It found that an MBT process that extracts both the metals and plastics prior to landfilling is one of the best options for dealing with our residual waste, and has a lower impact than either MBT processes producing RDF for incineration or incineration of waste without MBT.

Friends of the Earth does not support MBT plants that produce refuse derived fuel (RDF), and believes MBT processes should occur in small, localised treatment plants.&lt;ref&gt;Friends of the Earth (2008) [http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/briefings/mchnical_biolo_treatmnt.pdf Mechanical Biological Treatment Briefing], ''www.foe.co.uk''&lt;/ref&gt;

In literature, a '''moral universe''' is the moral nature of the universe as a whole in relation to human life, or a specific moral code.

A moral universe implies that we live in a basically spiritual universe that is somehow ordered by a higher power, by invisible feelings of good and bad, a 'cosmic order' reminiscent of the early Greeks &lt;ref&gt;William Allan, ''Divine Justice and Cosmic Order in Early Greek Epic,'' The Journal of Hellenic Studies, Vol. 126, (2006), pp.1-35&lt;/ref&gt; that underpins and motivates our actions. Or a 'moral force' that means our actions must have definite effects which we carry with us. In this respect its meaning comes close to the [[Hindu]] concept of [[Karma]].

Those who reject this idea tend to believe that the universe is just physical, has no spiritual component at all, that events are random and have no deeper meaning or purpose, and that there can be no consequences of any kind to our actions and thus that we live in an amoral or nihilistic universe,&lt;ref&gt;J K Hyde, ''Concepts of Power in Kierkegaard and Nietzsche,'' UK: Ashgate, 2010, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[Nietzsche]]'s "[[God is dead]]," aphorism.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, Adrian Del Caro, Robert B. Pippin, ''Nietzsche: Thus Spoke Zarathustra,'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; Such might be the position of "anti-moral free spirits-nihilists."&lt;ref&gt;David Davidson, ''From Virgin to Dynamo: The "Amoral Woman" in European Cinema,'' Cinema Journal, Vol. 21, No. 1, Psychological Aspects (Autumn, 1981), pp.31-58&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history, various methods of '''musical instrument classification''' have been used. The most commonly used system divides instruments into [[string instrument]]s, [[woodwind instrument]]s, [[brass instrument]]s and [[percussion instrument]]s; however, other schemes have been devised.

==Chinese classification==
The oldest known scheme of classifying instruments is [[China|Chinese]] and dates from the 3rd millennium BC.{{citation needed|reason=How is that date possible when the earliest Chinese writing dates back to the second half of the 2nd millenium BC?|date=May 2013}} It grouped instruments according to the materials they are made of. Instruments made of [[Rock (geology)|stone]] were in one group, those of [[wood]] in another, those of [[silk]] are in a third, and those of [[bamboo]] in a fourth, as recorded in the ''Yo Chi'' (record of ritual music and dance), compiled from sources of the [[Zhou dynasty|Chou period]] (9th-5th centuries BC) and corresponding to the four seasons and four winds.&lt;ref name="Kartomi1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rowell1992"&gt;{{cite book|work=Music and Musical Thought in Early India|page=54|first=Lewis Eugene|last=Rowell|date=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|title=Three Ancient Conceptions of Musical Sound}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eight-fold system of pa yin (八音 "eight sounds", "octave"), from the same source, occurred gradually, and in the legendary [[Emperor Zhun]]'s time (3rd millennium BC) it is believed to have been presented in the following order: [[metal]] (''chin''), stone (''shih''), silk (''ssu''), bamboo (''che''), [[gourd]] (''piao''), [[clay]] (''t'u''), [[leather]] (''hoes''), and wood (''mutt'') classes, and it correlated to the eight seasons and eight winds of Chinese culture, autumn and west, autumn-winter and NW, summer and south, spring and east, winter-spring and NE, summer-autumn and SW, winter and north, and spring-summer and SE, respectively.&lt;ref name="Kartomi1990"/&gt;

However, the [[Chou-Li]] (Rites of Chou), an anonymous treatise compiled from earlier sources in about the 2nd century BC, had the following order: metal, stone, clay, leather, silk, wood, gourd, and bamboo. The same order was presented in the [[Tso Chuan]] (Commentary of Tso), attributed to [[Tso Chiu-Ming]], probably compiled in the 4th century BC.&lt;ref name="Kartomi1990"/&gt;

Much later, [[Ming dynasty]] (14th-17th century) scholar [[Chu Tsai Yu]] recognized three groups: those instruments using muscle power or used for musical accompaniment, those that are blown, and those that are [[rhythmic]], a scheme which was probably the first scholarly attempt, while the earlier ones were traditional, folk [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]].&lt;ref&gt;Margaret  Kartomi, 2011, Upward and Downward Classifications of Musical Instruments-musicology.ff,cuni.cz)&lt;/ref&gt;

More usually, instruments are classified according to how the sound is initially produced (regardless of [[Audio editing software|post-processing]], i.e., an electric guitar is still a string-instrument regardless of what analog or digital/computational post-processing [[effects pedals]] may be used with it).

==Western classification==
The modern system divides instruments into wind, strings and percussion. It is of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] origin (in the Hellenistic period, prominent proponents being [[Nicomachus]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]). The scheme was later expanded by [[Martin Agricola]], who distinguished plucked string instruments, such as [[guitar]]s, from bowed string instruments, such as [[violin]]s. [[European classical music|Classical musicians]] today do not always maintain this division (although plucked strings are grouped separately from bowed strings in [[sheet music]]), but distinguish between wind instruments with a reed ([[woodwind instrument|woodwinds]]) and those where the air is set in motion directly by the lips ([[brass instrument]]s).&lt;!-- Harmonicas? Accordions? Flutes/Recorders? Synthesizers/Electronica? --&gt;

Many instruments do not fit very neatly into this scheme. The [[serpent (musical instrument)|serpent]], for example, ought to be classified as a brass instrument, as a column of air is set in motion by the lips. However, it looks more like a woodwind instrument, and is closer to one in many ways, having finger-holes to control pitch, rather than valves.

[[Keyboard instrument]]s do not fit easily into this scheme. For example, the [[piano]] has strings, but they are struck by hammers, so it is not clear whether it should be classified as a string instrument or a percussion instrument. For this reason, keyboard instruments are often regarded as inhabiting a category of their own, including all instruments played by a keyboard, whether they have struck strings (like the piano), plucked strings (like the [[harpsichord]]) or no strings at all (like the [[celesta]]).

It might be said that with these extra categories, the classical system of instrument classification focuses less on the fundamental way in which instruments produce sound, and more on the technique required to play them.

Various names have been assigned to these three traditional Western groupings:&lt;ref name="Kartomi1990"/&gt;{{rp|136–138, 157, notes for Chapter 10}}
* [[Boethius]] (5th and 6th centuries) labelled them ''intensione ut nervis, spiritu ut tibiis ("breath in the tube"), and percussione'';
* [[Cassiodorus]], a younger contemporary of Boethius, used the names ''tensibilia, percussionalia'', and ''inflatilia'';
* [[Roger Bacon]] (13th century) dubbed them ''tensilia, inflativa'', and ''percussionalia'';
* [[Ugolino da Orvieto]] (14th and 15th centuries) called them ''intensione ut nervis, spiritu ut tibiis'', and ''percussione'';
* [[Sebastien de Brossard]] (1703) referred to them as ''enchorda'' or ''entata'' (but only for instruments with several strings), ''pneumatica'' or ''empneousta'', and ''krusta'' (from the Greek for hit or strike) or ''pulsatilia'' (for percussives);
* [[Filippo Bonanni]] (1722) used vernacular names: ''sonori per il fiato'', ''sonori per la tensione'', and ''sonori per la percussione'';
* Joseph Majer (1732) called them ''pneumatica'', ''pulsatilia'' (percussives including plucked instruments), and ''fidicina'' (from fidula, fiddle) (for bowed instruments);
* Johann Eisel (1738) dubbed them ''pneumatica, pulsatilia'', and ''fidicina'';
* [[Johannes de Muris]] (1784) used the terms ''chordalia'', ''foraminalia'' (from ''foramina'', "bore" in reference to the bored tubes), and ''vasalia'' (for "vessels");
* [[Regino of Prum]] (1784) called them ''tensibile'', ''inflatile'', and ''percussionabile''.
* Ottoman encyclopedist [[Hadji Khalifa]] (17th century) also recognized the same three classes in his ''[[Kashf al-Zunun an Asami al-Kutub wa al-Funun]]'' ("Clarification and Conjecture About the Names of Books and Sciences"), a treatise on the origin and construction of musical instruments. but this was exceptional for [[Near East]]ern writers as they mostly ignored the percussion group as did early [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic Greeks]], the Near Eastern culture traditionally and that period of Greek history having low regard for that group.&lt;ref name="Kartomi1990"/&gt;
* The [[T'boli]] of [[Mindanao]] use the same three categories as well, but group the strings (''t'duk'') with the winds (''nawa'') together based on a gentleness-strength dichotomy (''lemnoy''-''megel'', respectively), regarding the percussion group (''tembol'') as strong and the winds-strings group as gentle. The division pervades T'boli thought about cosmology, social characters of men and women, and artistic styles.&lt;ref name="Kartomi1990"/&gt;

==Mahillon and Hornbostel–Sachs systems==
An ancient system of [[India]]n origin, dating from the 4th or 3rd century BC, in the [[Natya Shastra]], a theoretical treatise on music and dramaturgy, by [[Bharata Muni]], divides instruments into four main classification groups: instruments where the sound is produced by vibrating strings (''tata vadya'', "stretched instruments"); instruments where the sound is produced by vibrating columns of air (''susira vadya'', "hollow instruments"); percussion instruments made of wood or metal (''Ghana vadya'', "solid instruments"); and percussion instruments with skin heads, or [[drum]]s (''avanaddha vadya'', "covered instruments").

[[Victor-Charles Mahillon]] later adopted a system very similar to this. He was the curator of the musical instrument collection of the conservatoire in [[Brussels]], and for the 1888 catalogue of the collection divided instruments into four groups: strings, winds, drums, and other percussion. This scheme was later taken up by [[Erich von Hornbostel]] and [[Curt Sachs]] who published an extensive new scheme for classication in ''Zeitschrift für Ethnologie'' in 1914. Their scheme is widely used today, and is most often known as the [[Hornbostel–Sachs]] system (or the Sachs–Hornbostel system).

The original Sachs–Hornbostel system classified instruments into four main groups; the fifth group, electrophones, was added later by Sachs:
# [[idiophone]]s, such as the [[xylophone]], which produce sound by vibrating themselves;
# [[membranophone]]s, such as [[drum]]s or [[kazoo]]s, which produce sound by a vibrating membrane;
# [[chordophone]]s, such as the piano or [[cello]], which produce sound by vibrating strings;
# [[aerophone]]s, such as the [[pipe organ]] or [[oboe]], which produce sound by vibrating columns of air.
# [[electrophone]]s, such as the [[synthesizer]] or [[electric bass]], which produce sound through electricity and is required to be plugged into an amplifier.

In the [[Hornbostel–Sachs]] classification of musical instruments, lamellophones are considered [[plucked idiophone]]s, a category that includes various forms of [[jaw harp]] and the European mechanical [[music box]], as well as the huge variety of African and Afro-Latin [[thumb piano]]s such as the [[mbira]] and [[marimbula]].

Later Sachs added a fifth category, [[electrophone]]s, such as [[theremin]]s, which produce sound by electronic means.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Musical Instruments'', C. Sachs, Norton, New York, 1940&lt;/ref&gt; Modern synthesizers and electronic instruments fall in this category. Within each category are many subgroups. The system has been criticised and revised over the years, but remains widely used by [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologists]] and [[organology|organologists]].

One notable example of this criticism is that there is care to be taken with electrophones, as some electronic instruments like the [[electric guitar]] (chordophone) and some [[electronic keyboard]]s (sometimes idiophones or chordophones) can produce music without electricity or the use of an amplifier.

==André Schaeffner==
&lt;!--[[André Schaeffner]] and [[Andre Schaeffner]] redirect directly here.--&gt;
In 1932, comparative musicologist (ethnomusicologist) [[André Schaeffner]] developed a new classification scheme that was "exhaustive, potentially covering all real and conceivable instruments".&lt;ref name="Kartomi1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kartomi|first=Margaret J.|title=On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|series=Chicago Studies in Ethnomusicology|date=1990-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|176}}

Schaeffner's system has only two top-level categories which he denoted by Roman numerals:
* I: instruments that make sound from vibrating solids:
** I.A: no tension (free solid, for example, [[xylophone]]s, [[cymbals]], or [[claves]]);
** I.B: linguaphones ([[lamellophone]]s) (solid fixed at only one end, such as a kalimba or thumb piano);
** I.C: chordophones (solid fixed at both ends, i.e. strings such as [[piano]] or [[harp]])); plus drums
* II: instruments that make sound from vibrating air (such as [[clarinets]], [[trumpets]], or [[Bullroarer (music)|bull-roarers]].)

The system agrees with Mahillon and Hornbostel–Sachs for [[chordophone]]s, but groups percussion instruments differently.

2nd-century Greek grammarian, sophist, and rhetoritician [[Julius Pollux]], in the chapter called De Musica of his ten-volume ''Onomastikon'', presented the two-class system, percussion (including strings) and winds, which persisted in medieval and postmedieval Europe. It was used by [[St. Augustine]] (4th and 5th centuries), in his De Ordine, applying the terms rhythmic (percussion and strings), organic (winds), and adding harmonic (the human voice); [[Isidore of Seville]] (6th to 7th centuries); [[Hugh of Saint Victor]] (12th century), also adding the voice; Magister Lambertus (13th century), adding the human voice as well; and [[Michael Praetorius]] (17th century).&lt;ref name="Kartomi1990"/&gt;{{rp|119–21,147}}

The [[Kpelle people|Kpelle]] of West Africa also use this system. They distinguish the struck (''yàle''), including both beaten and plucked, and the blown (''fêe'').&lt;ref name="Kartomi1990"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Stone]], "Let the Inside Be Sweet: the interpretation of music among the Kpelle of Liberia", 1982, Indiana U. Press&lt;/ref&gt; The ''yàle'' group is subdivided into five categories: instruments possessing lamellas (the sanzas); those possessing strings; those possessing a membrane (various drums); hollow wooden, iron, or bottle containers; and various rattles and bells. The [[Hausa people|Hausa]], also of West Africa, classify drummers into those who beat drums and those who beat (pluck) strings (the other four player classes are blowers, singers, acclaimers, and talkers),&lt;ref&gt;Ames and King. Glossary of Hausa Music and its Social Contexts, 1971, Northwestern U. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Kartomi does not specify if these two classifications pre-date Schaeffner or Pollux. The concept, the way the person produces the sound, is human-centered, which is part of their traditional culture so presumably they at least pre-date Schaeffner.

The MSA (Multi-Dimensional Scalogram Analysis) of René Lysloff and Jim Matson,&lt;ref&gt;A New Approach to the Classification of Sound-Producing Instruments, Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer, 1985, also at mywebspace.wisc.edu&lt;/ref&gt; using 37 variables, including characteristics of the sounding body, resonator, substructure, sympathetic vibrator, performance context, social context, and instrument tuning and construction, corroborated Schaeffner, producing two categories, aerophones and the chordophone-membranophone-idiophone combination.

===Elementary organology===
Another similar system is the five-class, physics-based organology that was presented by Steve Mann in 2007,&lt;ref name="Mann2007"&gt;{{cite conference|conference=New Interfaces for Musical Expression|title=Natural Interfaces for Musical Expression, Proceedings of the Conference on Interfaces for Musical Expression|pp=118–23|last=Mann|first=Steve|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprises Gaiaphones (Chordophones, [[Membranophone]]s, and [[Idiophone]]s), [[Hydraulophone]]s, [[Aerophone]]s, [[Plasmaphone]]s, and [[Quintephone]]s (electrically and optically produced music), the names referring to the five essences, earth, water, wind, fire and the [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]], thus adding three new categories to the Schaeffner taxonomy.

&lt;!--[[Elementary organology]], [[Aerophone (elementary organology)]], [[Gaiaphone]], [[Hydraulophone (elementary organology)]], [[Plasmaphone]], and [[Quintephone]] redirect directly here.--&gt;
Elementary organology, also known as physical organology, is a classification scheme based on the elements (i.e. states of matter) in which sound production takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Computer Music Journal

[[File:Musical instrument classification by physics-based organology.png|thumb|center|654px|Musical instrument classification in physics-based organology.]]

==Range==
Instruments can be classified by their musical range in comparison with other instruments in the same family. These terms are named after [[Vocal range|singing voice classifications]]:
* [[Soprano]] instruments: [[flute]], [[clarinet]], [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[violin]], [[trumpet]], [[oboe]], [[soprano saxophone]]
* [[Alto]] instruments: [[alto flute]], [[viola]], [[French horn]], [[natural horn]], [[alto horn]], [[alto saxophone]], [[Cor anglais|English horn]]
* [[Tenor]] instruments: [[trombone]], [[tenor saxophone]]
* [[Baritone]] instruments: [[cello]], [[baritone horn]], [[bass clarinet]], [[bassoon]], [[baritone saxophone]]
* [[Bass (instrument)|Bass]] instruments: [[double bass]], [[contrabassoon]], [[tuba]], [[bass saxophone]]

Some instruments fall into more than one category: for example, the cello may be considered either tenor or bass, depending on how its music fits into the ensemble, and the trombone may be [[alto]], tenor, or bass and the French horn, bass, [[baritone]], tenor, or alto, depending on which range it is played. In a typical concert band setting, the first alto saxophone covers soprano parts, while the second alto saxophone covers alto parts.

Many instruments include their range as part of their name: [[soprano saxophone]], [[alto saxophone]], [[tenor saxophone]], [[baritone saxophone]], [[baritone horn]], alto flute, [[bass flute]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|alto recorder]], [[bass guitar]], etc. Additional adjectives describe instruments above the soprano range or [[contrabass|below the bass]], for example: [[sopranino saxophone]], [[contrabass clarinet]].

When used in the name of an instrument, these terms are relative, describing the instrument's range in comparison to other instruments of its family and not in comparison to the human voice range or instruments of other families. For example, a bass flute's range is from C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to F{{music|sharp}}&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, while a bass clarinet plays about one octave lower.

==Other classifications==
Instruments can be categorized according to a common use, such as [[signal instrument]]s, a category that may include instruments in different Hornbostel–Sachs categories such as [[trumpet]]s, [[drum]]s, and [[gong]]s. An example based on this criterion is Bonanni (e.g., festive, military, and religious).&lt;ref name="Kartomi1990" /&gt; He separately classified them according to geography and era.

[[Jean-Benjamin de la Borde]] (1780) classified instruments according to ethnicity, his categories being black, Abyssinian, Chinese, Arabic, Turkisk, and Greek.&lt;ref name="Kartomi1990" /&gt;

Instruments can be classified according to the ensemble in which they play, or the role they play in the ensemble. For example, the [[horn section]] in popular music typically includes both [[brass instrument]]s and [[woodwind instrument]]s. The symphony orchestra typically has the strings in the front, the woodwinds in the middle, and the basses, brass, and percussion in the back.

=== Indonesian instruments ===
Classifications done for the Indonesian ensemble, the [[gamelan]], were done by [[Jaap Kunst]] (1949), Martopangrawit, Poerbapangrawit, and Sumarsam (all in 1984).&lt;ref name="Kartomi1990" /&gt; Kunst described five categories: nuclear theme (''cantus firmus'' in Latin and ''balungan'' ("skeletal ramework") in Indonesian); colotomic ( a word invented by Kunst) (interpunctuating), the gongs; countermelodic; paraphrasing (''panerusan''), subdivided as close to the nuclear theme and ornamental filling; agogic (tempo-regulating), drums.

R. Ng. Martopangrawit has two categories, irama (the rhythm instruments) and lagu (the melodic instruments), the former corresponds to Kunst's classes 2 and 5, and the latter to Kunst's 1, 3, and 4.

Kodrat Poerbapangrawit, similar to Kunst, derives six categories: ''balungan'', the ''saron'', ''demung'', and ''slenthem''; ''rerenggan'' (ornamental), the ''gendèr'', ''gambang'', and ''bonang''); ''wiletan'' (variable formulaic melodic), ''rebab'' and male chorus (''gerong''); ''singgetan'' (interpunctuating); ''kembang'' (floral), flute and female voice; jejeging wirama (tempo regulating), drums.

Sumarsam's scheme comprises:
* an inner melodic group (''lagu'')(with a wide range), divided as
** elaborating (''rebab, gerong, gendèr'' (a metallophone), ''gambang'' (a xylophone), ''pesindhen'' (female voice), ''celempung'' (plucked strings), ''suling'' (flute));
** mediating ( between the 1st and 3rd subdivisions (bonang (gong-chimes), saron panerus(a loud metallophone); and
** abstracting (''balungan'', "melodic abstraction")( with a 1-octave range), loud and soft metallophones (''saron barung, demung'', and ''slenthem'');
* an outer circle, the structural group (gongs), which underlines the structure of the work;
* and occupying the space outside the outer circle, the ''kendang'', a tempo-regulating group (drums).

The gamelan is also divided into front, middle, and back, much like the symphony orchestra.

An orally-transmitted Javanese taxonomy has 8 groupings:&lt;ref name="Kartomi1990"/&gt;
* ricikan dijagur ("instruments beaten with a padded hammer," e.g., suspended gongs);
* ricikan dithuthuk ("instruments knocked with a hard or semihard hammer," e.g., saron (similar to the glockenspiel) and gong-chimes);
* ricikan dikebuk ("hand-beaten instruments", e.g., kendhang (drum);
* ricikan dipethik ("plucked instruments");
* ricikan disendal ("pulled instruments," e.g., trump harp with string mechanism);
* ricikan dikosok ("bowed instruments");
* ricikan disebul ("blown instruments");
* ricikan dikocok ("shaken instruments").

A Javanese classification transmitted in literary form is as follows:&lt;ref name="Kartomi1990"/&gt;
* ricikan prunggu/wesi ("instruments made of bronze or iron");
* ricikan kulit ("leather instruments", drums);
* ricikan kayu ("wooden instruments");
* ricikan kawat/tali ("string instruments");
* ricikan bambu pring ("bamboo instruments", e.g., flutes).

This is much like the pa yin. It is suspected of being old but its age is unknown.

[[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] musicians (of West Sumatra) use the following taxonomy for ''bunyi-bunyian'' ("objects that sound"): ''dipukua'' ("beaten"), ''dipupuik'' ("blown), ''dipatiek'' ("plucked"), ''ditariek'' ("pulled"), ''digesek'' ("bowed"), ''dipusiang'' ("swung"). The last one is for the bull-roarer. They also distinguish instruments on the basis of origin because of sociohistorical contacts, and recognize three categories: Mindangkabau (''Minangkabau asli''), Arabic (''asal Arab''), and Western (''asal Barat''), each of these divided up according to the five categories. Classifying musical instruments on the basis sociohistorical factors as well as mode of sound production is common in Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Kartomi1990"/&gt;

The [[Batak]] of North Sumatra recognize the following classes: beaten (''alat pukul'' or ''alat palu''), blown (''alat tiup''), bowed (''alat gesek''), and plucked (''alat petik'') instruments, but their primary classification is of ensembles.&lt;ref name="Kartomi1990"/&gt;

=== West African instruments ===
In West Africa, tribes such as the [[Dan people|Dan]], [[Gio people|Gio]], Kpelle, [[Hausa people|Hausa]], [[Akan people|Akan]], and [[Dogon people|Dogon]], use a human-centered system. It derives from 4 myth-based parameters: the musical instrument's nonhuman owner (spirit, mask, sorcerer, or animal), the mode of transmission to the human realm (by gift, exchange, contract, or removal), the making of the instrument by a human (according to instructions from a nonhuman, for instance), and the first human owner. Most instruments are said to have a nonhuman origin, but some are believed invented by humans, e.g., the xylophone and the lamellophone.&lt;ref name="Kartomi1990" /&gt;

=== Kurt Reinhard ===
In 1960, German musicologist [[Kurt Reinhard (musicologist)|Kurt Reinhard]] presented a stylistic taxonomy, as opposed to a morphological one, with two divisions determined by either single or multiple voiced playing.&lt;ref name="Kartomi1990"/&gt; Each of these two divisions was subdivided according to pitch changeability (not changeable, freely changeable, and changeable by fixed intervals), and also by tonal continuity (discontinuous (as the marimba and drums) and continuous (the friction instruments (including bowed) and the winds), making 12 categories. He also proposed classification according to whether or not they had dynamic tonal variability, a characteristic that separates whole eras (e.g., the baroque from the classical) as in the transition from the terraced dynamics of the harpsichord to the crescendo of the piano, grading by degree of absolute loudness, timbral spectra, tunability, and degree of resonance.

=== Persia ===
[[Al-Farabi]], Persian scholar of the 10th century, also distinguished tonal duration. In one of his four schemes, in his two-volume ''[[Kitab al-Musiki al-Kabir]]'' (''Great Book of Music'') he identified five classes, in order of ranking, as follows: the human voice, the bowed strings (the ''rebab'') and winds, plucked strings, percussion, and dance, the first three pointed out as having continuous tone.

[[Ibn Sina]], Persian scholar of the 11th century, presented a scheme in his ''Kitab al-Najat'' (Book of the Delivery), made the same distinction. He used two classes. In his ''[[Kitab al-Shifa]]'' (Book of Soul Healing), he proposed another taxonomy, of five classes: [[fret]]ted instruments, unfretted (open) stringed, [[lyres]] and [[harps]], bowed stringed, wind (reeds and some other woodwinds, such as the flute and bagpipe), other wind instruments such as the organ, and the stick-struck santur (a board zither). The distinction between fretted and open was in classic Persian fashion.

The Act required states to develop assessments in basic skills. To receive federal school funding, states had to give these assessments to all students at select grade levels.

The act did not assert a national achievement standard—each state developed its own standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Child Left Behind|url=http://www.scoe.org/pub/htdocs/nclb.html|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCLB expanded the federal role in public education through further emphasis on annual testing, annual academic progress, report cards, and teacher qualifications, as well as significant changes in funding.&lt;ref name="No Child Left Behind"/&gt;

The bill passed in the Congress with bipartisan support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/1 |title=To close the achievement gap with accountability, flexibility, and choice, so that no child is left behind.|date=2001-03-22 |publisher=Library of Congress&lt;!--|publisher-url=https://www.congress.gov/--&gt;|accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, criticism from right, left, and center had accumulated so much that a [[bipartisan Congress]] stripped away the national features of No Child Left Behind.

==Provisions of the act==
No Child Left Behind requires all public schools receiving federal funding to administer a statewide [[standardized test]] annually to all students. Schools that receive [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act#Title|Title I]] funding through the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965]] must make [[Adequate Yearly Progress]] (AYP) in test scores (e.g. each year, fifth graders must do better on standardized tests than the previous year's fifth graders).

If the school's results are repeatedly poor, then steps are taken to improve the school.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Erin &amp; Rotherham, Andy. [http://www.educationsector.org/research/research_show.htm?doc_id=511096 "States' Evidence: What It Means to Make 'Adequate Yearly Progress' Under NCLB"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124025205/http://www.educationsector.org/research/research_show.htm?doc_id=511096 |date=2010-01-24 }}. Retrieved August 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Schools that miss AYP for a second consecutive year are publicly labeled as "In Need of Improvement," and must develop a two-year improvement plan for the subject that the school is not teaching well. Students have the option to transfer to a better school within the school district, if any exists.
* Missing AYP in the third year forces the school to offer free tutoring and other supplemental education services to students who are struggling.
* If a school misses its AYP target for a fourth consecutive year, the school is labelled as requiring "corrective action," which might involve wholesale replacement of staff, introduction of a new curriculum, or extending the amount of time students spend in class.
* A fifth year of failure results in planning to restructure the entire school; the plan is implemented if the school unsuccessfully hits its AYP targets for the sixth consecutive year. Common options include closing the school, turning the school into a [[charter school]], hiring a private company to run the school, or asking the state office of education to run the school directly.

States must create AYP objectives consistent with the following requirements of the law:&lt;ref name="American Educational Research Assosiation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Linn|first=Robert L.|author2=Eva L. Baker |author3=Damian W Betebenner |title=Accountability Systems: Implications of Requirements of the No Child Left behind Act of 2001|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=31|date= Aug–Sep 2002|issue=6|pages=3–16|jstor=3594432|doi=10.3102/0013189x031006003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# States must develop AYP statewide measurable objectives for improved achievement by all students and for specific groups: economically disadvantaged students, students with disabilities, and students with [[limited English proficiency]].
# The objectives must be set with the goal of having all students at the proficient level or above within 12 years (i.e. by the end of the 2013–14 school year).
# AYP must be primarily based on state assessments, but must also include one additional academic indicator.
# The AYP objectives must be assessed at the school level. Schools that failed to meet their AYP objective for two consecutive years are identified for improvement.
# School AYP results must be reported separately for each group of students identified above so that it can be determined whether each student group met the AYP objective.
# At least 95% of each group must participate in state assessments.
# States may aggregate up to three years of data in making AYP determinations.

The act requires states to provide "[[Highly Qualified Teachers|highly qualified]]" teachers to all students. Each state sets its own standards for what counts as "highly qualified." Similarly, the act requires states to set "one high, challenging standard" for its students. Each state decides for itself what counts as "one high, challenging standard," but the curriculum standards must be applied to all students, rather than having different standards for students in different cities or other parts of the state.

The act also requires schools to let military recruiters have students' contact information and other access to the student, if the school provides that information to universities or employers, unless the students opt out of giving military recruiters access. This portion of the law has drawn lots of criticism and has even led to political resistance. For instance, in 2003 in [[Santa Cruz, California]], student-led efforts forced school districts to create an "opt-in" policy that required students affirm they wanted the military to have their information. This successful student organizing effort was copied in various other cities throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2003/04/23/32recruit.h22.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on teachers, schools, and school districts==

===Increased accountability===
Supporters of the NCLB claim one of the strong positive points of the bill is the increased accountability that is required of schools and teachers. According to the legislation, schools must pass yearly tests that judge student improvement over the fiscal year. These yearly standardized tests are the main means of determining whether schools live up to required standards. If required improvements are not made, the schools face decreased funding and other punishments that contribute to the increased accountability. According to supporters, these goals help teachers and schools realize the significance and importance of the educational system and how it affects the nation. Opponents of this law say that the punishments only hurt the schools and do not contribute to the improvement of student education.

In addition to and in support of the above points, proponents claim that No Child Left Behind:
* Links state academic content standards with student outcomes
* Measures student performance: a student's progress in reading and math must be measured annually in grades 3 through 8 and at least once during high school via [[standardized test]]s
* Provides information for parents by requiring states and school districts to give parents detailed report cards on schools and districts explaining the school's AYP performance; schools must inform parents when their child is taught by a teacher or para-professional who does not meet "highly qualified" requirements
* Establishes the foundation for schools and school districts to significantly enhance parental involvement and improved administration through the use of the assessment data to drive decisions on instruction, curriculum and business practices

The commonwealth of Pennsylvania has proposed tying teacher's salaries to test scores.  If a district's students do poorly, the state cuts the district's budget the following year and the teachers get a pay cut. Critics point out that if a school does poorly, reducing its budget and cutting teacher salaries will likely hamper the school's ability to improve.

===School choice===
* Gives options to students enrolled in schools failing to meet AYP. If a school fails to meet AYP targets two or more years running, the school must offer eligible children the chance to transfer to higher-performing local schools, receive free tutoring, or attend after-school programs.
* Gives school districts the opportunity to demonstrate proficiency, even for subgroups that do not meet State Minimum Achievement standards, through a process called "safe harbor," a precursor to growth-based or [[value-added modeling|value-added assessments]].

===Narrow definition of research===
The act requires schools to rely on [[scientifically based research]] for programs and teaching methods.  The act defines this as "research that involves the application of rigorous, systematic, and objective procedures to obtain reliable and valid knowledge relevant to education activities and programs." Scientifically based research results in "replicable and applicable findings" from research that used appropriate methods to generate persuasive, empirical conclusions.&lt;ref name=Beghetto&gt;Beghetto, R. (2003) [http://www.ericdigests.org/2003-5/based.htm Scientifically Based Research.] ERIC Clearinghouse on Educational Management. Retrieved June 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality and distribution of teachers===
Prior to the NCLB act, new teachers were typically required to have a bachelor's degree, be fully certified, and demonstrate subject matter knowledge—generally through tests. It is widely accepted&lt;ref&gt;Citation needed&lt;/ref&gt; that teacher knowledge has two components: specific subject matter knowledge (CK) such as an understanding of mathematics for a mathematics teacher, and pedagogical knowledge (PCK), which is knowledge of the subject of teaching/learning itself. Both types of knowledge, as well as experience in guided student teaching, help form the qualities needed by effective teachers.

Under NCLB, existing teachers—including those with tenure—were also supposed to meet standards. They could meet the same requirements set for new teachers or could meet a state-determined "...high, objective, uniform state standard of evaluation," aka HOUSSE. Downfall of the quality requirements of the NCLB legislation have received little research attention, in part because state rules require few changes from pre-existing practice. There is also little evidence that the rules have altered trends in observable teacher traits.&lt;ref name="American Economic Assosiation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanushek|first=Eric A.|author2=Steven G. Rivkin |title=The Quality and Distribution of Teachers under the No Child Left Behind Act|journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=24|date= Summer 2010|issue=3|pages=133–50|jstor=20799159|doi=10.1257/jep.24.3.133|url=https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.24.3.133}}&lt;/ref&gt; For years, American educators have been struggling to identify those teacher traits that are important contributors to student achievement. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what traits are most important and most education policy experts agree that further research is required.

==Effects on student assessment==
Several analyses of state accountability systems that were in place before NCLB indicate that outcomes accountability led to faster growth in achievement for the states that introduced such systems.&lt;ref&gt;See the analyses of NAEP results in Martin Carnoy and Susanna Loeb, "Does external accountability affect student outcomes? A cross-state analysis," ''Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis'' 24, no. 4 (Winter 2002): 305–31, and [[Eric Hanushek|Eric A. Hanushek]] and Margaret E. Raymond, "Does school accountability lead to improved student performance?" ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'' 24, no. 2 (Spring 2005): 297–327.&lt;/ref&gt;  The direct analysis of state test scores before and after enactment of NCLB also supports its positive impact.&lt;ref&gt;Center on Education Policy, ''Answering the Question That Matters Most: Has Student Achievement Increased Since No Child Left Behind?''  Washington:  Center on Education Policy, June 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; A primary criticism asserts that NCLB reduces effective instruction and student learning by causing states to lower achievement goals and motivate teachers to "teach to the test."  A primary supportive claim asserts that systematic testing provides data that shed light on which schools don't teach basic skills effectively, so that interventions can be made to improve outcomes for all students while reducing the achievement gap for disadvantaged and disabled students.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/schools/nochild/ List of articles regarding NCLB debate]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Improved test scores==
The Department of Education points to the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] (NAEP) results, released in July 2005, showing improved student achievement in reading and math:&lt;ref&gt;(2006) [http://www.ed.gov/nclb/overview/importance/nclbworking.html No Child Left Behind Act Is Working] Department of Education. Retrieved 6/7/07.&lt;/ref&gt;
* More progress was made by nine-year-olds in reading in the last five years than in the previous 28 years combined.
* America's nine-year-olds posted the best scores in reading (since 1971) and math  (since 1973) in the history of the report. America's 13-year-olds earned the highest math scores the test ever recorded.
* Reading and math scores for [[African American|black]] and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] nine-year-olds reached an all-time high.
* Achievement gaps in reading and math between white and black nine-year-olds and between white and Hispanic nine-year-olds are at an all-time low.
* Forty-three states and the District of Columbia either improved academically or held steady in all categories (fourth- and eighth-grade reading and fourth- and eighth-grade math).

These statistics compare 2005 with 2000 though No Child Left Behind did not even take effect until 2003. Critics point out that the increase in scores between 2000 and 2005 was roughly the same as the increase between 2003 and 2005, which calls into question how any increase can be attributed to No Child Left Behind. They also argue that some of the subgroups are [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry-picked]]—that in other subgroups scores remained the same or fell.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Perlstein, ''Tested''&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the makers of the standardized tests have been blamed for making the tests easier so that it is easier for schools to sufficiently improve.

Education researchers Thomas Dee and Brian Jacob argue that NCLB showed statistically significant positive impact on students' performance on 4th-grade math exams (equal to two-thirds of a year's worth of growth), smaller and statistically insignificant improvements in 8th-grade math exam performance, and no discernible improvement in reading performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|url=http://educationnext.org/evaluating-nclb/|title=Evaluating No Child Left Behind|first1=Thomas|last1=Dee|first2=Brian|last2=Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms of standardized testing===
Critics argue that the focus on [[standardized test]]ing (all students in a state take the same test under the same conditions) encourages teachers to teach a narrow subset of skills that the school believes increases [[Test preparation|test performance]], rather than achieve in-depth understanding of the overall curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.reading.org/resources/issues/positions_high_stakes.html High-Stakes Assessments in Reading] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827061209/http://www.reading.org/resources/issues/positions_high_stakes.html |date=2006-08-27 }}. International Reading Association. Retrieved June 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a teacher who knows that all questions on a math test are simple addition problems (e.g., What is 2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3?) might not invest any class time on the practical applications of addition, to leave more time for the material the test assesses. This is colloquially referred to as "[[teaching to the test]]."  "Teaching to the test" has been observed to raise test scores, though not as much as other teaching techniques.&lt;ref name=MET&gt;{{cite journal

Many teachers who practice "teaching to the test" misinterpret the educational outcomes the tests are designed to measure. On two state tests, [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Michigan]], and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) almost two-thirds of eighth graders missed math word problems that required an application of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] to calculate the distance between two points.&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins, G. &amp; McTighe, J. (2005). Understanding by design, 2nd Edition. ASCD. {{ISBN|978-1-4166-0035-0}}. pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt;  The teachers correctly anticipated the content of the tests, but incorrectly assumed each test would present simplistic items rather than higher-order items.

Another problem is that outside influences often affect student performance.  Students who struggle to take tests may perform well using another method of learning such as project-based learning.  Sometimes, factors such as home life can affect test performance.  Basing performance on one test inaccurately measures student success overall.  No Child Left behind has failed to account for all these factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/no-child-has-failed/2015/02/13/8d619026-b2f8-11e4-827f-93f454140e2b_story.html|title=‘No Child’ has failed|last=Eskelsen García|first=Lily|last2=Thornton|first2=Otha|date=February 13, 2015|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=September 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Those opposed to the use of testing to determine educational achievement prefer alternatives such as subjective teacher opinions, classwork, and [[Educational assessment|performance-based assessments]].&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.fairtest.org/facts/whatwron.htm What's Wrong With Standardized Testing?] FairTest.org. Retrieved June 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under No Child Left Behind, schools were held almost exclusively accountable for absolute levels of student performance.  But that meant that even schools that were making great strides with students were still labeled as "failing" just because the students had not yet made it all the way to a "proficient" level of achievement.  Since 2005, the U.S. Department of Education has approved 15 states to implement growth model pilots.  Each state adopted one of four distinct growth models: Trajectory, Transition Tables, Student Growth Percentiles, and Projection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carey|first=Kevin|title=Growth Models and Accountability: A Recipe for Remaking ESEA|journal=Education Sector|date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incentives for improvement also may cause states to lower their official standards. Because each state can produce its own standardized tests, a state can make its statewide tests easier to increase scores.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://ed.sc.gov/news/more.cfm?articleID=385 New study confirms vast differences in state goals for academic ‘proficiency’ under NCLB].

==Intended effects on curriculum and standards==

===Improvement over local standards===
Many argue that local government had failed students, necessitating federal intervention to remedy issues like teachers teaching outside their areas of expertise, and complacency in the face of continually failing schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mizell, H|year=2003|url=http://www.middleweb.com/HMnclb.html|title=NCLB: Conspiracy, Compliance, or Creativity?|accessdate=2007-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713071731/http://www.middleweb.com/HMnclb.html|archive-date=2007-07-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some local governments, notably that of New York state, have supported NCLB provisions, because local standards failed to provide adequate oversight over special education, and NCLB would let them use longitudinal data more effectively to monitor [[Adequate Yearly Progress]] (AYP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oms.nysed.gov/legcoord/fedleg05/body.html#no%20child|title=Federal Legislation and Education in New York State 2005: No Child Left Behind Act|year=2005|publisher=New York State Education Agency|accessdate=2007-06-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509143713/http://www.oms.nysed.gov/legcoord/fedleg05/body.html#no%20child|archivedate=2007-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; States all over the United States have shown improvements in their progress as an apparent result of NCLB. For example, Wisconsin ranks first of all fifty states plus the District of Columbia, with ninety-eight percent of its schools achieving No Child Left Behind standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/vote2008/state.php?state=WI |title=NPR and Newshour 2008 Election Map: More about Wisconsin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality of education===
* Increases the quality of education by requiring schools to improve their performance
* Improves quality of instruction by requiring schools to implement "scientifically based research" practices in the classroom, parent involvement programs, and professional development activities for those students that are not encouraged or expected to attend college.
* Supports early literacy through the Early Reading First initiative.
* Emphasizes reading, language arts, mathematics and science achievement as "core academic subjects."&lt;ref name="test"&gt;United States. Public Law 107-110. 107th Congress, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
Student performance in other subjects (besides reading and math) will be measured as a part of overall progress.

===Effect on arts and electives===
NCLB’s main focus is on skills in reading, writing, and mathematics, which are areas related to economic success.  Combined with the budget crises in the [[late-2000s recession]], some schools have cut or eliminated classes and resources for many subject areas that are not part of NCLB's accountability standards.&lt;ref&gt;Beveridge, T. (2010). No Child Left Behind and Fine Arts Classes. Arts Education Policy Review, 111(1), 4–7. {{doi|10.1080/10632910903228090}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2007, almost 71% of schools have reduced instruction time in subjects such as history, arts, language, and music to provide more time and resources to mathematics and English.&lt;ref&gt;Grey, A. (2010). No Child Left Behind in Art Education Policy: A Review of Key Recommendations for Arts Language Revisions.

In some schools, the classes remain available, but individual students who are not proficient in basic skills are sent to [[remedial education|remedial]] reading or mathematics classes rather than arts, sports, or other optional subjects.

According to Paul Reville, the author of "Stop Narrowing of the Curriculum By Right-Sizing School Time," teachers are learning that students need more time to excel in the "needed" subjects. The students need more time to achieve the basic goals that should come by somewhat relevant to a student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reville|first=Paul|title=Stop the Narrowing of the Curriculum By ‘Right-Sizing’ School Time|journal=Education Week 24|date=October 2007|issue=Academic Search Premier. EBSCO.Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Physical Education]], on the other hand, is one of the subjects least affected.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Jennings and Diane Stark Rentner, Ten Big Effects of the No Child Left Behind Act on Public Schools,  Phi Delta Kappan, Vol. 88, No. 02, October 2006, pp. 110–13&lt;/ref&gt; Some might find this confusing because like many electives and non-core classes, No Child Left Behind does not address Physical Education directly.&lt;ref&gt;Kathy Speregen, "Physical Education in America's Public Schools" UMich.edu&lt;/ref&gt; Two reasons why Physical Education is not adversely affected include the obesity crisis in the United States that the federal government is trying to reverse through programs like First Lady Michelle Obama's ''Let's Move Campaign,'' which among other things, looks to improve the quantity and quality of physical education.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Williams1, Mark B. McClellan and Alice M. Rivlin, "Beyond The Affordable Care Act: Achieving Real Improvements In Americans’ Health" Health Affairs August 2010 29: 81481–88&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, there is research, including a 2005 study by Dr. Charles H. Hillmam of The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign that concludes that fitness is globally related to academic achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman et al. 2005; CDE, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The opportunities, challenges, and risks that No Child Left Behind poses for science education in elementary and middle schools—worldwide competition insists on rapidly improving science education. Adding science assessments to the NCLB requirements may ultimately result in science being taught in more elementary schools and by more teachers than ever before. 2/3 of elementary school teachers indicated that they were not familiar with national science standards. Most concern circulates around the result that, consuming too much time for language arts and mathematics may limit children's experience—and curiosity and interest—in sciences.&lt;ref name="The University of Chicago Press"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marx|first=Ronald W.|author2=Christopher J.

===Limitations on local control===
Both U.S. [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and [[American liberalism|liberal]] critics have argued that NCLB's new standards in federalizing education set a negative precedent for further erosion of [[States' rights|state]] and local control. [[Libertarianism|Libertarians]] further argue that the federal government has no [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] authority in education, which is why participation in NCLB is technically optional. They believe that states need not comply with NCLB so long as they forgo the federal funding that comes with it.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, R.

==Effects on school and students==

===Gifted students===
NCLB pressures schools to guarantee that nearly all students meet the minimum skill levels (set by each state) in reading, writing, and arithmetic—but requires nothing beyond these minima. It provides no incentives to improve student achievement beyond the bare minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/no-child-left-behind-overview-definition-summary.html|title=No Child Left Behind Overview: Definitions, Requirements, Criticisms, and More|last=Klein|first=Alyson|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs not essential for achieving mandated minimum skills are neglected or canceled by those districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education-k-12/news/2013/04/08/59542/5-ways-no-child-left-behind-waivers-help-state-education-reform/|title=5 Ways No Child Left Behind Waivers Help State Education Reform  - Center for American Progress|date=2013-04-08|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, NCLB does not require any programs for gifted, talented, and other high-performing students.&lt;ref name=Cloud&gt;Cloud, John.

Research tells us an IQ of 120 is needed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In other states, such as [[Michigan]], state funding for gifted and talented programs was cut by up to 90% in the year after the Act became law.&lt;ref name=Cloud /&gt;

===Unrealistic goals===
"There's a fallacy in the law and everybody knows it," said Alabama State Superintendent Joe Morton on Wednesday, August 11, 2010. According to the No Child Left Behind Act, by 2014, every child is supposed to test on grade level in reading and math. "That can't happen," said Morton. "You have too many variables and you have too many scenarios, and everybody knows that would never happen." Alabama State Board Member Mary Jane Caylor said, "I don't think that No Child Left Behind has benefited this state." She argued the goal of 100 percent proficiency is unattainable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.al.com/breaking/2010/08/times_watchdog_report_no_child.html Times Watchdog Report: No Child Left Behind on the way out, but not anytime soon].

===Gaming the system===
{{See also|Gaming the system}}
The system of incentives and penalties sets up a strong motivation for schools, districts, and states to manipulate test results. For example, schools have been shown to employ "creative reclassification" of [[high school dropouts]] (to reduce unfavorable statistics).&lt;ref&gt;(2004) [http://www.factcheck.org/article181.html Bush Education Ad: Going Positive, Selectively] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107021306/http://www.factcheck.org/article181.html |date=2008-01-07 }}. FactCheck.org. Retrieved June 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at [[Sharpstown High School]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], more than 1,000 students began high school as freshmen, and four years later, fewer than 300 students were enrolled in the senior class.  However, none of these "missing" students from Sharpstown High were reported as dropouts.&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meier and Woods|first=D. and G.|year=2004|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=0-8070-0459-6|page=36|title = Many Children Left Behind: How the No Child Left Behind Act Is Damaging Our Children and Our Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variability in student potential and 100% compliance===
The act is promoted as requiring 100% of students (including disadvantaged and [[special education]] students) within a school to reach the same state standards in reading and mathematics by 2014; detractors charge that a 100% goal is unattainable, and critics of the NCLB requirement for "one high, challenging standard" claim that some students are simply unable to perform at the given level for their age, no matter how effective the teacher is.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edaccountability.org/ EdAccountability.org] website.&lt;/ref&gt; While statewide standards reduce the [[educational inequality]] between privileged and underprivileged districts in a state, they still impose a "one size fits all" standard on individual students. Particularly in states with high standards, schools can be punished for not being able to dramatically raise the achievement of students that may have below-average capabilities{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

In fact, the "all" in NCLB means only 95% of students, because states must report the assessment scores of 95% of students when calculating [[Adequate Yearly Progress]] (AYP) scores.&lt;ref name="Wrightslaw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrightslaw.com/heath/nclb.support.htm |title=Doing Your Homework: Answering Questions about Support for NCLB by Sue Heath – Wrightslaw |accessdate=2008-03-06 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students who have an [[Individualized Education Program|Individual Education Plan]] (IEP) and who are assessed must receive the accommodations specified in the IEP during assessment; if these accommodations do not change the nature of the [[Educational assessment|assessment]], then these students' scores are counted the same as any other student's score.  Common acceptable changes include extended test time, testing in a quieter room, translation of math problems into the student's native language, or allowing a student to type answers instead of writing them by hand.

Simply being classified as having [[special education]] needs does not automatically exempt students from assessment.  Most students with mild disabilities or physical disabilities take the same test as non-disabled students.

In addition to not requiring 5% of students to be assessed at all, regulations let schools use alternate assessments to declare up to 1% of all students proficient for the purposes of the Act.&lt;ref name="titleVDOE :: No Child Left Behind – NCLB, Understanding AYP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doe.virginia.gov/VDOE/src/vps-accountability.shtml |title=VDOE :: No Child Left Behind – NCLB, Understanding AYP |accessdate=2008-03-06 |work= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080211145310/http://www.doe.virginia.gov/VDOE/src/vps-accountability.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  States are given broad discretion in selecting alternate assessments.  For example, a school may accept an [[Advanced Placement]] test for English in lieu of the English test written by the state, and simplified tests for students with significant cognitive disabilities.  The Virginia Alternate Assessment Program (VAAP) and Virginia Grade Level Alternative (VGLA) options, for example, are [[portfolio assessment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doe.virginia.gov/VDOE/srv/terminology.shtml "Terminology" Virginia Department of Education website]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations that support NCLB assessment of disabled or limited English proficient (LEP) students say that [[inclusion (education)|inclusion]] ensures that deficiencies in the education of these disadvantaged students are identified and addressed.  Opponents say that testing students with disabilities violates the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) by making students with disabilities learn the same material as non-disabled students.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Liz.

===Children with disabilities===
NCLB includes incentives to reward schools showing progress for students with disabilities and other measures to fix or provide students with alternative options than schools not meeting the needs of the disabled population.&lt;ref&gt;[[No Child Left Behind Act#Provisions of the act]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The law is written so that the scores of students with IEPs (Individualized Education Plans) and 504 plans are counted just as other students' scores are counted.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Schools have argued against having disabled populations involved in their AYP measurements because they claim that there are too many variables involved.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Aligning the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act===
Stemming from the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] (EAHCA) of 1975, the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) was enacted in its first form in 1997, and then reenacted with new education aspects in 2006 (although still referred to as [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|IDEA 2004]]). It kept the EAHCA requirements of free and accessible education for all children.  The 2004 IDEA authorized formula grants to states and discretionary grants for research, technology, and training.  It also required schools to use research-based interventions to assist students with disabilities.

The amount of funding each school would receive from its "Local Education Agency" for each year would be divided by the number of children with disabilities and multiplied by the number of students with disabilities participating in the schoolwide programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idea.ed.gov/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cdynamic%2CTopicalBrief%2C11%2C |title=Building The Legacy of IDEA 2004 |publisher=Idea.ed.gov |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act#Alignment with No Child Left Behind]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly since 2004, policymakers have sought to align IDEA with NCLB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/policy/speced/guid/idea/tb-nclb-align.pdf|title=Reauthorized Statute Alignment With the No Child Left Behind Act|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=IDEA|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most obvious points of alignment include the shared requirements for [[Highly Qualified Teachers]], for establishment of goals for students with special needs,  and for assessment levels for these students. In 2004, George Bush signed provisions that would define for both of these acts what was considered a "highly qualified teacher."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idea.ed.gov/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cdynamic%2CTopicalBrief%2C3%2C |title=Building The Legacy of IDEA 2004 |publisher=Idea.ed.gov |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive effects for students with disabilities===
The [[National Council on Disability]] (NCD) looks at how NCLB and IDEA are improving outcomes for students with Down syndrome.  The effects they investigate include reducing the number of students who drop out, increasing graduation rates, and effective strategies to transition students to post-secondary education.  Their studies have reported that NCLB and IDEA have changed the attitudes and expectations for students with disabilities. They are pleased that students are finally included in state assessment and accountability systems. NCLB made assessments be taken "seriously," they found, as now assessments and accommodations are under review by administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.aypf.org/publications/NCLB-Disabilities.pdf|title=No Child Left Behind: Improving Educational Outcomes for Students with Disabilities|last=American Youth Policy Forum|first=|last2=Educational Policy Institute|publisher=National Council on Disability|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=7–8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another organization that found positive correlations between NCLB and IDEA was the National Center on Educational Outcomes.  It published a brochure for parents of students with disabilities about how the two (NCLB &amp; IDEA) work well together because they "provide both individualized instruction and school accountability for students and disabilities."  They specifically highlight the new focus on "shared responsibility of general and special education teachers," forcing schools to have disabled students more on their radar." They do acknowledge, however, that for each student to "participate in the general curriculum [of high standards for all students] and make progress toward proficiency," additional time and effort for coordination are needed.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 10–12, http://www.cehd.umn.edu/nceo/onlinepubs/parents.pdf, "NCLB and IDEA: What parents need to know and do"&lt;/ref&gt;  The National Center on Educational Outcomes reported that now disabled students will receive "...the academic attention and resources they deserved."&lt;ref&gt;p. 20, http://www.cehd.umn.edu/nceo/onlinepubs/parents.pdf, "NCLB and IDEA: What parents need to know and do"&lt;/ref&gt;

Particular research has been done on how the laws impact students who are [[deaf]] or hard of hearing. First, the legislation makes schools responsible for how students with disabilities score—emphasizing "...student outcomes instead of placement."&lt;ref&gt;pp. 480–81, "Policies for Students Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing Hidden Benefits and Unintended Consequences of No Child Left Behind," http://aer.sagepub.com/content/44/3/460.full.pdf+html&lt;/ref&gt;  It also puts the public’s eye on how outside programs can be utilized to improve outcomes for this underserved population, and has thus prompted more research on the effectiveness of certain in- and out-of-school interventions.  For example, NCLB requirements have made researchers begin to study the effects of read aloud or interpreters on both reading and mathematics assessments, and on having students sign responses that are then recorded by a scribe.

Still, research thus far on the positive effects of NCLB/IDEA is limited.  It has been aimed at young students in an attempt to find strategies to help them learn to read.  Evaluations also have included a limited number of students, which make it very difficult to draw conclusions to a broader group.  Evaluations also focus only on one type of disabilities.

===Negative effects for students with disabilities===
The National Council for Disabilities had reservations about how the regulations of NCLB fit with those of IDEA.  One concern is how schools can effectively intervene and develop strategies when NCLB calls for group accountability rather than individual student attention.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5, "No Child Left Behind:Improving Educational Outcomes for Students with Disabilities" http://www.aypf.org/publications/NCLB-Disabilities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Individual nature of IDEA is "inconsistent with the group nature of NCLB."&lt;ref&gt;p. 23, "No Child Left Behind:Improving Educational Outcomes for Students with Disabilities" http://www.aypf.org/publications/NCLB-Disabilities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They worry that NCLB focuses too much on standardized testing and not enough on the work-based experience necessary for obtaining jobs in the future.  Also, NCLB is measured essentially by a single test score, but IDEA calls for various measures of student success.

IDEA's focus on various measures stems from its foundation in Individualized Education Plans for students with disabilities (IEP). An IEP is designed to give students with disabilities individual goals that are often not on their grade level. An IEP is intended for "developing goals and objectives that correspond to the needs of the student, and ultimately choosing a placement in the least restrictive environment possible for the student."&lt;ref&gt;[[Individualized Education Program]]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the IEP, students could be able to legally have lowered success criteria for academic success.

A 2006 report by the Center for Evaluation and Education Policy (CEEP) and the Indiana Institute on Disability and Community indicated that most states were not making AYP because of special education subgroups even though progress had been made toward that end.  This was in effect pushing schools to cancel the inclusion model and keep special education students separate. "IDEA calls for individualized curriculum and assessments that determine success based on growth and improvement each year. NCLB, in contrast, measures all students by the same markers, which are based not on individual improvement but by proficiency in math and reading," the study states.&lt;ref&gt;Education Policy Brief, Closing the Achievement Gap Series: Part III, "What is the Impact of NCLB on the Inclusion of Students with Disabilities?"
Cassandra Cole, http://www.ceep.indiana.edu/projects/PDF/PB_V4N11_Fall_2006_NCLB_dis.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425124129/http://www.ceep.indiana.edu/projects/PDF/PB_V4N11_Fall_2006_NCLB_dis.pdf |date=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When interviewed with the Indiana University Newsroom, author of the CEEP report Sandi Cole said, "The system needs to make sense. Don't we want to know how much a child is progressing towards the standards?...We need a system that values learning and growth over time, in addition to helping students reach high standards."&lt;ref&gt;Cassandro Cole, Interview w/ Newsroom Indiana University, http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/4379.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Cole found in her survey that NCLB encourages teachers to teach to the test, limiting curriculum choices/options, and to use the special education students as a "scapegoat" for their school not making AYP.  In addition, Indiana administrators who responded to the survey indicated that NCLB testing has led to higher numbers of students with disabilities dropping out of school.

Legal journals have also commented on the incompatibility of IDEA and NCLB; some say the acts may never be reconciled with one another.&lt;ref&gt;The Impact of No Child Left Behind on IDEA’s Guarantee of Free, Appropriate Public Education for Students with Disabilities: A Critical Review of Recent Case Law, http://www.luc.edu/law/academics/special/center/child/childed_forum/pdfs/2009_student_papers/kraus_impact_no_child.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130163302/http://www.luc.edu/law/academics/special/center/child/childed_forum/pdfs/2009_student_papers/kraus_impact_no_child.pdf |date=2012-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They point out that an IEP is designed specifically for individual student achievement, which gives the rights to parents to ensure that the schools are following the necessary protocols of Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE). They worry that not enough emphasis is being placed on the child's IEP with this setup. In Board of Education for Ottawa Township High School District 140 v. Spelling, two Illinois school districts and parents of disabled students challenged the legality of NCLB’s testing requirements in light of IDEA’s mandate to provide students with individualized education.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5, The Impact of No Child Left Behind on IDEA’s Guarantee of Free, Appropriate Public Education for Students with Disabilities: A Critical Review of Recent Case Law, http://www.luc.edu/law/academics/special/center/child/childed_forum/pdfs/2009_student_papers/kraus_impact_no_child.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130163302/http://www.luc.edu/law/academics/special/center/child/childed_forum/pdfs/2009_student_papers/kraus_impact_no_child.pdf |date=2012-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although students there were aligned with "proficiency" to state standards, students did not meet requirements of their IEP.  Their parents feared that students were not given right to FAPE.  The case questioned which better indicated progress: standardized test measures, or IEP measures?  It concluded that since some students may never test on grade level, all students with disabilities should be given more options and accommodations with standardized testing than they currently receive.

==Effects on racial and ethnic minority students==

===Attention to minority populations===
* Seeks to narrow the class and [[racial achievement gap in the United States]] by creating common expectations for all. NCLB has shown mixed success in eliminating the racial achievement gap. Although test scores are improving, they are not improving equally for all races, which means that minority students are still behind.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}
* Requires schools and districts to focus their attention on the academic achievement of traditionally under-served groups of children, such as low-income students, students with disabilities, and students of "major racial and ethnic subgroups".&lt;ref name="titleCharting the Course: States Decide Major Provisions Under No Child Left Behind"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2004/01/01142004.html#elements |title=Charting the Course: States Decide Major Provisions Under No Child Left Behind |accessdate=2008-04-09 |publisher=U.S. Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each state is responsible for defining major racial and ethnic subgroups itself.&lt;ref name="titleCharting the Course: States Decide Major Provisions Under No Child Left Behind"/&gt;  Many previous state-created systems of accountability measured only average school performance—so schools could be highly rated even if they had large achievement gaps between affluent and disadvantaged students.

===State refusal to produce non-English assessments===
All students who are learning English would have an automatic three-year window to take assessments in their native language, after which they must normally demonstrate proficiency on an English-language assessment. However, the local education authority may grant an exception to any individual English learner for another two years' testing in his or her native language on a case-by-case basis.

In practice, however, only 10 states choose to test any English language learners in their native language (almost entirely Spanish speakers).&lt;!-- dead ref: http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2006/03/01/25ell.h25.html --&gt; The vast majority of English language learners are given English language assessments.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, J. (nd) [http://www.nabe.org/Resources/Documents/NCLB%20page/NABE_on_NCLB.pdf No Child Left Behind: Misguided Approach to School Accountability for English Language Learners] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408184000/http://www.nabe.org/Resources/Documents/NCLB%20page/NABE_on_NCLB.pdf |date=2013-04-08 }}. National Association for Bilingual Education. Retrieved June 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many schools test or assess students with limited English proficiency even when the students are exempt from NCLB-mandated reporting, because the tests may provide useful information to the teacher and school.  In certain schools with large immigrant populations, this exemption comprises a majority of young students.

NCLB testing under-reports learning at non-English-language immersion schools, particularly those that immerse students in Native American languages.  NCLB requires some Native American students to take standardized tests in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/native-american-languages-act-twenty-years-later-has-it-made-difference |title=Native American Languages Act: Twenty Years Later, Has It Made a Difference? |publisher=Cultural Survival |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases, the students could be legally tested in their native language, except that the state has not paid to have the test translated.

===Demographic study of AYP failure rates and requirement for failing schools===
One study found that schools in California and Illinois that have not met AYP serve 75–85% minority students while schools meeting AYP have less than 40% minority students.&lt;ref&gt;Owens, A., &amp; Sunderman, G. L. (2006). ''School Accountability under NCLB: Aid or Obstacle for Measuring Racial Equity?'' Cambridge, MA: Civil Rights Project at Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt;  Schools that do not meet AYP are required to offer their students' parents the opportunity to transfer their students to a non-failing school within the district, but it is not required that the other school accepts the student.&lt;ref name="Knaus, Christopher 2007"&gt;Knaus, Christopher. (2007). [http://www.berkeleyrep.org/school/images/Knaus.pdf ''Still Segregated Still Unequal: Analyzing the Impact of No Child Left Behind on African American Students'']. University of California, Berkeley: National Urban League.&lt;/ref&gt; NCLB controls the portion of federal Title I funding based upon each school meeting annual set standards.  Any participating school that does not make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) for two years must offer parents the choice to send their child to a non-failing school in the district, and after three years, must provide supplemental services, such as free tutoring or after-school assistance. After five years of not meeting AYP, the school must make dramatic changes to how the school is run, which could entail state-takeover.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education: The Condition of Education 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
As part of their support for NCLB, the administration and Congress backed massive increases in funding for elementary and secondary education.  Total federal education funding increased from $42.2 billion to $55.7 billion from 2001, the fiscal year before the law's passage, to fiscal year 2004.&lt;ref name="ed.gov"&gt;U.S. Department of Education, Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Proposal [http://www.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget09/summary/edlite-section1.html].&lt;/ref&gt; A new $1 billion Reading First program was created, distributing funds to local schools to improve the teaching of reading, and over $100 million for its companion, Early Reading First.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget05/summary/edlite-section1.html U.S. Department of Education, Fiscal Year 2005 Budget Proposal]&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other formula programs received large increases as well.  This was consistent with the administration's position of funding formula programs, which distribute money to local schools for their use, and grant programs, where particular schools or groups apply directly to the federal government for funding. In total, federal funding for education increased 59.8% from 2000 to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ed.gov/nclb/overview/intro/index.htm |title=Archived:Introduction: No Child Left Behind |publisher=US Department of Education |accessdate=2009-02-23 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The act created a new competitive-grant program called Reading First, funded at $1.02 billion in 2004, to help states and districts set up "scientific, research-based" reading programs for children in grades K–3 (with priority given to high-poverty areas). A smaller early-reading program sought to help states better prepare 3- to 5-year-olds in disadvantaged areas to read. The program's funding was later cut drastically by Congress amid budget talks.&lt;ref name="edweek.org"&gt;{{cite web|title = No Child Left Behind: An Overview|url = http://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/no-child-left-behind-overview-definition-summary.html|publisher = Education Week|accessdate = 29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding Changes: Through an alteration in the Title I funding formula, the No Child Left Behind Act was expected to better target resources to school districts with high concentrations of poor children. The law also included provisions intended to give states and districts greater flexibility in how they spent a portion of their federal allotments.&lt;ref name="edweek.org"/&gt;

Funding for school technology used in classrooms as part of NCLB is administered by the Enhancing Education Through Technology Program (EETT). Funding sources are used for equipment, professional development and training for educators, and updated research.  EETT allocates funds by formula to states. The states, in turn, reallocate 50% of the funds to local districts by Title I formula and 50% competitively. While districts must reserve a minimum of 25% of all EETT funds for professional development, recent studies indicate that most EETT recipients use far more than 25% of their EETT funds to train teachers to use technology and integrate it into their curricula. In fact, EETT recipients committed more than $159 million in EETT funds towards professional development during the 2004–05 school year alone.  Moreover, even though EETT recipients are afforded broad discretion in their use of EETT funds, surveys show that they target EETT dollars towards improving student achievement in reading and mathematics, engaging in data-driven decision making, and launching online assessment programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In addition, the provisions of NCLB permitted increased flexibility for state and local agencies in the use of federal education money.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCLB increases were companions to another massive increase in federal education funding at that time.  The Bush administration and congress passed very large increases in funding for the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) at the same time as the NCLB increases.  IDEA Part B, a state formula-funding program that distributes money to local districts for the education of students with disabilities, was increased from $6.3 billion in 2001 to $10.1 billion in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget07/summary/edlite-section1.html U.S. Department of Education, Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Proposal]&lt;/ref&gt; Because a district's and state's performance on NCLB measures depended on improved performance by students with disabilities, particularly, students with learning disabilities, this 60 percent increase in funding was also an important part of the overall approach to NCLB implementation.

===Criticisms of funding levels===
Some critics claim that extra expenses are not fully reimbursed by increased levels of federal NCLB funding. Others note that funding for the law increased massively following passage&lt;ref name="Education 2006"&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/about/overview/fed/10facts/edlite-chart.html#5 U.S. Department of Education, Elementary and Secondary Education Act Budget Table]. 2006. 7 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and that billions in funds previously allocated to particular uses could be reallocated to new uses.  Even before the law's passage, Secretary of Education Rod Paige noted ensuring that children are educated remained a state responsibility regardless of federal support:
{{quote|Washington is willing to help [with the additional costs of federal requirements], as we've helped before, even before we [proposed NCLB]. But this is a part of the teaching responsibility that each state has. ... Washington has offered some assistance now. In the legislation, we have ... some support to pay for the development of tests. But even if that should be looked at as a gift, it is the state responsibility to do this.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/schools/interviews/paige.html|title= Frontline. Testing Our Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Various early Democratic supporters of NCLB criticize its implementation, claiming it is not adequately funded by either the federal government or the states. [[Ted Kennedy]], the legislation's initial sponsor, once stated: "The tragedy is that these long overdue reforms are finally in place, but the funds are not."&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.amconmag.com/2005_08_01/article.html Leaving No Child Left Behind: States charged with implementing Bush’s national education plan balk at the cost of compliance.] ''The American Conservative.'' Retrieved 6/7/07.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan B. Neuman]], U.S. Department of Education's former Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education, commented about her worries of NCLB in a meeting of the [[International Reading Association]]:
{{quote|In [the most disadvantaged schools] in America, even the most earnest teacher has often given up because they lack every available resource that could possibly make a difference. ... When we say all children can achieve and then not give them the additional resources ... we are creating a fantasy.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/article181.html|title=Bush Education Ad: Going Positive, Selectively|publisher=[[FactCheck]]|year=2004|accessdate=2007-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107021306/http://www.factcheck.org/article181.html|archive-date=2008-01-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Organizations have particularly criticized the unwillingness of the federal government to "fully fund" the act. Noting that [[United States House of Representatives#Legislative functions|appropriations bills always originate in the House of Representatives]], it is true that during the Bush Administration, neither the Senate nor the White House has even requested federal funding up to the authorized levels for several of the act’s main provisions. For example, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] requested only $13.3 billion of a possible $22.75 billion in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.aft.org/topics/nclb/funding.htm Funding] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019125537/http://www.aft.org/topics/nclb/funding.htm |date=2006-10-19 }}. American Federation of Teachers. Retrieved 6/7/07.&lt;/ref&gt;  Advocacy groups note that President Bush's 2008 budget proposal allotted $61 billion for the Education Department, cutting funding by $1.3 billion from the year before. 44 out of 50 states would have received reductions in federal funding if the budget passed as it was.&lt;ref&gt;Center for American Progress [http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/10/education_map.html The Targets of Bush's Education Cuts].&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, funding for the Enhancing Education Through Technology Program (EETT) has continued to drop while the demand for technology in schools has increased (Technology and Learning, 2006). However, these claims focused on reallocated funds, as each of President Bush's proposed budgets increased funding for major NCLB formula programs such as [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act|Title I]], including his final 2009 budget proposal.&lt;ref name="ed.gov"/&gt;

Members of Congress have viewed these authorized levels as spending caps, not spending promises. Some opponents argue that these funding shortfalls mean that schools faced with the system of escalating penalties for failing to meet testing targets are denied the resources necessary to remedy problems detected by testing. However, federal NCLB formula funding increased by billions during this period&lt;ref name="Education 2006"/&gt; and state and local funding increased by over $100 billion from school year 2001–02 through 2006–07.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d07/tables/dt07_026.asp?referrer=list National Center for Education Statistics, Digest of Education Statistics 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

In fiscal year 2007, $75 billion in costs were shifted from NCLB, adding further stresses on state budgets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/StateFederalCommittees/BudgetsRevenue/MandateMonitorOverview/tabid/15850/Default.aspx:Mandate Monitor Overview]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This decrease resulted in schools cutting programs that served to educate children, which subsequently impacted the ability to meet the goals of NCLB. The decrease in funding came at a time when there was an increase in expectations for school performance. To make ends meet, many schools re-allocated funds that had been intended for other purposes (e.g., arts, sports, etc.)  to achieve the national educational goals set by NCLB. Congress acknowledged these funding decreases and retroactively provided the funds to cover shortfalls, but without the guarantee of permanent aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=13746166 |title=Funding Stagnant for No Child Left Behind Program |publisher=NPR |date=2007-08-20 |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number one area where funding was cut from the national budget was in Title I funding for disadvantaged students and schools.&lt;ref name="cgcs.org"&gt;[http://www.cgcs.org/images/Legislative/Feb06.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120172356/http://www.cgcs.org/images/Legislative/Feb06.pdf|date=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===State education budgets===

The funding they received from the federal government in support of NCLB was not enough to cover the added expense necessary to adhere to the new law.

==Proposals for reform==
The Joint Organizational Statement on No Child Left Behind&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtest.org/joint%20statement%20civil%20rights%20grps%2010-21-04.html|title= Joint Organizational Statement on No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act|date=2004-10-21|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a proposal by more than 135 national civil rights, education, disability advocacy, civic, labor, and religious groups that have signed on to a statement calling for major changes to the federal education law. The National Center for Fair &amp; Open Testing (FairTest) initiated and chaired the meetings that produced the statement, originally released in October 2004. The statement's central message is that "the law's emphasis needs to shift from applying sanctions for failing to raise test scores to holding states and localities accountable for making the systemic changes that improve student achievement." The number of organizations signing the statement has nearly quadrupled since it was launched in late 2004 and continues to grow. The goal is to influence Congress, and the broader public, as the law's scheduled reauthorization approaches.

Education critic [[Alfie Kohn]] argues that the NCLB law is "unredeemable" and should be scrapped. He is quoted saying "[I]ts main effect has been to sentence poor children to an endless regimen of test-preparation drills".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/05/31/1558/ NCLB: 'Too Destructive to Salvage'], ''USA Today'', May 31, 2007.

In February 2007, former [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services Secretary]] [[Tommy Thompson]] and [[Georgia Governor]] [[Roy Barnes]], Co-Chairs of the Aspen Commission on No Child Left Behind, announced the release of the Commission's final recommendations for the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aspeninstitute.org/site/c.huLWJeMRKpH/b.938015/k.40DA/Commission_on_No_Child_Left_Behind.htm Beyond NCLB: Fulfilling the Promise to Our Nation's Children] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608121158/http://www.aspeninstitute.org/site/c.huLWJeMRKpH/b.938015/k.40DA/Commission_on_No_Child_Left_Behind.htm |date=2007-06-08 }}, February, 2007. Retrieved 6/8/07.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Commission is an independent, bipartisan effort to improve NCLB and ensure it is a more useful force in closing the achievement gap that separates disadvantaged children and their peers.  After a year of hearings, analysis, and research, the Commission uncovered the successes of NCLB, as well as provisions that must be significantly changed.

The Commission's goals are:
* Have effective teachers for all students, effective principals for all communities
* Accelerate progress and achievement gaps closed through improved accountability
* Move beyond status quo to effective school improvement and student options
* Have fair and accurate assessments of student progress
* Have high standards for every student in every state
* Ensure high schools prepare students for college and the workplace
* Drive progress through reliable, accurate data
* Encourage parental involvement and empowerment

The Forum on Educational Accountability (FEA), a working group of signers of the Joint Organizational Statement on NCLB has offered an alternative proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edaccountability.org/|title=Forum on Educational Accountability|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposes to shift NCLB from applying sanctions for failing to raise test scores to supporting state and communities and holding them accountable as they make systemic changes that improve student learning.

While many critics and policymakers believe the NCLB legislation has major flaws, it appears the policy will be in effect for the long-term, though not without major modifications.

President Barack Obama released a blueprint for reform of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]], the successor to No Child Left Behind, in March 2010. Specific revisions include providing funds for states to implement a broader range of assessments to evaluate advanced academic skills, including students’ abilities to conduct research, use technology, engage in scientific investigation, solve problems, and communicate effectively.

In addition, Obama proposes that the NCLB legislation lessen its stringent accountability punishments to states by focusing more on student improvement. Improvement measures would encompass assessing all children appropriately, including English language learners, minorities, and special needs students. The school system would be re-designed to consider measures beyond reading and math tests; and would promote incentives to keep students enrolled in school through graduation, rather than encouraging student drop-out to increase AYP scores.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, A. [http://www.education.com/magazine/article/Obama_Child_Left_Behind/ "Obama on No Child Left Behind Act"], "Education.com, Inc." (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama’s objectives also entail lowering the achievement gap between Black and White students and also increasing the federal budget by $3 billion to help schools meet the strict mandates of the bill. There has also been a proposal, put forward by the Obama administration, that states increase their academic standards after a [[dumbing down]] period, focus on re-classifying schools that have been labeled as failing, and develop a new evaluation process for teachers and educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/no_child_left_behind_act/index.html?scp=1&amp;sq=NCLB&amp;st=cse| title=No Child Left Behind Act | work=The New York Times | first=Sam | last=Dillon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government’s gradual investment in public social provisions provides the NCLB Act a forum to deliver on its promise to improve achievement for all of its students. Education critics argue that although the legislation is marked as an improvement to the ESEA in de-segregating the quality of education in schools, it is actually harmful. The legislation has become virtually the only federal social policy meant to address wide-scale social inequities, and its policy features inevitably stigmatize both schools attended by children of the poor and children in general.

Moreover, critics further argue that the current political landscape of this country, which favors market-based solutions to social and economic problems, has eroded trust in public institutions and has undermined political support for an expansive concept of social responsibility, which subsequently results in a disinvestment in the education of the poor and privatization of American schools.

Skeptics posit that NCLB provides distinct political advantages to Democrats, whose focus on accountability offers a way for them to speak of equal opportunity and avoid being classified as the party of big government, special interests, and minority groups—a common accusation from Republicans who want to discredit what they see as the traditional Democratic agenda. Opponents posit that NCLB has inadvertently shifted the debate on education and racial inequality to traditional political alliances. Consequently, major political discord remains between those who oppose federal oversight of state and local practices and those who view NCLB in terms of civil rights and educational equality.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, R. and Kantor, H. (2006). From New Deal to No Deal: No Child Left Behind Act and the Devolution of Responsibility for Equal Opportunity. 76:4. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard Educational Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the plan, the Obama Administration responds to critiques that standardized testing fails to capture higher level thinking by outlining new systems of evaluation to capture more in depth assessments on student achievement.&lt;ref name="ESEA Blueprint for Reform"&gt;U.S. Department of Education [http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/blueprint/blueprint.pdf "ESEA Blueprint for Reform"], (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; His plan came on the heels of the announcement of the [[Race to the Top]] initiative, a $4.35 billion reform program financed by the Department of Education through the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;Lohman, J. [http://www.cga.ct.gov/2010/rpt/2010-R-0235.htm "Comparing No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top."], "OLR Research Report" (4 June 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama says that accurate assessments "...can be used to accurately measure student growth; to better measure how states, districts, schools, principals, and teachers are educating students; to help teachers adjust and focus their teaching, and to provide better information to students and their families."&lt;ref name="ESEA Blueprint for Reform"/&gt; He has pledged to support state governments in their efforts to improve [[standardized test]] provisions by upgrading the standards they are set to measure. To do this, the federal government gives states grants to help develop and implement assessments based on higher standards so they can more accurately measure school progress.&lt;ref name="ESEA Blueprint for Reform"/&gt; This mirrors provisions in the Race to the Top program that require states to measure individual achievement through sophisticated data collection from kindergarten to higher education.

While Obama plans to improve the quality of standardized testing, he does not plan to eliminate the testing requirements and accountability measures produced by standardized tests. Rather, he provides additional resources and flexibility to meet new goals.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Chaddock, G. [http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0315/Obama-s-No-Child-Left-Behind-revise-a-little-more-flexibility "Obama’s No Child Left Behind Revise: A Little More Flexibility"], "The Christian Science Monitor". (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Obama’s reform efforts maintain that high-stakes testing is detrimental to school success across the country, because it encourages teachers to "teach to the test" and places undue pressure on teachers and schools if they fail to meet benchmarks.&lt;ref&gt;Ravitch, D. [http://0-www.eric.ed.gov.novacat.nova.edu/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ919558&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ919558 "Dictating to the Schools: A Look at the Effects of the Bush and Obama Administrations on Schools"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810123430/http://0-www.eric.ed.gov.novacat.nova.edu/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ919558&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ919558 |date=2011-08-10 }}, "Virginia Journal of Education". (November 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The re-authorization process has become somewhat of a controversy, as lawmakers and politicians continually debate about the changes that must be made to the bill to make it work best for the educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtest.org/NCLB-lost-decade-report-home |title=NCLB’s Lost Decade Report |publisher=FairTest |date=2011-12-30 |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Waivers ==
In 2012, President Obama granted waivers from NCLB requirements to several states. "In exchange for that flexibility, those states 'have agreed to raise standards, improve accountability, and undertake essential reforms to improve teacher effectiveness,' the White House said in a statement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-02-09/politics/politics_states-education_1_waivers-flexibility-standards?_s=PM:POLITICS | work=CNN | title=Obama to push 'No Child Left Behind' overhaul | date=March 15, 2010 | access-date=February 13, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214144437/http://articles.cnn.com/2012-02-09/politics/politics_states-education_1_waivers-flexibility-standards?_s=PM:POLITICS | archive-date=February 14, 2012 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* July 6, 2012 – [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Wisconsin]]

Eight of the 32 NCLB waivers granted to states are conditional, meaning those states have not entirely satisfied the administration's requirements and part of their plans are under review.

The waivers of [[Arizona]], [[Oregon]], and [[Kansas]] are conditional, according to Acting Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education Michael Yudin. Arizona has not yet received state board approval for teacher evaluations, and Kansas and Oregon are both still developing teacher and principal evaluation guidelines.

In addition, five states that did not complete the waiver process—and one whose application was rejected—got a one-year freeze on the rising targets for standardized test scores: [[Alabama]], [[Alaska]], [[Idaho]], [[Iowa]], [[Maine]], and [[West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=07/19/2012 12:01 am Updated: 08/13/2012 11:04 am |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/19/no-child-left-behind-waiver_n_1684504.html |title=No Child Left Behind Waivers Granted To 33 U.S. States, Some With Strings Attached |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=2013-06-24 |date=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Replacement ==
On April 30, 2015, a bill was introduced to Congress to replace the No Child Left Behind Act, the [[Every Student Succeeds Act]], which was passed by the House on December 2 and the Senate on December 9, before being signed into law by President Obama on December 10, 2015.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1177|title=S.1177 114th Congress (2015–2016): Every Student Succeeds Act|last=Lamar|first=Sen Alexander|date=2015-04-30|website=congress.gov|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill affords states more flexibility in regards to setting their own respective standards for measuring school as well as student performance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/12/2/9836014/every-student-succeeds-act|title=Congress is getting rid of No Child Left Behind.

'''Organic farming''' is a phrase coined early in the 20th century in reaction to rapidly changing farming practices to describe what other species use, and used, to farm without synthetic chemicals. Organic farming continues to be developed by various organic agriculture organizations today. It relies on fertilizers of organic origin such as compost [[manure]], [[green manure]], and [[bone meal]] and places emphasis on techniques such as [[crop rotation]] and [[companion planting]]. [[Biological pest control]], mixed cropping and the fostering of insect predators are encouraged. In general, organic standards are designed to allow the use of naturally occurring substances while prohibiting or strictly limiting synthetic substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.usda.gov/2012/01/25/organic-101-allowed-and-prohibited-substances/|title=USDA Blog  » Organic 101: Allowed and Prohibited Substances|website=blogs.usda.gov|access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, naturally occurring pesticides such as [[pyrethrin]] and [[rotenone]] are permitted, while synthetic [[fertilizers]] and [[pesticide]]s are generally prohibited. Synthetic substances that are allowed include, for example, [[Copper(II) sulfate|copper sulfate]], elemental [[sulfur]] and [[Ivermectin]]. [[Genetically modified organism]]s, [[nanomaterials]], human sewage [[sludge]], [[plant growth regulator]]s, [[hormone]]s, and [[antibiotic use in livestock]] husbandry are prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/19528/1/Paull2011NanoISOFAR.pdf "Nanomaterials in food and agriculture: The big issue of small matter for organic food and farming"], Proceedings of the Third Scientific Conference of ISOFAR (International Society of Organic Agriculture Research), 28 September – 1 October, Namyangju, Korea., 2:96-99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;SID=9874504b6f1025eb0e6b67cadf9d3b40&amp;rgn=div6&amp;view=text&amp;node=7:3.1.1.9.32.7&amp;idno=7|title=USDA List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances in Organic Agriculture|date=4 April 2016|website=USDA List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances in Organic Agriculture|publisher=USDA|access-date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons for advocation of organic farming include advantages in [[sustainability]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arsenault|first1=Chris|title=Only 60 Years of Farming Left If Soil Degradation Continues|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn_9780930031756"&gt;{{Citation |last=Coleman |first=Eliot |year=1995 |title=The New Organic Grower: A Master's Manual of Tools and Techniques for the Home and Market Gardener |edition=2nd |pages=65, 108 |url= |isbn=978-0930031756 |doi= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[openness]], [[self-sufficiency]], [[autonomy]]/[[independence]],&lt;ref name="isbn_9780930031756"/&gt; [[health]], [[food security]], and [[food safety]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of organic farming}}

[[Traditional agriculture|Agriculture]] was practiced for thousands of years without the use of artificial chemicals. [[Artificial fertilizer]]s were first created during the mid-19th century.

In 1921, [[Sir Albert Howard|Albert Howard]] and his wife [[Gabrielle Howard]], accomplished [[botanist]]s, founded an Institute of Plant Industry to improve traditional farming methods in India. Among other things, they brought improved implements and improved animal husbandry methods from their scientific training; then by incorporating aspects of the local traditional methods, developed protocols for the rotation of crops, erosion prevention techniques, and the systematic use of composts and manures.&lt;ref&gt;Yeshwant D. Wad, [http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/howard_memorial.html The Work At Indore]&lt;/ref&gt; Stimulated by these experiences of traditional farming, when Albert Howard returned to Britain in the early 1930s&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielle Howard had died while the Howards were still in India.&lt;/ref&gt; he began to promulgate a system of natural agriculture.

In July 1939, [[Ehrenfried Pfeiffer]], the author of the standard work on biodynamic agriculture (''Bio-Dynamic Farming and Gardening''),&lt;ref name=Paull2011&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paull, John |year=2011 |title=Biodynamic Agriculture: The Journey from Koberwitz to the World, 1924-1938|url=http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:304a24bf-3961-4798-b13c-9e0a1e2aa339|journal=Journal of Organic Systems |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=27–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; came to the UK at the invitation of [[Walter James, 4th Baron Northbourne]] as a presenter at the [[Betteshanger]] Summer School and Conference on Biodynamic Farming at Northbourne's farm in Kent.&lt;ref name=Betteshanger&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/19511/1/Paull2011BetteshangerJOS.pdf "The Betteshanger Summer School: Missing link between biodynamic agriculture and organic farming"], Journal of Organic Systems, 6(2):13-26.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the chief purposes of the conference was to bring together the proponents of various approaches to organic agriculture in order that they might cooperate within a larger movement. Howard attended the conference, where he met Pfeiffer.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenfried E. Pfeiffer, [http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/howard_memorial.html Sir Albert Howard's Deed for Science]&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, Northbourne published his manifesto of organic farming, ''Look to the Land'', in which he coined the term "organic farming." The Betteshanger conference has been described as the 'missing link' between biodynamic agriculture and other forms of organic farming.&lt;ref name=Betteshanger/&gt;

In 1940 Howard published his ''An Agricultural Testament''. In this book he adopted Northbourne's terminology of "organic farming."&lt;ref name=Paull&gt;Paull, John (2006) [http://orgprints.org/10138/1/10138.pdf The Farm as Organism: The Foundational Idea of Organic Agriculture] Elementals ~ Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania 83:14–18&lt;/ref&gt; Howard's work spread widely, and he became known as the "father of organic farming" for his work in applying scientific knowledge and principles to various traditional and natural methods.&lt;ref name=Stinner2007/&gt;{{rp|45}} In the United States [[Jerome Irving Rodale|J.I. Rodale]], who was keenly interested both in Howard's ideas and in biodynamics,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Heckman, [http://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/a-history-of-organic-farming-transitions-from-sir-albert-howards-war-in-the-soil-to-the-usda-national-organic-program/ A History of Organic Farming: Transitions from Sir Albert Howard’s War in the Soil to the USDA National Organic Program]&lt;/ref&gt; founded in the 1940s both a working organic farm for trials and experimentation, [[The Rodale Institute]], and the [[Rodale Press]] to teach and advocate organic methods to the wider public. These became important influences on the spread of organic agriculture. Further work was done by [[Lady Eve Balfour]] (the [[Haughley Experiment]]) in the United Kingdom, and many others across the world.

Increasing environmental awareness in the general population in modern times has transformed the originally supply-driven organic movement to a demand-driven one. Premium prices and some government subsidies attracted farmers. In the developing world, many producers farm according to traditional methods that are comparable to organic farming, but not certified, and that may not include the latest scientific advancements in organic agriculture. In other cases, farmers in the developing world have converted to modern organic methods for economic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John [http://orgprints.org/10949/01/10949.pdf "China's Organic Revolution"], Journal of Organic Systems (2007) 2 (1): 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
Biodynamic agriculturists, who based their work on Steiner's spiritually-oriented [[anthroposophy]], used the term "organic" to indicate that a farm should be viewed as a living organism,&lt;ref name=Kirchmann/&gt;{{rp|17–19}}&lt;ref name=Betteshanger/&gt; in the sense of the following quotation:
{{quote|1="An organic farm, properly speaking, is not one that uses certain methods and substances and avoids others; it is a farm whose structure is formed in imitation of the structure of a natural system that has the integrity, the independence and the benign dependence of an organism"
| 2=[[Wendell Berry]], "The Gift of Good Land"}}

The use of "organic" popularized by Howard and Rodale, on the other hand, refers more narrowly to the use of [[Soil organic matter|organic matter]] derived from plant compost and animal manures to improve the [[humus]] content of soils, grounded in the work of early soil scientists who developed what was then called "humus farming." Since the early 1940s the two camps have tended to merge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nayler|first=Justin|title=Second Thoughts About Organic Agriculture|url=http://www.soilandhealth.org/01aglibrary/Second.Thoughts.pdf|publisher=Soil And Health Library|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Diver|first=Steve|title=Controlled Microbial Composting and Humus Management: Luebke Compost|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/steved/Luebke/Luebke-compost2.html|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==

[[File:Organic-vegetable-cultivation.jpeg|thumb|Organic cultivation of mixed vegetables in [[Capay, California]]]]
{{quote|"Organic agriculture is a production system that sustains the health of soils, [[ecosystems]] and people. It relies on ecological processes, [[biodiversity]] and cycles adapted to local conditions, rather than the use of inputs with adverse effects. Organic agriculture combines tradition, innovation and science to benefit the shared environment and promote fair relationships and a good quality of life for all involved..."|[[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifoam.org/en/organic-landmarks/definition-organic-agriculture |title=Definition of Organic Agriculture |accessdate=30 September 2008 |publisher=IFOAM}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Organic farming methods combine scientific knowledge of ecology and modern [[technology]] with [[Traditional agriculture|traditional farming]] practices based on naturally occurring biological processes. Organic farming methods are studied in the field of [[agroecology]]. While conventional agriculture uses synthetic pesticides and water-soluble synthetically purified fertilizers, organic farmers are restricted by regulations to using natural pesticides and fertilizers. An example of a natural pesticide is [[pyrethrin]], which is found naturally in the [[Chrysanthemum]] flower. The principal methods of organic farming include [[crop rotation]], [[green manure]]s and [[compost]], [[biological pest control]], and mechanical [[Tillage|cultivation]]. These measures use the natural environment to enhance agricultural productivity: [[legumes]] are planted to fix [[nitrogen]] into the soil, [[predation|natural insect predators]] are encouraged, crops are rotated to confuse pests and renew soil, and natural materials such as [[potassium bicarbonate]]&lt;ref&gt;FiBL (2006) [http://www.betriebsmittelliste.ch/fileadmin/documents/de/hifu/stellungnahmen/potassium_bicarbonate_organic.pdf Use of potassium bicarbonate as a fungicide in organic farming]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mulch]]es are used to control disease and [[weed]]s. [[Genetically modified organism|Genetically modified]] seeds and animals are excluded.

While organic is fundamentally different from conventional because of the use of carbon based fertilizers compared with highly soluble synthetic based fertilizers and [[biological pest control]] instead of synthetic pesticides, organic farming and large-scale conventional farming are not entirely mutually exclusive. Many of the methods developed for organic agriculture have been borrowed by more conventional agriculture. For example, [[Integrated Pest Management]] is a multifaceted strategy that uses various organic methods of pest control whenever possible, but in conventional farming could include synthetic [[pesticides]] only as a last resort.&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;{{cite web | title =Integrated Pest Management | work = | publisher =U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | url =http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/tipm.html | doi = | accessdate =1 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crop diversity ===

Organic farming encourages [[Crop diversity]]. The science of [[agroecology]] has revealed the benefits of [[polyculture]] (multiple crops in the same space), which is often employed in organic farming.&lt;ref&gt;Fargione J, and D Tilman. 2002. "[http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/biblio/fulltext/t1868.pdf Competition and coexistence in terrestrial plants]". Pages 156-206 In U. Sommer and B Worm editors, ''Competition and Coexistence''. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; Planting a variety of vegetable crops supports a wider range of beneficial insects, soil microorganisms, and other factors that add up to overall farm health. Crop diversity helps environments thrive and protects species from going extinct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wunderground.com/blog/organicfarmingblog/crop-diversity-a-distinctive-characteristic-of-an-organic-farming-met Crop diversity: A Distinctive Characteristic of an Organic Farming Method] - Organic Farming; 15 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soil managements ===

Organic farming relies heavily on the natural breakdown of organic matter, using techniques like [[green manure]] and [[composting]], to replace nutrients taken from the soil by previous crops. This biological process, driven by [[microorganism]]s such as [[mycorrhiza]], allows the natural production of nutrients in the soil throughout the growing season, and has been referred to as ''feeding the soil to feed the plant.'' Organic farming uses a variety of methods to improve soil fertility, including crop rotation, cover cropping, reduced tillage, and application of compost. By reducing tillage, soil is not inverted and exposed to air; less carbon is lost to the atmosphere resulting in more soil organic carbon. This has an added benefit of carbon sequestration, which can reduce green house gases and help reverse climate change.

Plants need [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[potassium]], as well as [[micronutrient]]s and [[symbiotic relationship]]s with [[fungi]] and other organisms to flourish, but getting enough nitrogen, and particularly synchronization so that plants get enough nitrogen at the right time (when plants need it most), is a challenge for organic farmers.&lt;ref name=SoilFertility&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Watson CA, Atkinson D, Gosling P, Jackson LR, Rayns FW | title = Managing soil fertility in organic farming systems | year = 2002 | journal = Soil Use and Management | pages = 239–247| volume = 18 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-2743.2002.tb00265.x }} [http://orgprints.org/8060/ Preprint with free full-text].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crop rotation]] and [[green manure]] ("[[cover crop]]s") help to provide nitrogen through [[legume]]s (more precisely, the ''[[Fabaceae]]'' family), which fix nitrogen from the atmosphere through symbiosis with [[rhizobia]]l [[bacteria]]. [[Intercropping]], which is sometimes used for insect and disease control, can also increase soil nutrients, but the competition between the legume and the crop can be problematic and wider spacing between crop rows is required. [[Crop residue]]s can be [[plough]]ed back into the soil, and different plants leave different amounts of nitrogen, potentially aiding synchronization.&lt;ref name=SoilFertility/&gt; Organic farmers also use animal [[manure]], certain processed fertilizers such as seed meal and various [[mineral]] powders such as [[rock phosphate]] and [[Greensand (geology)|green sand]], a naturally occurring form of [[potash]] that provides potassium. Together these methods help to control [[erosion]]. In some cases [[pH]] may need to be amended. Natural pH amendments include [[Agricultural lime|lime]] and [[sulfur]], but in the U.S. some compounds such as [[Iron(II) sulfate|iron sulfate]], [[aluminum sulfate]], [[magnesium sulfate]], and soluble [[boron]] products are allowed in organic farming.&lt;ref name=Gillman2008/&gt;{{Rp|43}}

Mixed farms with both [[livestock]] and [[Tillage|crops]] can operate as [[ley farming|ley farms]], whereby the land gathers fertility through growing nitrogen-fixing [[forage]] grasses such as [[white clover]] or [[alfalfa]] and grows [[cash crop]]s or [[cereal]]s when fertility is established. Farms without livestock ("stockless") may find it more difficult to maintain soil fertility, and may rely more on external inputs such as imported [[manure]] as well as grain legumes and green manures, although grain legumes may fix limited nitrogen because they are harvested. [[Horticulture|Horticultural]] farms that grow fruits and vegetables in protected conditions often rely even more on external inputs.&lt;ref name=SoilFertility/&gt;

Biological research into soil and soil organisms has proven beneficial to organic farming. Varieties of bacteria and fungi break down chemicals, plant matter and animal waste into productive soil nutrients. In turn, they produce benefits of healthier yields and more productive soil for future crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=298–312|last=Ingram |first=M. |year=2007 |title=Biology and Beyond: The Science of ''Back to Nature'' Farming in the United States |journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |volume=97 |issue=2 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8306.2007.00537.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fields with less or no manure display significantly lower yields, due to decreased soil microbe community. Increased manure improves biological activity, providing a healthier, more arable soil system and higher yields.&lt;ref name="Fließbach et al. 2006"/&gt;

=== Weed management ===

Organic [[weed]] management promotes weed suppression, rather than weed elimination, by enhancing crop competition and [[phytotoxic]] effects on weeds.&lt;ref name="extension.iastate.edu"&gt;Kathleen Delate and Robert Hartzler. 2003. [http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/PM1883.pdf Weed Management for Organic Farmers]. Iowa State University Extension Bulletin 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; Organic farmers integrate cultural, biological, mechanical, physical and chemical tactics to manage weeds without synthetic herbicides.

Organic standards require [[Crop rotation|rotation]] of annual crops,&lt;ref&gt;Staff, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. [http://193.194.138.42/en/Sustainability-Claims-Portal/Discussion-Forum/Organic-Standards/ Organic Standards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606214740/http://193.194.138.42/en/Sustainability-Claims-Portal/Discussion-Forum/Organic-Standards/ |date=6 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that a single crop cannot be grown in the same location without a different, intervening crop. Organic crop rotations frequently include weed-suppressive [[cover crop]]s and crops with dissimilar life cycles to discourage weeds associated with a particular crop.&lt;ref name="extension.iastate.edu"/&gt; Research is ongoing to develop organic methods to promote the growth of natural microorganisms that suppress the growth or germination of common weeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kremer | first1 = Robert J. | last2 = Li | first2 = Jianmei | year = 2003 | title = Developing weed-suppressive soils through improved soil quality management | url = http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/11123/PDF | journal = Soil &amp; Tillage Research | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 193–202 | doi=10.1016/s0167-1987(03)00088-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cultural practices used to enhance crop competitiveness and reduce weed pressure include selection of competitive crop varieties, high-density planting, tight row spacing, and late planting into warm soil to encourage rapid crop [[germination]].&lt;ref name="extension.iastate.edu"/&gt;

Mechanical and physical weed control practices used on organic farms can be broadly grouped as:&lt;ref name="extension.org"&gt;Mark Schonbeck, Virginia Association for Biological Farming.

* [[Tillage]] - Turning the soil between crops to incorporate crop residues and soil amendments; remove existing weed growth and prepare a seedbed for planting; turning soil after seeding to kill weeds, including [[cultivator|cultivation]] of row crops;

Some naturally sourced chemicals are allowed for herbicidal use. These include certain formulations of [[acetic acid]] (concentrated vinegar), [[corn gluten meal]], and [[essential oils]]. A few selective [[bioherbicide]]s based on fungal [[pathogen]]s have also been developed. At this time, however, organic herbicides and bioherbicides play a minor role in the organic weed control toolbox.&lt;ref name="extension.org"/&gt;

Weeds can be controlled by grazing. For example, geese have been used successfully to weed a range of organic crops including cotton, strawberries, tobacco, and corn,&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Geiger and Harold Biellier. 1993.

{{See also|Biological pest control|Integrated Pest Management}}

Organisms aside from weeds that cause problems on organic farms include [[arthropod]]s (e.g., insects, [[mite]]s), [[nematode]]s, [[fungus|fungi]] and [[bacteria]]. Organic practices include, but are not limited to:

* encouraging predatory beneficial insects to control pests by serving them nursery plants and/or an alternative habitat, usually in a form of a [[Windbreak|shelterbelt]], [[hedgerow]], or [[beetle bank]];
* encouraging beneficial microorganisms;
* [[crop rotation|rotating crops]] to different locations from year to year to interrupt pest reproduction cycles;
* planting [[companion planting|companion crops]] and [[List of pest-repelling plants|pest-repelling plants]] that discourage or divert pests;
* using row covers to protect crops during pest migration periods;
* using [[Ecologic pesticides and herbicides|biologic pesticides and herbicides]];
* using [[stale seed bed]]s to germinate and destroy weeds before planting;&lt;ref&gt;Presentation by Ilse A. Rasmussen, Dept. of Crop Protection, Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences. [http://orgprints.org/216/02/Elspeet2000_iar.PDF Sowing time, false seedbed, row distance and [[mechanical weed control]] in organic winter wheat]&lt;/ref&gt;
* using sanitation to remove pest habitat;
* using [[insect trap]]s to monitor and control insect populations; and
* using physical barriers, such as [[row cover]]s.

Examples of predatory beneficial insects include [[Orius (bug)|minute pirate bugs]], [[Geocoris|big-eyed bugs]], and to a lesser extent [[Coccinellidae|ladybugs]] (which tend to fly away), all of which eat a wide range of pests. [[Neuroptera|Lacewings]] are also effective, but tend to fly away. [[Praying mantis]] tend to move more slowly and eat less heavily. [[Parasitoid wasp]]s tend to be effective for their selected prey, but like all small insects can be less effective outdoors because the wind controls their movement. Predatory mites are effective for controlling other mites.&lt;ref name=Gillman2008/&gt;{{Rp|66–90}}

Naturally derived [[insecticide]]s allowed for use on organic farms use include ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (a bacterial toxin), [[pyrethrum]] (a chrysanthemum extract), [[spinosad]] (a bacterial metabolite), [[neem]] (a tree extract) and [[rotenone]] (a legume root extract). Fewer than 10% of organic farmers use these pesticides regularly; one survey found that only 5.3% of vegetable growers in California use [[rotenone]] while 1.7% use [[pyrethrum]].&lt;ref name=Lotter2003&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lotter |first1= D. |year=2003 |url=http://donlotter.net/lotter_organicag.pdf| title= Organic Agriculture |journal=Journal of Sustainable Agriculture | volume = 21 |issue=4 |format = PDF|doi=10.1300/J064v21n04_06|page=59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}} These pesticides are not always more safe or environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides and can cause harm.&lt;ref name=Gillman2008&gt;Gillman J.

Naturally derived [[fungicide]]s allowed for use on organic farms include the bacteria ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' and ''Bacillus pumilus''; and the fungus ''[[Trichoderma harzianum]]''.

=== Livestock ===

[[File:Organic cattle in Ohio, United States.jpg|thumb|right|For livestock, like these healthy cows, vaccines play an important part in animal health since antibiotic therapy is prohibited in organic farming]]
Raising livestock and poultry, for meat, dairy and eggs, is another traditional farming activity that complements growing. Organic farms attempt to provide animals with natural living conditions and feed. Organic certification verifies that livestock are raised according to the USDA organic regulations throughout their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5102526}}&lt;/ref&gt; These regulations include the requirement that all animal feed must be certified organic.

Organic livestock may be, and must be, treated with medicine when they are sick, but drugs cannot be used to promote growth, their feed must be organic, and they must be pastured.&lt;ref&gt;FAO [http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload/230124/CXg_032e.pdf Guidelines for the Production, Processing, Labelling and Marketing of Organically Produced Foods (Gl 32 – 1999, Rev. 1 – 2001)]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19ff}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/ams.fetchTemplateData.do?template=TemplateN&amp;navID=OrganicStandardslinkNOPConsumers&amp;rightNav1=OrganicStandardslinkNOPConsumers&amp;topNav=&amp;leftNav=NationalOrganicProgram&amp;page=NOPOrganicStandards&amp;resultType=&amp;acct=nopgeninfo|title=Organic Standards - Agricultural Marketing Service|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, horses and cattle were once a basic farm feature that provided labor, for hauling and plowing, fertility, through recycling of manure, and fuel, in the form of food for farmers and other animals. While today, small growing operations often do not include livestock, domesticated animals are a desirable part of the organic farming equation, especially for true sustainability, the ability of a farm to function as a self-renewing unit.

=== Genetic modification ===
{{Main|Genetically modified crops|Genetically modified food|Genetically modified food controversies}}

A key characteristic of organic farming is the rejection of genetically engineered plants and animals. On 19 October 1998, participants at IFOAM's 12th Scientific Conference issued the [[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements#IFOAM and GMOs|Mar del Plata Declaration]], where more than 600 delegates from over 60 countries voted unanimously to exclude the use of genetically modified organisms in food production and agriculture.

Although opposition to the use of any transgenic technologies in organic farming is strong, agricultural researchers Luis Herrera-Estrella and Ariel Alvarez-Morales continue to advocate integration of [[transgenic]] technologies into organic farming as the optimal means to sustainable agriculture, particularly in the developing world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=The EMBO Journal | volume=2 |date=April 2001 |author1=Luis Herrera-Estrella |author2=Ariel Alvarez-Morales |title=Genetically modified crops: hope for developing countries? |pages=256–258| doi= 10.1093/embo-reports/kve075 |journal=EMBO Reports |pmid=11306538 |issue=4 |pmc=1083872}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does author and scientist [[Pamela Ronald]], who views this kind of [[biotechnology]] as being consistent with organic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=Oxford University Press |date=April 2008 |author1=Pamela Ronald |author2=Raoul Admachak |title=Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics and the Future of Food|isbn=0195301757 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although GMOs are excluded from organic farming, there is concern that the pollen from genetically modified crops is increasingly penetrating organic and [[Heirloom plant|heirloom seed stocks]], making it difficult, if not impossible, to keep these genomes from entering the organic food supply. Differing regulations among countries limits the availability of GMOs to certain countries, as described in the article on [[regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms]].

=== Tools ===

Organic farmers use a number of traditional [[farm tools]] to do farming. Due to the goals of [[sustainability]] in organic farming, organic farmers try to minimize their reliance on [[fossil fuels]]. In the developing world on small organic farms tools are normally constrained to hand tools and [[diesel fuel|diesel]] powered water pumps.

== Standards ==
{{Main|Organic certification}}
Standards regulate production methods and in some cases final output for organic agriculture. Standards may be voluntary or legislated. As early as the 1970s private associations certified organic producers. In the 1980s, governments began to produce organic production guidelines. In the 1990s, a trend toward legislated standards began, most notably with the 1991 [[EU-Eco-regulation]] developed for [[European Union]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/other/l21118_en.htm|title=EUR-Lex - l21118 - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which set standards for 12 countries, and a 1993 UK program. The EU's program was followed by a Japanese program in 2001, and in 2002 the U.S. created the [[National Organic Program]] (NOP).&lt;ref&gt;USDA [http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop/NOP/standards.html NOP Program Standards]. Retrieved 2 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007 over 60 countries regulate organic farming ([[#refWorldStats2007|IFOAM 2007:11]]). In 2005 IFOAM created the [[Principles of Organic Agriculture]], an international guideline for certification criteria.&lt;ref&gt;IFOAM. (2005). [http://www.ifoam.org/about_ifoam/standards/norms.html The IFOAM Norms] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210095156/http://www.ifoam.org/about_ifoam/standards/norms.html |date=10 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the agencies accredit certification groups rather than individual farms.

Organic production materials used in and foods are tested independently by the Organic Materials Review Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omri.org/|title=Welcome to the Organic Materials Review Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Composting ===
Using manure as a fertilizer risks contaminating food with animal gut bacteria, including pathogenic strains of E. coli that have caused fatal poisoning from eating organic food.&lt;ref name=newdaily&gt;[http://thenewdaily.com.au/life/eat-drink/2014/08/29/hidden-dangers-organic-food/ Organic food: the hidden dangers that might surprise you]&lt;/ref&gt; To combat this risk, [[USDA]] organic standards require that manure must be sterilized through high temperature [[Composting#Approaches|thermophilic composting]]. If raw animal manure is used, 120 days must pass before the crop is harvested if the final product comes into direct contact with the soil. For products that don't directly contact soil, 90 days must pass prior to harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=11fd57b422b6314d866dc4b02f1a101d;rgn=div5;view=text;node=7:3.1.1.9.30;idno=7;cc=ecfr|title=National Organic Program Regulations|publisher=|access-date=27 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211185453/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=11fd57b422b6314d866dc4b02f1a101d;rgn=div5;view=text;node=7:3.1.1.9.30;idno=7;cc=ecfr|archive-date=11 December 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics ==

The [[economics]] of organic farming, a subfield of [[agricultural economics]], encompasses the entire process and effects of organic farming in terms of human society, including [[social cost]]s, [[opportunity cost]]s, [[unintended consequence]]s, [[information asymmetries]], and [[economies of scale]]. Although the scope of economics is broad, agricultural economics tends to focus on maximizing yields and efficiency at the farm level. Economics takes an [[anthropocentric]] approach to the value of the natural world: biodiversity, for example, is considered beneficial only to the extent that it is valued by people and increases profits. Some entities such as the [[European Union]] [[subsidy|subsidize]] organic farming, in large part because these countries want to account for the [[externalities]] of reduced water use, reduced water contamination, reduced [[soil erosion]], reduced carbon emissions, increased biodiversity, and assorted other benefits that result from organic farming.&lt;ref name=Misconcept/&gt;

Traditional organic farming is labor and knowledge-intensive whereas conventional farming is capital-intensive, requiring more energy and manufactured inputs.&lt;ref name=Halberg&gt;{{cite book|last=Halberg|first=Niels|title=Global development of organic agriculture: challenges and prospects|year=2006|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-84593-078-3|page=297|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ij-6DO4kk8gC|page=298}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organic farmers in California have cited marketing as their greatest obstacle.&lt;ref&gt;Strochlic, R.; Sierra, L. (2007).

=== Geographic producer distribution ===

The markets for organic products are strongest in North America and Europe, which as of 2001 are estimated to have $6 and $8 billion respectively of the $20 billion global market.&lt;ref name=Lotter2003/&gt;{{rp|6}} As of 2007 [[Australasia]] has 39% of the total organic farmland, including Australia's {{convert|11,80,000|ha}} but 97 percent of this land is sprawling [[rangeland]] ([[#refWorldStats2007|2007:35]]). US sales are 20x as much.&lt;ref name=Lotter2003/&gt;{{rp|7}} Europe farms 23 percent of global organic farmland ({{convert|6,900,000|ha||abbr=on}}), followed by Latin America with 19 percent (5.8 million hectares - 14.3 million acres). Asia has 9.5 percent while North America has 7.2 percent. Africa has 3 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Organic farming by country]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Australia,&lt;ref name="Atlas"/&gt; the countries with the most organic farmland are Argentina (3.1 million hectares - 7.7 million acres), China (2.3 million hectares - 5.7 million acres), and the United States (1.6 million hectares - 4 million acres). Much of Argentina's organic farmland is pasture, like that of Australia ([[#refWorldStats2007|2007:42]]). Spain, Germany, Brazil (the world's largest agricultural exporter), Uruguay, and the England follow the United States in the amount of organic land ([[#refWorldStats2007|2007:26]]).

In the European Union ([[EU25#2004 Enlargement|EU25]]) 3.9% of the total utilized agricultural area was used for organic production in 2005. The countries with the highest proportion of organic land were Austria (11%) and Italy (8.4%), followed by the Czech Republic and Greece (both 7.2%). The lowest figures were shown for Malta (0.2%), Poland (0.6%) and Ireland (0.8%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2013, the number of organic producers grew by almost 270,000, or more than 13%.&lt;ref name=OrgWorldYearbook2016/&gt; By 2014, there were a reported 2.3 million organic producers in the world.&lt;ref name=OrgWorldYearbook2016/&gt; Most of the total global increase took place in the Philippines, Peru, China, and Thailand.&lt;ref name=OrgWorldYearbook2016/&gt;  Overall, the majority of all organic producers are in India (650,000 in 2013), Uganda (190,552 in 2014), Mexico (169,703 in 2013) and the Philippines (165,974 in 2014).&lt;ref name=OrgWorldYearbook2016/&gt;

=== Productivity ===

Studies comparing yields have had mixed results.&lt;ref name="Welsh, Rick 1999"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Welsh, Rick | title=Economics of Organic Grain and Soybean Production in the Midwestern United States | journal=Henry A. Wallace Institute for Alternative Agriculture | year=1999 | volume= | pages= | url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/134120}}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences among findings can often be attributed to variations between study designs including differences in the crops studied and the methodology by which results were gathered.

A 2012 meta-analysis found that productivity is typically lower for organic farming than conventional farming, but that the size of the difference depends on context and in some cases may be very small.&lt;ref name=Verena2013&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seufert | first1 = Verena | last2 = Ramankutty | first2 = Navin | last3 = Foley | first3 = Jonathan A. | year = 2012 | title = Comparing the yields of organic and conventional agriculture | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v485/n7397/full/nature11069.html | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7397| pages = 229–232 | doi=10.1038/nature11069| bibcode = 2012Natur.485..229S }}&lt;/ref&gt; While organic yields can be lower than conventional yields, another meta-analysis published in Sustainable Agriculture Research in 2015, concluded that certain organic on-farm practices could help narrow this gap. Timely weed management and the application of manure in conjunction with legume forages/cover crops were shown to have positive results in increasing organic corn and soybean productivity.

Another meta-analysis published in the journal Agricultural Systems in 2011 analyzed 362 datasets and found that organic yields were on average 80% of conventional yields. The author's found that there are relative differences in this yield gap based on crop type with crops like soybeans and rice scoring higher than the 80% average and crops like wheat and potato scoring lower. Across global regions, Asia and Central Europe were found to have relatively higher yields and Northern Europe relatively lower than the average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Pont|first=Tomek|last2=Rijk|first2=Bert|last3=van Ittersum|first3=Martin K.|date=19 December 2011|title=The crop yield gap between organic and conventional agriculture|url=|journal=Agricultural Systems|doi=10.1016/j.agsy.2011.12.004|pmid=|volume=108|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1742170507001640 |laysource=New Scientist |laydate=12 July 2007 |laysummary=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12245-organic-farming-could-feed-the-world.html |title=Organic agriculture and the global food supply |year=2007 |last1=Badgley |first1=Catherine |last2=Moghtader |first2=Jeremy |last3=Quintero |first3=Eileen |last4=Zakem |first4=Emily |last5=Chappell |first5=M.

The researchers also found that while in developed countries, organic systems on average produce 92% of the yield produced by conventional agriculture, organic systems produce 80% more than conventional farms in developing countries, because the materials needed for organic farming are more accessible than synthetic farming materials to farmers in some poor countries. This study's methodology and results were contested by D.J. Connor of The University of Melbourne, in a short communication published in Field Crops Research.&lt;ref name="Connor2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Connor | first1 = D. J. | year = 2008 | title = Organic agriculture cannot feed the world | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Connor6/publication/228387654_Organic_agriculture_cannot_feed_the_world/links/0c9605322be1a6f027000000.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Field Crops Res. | volume = 106 | issue = | pages = 187–190 | doi=10.1016/j.fcr.2007.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connor writes that errors in Badgley et al. result in "major overestimation of the productivity of OA".

====Long term studies====
A study published in 2005 compared conventional cropping, organic animal-based cropping, and organic legume-based cropping on a test farm at the [[Rodale Institute]] over 22 years.&lt;ref&gt;Pimentel DP et al. (2005) [http://www.ce.cmu.edu/~gdrg/readings/2007/02/20/Pimental_EnvironmentalEnergeticAndEconomicComparisonsOfOrganicAndConventionalFarmingSystems.pdf Environmental, Energetic, and Economic Comparisons of Organic and Conventional Farming Systems] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601032933/http://www.ce.cmu.edu/~gdrg/readings/2007/02/20/Pimental_EnvironmentalEnergeticAndEconomicComparisonsOfOrganicAndConventionalFarmingSystems.pdf |date=1 June 2013 }} Bioscience 55(7): 573-582.&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that "the crop yields for corn and soybeans were similar in the organic animal, organic legume, and conventional farming systems". It also found that "significantly less fossil energy was expended to produce corn in the Rodale Institute’s organic animal and organic legume systems than in the conventional production system. There was little difference in energy input between the different treatments for producing soybeans. In the organic systems, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides were generally not used". As of 2013 the Rodale study was ongoing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rodaleinstitute.org/our-work/farming-systems-trial/|title=Farming Systems Trial: Overview - Rodale Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a thirty-year anniversary report was published by Rodale in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rodaleinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/FSTbookletFINAL.pdf |title=The Farming Systems Trial Rodale 30 year report|accessdate=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A long-term field study comparing organic/conventional agriculture carried out over 21 years in Switzerland concluded that "Crop yields of the organic systems averaged over 21 experimental years at 80% of the conventional ones. The fertilizer input, however, was 34 – 51% lower, indicating an efficient production. The organic farming systems used 20 – 56% less energy to produce a
crop unit and per land area this difference was 36 – 53%. In spite of the considerably lower pesticide input the quality of organic products was hardly discernible from conventional analytically and even came off better in food preference trials and picture creating methods"&lt;ref&gt;Fliessbach, et al. ([[Research Institute of Organic Agriculture]]), [http://www.soilace.com/pdf/pon2004/1.Fliessbach.pdf "D-O-K (Biodynamic-Bioorganic-Conventional): Results From 21 Year Old Field Experiment"].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Profitability ===

In the United States, organic farming has been shown to be 2.7 to 3.8 times more profitable for the farmer than conventional farming when prevailing price premiums are taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moyer|first=Jeff|date=2013|title=Perspective on Rodale Institute’s Farming Systems Trial|url=|journal=Crop Management|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, organic farming is between 22 and 35 percent more profitable for farmers than conventional methods, according to a 2015 meta-analysis of studies conducted across five continents.&lt;ref name="Crowder 7611–7616"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crowder|first=David W.|last2=Reganold|first2=John P.|date=16 June 2015|title=Financial competitiveness of organic agriculture on a global scale|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/24/7611|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=112|issue=24|pages=7611–7616|doi=10.1073/pnas.1423674112|issn=0027-8424|pmc=4475942|pmid=26034271|bibcode=2015PNAS..112.7611C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The profitability of organic agriculture can be attributed to a number of factors. First, organic farmers do not rely on synthetic fertilizer and pesticide inputs, which can be costly. In addition, organic foods currently enjoy a price premium over conventionally produced foods, meaning that organic farmers can often get more for their yield.

The price premium for organic food is an important factor in the economic viability of organic farming. In 2013 there was a 100% price premium on organic vegetables and a 57% price premium for organic fruits. These percentages are based on wholesale fruit and vegetable prices, available through the United States Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/organic-prices.aspx|title=USDA Economic Research Service - Organic Prices|last=Greene|first=Catherine|website=www.ers.usda.gov|access-date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Price premiums exist not only for organic versus nonorganic crops, but may also vary depending on the venue where the product is sold: farmers' markets, grocery stores, or wholesale to restaurants. For many producers, direct sales at farmers' markets are most profitable because the farmer receives the entire markup, however this is also the most time and labor-intensive approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Organic Pricing and Costs of Production|last=Post|first=Emily|publisher=NCAT|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been signs of organic price premiums narrowing in recent years, which lowers the economic incentive for farmers to convert to or maintain organic production methods.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McBride|first=William D.|last2=Greene|first2=Catherine R.|date=2013|title=Organic Data and Research from the ARMS Survey: Findings on Competitiveness of the Organic Soybean Sector|url=|journal=Crop Management|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from 22 years of experiments at the Rodale Institute found that, based on the current yields and production costs associated with organic farming in the United States, a price premium of only 10% is required to achieve parity with conventional farming.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A separate study found that on a global scale, price premiums of only 5-7% percent were needed to break even with conventional methods.&lt;ref name="Crowder 7611–7616"/&gt; Without the price premium, profitability for farmers is mixed.&lt;ref name="Lotter2003" /&gt;{{rp|11}}

For markets and supermarkets organic food is profitable as well, and is generally sold at significantly higher prices than non-organic food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/18/business/18organic.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Sticker Shock in the Organic Aisles |last=Martin|first=Andrew|author2=Kim Severson |date=18 April 2008|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy efficiency ===

In the most recent assessments of the energy efficiency of organic versus conventional agriculture, results have been mixed regarding which form is more carbon efficient. Organic farm systems have more often than not been found to be more energy efficient, however, this is not always the case. More than anything, results tend to depend upon crop type and farm size.&lt;ref name="Pimental 1983 359–372"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Pimental | title=Energy efficiency of farming systems: Organic and conventional agriculture | journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment | year=1983 | volume=9 | pages=359–372 | doi=10.1016/0167-8809(83)90021-X | last2=Berardi | first2=Gigi | last3=Fast | first3=Sarah | issue=4|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive comparison of energy efficiency in grain production, produce yield, and animal husbandry concluded that organic farming had a higher yield per unit of energy over the vast majority of the crops and livestock systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dalgaard | title=A model for fossil energy use in Danish agriculture used to compare organic and conventional farming | journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment | year=2001 | volume=87 | pages=51–65 | doi=10.1016/S0167-8809(00)00297-8 | last2=Halberg | first2=Niels | last3=Porter | first3=John R.|display-authors=etal| url=http://orgprints.org/15521/1/15521.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, two studies - both comparing organically- versus conventionally-farmed apples - declare contradicting results, one saying organic farming is more energy efficient, the other saying conventionally is more efficient.&lt;ref name="Pimental 1983 359–372"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reganold et al. 2001 926–930"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Reganold | title=Sustainability of three apple production systems | journal=Nature |date=April 2001 | volume=410 | pages=926–930 | doi=10.1038/35073574 | pmid=11309616 | last2=Glover | first2=JD | last3=Andrews | first3=PK | last4=Hinman | first4=HR | issue=6831|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has generally been found that the labor input per unit of yield was higher for organic systems compared with conventional production.&lt;ref name="Pimental 1983 359–372"/&gt;

=== Sales and marketing ===

Most sales are concentrated in developed nations. In 2008, 69% of Americans claimed to occasionally buy organic products, down from 73% in 2005. One theory for this change was that consumers were substituting "local" produce for "organic" produce.&lt;ref&gt;CNN. [http://money.cnn.com/2008/04/23/news/companies/organics_backlash/index.htm?postversion=2008042308 Consumer surveys show slipping interest in organic products]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartman-group.com/publications/reports/organic-marketplace/ The Hartman Group Organic Marketplace Reports].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distributors ===

The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] requires that distributors, manufacturers, and processors of organic products be certified by an accredited state or private agency.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/192533/vgs32901.pdf|title=Using Vertically Coordinated Relationships To Overcome Tight Supply in the Organic Market|last=Dimitri|first=Carolyn|last2=Oberholtzer|first2=Lydia|date=October 2008|website=|publisher=USDA|access-date=2016-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518010404/http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/192533/vgs32901.pdf|archive-date=18 May 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, there were 3,225 certified organic handlers, up from 2,790 in 2004.&lt;ref name="ers.usda.gov"&gt;Dimitri, Carolyn, and Lydia Oberholtzer. Marketing U.S. Organic Foods: Recent Trends From Farms to Consumers. Economic Information Bulletin No. 58. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Economic Research Service.

Organic handlers are often small firms; 48% reported sales below $1 million annually, and 22% between $1 and $5 million per year.&lt;ref name="Oberholtzer"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2008-september/us-organic-handlers-mostly-small,-focus-on-fruit-and-vegetables.aspx#.VxTnWRMrI6h|title=USDA Economic Research Service - U.S. Organic Handlers Mostly Small, Focus on Fruit and Vegetables|last=Oberholtzer|first=Carolyn Dimitri, Lydia|website=www.ers.usda.gov|access-date=2016-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426205152/http://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2008-september/us-organic-handlers-mostly-small,-focus-on-fruit-and-vegetables.aspx#.VxTnWRMrI6h|archive-date=26 April 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller handlers are more likely to sell to independent natural grocery stores and natural product chains whereas large distributors more often market to natural product chains and conventional supermarkets, with a small group marketing to independent natural product stores.&lt;ref name="ers.usda.gov"/&gt; Some handlers work with conventional farmers to convert their land to organic with the knowledge that the farmer will have a secure sales outlet. This lowers the risk for the handler as well as the farmer. In 2004, 31% of handlers provided technical support on organic standards or production to their suppliers and 34% encouraged their suppliers to transition to organic.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Smaller farms often join together in [[cooperative]]s to market their goods more effectively.

93% of organic sales are through conventional and natural food supermarkets and chains, while the remaining 7% of U.S. organic food sales occur through farmers' markets, [[foodservice]]s, and other marketing channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/natural-resources-environment/organic-agriculture/organic-market-overview.aspx|title=USDA Economic Research Service - Organic Market Overview|last=Greene|first=Catherine|website=www.ers.usda.gov|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Direct-to-consumer sales ====

In the 2012 Census, direct-to-consumer sales equaled $1.3 billion, up from $812 million in 2002, an increase of 60 percent. The number of farms that utilize direct-to-consumer sales was 144,530 in 2012 in comparison to 116,733 in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sustainableagriculture.net/blog/2012-census-organic-local/|title=2012 Census Drilldown: Organic and Local Food {{!}} National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition|website=sustainableagriculture.net|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct-to-consumer sales include farmers' markets, [[Community-supported agriculture|community supported agriculture]] (CSA), on-farm stores, and roadside farm stands. Some organic farms also sell products direct to retailer, direct to restaurant and direct to institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/138324/err128_2_.pdf|title=Direct and Intermediated Marketing of Local Foods in the United States|last=Low|first=Sarah|date=November 2011|website=|publisher=USDA|access-date=2016-04-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518003010/http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/138324/err128_2_.pdf|archive-date=18 May 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2008 Organic Production Survey, approximately 7% of organic farm sales were direct-to-consumers, 10% went direct to retailers, and approximately 83% went into wholesale markets. In comparison, only 0.4% of the value of convention agricultural commodities were direct-to-consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitri, Carolyn, Lydia Oberholtzer, and Michelle Wittenberger. The Role of Contracts in the Organic Supply Chain: 2004 and 2007, EIB-69, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, December 2010. http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/134484/eib69.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518004146/http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/134484/eib69.pdf |date=18 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not all products sold at farmer’s markets are certified organic, this direct-to-consumer avenue has become increasingly popular in local food distribution and has grown substantially since 1994. In 2014, there were 8,284 farmer’s markets in comparison to 3,706 in 2004 and 1,755 in 1994, most of which are found in populated areas such as the Northeast, Midwest, and West Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/detail.aspx?chartId=48561&amp;ref=collection&amp;embed=True|title=Number of U.S. farmers’ markets continues to rise|last=Vogel|first=Stephen|date=August 2014|publisher=USDA|access-date=2016-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426162736/http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/detail.aspx?chartId=48561&amp;ref=collection&amp;embed=True|archive-date=26 April 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Labor and employment ===

Organic production is more labor-intensive than conventional production.&lt;ref name=FAOFAQ&gt;Staff, FAO [http://www.fao.org/organicag/oa-faq/oa-faq5/en/ Organic Agriculture FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;  On the one hand, this increased labor cost is one factor that makes organic food more expensive.&lt;ref name=FAOFAQ/&gt;  On the other hand, the increased need for labor may be seen as an "employment dividend" of organic farming, providing more jobs per unit area than conventional systems.&lt;ref&gt;Green M and Maynard R. [http://orgprints.org/10178/1/The_employment_benefits_of_organic_farming.pdf The employment benefits of organic farming]  Aspects of Applied Biology 79, 2006; 51-55&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 UNEP Green Economy Report suggests that "[a]n increase in investment in green agriculture is projected to lead to growth in employment of about 60 per cent compared with current levels" and that "green agriculture investments could create 47 million additional jobs compared with BAU2 over the next 40 years."&lt;ref&gt;Citation used: UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) also argues that "[b]y greening agriculture and food distribution, more calories per person per day, more jobs and business opportunities especially in rural areas, and market-access opportunities, especially for developing countries, will be available."

=== World's food security ===

In 2007 the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) said that organic agriculture often leads to higher prices and hence a better income for farmers, so it should be promoted. However, FAO stressed that by organic farming one could not feed the current mankind, even less the bigger future population. Both data and models showed then that organic farming was far from sufficient. Therefore, chemical fertilizers were needed to avoid hunger.&lt;ref name=fao&gt;[http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2007/1000726/index.html Organic agriculture can contribute to fighting hunger - But chemical fertilizers needed to feed the world], [[FAO]], 10 December 2007, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; Other analysis by many agribusiness executives, agricultural and ecological scientists, and international agriculture experts revealed the opinion that organic farming would not only increase the world's food supply, but might be the only way to eradicate hunger.&lt;ref name="Halweil"&gt;{{cite web|last=Halweil|first=Brian|title=Can Organic Farming Feed Us All?|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/4060|publisher=World Watch Magazine|accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FAO stressed that fertilizers and other chemical inputs can much increase the production, particularly in Africa where fertilizers are currently used 90% less than in Asia.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; For example, in Malawi the yield has been boosted using seeds and fertilizers.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; FAO also calls for using [[biotechnology]], as it can help smallholder farmers to improve their income and food security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/202820/icode/ Overcoming smallholder challenges with biotechnology], FAO, 29 October 2013, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capacity building in developing countries ===

Organic agriculture can contribute to ecological sustainability, especially in poorer countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ICapacity Building Study 3: Organic Agriculture and Food Security in East Africa | publisher = University of Essex | url = http://www.unep-unctad.org/cbtf/events/dsalaam2/Organic%20Agriculture%20and%20Food%20Security%20in%20East%20Africa%20FINAL%20May07.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071201140714/http://www.unep-unctad.org/cbtf/events/dsalaam2/Organic%20Agriculture%20and%20Food%20Security%20in%20East%20Africa%20FINAL%20May07.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2007-12-01 | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of organic principles enables employment of local resources (e.g., local seed varieties, manure, etc.) and therefore cost-effectiveness.

Organic agriculture is knowledge intensive. Globally, capacity building efforts are underway, including localized training material, to limited effect. As of 2007, the [[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements]] hosted more than 170 free manuals and 75 training opportunities online.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In 2008 the [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) stated that "organic agriculture can be more conducive to food security in Africa than most conventional production systems, and that it is more likely to be sustainable in the long-term"&lt;ref name=UNEP2008&gt;UNEP-UNCTAD. (2008). Organic Agriculture and Food Security in Africa. United Nations.

==== Millennium Development Goals ====

The value of organic agriculture (OA) in the achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDG), particularly in poverty reduction efforts in the face of climate change, is shown by its contribution to both income and non-income aspects of the MDGs. These benefits are expected to continue in the post-MDG era. A series of case studies conducted in selected areas in Asian countries by the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) and published as a book compilation by ADB in Manila document these contributions to both income and non-income aspects of the MDGs. These include poverty alleviation by way of higher incomes, improved farmers' health owing to less chemical exposure, integration of sustainable principles into rural development policies, improvement of access to safe water and sanitation, and expansion of global partnership for development as small farmers are integrated in value chains.&lt;ref name="E&amp;S"&gt;[http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/161042/organic-agriculture-and-post-2015-development-goals.]{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} Setboonsarng, S.

A related ADBI study also sheds on the costs of OA programs and set them in the context of the costs of attaining the MDGs. The results show considerable variation across the case studies, suggesting that there is no clear structure to the costs of adopting OA. Costs depend on the efficiency of the OA adoption programs. The lowest cost programs were more than ten times less expensive than the highest cost ones. However, further analysis of the gains resulting from OA adoption reveals that the costs per person taken out of poverty was much lower than the estimates of the World Bank,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;World Bank. 2008.

== Disadvantages ==

Agriculture imposes negative externalities (uncompensated costs) upon society through public land and other public resource use, biodiversity loss, erosion, pesticides, nutrient runoff, subsidized water usage, subsidy payments and assorted other problems. Positive externalities include self-reliance, entrepreneurship, respect for nature, and air quality. Organic methods reduce some of these costs.&lt;ref name=Marshall1991&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Marshall | first = G. | year = 1991 | title= Organic Farming: Should Government Give it More Technical Support? |journal = Review of Marketing and Agricultural Economics | volume = 59 | issue = 3 | pages = 283–296 | url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/12390/1/59030283.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 uncompensated costs for 1996 reached 2,343 million British pounds or £208 per ha (£84.20/ac).&lt;ref name=Pretty2000&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Pretty| year = 2000| title = An assessment of the total external costs of UK agriculture| journal = Agricultural Systems| volume = 65| issue = 2| pages = 113–136| doi = 10.1016/S0308-521X(00)00031-7| url = http://www.essex.ac.uk/bs/staff/pretty/AgSyst%20pdf.pdf| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5p4udiKF2?url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/bs/staff/pretty/AgSyst%20pdf.pdf| archivedate = 18 April 2010| first1 = J| last2 = Brett| first2 = C.| last3 = Gee| first3 = D.| last4 = Hine| first4 = R.E.| last5 = Mason| first5 = C.F.| last6 = Morison| first6 = J.I.L.| last7 = Raven| first7 = H.| last8 = Rayment| first8 = M.D.| last9 = Van Der Bijl| first9 = G. &lt;!--exactly 9 authors--&gt;| display-authors = etal| deadurl = yes| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of practices in the US published in 2005 concluded that cropland costs the economy approximately 5 to 16 billion dollars ($30–96/ha – $12–39/ac), while livestock production costs 714 million dollars.&lt;ref name=Tegtmeier2005&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Tegtmeier | first1 = E.M. | last2 = Duffy | first2 = M. | year = 2005 | title = External Costs of Agricultural Production in the United States | journal = The Earthscan Reader in Sustainable Agriculture | url = http://www.organicvalley.coop/fileadmin/pdf/ag_costs_IJAS2004.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both studies recommended reducing externalities. The 2000 review included reported pesticide poisonings but did not include speculative chronic health effects of pesticides, and the 2004 review relied on a 1992 estimate of the total impact of pesticides.

It has been proposed that organic agriculture can reduce the level of some negative externalities from (conventional) agriculture. Whether the benefits are private or public depends upon the division of property rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= New Zealand's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry | title= A Review of the Environmental/Public Good Costs and Benefits of Organic Farming and an Assessment of How Far These Can be Incorporated into Marketable Benefits | work=  | url= http://www.maf.govt.nz/mafnet/rural-nz/sustainable-resource-use/organic-production/organic-farming-in-nz/org10005.htm | accessdate= 20 April 2008 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081015111550/http://www.maf.govt.nz/mafnet/rural-nz/sustainable-resource-use/organic-production/organic-farming-in-nz/org10005.htm | archivedate= 15 October 2008 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several surveys and studies have attempted to examine and compare conventional and organic systems of farming and have found that organic techniques, while not without harm, are less damaging than conventional ones because they reduce levels of biodiversity less than conventional systems do and use less energy and produce less waste when calculated per unit area.&lt;ref&gt;Stolze, M.; Piorr, A.; Häring, A.M. and Dabbert, S.

A 2003 to 2005 investigation by the [[Cranfield University]] for the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] in the UK found that it is difficult to compare the [[Global warming potential]], acidification and eutrophication emissions but "Organic production often results in increased burdens, from factors such as N leaching and N2O emissions", even though primary energy use was less for most organic products. N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is always the largest global warming potential contributor except in tomatoes. However, "organic tomatoes always incur more burdens (except pesticide use)". Some emissions were lower "per area", but organic farming always required 65 to 200% more field area than non-organic farming. The numbers were highest for bread wheat (200+ % more) and potatoes (160% more).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.organicagcentre.ca/ResearchDatabase/res_enviro_burdens.asp Determining the environmental burdens and resource use in the production of agricultural and horticultural commodities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329093718/http://www.organicagcentre.ca/ResearchDatabase/res_enviro_burdens.asp |date=29 March 2014 }}, Williams, A.G. et al., Cranfield University, U.K., August 2006.

Researchers at Oxford University analyzed 71 peer-reviewed studies and observed that organic products are sometimes worse for the environment.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;[http://people.forestry.oregonstate.edu/steve-strauss/sites/people.forestry.oregonstate.edu.steve-strauss/files/Organic%20farms%20not%20necessarily%20better%20for%20environment%20-%20University%20of%20Oxford_2012.pdf Organic farms not necessarily better for environment], University of Oxford, 4 Sep 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Organic milk, cereals, and pork generated higher [[greenhouse gas]] emissions per product than conventional ones but organic beef and olives had lower emissions in most studies.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; Usually organic products required less energy, but more land.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; Per unit of product, organic produce generates higher nitrogen leaching, nitrous oxide emissions, ammonia emissions, [[eutrophication]], and acidification potential than conventionally grown produce.&lt;ref name=tuomisto&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1907461/Does_organic_farming_reduce_environmental_impacts_-_A_meta-analysis_of_European_research Does organic farming reduce environmental impacts? - A meta-analysis of European research], H.L.

Critics of organic farming methods believe that the increased land needed to farm organic food could potentially destroy the rainforests and wipe out many ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Goldberg, Bob | title= The Hypocrisy of Organic Farmers | work=AgBioWorld | url=http://www.agbioworld.org/biotech-info/articles/biotech-art/hypocrisy.html | accessdate=10 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Leonard, Andrew | title= Save the rain forest -- boycott organic? | work=How The World Works | url=https://www.salon.com/2006/12/11/borlaug/ | accessdate=10 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nutrient leaching ===

According to a 2012 [[meta-analysis]] of 71 studies, nitrogen leaching, nitrous oxide emissions, ammonia emissions, eutrophication potential and acidification potential were higher for organic products,&lt;ref name=tuomisto/&gt; although in one study "nitrate leaching was 4.4–5.6 times higher in conventional plots than organic plots".&lt;ref name="PNAS 2006-3-21"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0600359103|last1=Kramer|first1=SB|last2=Reganold|first2=JP|last3=Glover |first3=JD|last4=Bohannan|first4=BJ|last5=Mooney|first5=HA|title=Reduced nitrate leaching and enhanced dentrifier activity and efficiency in organically fertilized soils|publisher=[[United States National Academy of Sciences]]|pages=4522–7|issue=12|volume=103 |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]|date=21 March 2006|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/103/12/4522#B2|accessdate=30 September 2007|pmid=16537377|pmc=1450204 |bibcode=2006PNAS..103.4522K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excess nutrients in lakes, rivers, and groundwater can cause [[algal blooms]], [[eutrophication]], and subsequent [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zones]]. In addition, [[nitrate]]s are harmful to aquatic organisms by themselves.&lt;ref name="Science 2001-04-13"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Forecasting Agriculturally Driven Global Climate Change|journal=Science|date=21 March 2006 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/292/5515/281?ijkey=bbb4cf6e526430899ecae63af4bbd319d226922e&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha|accessdate=30 September 2007|pmid=11303102|doi=10.1126/science.1057544|last1=Tilman|first1=D|last2=Fargione|first2=J|last3=Wolff|first3=B|last4=d'Antonio|first4=C|last5=Dobson|first5=A|last6=Howarth|first6=R|last7=Schindler|first7=D|last8=Schlesinger|first8=WH|last9=Simberloff|first9=D|volume=292|issue=5515|pages=281–4 |bibcode = 2001Sci...292..281T|last10=Swackhamer|first10=D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Land use ===

The Oxford meta-analysis of 71 studies found that organic farming requires 84% more land for an equivalent amount of harvest, mainly due to lack of nutrients but sometimes due to weeds, diseases or pests, lower yielding animals and land required for fertility building crops.&lt;ref name=tuomisto/&gt; While organic farming does not necessarily save land for wildlife habitats and forestry in all cases,&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; the most modern breakthroughs in organic are addressing these issues with success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rodale Institute Farming Systems Trial|url=http://rodaleinstitute.org/our-work/farming-systems-trial/farming-systems-trial-30-year-report/|publisher=Rodale Institute|accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Undersander|first=Dan|title=Pastures for Profit: A Guide to Rotational Grazing|url=http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/A3529.PDF|work=University of Wisconsin|publisher=Cooperative extension publishing|accessdate=24 February 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Undersander|first=Dan|title=Grassland Birds: Fostering Habitats Using Rotational Grazing|url=http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/a3715.pdf|work=University of Wisconsin|publisher=Cooperative extension publishing|accessdate=24 February 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pesticides ===

[[File:Organic Apples Pateros WA cropped.jpg|thumb|A sign outside of an organic [[apple]] orchard in [[Pateros, Washington]] reminding orchardists not to spray pesticides on these trees]]

In organic farming synthetic pesticides are generally prohibited. A chemical is said to be synthetic if it does not already exist in the natural world. But the organic label goes further and usually prohibit compounds that exist in nature if they are produced by [[chemical synthesis]]. So the prohibition is also about the method of production and not only the nature of the compound.

A non-exhaustive list of organic approved pesticides with their [[median lethal dose]]s:

* [[Copper(II) sulfate]] is used as a fungicide and is also used in conventional agriculture ([[Copper(II) sulfate|LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 300 mg/kg]]). Conventional agriculture has the option to use the less toxic [[Mancozeb]] ([http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/haloxyfop-methylparathion/mancozeb-ext.html LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 4,500 to 11,200 mg/kg])
* [[Boric acid]] is used as stomach poison that target insects  (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 2660&amp;nbsp;mg/kg).
* [[Pyrethrin]] comes from chemicals extracted from flowers of the genus [[Pyrethrum]] ([http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/pyrethrins-ziram/pyrethrins-ext.html LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 370 mg/kg]). Its potent toxicity is used to control insects.
* [[Lime sulphur]] (aka calcium polysulfide) and sulfur are considered to be allowed, synthetic materials&lt;ref&gt;http://web.pppmb.cals.cornell.edu/resourceguide/pdf/resource-guide-for-organic-insect-and-disease-management.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 820&amp;nbsp;mg/kg)
* [[Rotenone]] is a powerful insecticide that was used to control insects (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 132&amp;nbsp;mg/kg). Despite the high toxicity of Rotenone to aquatic life and some links to Parkinson disease the compound is still allowed in organic farming as it is a naturally occurring compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/rotenone-organic-zb0z1405zsto.aspx|title=Use and Status of Rotenone in Organic Growing - Organic Gardening |publisher=MOTHER EARTH NEWS}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bromomethane]] is a gas that is still used in the nurseries of Strawberry organic farming&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/tomorrowstable/2011/09/25/organic-strawberries-are-not-g/|title=What makes an organically grown strawberry environmentally friendly? |publisher=Tomorrow's Table}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Azadirachtin]] is a wide spectrum very potent insecticide. Almost non toxic to mammals (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; in rats is &gt; 3,540&amp;nbsp;mg/kg) but affects beneficial insects.

While there may be some differences in the amounts of nutrients and anti-nutrients when organically produced food and conventionally produced food are compared, the variable nature of food production and handling makes it difficult to generalize results, and there is insufficient evidence to make claims that organic food is safer or healthier than conventional food.&lt;ref name=2014meta&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barański|first1=M|last2=Srednicka-Tober|first2=D|last3=Volakakis|first3=N|last4=Seal|first4=C|last5=Sanderson|first5=R|last6=Stewart|first6=GB|last7=Benbrook|first7=C|last8=Biavati|first8=B|last9=Markellou|first9=E|last10=Giotis|first10=C|last11=Gromadzka-Ostrowska|first11=J|last12=Rembiałkowska|first12=E|last13=Skwarło-Sońta |first13=K|last14=Tahvonen |first14=R|last15=Janovská|first15=D |last16=Niggli|first16=U|last17=Nicot|first17=P |last18=Leifert|first18=C |title=Higher antioxidant and lower cadmium concentrations and lower incidence of pesticide residues in organically grown crops: a systematic literature review and meta-analyses.|journal=The British Journal of Nutrition|date=26 June 2014|pages=1–18|pmid=24968103 |doi=10.1017/S0007114514001366 |volume=112 |issue=5 |pmc=4141693}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blair1"&gt;Blair, Robert.

=== Biodiversity ===
{{Main|Organic farming and biodiversity}}

The conservation of natural resources and biodiversity is a core principle of organic production. Three broad management practices (prohibition/reduced use of chemical pesticides and inorganic fertilizers; sympathetic management of non-cropped habitats; and preservation of mixed farming) that are largely intrinsic (but not exclusive) to organic farming are particularly beneficial for farmland wildlife.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Using practices that attract or introduce beneficial insects, provide habitat for birds and mammals, and provide conditions that increase soil biotic diversity serve to supply vital ecological services to organic production systems. Advantages to certified organic operations that implement these types of production practices include: 1) decreased dependence on outside fertility inputs; 2) reduced pest management costs; 3) more reliable sources of clean water; and 4) better pollination.&lt;ref name="Agricultural Marketing Service 2016"&gt;"USDSA Guidance Natural Resources and Biodiversity Conservation"(PDF).

Biodiversity from organic farming provides capital to humans. Species found in organic farms enhance sustainability by reducing human input (e.g., fertilizers, pesticides).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00390.x |year=2006 |displayauthors=1 |last1=Perrings|first1=C |last2=Jackson|first2=L |last3=Bawa|first3=K |last4=Brussaard|first4=L |last5=Brush|first5=S |last6=Gavin|first6=T |last7=Papa|first7=R |last8=Pascual|first8=U |last9=De Ruiter|first9=P |title=Biodiversity in Agricultural Landscapes: Saving Natural Capital without Losing Interest |journal=Conservation Biology|pmid=16903084 |volume=20|issue=2 |pages=263–264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) published a ''Federal Register'' notice on 15 January 2016, announcing the National Organic Program (NOP) final guidance on Natural Resources and Biodiversity Conservation for Certified Organic Operations. Given the broad scope of natural resources which includes soil, water, wetland, woodland and wildlife, the guidance provides examples of practices that support the underlying conservation principles and demonstrate compliance with USDA organic regulations § 205.200.&lt;ref name="Agricultural Marketing Service 2016"/&gt; The final guidance provides organic certifiers and farms with examples of production practices that support conservation principles and comply with the USDA organic regulations, which require operations to maintain or improve natural resources.&lt;ref name="Agricultural Marketing Service 2016"/&gt; The final guidance also clarifies the role of certified operations (to submit an OSP to a certifier), certifiers (ensure that the OSP describes or lists practices that explain the operator's monitoring plan and practices to support natural resources and biodiversity conservation), and inspectors (onsite inspection) in the implementation and verification of these production practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media/NOP%205020%20Biodiversity%20Guidance%20Rev01%20%28Final%29.pdf|title=USDSA Guidance Natural Resources and Biodiversity Conservation|date=15 January 2016|website=Agricultural Marketing Service, National Organic Program|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|access-date=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide range of organisms benefit from organic farming, but it is unclear whether organic methods confer greater benefits than conventional integrated agri-environmental programs.&lt;ref name="Hole et al. 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Does organic farming benefit biodiversity? |journal = Biological Conservation | volume = 122 | issue = 1 | pages = 113–130 | doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2004.07.018 |last1=Hole |first1=D.G. |last2=Perkins |first2=A.J. |last3=Wilson |first3=J.D. |last4=Alexander |first4=I.H. |last5=Grice |first5=P.V. |last6=Evans |first6=A.D. |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Organic farming is often presented as a more biodiversity-friendly practice, but the generality of the beneficial effects of organic farming is debated as the effects appear often species- and context-dependent, and current research has highlighted the need to quantify the relative effects of local- and landscape-scale management on farmland biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four key issues when comparing the impacts on biodiversity of organic and conventional farming: (1) It remains unclear whether a holistic whole-farm approach (i.e. organic) provides greater benefits to biodiversity than carefully targeted prescriptions applied to relatively small areas of cropped and/or non-cropped habitats within conventional agriculture (i.e. agri-environment schemes); (2) Many comparative studies encounter methodological problems, limiting their ability to draw quantitative conclusions; (3) Our knowledge of the impacts of organic farming in pastoral and upland agriculture is limited; (4) There remains a pressing need for longitudinal, system-level studies in order to address these issues and to fill in the gaps in our knowledge of the impacts of organic farming, before a full appraisal of its potential role in biodiversity conservation in agroecosystems can be made.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hole|first1=D.G.|last2=Perkins|first2=A.J.|last3=Wilson|first3=J.D.|last4=Alexander|first4=I.H.|last5=Grice|first5=P.V.|last6=Evans|first6=A.D.|title=Does organic farming benefit biodiversity?|journal=Biological Conservation|date=March 2005|volume=122|issue=1|pages=113–130|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2004.07.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition to Labor Standards ===
Organic agriculture is often considered to be more socially just and economically sustainable for farmworkers than conventional agriculture. However, there is little social science research or consensus as to whether or not organic agriculture provides better working conditions than conventional agriculture.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shreck|first=Aimee|last2=Getz|first2=Christy|last3=Feenstra|first3=Gail|date=2006-11-21|title=Social sustainability, farm labor, and organic agriculture: Findings from an exploratory analysis|journal=Agriculture and Human Values|volume=23|issue=4|pages=439–449|doi=10.1007/s10460-006-9016-2|issn=0889-048X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many consumers equate organic and sustainable agriculture with small-scale, family-owned organizations it is widely interpreted that buying organic supports better conditions for farmworkers than buying with conventional producers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Getz|first=Christy|last2=Brown|first2=Sandy|last3=Shreck|first3=Aimee|date=December 2008|title=Class Politics and Agricultural Exceptionalism in California's Organic Agriculture Movement|journal=Politics &amp; Society|volume=36|issue=4|pages=478–507|doi=10.1177/0032329208324709|issn=0032-3292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organic agriculture is generally more labor-intensive due to its dependence on manual practices for fertilization and pest removal and relies heavily upon hired, non-family farmworkers rather than family members. Although illnesses from synthetic inputs pose less of a risk, hired workers still fall victim to debilitating musculoskeletal disorders associated with agricultural work. The USDA certification requirements outline growing practices and ecological standards but do nothing to codify labor practices. Independent certification initiatives such as the Agricultural Justice Project, Domestic Fair Trade Working Group, and the Food Alliance have attempted to implement farmworker interests but because these initiatives require voluntary participation of organic farms, their standards cannot be widely enforced.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Sandy|last2=Getz|first2=Christy|date=May 2008|title=Privatizing farm worker justice: Regulating labor through voluntary certification and labeling|journal=Geoforum|volume=39|issue=3|pages=1184–1196|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2007.01.002|issn=0016-7185}}&lt;/ref&gt;Despite the benefit to farmworkers of implementing labor standards, there is little support among the organic community for these social requirements. Many actors of the organic industry believe that enforcing labor standards would be unnecessary&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;, unacceptable&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;, or unviable due to the constraints of the market.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Overengineering''' (or '''over-engineering''') is the act of designing a product to be more robust or have more features than necessary for its intended use, or for a process to be unnecessarily complex or inefficient.

Overengineering is often done to increase a [[factor of safety]], add function, or overcome perceived design flaws that most users would accept. Overengineering can be desirable when safety or performance is critical (e.g. in aerospace vehicles), or when extremely broad functionality is required (e.g. diagnostic tools), but it is generally criticized in terms of [[value engineering]] as wasteful of resources such as materials, time and money. As a [[design philosophy]], it is the opposite of the [[minimalist]] ethos of "less is more" and a violation of the [[KISS principle]].

Overengineering generally occurs in high-end products or specialized markets. In one form, products are ''overbuilt'' and have performance far in excess of expected normal operation (a city car that can travel at 300&amp;nbsp;km/h, or a home video recorder with a projected lifespan of 100 years), and hence are more expensive, bulkier, and heavier than necessary. Alternatively, they may become ''overcomplicated'' &amp;ndash; the extra functions may be unnecessary, and potentially reduce the [[usability]] of the product by overwhelming [[end user]]s.

Overengineering can decrease the [[productivity]] of the design team because of the need to build and maintain unwanted features.

A related issue is [[market segmentation]] &amp;ndash; making different products for different market segments. In this context, a particular product may be more or less suited (and thus considered over- or under-engineered) for a particular market segment.

== Cultural references ==
A story about very precise engineering is given in the 1858 story ''[[s:The Deacon's Masterpiece|The Deacon's Masterpiece or, the Wonderful "One-hoss Shay": A Logical Story]]'' by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]], which tells of a carriage ([[one-horse shay]])
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;That was built in such a logical way
It ran a hundred years to a day,
And then,
...
went to pieces all at once, --
All at once, and nothing first, --
Just as bubbles do when they burst.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Because it had been engineered so that no single piece failed first – no piece was over-engineered relative to the others, and they thus all collapsed at the same time.

A similar quote by [[Ferdinand Porsche]] claimed "the perfect [[Auto racing|race car]] crosses the finish line in first place and immediately falls into pieces."{{Citation needed|reason=Need reliable source to confirm Porsche said this.|date=March 2018}}

A modern example is [[Juicero]], a wi-fi "smart" juicing press. But after its release, [[Bloomberg News]] published a story that showed that the juice packs could be squeezed by hand faster than the press, and that hand-squeezing produced juice that was indistinguishable in quantity and quality from the output of the machine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-04-19/silicon-valley-s-400-juicer-may-be-feeling-the-squeeze|title=Silicon Valley’s $400 Juicer May Be Feeling the Squeeze|date=2017-04-19|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Several officially sanctioned antisemitic campaigns took place in the Soviet Union, most notably the [[Doctor's Plot]] and the struggle against the "[[rootless cosmopolitans]]". However, the entire Jewish population was never openly and officially declared the [[enemy of the people]].&lt;ref name="Sarnov"/&gt; Instead, several [[euphemism]]s were used, such as [[zionists]], [[rootless cosmopolitans]] and "persons of Jewish ethnicity". There was an important distinction between these words: ''zionist'' and ''rootless cosmopolitans'' served as a label for "bad Jews" as enemies of the state, whereas "persons of Jewish ethnicity" was a [[politically correct]] expression for good, loyal Jews who were called by some ordinary folks as ''trained'' Jews (the original Russian word "дресированные" (dressage) typically refers to animals trained to perform in circus).&lt;ref name="Sarnov"/&gt; However most people realized that all these euphemisms denoted ''all'' Jews.

A '''physical law''' or a '''law of [[physics]]''' is a statement "[[inferred]] from particular facts, applicable to a defined group or class of [[phenomena]], and expressible by the statement that a particular phenomenon always occurs if certain conditions be present."&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Law of nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical laws are typically conclusions based on repeated scientific [[experiment]]s and [[observations]] over many years and which have become accepted universally within the [[scientific community]]. The production of a summary description of our environment in the form of such laws is a fundamental aim of [[science]]. These terms are not used the same way by all authors.

The distinction between [[natural law]] in the political-legal sense and law of nature or physical law in the scientific sense is a modern one, both concepts being equally derived from ''[[physis]]'', the Greek word (translated into Latin as ''natura'') for ''nature''.&lt;ref&gt;Some modern philosophers, e.g. [[Norman Swartz]], use "physical law" to mean the laws of nature as they truly are and not as they are inferred by scientists. See Norman Swartz, ''The Concept of Physical Law'' (New York: Cambridge University Press), 1985. Second edition available online [https://www.sfu.ca/philosophy/physical-law/].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

Several general properties of physical laws have been identified. Physical laws are:

* True, at least within their regime of validity. By definition, there have never been repeatable contradicting observations.&lt;!--concept pre-existing in article--&gt;
* Universal. They appear to apply everywhere in the universe.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Paul|title=The mind of God : the scientific basis for a rational world|date=2005|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-0-671-79718-8|edition=1st Simon &amp; Schuster pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}}
* Simple. They are typically expressed in terms of a single mathematical equation.
* Absolute. Nothing in the universe appears to affect them.&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;{{rp|82}}
* Stable. Unchanged since first discovered (although they may have been shown to be approximations of more accurate laws—see "[[Physical law#Laws as approximations|Laws as approximations]]" below),
* Omnipotent. Everything in the universe apparently must comply with them (according to observations).&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;{{rp|83}}
* Generally [[Conservation law (physics)|conservative]] of quantity.&lt;ref name=Feynman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feynman|first1=Richard|title=The character of physical law|date=1994|publisher=Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=978-0-679-60127-2|edition=Modern Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|59}}
* Often expressions of existing homogeneities ([[symmetries]]) of [[space]] and time.&lt;ref name=Feynman/&gt;
* Typically theoretically reversible in time (if non-[[quantum mechanics|quantum]]), although [[arrow of time|time itself is irreversible]].&lt;ref name=Feynman/&gt;

== Examples ==
{{main|List of laws in science}}
{{See also|Scientific laws named after people}}

Some of the more famous laws of nature are found in [[Isaac Newton]]'s theories of (now) [[classical mechanics]], presented in his ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', and in [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]]. Other examples of laws of nature include [[Boyle's law]] of gases, [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation laws]], the four laws of [[thermodynamics]], etc.

==Laws as definitions==
Many scientific laws are couched in mathematical terms (e.g. [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Second law]] ''F'' = {{frac|dp|dt}}, or the [[uncertainty principle]], or the [[principle of least action]], or [[causality]]). While these scientific laws explain what our senses perceive, they are still empirical, and so are not "mathematical" laws. (Mathematical laws can be proved purely by mathematics and not by scientific experiment.)

== Laws being consequences of mathematical symmetries==
{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}
Other laws reflect mathematical symmetries found in Nature (say, [[Pauli exclusion principle]] reflects identity of electrons, conservation laws reflect [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] of [[space]], time, [[Lorentz transformations]] reflect rotational symmetry of [[space–time]]). Laws are constantly being checked experimentally to higher and higher degrees of precision. This is one of the main goals of science. Just because laws have never been observed to be violated does not preclude testing them at increased accuracy or in new kinds of conditions to confirm whether they continue to hold, or whether they break, and what can be discovered in the process. It is always possible for laws to be invalidated or proven to have limitations, by repeatable experimental evidence, should any be observed.

Well-established laws have indeed been invalidated in some special cases, but the new formulations created to explain the discrepancies can be said to generalize upon, rather than overthrow, the originals. That is, the invalidated laws have been found to be only close approximations (see below), to which other terms or factors must be added to cover previously unaccounted-for conditions, e.g. very large or very small scales of time or space, enormous speeds or masses, etc. Thus, rather than unchanging knowledge, physical laws are better viewed as a series of improving and more precise generalizations.

Many fundamental physical laws are mathematical consequences of various [[symmetries]] of space, time, or other aspects of nature. Specifically, [[Noether's theorem]] connects some conservation laws to certain symmetries. For example, conservation of energy is a consequence of the shift symmetry of time (no moment of time is different from any other), while conservation of momentum is a consequence of the symmetry (homogeneity) of space (no place in space is special, or different than any other). The indistinguishability of all particles of each fundamental type (say, electrons, or photons) results in the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Dirac]] and [[Bose–Einstein statistics|Bose]] quantum statistics which in turn result in the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] for [[fermion]]s and in [[Bose–Einstein condensation]] for [[boson]]s. The rotational symmetry between time and [[space]] coordinate axes (when one is taken as imaginary, another as real) results in [[Lorentz transformations]] which in turn result in [[special relativity]] theory. Symmetry between [[inertial]] and gravitational [[mass]] results in [[general relativity]].

The [[inverse square law]] of interactions mediated by massless bosons is the mathematical consequence of the 3-dimensionality of [[space]].

One strategy in the search for the most fundamental laws of nature is to search for the most general mathematical symmetry group that can be applied to the fundamental interactions.

== Laws as approximations ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Physical law]] --&gt;
Some laws are only approximations of other more general laws, and are good approximations with a restricted domain of applicability. For example, Newtonian dynamics (which is based on Galilean transformations) is the low-speed limit of special relativity (since the Galilean transformation is the low-speed approximation to the Lorentz transformation). Similarly, the Newtonian [[gravitation]] law is a low-mass approximation of general relativity, and Coulomb's law is an approximation to Quantum Electrodynamics at large distances (compared to the range of weak interactions). In such cases it is common to use the simpler, approximate versions of the laws, instead of the more accurate general laws.

== History ==
Compared to [[pre-industrial society|pre-modern]] accounts of [[causality]], laws of nature fill the role played by [[causality#Religion and theology|divine causality]] on the one hand, and accounts such as [[Plato]]'s [[theory of forms]] on the other.

The observation that there are underlying regularities in nature dates from [[prehistoric]] times, since the recognition of cause-and-effect relationships is an implicit recognition that there are laws of nature. The recognition of such regularities as independent scientific laws ''[[Per se (phrase)|per se]]'', though, was limited by their entanglement in [[animism]], and by the attribution of many effects that do not have readily obvious causes—such as [[meteorological]], [[astronomical]] and [[biological]] phenomena—to the actions of various [[deity|gods]], [[spirit]]s, [[supernatural being]]s, etc. Observation and speculation about nature were intimately bound up with metaphysics and morality.

In Europe, systematic theorizing about nature (''[[physis]]'') began with the early [[History of science in classical antiquity|Greek philosophers and scientists]] and continued into the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial]] periods, during which times the intellectual influence of Roman law increasingly became paramount.&lt;blockquote&gt;The formula "law of nature" first appears as "a live metaphor" favored by Latin poets [[Lucretius]], [[Virgil]], [[Ovid]], [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], in time gaining a firm theoretical presence in the prose treatises of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. Why this Roman origin? According to [historian and classicist Daryn] Lehoux's persuasive narrative,&lt;ref&gt;in Daryn Lehoux, ''What Did the Romans Know? An Inquiry into Science and Worldmaking'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2012), reviewed by David Sedley, "When Nature Got its Laws", ''Times Literary Supplement'' (12 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; the idea was made possible by the pivotal role of codified law and forensic argument in Roman life and culture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the Romans . . . the place par excellence where ethics, law, nature, religion and politics overlap is the law court. When we read Seneca's [[Naturales quaestiones|''Natural Questions'']], and watch again and again just how he applies standards of evidence, witness evaluation, argument and proof, we can recognize that we are reading one of the great Roman rhetoricians of the age, thoroughly immersed in forensic method. And not Seneca alone. Legal models of scientific judgment turn up all over the place, and for example prove equally integral to [[Ptolemy]]'s approach to verification, where the mind is assigned the role of magistrate, the senses that of disclosure of evidence, and dialectical reason that of the law itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sedley, "When Nature Got Its Laws", ''Times Literary Supplement'' (12 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The precise formulation of what are now recognized as modern and valid statements of the laws of nature dates from  the 17th century in Europe, with the beginning of accurate experimentation and development of advanced forms of mathematics.  During this period, [[Natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] such as [[Isaac Newton]] were influenced by a religious view which held that God had instituted absolute, universal and immutable physical laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/24/opinion/24davies.html|title=Taking Science on Faith|last=Davies|first=Paul|date=2007-11-24|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2012/05/08/3498202.htm|title=Christianity and the rise of western science|last=Harrison|first=Peter|date=8 May 2012|website=ABC|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In chapter 7 of ''[[The World (Descartes)|The World]]'', [[René Descartes]] described "nature" as matter itself, unchanging as created by God, thus changes in parts "are to be attributed to nature. The rules according to which these changes take place I call the 'laws of nature'."&lt;ref name="bertie.ccsu.edu7"&gt;{{cite web | title=Cosmological Revolution V: Descartes and Newton | website=bertie.ccsu.edu | url=http://bertie.ccsu.edu/naturesci/Cosmology/Cosmo5Newton.html | accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The modern [[scientific method]] which took shape at this time (with [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]) aimed at total separation of science from theology, with minimal speculation about [[metaphysics]] and ethics. [[Natural law]] in the political sense, conceived as universal (i.e., divorced from sectarian religion and accidents of place), was also elaborated in this period (by [[Grotius]], [[Spinoza]], and [[Hobbes]], to name a few).

== Other fields ==
Some [[Mathematics|mathematical]] [[theorem]]s and [[axiom]]s are referred to as laws because they provide logical foundation to empirical laws.

Examples of other observed phenomena sometimes described as laws include the [[Titius–Bode law]] of planetary positions, [[Zipf's law]] of linguistics, [[Moore's law]] of technological growth. Many of these laws fall within the scope of [[uncomfortable science]]. Other laws are pragmatic and observational, such as the [[law of unintended consequences]]. By analogy, principles in other fields of study are sometimes loosely referred to as "laws". These include [[Occam's razor]] as a principle of philosophy and the [[Pareto principle]] of economics.

'''Police brutality''' is one of several forms of [[police misconduct]] which involves undue [[violence]] by [[police]] members.
Widespread police brutality exists in many countries and territories, even those that prosecute it. Although illegal, it can be performed under the [[Color (law)|color of law]].&lt;ref name="policechiefmagazine.org"&gt;Martinelli TJ. (2007).

== History ==
The term "police brutality" was in use in the American press as early as 1872, when the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police Brutality: A Prisoner was shamefully beaten by Officers, he was Kicked and Pounded in a Cell ---Probably Fatally Injured|work=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=October 12, 1872}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported on the beating of a civilian under arrest at the Harrison Street Police Station.

The origin of 'modern' policing based on the authority of the [[nation state]] is commonly traced back to developments in seventeenth and 18th century [[France]], with [[Police#History|modern police departments]] being established in most nations by the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. [[Cases of police brutality]] appear to have been frequent then, with "the routine [[Wikt:bludgeon|bludgeoning]] of citizens by patrolmen armed with nightsticks or blackjacks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Marilynn S.|editor=Johnson|title=Street Justice: A History of Police Violence in New York City|year=2004|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=0-8070-5023-7|page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale incidents of brutality were associated with labor [[Strike action|strikes]], such as the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]], the [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894, the [[Lawrence textile strike]] of 1912, the [[Ludlow massacre]] of 1914, the [[Steel strike of 1919]], and the [[Hanapepe massacre]] of 1924.

Portions of the populations may perceive the police to be [[oppression|oppressors]]. In addition, there is a perception that victims of police brutality often belong to relatively powerless groups, such as minorities, the disabled, the young, and the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Powers|first=Mary D.|editor=Winters, Paul A.|title=Policing the Police|year=1995|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego|isbn=1-56510-262-2|pages=56–60|chapter=Civilian Oversight Is Necessary to Prevent Police Brutality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubert Locke writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;When used in print or as the battle cry in a [[black power]] rally, police brutality can by implication cover a number of practices, from calling a citizen by his or her first name to a death by a policeman's bullet. What the average citizen thinks of when he hears the term, however, is something midway between these two occurrences, something more akin to what the police profession knows as "alley court"—the wanton vicious beating of a person in custody, usually while [[handcuffs|handcuffed]], and usually taking place somewhere between the scene of the arrest and the [[Police station|station house]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=44|publisher=J. Urb. L.|page=625|date=1966–1967|title=Police Brutality and Civilian Review Boards: A Second Look|author=Locke, Hubert G.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/udetmr44&amp;section=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Kingbeating.jpg|thumb|Screenshots of [[Rodney King]] lying down and being beaten by [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers]] --&gt;
In March 1991, members of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] harshly beat an African American suspect, [[Rodney King]], while a white civilian videotaped the incident, leading to extensive media coverage and criminal charges against several of the officers involved. In April 1992, hours after the four police officers involved were acquitted at trial, the [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]] commenced, causing 53 deaths, 2,383 injuries, more than 7,000 fires, damage to 3,100 businesses, and nearly $1 billion in financial losses. After facing federal trial, two of the four officers were convicted and received 32-month prison sentences. The case was widely seen as a key factor in the reform of the Los Angeles Police Department.

According to data released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (2011), between 2003 and 2009 at least 4,813 people died in the process of being arrested by local police. Of the deaths classified as [[law enforcement]] homicides, 2,876 deaths occurred of which 1,643 or 57.1% of the people who died were "people of color".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kappeler|first=Victor|title=Being Arrested can be Hazardous to your Health, Especially if you are a Person of Color|url=http://plsonline.eku.edu/insidelook/being-arrested-can-be-hazardous-your-health-especially-if-you-are-person-color}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austria===

In Vienna there tends to be an association made between Vienna's drug problem and the city's African migrants. This has led to the existence of negative cultural stereotypes which have then led to the racial profiling of African migrants, due to the negative associations with their ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viennareview.net/news/austria/reactions-to-police-brutality|title=Reactions to Police Brutality|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of highly publicised incidents in Austria where police have either tortured, publicly humiliated, or violently beaten people - in some cases to the point of death. The most notorious of these incidents occurred in the late 1990s, however recent reports in 2015 show that police are still treating civilians in this way.

====Examples====

* '''24 April 1996:''' Mr Jevremovic, a Serbian Romani man, tried to pay a friend's parking fine and was harassed by police for it. He escaped, and later a large group of police came into his home without a warrant, and violently beat him and his wife before taking them both into custody. They were fined without reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.errc.org/article/romani-couple-beaten-by-police-in-Austria/1494|title=Romani Couple Beaten by Police in Austria - ERRC.org|website=www.errc.org|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''May 1996:''' Marcus Omofuma, an Illegal Nigerian immigrant, was being deported from Vienna when the officers taped him to his chair 'like a mummy' and stuck tape over his mouth. He suffocated whilst in police custody.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Austria: Incidents of Police Brutality Continue|last=|first=|date=24 March 2000|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''November 1998: ''' Dr. C, a black Austrian citizen, was stopped by police after reversing his car into a one-way street and asked, "Why are you driving the wrong way, nigger?". He was beaten unconscious and handcuffed. Police continued beating him after he regained consciousness. After he was arrested, he spent 11 days in hospital recovering.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
* ''' 28 July 2015:''' A 27-year-old man, suspected of being a pickpocket, was handcuffed and violently thrown to the ground whilst under police custody. Police said that the man had been injured whilst 'pressing his head against the wall.' Video evidence showed him being passive and compliant prior to the altercation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.at/20150811/video-shows-alleged-police-violence-in-vienna|title=Video shows alleged police violence in Vienna|date=2015-08-11|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cms.falter.at/falter/2015/08/11/polizei-luegen-und-ein-video/|title=Falter|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1 January 2015: ''' A middle-aged woman beaten and taken into custody after refusing a breathalyser test while walking home at night. She suffered a fractured coccyx and severe bruising to her head and knees. She filed a complaint and only after she found CCTV footage was the case reexamined by the prosecutor.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.at/20150313/video-of-police-arrest-shows-orgy-of-violence|title=Video of police arrest shows 'orgy of violence'|date=2015-03-13|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Police accountability ====

There has been a notable lack of commitment to addressing the violation of civilians' rights in Austria, with Amnesty International reporting that in 1998/1999 very few people who committed a violation of human rights were brought to justice. This was worsened by the fact that many people who made a complaint against police were brought up on counter-charges such as resisting arrest, defamation and assault.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; 
In 2014–2015, there were 250 accusations of police misconduct made against officers in Vienna, and not a single person was charged - however 1,329 people were charged with 'civil disorder' in a similar time period.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT)'s 2014 report included a number of complaints of police using excessive force with detainees and psychiatric patients. The culture of excusing police officers for their misconduct has continued well into the present day, and any complaints of mistreatment are often met with inadequate investigations and judicial proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/europe/austria|title=Austria|website=Amnesty International USA|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/austria/report-austria/|title=Austria 2015/2016|website=www.amnesty.org|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Actions to combat====

Austria has legislation in place which makes hate speech against anyone's race, religion, nationality or ethnicity illegal.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/253033.pdf|title=Austria 2015 Human Rights Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=United States Bureau of Democracy and Labor|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws like this, which discourage discrimination, are able to help with altering public perceptions of different ethnic and cultural groups and subsequently reducing the number of racially motivated incidents of police brutality. Along with these efforts, Austria has a number of NGOs who are trying to implement programs which encourage positive cross-cultural relations, and more targeted programs such as racial sensitivity training for police. The Austrian police are also trying to find their own ways to prevent police brutality and to make the prosecution of police misconduct a smoother process.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

Starting in January 2016, Austrian police forces will be trialling the use of body cameras, which will be used to film their interactions with civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.at/20150817/austria-to-test-police-body-cameras|title=Austria to test police body cameras|date=2015-08-17|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hope is that this will make the prosecution of any officers who are excessively violent or forceful a lot easier as there will be solid evidence, and also that it will deter officers from behaving violently in the first place, as they will know they are being monitored. It is unsure how long the trial will last, however as of July 2016 it is still ongoing.

Incidents of police brutality seem to still be occurring at a consistent rate, however it is yet to be seen whether the trial of body cameras will make a difference to the number of incidents occurring or to the number of police who are prosecuted for misconduct. Additionally, there needs to be more work done by the government to break down negative social stereotypes that can lead to prejudice, racial profiling and the kind of aggressive hatred which is the driving force behind many instances of police brutality - the involvement of NGOs is valuable however the Austrian government needs to take a strong stance against abuse of power by police in order for real change to happen. One way to do this, as suggested by Amnesty International Austria, would be to disband the ''Bereitschaftspolizei'', Vienna's riot police, as these officers have frequently been involved with human rights violations and situations of police brutality.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Amnesty also suggest that Austria should adopt a National Action Plan against Racism (as is required by the 2001 Durban Declaration and Programme of Action) - something which they have previously refused to do.&lt;ref name="amnestyusa1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/annual-report-austria-2013|title=Annual Report: Austria 2013|website=Amnesty International USA|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a whole, Austria is moving slowly towards eradicating police brutality, however there needs to be much more done in order to ensure the rights of citizens are sufficiently protected.

=== Bangladesh ===
{{Expand section|date=February 2016}}
Many have been viciously beaten by police in [[Bangladesh]]. Various protesters were beaten with bats and sticks while protesting {{clarify span|text=to insult of Islam|explain=Were they protesting insults against Islam or were they protesting to insult Islam?|date=November 2018}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://progressbangladesh.com/police-brutality-and-corruption-on-steep-rise/|title=Police Brutality and Corruption on Steep Rise|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, a young man named Shamim Reja was killed by police in Sonargaon police station. The victim’s father claimed that his son was brutally tortured in the police station as the police wanted 6 lakh taka (BDT 600,000). Police investigated this and found the officer in charge Arup Torofar and SI Paltu Ghush and ASP Uttam Prashad guilty as charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://progressbangladesh.com/police-brutality-and-corruption-on-steep-rise/|title=Police Brutality and Corruption on Steep Rise {{!}} Progress Bangladesh|website=progressbangladesh.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shahbag, Bangladesh on January 26th, 2017, hundreds of protestors of Bangladesh India Friendship Power Company were taken into custody under extreme force by police officers. The protestors were violently mistreated. They were also struck by police officers, and had a water cannon, tear gas, and baton charges used on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Khan Chandan |first1=Md Shahnawaz |title=Our Silence on Police Brutality |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/star-weekend/opinion/our-silence-police-brutality-1355386 |website=thedailystar,net |accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belgium ===
Previously a three tier system, Belgian law enforcement now consists of two police forces operating on a federal and local level. While the two services remain independent, they integrate for purposes of recruitment and common training. This structural reform occurred in 2001 following a national parliamentary report into a series of paedophile murders which proved police negligence and severely diminished public confidence. Currently, approximately 33,000 local police and 900 civilians work across 196 regional police forces.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benoît|first=Majerus,|last2=Xavier|first2=Rousseaux,|date=2004-01-01|title=The World Wars and their Impact on the Belgian Police Systems|url=https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/1824|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations (UN) Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (1990) are replicated in Belgian law through The Criminal Code and the Police Functions Act.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; These principles dictate that use of force should be proportionate, appropriate, reported and delivered in a timely manner. However, the UN Human Rights Committee reported complaints of ill-treatment against both property and person by police escalated between 2005 and 2011, most commonly involving assault against persons no longer posing danger.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polis.osce.org/countries/details?item_id=8 |title=POLIS – Country Profiles of Participating and Partner States |website=polis.osce.org |access-date=2016-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517164252/http://polis.osce.org/countries/details?item_id=8 |archivedate=2016-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only this, but Belgian judicial authorities failed to notify national police watchdog, Committee P, of resulting criminal convictions against police. This is a direct breach of Belgian judicial procedure, as well as a failure to comply with Article 40 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/TBSearch.aspx?Lang=En&amp;CountryID=17&amp;ctl00_PlaceHolderMain_radResultsGridChangePage=4|title=Treaty bodies Search|website=tbinternet.ohchr.org|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extreme instance in January 2010 led to the death of Jonathan Jacob in Mortsel. The 26-year-old man was apprehended by local Mortsel police behaving strangely under the influence of amphetamines. Footage depicting how eight officers belonging to Antwerp police's Special Intervention Unit restrained and beat Jacob after he had been injected with a sedative has sparked public outrage. Jacob died from internal bleeding following the incident, but police claim they didn't make any mistakes and "acted carefully, respecting the necessary precautions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/News/1.1555242|title=Police brutality video sends shock wave through Belgium|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) convicted Belgium of human rights violations in a reverse judgement on the treatment of two brothers in custody who had been slapped. The Grand Chamber voiced its concern that, "A slap inflicted by a law-enforcement officer on an individual who is entirely under his control constitutes a serious attack on the individual's dignity".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberties.eu/en/news/ecthr-belgium-slapping-case-police-violence|title=Belgium Slapped for Police Slapping|last=Platform|first=European Liberties|website=Liberties.eu|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With cases such as these being downplayed by Belgian courts, the Belgian League of Human Rights (LDH) strive to fight police abuse through the Observatory of Police Violence (OBSPOL).&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obspol.be/|title=ObsPol – Observatoire des violences policières en Belgique|last=cressot|first=nicolas|website=www.obspol.be|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operating since 2013, OBSPOL collect testimonies on its website and create a safe space for victims of police brutality by informing them of their rights and strongly advocating to adapt public policy for victim protection.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

{{main cat|Police brutality in Brazil}}
{{further|Law enforcement in Brazil#Controversies}}

The Police in [[Brazil]] has a history of violence against the lower classes, which dates back to the nineteenth century, when it served primarily as an instrument of control over the mass of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, Thomas H.

"Armed Actors, Organised Violence and State Failure in Latin America" Zed Books, 1988. {{ISBN|1842774441}} - Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the second half of the twentieth century, the country experienced a strong urbanization, while over [[Brazilian military government|its last military dictatorship]], its police forces came under the responsibility of state governments, experiencing a strong process [[Military Police (Brazil)|of militarization]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrade, John.

===Chile===

In the recent years, [[Chile]]'s police force [[Carabineros de Chile]] has been under investigation because of various cases of power abuse and police brutality, especially towards students that participate in riots for better education, and the indigenous people [[Mapuche]], where there have been countless cases of violence to this group, guilting them for committing crimes. It was later discovered that some Carabineros officers were responsible for this crimes, to then blame Mapuches for the various incidents

====Mapuche genocide====

One of the most recent cases involving Mapuche kill spree was [[Camilo Catrillanca]]'s death. First reports of his death came from Carabineros itself, saying that Camilo was shooting at a police officer along other people after an investigation of 3 stolen cars, in which Camilo was a supposed suspect of involvement in this robbery. Carabinero's special forces '''Comando Jungla''' have been in the [[Araucanía Region]] on a mission of finding terrorists (as an excuse for killing Mapuches indiscriminately), and one of them was finding the robbers of the three cars. After finding Camilo "attacking" policemen with a gun in an attempt of escaping, was shot and killed by a headshot. It was later discovered that this wasn't what happened after one of the partners of the police officer that killed Camilo showed the video of the policeman killing him while he was driving a tractor. It was then asked to Carabineros why he didn't have a recording of him being shot at by Camilo. The institution responded, saying that he destroyed the SD card because it had private photos and videos with his wife. Most people were not satisfied with the answer and everyone knew it was a lie to cover what really happened. The policeman was later discharged and prosecuted. &lt;ref&gt;[[Rodrigo Acuña]].

From 1991 to 1995, the Croatian police were a militarised force, charged with the role of defending the country during the secession from Yugoslavia, in addition to their regular police tasks.&lt;ref name="Ivkovic 2005, pp. 546"&gt;Ivkovic, S 2005, 'Police (mis)behaviour: a cross-cultural study of corruption seriousness', Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies &amp; Management, vol. 28, no. 3, pp. 546–566, doi: 10.1108/13639510510614609&lt;/ref&gt; Military training taught police officers to use firearms before exhausting other procedures, which has affected the philosophy and behaviour of police officers in using excessive force.&lt;ref name="Ivkovic, S 2000, pp. 194"&gt;Ivkovic, S &amp; Haberfeld, M 2000, 'Transformation from militia to police in Croatia and Poland – A comparative perspective', Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies &amp; Management, vol. 23, no. 2, pp. 194–217, doi: 10.1108/13639510010333831&lt;/ref&gt; Significant developments have been made to achieve democratic policing in a modern, professional force that is also accountable to the public.&lt;ref name="Ivkovic, S 2000, pp. 194"/&gt; However, citizen complaints of violent police behaviour suggest that the militarisation of the police force in the early 1990s continues to influence the level of force accepted as legitimate and reasonable by Croatian police officers.&lt;ref name="Ivkovic 2005, pp. 546"/&gt;

On numerous occasions the European Court of Human Rights has found that Croatian police authorities have failed to fulfil their obligations under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms by failing to carry out effective investigations to protect its citizens, and tourists, from violent attacks.&lt;ref name="irb-cisr.gc.ca"&gt;Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada 2015, Croatia: Police Structure, including hierarchy and jurisdiction; police effectiveness, particularly regarding treatment of ethnic minorities (2012-June 2014), HRV104892.E, viewed 19 July 2016, http://irb-cisr.gc.ca/Eng/ResRec/RirRdi/Pages/index.aspx?doc=455395&amp;pls=1&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the European Court of Human Rights delivered a judgement condemning Croatian police authorities for failing to take any steps to bring perpetrators of a violent attack on a Croatian citizen to justice by ignoring requests to conduct an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;European Roma Rights Centre 2009, Court condemns Croatia for failing to fulfil its positive obligations under Article 3 of the ECHR, viewed 20 July 2016, http://www.errc.org/article/court-condemns-croatia-for-failing-to-fulfill-its-positive-obligations-under-article-3-of-the-echr/3041&lt;/ref&gt;

The Croatian police have a history of discriminatory abuse and failing to recognise violence against the ethnic minority Romani population living in Croatia. The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance has noted that Croatian police abuse against minority groups including Roma people are continually reported.&lt;ref&gt;Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada 2015, Croatia: Treatment of minority groups, including Roma, Serbs, Bosnians, and Romanians; state protection available in cases of violence and discrimination, including legislation (2012-June 2015), HRV105202.E, viewed 19 July 2016, http://www.refworld.org/docid/55bf4ac04.html&lt;/ref&gt; There is an ongoing reluctance by police authorities to take violence against Roma seriously.&lt;ref name="irb-cisr.gc.ca"/&gt; Police investigations into black market selling in Croatia have been excessively violent towards Romani vendors, with reports of physical violence and abusive racism being directed at Roma.&lt;ref name="errc.org"&gt;European Roma Rights Centre 2002, Police beat pregnant Romani woman in Croatia, viewed 20 July 2016, http://www.errc.org/article/police-beat-pregnant-romani-woman-in-croatia/1582&lt;/ref&gt; Romani Women's Association, "Better Future", reported in 2002 that police had beaten a pregnant Romani woman who attempted to evade arrest for black market selling.&lt;ref name="errc.org"/&gt;

Croatian police violence has been used to intimidate refugees travelling from Serbia into Croatia.&lt;ref name="moving-europe.org"&gt;Moving Europe 2016, Report of Push-backs and Police violence at the Serbo-Croatian border, viewed 20 July 2016, http://moving-europe.org/report-on-push-backs-and-police-violence-at-the-serbo-croatian-border-2/&lt;/ref&gt; This has included segregation of nationalities, with Syrian, Iraqi and Afghani nationals gaining entry to Croatia as refugees much more easily than other nationalities.&lt;ref name="moving-europe.org"/&gt; An unaccompanied sixteen-year-old from Morocco recounted his experience in attempting to gain asylum in Croatia after lying about being a Syrian national: "We had to get into a police car…They told us this is Slovenia, but then it was Serbia…One of my friends tried to run away, but the Croatian police caught [sic] him and beat him."&lt;ref name="moving-europe.org"/&gt; Police beatings are illustrative of the systemic discriminatory violence that exists within the Croatian police force.

=== Denmark ===
[[Denmark]] currently has a police force consisting of approximately 11,000 officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Police: Organisation|url=https://www.politi.dk/en/About_the_police/organisation/|website=Politi|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These officers serve with the Danish National Police, in the 12 police districts and in the two Danish overseas territories. The Danish Independent Police Complaints Authority (Den Uafhængige Politiklagemyndighed) (the Authority) handles the investigation of police misconduct allegations.&lt;ref name="politiklagemyndigheden.dk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Police Complaints Authority|url=http://politiklagemyndigheden.dk/english|website=Den Uafhængige Politiklagemyndighed|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Annual statistics released by the Authority reveal a reduction in the number of complaints against police during the period from 2012 until 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adfaerdsklager|url=http://politiklagemyndigheden.dk/udgivelser-og-tal/politikredsstatistik/adfaerdsklager|website=Den Uafhængige Politiklagemyndighed|accessdate=18 July 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in 2012, the Authority received a total of 726 conduct complaints from across Denmark. However, in 2015, this number had fallen to 509. This represents approximately 0.05 complaints per officer. A majority of complaints extend from general misconduct, such as traffic violations and unprofessional behaviour (e.g. swearing).&lt;ref name="politiklagemyndigheden1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Arsberetning 2015|url=http://politiklagemyndigheden.dk/media/15820/a_rsberetning_2015_netversion.pdf|publisher=Den Uafhængige Politiklagemyndighed (Independent Police Complaints Authority)|accessdate=18 July 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the 2015 Annual Report does identify some instances where the [[Police of Denmark]] have used excessive force.&lt;ref name="politiklagemyndigheden1"/&gt;  For example, the Authority is currently investigating a complaint made about alleged violence against an arrested person in Christianshavn on 15 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Politiklagemyndigheden søger vidner til en episode på Christianshavn, hvor en polititjenestemand er anmeldt for vold|url=http://politiklagemyndigheden.dk/nyheder/pressemeddelelser-nyheder/2016/4/politiklagemyndigheden-soeger-vidner-til-en-episode-paa-christianshavn,-hvor-en-polititjenestemand-er-anmeldt-for-vold|website=Den Uafhængige Politiklagemyndighed|accessdate=18 July 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another open investigation relates to the alleged use of force against a 16-year-old boy on 28 June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polititjenestemænd sigtet for vold begået mod en 16-årig dreng|url=http://politiklagemyndigheden.dk/nyheder/pressemeddelelser-nyheder/2016/6/polititjenestemaend-sigtet-for-vold-begaaet-mod-en-16-aarig-dreng|website=Den Uafhængige Politkilagemyndighed|accessdate=18 July 2016|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has resulted in charges being laid against the two offending police officers from the Sydsjællands- and Lolland-Falster police department. Furthermore, although examples of police brutality are not common, highly publicised incidents have been reported.

====Examples====

In 2002, 21 year-old Jens Arne Orskov Mathiason died while in police custody and on the way to prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Denmark: Jens Arne Ørskov's death in custody: A mother's quest for justice|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/44c610894.html|website=refworld|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=18 July 2016|pages=1–6|date=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The incident raised concerns over the behaviour of the officers involved, the thoroughness of the subsequent investigation and the willingness of the Director of Public Prosecutions' to hold the officers accountable for their alleged failings. As a result, [[Amnesty International]] has called for the establishment of new mechanisms to investigate human rights violations and to enforce compliance with obligations under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Denmark: Jens Arne Ørskov's death in custody: A mother's quest for justice|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/44c610894.html|website=refworld|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=18 July 2016|page=6|date=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, another man died in police custody after being arrested by seven officers from the Copenhagen Police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man died while in custody of Danish police|url=http://www.thelocal.dk/20160108/man-died-while-in-custody-of-danish-police|accessdate=18 July 2016|agency=The Local DK|date=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, police in Copenhagen were heavily criticised for their response to an attempt to dislodge Iraqi refugees who were living in a city church.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Matthew Saltmarsh|author2=Catherine Contiguglia|title=Raid in Denmark to Dislodge Iraqi Refugees Leads to Protests and Hunger Strike|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/15/world/europe/15denmark.html|accessdate=18 July 2016|agency=New York Times|date=14 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Amateur video allegedly showed the police using violence against the refugees and their supporters. Between 12,000 and 20,000 people subsequently protested against these actions.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;

In 2012, the [[Courts of Denmark|Danish Court of Appeal]] held that the Danish Police had violated Article 3 (against abusive treatment and torture) and Articles 5, 10 and 11 (dealing with the right to liberty, the right to information about the accusation and the freedom of peaceful assembly) of the European Convention of Human Rights, when, in 2009, they had made mass arrests during protests at the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police found guilty of violating European Convention on Human Rights|url=http://www.socialistworld.net/doc/5713|accessdate=18 July 2016|agency=SocialistWorld.net|date=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, video emerged of officers hitting people with batons and violently detaining a man, despite onlookers saying he couldn't breathe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Police hit everyone': Danish officers use batons on citizens, violently detain man|url=https://www.rt.com/news/341364-police-brutality-copenhagen-denmark/|accessdate=18 July 2016|agency=Russia Today|date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prevention====

In order to ensure that police are well trained and to mitigate the risk of police brutality, police recruits undergo approximately three years of training. Firstly, at the National Police College, recruits learn about police theory, the Road Traffic Act, criminal law, physical training, other legislation, first aid, radio communication, securing evidence, identifying drugs, preventing crime, management, human rights and cultural sociology to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Police: How to become a police officer|url=https://www.politi.dk/en/About_the_police/admission/|website=Politi|publisher=Politi|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After this three-year probationary and training period, recruits are promoted to the position of police constable. By comparison, US police academies only provide an average of 19 weeks of classroom instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Paul Hirschfield|title=Why American Cops Kill So Many Compared To European Cops|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/american-cops-lethal_us_565cde59e4b079b2818b8870|accessdate=18 July 2016|agency=Huffington Post|date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This lengthy training in Denmark increases the ability of police to effectively de-escalate conflicts and enact their duties professionally and responsibly.

Furthermore, in order to keep police officers accountable and to ensure that they perform their duties in compliance with Danish, European and international laws, the Independent Police Complaints Authority has the power to handle investigations of criminal cases against police officers and decide complaints of police misconduct.&lt;ref name="politiklagemyndigheden.dk" /&gt;  This body is independent of both the police and prosecutors. By way of example, police:

{{Quote|text="...may use force only if necessary and justified and only by such means and to such extent as are reasonable relative to the interest which the police seek to protect. Any assessment of the justifiability of such force must also take into account whether the use of force involves any risk of bodily harm to third parties."|author=''Act on Police Activities'' (2004)|source=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Frode Z. Olsen|title=The Use of Police Firearms in Denmark|url=https://www.politi.dk/NR/rdonlyres/20DE43AF-33F4-48C5-A710-6A58457E35D2/0/Engelskresum%C3%A9afendeligrapport.pdf|website=Politi|publisher=Politi|accessdate=18 July 2016|page=2|language=English|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Therefore, police in Denmark are held to high standards and will face consequences if they breach their obligations. This encourages compliance. Victims of police misconduct are encouraged to lodge a report with the Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do you want to complain about the police?|url=http://politiklagemyndigheden.dk/media/6447/1._korr_pm_pjece_uk.pdf|publisher=Den Uafhængige Politiklagemyndighed (Independent Police Complaints Authority) |accessdate=18 July 2016|pages=1–14|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Estonia ===
The [[Estonian Police]] force ended in 1940 when they lost their independence to the Soviet Union.  The Police Act which was passed in 1990, set out the dissolution of the Russian Military and re-established the formation of the Estonian Police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polis.osce.org/countries/details?item_id=16 |title=POLIS – Country Profiles of Participating and Partner States |website=polis.osce.org |access-date=2016-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816074034/http://polis.osce.org/countries/details?item_id=16 |archivedate=2016-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Public Order Police, Police Board, Central Criminal Police, Border Guard, Citizenship and Migration Board merged into one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/Member-countries/Europe/Estonia|title=Estonia / Europe / Member countries / Internet / Home – INTERPOL|website=www.interpol.int|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence forming The Police and Border Guard Board. It is the currently the largest state agency in Estonia, with more than 5000 people in employment.  The main objectives for this organisation is to maintain security and public order, crime prevention, detection and investigation, securing the European Union (EU) border, citizenship and identity documentation administration.

According to the Estonian Ministry of Justice, crime figures have dropped by 10% since 2013 to 2015.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osac.gov/pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=17447|title=Estonia 2015 Crime and Safety Report|website=www.osac.gov|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who find themselves detained by the police should comply with their instructions. Those who experience a language barrier are allowed to "request the presence of an interpreter and should not sign any documents or reports until they are confident that the documents contents are consistent with the details of the incident or the victim's statement"&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Incidents of police abuse are very rare, however if it is witnessed, report it to the Office of Procurator General of Estonia. Although uncommon, powers are sometimes abused and hence this leads to brutality from police officers.  An example of this, is the riots that took place in 2007.
[[File:Bronze Soldier of Tallinn, 2007.jpg|thumb|The Bronze Soldier of Tallinn in its new location]]

==== Case example ====
The controversy and riots, more commonly referred to as the '[[Bronze Night]]' that surrounded Estonia in April 2007 when the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn was relocated.  The Government wanted to relocate the statue and rebury the associated remains near the Tallinn Military Cemetery; however, this led to massive uproar and protests. Historically in Estonia this Bronze Soldier served as a symbol of Soviet occupation and repression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russiaprofile.org/page.php?pageid=Culture+%26+Living&amp;articleid=a1230646924 |title=The Memory Remains |last=Johnston |first=Anthony |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=20 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812073257/http://www.russiaprofile.org/page.php?pageid=Culture%2B&amp;%2BLiving&amp;articleid=a1230646924 |archivedate=12 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, to its current Russian citizens residing, it also represented Soviet's victory over Germany in World War II and their claim to equal rights in Estonia.
During the riots, one Russian rioter was killed and many other protesters were arrested.  Due to the overcrowded detention centres many of the detainees were taken to cargo terminals in Tallinn's seaport.  Andrei Zarenkov who was the chairman of the [[Constitution Party (Estonia)|Constitution Party]] stated "people were forced to squat for hours or lie on the concrete floor with their hands tied behind their backs. The police used plastics handcuffs which caused great pain. The police selectively beat the detainees including women and teenagers. We have pictures of a toilet which is stained with blood of the injured"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=2975|title=Interfax-Religion|last=|first=|date=1 May 2007|website=Ethnic Russians quit Estonian police to stay away from violence – public figure|agency=Interfax|access-date=20 July 2016|quote=Paragraph 6 -7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police department denied all claims made against them. On the 22nd of May 2007, the Office of Procurator General of Estonia received more than fifty complaints on the police brutality that occurred during Bronze Night and hence opened seven criminal cases against them.  In November 2007, the [[United Nations Committee against torture|United Nations Committee Against Torture]] expressed concern over the excessive use of force and brutality by law enforcement personnel with regards to the Bronze night incident.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}  The Council of Europe published in its report, that those detained were not granted all the fundamental safeguards. This includes the right to access a doctor, a lawyer and to inform a relative or a third party of their arrest. Furthermore, it was later discovered that accused were only allowed to contact someone and be assisted by a lawyer when brought before a judge and a number of detainees were denied access to a doctor whilst in police custody even though they displayed visible injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1549981/500-held-in-fresh-Estonia-riots.html|title=500 held in fresh Estonia riots|last=agencies|first=By staff and|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Moving forward ====
The use of excessive force can be seen as "legal boundaries/ duty" in the eyes of policing agencies.  Police misconduct is regarded as illegal in many countries; it can be hidden when performed under the 'colour of law'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/221885.The_Color_of_Law|title=The Color of Law|last=Gimenez|first=Mark|publisher=Anchor|year=2006|isbn=|location=Dallas, Texas, US|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although police brutality is fairly uncommon in Estonia, it is vital that the Police and Border Guard Board to keep the fundamental safeguards in check and not breach these rights, regardless of the situation.

=== France ===
The policing structure of nineteenth century [[France]] has been linked to the outcomes of France's reorganisation during 1789–1799 which were France's time of revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/clive-emsley/french-police-19th-century |title=The French Police in the 19th Century |publisher=History Today |date=1982-01-01 |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout France's history, there has been a wide array of instances of violent enforcement stemming from issues around racial and geographic differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefunambulist.net/2016/05/31/police-brutality-is-a-hollow-term-on-current-violence-in-france/ |title="Police Brutality Is a Hollow Term": On the Current Policing Violence in France |work=The Funambulist |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, there have been reports conducted by the Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International concerning human rights violations by France including physical and psychological abuse as a result of excessive force towards Muslims when undertaking house raids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/02/french-police-abuse-muslims-emergency-laws-160204035243925.html |title=French police 'abuse' Muslims under emergency laws |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2016-02-04 |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France's police ombudsman is currently dealing with 48 judicial inquiries into police brutality against its citizens, in which 1,000 individuals have been arrested, within a three-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Angelique Chrisafis in Paris |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/07/french-police-violence-labour-law-protests-watchdog |title=French police watchdog looks into violence at labour protests &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, there have been a number of high profile cases of alleged police brutality which have gained significant media attention, including, the death of Lamine Dieng on 17 June 2007 who died after suffocating in a police van while he was constrained.&lt;ref name="ceasefiremagazine.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ali Meziane |url=https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/stolen-lives-generation-rises-french-police-violence/ |title=Stolen Lives: A new generation rises up against French police violence |publisher=Ceasefire Magazine |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation of Lamine's death is ongoing, and grey areas around police accountability have come to light, including questions over how his body was covered in bruises and whether or not carotid restraint was used against him. Carotid restraint is a form of restriction, which compresses one or both carotid arteries, and is used by police enforcement to control dangerous individuals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ari Vidali |url=http://www.policemag.com/channel/patrol/articles/2014/01/reconsidering-carotid-control.aspx |title=Reconsidering Carotid Control - Article - POLICE Magazine |publisher=Policemag.com |date=2014-01-30 |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Court of Human Rights has condemned France in 1998 for their apparent use of carotid constriction.&lt;ref name="ceasefiremagazine.co.uk" /&gt; This same method of restraint was seen to be used against Hakim Sjimi who died of positional asphyxia as a result of overwhelming pressure being placed on his chest and neck by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riviera-press.fr/insider/node/24360 |title=Suspended sentences for Grasse police &amp;#124; Riviera Insider |publisher=Riviera-press.fr |date=2012-01-20 |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, recent protests over disputed labor laws have brought to light the extreme nature of police brutality in France, as many videos have surfaced in the media depicting police using disproportionate force on protesters. French officials have forced these aggressive videos to be destroyed, as they demonstrated the unnecessary forced nature of individuals in Frances police department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/europe/2016/05/29/labor-law-protests-shadowed-by-police-brutality-in-france-before-euro-2016 |title=Labor law protests shadowed by police brutality in France before Euro 2016 |publisher=Daily Sabah |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, as a result of the increased number of cases of police brutality in French communities, a group has formed called the Collective of Stolen Lives who represent families of those who have been affected by police brutality. This group strongly demand the government to act against police brutality and to reduce racism present across the police force in France.&lt;ref name="ceasefiremagazine.co.uk" /&gt;

=== Finland ===
Historically, anti-communist police brutality was commonplace during the 1920s and 1930s – in the wake of the [[Finnish Civil War]]. Some local sections of the secret police ([[Etsivä Keskuspoliisi]]) routinely beat up arrested communists.

As of 2006, there were 7700 police officers in Finland.&lt;ref name="uta.fi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tampub.uta.fi/handle/10024/93527|title=Poliisien tekemät rikokset – normien valvojat normien rikkojina|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That police force was shown to be more law-abiding than firemen.&lt;ref name="uta.fi" /&gt; However, it was revealed there are a few dozen cases each year in which police officers are convicted of crimes committed while on duty, 5 to 10 percent of the hundreds of such crimes prosecuted annually – the number of such crimes being shown to increase yearly.&lt;ref name="uta.fi" /&gt; Police officers are most often suspected of traffic related crimes (endangering road safety, vehicular collisions etc.) which constitute approximately 50% of all cases. These types of cases were also the most likely to be dismissed before proceeding to the prosecutor for consideration.&lt;ref name="uta.fi" /&gt; Second most numerous category is the use of force, approximately 20%, which proceed to the prosecutor without a fail apart from few off-duty petty assaults. In Finland, a petty assault could mean a slap on the cheek.&lt;ref name="uta.fi" /&gt;

In 2006, a 51-year-old police constable attracted a 16-year-old girl to his house by showing her his badge, where he got her drunk and raped her twice.

=== Germany ===
Whilst Germany may be sensitive towards its history in implementing policing practices, this hasn't appeared to stop international bodies from identifying a clear pattern of police ill-treatment to foreigners and members of ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur23/001/2004/en/ |title=Document &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=2004-01-14 |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year, around 2,000 complaints of police brutality are reported, with the figure most likely being a less than accurate representation given that not every incident is reported.&lt;ref name="dw.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/preventing-police-brutality-in-germany/a-16641839 |title=Preventing police brutality in Germany &amp;#124; Germany &amp;#124; DW.COM &amp;#124; 03.03.2013 |publisher=DW.COM |date=2017-01-24 |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As high profile cases like the Cologne New Year's Eve incident become more prevalent, racist and xenophobic attitudes have been reflected in instances of police brutality.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-01-08/german-police-are-too-soft-really |title=German Police Are Too Soft, Really - Bloomberg View |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst this incident occurred in 2014, high profile cases of police brutality have been reported to occur as far back as the 1990s.

History of Police Brutality:

'''28 May 1999''': Sudanese national Aamir Ageeb died of asphyxia during his forced deportation from Frankfurt. Prior to departure, Ageeb was forcibly restrained by tape and rope. During take-off, police officers allegedly forced his head and upper body between his knees.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
 
'''8 December 2000''': Josef Hoss was accused by his neighbour (a serving police officer) of harbouring firearms, which resulted in him being ambushed near his home, beaten and handcuffed. He woke up in the police station with a cloth bag over his head and had sustained multiple injuries that would prevent him from working and being able to financially support his family. No firearms were found upon investigation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;

'''May 2002''': Prior to his death, Stephen Neisius has spent 13 days in hospital on life support, after being repeatedly kicked and hit by a group of police officers as he lay handcuffed on the floor of a police station in the city. Although the Cologne District Court convicted all six police officers of bodily harm resulting in death, none of the accused served prison sentences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

'''2012''': After a fight with her boyfriend got out of hand, Teresa Z. called the police but was quickly arrested. Whilst in detention, she was punched by police officer Frank W. and left with a broken nose and eye socket. Frank W. spent ten months in jail and was forced to pay a fine of 3,000 euros.&lt;ref name="dw.com"/&gt;

As law enforcement is vested solely with the states of Germany, each state's police force (or 'Land' police) follows a different system of law. Accordingly, there is an absence of a federal comprehensive register, compiling and publishing regular, uniform and comprehensive figures on complaints about police ill-treatment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Even though Germany is bound to obligate its many international treaties and conventions, Amnesty International (2002) highlights the authorities failure to protect a range of human rights as guaranteed by international human rights law and standards.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Despite this objective lack of accountability for policing practice, levels of trust in police remain amongst the highest in the EU, only behind Scandinavian countries and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cepol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/03-confidence-police.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This allows Germany to maintain one of the lowest levels of public order and safety spending in the EU, at 1.5 percent of gross domestic profit, as compared to the EU average of 1.8 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Government_expenditure_on_public_order_and_safety |title=Government expenditure on public order and safety - Statistics Explained |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Germany has a police force of only 300 officers per 100,000 of its population. These numbers are only less in Scandinavian countries and the UK,&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Police_officers,_average_per_year,_2007–09_and_2010–12_(per_100_000_inhabitants)_YB14.png#file&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting that despite these instances of police brutality, Germany is attempting to build the impression of having a more laissez-faire approach to policing. Additionally, German police officers rarely use their guns, as there have only been 8 fatalities in the past two years and only 109 deaths by service weapons since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/why-german-police-officers-rarely-reach-for-their-guns/a-17884779 |title=Why German police officers rarely reach for their guns &amp;#124; Germany &amp;#124; DW.COM &amp;#124; 27.08.2014 |publisher=DW.COM |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greece ===
The Greek Police, known officially as the Hellenic Police, assumed their current structure in 1984. This structure was the result of the merging of the Gendarmerie (Chorofylaki) and the Urban Police Forces (Astynomia Poleon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/Member-countries/Europe/Greece|title=Greece / Europe / Member countries / Internet / Home - INTERPOL|website=www.interpol.int|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composed of central and regional departments, the Hellenic Police have a relatively long history of police brutality. One of the first documented dates back to 1976, within which 16-year-old activist Sideris Isidoropoulos was killed by police while he put up campaign posters on a public building. Only a few years later and 1980 saw the death of 20-year-old protester Stamatina Kanelopoulou at the hands of the Greek police. Kanelopoulou was beaten to death by members of the police force during a demonstration to commemorate the 1973 uprising against the military junta. It is still common for protesters to commemorate the 1973 uprising, and protests are still rife with police brutality around the time of this event today, over three decades after Kanelopoulou's death.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/fragkiska-megaloudi/growing-police-brutality-in-greece_b_2636529.html|title=Growing Police Brutality in Greece: The Hidden Face of the Crisis|website=The Huffington Post|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Increase====

The level and severity of police brutality in Greece over the last few years has been quite alarming and surprising. Due to recent financial crisis many austerity measures have been put in place, meaning that many individuals and families are struggling to survive. Greek citizens have opposed these austerity measures from the beginning, showing their disapproval with strikes and demonstrations. In response, police brutality has increased significantly, with consistent reports on the use of tear gas, severe injuries inflicted by police force, and unjustified detention of protesters.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"/&gt;

In 2013 Greek police allegedly tortured four young men believed to be suspected of bank-robbery following their arrest. It was alleged that the men were hooked and severely beaten in detention. The media published photos of the men, all with severe bruising, yet in the police released digitally manipulated photos of the four to make it appear that they lacked any injuries. The Greek minister of citizen protection - Nikos Dendias - protected the police, claiming that the police needed to use photoshop to ensure the suspects were recognisable.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"/&gt; In October 2012 15 anti-fascists protesters were arrested in Athens when they clashed with supporters of the fascist party 'Golden Dawn.' Victims claimed they were tortured during detention at the Attica General Police Directorate, stating that police officers slapped them, spat on them, burnt their arms with cigarette lighters and kept them awake with torches and lasers. Again, Nikos Dendias responded by accusing the British newspaper that published the details of these crimes of lying. It was proven by forensic examination that the torture had in fact taken place. The two Greek journalists who commented on the Guardian report the next day were fired.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"/&gt;

====Recent instances====

Police brutality on Greece today predominantly manifests itself in the form of unjustified and extreme physical violence towards protesters and journalists. Amnesty International highlights that the continued targeting of journalists is very concerning as it infringes on the right to freedom of expression. According to a recent Amnesty International report there have been multiple instances in which police have used excessive brutal force, have misused less-lethal weapons against protesters, have attacked journalists, and have subjected bystanders to ill treatment, particularly over the course of the anniversary of the 1973 student uprising against the Military Junta, as mentioned previously, which took place on November 17, 2014.&lt;ref name="thetoc.gr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetoc.gr/eng/news/article/amnesty-international-condemns-greek-police-brutality|title=Amnesty International condemns Greek police brutality {{!}}thetoc.gr|date=2014-11-21|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations against police have emerged specifically in relation to their use of brutal force, completely unprovoked, towards journalists documenting the demonstration, and against many students who partook in a peaceful protest. Allegedly police sprayed protesters with chemical irritants from close range – in one instance a 17-year-old girl with asthma had been treated in hospital after this attack and when she informed police of her condition they merely laughed.&lt;ref name="thetoc.gr"/&gt;

Video footage confirms that just days prior, on November 13, 2014, riot police began to strike students who attempted to run away from the grounds of the Athens Polytechnic. Media reports suggest that around 40 protesters had to seek subsequent medical attention to injuries sustained from brutal police beatings.&lt;ref name="thetoc.gr"/&gt; Amnesty international also calls for action on prosecuting those who are behind these inhumane acts, stating that within the Greek police there is a culture of "abuse and impunity" which remains as authorities have taken very little action to address the crux of the problem.&lt;ref name="thetoc.gr"/&gt;

A German exchange student said he was beaten randomly by riot police in the Exarheia district, his only reason for being there that he had accompanied other students to eat. The student gives a horrifying description of the violence he endured, he cowered in a corner when he saw police because a few weeks before he had witnessed police beating a man they had arrested. He claims that upon spotting him, about six police officers started beating him with their batons, and when they left they were replaced by another group of police.&lt;ref name="thetoc.gr"/&gt; The student was unarmed and posed no threat but the police were ruthlessly brutal in their actions. It has been indicated that riot police left beaten and gravely individuals without any medical assistance. Amnesty International urges Greece to effectively and promptly investigate these crimes against civilians, which clearly violate human rights, and hold perpetrators accountable.&lt;ref name="thetoc.gr"/&gt;

====Examples====

May 2011, student Yannis Kafkas, suffered an almost fatal head injury after a police officer hit him with a fire extinguisher the riot police carry around. Kafkas spent 20 days in intensive care.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"/&gt;

June 2011, Manolis Kipraios, journalist, was covering protests against austerity measures when a member of the riot police fired a stun grenade against him. He now suffers from permanent hearing loss.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"/&gt;

February 2012, photojournalist Marios Lolos had to have surgery following being beaten in the head by police at a protest. The day before this attack another journalist Rena Maniou was reportedly severely beaten by security forces. Dimitris Trimis, the head of The Greek Journalist Association (ESEA) broke his arm after he was violently pushed and kicked by police.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"/&gt;

There have been some instances where protesters have been used as human shields – a photo of a female protester in handcuffs ahead of policeman as people threw rocks at the police has gained considerable media attention.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"/&gt;

None of the above cases of police brutality resulted in any prosecution of police force members, this severe lack of accountability and punishment for this type of crime is a major issue for human rights activists currently. One case which sparked nationwide riots was that of 15-year-old Alexis Grigoropoulos, who was shot dead by a police officer in December 2008 during demonstrations in Athens. In this case,  unlike the majority of cases, the police officer responsible was convicted of murder.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"/&gt;

=== Hong Kong ===
During the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]], there had been numerous instances of police brutality. Seven police officers had been caught on video kicking and beating a prominent political activist who was already handcuffed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://time.com/3508857/ken-tsang-hong-kong-police-brutality-occupy-central/ | work=TIME | title=Claims of Police Brutality Threaten to Escalate the Hong Kong Protests?}}&lt;/ref&gt; There had also been more than hundreds of incidents of police beating passers-by with batons. Pictures on local TV and social media show demonstrators being dragged behind police lines, circled by police officers so that onlookers' views were blocked, and in some cases re-emerging with visible injuries. The officer involved, retired police officer Frankly Chu King-wai, was sentenced to three months in prison for causing serious body harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/hong-kong-heavy-handed-policing-will-only-inflame-protests-2014-11-28 | work=Amnesty International | title=Hong Kong: Heavy-handed policing will only inflame protests}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/03/27/former-police-inspector-charged-misconduct-occupy-protests/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hungary ===

In 2008 when Hungary signed the [[Schengen Agreement]], its two law enforcement bodies, the Police ([[Rendőrség]]) and the [[Border guard|Border Guards]] merged. Border Guards became police officers. The police force in Hungary consists of the National Bureau of Investigation and the Operational police, these bodies dealing with investigating severe crimes and dealing with riots, respectively. In addition to these, Terrorelhárítási Központ, a police force with jurisdiction in all of Hungary deals mainly with counter-terrorism. 44,923 employees make up the Rendőrség force in Hungary. Brutality and corruption exist within Rendőrség.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/55bf50df4.html |title=Hungary: Police corruption, including complaints mechanisms available to report instances of corruption; police effectiveness, including response to complaints submitted by Roma (2013-June 2015) |publisher=Refworld |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1998 Human Rights Watch World Report revealed that the Roma minority in Hungary were continually discriminated against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/worldreport99/europe/hungary.html |title=HRW World Report 1999: Hungary:Human Rights Developments |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discrimination was also evident in the police force, with reports of police mistreatment and brutality on the minority group.

The 2006 protests in Hungary demonstrate the brutal and disproportionate measures police may use, especially evident in these protests was police brutality on non-violent civilians. The protests were in response to Prime minister [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]]'s speech where he said that the Socialist Party lied their way into office. Furthermore, his speech revealed that in the four years he was in office, his party had not done anything of great importance.

Police threw gas grenades and used rubber bullets to shoot protesters. Picked and tackled by the police, protesters and non-violent civilians just passing by were injured by the police. Police broke the fingers of a handcuffed man, raided restaurants and bars to find radical demonstrators. Police brutality ranged from offensive language to physically attacking protesters. Reports show that brutality extended to bypassers, tourists, news reporters and paramedics.&lt;ref&gt;[[2006 protests in Hungary]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prevention====
Rather than acting reactively, Hungary should work to improve their police training programs and work to provide ongoing training and assessments to ensure that police officers in the Rendőrség, are competent and fair in their ethical judgements when it comes to proportionality of a crime or situation and the use of force. The requirements to become a police officer in Hungary are: high school education, pass matriculation exam, and two years of police academy.&lt;ref name="hungarianspectrum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hungarianspectrum.org/2009/03/01/the-hungarian-police-force/ |title=The Hungarian police force – Hungarian Spectrum |publisher=Hungarianspectrum.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other countries around the world, the two-year program is shorter than Denmark (3-year program), and longer than Australia (33-week program) and the United States (18 weeks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policecareer.vic.gov.au/police/about-the-role/becoming-a-police-officer |title=About the Role &amp;#124; Police Members &amp;#124; Victoria Police |publisher=Policecareer.vic.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discoverpolicing.org/what_does_take/?fa=training_academy_life |title=Police recruit training and academy summary |publisher=Discover Policing |date=2008-03-18 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current two-year program is quite lengthy, however time isn't the issue.  Most of what the Hungarian police academy teaches is academic theory; there is not much on practice.&lt;ref name="hungarianspectrum.org"/&gt; If practical work was given more attention in the Hungarian police academy, it is likely that the number of police brutality incidents will decrease.

===India===
{{see also|List of cases of police brutality in India}}
On January 23, 2017, [[2017 pro-jallikattu protests|a pro-jallikattu silent protest]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] turned violent. The [[National Human Rights Commission]] took note of reports that police used violent methods, including beatings and the damaging of private property, without prior warnings, to disperse of the protesters in [[Chennai]]. There were widespread social media reports of police setting vehicles on fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/police-excesses-on-jallikattu-supporters-in-chennai-nhrc-issues-notice-to-tamil-nadu-govt/articleshow/56761447.cms? |title=Police excesses on jallikattu supporters in Chennai: NHRC issues notice to Tamil Nadu govt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/jallikattu-nhrc-notice-to-tamil-nadu-government-police-for-excesses/|title=Jallikattu: NHRC notice to Tamil Nadu government, police for &amp;#8216;excesses&amp;#8217}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/tamil-nadu-news/video-of-cop-setting-auto-on-fire-allegedly-in-chennai-goes-viral-1651853 |title=Jallikattu: Kamal Haasan, Others Tweet Video Of Cop Setting An Auto On Fire |publisher=Ndtv.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Lathi Charge" very well known in India which are an excessive use of force done by police during mass protests or riot are also considered as brutality done by law enforcement officials.

=== Indonesia ===
[[Islamic extremists]] in Indonesia have been targeted by police as terrorists in the country. Police may either capture or kill dissidents. Cases of police corruption with hidden bank accounts and retaliation against journalists who attempt to uncover these cases have occurred such as in June 2012, when Indonesian magazine ''Tempo'' had journalist activists beaten by police. Separately, on August 31, 2013 police officers in Central Sulawesi province fired into a crowd of people protesting the death of a local man in police custody. Five people were killed and 34 injured. History of violence goes back to the military-backed [[Suharto]] regime (1967–1998), from which Suharto seized power during an [[Indonesian killings of 1965–1966|anti-Communist purge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/17419881 | work=The Economist | title=Cop killers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal investigations into human rights violations by the police are rare, punishments light and Indonesia has no independent national body to deal effectively with public complaints. [[Amnesty International]] has called on Indonesia to review police tactics during arrests and public order policing, to ensure that they meet international standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/indonesia-must-end-impunity-police-violence-2012-04-25|title=Indonesia|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ireland ===
====Northern Ireland (UK)====

The legacy of police brutality has long plagued Northern Ireland, due to unsavoury police procedures used during [[the Troubles]] to obtain admissions of guilt. The Troubles in Northern Ireland lasted from 1968 until 1998, and was essentially was a civil war between those who wanted Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom (unionists/loyalists, who are mostly Protestants) and those who didn't (Irish nationalists/republicans, who are mostly Catholics). During this time as many as 50,000 people were physically maimed or injured, a portion of which was done by the Northern Ireland Police (Royal Ulster Constabulary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/troubles |title=History - The Troubles |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instances of Northern Irish Police brutality were confirmed by the decision in 1978 of the [[European Court of Human Rights]], which concluded that five interrogation techniques used by the Police which included wall standing, deprivation of food, drink or sleep, subjection to noise and forcing detainees to remain in the same position for hours were instances of [[Cruel and unusual punishment|cruel and degrading treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/EUR45/004/2013/en/ |title=Document &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty International |date=2013-09-12 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 2010 however that such brutality was recognized by domestic courts, where 113 people came forward to have their application heard, some of whom were minors.

At present Northern Ireland still faces policing issues, though not to the extent of the Troubles. There are concerns about harassment by police of children aged 14–18 in low socio-economic areas of Northern Ireland which has led to a deep level of mistrust between the youth and the police.&lt;ref&gt;http://conflictresearch.org.uk/reports/policing/NIPB-PONI-Young-People-April-2003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Catholics in Northern Ireland find that they are treated differently by police due to the police force being largely Protestant. 48% of Catholics that were surveyed in Northern Ireland reported harassment by the police. Instances of harassment include police officials spitting on individuals or enforcing laws in a discriminatory fashion, for example only to those who are Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;McVeigh, Robbie

====Republic of Ireland====
The Republic of Ireland's police force is called the [[Garda Síochána]] (Garda) and employs around 14,500 staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=5416 |title=About Us - An Garda Síochána - Ireland's National Police Service |publisher=An Garda Síochána |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland's criminal laws allow 'reasonable force' to be used by the police with regard to all the circumstances, which eludes to officers actions being proportionate in the circumstances.  Excessive use of force is unlawful however s76(7) of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 allows the following considerations when deciding on what force is reasonable.
A person acting for a legitimate purpose may not be able to weigh up the exact necessary action at the time or may act instinctively but honestly – in these instances the use of force may be considered reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.app.college.police.uk/app-content/public-order/core-principles-and-legislation/police-use-of-force/#the-criminal-law-act-1967-the-police-and-criminal-evidence-act-1984-common-law-and-the-criminal-justice-and-immigration-act-2008 |title=Police use of force |publisher=College of Policing |date=2013-10-23 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is acknowledged by the Garda, who state; 'Unfortunately, even in the most civilised democratic jurisdictions, tragedies resulting from police use of force will continue to devastate families and communities.'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/GInspBarricadeIncidents.pdf/Files/GInspBarricadeIncidents.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of force by Irish Police officers has been of international concern, where the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture reported on this issue in the Republic three times in the space of a decade. Incidents that prompted this concern centred around the death of John Carty, a man suffering from mental illness who was shot by police, the prosecution of seven Garda police members due to assaults on protesters in 2002 and in 2005, a fifteen year old boy died after spending time in Garda custody. Given this state of events the Garda engaged independent Human Rights experts to conduct a review of the force, who found numerous deficiencies. The government responded by implementing new procedures based on this report. These include a new complaints procedure available against the Garda (Ombudsman Commission), disciplinary procedures and whistle-blowing protections.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, V &amp; Walshe, D  'Current Developments in Police Governance and Accountability in Ireland ''[[Crime, Law and Social Change]], Published online, 9 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latvia===

When addressing police brutality in [[Latvia]], it is important to look at the history of the country and how this affects its police and brutality towards the population. Latvia became an independent Republic in 1918 and attempted to develop an effective and accepted police force, moving away from the untrusted Russian Tsarist Administration. Despite positive post-independence aims to reform the police system and to maintain public order and security, the Latvian police were underfunded and under-resourced. The National Militia was created in response, being a voluntary force for the protection of public order.&lt;ref&gt;Melnis, E, Garonskis, A &amp; Matvejevs, A 2006, 'Development of the Policing in Latvia', ''Jurisprudencija''&lt;/ref&gt; Policing during this period was quite successful, being assimilated to what is today referred to as community policing.

From 1940 to 1991, Latvia was occupied by Soviet Union, and all previous regulations and practices were over-ruled by the Communist Regime.&lt;ref&gt;Melnis, E, Garonskis, A &amp; Matvejevs, A 2006, 'Development of the Policing in Latvia', ''Jurisprudencija'', Vol. 1, No. 79, pp. 72-84&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Soviet ideals on policing whereby criminals were the enemy, a high level of institutional secrecy existed and meant that there was no independent review of policing. More significantly, the approach of community policing was replaced with a militarised authority based on Marxist power ideologies. During this time, a clear imbalance existed between police actions and the rights of citizens. Despite lack of statistics, it is clear that police brutality was a major issue. This is illustrated by the case where former head of police Alfons Noviks was sentenced to life imprisonment for genocide against the Latvian people during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, I 2004, ''The countries of the former Soviet Union at the turn of the twenty-first century the Baltic and European states in transition'', Routledge, London, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, independence of the state of Latvia was again restored, which saw another change in the police system with the implementation of the Law on Police on June 5. This saw the restructuring of police forces into separate State, Security and Local Government levels. The Law on Police 1991 reiterated ethical requirements, whereby police officers were prohibited from performing or supporting acts relating to "torture or other cruel, inhuman or demeaning treatment or punishment". However, despite these reforms, issues regarding police brutality arose in light of the Russian population remaining in Latvia.  In 1998, police forces were accused of dispersing a rally of predominately Russian pensioners through the use of excessive force and brutality.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffries, I 2004, ''The countries of the former Soviet Union at the turn of the twenty-first century the Baltic and European states in transition'', Routledge, London, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; This hostility towards Russians remained in the proceeding years, and despite lack of official statistics, police brutality continued to be an issue after the independence of Latvia.

In 2005, the Latvian Center for Human Rights and Ethnic Studies (LCHRES) found a number of instances of brutality and "severe abuse" within police authorities, especially of persons in custody.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;U.S Department of State: Diplomacy in Action, 2006, Latvia, accessed 19 July 2016 &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61658.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Reports have shown high levels of corruption within Latvian law enforcement authorities, with 42 members convicted of corruption offences between 2003 and 2004.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt; For the Latvian community, this means that should an incident of police brutality occur, they may not have an independent body to report to nor is it guaranteed to be handled impartially without corruption.

Latvian prisons illustrate cases where police batons were used to inflict serious harm to inmates, including causing broken ribs, which often were not medically assessed for up to two days. To address levels of police brutality, LCHRES conducted a study whereby it set up an anonymous hotline.&lt;ref&gt;Latvian Center for Human Rights and Ethnic Studies, Prevention of Torture, accessed 20 July 2016, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://cilvektiesibas.org.lv/en/projects/prevention-of-torture/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; During this four-day study, LCHRES received almost 300 calls and written complaints regarding police brutality and misconduct. This identifies fundamental flaws in the Latvian police authorities.

Since joining the European Union in 2004, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) has assessed the Latvian criminal justice system a number of times.  Whilst the CPT gives appropriate authorities recommendations for improvements such as a review board for ill-treatment, they found that in 2011, Latvian authorities had not enacted any of their 2007 recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, 2013, ''Report to the Latvian Government on the visit to Latvia carried out by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) from 5 to 15 September'', 2011, accessed 19 July 2016, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/news-2013/-/asset_publisher/TEHtOeUO1Ozc/content/latvia-should-address-ill-treatment-by-police-and-improve-detention-conditions&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, their 2011 report outlined a number of cases of police brutality within the prison system, with ill-treatment allegations such as punching, kicking and a few cases of misuse of police batons and excessively tight handcuffing. This was alleged to occur mostly at the time of apprehension or during their time at the police station (including during questioning).

Despite the flaws within the Latvian Police system, CPT has found that the number of allegations for ill-treatment are decreasing over the years. The Latvian Police force operates under the Professional Ethics and Conduct Code of the State Police Personnel, which states "A Police officer shall use force, special facilities or weapon only in the cases stipulated by due course of law and to attain a legal aim.&lt;ref&gt;Latvian State Police, ''Professional Ethics and Conduct Code of the State Police Personnel'', accessed 20 July 2016, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.vp.gov.lv/?id=205&amp;said=205&amp;r=1&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of spontaneous or ill-intentioned force, special facilities or weapon shall not be justified." This identifies that the authorities are conscious of police brutality, and given more time, it is likely that the figures will continue to decrease.

=== Luxembourg ===
The Luxembourg Police force has 1,603 officers and is known as the 'Grand Ducal Police'. The Grand Ducal Police is the primary law enforcement agency in Luxembourg and has been operating since January 1, 2000, when the Grand Ducal Gendarmerie (previous Luxembourg military) merged with the police force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/memberpage/luxembourg-779 |title=Luxembourg &amp;#124; Partners &amp; Agreements &amp;#124; Member States &amp;#124; Europol |publisher=Europol |date=1958-01-01 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Luxembourg's relatively small population of approximately 500, 000 people the Grand Ducal Police are in charge of several duties that are often separated jurisdictions such as; Border Control and Internal Military operations.&lt;ref name="police.public.lu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.police.public.lu/fr/police-se-presente/1000-metiers/inspecteur/index.html |title=L’inspecteur de police - Portail de la Police Grand-Ducale - 1000 métiers en 1 |publisher=Luxembourg police |date=2016-04-22 |accessdate=2017-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110204044/http://www.police.public.lu/fr/police-se-presente/1000-metiers/inspecteur/index.html |archivedate=2017-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police brutality is not perceived to be a serious threat to society in Luxembourg. The European Union's 2014 Anti-Corruption report placed Luxembourg, along with Denmark and Finland, as having the lowest experiences of Police brutality within the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-86_en.htm |title=Commission unveils first EU Anti-Corruption Report |publisher=European Commission |date=2014-02-03 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to many positive characteristics of their society, such as freedom of media, the encouragement of public participation in the legal system and transparency mechanisms, the public also have great trust in the Grand Ducal police force.

Laws in Luxembourg specifically distinguish between coercion and force in the 1973 Act on Regulating the Use of Force.&lt;ref name="books.google.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Schengen_Investigated.html?id=YGbNgL-m20AC&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Schengen Investigated: A Comparative Interpretation of the Schengen ... - Chantal Joubert, Hans Bevers |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |date=1996-06-03 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Act regulates the use of police weapons and specific technical means of physical force used by police. However, this act does not cover other forms of physical coercion by police officers such as the use of handcuffs as these are seen as basic police measures that do not require specific legislation. The officer must be legitimately executing his duty and his actions and must be compatible under the principles of proportionality, subsidiarity, reasonability and measure in order to use force.&lt;ref name="books.google.it" /&gt; To ensure the Grand Ducal Police do not engage in police brutality numerous safeguards and prevention methods are implemented. The police inspector (which is the term for an everyday officer) must undergo legal and tactical training lasting an intensive 26 months followed by further training at an allocated police station.&lt;ref name="police.public.lu" /&gt; By way of comparison, the Victoria Police Academy only provides 33 weeks of tactical and legal training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.police.vic.gov.au/content.asp?Document_ID=2 |title=Victoria Police - Delivering a Safer Victoria |publisher=Victoria Police (Australia) |date=2005-05-25 |accessdate=2017-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409041623/http://www.police.vic.gov.au/content.asp?Document_ID=2 |archivedate=2013-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 Human Right Report on Government practices by the United States indicated no cases of police brutality in Luxembourg. This report suggests the Grand Ducal Police have effective mechanisms in place to investigate and punish potential abuse and corruption.

Although police brutality is almost nonexistent in Luxembourg, there are effective procedures in place for the investigation and punishment of any potential misconduct by the Grand Ducal Police.

=== Malta ===
Malta's Police Force (MPF) is one of the oldest in Europe, with the Maltese government taking over the force in 1921, following the grant of self-governance. Currently, there are approximately 1,900 members in the Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.mt/en/Services-And-Information/Business-Areas/Law%20Enforcement/Pages/Malta-Police-Force.aspx|title=Malta police force|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Police Act of 1961, Part V deals with the use of force, whereby "police officers may use such moderate and proportionate force as may be necessary…" (Article 96.),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lom&amp;itemid=8686|title=Chapter 164|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, according to Article 100., "It shall be considered as an offence against discipline if a police officer uses force for considerations extraneous to those permitted by law and the circumstances of the case".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As such, Malta does recognize the illegality of police brutality and can prosecute offending officials on these grounds.

Malta is expected to abide by the 2001 European Code of Ethics being a member of the [[European Union]], whereby "The police may use force only when strictly necessary and only to the extent required to obtain a legitimate objective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016805e297e|title=Council of Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the Council of Europe (of which Malta is a member) follows the five principles developed by the [[European Court of Human Rights]], whereby definition 16 states that police officers "may use reasonable force when lawfully exercising powers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?p=&amp;id=1417857&amp;Site=COE&amp;BackColorInternet=DBDCF2&amp;BackColorIntranet=FDC864&amp;BackColorLogged=FDC864&amp;direct=true|title=Commissioner for Human Rights – Opinion of the Commissioner for Human Rights, Thomas Hammarberg, concerning independent and effective determination of complaints against the police|last=Hammarberg|first=Council of Europe, Commissioner for Human Rights, Mandate 2006–2012, Thomas|website=wcd.coe.int|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Lawrence Gonzi (The Minister for Justice and Home Affairs) called upon Mr Martin Scicluna, a former civil servant and currently expert on security issues at the Prime Minister's Office, to conduct an independent inquiry into the 24 March 2008 police brutality incident. the inquiry required the investigation of "allegations of beatings carried out on detainees at Safi Detention Centre by members of the Detention Service on 24 March 2008 and to make any recommendations necessary in the light of [his] findings".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Following the results of the inquiry of Mr. Scicluna, made public by the [[Government of Malta|Maltese Government]], it was concluded that "excessive force was used by Detention Service Personnel".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Mr Scicluna made recommendations that "appropriate [action] should be taken to reprimand the Detention Service officers involved in this operation and the relevant Senior NCOs for the acts of 25 excessive force used by some personnel in their charge".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/documents/mlt/2011-05-inf-eng.pdf|title=Report to the Maltese Government on the visit to Malta carried out by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, Home Affairs Minister Carm Mifsud Bonnici has said "95 percent of the members of the police force were doing their duties, but the remainder needed to be addressed",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20080706/local/cmb.215356|title=Police violence will not be tolerated – minister|last=Ltd|first=Allied Newspapers|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the establishment of the Internal Affairs Unit (IAU) to "maintain and safeguard the integrity of the Malta Police Force through an internal system of investigation that is objective, fair, equitable, impartial and just",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulizija.gov.mt/en-us/internalaffairs.aspx|title=Malta Police Force Portal|website=www.pulizija.gov.mt|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; where complaints or allegations on the use of force can be monitored and responded to.

Although Malta has attempted to tackle the police brutality through the implementation of independent systems such as the IAU, the [[United States Department of State|US Department of State]] 2010 report on Malta's human rights found that "authorities detained irregular immigrants under harsh conditions for up to 18 months during the review of their protected status."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.state.gov/md154438.htm|title=Malta|website=m.state.gov|access-date=2016-07-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160719085153/http://m.state.gov/md154438.htm|archivedate=2016-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the 2013 [[United States Department of State|US Department of State]] report found that although there were no government reports of the use of brutality in detention centers, on December 2, 2013, media reported the sentencing of two former prison guards to five years prison and another two guards to three months prison after finding them guilty of beating an escaped prisoner in 2008, illustrating the gradual development of the IAU in limiting the use of police brutality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/220518.pdf|title=MALTA 2013 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the implementation of the IAU, The [[United Nations Human Rights Committee|Human Rights Committee]] has raised questions on the use of force by state officials with respect to the countering of detention center riots, where police have been accused of punching and striking detainees. An enquiry was consequently conducted in 2011 and 2012 following riots, resulting in criminal action against the law enforcement officials responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15167&amp;LangID=E|title=Human Rights Committee considers report of Malta|website=www.ohchr.org|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Giacomo Santini and Tina Acketoft (The Chairs of the Migration and Equality Committees of the Parliamentary Assembly of the [[Council of Europe]]) expressed "grave concern at an increasing number of incidents of state violence against migrants and refugees". They have called upon Maltese authorities to conduct a rapid investigation emphasising the need to stamp out violence against migrants and refugees, whether by state actors or by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/News-View-EN.asp?newsid=4044&amp;lang=2|title=PACE: News|website=assembly.coe.int|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination|The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] in relation to the conditions of migrants in detention, recommended that the "State party take appropriate measures to improve detention conditions and refrain from resorting to excessive use of force to counter riots by immigrants in detention centers, and also to avoid such riot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/A.66.18.pdf|title=The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|David Calleja&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;
|"Ta' Xbiex resident David Calleja, a financial advisor, had been driving in the Sliema Strand when he was stopped by police, who deemed him to be driving recklessly.
The Malta Police Force issued a statement detailing what had happened, in which it claimed that Mr Calleja acted aggressively, refused to take a breathalyser test, ignored police orders and used foul language.

He was subsequently arrested and taken to a police squad car, but according to the police statement, he kicked the driver, tried to escape and banged his head repeatedly against the car window. The police added that he even spit blood at police officers and bit a constable's arm, tearing off part of his skin.

When asked to state his client's plea, Dr Abela declared "absolutely not guilty," before accusing the police of grossly distorting the truth.

Mr Calleja's nose was bandaged, and Dr Abela presented a medical certificate showing that it had been broken as evidence. The lawyer also presented his client's blood-stained clothes – prosecuting inspector Jason Sultana originally objected, but relented after Dr Abela said that this objection was due to the fact that the clothes helped confirm the injuries Mr Calleja sustained."&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2014-10-27/local-news/Lawyer-of-man-accused-of-biting-constable-claims-his-client-was-victim-of-police-brutality-6736124499|title=Lawyer of man accused of biting constable claims his client was victim of police brutality – The Malta Independent|website=www.independent.com.mt|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle East ===
Police brutality was a major drive behind [[2011 Egyptian revolution]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21574017-police-are-rotten-ever-what-happened-reform | work=The Economist | title=What happened to reform?}}&lt;/ref&gt; the incident of [[Khaled Said]]'s death and other stories, yet very little has changed since. One of the "demands" around which people decided to take it to the streets in Egypt is "purging the Ministry of Interior" for its brutality and torture practices.

[[File:Wattsriots-policearrest-loc.jpg|thumb|upright|Police arrest a man during the [[Watts Riots]], August 1965]]

The [[Gulf Cooperation Council|GCC]] states have seen many cases of brutality, some even involving senior figures. For example, [[Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan]] a UAE sheikh, was involved in the torture of many business associates and he often recorded some of the abuse. Sheikh Issa was eventually arrested but a court found him not guilty and released him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=7402099|title=ABC News|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International has also reported that a UAE worker was subjected to a wide array of torture methods during his time in jail, including beatings and sleep deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/08/uae-foreign-national-tortured-in-custody-and-detained-without-charge-for-a-year/|title=Error|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities in Saudi Arabia have also been filmed lashing civilians for different reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/saudi-religious-police-dont-like-artists-who-harass-the-godly-self-and-have-long-hair|title=Saudi Religious Police Don't Like Being Filmed Beating People Up|work=VICE|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Netherlands ===
{{Unbalanced|date=March 2017}} 
The Netherlands is signatory to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;The European Convention on Human Rights, viewed online July 19, 2016

&lt;nowiki&gt;http://rightsinfo.org/the-rights-in-the-european-convention/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; detailing the limits and responsibilities of police powers, and as such demonstrates a public commitment to the restricted legal use of police powers. These powers include the use of reasonable force to enable the effective discharge of duties, with the stipulation force be used proportionately and only as a last resort&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The police force of the Netherlands is divided into 25 regional forces and one central force. A Regional Police Board, made up of local mayors and the chief public prosecutor, heads each regional force, with a chief officer placed in charge of police operations. Police accountability procedures include the mandatory reporting of any incident during the discharge of duty that requires the use of force. The Rijksrecherche is the national agency responsible for the investigation of serious breaches of police conduct resulting in death or injury. In 2007 the Rijksrecherche conducted 67 inquiries related to police officers, 21 of which were for shooting incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Lamboo, T 2010, "Police Misconduct: accountability of internal investigations' ''International Journal of Public Sector management,'' vol. 23, iss. 7, pp. 613-631.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Dutch society has a history of support for liberal values, it has not been immune to what can be regarded as a broader international trend toward the practice of racial profiling and increased levels of police violence towards racial minorities. Suspicion and mistrust of some racial groups is evident, and is perpetuated by police attitudes at all levels of command.&lt;ref name="Leun, J. P 2011"&gt;van der Leun, J. P &amp; van der Woude, M.

Instances highlighting the convergence of racial profiling and the use of police force came to the forefront of public attention in the Netherlands in June 2015 with the death of Aruban man Mitch Henriquez. Henriquez died of asphyxiation while in police custody after claiming to have a firearm and being arrested at a music festival in [[The Hague]]. The first anniversary of his death in June this year provided a catalyst for protest against police brutality in The Hague, an area with a significant proportion of residents of non-European back-ground. Eleven protesters were arrested for failing to comply with instructions from the Mayor to limit protest to certain areas of the city, leading to some protesters to claim authorities were attempting to criminalize the right to peaceful protest. The five officers alleged to be involved in Mitch Hendriquezs' death have been suspended but are yet to be charged.&lt;ref&gt;Peiters, J 2016 'Police Chokehold Death Protested Blocked From Hague Neighborhood' Netherland Times, June 27, 2016, Retrieved July 18, 2016

=== Pakistan ===
{{see also|List of cases of police brutality in Pakistan}}
 Pakistan's law enforcement is divided into multiple tiers including forces under provincial and federal government control. The law strictly prohibits any physical abuse of suspected or convicted criminals, however, due to certain training lacks, there have been reported instances of suspected police brutality. Reported cases are often investigated by police authorities as well as civil courts leading to mixed outcomes. 
'''RECENT CASES'''
    A recent case includes the purported extra judicial killing of a man named Naqeebullah by an ex-officer named "Rao Anwar". Taking notice of the matter, the Supreme Court issued arrest and detention warrants in the case to arrest the accused.

Politically motivated riots and protests have occurred historically in China, notably with the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. Within the past decade, groups such as [[Falun Gong]] have protested party measures and been broken up by riot police. Chinese dissidents have been able to arrange effective mobilization through use of social media and informal communication like [[Twitter]] and its Chinese counterparts [[Microblogging in China|Weibo]] or microblogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-04-30/asia/world_asia_china-chen-internet_1_sina-weibo-chinese-censors-chen-guangcheng?_s=PM:ASIA | work=CNN | title=Chinese censors block news on blind activist's escape – CNN.com | date=May 9, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614224358/http://articles.cnn.com/2012-04-30/asia/world_asia_china-chen-internet_1_sina-weibo-chinese-censors-chen-guangcheng?_s=PM:ASIA | archivedate=June 14, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign journalists from Switzerland have reported cases of [[police harassment]]. Media suppression has increased in the wake of the [[Tunisian revolution|Jasmine Revolution]] in Tunisia. Plainclothes policemen are often deployed during demonstrations to suppress violence. Censorship is often maintained as a measure to maintain political stability in China. Web activists can be charged by the police for using false identities to surf the Internet. After arrests, homes of the arrested individual are often searched for incriminating evidence such as computers, [[hard drives]], and [[flash drives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rsf.org/china-police-violence-against-28-02-2011,39643.html|title=Police violence against journalists, invitations to tea – Reporters Without Borders|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poland ===
The Polish police force aims to 'serve and protect the people, and to maintain public order and security'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policja.pl/pol/english-version/4889,Polish-National-Police.html|title=Polish National Police|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polish laws prohibit torture or degrading treatment and set out punishment for police officers including demotion and removal from the police force.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/220529.pdf|title=Poland 2013 Human Rights Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====

A key factor influencing the levels of police brutality in Poland has been the move from a communist state to a democracy. It is argued that Poland's transition has resulted in a more transparent system, decreasing levels of police brutality.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krasnokutski|first=Shannon|date=2001|title=Human Rights in Transition: The success and Failure of Polish and Russian Criminal Justice Reform|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1469&amp;context=jil|journal=Case Western Reserve Journal|volume=33|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although police brutality exists within Poland cases are much more likely to be handled by the criminal justice system with a greater chance for resolution through the courts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

This change can also been seen through the increased trust within the Polish police. While there are still instances of police brutality, trust in the police has steadily increased in Poland from 62% - 75% between 2002 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=Tabitha|date=2009|title=The Distrust Paradox: Trust and Distrust in the Polish Online Press, Cross National Data Reports and Public Opinion Surveys 2002–2008|url=https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/indexablecontent/uuid:10615342-c372-4fd1-ac0f-71850ef328c2|journal=Thesis – University of North Carolina|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statistic demonstrates the improvement in trust between the police and general public.

Although there is a more open police force within Poland, many organizations still hold issues with police brutality within Poland. The 2013 United States Department of State report on Poland raised several issues of police brutality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The report cited a case of police officers using violence to gain a confession for armed robbery in 2012.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, it also noted that these police officers were eventually indicted for police brutality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Issues with sports fans====
{{see also|2015 Knurów riots|1998 Słupsk street riots}}
In recent years one of the main sources of controversy amongst Polish police brutality has been in the use of rubber bullets to disperse crowd trouble at sporting events.

In 1998, [[1998 Słupsk street riots|major riots]] occurred when a young basketball fan was killed by the police. In 2004, a man was killed and a woman injured in a riot when Polish police accidentally shot live ammunition instead of rubber bullets into the crowd after an association football game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2007/100578.htm|title=Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Poland|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2015 Knurów riots|Another set of riots]] occurred in 2015 in response to a [[pitch invasion]] during a football match. Although rubber bullets were used, one man was hit on the neck and later died at the hospital.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A former Polish police officer justified this use of weapons as a means to combat [[football hooliganism]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newpolandexpress.pl/pdf_copies/newpolandexpress_305_2015-05-08.pdf|title=Football Fan Death Sparks Riots|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003180859/http://www.newpolandexpress.pl/pdf_copies/newpolandexpress_305_2015-05-08.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters have characterized the detainment of sports fans protesting against the government as unfair and undemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polskieradio.pl/43/265/Artykul/370212,Kibice-Jagiellonii-zatrzymani-za-protest |title=Kibice Jagiellonii zatrzymani za protest - Sport |publisher=Polskie Radio |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Issues with Roma====

The Polish police also have a history of police brutality within the [[Roma in Poland|Roma community]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.errc.org/article/osce-meeting-statement-on-roma-in-poland/285|title=OSCE Metting Statement on Roma in Poland|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=European Roma Rights Centre|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple cases of police beatings and other discriminatory acts against Roma from Polish police.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The European Roma Rights Centre also argues that police investigations into police brutality cases are very rare with systematic police brutality against the Roma minority.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

One particular case of police brutality against Roma occurred in 1998 when the police took four Roma men to a field and beat them.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.errc.org/article/police-beat-four-roma-near-ciechocinek-poland/1558|title=Police Beat four Roma near Ciechocinek, Poland|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=European Roma Rights Centre|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the men that were beaten were charged with vulgar words and behavior in public this police brutality resulted in broken bones and hospitalisation. This incident demonstrates the need for further procedures in order to stop police brutality against Roma and the continued need for police checks to stop police misconduct.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Portugal ===
[[Portugal]] is ranked the fourth most heavily policed country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy |first=Niall |url=https://www.statista.com/chart/2987/the-most-heavily-policed-countries-in-the-world/ |title=• Chart: The most heavily policed countries in the world |publisher=Statista |date=2014-11-24 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police force is divided into five main organisations, with the [[Polícia de Segurança Pública]] (PSP) having the most prominent urban presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safecommunitiesportugal.com/police-in-portugal/ |title=Police In Portugal |publisher=Safe Communities Portugal |date=1945-10-20 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PSP has a diverse range of duties and responsibilities, which include protecting the rights of citizens and ensuring democratic legality.

The use of weapons by Portuguese police is permitted only when:

{{Quote|text="…absolutely necessary and when less dangerous means have proved ineffective, and provided that their use is proportionate to the circumstances"|author=''Decreto-Lei No. 457/99 Art. 2(1)'' |source=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pgdlisboa.pt/leis/lei_mostra_articulado.php?nid=1558&amp;tabela=leis |title=::: DL n.º 457/99, de 05 de Novembro |publisher=Procuradoria-Geral Distrital de Lisboa |date= 1999-11-05|accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

This is severely restrictive. By way of example, police will not be permitted to use their firearms when an offender is running away.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jflmjournal.org/article/S1752-928X(15)00071-2/abstract?cc=y=&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal has recently been criticised for the excessive use of force by police. High profile incidents at football matches, as well as reports of racially motivated force used against minority communities, have highlighted the issue of police brutality in Portugal.

====Football hooliganism====

Portuguese police have adopted an aggressive position in combating football hooliganism. Despite appearing disproportionate, the police view the heavy-handed nature of their tactics as a necessary and successful approach towards community protection and maintaining social order.

In 2015, a viral video depicted a Benfica fan being heavily beaten in front of his two children outside a football stadium. The footage, filmed by a local television station, shows Jose Magalhaes leaving the football match early with his children and elderly father before being confronted by police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32793901 |title=Portugal police filmed hitting football fan in front of children|work=BBC News |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the family appeared calm, Magalhaes was tackled to the ground by police and repeatedly hit with a metal baton, whilst his father was punched in the face twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Associated Press in Matosinhos |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/20/outrage-in-portugal-over-police-beating-of-man-in-front-of-his-children |title=Outrage in Portugal over police beating of man in front of his children &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; More police rushed to the scene to shield the obviously distraught children, aged nine and thirteen.

A statement released by the PSP acknowledged the controversial incident and announced that an investigation was launched against the officer responsible for initiating the attack.&lt;ref name="safecommunitiesportugal.com"&gt;http://www.safecommunitiesportugal.com/public-statement-by-psp-police-concerning-football-violence-at-guimarães-and-lisbon/&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the officer was suspended for 90 days by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/officer-caught-beating-benfica-fan-suspended-for-90-days/35214 |title=Officer caught beating Benfica fan suspended for 90 days |publisher=The Portugal News |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statement also defended the policing of the large crowds in the aftermath of the football match. Riot police had clashed with supporters the following day in Lisbon as fans celebrated Benfica's title victory. The harsh approach was described as proportionate and necessary to prevent social disorder from escalating.&lt;ref name="safecommunitiesportugal.com" /&gt;

In a similar incident in 2016, another football club, Sporting Lisbon, complained about 'barbaric' police assaulting their fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com.au/sporting-cp/story/2876295/sporting-lisbon-complain-of-barbaric-assault-by-riot-police-on-fans |title=Sporting Lisbon complain of 'barbaric' assault by riot police on fans |work=[[ESPN FC]] |date=2016-05-19 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Racism====

There have also been suggestions of institutionalised racism within the Portuguese police force, with activists claiming that discrimination is the deep-rooted cause of police brutality in Portugal.&lt;ref name="bbc.comThey hate"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-32419952 |title='They hate black people'|work=BBC News |date=2015-04-23 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2015/2016 annual report on Portugal, Amnesty International condemned the excessive force used by police against migrant and minority communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/portugal/report-portugal/ |title=Portugal 2015/2016 &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty International |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a good record in migrant integration, historical parallels can be drawn with Portugal's colonial past and modern police racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=40394108|title=Portugal: A Determined Empire|first=Andrew|last=Marshall|date=29 May 1961|publisher=|journal=The World Today|volume=17|issue=3|pages=95–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to activists, police have killed 14 young black men since 2001, however, no police officer has been held responsible for the deaths.&lt;ref name="bbc.comThey hate" /&gt;

Racially influenced police actions are illustrated by the violence in Cova de Moura, a low socio-economic area housing a significant migrant population. Notably, during an incident in February 2015, a young man named Bruno was aggressively searched and physically abused.&lt;ref name="bbc.comThey hate" /&gt; When bystanders protested the excessive force, police responded by firing shotguns loaded with rubber bullets at the witnesses.&lt;ref name="bbc.comThey hate" /&gt;

On the same day, two human rights workers and five youth entered the [[Alfragide]] police station requesting information on Bruno's situation. Upon arrival, the group was allegedly attacked by police officers shouting racist slurs.&lt;ref name="bbc.comThey hate" /&gt; The policemen dragged and kept the young men in the police station, where they detained them for two days, mistreated and mocked them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Reis |first1=Marta |title=Esquadra de Alfragide.

Eventually 17 police officers from the Alfragide police station went to trial on a variety of charges, including physical aggression, torture, document forging and aggravated kidnapping. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Costa |first1=Cátia |title=Juíza leva a julgamento 17 dos 18 polícias acusados de agressões |url=https://www.sabado.pt/portugal/detalhe/juiza-leva-a-julgamento-17-dos-18-policias-acusados-de-agressoes?ref=DET_relacionadas_portugal |website=Sábado |accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2018, the trial was ongoing, with victims being heard in court. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Henriques |first1=Joana |title=“Os polícias davam socos, pontapés.

The [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] (ECRI) has expressed concerns about police mistreatment of minorities in Portugal in all of its reports on the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ECRI - Country monitoring in Portugal |url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/portugal |website=CoE |accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its fifth country report of 2018, ECRI mentions the Alfragide case in connection to the failure of IGAI ([[Inspeção-Geral da Admnisitração Interna|Inspeção-Geral da Administração Interna]]) or officers upper in the chain of command to stop the abuses. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ECRI REPORT ON PORTUGAL (fifth monitoring cycle) |date=2018-06-19 |publisher=Council of Europe |location=Strasbourg |page=26 |url=https://rm.coe.int/fifth-report-on-portugal/16808de7da |accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, IGAI is the body responsible for scrutinizing police activities in the country, but it is part of the Ministry of the Interior, the same way Police forces are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apresentação |url=https://www.igai.pt/quem-somos/apresentacao |website=IGAI |accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2018 report, ECRI recommends that such work be carried out by the country's [[Ombudsman]], an equality body, or by a new and (entirely) independent body that can be created for that purpose. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ECRI REPORT ON PORTUGAL (fifth monitoring cycle) |date=2018-06-19 |publisher=Council of Europe |location=Strasbourg |page=26 |url=https://rm.coe.int/fifth-report-on-portugal/16808de7da |accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portuguese people of [[Romani people|Roma]] ethnicity have also been victims of police harassment and brutality in the country. There are several examples that have been publicized by the media. One such case is from 2007 and involved a Roma man and his son. The two walked to the [[Nelas]] police station, in [[Porto]], to get some information, but the police allegedly ended up abusing them. Two officers were convicted in 2011 for physically assaulting the father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lusa |title=Dois agentes da PSP condenados por agressão a cigano |url=https://www.dn.pt/portugal/norte/interior/dois-agentes-da-psp-condenados-por-agressao-a-cigano-1876502.html |website=Diário de Notícias |accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An example of police brutality during raids of Roma camps or neighbourhoods, is the night raid of a Roma camp site by the GNR ([[Guarda Nacional Republicana]]), in [[Cabanelas]], [[Vila Verde]], in 2012. Some of the people living in the camp, including children and women, were reportedly attacked by GNR officers. The six Roma detained in the violent operation allege that they were later tortured and humiliated in the GNR station of [[Amares]]; the GNR denied the accusations, while [[SOS Racismo]] promised to file a complaint against this force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Silva |first1=Samuel |title=GNR acusada de "torturar" ciganos detidos numa rusga em Vila Verde |url=https://www.publico.pt/2012/09/27/local/noticia/gnr-acusada-de-torturar-ciganos-detidos-numa-rusga-em-vila-verde-1564830 |website=Público |accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A last remnant of overt institutional racism, in Portugal, is article 81 of GNR's regulation law, which provides for an increased policing of nomadic people - who, in general, are known to be mostly Roma; the regulation's constitutionality was unsuccessfully challenged in the 80's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mendes |first1=Maria |title=Identidades, Racismo e Discriminação: Ciganos da AML |date=2012 |publisher=Caleidoscópio |location=Lisbon |isbn=978-989-658-160-2 |page= |pages=83, 84 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia ===
Russian protests have gained media attention with the reelection of [[Vladimir Putin]] in 2012. Attention has been given to incidence of violence via posting videos online. President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] has initiated reforms of the police force, in an attempt to minimize the violence by firing the Moscow police chief and centralizing police powers. Police divisions in Russia are often based on loyalty systems that favor bureaucratic power among political elites. Phone tapping and business raids are common practice in the country, and often fail to give [[due process]] to citizens. Proper investigations of police officials still remains lacking by western standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/15731344 | work=The Economist | title=Cops for hire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Russia's top investigative agency investigated charges that four police officers had tortured detainees under custody. Human rights activists claim that Russian police use torture techniques to extract [[false confessions]] from detainees. Police regulations require quotas of officers for solved crimes, a practice that encourages false arrests to meet their numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/29/russia-police-torture_n_1387421.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Russian Police Charged With Torture In Deadly Rape, Death Of Detainee | date=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slovakia ===

Police brutality in Slovakia is systematic and widely documented, but is almost exclusively brought about against the Romani minority. The nation state itself has particularly racist attitudes toward the Romani minority, dating back prior to the split of Czechoslovakia. In fact, it is widely known that the government undertook, and still undertakes forced sterilisation of Romani women, and continues to segregate the Romani into walled-off settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.romea.cz/en/news/world/slovakia-internationally-criticized-for-forced-sterilization-police-impunity-for-brutality-against-roma-position-on-refugee|work=Romea|title=Slovakia Internationally Criticized For Forced Sterilisation, Police Impunity Against Roma|date=October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discrimination has undoubtedly filtered down to the police force. Excessive use of force against the Romani minority by police has been publicly criticised by the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/slovakia/report-slovakia/|work=Amnesty International|title=Slovakia 2015/2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police force has been repeatedly condemned by a number of organisations for lengthy pre-trial detention, and its treatment of suspects in custody.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, T (2013) 'Reflections on 1989 in Eastern Europe'  p 227, Routledge, {{ISBN|1-317-98039-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a 51-year-old Romani man died as a result of abuse in police custody at the hands of the Mayor of Magnezitovce and his police officer son. The victim, Mr Sendrei, was allegedly chained to a radiator and fatally beaten, after being forcefully removed from his home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Comparative Criminology|url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/rwinslow/europe/slovakia.html|work=San Diego State University|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415144947/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/rwinslow/europe/slovakia.html|archivedate=2016-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Whilst the mayor's son was immediately removed from the police force, and the mayor suspended from his position, he was reinstated just 4 months later. In response to this incident the minister for internal affairs attempted to establish new measures to prevent police brutality including mandatory psychological testing for law enforcement and better training around affective use of coercion.

However, police brutality toward the Roma minority remains a serious issue.

Graphic video footage shot by law enforcement officers in 2009 shows 6 Romani boys aged between 6-16 being forced to strip naked, kiss, and slap each other. It is alleged that the boys were then set upon by [[police dog]]s, with at least two sustaining serious injury. Officers attempted to justify their behaviour on the grounds that the boys were suspected of theft against an elderly citizen. However, [[cruel]], inhuman or degrading treatment by police, regardless of whether a crime has been suspected or committed, is prohibited under international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/bernard-rorke/slovakia-roma-exclusion-and-dark-side-of-democracy|work=Open Democracy | title=Slovakia: Roma exclusion and the dark side of democracy|date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 10 law enforcement officers involved have since been acquitted after the judge ruled the video inadmissible in court as it was obtained illegally.

Human rights watchdog's have raised concerns around police selectivity in making recordings of raids after a raid in the settlement of Vrbica in 2015 as they claim to have not thought the settlement would be problematic. This raid saw 15 men seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.romea.cz/en/news/world/slovak-ombud-says-police-raid-on-roma-settlement-was-unnecessary|work=Romea|title=Slovak ombud says police raid on Roma settlement was unnecessary | date=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often the experience of the Roma that on pressing charges in relation to police brutality, a counter- charge is often threatened by law enforcement, in an attempt to pressure the alleged victim into dropping the charges, which is particularly effective as the attitude toward the roma in Slovakia is so entrenched that lawyers are often reluctant to represent Romani victims.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, M (1999) 'Slovakia Since Independence: A Struggle for Democracy' p.137, Greenwood Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slovenia ===
While Slovenia is a fairly peaceful country, it is not without its faults. Minority groups in Slovenia, particularly the Roma and any residents from former Yugoslav republics face discrimination and sometimes brutality by Slovenian police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-AEXAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=police+brutality+slovenia#v=onepage&amp;q=police%2520brutality%2520slovenia&amp;f=false|title=Legitimacy and Criminal Justice: An International Perspective|last=Tyler|first=Tom R.|date=2007-10-25|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation|isbn=9781610445412|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roma, in particular, are targets because of how stereotyped they are as an inherently criminal population.&lt;ref name="Lobnikar 191–209"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lobnikar|first=Branko|last2=Hozjan|first2=Urška|last3=Šuklje|first3=Tina|last4=Banutai|first4=Emanuel|date=2014-04-03|title=Policing a multicultural community: a case study of the Roma community in northeastern Slovenia|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01924036.2013.819025|journal=International Journal of Comparative and Applied Criminal Justice|volume=38|issue=2|pages=191–209|doi=10.1080/01924036.2013.819025|issn=0192-4036}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roma often live in illegal settlements in very low socio-economic conditions, which contributes to their discrimination and their reputation as criminals.&lt;ref name="Lobnikar 191–209"/&gt; The Roma are one of the ethnic minorities from former Yugoslavic states known as 'the erased' who, after Slovenia's declaration of independence in 1991, lost all legal status, social, civil and political rights.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; This made them particularly vulnerable to police brutality.

The police have been known to occasionally use excessive force against detainees in prisons, as well as foreigners and other minority groups, although no police officer has ever been arrested or charged.&lt;ref name="Lobnikar 191–209"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; This made them particularly vulnerable to police brutality.

Several cases have been brought before the European Court concerning people who have died in police custody because Slovenian Police used excessive force and failed to properly investigate it.

The worst case of police brutality was the November 2012 protests. Political dissatisfaction spurred a series of protests in Maribor, Slovenia. For the most part, the protests were peaceful.&lt;ref name="Why Slovenia is content no more"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20591820|title=Why Slovenia is content no more|website=BBC|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crowds were chanting and non-violently, and for about two hours on 26 November 2012 (also known as, "the second Maribor uprising") they remained that way.&lt;ref name="Why Slovenia is content no more"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=c4c_1353964969 |title=Protests in Maribor, Slovenia (Police Brutality)|website=liveleak|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, crowds moved towards an area with a heavy police presence and that's when the violence started.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dnevnik.si"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dnevnik.si/1042565173/slovenija/zadnjic-je-v-maribor-notranji-minister-tako-priletel-ko-so-pocili-krambergerja/|title=Last in Maribor interior minister also flew when they are blasted by Kramberger (In Slovenian)|website=dnevnik|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police used excessive force to disperse the crowds, including tear gas, dragging and beating protesters, police dogs and even mounted police who indiscriminately charged into the crowd.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dnevnik.si"/&gt; Civilians, violent and non-violent protesters, and journalists alike were all targeted.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dnevnik.si"/&gt; Authorities attempted to justify the use of force by claiming protesters were violent and the use of force was necessary, not excessive.

Since 2003, Slovenian authorities have attempted to rectify this discrimination by introducing a two-day training programme on policing in a multi-ethnic community.&lt;ref name="Pliceand Minority Groups"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.nl/sites/default/files/public/ainl_police_and_minority_groups__eng_0.pdf6|title=Pliceand Minority Groups|website=Amnesty International USA|access-date=2016-07-22}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme involved teaching police about Roma culture and their language which served to break down some of the stereotypes that caused tension.&lt;ref name="Pliceand Minority Groups"/&gt; The Roma were made aware of their rights, and the police were educated about national and international standards regarding treatment of minorities.&lt;ref name="Pliceand Minority Groups"/&gt; The programme involved teaching police about Roma culture and their language which served to break down some of the stereotypes that caused tension.&lt;ref name="Pliceand Minority Groups"/&gt; It also helped to build trust between the Roma community and police.&lt;ref name="Pliceand Minority Groups"/&gt; Tensions still exist between the two groups, especially concerning police who have not participated in this programme, however they have been greatly reduced.&lt;ref name="Pliceand Minority Groups"/&gt;

=== South Africa ===
{{see also|Marikana killings}}

Reports of police brutality skyrocketed by over 300% in just a decade, with only one in 100 leading to a conviction. There were also 720 deaths in police custody due to police action in 2011/2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/south-africa-police-brutality-increase|title=South Africa reports of police brutality more than tripled in the last decade|first=David|last=Smith|date=22 August 2013|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, due to the police committing crimes such as rape, torture and murder, the cost of civil liabilities claims were so great that there was concern the costs would strain the South African Police Service national budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/police-brutality-rise-south-africa-officers-accused-killing-raping-citizens-2122712|title=Police Brutality On Rise In South Africa: Officers Accused Of Killing, Raping Citizens|date=1 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spain ===
Spanish police have developed a global reputation for brutality after images of clashes between demonstrators and police were spread on social networks and international news 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Police Brutality Accusations as protests span Spain|url=https://www.rt.com/news/spain-valencia-protests-violence-931/|website=RT News|accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two notable demonstrations are those that occurred in Barcelona on 27 May 2011, and in Madrid on 25 September 2012. Video footage made available online shows the use of force by police against peaceful demonstrators on both occasions. Images show officers using hand-held batons to repeatedly hit peaceful demonstrators, some of them in the face and neck, and the injuries caused. Police also used rubber bullets and pepper spray.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spain 2015/2016|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/spain/report-spain|website=Amnesty International|accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in spite of public outrage the Spanish government has made no attempt to reform policing and police mistreatment of the public. On the contrary, in July 2016 new reforms to the law on Public Security and the Criminal Code came into force which limit the right to freedom of assembly and give police officers the broad discretion to fine people who show a 'lack of respect' towards them.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; The Law on Public Security also includes an offence of spreading images of police officers in certain cases. The UN Human Rights Commission has expressed concern at the impact this legislation could have on human rights and police accountability.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; Fines for insulting a police officer can be up to €600 euros, and as much as €30,000 for spreading damaging photos of police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spain's New Public Safety Law Has Its Challengers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/world/europe/spains-new-public-safety-law-has-its-challengers.html?_r=1|accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International identifies three main areas of concern about police action during demonstrations and assemblies: excessive use of force and inappropriate use of riot equipment, excessive use of force when arresting demonstrators, and ill-treatment of detainees in police custody.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt;

The 2014 report of Torture in the Spanish State found at least 941 people were tortured by law enforcement in 2014- both in the context of demonstrations and other public situations and in police stations and prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Al menos 961 personas sufrieron torturas en 2014|url=https://www.diagonalperiodico.net/28588-al-menos-961-personas-sufrieron-torturas-2014.html|accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'The practice of torture is an everyday reality in Spain' claims Jorge del Cura, a spokesman for the Committee for the Prevention of Torture which collected 6621 complaints between 2004 and 2014. 'Day after day we receive information from people who have suffered all kinds of abuse and torture from stress positions, to push-ups, rape or physical assault.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Decade Of Brutality: Spain Police Raped, Tortured 6,600 People Between 2004 And 2014|url=http://anonhq.com/decade-brutality-spain-police-raped-tortured-6600-people-2004-2014/|accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were only 752 convictions of police for mistreatment during this 10-year period. 
Pau Perez, an advisor to the National Mechanism for the Prevention of Torture notes that of the torture allegations made against police 50% were from people belonging to social movements and 40% were from immigrants- indicating these are the two groups who suffer most from police brutality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=España ha vivido desde 2004 más de 6.600 casos de tortura o malos tratos policiales|url=http://www.publico.es/politica/espana-vivido-2004-mas-600.html|accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amnesty International and ACODI (Acción Contra la Discriminación) have both called out Spain for racial profiling and ethnic discrimination.&lt;ref name="https"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spain: Discrimination condoned by the authorities|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2011/12/spain-discrimination-condoned-authorities/|website=Amnesty International|accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="opensocietyfoundations.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Case Watch: Challenging Police Abuse in Spain|url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/case-watch-challenging-police-abuse-spain|website=Open Society Foundations|accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ACODI documented 612 cases of racial discrimination in a single year, emphasising that many of these did not lead to official complaints because victims fear police retaliation or believe their complaints will be ignored.&lt;ref name="opensocietyfoundations.org"/&gt; This belief is not unfounded; in 2005 Beauty Solomon, an African American immigrant working as a prostitute, filed two criminal complaints against Spanish policemen for repeated harassment and physical assault. In spite of eyewitness testimony and medical reports confirming her injuries the Spanish Courts dismissed her claims on the grounds of insufficient evidence.&lt;ref name="opensocietyfoundations.org"/&gt; Solomon then took her case to the European Court of Human Rights, who unanimously ruled in her favour that Spain had violated Article 3 (prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination) of the European Convention of Human Rights. They also condemned Spain for failing to investigate both Solomon's assault and other racist and sexist acts of violence by police officers.&lt;ref name="opensocietyfoundations.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty Solomon vs. Spain, discrimination based on race, gender and social status|url=http://www2.womenslinkworldwide.org/wlw/new.php?modo=detalle_proyectos&amp;dc=26&amp;lang=en|website=Women's Link Worldwide|accessdate=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomon's case is one of hundreds of similar cases in the ACODI report. Under Spanish law the police can check the identity of anyone in a public space when there is a security concern; however African and Latin American immigrant are most frequently targeted, and often without a legitimate security concern. "People who do not 'look Spanish' can be stopped by police as often as four times a day," said Izza Leghtas, an Amnesty International researcher.&lt;ref name="https"/&gt;

=== Sweden ===

Since the REVA (Legally Certain and Efficient Enforcement) project has been applied in Sweden in an attempt to deport illegal immigrants, it has exposed the brutal and illegal methods used by police. They harass and racially profile non-white Swedes who often live in segregated suburbs. The marginalised such as the poor, homeless, people of colour, users of illicit drugs and the mentally ill are facing Sweden as a Police State. This has resulted in social disobedience with ordinary people in Sweden updating others on Twitter and Facebook on the whereabouts of police.&lt;ref name="counterpunch.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/11/19/Swedish-police-racism-and-resistance|title=Swedish police racism and resistance|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====

In 2013 police shot a man in his own home in front of his wife in a town called Husby. The police said the man had been wielding and threatening them with a machete. The Stockholm riots, where more than 100 cars were torched, were set off after the Husby shooting. When the police showed up they had stones thrown at them. People said the police called them 'monkeys' and used batons against them in the clash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-22622909|title=Riots grip Stockholm suburbs after police shooting – BBC News|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=en-GB|access-date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013 a Swede of African origin was refused entry into a local club in Malmo for wearing traditional African clothes. The police picked him up and in the process of his arrest his arm was broken and he was locked in a cell for nearly six hours with no medical aid. Socially excluded groups have been targeted and the result of police investigations often mean the police officers are not deemed at fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/27/Sweden-punishes-its-rioters-and-its-police-very-differently|title=Sweden punishes it's rioters and it's police very differently|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common denominator for people on a special police list is being or married to a Romani person. A register of 4029 Romani people is kept by police. The police say the document is a register of criminal people and their associates used for fighting crime in Skane despite people being on it that have no connection with Skane or any association with criminal people.&lt;ref name="counterpunch.org" /&gt;

Police target apparent ethnicity at Stockholm subways for ID checks to see if they are illegal migrants. The police say they are 'following orders', the 'rule of law' and 'democratic process'.&lt;ref name="counterpunch.org" /&gt;

In February 2016, in Malmo, a nine-year-old was accused of not paying for a railway ticket. The police asked the security guards to stop the child. One guard tackled him to the ground and sat on him. He then pushed the child's face into the pavement hard and covered his mouth. The child can be heard screaming and gasping on the video that has gone viral on the internet. The police then put him in handcuffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20150209/station-guards-accused-of-violent-assault-on-boy-9|title=Guards investigated after child 'assault' in Malmö|last=|first=|date=|work=[[The Local]]|access-date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
[[File:Gezi Parkı Müdahale 2013-06-11 (46).jpg|thumb|A protester shows his wounded eye. Police brutality was one of the main issues arising from the [[2013 protests in Turkey]].]]
[[Turkey]] has a history of police brutality, including (particularly between 1977 and 2002) [[Torture in Turkey|the use of torture]]. Police brutality featuring excessive use of tear gas (including targeting protesters with tear gas canisters),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2013/07/aftermath-unrest-turkey | work=The Economist | title=Tear gas as a dangerous weapon}}&lt;/ref&gt; pepper spray and water cannon as well as physical violence against protesters has been seen, for example, in the suppression of Kurdish protests and [[International Workers' Day#Turkey|May Day demonstrations]]. The [[2013 protests in Turkey]] were in response to the brutal police suppression of an environmentalist sit-in protesting the removal of [[Taksim Gezi Park]].

In 2012 a number of officials received prison sentences for their role in the death in custody of political activist [[Engin Çeber]].

The European Court of Human Rights has noted the failure of the Turkish investigating authorities to carry out effective investigations into allegations of ill-treatment by law enforcement personnel during demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/Pages/search.aspx#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-122885%22]}|title=CASE OF İZCİ v. TURKEY - Judgment|publisher=European Court of Human Rights|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Great Britain ===
{{see also|#Northern Ireland (UK)}}

In 2015 the [[United Kingdom]] employed approximately 126,818 police officers in the 43 police forces of England, Wales and the British Transport Police, the lowest number since March 2002.&lt;ref name="gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/police-workforce-england-and-wales-31-march-2015/police-workforce-england-and-wales-31-march-2015 |title=Police workforce, England and Wales: 31 March 2015 |publisher=Home Office |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legislation and treaties====

The Criminal Law Act 1967, Common Law and the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) set out the law and acceptable use of force in the UK. The use of unnecessary physical force is in principle an infringement of ECHR Article 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.app.college.police.uk/app-content/public-order/core-principles-and-legislation/police-use-of-force/ |title=Police use of force |publisher=College of Policing |date=2013-10-23 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of force should be 'reasonable' in the circumstances. Physical force is appropriate if:

*it is absolutely necessary for a purpose permitted by law, and
*the amount of force used is reasonable and proportionate

This requires a consideration of the degree of force used. Any excessive use of force by a police officer is unlawful and an officer could thus be prosecuted under criminal law.

====Findings and statistics====

Since 2004/05, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) have published complaint statistics reports for England and Wales. In the 2014/15 annual report, the IPCC reported that there were 17 deaths in or following police custody and only one fatal police shooting in the last 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/annual-report-deaths-during-or-following-police-contact-201415-published |title=Annual report on deaths during or following police contact in 2014/15 published &amp;#124; Independent Police Complaints Commission |publisher=Independent Police Complaints Commission |date=2015-07-23 |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures were more than doubled when the IPCC was first erected. The annual report for 2015/16 is due to be published on the 26th of July 2016. A total of 37, 105 complaints were recorded in 2014/15, marking a 6% increase to the previous year, and a 62% overall increase since 2004/05.&lt;ref name="ipcc.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Documents/research_stats/complaints_statistics_2014_15.pdf |title=Police complaints - Statistics for England and Wales 2013/14 and 2012/13 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations of 'neglect or failure in duty' accounted for 34% of all allegations recorded whilst 'other assault' and 'oppressive conduct' or harassment made up only 8% and 6% respectively.&lt;ref name="ipcc.gov.uk"/&gt;

====Public dissatisfaction and discrimination====

Despite an average reduction in deaths in custody since 2004, a 2014 Public Confidence Survey revealed that public satisfaction following contact with the police was falling and that there was a greater willingness to complain.&lt;ref name="ipcc.gov.uk"/&gt; The Metropolitan Police, who operate in some of the most ethnically diverse parts of the UK, received the greatest number of complaints in 2014/15 with 6,828. However, young people and people from black or minority ethic groups were much less likely to come forward with complaints.&lt;ref name="ipcc.gov.uk"/&gt;

Whilst instances of police brutality in the UK is comparatively less than its US counterparts, there are nonetheless high profile incidents that have received wide media coverage. As of 2016, more than 140 people from black or other minority ethnic groups have died under police custody from 1990. The use of excessive force has been used on an array of demographics of British citizens, however police brutality against ethnic and minority groups often attract wide media coverage. Whilst some have argued that this is discriminatory or evidence of institutional racism, others have asserted that it is largely due to over policing in areas that are perceived as high-risk areas such as Northumberland or Bedfordshire.

====Examples====

In 2009, [[Death of Ian Tomlinson|Ian Tomlinson]] was killed when he was hit in the head with a baton and shoved to the ground at the G20 protests in the [[City of London]]. PC Simon Harwood was an officer of the [[Territorial Support Group]] (TSG), a unit of the Metropolitan Police Service, until he was sacked for the altercation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-20821048 |title=Met riot police 'must reduce use of excessive force' |publisher=BBC News |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident attracted criticism of both the "militaristic approach" of the TSG and the small number of complaints upheld by the Metropolitan Police despite referrals by the IPCC.

In May 2013, 21-year-old Julian Cole was arrested outside a nightclub in Bedford by six police officers. The altercation left Mr Cole in a vegetative state due to a severed spinal cord. Expert evidence indicated that Mr Cole was struck with considerable force on his neck whilst his head was pulled back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vikram Dodd |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/26/julian-cole-ipcc-police-brutality-allegations |title=Julian Cole family hit out at IPCC over police brutality allegations &amp;#124; UK news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite calls by the IPCC to suspend the officers, Bedfordshire chief constable Colette Paul refused to place the six police officers on restricted duties despite being under criminal investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vikram Dodd |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/11/suspend-offcers-involved-in-broken-neck-incident-family-tells-police-chief |title=Suspend officers involved in broken neck incident, family tells police chief &amp;#124; UK news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bedfordshire police deny allegations that the use of excessive force on the unarmed 5&amp;nbsp;ft 5in student was race-related.

On 20 February 2014, [[Bedfordshire Police]] Constables Christopher Thomas and Christopher Pitts, chased Faruk Ali before allegedly knocking him over and punching him in the face outside his family home. Mr Ali was described an autistic man who had the mental age of a five-year-old.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-35987385 |title=Faruk Ali case: Bedfordshire Police officers sacked for gross misconduct |publisher=BBC News |date= |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police officers who were accused of laughing throughout the ordeal, were cleared of misconduct in public office by the [[Aylesbury Crown Court]]. Following an investigation by the IPCC, the officers were sacked following breaches of standards of professional conduct including standards of honesty, integrity, authority, equality and diversity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

{{Main|Police brutality in the United States}}
In the United States, major political and social movements have involved excessive force by police, including the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1960s, anti-war demonstrations, the [[War on Drugs]], and the [[Global War on Terrorism]]. In 2014, the UN Committee against Torture condemned police brutality and excessive use of force by law enforcement in the US, and highlighted the "frequent and recurrent police shootings or fatal pursuits of unarmed black individuals."&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Nebehay (November 28, 2014).

Retrieved March 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2016 report by the United Nations' Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, "contemporary police killings and the trauma that they create are reminiscent of the past racial terror of [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tharoor|first=Ishaan |date=September 27, 2016 |title= U.S. owes black people reparations for a history of ‘racial terrorism,’ says U.N. panel|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/09/27/u-s-owes-black-people-reparations-for-a-history-of-racial-terrorism-says-u-n-panel/|work= [[The Washington Post]]|location= |access-date=May 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police officers are legally permitted to [[Use of force in law enforcement|use force]], and their superiors — and the public — expect them to do so. According to [[Jerome Herbert Skolnick]], in dealing largely with disorderly elements of the society, some people working in law enforcement may gradually develop an attitude or sense of authority over society, particularly under traditional reaction-based policing models; in some cases the police believe that they are above the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skolnick|first=Jerome H.|author2=Fyfe, James D.|editor=Winters, Paul A.|title=Policing the Police|year=1995|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego|isbn=1-56510-262-2|pages=45–55|chapter=Community-Oriented Policing Would Prevent Police Brutality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many reasons as to why police officers can sometimes be excessively aggressive. It is thought that psychopathy makes some officers more susceptible to the use of excessive force than others. In one study, police psychologists were surveyed on officers who had used excessive force. The information obtained allowed the researchers to develop five unique types of officers, only one of which was similar to the bad apple stereotype. These include personality disorders, previous traumatic job-related experience, young inexperienced or authoritarian officers; officers who learn inappropriate patrol styles, and officers with personal problems. Schrivers categorizes groups of officers, separating the group that most likely use excessive force.&lt;ref&gt;Scrivner, 1994: 3–6&lt;/ref&gt; However, this "bad apple paradigm" is considered by some to be an "easy way out". A broad report commissioned by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on the causes of misconduct in policing calls it "a simplistic explanation that permits the organization and senior management to blame corruption on individuals and individual faults – behavioural, psychological, background factors, and so on, rather than addressing systemic factors."&lt;ref name="RCMP Review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Loree|first=Don|title=Corruption in Policing: Causes and Consequences; A Review of the Literature|work=Research and Evaluation Community, Contract and Aboriginal Policing Services Directorate|publisher=Royal Canadian Mounted Police|year=2006|url=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection/PS64-27-2006E.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report goes on to discuss the systemic factors, which include:
* Pressures to conform to certain aspects of "police culture", such as the [[Blue Code of Silence]], which can "sustain an oppositional criminal subculture protecting the interests of police who violate the law"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/15614260290011309|last=Skolnick|first=Jerome H.|title=Corruption and the Blue Code of Silence|journal=Police Practice and Research|volume=3|year=2002|page=7|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "'we-they' perspective in which outsiders are viewed with suspicion or distrust"&lt;ref name="RCMP Review" /&gt;
* Command and control structures with a rigid hierarchical foundation ("results indicate that the more rigid the authoritarian hierarchy, the lower the scores on a measure of ethical decision-making" concludes one study reviewed in the report);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Owens|first=Katherine M. B.|author2=Jeffrey Pfeifer|title=Police Leadership and Ethics: Training and Police Recommendations|journal=The Canadian Journal of Police and Security Services|volume=1|page=7|year=2002|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* Deficiencies in internal accountability mechanisms (including internal investigation processes).&lt;ref name="RCMP Review" /&gt;

Police use of force is not kept in check in many jurisdictions by the issuance of a [[use of force continuum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stetser|first=Merle|title=The Use of Force in Police Control of Violence: Incidents Resulting in Assaults on Officers|year=2001|publisher=LFB Scholarly Publishing L.L.C.|location=New York|isbn=1-931202-08-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A use of force continuum sets levels of force considered appropriate in direct response to a victims behavior. This power is granted by the government, with few if any limits set out in [[statutory law]] as well as [[common law]].

Violence used by police can be excessive despite being lawful, especially in the context of political repression. Indeed, "police brutality" is often used to refer to violence used by the police to achieve politically desirable ends (terrorism) and, therefore, when none should be used at all according to widely held values and cultural norms in the society (rather than to refer to excessive violence used where at least some may be considered justifiable).

Studies show that there are officers who believe the legal system they serve is failing and that it is their duty to pick up the slack. This is known as "vigilantism", where the officer involved may think the suspect deserves more punishment than what they may have to serve under the court system.&lt;ref&gt;Chevigny, P. (2008). "Police Brutality", In Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace and Conflict. oxford: Elsevier Science and Technology, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

During high-speed pursuits of suspects, officers can become angry and filled with adrenaline, which can affect their judgment when they finally assault the victim. The resulting loss of judgment and heightened emotional state can result in inappropriate use of force. The effect is colloquially known as "high-speed pursuit syndrome."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin Mullen |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/e/a/1996/04/05/EDITORIAL9376.dtl |title=The high-speed chase syndrome |work=SFGate |date=1996-04-05 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of Police brutality in America  ===
{{Original research section|date=December 2017}}

Police brutality is the misuse of power by police force to intentionally harm individuals. The excessive force imposed by police officers has grown dramatically over the past decade, causing social misinterpretations of the role that police officers play in the community.

''In 2015, the percentage of people who have confidence in the police hit its lowest since 1993 at 52 percent.[[Police brutality#cite%20note-%3A1-137|&lt;sup&gt;[137]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Of this 52 percent democrats saw the biggest drop in confidence. Democrats' confidence in police dropped 13 percentage points over the last two years compared with 2012–2013, a larger change than for any other subgroup. Over the same period, Independents' and Republicans' confidence in police has not changed. As a result, Democrats (42%) now have less confidence in police than independents (51%) and remain much less confident than Republicans (69%).[[Police brutality#cite%20note-%3A1-137|&lt;sup&gt;[137]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Most importantly however is the number of Black people that have lost trust in the police over the last two years: Black people's confidence in police has averaged 30 percent, well below the national average of 53% and much lower than for any other subgroup. Black people's confidence is down six points from 2012 to 2013, similar to the four-point drop among all Americans.[[Police brutality#cite%20note-%3A1-137|&lt;sup&gt;[137]&lt;/sup&gt;]]''

''The same study found that the number of White people who identify as democrat have lost the same amount of confidence in the police as Black people, as White Democrats' confidence declined 11 points over the last two years, similar to the 14-point decline among non-White Democrats the sample sizes are not large enough to break out Black Democrats separately, but the limited data suggest their confidence declined no more than that of White Democrats.[[Police brutality#cite%20note-%3A1-137|&lt;sup&gt;[137]&lt;/sup&gt;]] This decreased confidence in police officers is harming relations and affecting how many people deal with and respond to police which in turn leads to more hostility from police in the United States. This has also lead to many cities making police wear body armor and cameras on them at all times.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=CGI|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springerreference_61782|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The repercussions of police officers’ “excessive force“ of those who find themselves in confrontation with authorities are non-existent. Authorities have legal right over how the respond and treat suspects, police officers may justifiably escalate the use of force with mere commands… but commands from who? Therefore, police officers receive little to no punishment for willingly and forcefully hurting civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alpert|first=Geoffrey P.|last2=Smith|first2=William C.|date=1994|title=How Reasonable Is the Reasonable Man?: Police and Excessive Force|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1144107|journal=The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology (1973-)|volume=85|issue=2|pages=481|doi=10.2307/1144107|issn=0091-4169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hands Up Don’t Shoot'''

The Constitution states that police officers are legally allowed to shoot in the instance that they feel the need to protect their lives or an innocent life or to prevent the suspect from escaping and posing a dangerous threat to the of bystanders in society. The Supreme Court Decision of [[Tennessee v. Garner]] made it possible to shoot a fleeing suspect ONLY if they may cause harm to innocent people so that authorities are not just shoot every suspect that tries to escape.

''In the United States there are one hundred sixty million more Caucasian people than there are Black people.[[Police brutality#cite%20note-%3A0-134|&lt;sup&gt;[134]&lt;/sup&gt;]] However, being thirteen percent of the country's population, Black people are twenty four percent of the number of people killed by cops as of 2015.[[Police brutality#cite%20note-%3A0-134|&lt;sup&gt;[134]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Due to the increased rate of the number of Black people killed by the police there has been an increased distrust of the police in the United States.''  

Society would like to believe that police officers and protectors are not biased towards the victims of police brutality, we hope that everything law enforcement does is to better protect us. As history repeats and more and more Black Americans lose their lives, this gives reason to believe that different geographic locations carry different political and social views, therefore police officers are biased towards those they decide to abuse, instead of allowing the justice system to properly serve justice.

'''Stereotypes'''

Lorie Fridell, Associate Professor of criminology at University of South Florida states that "racial profiling was the number one issue facing police [in the 1990's].” Which leads her to understand two things: “bias in policing was not just a few officers in a few departments and, overwhelmingly, the police in this country are well-intentioned.” The country as a whole sets stereotypes as well as biases against Black Americans which inevitably leads to social misinterpretation of the safety of Americans when a Black person is present.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-32740523|title=Why do US police keep killing black men?|date=2015-05-26|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An experiment done in Mekawi during 2014 conducted on White undergraduate female students suggests that there is a higher degree of fear of racial minorities which gives reason for authorities to believe racial minorities are dangerous, hence so many shootings of minorities. The  experiment exemplifies the dehumanization and lack of empathetic concern for minorities displayed by citizen of racial majority.

Incidents resulting in high profile deaths of innocent Black men such like Eric Garner in New York City, Tamir Rice in Cleveland, and Freddie Gray in Baltimore shows the Black community that they can no longer trust the police force. As a result of this lack of trust in police officers, the Black society have formulated many social organizations; founded in 2013, the [[Black Lives Matter|Black Lives Matter Movement]] made a social impact on the world in a response the violent and systematic racism that Black people still face by police officers.

While the Justice Department reported that Cleveland police officers used “excessive deadly force, including shootings and head strikes with impact weapons; unnecessary, excessive, and retaliatory force, including Tasers, chemical sprays, and their fists” on the victim, there was no real repercussions from their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hines|first=Sandra|date=2017-09-21|title=Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1332/policypress/9781447327868.003.0019|journal=Policy Press|doi=10.1332/policypress/9781447327868.003.0019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Black Americans V. US Police Department'''

Another report released concerning the [[Shooting of Michael Brown|Michael Brown shooting]] in Ferguson, Missouri, the Justice Department admits to the pattern of racial bias of the Police Department in Ferguson. The department argues that it is typically an effort to ticket as many low-income Black residents as possible in an attempt to raise local budget revenue through fines and court fees. The Justice Department explains, police encounters could get downright abusive when the person being questioned by the police officers gets disrespectful or challenges their authority.

In addition, The Department of Justice released a statement that confronts police officers’ susceptibility to implicit bias: One of the things they looked at is what they called threat perception failure. The officer believed that the person was armed and it turned out not to be the case. And these failures were more likely to occur when the subject was Black.

'''Statistics'''

''In the United States in the late 2010s there has been a increase in the number of police brutality cases. The number of deaths caused by a police officer have slightly increased from 397 to 426 deaths in the last reporting year which was 2013.[[Police brutality#cite%20note-244|&lt;sup&gt;[244]&lt;/sup&gt;]]''

In addition, In a study done by Research Triangle Institute in 2015, Arrest Related Deaths were ranked higher than Supplementary Homicide Reports in US deaths by approximately 4%. Police officers are killing more citizens at a higher rate than citizens are killing each other.

In the year of 2017 there were 1,147 deaths accounted for by police, 13 of which police officers were charged with a crime. 640 of the deaths caused by police officers that year, were responses to non-violent offenses and no crime was reported. 149 people killed by the police were unarmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://policeviolencereport.org/|title=2017 Police Violence Report|website=policeviolencereport.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, studies have shown that "Black people are three times more likely to be killed by police in the United States than White people. More unarmed Black people were killed by police than unarmed White people last year,” give. the fact that only 14% of the population are Black people.&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;

== Investigation ==
In [[England and Wales]], an independent organization known as the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] investigates reports of police misconduct. They automatically investigate any deaths caused by, or thought to be caused by, police action.

A similar body operates in Scotland, known as the [[Police Investigations and Review Commissioner]]. In Northern Ireland the [[Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland]] has a similar role to that of the IPCC and PIRC.

In Africa, there exists two such bodies, one in South Africa and another one in Kenya known as the Independent Policing Oversight Authority.

In the United States, police are increasingly using police body-worn cameras during this [[The Age of Ferguson|Age of Ferguson.]] Since Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, Missouri, the US Department of Justice has made a call to action for police departments across the nation to implement body-worn cameras into their departments so further investigation will be possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Investigation of the Ferguson Police Department|last=|first=|date=2015|newspaper=|access-date=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it is measured ==
Police brutality is measured based on the accounts of people who have experienced or seen it, as well as the juries who are present for trials involving police brutality cases. This is because there is no way to quantify the use of excessive force for any particular situation. Back is 1985 only one out of five people thought that police brutality was a serious problem. Police brutality is relative to a situation, it depends on if the suspected person(s) is(are) resisting. Out of the people who were surveyed about their account with the police brutality in 2008, only about 12% felt as if they had been resisting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bureau of Justice Statistics|title=Use of Force|url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&amp;tid=703|website=Bureau of Justice Statistics|publisher=Office of Justice Programs|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although police force itself cannot be quantified, the opinion of brutality among various races, genders, and ages can. African Americans, women, and younger people are more likely to have negative opinions about police than Caucasians, men, and middle-aged to elderly individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jefferis|first1=Eric|last2=Butcher|first2=Fredrick|last3=Hanley|first3=Dena|title=Measuring perceptions of police use of force|journal=Police Practice and Research|date=2012|volume=13|issue=6|pages=81–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Independent oversight ==
Various community groups have criticized police brutality. These groups often stress the need for oversight by independent civilian review boards and other methods of ensuring accountability for police action.

Umbrella organizations and justice committees (often named after a deceased individual or those victimized by police violence) usually engage in a solidarity of those affected. [[Amnesty International]] is another organization active in the issue of police brutality. Amnesty International, also known as AI, is a non-governmental organization focused on human rights with over 3
million members and supporters around the world. The stated objective of the organization is "to conduct research and generate action to prevent and end grave abuses of human rights, and to demand justice for those whose rights have been violated."

Tools used by these groups include video recordings, which are sometimes broadcast using websites such as [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=YouTube.com prompts police beating probe |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2645350&amp;CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 |agency=Associated Press |last=Veiga |first=Alex |date=November 11, 2006 |accessdate=2006-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130233223/http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2645350&amp;CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 |archivedate=November 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilians have begun independent projects to monitor police activity in an effort to reduce violence and misconduct. These are often called "Cop Watch" programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Policing the Police: Civilian Video Monitoring of Police Activity|url=http://theglobaljournal.net/group/global-minds/article/643/|publisher=[[The Global Journal]]|last=Krupanski|first=Marc|date=March 7, 2012|accessdate=2012-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper supervision by competent police supervisors and administration can reduce police misconduct.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1655">In [[Chinese philosophy]], '''qing''' (情) is a concept translated variously as "reality", "feelings,"&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, C. Daoist-oriented interpretations: Concept Articles. URL= &lt;http://www.philosophy.hku.hk/ch/concepts.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; "genuine", "essence", "disposition", or "emotion". [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucians]] understand ''qing'' as products of environmental circumstances affecting ''[[Nature (philosophy)#Eastern civilization and the philosophical question of nature|xing]]'', or innate human nature.&lt;ref&gt;Theobald, U.

URL=&lt;http://www.chinaknowledge.de/Literature/Classics/neoconfucianism.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation of ''qing'' as an emotional or dispositional concept, especially as connected to ''xing'', arose after the [[Warring States period]]. A broader, or at least earlier, [[Confucianism|Confucian]] interpretation would be the behavioral quality of a person given their context. For Confucians, who emphasized cultivation of ''[[Ren (Confucianism)|ren]]'' (humaneness), ''[[Li (Confucian)|li]]'' (ritual propriety), and ''[[Yi (Confucianism)|yi]]'' (righteousness) to build ''[[De (Chinese)|de]]'', or virtuous moral character.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanhoe, P.J., &amp; Van Norden, B.W.

==Life and career==
Jordan-Young completed her undergraduate work at [[Bryn Mawr College]]. She earned her master's degree and Ph.D. from [[Columbia University]].

Jordan-Young was a principal investigator and deputy director of the Social Theory Core at the Center for Drug Use and HIV Research of the [[National Development and Research Institutes]]. She has served as a [[health disparities]] scholar sponsored by the [[National Institutes of Health]]. In 2008, Jordan-Young was a visiting scholar in [[cognitive neuroscience]] at the [[International School for Advanced Studies]].&lt;ref name="johnson2011"&gt;Johnson, Jane'a; McLean, Lindsey (December 1, 2011).

She is the author of ''Brain Storm: The Flaws in the Science of Sex Differences'', a critical analysis of scientific research supporting the theory that [[sex and psychology|psychological sex differences]] in humans are "hard-wired" into the brain. Jordan-Young argues that studies of “human brain organization theory,” fail to meet scientific standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674063518 Brain Storm: The Flaws in the Science of Sex Differences], [[Harvard University Press]], September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rivers2011"&gt;Rivers, Caryl; Barnett, Rosalind C.

In ''Out of Bounds? A Critique of the New Policies on Hyperandrogenism in Elite Female Athletes'', a collaborative article with [[Katrina Karkazis]], [[Georgiann Davis]], and Silvia Camporesi, published in 2012 in the ''[[American Journal of Bioethics]]'', the authors argue that a new sex testing policy by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] aimed at [[intersex]] women athletes will not protect against breaches of privacy, will require athletes to undergo unnecessary treatment in order to compete, and will intensify "gender policing". They recommend that athletes be able to compete in accordance with their legal gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karkazis | first1 = Katrina | authorlink = Katrina Karkazis | authorlink2 = Georgiann Davis | last2 = Davis | first2 = Georgiann | last3 = Jordan-Young | first3 = Rebecca | last4 = Camporesi | first4 = Silvia | year = 2012 | title = Out of Bounds?

'''Robert Black''' (21 April 1947 – 12 January 2016) was a Scottish [[serial killer]] and [[paedophile]] who was convicted of the [[kidnap]], [[rape]], [[sexual assault]] and [[murder]] of four girls aged between 5 and 11 in a series of killings committed between 1981 and 1986 in the United Kingdom.

Black was convicted of the kidnapping, rape and murder of three girls on 19 May 1994. He was also convicted of the kidnapping of a fourth girl, and had earlier been convicted of the kidnapping and sexual assault of a fifth. He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of 35 years.

Black was further convicted of the 1981 sexual assault and murder of nine-year-old Jennifer Cardy in 2011, and at the time of his death was regarded as the prime suspect in the 1978 disappearance and murder of 13-year-old [[Disappearance of Genette Tate|Genette Tate]]. Black may also have been responsible for several other unsolved child murders throughout Britain, Ireland and [[continental Europe]] between 1969 and 1987.

The nationwide [[manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] for Black was one of the most exhaustive UK murder investigations of the 20th century. He died in prison in 2016.&lt;!-- PER WP:LEADCITE ALL THIS IS CITED IN THE BODY --&gt;

==Early life==

===Childhood===
Robert Black was born in [[Grangemouth]], [[Stirlingshire]], on 21 April 1947, the [[illegitimacy|illegitimate]] child of Jessie Hunter Black and an unknown father. His mother originally planned to have him adopted before she emigrated to Australia to escape the stigma of his birth.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=131}} He was not adopted,{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=23}} and at six months old was placed with an experienced, middle-aged [[foster care|foster couple]] in [[Kinlochleven]] named Tulip. He adopted their surname.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|pp=11–13}}

Black showed antisocial tendencies{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=23}} and became known as an aggressive child with few friends.&lt;ref name ="tough"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tough-wee-boy-turned-killer-1437311.html|title='Tough wee boy' turned killer|access-date=15 July 2016|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=19 May 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was prone to tantrums and vandalised school property. He was also a target for bullying among children his own age, and became a bully towards younger children. Though his foster mother insisted upon cleanliness, he cared little for his own hygiene and was called "Smelly Bobby Tulip" by classmates.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13039109.Predator_with_a_grotesque_history_of_abuse/|title=Predator with a grotesque history of abuse|newspaper=Herald Scotland|date=28 October 2011|access-date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of five, Black and a girl the same age compared their [[genitalia]], triggering a childhood belief within Black that he should have been born female,{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=13}} and he developed a deep interest in his genitalia, the genitals of female children, and [[body orifice]]s. From the age of eight he would regularly insert objects in his own anus, a practice he carried into adulthood.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=24}}

Locals later recalled seeing bruises on Black's face and limbs, suggesting he had been physically abused by his foster parents. Black stated he could not recollect their origin, and they may have resulted from childhood fights.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=15}} Despite being adamant he could not recall the origin of these bruises, Black was a [[Nocturnal enuresis|chronic bed wetter]], and freely admitted to being berated and beaten by his foster mother for each offence.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=15}}

By 1958 the Tulips had both died, and he was placed with another foster family in Kinlochleven. He soon committed his first known sexual assault, dragging a young girl into a public lavatory and fondling her.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2365}} His foster mother reported the offence and insisted he be removed from her home.{{sfnp|Church|1996|pp=24–25}}

===Adolescence===
Black was placed in a mixed-sex children's home on the outskirts of [[Falkirk]]. Here he regularly exposed himself to girls, and on one occasion, he forcibly removed the underwear of a girl.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=25}} As a result, he was sent to Red House Care Home, a high-discipline, all-male establishment in [[Musselburgh]]. At this new location Black was sexually abused by a male staff member&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; for three years; typically by being forced to perform [[fellatio]]. During this time he studied at [[Musselburgh Grammar School]], developing an interest in football and swimming. Other students recall him as taciturn, with few friends.

In 1963, Black left the Red House Care Home. With assistance from child welfare agencies, he moved to another boys' home in [[Greenock]] and obtained a job as a butcher's delivery boy. He later said that he had fondled thirty to forty young girls while making deliveries if, upon calling at the house, he discovered young girls were alone in the premises.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=26}} None of these incidents seem to have been reported.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=25}}

==First conviction==
On a summer evening in 1963, Black encountered a seven-year-old girl playing alone in a park; he lured the child to a deserted [[air-raid shelter]] on the pretext of showing her some kittens. There he held the girl by the throat until she lost consciousness, then masturbated over her body.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=19}} The following day, Black was arrested and charged with lewd and libidinous behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8852899/Robert-Black-guilty-of-fourth-child-murder-the-victims.html/|title=Robert Black guilty of fourth child murder: the victims|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=27 October 2011|access-date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[mental status examination|psychiatric examination]] suggested the incident was an isolated one, and that Black was not in need of treatment;{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=27}} as a result he was [[admonition|admonished]] for the offence.

Shortly after, Black moved to Grangemouth, where he lodged with an elderly couple and worked for a builders' supply company. He began dating a young woman he met at a local youth club. This was his only known girlfriend,{{sfnp|Wyre|Tate|1995|p=60}} and they dated for several months. According to Black, he had asked this woman to marry him, and was devastated when she abruptly ended their relationship, in part due to his unusual sexual demands.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=27}}

In 1966 Black's landlords discovered he had molested their nine-year-old granddaughter whenever she visited their household. They evicted him but did not inform police, wanting to spare their granddaughter further trauma.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=21}} Black lost his job soon after, and he returned to Kinlochleven, where he lodged with a married couple who had a six-year-old daughter.

===Borstal sentence===
Within a year, Black's new landlords informed police that he had repeatedly molested their daughter. He pleaded guilty to three counts of [[indecent assault]] against a child. He was sentenced to a year at Polmont [[Borstal]] in [[Brightons]], which specialised in training and [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitating]] of serious youthful offenders. Although he later spoke freely about every aspect of his youth and adolescence—including the sexual abuse he had suffered at the Red House Care Home—he refused to discuss Polmont Borstal beyond saying he had vowed to never again be imprisoned; this has led to speculation that he may have been brutalised there.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=22}}

==Relocation to London==
In September 1968, six months after his release from Polmont Borstal,&lt;ref name ="tough"/&gt; Black moved to [[London]], where he initially found lodgings in a [[bedsit]] close to [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]]. Between 1968 and 1970, he supported himself through various—often casual—jobs.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=30}} One of these was as a [[lifeguard]] at a [[Hornsey]] swimming pool, where he was soon fired for fondling a young girl; no charges were brought.

Via a contact he had met at a King's Cross bookshop,{{sfnp|Wyre|Tate|1995|p=47}} Black began to collect [[child pornography]].{{sfnp|Wyre|Tate|1995|p=47}} Initially, much of this material was in magazine and photograph format, although he later expanded this material to include videos depicting graphic [[child sexual abuse]]. As Black was a keen [[photographer]], he sometimes also discreetly photographed children (mostly girls between eight and twelve)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-15339312|title=Robert Black trial: Jury hears defendant spied on young girls|work=BBC News|date=17 October 2011|access-date=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=161}}{{sfnp|Wilson|2007|p=156}} at locations such as swimming pools; he stored these images alongside his pornographic material in locked suitcases.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=30}}

Black frequented the Three Crowns, a [[Stamford Hill]] pub, where he became known as a proficient darts player. There he also met a Scottish couple, Edward and Kathy Rayson. In 1972, he moved into their attic. The Raysons considered Black a responsible if somewhat reclusive tenant who gave them no cause for complaint beyond his poor hygiene. They suspected Black of viewing pornographic material, but had no idea it might be paedophilic. Black remained their lodger until his arrest in 1990.{{sfnp|Church|1996|pp=160–161}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tough-wee-boy-turned-killer-1437311.html|title='Tough Wee Boy' Turned Killer|access-date=13 May 2017|newspaper=The Independent|date=19 May 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-distance driving employment===
To increase his scope for casual work, in the mid-1970s Black bought a white [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]] van to enable him to commit to driving for a living.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2363}} In 1976, Black obtained a permanent job as a van driver for Poster, Dispatch and Storage Ltd,{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=32}} a [[Hoxton]]-based firm whose fleet delivered posters—typically depicting pop stars—and billboard advertisements to locations across the UK, Ireland and continental Europe. To his employers, Black was a conscientious employee who was willing to undertake the long-distance deliveries some of his married co-workers disliked.

While working as a driver, Black developed a thorough knowledge of much of the UK road network, subsequently enabling him to snatch children across the entire country and dispose of their bodies hundreds of miles from the site of their abduction.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2371}} To reduce the chance of being identified by eyewitnesses, Black often adjusted his appearance by alternately growing a beard or appearing clean-shaven, and occasionally shaved his head completely bald. Black also owned over a dozen pairs of spectacles, and would wear a pair significantly different from those he regularly wore when abducting children.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2367}} He also covered the rear windows of his van with opaque black curtains.

==First murders==

===Jennifer Cardy===
The first murder Black is proven to have committed was that of nine-year-old Jennifer Cardy, who was abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered on 12 August 1981.&lt;ref name="Belfast Telegraph 27 October 2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/tragic-jennifer-cardys-final-few-hours-28674140.html|title=Tragic Jennifer Cardy's final few hours|newspaper=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|date=27 October 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardy was last seen by her mother at 1:40&amp;nbsp;p.m. as she cycled to a friend's house in [[Ballinderry, County Antrim]]; she never arrived.

Hours later, Cardy's bicycle was discovered less than a mile from her home, covered with branches and leaves. The stand of the bicycle was down, suggesting that she had stopped her bicycle to converse with her abductor.&lt;ref name="Belfast Telegraph 27 October 2011"/&gt; A search aided by 200 volunteers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19810818&amp;id=c6MyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0e4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1278,4355118&amp;hl=en|title=Search for lost girl unites Irish|newspaper=The Citizen, Ottawa|date=19 August 1981|access-date=6 July 2016|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; found nothing further.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=10}}

Six days later, hunters discovered Cardy's body {{convert|16|mi|km}} from her home, in a reservoir near a [[Rest area#Lay-bys|lay-by]] in [[Hillsborough, County Down|Hillsborough]].&lt;ref name=BBCOct2011/&gt; A pathologist noted signs of sexual abuse on Cardy's body and underwear;&lt;ref name="The Irish Times 11 October 2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/man-on-trial-over-ni-girl-s-murder-1.885065|title=Man on trial over NI girl's murder|newspaper=Irish Times|date=11 October 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the autopsy concluded she had died of [[drowning]]—most likely accompanied by [[ligature strangulation]].&lt;ref name="The Irish Times 11 October 2011"/&gt; The watch she had been wearing had stopped at 5:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="Ulster Star"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lisburn.com/archives/info/news-2011/jennnifer-cardy3.html|title=Accused is a convicted child killer, jury is told|newspaper=Ulster Star|date=2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the body near a major arterial road between [[Belfast]] and [[Dublin]] led police to suspect her murderer had been familiar with the area. The reservoir she had been found in was near a route frequented by long-distance delivery drivers,&lt;ref name="Herald1981"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19810819&amp;id=eO5AAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lKcMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3576,3493677&amp;hl=en|title=Missing Ulster girl found murdered|newspaper=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Glasgow Herald]]|date=19 August 1981|access-date=6 July 2016|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the killer may have travelled extensively.&lt;ref name="Herald1981"/&gt;
[[File:The road to Cornhill - geograph.org.uk - 1195591.jpg|thumb|right|The [[A697 road|A697]] towards [[Cornhill-on-Tweed]]. Black is believed to have abducted Susan Maxwell as she walked along this road on 30 July 1982]]

===Susan Maxwell===
Black's second confirmed victim was 11-year-old Susan Claire Maxwell, who lived in [[Cornhill-on-Tweed]] on the English side of the [[Anglo-Scottish border]]. Maxwell was abducted on 30 July 1982 as she walked home from playing tennis in [[Coldstream]]. She was last seen alive at 4:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.,{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=34}} crossing the bridge over the [[River Tweed]], and was likely abducted by Black shortly after.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2363}}

The following day a search was mounted. [[Search and rescue dog|Search dogs]] were used, and at peak 300 officers were assigned full-time; a thorough search was made of every property in both Cornhill and Coldstream and over 80 square miles of terrain. Several people reported having seen a white van in the locality; one said a van had been parked in a field gateway off the [[A697 road|A697]].{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=49}}

On 12 August, Maxwell's body was found by a lorry driver; her body was covered with [[undergrowth]], and was clothed save for her shoes and underwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/susan-maxwell-seen-alone-before-disappearance-triple-murder-trial-told-of-surprise-at-sighting-1370277.html|title=Susan Maxwell 'seen alone before disappearance': Triple murder trial told of surprise at sighting|access-date=27 October 2011|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=16 April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise date and cause of her death could not be determined due to decomposition. Maxwell had been bound, and gagged with sticking plaster, and her underwear had been removed and  folded beneath her head, suggesting that she had been sexually assaulted.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=34}}

A [[coroner#inquest|coroner's inquest]] concluded Maxwell had died shortly after being abducted.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=59}} Evidently, Maxwell remained in Black's van—alive or dead—for over 24 hours,{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=37}} as his delivery schedule encompassed [[Edinburgh]], [[Dundee]], and finally [[Glasgow]], where he made his final delivery close to midnight on 30 July. The following day, Black returned from Glasgow to London, discarding the body in a [[thicket|copse]] beside the [[A518 road]] near [[Uttoxeter]], {{convert|264|mi|km}} from where Maxwell had been abducted.{{refn|group=n|One of Black's colleagues suspected Black might have been involved in Maxwell's abduction and murder. When this colleague quizzed Black as to his whereabouts on the day concerned, Black claimed he had not been near the [[Anglo-Scottish border]]. This employee did not relay his concerns to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tough-wee-boy-turned-killer-1437311.html/|title='Tough Wee Boy' Turned Killer|newspaper=The Independent|date=19 May 1994|access-date=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Caroline Hogg===
Five-year-old Caroline Hogg, Black's youngest known victim, disappeared while playing outside her Beach Lane home in the Edinburgh suburb of [[Portobello, Edinburgh|Portobello]] in the early evening of 8 July 1983.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph 27 October 2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8852899/Robert-Black-guilty-of-fourth-child-murder-the-victims.html|title=Robert Black guilty of fourth child murder: the victims|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]|date=27 October 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she failed to return home by 7:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., her family searched the surrounding streets. A boy told them he had seen Caroline with a man on the nearby [[esplanade|promenade]], which they searched before calling [[Lothian and Borders Police]].{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2366}}

The ensuing search was the largest in Scottish history at that time,{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=44}} with 2,000 local volunteers and 50 members of the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]]{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=68}} searching first Portobello, then expanding their scope to all of Edinburgh. By 10 July, Hogg's disappearance was headline news across the UK. Nine known paedophiles were identified as having been in Portobello on 8 July; all were eliminated from the inquiry.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=77}}

Numerous eyewitnesses had seen an unkempt, balding, "furtive-looking" man wearing horn-rimmed glasses, watching Hogg as she played; then following her to a nearby fairground. En route, a 14-year-old girl named Jennifer Booth had seen Hogg sitting with this man on a bench. Booth overheard Hogg reply "Yes please" to some question posed to her by the man before the two walked to the fairground holding hands.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=40}}
There, the man paid for Caroline to ride a carousel as he watched. A witness stated to police that as they left, Caroline seemed frightened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12672447.Caroline_apos_s_last_15p_fairground_ride_Trial_told_how_police_took_an_hour_to_respond_to__apos_scruffy_man_apos__alert/|title=Caroline's last 15p fairground ride Trial told how police took an hour to respond to 'scruffy man' alert|newspaper=Herald Scotland|date=22 April 1994|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogg remained in Black's van for at least 24 hours. Black delivered posters to Glasgow several hours after the abduction, and refuelled his van in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] early the following morning.

On 18 July, Hogg's naked body was found in a ditch close to the [[M1 motorway]] in [[Twycross]],&lt;ref name="The Telegraph 27 October 2011"/&gt; {{convert|310|mi|km}} from where she had been abducted and just {{convert|24|mi|km}} from where Maxwell's body had been found the previous year.
The precise cause of death could not be determined due to the extent of decomposition. Insect activity suggested the body had been placed where it was found on or after 12 July; Black had made a delivery to [[Bedworth]] on that date. The absence of clothing again suggested a sexual motive.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|pp=45–46}}

The following March, a televised reconstruction of the abduction was broadcast nationally. Appealing for witnesses to come forward, Hogg's father said: "You think it can never happen to you, but it has proven time and time again that it can, and it could again if this man isn't caught in the near future."&lt;ref&gt;''True Crime'' August 1994 p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coordinated task force==
After the discovery of Hogg's body, a conference of senior Staffordshire and Leicestershire detectives unanimously concluded that Hogg's and Maxwell's murderers were the same person, to a large degree because of the distance between the abduction and discovery sites.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=62}} (Cardy's murder was not linked to this series until 2009.&lt;ref name="BBCNews16December2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8415233.stm |title=Robert Black charged with 1981 Jennifer Cardy murder|work=BBC News |date=16 December 2009|accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Due to the distances involved, police suspected that the murderer of Maxwell and Hogg worked as a lorry or van driver, or a sales representative,{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2366}} which required him to travel extensively to locations which included the [[Scottish Borders]]. Both girls had been bound and likely subjected to a sexual assault prior to the murders, and each had been wearing white ankle socks at the time of her abduction, which may have triggered a [[sexual fetishism|fetish]] in the perpetrator's [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]].{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2363}} Due to the geographical and [[circumstantial evidence|circumstantial]] nature of the offences, the killer was most likely an [[opportunism|opportunist]].

Based upon the day of the week when Maxwell and Hogg had been abducted (a Friday), the killer was likely tied to a delivery or production schedule. Following the August 1982 discovery of Maxwell's body, numerous transport firms with links between Scotland and [[the Midlands]] of England were contacted, and drivers were questioned about their whereabouts on the date of her abduction. This line of inquiry was repeated following the discovery of Hogg's body, but in both instances failed to yield results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19870501&amp;id=3Co1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=u6ULAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3315,4144&amp;hl=en|title=Police question man, 37, over three girls' deaths|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=1 May 1987|access-date=6 July 2016|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite frustration at the lack of a breakthrough in their search for the murderer, there was complete cooperation between the detectives from the four police forces involved in the manhunt. Initially, a satellite incident room in Coldstream coordinated the efforts of the forces involved in the hunt for Maxwell's killer, with incident rooms in Leith and Portobello coordinating the search for Hogg's; within hours of Hogg's body being discovered, the [[chief constable]]s of all forces now involved in investigating the murders agreed to appoint a senior investigating officer to coordinate the inquiries.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=70}} Hector Clark, the [[assistant chief constable]] of Northumbria Police, took overall charge of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19830723&amp;id=QsNAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A6YMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3135,4468691&amp;hl=en|title=Double murder hunt police chief pledges no Ripper-type mistakes|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=23 July 1983|access-date=10 July 2016|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark established incident rooms in [[Northumberland]] and Leith police stations, to liaise between the four police forces involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McEwen|first=Alan|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/caroline-hogg-murder-city-scarred-30-years-on-1-2992923|title=Caroline Hogg murder: City scarred 30 years on|newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]|date=8 July 2013|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All information relating to both child murders was initially logged within a [[index card|card filing system]], which contained 500,000 index cards relating to the Maxwell case alone.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=60}} Mindful of the criticisms of the recent investigation into the [[Yorkshire Ripper]], which had become overwhelmed due to the volume of information filed in a card filing system,{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|pp=46–47}} one of Clark's first decisions upon taking overall charge of the murder investigation was to introduce computer technology into the investigation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19830722&amp;id=QcNAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A6YMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5177,4192307&amp;hl=en|title=Police chief picked to head murder hunt task force|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=22 July 1983|access-date=10 July 2016|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; he and other senior officers agreed that the most efficient way to cooperate in an investigation of this scope was to collate their information on the Hogg murder into a computerised database, which all forces involved in the manhunt could access. Information relating to Maxwell's murder was also later entered onto this database.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=47}}

By January 1987, all information relating to the murders initially linked to Black was entered into the newly established [[HOLMES 2|HOLMES]] information technology system, with the £250,000 cost to implement it provided by the [[Home Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19870107&amp;id=VaNAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=k6UMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5606,799754&amp;hl=en|title=Computer to link child killer hunt|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=7 January 1987|access-date=6 July 2016|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information continued to be entered into the database, and police forces nationwide could cross-check all data fed into this system.{{sfnp|Church|1996|pp=83–84}} This database—based at the Child Murder Bureau in [[City of Bradford|Bradford]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19880122&amp;id=XTpAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UlkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4513,4457637&amp;hl=en/|title=Police seek man freed in death probe|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=22 January 1988|access-date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;—expanded to hold information upon over 189,000 people, 220,000 vehicles, and details of interviews held with over 60,000 people. Much of the information came through three confidential [[hotline]]s established in 1984. As a result of the investigation into the killings, several unrelated crimes, including offences relating to child abuse, were solved.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=90}}

[[File:Brunswick Place - Clough Street - geograph.org.uk - 1499664.jpg|thumb|right|Brunswick Place, [[Morley, West Yorkshire|Morley]]. Sarah Harper is believed to have been abducted from one of the alleyways leading to this street on 26 March 1986]]

===Sarah Harper===
At about 7:50&amp;nbsp;p.m. on 26 March 1986, 10-year-old Sarah Jayne Harper disappeared from the Leeds suburb of [[Morley, West Yorkshire|Morley]], having left her home to buy a loaf of bread from a [[convenience store|corner shop]] 100 yards from her home. The owner of the shop confirmed that Harper had bought a loaf of bread and two packets of crisps from her at 7:55&amp;nbsp;p.m., and that a balding man had briefly entered the shop moments later, then left as Harper made her purchases.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=86}}

Sarah Harper was last seen alive by two girls walking into an alley leading towards her Brunswick Place home; when she had not returned by 8:20&amp;nbsp;p.m., her mother, Jackie, and younger sister, Claire, briefly searched the surrounding streets, before Jackie Harper reported her daughter missing to [[West Yorkshire Police]].{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=52}} Immediately, an extensive search was launched to find the child. Over 100 police officers were assigned full-time to the search, which saw house-to-house inquiries across Morley, over 3,000 properties searched, more than 10,000 leaflets distributed, and 1,400 witness statements obtained. A police search of the surrounding land was bolstered by 200 local volunteers, and a reservoir in nearby [[Tingley]] was searched by [[underwater search and recovery|underwater units]].{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=88}}

Extensive inquiries by West Yorkshire Police established that a white [[Ford Transit]] van had been in the area where Harper had been abducted. Two suspicious men had been seen loitering near the route Harper would have taken to the corner shop, and one of them was stocky and balding. Mindful of the possibility Harper had been abducted and murdered, West Yorkshire Police dispatched a [[telex]] to all forces nationwide, requesting that they search all locations where they had previously discovered child murder victims.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=89}}

At a [[news conference|press conference]] on 3 April, Sarah's mother, Jackie, informed journalists that she feared her daughter was dead, and that the worst torment she and her family endured was the uncertainty. She made a direct appeal to her daughter's abductor to reveal the whereabouts of the body.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=91}} On 19 April, a man discovered Sarah's partially dressed, gagged and bound body floating in the [[River Trent]] near [[Nottingham]], {{convert|71|mi|km}} from the site of her abduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19880118&amp;id=DA41AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=o6ULAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3636,3381206&amp;hl=en|title=New lead in child murders inquiry|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=18 January 1988|access-date=6 July 2016|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An autopsy showed she had died between five and eight hours after her she was last seen alive,{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=158}} and that the cause of her death was drowning; injuries she had received to her face, forehead, head and neck had most likely rendered her [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] prior to being thrown into the water.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=142}}&lt;ref name="Ulster Star"/&gt; Harper had also been the victim of a violent and sustained sexual assault prior to being thrown into the river, causing [[pre-mortem]] internal injuries which were described by the pathologist as "simply terrible".{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=54}}

Days after Harper's body had been found, a further witness contacted West Yorkshire Police to say that at approximately 9:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. on 26 March, he had seen a white van with a stocky, balding man standing by the passenger door, parked close to the [[River Soar]]. As the Soar is a [[tributary]] to the Trent, and the description of the vehicle and driver matched those obtained from Morley residents, investigators took this eyewitness account seriously.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=44}} Black refuelled his van in [[Newport Pagnell]] the following afternoon, and it is likely that he had driven Harper to [[Ratcliffe on Soar]], and discarded her body in the Soar in the late evening of the date of her abduction, or the early hours of the following day.{{sfnp|Wilson|2007|p=159}}

Realising the likelihood that Harper's murderer had travelled on the M1 motorway prior to disposing of her body in the river,{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=97}} and that he would have had to refuel his vehicle as he made this journey, officers from both West Yorkshire and [[Nottinghamshire Police]] questioned staff and motorists at all service stations on the M1 motorway between [[Woolley, West Yorkshire]] and [[Trowell]], Nottinghamshire, asking whether they had noted anything unusual on 26 or 27 March. Staff at one station had noted a white Transit van which had seemed out of place on the evening of 26 March, but could not give a clear description of the driver.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=54}}

==Link to series==
Detective John Stainthorpe, head of the Leeds South Division of West Yorkshire Police,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/calendar/update/2016-02-15/detective-who-helped-to-track-down-yorkshire-ripper-dies-aged-83/|title=Detective who helped to track down Yorkshire Ripper dies aged 83|publisher=ITV|date=15 February 2016|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; initially stated his doubt that Harper's disappearance was linked to those of Maxwell and Hogg: in one interview, he said that although he would not discount the possibility, he believed that Harper's abductor had close, personal connections with Morley.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=94}} Upon the discovery of her body in the River Trent, he revised his opinion.

Numerous similarities linked the murder of Sarah Harper to those of Maxwell and Hogg: she had been a [[preadolescence|prepubescent]], [[white people|white]] female, abducted from [[Northern England]] and found murdered in the Midlands. All three victims had been discovered within {{convert|26|mi}} of [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]],&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pithers |first=Malcolm |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/killing-of-girls-every-parents-nightmare-man-denies-abduction-and-murder-of-three-young-girls-in-1369851.html|title=Killing of girls 'every parent's nightmare': Man denies abduction and murder of three young girls in 'Midlands triangle'|date=13 April 1994|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with little effort being made to conceal the bodies.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=67}}

Despite these similarities, several investigators initially doubted whether Harper's murder should be linked to the series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19860422&amp;id=e7VAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uqUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4237,5382456&amp;hl=en|title= US-style profile on child murders|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=22 April 1986|access-date=6 July 2016|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the differences in the circumstances of her abduction and the fact that the child had been subjected to a serious sexual assault prior to her murder, whereas decomposition had erased any such clear traces on the bodies of the two previous victims. Harper had been abducted on a rainy Wednesday evening from a suburb in the north of England, wearing a hooded anorak covering much of her face, as opposed to being abducted on a summer Friday afternoon in southern Scotland while wearing summer clothing.{{sfnp|Church|1996|pp=87–88}} Investigators remained open-minded as to whether Harper's murder had been committed by the same person, and telephone and computer connections were established between the incident room in the Leeds district of [[Holbeck]] and Leith. Harper's murder was formally linked to the series in November 1986.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=88}}

===National manhunt===
Following the murder of Sarah Harper, with six police forces now involved in the hunt for the offender, the police forces involved in the manhunt agreed that Hector Clark (by this time Detective Chief Constable of Lothian and Borders Police) should maintain overall command of the investigation. Clark created a new headquarters in [[City of Wakefield|Wakefield]] to act as a liaison between the six forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12696731.Endless_searching_with_a_single_aim_in_mind/|title=Endless searching with a single aim in mind|access-date=26 July 2016|newspaper=Herald Scotland|date=20 May 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 April 1986, the head of [[Scotland Yard]]'s [[SO11|Criminal Intelligence Branch]], Phillip Corbett, hosted a [[summit (meeting)|summit meeting]] at Scotland Yard, to discuss how best to share information between the forces involved in the manhunt, and to investigate potential links with 19 other unsolved child murders.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2368}} Senior officers attended from 16 UK police forces. At this stage, the inquiry had cost in excess of a million pounds.
{{quote box

| width = 35em
}}
One of the outcomes of this meeting was that investigators contacted the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to request that they compose a [[offender profiling|psychological profile]] of the murderer for UK investigators. The FBI completed this profile in early 1988.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=96}}

For the HOLMES database, investigators concluded only those with convictions for serious sexual offences against children would warrant further investigation. Those to be checked were to have been convicted of child murder, child abduction or attempted child abduction, or the indecent assault of a child. Every police force in the UK was asked to check their databases for people who had received convictions for any of these offences within 10 years of the 1982 murder of Susan Maxwell.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2368}} This narrowed the number of people to be checked to 40,000 men, and Black's name was not on the list, as his sole conviction had been in 1967.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=98}}

In January 1988, the UK investigators received the psychological profile of the killer from the FBI. This profile described the killer as a white male aged between 30 and 40 (likely closer to 40), who was a classic loner. This offender would be unkempt in appearance,&lt;ref name="True Crime August 1994 p. 14"&gt;''True Crime'' August 1994 p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; and had received less than 12 years of formal education. He likely lived alone, in rented accommodation, in a [[lower-middle class]] neighbourhood. This profile also deduced that the motive for the child killings was sexual, that the offender held a fixation with child pornography, that he retained souvenirs from his victims, and he most likely engaged in [[necrophilia]] with his victims' bodies shortly after their death, before disposing of them.&lt;ref name="heraldscotland.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Lucy|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13039112.The_lost_chance_to_stop_killer_Black_30_years_ago/|title=The lost chance to stop killer Black 30 years ago|newspaper=Herald Scotland|date=28 October 2011 |access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teresa Thornhill===
On 23 April 1988, an attempted abduction of a teenage girl occurred in the Nottingham district of [[Radford, Nottingham|Radford]] which was not initially deemed by Nottinghamshire Police to be linked to the three child killings,{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=102}} and thus remained unreported to Clark or senior investigators in the national manhunt, despite the fact that all chief constables across the UK had been requested to report incidents of this nature to the inquiry team. The victim of this attempted abduction was Teresa Thornhill, a 15-year-old who was {{nowrap|4 ft 11 in (150 cm)}} tall, which may have led Black to think she was younger than she was.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=80}}

That evening, Thornhill had been at a social gathering in a local park with her boyfriend, Andrew Beeston, and other teenagers, before walking home with Beeston. The pair had parted company at the end of Norton Street when Thornhill noted a blue Transit van slowing to a stop ahead of her; the driver of this van then got out, raised the van's [[hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] and asked Thornhill, "Can you fix engines?"{{sfnp|Wyre|Tate|1995|pp=116–117}} When Thornhill replied that she could not and began walking at a much brisker pace, Black clasped his arms across her mouth and navel and attempted to drag her into his vehicle.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=79}}

Thornhill resisted him: writhing and kicking as she attempted to free herself from what she later described as his "[[bear hug]]" grasping of her body. As her would-be abductor wrestled her to his van, Thornhill squeezed his testicles, causing him to loosen his grasp sufficiently enough for her to bite into his right forearm. Black shouted, "Oh! You... bitch!", as Thornhill began to scream for her mother, wedging her feet on each side of the door frame as she struggled to resist being forced into the van.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph 27 October 2011"/&gt; At the same time, Beeston ran towards the van shouting, "Let go of her, you fat bastard!" Upon hearing this, Black loosened his grip on Thornhill, who fell into the road, sobbing. Black got into the driver's seat of the van and drove off.{{sfnp|Church|1996|pp=100–101}}

Both Thornhill and Beeston ran to Thornhill's home and informed her parents what had occurred; they immediately reported the attempted abduction to Nottinghamshire Police, who questioned both youngsters. Both Thornhill and Beeston described her would-be abductor as an unkempt,{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=101}} overweight, balding and heavily built man aged between 40 and 50, and about {{nowrap|5 ft 7 in (175 cm)}} in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/attempt-to-kidnap-girl-thwarted-after-fight-woman-tells-murder-trial-of-ordeal-1372687.html|title='Attempt to kidnap girl thwarted after fight': Woman tells murder trial of ordeal|access-date=15 July 2016|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=26 April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capture==
Black was arrested in [[Stow, Scottish Borders|Stow]] on 14 July 1990. David Herkes, a 53-year-old retired postmaster, was mowing his front garden when he saw a blue Transit van slow to a standstill across the road. The driver exited the van—ostensibly to clean his windscreen—as the six-year-old daughter of Herkes' neighbour passed his field of view. As Herkes stooped to clear cuttings from his lawnmower, he saw the girl's feet lifting from the pavement; he then straightened himself to observe the vehicle's driver hastily pushing something through the passenger door before clambering across to the driver's seat, closing the passenger door, and starting the engine.&lt;ref name="southern reporter"&gt;{{cite news|last=Burgess|first=Bob|url=http://www.thesouthernreporter.co.uk/news/local-headlines/gardener-who-helped-capture-evil-black-1-2561536|title=Gardener who helped capture evil Black|newspaper=Southern Reporter|date=6 October 2012|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realising he had witnessed an abduction, Herkes noted the [[vehicle registration plate|registration number]] of the van as it sped away.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2368}} Herkes ran to the girl's home; the girl's mother called police.&lt;ref name="Belfast Telegraph 12 January 2016"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/robert-black-one-wrong-turn-led-to-child-killer-being-caught-redhanded-34358943.html|title=Robert Black: One wrong turn led to child killer being caught red-handed|newspaper=Belfast Telegraph|date=12 January 2016|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within minutes, six police vehicles had arrived in the village.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=107}} As Herkes described the van to officers, he observed it driving in their direction and exclaimed, "That's him! That's the same van!"{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=62}} An officer jumped in the van's path, forcing it to halt. Police removed the driver from his seat and handcuffed him.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2370}}

One of the officers, who was the father of the abducted girl,{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=107}} opened the rear of the van and clambered inside, calling his daughter's name.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=107}} Seeing movement in a sleeping bag,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hudson|first1=Nick|title=Child killer Robert Black was About to be Charged with 1978 Genette Tate Murder|url=https://www.policeprofessional.com/news/child-killer-robert-black-was-%C2%91about-to-be-charged%C2%92-with-1978-genette-tate-murder/|accessdate=23 October 2018|date=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} he untied its drawstring to discover his daughter inside, her wrists bound behind her back, her legs tied together, her mouth bound and gagged with sticking plaster, and a hood tied over her head.&lt;ref&gt;''British Serial Killers'' {{ISBN|978-1-467-88139-5}} pp. 348-349&lt;/ref&gt;

En route to [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]] police station, Black said: "It was a rush of blood to the head; I have always liked little girls since I was a lad. I tied her up because I wanted to keep her until I had dropped a parcel off. I was going to let her go." Black claimed he had interfered with his victim only "a little".{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=63}} A doctor found the victim had been subjected to a serious sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Belfast Telegraph 12 January 2016"/&gt;

The girl was able to pinpoint the lay-by on the [[A7 road (Great Britain)|A7]] where Black had sexually assaulted her. Black's intention had been to quickly make a final scheduled delivery to [[Galashiels]] before further abusing and almost certainly killing his victim.&lt;ref name="Belfast Telegraph 12 January 2016"/&gt;

===Investigation and charges===
At Selkirk police station, Black admitted to sexually assaulting the girl, saying he had not done more to her because he "didn't have much time".{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=162}} Black was charged with [[child abduction|plagium]], and held on [[remand (detention)|remand]]. As Black awaited a scheduled 16 July Selkirk Sheriff court appearance, the detective superintendent—noting the similarities between the Stow abduction and the three child killings—notified Hector Clark of Black's arrest. On 16 July, Clark travelled from Wakefield to interview Black at Edinburgh's St Leonards police station. Although Black's answers in this brief interview were largely monosyllabic, Clark left feeling that Black was the man he had sought since 1982.{{sfnp|Church|1996|pp=109–110}} At Black's initial remand hearing he was ordered to stand trial at [[High Court of Justiciary|Edinburgh High Court]] for the abduction of the Stow girl; he was then transferred to [[HM Prison Edinburgh|Saughton Prison]].{{sfnp|Wyre|Tate|1995|p=108}}

A search of Black's van found restraining devices including assorted ropes, sticking plaster, and hoods; a [[Instant camera|Polaroid camera]]; numerous articles of girls' clothing; a mattress; and a selection of sexual aids.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=111}} Black claimed that on his long-distance deliveries he would pull into a lay-by and dress in the children's clothing before masturbating; he gave no plausible explanation for the sexual aids.{{refn|group=n|None of the girls' clothing found in Black's van had belonged to any of the murder victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-15353002|title=Robert Black trial: Defendant had 'tape and rags'|work=BBC News|date=18 October 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Black's Stamford Hill lodgings were searched at the request of Scottish detectives, yielding a large collection of child pornography in magazine, book, photographic and video format,&lt;ref name="independent19May1994"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pithers|first=Malcolm|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/killer-faces-questions-on-more-sex-murders-police-to-interview-robert-black-about-the-deaths-of-at-1437309.html|title=Killer faces questions on more sex murders: Police to interview Robert Black about the deaths of at least 12 girls in England, Northern Ireland and France|date=19 May 1994|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 58 videos and films depicting graphic child sexual abuse which Black later claimed to have bought in continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13039109.Predator_with_a_grotesque_history_of_abuse/|title=Predator with a grotesque history of abuse|access-date=16 July 2016|newspaper=[[The Herald (Glasgow)]]|date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also found were several items of children's clothing, a semen-stained copy of a Nottingham newspaper detailing the 1988 attempted abduction of Teresa Thornhill, and a variety of sex aids.{{sfnp|Church|1996|pp=110–111}}

Black's appointed defence lawyer, Herbert Kerrigan [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], and the Edinburgh [[procurator fiscal]] both ordered psychiatric evaluations of Black, which were undertaken by prominent psychiatrists. Both reports were uncompromising regarding Black's [[deviance (sociology)|deviancy]] and proclivities towards children.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=112}} Black told Kerrigan he intended to plead guilty to the abduction charges.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=110}}

==Abduction trial==
On 10 August 1990, Black was tried for the abduction and sexual assault of the Stow schoolgirl. He was tried at the Edinburgh High Court before [[Donald Ross, Lord Ross|Lord Donald MacArthur Ross]]. The trial lasted one day.{{sfnp|Church|1996|pp=112–113}}

In his [[opening statement]], Kerrigan stated his client would plead guilty to all charges. The [[Lord Advocate]] of Scotland, [[Peter Fraser, Baron Fraser of Carmyllie|Lord Fraser of Carmyllie]] QC then outlined the facts of the case, terming the implements found in Black's van a clear sign of [[malice aforethought|premeditation]], and citing a medical expert's testimony that the girl would likely have suffocated within 15 minutes had she not been rescued.&lt;ref name="Belfast Telegraph 12 January 2016"/&gt;

Testimony was given that Black drove his victim to a lay-by to sexually abuse her, then returned through the village. In a statement read to the court, the victim stated she "didn't know he [Black] was a bad man" as Black had stared at her before bundling her into his van.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland/274460-robert-black-trial-hears-of-thwarted-kidnap-attempt/|title=Robert Black trial hears of thwarted kidnap attempt|publisher=STV|date=12 October 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In rebuttal, Kerrigan asserted again that the abduction had been unplanned, and that Black had intended to release the girl after assaulting her. He pointed out that Black freely admitted his paedophilic preferences, and claimed to have successfully fought against the urge to abduct young girls prior to the incident at issue. He also said that Black accepted that he was a danger to children and wished to undergo treatment.{{sfnp|Church|2015|p=113}}

Prior to sentencing, Ross paid tribute to Herkes, whose vigilance had led to Black's arrest. Sentencing Black to life imprisonment for what he described as "a horrific, appalling case", Ross said he was greatly influenced by the opinion of the psychiatrists, who had concluded that Black was, and would remain, an extreme danger to children.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=69}}

In September 1990, Black announced his intention to appeal his life sentence, but he later abandoned this. In November 1990, he was transferred to [[HM Prison Peterhead|Peterhead Prison]].

==Further investigation==
Two weeks after the Stow trial, Clark conducted a second, recorded interview with Black. He had appointed Andrew Watt and Roger Orr to conduct the interview, with instructions they were to tell Black that they would not be [[value judgment|judgemental]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/how-many-more-young-lives-1366836|title=How many more young lives did Robert Black take?|first=Sophie|last=Doughty|date=26 June 2012|newspaper=[[Evening Chronicle]]|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the six-hour interview, Black freely discussed his early sexual experiences, his experimentation with various forms of self-abuse, and his attraction towards young children; he also described his penchant for wearing young girls' clothing,{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=117}} and admitted to having sexually assaulted in excess of 30 young girls between the 1960s and 1980s. He was largely uncommunicative in response to questions even loosely pertaining to any unsolved child murders and disappearances, but said he had enticed two young girls into his van in Carlisle upon the pretext of asking for directions in late 1985, then allowed them to leave when eyewitnesses appeared.{{sfnp|Church|1996|pp=81–82}}

The latter stages of this interview saw both men steer their questioning directly to the subject of child abduction and murder, specifically in relation to the murder of Caroline Hogg. Informing Black that police had already established he had been in Portobello on the date of Hogg's abduction, Watt and Orr then tacitly informed him they had eyewitness accounts and petrol-station receipts, further proving that he was near Portobello on the date of Hogg's abduction. Orr then produced a [[facial composite|composite drawing]] of the man with whom Hogg had left the funfair, and placed this composite alongside photographs of Black dating from the early 1980s—highlighting their similarities.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=74}} Black's replies then became evasive and monosyllabic. Asked directly, at the end of the interview, to confess in order to end the suffering of his victims' families, he did not respond.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=118}}

Despite the fact the information gleaned in this interview did little to advance the murder inquiry, upon the conclusion of the interview, Clark informed his two colleagues: "That's our man. I'd bet my life on it."{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2371}}

===Accumulation of evidence===
Detectives from all forces in the UK linked to the joint manhunt then began an intense and painstaking endeavour to gather sufficient evidence to convince the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] to instigate legal proceedings against Black, with a reasonable chance of securing convictions. As was his [[natural and legal rights|legal right]], Black refused to cooperate with the detectives in their investigation.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=22}}

Investigators contacted Poster, Dispatch and Storage Ltd to establish whether travel records could confirm his whereabouts on crucial dates linked to the investigation. Staff at this firm were able to confirm that Black had always bought petrol using credit cards, the receipts of which he would then submit to his firm to claim [[expense]]s. These files, plus several historical delivery schedules, were still in the company's archives. Investigators discovered that Black had made scheduled delivery runs to the areas where the abductions had occurred on the relevant dates, and although the precise times he had been in the area were difficult to adduce, petrol receipts confirmed he had bought fuel close to where each girl had been abducted on the date of her disappearance. For example, on the date of Sarah Harper's disappearance, Black had been scheduled to make a series of deliveries across the Midlands and Northern England. The two final deliveries on this schedule had been in West Yorkshire: in [[Brighouse]], then a final delivery in Morley at a firm 150 yards from Harper's home.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph 27 October 2011"/&gt; Black had refuelled his van between these two destinations shortly before Harper had last been seen alive.

Investigators discovered that upon his return to London from his long-distance deliveries to Northern England or Scotland, Black had regularly slept overnight in a house in [[Donisthorpe]] which belonged to his landlord's son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/monster-who-killed-leeds-schoolgirl-sarah-harper-dies-in-jail-1-7671452|title=Monster who killed Leeds schoolgirl Sarah Harper dies in jail|newspaper=[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]|date=12 January 2016|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was close to where all three bodies had been discovered. Leeds detectives also discovered that, on his regular deliveries to Morley, Black often slept in his van overnight in the premises to which he delivered, which was close to Sarah Harper's home.{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2371}}

Investigators learned that Poster, Dispatch and Storage Ltd had accounts with several oil companies, which allowed their drivers to buy fuel. With the cooperation of the companies, investigators obtained seven million archived [[microform|microfiched]] credit card slips detailing fuel purchases paid via this method at every one of their nationwide premises between 1982 and 1986. These were sent to the reopened incident room in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], where a team of officers searched them for Black's distinctive signature in an effort to pinpoint precisely when and where he had bought his fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/northern-ireland-news/police-refused-to-quit-in-30-year-hunt-for-killer-1-3192143|title=Police refused to quit in 30-year hunt for killer|newspaper=News Letter|date=28 October 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This laborious task bore fruit: beginning in October 1990, investigators began to discover evidence proving the precise times Black had bought fuel at petrol stations close to each abduction site. In each instance, the time of purchase had been shortly before or after each child had been abducted.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=124}}

By December 1990, the inquiry team decided they had sufficient circumstantial evidence to convince [[the Crown]] that there was a reasonable prospect of securing convictions against Black, although Clark was worried that the inquiry had not uncovered any [[forensic identification|forensic evidence]] to tie Black to the murders.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=126}} All the evidence was submitted to the Crown in May 1991.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=81}} In March 1992, Crown lawyers decided that the evidence was sufficient to try Black for the three murders and the attempted abduction of Teresa Thornhill. At a [[news conference]] held on 11 March, Hector Clark informed the press that "criminal proceedings have been issued on the authority of the Crown Prosecution Service against Robert Black".{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=131}}

Several pretrial hearings were held between July 1992 and March 1994; these hearings saw Black's defence counsel submit [[main contention|contention]]s that their client be tried on each count separately, and that the prosecution not be allowed to demonstrate any similarity between the [[modus operandi]] of each offence at the upcoming trial. In the penultimate pretrial hearing, in January 1994, [[William Macpherson (judge)|Judge William Macpherson]] ruled against defence motions to try Black on each charge separately, and also ruled to allow the prosecution to submit [[similar fact evidence]] between the cases. This ruling allowed the prosecution to make these similarities between the cases known, and to introduce into evidence Black's recent conviction for the abduction and sexual assault of the Stow schoolgirl. The prosecution was prohibited from introducing into evidence the transcript of the August 1990 interview between Black and detectives Watt and Orr.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=171}}

==Murder trials==
On 13 April 1994, Robert Black stood trial before Judge William Macpherson at [[Moot Hall, Newcastle upon Tyne|Moot Hall]], Newcastle upon Tyne. Black pleaded [[plea|not guilty]] to each of the 10 charges of kidnap, murder, attempted kidnap, and [[preventing the lawful burial of a body]].&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt;

In his opening statement on behalf of the Crown, prosecutor John Milford QC described the case to be tried as "every parent's nightmare"{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=141}} as he outlined the prosecution's contention that Robert Black had committed the three child murders and the attempted abduction, and the similarities between these offences and the 1990 abduction and sexual assault of the Stow schoolgirl for which Black was already serving a life sentence. Milford then described the circumstances of each abduction and murder for the jury; contending that each victim had remained alive in Black's van for several hours before her murder, and that each had been killed near the location Black had disposed of her body. In the latter stages of this five-hour opening statement, Milford contended that Black had kidnapped each victim for his own sexual gratification,&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; and pointed out Black's extensive record of child sexual abuse and the paraphernalia discovered in his vehicle and at his London address. Milford closed his speech by stating that the petrol receipts and travel records would prove Black had been at all the abduction, attempted abduction and body recovery sites on the dates in question.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=146}}

On the second day of the trial, the prosecution began to introduce witnesses, witness statements, circumstantial evidence, and forensic testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/susan-maxwell-seen-alone-before-disappearance-triple-murder-trial-told-of-surprise-at-sighting-1370277.html/|title=Susan Maxwell 'seen alone before disappearance': Triple murder trial told of surprise at sighting|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=15 April 1994|access-date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This saw witnesses describing the circumstances surrounding the abduction and subsequent discovery of each victim, and investigators describing the evidence uncovered of Black's movements on the dates of each abduction, the attempted abduction of Teresa Thornhill, and the kidnapping and assault of the Stow schoolgirl. Contemporary statements made by the mother of each murder victim at the time of her child's abduction were also read to the court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12674867.The_last_hours_of_Caroline_Hogg_Parents_tell_of_search_for_daughter/|title=The last hours of Caroline Hogg: Parents tell of search for daughter|newspaper=Herald Scotland|date=21 April 1994|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside testimony from the pathologists who had examined the bodies. Upon hearing the details of the kidnaps and murders, relatives of the three murder victims wept openly in court.&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; Black rarely displayed any interest throughout the proceedings, typically remaining expressionless.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=160}}

Several of these initial witnesses were subjected to intense [[cross-examination]] by Black's defence counsel, Ronald Thwaites, upon issues such as memory accuracy and minor discrepancies between times logged in record books at a firm to which Black had made a delivery on the date of Susan Maxwell's disappearance and those of petrol receipts introduced as evidence (this discrepancy was proven to be an [[administrative error]]{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=77}}), and earlier police statements given by the witnesses. Most witnesses maintained their insistence of the accuracy and honesty of their testimony.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=147}}

One of the witnesses cross-examined on the third day of the trial was James Fraser, a forensic scientist, who had examined more than 300 items recovered from Black's van and his London lodgings; Fraser conceded that in over 1,800 microscopic comparisons, no forensic link had been established between Black and the three victims. In direct re-examination by John Milford, Fraser said that the interval between the offences and Black's arrest, and the fact Black had only bought the van in which he was arrested in 1986, would make establishing a forensic link between the three murders unlikely.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=148}}

The final prosecution witnesses to testify were detectives from the police forces involved in the manhunt; they testified on 29 April, and much of their testimony described the scope of the investigation while Black had been at large, and the painstaking inquiries to gather evidence. The final detective to testify was Hector Clark, who testified that Black's name had never been entered into the HOLMES database during the manhunt due to his conviction pre-dating the timescale of those judged to warrant further investigation. Clark further explained he could not recall any other cases where children had been abducted, killed and their bodies transported considerable distances, before stating: "I don't believe there has been a bigger crime investigation in the United Kingdom, ever."{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=163}}

On 4 May, Ronald Thwaites began to outline his case in defence of Black. Thwaites reminded the jury the police had been unsuccessfully investigating these crimes for eight years before Black's 1990 arrest and conviction for the Stow abduction, and asserted that the investigators had seized on this case in an attempt to [[scapegoating|scapegoat]] his client to appease their feelings of "frustration and failure", and in an effort to restore broken reputations. Thwaites claimed that, although the paraphernalia introduced into evidence attested to his client's admitted obsession with paedophilic material,&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond Tolerance: Child Pornography on the Internet'' p.190&lt;/ref&gt; no direct evidence existed to prove Black had progressed from molester to murderer. Describing his decision not to permit Black to testify on his own behalf in relation to the petrol receipts and travel records, Thwaites informed the jury: "No man can be expected to remember the ordinary daily routine of his life going back many years."{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=165}} Thwaites then began to introduce witnesses to testify on behalf of the defence, and continued to do so until 10 May.

To support Thwaites' contention that the three murders were not part of a series and had not been committed by Black, much of the testimony delivered by the defence witnesses referred to sightings of alternative suspects and suspicious vehicles near each abduction. The evidence delivered by these eyewitnesses contradicted that of those who had earlier testified on behalf of the prosecution. For example, Thomas Ball testified that on the date of Susan Maxwell's abduction, he had observed a girl matching her description striking a maroon [[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph]] saloon with a tennis racket. This car had contained at least two men, and the location Ball had seen this incident was very close to the site of Maxwell's abduction.{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|pp=93–94}}

===Closing arguments===
On 12 May, both counsels delivered their [[closing argument]]s to the jury. Prosecutor John Milford argued first; opening his final address to the jury by describing the circumstances of Black's 1990 arrest and recounting the extensive circumstantial evidence presented throughout the trial, and emphasising the fact no physical evidence existed due to the interval between the offences and Black's arrest. In reference to the defence argument that Black's close proximity to each of the abduction and body disposal sites of the dates in question was mere coincidence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/defence-scorned-1435548.html|title=Defence scorned|access-date=15 July 2016|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=12 May 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milford stated that if this defence contention were true, it would be "the coincidence to end all coincidences". Milford then requested that the jury reach a guilty verdict.

Thwaites delivered his closing arguments on behalf of the defence. He began by asking the jury: "Where is the jury that will acquit a pervert of multiple murder?" before describing his client as someone against whom ample prejudice existed, but no [[legal burden of proof|hard evidence]].{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=169}} Thwaites pressed upon the jury the necessity to differentiate between a child sex pervert and an alleged child killer, before attacking the credibility of several prosecution witnesses, and pouring particular scorn upon the nationwide manhunt, stating: "The police have become exhausted in not finding anyone; the public are clamouring for a result. What good are you if you can't catch a child killer? Is he [Black] their salvation, or a convenient, expendable scapegoat?" Thwaites then referred to defence witness testimony which indicated someone else had committed the three murders, before resting his case.

Judge Macpherson delivered his final instructions to the jury on 16 May and the following morning. In his final address, Judge Macpherson implored the jury to discard any emotion or personal distaste for Black's extensive history of sexual offences against children when considering their verdict, and not to prejudge his guilt because of his 1990 conviction for the abduction and sexual assault of the Stow schoolgirl. Judge Macpherson further directed the jury to instead focus on the evidence presented at the trial and decide whether the "interlocking similarities" between the cases presented were sufficient to convince them of Black's guilt,&lt;ref name="Herald Scotland 17 May 1994"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12696240.Black_murder_trial_jury_retires_today_to_consider_verdicts/|title=Black murder trial jury retires today to consider verdicts|newspaper=Herald Scotland|date=17 May 1994|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; before reminding them that any conclusions of guilt on one charge must not determine guilt on the remaining nine charges they were to debate. The jury then received strict instructions against reading newspapers, watching television or making any telephone calls, before retiring to consider their verdict. These deliberations continued for two days.&lt;ref name="Herald Scotland 17 May 1994"/&gt;

===First murder convictions===
On 19 May, the jury found Black guilty of three counts of kidnapping, three counts of murder, three counts of preventing the lawful burial of a body{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|p=2372}} and—in relation to Teresa Thornhill—one count of attempted abduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8853804/I-can-still-see-Robert-Blacks-face-every-day.html|title='I can still see Robert Black's face every day'|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=27 October 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment for each of these counts, with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of 35 years on each of the three murder charges. These life sentences were to be served concurrently. Passing sentence, Judge Macpherson described Black as being the perpetrator of "offences which are unlikely ever to be forgotten and which represent a man at his most vile".&lt;ref name="True Crime"&gt;''True Crime'' August 1994 p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Black [[reduced affect display|remained unmoved]] upon receipt of this sentence, but as he prepared to leave the dock, he turned to the detectives from the various forces present at his sentencing who, since 1982, had been involved in his manhunt and proclaimed, "Tremendous. Well done, boys."{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=175}} This statement caused several of the detectives to weep.&lt;ref name="Chronicle 11 December 2001"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/child-killer-the-truth-1685092|title=Child killer: The truth|date=11 December 2001|newspaper=Evening Chronicle|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black was then taken to [[HM Prison Wakefield|Wakefield prison]], to begin his sentence in the segregation unit, as a [[Prisoner security categories in the United Kingdom#Male adult prisoners|Category A prisoner]].&lt;ref name="chroniclelive"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/northumberland-schoolgirl-killer-robert-black-8472703|title=Northumberland schoolgirl killer Robert Black has taunted officers interviewing him about missing girl|first=Sophie|last=Doughty|date=19 January 2015|newspaper=Evening Chronicle|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately following these convictions, the more than 20 detectives involved in the manhunt who had been present at his sentencing addressed the press assembled outside Moot Hall, with Hector Clark stating: "The tragedy is these three beautiful children who should never have died. Black is the most evil of characters and I hope there is not now or ever another one like him."{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=176}} When asked his personal feelings towards Robert Black, Clark stated: "Black is a man of the most evil kind, but no longer important to me. I care not about him."&lt;ref name="True Crime August 1994 p. 14"/&gt;

==Fourth murder trial==
On 15 December 2009, Black was served with a [[summons#England and Wales|summons]] to attend trial in Northern Ireland for the 1981 murder of Jennifer Cardy. He was charged the following day.&lt;ref name="BBCNews16December2009"/&gt;

Black's trial for the sexual assault and murder of Jennifer Cardy began at [[Armagh Crown Court]] on 22 September 2011.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8783154/Van-driver-accused-of-girls-murder-linked-to-crime-by-old-petrol-receipts.html|title=Van driver accused of girl's murder 'linked to crime by old petrol receipts'|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=22 September 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-15011434|title=Mother of Jennifer Cardy recalls her last movements|work=BBC News|date=22 September 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was tried before Judge Ronald Weatherup, and acknowledged that he may have been in Northern Ireland on the date of Cardy's abduction, but pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Circumstantial evidence attesting to Black's guilt of Cardy's murder had been obtained by Northern Ireland investigators searching through petrol receipts—560,000 in total—stored in his former employer's archives to ascertain Black's whereabouts on the dates surrounding the abduction and murder. Black's trial began with the prosecutor, Toby Hedworth, stating that the discovery of Black's signature upon these receipts was as good as signing his own confession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-15215541|title=Jennifer Cardy accused Robert Black is multiple killer|work=BBC News|date=7 October 2011|access-date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the second day of the trial, prosecutors introduced into evidence petrol receipts proving he had been near Ballinderry on the date of her abduction. Further evidence presented at trial included a salary ledger proving Black had been paid £50, which had only been given to drivers from his firm who made deliveries to Northern Ireland, and an [[order book (trading)|order book]] confirming a delivery of billboard posters had been due near Ballinderry on the date of the abduction. Black was one of only two employees of Poster Dispatch and Storage Ltd willing to travel to Northern Ireland due to [[the Troubles]], and travel records from all other drivers employed at this firm eliminated them from any culpability on the date of Cardy's abduction.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt; The records also showed that, on the night of the abduction, Black had boarded an overnight ferry from Northern Ireland to [[Liverpool]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lisburn.com/archives/info/news-2011/jennnifer-cardy.html#2|title=Dispute over invoice evidence|newspaper=Ulster Star|date=30 September 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; before refuelling his van at [[Coventry]] the following day, en route to London.

In an effort to discredit the prosecution's contention that Black had been making deliveries to Ireland, Black's defence counsel, David Spens, suggested on the fourth day of the trial the Coventry petrol receipt could only indicate Black had been making deliveries to Coventry on the day after Cardy's murder; in rebuttal, Toby Hedworth questioned a colleague of Black's, who confirmed the firm did not make deliveries to Coventry in the early 1980s.

To further support the prosecution's contention that Cardy's murder had been committed by Black, Nathaniel Cary, a forensic pathologist, testified on the 11th day of the trial to the similarities between Cardy's abduction and murder, and that of Sarah Harper. Cary testified that the circumstances of the two girls' deaths were "remarkably similar", and that the injuries inflicted upon both girls' bodies strongly suggested both girls had been alive, albeit likely unconscious, when their bodies had been placed in water.&lt;ref name="Ulster Star"/&gt;

===Further conviction===
Black's second murder trial lasted six weeks, and the jury deliberated for four hours before delivering their verdict. On 27 October, he was found guilty of Cardy's abduction, sexual assault, and murder. Black was given a further life sentence,&lt;ref name=BBCOct2011&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-15445986|title=Child killer Robert Black found guilty of murdering Jennifer Cardy|date=27 October 2011|work=BBC News|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with hearings deferred on the minimum term to be served.

On 8 December, Judge Weatherup imposed a minimum term of 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cardy|first=Jennifer|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8943177/Child-killer-Robert-Black-to-serve-25-years-for-murdering-Jennifer-Cardy.html|title=Child killer Robert Black to serve 25 years for murdering Jennifer Cardy|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=8 December 2011|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weatherup informed Black: "Your crime was particularly serious; you subjected a vulnerable child to unpardonable terror and took away her life." Prior to his final sentencing for this fourth murder, Black's defence lawyer, David Spens, had informed the court that no plea for [[mercy#Law and ethics|mercy]] could be offered for his client; stating the case in question was "one of those rare cases in which there is no [[mitigation (law)|mitigation]], and so I propose to say nothing in that regard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McDonald|first=Henry|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/08/robert-black-sentenced-25-years|title=Child killer Robert Black sentenced to 25 years for murder of Jennifer Cardy|date=8 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Walker|first = Gail|date = 13 January 2016|title= Robert Black destroyed Jennifer Cardy's life but we didn't allow evil paedophile to destroy our family|url= http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/robert-black-destroyed-jennifer-cardys-life-but-we-didnt-allow-evil-paedophile-to-destroy-our-family-34359957.html|newspaper=The Belfast Telegraph|access-date= 5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At his sentencing, Black was informed that he would be at least 89 before he would be considered for release.&lt;ref name=BBCDec2011&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-16086642|title=Cardy family 'do not hate' child killer Robert Black|date=8 December 2011|work=BBC News|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suspected victims==
Police believe that Black had committed more murders than the four for which he was convicted, with senior detectives believing the true number to be at least eight.&lt;ref name="heraldscotland.com"/&gt;{{sfnp|Wyre|Tate|1995|p=12}} In July 1994, a meeting was convened between senior detectives from the six police forces involved in the nationwide manhunt for Black, and representatives from other UK forces with unsolved missing child and child murder cases. The meeting assessed the evidence investigators had assembled to establish whether Black had killed other children.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=190}}

In 2008, the Crown Prosecution Service stated that [[legal burden of proof|insufficient evidence]] existed to charge Black with any further murders.&lt;ref name="independent19May1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2579716/Prime-suspect-in-1978-murder-of-schoolgirl-Genette-Tate-will-not-face-charges.html|title=Prime suspect in 1978 murder of schoolgirl Genette Tate will not face charges|last=Edwards|first=Richard|date=18 August 2008|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black has been linked to 13 further child murders and disappearances across the UK, Ireland, and continental Europe committed between 1969 and 1987.&lt;ref name="chroniclelive"/&gt;{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=107}}{{sfnp|Real-Life Crimes|1993|pp=2372–2373}}

===France===

5 May 1987: Virginie Delmas (10). Abducted from [[Neuilly-sur-Marne]] on 5 May 1987. Her nude body was found in a [[Paris]] orchard on 9 October. Delmas had been strangled; the extent of decomposition prevented the pathologist determining whether she had been raped before death. Black made several deliveries in and around Paris on the date of Delmas's disappearance.

30 May 1987: Hemma Greedharry (10). Discovered in the Paris suburb of [[Malakoff]] two hours after she was last seen alive. She had been raped and strangled.

==Aftermath, imprisonment and death==
The eight-year, nationwide inquiry which culminated in the 1990 arrest of Robert Black was one of the longest, most exhaustive and costly British murder investigations of the 20th century.{{sfnp|Church|1996|p=73}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-15434091|title=Jennifer Cardy: A 30-year wait for justice|work=BBC News|date=27 October 2011|access-date=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time investigators had amassed sufficient evidence to convince the Crown to instigate criminal proceedings against Black for the three child murders and the attempted abduction of Thornhill, the dossier they had assembled was estimated to weigh 22 [[tonne]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/qc-reveals-evidence-convicted-robert-1406622|title=QC reveals evidence that convicted Robert Black|first=Dan|last=Warburton|date=4 November 2011|newspaper=Evening Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total cost of the inquiry is estimated to be £12 million.&lt;ref&gt;''Mapping Murder: The Secrets of Geographical Profiling p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Black appealed against his 1994 convictions. His appeal was heard before [[Peter Taylor, Baron Taylor of Gosforth|Lord Taylor]] at the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales#Criminal Division|Court of Appeal]] on 20 February 1995. Black contended he had been denied a fair trial due to details of his 1990 abduction and sexual assault charges being introduced as similar fact evidence at his trial, a ruling his defence counsel had fundamentally objected to. Black also contended that the final instructions delivered to the jury by Judge Macpherson had been unbalanced.{{sfnp|Church|1996|pp=181–182}} Black's appeal hearing had been expected to last three days, but at the end of the first day, Lord Taylor refused leave to appeal the conviction on the grounds that Black's trial had been fair, and that none of his contentions could be substantiated.

In July 1995, Black was attacked in his cell at Wakefield prison by two fellow inmates, who threw boiling water mixed with sugar over him, bludgeoned him with a table leg, then stabbed him in the back and neck with an improvised knife. Black sustained superficial wounds, burns and bruising in this attack; his attackers were jailed for three further years after admitting wounding Black with intent to cause [[grievous bodily harm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12054487.Two_jailed_for_Black_ambush_Inmates_tried_to__rip_skin_off_apos__murderer|title=Two jailed for Black ambush Inmates tried to 'rip skin off' murderer|newspaper=Herald Scotland|date=3 January 1996|accessdate=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black never admitted [[culpability]] in any of the murders of which he was convicted or suspected, and refused to cooperate with investigators, in spite of having little hope of ever being freed. According to [[Ray Wyre|Dr Ray Wyre]], a pioneer in the treatment of sex offenders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/aug/08/psychology.ukcrime|title=Obituary: Ray Wyre|first=Edward|last=Marriott|date=7 August 2008|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who conducted several interviews with Black between 1990 and 1993, the prime reason for this was an issue of control for Black. Wyre summarised the [[psychology]] behind Black's refusal to cooperate with investigators: &lt;blockquote&gt;He's the sort of person for whom it's all about power and control. Having information about what he's done gives him power. He has no desire to ease his conscience, and he's not going to give up the one thing that gives him power over the pain that his victims' families are suffering.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The closest Black ever came to confessing to any of his crimes was in response to a question put to him shortly before his 1994 murder trial by Wyre. Wyre had asked Black why he never denied any of the charges brought against him. According to Wyre, Black had replied to this question with the words, "Because I couldn't."{{sfnp|Swinney|2015|p=96}}

Black died from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in [[HMP Maghaberry]] on 12 January 2016.&lt;ref name="heart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truecrimelibrary.com/magazinearticle/death-of-a-serial-killer-robert-blacks-timeline-of-terror/|title=Death of A Serial Killer – Robert Black’s Timeline Of Terror|publisher=True Crime Library|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dies"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-35296135|title=Robert Black: Convicted child killer dies in prison|date=12 January 2016|work=BBC News|accessdate=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was [[cremation|cremated]] at Roselawn Crematorium, outside Belfast, on 29 January.

[[Image:Seal Eg.png|200px|thumb|left|Chinese characters for the words 'seal script' in [[regular script]] 
(left) and seal script (right).]]
'''Seal script''' ({{zh|t=篆書|p=zhuànshū}}) is an ancient [[Chinese script styles|style]] of writing [[Chinese characters]] that was common throughout the latter half of the 1st millennium BCE. It evolved organically out of the [[Zhou dynasty]] [[bronze script|script]]. The [[Qin (state)|Qin]] variant of seal script eventually became the standard, and was adopted as the formal script for all of China during the [[Qin dynasty]]. It was still widely used for decorative engraving and [[seal (East Asia)|seal]]s (name chops, or signets) in the [[Han dynasty]]. The literal translation of the Chinese name for seal script, {{lang|zh|篆書}} (''{{transl|zh|zhuànshū}}''), is ''decorative engraving script'', a name coined during the Han dynasty, which reflects the then-reduced role of the script for the writing of ceremonial inscriptions.

== Types ==
The general term '''seal script''' can be used to refer to several types of seal script, including the [[Large Seal Script|Large or Great Seal script]] ({{lang|zh|大篆}} ''{{transl|zh|Dàzhuàn}}''; Japanese ''{{transl|ja|daiten}}''; Korean ''{{transl|ko|daejeon}}''; Vietnamese  ''{{transl|vi|đại triện}}'') and the lesser or [[Xiaozhuan|Small Seal Script]] ({{lang|zh|小篆}} ''{{transl|zh|Xiǎozhuàn}}''; Japanese ''{{transl|ja|shōten}}''; Korean ''{{transl|ko|sojeon}}''; Vietnamese ''{{transl|vi|tiểu triện}}''). Most commonly, without any other clarifying terminology, it refers to the latter of these. The term ''Large Seal script'' itself can also cover a broad variety of scripts, including a variation of Qin writing earlier than the small seal characters, but also the earlier Western Zhou forms, or even oracle bone characters as well.  Since the term is an imprecise one, not clearly referring to any specific historical script and not used with any consensus in meaning, modern scholars tend to avoid it, and when referring to ''seal script'', generally mean the (small) seal script of the Qin system, that is, the lineage which evolved in the state of Qin during the Spring and Autumn&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Warring States period]] and which was standardized under the First Emperor.

== Evolution==
There were several different variants of seal script which developed independently in each kingdom during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. One of these, the [[Bird-worm seal script|"bird-worm" seal script]] ({{lang|zh|鳥蟲文}}), is named for its intricate decorations on the defining strokes, and was used in the Kingdoms of [[State of Wu|Wu]], [[State of Chu|Chu]], and [[State of Yue|Yue]]. It was found on several artifacts including the [[Spear of Fuchai]] and the [[Sword of Goujian]]. This seal script variant is very difficult to read.

As a southern state, Chu was close to the Wu-Yue influences. Chu produced broad bronze swords that were similar to Wuyue swords, but not as intricate. Chu also used the bird-worm style, which was borrowed by the Wu and Yue states.

== Unified small seal script==
{{main|Small Seal Script}}
[[File:XiaozhuanQinquan.jpg|320px|thumb|left|Small seal script [[epigraphy|epigraph]] on the standard weight prototype of [[Qin dynasty]]. Made from [[iron]], this prototype was unearthed in 1973 at [[Wendeng]], [[Shandong]] Province.]]
The script of the Qin system (the writing as exemplified in bronze inscriptions in the state of Qin before unification) had evolved organically from the Zhou script starting in the Spring and Autumn period.&lt;ref name="Chén Zhāoróng 2003"&gt;Chén Zhāoróng (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning around the Warring States period, it became vertically elongated with a regular appearance. This was the period of maturation of Small Seal script. It was systematized by prime minister [[Li Si]] during the reign of the First Emperor of China [[Qin Shi Huang]] through elimination of most variant structures, and was imposed as the nationwide standard.&lt;ref name="Chén Zhāoróng 2003"/&gt; Through Chinese commentaries, it is known that Li Si compiled the ''[[Cangjiepian]]'', a partially-extant wordbook listing some 3,300 [[Chinese characters]] in small seal script. Their form is characterized by being less rectangular and more squarish.

[[File:BronzePlaque-EdictOfSecondEmperor-Qin-ROM-May8-08.png|thumb|right|125px|Edict of the second Qin emperor, in seal script]]In the popular history of Chinese characters, the Small Seal script is traditionally considered to be the ancestor of the [[clerical script]], which in turn gave rise to all of the other scripts in use today. However, recent archaeological discoveries and scholarship have led some scholars to conclude that the direct ancestor of clerical script was proto-clerical script, which in turn evolved out of the little-known ''vulgar'' or ''popular'' writing of the late Warring States to Qin period.&lt;ref&gt;[[Qiu Xigui]] ''Chinese Writing'' (2000). Translation of {{lang|zh|文字學概要}} by Gilbert L. Mattos and [[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]]. Early China Special Monograph Series No. 4. Berkeley: The Society for the Study of  Early China and the Institute of East Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley. {{ISBN|1-55729-071-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known character [[dictionary]] was the 3rd century BC ''[[Erya]]'', collated and bibliographed by [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] and his son [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]]. It is no longer extant. Not long after, the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' (AD 100&amp;ndash;121), the lifework of [[Xu Shen]], was written. Its 9,353 entries reproduce the standardized small-seal script variant for each entry, and for some entries other pre-Han variants from the late Zhou era. Entries are categorized under 540 [[Radical (Chinese character)|section headers]].

==Computer encoding==
It has been anticipated that the small seal script will some day be encoded in [[Unicode]]. Codepoints U+31400 to U+33D1F (Plane 3, Tertiary Ideographic Plane) have been tentatively allocated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/tip/ The Unicode Consortium, Roadmap to the TIP]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Sectoral balance - private sector components v1.png|thumb|right|350px|Private sector balance showing household and business components separately from 1990-2017. Ideally, households are net savers (surplus balance) while businesses are net borrowers/investors (deficit balance). However, since the early 2000s, businesses have shifted to surpluses in most years. Since the foreign sector has remained in surplus, the U.S. has offset this with higher budget deficits. The sum of the two components equaled 1.2% GDP in 2017, which matches the private balance in the graph showing the three sectors.&lt;ref name="NPI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?graph_id=481267 FRED-Sectoral Balances Household and Business (Private Sector Detail)-Retrieved June 29, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The government fiscal balance is one of three major financial sectoral balances in the national economy, the others being the foreign financial sector and the private financial sector. The sum of the surpluses or deficits across these three sectors must be zero by [[Identity (mathematics)|definition]]. A surplus balance represents a net savings or net financial asset building position, while a deficit balance represents a net borrowing or net financial asset reducing position. Each sector may be defined as follows, using the U.S. as an example:
*Private sector: A surplus balance means U.S. households and businesses together are net savers, building their financial asset position. In other words, savings by households exceed the amount borrowed and invested by businesses. The private sector had a roughly 1.2% GDP surplus in 2017. A deficit would mean households and businesses together are net borrowers, reducing their financial asset position. 
*Foreign sector or "rest of the world": A surplus balance means those outside the U.S. are net savers. This is consistent with a U.S. trade deficit, in which U.S. residents borrow savings from foreign residents to finance import purchases. Foreigners are building their net financial asset position by lending to the U.S. so it can purchase their imports. The U.S. had a trade deficit of roughly 2.3% GDP in 2017. A foreign sector deficit balance would mean foreign residents are net spenders and are borrowing from the U.S. private sector, which would be consistent with a U.S. trade surplus; this was not the 2017 situation.
*Government balance (all levels, e.g., federal, state and local in the U.S.): A surplus balance represents a government collecting more tax revenue than it pays in outlays, building its net financial asset position. This would mean the government is a net saver, removing funds from the private sector. A deficit balance means government outlays are greater than tax revenue and it is reducing its net financial asset position (i.e., increasing its debt position), providing funds to the private sector. Another interpretation is that a government surplus reduces private sector financial assets, while a government deficit increases private sector financial assets. The U.S. government at all levels ran a 3.5% GDP deficit in 2017.&lt;ref name="NPI"/&gt;

To summarize, in the U.S. in 2017, there was a private sector surplus of 1.2% GDP due to household savings exceeding business investment. There was also a trade deficit of 2.3% GDP, meaning the foreign sector was in surplus. By definition, there must therefore exist a government budget deficit of 3.5% GDP so all three net to zero. This is a relatively balanced position, but such is not always the case. For example, the U.S. government budget deficit in 2011 was approximately 10% GDP (8.6% GDP of which was federal), offsetting a foreign sector surplus of 4% GDP and a private sector surplus of 6% GDP.&lt;ref name="blogs.ft.com"&gt;[http://blogs.ft.com/martin-wolf-exchange/2012/07/19/the-balance-sheet-recession-in-the-us/ Financial Times-Martin Wolf-The Balance Sheet Recession in the U.S.- July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Expressed as a formula, the sectoral balance identity is: (Savings - Investment) + (Imports - Exports) + (Tax Revenues - Outlays) = 0; or (S-I) + (M-X) + (T-G) =0, as described below.

==Recent interpretations==
[[File:Sectoral Balances Using CBO Data 1992-2017.png|thumb|right|400px|Sectoral balances using CBO data.  Their method defines the balances as: A) Federal budget balance; B) Current Account (multiplied by -1 in the diagram); and C) Nonfederal Domestic Balance, representing mainly private sector net savings and the state and local government sector balance. The equation A+B+C=0 must hold by definition.&lt;ref name="CBO_Aug2018"/&gt;]]
The U.S. [[Congressional Budget Office]] discussed sectoral balances in its August 2018 economic outlook: "For example, the unique pattern of the balances in the early years of this century reflected increased borrowing by households and businesses that later proved to be unsustainable. Starting with the recession of 2001 and continuing through the expansion of the early- to mid-2000s, both the federal government and the U.S. domestic private sector were net borrowers. That borrowing was funded by foreign investors, and current-account
deficits climbed throughout the period, reaching an all-time high of 6.0% of gross domestic product (GDP) in fiscal year 2006. Following the onset of the 2007–2009 recession, the private sector drastically cut its borrowing while the federal government’s borrowing dramatically increased." CBO also provided supplemental data used to calculate the three sectoral balances, which it defines as the federal budget balance, current account balance, and nonfederal domestic balance.&lt;ref name="CBO_Aug2018"&gt;[https://www.cbo.gov/publication/54318 CBO-An Update to the Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028-Retrieved November 12, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Wynne Godley]] explained in 2004-2005 how U.S. sector imbalances posed a significant risk to the U.S. and global economy. The combination of a high and growing foreign sector surplus and high government sector deficit meant that the private sector was moving towards a net borrowing position (from surplus to deficit) as a housing bubble developed, which he warned was an unsustainable combination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/imbalances-looking-for-a-policy Levy Economics Institute-Wynne Godley-Imbalances Looking for a Policy-April 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/some-unpleasant-american-arithmetic Levy Economics Institute-Wynne Godley-Some Unpleasant American Arithmetic-June 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Economist [[Martin Wolf]] cites as an example the U.S., where sudden shifts in the private sector from deficit to surplus due to the [[Great Recession]] forced the government balance into deficit.&lt;ref name="blogs.ft.com" /&gt; "The financial balance of the private sector shifted towards surplus by the almost unbelievable cumulative total of 11.2 per cent of gross domestic product between the third quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2009, which was when the financial deficit of US government (federal and state) reached its peak...No fiscal policy changes explain the collapse into massive fiscal deficit between 2007 and 2009, because there was none of any importance. The collapse is explained by the massive shift of the private sector from financial deficit into surplus or, in other words, from boom to bust."&lt;ref name="blogs.ft.com"/&gt;

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] also explained in December 2011 the causes of the sizable shift from private deficit to surplus: "This huge move into surplus reflects the end of the housing bubble, a sharp rise in household saving, and a slump in business investment due to lack of customers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/28/the-problem-2/ NYT-Paul Krugman-The Problem-December 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists at the [[New Policy Institute]] explained in 2011 that: "In a healthy economy, businesses invest using money borrowed from households who are saving for future consumption. In the ideal world, this business sector deficit and household sector surplus are accompanied by net exports (a deficit for the rest of the world) and a small government deficit (to fund its own investment)."&lt;ref name="NPI"/&gt;

== Sectoral balances description ==
GDP ([[Gross Domestic Product]]) is the value of all goods and services sold within a country during one year. GDP measures flows rather than stocks (example: the [[public deficit]] is a flow, the [[government debt]] is a stock). Flows are derived from the National Accounting relationship between aggregate spending and income. Ergo:

(1) Y = C + I + G + (X – M)

where Y is GDP (expenditure), C is consumption spending, I is private investment spending, G is government spending, X is exports and M is imports (so X – M = net exports).

Another perspective on the national income accounting is to note that households can use total income (Y) for the following uses:

(2) Y = C + S + T

where S is total saving and T is total taxation (the other variables are as previously defined).

You then bring the two perspectives together (because they are both just “views” of Y) to write:

(3) C + S + T = Y = C + I + G + (X – M)

You can then drop the C (common on both sides) and you get:

(4) S + T = I + G + (X – M) 

Then you can convert this into the following sectoral balances accounting relations, which allow us to understand the influence of fiscal policy over private sector indebtedness. Hence, equation (4) can be rearranged to get the accounting identity for the three sectoral balances – private domestic, government budget and external:

*'''(S – I) = (G – T) + (X – M)''' or
*'''(S - I) + (M - X) + (T - G) = 0'''

The sectoral balances equation says that total private savings (S) minus private investment (I) has to equal the public deficit (spending, G minus taxes, T) plus net exports (exports (X) minus imports (M)), where net exports represent the net savings of non-residents.

Another way of saying this is that total private savings (S) is equal to private investment (I) plus the public deficit (spending, G minus taxes, T) plus net exports (exports (X) minus imports (M)), where net exports represent the net savings of non-residents.

All these relationships (equations) hold as a matter of accounting and not matters of opinion.

Thus, when an external deficit (X – M &amp;lt; 0) and public surplus (G - T &amp;lt; 0) coincide, there must be a private deficit. While private spending can persist for a time under these conditions using the net savings of the external sector, the private sector becomes increasingly indebted in the process.

==Usage==
In [[macroeconomics]], the [[Modern Money Theory]] uses sectoral balances to define any transactions between the government sector and the non-government sector as a [[Modern Monetary Theory#Vertical transactions|vertical transaction]].

The government sector is considered to include the treasury and the [[central bank]], whereas the non-government sector includes private individuals and firms (including the private banking system) and the external sector – that is, foreign buyers and sellers.&lt;ref name="def1011"&gt;[http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=332 "Deficit Spending 101 - Part 1 : Vertical Transactions"] Bill Mitchell, 21 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In any given time period, the government’s budget can be either in deficit or in surplus. A deficit occurs when the government spends more than it taxes; and a surplus occurs when a government taxes more than it spends. Sectoral balances analysis states that as a matter of accounting, it follows that [[government budget deficit]]s add net financial assets to the private sector. This is because a budget deficit means that a government has deposited more money into private bank accounts than it has removed in taxes. A budget surplus means the opposite: in total, the government has removed more money from private bank accounts via taxes than it has put back in via spending.

Therefore, budget deficits, by definition, are equivalent to adding net financial assets to the private sector; whereas budget surpluses remove financial assets from the private sector.

This is represented by the identity:

'''(G – T) = (S – I) – NX'''

which is

'''(State sector balance) = (Private sector balance) – External sector balance'''

where G is government spending, T is taxes, S is savings, I is investment and NX is net exports.

The conclusion drawn from this is that private net saving is only possible when running a trade deficit if the government runs budget deficits; alternately, the private sector is forced to dis-save when the government runs a budget surplus and the trade deficit exists.

According to the sectoral balances framework, budget surpluses remove net savings; in a time of high effective demand, this may lead to a private sector reliance on credit to finance consumption patterns. Hence, continual budget deficits are necessary for a growing economy that wants to avoid deflation. Therefore, budget surpluses are required only when the economy has excessive [[aggregate demand]], and is in danger of inflation.

==Austerity in the view of the sectoral balances approach==
According to the sectoral balances approach, [[austerity]] can be counterproductive in a downturn due to a significant private-sector financial surplus, in which consumer savings is greater than business investment. In a healthy economy, the amount borrowed or invested by companies is greater than or equal to the private-sector savings placed into the banking system by consumers. However, if consumers have increased their savings but companies are not investing, a surplus develops in the banking system. Business investment is one of the major components of [[GDP]].

Economist [[Richard Koo]] described similar effects for several of the developed world economies in December 2011: "Today private sectors in the U.S., the U.K., Spain, and Ireland (but not Greece) are undergoing massive [[deleveraging]] [paying down debt rather than spending] in spite of record low interest rates. This means these countries are all in serious [[balance sheet recession|balance sheet recessions]]. The private sectors in Japan and Germany are not borrowing, either. With borrowers disappearing and banks reluctant to lend, it is no wonder that, after nearly three years of record low interest rates and massive liquidity injections, industrial economies are still doing so poorly. Flow of funds data for the U.S. show a massive shift away from borrowing to savings by the private sector since the housing bubble burst in 2007. The shift for the private sector as a whole represents over 9 percent of U.S. GDP at a time of zero interest rates. Moreover, this increase in private sector savings exceeds the increase in government borrowings (5.8 percent of GDP), which suggests that the government is not doing enough to offset private sector deleveraging."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue58/Koo58.pdf Richard Koo-The world in balance sheet recession-Real World Economics Review-December 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20526">An organism is said to be [[sexually dimorphic]] when male and female conspecifics have anatomical differences in features such as body size, coloration, or ornamentation, but disregarding differences of reproductive organs. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is usually a product of [[sexual selection]], with female choice leading to elaborate male ornamentation (e.g., tails of male peacocks) and male-male competition leading to the development of competitive weaponry (e.g., antlers on male moose). However, evolutionary selection also acts on the sensory systems that receivers use to perceive external stimuli. If the benefits of perception to one sex or the other are different, '''sex differences in sensory systems''' can arise. For example, female production of signals used to attract mates can put selective pressure on males to improve their ability to detect those signals. As a result, only males of this species will evolve specialized mechanisms to aid in detection of the female signal. This article uses examples of sex differences in the olfactory,&lt;ref name="Sanes 1976"/&gt; visual,&lt;ref name="Zeil 1983"/&gt; and auditory systems &lt;ref name= "Narins 1976"&gt;Narins, P. and R. Capranica. 1976. Sexual differences in the auditory system of the tree frog ''[[Eleutherodactylus coqui]]''. Science, 192:378-380.&lt;/ref&gt; of various organisms to show how sex differences in sensory systems arise when it benefits one sex and not the other to have enhanced perception of certain external stimuli. In each case, the form of the sex difference reflects the function it serves in terms of enhanced reproductive success.

==Sphinx moth olfactory system==
Male sphinx moths, ''[[Manduca sexta]]'', rely on female released sex-[[pheromones]] to guide typical zig-zagging flight behaviors used to locate mates.&lt;ref&gt;Schneiderman, A.M., Hildebrand, J.G., Brennan, M.M., Tumlinson, J.H. 1986. Transsexually grafted antennae alter pheromone-directed behavior in a moth. Nature, 323:801-803.&lt;/ref&gt; Although both males and females respond to host plant olfactory cues to locate food sources, detection of and response to sex-pheromones appears to be male specific. Males that are better at detecting female sex-pheromones are able to find signaling females faster, providing them with a reproductive advantage. Since females gain no such advantage for having olfactory systems that are more sensitive to pheromones, enhanced pheromone detection has evolved only in the olfactory system of male ''M. sexta''. The three main sex differences are as follows:

1)  Male antennae are enlarged and contain elongated [[sensilla]] (sensory organules) not present in females.&lt;ref name ="Sanes 1976"/&gt; The [[pheromone]] elicits a male response by stimulating male specific receptor cells on a large number of these [[sensilla]], which are located on the antennal flagellum.&lt;ref name="Sanes 1976"&gt;Sanes, J.R., and Hildebrand J.G. 1976. Structure and development of antennae in a moth, ''Manduca sexta''. Devel. Biol., 51:282-299.&lt;/ref&gt; The sexually dimorphic [[sensilla]] are called male specific type-1 trichoid sensilla, a type of hair-like olfactory [[sensilla]].&lt;ref name="Sanes 1976"/&gt; In contrast, the flagella of female antennae lack these trichoid [[sensilla]] projections that make the male [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] appear to be larger and more feather-like. Each trichoid [[sensilla]] is innervated by two male specific olfactory receptor cells, with each cell being tuned (most sensitive) to one of two major chemical components of the [[pheromone]].&lt;ref name="Kaissling 1989"&gt;&lt;Kaissling, K-E, Hildebrand, J.G., and Tumlinson, J.H. 1989. Pheromone receptor cells in the male moth ''Manduca sexta''. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 10:273-279.&lt;/ref&gt; By evolving larger, pheromone-specific receptors in the peripheral olfactory system, male ''[[Manduca sexta|M. sexta]]'' have an improved sensitivity to female pheromones that enhances mate detection.

2) There is also a sex difference in the neural basis of pheromone detection. In a number of insect species, first order olfactory processing centers in the [[neuropil]] of the [[antennal lobe]] contain a structure called the macroglomerulus in males.&lt;ref&gt;Boeckh, J. and Boeckh, V. 1979. Threshold and odor specificity of pheromone-sensitive neurons in the deutocerebrum of ''Anteraea pernyi'' and '' A. polyphemus'' (Saturnidae). J. Comp. Physiol., 132:235-242.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Matsumoto 1981"&gt;&lt; Matsumoto, S.G., and Hildebrand, J.G. 1981. Olfactory mechanisms in the moth ''Manduca sexta'':Response characteristics and morphology of central neurons in the antennal lobes. Proc. Soc. Lond. B, 213:249-277.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a structure, called the macroglomerular complex in this species, has been identified in the antennal lobe of ''M. sexta'', and it has been discovered that axons from the male specific olfactory receptor cells found in trichoid sensilla project exclusively to the macroglomerular complex.&lt;ref name="Kanzaki 1989"&gt;&lt; Kanzaki, R., Arbas, E.A., Strausfeld, N.J., and Hildebrand, J.G. 1989. Physiology and morphology of projection neurons in the antennal lobe of the male moth ''Manduca sexta''. J. Comp. Physiol. 165:427-454.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, T.A., Hildebrand, J.G. 1987. Male-specific, sex pheromone-selective projection neurons in the antennal lobes of the moth ''Manduca sexta''. J. Comp. Physiol. A., 160:552:569.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, all the antennal lobe neurons which respond to sex pheromone also have arborizations to the macroglomerular complex, providing more evidence that it plays a key role in the processing of pheromone sensory information in males.&lt;ref name="Kanzaki 1989"/&gt;

3) Lastly, there is evidence that the male antennal lobe contains male-specific macroglomerular complex projection neurons that relay pheromone information to higher brain structures in the protocerebrum.&lt;ref name="Homberg 1988"/&gt; Since males have significantly larger populations of medial group antennal lobe neurons, it is thought that some of these extra neurons may belong to this male-specific class.&lt;ref name= "Homberg 1988"&gt;Homberg, U., Montague, R.A., Hildebrand, J.G. 1988. Anatomy of antenno-cerebral pathways in the brain of the sphinx month ''Manduca sexta''. Cell Tissue Res., 254:225-281.&lt;/ref&gt; Kanzaki et al. have since characterized the responses and structures of some of these projection neurons, and have found that projection neurons with [[Dendrite|dendritic]] arborizations in the macroglomerular complex and ordinary [[glomeruli]] were excited or inhibited by different stimuli (pheromonal vs. non-pheromonal stimuli respectively).&lt;ref name="Kanzaki 1989"/&gt; These selective response properties indicate that a specialized role in relaying pheromone information is likely.

The male-specific features listed above, found at the levels of primary detection and neural processing in ''M. sexta'', demonstrate how males of this species have evolved sex differences in the sensory system that improve their ability to detect and locate females.

==Visual system of flies==
Sex differences in the visual system of flies are extremely common, with males generally possessing specialized eye features.&lt;ref name="Zeil 1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirschfeld 1976"&gt;Kirschfeld, K., Wenk, P. 1976. The dorsal compound eye of simuliid flies: An eye specialized for the detection of small, rapidly moving objects. Z. Naturforsch, 31c:764-765.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Land 1975"/&gt;  Flies in the family [[Bibionidae]] display a particularly notable dimorphism, with males possessing large dorsal eyes that are absent in females.&lt;ref name="Zeil 1983"/&gt;[[File:BibionidaeEyes.png|thumb|alt=Male and female flies in the family Bibionidae have sexually dimorphic eye structures, most notably the enlarged dorsal eye seen in males and absent in females|The sexual dimorphism in Bibionidae eyes is prominent, with the large dorsal eyes of the male (left) entirely absent in the female (right)]]  Female eyes and the ventral eyes of males are very similar, however,  suggesting that the male dorsal eyes serve some extra sex specific function. Research on visually guided behavior in flies suggests that male dorsal eyes may be specialized for the detection and capture of females, for which there is a great deal of competition among males.&lt;ref name="Zeil 1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Land 1975"&gt;Land, F.M., Collett, T.S. 1975. Visual control of flight behavior in the hoverfly, ''Syritta pipiens''. J. Comp. Physiol., 99:1-66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Land 1974"&gt;Land, F.M., Collett, T.S. 1974. Chasing behavior in house flies (''Fannia canicularis''). J. Comp. Physiol., 89:331-357.&lt;/ref&gt; Work by Jochen Zeil during the 1970s and 80's demonstrated that the dorsal eyes of [[Bibionidae|Bibionids]] are functionally adapted to mate detection during high speed female chases for three main reasons.

1) Firstly, male dorsal eyes contain significantly longer [[rhabdom]]eres (basic light sensing organelles in the [[ommatidium|ommatidia]] of eyes – 2 to 3 times longer in males) than those found in the female eyes or ventral eyes of males.&lt;ref name="Zeil 1983"/&gt;

2) Second, the enlarged retina prominent in male dorsal eyes is characterized by larger facet diameters than those found in male ventral and female eyes, meaning that there is an increase in the [[aperture]] area of each facet.&lt;ref name="Zeil 1983"/&gt;

3) Thirdly, Zeil was able to measure interommatidial angles by illuminating fly heads so that light traveled antidromically up the [[rhabdom]]eres. This technique revealed that male [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] eyes have smaller interommatidial angles and different [[rhabdom]]ere arrangements than ventral or female eyes.&lt;ref name="Zeil 1983"/&gt;

At a functional level, increased [[aperture]] area and longer [[rhabdom]]ere length both serve to increase [[photon]] capture efficiency in the male [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] eye.&lt;ref name="Zeil 1983"&gt;Zeil, Jochen. 1983. Sexual dimorphism in the visual system of flies: The compound eyes and neural superposition in Bibionidae (Diptera). Journal of Comparative Physiology. 150:379-393.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the smaller ommatidial angles and different rhabdomere arrangement observed in dorsal eyes are central to the function of the dorsal eye because they are neural superposition eyes, meaning that neural pooling of information from neighboring ommatidia is used to enhance sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Zeil, J. 1979. A new kind of neural superposition eye: the compound eye of male Bibionidae. Nature, 278: 249-250.&lt;/ref&gt;  Using a model that takes longer rhabdomeres, larger facet diameters, smaller ommatidial angles, and neural superposition into account, Zeil shows that the dorsal eye of males is able to detect small objects against a homogeneous background at a much greater distance than ventral or female eyes.&lt;ref name="Zeil 1983"/&gt; The optical properties of longer [[rhabdom]]eres, increased [[facet]] diameter, and smaller [[ommatidial]] angles also aid in detection of small objects by increasing the resolution  up to six times that of ventral or female eyes when neural pooling resulting from superposition is taken into account.&lt;ref name="Zeil 1983"/&gt; Greater sensitivity to small light changes due to longer rhabdomeres and increased facet diameter, in combination with the ability to detect females at farther distances with higher resolution, allows male [[Bibionidae|Bibionid]] flies to search for females at lower light levels (greater portion of the day) and to respond quickly to the presence of a female in order to catch her and initiate the "marriage by capture" that occurs in this family of flies.&lt;ref name="Zeil 1983"/&gt; Unlike other fly families,&lt;ref name="Kirschfeld 1976"/&gt; the extreme dimorphism seen in [[Bibionidae|Bibionids]] may be particularly relevant because these species do not swarm under a landmark, causing the course of females to be relatively unpredictable.&lt;ref name="Zeil 1983"/&gt; As in the olfactory example above, the functional consequences of sex differences in Bibionids are linked to sex-specific behavior for which these sex differences play a key adaptive role.

==Auditory system of frogs==
	It is well known that the auditory systems of [[anurans]] are well adapted to detect species specific vocalizations, and that the behavioral response to these vocalizations often differs between the sexes. Sex differences in auditory systems have been found to underlie these gender specific behaviors in multiple species.&lt;ref name= "Narins 1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason 2003"&gt;Mason, M.J., Lin, C.C., and P.M. Narins. 2003. Sex differences in the middle ear of the bullfrog (''Rana catesbeiana''). Brain, Behavior and Evolution, 61:91-101.&lt;/ref&gt; In one particularly well-studied example, Peter Narins and his colleagues have examined sex differences in the auditory system of the Puerto Rican rain frog, ''[[Eleutherodactylus coqui]]'', in which males give a two-note, species specific [http://www.hear.org/species/eleutherodactylus_coqui/ call]. In ''E. coqui'', the call is not only species specific, but also divided into sex specific components. The two-note call, from which the “coqui” frog derives its name, consists of a 100&amp;nbsp;ms “Co” note at around 1.2&amp;nbsp;kHz, followed by a much longer duration “Qui” note at around 2&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="Narins 1976"/&gt; Males of this species use this call in both territory defense and mate attraction, with the “Qui” note often being dropped out in aggressive interactions between males.&lt;ref name="Narins 1976"/&gt; Using playback experiments, Narins et al. found that males and females respond to different aspects of the call, with males showing a strong vocal response to  calls containing “Co” notes, and females being preferentially attracted to calls containing “Qui” notes.&lt;ref name="Narins 1976"/&gt;  Since the peripheral auditory system of anurans has been implicated in the detection of temporal and spectral features of male calls,&lt;ref&gt;R.R., Capranica, and J.M. Moffat. 1975. Selectivity of the peripheral auditory system of spadefoot toads (''Scaphiopus couchi'') for sounds of biological significance. J. Comp. Physiol., 100:231-249.&lt;/ref&gt; follow up experiments were performed on the two auditory organs of the [[inner ear]], the amphibian papilla and basilar papilla.&lt;ref&gt;Geisler, C.D., Vanbergeijk, W.A., and L.S. Frishkopf. 1964. The inner ear of the bullfrog. J. Morphol. 114:43-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Three major differences discovered in the auditory system help explain why, at a mechanistic level, male and female ''E. coqui'' are sensitive to different notes of the male call.

1)  Electrophysiological recordings from the eighth [[cranial nerve]] of males and females reveal that primary auditory neurons of the two sexes are maximally excited by different frequencies. Of the three main classes of primary auditory units (low, mid, and high frequency), the high frequency units in females are tuned (maximally sensitive) to sounds of approximately 2&amp;nbsp;kHz (the frequency of the “Qui” note), whereas the same units in males appear to be tuned to &gt;3&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="Narins 1976"/&gt; The mid frequency units, on the other hand, are tuned to around 1.2&amp;nbsp;kHz (frequency of the "Co" note) in males, and to significantly lower frequencies in females.&lt;ref name="Narins 1976"/&gt; Increased sensitivity in females to the "Qui" note and in males to the "Co" note explains the difference in behavioral responsiveness of each sex to the note of the call that is biologically relevant. The low and mid frequency units are thought to derive from the amphibian papilla, whereas the high frequency units correspond to the basilar papilla.&lt;ref&gt;Feng, A.S., Narins, P.M., and Capranica, R.R. 1975. Three populations of primary auditory fibers in the bullfrog (''Rana catesbiana''): their peripheral origins and frequency sensitivities. J. Comp. Physiol., 100:221-229.&lt;/ref&gt; Although no difference was found for low frequency units, the sex differences in mid and high frequency unit response suggest that there may be a neural basis for male "Co" note selectivity in the amphibian papilla, and for female “Qui” note selectivity in the basilar papilla.

2) By measuring Q10 values, it has also been found that the [[nerve]] fibers innervating the basilar papilla of males are more sharply tuned than those in females.&lt;ref name="Narins 1980"&gt;Narins, P. and R. Capranica. 1980. Neural adaptations for processing the two-note call of the Puerto Rican treefrog, ''Eleutherodactylus coqui''. Brain, Behavior, and Evolution, 17:48-66.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the "Qui" note is a wide-band signal that sweeps upward in frequency, it appears as though the fibers innervating the female basilar papilla are better suited for detection of this component of the call.&lt;ref&gt;Narins, P.M. and Capranica, R.R. 1977. An automated technique for analysis of temporal features in animal vocalizations. Animal Behavior. ''25:615-621.''&lt;/ref&gt; Sharp tuning in males decreases male selectivity for the "Qui" note, whereas comparatively broad tuning in females is suited for the detection of "Qui" notes that target females for mate attraction.

3) Finally, there is a sex difference in call duration sensitivity, with males showing the greatest response to 100&amp;nbsp;ms duration calls, approximately the length of the shorter, “Co” note of the call.&lt;ref&gt;Narins, P. and R. Capranica. 1978. Communicative significance of the two-note call of the treefrog, ''Eleutherodactylus coqui''. J. Comp. Physiol., 127:1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Recordings from male cells in the torus semicircularis led to the identification of cells that respond preferentially to stimuli of 100-150&amp;nbsp;ms duration at 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz (frequency of the “Co” note).&lt;ref name="Narins 1980"/&gt; Similar recordings from fibers of the eighth cranial nerve found no equivalent cells that are duration sensitive. The discovery of duration sensitive “off-cells” (they fire upon cessation of a signal) in males is evidence of a neural basis for the male preference for “Co” length notes, and is in agreement with other studies that have found cells sensitive to preferred stimulus durations in the torus semicircularis of other anurans.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, H.D. 1965. Patterns of acoustically evoked discharges of [[neurons]] in the mesencephalon of the bullfrog. J.Neurophysiol., 28:1155-1184.&lt;/ref&gt; Although duration sensitive cells which respond preferentially to longer stimuli have not been identified in females, this discovery shows that there may be male-specific cells that help explain the enhanced male response to short, aggressive, "Co" notes in ''E. coqui''.

Altogether, sex specific tuning differences in the primary auditory neurons of the basilar papilla and duration sensitive cells in the torus semicircularis of males suggest a mechanism to explain the sex specific response behavior observed in ''E. coqui''. Like sex differences in the olfactory system of ''M. sexta'', and in the visual system of Bibionids, sex differences in the auditory system of ''E. coqui'' benefit receivers at a functional level by maximizing sensitivity to aggressive or mate attraction signals based on the sex of the receiver and which signal is relevant. In all three systems, the sensory systems of males and females are differently adapted to receive signals that are biologically useful and beneficial to survival or reproduction.

Insect Molecular Biology, 12(6):581-594.&lt;/ref&gt; Since only females of this species seek hosts to obtain blood meals, females are expected to express differences in protein molecules used in host seeking. Sex differences in steady state levels of some antennal carrier protein genes have been discovered, but female specific antennal carrier protein genes have yet to be identified.&lt;ref name="Justice 2003"/&gt;

'''Social competence''' consists of [[social]], [[emotional]], [[cognitive]] and behavioral skills needed for successful social adaptation. Social competence also reflects having an ability to take another's perspective concerning a situation, learn from past experiences, and apply that learning to the changes in social interactions.&lt;ref name="semrud"&gt;{{cite book |last=Semrud-Clikeman |first=M. |title=Social competence in children |year=2007 |publisher=Springer Science+Business Media |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Social competence is the foundation upon which expectations for future interaction with others is built, and upon which individuals develop perceptions of their own behavior. Social competence frequently encompasses [[social skills]], [[social communication]], and [[interpersonal communication]].&lt;ref name="semrud" /&gt;

==History==
Past and current research intends to further the understanding of how and why social competence is important in healthy social development. The study of social competence began in the early 20th century. A noteworthy discovery was that social competence was related to future [[mental health]], thus fueling research on how children interact with their peers and function in social situations.&lt;ref name="site"&gt;[https://www.msu.edu/~dwong/StudentWorkArchive/CEP900F01-RIP/Knapp-SocialCompetence.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; As research developed, different definitions and measurement techniques developed to suit these new findings.

In the 1930s, researchers began investigating [[peer groups]] and how children's characteristics affected their positions within these peer groups. In the 1950s and 1960s, research established that children's social competence was related to future mental health (such as maladaptive outcomes in adulthood), as well as problems in school settings.&lt;ref name="site"/&gt; Research on social competence expanded greatly from this point on, as increasing amounts of evidence demonstrated the importance of social interactions.

Mid-century, researchers began to view social competence in terms of [[problem-solving]] skills and strategies in social situations. Social competence was now conceptualized in terms of effective social functioning and [[information processing]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, research began focusing on the impact of children's behavior on relationships,&lt;ref name="site"/&gt; which influenced the study of the effectiveness of teaching children social skills that are age, gender, and context specific.

In an effort to determine why some children were not exhibiting social skills in some interactions, many researchers devised social information processing models to explain what happens in a social interaction.&lt;ref name="site"/&gt; These models concentrated on factors in interactions such as behavior, how people process and judge each other, and how they process social cues. They also focus on how people select social goals, decide on the best response to a situation and enacting the chosen response. Studies such as this often looked at the relationship between [[social cognition]] and social competence.&lt;ref name="site"/&gt;

A prominent researcher of social competence in the mid-1980s was Frank Gresham. He identified three sub-domains of social competence: adaptive behavior, social skills, and peer acceptance (peer acceptance is often used to assess social competence). Research during this time often focused on children who were not displaying social skills in efforts to identify and help these children who were potentially at risk of long-term negative outcomes due to poor social interactions.&lt;ref name="site"/&gt; Gresham proposed that these children could have one of four deficits: skill deficits, in which children did not have the knowledge or cognitive abilities to carry out a certain behavior, performance deficits, self-control skill deficits, and self-control performance deficits, in which children had excessive anxiety or impulsivity that prohibited proper execution of the behaviors or skills they knew and understood.

Despite all the developments and changes in the conceptualization of social competence throughout the 20th century, there was still a general lack of agreement about the definition and measurement of social competence during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dodge |first1=K.A. |title=Research on Motivation in Education |year=1989 |publisher=Academic Press, Inc. |location=San Diego, CA |author2=Asher, S.R. &amp; Parkhurst, J.T. |editor=C. Ames &amp; R. Ames}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definitions of the 1980s were less ambiguous than previous definitions, but they often did not acknowledge the age, situation, and skill specificity implicit in the complex construct of social competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pellegrini |first=A.D. |title=The Child at School: Interaction with Peers and Teachers |year=2000 |publisher=Arnold |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches and theories==

===Peer regard/status approaches===
These approaches define social competence based on how [[popularity|popular]] one is with his peers.&lt;ref name="stump"&gt;{{cite book |title=Social competence |last1=Stump |first1=K.N. |year=2009 |publisher=Springer Science + Business Media; US |location=New York, NY, US |pages=23–37 |author2=Ratliff, J.M.; Wu, Y.P.; Hawley, P.H. |editor=Matson, J.L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more well-liked one is, the more socially competent they are.&lt;ref name="rose"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rose-Krasnor |first=L. |title=The nature of social competence: A theoretical review |journal=Social Development |year=1997 |volume=6 |pages=111–35 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9507.1997.tb00097.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social skill approaches===
These approaches use [[behaviors]] as a guideline.&lt;ref name="stump"/&gt; Behaviors that demonstrate social skills are compiled and are collectively identified as social competence.&lt;ref name="rose"/&gt;&lt;ref name="principles"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/34551310/The-Principles-of-Social-Competence].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship approaches===
According to these approaches, social competence is assessed by the quality of one's [[interpersonal relationship|relationships]] and the ability to form relationships. Competence depends on the skills of both members of the relationship; a child may appear more socially competent if interacting with a socially skilled partner.&lt;ref name="rose"/&gt; Commentators on some online [[incel]] communities have advocated government programs wherein socially awkward men are helped or women are incentivized to go on dates with them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/socially-anxiety-dating-government-should-pay-women-date-men_n_3293626&lt;/ref&gt;

===Functional approaches===
The functional approach is context-specific and concerned with the identification of social goals and tasks. This approach also focuses on the outcomes of social behavior and the processes leading to those outcomes. Information-processing models of social skills are important here, and based on the idea that social competence results from social-cognitive processes.&lt;ref name="rose"/&gt;

==Models==
Early models of social competence stress the role of context and situation specificity in operationalizing the competence construct.&lt;ref name="goldfried"&gt;{{cite book |title=Current topics in clinical and community psychology |year=1969 |publisher=Academic |location=New York |pages=151–96 |author1=Goldfried, M.R. |author2=D'Zurilla, T.J. |editor=C. Spielberger}}&lt;/ref&gt; These models also allow for the organization and integration of the various component skills, behaviors and cognitions associated with social competence. Whereas global definitions focus on the "ends" rather than the "means" by which such ends are achieved,&lt;ref name="goldfried"/&gt; a number of models directly attend to the theorized processes underlying competence.&lt;ref name="goldfried"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crick"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crick |first1=N.R. |author2=Dodge, K.A. |title=A review and reformulation of social information-processing mechanisms in children's social adjustment |journal=Psychological Bulletin |year=1994 |volume=115 |pages=74–101 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.115.1.74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="felner"&gt;{{cite book |title=The development of social competence in adolescence |year=1990 |publisher=Sage |location=Beverly Hills, CA |pages=245–64 |author1=Felner, R.D. |author2=Lease, A.M. &amp; Phillips, R.S.C. |editor=T.P. Gullota, G.R. Adams &amp; R. Montemayor}}&lt;/ref&gt; These process models are context specific and seek to identify critical social goals and tasks associated with social competence. Other models focus on the often overlooked distinction between social competence and the indices (i.e., skills and abilities) used to gauge it.

===Behavioral–analytic model===
Goldfried and D'Zurilla&lt;ref name="goldfried"/&gt; developed a five-step behavioral-analytic model outlining a definition of social competence.

The specific steps proposed in the model include: (1) situational analysis, (2) response enumeration, (3) response evaluation, (4) measure development, and (5) evaluation of the measure.
#Situation analysis – a critical situation is defined on the basis of certain criteria, which include:
##occurs with some frequency
##presents a difficult response decision
##results in a range of possible responses in a given population.&lt;ref name="goldfried"/&gt; Situation identification and analysis is accomplished through a variety of methods, including direct observation by self or others, interviews, and surveys.
#Response enumeration – sampling of possible responses to each situation is obtained. Procedures for generating response alternatives include direct observation, role plays, and simulations in video and/or written formats.
#Response evaluation – the enumerated responses are judged for effectiveness by "significant others" in the environment. An important element is that a consensus must emerge or the particular item is removed from future consideration.

In the last two steps (4 and 5) a measure for assessing social competence is developed and evaluated.

===Social information-processing model===
A social information-processing model is a widely used means for understanding social competence.&lt;ref name="crick"/&gt; The social information-processing model focuses more directly on the cognitive processes underlying response selection, enactment, and evaluation. Using a computer metaphor, the reformulated social information-processing model outlines a six-step nonlinear process with various feedback loops linking children's social cognition and behavior. Difficulties that arise at any of the steps generally translates into social competence deficits.    

The six steps are:
#Observation and encoding of relevant stimuli – attending to and encoding non-verbal and verbal social cues, both external and internal.
#Interpretation and mental representation of cues – understanding what has happened during the social encounter, as well as the cause and intent underlying the interaction.
#Clarification of goals – determining what one's objective is for the interaction and how to put forth an understanding of those goals.
#Representation of situation is developed by accessing long-term memory or construction – the interaction is compared to previous situations stored in long-term memory and the previous outcomes of those interactions.
#Response decision/selection
#Behavioral enactment and evaluation

===Tri-component model===
Another way to conceptualize social competence is to consider three underlying subcomponents in a hierarchical framework.&lt;ref name="cavell"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cavell |first=T.A. |title=Social adjustment, social performance, and social skills: A tri-component model of social competence |journal=Journal of Clinical Child Psychology |year=1990 |volume=19 |pages=111–22 |doi=10.1207/s15374424jccp1902_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Social Adjustment
#Social Performance
#Social Skills

The top of the hierarchy includes the most advanced level, social adjustment. Social adjustment is defined as the extent to which an individual achieves society's developmentally appropriate goals.&lt;ref name= "cavell"/&gt; The goals are conceived of as different "statuses" to be achieved by members of a society (e.g., health, legal, academic or occupational, socioeconomic, social, emotional, familial, and relational statuses). The next level is social performance&amp;nbsp;– or the degree to which an individual's responses to relevant social situations meet socially valid criteria. The lowest level of the hierarchy is social skills, which are defined as specific abilities (i.e. overt behavior, social cognitive skills, and emotional regulation) allowing for the competent performance within social tasks.

===The quadripartite model===
The essential core elements of competence are theorized to consist of four superordinate sets of skills, abilities, and capacities: (1) cognitive skills and abilities, (2) behavioral skills, (3) emotional competencies, and (4) motivational and expectancy sets.&lt;ref name="felner"/&gt;
#Cognitive skills and abilities – cultural and social knowledge necessary for effective functioning in society (i.e., academic and occupational skills and abilities, decision-making ability, and the processing of information)
#Behavioral skills – knowledge of behavioral responses and the ability to enact them (i.e., negotiation, role- or perspective-taking, assertiveness, conversational skills, and prosocial skills)
#Emotional skills – affect regulation and affective capacities for facilitating socially competent responding and forming relationships
#Motivational and expectancy sets – an individual's value structure, moral development, and sense of efficacy and control.

==The developmental framework==
Social competence develops over time, and the mastery of social skills and interpersonal social interactions emerge at various time points on the developmental continuum (infancy to adolescence) and build on previously learned skills and knowledge.&lt;ref name="semrud"/&gt; Key facets and markers of social competence that are remarkably consistent across the developmental periods (early childhood, middle/late childhood, adolescence) include prosocial skills (i.e., friendly, cooperative, helpful behaviors) and self-control or regulatory skills (i.e., anger management, negotiation skills, problem-solving skills).&lt;ref name= "semrud"/&gt; However, as developmental changes occur in the structure and quality of interactions, as well as in cognitive and language abilities, these changes affect the complexity of skills and behaviors contributing to socially competent responding.

==Contributing factors==

===Temperament===
[[Temperament]] is a construct that describes a person's biological response to the environment.&lt;ref name="semrud"/&gt; Issues such as soothability, rhythmicity, [[sociability]], and [[arousal]] make up this construct.&lt;ref name="semrud"/&gt; Most often sociability contributes to the development of social competence.

===Attachment===
Social experiences rest on the foundation of parent–child relationships, and are important in the later development of social skills and behaviors. Attachment of an infant to a care-giver is important for the development of later social skills and behaviors&lt;ref name="ainsworth"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ainsworth |first=M. |title=Infant-mother attachment |journal=American Psychologist |year=1979 |volume=34 |pages=932–7 |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.34.10.932 |pmid=517843 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; that develop social competence. Attachment helps the infant learn that the world is predictable and trustworthy or in other instances capricious and cruel. [[Mary Ainsworth|Ainsworth]]&lt;ref name= "ainsworth"/&gt; describes four types of attachment styles in infancy, including [[security|secure]], [[anxious–avoidant attachment|anxious–avoidant]], anxious–resistant and disorganized/disoriented. The foundation of the attachment bond allows the child to venture out from his/her mother to try new experiences and new interactions. Children with secure attachment styles tend to show higher levels of social competence relative to children with unsecure attachment, including anxious–avoidant, anxious–resistant, and disorganized/disoriented.&lt;ref name="semrud"/&gt;

===Parenting style===
Parents are the primary source of social and emotional development in infancy, early, and middle/late childhood. The socialization practices of parents influence whether their child will develop social competence. Parenting style captures two important elements of parenting: parental warmth/responsiveness and parental control/demandingness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of child psychology |volume=Vol. 4.

* Children and adolescents whose parents are uninvolved perform most poorly in all domains.

Other factors that contribute to social competence include teacher relationships, peer groups, neighborhood, and community.

==Related problem behaviors==
An important researcher in the study of social competence, Voeller, states that there are three clusters of problem behaviors that lead to the impairment of social competence.&lt;ref name="voeller"&gt;{{cite book |title=Frames of reference for the assessment of learning disabilities: New views on measurement issues |year=1994 |publisher=Paul H. Brookes Publishing Company |location=Baltimore |pages=523–54 |author= Voeller, K.K.S. |editor=G.R. Lyon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voeller clusters include: (1) an aggressive and hostile group, (2) a perceptual deficits subgroup, and (3) a group with difficulties in self-regulation.
#Children with aggressive and hostile behaviors are those whose acting out behaviors negatively influence their ability to form relationships, and sustain interpersonal interactions.&lt;ref name="voeller"/&gt; Aggressive and hostile children tend to have deficiencies in social information-processing, and employ inappropriate social problem solving strategies to social situations.&lt;ref name="voeller"/&gt; They also tend to search for fewer facts in a social situation and pay more attention to the aggressive social interactions presented in an interaction.&lt;ref name="crick"/&gt;
#Children with perceptual deficits do not perceive the environment appropriately and interpret interpersonal interactions inaccurately. They also have difficulty reading social cues, facial expressions and body gestures.
#Children with self-regulation deficits tend to have the classic difficulties in executive functions.

==Assessments==
While understanding the components of social competence continue to be empirically validated, the assessment of social competence is not well-studied&lt;ref name= "principles" /&gt; and continues to develop in procedures.&lt;ref name="semrud"/&gt; There are a variety of methods for the assessment of social competence and often include one (or more) of the following:

{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
* Child&amp;ndash;adolescent interview
* Observations
* Parent report measures
* Self-report measures
* Sociometric measures (i.e., peer nominations)
* Teachers report measures
{{div col end}}

==Interventions==
Following the increased awareness of the importance of social competence in childhood, interventions are used to help children with social difficulties. Historically, intervention efforts did not improve children's peer status or yield long-lasting effects. Interventions did not take into account that social competence problems do not occur in isolation, but alongside other problems as well. Thus, current intervention efforts target social competence both directly and indirectly in varying contexts.

===Preschool and early-childhood interventions===
Early childhood interventions targeting social skills directly improve the peer relations of children. These interventions focus on at-risk groups such as single, adolescent mothers and families of children with early behavior problems. Interventions targeting both children and families have the highest success rates. When children reach preschool age, social competence interventions focus on the preschool context and teach prosocial skills. Such interventions generally entail teaching problem-solving and conflict management skills, sharing, and improving parenting skills. Interventions improve children's social competence and interactions with peers in the short-term and they also reduce long-term risk, such as substance abuse or delinquent behavior.

===School-age interventions===
Social competence becomes more complicated as children grow older, and most intervention efforts for this age group target individual skills, the family, and the classroom setting. These programs focus on training skills in problem solving, emotional understanding, cooperation, and self-control. Understanding one's emotions, and the ability to communicate these emotions, is strongly emphasized. The most effective programs give children the opportunity to practice the new skills that they learn. Results of social competence interventions include decreased aggression, improved self-control, and increased conflict resolution skills.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6390">'''Special rights''' is a term originally used by [[conservatism|conservatives]] and [[libertarianism|libertarians]] &lt;!--in the USA, right?--&gt; to refer to laws granting rights to one or more groups that are not extended to other groups.&lt;ref name="Hamowy"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Mack|first= Eric|authorlink= |editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |title=Individual rights |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC  |accessdate= |edition= |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications]], [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, California |isbn= 978-1-4129-6580-4 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |pages=245–47 |doi= 10.4135/9781412965811.n150|quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideas of special rights are controversial, as they clash with the principle of [[equality before the law]].

Potential examples of special rights include [[affirmative action]] policies or [[hate crime]] legislation with regard to ethnic, religious or sexual minorities or state recognition of marriage as a group with different taxation from those who are not married.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Concepts of ''special rights'' are closely aligned with notions of [[group rights]] and [[identity politics]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Other uses==
More recently, [[social conservatism|social conservatives]] have used the term to more narrowly refer to measures that extend existing rights for heterosexual couples to gays and lesbians, such as in the case of [[same sex marriage]], or that include sexual orientation as a civil rights minority group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Amy|title=Gay Rights At The Ballot Box|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=80iFUEYi8Q4C&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=%22gay+rights%22+%22special+rights%22&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=%22gay%20rights%22%20%22special%20rights%22&amp;f=false|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|accessdate=June 10, 2013|location=Minneapolis|page=25|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tashman|first=Brian|title=Perkins Labels LGBT-Rights Initiative a 'Radical' Push for 'Special Rights for Homosexuals and Homosexuality'|url=http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/perkins-labels-lgbt-rights-initiative-radical-push-special-rights-homosexuals-and-homosexual|publisher=People for the American Way|accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cobb|first=Michael|title=God Hates Fags: The Rhetorics of Religious Violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CHmSAL3UryQC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=%22colorado+for+family+values%22+%22special+rights%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9FS1UdnDL_Pd4APe8oGgCw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22colorado%20for%20family%20values%22%20%22special%20rights%22&amp;f=false|publisher=NYU Press|accessdate=June 10, 2013|pages=41|date=June 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used internationally, for example ''Sonderrechte'' in [[Germany]], but it is used also about special [[right-of-way (traffic)#Priority (right of way)|traffic right-of-way]] exceptions given to emergency response and military vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Flashing blue and yellow lights | publisher=German Federal Ministry of Justice | url=http://bundesrecht.juris.de/stvo/__38.html | accessdate=November 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal argument==
The basis behind the argument of the term is based on whether it should be considered just and legal for a law to treat various parties unequally. For example, in the [[US Constitution]] the prohibition on [[bills of attainder]] require that laws do not single out a single person or group of persons for specific treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Constitution of the United States: Article 1, Section 9 | url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html#1.9.3 | accessdate=2008-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[equal protection clause]] in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. Both sides argue that the other side is or has traditionally been singled out and so the law is either needed or unnecessary.

In some cases, such as those with social implications, the universal definition of rights also often conflict with other, often more regional or local, laws that require certain public standards or behavior based on cultural norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Ioanna | last=Kucaradi | title=Universality Versus Particularity? In The Light Of Epistemological Knowledge Of Norms | publisher=United Nations University | accessdate=2008-11-24 | url=http://www.unu.edu/dialogue/papers/kucuradi-s5.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Libertarianism on rights and special rights==
In ''The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism'', Eric Mack states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A too-ready acceptance of alleged rights leads to an oppressive list of enforceable obligations. As the list of others' rights grows, each of us is subject to a growing burden made up of the obligations correlative to those rights; correspondingly the ability of rights to be protective of individual choice dissolves. Moreover, as the list of rights grows, so too does the legitimate role of political and legal institutions, and the libertarian case for radically limiting the scope and power of such institutions withers away. Libertarian theories of rights avoid generating an oppressive list of obligations through the employment of two crucial distinctions – the distinction between negative and positive rights and the distinction between general and special rights.&lt;ref name="Hamowy"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Definition of minorities==
[[Minority rights]] advocacy groups often contend that such protections confer no special rights, and describe these laws instead as protecting [[Civil rights|equal rights]],&lt;ref name="glaad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glaad.org/media/guide/offensive.php|title=Offensive Terminology to Avoid|publisher=GLAAD|accessdate=2006-05-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060301110310/http://www.glaad.org/media/guide/offensive.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to past conditions or legal privileges for specific groups.

The '''T-failure criterion''' is a set of [[material failure theory|material failure criteria]] that can be used to predict both [[brittle]] and [[ductile]] failure.  &lt;ref name=Adrian/&gt;
&lt;ref name=Adrian2/&gt;

These criteria were designed as a replacement for the [[von Mises yield criterion]] which predicts the unphysical result that pure [[hydrostatic]] tensile loading of metals never leads to failure.  The T-criteria use the volumetric stress in addition to the [[deviatoric stress]] used by the von Mises criterion and are similar to the [[Drucker Prager yield criterion]].  T-criteria have been designed on the basis of energy considerations and the observation that the reversible [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] [[energy density]] storage process has a limit which can be used to determine when a material has failed. 

==Description==
The strain energy density stored in the material and calculated by the area under the &lt;math&gt;\bar{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;\bar{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; curve represents the total amount of energy stored in the material only in the case of pure shear. In all other cases, there is a divergence between the actual and calculated stored energy in the material, which is maximum in the case of pure hydrostatic loading, where, according to the von Mises criterion, no energy is stored. This paradox is resolved if a second constitutive equation is introduced, that relates hydrostatic pressure p with the volume change &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;. These two curves, namely &lt;math&gt;\bar{\sigma}-\bar{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; and (p-&lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;) are essential for a complete description of material behaviour up to failure.  Thus, two criteria must be accounted for when considering failure and two constitutive equations that describe material response. According to this criterion, an upper limit to allowable strains is set either by a critical value Τ&lt;sub&gt;V,0&lt;/sub&gt; of the elastic energy density due to volume change ('''dilatational energy''') or by a critical value Τ&lt;sub&gt;D,0&lt;/sub&gt; of the elastic energy density due to change in shape ('''distortional energy'''). The volume of material is considered to have failed by extensive plastic flow when the distortional energy Τ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; reaches the critical value Τ&lt;sub&gt;D,0&lt;/sub&gt; or by extensive dilatation when the dilatational energy Τ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; reaches a critical value Τ&lt;sub&gt;V,0&lt;/sub&gt;. The two critical values Τ&lt;sub&gt;D,0&lt;/sub&gt; and Τ&lt;sub&gt;V,0&lt;/sub&gt; are considered material constants independent of the shape of the volume of material considered and the induced loading, but dependent on the strain rate and temperature.

==Deployment for Isotropic Metals==
For the development of the criterion, a [[continuum mechanics]] approach is adopted. The material volume is considered to be a continuous medium with no particular form or manufacturing defect. It is also considered to behave as a linear elastic isotropically hardening material, where stresses and strains are related by the generalised Hook’s law and by the incremental theory of plasticity with the von Mises flow rule. For such materials, the following assumptions are considered to hold:&lt;br /&gt;
(a) The total increment of a strain component &lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; is decomposed into the elastic and the plastic &lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}^e&lt;/math&gt; increment and &lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}^p&lt;/math&gt; respectively:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}=d\epsilon_{i,j}^e+d\epsilon_{i,j}^p&lt;/math&gt; (1)&lt;br /&gt;
(b) The elastic strain increment &lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}^e&lt;/math&gt; is given by Hooke’s law:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}^e=\cfrac{1}{2G}(d{\sigma}_{i,j}-\cfrac{3\nu}{1+{\nu}}{\delta}_{i,j}dp)&lt;/math&gt;(2)&lt;br /&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;G=\cfrac{E}{2(1+\nu)}&lt;/math&gt;the [[shear modulus]], &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; the [[Poisson ratio|Poisson’s ratio]] and &lt;math&gt;{\delta}_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; the [[Kronecker delta|Krönecker delta]].&lt;br /&gt;
(c) The plastic strain increment &lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}^p&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the respective deviatoric stress:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_{i,j}^p=s_{i,j}d{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;(3)&lt;br /&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;s_{i,j}={\sigma}_{i,j}-{\delta}_{i,j}p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; an infinitesimal scalar. (3) implies that the plastic strain increment:
* depends on the value of stresses, not on their variation 
* is independent of the hydrostatic component of the [[Cauchy stress tensor]]
* is collinear with the deviatoric stresses (isotropic material)
(d) The increment in plastic work per unit volume using (4.16) is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;dw_{p}={\sigma}_{i,j}d{\epsilon}_{i,j}^p={\sigma}_{i,j}s_{i,j}d{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; (4)&lt;br /&gt;
and the increment in strain energy, &lt;math&gt;dT&lt;/math&gt;, equals to the total differential of the potential &lt;math&gt;{\Pi}&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;dT=d{\Pi}=pd{\Theta}+{\sigma}d{\epsilon}=dT_{V}+dT_{D}^*&lt;/math&gt;(5)&lt;br /&gt;
where
&lt;math&gt;{\Theta}={\epsilon}_{11}+{\epsilon}_{22}+{\epsilon}_{33}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p=\cfrac{1}{3}({\sigma}_{11}+{\sigma}_{22}+{\sigma}_{33})&lt;/math&gt; and for metals following the von Mises yield law, by definition&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\bar{\sigma}=\cfrac{1}{2}\sqrt{2}[({\sigma}_{11}-{\sigma}_{22})^2+({\sigma}_{22}-{\sigma}_{33})^2+({\sigma}_{33}-{\sigma}_{11})^2]^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;(6)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\bar{\epsilon}=\cfrac{1'''}{2}\sqrt{2}[({\epsilon}_{11}-{\epsilon}_{22})^2+({\epsilon}_{22}-{\epsilon}_{33})^2+({\epsilon}_{33}-{\epsilon}_{11})^2]^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;(7)&lt;br /&gt;
are the equivalent stress and strain respectively.
In (5) the first term of the right hand side, &lt;math&gt;dT_{V}=pd\Theta&lt;/math&gt; is the increment in elastic energy for unit volume change due to hydrostatic pressure. Its integral over a load path is the total amount of dilatational strain energy density stored in the material. The second term &lt;math&gt;dT_{D}^*=\bar{\sigma}d\bar{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; is the energy required for an infinitesimal distortion of the material. The integral of this quantity is the distortional strain energy density. The theory of plastic flow permits the evaluation of stresses, strains and strain energy densities along a path provided that &lt;math&gt;d{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; in (3) is known. In elasticity, linear or nonlinear, &lt;math&gt;d{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of strain hardening materials, &lt;math&gt;d{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; can be evaluated by recording the &lt;math&gt;\bar{\sigma}=\bar{\sigma}(\bar{\epsilon})&lt;/math&gt; curve in a pure shear experiment. The hardening function after point “y” in Figure 1 is then:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;H(\bar{\sigma},\bar{\epsilon})=\cfrac{d\bar{\sigma}}{d\bar{\epsilon}}&lt;/math&gt;(8)&lt;br /&gt;
and the infinitesimal scalar &lt;math&gt;d{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; is:
&lt;math&gt;d{\lambda}=\cfrac{3}{2\bar\sigma^2}dw_p(H)&lt;/math&gt; (9)&lt;br /&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;dw_p(H)&lt;/math&gt;is the infinitesimal increase in plastic work (see Figure 1). The elastic part of the total distortional strain energy density is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;dT_D=\bar{\sigma}d\bar{\epsilon}^e&lt;/math&gt; (10)&lt;br /&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\bar{\epsilon}^e&lt;/math&gt; is the elastic part of the equivalent strain. When there is no nonlinear elastic behaviour, by integrating (4.22) the elastic distortional strain energy density is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;T_D=\int\bar{\sigma}d\bar{\epsilon}^e=\cfrac{1}{6G}\bar{\sigma}^2&lt;/math&gt; (11)&lt;br /&gt;
Similarly, by integrating the increment in elastic energy for unit volume change due to hydrostatic pressure, &lt;math&gt;dT_V=pd\Theta&lt;/math&gt;, the dilatational strain energy density is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;T_V=\int{pd\Theta}=\cfrac{1}{2K}p^2=\cfrac{1}{2}K{\Theta}^2&lt;/math&gt; (12)&lt;br /&gt;
assuming that the unit volume change'' &lt;math&gt;{\Theta}&lt;/math&gt; is the elastic straining, proportional to the hydrostatic pressure, p (Figure 2):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;{\Theta}=\cfrac{1}{2K}p&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;d{\Theta}=\cfrac{1}{K}dp&lt;/math&gt; (13)&lt;br /&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;{\Theta}={\epsilon}_{11}+{\epsilon}_{22}+{\epsilon}_{33}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p=\cfrac{1}{3}({\sigma}_{11}+{\sigma}_{22}+{\sigma}_{33})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K=\cfrac{E}{3(1-2\nu)}&lt;/math&gt; the bulk modulus of the material. &lt;br /&gt;
In summary, in order to use (12) and (13) to determine the failure of a material volume, the following assumptions hold:
* The material is isotropic and follows the von Mises yield condition
* The elastic part of the stress-strain curve is linear
* The relationship between hydrostatic pressure and unit volume change is linear
* The derivative (hardening slope) must be positive or zero'''

== Limitations ==
The criterion will not predict any failure due to distortion for elastic-perfectly plastic, rigid-plastic, or strain softening materials. For the case of nonlinear elasticity, appropriate calculations for the integrals in and (12) and (13) accounting for the nonlinear elastic material properties must be performed. The two threshold values for the elastic strain energy &lt;math&gt;T_{V,0}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_{D,0}&lt;/math&gt; are derived from experimental data. A drawback of the criterion is that elastic strain energy densities are small and comparatively hard to derive. Nevertheless, example values are presented in the literature as well as applications where the T-criterion appears to perform quite well.

In [[general relativity]], the '''Weyl−Lewis−Papapetrou coordinates''' are a set of [[coordinates]], used in the solutions to the [[vacuum]] region surrounding an [[axisymmetric]] distribution of [[mass–energy]]. They are named for [[Hermann Weyl]], [[T. Lewis (physicist)|T. Lewis]]&lt;!---need to confirm exactly who he is---&gt;, and [[Achilles Papapetrou]].&lt;ref&gt;Weyl, H., "Zur Gravitationstheorie," ''Ann. der Physik'' '''54''' (1917), 117–145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Lewis, "Some special solutions of the equations of axially symmetric gravitational fields," ''Roy. Soc., Proc.'' '''136''', 176–92 (May 2, 1932).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

A '''young adult''' is generally a person ranging in age from their late teens or early twenties to their thirties, although definitions and opinions, such as [[Erik Erikson]]'s [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of human development]], vary. The young [[adult]] stage in human development precedes [[middle age|middle adulthood]]. A person in the middle adulthood stage ages from 40 or 41 to 64. In [[old age]], a person is 65 years old or older.&lt;ref name="Martin Briner"&gt;Martin Briner, [http://www.dean.usma.edu/math/activities/cape/Constructivism/501erik.htm Erik Erikson page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821183134/http://www.dean.usma.edu/math/activities/cape/Constructivism/501erik.htm |date=2006-08-21 }}, 1999, on Briner's [http://www.dean.usma.edu/math/activities/cape/Constructivism/501learn.htm site about learning theories] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007042838/http://www.dean.usma.edu/math/activities/cape/Constructivism/501learn.htm |date=2006-10-07 }}, USMA Department of Mathematical Sciences, Center for Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE), United States Military Academy at West Point. Accessed 24 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time co-ordinates==
For a variety of reasons, timeliness on young adulthood cannot be exactly defined—producing different results according to the different mix of overlapping indices (legal, maturational, occupational, sexual, emotional and the like) employed, or on whether 'a ''developmental perspective''... [or] the ''socialization perspective''&lt;ref name=Levinson1986&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levinson |first1=Daniel J. |title=A conception of adult development |journal=American Psychologist |volume=41 |issue=1 |year=1986 |pages=3–13 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.41.1.3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is taken. 'Sub-phases in this timetable of psychosocial growth patterns... are not rigid, and both social change and individual variations must be taken into account'{{sfn|Rapoport|Rapoport|1980|p=46}}—not to mention regional and cultural differences. Arguably indeed, with people living longer, and also reaching puberty earlier, 'age norms for major life events have become highly elastic'{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=15}} by the twenty-first century.

Some have suggested that, after {{'}}''Pre-adulthood''... in the first 20 years or so... the second era, ''Early Adulthood'', lasts from about age 17 to 45... the adult era of greatest energy and abundance and of greatest contradiction and stress.'&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt; Within that framework, 'the ''Early Adult Transition'' (17–22) is a developmental bridge between pre-adulthood and early adulthood',&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt; recognizing that 'the transition into adulthood is not a clear-cut dividing line'.{{sfn|Zastrow|Kirst-Ashman|2009|p=411}} One might alternatively speak of 'a ''Provisional Adulthood (18–30)''... [&amp;] the initiation to First Adulthood'{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=10}}{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=59}} as following that.

Despite all such fluidity, there is broad agreement that it is essentially the twenties and thirties which constitute {{'}}''Early adulthood''... the basis for what [[Daniel Levinson|Levinson]] calls ''the Dream''—a vision of his [or her] goal's in life which provide motivation and enthusiasm for the future'.{{sfn|Birch|1997|p=220}}

==Health==
Young/prime adulthood can be considered the healthiest time of life{{sfn|Zastrow|Kirst-Ashman|2009|p=411}} and young adults are generally in good health, subject neither to [[disease]] nor the problems of [[senescence]]. Strength and [[Physical fitness|physical performance]] reach their peak from 18–39 years of age.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tarpenning KM, Hamilton-Wessler M, Wiswell RA, Hawkins SA |title=Endurance training delays age of decline in leg strength and muscle morphology |journal=Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=74–8 |year=2004 |pmid=14707771 |doi=10.1249/01.MSS.0000106179.73735.A6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Knechtle B, Rüst CA, Rosemann T, Lepers R |title=Age-related changes in 100-km ultra-marathon running performance |journal=Age |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=1033–45 |year=2012 |pmid=21796378 |pmc=3682063 |doi=10.1007/s11357-011-9290-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flexibility (anatomy)|Flexibility]] may decrease with age throughout adulthood.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Association of Flexibility, Balance, and Lumbar Strength with Balance Ability: Risk of Falls in Older Adults|first1=Emilio J.

In [[developed countries]], [[mortality rate]]s for the 18–40 age group are typically very low. Men are more likely to die at this age than women, particularly in the 18–25 group: reasons include [[car accidents]] and [[suicide]]. Mortality statistics among men and women level off during the late twenties and thirties, due in part to good health and less [[recklessness (psychology)|risk-taking behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Life Expectancy Profiles  | work =  | publisher = BBC  | date=   6 June 2005  | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3784854  | accessdate = 2007-06-26  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding disease, [[cancer]] is much less common in young than in older adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = UK cancer mortality statistics by age| publisher = Cancer Research UK  |date=May 2007| url = http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/mortality/age/  | accessdate = 2007-06-26  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions are [[testicular cancer]], [[cervical cancer]], and [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Cancers at a glance | publisher = Cancer Research UK  |date=May 2007| url = http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerandresearch/cancers/  | accessdate = 2007-06-26  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sub-Saharan Africa]], [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] has hit the early adult population particularly hard. According to a [[United Nations]] report, AIDS has significantly increased mortality of between ages 20 to 55 for African males and 20 to 45 for African females, reducing the [[life expectancy]] in South Africa by 18 years and in Botswana by 34 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |author1=Ngom, Pierre  |author2=Clark, Samuel   |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Adult Mortality In The Era Of HIV/AIDS: Sub-Saharan Africa  | publisher = Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations Secretariat  | date=  18 August 2003 | url = https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/adultmort/CLARK_Paper3.pdf  | format = pdf  | accessdate = 2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early adulthood==
According to Erikson, in the wake of the adolescent emphasis upon [[identity formation]], 'the young adult, emerging from the search for and insistence on identity, is eager and willing to fuse their identity with that of others. He [or she] is ready for [[intimacy]], that is, the capacity to commit... to concrete affiliations and partnerships.'{{sfn|Erikson|1975|p=255}} To do so means the ability 'to face the fear of ego loss in situations which call for self-abandon: in the solidarity of close affiliations, in orgasms and [[sex|sexual unions]], in close friendships and in physical combat'.{{sfn|Erikson|1975|p=155}} Avoidance of such experiences 'because of a fear of ego-loss may lead to a deep sense of [[solitude|isolation]] and consequent self-absorption'.{{sfn|Erikson|1975|p=155}}

Where isolation is avoided, the young adult may find instead that 'satisfactory sex relations... in some way take the edge off the hostilities and potential rages caused by the oppositeness of male and female, of fact and fancy, of [[love]] and hate';{{sfn|Erikson|1975|p=257}} and may grow into the ability to exchange intimacy, love and [[compassion]].

In modern societies, young adults in their late teens and early 20s encounter a number of issues as they finish school and begin to hold full-time jobs and take on other responsibilities of adulthood; and 'the young adult is usually preoccupied with self-growth in the context of society and relationships with others.'{{sfn|Birch|1997|p=227}} The danger is that in 'the second era, ''Early Adulthood''... we must make crucially important choices regarding marriage, family, work, and lifestyle before we have the maturity or life experience to choose wisely.'&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt;

While 'young adulthood is filled with avid quests for intimate relationships and other major commitments involving career and life goals', there is also "a parallel pursuit for the formulation of a set of moral values".{{sfn|Zastrow|Kirst-Ashman|2009|p=298}} Erikson has argued that it is only now that what he calls the 'ideological mind' of adolescence gives way to 'that ''[[Ethics|ethical]] sense'' which is the mark of the adult.'{{sfn|Erikson|1975|pp=254–6}}

Reaching adulthood in modern society is not always a linear or clean transition. As generations continue to adapt, new markers of adulthood are created that add different social expectations of what it means to be an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vandegrift |first1=Darcie |title='We don't have any limits': Russian young adult life narratives through a social generations lens |journal=Journal of Youth Studies |volume=19 |issue=2 |year=2015 |pages=221–36 |doi=10.1080/13676261.2015.1059930 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age 30 transition==

Daniel Levinson suggested that the first phase of early adulthood comes to a close around twenty-eight to thirty, when 'at about 28 the provisional character of the twenties is ending and life is becoming more serious... the ''age-thirty crisis''.'&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt; between age 28 and 32', stressing that 'it is not uncommon, at the approach to the thirties, to tear up the life structure one put together to support the original dream of the twenties,'{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=47}} and to start anew—'to create the basis for the next life structure.&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt;
When 'the Age Thirty Transition' is a difficult one, 'in a severe crisis [s/]he experiences a threat to life itself, the danger of chaos and dissolution, the loss of hope for the future.&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt;

==Settling down==
After the relative upheaval of the early 30s, the middle to late 30s are often characterized by '''settling down''': 'the establishment phase', involving 'what we would call ''major life investments''—work, family, friends, community activities, and values.'{{sfn|Rapoport|Rapoport|1980|p=46}}{{sfn|Rapoport|Rapoport|1980|p=72}} What has been termed 'the ''Culminating Life Structure for Early Adulthood'' (33–40) is the vehicle for completing this era and realizing our youthful aspirations.'&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt; People in their thirties may increase the financial and emotional investments they make in their lives, and may have been employed long enough to gain promotions and raises. They often become more focused on advancing their careers and gaining stability in their personal lives—'with marriage and child-rearing,'{{sfn|Rapoport|Rapoport|1980|p=46}} starting a [[family]], coming to the fore as priorities.

[[Gail Sheehy]], however, signposts the same twenties/thirties division rather differently, arguing that nowadays 'the twenties have stretched out into a long Provisional Adulthood', and that in fact 'the transition to the Turbulent Thirties marks the initiation to First Adulthood.'{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=55}}{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=59}}

==Midlife transition==

Young Adulthood then draws to its close with 'the ''Midlife Transition'', from roughly age 40 to 45'&lt;ref name=Levinson1986/&gt;—producing 'a brand-new passage in the forties, when First Adulthood ends and Second Adulthood begins.'{{sfn|Sheehy|1996|p=14}}
