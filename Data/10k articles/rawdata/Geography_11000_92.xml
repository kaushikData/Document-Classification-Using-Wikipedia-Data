The '''A-train''' (from '''Afternoon Train''') is a [[satellite constellation]] of five [[Earth observation satellite]]s of varied nationality in [[sun-synchronous orbit]] at an [[altitude]] of {{convert|705|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;«A-train Symposium October 2007: Constellation keeps its promises», ''CNESMAG'', January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The orbit, at an [[Orbital inclination|inclination]] of 98.14°, crosses the equator each day at around 1:30 pm [[solar time]], giving the constellation its name (the "A" stands for "afternoon"&lt;ref&gt;NASA, [http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/a-train/a-train.html Introducing the A-Train], 10.26.10 (accessed April 30 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;) and crosses the equator again on the night side of the Earth, at around 1:30 am.

They are spaced a few [[minute]]s apart from each other so their collective observations may be used to build high-definition [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] images of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] and surface.

: ''For "Antonio Raimondi" the province of the [[Ancash Region]] in [[Peru]], see [[Antonio Raymondi Province|Antonio Raimondi]]''

'''Antonio Raimondi''' (September 19, 1826 &amp;ndash; October 26, 1890) was a prominent [[Italy|Italian]]-born [[Peru]]vian geographer and scientist.  Born in [[Milan]], Raimondi emigrated to Peru, arriving on July 28, 1850 at the port of [[Callao]].  In 1851 he became a professor of [[natural history]].  In 1856, he was one of the founding professors of the [[medical school]] at the [[National University of San Marcos]]; in 1861, he founded the [[analytical chemistry]] department.

Raimondi died in the town of [[San Pedro de Lloc]] in the [[La Libertad Region]] of northern [[Perú]]. The house in which he died still stands and is located within a block of the town's main plaza. It has been converted to a museum in his honor.

Throughout his career, Raimondi displayed a passion for all things Peruvian.  He undertook no less than 18 extensive journeys to all regions of the country, studying the nation's geography, geology, botany, zoology, ethnography, and archaeology.  In 1875, he collected his findings in the massive tome ''[[El Perú (book)|El Perú]]'', which was subsequently republished in numerous editions over the next 40 years.  The [[Raimondi Museum]] in [[Lima]] houses some of the collections he gathered in his travels.

A popular historical figure in Peru, Raimondi is the namesake of many Peruvian cultural institutions, including schools, theaters, museums, and institutes of higher learning.  The [[Antonio Raymondi Province]] (county) in the [[Ancash Region]] (state) of Peru is also named after him.  Some of his biological discoveries also carry his name, such as the [[Neoraimondia]] genus of [[cactus]].

The '''Association of European Schools of Planning''' ('''AESOP''') is a network of [[Europe]]an universities, their departments and affiliated schools that are engaged in teaching and research in the fields of [[urban planning|urban]] and [[regional planning]].

== Foundation ==
The formal charter of the establishment of AESOP was signed in [[Dortmund]], [[Germany]] in 1987. In 1992, it was formally registered as a [[non-profit]] association under [[Belgian]] law.

== Aims ==
The association aims to promote the development of the teaching curricula and research among its member institutions through mutual [[dialogue]], [[communication]], exchange, and dissemination of research practices.

== Presidents ==
* Klaus Kunzmann (1987-1990)
* Louis Albrecht (1990-1992)
* Giorgio Piccinato (1992-1994)
* Patsy Healey (1994-1996)
* Marcel Bazin (1996-1998)
* Tadeusz Markowski (1998-2000)
* Hans Mastop (2000-2002)
* Alessandro Balducci (2002-2004)
* Simin Davoudi (2004-2006)
* Peter Ache (2006-2008)
* Wilem Salet (2008-2010)
* Kristina L. Nilsson (2010-2012)
* Gert de Roo (2012-2014)
* Francesco Lo Piccolo (2014-2016)
* Anna Geppert (ongoing)

== Events ==
AESOP aims to achieve its goals through the organization of a set of events:
* AESOP Annual Congress, focussing on European, national, regional and local spatial planning issues
* Annual AESOP Heads of Schools Meeting, discussing planning education and curricula related issues
* Annual AESOP PhD Workshop, usually preceding the annual congress and fostering interaction and learning among Ph.D. candidates focussing on planning related issues
* European Urban Summer School, aiming to bring together young professionals and experienced academics and practitioners from across Europe to discuss relevant planning issues
* AESOP Lecture Series to find possible answers to present-day and emerging challenges that face planning and planners as a modern discipline in a new role in a contemporary complex and dynamic society

== Young Academic Network ==
In 2003-2004, AESOP launched the AESOP Young Academics (YA) Network. This was founded as a working group, particularly addressed to planners who have only recently entered the academic world: [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD students]], [[postdoctoral researcher]]s, and people starting in academic positions. The activities of the AESOP YA Network are complementary to other activities deployed within AESOP as a whole.

The core aim of the YA is to make AESOP a challenging environment for young academics. Since 2005, the YA organizes its own YA conference, whose aim is to attract a small group of young researchers. The YA conference does not ask any fee of its participants, to help young academics to present their work and ideas as easily as possible. The YA launched their own open-access peer-reviewed international academics journal, called ''PlaNext''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Website of PlaNext Journal|url=http://journals.aesop-planning.eu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== YA Coordination Team ===
The YA network and their activities are represented by the YA Coordination Team (CT), composed by five democratically chosen members of the network. Every year half of the Coordination Team, two or three, are replaced. Every team chooses among themselves a chair of the young academics. The chair also has a seat in the [[Executive committee|Executive Committee]] of AESOP, representing the young academics within the association.

==== Chairs of the YA CT ====

The '''Bahamian pineyards''' are a [[Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests|tropical and subtropical coniferous forest]] ecoregion in [[The Bahamas]] and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], where they occur on an area of {{convert|2100|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;{{WWF ecoregion |id=nt0301 |name=Bahamian pine forests |accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.org/initiatives/fire/files/bahamas_assessment.pdf |title=Fire Management Assessment of the Caribbean Pine (''Pinus caribea'') Forest Ecosystems on Andros and Abaco Islands, Bahamas |work=TNC Global Fire Initiative |publisher=[[The Nature Conservancy]] |date=September 2004 |accessdate=2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pineyards are found on four of the northern islands in The Bahamas: [[Andros, Bahamas|Andros]], [[Abaco Islands|Abaco]], [[Grand Bahama]], where they cover half of the island,&lt;ref name="grand_bahama"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geographia.com/grandbahama/ecosystems.htm |first=Erika |last=Moultrie |title=The Ecosystems of Grand Bahama Island |publisher=Grand Bahama Island Tourism Board |accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New Providence]], as well as the [[Turks and Caicos Islands#Caicos Islands|Caicos Islands]]. Pineyards are dominated by Bahamian pine ([[Caribbean pine|''Pinus caribaea'' var.

'''Büyükada Nature Park''' ({{lang-tr|Büyükada Tabiat Parkı}}) is a [[nature park]] in [[Istanbul Province]], Turkey.

[[Büyükada]] (literally: Big Island) is the biggest of the [[Princes' Islands]], a group of nine islands in the [[Sea of Marmara]], in [[Adalar]] district southeast of Istanbul Province. An area east of the island was declared a [[nature park]] by the [[Ministry of Environment and Forest (Turkey)|Ministry of Environment and Forest]] in 2011. It covers an area of about {{convert|4.45|ha|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="b1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt;

'''Carl Frederick Kraenzel''' (November 1, 1906 – July 26, 1980) was an American [[sociologist]].  Most of Kraenzel’s work focuses on the people of the [[Great Plains]], covering a range of topics including quality of life, power relations, resource use, and mental health. Kraenzel has been widely published in  a variety of professional journals, monographs, research bulletins, special reports and books in the fields of [[rural sociology]], [[Great Plains]] sociology, and natural resource sociology.  His most known work, ''The Great Plains in Transition'' describes the challenges of social life and connections to the natural environments in the North American semiarid region located between the [[98th meridian west|98th meridian]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Born in [[Hebron, North Dakota]], Kraenzel grew up on a farm in the countryside of the Northern Great Plains and witnessed first-hand the challenges of rural life and living in the region.    Kraenzel attended the University of North Dakota for his undergraduate degree, and continued on to do graduate work at the [[University of Minnesota]], [[Harvard University]], and the [[University of Wisconsin]], where he received his Ph.D in 1935. Kraenzel served as a professor of sociology at [[Montana State University]] in [[Bozeman, Montana|Bozeman]] for many years, and later at the [[University of Texas at El Paso]].

A '''congressional district''' is an electoral [[constituency]] that elects a single member of a [[congress]]. Countries with congressional [[Electoral district|districts]] include the [[United States]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Japan]]. A congressional district is based on population, which, in the United States, is taken using a census every ten years.

There are 435 congressional districts in the [[United States House of Representatives]],&lt;ref name="USPL 62-5"&gt;See [[Public Law 62-5]] of 1911, though Congress has the authority to change that number. The [[Reapportionment Act of 1929]] capped the size of the House at 435.&lt;/ref&gt; with each one representing approximately 711,000 people.&lt;ref name="2010 census"&gt;[https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-08.pdf Congressional Apportionment. 2010 Census Briefs] U.S. Census.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the 435 congressional districts, the five inhabited [[Insular area|U.S. territories]] and the [[federal district]] of [[Washington, D.C.]] each send a [[Non-voting members of the United States House of representatives|non-voting delegate]] to the House of Representatives. The [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] within the [[United States Department of Commerce]] conducts a [[United States Census|decennial census]] whose figures are used to determine the number of Representatives that each [[U.S. state|state]] sends to Congress, and therefore the number of congressional districts within each state. The borders of those districts are set by the states, and within each state all districts are required to have approximately equal populations (see ''[[Wesberry v. Sanders]]''). The 2012 elections were the first to be based on the congressional districts which were defined based on the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]] data.&lt;ref name=zipcodedownload.com&gt;{{cite web|title=zipcodedownload.com|url=https://zipcodedownload.com/Products/Family/CongressionalDistrict|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federal Geographic Data Committee''' (FGDC) is a United States government committee which promotes the coordinated development, use, sharing, and dissemination of geospatial data on a national basis. Its 32 members are representatives from the [[Executive Office of the President]], and [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] level and independent Federal agencies. The Secretary of the [[Department of the Interior]] chairs the FGDC, with the Deputy Director for Management, [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) as Vice-Chair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fgdc.gov/index.html Federal Geographic Data Committee] Retrieved 2010-08-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
The FGDC coordinates the sharing of geographic data, maps, and online services through an online portal, ''geodata.gov'', that searches metadata held within the [[OMB Circular A-16|NSDI]] Clearinghouse Network.&lt;ref&gt;Data &amp; Services. [http://www.fgdc.gov/index.html Federal Geographic Data Committee] Retrieved 2010-08-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member Compliance==
On July 23, 2009, the Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee of the House Natural Resources Committee held an oversight hearing on federal geospatial data management. Rep. [[John Sarbanes]] of Maryland quoted a U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) report from his briefing material saying that only 4 of the FGDC member agencies were in compliance.&lt;ref&gt;Will Craig (Fall 2009).

Some devices are [[avionics]] components like [[ACARS]] and [[Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast|ADS-B]]. In these cases the receiving and transmitting [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] are usually located outside of the [[airframe]].

When devices are not installed as avionics components they have to be completely independent from the aircraft. They are typically placed inside of the airframe in a location where the GPS and communication satellites are directly visible to the device, for example through the [[cockpit]] window. The output signal must also be able to penetrate the aircraft - most [[National aviation authority|civil aviation authorities]] require compliance with [[DO-160]] for audio frequency conducted susceptibility and induced signal susceptibility.

Authorities classify non-installed components as "transmitting portable electronic devices" (T-PEDS) and as such require them to be switched off during the critical phases of flight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/22448 "AC 91.21-1B (Cancelled) - Use of Portable Electronic Devices Aboard Aircraft: Document Information], Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Accurate real-time data provided by GPS aircraft tracking may be offered to [[air traffic control]] using [[ADS-B]] technology. This can safely reduce airspace separation of aircraft. GPS aircraft tracking also enables [[airline|airlines]] to track their fleet of aircraft over the ACARS system, and allows aircraft to be more easily located in the event of an accident. The data is [[Data processing#Automatic data processing|processed]] to gather "[[OOOI]]" information about movements within the airport and to compute flight time. Finally, GPS aircraft tracking permits a flight school to track a trainee pilot and debrief his/her flight path afterwards.

== Active aircraft tracking ==
There are several active aircraft tracking systems available on the market that use the "bread-crumb approach" to SAR. Rather than relying on an emergency locator transmitter to transmit upon impact, the next generation of emergency locating devices are active tracking devices that send position reports at regular time intervals. If the unit stops transmitting upon impact, the historical transmissions will give the last known location of the aircraft, its speed, direction and altitude. Tracking as an alternative or complement to current technology has recently been encouraged by the Coroner in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10647692"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/civil-aviation-authority/news/article.cfm?o_id=500463&amp;objectid=10647692|title=Erceg coroner urges use of GPS tracking devices for aircraft|author=Ihaka, James|date=27 May 2010|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Burkina Faso]] (formerly Upper Volta) is a landlocked [[Sahel]] country that shares borders with six nations. It lies between the [[Sahara]] desert and the [[Gulf of Guinea]], south of the loop of the [[Niger River]], mostly between latitudes 9° and 15°N (a small area is north of 15°), and longitudes 6°W and 3°E. The land is green in the south, with forests and fruit trees, and desert in the north. Most of central Burkina Faso lies on a [[savanna]] plateau, {{convert|198|-|305|m|ft|0}} above sea level, with fields, brush, and scattered trees. Burkina Faso's game preserves—the most important of which are [[Arli National Park|Arly]], [[Nazinga Game Ranch|Nazinga]], and [[W National Park]]&amp;mdash;contain [[Panthera leo|lion]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[hippopotamus]], [[monkey]]s, [[common warthog]]s, and [[antelope]]s. Previously the endangered [[painted hunting dog]], ''Lycaon pictus'' occurred in Burkina Faso, but, although the last sightings were made in [[Arli National Park]],&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=35993 ''Painted Hunting Dog: Lycaon pictus'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209234758/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=35993 |date=December 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the species is considered [[Local extinction|extirpated]] from Burkina Faso. Tourism is not well developed.

==Area==
Burkina Faso has a total area of 274,200&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, of which 273,800&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is land and 400&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; water. Comparatively, it is slightly larger than [[New Zealand]] and [[Colorado]]. Its borders total 3,611&amp;nbsp;km: [[Benin]] 386&amp;nbsp;km, [[Ivory Coast]] 545&amp;nbsp;km, [[Ghana]] 602&amp;nbsp;km, [[Mali]] 1,325&amp;nbsp;km, [[Niger]] 622&amp;nbsp;km, and [[Togo]] 131&amp;nbsp;km. It has no coastline or maritime claims.

=== Extreme points ===
This is a list of the extreme points of [[Burkina Faso]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.

* Northernmost point – unnamed location on the border with [[Mali]], [[Sahel Region]]
* Easternmost point – unnamed location on the border with  [[Benin]] immediately south of the Burkina Faso-Benin-Niger [[tripoint]], [[Est Region (Burkina Faso)|Est Region]]
* Southernmost point – unnamed location on the border with [[Ivory Coast]] immediately south of the village of [[Kpuere]], [[Sud-Ouest Region, Burkina Faso|Sud-Ouest Region]]
* Westernmost point - the [[tripoint]] with [[Mali]] and [[Ivory Coast]], [[Cascades Region]]

==Terrain==
It is made up of two major types of countryside. The larger part of the country is covered by a [[peneplain]], which forms a gently undulating landscape with, in some areas, a few isolated hills, the last vestiges of a Precambrian massif. The southwest of the country, on the other hand, forms a sandstone massif, where the highest peak, Ténakourou, is found at an elevation of {{convert|749|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The massif is bordered by sheer cliffs up to {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} high. The average altitude of Burkina Faso is {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} and the difference between the highest and lowest terrain is no greater than {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=off}}. Burkina Faso is therefore a relatively flat country. Its elevation extremes are a lowest point at the [[Mouhoun River|Mouhoun]] ([[Black Volta]]) River (200 m) and highest point at [[Tena Kourou]] (749 m).

==Administrative divisions==
[[File:Burkina_Faso_Provinces.png|thumb|200px|Provinces of Burkina Faso]]
[[File:Burkina Faso departments.png|thumb|left|200px|Departments of Burkina Faso]]
The country is divided into [[Regions of Burkina Faso|13 administrative regions]]. These regions encompass [[Provinces of Burkina Faso|45 provinces]] and [[Departments of Burkina Faso|351 departments]].

==Hydrography==
The country owes its former name of Upper Volta to three rivers which cross it: the Black Volta (or Mouhoun), the White Volta (Nakambé) and the Red Volta (Nazinon). The Black Volta is one of the country's only two rivers which flow year-round, the other being the Komoé, which flows to the southwest. The basin of the Niger River also drains 27% of the country's surface.

The Niger's tributaries – the Béli, the Gorouol, the Goudébo and the Dargol – are seasonal streams and flow for only four to six months a year. They still, however, can cause large floods. The country also contains numerous lakes – the principal ones are Tingrela, Bam and Dem. The country contains large ponds, as well, such as Oursi, Béli, Yomboli and Markoye. Water shortages are often a problem, especially in the north of the country.

==Climate==
{{See also|Burkina Faso#Geography and climate}}
[[File:Burkina Faso map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|250px|Burkina Faso map of Köppen climate classification.]]
Burkina Faso has a primarily tropical climate with two very distinct seasons. In the rainy season, the country receives between 600 and 900 millimetres (23.6 and 35.4 in) of rainfall; in the dry season, the [[harmattan]] – a hot dry wind from the Sahara – blows. The rainy season lasts approximately four months, May/June to September, and is shorter in the north of the country. Three climatic zones can be defined: the Sahel, the Sudan-Sahel, and the Sudan-Guinea. The Sahel in the north typically receives less than {{convert|600|mm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} [13] of rainfall per year and has high temperatures, {{convert|5|–|47|C|F|abbr=off}}.

A relatively dry tropical savanna, the Sahel extends beyond the borders of Burkina Faso, from the Horn of Africa to the Atlantic Ocean, and borders the Sahara to its north and the fertile region of the Sudan to the South. Situated between 11°3' and 13°5' north latitude, the Sudan-Sahel region is a transitional zone with regards to rainfall and temperature. Further to the south, the Sudan-Guinea zone receives more than {{convert|900|mm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}}[13] of rain each year and has cooler average temperatures.

==Resources and environment==
Burkina Faso's natural resources include manganese, limestone, marble, phosphates, pumice, salt and small deposits of [[Mining in Burkina Faso|gold]]. 21.93% of its land is arable, and 0.26% has permanent crops as of 2012. As of 2003, 250&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; were irrigated. Its total renewable water resources as of 2011 were 12.5 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;{{Clarify|date=December 2015|reason=Should this be "km"? Meters is too small.}}, with a total freshwater withdrawal of 0.72&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/yr (46% domestic, 3% industrial, 51% agricultural; this amounts to a per-capita withdrawal of 54.99 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/yr.

Burkina Faso's fauna and flora are protected in two national parks and several reserves: see [[List of national parks in Africa]], [[Nature reserves of Burkina Faso]].

Recurring [[drought]]s and [[flood]]s are a significant natural hazard.&lt;ref&gt;Heavy floods caused loss of life and widespread damage in 2007 and 2009. See also [[2007 African floods]] and [[2009 West Africa floods#Burkina Faso|2009 West Africa floods]].&lt;/ref&gt; Current environmental issues include: recent droughts and [[desertification]] severely affecting agricultural activities, population distribution, and the economy; [[overgrazing]]; [[soil degradation]]; [[deforestation]].

Burkina Faso is party to the following international environmental agreements: [[Biodiversity]], [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Climate Change]], [[Desertification]], [[Endangered Species]], [[Hazardous Wastes]], [[Marine Life Conservation]], [[Ozone Layer Protection]], [[Wetlands]]. It has signed, but not ratified, the [[Law of the Sea]] and the [[Nuclear Test Ban]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www4.unfccc.int/ndcregistry/PublishedDocuments/Burkina%20Faso%20First/INDC%20Burkina_ENG.%20version_finale.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catsg.org/cheetah/04_country-information/North-African-regions/burkina-faso.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Montenegro]] ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: ''Crna Gora'', Црна Гора, meaning "black mountain") is a small, mountainous state in south-west [[Balkans]]. Montenegro borders [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]], [[Kosovo]], [[Albania]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]]. While being a small country at 13,812 km² (5,332 sq mi), it is very diverse regarding the terrain configuration.

== Terrain ==
Terrain in Montenegro ranges from high mountains in the northern part of the country, through [[karst]] segment in central and western part, to almost 300 km of a narrow coastal plain. The coastal plain disappears completely in the north, where [[Mount Lovćen]] and other mountain ranges plunge abruptly into the inlet of the [[Gulf of Kotor]]. The coastal region is noted for active seismicity.

Montenegro's section of the karst lies generally at elevations of {{convert|100|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level-although some areas rise to {{convert|1800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The lowest segment is in the [[Bjelopavlići plain|valley of]] the [[Zeta River]], which flows at an elevation of {{convert|450|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The river occupies the centre of [[Nikšić]] field, a flat-floored, elongated depression typical of karstic regions. The underlying rock is predominantly limestone, which dissolves to form sinkholes and underground caves. The longest cave in Montenegro is [[Vražji firovi]] - 10,5 km long cave north-east from [[Berane]], and the deepest sinkhole is [[Željezna jama]] -1027 m on mount [[Maganik]].

The Zeta River Valley, or [[Bjelopavlići plain]], merges in the southeast with the second significant flat lowland in Montenegro, the [[Zeta plain]]. Zeta plain stretches north of the [[Lake Scutari]] at elevation of {{convert|40|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The two plains are today the most densely populated areas of Montenegro, housing the two biggest Montenegrin cities, [[Podgorica]] and [[Nikšić]].

The high mountains of Montenegro include some of the most rugged terrain in [[Europe]]. They average more than {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in elevation. Among notable peaks is [[Bobotov Kuk]] in the [[Durmitor]] mountain, which reaches {{convert|2523|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The Montenegrin mountains were the most ice-eroded section of the [[Balkan Peninsula]] during the [[last glacial period]].

=== The Coast ===
{{main|Montenegrin Littoral}}
{{See also|List of islands of Montenegro}}
The coast of Montenegro is {{convert|294|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long. Unlike its northern neighbour Croatia, Montenegro has no large inhabited islands along the coast. A notable feature of the Montenegrin coast is [[Bay of Kotor]], a [[fjord]]-like gulf, which is in fact a submerged river canyon. The Bay of Kotor is surrounded by mountains up to {{convert|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high, which plunge almost vertically into the sea.

To the south of the Bay of Kotor, there is a narrow coastal plain, no more than 4&amp;nbsp;km wide, which is guarded from the north by high mountains. The plain provided space for numerous small coastal settlements.

=== Hydrology ===
{{See also|List of lakes in Montenegro|List of rivers of Montenegro}}
[[File:Lago Skadar, Montenegro, 2014-04-14, DD 02.JPG|thumb|323x323px|Lago Skadar in Montenegro]]
Montenegro's surface runoff in the north is carried away by the [[Lim River|Lim]] and [[Tara River (Montenegro)|Tara]] river systems, which enter the [[Danube]] via the [[Drina River]] of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In southern Montenegro, streams flow toward the Adriatic Sea. Much of the drainage of the karstic region is not on the surface but travels in underground channels.

The largest lake in Montenegro and the Balkans is [[Lake Scutari]]. Known in Montenegro as ''Skadarsko Jezero'', it lies near the coast and extends across the international border into northern Albania. It is {{convert|50|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|16|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} wide, with a total surface area of {{convert|370|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}}. Some 60 percent lies within Montenegrin territory. The water body occupies a karstic polje depression that has a floor lying below sea level.

Montenegro's mountainous regions are noted for their numerous lakes.

The '''Grand Bara''' ({{lang-so|Baadha Wayn}}), '''Bara Wein''' or '''Bada Wein''', is a desert in southern [[Djibouti]]. It consists of large areas of sand flats, with sparse, semi-desert and desert grasses and scrub vegetation.&lt;ref name="Aean"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rod East, International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, Antelope Specialist Group |title=Antelopes: East and Northeast Africa |date=1988 |publisher=IUCN |isbn=2880329426 |page=25|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=2KRJAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A road built in 1981 passes through the area, connecting the capital [[Djibouti City]] with the south.&lt;ref name="Wimer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carim|first1=Enver|title=Middle East Review|date=1983|publisher=World of Information|page=86|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=idbsAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the arrival of the French, the extremely arid interior was inhabited primarily by the [[Issa (clan)|Issa]] [[Somali people|Somali]].

==Geography==
The Grand Bara and Petit Bara are the remains of dried up lake beds. They form vast arid plains in the centre of Djibouti and mark the delimitation of the volcanic part of the country from the sedimentary part. The clay of which they are formed is poorly drained and water collects here in the rainy season and this is followed by the growth of grasses.&lt;ref name=Alwan&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alwan, Daoud Aboubaker|author2=Mibrathu, Yohanis|title=Historical Dictionary of Djibouti |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b9drQ9YeLxcC&amp;pg=PA19 |year=2000 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-3873-4 |page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Djibouti has few paved roads; it has been estimated that there are about {{convert|2900|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of roads, only about 12% being paved, and fewer than half being serviceable throughout the year. In 1981, a road across the Grand Bara was built, linking the capital with the south. It is about {{convert|40|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eur|title=Africa South of the Sahara 2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1KBP7QbalX0C&amp;pg=PA348 |year=2002 |publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-85743-131-5|page=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
The Grand Bara is part of the [[Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands]] ecoregion. Large mammals occurring in this area include the [[Beira antelope]] (''Dorcatragus megalotis''), [[Dorcas gazelle]] (''Gazella dorcas''), [[Soemmerring's gazelle]] (''Gazella soemmerringii''), [[Salt's dik-dik]] (''Madoqua saltiana'') and [[gerenuk]] (''Litocranius walleri''). Few [[Beisa oryx]] (''Oryx beisa'') remain after great hunting pressure. The [[Berbera gerbil]] (''Gerbillus acticola'') is endemic to this region as are [[Arnold’s leaf-toed gecko]] (''Hemidactylus arnoldi'') and the [[northern sand gecko]] (''Tropiocolotes somalicus''). [[Archer's lark]] (''Heteromirafra archeri'') is the only endemic bird species.&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa1305 |name=Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands |accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
The heavy rainfall affected the Grand Bara. As a Result the Plain floods in July and September. The climate of the Grand Bara limits the number of animals living permanently in these extreme conditions.

'''H'lven''' is a [[fictional planet]] in the [[DC Comics]] Universe. It is first mentioned in ''Green Lantern'' vol. 2 #148 (January 1982).

==Pre-Crisis==
H'lven is an arboreal world located in sector 1014, home of a race of sentient rodent-like creatures nicknamed Monks for their resemblance to [[chipmunk]]s. H'lven technology is roughly equivalent to that of early 21st century Earth. Its inhabitants generally prefer to live in trees rather than in artificial structures. While the Monks are the dominant species on the planet, there are other intelligent races on H'lven that resemble [[anthropomorphic]] versions of [[Mole (animal)|moles]], [[fox]]es, [[bear]]s, and [[eagle]]s. This anthropomorphic quality may also be a natural feature of the galaxy in which H'lven resides, for nearby planets have similar inhabitants.

Like Earth and Korugar, H'lven appears to spawn individuals who possess the ability to overcome great fear, a trait that is prized in the [[Green Lantern Corps]]. There have been at least two Monks who have been chosen to be members of the Corps, namely [[Ch'p]] and [[B'Dg|B'dg]].

H'lven is a largely peaceful world prior to the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]. The planet's primary difficulties are an adversarial relationship with the nearby planet of Berrith, and the invasion of the Crabster Army under [[Doctor Ub'x]]. Ub'x's initial invasion is repelled by the Green Lantern [[Ch'p]], who continues to defend his homeworld against threats from Berrith, Ub'x, and other criminals.

==Post-Crisis==
H'lvenite history is drastically rewritten after the Crisis. In the new timeline, Ch'p apparently died as a youngster and Doctor Ub'x never existed at all. Like [[Power Girl]] and [[Lady Quark]], Ch'p and Doctor U'bx manage to survive the time shift, but are left with no identities or histories on their homeworld. Both eventually relocate to Earth to begin new lives, although Ch'p later returns to assume his duties as the planet's Green Lantern. How H'lven manages to survive the threats Ch'p is previously responsible for defeating has never been explained. Long after Ch'p's demise, another H'lvenite, [[B'Dg|B'dg]], is chosen to become Green Lantern of Sector 1014.

[[Image:Edinburgh-landscape-architecture.jpg|thumb|right|Central Edinburgh, well known to [[Gilbert Laing Meason]] is a fine example of the approach to landscape and architectural composition developed during the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] period. The circular tower (left central) is the tomb of [[David Hume]], designed by [[Robert Adam]]|300px]]

The discussion of the '''history of landscape architecture''' is a complex endeavor as it shares much of its history with that of [[landscape gardening]] and [[architecture]], spanning the entirety of man's existence.  However, it was not until relatively recent history that the term "[[landscape architecture]]" or even "landscape architect" came into common use.
{{Main|Landscape architecture}}

==Early history==
"Landscape architecture" was first used by [[Gilbert Laing Meason]] in his book ''On The Landscape Architecture of the Great Painters of Italy'' (London, 1828). Meason was born in Scotland and did not have the opportunity to visit Italy. But he admired the relationship between architecture and landscape in the great landscape paintings and drew upon [[Vitruvius|Vitruvius']] Ten books of architecture to find principles undere relationship between built form and natural form.

'Landscape architecture' was then taken up by [[John Claudius Loudon]] and used to describe a specific type of architecture, suited to being placed in designed landscapes. Loudon was admired by the American designer and theorist [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] and 'landscape architecture' was the subject of a chapter in Downing's book ''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening, Adapted to North America'' (1841).

==First years==
[[File:Central park manhattan 2 New York photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|right|333px|Olmsted  used the term 'landscape architecture' describing the whole professional task of designing a composition of planting, landform, water, paving and other structures, using the word for the first time when designing the [[Central Park]]. ]]
This led to its adoption by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]]. Frederick and a man named George Oskar gave a different slant to the meaning of 'landscape architecture', using the term to describe the whole professional task of designing a composition of planting, landform, water, paving and other structures. Their first use of this term was in the winning entry for the design of [[Central Park]] in New York City. Olmsted and Vaux then in 1863 adopted 'landscape architect' as a professional title and used it to describe their work for the planning of urban [[park system]]s. Olmsted's project for the [[Emerald Necklace]] in Boston was widely admired and led to the use of 'landscape architecture' as a professional title in Europe, initially by [[Patrick Geddes]] and [[Thomas Mawson]]. Frederick Law Olmsted and [[Beatrix Farrand]], with eight other leading practitioners

==Modern years==

Landscape architecture has since become a worldwide profession, submitted for recognition by the [[International Labour Organization]] and represented on a world-wide basis by the [[International Federation of Landscape Architects]]. 

[[Garrett Eckbo]] and [[Dan Kiley]] were prominent modernist landscape architects in the mid-20th century. Their work is represented by a shift away from what might be termed the "Wild Garden" aesthetic of earlier landscape architects influenced by Romantic Naturalism, and toward a more spare and rectilinear aesthetic. Both studied under [[Warren Manning]] at Harvard, who in turn had studied under Frederick Law Olmsted.  

Several landscape architects practicing in the 1980s and 1990s moved the discipline beyond its roots in High Modernism.  These include [[Martha Schwartz]], [[Peter Walker (landscape architect)|Peter Walker]], and [[Michael Van Valkenburgh]]. Starting in the mid-1990s, a new disciplinary shift occurred toward what has been called [[Landscape urbanism]], a term that attempts to merge urban design, infrastructure design and landscape.

Three remarkable histories of the landscape architecture profession were published in the 1970s.

A first comprehensive history of landscape architecture, as distinct from the [[history of gardening]] was written by [[Norman T Newton]] with the title ''Design on the land: the development of landscape architecture'' (Belknap/Harvard 1971). The book has 42 chapters. The first three chapters are on Ancient Times, The Middle Ages, and The World of Islam. The last three chapters are on Urban Open-Space Systems, Variations in Professional Practice and the Conservation of Natural Resources. This reflects the development of landscape architecture from a focus on private gardens, in the ancient world, to a focus on the planning and design of public open space in the modern world. Since kings used to be responsible for the provision of [[public goods]] (irrigation, streets, town walls, parks and other [[environmental good]]s) the distinction between public and private was not quite the same in the ancient world as it is in the modern world.

A second comprehensive history of landscape architecture was published, in 1973, by George B Tobey, with the title ''History of Landscape Architecture''. It extends from 5000 BC, through the development of agriculture and towns to the design of gardens, parks and garden cities. This represents a broader view of landscape architecture than that of Newton and would have been well suited to Newton's title 'Design on the land'.

A third comprehensive history of landscape architecture was published by [[Geoffrey Jellicoe|Geoffrey]] and [[Susan Jellicoe]] in 1975 with the title ''The landscape of man: shaping the environment from prehistory to the present day'' (Thames and Hudson, 1975). The book has 27 chapters and is more comprehensive than its predecessors, geographically, artistically and philosophically. Like [[Bannister Fletcher]]'s ''History of Architecture'', the book has introductory sections (e.g. on environment, social history, philosophy, expression, architecture, landscape) and then a series of examples with plans and photographs. Many of the examples are parks and gardens but the book also includes the layout of temples, towns, forests and other projects concerned with 'shaping the environment'.

&lt;!--NOTE ?: this section on the History of Landscape Architecture could and should be enlarged to include country-specific **sections, eg History of Landscape Architecture in the United States and in Australia. It is **suggested that instead of attempting a history of 'design on the land' since the dawn of history, there is a focus on the **modern (post-1500)period} and on making a [[collective landscape]]. This would avoid overlap with the [[History of **gardening]] ?---Why is history of gardening really a history of design?, and not about horticulture care of gardens?--&gt;

==Related fine arts and Representation==
The fine arts and landscape architecture have been interwoven in the outstanding professionals' methods. A history of landscape architecture, including the natural and designed the [[landscape]] and of public and private gardens: also includes the crucial professional component of  artistic and technical representation which have always been responsible for visualizing and communicating - the creative concepts, ideas, designs, options, 'manifested theories', and guiding aesthetic principles - between the landscape architect and the clients, builders, and interested parties.  A few of the media and methods are unchanged, while most have evolved over the centuries to reflect new artistic methods and graphic supplies. Almost timeless are the fine arts media of charcoal sketch, oil paint, [[watercolor]], pen and ink drawing, [[sculpture]], and [[etching]]. Those were joined by: print-making; by film photography for prints, slides, and movies; collage and built up layered images; model making, and other techniques. Since the late 20th century the introduction of computers, numerous formatting uses for scanning and printing, the wide array of options with digital technology for drawing, images and site videos; and the nearly infinite reach of the internet have revolutionized how to explore and interact to share creative intent. These have also facilitated effective communicating collaboratively within the project team, clients, and involved people the world.

'''ISO 3166-2:KZ''' is the entry for [[Kazakhstan]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Kazakhstan, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[Regions of Kazakhstan|4 cities and 14 regions]]. The cities [[Almaty]] and [[Astana]] are the former and current capitals of the country respectively and have special status equal to the regions.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|KZ}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Kazakhstan. The second part is three letters.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

[[ISO 639-1]] codes are used to represent subdivision names in the following [[official language|administrative language]]s:
* (kk): [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]
* (ru): [[Russian language|Russian]]

'''Iceberg D-16''' is a city-sized iceberg near [[Antarctica]], discovered on March 26, 2006 by the [[National Ice Center]] using satellite imagery from the [[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program]]. It broke free of the [[Fimbul Ice Shelf]], located along the northwestern section of [[Queen Maud Land]] in the eastern [[Weddell Sea]].

It is approximately 8 miles wide and 15 miles long (120 square miles), roughly the size of a [[city]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/environment/060327_new_iceberg.html New City-sized Iceberg Created Near Antarctica]. [[LiveScience]], 27 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Insular Islands''' were a giant chain of active [[volcanic island]]s somewhere in the [[Pacific Ocean]] during the [[Cretaceous]] period that rode on top a microplate called the [[Insular Plate]], beginning around 130 million years ago. The Insular Islands were surrounded by two prehistoric [[ocean]]s, the [[Panthalassa|Panthalassa Ocean]] to the west and the [[Bridge River Ocean]] to the east. About 115 million years ago, these islands collided with the North American continent, fusing onto the [[North American Plate]] and closing the Bridge River Ocean during the Mid-Cretaceous time.

The Insular Islands formed at least 210 million years before the collision. Like the earlier [[Intermontane Islands]], the large size of the islands prevented them from being pushed under the North American Plate. Instead, the Insular Islands were crumpled and crushed along the shoreline of North America to become part of the continent. The Insular Plate stopped subducting under North America; the [[subduction zone]] moved to the [[Farallon Trench]] further westward.&lt;ref name="Burke Museum"&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/geo_history_wa/Coast%20Range%20Episode.htm "The Coast Range Episode".] The Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture. Retrieved 1 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The rocks that comprised the Insular Islands now form a large geologic feature along the coast of North America known as the [[Insular Belt]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7093">'''(Iona) Jean Gottmann''' (10 October 1915, in Kharkov &amp;ndash; 28 February 1994, in Oxford) was a [[French people|French]] [[geographer]] who was best known for his seminal study on the urban region of the [[Northeast megalopolis]]. His main contributions to [[human geography]] were in the sub-fields of urban, political, economic, historical and regional geography. His regional specializations ranged from France and the [[List of Mediterranean countries|Mediterranean]] to the [[United States]], [[Israel]], and [[Japan]].

==Early years==
Gottmann was born in [[Kharkov]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russian Empire]]. He was the only child of prosperous [[Jews|Jewish]] parents, Elie Gottmann and Sonia-Fanny Ettinger, who were killed in February 1918, following the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917. He was de facto adopted by his aunt, Emily Gottmann and uncle, Michel Berchin, and escaped with them to [[Paris]] in 1921 via [[Istanbul|Constantinople]].

==Career==
Gottmann started out as a [[research assistant]] in [[economic geography]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] (1937–41) under the guidance of [[Albert Demangeon]], but was forced to leave his post with the Nazi invasion of France and the 1940 Statute of Jews which banned him from public employment. He found refuge in the United States, where he received a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] fellowship to attend the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], in the seminar of [[Edward M. Earle]]. During the war, he contributed also to the U.S. effort by consulting for the [[Board of Economic Warfare]] in Washington and other agencies; he also joined [[La France Libre]] and the exiled French academic community teaching at the [[New School for Social Research]]. [[Isaiah Bowman]] hired him as a non-tenured professor at his new institute of geography of the [[Johns Hopkins University]] (1943–48). In 1945 he returned to France to work for the French Ministry of the Economy, and he also spent two years as director of research at the [[United Nations]] (1946–47).

After the war, he started to commute between France and the United States in an effort to explain America's human geography to the French public and Europe's to the American. His multicultural perspective allowed him to get a grant from [[Paul Mellon]] to produce the first regional study of [[Virginia]] (1953–55) and financial support from [[The Century Foundation]] to study the megalopolis of the North-Eastern seaboard of the United States, which soon became a paradigm in urban geography and planning to define polynuclear global city-regions.

In 1957 he married Bernice Adelson. In 1961, he was invited to join the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] in Paris by [[Fernand Braudel]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], and [[Alexandre Koyré]] and in 1968 became Professor of Geography and Head of Department at the School of Geography at the [[University of Oxford]] (1968–1983). After retiring as emeritus professor he remained in Oxford until the end of his life.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lyons|first1=Richard D.|title=Jean Gottman, 78, a Geographer Who Saw a Northeast Megalopolis|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/02/obituaries/jean-gottman-78-a-geographer-who-saw-a-northeast-megalopolis.html|work=New York Times|date=March 2, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond his contribution to the study of [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]] and to urban geography, his theoretical work on the political [[Partition (politics)|partitioning]] of geographical space as a result of the interplay between movement flows and [[symbolic system]]s (iconographies) has been rediscovered after his death.

{{Refimprove|date=February 2009}}
A '''knotted cord''' was a primitive [[Surveying|surveyor]]'s tool for measuring distances. It is a length of cord with knots at regular intervals. They were eventually replaced by [[Chain (unit)|surveyor's chain]]s, which being made of metal were less prone to stretching and thus were more accurate and consistent.

Knotted cords were used by many ancient cultures. The Greek schoenus is referred to as a rope used to measure land. Ropes generally became cables and chains with [[Pythagoras]] making the Greek agros a chain of 10 stadia equal to a nautical mile c 540 BC. The Romans used a waxed cord for measuring distances. 

A knotted cord 12 lengths long (the units do not matter) closed into a loop can be used to lay out a [[right angle]] by forming the loop of cord into a 3–4–5 triangle. This could be used for laying out the corner of a field or a building foundation, for instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mastin|first1=Luke|title=Egyptian Mathematics|url=http://www.storyofmathematics.com/egyptian.html|publisher=The Story of Mathematics|accessdate=25 June 2016|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Egypt==
{{further|Mathematics and architecture#Ancient Egypt}}
Knotted cords were used by [[rope stretcher]]s, royal [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]]s who [[measurement|measure]]d out the sides of fields ([[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''3ht'').  The knotted cords (Egyptian ''ht'') were 100 royal [[cubit]]s in length, with a knot every ''hayt'' or 10 royal cubits. The rope stretchers stretched the rope in order to take the sag out it, as well as to keep the measures uniform.

Since land in [[ancient Egypt]] was measured using several different units, there would have been knotted cords with the knots spaced in each unit. Among these were the ''mh t3'' or land cubits, remen royal cubits, rods or ''ha3t'', generally the lengths in multiples of 100 units. The longest measured length listed in the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] is a circumference of about a Roman mile with a diameter of 9 khet.

Despite many popular claims, there is no reliable evidence that the 3-4-5 triangle, and by implication the [[Pythagoras' theorem]], [[Mathematics and architecture#Ancient Egypt|was used in Ancient Egypt]] to lay out right angles, such as for the [[pyramid]]s.&lt;ref name=Cooke2011&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooke |first=Roger L. |title=The History of Mathematics: A Brief Course |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wOGh7XPowAMC |edition=2nd |year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-118-03024-0 |pages=237–238}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Moritz Cantor]] first made the conjecture in 1882.&lt;ref name=Cooke2011/&gt; Right angles were certainly laid out accurately in Ancient Egypt;&lt;ref name=Cooke2011/&gt; their surveyors did use knotted cords for measurement;&lt;ref name=Cooke2011/&gt; [[Plutarch]] recorded in ''[[De Iside et Osiride|Isis and Osiris]]'' (around 100 AD) that the Egyptians admired the 3-4-5 triangle;&lt;ref name=Cooke2011/&gt;  and the [[Berlin Papyrus 6619]] from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (before 1700 BC) made statements that suggest knowledge of Pythagoras' theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gillings, Richard J. |title=Mathematics in the Time of the Pharaohs |publisher=Dover |date=1982 |page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooke2011/&gt; However, no Egyptian text before 300 BC actually mentions the use of the theorem to find the length of a triangle's sides, and the historian of mathematics Roger Cooke notes that there are simpler ways to construct a right angle. He guesses that the Ancient Egyptians probably did know the Pythagorean theorem, but concludes that "there is no evidence that they used it to construct right angles".&lt;ref name=Cooke2011/&gt;

'''Ko Nom Sao''' ({{lang-th|เกาะนมสาว}}, lit. ''female breast island'') are twin islands in  [[Phang Nga Bay]], and are part of the [[Amphoe Mueang Phang Nga|Ko Panyi]] (เกาะปันหยี) subdistrict ''([[tambon]])'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thailand.com/travel/beach/beach_phangnga_konomsao.htm Nom Sao Island (Ko Nom Sao)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322145630/http://www.thailand.com/travel/beach/beach_phangnga_konomsao.htm |date=2006-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phang Nga Province]], [[Thailand]].

==General==
Ko Nom Sao is a geographical feature consisting of two small islands of similar appearance located close to each other. One of them, Ko Nom Sao Yai (เกาะนมสาวใหญ่), is slightly larger than the other, but from certain angles the silhouette of these islands looks like a pair of roughly identical woman's breasts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebangkok.org/site.asp?id=1118 Ko Nom Sao Yai- Location]&lt;/ref&gt;

These islands are also known as '''Ko Ok Meri'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4663">The '''Kostrzyn–Slubice Special Economic Zone''' is in the centre of Europe, in western Poland, along the Polish–German border.

The zone's grounds are located in three western Polish provinces: [[Lubuskie]], [[Zachodniopomorskie]] and [[Wielkopolskie]], from [[Karlino]], [[Goleniów]] and [[Police, West Pomeranian Voivodeship|Police]] in the North, to [[Lubsko]] and [[Bytom Odrzański]] in the South. It uses the economic and touristic potential of almost the whole west of Poland. Within the zone one can find the biggest cities, industrial and commercial centres of the region: [[Poznań]], [[Szczecin]], [[Gorzów Wielkopolski]] and [[Zielona Góra]].

Created in 1997, the Kostrzyn–Slubice [[Special Economic Zone|SEZ]] is one of the fastest developing [[special economic zone]] in Poland, because of its high rate of [[tax exemption]], nowadays one of the highest in Poland, and its greenfields.

==Location==

The location of the Kostrzyn–Słubice Special Economic Zone, situated in the very heart of Europe, is right next to the German border and the Zone has passenger and commercial transportation links to the west.

The Zone is situated near main roads including the international E30 (A2), E65 (A3) and E28 motorways and near to the [[Paris]] – [[Berlin]] – [[Warsaw]] – [[Moscow]] international railway line. Some of the subzones, the ones located on the [[Odra (Poland)|Odra]] and [[Warta]] Rivers, have access to seaports in [[Szczecin]], [[Swinoujscie]] and [[Police, West Pomeranian Voivodeship|Police]], as well as the German ports of [[Berlin]] and [[Hamburg]]. All the subzones are close to airports with passenger and cargo facilities in the cities of [[Babimost]], [[Goleniów]] and the German capital, Berlin as well as being close to trade and manufacturing centres that are located in the largest cities of the surrounding regions: [[Gorzów Wlkp]], [[Zielona Góra]], [[Poznań]], [[Szczecin]] and [[Koszalin]].

==Investors==

The dominant types of manufactures of the different investors in the SEZ are chemicals, mechanical engineering, textiles, wood, paper, machinery, construction materials and grocery.

The zone has delivered over 140 permits to conduct a business activity, for example to Volkswagen, Faurecia, Funai Electrics, Arctic Paper, ICT, AB Foods, Podravka, Wendre, Teleskop, BEE, TPV and many more...

There is a strong growth in the economic cooperation with Germany. Other partners of the zone can also be found in France, Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, the UK, Belgium, Spain, the Scandinavian countries, Japan, India, the US and many more.

==Allowances==
Companies operating a business activity in the Kostrzyn–Słubice Special Economic Zone are entitled to regional support in receiving exemptions from the [[Corporate Income Tax|CIT tax]] for one of the following categories: investment costs or the creation of new work places.

In the subzones located in the Lubuskie Voivodeship, the companies deciding to conduct a business activity in the Kostrzyn–Słubice Special Economic Zone, benefit from CIT taxe exemption of their initial investment costs or of 2 years of employment costs, after receiving from the SEZ a permit to conduct a business activity, which amounts to 70% of exemption for small companies, medium-sized companies benefit from 60% of exemption and large companies benefit from 50% of exemption.

In the subzones located in the Wielkopolskie and Zachodniopomorskie Voivodeship, these allowances are decreased by 10%, this amounts to 60% for small companies, 50% for medium-sized companies and 40% for large companies.

[[File:Lappkärret från Lapps under snö.jpg|thumb|Frozen Lappkärret in November 2018]]
[[File:Lappkarret_2007.jpg|thumb|Lappkärret in 2007]]
'''Lappkärret''' is a small [[lake]] in [[Norra Djurgården]] in north-eastern [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], near [[Stockholm University]]. It is one of six lakes in [[Djurgården]], the others being: [[Lillsjön, Djurgården|Lillsjön]], [[Uggleviken]], [[Isbladskärret]], [[Laduviken]], and [[Spegeldammen]].

Through its location in the [[Royal National City Park]], it is considered as a lake of great recreational value, especially popular among [[ornithology|ornithologists]] and frequently used in classes at the [[University of Stockholm]] located nearby.  As the name implies, it used to be a [[marsh]] until construction works for the student apartments at [[Lappkärrsberget]] punctured a subsoil spring in the 1960s.  Today, the lake empties into the strait [[Lilla Värtan]] through a culvert and forms part of a proposed [[nature reserve]] in Norra Djurgården.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-2.1" /&gt;

== Catchment area ==
Most of the catchment area is composed of open fields and areas of [[spruce]] and [[deciduous forest]], with a single trafficked road passing west of the lake.  Next to a group of nearby [[allotment (gardening)|allotment-gardens]] is a [[4-H]] farmyard with horses and sheep.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-2.3"&gt;Vattenprogram, p 2.3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental influence ===
Most of the inflow is believed to come from subsoil water with some contribution from [[stormwater]] and snow-melting.  Local land usage produces small amounts of nutrients and no conduits guides surface water to the lake.  The lake is [[alkali]] and [[Saline water|saliferous]] with high levels of [[oxygen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[phosphate]], but low levels of inorganic [[nitrogen]].  Notwithstanding various levels of [[chlorophyll]], water transparency exceeds the depth of the lake and [[pH]] is reported as constant.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-2.3" /&gt;

== Flora and fauna ==
In the mid-1980s, isolated occurrences of [[Ceratophyllum|rigid hornwort]] had established in the lake, and, by the mid-1990s, abundant quantities of other [[aquatic plant]]s such as [[Lemna|ivy duckweed]] and the [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]] ''[[Riccia fluitans]]'', were reported along open edges of the lake.  During that decade, submarine vegetation covered the entire lake bed which greatly cleared up the lake.  In the mid-1980s, the only fauna reported was sparse occurrences of [[larva]]e and [[Chironomidae|non-biting midges]].  Within ten years, however, the fauna had evolved considerably, probably due to the rich vegetation, to include [[Oligochaeta]], [[gasteropod]]s, and [[Odonata|dragonfly]] larvae and today also the dragonfly species [[Aeshna|Aeshna osiliensis]], [[Sympecma fusca|common winter damselfly]], and several others.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-2.3-6"&gt;Vattenprogram, p 2.3-2.6&lt;/ref&gt;

The only fish in the lake is [[crucian carp]], probably introduced in the early 1980s.  Attempts have been made to reduce the population with various results.  In the mid-1970 a colony of [[black-headed gull]]s together with [[Slavonian grebe]], [[mallard]], [[little grebe]], and [[gadwall]].  The black-headed gull is a key species, offering protection to other species, and has now abandoned the lake which is, however, still considered as of great importance to bird life with several species still breeding there.  Several protected species of [[amphibian]]s can be seen by the lake, including [[common frog]], [[common toad]], [[moor frog]], and [[smooth newt]].&lt;ref name="vattenprogram-2.3-6" /&gt;

== Visiting ==
Both the lake and the surrounding national park is easily accessible by metro, bus, bicycle, or by foot.  The nearest metro station is [[Universitetet metro station|Universitetet]] and bus 50 stops nearby.

The prefix Z is used for the [[People's Republic of China]] with three exceptions:
* ZK is used for [[North Korea]]
* ZM is used for [[Mongolia]]
* ZZZZ is a special code which is used when no ICAO code exists for the airport.  It is often used by helicopters not operating at an aerodrome.

According to reports from the [[WIN/GIA|Worldwide Independent Network/Gallup International Association]]'s (WIN/GIA) four global polls: in 2005, 77% were a religious person and 4% were "convinced atheists" while in 2012, 23% were not a religious person and an additional 13% were "convinced atheists"&lt;ref name="GI2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redcresearch.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RED-C-press-release-Religion-and-Atheism-25-7-12.pdf |title=Global Index of Religion and Atheism |publisher=WIN/Gallup International |accessdate=13 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016062403/http://redcresearch.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RED-C-press-release-Religion-and-Atheism-25-7-12.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;; in 2015, 22% were not a religious person and an additional 11% were "convinced atheists"&lt;ref name=GallupInt2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Losing our Religion?

According to sociologist Phil Zuckerman, broad estimates of those who have an absence of belief in a God range from 500 to 750 million people worldwide.&lt;ref name="Zuckerman" /&gt; According to sociologists Ariela Keysar and Juhem Navarro-Rivera's review of numerous global studies on atheism, there are 450 to 500 million positive atheists and agnostics worldwide (7% of the world's population), with China having the most atheists in the world (200 million convinced atheists).&lt;ref name="Demographics Oxford Keysar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keysar|first1=Ariela|last2=Navarro-Rivera|first2=Juhem|editor1-last=Bullivant|editor1-first=Stephen|editor2-last=Ruse|editor2-first=Michael|title=The Oxford Handbook of Atheism|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199644659|chapter=36. A World of Atheism: Global Demographics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Each poll uses different questions and methods:-
* The [[WIN/GIA|Worldwide Independent Network/Gallup International Association]] (WIN/GIA) poll asked "Irrespective of whether you attend a place of worship or not, would you say that you are a religious person, not a religious person or a convinced atheist?" 
* [[Dentsu|Dentsu Communication Institute]] provides data for respondents who stated that they have "no religion".
* [[Phil Zuckerman]] uses only the number of people who describe themselves as atheists and agnostics.
The numbers come from different years, and might not be accurate for countries with governments that require or urge religion or secularism.

== Countries and regions ==
The [[WIN/GIA|WIN-Gallup International Association]] (WIN/GIA) poll results below are the totals for "not a religious person" and "a convinced atheist" combined. Researchers{{who|date=October 2018}} have advised caution with WIN/Gallup International figures since more extensive surveys which have used the same wording for decades and have bigger sample sizes, have consistently reached lower figures.&lt;ref name="Demographics Oxford Keysar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keysar|first1=Ariela|last2=Navarro-Rivera|first2=Juhem|editor1-last=Bullivant|editor1-first=Stephen|editor2-last=Ruse|editor2-first=Michael|title=The Oxford Handbook of Atheism|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199644659|chapter=36.

__NOTOC__
This is a list of places in Cape Verde having standing links to local communities in other countries. In many cases, these completely ceremonial associations, especially when formalized by the local governments, are called by the fallacious name of "town twinning" – though other terms, such as "sister city" and "partner town" are far more accurate. While most of the places included in this list are municipalities (one covers the two main islands, the four are a single municipality cover the whole main island, three are in the east including Sal, Boa Vista ad Maio and the other is Brava) and cities with similar links.  The regional level has no administration.

The list includes twin towns and sister cities of municipalities in Cape Verde linked by a sister-city agreement or friendship agreements.

Generally, a '''local administrative unit (LAU)''' is a low level [[administrative division]] of a country, ranked below a [[province]], [[region]], or [[State (administrative division)|state]].  Not all countries describe their locally governed areas this way, but it can be descriptively applied anywhere to refer to counties, municipalities, etc.

In the [[European Union]], LAUs are basic components of [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|Classification of Territorial Units for Statistics]] (NUTS) regions. For each [[Member of the European Union|EU member country]], two levels of Local Administrative Units (LAU) are defined: LAU 1 and LAU 2, which were previously called NUTS 4 and NUTS 5 respectively, until the NUTS regulation went into force in July 2003. For some countries, the LAU 1 level is not defined, and thus equivalent to the NUTS 3 level. A similar statistical system is defined for the [[Future enlargement of the European Union#Recognised candidates|candidate countries]] and members of the [[European Free Trade Association]].

==Current activities==
NANPS is dedicated to the Study, Conservation, Cultivation &amp; Restoration of North America's Native Flora.
NANPS's key purpose is to provide information and to inspire an appreciation of native plants with an aim to restoring healthy [[ecosystem]]s across the continent. To that end, NANPS currently:
* publishes a 16-page quarterly newsletter, ''The Blazing Star'' (ISSN 2291-8280)and an e-newsletter, ''The Local Scoop''
* provides a forum for people interested in learning more about native plants
* creates information sheets, booklets and brochures on a variety of related topics
* manages two [[nature reserve|conservation properties]] in [[Ontario]] and works to restore ecosystems
* provides a native [[seed swap|Seed Exchange]] available to NANPS members
* staffs information booths at a variety of public events
* offers guided excursions to natural areas
* operates Canada's largest native plant sale each May followed by a number of smaller sales from June to October. 
* maintains a searchable Native Plant Database, and a list of commercial growers who meet its ethical guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanps.org/index.php/plant-sources/38-guidelines-for-sources North American Native Plant Society - Guidelines for Commercial Growers]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* provides support to people adding native plants in [[urban area|urban]]/[[suburb]]an areas 
* creates and presents information to [[municipality|municipalities]] and interested groups on the benefits of native plants
* hosts a variety of seminars and workshops, culminating in an [[annual general meeting|Annual General Meeting]], plant sale, and awards presentation each October

==Logo==
The logo was designed in 1994 by Beth McEachen. It is a woodcut portraying three native plants representing three transcontinental, native families, viz: Araceae, Orchidaceae, Iridaceae.The examples shown are an [[arum]], a [[cypripedium]] and a [[Sisyrinchium|blue-eyed grass]].

==History==
[[File:Canadian Wildflower Society Logo.jpg|thumb|The logo of the Canadian Wildflower Society created by Pamela Meacher]]

NANPS was founded in 1985 by a small group of [[conservation movement|conservationists]] as the Canadian Wildflower Society.&lt;ref name="ref0"&gt;Wildflower Magazine, 1(1):5&lt;/ref&gt; (The name was later changed to the North American Native Plant Society to reflect a wider range of activities and broader membership.) In 1985, the Society began publishing their well-received native plant magazine, ''Wildflower'', under the editorship of James L. Hodgins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Schmid |first1=Rudolf|year=2000 |title=Wildflower: North America's Magazine of Wild Flora |journal= Taxon |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=611–612 |publisher=International Association for Plant Taxonomy |jstor=1224373 |doi=10.2307/1224373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 it also established a gardening Code of Ethics for its members. In 1986, it sponsored its first public annual native plant sale and filed a letters patent.&lt;ref name="patent"&gt;[http://www.nanps.org/images/3.%20Letters%20Patent%20By-laws%20and%20Supplementary%20Letters%20Patent.pdf  Letters Patent]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, it sponsored its first native plant propagation workshop, and established wildflower gardens tour in [[Guelph]] and [[Waterloo, Ontario]], Canada.

By 1993, it purchased a 50-acre [[Carolinian forest|Carolinian woodlot]] known as Shining Tree Woods near [[Cult (religious practice)|Cultus]], Ontario, to conserve the nationally rare native cucumber tree, ''[[Magnolia acuminata]]''.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;Wildflower Magazine, 10(1):11&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the Canadian Wildflowe Society co-published (with the Federation of Ontario Naturalists) the first booklet on the native plants of Carolinian Canada with conservation and horticultural advice.

The Canadian Wildflower Society changed its name to the North American Native Plant Society (NANPS) in 1998.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;Wildflower Magazine, 15(2):3&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, it purchased a five-hectare (13-acre) parcel of Zinkan Island Cove, a provincially designated ANSI (Area of Natural and Scientific Interest) on the [[Bruce Peninsula]] in Ontario. In 2000 the North American Native Plant Society decided to stop supporting the publication of  ''Wildflower'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;Wildflower 16(1) Winter 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced it with "''The Blazing Star'''.  ''Wildflower'' was published independently, but eventually ceased publication in 2004. In 2005, NANPS began conducting regular seminars around Ontario, and formed partnerships with  [[Toronto Botanical Garden]] and the City of Markham &lt;ref name="Markham"&gt;[http://www.markham.ca/wps/portal/Markham/AboutMarkham/EnvironmentalLeadership/EnvironmentalSustainabilityFund/!ut/p/c5/dY3LboMwFES_hR_gXmMeYWlhEmhttzxCwRvkRFEKKQmLKAh_fSNlnRnpbOZIAxqevZrHcDb34XY1f9CCDnv_a5ckotkUXukj5jlvAsULImMCP9AlT-iXFpWe2FPJ-CfDfM8CzETiYRS-dnwThtCBjt7efIdQQ4t-X43rnNuLLUdbUHlZ1vqQLpKnRHGzVnxnKyGXO_6KauysxDNR9VaQY0yabZEyFZl-Rgc-QA-HyV2Ok4vuhmKAoYcxIok9SqHloLLbdIJ5esyZbe2JOc4_Ul1_nA!!/dl3/d3/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/?pcid=721b5d80451328d68f878fbc660e546e&amp;digest=lSYnXIBLC7DXo35ZLckvog#NANPS City of Markham Markham Environmental Stability Fund].&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a NANPS member founded an e-newsletter, [http://thelocalscoop.org The Local Scoop].

In 2010, NANPS celebrated its 25th anniversary by publishing a special edition of ''The Blazing Star''. NANPS founder and Honorary President, James A French, published [http://www.nanps.org/index.php/resources/187-silver-memories-page Silver Memories], a personal recollection of the first 25 years.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;Silver Memories Pub by Bulletins Plus, Lakefield ON&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the Society  [https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/09/30/can_we_have_more_ontario_in_ontario_place_asks_fiorito.html campaigned for a native plant garden] as part of the renewal of Ontario Place.

PGIS combines [[Participatory Learning and Action]] (PLA) methods with [[geographic information system]]s (GIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iapad.org/publications/ppgis/ch01_overview_pp13-19.pdf |title=Overview: Mapping for Change: The emergence of a new practice |author1=Jon Corbett |author2=Giacomo Rambaldi |author3=Peter Kyem |author4=Dan Weiner |author5=Rachel Olson |author6=Julius Muchemi |author7=Mike McCall |author8=Robert Chambers |year=2006 |work=54:13-19 IIED, London, UK |publisher=iapad.org |accessdate=30 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081053/http://www.iapad.org/publications/ppgis/ch01_overview_pp13-19.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; PGIS combines a range of geo-spatial information management tools and methods such as sketch maps, [[participatory 3D modelling]] (P3DM), [[aerial photography]], [[satellite imagery]], and [[global positioning system]] (GPS) data to represent peoples' spatial knowledge in the forms of (virtual or physical) two- or three-dimensional maps used as interactive vehicles for spatial learning, discussion, information exchange, analysis, decision making and advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ejisdc.org/ojs/include/getdoc.php?id=246&amp;article=263&amp;mode=pdf |title=Participatory Spatial Information Management and Communication in Developing Countries |author=Rambaldi G., Kwaku Kyem A.

PGIS practice is geared towards community empowerment through measured, demand-driven, user-friendly and integrated applications of geo-spatial technologies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} GIS-based maps and spatial analysis become major conduits in the process. A good PGIS practice is embedded into long-lasting spatial decision-making processes, is flexible, adapts to different socio-cultural and bio-physical environments, depends on multidisciplinary facilitation and skills and builds essentially on visual language. The practice integrates several tools and methods whilst often relying on the combination of 'expert' skills with socially differentiated local knowledge. It promotes interactive participation of stakeholders in generating and managing spatial information and it uses information about specific landscapes to facilitate broadly-based decision making processes that support effective communication and community advocacy.

If appropriately utilized,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iapad.org/publications/ppgis/ch14_rambaldi_pp106-113.pdf |title=Practical ethics for PGIS practitioners, facilitators, technology intermediaries and researchers |author1=Gicomo Rambaldi |author2=Robert Chambers |author3=Mike McCall |author4=Jefferson Fox |year=2006 |work=PLA 54:106-113, IIED, London, UK |publisher=iapad.org |accessdate=30 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081038/http://www.iapad.org/publications/ppgis/ch14_rambaldi_pp106-113.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the practice could exert profound impacts on community empowerment, innovation and social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ejisdc.org/ojs/include/getdoc.php?id=247&amp;article=264&amp;mode=pdf |title=Participatory Mapping and Geographic Information Systems: Whose Map?

The '''Permanent European Conference for the Study of the Rural Landscape (PECSRL)''' is an international network of [[landscape]] researchers whose interest focus on the past, present and future of European landscapes, and serves as an international platform for new initiatives, meetings and publications about European rural landscapes. It meets every two years in a different European country for lectures, discussions, working groups and landscape excursions. It has several working groups that focus on actual problems in European landscape management and landscape research. The unifying concept of PECSRL is the past, present and future of European landscapes, relating to landscape research as well as landscape policy and landscape management.

==Objectives==
The objectives of PECSRL are:
* to facilitate personal contacts and information exchange between European landscape researchers;
* to improve interdisciplinary cooperation between landscape researchers from various scientific and human landscape disciplines;
* to improve cooperation between landscape researchers and landscape managers;
* to function as a platform for new initiatives in European landscape research and landscape management.

==History and scope==
The Permanent European Conference for the Study of the Rural Landscape is one of the most stable European networks of landscape researchers. It was established in 1957 at an inaugural conference held in Nancy, France. Initially, it consisted mainly of [[Historical geography|(historical)]] [[geography|geographers]], but during the last few decades its membership has diversified to include ecologists, social scientists, rural planners, landscape architects, historians, archaeologists, landscape managers, as well as other scholars and practitioners interested in European landscapes. Members undertake both fundamental and applied research on all aspects of the rural landscape or have a position in landscape management or heritage management. PECSRL covers Pan-Europe which means that it connects researchers from Northern, Eastern, Southern, Central and Western Europe. All together more than thirty European countries take part in PECSRL.

This attestation is quite late, however, and, according to [[Gerald J. Toomer|Gerald Toomer]], the translator of his ''[[Almagest]]'' into English, there is no reason to suppose he ever lived anywhere other than Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;G. J. Toomer, "Ptolemy (or Claudius Ptolemaeus). " [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Ptolemy.aspx Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography]. 2008.  Retrieved from Encyclopedia.com. 21 Jan, 2013. Concerning the possibility that Ptolemy might have been born in Ptolemais Hermiou, Toomer writes: "The statement by Theodore Meliteniotes that he was born in Ptolemais Hermiou (in Upper Egypt) could be correct, but it is late (ca. 1360) and unsupported."&lt;/ref&gt;  He died there around AD&amp;nbsp;168.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Claude Pecker (2001), ''Understanding the Heavens: Thirty Centuries of Astronomical Ideas from Ancient Thinking to Modern Cosmology'', p. 311, Springer, {{isbn|3-540-63198-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ptolemy wrote several scientific treatises, three of which were of importance to later [[Byzantium|Byzantine]], [[Islamic science|Islamic]] and [[Europe]]an science. The first is the astronomical treatise now known as the ''[[Almagest]]'', although it was originally entitled the ''Mathematical Treatise'' ({{lang|grc|Μαθηματικὴ Σύνταξις}}, ''Mathēmatikē Syntaxis'') and then known as the ''Great Treatise'' ({{lang|grc|Ἡ Μεγάλη Σύνταξις}}, ''Hē Megálē Syntaxis''). The second is the ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', which is a thorough discussion of the geographic knowledge of the [[Greco-Roman]] world. The third is the astrological treatise in which he attempted to adapt [[horoscopic astrology]] to the [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian]] [[natural philosophy]] of his day. This is sometimes known as the ''[[Apotelesmatika]]'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀποτελεσματικά}}) but more commonly known as the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'' from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ({{lang|grc|Τετράβιβλος}}) meaning "Four Books" or by the Latin ''[[Quadripartitum]]''.

==Background==
[[File:Ptolemy urania.jpg|thumb|Engraving of a crowned Ptolemy being guided by the muse Astronomy, from ''Margarita Philosophica'' by [[Gregor Reisch]], 1508. Although [[Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi|Abu Ma'shar]] believed Ptolemy to be one of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] who ruled Egypt after the conquest of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] the title ‘King Ptolemy’ is generally viewed as a mark of respect for Ptolemy's elevated standing in science.]]

''[[Ptolemy (name)|Ptolemaeus]]'' ({{lang|grc|Πτολεμαῖος}} ''Ptolemaios'') is a [[Ancient Greek personal names|Greek name]]. It occurs once in [[Greek mythology]], and is of Homeric form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0073%3Aentry%3D*ptolemai%3Dos Πτολεμαῖος], Georg Autenrieth, ''A Homeric Dictionary'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; It was common among the Macedonian upper class at the time of [[Alexander the Great]], and there were several of this name among Alexander's army, one of whom made himself [[pharaoh]] in 323&amp;nbsp;BC: [[Ptolemy I Soter]], the first king of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]]. All male pharaohs after him, until [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]] became a [[Roman province]] in 30 BC, were also [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]].

The name ''[[Claudia (gens)|Claudius]]'' is a Roman ''[[Roman naming conventions|nomen]]''; the fact that Ptolemy bore it indicates he lived under the Roman rule of Egypt with the privileges and political rights of [[Roman citizenship]]. It would have suited custom if the first of Ptolemy's family to become a citizen (whether he or an ancestor) took the ''nomen'' from a Roman called Claudius who was responsible for granting citizenship. If, as was common, this was the emperor, citizenship would have been granted between AD 41 and 68 (when [[Claudius]], and then [[Nero]], were Roman emperors). The astronomer would also have had a ''[[Roman naming conventions|praenomen]]'', which remains unknown.

The ninth-century [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Islamic astronomy|astronomer]] [[Abu Maʿshar]] presents Ptolemy as a member of Egypt's royal lineage, stating that the ten kings of Egypt who followed [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] were wise "and included Ptolemy the Wise, who composed the book of the ''Almagest''". Abu Maʿshar recorded a belief that a different member of this royal line "composed the book on astrology and attributed it to Ptolemy". We can evidence historical confusion on this point from Abu Maʿshar subsequent remark “It is sometimes said that the very learned man who wrote the book of astrology also wrote the book of the ''Almagest''. The correct answer is not known”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Abu Ma’shar, ''De magnis coniunctionibus'', ed.-transl. K. Yamamoto, Ch. Burnett, Leiden, 2000, 2 vols. (Arabic &amp; Latin text); 4.1.4.&lt;/ref&gt; There is little evidence on the subject of Ptolemy's ancestry, apart from what can be drawn from the details of his name (see above); however, modern scholars refer to Abu Ma’shar’s account as erroneous,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]] ‘Ptolemy’s Doctrine of the Terms and Its Reception’ by Stephan Heilen, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is no longer doubted that the astronomer who wrote the ''Almagest'' also wrote the ''Tetrabiblos'' as its astrological counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robbins Tet|Robbins, ''Ptolemy Tetrabiblos'']] ‘Introduction’; p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ptolemy wrote in [[Koine Greek]] and can be shown to have utilized [[Babylonian astronomical diaries|Babylonian astronomical data]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Asger Aaboe]], ''Episodes from the Early History of Astronomy'', New York: Springer, 2001, pp. 62–65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Jones, "The Adaptation of Babylonian Methods in Greek Numerical Astronomy," in ''The Scientific Enterprise in Antiquity and the Middle Ages'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Roman citizen, but was ethnically either a [[Greeks in Egypt|Greek]]&lt;ref name="britannica.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Katz 184"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ptolemy 2006"&gt;"Ptolemy."

Certainly, all of them wrote in Greek and were part of the Greek intellectual community of Alexandria. And most modern studies conclude that the Greek community coexisted [...] So should we assume that Ptolemy and Diophantus, Pappus and Hypatia were ethnically Greek, that their ancestors had come from Greece at some point in the past but had remained effectively isolated from the Egyptians? It is, of course, impossible to answer this question definitively. But research in papyri dating from the early centuries of the common era demonstrates that a significant amount of intermarriage took place between the Greek and Egyptian communities [...] And it is known that Greek marriage contracts increasingly came to resemble Egyptian ones. In addition, even from the founding of Alexandria, small numbers of Egyptians were admitted to the privileged classes in the city to fulfill numerous civic roles. Of course, it was essential in such cases for the Egyptians to become "Hellenized," to adopt Greek habits and the Greek language. Given that the Alexandrian mathematicians mentioned here were active several hundred years after the founding of the city, it would seem at least equally possible that they were ethnically Egyptian as that they remained ethnically Greek.

Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'' is the only surviving comprehensive ancient treatise on astronomy. [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomers]] had developed arithmetical techniques for calculating astronomical phenomena; Greek astronomers such as [[Hipparchus]] had produced [[geometric model]]s for calculating celestial motions. Ptolemy, however, claimed to have derived his geometrical models from selected astronomical observations by his predecessors spanning more than 800 years, though astronomers have for centuries suspected that his models' parameters were adopted independently of observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#mjpg|title=Dennis Rawlins|publisher=The International Journal of Scientific History|accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy presented his astronomical models in convenient tables, which could be used to compute the future or past position of the planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bernard R. |last=Goldstein |title=Saving the Phenomena: The Background to Ptolemy's Planetary Theory |journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy |volume=28 |issue=1 |year=1997 |pages=1–12 |doi=10.1177/002182869702800101 |bibcode=1997JHA....28....1G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Almagest'' also contains a [[star catalogue]], which is a version of a catalogue created by Hipparchus. Its list of forty-eight [[constellation]]s is ancestral to the modern system of constellations, but unlike the modern system they did not cover the whole sky (only the sky Hipparchus could see). Across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa in the Medieval period, it was the authoritative text on astronomy, with its author becoming an almost mythical figure, called Ptolemy, King of Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;S. C. McCluskey, ''Astronomies and Cultures in Early Medieval Europe'', Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr. 1998, pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Almagest'' was preserved, like most of extant Classical Greek science, in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] manuscripts (hence its familiar name). Because of its reputation, it was widely sought and was [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated twice into Latin in the 12th century]], once in Sicily and again in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Homer Haskins, ''Studies in the History of Mediaeval Science'', New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing, 1967, reprint of the Cambridge, Mass., 1927 edition&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy's model, like those of his predecessors, was [[geocentric]] and was almost universally accepted until the appearance of simpler [[heliocentric]] models during the [[scientific revolution]].

His ''Planetary Hypotheses'' went beyond the mathematical model of the ''Almagest'' to present a physical realization of the universe as a set of nested spheres,&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Duke, [http://people.scs.fsu.edu/~dduke/ptolemy.html Ptolemy's Cosmology]&lt;/ref&gt; in which he used the [[epicycle]]s of his planetary model to compute the dimensions of the universe. He estimated the Sun was at an average distance of 1,210 Earth radii, while the radius of the sphere of the fixed stars was 20,000 times the radius of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard R. Goldstein, ed., ''The Arabic Version of Ptolemy's'' Planetary Hypotheses, ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' 57, no. 4 (1967), pp. 9–12. Note that the Sun is actually on average at a distance of over 46,000 Earth radii from the Earth, so Ptolemy's estimate of 1210 was off by a factor of almost 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ptolemy presented a useful tool for astronomical calculations in his ''Handy Tables'', which tabulated all the data needed to compute the positions of the Sun, Moon and planets, the rising and setting of the stars, and [[eclipses]] of the Sun and Moon. Ptolemy's ''Handy Tables'' provided the model for later astronomical tables or ''[[Zij|zījes]]''. In the ''Phaseis'' (''Risings of the Fixed Stars''), Ptolemy gave a ''parapegma'', a star [[calendar]] or [[almanac]], based on the appearances and disappearances of stars over the course of the solar year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=if9ZDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;dq=ptolemy+phaseis+parapegma&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QXyQ0sw0Kf&amp;sig=agU6A1MGcKDxH3pG3gNCd2TEja8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx5OrS-t_bAhUECawKHXd7CyoQ6AEIQzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=ptolemy%2520phaseis%2520parapegma&amp;f=false |title=Geminos's Introduction to the Phenomena: A Translation and Study of a Hellenistic Survey of Astronomy |last=Evans |first=James |last2=Berggren |first2=J.

==The ''Geography''==
{{Main article|Geography (Ptolemy)}}
[[File:La Cosmographie de Claude Ptolemée.djvu|page=9|thumb|right|''Geography'' by Ptolemy, Latin manuscript of the early 15th century]]
Ptolemy's other main work is his ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' (also called the ''Geographia''), a compilation of [[geographical coordinates]] of the part of the world known to the [[Roman Empire]] during his time. He relied somewhat on the work of an earlier geographer, [[Marinos of Tyre]], and on [[gazetteer]]s of the Roman and ancient [[History of Iran|Persian Empire]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} He also acknowledged ancient astronomer [[Hipparchus]] for having provided the elevation of the [[celestial_pole#Finding_the_north_celestial_pole|north celestial pole]]&lt;ref&gt;The north celestial pole is the point in the sky lying at the common centre of the circles which the stars appear to people in the northern hemisphere to trace out during the course of a [[sidereal time|sidereal day]].&lt;/ref&gt; for a few cities.&lt;ref&gt;Shcheglov D.A. (2002–2007): [https://nw.academia.edu/DmitryShcheglov/Papers/142876/Hipparchus_Table_of_Climata_and_Ptolemys_Geography "Hipparchus’ Table of Climata and Ptolemy’s Geography"], Orbis Terrarum 9 (2003–2007), 177–180.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of the ''[[Geography]]'' is a discussion of the data and of the methods he used. As with the model of the solar system in the ''Almagest'', Ptolemy put all this information into a grand scheme. Following Marinos, he assigned [[coordinate]]s to all the places and geographic features he knew, in a [[Grid (spatial index)|grid]] that spanned the globe. [[Latitude]] was measured from the [[equator]], as it is today, but Ptolemy preferred&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dioi.org/diller8/diller8.htm|title=DIO|website=www.dioi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; to express it as [[climata|''climata'', the length of the longest day]] rather than [[degree (angle)|degrees of arc]]: the length of the [[midsummer]] day increases from 12h to 24h as one goes from the equator to the [[polar circle]]. In books 2 through 7, he used degrees and put the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] of 0 [[longitude]] at the most western land he knew, the "[[Fortunate Isles|Blessed Islands]]", often identified as the [[Canary Islands]], as suggested by the location of the six dots labelled the "FORTUNATA" islands near the left extreme of the blue sea of Ptolemy's map here reproduced.
[[File:PtolemyWorldMap.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|A 15th-century manuscript copy of the [[Ptolemy world map]], reconstituted from Ptolemy's ''Geography'' (circa AD 150), indicating the countries of "[[Seres|Serica]]" and "[[Sinae]]" ([[Sino-Roman relations|China]]) at the extreme east, beyond the island of "Taprobane" ([[Sri Lanka]], oversized) and the "[[Golden Chersonese|Aurea Chersonesus]]" ([[Malay Peninsula]]).]]
[[File:Prima Europe tabula.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Prima Europe tabula. A 15th century copy of Ptolemy's map of Britain and Ireland.]]

Ptolemy also devised and provided instructions on how to create maps both of the whole inhabited world (''[[oikoumenè]]'') and of the Roman provinces. In the second part of the ''Geography'', he provided the necessary [[topographic]] lists, and captions for the maps. His ''oikoumenè'' spanned 180 degrees of longitude from the Blessed Islands in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the middle of [[China]], and about 80 degrees of latitude from [[Shetland]] to anti-Meroe (east coast of [[Africa]]); Ptolemy was well aware that he knew about only a quarter of the globe, and an erroneous extension of China southward suggests his sources did not reach all the way to the Pacific Ocean.

The maps in surviving manuscripts of Ptolemy's ''Geography'', however, only date from about 1300, after the text was rediscovered by [[Maximus Planudes]]. It seems likely that the topographical tables in books 2–7 are cumulative texts – texts which were altered and added to as new knowledge became available in the centuries after Ptolemy.&lt;ref&gt;Bagrow 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that information contained in different parts of the Geography is likely to be of different dates.

[[File:Claudius Ptolemy- The World.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A printed map from the 15th century depicting Ptolemy's description of the ''[[Ecumene]]'', (1482, Johannes Schnitzer, engraver).]]
[[Maps]] based on scientific principles had been made since the time of [[Eratosthenes]], in the 3rd century BC, but Ptolemy improved [[map projection]]s. It is known from a speech by [[Eumenius]] that a world map, an ''orbis pictus'', doubtless based on the ''Geography'', was on display in a school in [[Autun|Augustodunum]], [[Gaul]] in the third century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard J. A. |last=Talbert |chapter=Urbs Roma to Orbis Romanus |editor-last=Talbert |title=Ancient Perspectives: Maps and Their Places in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome |location=Chicago |publisher= |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-226-78940-8 |pages=170–72 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=srTbAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century, Ptolemy's ''Geography'' began to be printed with engraved maps; the earliest printed edition with engraved maps was produced in Bologna in 1477, followed quickly by a Roman edition in 1478 (Campbell, 1987). An edition printed at [[Ulm]] in 1482, including woodcut maps, was the first one printed north of the [[Alps]]. The maps look distorted when compared to modern maps, because Ptolemy's data were inaccurate. One reason is that Ptolemy estimated the size of the Earth as too small: while [[Eratosthenes]] found 700 ''stadia'' for a great circle degree on the globe, Ptolemy uses 500 ''stadia'' in the ''Geography''. It is highly probable that these were the same ''stadion'', since Ptolemy switched from the former scale to the latter between the ''Syntaxis'' and the ''Geography'', and severely readjusted longitude degrees accordingly. See also [[Ancient Greek units of measurement]] and [[History of geodesy]].

Because Ptolemy derived many of his key latitudes from crude longest day values, his latitudes are erroneous on average by roughly a degree (2 degrees for Byzantium, 4 degrees for Carthage), though capable ancient astronomers knew their latitudes to more like a minute. (Ptolemy's own latitude was in error by 14'.) He agreed (''Geography'' 1.4) that longitude was best determined by simultaneous observation of lunar eclipses, yet he was so out of touch with the scientists of his day that he knew of no such data more recent than 500 years before (Arbela eclipse). When switching from 700 stadia per degree to 500, he (or Marinos) expanded longitude differences between cities accordingly (a point first realized by P. Gosselin in 1790), resulting in serious over-stretching of the Earth's east-west scale in degrees, though not distance. Achieving highly precise longitude remained a problem in geography until the application of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s Jovian moon method in the 18th century. It must be added that his original topographic list cannot be reconstructed: the long tables with numbers were transmitted to posterity through copies containing many scribal errors, and people have always been adding or improving the topographic data: this is a testimony to the persistent popularity of this influential work in the [[history of cartography]].

==Astrology==
{{Main article|Tetrabiblos}}
[[File:Ptolemy 16century.jpg|thumb|200px|The mathematician Claudius Ptolemy 'the Alexandrian', as depicted by a 16th-century engraving&lt;ref name="portraits" /&gt;]]

Ptolemy has been referred to as “a pro-astrological authority of the highest magnitude”.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]] ‘The Use and Abuse of Ptolemy’s Tetrabiblos in Renaissance and Early Modern Europe’ by H. Darrel Rutkin, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; His astrological treatise, a work in four parts, is known by the Greek term ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'', or the Latin equivalent ''Quadripartitum'': ‘Four Books’. Ptolemy's own title is unknown, but may have been the term found in some Greek manuscripts: ''Apotelesmatika'', roughly meaning 'Astrological Outcomes,' 'Effects' or ‘Prognostics’.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robbins_Tet|Robbins, ''Ptolemy Tetrabiblos'']], 'Introduction' p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Jones-2010|Jones (2010)]] p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a source of reference, the ''Tetrabiblos'' is said to have "enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robbins_Tet|Robbins, ''Ptolemy Tetrabiblos'']], 'Introduction' p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first translated from Arabic into Latin by [[Plato of Tivoli]] (Tiburtinus) in 1138, while he was in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;FA Robbins, 1940; Thorndike 1923&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tetrabiblos'' is an extensive and continually reprinted treatise on the ancient principles of [[horoscopic astrology]]. That it did not quite attain the unrivaled status of the ''[[Almagest]]'' was, perhaps, because it did not cover some popular areas of the subject, particularly [[electional astrology]] (interpreting astrological charts for a particular moment to determine the outcome of a course of action to be initiated at that time), and [[medical astrology]], which were later adoptions.

The great popularity that the ''Tetrabiblos'' did possess might be attributed to its nature as an exposition of the art of astrology, and as a compendium of astrological lore, rather than as a manual. It speaks in general terms, avoiding illustrations and details of practice. Ptolemy was concerned to defend astrology by defining its limits, [[Ephemeris|compiling astronomical data]] that he believed was reliable and dismissing practices (such as considering the [[Numerology|numerological]] significance of names) that he believed to be without sound basis.

Much of the content of the ''Tetrabiblos'' was collected from earlier sources; Ptolemy's achievement was to order his material in a systematic way, showing how the subject could, in his view, be rationalized. It is, indeed, presented as the second part of the study of astronomy of which the ''Almagest'' was the first, concerned with the influences of the celestial bodies in the [[sublunary sphere]]. Thus explanations of a sort are provided for the astrological effects of the [[planets]], based upon their combined effects of heating, cooling, moistening, and drying.

Ptolemy's astrological outlook was quite practical: he thought that astrology was like [[medicine]], that is ''conjectural'', because of the many variable factors to be taken into account: the [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[country]], and [[nurture|upbringing]] of a person affects an individual's personality as much as, if not more than, the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets at the precise moment of their birth, so Ptolemy saw astrology as something to be used in life but in no way relied on entirely.

A collection of one hundred [[aphorism]]s about astrology called the ''[[Centiloquium]]'', ascribed to Ptolemy, was widely reproduced and commented on by Arabic, Latin and Hebrew scholars, and often bound together in medieval manuscripts after the ''Tetrabiblos'' as a kind of summation. It is now believed to be a much later [[pseudepigraph]]ical composition. The identity and date of the actual author of the work, referred to now as [[Pseudo-Ptolemy]], remains the subject of conjecture.{{dubious|date=March 2018}}

==Music==
Ptolemy also wrote an influential work, ''Harmonics'', on [[music theory]] and the mathematics of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzcrDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=ptolemy+harmonics+%2522music+theory%2522+mathematics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx1eiJ3abcAhUJDKwKHeS_CcIQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Music, Experiment and Mathematics in England, 1653–1705 |last=Wardhaugh |first=Benjamin |date=2017-07-05 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781351557085 |location=London and New York| page=7 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After criticizing the approaches of his predecessors, Ptolemy argued for basing musical intervals on mathematical ratios (in contrast to the followers of [[Aristoxenus]] and in agreement with the followers of [[Pythagoras]]), backed up by empirical observation (in contrast to the overly theoretical approach of the [[Pythagoreans]]). Ptolemy wrote about how musical notes could be translated into mathematical equations and vice versa in ''Harmonics''. This is called Pythagorean tuning because it was first discovered by Pythagoras. However, Pythagoras believed that the mathematics of music should be based on the specific ratio of 3:2, whereas Ptolemy merely believed that it should just generally involve [[tetrachord]]s and [[octave]]s. He presented his own divisions of the tetrachord and the octave, which he derived with the help of a [[monochord]]. His ''Harmonics'' never had the influence of his ''Almagest'' or ''Planetary Hypotheses'', but a part of it (Book III) did encourage [[Kepler]] in his own musings on the harmony of the world (Kepler, ''Harmonice Mundi'', Appendix to Book V).&lt;ref&gt;Hetherington, Norriss S. [https://books.google.nl/books?id=EP9QAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA527&amp;dq=ptolemy+wrote+harmonics+music+theory+mathematics&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwADgKahUKEwi-wYXtlfPIAhVDYQ4KHaaMB_Y#v=onepage&amp;q=ptolemy%20wrote%20harmonics%20music%20theory%20mathematics&amp;f=false ''Encyclopedia of Cosmology (Routledge Revivals): Historical, Philosophical, and Scientific Foundations of Modern Cosmology''] Routledge, 8 apr. 2014 {{isbn|978-1317677666}} p 527&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy's astronomical interests also appeared in a discussion of the "[[Musica universalis|music of the spheres]]". See: [[Ptolemy's intense diatonic scale]].

==Optics==
{{main|Optics (Ptolemy)}}
His ''Optics'' is a work that survives only in a poor Arabic translation and in about twenty manuscripts of a Latin version of the Arabic, which was translated by [[Eugene of Palermo]] (c. 1154). In it, Ptolemy writes about properties of [[light]], including [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]], and [[colour]]. The work is a significant part of the early [[history of optics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Smith
|first=A. Mark
|date=1996

|publisher=The American Philosophical Society
|isbn=0-87169-862-5
|accessdate=27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and influenced the more famous 11th-century ''[[Book of Optics]]'' by [[Alhazen]] (Ibn al-Haytham). It contains the earliest surviving table of refraction from air to water, for which the values (with the exception of the 60° angle of incidence), although historically praised as experimentally derived, appear to have been obtained from an arithmetic progression.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Benjamin Boyer]], ''The Rainbow: From Myth to Mathematics'' (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is also important for the early history of perception. Ptolemy combined the mathematical, philosophical and physiological traditions. He held an extramission-intromission theory of vision: the rays (or flux) from the eye formed a cone, the vertex being within the eye, and the base defining the visual field. The rays were sensitive, and conveyed information back to the observer’s intellect about the distance and orientation of surfaces. Size and shape were determined by the visual angle subtended at the eye combined with perceived distance and orientation. This was one of the early statements of size-distance invariance as a cause of perceptual size and shape constancy, a view supported by the Stoics.&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Ross and C. Plug, "The History of Size Constancy and Size Illusions", in V. Walsh &amp; J. Kulikowski (eds.) ''Perceptual Constancy: Why Things Look as They Do''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp. 499–528.&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy offered explanations for many phenomena concerning illumination and colour, size, shape, movement and binocular vision. He also divided illusions into those caused by physical or optical factors and those caused by judgmental factors. He offered an obscure explanation of the sun or [[moon illusion]] (the enlarged apparent size on the horizon) based on the difficulty of looking upwards.&lt;ref&gt;H. E. Ross and G. M. Ross, "Did Ptolemy Understand the Moon Illusion?", ''Perception'' 5 (1976): 377–395.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. I. Sabra, "Psychology Versus Mathematics: Ptolemy and Alhazen on the Moon Illusion", in E. Grant &amp; J. E. Murdoch (eds.) ''Mathematics and Its Application to Science and Natural Philosophy in the Middle Ages''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987, pp. 217–247.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soborom Hot Springs''' is a [[geothermal]] field located close to the northwestern rim of [[Tarso Voon|Tarso Voôn]] volcano in [[Chad]]. It is situated on the eastern flank of [[Emi Koussi]] at an altitude of 850 meters (20°55'0"N, 17°10'60"E).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.getamap.net/cartes/chad/borkou-ennedi-tibesti/_soborom/|title=Soborom Carte (Plan), Photos et la meteo - (Tchad): printemps (s) - Latitude:20.9167 and Longitude:17.1833|website=fr.getamap.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The springs are considered to have healing powers - the word Soborom purportedly means "water which heals" in one of the local languages. It is common for the [[Toubou people]] as well as others from this part of [[Sahara]] to visit this natural resort for a few days to heal diseases such as [[dermatitis]] and [[rheumatism]].&lt;ref name="readersnatural"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural Wonders of the World|publisher=Reader's Digest Association, Inc|year=1980|isbn=0-89577-087-3|editor-last=Scheffel|editor-first=Richard L.|location=United States of America|pages=350|quote=|editor-last2=Wernet|editor-first2=Susan J.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They bathe in one of the less hot pools which has a temperature of about 42°C.

The '''Sorrento Peninsula''' or '''Sorrentine Peninsula''' is a [[peninsula]] located in southern Italy that separates the [[Gulf of Naples]] to the north from the [[Gulf of Salerno]] to the south.

==Geography==

===Overview===
The peninsula is named after its main town, [[Sorrento]], which is located on the north (Gulf of Naples) coast. The [[Amalfi Coast]] is located on the southern side. The [[Lattari Mountains]] form the geographical backbone of the peninsula. The island of [[Capri]] lies off the western tip of the peninsula in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]. The whole area is an important tourist destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sorrentocoastlimo.com/day-trips-from-sorrento/| title=day trips from sorrento }} Tuesday, 17 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Municipalities===
The peninsula lies on the territory of the [[province of Naples]] with 9 comunes and the [[province of Salerno]] with 12 comunes.

The '''street system of Denver, Colorado''' reflects the early history and original geography and present day layout of the [[Denver|City and County of Denver]], [[Colorado]]. 

The oldest part of Denver, now the neighborhoods of [[Auraria Campus]], [[LoDo]], much of downtown, and [[Five Points (Denver)|Five Points]], is laid out on a [[grid plan]] that is oriented diagonal to the four [[cardinal directions]]. The rest of the city, including the eastern part of downtown, is laid out primarily on a grid oriented to the cardinal directions. In this larger grid, from east to west, there are generally 16 [[city block]]s per mile, except between Zuni Street and Lowell Boulevard in west Denver. From north to south, there are typically eight blocks per mile, although there are many areas with more blocks per mile. [[Address (geography)|Addresses]] follow a decimal system, with addresses advancing by one hundred at each cross street.

Some major [[arterial road]]s, such as Leetsdale Drive and South Santa Fe Drive, fall outside this pattern and run diagonally through the city. These roads generally originated as county roads or other major routes used by early settlers. The names of many of these roads change as they wind through the grid, following the name officially designated for a road in that area. [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate highways]] do not follow the grid plan.

==Street grid listing==
{{main|Street grid (Denver–Aurora Metropolitan Area)}}

==History==
[[File:NIE 1905 Denver.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of Denver in 1898, showing the two different grid alignments.]]
Modern Denver has two grids. One is laid out diagonal with respect to the four [[cardinal direction]]s and is found on [[Auraria Campus]], downtown, and northeast of downtown into the Five Points neighborhood.&lt;ref name="p5"&gt;Goodstein, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the rest of the city's streets, as well as many of those of the surrounding suburbs, are laid out in an east–west/north–south pattern.&lt;ref name="p7"&gt;Goodstein, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; These two grids result from early land development in the area.

===The diagonal grid===
The first streets in Denver were [[plat]]ted in what was then the town of [[Auraria, Denver, Colorado|Auraria]], founded in 1858; it was the first permanent settlement of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] in Colorado, which was then part of the [[Kansas Territory]]. The streets were laid out parallel to the south bank of [[Cherry Creek (Colorado)|Cherry Creek]] near its confluence with the [[South Platte River]], with perpendicular cross streets. Because they followed the path of a natural body of water, these streets were diagonal to the four cardinal directions.&lt;ref name="p5"/&gt;

The town of St. Charles, later named Denver, was founded later in 1858, located across Cherry Creek from Auraria. Its founder, [[General William Larimer]], and [[William McGaa]], an early settler, collaborated to plot and name the streets of the new town. These were laid out parallel not to Cherry Creek, but to the South Platte River with perpendicular cross streets. Because Cherry Creek and the South Platte meet at nearly a 90° angle, the cross streets of Auraria were nearly parallel to the streets of Denver and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Goodstein, pp. 7−8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The east–west/north–south grid===
In 1864, developer [[Henry C. Brown]] laid out the first streets in Denver parallel to the cardinal directions, with streets running directly north–south and east–west. His grid was located directly east of Denver (which had absorbed Auraria in 1860), from what is now Broadway to the alley between Grant and Logan Streets and from 11th to 20th Avenues. This layout followed federal land policy.&lt;ref name="p7"/&gt;

About the same time, territorial governor [[John Evans (governor)|John Evans]] laid out streets on an east–west/north–south grid south of the original Denver plat, southeast of the modern intersection between Broadway and [[Colfax Avenue]].&lt;ref name="p7"/&gt;

===Early street designations===
Denver grew rapidly in its first thirty years. Areas were developed with little direction from the government of the young city, with each developer platting streets largely independently of others. As a result, where original developments meet, many streets do not line up with one another; for example, there are many displacements on East [[Colfax Avenue]] in streets running north and south. In fact, while there are 40 [[city block]]s between Broadway and Colorado Boulevard south of East Colfax Avenue, there are only 39 blocks in the same stretch on the north side.&lt;ref name="p8"&gt;Goodstein, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Street names reflected this [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] [[emergence]], and [[street name]]s were not coordinated from development to development, even for along the same north-south or east-west line.  Some names were used more than once, by different streets across various Denver neighborhoods and surrounding towns. There was no universal system for the use of terms like "street", "avenue", etc. Later, these terms were defined such that "street" designated roads running north and south and aligned with the 100s of the numbering system, with "court" for intermediate (non-100s) north-south roads and "way" for roads which start north-south but curve to intersect with another north-south road; "avenue", "place", and "drive" (respectively) are the corresponding terms for roads running east and west. Major arterials in both directions, however, are often called "boulevards", and "road" and "parkway" also make appearances.&lt;ref name="p8"/&gt;

Attempts to rationalize the street system began early. In 1873, the diagonal streets of Auraria and original Denver were renamed, with the zero point at the original southwest corner of Denver, the intersection of West Colfax Avenue and Zuni Street, near the South Platte River. According to this system, still in place in modern Denver, streets running from northwest to southeast are designated as heading north from the zero point and are numbered, while streets running from northeast to southwest are designated as heading east from the zero point and are named.&lt;ref name="p8"/&gt; A notable exception came when 23rd Street, which had been treated like any other numbered streets in downtown Denver, was renamed Park Avenue West and designated as running west rather than north, in order to match up with its eastern continuation, Park Avenue, which extends diagonally south-east into the otherwise compass-oriented grid east of Broadway.&lt;ref name="p39"&gt;Goodstein, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The east-west avenues, originally named, were first numbered in 1871, with modern East 35th Avenue designated First Avenue; however, this system was abandoned in 1886, when the city passed an ordinance linking avenue numbers to the street numbers of the diagonal grid. Where a numbered street met an avenue at Broadway, the avenue was given the number of the connecting street; thus 16th Street provided the number for 16th Avenue, and so forth.&lt;ref name="p10"&gt;Goodstein, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; An exception was Colfax Avenue, which meets 15th Street and is the equivalent of 15th Avenue, but retained its original name.&lt;ref name="p9"&gt;Goodstein, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The avenues were then numbered consecutively to the north, even where they began to deviate from the diagonal grid, so that 27th Street meets 26th Avenue in the [[Five Points (Denver)|Five Points]] intersection. They are also extrapolated north of the grid, beyond Denver's main northern border at 52nd Avenue to 168th Avenue at the border between Adams and Weld Counties. Avenue numbers are also extrapolated south from Colfax to First Avenue. Ellsworth Ave is the 00 point, and south of here avenues are named.&lt;ref name="p10"/&gt;

===Development of the modern decimal grid===
In 1887, a decimal grid was imposed. Instead of counting addresses up arbitrarily along a direction, this system specified a "hundred block" for each street. For example, First Street is the 100 block, with all addresses on any named street between First and Second Streets ascending from 100 (nearest First Street) to 199 (nearest Second Street). Named streets also follow this pattern, with Cheyenne Place designated the 100 block and numbers increasing toward the northwest. In the diagonal grid, even-numbered addresses are on the west (i.e. southwest) sides of numbered streets and the east (i.e. northeast) side of named streets.&lt;ref name="p11"&gt;Goodstein, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the rest of the grid, even numbers are on the east sides of streets and the south sides of avenues, while odd numbers are on the west sides of streets and north sides of avenues. This decimal system forms a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] whose axes are Broadway (north−south) and Ellsworth Avenue (east−west). For numbered avenues, the hundred block corresponds to the number of the avenue (e.g. 17th Avenue designates the 1700 block North). Avenues south of Ellsworth are named, as are all streets running north−south, and have hundred-block numbers extending from the axes. Strictly speaking, only the portions of streets south of Ellsworth need be designated "South" and the portions of avenues west of Broadway need be designated "West." Without a directional designation, streets are automatically assumed to be north of Ellsworth and avenues assumed to be east of Broadway, although it is common to refer to these avenues are "East".&lt;ref name="p11"/&gt;

===Application of consistent names===
[[Street name]]s were originally applied with no consistency; the same road designation might have as many as ten different names in different parts of the city, and many different roads might share the same name. This inconsistency created significant problems for the [[Denver Union Water Company]], which had difficulties both providing service and billing because of the chaotic street system. A [[bookkeeping|bookkeeper]], Howard Maloney, collaborated with the city to impose an orderly set of names to the roads, with each unique name designating exactly one road. In most areas, these streets are named in alphabetical order. The first set of changes took place in 1897, with further renaming in 1904. In 1906, many adjacent communities adopted Denver's system.&lt;ref&gt;Goodstein, pp. 11−12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Street classification==
The City and County of Denver's [[zoning]] board classifies streets into three types based on functionality.  ''[[Arterial road|Arterials]]'' are major 
routes, arranged in a network to provide mobility around the city. ''[[Collector road|Collector streets]]'' move traffic from arterials into neighborhoods and business districts. All other streets are ''[[local road|local streets]]'', which provide access to individual lots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite url |url=http://www.denvergov.org/LUTP/FunctionalClassification/tabid/390275/Default.aspx |title=Street Classifications/Characteristics |publisher=City and County of Denver |accessdate=December 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523220713/http://www.denvergov.org/LUTP/FunctionalClassification/tabid/390275/Default.aspx |archivedate=May 23, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names of major Denver streets==
*'''Alameda Avenue''' is a major east-west thoroughfare at 300 south. It travels from near [[Red Rocks Park]] to [[Buckley Air Force Base]] in [[Aurora, Colorado|Aurora]]. The road disappears briefly in the [[Cherry Creek, Denver|Cherry Creek]] neighborhood as it is displaced by the namesake [[Cherry Creek, Colorado|Cherry Creek]]. On the other side of the creek, Alameda continues eastward toward Aurora. It is sometimes known as Alameda Parkway.
*'''Brighton Boulevard''' is named for [[Brighton, Colorado|Brighton]], Colorado, and was the original route to that city, the [[Adams County, Colorado|Adams County]] [[county seat|seat]]. It roughly follows the [[South Platte River]]'s path and the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] tracks. It is also called '''Brighton Road''' in sections, and in [[Commerce City, Colorado|Commerce City]], north of Denver, there are sections in which Brighton Boulevard and Brighton Road both run separately, parallel to each other. 
*'''Broadway''' was named by developer Henry C. Brown after [[New York City]]'s [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. It is the demarcation between east and west avenues in Denver. The intersection of Broadway and Ellsworth Avenue is the center of Denver's decimal-based address system. All points in every direction count up from the intersection. Broadway continues uninterrupted throughout the city, for approximately 20 miles, with {{convert|3.2|mi|km}} from I-25 to 20th Avenue carrying only southbound traffic. 
*'''Bruce Randolph Avenue''' is equivalent to East 34th Avenue between Downing Street and Dahlia Street. It honors "Daddy" Bruce Randolph, a local community figure in the 1970s and 1980s.
*'''[[Colfax Avenue]]''', equivalent to 15th Avenue, was named for [[Indiana]] Representative and [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|29th Speaker of the House]] [[Schuyler Colfax]] in an attempt to win his support for Colorado's statehood. The name first appeared on maps in 1868.
*'''Colorado Boulevard''' is a major north-south thoroughfare at 4000 East. It also carries a significant portion of [[Colorado State Highway 2|CO Highway 2]].
*'''Ellsworth Avenue''', while not a major thoroughfare anywhere in the city, is the demarcation between north and south streets. All avenues north of Ellsworth are numbered, and south of it are named.
*'''East Hale Parkway''' runs through the neighborhood of Hale and north of Rose Medical Center. It runs from Albion Street to Grape Street, and from 8th Avenue to 12th Avenue. 
*'''Evans''' is named after the famous Mount Evans, which appears to be at the end of the street, which runs East to West and crosses over the highway. 
*'''Federal Boulevard''' is a major north-south thoroughfare which runs as a crosstown road through Denver.  It travels from W Bowles Ave in [[Littleton, Colorado]] to W 120th Ave in [[Broomfield, Colorado]].
*'''Hampden Avenue''' is a major east-west thoroughfare at 3500 South. Most of the route also carries [[US Route 285|US 285]] through the southwestern suburbs, where it is a limited access highway. It then becomes a 4 to 6 lane avenue until reaching Havana Street in Aurora, where it is interrupted by the Cherry Creek Reservoir. Hampden then continues at [[Colorado State Highway 83|Parker Road/CO 83]] just east of the reservoir.
*'''Lincoln Street''' runs parallel to Broadway, one block to the east. For {{convert|3.2|mi|km}} between I-25 and 20th Avenue, Broadway carries only southbound traffic and Lincoln becomes a major thoroughfare, carrying four lanes of northbound traffic.  It is distinct from '''Lincoln Avenue''', a mostly east-west thoroughfare in the far south suburb of [[Highlands Ranch]].
*'''Martin Luther King Boulevard''' is equivalent to East 32nd Avenue from Downing Street to Havana Street. It runs through several largely [[African American]] neighborhoods, including [[Clayton, Denver, Colorado|Clayton]] and [[Park Hill, Denver, Colorado|Northeast Park Hill]], and received this name in 1980. An eastward extension to Peoria Street is planned, with construction anticipated to be complete in 2019.&lt;ref name="Denver MLK Extension"&gt;{{cite web |title=Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd. Extension Project |url=http://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/denver-department-of-public-works/projects/current/mlk-boulevard-extension.html |website=Department of Public Works |publisher=Denver: The Mile High City |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Montview Boulevard''' is the equivalent of East 20th Avenue east of Colorado Boulevard and was named for Denver's view of the [[Rocky Mountains]].
*'''Morrison Road''' is named for the town of [[Morrison, Colorado|Morrison]], Colorado. It originally began at West Colfax Avenue, and exists for only brief portions near the Platte River and between Knox Court and Sheridan Boulevard in west Denver before reappearing west of Wadsworth Boulevard on its journey to Morrison.
*'''Park Avenue/Park Avenue West''' is the equivalent of 23rd Street in downtown Denver. It runs from I-25 south-east through downtown. It maintains its diagonal heading through Uptown and the classic (N-S-E-W) grid, coming to an end at the three-way intersection with Colfax and Franklin.
*'''Santa Fe Drive''' follows the path of an old trail from Denver to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[New Mexico]]. This was called the Santa Fe Trail, although it is not part of the more well-known [[Santa Fe Trail]] leading to [[Missouri]]. From [[Colorado State Highway 470|CO 470]] to the I-25 interchange, Santa Fe also carries [[U.S. Route 85]].
*'''Sheridan Boulevard''' is a major north-south thoroughfare located at 5200 West. Much of Sheridan's distance serves as a city boundary between Denver and the western suburbs. From the southern end, Sheridan starts from roughly Quincy Avenue in [[Littleton, Colorado|Littleton]] to Baseline Road in Weld County.
*'''University Boulevard''' is a major north-south thoroughfare located at 2350 East, named for the [[University of Denver]], which it runs through.  While it doesn't exist north of 1st Avenue (its traffic separates into the York St./Josephine St. couplet), it is a major artery into and through Denver's far south suburbs, where it becomes 2400 East, south of Hampden Ave.

==Highways==
Highways that have portions running in or near Denver include:
* [[Interstate highway]]s: [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|I-25]], [[Interstate 70 (Colorado)|I-70]], [[Interstate 76 (Colorado)|I-76]], [[Interstate 270 (Colorado)|I-270]], and [[Interstate 225 (Colorado)|I-225]].
* Other limited-access freeways: [[U.S. Highway 36 (Colorado)|US 36]], [[U.S. Highway 6 (Colorado)|US 6]], [[U.S. Highway 285 (Colorado)|US 285]], [[Colorado State Highway 470|C-470]], [[Colorado State Highway 58|SH 58]].
* Toll highways: [[E-470]] and the [[Northwest Parkway]].

A '''summer capital''' is a city used as an administrative [[Capital (political)|capital]] during extended periods of particularly hot [[summer]] weather. The term is mostly of relevance in a historical context as [[political system]]s with ruling classes that would migrate to a summer capital, making them less prevalent in modern times.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The ubiquity of [[air-conditioning]] systems also reduces the imperative to periodically relocate to summer capitals.

==Summer capitals around the world==

===China===
Shangdu ([[Xanadu, China|Xanadu]]) was an "Upper Capital" during Kublai Khan's reign in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinatravelz.com/china/Inner-Mongolia/Xilinhot/yuanshangdu/index.asp |title=Shangdu (Upper Capital) the capital of the Yuan Dynasty |publisher=Chinatravelz.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104183734/http://www.chinatravelz.com/china/Inner-Mongolia/Xilinhot/yuanshangdu/index.asp |archivedate=November 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In [[India]], the government of the [[British Raj]] was annually transferred to [[Shimla]] during the summer months. This practice was stopped due to the difficulty of transporting officialdom, and the negative perceptions of the public about politicians and public servants making such a move. [[Srinagar]] is the summer capital of the Indian state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]].

===Philippines===
The [[hill station]] of [[Baguio]] in the northern mountains of [[Luzon]] was selected as the summer capital of the Philippines during the [[American Colonial Period (Philippines)|American Occupation]] in the early 20th century. Its cool climate was a preferred alternative to the sweltering, humid summers in the ''[[de facto]]'' capital, [[Manila]]. While the present sovereign government has long stopped transferring there ''en masse'', the city still hosts the official [[The Mansion (Baguio)|summer residence]] of the President of the Philippines&lt;ref name=themansion&gt;[http://malacanang.gov.ph/about/malacanang/mansion-house/ "Mansion House - Presidential Museum and Library"], Retrieved on 9 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;, and the Supreme Court of the Philippines still maintains its "Summer Sessions" in the city, and it remains a popular holiday spot especially around [[Christmas in the Philippines|Christmas season]], when temperatures are considerably lower than in the rest of the archipelago.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Russia===
Following Russia's loss of the traditionally popular resorts of the [[Crimea]] ([[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred]] away from the [[Russian SFSR]] to the [[Ukrainian SSR]] in 1954 by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]), [[Sochi]] emerged as the unofficial summer capital of the country.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|title=Sochi Olympics a 'monstrous scam' - Russian opposition|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22720228|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Sochi has also served as the location for the signing of many treaties, especially those between the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]], separatist [[Abkhazia]]n, and separatist [[South Ossetia]]n governing authorities.

===Saudi Arabia===
The Saudi royal family relocates to the mountainous city of [[Taif]], near [[Mecca]], which is  far cooler in the summer months than the official capital of [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Riyadh]]. But nowadays, it relocates mostly in [[Jeddah]].

===Spain===
The location of [[San Sebastián]] in the cooler, northern part of [[Spain]] close to the French border ideally placed it as a summer capital alternative to [[Madrid]].{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4774">'''Tacheometry''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|æ|k|i|ˈ|ɒ|m|ᵻ|t|r|i}}; from Greek for "quick measure"), is a system of rapid [[surveying]], by which the horizontal and vertical positions of points on the earth's surface relative to one another are determined without using a chain or tape, or a separate levelling instrument.
Instead of the pole formerly employed to mark a point, a staff similar to a [[level staff]] is used. This is marked with heights from the base or foot, and is graduated according to the form of [[tacheometer]] in use. 

The horizontal distance is inferred from the vertical angle included between two well-defined points on the staff and the known vertical distance between them. Alternatively, also by readings of the staff indicated by two fixed [[Stadia mark|stadia]] wires in the diaphragm ([[reticle]]) of the [[telescope]]. The difference of height is computed from the angle of depression or elevation of a fixed point on the staff and the horizontal distance already obtained. 
The [[azimuth]] angle is determined as formerly. Thus all the measurements requisite to locate a point both vertically and horizontally with reference to the point where the tacheometer is centred are determined by an observer at the instrument without any assistance beyond that of a man to hold the staff.

The ordinary methods of surveying with a [[theodolite]], [[surveyor's chain|chain,]] and [[levelling]] instrument are fairly satisfactory when the ground is relatively clear of obstructions and not very precipitous, but it becomes extremely cumbersome when the ground is covered with [[Shrub|bush]], or broken up by [[ravine]]s. Chain measurements then become slow and liable to considerable error; the levelling, too, is carried on at great disadvantage in point of speed, though without serious loss of accuracy. These difficulties led to the introduction of tacheometry.

In western countries, tacheometry is primarily of historical interest in surveying, as professional measurement nowadays is usually carried out using [[total station]]s and recorded using data collectors. Location positions are also determined using [[GNSS]].  Traditional methods and instruments are still in use in many areas of the world and by users who are not primarily surveyors.

==Tacheometer==
A ''tachymeter'' or ''tacheometer'' is a type of [[theodolite]] used for rapid [[measurement]]s and determines, electronically or electro-optically, the distance to target. The principles of action are similar to those of [[rangefinder]]s.

==Stadia measurements==
Other forms of tacheometry in surveying include the use of '''[[stadia rod]]s''' with theodolites or [[plane table|plane-table]] [[alidade]]s.&lt;ref name="dfk"&gt;Raymond Davis, Francis Foote, Joe Kelly, ''Surveying, Theory and Practice'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1966 LC 64-66263&lt;/ref&gt; These use [[stadia mark]]s on the instrument's [[reticle]] to measure the distance between two points on the stadia rod (the stadia interval). This is converted to distance from the instrument to the stadia rod by multiplying the stadia interval by the ''stadia interval factor''. If the stadia rod is not at the same elevation as the instrument, the value must be corrected for the angle of elevation between the instrument and the rod.

The formula most widely used for finding the distances is:

&lt;math&gt;
d = ks + c
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the stadia interval (top intercept minus bottom intercept); &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; are multiplicative and additive constants. Generally, the instrument is made so that &lt;math&gt;k = 100&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c = 0&lt;/math&gt; exactly, to simplify calculations.

==Subtense bars==
[[Image:Subtense Bar.jpg|thumb|Wild brand subtense bar]]
Another device used in tacheometry is the ''subtense bar''.&lt;ref name="dfk"/&gt; This is a rigid rod, usually of a material insensitive to change in temperature such as [[invar]], of fixed length (typically two metres). The subtense bar is mounted on a tripod over the station to which the distance is desired. It is brought to level and a small [[telescope]] on the bar enables the bar to be oriented perpendicular to the line of sight to the angle measuring station.

A theodolite is used to measure the angle between indicators on the two ends of the subtense bar. The distance from the telescope to the subtense bar is the height of an [[isosceles triangle]] formed with the theodolite at the upper vertex and the subtense bar length at its base, determined by [[trigonometry]].

'''Topography of [[Croatia]]''' is defined through three major [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] parts of the country. Those are the [[Pannonian Basin]], the [[Dinaric Alps]], and the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic Basin]]. The largest part of Croatia consists of lowlands, with elevations of less than {{convert|200|m|abbr=off}} above sea level recorded in 53.42% of the country. Bulk of the lowlands are found in the northern regions of the country, especially in [[Slavonia]], itself a part of the Pannonian Basin plain. The plains are interspersed by the [[Horst (geology)|horst]] and [[graben]] structures, believed to break the Pannonian Sea surface as [[Pannonian island mountains|islands]]. The greatest concentration of ground at relatively high elevations is found in [[Lika]] and [[Gorski Kotar]] areas in the Dinaric Alps, but such areas are found in all regions of Croatia to some extent. The Dinaric Alps contain the highest mountain in Croatia&amp;mdash;{{convert|1831|m|adj=on}} [[Dinara]], as well as all other mountains in Croatia higher than {{convert|1500|m|abbr=off}}. Croatia's [[Adriatic Sea]] mainland coast is {{convert|1777.3|km|abbr=off}} long, while its [[List of islands of Croatia|1,246 islands]] and islets encompass further {{convert|4058|km|abbr=off}} of coastline&amp;mdash;the most indented coastline in the Mediterranean. [[Karst topography]] makes up about half of Croatia and is especially prominent in the Dinaric Alps, as well as throughout the coastal areas and the islands.

==Geomorphological units==
The largest part of Croatia consists of lowlands, with elevations of less than {{convert|200|m|abbr=off}} above sea level recorded in 53.42% of the country. Bulk of the lowlands are found in the northern regions of the country, especially in [[Slavonia]], representing a part of the [[Pannonian Basin]]. Territory with elevations of {{convert|200|to|500|m|abbr=off}} above sea level encompasses 25.61% of Croatia's territory, and the areas between {{convert|500|and|1000|m|abbr=off}} above sea level cover the 17.11% of the country. Further 3.71% of the land is situated at {{convert|1000|to|1500|m|abbr=off}} above sea level, and only 0.15% of Croatia's territory lies at elevations greater than {{convert|1500|m|abbr=off}} above sea level.&lt;ref name="Yearbook-2011"/&gt; The greatest concentration of ground at relatively high elevations is found in [[Lika]] and [[Gorski Kotar]] areas in the [[Dinaric Alps]], but such areas are found in all regions of Croatia to some extent.&lt;ref name="EEA-Land-Use"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[European Environment Agency]]|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer/countries/hr/land-use-state-and-impacts-croatia|title=Land use - State and impacts (Croatia)|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pannonian Basin and the Dinaric Alps, along with the Adriatic Basin represent major [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] parts of Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Ministry of Construction and Spatial Planning (Croatia)]]|url=http://klima.mzopu.hr/UserDocsImages/Nacionalno_izv_KLIMA_23022007.pdf|format=PDF|title=Drugo, trece i cetvrto nacionalno izvješće Republike Hrvatske prema Okvirnoj konvenciji Ujedinjenih naroda o promjeni klime (UNFCCC)|trans-title=The second, third and fourth national report of the Republic of Croatia pursuant to the United Nations Framework Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC)|language=Croatian|date=November 2006|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pannonian Basin===
{{main|Pannonian Basin}}
[[File:Tree in the sun.jpg|thumb|right|A plain in [[Slavonia]]]]
The [[Pannonian Basin]] took shape through [[Miocene|Miocenian]] thinning and [[subsidence]] of crust structures formed during Late [[Paleozoic]] [[Variscan orogeny]]. The Paleozoic and [[Mesozoic]] structures are visible in [[Papuk]] and other Slavonian mountains. The processes also led to formation of a [[Stratovolcano|stratovolcanic]] chain in the basin 17&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 12&amp;nbsp;[[Mya (unit)|Mya]] and intensified subsidence observed until 5&amp;nbsp;Mya as well as [[flood basalt]]s about 7.5&amp;nbsp;Mya. Contemporary uplift of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] severed water flow to the [[Black Sea]] and [[Pannonian Sea]] formed in the basin. Sediment were transported to the basin from uplifting Carpathian and Dinaric mountains, with particularly deep fluvial sediments being deposited in the [[Pleistocene]] during uplift of the [[Transdanubian Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.hr/books?id=GClF-4rtvoIC|title=Recent Landform Evolution: The Carpatho-Balkan-Dinaric Region|isbn=978-94-007-2447-1|authors=Milos Stankoviansky, Adam Kotarba|publisher=Springer|year=2012|accessdate=2 March 2012|pages=14–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, up to {{convert|3000|m|abbr=off}} of the sediment was deposited in the basin, and the sea eventually drained through the [[Iron Gate (Danube)|Iron Gate]] gorge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=16|url=https://books.google.hr/books?id=NJNODA_0IOgC|title=The Nature Guide to the Hortobagy and Tisza River Floodplain, Hungary|author=Dirk Hilbers|publisher=[[Crossbill Guides Foundation]]|year=2008|isbn=978-90-5011-276-5|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of those processes are large plains in the eastern Slavonia, [[Baranya (region)|Baranya]] and [[Syrmia]], as well as in river valleys, especially along [[Sava]], [[Drava]] and [[Kupa]]. The plains are interspersed by the [[Horst (geology)|horst]] and [[graben]] structures, believed to break the Pannonian Sea surface as [[Pannonian island mountains|islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Frontiers in Tectonic Research : At the Midst of Plate Convergence|chapter=Neogene Tectonics in Croatian Part of the Pannonian Basin and Reflectance in Hydrocarbon Accumulations|editor=Uri Schattner|publisher=InTech|author1=Tomislav Malvić|author2=Josipa Velić|year=2011|pages=215–238|isbn=978-953-307-594-5|format=PDF|url=http://www.intechopen.com/source/pdfs/17665/InTech-Neogene_tectonics_in_croatian_part_of_the_pannonian_basin_and_reflectance_in_hydrocarbon_accumulations.pdf|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tallest among such landforms are {{convert|1059|m|adj=on}} [[Ivanšćica]] and {{convert|1035|m|adj=on}} [[Medvednica]] north of [[Zagreb]] and in [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]] as well as {{convert|984|m|adj=on}} [[Psunj]] and {{convert|953|m|adj=on}} Papuk which are the tallest among the Slavonian mountains surrounding [[Požega, Croatia|Požega]].&lt;ref name="Yearbook-2011"/&gt; Psunj, Papuk and adjacent [[Krndija]] consist mostly of Paleozoic rocks which are 350&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 300&amp;nbsp;million years old.

'''Tourism geography''' is the study of [[travel]] and [[tourism]], as an industry and as a [[social]] and [[culture|cultural]] activity. Tourism geography covers a wide range of interests including the environmental [[impacts of tourism|impact of tourism]], the geographies of tourism and leisure economies, answering tourism industry and management concerns and the sociology of tourism and locations of tourism.

Tourism geography is that branch of science which deals with the study of travel and its impact on places.

[[Geography]] is fundamental to the study of tourism, because tourism is geographical in nature. Tourism occurs in places, it involves movement and activities between places and it is an activity in which both place characteristics and personal self-identities are formed, through the relationships that are created among places, landscapes and people. Physical geography provides the essential background, against which tourism places are created and environmental impacts and concerns are major issues, that must be considered in managing the development of tourism places.

The approaches to study will differ according to the varying concerns. Much tourism management literature remains [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] in methodology and considers tourism as consisting of the places of tourist origin (or tourist generating areas), tourist destinations (or places of tourism supply) and the relationship (connections) between origin and destination places, which includes transportation routes, business relationships and traveler motivations.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, A and Crang, M (2001) 'The trouble with tourism and travel theory?' in ''Tourist Studies'' 1(5) p.5-22&lt;/ref&gt; Recent developments in [[human geography]] have resulted in approaches such as those from [[cultural geography]], which take more theoretically diverse approaches to tourism, including a sociology of tourism, which extends beyond tourism as an isolated, exceptional activity and considering how travel fits into the everyday lives and how tourism is not only a consumptive of places, but also produces the [[sense of place]] at a destination.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, J, Urry, J and Axhausen, K (2006) ''Mobilities, Networks, Geographies'' Aldershot:Ashgate&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Tourist'' by Dean MacCannell and ''The Tourist Gaze'' by [[John Urry (sociologist)|John Urry]] are classics in this field.

Punmia|author2= Ashok Kumar Jain|date=2005|publisher=Firewall Media|isbn=81-7008-853-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used in [[geodesy]]. Traverse networks involve placing survey stations along a line or path of travel, and then using the previously surveyed points as a base for observing the next point. Traverse networks have many advantages, including:

* Less reconnaissance and organization needed;
* While in other systems, which may require the survey to be performed along a rigid [[polygon]] shape, the traverse can change to any shape and thus can accommodate a great deal of different terrains;
* Only a few observations need to be taken at each station, whereas in other survey networks a great deal of angular and linear observations need to be made and considered;
* Traverse networks are free of the strength of figure considerations that happen in triangular systems;
* Scale error does not add up as the traverse is performed. Azimuth swing errors can also be reduced by increasing the distance between stations.

The traverse is more accurate than [[triangulateration]]&lt;ref&gt;Chrzanowski and Konecny, (1965); Adler and Schmutter (1971).&lt;/ref&gt; (a combined function of the [[triangulation]] and [[trilateration]] practice).&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, Wilfred (2001).

==Types==
Frequently in [[surveying|surveying engineering]] and [[Geodesy|geodetic science]], control points (CP) are setting/observing distance and direction ([[Bearing (navigation)|bearings]], [[angle]]s, [[azimuth]]s, and [[elevation]]). The CP throughout the control network may consist of [[monument]]s, [[Benchmark (surveying)|benchmarks]], [[Sea Level Datum of 1929|vertical control]], etc.There are mainly two types of traverse.Traverse may be either a closed traverse or an open traverse.
1.Closed traverse: the traverse which either originates from a station and returns to the same station completing a circuit or runs between two known stations,is called a closed traverse.
 2. Open traverse: the traverse which neither returns to its starting station nor closes on any other known station,is called open traverse.                                                                                                                                                     [[File:Open traverse.png|thumb|250px|Diagram of an open traverse]]
[[File:Close traverse.png|thumb|250px|Diagram of a closed traverse]]

===Compound===
A compound traverse is where an open traverse is linked at its ends to an existing traverse to form a closed traverse. The closing line may be defined by coordinates at the end points which have been determined by previous survey. The difficulty is, where there is linear misclosure, it is not known whether the error is in the new survey or the previous survey.

==Notes==

===Usages===
* '''Control point —''' The primary/base control used for preliminary measurements; it may consist of any known point capable of establishing accurate control of distance and direction (i.e. coordinates, elevation, bearings, etc.).
# '''''Starting –''''' The initial starting control point of the traverse.
# '''''Observation –''''' All known control points that are set or observed within the traverse.
# '''''Terminal –''''' The initial ending control point of the traverse; its coordinates are ''unknown''.tr
