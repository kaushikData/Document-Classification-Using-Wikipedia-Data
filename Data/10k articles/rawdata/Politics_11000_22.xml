'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]]''' ('''FOI''') refer to the right to access information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Access to public information builds on the principle that in a democratic system people should be in the condition of accessing a wide range of information in order to effectively participate in public life as well as on matters affecting them.

The right of access to public information is a component of the fundamental right of [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] set forth by Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948) which states that the fundamental right of freedom of expression encompasses the freedom "to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers". Access to public information and freedom of information are recognised as human rights in the three main regional systems of human rights, namely within the Americas, Europe and Africa, as well as in major international instruments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3024/en/international-standards:-right-to-information ARTICLE 19, The Public's Right to Know. Principles on Freedom of Information Legislation, 05 April 2012. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to access information places two obligations on public bodies. First, the proactive duty  to make public key information on the activities of authorities and governments; second, the reactive obligation to respond to  people's requests for information, either by releasing public original documents or copies of the documents held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), LegalLeaks - Toolkit.

Over the past 10 years, the right to information and access to public information has been recognised in an increasing number of countries and several [[Freedom of information laws by country|FOI laws]] have been adopted all over the world, including in the developing countries. If in 1990 only 13 countries had a national freedom of information law, today there are 100 such laws across the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information/ UNESCO.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/26216 Access-Info Europe, Statement by European RTI Community on the world's First Official Access to Information Day, 28 September 2016. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-18}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 The [[UNESCO]] General Conference voted to designate Sept. 28 as "International Day for the Universal Access to Information" or, as it is more commonly known, [[Access to Information Day]]. The date had previously been celebrated as "Right to Know Day" since 2002.  The UNESCO resolution recommends approval by the [[UN General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2015/11/unesco-names-sept-28-access-to-information-day/|title=UNESCO Names Sept. 28 Access to Information Day|last=|first=|date=17 November 2015|publisher=freedominfo.org|access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{See also|Freedom of information}}
{{See also|Freedom of information laws by country}}

The right to access information builds on the principle that the public has a right to know how power is exercised and public money is spent, given that public bodies are elected by people and sustained by taxpayers. The access to public information is a precondition  for governments' and public officials' accountability and it enables the adoption of informed decisions by citizens, hence representing a fundamental element for the proper functioning of democratic systems. International standards and evolving jurisprudence have confirmed that information held by public bodies belong to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/what-is-the-right-to-know Access-Info Europe, What is the right to know?{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents]] (2009) states that "all official documents are in principle public and can be withheld subject only to the protection of other rights and legitimate interests".&lt;ref&gt;[https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=0900001680084826 Council of Europe, Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents. Council of Europe Treaty Series - No. 205, 2009.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 100 countries around the world have now adopted national [[Freedom of information laws by country|access to information laws]] to make the right to know effective. The first law on access to public information was adopted in [[Sweden]] in 1766, but after that one should wait almost one century to have the second law approved in [[Finland]] in 1951 and in the [[United States]] in 1966. During the 1970s and 1980s there has been a small but constant growth in FOI's laws, with a real expansion after 1989 due to the activism of civil society groups in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] during the post-Communist transitions to democracy. Indeed, the big push forward in the field of access to information leading to the broadening of the definition and of the scope of the right of access to information came together with a coordinated civil society reaction to contrast the control over the information exercised by Communist regimes in the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet bloc]]. It was this movement which gave a sound contribution to the development of access to information as a right in the sense of a human right. A 1992 decision of the Hungary's Constitutional Court established that access to information is a "fundamental right" essential for citizen oversight on the lawfulness and efficiency of the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/CriticalPerspectivesonRightofAccesstoInfo_HelenDarbishire.pdf Helen Darbishire, "Ten Challenges for the Right to Information in the Era of Mega-Leaks"] in Tarlach McGonagle and Yvonne Donders (edited by), The United Nations and Freedom of Expression and Information. Critical perspectives, June 2015, {{ISBN|9781107083868}} {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, environmentalist groups and consumer associations also contributed to the affirmation of the right to know.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessinitiative.org/sites/default/files/companies_and_the_right_to_access_public_information.pdf Associación por los Derechos Civiles; Instituto del Banco Mundial; Inter-American Investment Corporation, 2007, Companies and the right to access public information. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-24}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

All the eight former communists countries which joined the [[Enlargement of the European Union|European Union in 2004]] had a freedom of information law; also [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] had their own law when joined the EU in 2007 and [[Croatia]] had already had an access to information law in force for ten years when it joined the EU in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/CriticalPerspectivesonRightofAccesstoInfo_HelenDarbishire.pdf Helen Darbishire, June 2015. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-20}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, in the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] region 48 of the 56 member states have specific access to information laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to access information places two obligations on governments and public bodies. First, the duty to make public key information on the activities implemented by public bodies; second, the obligation to respond to people's requests of accessing documents, either by making available the original documents or by sharing copies of documents and information held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to information is a right which comprises two parts. The first is a proactive component, namely the positive obligation of public bodies to provide, make public and disseminate information about their activities, budgets and policies so that citizens can understand what public bodies are doing, can participate in public life and can monitor the behaviour of public authorities. The second component is a reactive one, entailing the right of all persons to requests information and documents to public bodies, along with the right to receive an answer. In principle, all the main information held by public bodies should be available, while exceptions to disclosure should be grounded on the protection of other values, such as privacy, national security or commercial interests.

On the occasion of the first officially recognised [[Access to Information Day]] celebrated on 28 September 2016, European civil society groups working to enhance the right of access to public information raised some concerns as, despite significant progress, there are still far-reaching shortcomings especially with regard to transparency of decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/26216 Access-Info Europe, 28 September 2016. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-18}}]&lt;/ref&gt; According to such organisations, among the main obstacles to government openness there is the inadequate record keeping of public bodies’ information: minutes of public officials’ meetings are not recorded, exchange with lobbyists are not available, public decisions are adopted without proper justification or documented evidence available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/26216 Access-Info Europe, 28 September 2016. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-18}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/decision-making-transparency Access-Info Europe, Opening up decision-making. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-18}}]&lt;/ref&gt; An additional problem concerns the over-application of exceptions with particular regard to the use of the privacy reasons, applied to not disclose the activities of public officials when performing public functions. Moreover, European civil society organisations are particularly concerned for the lack of transparency around the decision-making process at both national and EU level, as in the case of the refusal by the EU to disclose documents on the [[EU-Turkey refugee deal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/26216 Access-Info Europe, 28 September 2016. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-18}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to information as a human right==

A big push forward the advancement of the right to access information as a fundamental right was due to the activism of civil society movements which contrasted the regimes' control over information in the Communist countries in the Soviet bloc. A fundamental document in this sense is a 1992's decision of the Hungarian Constitutional Court which established that access to information is a "fundamental right" essential for citizen oversight on the lawfulness and efficiency of the government.&lt;ref&gt;See Decision 32/1992 (V.29) AB, 183-84 (as translated by the Office of the Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information)&lt;/ref&gt;

Progressively, several national and international courts decisions have been treating access to information as a basic human right, thus providing a strong legal case for citizens resorting to courts to defend any refusals by authorities to provide access to public information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Such decisions are grounded on a series of international declarations, human rights covenants and conventions at international, regional and EU levels. In the first place, the right to access public information is recognised as a fundamental right and as a component of the right of freedom of expression in the Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]; in the Article 19 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights]]; and in the Article 13 of the [[American Convention on Human Rights]]. At regional level, all the three main regional systems of human rights, namely within the Americas, Europe and Africa, have recognised freedom of information as a universal human right.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3024/en/international-standards:-right-to-information ARTICLE 19, 05 April 2012. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] confirmed that the right to freedom of expression enshrined in Article 19 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] includes the right of access public information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the European Union level, Article 42 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|European Charter of Fundamental Rights]] establishes the right of access to EU institutions documents, as recognised also by Article 15 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|Treaty on the Functioning of the EU]] ("Treaty of Lisbon"). In 2009, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] on the basis of Article 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which is the article on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], acknowledged the fundamental right of access to information held by public bodies. Specifically, the Court established that the right to information is protected in particular in case of "[[information monopoly]]", namely when the public bodies are the only ones owning the requested information, and when the information is needed by media or civil society organisations for public accountability purposes. The decision of the European Court embraced a 2006 decision by the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] which endorsed Article 13 of the [[American Convention on Human Rights|American Human Rights convention]] stating that individuals have the right to request information to public authorities and public authorities have the positive obligation to provide such information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, many countries across the world recognise the right to information or access to documents in their [[Constitution]]s, either within the frame of the right to freedom of expression or separately and specifically as the right of access to information or documents. At least 50 countries all over the world, including 29 [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] countries, have Constitutions including such provisions .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societal benefits of access to public information: accountability, participation, efficiency==
[[Transparency (behavior)|Transparency]] enhanced through the right to access public information entails a series of core benefits for democratic societies, in particular [[accountability]], [[Participation (decision making)|participation]] and efficiency. First, access to public information enhances public accountability as it contributes to make governments and public officials more accountable for their actions and decisions. Second, the right to know boost people participation as it makes available information that can help citizens to make more effective decisions on matters that directly affect their lives and to participate with informed opinions in public debates and in the decision-making process. Third, access to public  information contributes to the efficiency of decision-making as disclosure encourages public institutions to better manage and organise information and may help to improve communication between public bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, access to information serve some other social goals. For instance, access to medical records can help individuals to improve personal decision-making and make better decisions about medical treatment, financial planning and the like. Finally, access to information can facilitate effective business practices as some of the information held by public bodies related to economic issues can be very useful for enterprises and can therefore contribute to increasing the effectiveness of the business sector.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3024/en/international-standards:-right-to-information ARTICLE 19, International 7standards: Right to information. 05 April 2012. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessinitiative.org/sites/default/files/companies_and_the_right_to_access_public_information.pdf Associación por los Derechos Civiles; Instituto del Banco Mundial; Inter-American Investment Corporation, 2007. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-24}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International standards and laws==
At national level access to public information is regulated by [[Freedom of information laws by country|freedom of information laws]]. In addition to national legislation, principles and standards for access to public information are set forth into several international declarations and treaties that have authoritatively recognised the fundamental and legal nature of the right to freedom of information along with the need for effective legislations that should guarantee the respect of that right in practice.&lt;ref&gt;.[https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3024/en/international-standards:-right-to-information ARTICLE 19, 05 April 2012. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Such international laws and standards include:

* '''Civil society standards and declarations''': these include the Ten Principles on the Right to Know by the Justice Initiative (2005); the Public's Right to Know - Principles on Freedom of Information Legislation by Article 19 (1999); the Atlanta Declaration and Plan of Action for the Advancement of the Right of Access to Information (2008); the Budapest Declaration on Right of Access to Information (2008); the Transparency Charter for International Financial Institutions: Claiming our Right to Know by the Global Transparency Initiative (2006); the Declaration on Parliamentary Openness (2012);
* '''International treaties''': these include the [[Council of Europe Convention on Access to Documents]] (2009) and the [[Aarhus Convention]] on Access to Information, Public Participation and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (1999);
* '''Inter-governmental Principles and Recommendations''': these include the Principles on the Right of Access to Information by the [[Organization of American States|Organisation of American States]] (2000); the [[Council of Europe]] Recommendation 2002(2) on access to official documents (2002); the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa by the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights|African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights]] (2002); the [[UNESCO]]'s Maputo Declaration on Fostering Freedom of Expression, Access to Information and Empowerment of People (2008); the [[UNESCO]]'s Brisbane Declaration on Freedom of Information; the Dakar Declaration on Media and Good Governance (2005);
* '''Annual reports of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression''': the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|UN Special Rapporteur]] has addressed the issue of freedom of information in its annual reports since 1997. After that, the Commission on Human Rights endorsed the commentaries of the Special Rapporteur and asked him to elaborate further on the right to seek and receive information. As a consequence, the UN Special Rapporteur expanded significantly his commentary on freedom of information in his 2000 annual Reports.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3024/en/international-standards:-right-to-information ARTICLE 19, International standards: Right to information. 05 April 2012. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to public information: guiding principles==
The non-governmental organisation [[Article 19|ARTICLE 19]] has published a set of principles called "The Public's Right To Know: Principles on Freedom of Information Legislation" which describes the best practices and standards on freedom of information legislation based on international and regional laws as well as on evolving national practices and legislations. Such principles, which are designed mainly for national laws, are also applicable to inter-governmental bodies such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, The Public's Right to Know. Principles on Freedom of Information Legislation, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 1: Maximum disclosure===
The principle of maximum disclosure sets a presumption that all information held by public bodies should be covered by the scope of access to information laws. This presumption accepts only limited circumstances for exceptions. This principle incorporates the very basic rationale underpinning the concept of freedom of information. It entails that public authorities seeking to deny access to public information have the obligation to justifying their refusal. The principle of maximum disclosure provides for a broad definition of "public bodies" which are subject to the duty of releasing information. Such a broad interpretation includes all branches of government, e.g. local governments, elected bodies, nationalised industries and public corporations, judicial bodies and also private bodies carrying out public functions. Principle 1 requires the law to establish minimum standards regarding the maintenance and preservation of documents by public bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 2: Obligation to publish===
This principle implies the obligation for public bodies to respond to access to information requests and to publish and disseminate documents of public interest. Few reasonable limits based, for instance, on resources and capacity can be accepted. As a minimum, public authorities should make public the following types of information:
* operational information on the functioning of public bodies, including objectives, results and costs;
* information on any requests or complaints that people may take in relation of a given public body;
* information on how members of the public may provide their contribution to the policy-making process;
* the types and formats of information held by public bodies;
* information on decisions and policies affecting the public, along with background information on those decisions and the evidence that led to their formulation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 3: Promotion of open government===
This principle calls governments to actively promote a culture of openness in order to enhance the respect of the right to know. This is important as experiences in different countries have shown that recalcitrant public authorities can undermine the application of even the most progressive legislations. National laws should therefore allocate adequate resources to the promotion of an [[open government]] culture and the goals of FOI laws, including by means of internal codes on access and openness, educational programmes, media coverage and communications campaigns. Such activities should also be aimed at contrasting the culture of official secrecy within government for example through trainings for public officials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt; An important step in this direction has been adopted in 2011 with the establishment of a new global alliance of democratic countries committed to the promotion of transparency, accountability and participation under the label [[Open Government Partnership]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/CriticalPerspectivesonRightofAccesstoInfo_HelenDarbishire.pdf Helen Darbishire, June 2015. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-20}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 4: Limited scope of exceptions===
Exceptions to disclosure should be grounded on clearly and narrowly defined exceptions. Public authorities should show that a refusal to provide the required information has passed a test through which to assess if the disclosure of a given information threaten to cause substantial harm to a legitimate aim and if the harm is greater than the public interest in having the information. Non-disclosure decisions should be taken on a case-by-case basis. National laws should provide an exhaustive list of the legitimate reasons that may justify non-disclosure. Such a list should be narrowly defined and include only highly relevant interests to be protected, such as [[law enforcement]], [[privacy]], [[national security]], commercial and other confidentiality, public or individual safety and the integrity of the decision-making process. However, even if can be demonstrated that disclosure would cause substantial harm to a legitimate interest, the information should be released when the benefits of disclosure prevail over the harm. In other words, the harm to the legitimate interest must be weighed against the public interest in having a given information publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 5: Processes to facilitate access===
According to this principle requests for public information should be processed quickly and fairly and an independent review of any refusals should be made available to the applicant. Also, public bodies are called to set up open, accessible systems for implementing freedom of information laws and thus ensuring the public's right to receive the required information. Furthermore, the law should establish an individual right to [[appeal]] to an independent body for any refusal by a public body to release information. All members of the public should be in the condition of accessing to appeal procedures without incurring in undue costs and complicated procedures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 6: Costs===
This principle states that costs for accessing public information should not be so high as to deter applicants from making the request. Around the world there are different cost regimes, including, for instance, flat fees systems for each request and graduated fees depending on the actual cost of retrieving and reproducing the information and / or the documents requested.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 7: Open meetings===
Freedom of information comprises the public's right to know how the government behaves on behalf of people and to participate to decision-making. Freedom of information law should thus incorporates the presumption that all relevant meetings of governing bodies, i.e. those involved in decision-making, should be open to the public. Meetings may be closed, but only when sound reasons for closure exist. Such reasons have to be clearly explained and closure have to comply to established procedures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 8: Disclosure takes precedence===
Other laws dealing with publicly held information should be consistent with the principle of maximum disclosure and the other principles underpinning freedom of information. In particular, the regime of exceptions  should be clearly defined in the freedom of information legislation; extensions of the exceptions regime should not be allowed by other laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle 9: Protection for whistleblowers===
[[Whistleblower]]s, i.e. individuals who make publicly available information on government's wrongdoings - including for instance corruption, dishonesty, maladministration, serious threat to health, safety or the environment, etc. - should be protected from any legal, administrative or other kind of sanctions. In this context the public interest refers to situations where the benefit of disclosure prevails over the harm, no matter how the disclosure has been conducted. This applies in particular when there are exceptionally serious reasons for releasing a certain information, such as a serious threat to public health or safety, or when there is a strong evidence that wrongdoing will be concealed or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/standards/righttoknow.pdf ARTICLE 19, June 1999.{{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-19}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to public information: main features==

===Universal access===
Being a fundamental and universal right, in principle access to information is a right to everyone: almost all national [[Freedom of information laws by country|freedom of information laws]] recognise this by establishing that "anyone" may make a request to access public information. One noteworthy exception among the world's democracies is [[Canada]] where only citizens and residents are entitled to submit access to information requests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, a major practical obstacle to the universal exercise of the right to access information is due to the obligation to submit the requests in the official language of the country which may hamper the exercise of the right to know for people that does not have a command of a country's official language.

In the EU, according to the treaties the right to access documents and the right to appeal to the [[European Ombudsman]] applies only to EU citizens, residents and companies registered inside the EU. While in general anyone whose right has been violated can appeal to the [[European Court of Justice]], in the case of the right to access information the Court is obliged to accept cases made by EU citizens, residents and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kind of information and documents to be made available under access to information laws===
In principle, all information held by public bodies can be accessed upon a FOI's request, unless some exceptions can be applied (e.g. on the ground of protecting state interests; private interests or human rights, or to ensure effective governments). Some national laws refer to "access to information" while others to "access to documents": even if these definitions actually overlap, it can be useful for the applicant to be aware of the exact phrasing used by the law in order to formulate properly the access to information request, and thus, having more chance of success. Usually "documents" and "information" should be made available whatever its medium, e.g. written on paper or in electronic format, or as a sound, visual or audiovisual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; The EU Regulation 1049/2001 specifies that documents subject to access to information are those concerning "policies, activities and decisions falling within the institutions’ sphere of responsibility" and this applies to all documents held by the EU institutions "in all areas of activity of the European Union".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/register/pdf/r1049_en.pdf REGULATION (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public bodies concerned by access to information===
In general in Europe the right of access to information applies to all administrative bodies, at any level of government, from central government to local authorities. Some rare exceptions to this can be found, as in the case of [[Ireland]] where police forces are exempted. In addition to administrative bodies, in national legislations which have been progressively approved the obligation to disclose information has been extended also to legislative and judicial bodies. Moreover, in many countries also some private bodies performing public functions or receiving public funds are obliged to respond to access to information requests. For instance, in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] which adopted an access to information law in 2006, the right to access applies to local and national governments, legislative bodies and judicial authorities, and encompasses also private bodies with public functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inter-governmental organisations====
Many inter-governmental bodies hold information about policies and decisions affecting people's lives. While the EU has defined a set of rules regulating access to information held by EU institutions, the debate is still open about whether the right of access information applies to inter-governmental organisations which are outside the scope of national laws and have not signed international human rights conventions. Campaigning organisations have worked for the adoption of internal rules - called "disclosure policies" or "access to information policies" - so that inter-governmental organisations could apply rules similar to national access to information laws. The [[World Bank]] adopted its Access to Information Policy in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standard exceptions to the right to information==
Although in  principles the right of access to information applies to all information held by public bodies, it is not an absolute right as there can be some exceptions not allowing the disclosure of certain kind of information. If released this information can violate some "legitimate interests", disturb public life or undermine other societal values. To justify the withhold of public information, authorities have the burden of the proof, thus have to demonstrate that disclosure would cause harm to a legitimate interest as specified by the law.

International laws and standards in the field of access to public information provide for three categories of standard exceptions. Specifically,

'''Exceptions to protect state interests or international relations''', such as:
* National security and defence of the state;
* International relations;
* Public safety or public order;
* Economic, monetary and exchange rate policies of the state;

'''Exceptions aimed at ensuring effective government''':
* Protection of internal public bodies’ deliberations prior to decision-making (known as "space to think" exception);
* Protection of criminal enquiries;

'''Exceptions to protect private interests and human rights''', such as:
* Privacy and other legitimate private interests;
* Commercial and other economic interests like, for instance, trade secrets;
* The environment;
* Guaranteeing the effective administration of justice and equality of parties before the courts.

However, even if the requested information or documents are sensitive and exceptions apply, some part of it could be released by public bodies on the ground of two factors. The first is the right of partial access according to which authorities have the duty of removing sensitive information and release the rest of the document. The second "exception to exceptions" applies when transparency overrides secrecy, thus even if the information is sensitive the public interest in knowing it is stronger. In this particular case public officials have to apply the so-called "public interest test", meaning that they have to scrutinize and ponder both the exceptions for not releasing information and the reasons of public interest in knowing the information required. Many national access to information laws foresees this kind of test.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Right to appeal==
Applicant have the [[Appeal|right to appeal]] in case of "[[administrative silence]]" (i.e. the request is not answered), when public authorities reject the disclosure request or when their reply is not satisfying and does not meaningfully answer the question. Rules regulating the right to appeal depends on national legislations and vary from country to country. Generally, there are four main appeals mechanisms:

* '''Internal or Administrative Appeal''': internal review is addressed to the same authority that issued the denial or made a non-satisfying disclosure or to the administrative body which is immediately superior;
* '''Administrative or Higher Court Appeal''': appeal to administrative court is usually the step following internal review. This is regulated by administrative law and the competent authority entitled to examine the appeal are regional or national administrative courts. A further appeal to a higher court, including the [[European Court of Human Rights]], is also possible.
* '''Information Commission/er Appeal''': in this case the appeal is scrutinised by a dedicated body whose specific role is to protect the right to access information. Such bodies can issue binding decisions as well as non-binding recommendations, depending on national laws. The decisions of the [[Information commissioner|Information Commissioner]] can always go to appeal. In the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] region, Information Commissions exist in 16 countries.
* '''Ombudsman Appeal''': in some countries, the [[Ombudsman]] - which is the institution whose role is to protect the rights of citizens vis à vis public authorities - has also the function to examine complains related to access to information. In many cases the Ombudsman's decision is only a recommendation, i.e. a non-binding measure, although usually his/her opinion is taken in due consideration by public authorities. At the EU level, the [[European Ombudsman]] is responsible for processing complaints concerning access to documents.

==Access to public information in practice==

===Request's contents===
Requests for accessing public information to the public authorities covered by the scope of national laws should be as clear and specific as possible about the information or documents required. A well-formulated request will facilitate the work of public officials and will more likely result in a positive answer or at least reducing the reasons for rejecting the request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the name and address of the person filing the request have to be provided. Giving also the e-mail address as well as a phone number might facilitate the exchange with public officials. In some countries requests made by resorting to pseudonyms or anonymously are permitted.

===Procedure===
In general, the procedure for requesting public information under national laws is simple and does not foresees many formalities. Usually requests can be filed in writing, either by post or hand-delivered to the concerned public authority. In most countries, submission is allowed also by e-mail. Moreover, some access to information laws permit oral requests, made, for instance, by phone or in person. However, in some cases, such as in [[Slovenia]], oral request are not considered to be a formal basis for going to appeal. In some countries, such as in [[Armenia]] or [[Romania]], rules and timeframes for written requests and oral requests are different.

===Fees===
Filing a request for accessing public information should always be free of charge, as confirmed by the [[Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents]] which allows only costs for copying and delivering the documents, such as photocopying, postage costs, or costs of reproduction into other formats or materials in case of DVDs or CDs. As a rule, electronic delivery is free of charge. The majority of countries in the [[Council of Europe]] region comply with this rule, even if there are notable exceptions, such as [[Ireland]] and [[Germany]] where, however, the required fees can be significantly reduced on the ground of public interest.

===Modalities of getting the information===
In reply of a formal request of accessing public information, the examination of the required information can be allowed in different ways, including the inspection of original documents; photocopies sent by post or e-mails; copies in DVDs or CDs.

===Timeframes for getting a reply===
There is a great variability across Europe on the timeframes for public authorities to answer requests as well as for notifying the extension of the timeframe for justified reasons or for issuing a refusal. However, the average time is about 15 working days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legalleaks.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Legal_Leaks_English_International_Version.pdf Access-Info and n-ost (edited by), June 2014. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-17}}]&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, the countries with the shortest timeframe for response are [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] (1–3 days). On the contrary, the Albanian and Austrian access to information laws give the authorities a period of respectively 40 and 60 days to respond to people's requests. Most national laws allow the extension of the timeframe in case of requests which are particularly complex. In all cases such extension should be notified to the applicant, along with an explanation of the reasons that led to it. At the EU level, the Regulation 1049/2001 establishes 15 working days for issuing a response; an extension of up 15 additional working days may be applied in exceptional cases, for instance when the request relates to long documents or a large number of documents.

Carnegie led the expansion of the American [[steel industry]] in the late 19th century and is often identified as [[List of wealthiest historical figures|one of the richest people]] (and [[List of richest Americans in history|richest Americans]]) in history.&lt;ref&gt;listed at 372 billion 2014 USD by Jacob Davidson, [http://time.com/money/3977798/the-10-richest-people-of-all-time time.com The 10 Richest People of All Time] "Rockefeller gets all the press, but Andrew Carnegie may be the richest American of all time.

His 1889 article proclaiming "[[The Gospel of Wealth]]" called on the rich to use their wealth to improve society, and stimulated a wave of philanthropy.

Carnegie was born in [[Dunfermline]], Scotland, and immigrated to the United States with his parents in 1848. Carnegie started work as a [[telegrapher]], and by the 1860s had investments in railroads, railroad sleeping cars, bridges, and oil derricks. He accumulated further wealth as a bond salesman, raising money for American enterprise in Europe. He built [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh's]] [[Carnegie Steel Company]], which he sold to [[J. P.

Carnegie devoted the remainder of his life to large-scale philanthropy, with special emphasis on [[Carnegie library|local libraries]], world peace, education, and scientific research.

==Biography==
[[File:Birthplace of Andrew Carnegie, Dunfermline.jpg|thumb|right|Birthplace of Andrew Carnegie in [[Dunfermline]], Scotland]]
Andrew Carnegie was born to Margaret Morrison Carnegie and William Carnegie in Dunfermline, [[Scotland]] in 1835, in a typical weaver's cottage with only one main room, consisting of half the ground floor which was shared with the neighboring weaver's family.&lt;ref name="MacKay pp23-24"&gt;[[#MacKay|MacKay]], pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; The main room served as a living room, dining room and bedroom.&lt;ref name="MacKay pp23-24" /&gt; He was named after his legal grandfather.&lt;ref name="MacKay pp23-24" /&gt; In 1836, the family moved to a larger house in Edgar Street (opposite Reid's Park), following the demand for more heavy [[damask]] from which his father benefited.&lt;ref name="MacKay pp23-24" /&gt; He was educated at the Free School in Dunfermline, which had been a gift to the town by the philanthropist [[Adam Rolland]] of Gask.&lt;ref&gt;The Edinburgh Magazine and Literary Review, Sept 1819&lt;/ref&gt;

His uncle, George Lauder Sr., a Scottish political leader, deeply influenced him as a boy by introducing him to the writings of [[Robert Burns]] and historical Scottish heroes such as [[Robert the Bruce]], [[William Wallace]], and [[Robert Roy MacGregor|Rob Roy]]. Lauder's son, also named [[George Lauder (Scottish industrialist)|George Lauder]], grew up with Carnegie and would become his business partner. When Carnegie was thirteen, his father had fallen on very hard times as a handloom weaver; making matters worse, the country was in starvation. His mother helped support the family by assisting her brother (a cobbler), and by selling potted meats at her "sweetie shop", leaving her as the primary breadwinner.&lt;ref name=Nasaw /&gt; Struggling to make ends meet, the Carnegies then decided to move to [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania]], in the United States in 1848 for the prospect of a better life.&lt;ref name="MacKay pp37-38"&gt;[[#MacKay|MacKay]], pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie's migration to America would be his second journey outside Dunfermline–the first being an outing to [[Edinburgh]] to see [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nasaw|first1=David|title=Andrew Carnegie|date=2006|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59420-104-2|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1848, Carnegie arrived with his family at their new prosperous home. Allegheny was rapidly populating in the 1840s, growing from around 10,000 to 21,262 residents.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Andrew Carnegie|last1=Nasaw|first1=David|date=2006|publisher=Penguin Group|isbn=978-1-59420-104-2|location=New York|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was very industrial and produced many products including wool and cotton cloth. The "Made in Allegheny" label used on these and other diversified products was becoming more and more popular.&lt;ref name=MadeInAlleg&gt;Jack McKee, "The North Side Story", in North Side Directory Chamber of Commerce Members 1960–61&lt;/ref&gt; For his father, the promising circumstances still did not provide him any good fortune. Dealers were not interested in selling his product, and he himself struggled to sell it on his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nasaw|first1=David|title=Andrew Carnegie|date=2006|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59420-104-2|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the father and son both received job offers at the same Scottish-owned cotton mill, Anchor Cotton Mills. Carnegie's first job in 1848 was as a [[bobbin boy]], changing spools of thread in a cotton mill 12 hours a day, 6 days a week in a Pittsburgh cotton factory. His starting wage was $1.20 per week (${{Inflation|US|1.20|1848|r=0}} by {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} inflation).&lt;ref&gt;''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

His father quit his position at the cotton mill soon after, returning to his loom and removing him as breadwinner once again.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; But Carnegie attracted the attention of John Hay, a Scottish manufacturer of bobbins, who offered him a job for $2.00 per week (${{Inflation|US|2.00|1848|r=0}} by {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} inflation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie|last=Carnegie|first=Andrew|publisher=|year=1919|isbn=|location=|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, Carnegie speaks of his past hardships he had to endure with this new job.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Soon after this Mr. John Hay, a fellow-Scotch manufacturer of bobbins in Allegheny City, needed a boy, and asked whether I would not go into his service. I went, and received two dollars per week; but at first the work was even more irksome than the factory. I had to run a small steam-engine and to fire the boiler in the cellar of the bobbin factory. It was too much for me. I found myself night after night, sitting up in bed trying the steam gauges, fearing at one time that the steam was too low and that the workers above would complain that they had not power enough, and at another time that the steam was too high and that the boiler might burst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/autobiography-of-andrew-carnegie/id395687568?mt=11|title=Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie|website=iBooks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Andrew and Thomas Carnegie - Project Gutenberg eText 17976.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Carnegie age 16, with brother Thomas]]
In 1849,&lt;ref&gt;Edge (2004) pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie became a telegraph messenger boy in the Pittsburgh Office of the Ohio Telegraph Company, at $2.50 per week (${{Inflation|US|2.50|1849|r=0}} by {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} inflation)&lt;ref&gt;''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; following the recommendation of his uncle. He was a very hard worker and would memorize all of the locations of Pittsburgh's businesses and the faces of important men. He made many connections this way. He also paid close attention to his work, and quickly learned to distinguish the differing sounds the incoming telegraph signals produced. He developed the ability to translate signals by ear, without using the paper slip,&lt;ref&gt;''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', pp. 56, 59&lt;/ref&gt; and within a year was promoted to operator. Carnegie's education and passion for reading was given a great boost by Colonel James Anderson, who opened his personal library of 400 volumes to working boys each Saturday night.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie was a consistent borrower and a "self-made man" in both his economic development and his intellectual and cultural development. He was so grateful to Colonel Anderson for the use of his library that he "resolved, if ever wealth came to me, [to see to it] that other poor boys might receive opportunities similar to those for which we were indebted to the noble man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart A.P.|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|location=New York|isbn=9781602397064}}&lt;/ref&gt; His capacity, his willingness for hard work, his perseverance and his alertness soon brought forth opportunities.

Starting in 1853, when Carnegie was around 18 years old, [[Thomas A. Scott]] of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad Company]] employed him as a secretary/telegraph operator at a salary of $4.00 per week (${{Inflation|US|4.00|1853|r=0}} by {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} inflation). Carnegie accepted this job with the railroad as he saw more prospects for career growth and experience with the railroad than with the telegraph company.&lt;ref name="Nasaw"/&gt; At age 24, Scott asked Carnegie if he could handle being superintendent of the Western Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad.&lt;ref name="Edge 2004 pg. 35"&gt;Edge (2004) p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1, 1859, Carnegie officially became superintendent of the Western Division. Carnegie then hired his sixteen-year-old brother, Tom, to be his personal secretary and telegraph operator. Not only did Carnegie hire his brother, but he also hired his cousin, Maria Hogan, who became the first female telegraph operator in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Edge (2004) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; As superintendent Carnegie made a salary of fifteen hundred dollars a year (${{Inflation|US|1500|1859|r=-3|fmt=c}} by {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} inflation).&lt;ref name="Edge 2004 pg. 35"/&gt; His employment by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company would be vital to his later success. The railroads were the first big businesses in America, and the Pennsylvania was one of the largest of them all. Carnegie learned much about management and cost control during these years, and from Scott in particular.&lt;ref name="Nasaw"&gt;[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 54–59, 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott also helped him with his first investments. Many of these were part of the corruption indulged in by Scott and the Pennsylvania's president, [[John Edgar Thomson]], which consisted of inside trading in companies that the railroad did business with, or payoffs made by contracting parties "as part of a [[quid pro quo]]".&lt;ref name="Nasaw_pg59_60"&gt;[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, Scott made it possible for Carnegie to invest $500 in the [[Adams Express Company|Adams Express]], which contracted with the Pennsylvania to carry its messengers. The money was secured by his mother's placing of a $600 mortgage on the family's $700 home, but the opportunity was available only because of Carnegie's close relationship with Scott.&lt;ref name="Nasaw_pg59_60"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, he received a few shares in [[Theodore Tuttle Woodruff]]'s sleeping car company, as a reward for holding shares that Woodruff had given to Scott and Thomson, as a payoff. Reinvesting his returns in such inside investments in railroad-related industries: (iron, bridges, and [[Track (rail transport)|rails]]), Carnegie slowly accumulated capital, the basis for his later success. Throughout his later career, he made use of his close connections to Thomson and Scott, as he established businesses that supplied rails and bridges to the railroad, offering the two men a stake in his enterprises.

===1860–1865: The Civil War===
Before the Civil War, Carnegie arranged a merger between Woodruff's company and that of [[George Pullman]], the inventor of a [[sleeping car]] for [[first class travel]] which facilitated business travel at distances over {{convert|500|mi|km}}. The investment proved a great success and a source of profit for Woodruff and Carnegie. The young Carnegie continued to work for the Pennsylvania's Tom Scott, and introduced several improvements in the service.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Carnegie, Andrew|volume=5|pages=364–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 1861, Carnegie was appointed by Scott, who was now Assistant Secretary of War in charge of military transportation, as Superintendent of the Military Railways and the Union Government's telegraph lines in the East. Carnegie helped open the rail lines into Washington D.C. that the rebels had cut; he rode the locomotive pulling the first brigade of Union troops to reach Washington D.C. Following the defeat of Union forces at [[First Battle of Bull Run|Bull Run]], he personally supervised the transportation of the defeated forces. Under his organization, the telegraph service rendered efficient service to the Union cause and significantly assisted in the eventual victory. Carnegie later joked that he was "the first casualty of the war" when he gained a scar on his cheek from freeing a trapped telegraph wire.

Defeat of the Confederacy required vast supplies of [[munition]]s, as well as railroads (and telegraph lines) to deliver the goods. The war demonstrated how integral the industries were to American success.

===Keystone Bridge Company===
In 1864, Carnegie invested $40,000 in Story Farm on Oil Creek in [[Venango County, Pennsylvania]]. In one year, the farm yielded over $1,000,000 in cash dividends, and petroleum from oil wells on the property sold profitably. The demand for iron products, such as armor for gunboats, cannons, and shells, as well as a hundred other industrial products, made Pittsburgh a center of wartime production. Carnegie worked with others in establishing a steel [[rolling mill]], and steel production and control of industry became the source of his fortune. Carnegie had some investments in the iron industry before the war.

After the war, Carnegie left the railroads to devote all his energies to the ironworks trade. Carnegie worked to develop several iron works, eventually forming the Keystone Bridge Works and the Union Ironworks, in Pittsburgh. Although he had left the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, he remained closely connected to its management, namely Thomas A. Scott and J. Edgar Thomson. He used his connection to the two men to acquire contracts for his [[Keystone Bridge Company]] and the rails produced by his [[ironworks]]. He also gave stock to Scott and Thomson in his businesses, and the Pennsylvania was his best customer. When he built his first steel plant, he made a point of naming it after Thomson. As well as having good business sense, Carnegie possessed charm and literary knowledge. He was invited to many important social functions—functions that Carnegie exploited to his own advantage.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 105–07.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Andrew Carnegie circa 1878 - Project Gutenberg eText 17976.jpg|thumb|upright|Carnegie, c. 1878]]
Carnegie believed in using his fortune for others and doing more than making money. He wrote:

{{quote|I propose to take an income no greater than $50,000 per annum! Beyond this I need ever earn, make no effort to increase my fortune, but spend the surplus each year for benevolent purposes! Let us cast aside business forever, except for others. Let us settle in Oxford and I shall get a thorough education, making the acquaintance of literary men. I figure that this will take three years active work. I shall pay especial attention to speaking in public. We can settle in London and I can purchase a controlling interest in some newspaper or live review and give the general management of it attention, taking part in public matters, especially those connected with education and improvement of the poorer classes. Man must have no idol and the amassing of wealth is one of the worst species of [[idolatry]]! No idol is more debasing than the worship of money! Whatever I engage in I must push inordinately; therefore should I be careful to choose that life which will be the most elevating in its character. To continue much longer overwhelmed by business cares and with most of my thoughts wholly upon the way to make more money in the shortest time, must degrade me beyond hope of permanent recovery. I will resign business at thirty-five, but during these ensuing two years I wish to spend the afternoons in receiving instruction and in reading systematically!}}

====1885–1900: Steel empire====
[[File:Bessemer converter.jpg|thumb|left|Bessemer converter]]

Carnegie did not want to marry during his mother's lifetime, instead choosing to take care of her in her illness towards the end of her life.{{sfnp|Edge|2004|p=78}} After she died in 1886, the 51-year-old Carnegie married [[Louise Whitfield Carnegie|Louise Whitfield]],{{sfnp|Edge|2004|p=78}} who was 21 years his junior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Meachen Rau, Dana |title=Andrew Carnegie: Captain of Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CyvHd3LxnIkC&amp;pg=PA72|date=2005|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-0-7565-1853-0|pages=72–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897,{{sfnp|Edge|2004|p=93}} the couple had their only child, a daughter, whom they named after Carnegie's mother, Margaret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Parker, Lewis K. |title=Andrew Carnegie and the Steel Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82w0rAyuhUkC&amp;pg=PA40|date= 2003|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-6896-1|pages=40–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnegie made his fortune in the [[steel industry]], controlling the most extensive integrated iron and steel operations ever owned by an individual in the United States. One of his two great innovations was in the cheap and efficient mass production of steel by adopting and adapting the [[Bessemer process]], which allowed the high carbon content of [[pig iron]] to be burnt away in a controlled and rapid way during [[steel production]]. Steel prices dropped as a result, and Bessemer steel was rapidly adopted for rails; however, it was not suitable for buildings and bridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics |last=Rosenberg |first=Nathan |year=1982 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, NY |isbn=978-0-521-27367-1 |page=90}} Bessemer steel suffered from nitrogen embrittlement with age&lt;/ref&gt;

The second was in his [[vertical integration]] of all suppliers of raw materials. In the late 1880s, Carnegie Steel was the largest manufacturer of [[pig iron]], steel rails, and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] in the world, with a capacity to produce approximately 2,000 tons of [[pig iron|pig metal]] per day. In 1883, Carnegie bought the rival [[Homestead Steel Works]], which included an extensive plant served by tributary coal and iron fields, a {{convert|425|mi|km|adj=on}} long railway, and a line of [[Great Lakes freighter|lake steamships]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Carnegie combined his assets and those of his associates in 1892 with the launching of the [[Carnegie Steel Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrew-Carnegie|title=Andrew Carnegie {{!}} Biography &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1889, the U.S. output of steel exceeded that of the UK, and Carnegie owned a large part of it. Carnegie's empire grew to include the [[Edgar Thomson Steel Works|J. Edgar Thomson Steel Works]] in [[Braddock, Pennsylvania|Braddock]], (named for [[John Edgar Thomson]], Carnegie's former boss and president of the Pennsylvania Railroad), Pittsburgh Bessemer Steel Works, the Lucy Furnaces, the Union Iron Mills, the Union Mill (Wilson, Walker &amp; County), the Keystone Bridge Works, the Hartman Steel Works, the Frick Coke Company, and the Scotia ore mines. Carnegie, through Keystone, supplied the steel for and owned shares in the landmark [[Eads Bridge]] project across the [[Mississippi River]] at [[St. Louis, Missouri]] (completed 1874). This project was an important proof-of-concept for steel technology, which marked the opening of a new steel market.

====1901: U.S. Steel====
[[File:Andrew Carnegie, Vanity Fair, 1903-10-29.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Carnegie caricatured by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] for [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], 1903]]
In 1901, Carnegie was 66 years of age and considering retirement. He reformed his enterprises into conventional [[joint stock corporation]]s as preparation to this end. [[John Pierpont Morgan]] was a banker and perhaps America's most important financial deal maker. He had observed how efficiently Carnegie produced profit. He envisioned an integrated steel industry that would cut costs, lower prices to consumers, produce in greater quantities and raise wages to workers. To this end, he needed to buy out Carnegie and several other major producers and integrate them into one company, thereby eliminating duplication and waste. He concluded negotiations on March 2, 1901, and formed the [[United States Steel Corporation]]. It was the first corporation in the world with a market capitalization over $1 billion.

The buyout, secretly negotiated by [[Charles M. Schwab]] (no relation to [[Charles R. Schwab]]), was the largest such industrial takeover in United States history to date. The holdings were incorporated in the United States Steel Corporation, a trust organized by Morgan, and Carnegie retired from business.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; His steel enterprises were bought out for $303,450,000.&lt;ref name="Hawke 1980"/&gt;

Carnegie's share of this amounted to $225.64 million (in {{Inflation-year|US}}, ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|225639000|1901}}}}), which was paid to Carnegie in the form of 5%, 50-year gold bonds. The letter agreeing to sell his share was signed on February 26, 1901. On March 2, the circular formally filing the organization and capitalization (at $1.4 billion – 4% of U.S. national wealth at the time) of the United States Steel Corporation actually completed the contract. The bonds were to be delivered within two weeks to the Hudson Trust Company of [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], in trust to Robert A. Franks, Carnegie's business secretary. There, a special vault was built to house the physical bulk of nearly $230 million worth of bonds.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Scholar and activist===

====1880–1900====
Carnegie continued his business career; some of his literary intentions were fulfilled. He befriended English poet [[Matthew Arnold]], English philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]], and American humorist [[Mark Twain]], as well as being in correspondence and acquaintance with most of the [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]],{{sfnp|Winkler|2006|p=172}} statesmen, and notable writers.{{sfnp|Winkler|2006|p=13}}

Carnegie constructed commodious swimming-baths for the people of his hometown in [[Dunfermline]] in 1879. In the following year, Carnegie gave £8,000 for the establishment of a [[Dunfermline Carnegie Library]] in Scotland. In 1884, he gave $50,000 to [[Bellevue Hospital Medical College]] (now part of [[New York University Medical Center]]) to found a [[histology|histological]] laboratory, now called the Carnegie Laboratory.

In 1881, Carnegie took his family, including his 70-year-old mother, on a trip to the United Kingdom. They toured Scotland by coach, and enjoyed several receptions en route. The highlight was a return to Dunfermline, where Carnegie's mother laid the foundation stone of a [[Carnegie library]] which he funded. Carnegie's criticism of British society did not mean dislike; on the contrary, one of Carnegie's ambitions was to act as a [[catalyst]] for a close association between English-speaking peoples. To this end, in the early 1880s in partnership with [[Samuel Storey]], he purchased numerous newspapers in England, all of which were to advocate the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of "the British Republic". Carnegie's charm, aided by his wealth, afforded him many British friends, including Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]].

In 1886, Carnegie's younger brother Thomas died at age 43. While owning steel works, Carnegie had purchased at low cost the most valuable of the iron ore fields around [[Lake Superior]]. The same year Carnegie became a figure of controversy. Following his tour of the UK, he wrote about his experiences in a book entitled ''An American Four-in-hand in Britain''.

[[File:James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce &amp; Andrew Carnegie - Project Gutenberg eText 17976.jpg|thumb|upright|Carnegie, right, with [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce]] in 1886]]
Although actively involved in running his many businesses, Carnegie had become a regular contributor to numerous magazines, most notably ''[[Nineteenth Century (periodical)|The Nineteenth Century]]'', under the editorship of [[James Knowles (architect)|James Knowles]], and the influential ''North American Review'', led by editor [[Lloyd Bryce]].

In 1886, Carnegie wrote his most radical work to date, entitled ''[[Triumphant Democracy]]''. Liberal in its use of statistics to make its arguments, the book argued his view that the American republican system of government was superior to the British [[monarchy|monarchical]] system. It gave a highly favorable and idealized view of American progress and criticized the British royal family. The cover depicted an upended royal [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] and a broken scepter. The book created considerable controversy in the UK. The book made many Americans appreciate their country's economic progress and sold over 40,000 copies, mostly in the US.

In 1889, Carnegie published "Wealth" in the June issue of the ''North American Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/rbannis1/AIH19th/Carnegie.html|journal=North American Review|title=Wealth|author=Carnegie, Andrew|date=June 1889 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After reading it, Gladstone requested its publication in England, where it appeared as "The Gospel of Wealth" in the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]''. Carnegie argued that the life of a wealthy industrialist should comprise two parts. The first part was the gathering and the accumulation of wealth. The second part was for the subsequent distribution of this wealth to benevolent causes. Philanthropy was key to making life worthwhile.

Carnegie was a well-regarded writer. He published three books on travel.&lt;ref&gt;Swetnam, George (1980) ''Andrew Carnegie''. Twayne Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-imperialism===
While Carnegie did not comment on British imperialism, he very strongly opposed the idea of American colonies. He strongly opposed the annexation of the Philippines, almost to the point of supporting [[William Jennings Bryan]] against McKinley in 1900. In 1898, Carnegie tried to arrange for independence for the Philippines. As the end of the [[Spanish–American War]] neared, the United States bought the Philippines from Spain for $20 million. To counter what he perceived as imperialism on the part of the United States, Carnegie personally offered $20 million to the Philippines so that the [[Filipino people]] could buy their independence from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carnegie/timeline/timeline2.html Andrew Carnegie timeline of events] PBS.&lt;/ref&gt; However, nothing came of the offer. In 1898 Carnegie joined the [[American Anti-Imperialist League]], in opposition to the U.S. annexation of the Philippines. Its membership included former presidents of the United States [[Grover Cleveland]] and [[Benjamin Harrison]] and literary figures like [[Mark Twain]].&lt;ref&gt;Hirschfeld, Katherine ''Health, Politics and Revolution in Cuba'', p. 117, Transaction Publishers, 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-4128-0863-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Porter, Robert Percival |title=Industrial Cuba: Being a Study of Present Commercial and Industrial Conditions, with Suggestions as to the Opportunities Presented in the Island for American Capital, Enterprise, and Labour|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t2goAAAAYAAJ|year=1899|publisher=G.P.

Carnegie spent his last years as a philanthropist. From 1901 forward, public attention was turned from the shrewd business acumen which had enabled Carnegie to accumulate such a fortune, to the public-spirited way in which he devoted himself to utilizing it on philanthropic projects. He had written about his views on social subjects and the responsibilities of great wealth in ''Triumphant Democracy'' (1886) and ''[[Gospel of Wealth]]'' (1889). Carnegie bought [[Skibo Castle]] in Scotland, and made his home partly there and partly in his [[Andrew Carnegie Mansion|New York mansion]] located at 2 East [[91st Street (Manhattan)|91st Street]] at [[Fifth Avenue]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The building was completed in late 1902, and he lived there until his death in 1919. His wife Louise continued to live there until her death in 1946. The building is now the [[Cooper-Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum]], part of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. The surrounding neighborhood on Manhattan's [[Upper East Side]] has come to be called [[Carnegie Hill]]. The mansion was named a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1966.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=387&amp;ResourceType=Building| title=Carnegie Hall| date=September 9, 2007| work=National Historic Landmark summary listing| publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=66000536|photos=y}} &lt;!--"Andrew Carnegie Mansion", May 30, 1975, by Richard Greenwood --&gt; |format=pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination|date=May 30, 1975|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpphotos"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=66000536|photos=y}} &lt;!--Andrew Carnegie Mansion—Accompanying 6 photos, exterior, from 1975. --&gt; |format=pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination|date=May 30, 1975|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GuidetoNYCLandmarks"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dolkart|first1=Andrew S|authorlink1=Andrew S.

====3,000 public libraries====
Among his many philanthropic efforts, the establishment of [[public library|public libraries]] throughout the United States, Britain, Canada and other English-speaking countries was especially prominent. In this special driving interest and project of his he was inspired by meetings with philanthropist [[Enoch Pratt]] (1808–1896). The [[Enoch Pratt Free Library]] (1886) impressed Carnegie deeply; he said, "Pratt was my guide and inspiration".

Carnegie turned over management of the library project by 1908 to his staff, led by [[James Bertram (Carnegie secretary)|James Bertram]] (1874–1934).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ellen Condliffe Lagemann|title=The Politics of Knowledge: The Carnegie Corporation, Philanthropy, and Public Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s0AalQle34cC&amp;pg=PA17|year=1992|publisher=U of Chicago Press|page=17|isbn=9780226467801}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first [[Carnegie library]] opened in 1883 in Dunfermline. His method was to build and equip, but only on condition that the local authority matched that by providing the land and a budget for operation and maintenance.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} To secure local interest, in 1885, he gave $500,000 to Pittsburgh for a public library, and in 1886, he gave $250,000 to Allegheny City for a music hall and library; and $250,000 to [[Edinburgh]] for a free library. In total, Carnegie funded some 3,000 libraries, located in 47 US states, and also in Canada, Britain, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the [[West Indies]], and [[Fiji]]. He also donated £50,000 to help set up the [[University of Birmingham]] in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mickelson, Peter |title=American Society and the Public Library in the Thought of Andrew Carnegie|journal=Journal of Library History|year=1975|volume=10|issue=2|pages=117–38|jstor=25540622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Van Slyck (1991) showed, the last years of the 19th century saw acceptance of the idea that free libraries should be available to the American public. But the design of the idealized free library was the subject of prolonged and heated debate. On one hand, the library profession called for designs that supported efficiency in administration and operation; on the other, wealthy philanthropists favored buildings that reinforced the paternalistic metaphor and enhanced civic pride. Between 1886 and 1917, Carnegie reformed both library philanthropy and library design, encouraging a closer correspondence between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=VanSlyck, Abigail A. |title="The Utmost Amount of Effectiv [sic] Accommodation": Andrew Carnegie and the Reform of the American Library|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|year=1991|volume= 50|issue=4|pages=359–83 |jstor=990662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Investing in education ====
[[File:CMUquadfromCoLcrop.jpg|thumb|right|[[Carnegie Mellon University]]]]

In 1900, Carnegie gave $2 million to start the [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] (CIT) at Pittsburgh and the same amount in 1902 to found the [[Carnegie Institution]] at Washington, D.C. He later contributed more to these and other schools.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} CIT is now known as [[Carnegie Mellon University]] after it merged with the [[Mellon Institute of Industrial Research]]. Carnegie also served on the Boards of [[Cornell University]] and [[Stevens Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.stevens.edu/catalog/archive/home/campus.html|title=Stevens Institute of Technology Campus and Directions|website=web.stevens.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, Carnegie became a sympathetic benefactor to [[George Ellery Hale]], who was trying to build the {{convert|100|in|m|adj=on}} [[Hooker telescope|Hooker Telescope]] at [[Mount Wilson Observatory|Mount Wilson]], and donated an additional ten million dollars to the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution]] with the following suggestion to expedite the construction of the telescope: "I hope the work at Mount Wilson will be vigorously pushed, because I am so anxious to hear the expected results from it. I should like to be satisfied before I depart, that we are going to repay to the old land some part of the debt we owe them by revealing more clearly than ever to them the new heavens." The telescope saw [[First light (astronomy)|first light]] on November 2, 1917, with Carnegie still alive.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Mike (1984).

In 1901, in Scotland, he gave $10 million to establish the [[Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland]]. It was created by a deed which he signed on June 7, 1901, and it was incorporated by Royal Charter on August 21, 1902. The establishing gift of $10 million was, then, an unprecedented sum: at the time, total government assistance to all four Scottish universities was about £50,000 a year. The aim of the Trust was to improve and extend the opportunities for scientific research in the Scottish universities and to enable the deserving and qualified youth of Scotland to attend a university.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080513232654/http://www.carnegie-trust.org/our_history.htm Our History]. Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently elected [[Lord Rector]] of [[University of St. Andrews]] in December 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Saturday |date=December 7, 1901 |page_number=11 |issue=36632}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also donated large sums of money to Dunfermline, the place of his birth. In addition to a library, Carnegie also bought the private estate which became [[Pittencrieff Park]] and opened it to all members of the public, establishing the Carnegie Dunfermline Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{Scottish charity|SC015710|Carnegie Dunfermline Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; to benefit the people of Dunfermline. A statue of him stands there today. In April 2018, his [[statue]] was vandalized and the police is investigating the incident. The officials have labelled this act as mindless act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dunfermlinepress.com/news/16133533.Andrew_Carnegie_statue_vandalised/|title=Andrew Carnegie statue vandalised|website=Dunfermline Press|language=en|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He gave a further $10 million in 1913 to endow the [[Carnegie United Kingdom Trust]], a grant-making foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Scottish charity|SC012799|Carnegie United Kingdom Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegieuktrust.org.uk/|title=Home – Carnegie UK Trust|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred to the trust the charge of all his existing and future benefactions, other than university benefactions in the United Kingdom. He gave the trustees a wide discretion, and they inaugurated a policy of financing rural library schemes rather than erecting library buildings, and of assisting the musical education of the people rather than granting organs to churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Carnegie, Andrew|volume=30|page=579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Carnegie also established large pension funds for his former employees at Homestead and, in 1905, for American college professors.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The latter fund evolved into [[TIAA-CREF]]. One critical requirement was that church-related schools had to sever their religious connections to get his money.

His interest in music led him to fund construction of 7,000 church organs. He built and owned [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York City.

Carnegie was a large benefactor of the [[Tuskegee Institute]] for African-American education under [[Booker T. Washington]]. He helped Washington create the [[National Negro Business League]].

[[File:Andrew Carnegie, April 1905.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|April 1905]]
In 1904, he founded the [[Carnegie Hero Fund]] for the United States and Canada (a few years later also established in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, and Germany) for the recognition of deeds of heroism. Carnegie contributed $1,500,000 in 1903 for the erection of the [[Peace Palace]] at [[The Hague]]; and he donated $150,000 for a [[Pan-American Palace]] in Washington as a home for the International Bureau of American Republics.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Carnegie was honored for his philanthropy and support of the arts by initiation as an honorary member of [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]] Fraternity on October 14, 1917, at the [[New England Conservatory|New England Conservatory of Music]] in Boston, Massachusetts. The fraternity's mission reflects Carnegie's values by developing young men to share their talents to create harmony in the world.

By the standards of 19th century tycoons, Carnegie was not a particularly ruthless man but a humanitarian with enough acquisitiveness to go in the ruthless pursuit of money.&lt;ref&gt;Krause, Paul (1992). ''The Battle for Homestead 1880–1892''. University of Pittsburgh Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8229-5466-8}}. p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; "Maybe with the giving away of his money," commented biographer [[Joseph Frazier Wall|Joseph Wall]], "he would justify what he had done to get that money."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carnegie/filmmore/description.html "Andrew Carnegie"]. ''The American Experience''. PBS.&lt;/ref&gt;

To some, Carnegie represents the idea of the American dream. He was an immigrant from Scotland who came to America and became successful. He is not only known for his successes but his enormous amounts of philanthropist works, not only to charities but also to promote democracy and independence to colonized countries.&lt;ref&gt;Swetnam, George.

==Controversies==

===1889: Johnstown Flood===
{{main|Johnstown Flood}}
Carnegie was one of more than 50 members of the [[South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club]], which has been blamed for the [[Johnstown Flood]] that killed 2,209 people in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frank, Walter Smoter |title=The Cause of the Johnstown Flood|date= May 1988 |journal= Civil Engineering|pages=63–66|url=http://smoter.com/flooddam/johnstow.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the suggestion of his friend Benjamin Ruff, Carnegie's partner [[Henry Clay Frick]] had formed the exclusive South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club high above Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The sixty-odd club members were the leading business tycoons of Western Pennsylvania and included among their number Frick's best friend, [[Andrew W. Mellon|Andrew Mellon]], his attorneys [[Philander Knox]] and James Hay Reed, as well as Frick's business partner, Carnegie. High above the city, near the small town of South Fork, the [[South Fork Dam]] was originally built between 1838 and 1853 by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as part of a canal system to be used as a reservoir for a canal basin in Johnstown. With the coming-of-age of railroads superseding canal barge transport, the lake was abandoned by the Commonwealth, sold to the Pennsylvania Railroad, and sold again to private interests and eventually came to be owned by the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club in 1881. Prior to the flood, speculators had purchased the abandoned reservoir, made less than well-engineered repairs to the old dam, raised the lake level, built cottages and a clubhouse, and created the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club. Less than {{convert|20|mi}} downstream from the dam sat the city of Johnstown.

The dam was {{convert|72|ft|m}} high and {{convert|931|ft|m}} long. Between 1881 when the club was opened, and 1889, the dam frequently sprang leaks and was patched, mostly with mud and straw. Additionally, a previous owner removed and sold for scrap the 3 [[cast iron]] discharge pipes that previously allowed a controlled release of water. There had been some speculation as to the dam's integrity, and concerns had been raised by the head of the Cambria Iron Works downstream in Johnstown. Such repair work, a reduction in height, and unusually high snowmelt and heavy spring rains combined to cause the dam to give way on May 31, 1889 resulting in twenty million tons of water sweeping down the valley causing the Johnstown Flood.&lt;ref&gt;McCullough, David (1987) ''The Johnstown Flood''. Simon &amp; Schuster, New York. {{ISBN|0671207148}}&lt;/ref&gt; When word of the dam's failure was telegraphed to Pittsburgh, Frick and other members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club gathered to form the Pittsburgh Relief Committee for assistance to the flood victims as well as determining never to speak publicly about the club or the flood. This strategy was a success, and Knox and Reed were able to fend off all lawsuits that would have placed blame upon the club's members.

Although Cambria Iron and Steel's facilities were heavily damaged by the flood, they returned to full production within a year. After the flood, Carnegie built Johnstown a new library to replace the one built by Cambria's chief legal counsel Cyrus Elder, which was destroyed in the flood. The Carnegie-donated library is now owned by the Johnstown Area Heritage Association, and houses the Flood Museum.

===1892: Homestead Strike===
[[File:Homestead Strike - Mob attacking Pinkerton men.jpg|thumb|The Homestead Strike]]

The [[Homestead Strike]] was a bloody labor confrontation lasting 143 days in 1892, one of the most serious in U.S. history. The conflict was centered on Carnegie Steel's main plant in [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]], and grew out of a dispute between the National Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers of the United States and the [[Carnegie Steel Company]].

Carnegie left on a trip to Scotland before the unrest peaked.&lt;ref name="Carnegie, Andrew 1920"&gt;''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', Ch. 17&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, Carnegie left mediation of the dispute in the hands of his associate and partner [[Henry Clay Frick]]. Frick was well known in industrial circles for maintaining staunch anti-union sensibilities.

[[File:Frick to Carnegie letter about the arming of the Pinkertons.jpg|thumb|left|Frick's letter to Carnegie describing the plans and munitions that will be on the barges when the Pinkertons arrive to confront the strikers in Homestead.]]
After a recent increase in profits by 60%, the company refused to raise workers' pay by more than 30%. When some of the workers demanded the full 60%, management locked the union out. Workers considered the stoppage a "[[lockout (industry)|lockout]]" by management and not a "strike" by workers. As such, the workers would have been well within their rights to protest, and subsequent government action would have been a set of criminal procedures designed to crush what was seen as a pivotal demonstration of the growing [[Labor history of the United States|labor rights movement]], strongly opposed by management. Frick brought in thousands of strikebreakers to work the steel mills and [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] agents to safeguard them.

On July 6, the arrival of a force of 300 Pinkerton agents from New York City and Chicago resulted in a fight in which 10 men—seven strikers and three Pinkertons—were killed and hundreds were injured. Pennsylvania Governor [[Robert E. Pattison|Robert Pattison]] ordered two brigades of state militia to the strike site. Then, allegedly in response to the fight between the striking workers and the Pinkertons, [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Alexander Berkman]] shot at Frick in an attempted assassination, wounding Frick. While not directly connected to the strike, Berkman was tied in for the assassination attempt. According to Berkman, "...with the elimination of Frick, responsibility for Homestead conditions would rest with Carnegie."&lt;ref&gt;Berkman, Alexander (1912) [https://archive.org/details/prisonmemoirsan01berkgoog ''Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist'']. Mother Earth Publishing Association. p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the company successfully resumed operations with non-union immigrant employees in place of the Homestead plant workers, and Carnegie returned to the United States.&lt;ref name="Carnegie, Andrew 1920"/&gt; However, Carnegie's reputation was permanently damaged by the Homestead events.

==Philosophy==

===Andrew Carnegie Dictum===
In his final days, Carnegie suffered from pneumonia. Before his death on August 11, 1919, Carnegie had donated $350,695,654 for various causes. The "Andrew Carnegie Dictum" was:
*To spend the first third of one's life getting all the education one can.
*To spend the next third making all the money one can.
*To spend the last third giving it all away for worthwhile causes.
Carnegie was involved in philanthropic causes, but he kept himself away from religious circles. He wanted to be identified by the world as a "[[positivist]]". He was highly influenced in public life by [[John Bright]].

===On wealth===
[[File:Andrew Carnegie at Skibo 1914 - Project Gutenberg eText 17976.jpg|thumb|upright|Carnegie at Skibo Castle, 1914]]
[[File:Stain Glass Andrew Mellon.JPG|thumb|upright|Window dedicated to Carnegie in the [[National Cathedral]]]]
As early as 1868, at age 33, he drafted a memo to himself. He wrote: "...The amassing of wealth is one of the worse species of idolatry. No idol more debasing than the worship of money."&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Maury (2004) ''The Change Makers'', p. 57, Macmillan. {{ISBN|978-0-8050-7518-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid degrading himself, he wrote in the same memo he would retire at age 35 to pursue the practice of philanthropic giving for "...the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced." However, he did not begin his philanthropic work in all earnest until 1881, with the gift of a library to his hometown of Dunfermline, Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Burlingame, Dwight (2004) ''Philanthropy in America''. ABC-CLIO. {{ISBN|978-1-57607-860-0}}. p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnegie wrote "[[The Gospel of Wealth]]",&lt;ref&gt;''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', pp. 255–67&lt;/ref&gt; an article in which he stated his belief that the rich should use their wealth to help enrich society. In that article, Carnegie also expressed sympathy for the ideas of [[progressive tax]]ation and an [[inheritance tax|estate tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Carnegie|first=Andrew|title=The Gospel of Wealth and Other Timely Essays|publisher=[[The Century Company]]|page=11|place=New York|year=1900|quote="The growing disposition to tax more and more heavily large estates left at death is a cheering indication of the growth of a salutary change in public opinion. The State of Pennsylvania now takes–subject to some exceptions–one tenth of the property left by its citizens. The budget presented in the British Parliament the other day proposes to increase the death duties; and, most significant of all, the new tax is to be a graduated one. Of all forms of taxation this seems the wisest. Men who continue hoarding great sums all their lives, the proper use of which for public ends would work good to the community from which it chiefly came, should be made to feel that the community, in the form of the State, cannot thus be deprived of its proper share. By taxing estates heavily at death the State marks its condemnation of the selfish millionaire's unworthy life."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Carnegie|first=Andrew|title=The Gospel of Wealth and Other Timely Essays|publisher=[[Harvard University Press|Belknap Press of Harvard University Press]]|pages=21–22|place=Cambridge, Massachusetts|year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is taken from one of Carnegie's memos to himself:

{{quote|Man does not live by bread alone. I have known millionaires starving for lack of the nutriment which alone can sustain all that is human in man, and I know workmen, and many so-called poor men, who revel in luxuries beyond the power of those millionaires to reach. It is the mind that makes the body rich. There is no class so pitiably wretched as that which possesses money and nothing else. Money can only be the useful drudge of things immeasurably higher than itself. Exalted beyond this, as it sometimes is, it remains Caliban still and still plays the beast. My aspirations take a higher flight. Mine be it to have contributed to the enlightenment and the joys of the mind, to the things of the spirit, to all that tends to bring into the lives of the toilers of Pittsburgh sweetness and light. I hold this the noblest possible use of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Carnegie Libraries |publisher=Ontario Ministry of Tourism and Culture |url=http://www.mtc.gov.on.ca/en/libraries/carnegie_bio.shtml |accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Intellectual influences===
Carnegie claimed to be a champion of evolutionary thought particularly the work of [[Herbert Spencer]], even declaring Spencer his teacher.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#Wealth|Wealth]]'', p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Although Carnegie claims to be a disciple of Spencer many of his actions went against the ideas espoused by Spencer.

Spencerian evolution was for individual rights and against government interference. Furthermore, Spencerian evolution held that those unfit to sustain themselves must be allowed to perish. Spencer believed that just as there were many varieties of beetles, respectively modified to existence in a particular place in nature, so too had human society "spontaneously fallen into division of labour".&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Herbert, 1855 (''The Principles of Psychology'', Chapter 1. "Method"). (Kindle Locations 7196–7197). Kindle Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who survived to this, the latest and highest stage of evolutionary progress would be "those in whom the power of self-preservation is the greatest—are the select of their generation."&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Herbert 1904. (''An Autobiography'', Chapter 23, "A More Active Year") (Kindle Location 5572). Peerless Press. Kindle Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Spencer perceived governmental authority as borrowed from the people to perform the transitory aims of establishing social cohesion, insurance of rights, and security.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Herbert, 1851 (''Social Statics'', Chapter 19 "The Right to Ignore the State"). (Kindle Locations 43303–43309). Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Herbert, 1851 (''Social Statics'', "Chapter 21 The Duty of the State").  (Kindle Locations 44159–44168). Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Spencerian 'survival of the fittest' firmly credits any provisions made to assist the weak, unskilled, poor and distressed to be an imprudent disservice to evolution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Spencer, Herbert, 1851 (''Social Statics'', chapter 25 "poor-laws"). (Kindle Locations 45395–45420). Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Spencer insisted people should resist for the benefit of collective humanity, as severe fate singles out the weak, debauched, and disabled.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Andrew Carnegie's political and economic focus during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century was the defense of laissez faire economics. Carnegie emphatically resisted government intrusion in commerce, as well as government-sponsored charities. Carnegie believed the concentration of capital was essential for societal progress and should be encouraged.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''[[#Wealth|Wealth]]'', pp. 947–54&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie was an ardent supporter of commercial "survival of the fittest" and sought to attain immunity from business challenges by dominating all phases of the steel manufacturing procedure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 4762–67&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie's determination to lower costs included cutting labor expenses as well.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#Wealth|Wealth]]'', pp. 118–21&lt;/ref&gt; In a notably Spencerian manner, Carnegie argued that unions impeded the natural reduction of prices by pushing up costs, which blocked evolutionary progress.&lt;ref&gt;''[[#Wealth|Wealth]]'', pp. 1188–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie felt that unions represented the narrow interest of the few while his actions benefited the entire community.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

On the surface, Andrew Carnegie appears to be a strict laissez-faire capitalist and follower of Herbert Spencer, often referring to himself as a disciple of Spencer.&lt;ref name="Carnegie, Andrew pp. 163-171"&gt;''[[#Wealth|Wealth]]'', pp. 163–71&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Carnegie a titan of industry seems to embody all of the qualities of Spencerian survival of the fittest. The two men enjoyed a mutual respect for one another and maintained correspondence until Spencer's death in 1903.&lt;ref name="Carnegie, Andrew pp. 163-171" /&gt; There are however, some major discrepancies between Spencer's capitalist evolutionary conceptions and Andrew Carnegie's capitalist practices.

Spencer wrote that in production the advantages of the superior individual are comparatively minor, and thus acceptable, yet the benefit that dominance provides those who control a large segment of production might be hazardous to competition. Spencer feared that an absence of "sympathetic self-restraint" of those with too much power could lead to the ruin of their competitors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Spencer, Herbert 1887 (''The Ethics of Social Life: Negative Beneficence''). ''The Collected Works of 6 Books'' (With Active Table of Contents) (Kindle Locations 26500–26524). Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not think free market competition necessitated competitive warfare. Furthermore, Spencer argued that individuals with superior resources who deliberately used investment schemes to put competitors out of business were committing acts of "commercial murder".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Carnegie built his wealth in the steel industry by maintaining an extensively integrated operating system. Carnegie also bought out some regional competitors, and merged with others, usually maintaining the majority shares in the companies. Over the course of twenty years, Carnegie's steel properties grew to include the Edgar Thomson Steel Works, the Lucy Furnace Works, the Union Iron Mills, the Homestead Works, the Keystone Bridge Works, the Hartman Steel Works, the Frick Coke Company, and the Scotia ore mines among many other industry related assets.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Charles R. (2005). ''The Tycoons: How Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, Jay Gould, and J.P. Morgan Invented the American Supereconomy''. Times Books. {{ISBN|0-8050-7599-2}}. p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Carnegie's success was due to his convenient relationship with the railroad industries, which not only relied on steel for track, but were also making money from steel transport. The steel and railroad barons worked closely to negotiate prices instead of free market competition determinations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 3264–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Carnegie's market manipulation, United States trade tariffs were also working in favor of the steel industry. Carnegie spent energy and resources lobbying congress for a continuation of favorable tariffs from which he earned millions of dollars a year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 7114–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie tried to keep this information concealed, but legal documents released in 1900, during proceedings with the ex-chairman of Carnegie Steel, Henry Clay Frick, revealed how favorable the tariffs had been.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 10653–57&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert Spencer absolutely was against government interference in business in the form of regulatory limitation, taxes, and tariffs as well. Spencer saw tariffs as a form of taxation that levied against the majority in service to "the benefit of a small minority of manufacturers and artisans".&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Herbert. ''Principles of Ethics'', 1897 (Chapter 22: "Political Rights-So-called"). (With Active Table of Contents) (Kindle Locations 24948–24956). Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Carnegie's personal dedication to Herbert Spencer as a friend, his adherence to Spencer's political and economic ideas is more contentious. In particular, it appears Carnegie either misunderstood or intentionally misrepresented some of Spencer's principal arguments. Spencer remarked upon his first visit to Carnegie's steel mills in Pittsburgh, which Carnegie saw as the manifestation of Spencer's philosophy, "Six months' residence here would justify suicide."&lt;ref&gt;Wall, Joseph Frazer (1989). ''Andrew Carnegie''. p. 386. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|The conditions of human society create for this an imperious demand; the concentration of capital is a necessity for meeting the demands of our day, and as such should not be looked at askance, but be encouraged. There is nothing detrimental to human society in it, but much that is, or is bound soon to become, beneficial. It is an evolution from the heterogeneous to the homogeneous, and is clearly another step in the upward path of development.|Carnegie, Andrew 1901 The Gospel of Wealth and Other Timely Essays&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;}}

On the subject of charity Andrew Carnegie's actions diverged in the most significant and complex manner from Herbert Spencer's philosophies. In his 1854 essay "Manners and Fashion", Spencer referred to public education as "Old schemes". He went on to declare that public schools and colleges fill the heads of students with inept, useless knowledge and exclude useful knowledge. Spencer stated that he trusted no organization of any kind, "political, religious, literary, philanthropic", and believed that as they expanded in influence so too did their regulations expand. In addition, Spencer thought that as all institutions grow they become evermore corrupted by the influence of power and money. The institution eventually loses its "original spirit, and sinks into a lifeless mechanism".&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Herbert. 1854 (''Manners and Fashion'') ''The Collected Works of 6 Books'' (With Active Table of Contents) (Kindle Locations 74639–74656). Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Spencer insisted that all forms of philanthropy that uplift the poor and downtrodden were reckless and incompetent. Spencer thought any attempt to prevent "the really salutary sufferings" of the less fortunate "bequeath to posterity a continually increasing curse".&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Herbert; Eliot, Charles William (September 15, 2011). ''The Collected Works of 6 Books'' (With Active Table of Contents) (Kindle Locations 45395–45420). Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie, a self-proclaimed devotee of Spencer, testified to Congress on February 5, 1915: "My business is to do as much good in the world as I can; I have retired from all other business."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], p. 787.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnegie held that societal progress relied on individuals who maintained moral obligations to themselves and to society.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 11529–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he believed that charity supplied the means for those who wish to improve themselves to achieve their goals.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;''[[#Wealth|Wealth]]'', pp. 747–48&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie urged other wealthy people to contribute to society in the form of parks, works of art, libraries and other endeavors that improve the community and contribute to the "lasting good".&lt;ref&gt;''[[#Wealth|Wealth]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie also held a strong opinion against inherited wealth. Carnegie believed that the sons of prosperous businesspersons were rarely as talented as their fathers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; By leaving large sums of money to their children, wealthy business leaders were wasting resources that could be used to benefit society. Most notably, Carnegie believed that the future leaders of society would rise from the ranks of the poor.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;''[[#Wealth|Wealth]]'', pp. 682–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie strongly believed in this because he had risen from the bottom. He believed the poor possessed an advantage over the wealthy because they receive greater attention from their parents and are taught better work ethics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;

===Religion and worldview===
Carnegie and his family belonged to the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America]], also known informally as the Northern Presbyterian Church. In his early life Carnegie was skeptical of [[Calvinism]], and religion as a whole, but reconciled with it later in his life. In his autobiography, Carnegie describes his family as moderate [[Presbyterian]] believers, writing that "there was not one orthodox Presbyterian" in his family; various members of his family having somewhat distanced themselves from Calvinism, some of them leaning more towards [[Swedenborgianism]]. Although, being a child, his family led vigorous theological and political disputes. His mother avoided the topic of religion. His father left the Presbyterian church after a sermon on infant damnation, while, according to Carnegie, still remaining very religious on his own.

Witnessing sectarianism and strife in 19th century Scotland regarding religion and philosophy, Carnegie kept his distance from organized religion and theism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]]&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie instead preferred to see things through naturalistic and scientific terms stating, "Not only had I got rid of the theology and the supernatural, but I had found the truth of evolution."&lt;ref&gt;''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in life, Carnegie's firm opposition to religion softened. For many years he was a member of [[Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church]], pastored from 1905 to 1926 by [[Social Gospel]] exponent [[Henry Sloane Coffin]], while his wife and daughter belonged to the [[Brick Presbyterian Church (New York City)|Brick Presbyterian Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1919/04/23/archives/bagpipe-tunes-at-carnegie-wedding-charm-of-bonnie-scotland-lent-to.html "Bagpipe Tunes at Carnegie Wedding"]. ''The New York Times''. April 23, 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; He also prepared (but did not deliver) an address in which he professed a belief in "an Infinite and Eternal Energy from which all things proceed".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], p. 625&lt;/ref&gt; Records exist of a short period of correspondence around 1912–1913 between Carnegie and [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the eldest son of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. In these letters, one of which was published in the ''New York Times'' in full text,&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/09/05/301813232.pdf "Carnegie exalted by Bahaist leader"]. ''The New York Times''. September 5, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie is extolled as a "lover of the world of humanity and one of the founders of Universal Peace".

===World peace===
[[File:Stamp-andrew-carnegie.jpg|thumb|Carnegie commemorated as an industrialist, philanthropist, and founder of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 1960&lt;ref&gt;"[http://arago.si.edu/flash/?tid=2027477|s1=1 Andrew Carnegie Issue]", Arago: people, postage &amp; the post, Smithsonian National Postal Museum, viewed September 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
Influenced by his "favorite living hero in public life" [[John Bright]], Carnegie started his efforts in pursuit of world peace at a young age,&lt;ref&gt;''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', Ch. 21, pp. 282–83&lt;/ref&gt; and supported causes that opposed [[military intervention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.americamagazine.org/arts-culture/2017/04/06/examining-american-peace-movement-prior-world-war-i | title=Examining the American peace movement prior to World War I| date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; His motto, "All is well since all grows better", served not only as a good rationalization of his successful business career, but also his view of international relations.

Despite his efforts towards international peace, Carnegie faced many dilemmas on his quest. These dilemmas are often regarded as conflicts between his view on international relations and his other loyalties. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, for example, Carnegie allowed his steel works to fill large orders of armor plate for the building of an enlarged and modernized United States Navy, but he opposed American oversea expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Carnegie, ''An American Four-in-Hand in Britain'' (New York, 1883), pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite that, Carnegie served as a major donor for than newly-established [[International Court of Arbitration]]'s [[Peace Palace]] - brainchild of Russian Tsar [[Nicolas II]].&lt;ref name="MoscowTimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gay|first1=Mark H|title=The Hague Peace Palace Keeps Tsar's Vision Alive|url=http://old.themoscowtimes.com/guides/eng/russia--holland-2013/488749/the-hague-peace-palace-keeps-tsars-vision-alive/508994.html|website=The Moscow Times|accessdate=August 8, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808232924/http://old.themoscowtimes.com/guides/eng/russia--holland-2013/488749/the-hague-peace-palace-keeps-tsars-vision-alive/508994.html|archivedate=August 8, 2016 |date=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His largest and in the long run most influential peace organization was the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], formed in 1910 with a $10 million endowment.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Patterson,"Andrew Carnegie's quest for world peace." ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 114.5 (1970): 371–83. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/985802 online]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, at the dedication of the Peace Palace in The Hague, Carnegie predicted that the end of war was ''as certain to come, and come soon, as day follows night.''&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Bruno Tertrais "The Demise of Ares: The End of War as We Know It?" ''The Washington Quarterly'', 35/3, (2012): p. 17.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, on the eve of the First World War, Carnegie founded the Church Peace Union (CPU), a group of leaders in religion, academia, and politics. Through the CPU, Carnegie hoped to mobilize the world's churches, religious organizations, and other spiritual and moral resources to join in promoting moral leadership to put an end to war forever. For its inaugural international event, the CPU sponsored a conference to be held on August 1, 1914, on the shores of Lake Constance in southern Germany. As the delegates made their way to the conference by train, Germany was invading Belgium.

Despite its inauspicious beginning, the CPU thrived. Today its focus is on ethics and it is known as the [[Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs]], an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, whose mission is to be the voice for ethics in international affairs.

The outbreak of the First World War was clearly a shock to Carnegie and his optimistic view on world peace. Although his promotion of [[anti-imperialism]] and world peace had all failed, and the Carnegie Endowment had not fulfilled his expectations, his beliefs and ideas on international relations had helped build the foundation of the [[League of Nations]] after his death, which took world peace to another level.

===US colonial expansion===
On the matter of [[American imperialism|American colonial expansion]], Carnegie had always thought it is an unwise gesture for the United States. He did not oppose the [[Newlands Resolution|annexation of the Hawaiian islands]] or [[Puerto Rico]], but he opposed the [[Philippine–American War|annexation of the Philippines]]. Carnegie believed that it involved a denial of the fundamental democratic principle, and he also urged [[William McKinley]] to withdraw American troops and allow the Filipinos to live with their independence.&lt;ref&gt;Carnegie, ''Americanism Versus Imperialism'', esp. pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; This act strongly impressed the other American anti-imperialists, who soon elected him vice-president of the Anti-Imperialist League.

After he sold his steel company in 1901, Carnegie was able to get fully involved in the peace cause, both financially and personally. He gave away much of his fortunes to various peace-keeping agencies in order to keep them growing. When his friend, the British writer [[William T. Stead]], asked him to create a new organization for the goal of a peace and arbitration society, his reply was:

{{quote|I do not see that it is wise to devote our efforts to creating another organization. Of course I may be wrong in believing that, but I am certainly not wrong that if it were dependent on any millionaire's money it would begin as an object of pity and end as one of derision. I wonder that you do not see this. There is nothing that robs a righteous cause of its strength more than a millionaire's money. Its life is tainted thereby.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Hendrick, B. J. (1932) ''The Life of Andrew Carnegie'', Vol.2, p. 337. Garden City, NY [https://books.google.com/books?id=qEwLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA376]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Carnegie believed that it is the effort and will of the people, that maintains the peace in international relations. Money is just a push for the act. If world peace depended solely on financial support, it would not seem a goal, but more like an act of pity.

Like Stead, he believed that the United States and the [[British Empire]] would merge into one nation, telling him "We are heading straight to the Re-United States". Carnegie believed that the combined country's power would maintain world peace and disarmament.&lt;ref name="stead1901"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/americanizationo01stea#page/406/mode/2up |title=The Americanization of the World |publisher=Horace Markley |author=Stead, W.T. |year=1901 |pages=406–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] in 1910 was regarded as a milestone on the road to the ultimate goal of abolition of war. Beyond a gift of $10 million for peace promotion, Carnegie also encouraged the "scientific" investigation of the various causes of war, and the adoption of judicial methods that should eventually eliminate them. He believed that the Endowment exists to promote information on the nations' rights and responsibilities under existing international law and to encourage other conferences to codify this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Patterson, David S. |title=Andrew Carnegie's Quest for World Peace|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|volume=114|issue=5|year=1970|pages=371–83|jstor=985802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
Carnegie was a frequent contributor to periodicals on labor issues. In addition to ''[[Triumphant Democracy]]'' (1886) and ''[[The Gospel of Wealth]]'' (1889), he also wrote ''Our Coaching Trip, Brighton to Inverness'' (1882), ''[[An American Four-in-hand in Britain]]'' (1883), ''[[Round the World]]'' (1884), ''[[The Empire of Business]]'' (1902), ''[[The Secret of Business is the Management of Men]]'' (1903),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hellenicamericancenterofthearts.blogspot.com/2015/02/andrew-carnegie.html|title=Hellenic American Center of the Arts: Andrew Carnegie|first=Hellenic American Center Of The|last=Arts|publisher=|date= 2-23-2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[James Watt (biography)|James Watt]]'' (1905) in the [[List of books for the "Famous Scots Series"|Famous Scots Series]], ''[[Problems of Today]]'' (1907), and his posthumously published ''Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie'' (1920).

===Benefactions===
According to biographer [[Burton J. Hendrick]]:
:His benefactions amounted to $350,000,000 – for he gave away not only his annual income of something more than $12,500,000, but most of the principal as well. Of this sum, $62,000,000 was allotted to the British Empire and $288,000,000 to the United States, for Carnegie, in the main, confined his benefactions to the English-speaking nations. His largest gifts were $125,000,000 to the Carnegie Corporation of New York (this same body also became his residuary legatee),  $60,000,000 to public library buildings, $20,000,000 to colleges (usually the smaller ones), $6,000,000 to church organs, $29,000,000 to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, $22,000,000 to the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh, $22,000,000 to the Carnegie Institution of Washington, $10,000,000 to Hero Funds, $10,000,000 to the Endowment for International Peace, $10,000,000 to the Scottish Universities Trust, $10,000,000 to the United Kingdom Trust, and $3,750,000 to the Dunfermline Trust.&lt;ref&gt;Burton J. Hendrick, "Carnegie, Andrew, 1835–1919" ''Dictionary of American Biography'' (1929) v. 3 p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendricks argues that:
:These gifts fairly picture Carnegie's conception of the best ways to improve the status of the common man. They represent all his personal tastes – his love of books, art, music, and nature – and the reforms which he regarded as most essential to human progress – scientific research, education both literary and technical, and, above all, the abolition of war. The expenditure the public most associates with Carnegie's name is that for public libraries. Carnegie himself frequently said that his favorite benefaction was the Hero Fund – among other reasons, because "it came up my ain back"; but probably deep in his own mind his library gifts took precedence over all others in importance. There was only one genuine remedy, he believed, for the ills that beset the human race, and that was enlightenment. "Let there be light" was the motto that, in the early days, he insisted on placing in all his library buildings. As to the greatest endowment of all, the Carnegie Corporation, that was merely Andrew Carnegie in permanently organized form; it was established to carry on, after Carnegie's death, the work to which he had given personal attention in his own lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Hendrick, "Carnegie, Andrew, 1835–1919"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research sources===
Carnegie's personal papers are at the [[Library of Congress]] Manuscript Division.
The Carnegie Collections of the Columbia University Rare Book and Manuscript Library consist of the archives of the following organizations founded by Carnegie: The [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] (CCNY); The [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] (CEIP); the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] (CFAT);The Carnegie Council on Ethics and International Affairs (CCEIA). These collections deal primarily with Carnegie philanthropy and have very little personal material related to Carnegie. [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and the [[Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh]] jointly administer the Andrew Carnegie Collection of digitized archives on Carnegie's life.

The '''Front of the Greek Anticapitalist Left''' ({{lang-el|Αντικαπιταλιστική Αριστερή Συνεργασία για την Ανατροπή, ΑΝΤ.ΑΡ.ΣΥ.Α.|translit=Antikapitalistiki Aristeri Synergasia gia tin Anatropi}}, ANT.AR.SY.A) is a coalition of radical left political organisations in [[Greece]]. The Greek word ανταρσία ''antarsia'' (which is pronounced the same as the backronym ''Antarsya'') means "mutiny". '''ANTARSYA''' describes itself as "Front of the anticapitalist, revolutionary, communist left and radical ecology".

ANTARSYA was founded on 22 March 2009 in Athens by 10 organisations and independent militants involved in the [[Radical Left Front]] (MERA) and [[United Anti-Capitalist Left]] (ENANTIA) with the exception of the [[Workers Revolutionary Party (Greece)|Workers Revolutionary Party]] (ΕΕΚ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Tassos Anastassiadis |url=http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article1594 |title=On January 31, the Greek anti-capitalist left will launch the perspective of its convergence! |publisher=[[International Viewpoint]] No. 408 - January 2009 |work= |date= |accessdate=2009-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organisations come from different left wing currents ranging from ex-[[Communist Party of Greece|Communist Party]] (KKE) and [[KKE Interior]] members to [[Maoism]] and [[Trotskyism]].

==Members==
The 7 organisations which are members of ANTARSYA:
* [[Alternative Ecologists]]
* [[Left Group]] (ARIS)
* [[New Left Current]] (NAR)
* [[Organization of Communist Internationalists of Greece–Spartacus]], Greek section of the [[Fourth International (Post-Reunification)|Fourth International]] (OKDE-Spartakos)
* [[Revolutionary Communist Movement of Greece]] (EKKE)
* [[Socialist Workers' Party (Greece)|Socialist Workers' Party]] (SEK)
* [[Youth of Communist Liberation]] (nΚΑ)

The [[Organization of Communist Internationalists of Greece]] ({{lang-el| Οργάνωση Κομμουνιστών Διεθνιστών Ελλάδας |translit=Organosi Kommouniston Diethniston Elladas}}), although it participated in the foundation of ANTARSYA, left the coalition shortly afterwards on 18 May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Οργάνωση Κομμουνιστών Διεθνιστών Ελλάδας|url=http://www.okde.gr/?p=439|script-title=el:Γιατί αποχωρήσαμε από την ΑΝΤΑΡΣΥΑ|date=18 May 2009|language=Greek|accessdate=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ANTARSYA is based on local assemblies of militants at city or neighbourhood-level with a central coordination committee in Athens. There are also periodically national assemblies of ANTARSYA.

[[Left Recomposition]] (ARAN) and [[Left Anti-capitalist Group]] (ARAS) were part of the coalition till August 2015.

==Ideology==

ANTARSYA calls for exiting the [[European Union]] and dropping the [[euro]] currency, defaulting on Greece's debt, and nationalization without compensation of major industries.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, S &amp; Cooper, L (2002) Beyond Capitalism?: The Future of Radical Politics&lt;/ref&gt; The party also calls for a banning of lay-offs, a [[Guaranteed minimum income|minimum salary]] of equivalent to 1,400 euros, a reduction of weekly working time to 35 hours without reduction of wages, the disarmament of the police, full political and social rights for immigrants, and an [[ecosocialism|ecosocialist]] answer to [[ecological crisis]].

==Popular support and electoral results==
ANTARSYA participated for the first time in elections in the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Greece)|European Parliament elections in June 2009]]. It took 21,951 votes or 0.43% of the votes, which was the best result ever for an anti-capitalist left list in European elections in Greece. ANTARSYA also participated in the [[Greek legislative election, 2009|October 4, 2009 general elections]] presenting lists in every constituency. With 24,737 votes and 0.36%, ANTARSYA obtained the best result for the anti-capitalist left in general elections in Greece since [[Metapolitefsi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Andreas Sartzekis |url=http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article1727 |title=Greece:The Right is routed in the legislative elections |publisher=[[International Viewpoint]] No. 417 - October 2009 |work=   |date= |accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It contested the [[Greek legislative election, September 2015]] in a joint campaign with the [[Workers Revolutionary Party (Greece)|Workers Revolutionary Party]] (EEK).&lt;ref&gt;http://redmed.org/article/eek-and-antarsya-join-forces-snap-elections-greece&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Euskal Presoen aldeko manifestaldia.jpg|thumb|Demonstration in [[Bilbao]] asking for the release of Basque political prisoners.]]
'''Askatasuna''' (from the [[Basque language|Basque]] word meaning freedom) is a [[Basque people|Basque]] political party registered on 31 August 1998, outlawed in 2009 by the Audiencia Nacional under the 2002 Political Parties Law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/02/17/espana/1234899554.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1998 several notable events occurred around the [[Ezker abertzalea|Basque nationalist left]]: the ''National Table'' of [[Herri Batasuna]] was jailed, the [[Pact of Estella]] was signed, [[Euskadi ta Askatasuna|ETA]] declared an indefinite truce and the electoral coalition [[Euskal Herritarrok]] presented itself to the [[Basque parliamentary election, 1998|Basque elections of the same year]]. Askatasuna was created that year by a small group of members of the [[Ezker abertzalea]] that feared the banning of the other political parties and organizations of the [[Basque nationalism|Basque national movement]].

Three years later, in May 2001, with a different situation since [[Euskadi ta Askatasuna|ETA]] had returned to commit deadly attacks, Askatasuna presented lists to the [[Basque parliamentary election, 2001|Basque elections]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|three provinces]]. Askatasuna barely campaigned and won a very meager percentage of votes (0.05%).

A month later, in June 2001, [[Euskal Herritarrok]] and [[Herri Batasuna]] created a new political party, [[Batasuna]], which in March 2003 was outlawed by the Supreme Court according to a new law on political parties, that allowed the banning of those political parties that were ''against the democratic regime of liberties'', supported violence and/or activities of terrorist groups.

Despite the outlawing of [[Batasuna]], Askatasuna continued to appear in the register of political parties and was in all respects a legal political formation, although since 2001 had not had any activity. This led some politicians and media communications analysts suggest that Askatasuna was being kept as a legal political brand that could eventually be used by [[Batasuna]] to present lists in future elections. In mid-January 2009, the press reported that Askatasuna wanted to participate in the [[Basque parliamentary election, 2009|Basque elections of 2009]]. The [[People's Party (Spain)|PP]] asked justice to monitor Askatasuna to see if it was the electoral brand of the outlawed [[Batasuna]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europapress.es/nacional/noticia-pp-pide-vigile-si-askatasuna-puede-ser-partido-politico-pantalla-batasuna-20090117184906.html&lt;/ref&gt; Askatasuna and [[Demokrazia Hiru Milioi]] (D3M)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europapress.es/nacional/noticia-fiscalia-prepara-recursos-impugnar-listas-d3m-askatasuna-supremo-20090121181538.html&lt;/ref&gt; were banned from the [[Basque parliamentary election, 2009|elections]] by the [[Supreme Court of Spain]] due to their alleged links to [[Euskadi ta Askatasuna|ETA]] and [[Batasuna]]. Soon later, both Askatasuna and [[Demokrazia Hiru Millioi]] were also banned as political parties an dissolved by the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/02/13/espana/1234479867.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 11, 2012, the [[Audiencia Nacional]] cleared the promoters Askatasuna considering that their activity did not involve "direct connection" with the purposes and methods of the terrorist organization [[Euskadi ta Askatasuna|ETA]]. The judgment recognized that Askatasuna "was the successor" of [[Herri Batasuna]], [[Euskal Herritarrok]] and [[Batasuna]], and therefore "had to be aware of their contribution to the succession of the outlawed parties"; but "has not been established that the accused, consciously and deliberately acted in support of the terrorist organization [[Euskadi ta Askatasuna|ETA]]" but exercised "political participation rights of those who are the owners and the exercise of which have not been suspended or disqualified.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1513898/0/listas/izquierda-abertzale/eta/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/06/18/actualidad/1340025797_847201.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6369">{{Segregation}}

'''Auto-segregation''' or '''self-segregation''' is the [[Separatism|separation]] of a [[religious]] or [[ethnic]] group from the rest of [[society]] in a [[Sovereign state|state]] by the group itself. This could also mean inability for a normal social interaction and a form of [[social exclusion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicaldaily.com/interracial-friendships-less-likely-self-segregation-more-common-larger-schools-245037 Interracial Friendships Less Likely, Self-Segregation More Common in Larger Schools], ''Medical Daily'', Apr 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

Through auto-segregation, the members of the separate group can establish their own services, and maintain their own [[tradition]]s and [[Norm (sociology)|customs]]. For example, some of the world's [[uncontacted peoples]] have preferred not to interact with the rest of the globally integrated human population. By remaining in a reserve and in isolation, they can preserve their [[culture]]s intact as long as they choose and the surrounding states protect them.

On the other hand, some groups self-segregate to avoid integrating with other groups, either to protect their culture or some may self-segregate from others that they consider intellectually and/or socially inferior. Nationalists (non-racists) or racists, [[ultranationalists]], other 'supremacist' or [[Ethnocentrism|ethno-centric]] groups commonly segregate themselves from other communities through various practices like [[endogamy]]. The [[apartheid]] system in South Africa was an example of this trend.

==Examples of auto-segregation==

=== Sweden ===
According to researcher Emma Neuman at [[Linnaeus University]], segregation sets in at population share around 3-4% of non-European migrants in a district, while European immigration shows no such trend. The study comprised the 12 largest [[municipalities of Sweden]] for the period 1990-2007. High income earners and highly educated move out of non-European migrant districts first where [[Racial segregation|ethnic segregation]] in turn leads to [[social segregation]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fof.se/tidning/2015/7/artikel/segregeringen-okar-i-sverige|title=Segregeringen ökar i Sverige|work=Forskning &amp; Framsteg|access-date=2017-12-02|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study at [[Örebro University]] concluded that while Swedish parents stated positive views towards the values of [[multiculturalism]], in practice they still chose Swedish-majority schools for their offspring so their children won't be an [[ethnic minority]] during their formative years and to get a good environment to develop their native Swedish language.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===United States===

In May 2017, black students at the University of California at Santa Cruz occupied one of the university’s administration buildings. They were demanding that the Rosa Parks House, a dormitory on campus, be painted black, red and green which are the colors of the [[Pan-African flag]].  Other demands included that only black students of Caribbean descent be guaranteed housing in that dormitory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/students-occupy-academic-building-at-uc-santa-cruz/vi-BBAIm8C Students occupy academic building at UC Santa Cruz], ‘’MSN’’, May 04, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the same month, students at Harvard University organized the school’s first all black commencement ceremony,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/harvard-university-black-commencement-700-students-guests-registered/ Hundreds of students, guests registered to attend Harvard's first Black Commencement, CBS News May 17, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; citing the need to highlight achievements made by black students and faculty.

Pundits argue that both of these events are examples of auto-segregation and compared them to the “[[Jim Crow]]” era&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow Laws]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}}  when the forced segregation of schools was legal in the United States. Prior to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], "[[separate but equal]]" housing and ceremonies were commonplace in America. Civil rights activists of the early 1960s, such as [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]], successfully marched in protest to abolish such segregation.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selma_to_Montgomery_marches Marches to End Segregation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endogamy as self-segregation==
{{main|Endogamy}}
Endogamy, the practice of marrying within a group, encourages group affiliation and bonding. It is a common practice among [[diaspora|displanted cultures]] attempting to make roots in new countries whilst still resisting complete integration, as it encourages group solidarity and ensures greater control over group resources (which may be important to preserve when a group is attempting to establish itself within an alien culture). 

However endogamy can also serve as a form of self-segregation and helps a community to resist integrating with surrounding populations. It thus helps minorities to survive as separate communities over a long time, in societies with other practices and beliefs.

Examples of ethno-religious groups with higher levels of endogamy that have successfully resisted cultural destruction and assimilation for centuries are the [[Romani people|Romani]] (colloquially referred to by non-members as "Gypsies"), the [[Ashkenazi]] Jews of Europe and the Americas and the Afrikaners of [[South Africa]].{{facts|date=May 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2772">The '''Campaign Against Censorship''' ('''CAC''') is a [[Pressure groups in the United Kingdom|non-party political pressure group]] that opposes [[censorship]] and promotes [[freedom of expression]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The group is based in [[Fareham]], [[England]]. It was formerly named the '''Defence of Literature and the Arts Society''' ('''DLAS'''). It was founded in 1968 with the publisher [[John Calder]] as a prime mover behind it{{sfn|Sutherland|1983|p=58}} as a direct result of the ''[[Last Exit to Brooklyn]]'' novel publication trial.{{sfn|Sutherland|1983|p=70}} In 1976 it sent a delegation to see the [[Home Secretary]] to argue that "films  are subject to unjust discrimination and should be placed on the same legal basis as books and plays as far as content is concerned", and that "the common law offences on indecency should come to an end".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Third Way|date=22 Sep 1977|publisher=Hymns Ancient &amp; Modern Ltd|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Id_dEF1rxjwC|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the group was relaunched as the Campaign Against Censorship.

The guiding principles of the Campaign are:
# The right to obtain and impart knowledge
# Freedom from censorship
# Freedom for creative artists to present their perceptions, interpretations and ideas
# Freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sex, sexual orientation, race, politics or religion.

Officers of the CAC are Edward Goodman (Chair) a lawyer and former local councillor, Dr Nigel Meek (Publications and Website Officer) and Mary Hayward (Hon. Secretary/Treasurer).

They have informal links with [[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]], [[Backlash (pressure group)|Backlash]] and the [[Open Rights Group]].  In recent years, the CAC has also made formal submissions to the Deputy Prime Minister’s 2010 Law Review and the 2013 proposals on press regulation. In December 2014, CAC absorbed the remnant of the late [[David Webb (anti-censorship campaigner)|David Webb]]'s [[National Campaign for the Reform of the Obscene Publications Acts]].

The '''Childers Reforms''' of 1881 reorganised the [[infantry]] [[regiment]]s of the [[British Army]]. The reforms were done by [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Hugh Childers]] during 1881, and were a continuation of the earlier [[Cardwell Reforms]].

The reorganisation was effected by General Order 41/1881, issued on 1 May 1881, amended by G.O. 70/1881 dated 1 July, which created a network of multi-[[battalion]] regiments. In England, Wales and Scotland, each regiment was to have two regular or "line" battalions and two [[Militia (United Kingdom)|militia]] battalions. In Ireland, there were to be two line and three militia battalions. This was done by renaming the numbered regiments of foot and county militia regiments. In addition, the various corps of county [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|rifle volunteers]] were to be designated as volunteer battalions. Each of these regiments was associated by headquarters location and territorial name to its local "Regimental District". The reforms became effective on 1 July.

From 1881, regimental seniority numbers were officially abolished and battalions came to be known by their number within the regiment and the regimental district name. Unofficially, the regiments were still referred to by their numbers by their officers and men, as tradition, and several regiments, such as "[[Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment)|The Buffs]]" (The Royal East Kent Regiment), [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders|The Cameron Highlanders]], and "[[42nd Regiment of Foot|The Black Watch]]", lobbied to keep their distinct names as part of their battalion titles.

In practice, it was not always possible to apply the scheme strictly: the Cameron Highlanders initially had only one regular battalion, while several regiments had more or fewer militia regiments than specified by the initial scheme. In addition, the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] and the [[Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)]] had no local regimental districts, and their affiliated militia and volunteer battalions were selected not on a territorial basis, but due to their "rifle" traditions. This structure lasted until 1948, when every regiment of [[line infantry]] had its regular battalions decreased to one, with only the three original [[Guards Division]] regiments retaining two regular battalions.

That same year, short service was increased to seven years with the colours, and five with the reserve, of the twelve-year enlistment period that the [[Cardwell Reforms#Army Enlistment Act|Cardwell Reforms]] had introduced.{{sfn|Raugh|2004|p=298}}{{sfn|Skelley|1977}}

==Standardisation of uniforms and colours==
For reasons of economy and efficiency, an attempt was made to have the [[facings]] of uniforms standardised: English and Welsh regiments would have white facings, Irish regiments would wear green facings, Scottish regiments would have yellow facings, and royal regiments would have dark blue facings. Officers' uniforms had lace in distinctive national patterns: [[Tudor rose|rose]] pattern for England and Wales, [[thistle]] for Scotland and [[shamrock]] for Ireland. In the case of regular battalions, the lace was gold, while that of the militia battalions was silver. There were also attempts to assimilate regimental insignia and remove "tribal" uniform distinctions. This was less successful, as regimental tribalism and tradition caused much criticism. Two regiments that displayed a strong reaction were the [[75th Regiment of Foot|75th]] and the [[92nd Regiment of Foot|92nd]] that were grudgingly joined together to become the [[Gordon Highlanders]]. The 75th went so far as commissioning a marble monument to themselves in Malta where they were based at the time. They had spent so long away from Scotland that they were effectively an English unit that had to relearn how to wear kilts. The 92nd, though they lost much less identity in the amalgamation, staged a mock funeral procession to themselves, complete with a full-size coffin with the number '92' on it.

During 1890, The Buffs succeeded in being allowed to resume the wearing of buff facings, initially at regimental expense and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gregory|last=Blaxland|page=21|title=The Buffs|ISBN=0-85045-064-0|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few years, a number of other regiments had replaced white facings with traditional colours. After 1935, the ruling on blue facings for royal regiments effectively lapsed. That year, in celebration of his [[silver jubilee]], [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] designated three regiments as royal. In each case, they were ''"permitted to retain their present facings"''.&lt;ref&gt;Honours for the army - new royal regiments, ''The Times'', 3 June 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; During 1939, The Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, who had worn blue facings since 1881, were issued buff regimental colours ''"by request and gracious permission"''.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hamilton, "Colours of the Regular Army Infantry of the Line 1st July 1881 to 1958", ''Bulletin of the Military Historical Society'' Special Issue No.1, London, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, three more infantry regiments were designated as "royal" for services during [[World War II]]. Of these, only the [[Royal Lincolnshire Regiment]] replaced its (white) facings with blue.&lt;ref&gt;Royal corps and regiments - war service honours, ''The Times'', 10 December 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Berwickshire, Dumfriesshire, Roxburghshire and Selkirkshire were transferred to the regimental district of the King's Own Scottish Borderers district 1887.

† Huntingdonshire was originally included in the regimental district of the Suffolk Regiment. There were no volunteer units recruited in the county from 1889 until 1900, when the 4th (Huntingdonshire) Volunteer Battalion, The Bedfordshire Regiment was formed. In 1908, it became part of the 5th Battalion of the Bedfords. In 1914, the Huntingdonshire companies were transferred to a newly formed [[Huntingdonshire Cyclist Battalion]], affiliated to The Northamptonshire Regiment. The successors to the cyclist unit continued to be part of the Northamptons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vinf-ea/hg-cycl.htm The Huntingdonshire Battalion (Regiments.org)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721170842/http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/volmil-england/vinf-ea/hg-cycl.htm |date=21 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

‡ It was originally proposed to disband the Royal Irish Fusiliers during 1922. However, the 2nd battalion of that regiment and of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers were disbanded instead. During 1924, the two regiments formed a single "corps" sharing a depot and regimental district consisting of Counties Armagh, Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone. In 1937, the regiments were again separated, with each forming a second battalion the next year.

==Later changes==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}
Between 1897 and 1900, the regular army was increased in size in response to a number of conflicts, especially the [[Second Boer War]]. The Cameron Highlanders raised a second battalion, while third and fourth regular battalions were added to the Northumberland Fusiliers, Warwickshire Regiment, Royal Fusiliers, King's (Liverpool Regiment), Lancashire Fusiliers, Worcestershire Regiment, Middlesex Regiment and the Manchester Regiment. The recruiting areas of each of these regiments included parts of large conurbations.

The [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]] reformed the reserve forces during 1908. A number of militia battalions were disbanded with the remainder being transferred to a new Special Reserve. At the same time, the volunteer battalions became part of the new [[Territorial Force]], and were redesignated as numbered battalions of the regiments.

The army was expanded for the duration of the [[First World War]], with the territorial battalions being duplicated and numerous war-time service battalions being formed.

During 1921 - 1922, the system was somewhat changed: the special reserve battalions were reorganized and a number of Irish regiments were disbanded on the creation of the [[Irish Free State]]. All remaining regiments were reduced to two regular battalions.

During the [[Second World War]], regiments were again expanded, although not to the same extent as for the previous conflict.

After the independence of [[India]] during 1947, regiments lost their second battalion, although some were reformed temporarily for the [[Korean War]].

The system introduced during 1881 finally ended with the reforms introduced by the [[1957 Defence White Paper|Defence White Paper of 1957]]. A number of pairs of regiments were amalgamated, while regimental depots were closed with recruiting and training being organised in multi-regiment brigades.

'''Comités Abertos de Estudantes''' ('''CAE''', ''Students Open Committees'' in English) was a [[Galician nationalism|Galician nationalist]] and left-wing [[students' union|student union]], formed by high school, ''bachillerato'' and ''professional formation'' students. On May 10, 2008, CAE dissolved itself to form, along with the [[Comités Abertos de Faculdade]] (CAF), a new student union, [[Comités]].

The organization was founded in 1990 as an extension to the middle school of the [[Comités Abertos de Faculdade|CAF]] project, coinciding with the elections to the Galician School Board.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2865">'''Compartmentalization''', in [[information security]], whether public or private, is the limiting of access to information to persons or other entities on a [[need-to-know]] basis to perform certain tasks.

It originated in the handling of [[classified information]] in [[military]] and [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] applications. It dates back to [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], and was successfully used to keep the secret of [[Greek fire]].{{sfn|Roland|1992|pp=663–664}}

The basis for compartmentalization is the idea that, if fewer people know the details of a mission or task, the risk or likelihood that such information will be compromised or fall into the hands of the opposition is decreased. Hence, varying levels of clearance within organizations exist. Yet, even if someone has the highest clearance, certain "compartmentalized" information, identified by [[code name|codeword]]s referring to particular types of secret information, may still be restricted to certain operators, even with a lower overall security clearance. Information marked this way is said to be '''codeword–classified'''. One famous example of this was the [[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]] secret, where documents were marked "Top Secret Ultra": "Top Secret" marked its security level, and the "Ultra" keyword further restricted its readership to only those cleared to read "Ultra" documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SE-08.pdf|title=Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems, First Edition, Chapter 8.2: Compartmentation, the Chinese Wall, and the BMA Model|author=Ross Anderson|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compartmentalization is now also used in commercial [[security engineering]] as a technique to protect information such as [[medical record]]s.

==Example==
An example of compartmentalization was the [[Manhattan Project]]. Personnel at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]] constructed and operated [[gas centrifuge|centrifuges]] to isolate [[uranium-235]] from naturally occurring uranium, but most did not know exactly what they were doing. Those that knew did not know why they were doing it. Parts of the weapon were separately designed by teams who did not know how the parts interacted.

A '''complaint system''' (also known as a '''conflict management system''', '''internal conflict management system''', '''integrated conflict management system''',&lt;ref&gt;See Lynch, below{{full|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''dispute system''') is a set of procedures used in organizations to address complaints and resolve disputes. Complaint systems in the US have undergone several innovations especially since about 1970 with the advent of extensive workplace regulation. Notably in many countries, conflict management channels and systems have evolved from a major focus on labor-management relations to a much wider purview that includes [[labor union|unionized]] workers and also managers, non-union employees, professional staff, students, trainees, vendors, donors, customers, etc.

==History==

There is a substantial early history of scholarly work on [[due process]], and union and non-union [[grievance]] procedures within organizations. This work focused primarily on [[rights]]-based [[conflict resolution]] between union and non-union workers and their managers. Scholarly work has evolved to cover both a wider range of conflict management channels, and, also, a much wider range of disputants.

In the 1970s and 1980s much interest arose in the United States, in dealing with conflict informally as well as formally, and in learning from conflict and managing conflict. In contemporary language, these discussions centered on the "interests" of all who would consider themselves stake-holders in a given conflict—and on systems change—as well as resolving grievances.

These discussions led to questions of how to think about complaint systems and how to link different conflict management offices and processes within an organization. Papers by Ronald Berenbeimmason djordje bentions.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Berenbeim, Non-union Complaint Systems: A Corporate Appraisal (NY: The Conference Board, Report No 770, 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary P. Rowe, PhD, "Are You Hearing Enough Employee Concerns?" with Michael Baker, in Harvard Business Review, Vol. 62, No. 3, (May–June, 1984), pp. 127–136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary P. Rowe, "The Non-Union Complaint System at MIT: An Upward-Feedback Mediation Model," in Alternatives to the High Cost of Litigation, Vol. 2, No. 4, (April, 1984), pp. 10–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many authors extended the work of Berenbeim, Rowe, and Rowe and Baker, on the topic of internal complaint systems. They included: Douglas M. McCabe,&lt;ref&gt;"Corporate Non-union Complaint Procedures and Systems" (NY: Praeger, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; [[William L. Ury]], Jeanne M. Brett, and Stephen B. Goldberg.&lt;ref&gt;Ury, William J., Jeanne M. Brett, and Stephen B. Goldberg, Getting Disputes Resolved: Designing Systems to Cut the Costs of Conflict, the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, MA (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; (Ury, Brett and Goldberg in particular described conflict resolution within organizations in terms of interests, rights and power and the possibility of looping back from rights-based processes to interest-based solutions.) Cathy Costantino and Cristina S Merchant,&lt;ref&gt;Costantino, C. and C.S. Merchant. 1996, Designing conflict management systems. San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt; and Karl A. Slaikeu and Ralph H. Hasson&lt;ref&gt;Slaikeu. K.A. and R.H. Hasson. 1998. Controlling the costs of conflict: How to design a system for your organization. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; extensively explored issues of designing conflict management systems.

The concept of an ''integrated'' conflict management system was conceived and developed by Mary Rowe, in numerous articles in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;See http://web.mit.edu/ombud/publications/ for a list&lt;/ref&gt; She saw the need to offer options for complainants and therefore a linked system of choices within an organizational system.&lt;ref&gt;See "People Who Feel Harassed Need a Complaint System with both Formal and Informal Options" in ''Negotiation Journal'', April, 1990, Vol. 6, No. 2, pp. 161–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a systems approach has endured well. In recent years however, there has been discussion as to whether conflict should be "managed" by the organization—or whether the goal is to understand, deal with and learn from conflict. There is also concern about practical and theoretical issues in "integrating" a system, with some observers{{Who|date=November 2010}} preferring the idea of "coordinating" a conflict system. However 2012 research by David Lipsky ''et al.'', suggests that an increasing number of corporations see themselves as having "integrated conflict management systems," or "ICMS."

There is also a major need{{According to whom|date=November 2010}} to collect, review and understand the nature of conflict management and complaint systems around the world. Studies and citations are needed about how complaint systems work for women as well as men. Research is needed as to how systems work for many different national groups, for people of different socio-economic classes, and different ages, and different religions, and especially for contract workers and immigrant workers, in every country. Studies (and citations) are needed about complaint systems in health care, in faith-based organizations, in schools, in political organizations, in the military and in many specialized occupations. Studies are needed{{According to whom|date=November 2010}} about important specialized issues like free speech.

A number of [[artificial intelligence]] technologies are helpful in complaint resolution process, understanding the attitudes of involved parties and reasoning about them, in particular, based on the [[belief–desire–intention model]]. Concept learning is an adequate formalism to reason about complaints.&lt;ref&gt;Boris Galitsky, B. and Josep Lluis de la Rosa ''"Concept-based learning of human behavior for customer relationship management"'' [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025510004007 Information Sciences] Volume 181, Issue 10, 15 May 2011, pp 2016-2035 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010''' ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/contents c 25]) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] on [[UK constitutional law]] which affected the [[civil service]] and the ratification of [[treaty|treaties]], and made other significant changes. It extends to all parts of the United Kingdom. 

==Commencements==
The Act was passed on 8 April 2010, in the last days of [[Premiership of Gordon Brown#2010 general election|Gordon Brown's]] premiership, and before the change of government that resulted from the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|general election]] on 6 May. Part 4 (tax status of MPs and members of the House of Lords) came into force immediately on the passing of the Act. Some of the Act's provisions were brought into force in April or May 2010 by a commencement order made on 15 April 2010 by [[Bridget Prentice]], Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State ([[Ministry of Justice]]).&lt;ref&gt;The Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 (Commencement No. 1) Order 2010
[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/1277/pdfs/uksi_20101277_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ministers of the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|incoming government]] made commencement orders for the Act's transitional and other provisions. [[Francis Maude]], [[Minister for the Cabinet Office]] made the commencement order for Parts 1 (the civil service),  2 (ratification of treaties) and 5 (transparency of government financial reporting to Parliament) to come into force on 11 November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;The Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 (Commencement No. 3) Order 2010.[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/2703/article/2/made#article-2-a]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treaty ratification===
With regard to parliamentary approval for the ratification of treaties, the Act gave the [[Ponsonby Rule]] a statutory footing, but did not place the [[declaration of war]] and the deployment of the British armed forces onto a similar statutory footing, as was first intended when the bill came to Parliament, leaving them instead to the [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|royal prerogative]], as before. 

In [[Divisional court (England and Wales)|divisional court]] proceedings in the High Court of England and Wales, concerning the use of the royal prerogative for the issue of notification in accordance with [[Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union]] (the Lisbon Treaty) (''[[R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]]''), the [[John Thomas, Baron Thomas of Cwmgiedd|Lord Chief Justice]] described the statutory procedure in Part 2 of the Act as "of critical importance".&lt;ref&gt;Transcript, 18 October 2016, p. 5.[https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brexit181016-all-day.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil service===
The Act put [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|the civil service]] on a statutory footing for the first time. Its provisions include the establishment of a [[Civil Service Commission]] and a power for the [[Minister for the Civil Service]] to manage the civil service, and it provides for a requirement that appointments to the civil service are to be made on merit on the basis of fair and open competition. It also requires the Minister for the Civil Service to publish a code of conduct which provides that [[Special advisers (UK government)|a special adviser]] (defined in section 15) may not authorise the expenditure of public funds, or exercise any power in relation to the management of any part of the civil service, or exercise any power under the royal prerogative; but the Act expressly states that the code need not require special advisers to carry out their duties with objectivity or impartiality.

The [[Institute for Government]]'s publication ''Legislating for a Civil Service'' (2013) questioned the extent to which the Act had changed anything in practice, and commented that the legislation did not set out much about the structure or practice of Whitehall, unlike the Westminster-style systems of [[Australian Public Service|Australia]], [[Public Service of Canada|Canada]] and [[Public sector organisations in New Zealand#Public service departments|New Zealand]], where more of how their civil services work was codified. It mentioned that, while all four systems have a commission to regulate appointments to the civil service, in Australia, for example, the specific text of the code of conduct is set out in primary legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Government, ''Legislating for a Civil Service'' (2013), p.2.[http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/Legislating%20for%20a%20civil%20service.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===FOI exemption for royal family===
Provisions of the Act that amended the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] came into force on 19 January 2011. The commencement order was made by [[Kenneth Clarke]] ([[Ministry of Justice]]). It made information relating to communications with the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|sovereign]], [[Succession to the British throne|the heir or the second in line]] to the throne subject to an absolute exemption from disclosure, and made information relating to communications with other members of the [[British Royal Family|royal family]] or the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|royal household]] subject to a qualified exemption.&lt;ref&gt;The Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 (Commencement No. 4 and Saving Provision) Order 2011, and 
Explanatory Note.[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/46/pdfs/uksi_20110046_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other provisions===
A commencement order for transitional provisions was made in July 2010 by [[Mark Harper]], (Parliamentary Secretary, Minister for Political and Constitutional Reform, in the [[Cabinet Office]]).&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 (Commencement No. 2 and Transitional Provisions) Order 2010 (SI 2010/1931)[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/1931/pdfs/uksi_20101931_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Sections in Part 3 of the Act, for amending the [[Parliamentary Standards Act 2009]], were brought into force in April or May 2010. &lt;ref&gt;The Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 (Commencement No. 1) Order 2010[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/1277/pdfs/uksi_20101277_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the provisions concerning the tax status of members of either the House of Commons or the House of Lords (ss. 41 and 42 in Part 4), some of the [[Lords Temporal|lords temporal]] lost their seats in the [[House of Lords| upper house]]. The Act requires members of the [[House of Lords]] to be domiciled in the United Kingdom for tax purposes. At least five were known to have quit their Lords seats to keep [[Taxation in the United Kingdom#Examples of non-dom status|non-dom status]],

'''Crisis intervention''' is an immediate and short-term [[psychology|psychological]] care aimed at assisting individuals in a crisis situation in order to restore equilibrium to their bio-psycho-social functioning and to minimize the potential of long-term [[psychological trauma]].&lt;ref name="Jackson-Cherry-Erford"&gt;Jackson-Cherry, L.R., &amp; Erford, B.T. (2010). Crisis intervention and prevention. NJ: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aguilera, D.C. (1998). ''Crisis Intervention. Theory and Methodology.'' Mosby, St Louis.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Crisis situations can be in the form of natural disasters, severe physical injury, sudden death of a loved one, and specific emotional crises as a result of drastic transitions such as divorce, children leaving home, pregnancy, family and school violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=People in crisis: Clinical and diversity perspectives|last=Hoff|first=L.|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The priority of crisis intervention and counseling is to hasten the process of and achieve stabilization. Crisis interventions must be applied at the spur of the moment and in a variety of settings, as trauma can arise instantaneously. 

== Crisis ==
[[File:Non-violent-crisis-prevention.JPG|thumb|An example of a crisis situation.&lt;!-- Need some explanation as to what is happening here that makes this a crisis situation. --&gt;]]
Crises can occur on a personal or [[societal]] level. Personal trauma is defined as an individual's experience of a situation or event in which he/she perceives to have exhausted his/her coping skill, [[self-esteem]], [[social support]], and power. These can be situations where a person is making suicidal threats, experiencing threat, witnessing homicide or suicide, or experiencing personal loss. While a person is experiencing a crisis on the individual level it is important for counselors to primarily assess safety. Counselors are encouraged to ask questions pertaining to social supports and networks, as well as give referrals for long term care.&lt;!-- need citation --&gt;

Societal or mass trauma can occur in a number of settings and typically affects a large group or society such as school shoot-outs, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters. A counselor's primary concern when called to these types of crises is to assess people's awareness of [[resources]]. Individuals experiencing trauma in a large scale need to be aware of shelters that offer food and water and places that meet their basic necessities for survival.&lt;ref&gt;Landau, J., Mittal, M., &amp; Wieling, E. (2008). Linking human systems: strengthening individuals, families, and communities in the wake of mass trauma. Journal of Marital and Family Therapy, 34(2), 193-209&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs of crisis ==

Counselors are encouraged to be aware of the typical responses of those who have experienced a crisis or are currently struggling with a trauma. On the cognitive level, they may blame themselves or others for the trauma. Often, the person appears disoriented, becomes hypersensitive or confused, has poor concentration, uncertain, and poor troubleshooting capabilities. Physical responses to trauma include increased heart rate, tremors, dizziness, weakness, chills, headaches, vomiting, shock, fainting, sweating, and fatigue. Among the common emotional responses of people who experience crisis in their lives include apathy, depression, [[irritability]], [[anxiety]], [[panic]], helplessness, hopelessness, [[anger]], [[fear]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], and denial. When assessing behavior, some typical responses to crisis are difficulty eating and/or sleeping, conflicts with others, withdrawal and lack of interest in social activities.&lt;ref name="Jackson-Cherry-Erford"/&gt;

== Universal principles ==

There are five basic principles outlined for intervention for individuals dealing with personal and societal crisis:

* Prompt intervention – Since victims are initially at high risk for maladaptive coping or immobilization. providing intervention as quickly as possible is imperative. Resource mobilization should be immediately enacted in order to provide victims with the tools they need to return to some sort of order and normalcy, in addition to enable independent functioning. 
* Facilitate comprehension – processing the situation or trauma is necessary in order for the sufferer to understand what the traumatic event was all about. This is done in order to help the victim gain a better understanding of what has occurred and allowing him or her to express feelings about the experience. 
* Problem-solving – The counselor should assist the victim(s) in resolving the issue within the context of their situation and feelings. This is necessary for developing [[self-efficacy]] and [[Individualism|self-reliance]]. 
* Return to normalcy – counselor must help the victim get back to being able to function independently by actively facilitating problem solving, assisting him/her in developing appropriate strategies for addressing those concerns, and in helping putting those strategies into action. This is done in hopes of enabling the victim to become [[self-reliant]].&lt;ref&gt;Flannery, R.B., &amp; Everly, G.S. (2000). Crisis intervention: a review. Internal Journal of Emergency Mental Health, 2(2), 119–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

== General approach ==

A general approach of crisis intervention integrates numerous [[Psychological assessment|assessment]] tools and triage procedures. '''Roberts' 7-Stage Crisis Intervention Model''', '''SAFER-R Model''' and '''Lerner and Shelton's 10-step acute stress &amp; trauma management protocol''' creates one comprehensive model for responding to crisis that can be utilized in crisis situations.

The ACT ('''A'''ssessment '''C'''risis Intervention '''T'''rauma Treatment) model of crisis intervention developed by Roberts as a response to the September 11, 2001 tragedy outlines a three-stage framework.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;Roberts, A. (2006). Assessment, crisis intervention, and trauma treatment: the integrative act intervention model. Brief Treatment and Crisis Intervention, 2(1), 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt; 
This tool is a guide and not to be followed rigidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=AR|date=2005|title=Crisis Intervention Handbook: Assessment, Treatment, and Research|url=|journal=The British Journal of Social Work|volume=36|pages=157|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first step is the assessment stage; this is done by determining the needs of victims, other involved persons, survivors, their families, and grieving family members of possible victim(s) and making appropriate referrals when needed.

'''These are the three types of assessments that need to be conducted:'''&lt;ref&gt;Everly &amp; Mitchell, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
# Triage assessment - an immediate assessment to determine lethality and determine appropriate referral to one of the following: emergency inpatient hospitalization, outpatient treatment facility or private therapist, or if no referral is needed;
# Crisis assessment - consists of gathering information regarding the individual's crisis state, environment, and interpersonal relationships to be used in working towards resolving the current crisis. This step helps facilitate development of an effective and appropriate treatment plan.
#Biosocial and [[cultural]] assessment - systematic assessment tools are used to ascertain the client's current levels of stress, situation, present problem, and severe crisis episode.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, J.A. (2002). Moving forward from September 11: a stress/crisis/trauma response model. Brief Treatment and Crisis Intervention, 2, 55-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the crisis intervention stage of '''Roberts' ACT model''' is to resolve the client's present problems, [[Stress (biology)|stress]], [[psychological trauma]], and emotional conflicts. This is to be done with a minimum number of contacts, as crisis intervention is intended to be time-limited and goal-directed.

1. '''Intake and Assessing the person who is in Crisis/Suffering from the aftereffects of Crisis'''

Stage one of the seven step approach focuses on assessing lethality. The clinician is to plan and conduct a thorough biopsychosocial and lethality/imminent danger assessment; this should be done promptly at the time of arrival. Once lethality is determined one should establish rapport with the victim(s) whom the clinician will be working with.

2. '''Exploring the Crisis Situation of the person'''

The next phase is to identify major problem(s), including what in their life has led to the crisis at hand. During this stage it is important that the client is given the control and power to discuss their story in his or her own words.

3. '''Understanding the Coping Style employed by the person'''

While he or she is describing the situation, the intervention specialist should develop a conceptualization of the client's "modal coping style", which will most likely need adjusting as more information unfolds. This is referred to as stage three.

4. '''Confronting Feelings, Exploring Emotions and Challenging the Maladaptive Coping Style'''

As a transition is made to stage four, feelings will become prevalent at this time, so dealing with those feelings will be an important aspect of the intervention. While managing the feelings, the counselor must allow the client(s) to express his or her story, and explore feelings and emotions through active listening and validation. Eventually, the counselor will have to work carefully to respond to the client using challenging responses in order to help him or her work past maladaptive beliefs and thoughts, and to think about other options.

5. '''Exploring Solutions and Educating the client in best practices of Coping'''

At step five, the victim and counselor should begin to collaboratively generate and explore alternatives for coping. Although this situation will be unlike any other experience before, the counselor should assist the individual in looking at what has worked in the past for other situations; this is typically the most difficult to achieve in crisis counseling.

6. '''Developing a concrete treatment plan/structure of activities and Reassuring the clients newly gained healthy perspective'''

Once a list has been generated, a shift can be made to step six: development of a treatment plan that serves to empower the client. The goal at this stage it to make the treatment plan as concrete as possible which could be followed by the client and implemented as an attempt to make meaning out of the crisis event. Having meaning of the situation is also an important part of this stage because it allows for gaining mastery.

7. '''Follow-Up'''

Step seven is for the intervention specialist to arrange for follow-up contact with the client to evaluate his or her post crisis condition in order to make certain resolution towards progressing. The follow-up plan may include "booster" sessions to explore treatment gains and potential problems.&lt;ref name="Roberts"/&gt;

'''SAFER-R Model'''

The SAFER-R Model is a much used model of intervention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipa-usa.org/|title=International Police Association (IPA)|publisher=.ipa-usa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Roberts 7 Stage Crisis Intervention Model. The model approaches crisis intervention as an instrument to help the client to achieve his or her baseline level of functioning from the state of crisis. This intervention model for responding to individuals in crisis consists of 5+1 stages.

'''Lerner and Shelton's 10 step acute stress &amp; trauma management protocol'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaets.org/ten%20stages%20atsm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive view of how to treat the trauma consists of ten stages outlined by Lerner and Shelton (2001). These 10 steps relate similar to the crisis intervention steps. 
*The first step is to assess for danger/safety for self and others, this means for the victim, counselor, and others who may have been affected by the trauma. 
*Then consider the physical and perceptual mechanisms of injury. 
*Once injury is assessed the victim's level of responsiveness should be evaluated.
*If any medical needs are there, it should be addressed. 
*The individual who witnessed or is experiencing a crisis, should be observed to identify his or her signs of traumatic stress. 
*After the assessment of the situation is completed the counselor should introduce his or her self, state their title and role, and connect with the individual by building rapport. 
*A good rapport building allows for a more fluid approach in grounding the individual, this can be done by allowing the client/person to tell their story. 
*The interventionist provides support through active and empathetic listening, 
*Normalize, validate, and educate the individuals emotions, stress and adaptive coping styles.
*Finally, the intervention specialist is to bring the person to the present, describe future events, and provide referrals as needed.

After the crisis situation has been assessed and crisis interventions have been applied, the aim is at eliminating stress symptoms, thus treating the traumatic experience.

== Non-violent approach ==

Non-violent approach in crisis intervention for agitation management involves better understanding of Proxemics (Personal space of a person) and Kinesics (Nonverbal communication through postures).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crisisprevention.com/CPI/media/Media/Resources/webinar/eRefresher2012/eRefresher-2012-Part2/Key-Point-Refresher-SAMPLE.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It helps to reduce anxiety, escalations and disruptions in agitated incidents and reduces use of restraints by 25%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=f_HYjDUArkMC&amp;pg=PA50 Restraint and Seclusion], Joint Commission Resources, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

When using crisis intervention methods for the disabled individual, every effort should first be made to first find other, preventative methods, such as giving adequate physical, occupational and speech therapy, and communication aides including sign language and Augmentative Communication systems, behavior and other plans, in order to first help the handicapped individual to be able to express their needs and function better.  Too often, crisis intervention methods including restraining holds are used without first giving the disabled more and better therapies or educational assistance.  Often school districts, for example, may use crisis prevention holds and "Interventions" against disabled children without first giving services and supports (at least 75% of cases of restraint and seclusion reported to the Department of Education involved disabled children in the 2011-12 school year.)  Also, school districts fail to inform parents about their disabled child's "intervention" with restraint or seclusion, thereby providing little, if any, opportunity for the family to help the disabled child recover.   Congress is trying to curtail the use of restraint and seclusion by school districts, having proposed legislation "Keeping All Students Safe Act" which had bi-partisan support but the bill has repeatedly died in committee.  It will be re-introduced in 2015 by Senator Chris Murphy (CT).  Critical incident [[debriefing]] is a widespread approach to counseling those in a state of crisis. This technique is done in a group setting 24–72&amp;nbsp;hours after the event occurred, and is typically a one-time meeting that lasts 3–4&amp;nbsp;hours, but can be done over numerous sessions if needed. [[Debriefing]] is a process by which facilitators describe various symptoms related [[PTSD]] and other [[anxiety]] disorders that individuals are likely to experience due to exposure to a trauma. As a group they process negative emotions surrounding the traumatic event. Each member is encouraged continued participation in treatment so that symptoms do not become exacerbated.&lt;ref&gt;Lilienfeld, S.O. (2007). Psychological treatments that cause harm. perspectives on psychological science, 2(1), 53-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical incident debriefing has been criticized by many for its effectiveness on reducing harm in crisis situations. Some studies show that those exposed to debriefing are actually more likely to show symptoms of [[PTSD]] at a 13-month follow-up than those who are not exposed to the debriefing. Most recipients of debriefing reported that they found the intervention helpful. Based on symptoms found in those who received no treatment at all, some critics state that reported improvement is considered a misattribution, and that the progress would naturally occur without any treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Regehr, C. (2001). Crisis debriefing groups for emergency responders: reviewing the evidence. Brief Treatment and Crisis Intervention, 1, 87-100.

'''Cyber sovereignty''' is a phrase used in the field of internet governance to describe governments' desire to exercise control over the Internet within their own borders, including political, economic, cultural and technological activities. In his 2015 book ''[[Data and Goliath]]'', American security expert [[Bruce Schneier]] says the cyber sovereignty movement, in countries such as [[Russia]], [[China]], [[France]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], was given an enormous boost by the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|2013 revelations of widespread international NSA surveillance]], which those countries pointed to as justification for their activities and evidence of U.S. hypocrisy on Internet freedom issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Data and Goliath: The Hidden Battles to Collect Your Data and Control Your World|last = Schneier|first = Bruce|publisher = W.W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2659">The '''Duggan–Schwartz theorem''' (named after [[John Duggan (political scientist)|John Duggan]] and [[Thomas Schwartz (political scientist)|Thomas Schwartz]]) is a result about [[voting system]]s designed to choose a nonempty set of winners from the preferences of certain individuals, where each individual ranks all candidates in order of preference. It states that for three or more candidates, at least one of the following must hold:

#The system is not anonymous (some voters are treated differently from others).
#The system is imposed (some candidates can never win).
#Every voter's top preference is in the set of winners.
#The system can be manipulated by either an optimistic voter, one who can cast a ballot that would elect some candidate better than all of those elected by voting honestly; or by a pessimistic voter, one who can cast a ballot that would exclude some candidate worse than all of those elected by voting strategically.

The first two conditions are considered forbidden in any fair election, and the third condition requires many candidates to "tie" for the win. The general conclusion, then, is the same as that usually given to the [[Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem]]: voting systems can be manipulated. The result essentially holds even if ties are allowed in the ballots; in that case, there exists at least one "weak dictator" such that at least one of the candidates tied at the top of that voter's ballot is a winner.

The Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem is a similar theorem that deals with voting systems that elect a single winner. Likewise, [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] deals with voting systems that yield a complete preference order of the candidates, rather than choosing only winners.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5812">'''"Einheitsfrontlied"''', literally meaning '''"United Front Song"''', is one of the most famous songs of the German [[labour movement]]. It was written by [[Bertolt Brecht]] and composed by [[Hanns Eisler]]. The best-known rendition was sung by [[Ernst Busch (actor)|Ernst Busch]].

== History ==
After [[Hitler]]'s coming to power in January, 1933, the situation for left-wing movements in [[Germany]] drastically deteriorated. The antagonism between the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] and the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] had long made the German left divided. After the [[Nazis]] banned both parties and labour unions in the summer of 1933, many people, including Bertolt Brecht, realized that only a [[united front]] of [[social democrats]] and [[communists]] could fight back against [[fascism]]. In 1934, at the request of fellow theatre director [[Erwin Piscator]], Brecht wrote the "Einheitsfrontlied", calling for all workers to join the ''Arbeiter-Einheitsfront'', Workers’ United Front. The song was performed the next year in the First International Musical Olympiad held in [[Strasbourg]] by a choir of 3,000 workers. Its first record was printed in 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], performed by communist actor and singer Ernst Busch.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Bertolt Brecht|Title=Ausgewählte Werke in 6 Bänden|Volume=3|Publisher=Suhrkamp|Year=1997|At=p.&amp;nbsp;472|Date=   1997|language=German
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
Hanns Eisler, the famous Austrian musician who would later go on to compose the [[East German]] national anthem "[[Auferstanden aus Ruinen]]", intentionally keeps the composition of "Einheitsfrontlied" simple and easy to follow, so it could be sung by workers without much musical training&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marxist-theory-of-art.blogspot.com/2010/10/united-front-song-einheitsfrontlied.html |last=Hirschfeld |first=Eugene |title=United Front Song (Einheitsfrontlied) |website= Marxist Theory of Art|publisher=Blogger |date=31 July 2010|access-date=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In doing so, the song is quite march-like. In 1948, Eisler wrote another symphonic version, which as also sung by Ernst Busch and recorded for his Aurora-Projekt.

== Cover versions ==

[[Ton Steine Scherben]] covered the song on their 1971 album [[Warum geht es mir so dreckig?]]. [[Hannes Wader]] recorded a cover version of it on his 1977 album called ''Hannes Wader singt Arbeiterlieder''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3246">'''Genetic exceptionalism''' is the belief that genetic information is special and so must be treated differently from other types of medical data or other personally identifiable information.  

For example, patients are able to obtain information about their [[blood pressure]] without involving any medical professionals, but to obtain information about their genetic profile might require an order from a physician and expensive counseling sessions. Disclosure of an individual's genetic information or its meaning, such as telling a woman with red hair that she has a higher risk of skin cancer, has been legally restricted in some places, as providing [[medical advice]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Turna. 18 August 2010.  [http://www.genomeweb.com/dxpgx/uc-berkeley-halts-genetic-testing-program-touts-opportunity-ethical-debate UC Berkeley Halts Genetic Testing Program, but Touts Opportunity for Ethical Debate] ''Pharmacogenomics Reporter''.&lt;/ref&gt;

That policy approach has been taken by state legislatures to safeguard individuals' genetic information in the [[United States]] from individuals, their families, their employers, and the government. The approach builds upon the existing protection required of general health information provided by such laws as the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]].

== Expert Debate ==

There is ongoing debate over whether or when certain genetic information should be considered exceptional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=James P|last2=Burke|first2=Wylie|date=July 2008|title=Genetic exceptionalism. Too much of a good thing?|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1097/GIM.0b013e31817f280a|journal=Genetics in Medicine|language=En|volume=10|issue=7|pages=500–501|doi=10.1097/gim.0b013e31817f280a|issn=1098-3600}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the predictive power of genetic information (such as a risk for a disease like [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's Disease]], which is highly penetrant) may justify special considerations for genetic exceptionalism, in that individuals with a high risk for developing this condition may face a certain amount of discrimination. However, for most common human health conditions, a specific genetic variant only plays a partial role, interacting with other genetic variants and environmental and lifestyle influences to contribute to disease development. In these cases, genetic information is often considered similarly to other medical and lifestyle data, such as smoking status, age, or [[Biomarker|biomarkers]].

The '''Global Terrorism Database''' ('''GTD''') is a database of incidents of terrorism from 1970 onward. As of July 2017, the list extended through 2016, with an incomplete data of 1993 due to issues with that year.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/faq/|title=GTD Frequently Asked Questions|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Global Terrorism Database|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=February 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database is maintained by the [[National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism]] (START) at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=about/&gt; It is also the basis for other terrorism-related measures, such as the [[Global Terrorism Index]] (GTI) published by the [[Institute for Economics and Peace]].&lt;ref name=about-gti&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofhumanity.org/#/page/about-gti|title = About GTI Index|publisher = Vision of Humanity|accessdate = June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2001, the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] obtained a large database of terrorist attacks from 1970 to 1997 collated by [[Pinkerton Global Intelligence Services]] (data from 1993 was missing because it got lost in an office move by Pinkerton, however, some summary data from 1993 is still available). With funding from the [[National Institute of Justice]], the University of Maryland finished digitizing the data in December 2005. In April 2006, the [[National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism]] (START), working with the [[Center for Terrorism and Intelligence Studies]] (CETIS), received additional funding from the Human Factors Division of the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) to extend the GTD beyond 1997. The data generated for 1997 to 2007 was then harmonized with the Pinkerton data from 1970 to 1997 to create a unified database of terrorist events from 1970 to 2007 (excluding 1993). New years were periodically added, and as of August 2014, the data goes up to 2014.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/about/History.aspx|title = History of the GTD|accessdate = June 12, 2014|publisher = [[National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GTD was formally introduced in a paper in ''[[Terrorism and Political Violence]]'' by Gary LaFree and Laura Dugan of START, published in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ccjs.umd.edu/sites/ccjs.umd.edu/files/pubs/FTPV_A_224594.pdf|title = Introducing the Global Terrorism Database|last = LaFree|first = Gary|last2 = Dugan|first2 = Laura|pages = 181–204|year = 2007|volume = 19|journal = [[Terrorism and Political Violence]]|doi = 10.1080/09546550701246817}}&lt;/ref&gt; An update on the GTD by LaFree was published by ''[[Perspectives on Terrorism]]'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Global Terrorism Database: Accomplishments and Challenges|last = LaFree|first = Gary|volume = 4|issue = 1|date = 2010|journal = [[Perspectives on Terrorism]]|url=http://terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php/pot/article/view/89|accessdate = June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another update was published in ''Evidence-based Counterterrorism Policy'' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = [[Evidence-based Counterterrorism Policy]]|last = LaFree|first = Gary|volume = 3|date = 2012|pages = 41–64|title=Generating Terrorism Event Databases: Results from the Global Terrorism Database, 1970 to 2008 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-0953-3_3}}&lt;!--|accessdate = June 12, 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Benjamin Acosta and Kristen Ramos published the 1993 Terrorism and Political Violence Dataset, which marks a comprehensive recollection of the previously missing 1993 data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Acosta|first=Benjamin|last2=Ramos|first2=Kristen|date=2017|title=Introducing the 1993 Terrorism and Political Violence Dataset|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1057610X.2016.1184061|journal=Studies in Conflict &amp; Terrorism|volume=40|pages=232-247|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Use in other databases and indices===
Data from the Global Terrorism Database is used to generate the [[Global Terrorism Index]] (GTI) published by the [[Institute for Economics and Peace]].&lt;ref name=about-gti/&gt;

===Academic reception===
A number of academic papers studying various aspects of terrorism, including trends in the amount and types of terrorism, draws on data from the GTD for its empirical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Investigative Visual Analysis of Global Terrorism|last = Wang|first = Xiaoyu|last2 = Miller|first2 = Eric|last3 = Smarick|first3 = Kathleen|last4 = Ribarsky|first4 = William|last5= Chang|first5 = Remco|journal = [[Computer Graphics Forum]]|volume = 27|issue = 3|pages = 919–926|date = May 2008|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8659.2008.01225.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate = June 12, 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://128.8.127.3/grad/scholarlypapers/papers/JoonghoonLee.pdf|title = Exploring Global Terrorism Data: A Web-based Visualization of Temporal Data|last = Lee|first = Joonghoon|accessdate = June 12, 2014|doi = 10.1145/1519390.1519393|journal = Crossroads|volume = 15|issue = 2|date = December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://viscenter.uncc.edu/sites/viscenter.uncc.edu/files/CVC-UNCC-08-15.pdf|title = Visual Analysis of Entity Relationships in Global Terrorism Database|last = Godwin|first = Alex|last2 = Chang|first2 = Remco|last3 = Kosara|first3 = Robert|last4 = Ribarsky|first4 = William|publisher = SPIE Proceedings|doi = 10.1117/12.778084|volume = 6983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[The Better Angels of Our Nature]]'', author [[Steven Pinker]] used data from the Global Terrorism Database for his analysis of trends in terrorism, calling it "the major publicly available dataset on terrorist attacks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = [[The Better Angels of Our Nature]]|last = Pinker|first = Steven|authorlink = Steven Pinker|isbn = 978-1-101-54464-8|date = October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 [[Robert Pape|Pape]] et al. observed that, “according to the GTD data today, there were over 70 percent more suicide attacks in 2013 (619) than the previous peak in 2007 (359) during the Iraq war."  Meanwhile, their [[Chicago Project on Security and Terrorism]] (CPOST) claims a 19 percent ''decrease'' for the same period:&lt;ref  name='Pape14'&gt;{{Citation

Pape et al. noted that this difference can be explained by a change in methodology between 2007 and 2013.  As noted above, the GTD data were collected by four different organizations:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Pape et al. quote GTD officials as claiming that their “researchers, past and present, have ensured that the entire database uses the same standards for inclusion and is as comprehensive as possible.”  Pape et al. disagree while noting that their CPOST methodology has been consistent since their first recorded incident in 1982.  They conclude, “American policy makers and the public deserve the best data available on terrorism, one of the most important national security issues of our time.”&lt;ref name='Pape14'/&gt;

While calling the Global Terrorism Database a treasure trove of information, a 2013 ''Washington Post'' [[fact-checking|fact-checking article]] criticized its use by government officials to hype the threat of terrorism around the world, given its use of a definition of terrorism conflicting with Congressionally required law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2013/11/06/hyping-the-number-of-deaths-from-terrorism/ |title= Fact Checker Analysis - Hyping the number of deaths from terrorism |author=Glenn Kessler |date= November 6, 2013|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article for ''[[Stratfor]]'' stated that the Database does not pull incidents from thin air, but expressed concern that claims of a 70% increase in 2017 North American terrorist fatalities were based on the GTD classifying the [[2017 Las Vegas Shooting]] as an essentially certain case of goal-driven ideological terrorism; when no clear ideological or political motive has been found. Excluding that one incident would have yielded a 10% decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/understanding-terrorism-more-numbers-game |title= Understanding Terrorism Is More Than a Numbers Game|author= Ben West |date=Aug 28, 2018  |publisher=Stratfor }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guaranteed minimum income''' ('''GMI'''), also called '''minimum income''', is a system&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basicincome.org/basic-income/history History of Basic Income], ''Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN)'', retrieved on 18 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; of [[social welfare provision]] that guarantees that all [[citizen]]s or [[family|families]] have an income sufficient to live on, provided they meet certain conditions. Eligibility is typically determined by [[citizenship]], a [[means test]], and either availability for the [[labour market]] or a willingness to perform [[community service]]s. The primary goal of a guaranteed minimum income is to [[poverty reduction|reduce poverty]]. If citizenship is the only requirement, the system turns into a [[basic income|universal basic income]].

==Elements==
A system of guaranteed minimum income can consist of several elements, most notably:

* a calculation of the social minimum, usually below the [[minimum wage]];
* a [[social safety net]], to help citizens or families without sufficient financial means survive at the social minimum. This may be a transfer or, in some cases, a loan, and is generally conditional to availability for work, performance of community services, some kind of [[social contract]], or commitment to a [[Social integration|reintegration]] trajectory;
* [[child support]] by the [[state (polity)|state]];
* [[student loan]] and [[grants]];
* [[state pension]] for the elderly;
* [[disability pension]] for the persons with disability.

==Differences from basic income==
{{Main|Basic income}}

Basic income means the provision of identical payments from a government to all of its citizens. Guaranteed minimum income is a system of payments (possibly only one) by a government to citizens who fail to meet one or more [[means test]]s. While most modern countries have some form of GMI, a basic income is rare.

==Advocates==
The first Muslim [[caliph]], [[Abu Bakr]], introduced a guaranteed minimum standard of income, granting each man, woman, and child ten [[dirhams]] annually; this was later increased to twenty dirhams.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Clark: Pakistan's Zakat and 'Ushr as a Welfare System&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1795, American revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]] advocated a [[citizen's dividend]] to all [[United States]] citizens as compensation for "loss of his or her natural inheritance, by the introduction of the system of landed property" (''[[Agrarian Justice]]'', 1795).

French [[Emperor]] [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] echoed Paine's sentiments and commented that 'man is entitled by birthright to a share of the Earth's produce sufficient to fill the needs of his existence' (Herold, 1955).

The [[United States|American]] [[economist]] [[Henry George]] advocated for a dividend to be paid to all citizens from the revenue generated by a [[land value tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= George|first= Henry|date= 1871|title= Our Land and Land Policy, National and State|url= https://archive.org/details/ourlandandlandp00georgoog|location= |publisher= White &amp; Bauer [etc.]|page= 230|isbn= 9781230444703|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, [[Robert Theobald]] published the book ''Free Men and Free Markets'', in which he advocated a ''guaranteed minimum income'' (the origin of the modern version of the phrase).

In 1966, the [[Cloward–Piven strategy]] advocated "overloading" the US welfare system to force its collapse in the hopes that it would be replaced by "a guaranteed annual income and thus an end to poverty".

In his final book ''[[Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?]]'' (1967), [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] wrote&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther King jr., ''[[Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?]]'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{"|I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective—the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income.|from the chapter titled "Where We Are Going"}}

In 1968, [[James Tobin]], [[Paul Samuelson]], [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] and another 1,200 economists signed a document calling for the US Congress to introduce in that year a system of income guarantees and supplements.&lt;ref&gt;''Economists' Statement on Guaranteed Annual Income'', 1/15/1968-4/18/1969 folder, General Correspondence Series, Papers of John Kenneth Galbraith, John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. Cited in: Jyotsna Sreenivasan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yk5NI69ZO9sC "Poverty and the Government in America: A Historical Encyclopedia."] (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2009), page 269&lt;/ref&gt;

President Richard Nixon proposed reforms to the welfare program in 1969, where a minimum income would be paid to poor families. Contrary to popular belief, Nixon was critical of the idea of a guaranteed universal basic income. The proposal by Nixon passed in the House but never made it out of committee in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=2194|title=Richard Nixon: Special Message to the Congress on Reform of the Nation's Welfare System.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] wrote ''The Politics of a Guaranteed Income'', in which he advocated the guaranteed minimum income and discussed [[Richard Nixon]]'s Guaranteed Annual Income (GAI) proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=2191|title=Richard Nixon: Address to the Nation on Domestic Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, [[New Zealand]]'s [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] Finance Minister [[Roger Douglas]] announced a Guaranteed Minimum Family Income Scheme to accompany a new flat tax.  Both were quashed by then Prime Minister [[David Lange]], who sacked Douglas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5DE133CF937A15751C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all "New Zealand Is Jolted By a Speedy Decontrol"], Seth Mydans, ''The New York Times'' (24 February 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1994 "autobiographical dialog", [[classical liberal]] [[Friedrich Hayek]] stated: "I have always said that I am in favor of a minimum income for every person in the country".&lt;ref&gt;Hayek on Hayek: An Autobiographical Dialogue by F. A. Hayek, edited by Stephen Kresge and Leif Wenar (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, The Equal Life Foundation published the Living Income Guaranteed Proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/182616757/The-Living-Income-Guaranteed-Proposal|title=The Living Income Guaranteed Proposal}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating a practical way to implement and fund a minimum guaranteed income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livingincome.me/wiki/The_Living_Income_Guaranteed_Proposal|title=The Living Income Guaranteed Proposal|work=Living Income Guaranteed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Harry A. Shamir (US) published a book "Consumerism, or Capitalism Without Crises" in which the concept was promoted by another label, as a way to enable our civilization to survive in an era of automation and computerization and large scale unemployment.  The book also innovates a method to fund the process, tapping into the underground economy and volunteerism.

Other modern advocates include [[Hans-Werner Sinn]] (Germany), [[Ayşe Buğra]] (Turkey), The Green Economics Institute (GEI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greeneconomics.org.uk|title=Green Economics|publisher=GEI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andrew Coyne]] (Canada).&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.financialpost.com/2013/04/08/a-minimum-income-not-wage-is-a-fairer-way-to-distribute-wealth/ "A minimum income, not wage, is a fairer way to distribute wealth"], Andrew Coyne, ''The Financial Post'' (8 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
{{refimprove section |date=December 2013}}

Tax revenues would fund the majority of any GMI proposal. As most GMI proposals seek to create an earnings floor close to or above poverty lines amongst all citizens, the fiscal burden would require equally broad tax sources, such as income taxes or VATs, in order to fund such expenditures. To varying degrees, a GMI might be funded through the reduction or elimination of other social security programs such as [[unemployment insurance]].

Another approach for funding is to acknowledge that all modern economies use fiat money and thus taxation is not necessary for funding; However, the fact that there are no financial constraints does not mean other constraints, such as on real resources, do not exist. A likely outcome based on the economic theory known as [[Modern Monetary Theory]] would be a moderate increase in taxation to ensure the extra income would not cause demand-pull inflation; This hypothetical [[Chartalism|Chartalist]] approach can be seen in the implementation of [[quantitative easing]] programs where, in the United States, over three trillion dollars&lt;ref&gt;[https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/fredgraph.png?g=2pXx Fredgraph]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7Xh0hY3-sM&amp;t=0m8s|title=Ben Bernanke: As a Literal Fact the Fed is not Printing Money|first=|last=wonkmonk|date=12 May 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; were created without requiring taxes.

==Examples around the world==

===Cyprus===
In July 2013, the Cypriot government unveiled a plan to reform the welfare system in Cyprus and create a {{'}}''Guaranteed Minimum Income''{{'}} for all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2013/07/26/president-announces-guaranteed-minimum-income-for-all-citizens/|title=President announces 'Guaranteed Minimum Income' for all citizens|work=Cyprus Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In 1988, France was one of the first countries to implement a minimum income, called the [[Revenu minimum d'insertion]]. In 2009, it was turned into [[Revenu de solidarité active]] (RSA), a new system which aimed at solving the [[poverty trap]] by providing low-wage workers a complementary income; thus encouraging activity.

The [[United States]] has multiple social programs that provide guaranteed minimum incomes for individuals meeting certain criteria such as assets or disability. For instance, [[Supplemental Security Income]] ('''SSI''') is a United States government program that provides [[stipend]]s to low-income people who are either aged (65 or older), blind, or disabled. SSI was created in 1974 to replace federal-state adult assistance programs that served the same purpose. Today the program provides benefits to approximately eight million Americans. Another such program is [[Social Security Disability Insurance]] ('''SSD''' or '''SSDI'''), a [[payroll tax]]-funded, [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|federal insurance]] program.  It is managed by the [[Social Security Administration]] and is designed to provide [[income supplement]]s to people who are physically restricted in their ability to be [[employed]] because of a notable [[disability]], usually a [[physical disability]]. SSD can be supplied on either a temporary or permanent basis, usually directly correlated to whether the person's disability is temporary or permanent.

An early guaranteed minimum income program in the U.S. was the&amp;nbsp;[[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]]&amp;nbsp;(AFDC), established by the&amp;nbsp;[[Social Security Act]]. Where previously the responsibility to assist needy children lay in the hands of the states, AFDC transferred that authority to the federal government.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lurie|first=Irene|date=1997-01-01|title=Temporary Assistance for Needy Families: A Green Light for the States|url=https://academic.oup.com/publius/article/27/2/73/1916654|journal=Publius: The Journal of Federalism|volume=27|issue=2|pages=73–87|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.pubjof.a029915|issn=0048-5950}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Over time, the AFDC was often criticized for creating disincentives to work, leading to many arguing for its replacement. In the 1970s, President&amp;nbsp;[[Richard Nixon|Richard M. Nixon]]&amp;nbsp;proposed the Family Assistance Program (FAP) which would replace the AFDC. FAP was designed to fix many of the problems that the AFDC suffered from, particularly the anti-work structure. Presidential nominee&amp;nbsp;[[George McGovern]]&amp;nbsp;also proposed a minimum income in the form of a Universal Tax Credit. Ultimately, neither of these programs were implemented. Throughout the decade, many other experimental minimum income programs were carried out in cities throughout the country, such as the Seattle-Denver Income Maintenance Experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larson|first=David|date=January 1, 1992|title=Long Overdue: The Single Guaranteed Minimum Income Program|url=|journal=University of Detroit Mercy Law Review.|volume= 69|pages=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;In 1996, under President&amp;nbsp;[[Bill Clinton]], the AFDC was replaced with the&amp;nbsp;[[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families]]&amp;nbsp;program. This would&amp;nbsp;[[block grant]]&amp;nbsp;funds to the states to allow them to decide how aid would be distributed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another guaranteed minimum income program in the U.S. is the&amp;nbsp;[[Earned income tax credit|Earned Income Tax Credit.]]&amp;nbsp;This is a refundable tax credit that gives poorer families cash assistance every year. The EITC avoids the&amp;nbsp;[[welfare trap]]&amp;nbsp;by subsidizing income, rather than replacing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zelleke|first=Almaz|date=December 2005|title=Basic Income in the United States: Redefining Citizenship in the Liberal State|url=|journal=Review of Social Economy|volume= 63|pages=633–648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
Minimum income has been increasingly accepted by the Brazilian government. In 2004, President&amp;nbsp;[[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula da Silva]] signed into law a bill to establish a universal basic income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wispelaere|first=Jurgen De|date=October 2016|title=Basic Income in Our Time: Improving Political Prospects Through Policy Learning?|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-social-policy/article/basic-income-in-our-time-improving-political-prospects-through-policy-learning/C69074D813A9FE5096E60718131ACAD6|journal=Journal of Social Policy|volume=45|issue=4|pages=617–634|doi=10.1017/s0047279416000039|issn=0047-2794|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;This law is primarily implemented through the&amp;nbsp;[[Bolsa Família]]&amp;nbsp;program. Under this program, poorer families will receive a direct cash payment via a government issued debit card. Bolsa Família is a&amp;nbsp;[[conditional cash transfer]]&amp;nbsp;program, meaning that beneficiaries will receive their aid if they accomplish certain actions. Families who receive the aid must put their children in school and participate in vaccination programs. If they do not meet these requirements, they will be cut off from aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/10650663|title=Happy families|date=2008-02-07|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-11-30|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;As of 2011, approximately 50 million people, or a quarter of Brazil's population, were participating in Bolsa Família.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/brazil/overview#2|title=Overview|work=World Bank|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Canada has experimented with minimum income trials, both in the past and in the present. The most prominent past example is the&amp;nbsp;[[Mincome]]&amp;nbsp;experiment, which ran in&amp;nbsp;[[Manitoba]]&amp;nbsp;in the 1970s. Mincome provided lower income families with cash transfers to keep them out of poverty. The researchers conducting Mincome found that it did not disincentivize work. The only recipients who reduced their number of hours worked were single mothers, who could now afford to stay at home and raise their children, and young men who preferred to stay in school rather than work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/2001-odyssee-espace/a-guaranteed-annual-income-from-mincome-to-the-millennium/|title=A guaranteed annual income? From moncome to millennium|work=Policy Options|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Budget shortfalls resulted in the shuttering of the program.

In 2017, the province of&amp;nbsp;[[Ontario]]&amp;nbsp;began an minimum income experiment. Approximately 4000 citizens began to receive a stipend based on their family situation and income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/24/pf/canada-ontario-money-basic-income-program/index.html|title=Canada: Ontario launches guaranteed income program for 4,000 residents|last=Petroff|first=Alanna|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Recipients of this program can receive upwards of $10,000 per year. Government researchers are using this pilot as a way of testing to see if a minimum income can help people meet their basic needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontario-basic-income-pilot|title=Ontario Basic Income Pilot|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ontario.ca|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3597">[[File:CoA Serbian Empire K N Armorial.jpg|thumb|"Coat of arms of [[Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia|Tsar Dušan]]" (r. 1331-1346) presented in the Korenić-Neorić Armorial.
The [[division of the field|field is divided]] into nine parts, representing the coats of arms of  Macedonia, Slavonia, Bosnia  Bulgaria, Dalmatia, Serbia, Croatia, Rascia, and "Primordia".
In addition, there are two inescutcheons, intended as showing the coats of arms
of the [[Nemanjić]] and [[Kotromanić]] dynasties.]]
The '''''Korenić-Neorić Armorial''''' is a 1595 copy of the lost original of the '''''Ohmućević Armorial''''' (''Ohmućević  grbovnik'')  commissioned by '''Petar Ohmućević''' (died 1599), a Spanish admiral of [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] origin, at some point between 1584 and 1594.  It is an example of the earliest ("Interconfessional") form of [[Illyrism]], which formed the ideological basis for the later [[rise of nationalism in the Balkans]].

The armorial combines historical (late medieval) with fictional coats of arms to construct the notion of an "Illyrian Empire". This Empire happened to coincide exactly with the sphere of interest of the Spanish Empire in the Balkans at the time, and hence also Petar's own. The personal purpose pursued by Petar Ohmućević was that of confirming his own "Illyrian" nobility after he rose to the rank of admiral in the Spanish navy. In order to qualify for the greater chivalric orders of Habsburg Spain at the time, it was necessary to prove descent from eight noble and purely Catholic great-grandparents.
Ohmućević was granted the status of nobleman in 1594, which is taken as the ''terminus ante quem'' of the armorial. Ohmućević's armorial can thus be considered a personal project in origin, or even a fraud, as he invented genealogy in order to qualify for the coveted title, but its influence turned out to be immense, becoming, as it did, the foundation of Balkanic or "[[Illyrist]]" heraldry in general. An important source for Ohmućević's heraldic inventions was the ''[[Wappenbüchlein]]'' by [[Virgil Solis]] (1555), which itself contains fictional arms of "foreign kingdoms".
The Korenić-Neorić Armorial of 1595 is printed on paper, in a format of  21&amp;nbsp;cm x 14.5&amp;nbsp;cm, on 168 sheets.
The Ohmućević Armorial is the main source used by the [[Fojnica Armorial]], which is for this reason dated to after 1595, probably to the 1670s, and later "Illyrist" armorials compiled in the [[early modern period]].

'''Left-wing fascism''' and '''left fascism''' are sociological and philosophical terms used to categorize tendencies in [[left-wing politics]] otherwise commonly attributed to the ideology of [[fascism]]. Fascism has historically been considered a [[Far-right politics|far-right]] ideology.  Since fascism, by [[Umberto Eco]]'s [[definitions of fascism|definition]], is incompatible with many tenets of Marxism, left-wing fascism is not considered a [[far-left politics|far-left]] ideology.

The term has its origins with criticism by [[Vladimir Lenin]] of the threat of [[anti-Marxist]] [[ultraleftism]] before being formulated as a position by sociologists [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Irving Louis Horowitz]].

Left-wing fascists are opposed by [[anti-fascist]] groups globally, including [[Antifa (United States)|Antifa in the United States]]. Anti-fascists believe that in order to protect free speech, fascists must be suppressed and de-platformed. Under fascist rule [[definitions of fascism|disagreement is treason]] and free speech is not protected. Fascism devalues intellectual discourse and critical reasoning as barriers to action, as well as out of fear that such analysis will expose the contradictions embodied in a [[Syncretic politics|syncretistic]] faith.

== Usage ==
The most prominent early user of the term "left fascism" ({{lang|de|linker Faschismus}}) was [[Jürgen Habermas]], a sociologist and philosopher influenced by the [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxist]] [[Frankfurt School]]. He used the term in the 1960s to distance the Frankfurt School from the violence and [[authoritarianism]] of [[Left-wing terrorism|left-wing terrorists]] and to criticize the violent methods of protest of the [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund]].&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, "Die Scheinrevolution und ihre Kinder. Sechs Thesen über Taktik, Ziele und Situationsanalysen der oppositionellen Jugend" (''Frankfurter Rundschau'', 5 June 1968) in: Wolfgang Abendroth, Oskar Negt, ''Die Linke antwortet Jürgen Habermas'', Europäische Verlagsanstalt, pp. 5–15. Habermas later retracted the term in: Jürgen Habermas, [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-40736264.html "Probe für Volksjustiz"], ''Der Spiegel'', 10 October 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Ruth Ann and Wolf, Allison. ''Contemporary Sociological Theory: Continuing the Classical Tradition''. 3rd ed. (1991). p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hohendahl, Peter Uwe. ''Reappraisals: Shifting Alignments in Postwar Critical Theory'' (Cornell University Press, 1991). {{ISBN|0-8014-9706-X}}. 9780801497063. [https://books.google.com/books?id=5A7MB1Vlbu0C&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22left+fascism%22+habermas#PPA9,M1  pp. 9–10].&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas, whose work emphasizes the importance of rational discourse, democratic institutions and opposition to violence, has made important contributions to [[conflict theory]] and is often associated with the radical left.

[[Seymour Martin Lipset]], in 1960, classified as left-wing fascism some nationalist and authoritarian regimes in underdeveloped countries, namely in South America, like [[Juan Perón|Peron]] in Argentina and [[Getulio Vargas]] in Brazil, characterized by an appeal to the working classes against the upper classes, and accusing the later of being guilty for the underdevelopment of the country and for the subjection to foreign interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lipset |first1=Seymour Martin |authorlink=Seymour Martin Lipset |format=PDF |title=Political Man |chapter=Fascism—Left, Right, and Center |chapter-url=https://ia600503.us.archive.org/25/items/politicalmansoci00inlips/politicalmansoci00inlips.pdf#page=135 |location=Garden City, New York |publisher= Doubleday &amp; Company |year=1960 |pages=131-176 |accessdate=2018-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Irving Louis Horowitz]] in his 1984 book ''Winners and Losers'' built on Vladimir Lenin's work ''[["Left-Wing" Communism: An Infantile Disorder]]''.&lt;ref name="Horowitz"&gt;Horowitz, Irving Louis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Au_Ktn22RxEC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=%22left+fascism%22 ''Winners and Losers: Social and Political Polarities in America''] (Duke University Press, 1984). {{ISBN|0-8223-0602-6}}. {{ISBN|978-0-8223-0602-3}}. ch. 17. p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin describes the enemies of the [[working class]] as [[opportunist]]s and [[petty-bourgeois]] revolutionaries operating on [[anarchist]] premises.&lt;ref name="Horowitz"/&gt; Horowitz claimed that "left-wing fascism" emerged again in the United States political life during the 1980s in the form of a refusal to disengage radical rhetoric form totalitarian reality.&lt;ref name="Horowitz"/&gt;

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the term "left fascism" has been used to describe unusual hybrid political alliances.&lt;ref&gt;''[[TELOS (journal)|TELOS]]'' (fall 2008). no. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Richard Wolin]] has used the term "left fascism" in arguing that some European intellectuals have been infatuated with [[Post-modernism|post-modernist]] or anti-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] theories, opening up the opportunity for cult-like, irrational, anti-democratic positions that combine characteristics of the left with those of fascism.&lt;ref&gt;Wolin, Richard. ''The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism'' (Princeton University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8610">'''''[[Freikorps]]''''' ({{lang-en|Free Corps}}) were [[Germans|German]] volunteer military or [[anti-communist]] [[paramilitary]] units.  The term was originally applied to voluntary armies formed in German lands from the middle of the 18th century onwards. Between World War I and World War II the term was also used for the paramilitary organizations that arose during the [[Weimar Republic]]. This is a list of post-World War I Freikorps members.

{{United States Senate}}
The [[Vice President of the United States]] is the ''[[Ex officio member|ex officio]]'' [[President of the Senate]], as provided in [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I, Section 3, Clause 4]], of the [[United States Constitution]], but may only [[casting vote|vote in order to break a tie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The United States Constitution|page= Article I, Section 3, Clause 4|publisher= U.S. Congress |date=1787|quote=The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], as of November 29, 2018, a tie-breaking vote had been cast 266 times by 36 vice presidents.&lt;ref name="senate"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/VPTies.pdf|title=Senate.gov: VPTies.pdf|accessdate=February 5, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502114129/https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/VPTies.pdf|archivedate=May 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is the list of tie-breaking votes cast by vice presidents of the United States.

==Historical significance==
[[File:Betsy DeVos final confirmation vote in US Senate tie broken by Mike Pence.webm|thumb|left|When there is a tie in the Senate, as seen here for the confirmation of [[Betsy DeVos]] as Secretary of Education, the Vice President (in this case, [[Mike Pence]]) has to step in to break the tie.]]
The first President of the Senate, [[John Adams]], cast 29 tie-breaking votes. He cast his first tie-breaking vote on July 18, 1789.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_John_Adams.htm|title=U.S. Senate: John Adams, 1st Vice President (1789-1797)|website=www.senate.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; His votes protected the president's sole authority over the removal of appointees, influenced the location of the national capital, and prevented war with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. On at least one occasion he persuaded senators to vote against legislation that he opposed, and he frequently lectured the Senate on procedural and policy matters. Adams's political views and his active role in the Senate made him a natural target for critics of the [[George Washington|Washington]] administration. Toward the end of his first term, as a result of a threatened resolution that would have silenced him except for procedural and policy matters, he began to exercise more restraint in the hope of realizing the goal shared by many of his successors: election in his own right as President of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_John_Adams.htm|title=Senate.gov: John Adams, 1st Vice President (1789–1797)|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001134551/http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_John_Adams.htm|archivedate=October 1, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, during the [[107th United States Congress|107th Congress]], the Senate was divided 50–50 between Republicans and Democrats and thus [[Dick Cheney]]'s tie-breaking vote gave the Republicans the Senate majority. However, because the 107th Congress was sworn in on January 3, while the president and vice president were not sworn in until the 20th, Democrats technically held a 51–50 majority in the Senate for the 17 days while [[Al Gore]] was still Vice President. However, no substantive legislative work was done during that time.

[[Mike Pence]] cast six tie-breaking votes during his first year in office, the most for any vice president. He broke a tie with [[John Adams]], [[William Wheeler]], and [[Alben Barkley]], who all cast four tie-breaking votes within their first year.&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt; This was also the most tie-breaking votes in any single year since 1872, when there were seven cast by [[Schuyler Colfax]] during the [[Grant administration]].&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt; He has so far cast the most tie-breaking votes (11) for a vice president since Schuyler Colfax was vice president from 1869 – 1873.

In recent years, the increased threat of a [[filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]] has led to a rise in the use of [[Cloture#United States|cloture]] to end debate in the Senate, especially on high-profile issues where the Senate is sharply divided, thus rendering the vice president's tie-breaking vote increasingly unnecessary or unhelpful, since the invocation of cloture requires a three-fifths majority, rather than a simple one. However, the cloture requirement was [[Nuclear option#Use in 2013 &amp; 2017|reduced]] to a simple majority for all executive and judicial nominations in 2013 (except for Supreme Court nominations, which were included in 2017), which led to the first ever use of a tie-breaking vote to confirm a Cabinet member when Pence broke a tie to confirm [[Betsy DeVos]] in 2017.

In general, tie-breaking votes have become less common over time, both in terms of absolute frequency and in terms of the average number of such votes cast by individual vice presidents. More tie-breaking votes were cast by the first 12 vice presidents in the 61 years from 1789 to 1850 (135) than have been cast by the 36 vice presidents in the 168 years since then (131).&lt;ref name="senate" /&gt;

==List of vice presidents by number of tie-breaking votes==
&lt;!--
NOTE: the mean listed in the second sentence below MUST BE UPDATED each time a tie-breaking vote is cast
assuming the data are accurate, the mode cannot change for at least five more VPs after Pence and the median cannot for at least two more VPs after Pence.
--&gt;
As of November 29, 2018, there have been 266 tie-breaking votes cast by 36 vice presidents while 12 others did not cast any votes. The average number of tie-breaking votes cast by a vice president may be considered to be 0 (the [[Mode (statistics)|mode]]: 12 cast no tie-breaking votes), 3 (the [[median]] value: half cast more, half cast less), or about 5.5 (the [[mean]] value: 266 votes divided among 48 Presidents of the Senate).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4535">'''Marvin Lewis Kline''' (August 9, 1903 &amp;ndash; April 9, 1974) was an architectural engineer and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician who served as the 34th [[List of mayors of Minneapolis|mayor of Minneapolis]].

==Early life and career==
Kline was born in [[Brunswick, Nebraska]] in 1903. His family moved to [[Redwood Falls, Minnesota]] in 1915 and Kline went on to attend the [[University of Minnesota]], graduating in 1929 with a degree in architectural engineering. He worked with the Minnesota Department of Transportation and later formed his own company. In 1935, he was elected to the Minneapolis City Council. He was re-elected to a second term in 1939 and became the council's president.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|title=M. L. Kline, Ex-Sister Kenny head, dies at 70|work=Minneapolis Tribune|date=14 April 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Mayoralty==
In 1941, Kline was elected mayor. During his time in office he worked with the city of [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] and the state government to form the jointly run [[Metropolitan Airports Commission]]. Kline was criticized by some (including journalist [[Arthur Kasherman]]) of [[corruption]] and [[Racketeering|collusion with the city's criminal underworld]]. According to a contemporaneous [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] document, the [[Special Agent in Charge|SAC]] Rhodes of the FBI field office in [[St. Paul]]{{#tag:ref|From 1941–1949, what is now the [[List of FBI field offices#Minneapolis|FBI Field Office in Minneapolis]] was located in [[St. Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/history/field-office-histories/minneapolis |title=FBI Minneapolis History |date=August 13, 2016 |website=Federal Bureau of Investigation |language=en-us |format=HTML |publication-date=May 26, 2016 |access-date=2018-09-24 |laysource=FBI |laydate=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"|name="FBI field office history"}} was also reported to believe that "Kline is controlled by the racketeers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |url=https://vault.fbi.gov/hubert%20h.-humphrey/hubert-h.-humphrey-part-01-of-32/view#document/p4 |title=Hubert H.

B. |type=Government memorandum |language=en-US |publisher=The Vault ([[FBI]] [[Freedom of Information Act|FOIA]] Library) |page=4 |format=PDF}}{{DoJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was defeated in 1945 by [[Hubert Humphrey]] who ran on a platform of [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]] and cleaning up the city's government.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solberg|first1=Carl|title=Hubert Humphrey: A Biography|date=2003|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society Press|isbn=9780873514736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=electiontrends&gt;{{cite web|title=Career of Marvin Lewis Kline|url=http://electiontrendsproject.org/search/search.php?candidate=2|website=Minnesota Election Trends Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Later life and death==
After leaving office, Kline worked with the [[Sister Kenny Rehabilitation Institute]] as their executive director. In 1964, Kline was convicted of [[grand larceny]] for illegally boosting his salary as director and for diverting fundraising proceeds from the institute's foundation. He was sentenced to [[Minnesota Correctional Facility – Stillwater|Stillwater Prison]] for 10 years but released after serving 3 years.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

After being released, Kline briefly worked as an engineer at the [[Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant]] before suffering from a stroke and retiring. Kline died of a heart attack in [[Ventura, California]] in 1974. He is buried in [[Blair, Nebraska]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marvin L.

The failure of the '''Yên Bái mutiny''' by [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] soldiers in the French [[Troupes coloniales|colonial army]] on February 10, 1930 caused the French authorities to engage in a reform of military policies which were aimed at preventing future uprisings. French trust in the Vietnamese soldiers' loyalty as colonised subjects who were simultaneously enforcers of colonial order had never been high, and the mutiny resulted in increased safeguards against Vietnamese soldiers in an attempt to prevent future incidents. Around 80% of the Vietnamese soldiers in [[Tonkin (French protectorate)|Tonkin]] were transferred to other districts in order to disrupt any secret plots that may have been in progress, and some soldiers who had returned from foreign service were discharged in the fear that their overseas experiences made them less likely to accept colonial subjugation. The internal reform saw the rules for expelling Vietnamese soldiers from the army were liberalised and an inquiry into military intelligence resulted in closer cooperation between military intelligence and their French colonial civilian counterparts, while French officers were ordered to improve their [[Vietnamese language]] skills. The French authorities decreed that the proportion of ethnic Vietnamese soldiers was too high and reduced the proportion of Vietnamese by replacing them with European, [[Cambodian people|Cambodian]], [[Lao people|Lao]] and ethnic minority [[Montagnard (Vietnam)|Montagnard]] people.

== Military reforms precipitated by the mutiny ==

The mutiny refocused attention on the long term tension over the use of Indochinese soldiers, and on the ways in which it could be resolved. The tension could be traced back to the creation of [[French Indochina]]. [[French Cochinchina|Cochinchina]], the European term for southern Vietnam, had been colonized in 1867 and the remaining parts of Vietnam, [[Tonkin (French protectorate)|Tonkin]] and [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]], the northern and central regions were conquered in 1883. Nominally, only Cochinchina was a colony, while Tonkin, Annam, [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|Cambodia]] and [[French Protectorate of Laos|Laos]] were [[protectorate]]s which together comprised French Indochina. The problem centred around the French reliance on native soldiers to maintain colonial control. This need was problematic because Indo-Chinese soldiers were both enforcers of colonial order and colonial subjects. This created constant French concerns about their loyalty. Despite several attempts to deal with the issue, the basic tension between the need for and suspicion of native troops could never be entirely resolved. The need for forces to pacify the countryside was too pressing to do without them. As a result, the tension resurfaced at regular intervals, either due to proposals to improve the position of Indochinese soldiers in the army, or after a mutiny had raised question marks about the loyalty of the soldiers.&lt;ref name="r312"/&gt;

=== Background of Vietnamese troops in the French colonial army ===

The demand for Indochinese soldiers, auxiliaries first, and then regular troops, had been present since the beginning of the [[Cochinchina Campaign|French conquest]]. French troops were never numerically sufficient to assert control of the populace and then maintain ''[[Pax Gallica]]'' in the colony, thus requiring local reinforcements. Home grown French troops were lacking because they were too expensive for Paris and [[Hanoi]], in contrast to the substantially cheaper native troops. A lack of manpower back in Europe caused by other imperial programs and the demographic trough caused by mass casualties in [[World War I]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] further caused a need for the recruitment of Indochinese troops. Because French Indochina was a domination and [[Exploitation colonialism|exploitation colony]] rather than a [[Settler colonialism|settler colony]], the pool of local Frenchmen was far too small to build a settler-army.&lt;ref name="r312"&gt;Rettig, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Native troops generally knew the land and people much better, could be used in terrain on which foreign troops were disadvantaged. They were far more abundant than French born troops, whose deployment to Indochina was time consuming, expensive and risky. Aside from the risks associated with the closure of sea lanes, the emergency dispatch of [[Metropolitan France|metropolitan]] troops from Paris could not be taken for granted. Particularly after 1915, French Indochina was expected to financially contribute to the defence of the colony and even to send native troops to France.&lt;ref name="r313"&gt;Rettig, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

The native soldiers fulfilled a number of different purposes. Initially they were collaborators in the [[Cochinchina Campaign|conquest of Indochina]], helping to defeat the forces of the [[Nguyễn Dynasty]] and then in its pacification. After the pacification campaign was officially completed in 1897, the two main functions of the colonial army were the maintenance of internal peace and external security. Both these tasks were fulfilled in conjunction with other armed institutions, such as the ''[[Garde indigène]]'' (later ''indochinoise''), the [[National Gendarmerie|Gendarmerie]], the police, and the [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] in the border regions. The ''Garde indigène'', a [[Paramilitary|paramilitary force]], was primarily responsible for dealing with disturbances of the peace and thus played an important role in the repression of public demonstrations and popular unrest.&lt;ref name="r313"/&gt;

In the areas bordering China, the military had a much more active role in securing the frontier against incursions by smugglers, bandits, and politically motivated militants.&lt;ref name="r313"/&gt;

The participation of native soldiers in the colonial forces was used as [[political symbolism]], proof that the Union's five territories were rightfully under French tutelage, as evidenced by the populace's contribution of soldiers to a common army under French command. This was the "blood toll" to be paid for the ''Pax Gallica''. In their position as colonizers and colonial subjects, the native colonial troops were also buffers between the French and the unarmed populace. Their sheer presence demonstrated French control and power to the ordinary population, posing a considerable obstacle to those who intended to overthrow French rule using violence.&lt;ref name="r314"&gt;Rettig, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dilemma was that the French needed local soldiers to maintain the Union's internal and external peace, but could not rely on them too deeply because of an innate distrust. French concerns about disloyalty resulted from a fear that the colonialised soldiers would turn their weapons on their masters, or desert them in an emergency situation. Such fears were deeply institutionalised in the army in the form of "safe" ratios of "white" and "yellow" soldiers, the segregation of the army into its various Indochinese constituencies, and the establishment of [[racialised]] access to [[Command hierarchy|command hierarchies]] that excluded natives from becoming officers until 1929. The mutiny triggered the long existing fears about the loyalty of native soldiers, as well as many traditional French responses.&lt;ref name="r314"/&gt;

=== Transfer of soldiers ===
[[Image:VietnameseRegions.png|300px|left|thumb|Soldiers in Tonkin (areas coloured red, orange and yellow), were transferred after the uprising.]]
In addition to the individual military punishments, the army took further internal measures to lower the risk of another insurrection. According to [[Maurice Rives]], 10,000 Vietnamese troops were given transfers to different zones. This meant that more than 80% of Tonkin's approximately 12,000 ''[[Tirailleurs]] Tonkinois'' ([[Tonkinese Rifles]]) were moved,&lt;ref name="r317"&gt;Rettig, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; a transfer of enormous proportions, indicating the extent of insecurity among French commanders towards Vietnamese troops, and the extent to which they were willing to go to make future Yên Báis impossible. One possible rationale for this measure was to break up any undiscovered [[Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang|VNQDD]] cells and to sever personal ties, within units and between soldiers and civilians in their local district. The mass transfer of soldiers also had the effect of creating a state of constant mobilisation, denying troops the time and opportunity for anti-colonial organisation. In the words of a French officer who wrote in his diary under the pseudonym ''Bôn Mat'', the measures would also force French officers to be more watchful, as "[t]roops which do not work sufficiently and which are not looked after properly, lose their spirit of discipline; or rather, unoccupied troops cannot be disciplined."&lt;ref name="p318"&gt;Rettig, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from measures in Vietnam, 2,000 Indochinese soldiers returning from service in France were sent on indefinite leave and were not replaced with new recruits from Vietnam. The reason is put down by historians to be because military discipline in France was less regimented than in Indochina and other colonial garrisons. In colonial units, the colonial military and social order with Frenchmen above their indigenous troops was more easily reproduced. The French home services lacked officers specialising in commanding colonial troops; this was one of the main reasons of the disorder, as they unlike their colleagues posted to the colonies, did not know how to lead Vietnamese soldiers. Metropolitan officers also treated their Vietnamese subordinates on a more equitable basis, thereby subverting the colonial hierarchy of racial inequality under which the Vietnamese had been trained. As an example, Indochinese [[Warrant officer|warrant officers]] had the right to command and be saluted in the metropolitan services, whereas in Vietnam only French soldiers had such rights.&lt;ref name="p318"/&gt;

Away from the discipline and the colonial hierarchy they were used to, the Vietnamese soldiers could become so alienated with their experiences that they became soft targets for [[communist propaganda]]. Upon returning home to Vietnam, they attempt to indoctrinate other troops with their [[Marxist]] doctrine. This train of thought further reinforced French perception that subversive ideas came from the outside rather than domestically: of the 57 soldiers involved in the mutiny, 17 had served abroad. On the other hand, according to the [[Thiry report]], the proportion of soldiers with foreign service at Yên Bái did not exceed that in other garrisons, so this was not abnormal.&lt;ref name="r319"&gt;Rettig, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military intelligence reforms ===

In addition to punishing soldiers, tightening dismissal regulations and reducing the number of Vietnamese servicemen in France, the French decided to improve the military intelligence service. This was to be achieved by strengthening military intelligence through closer coordination with the [[Sûreté]], and by raising internal standards.&lt;ref name="r320"&gt;Rettig, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of coordination, an inquiry into the mutiny at Yên Bái showed that cooperation between Resident Massimi and Commandant Le Tacon did not exist despite multiple requests, and that this was partly responsible for the failure to prevent the uprising. Although the relationship between the civilian authorities in Tonkin and the military were traditionally marked by rivalry, Yên Bái stood out in the total lack of military–civilian cooperation. Further VNQDD conspiracies to foment mutinies in other garrisons, such as [[Kien An]], were detected and scotched at late notice. Although the performance of the intelligence service was regarded as being substandard at Yên Bái, the army command in Vietnam realised, under criticism from civil authorities who claimed they had not been sufficiently cooperative in the past, that the teamwork with the Sûreté had to be raised to greater heights to prevent future Yên Bái style rebellions. For such reasons, Patrice Morlat wrote that the mutiny at Yên Bái allowed the Sûreté to "penetrate indirectly into the military sector which had till then been inaccessible".&lt;ref&gt;Rettig, pp. 320&amp;ndash;321.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this indirect penetration in the aftermath of the Yên Bái mutiny seems to have been the evolution of a process that had begun at least six months earlier. Several sources indicate that this was triggered by the French crackdown on the VNQDD and other revolutionary independence organisations in early 1929. The crackdown had uncovered the extent of the VNQDD's systematic infiltration of the army, and had prompted a military crackdown on troops with connections to such organisations. By October 1929, after heavy civilian criticism of the military's information policy in July, army authorities had realised the need to systematically gather intelligence to deal with the threat from new forms of anti-colonial organisation. As such information could be collected only by the Sûreté, the implication was that the military had to work more closely with the colonial political police. Three weeks before Yên Bái, [[Governor-General|Governor General]] Pasquier had congratulated General Commandant Superior Aubert on the "most favourable results" of "close [military–civilian] collaboration".&lt;ref name="r321"&gt;Rettig, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt;

The events at Yên Bái mutiny and the discovery that the VNQDD had infiltrated many other units reinforced the need for closer military–civilian relations and fast tracked the process of improved relations. According to Morlat, the Sûreté's indirect penetration of military affairs involved linking the military intelligence service (SRM) to the Sûreté and the information provided by it, thereby making itself dependent on the political information and even political judgement and agenda of the civilian authorities. The central SRM then relayed this information to its local branches as part of its SRM Bulletin. There, "ALL OFFICERS (and not just those of the SRM" [capitals and brackets in original] were to be participate in the study of the revolutionary groups. As a result of the uprising, the SRM became more closely linked to the Sûreté and its methodology and philosophy in of analysing Vietnamese anti-colonial activity. The number of recipients of such intelligence increased markedly due to the decision to have all officers involved in studying revolutionary parties. The focus thus widened from observing only internal army activities to include developments among Vietnamese anti-colonial organisations at large.&lt;ref name="r322"&gt;Rettig, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

As rivalries continued to exist between military and civil authorities, the military intelligence service did not completely fall under the sway of the Sûreté, but it was strongly influenced by the institutionalised cooperation and the Sûreté's style of analysing Vietnamese anti-colonial politics: it also benefited from an improved flow of information between the two intelligence agencies. Whether the institutionalised sharing of intelligence and enhanced understanding of anti-colonial organisations would lead to more effective prevention, depended largely on the internal operations of the military intelligence service. The mutiny had exposed flaws in the local and central SRM, the result of both personal and institutional deficiencies. Commandant Le Tacon, who had been responsible for organising the local SRM, had been unable to understand the graveness of the predicament despite several warnings. The central SRM may have prevented the mutiny if the officer responsible for Yên Bái, Slouchez, had informed his local contact, Tran Uc Sinh, about his leave of absence or if he had taken the required precautions of arranging cover during his absence. These oversights were particular to Yên Bái, whereas planned VNQDD mutinies in many other garrisons, such as Kien An, [[Phu Lang Thuong]], [[Nam Dinh]] and [[Sept-Pagodes]], were prevented at the last moment. The intelligence failure at Yên Bái did not reflect weaknesses in the overall organisational hierarchy of the SRM, or failures in the decentralisation measures which had started in early 1929 but which had not yet been finished.&lt;ref name="r322"/&gt;

Although Yên Bái was the exception, this did not mean that the SRM ran smoothly or that the performance standards could not be higher. A month after the mutiny, General Commandant Superior Aubert circulated SRM Notice 660, on March 11, 1930, to describe (and prescribe) the morale and techniques needed for an effective intelligence service. It stressed the importance of understanding the objectives and organisational structure of anti-colonial parties and then advised on the ways in which the revolutionary threat could be nullified. The note also deemed it necessary to remind its recipients about two earlier intelligence communications &amp;ndash; of February 25 and October 17, 1929 &amp;ndash; thus indicating that they had not been taken on board completely. One of the reasons given for this was what was seen as the complacent attitude of many officers, in assuming that they could "preserve [their] units from revolutionary propaganda" and related to this, the low morale of many European warrant officers who regarded "their [intelligence] role as ending when their working hours are over". Apart from indicating what officers should be giving their due diligence, Aubert's note also indicated the means by which critical intelligence information could be obtained. This largely depended on close collaboration with Vietnamese warrant officers who had an important intelligence role in their position as a conduit between their French masters and their Vietnamese troops. The flow of intelligence between French officers and Vietnamese warrant officers was not as smooth as desired. The French were often not tactful and discreet enough, and many were not, due to a lack of language skills or interest, "in real contact with the indigenous warrant officers." On the other hand, the Vietnamese were not very open with regard to the provision of information, and thus did not take (co-)responsibility "for the maintenance of the troops' good spirit". Despite the air of good appearance and behaviour of the Vietnamese warrant officers and tirailleurs, they often misled ltheir French superiors about their knowledge of subversive activities. This posed a major problem in intelligence gathering, necessitating the cross-checking of information, as well as threatening harsh penalties if information was withheld.&lt;ref name="r323"&gt;Rettig, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical consensus notes that irrespective of whether military duty in the France was productive or not, the time spent by the Vietnamese soldiers in France had a profound transformation on them in both the social and individual sense. Inside as well as outside the barracks, the Vietnamese servicemen were often treated more equitably than in their home country. They encountered intellectual thought not openly promulgated in Vietnam. They could relate to Frenchmen, have relations with French women, and with other colonised peoples present in France. Furthermore, they could see that France too was in a state of change. As a result of their overseas service, at least some of the returning troops would attempt to rationalise the differences between their experiences in the two countries. Coupled with the differences in colonial and metropolitan discipline, this is postulated to have bred a more critical stance towards their superiors and a more critical attitude towards the colonial order.&lt;ref name="r319"/&gt;

In addition to the measures intended to help identify, isolate or eliminate soldiers of suspect loyalty, the regulations for dismissal were liberalised. The French military authorities had long complained that the rules were biased in favour of the soldiers. They complained that while the chief French provincial administrator could dismiss a native ''Garde indigène'' without notice if they were regarded as suspect, this was virtually impossible in the army due to legal constraints. They blamed this for the higher rate of mutiny in the army. The military managed to have the regulations changed. A decree of April 8, 1930 permitted the General Commandant Superior "to discharge those soldiers who had been the object of convictions in excess of three months imprisonment by a [[military tribunal]], or who would have rendered themselves guilty of activities contrary to military duty". While the guidelines for sacking remained narrow, with only the highest officer in Indochina allowed to authorise these measures, and only under certain conditions, the last clause in the decree of April 8 could be interpreted freely.&lt;ref&gt;Rettig, pp. 319&amp;ndash;320.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnamese language skills of French officers ===

Aubert's notice stressed the importance of close contact between French officers and their Vietnamese warrant officers in order to improve the quality of intelligence, but did not discuss whether this also required French officers to improve their [[Vietnamese language]] skills. The 
annual report of 1930 considered the language was a problem because "[i]t would be . . . . desirable that the biggest possible number of officers and warrant officers had a sufficient Annamite language knowledge in order to permit them to do without an interpreter when dealing with the Tirailleurs." The report mentions the creation of a "centre of [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]]ite studies" in [[Toulouse]] as a first step in improving language skills and put high expectations on the fact that the "number of tirailleurs speaking French is increasing constantly". Such measures would ideally have increased the level of direct communication between French officers and NCOs and their Vietnamese subordinates. However, improvement in horizontal communication was not what the report principally had in mind, but rather using language skills as a tool of command to reinforce hierarchical relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Rettig, pp. 323&amp;ndash;324.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report also toyed with the concept of using specialised Vietnamese language skills as a means of gathering intelligence and to control the minds of Vietnamese troops, but discarded it. The presence of three Vietnamese language specialists at Yên Bái had been unable to stop the mutiny; the persistent anti-colonial penetration of the civil administration had occurred despite its many specialists. Furthermore, the experience of [[Roman Catholic]] missionaries indicated that language specialisation was becoming increasingly ineffective in countering the trend towards more secretive and effective anti-colonial organisation. The report thus concluded that deeper specialisation would not improve intelligence and that a degree of expertise – to improve command skills – was all that one would need.&lt;ref name="r324"&gt;Rettig, p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report further argued that excessive specialization would be counterproductive and thus detrimental. It strongly opposed extensive specialisation because it would have required long tours in Indochina, which was deemed to be detrimental to the health of the specialist. More importantly, there was a suspicion that specialists became too trusting towards their Vietnamese subordinates, to the extent of becoming indigenophiles. This was contrary to the needs and functions of a colonial army in which hierarchies and distance, even linguistic distance from subordinates had to be maintained. Finally, specialisation was said to be detrimental because it would not only make Vietnamese troops more secretive, but would very likely improve their organisational abilities, since they would need to "take even more precautions".&lt;ref name="r324"/&gt;

=== Decrease in the proportion of Vietnamese troops ===

Although the reaction, which included punishment, new regulations, SRM institutional reform, fewer Vietnamese serving in France, increased specialisation – were considerable, military and civilian authorities in both Vietnam and France did not believe them sufficient for the reassertion of control over their colonised troops. A further four decisions were implemented, aimed at striking the a stable racial balance among the troops in [[French Indochina]]. The number of ethnic Vietnamese soldiers was perceived to be too great and thus threatening in the wake of the mutiny: a safer level had to be found, in order to counterbalance what was considered to be an excessive level of numerous Vietnamese troops. This safer proportion aimed at an overall ratio among Indochina's colonial troops of 1:1 ethnic Vietnamese to European and indigenous ethnic minorities ([[Montagnard (Vietnam)|Montagnard]]s). The measures demonstrated the French distrust of Vietnamese troops and the apparent belief that the fidelity of Vietnamese soldiers was maximised by creating a racial balance within the army that was tilted towards showing all Vietnamese soldiers – and thereby the Vietnamese population at large – the futility of attempting insurrection and mutiny.&lt;ref name="r325"&gt;Rettig, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of the four measures aimed at increasing the dependability of Vietnamese soldiers which also aimed at achieving the right ethnic proportion of troops at each garrison. The lack of European troops at Yên Bái – aside from Massimi's and Le Tacon's personal failures – had been pinpointed as the cause of the mutiny. The proposal held that if the local commanding officer had more European troops at his disposal, their presence would have deterred the Vietnamese soldiers from taking part in the mutiny. Although this was plausible in that one of the leaders of the mutiny had attempted to foment his Vietnamese colleagues by pointing to the weak French presence, this internal argument overlooked the haphazard command and security procedures that had left Yên Bái vulnerable.&lt;ref name="r325"/&gt;

According to the anonymous diary of a French officer, the decision to "return to the old system of white safety garrisons next to important detachments of tirailleurs" came after an exhaustive debate between French Indochina's civilian and military authorities. The decision reversed a major reorganisation of the army that had been launched by General Aubert in 1928. Its reversal demonstrated the concern about the impact of [[revolutionary propaganda]] on the loyalty of Vietnamese troops, and the consequent uncertainty about the reliability of this instrument of colonial rule. The measure was aimed at demonstrating French strength and superiority over Vietnamese soldiers and  revolutionaries, and signified that physical power was at the heart of French colonial rule in Indochina.&lt;ref name="r326"&gt;Rettig, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:French Empire 1938.png|thumb|450px|left|The authorities considered relieving Vietnamese soldiers with troops from North Africa, where France had its largest colonial holdings.]]
The most sweeping suggestion was made by Resident Superior Robin who wanted to "completely and radically abolish all regiments of ''Tirailleurs tonkinois'' in the service in the delta and the middle regions" and relieve them with "white [Foreign] Legion or even North African Battalions". This proposal was rebuffed by General Aubert who initially advocated the abolition of four tirailleurs companies to compensate for the dispatch of a [Foreign] Legion Battalion, and the replacement of three Vietnamese companies by three Montagnard ones. Governor General Pasquier eventually reached a compromise proposal with General Aubert, which was then submitted to the Minister of Colonies. It proposed the "[abolition] of one Regiment of ''Tirailleurs Tonkinois'' [13 companies, one company HR, and four machinegun sections]".&lt;ref&gt;Rettig, pp. 326&amp;ndash;327.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two major arguments were put against any reduction in Vietnamese troops. The Cabinet of the Director of the Military Services Direction had reasoned that a reduction in the number of Vietnamese soldiers would evoke feelings of bitterness among dismissed soldiers and turn them into "declared enemies of France". The more prominent argument was that it would weaken the defence of French Indochina. The second argument was repeated robustly in the Colonial Consultative Defence Council's advice to the Minister of Colonies, reasoning that the reduction in the number of Indochinese troops in Indochina could not "be envisaged under any pretext" because of the "necessities of external defence". Despite the counter-arguments, the abolition of two Annamite battalions was enacted. Policy strategists calculated that the reduction in Vietnamese troops could be made up by a concomitant increase in the number of European and ethnic minority troops.&lt;ref name="r327"&gt;Rettig, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third decision made with the objective achieving a safer racial ratio in the army was the "[r]einforcement of the occupation corps' troops by three white battalions: one Foreign Legion battalion, [and] two Colonial Infantry battalions". This decision was causally linked to the first two decrees and complemented them. If European troops were placed next to Vietnamese ones, then despite the reduction in Vietnamese troops by two battalions, more European troops would be needed. As the Colonial Consultative Defence Council had informed the Minister of Colonies that the overall level of troops in Indochina could not be reduced for external defence reasons, this necessitated the replacement of at least the two disbanded Vietnamese battalions.&lt;ref&gt;Rettig, pp. 327&amp;ndash;328.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the mutiny, the Department of War had clearly indicated that it would not be able "to provide for one more European Battalion in Indochina in the 1931 Budget" due to fiscal constraints, manpower shortages and organizational problems. The Yên Bái mutiny prompted generated the political will to send more European troops to French Indochina. As early as mid-March 1930, the Colonial Consultative Defence Committee informed the Colonies Minister that the forces stationed in Tonkin would be increased by a European Colonial Infantry Battalion. However, the fear in the aftermath of the mutiny situation was such that a political decision to send two rather than one battalion. It was complemented
by "the urgent dispatch of a Foreign Legion Battalion to Tonkin", an action ordered by the French government on April 30, 1930. Aside from replacing two Vietnamese battalions with three French battalions, the French authorities also increased the number and proportion of ethnic minorities among the Indochinese troops. As such, the "[i]ntensification of recruitment of non-Annamite indigenous people: [[Thổ people|Thos]], [[Lao people|Laotians]], Mois, [[Cambodian people|Cambodians]] was decided." The aim was to attain increase the non-Vietnamese percentage to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;Rettig, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Public Health''' ({{lang-th|กระทรวงสาธารณสุข}}; {{RTGS|''krasuang satharana suk''}}; [[Abbreviation|Abrv:]] MOPH), is a [[Thailand|Thai]] governmental body responsible for the oversight of [[Health in Thailand|public health in Thailand]].

==History==
In Thailand before 1888 there were no permanent, public hospitals to provide care to sick people. Temporary hospitals were set up to care for patients during epidemics, then disbanded when the epidemic subsided. Under King [[Chulalongkorn]] (Rama V) a hospital was constructed and completed in 1888 and named "[[Siriraj Hospital]]" in commemoration of the king's young son, Prince [[Siriraj Kakudhabhand]], who had died of dysentery.&lt;ref name=MOPH&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Public Health|url=http://eng.moph.go.th/index.php/about-us/history-of-public-health|website=Ministry of Public Health|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of [[King Rama VIII]], the Ministry of Public Health was established on 10 March 1942 as a result of the enactment of the Ministries and Departments Reorganization Act (Amendment No. 3) of B.E. 2485. Later in 1966, the date 27 November was chosen as the commemoration day of the Ministry of Public Health's foundation.&lt;ref name="MOPH" /&gt;

The Committee aimed to "aid workers [to] organize and defend themselves against terror and suppression",&lt;ref name="Harlan Miners Speak"/&gt; and was described as an "'invading body' whose mission is to enter the Kentucky coal-fields, 'inform the American public of what is going on' and 'persuade officials [...] to a more equitable course of action'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Catherine Mary McLoughlin|title=Martha Gellhorn: The War Writer in the Field and in the Text|date=15 Sep 2007|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719076367|page=41|edition=illustrated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bwMk-k-jd0AC&amp;pg=PA41|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''No Commercial Airport at Whenuapai Airbase Party''' was a local political party in [[New Zealand]] which opposed the transformation of Auckland's [[Whenuapai]] airbase into a commercial airport.

The party was inspired by the success of the Whenuapai Airbase Action Group (Waag) in turning the fate of the airbase into a political issue during the 2007 local body elections.

The party applied to register a logo with the Electoral Commission on 21 April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.org.nz/news/ec-media-noairport-210408.html New Zealand Electoral Commission: Application to register a political party logo]&lt;/ref&gt;  The party however failed to apply for formal registration so was limited to its sole candidate at the 2008 election.

It ran a single electorate candidate in 2008 and received 238 electorate votes.  It did not run in the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 election]].

In the local body elections of October 2007, the pro-airport North Shore City mayor was defeated by an anti-airport mayoral candidate with indications that the airport issue was the most important of factors considered by voters.&lt;ref&gt;Crothers, Charles: "Candidates, Issues and Outcomes", AUT University.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, North Shore City Council reversed support for a Whenuapai International Airport while the Waitakere City Council remained in favour. In 2010, all councils were amalgamated into the new [[Auckland Council]] and therefore support for a commercial airport was dropped.

[[File:Oxford Falls Peace Park.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Oxford Falls Peace Park]]

==Community uses==
The park is the home to [[Warringah Council]]'s [[ANZAC Day]] ceremonies.
It is also home to many celebrations and services throughout the year. Oxford Falls Grammar School, across the road from the Peace Park, often provides bands to play commemorative music on these special days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Falls Peace Park|url=https://www.warringah.nsw.gov.au/play/community-centres/oxford-falls-peace-park|website=Warringah Council|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Oxford Falls Peace Park Memorial and old school building.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Oxford Falls Peace Park Memorial and old school building]] The Oxford Falls Public School first opened in the small Church of England at Oxford Falls in 1928 with eight enrolments. The present building on the Peace Park site was built in 1930. With the school's closure in 1986, the schoolhouse was threatened with demolition but with the assistance of a local campaign and the support of Warringah Council, including the local D Riding councillor [[Paul Couvret]], the peace park was created and the school now serves as a community hall and is the site of the annual ANZAC day [[Dawn service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morcombe|first1=John|title=Treasured one-room schoolhouse stands the test of time|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/northern-beaches/treasured-oneroom-schoolhouse-stands-the-test-of-time/story-fngr8hax-1227122105656|accessdate=8 September 2015|agency=Manly Daily|publisher=News Corp Limited|date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pax Praetoriana''''' (or '''''Pax Pretoriana''''') refers to the relative stability of modern [[South Africa]] and the ([[economics|economically]] and [[politics|politically]]) dominant [[foreign policy]] of the country towards the [[Africa]]n continent and its encouragement of stable, accountable, democratic governments in other African states. The term ''[[Pax Nigeriana]]'' is sometimes used in relation to [[Nigeria]]'s similar status. Both these terms derive from the expression ''[[Pax Romana]]'' &amp;ndash; the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] peace. The term ''Praetoriana'' also derives from [[Pretoria]], the administrative capital city of South Africa.

Critics of South African foreign policy (including political allies of the [[African National Congress|ANC]] such as the trade union organization [[COSATU]]), especially under former president [[Thabo Mbeki]], point to domestic problems such as [[unemployment]], [[crime]] and the scourge of [[AIDS]] that remain unresolved, and question the value of the ANC's policy of "quiet diplomacy" towards the [[Zimbabwe]]an government during its current period of repressive rule.

The term has also been used to describe the dominant position of South Africa over its neighbors in the pre-1994 era, forcing agreements such as the [[Nkomati Accord]] between South Africa and [[Mozambique]] and a non-aggression treaty with [[Swaziland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6103">'''Poglish''', '''Polglish''' or '''Ponglish''' (in [[Polish language|Polish]], often rendered "'''''Polglisz'''''"), is a linguistic blend of two words, or a [[portmanteau]] in [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[English language|English]], designates the product of [[Macaronic language|macaronically]] mixing [[Polish language|Polish-]] and [[English language|English-language]] elements ([[morpheme]]s, [[word]]s, [[grammar|grammatical structure]]s, [[syntax|syntactic element]]s, [[idiom]]s, etc.) within a single [[Speech communication|speech]] production, or the use of "[[false friends]]" and of [[cognate]] words in senses that have diverged from those of the common [[etymological]] root. Such combining or confusion of Polish and English elements, when it occurs within a single [[word]], [[terminology|term]] or [[phrase]] (e.g., in a [[hybrid word]]), may, inadvertently or deliberately,  produce a [[neologism]].

Poglish is a common phenomenon among persons [[bilingual]] in Polish and English. Poglish is a manifestation of a broader phenomenon, that of [[Language transfer#Examples|language interference]]. As is the case with the mixing of other language pairs, the results of Poglish speech (oral or written) may sometimes be confusing, amusing or embarrassing.

Variant names for this linguistic melange include "Polglish", "Pinglish" and "Ponglish".  A term sometimes used by native Polish-speakers is "Half ''na pół''" ("Half-and-half").

==Mis-metaphrase==
One of the two chief approaches to [[translation]], "[[metaphrase]]"{{mdash}} also referred to as "[[Dynamic and formal equivalence|formal equivalence]]", "[[literal translation]]", or "word-for-word translation"{{mdash}} must be used with great care especially in relation to [[idiom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "The Translator's Endless Toil," ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XXVIII, no. 2, 1983, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Madeleine Masson]], in her biography of the [[Poland|Polish]] [[World War II]] [[Special Operations Executive|S.O.E.]] agent [[Krystyna Skarbek]], quotes her as speaking of ''lying {{strong|on}} the sun'' and astutely surmises that this is "possibly a direct [[translation]] from the Polish".&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Masson, ''Christine:  a Search for [[Christine Granville]]...'', London, Hamish Hamilton, 1975, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;   Indeed, the Polish [[idiom]] ''{{lang|pl|leżeć {{strong|na}} słońcu}}'' ("to lie {{strong|on}} the sun", that is, [[sunbathe]]) is, if anything, only marginally less absurd than its [[English language|English]] [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalent]], ''to lie {{strong|in}} the sun''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Krystyna Skarbek...," ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XLIX, no. 3, 2004, p. 950.&lt;/ref&gt;

=="False friends"==
Some erroneous [[lexeme|lexemic]] substitutions made by ''[[Polish diaspora|Polonia]]'', members of the [[Poland|Polish]] [[diaspora]], are attributable not to mis-[[translation#The term and the concept|metaphrase]] but to confusion of similar-''appearing'' [[word]]s ([[false cognate]]s and "[[false friend]]s") which otherwise do not share, respectively, a common [[etymology]] or a common [[meaning (linguistic)|meaning]].

Thus, some Poles living in [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] countries, when speaking of "''cashing'' a check", will erroneously say "''kasować'' czek" ("to ''cancel'' a check") rather than the correct "''realizować'' czek" ("to ''cash'' a check").

==Latin calques==
A remarkably high proportion of Polish [[terminology|term]]s actually have precise [[Translation#The term and the concept|metaphrastic]] [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalent]]s in English, traceable to the fact that both these [[Indo-European languages]] have been [[calque]]d, since the [[Middle Ages]], on the same [[Latin]] roots.

=="Chicago Polish"==
Some [[Chicago Polonia|Polish expatriates in Chicago]] speak Poglish on a daily basis, especially those who have lived there a long time. The most common phenomenon is the [[Polonization]] of English words. A Polonian attempting to speak this kind of Polish-English melange in Poland would have great difficulty making himself understood.

==In popular culture==
[[Anthony Burgess]]' novel, ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', has been translated in Poland by [[Robert Stiller]] into two versions: one rendered from the book's original English-Russian melange into a Polish-Russian melange as ''Mechaniczna pomarańcza, wersja R'' (A Mechanical Orange, version R); the other, into a Polish-English melange as ''Nakręcana pomarańcza, wersja A'' ["A" standing for the Polish word for "English"] (A Wind-Up Orange, version A). The latter, Polish-English version makes a fairly convincing Poglish text.

[[BBC Look North (East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire)]] Television produced a report on Poglish in [[Boston, Lincolnshire]], which has a large Polish population.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7500077.stm]

A large number of English-derived neologisms exist in Polish, especially spoken by the youth in Poland. Phonetically-read English words such as "szoping" {{IPA|[ˈʃɔpiŋk]}} ("shopping") tend to occur; they are seen as an element of slang.

The '''Political Studies Association''' ('''PSA''') is a [[learned society]] in the [[United Kingdom]] which exists to develop and promote the study of [[politics]]. It is the leading association in its field in the United Kingdom, with an international membership including academics in political science and current affairs, theorists and practitioners, policy makers, researchers and students in higher education.

The PSA was founded in 1950, following the establishment of the [[International Political Science Association]] in 1949, and was initially supported by a grant from [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psa.ac.uk/publications/brochure/PSA_Brochure.pdf |title=Political Studies UK: Studying, Teaching and Researching Politics in the United Kingdom |publisher=Political Studies Association |date=2004 |accessdate=2008-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925034755/http://www.psa.ac.uk/publications/brochure/PSA_Brochure.pdf |archivedate=September 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PSA has a network of over fifty "Specialist Groups" that provide a research focus for members and receive support from the PSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psa.ac.uk/psa-communities/specialist-groups |title=Political Studies Association: Specialist Groups|publisher=Political Studies Association |date=2007 |accessdate=2016-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
The PSA publishes four [[academic journals|journals]]: 
* ''[[British Journal of Politics and International Relations]]''
* ''[[Political Studies (journal)|Political Studies]]'': publishes research in all areas of politics and international relations. The journal's approach is not dominated by a particular methodological or theoretical framework.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9657">From 1920 to 1934, '''Rabkrin''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Рабо́че-крестья́нская инспе́кция, Рабкри́н, РКИ, RKI; Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate, WPI) was a governmental establishment in the [[Soviet Union]] responsible for scrutinizing the state, local, and enterprise administrations.

==Beginnings of Rabkrin==
Beginning on February 7, 1920, the Soviet Central Executive Committee established the Rabkrin to succeed the People’s Commissariat for State Control. The term "Rabkrin" comes from the Russian title Narodnyi Kommissariat Raboche or the People’s Commissariat of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspectorate.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, E.A. State Control in Soviet Russia: The Rise and Fall of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspectorate, 1920-1934. London: Palgrave Macmillan, 1987. 20-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rabkrin was put in place to ensure the effectiveness of the newly created Soviet Government, which had experienced bureaucratic turmoil beginning with the [[Russian Revolution]] and had continued into the [[Russian Civil War]]. While the People’s Commissariat for State Control was a key institute for creating the Soviet Union, its mismanagement of bureaucratic control led [[Vladimir Lenin]] to disband the council, replacing it with a more manageable division of government authority. The former commissar of the People’s Commissariat for State Control, [[Joseph Stalin]], was placed in charge of the newly formed agency. Rabkrin was to signal a new beginning of Soviet administration. Since it was a creation of the Soviet Union, it had no connection to the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuromiya, Hiroaki. Stalin’s Industrial Revolution: Politics and Workers, 1928-1931. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==During Lenin &amp; Stalin Administrations==
Polish biographer [[Isaac Deutscher]] described Rabkrin as follows:

“The Rabkrin ... was set up to control every branch of the administration, from top to bottom, with a view to eliminating the two major faults, inefficiency and corruption, which the Soviet civil service had inherited from its Tsarist predecessor. It was to act as the stern and enlightened auditor for the whole rickety and creaking governmental machine; to expose abuses of power and red tape; and to train an élite of reliable civil servants for every branch of the government. The [Rabkrin] acted through teams of workers and peasants who were free at any time to enter the offices of any Commissariat and watch the work done there.... The whole bizarre scheme of inspection was one of Lenin's pet ideas. Exasperated by the inefficiency and dishonesty of the civil service, he sought to remedy them by extreme and ruthless "control from below," and the [Rabkrin] was to be the means.... The mill of officialdom, however, turned the workers themselves into bureaucrats. The Commissariat of the Inspectorate, as Lenin was to discover later on, became an additional source of muddle, corruption, and bureaucratic intrigue. In the end it became an unofficial but meddlesome police in charge of the civil service.”&lt;ref&gt;Deutshcer, Isaac. Stalin: A Political Biography. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1967. 230-231.&lt;/ref&gt; 	

During its first three years of operation, Rabkrin was crucial in the development of the growing communist state. The Central Bureau of Complaints (Biuro Zhalob) was a Rabkrin department whose sole purpose was to find and eliminate inefficiency within the state’s administration. Any Soviet citizen could file a complaint against a government official through this bureau. Lenin saw this as giving a voice to the people and a say in their government. After failing its goals and having been severely criticized, among others by Lenin himself, in 1923, it was merged with the [[CPSU Party Control Committee]] to become a joint control organ (PCC-WPI, TsKK-RKI) under a common chairman to oversee state, economy, and the Communist Party. With Stalin’s rise to power after Lenin’s 1924 death, the Complaint Bureau became a more sinister tool for the new leader. The Complaint Bureau was now used as a tactic to encourage Soviet citizens to provide detailed accounts, including evidence and witnesses, of other comrades opposing the state or being part of anti-communist organizations. Many complaints were followed by quick court hearings for the accused, most cases were then decided upon with or without evidence. In 1929, the Rabkrin Complaint Bureau was combined with the [[All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions]] Complaint Bureau, another Soviet administrative establishment in charge of worker unionization. This merger led to a rise in complaints from both agriculture and industrial sectors until 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Peter H. Reforming Justice in Russia, 1864-1996: Power, Culture, and the Limits of Legal Order. Armonk: M.E. Sharpe, 1997. 171-173.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his ascension to [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], Stalin left the post of commissar to his trusted ally [[Grigory Ordzhonikidze]]. Under new leadership, Rabkrin pushed for more industrial/military efficiency from other Soviet economic establishments, most notably the Supreme Soviet of the National Economy ([[Vesenkha]]) and the State Planning Commission ([[Gosplan]]). Along with Stalin’s [[first five-year plan]], Rabkrin became responsible for seeking new industrial investments to reach maximum output with minimum input. From 1929 to 1932, power struggles between Vesenkha, which was responsible for increasing industrialization, and Rabkrin became more evident. Constant investigations into Vensenkha’s industrial efficiency led to claims from Rabkrin of neglect and deception; however, much of the inquires were falsified, which represented the chaotic nature of Soviet bureaucratic control.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, Shelia. “Ordzhonikidze’s Takeover of Vesenkha: A Case Study in Soviet Bureaucratic Politics.” Soviet Studies Vol. 37, no. 2 (1985): 153-172.&lt;/ref&gt; The investigations of other Soviet institutions went hand in hand with the removal of old [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] party members during the early stages of the [[Great Purge]]. Stalin and his administration believed certain individuals within Soviet establishments, like Vesenkha, were purposely sabotaging the economic growth of the Soviet Union. Rabkrin investigations were convenient in providing enough evidence to place convictions on thousands of government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, David R. Industry, State, and Society in Stalin’s Russia, 1926-1934. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1996. 87-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Food (Soviet Union)|People’s Commissariat of Agriculture]], Rabkrin investigations led to departmental dissatisfaction. Many officials felt the overpowered Soviet institution was abusing its power and making it difficult for [[Collectivized|collectivized agriculture]] to succeed under strict procedures. Soviet peasants met the same criticism as internal departments, peasants were reported as drunks, debauchers, and saboteurs who went against the Communist Party and its attempts for mass collectivization. Most of these reports were false and wrongly depicted the life of the peasantry, but justified to place extreme quotas on the agriculture sector. By constantly keeping the peasantry busy, they were less likely to take part in immoral behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Heinzen, James W. Inventing a Soviet Countryside: State Power and the Transformation of Rural Russia, 1917-1929. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2004. 109, 111-113.&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of Rabkrin==
From November 1930 to October 1931, [[Andrey Andreyev (politician)|Andrei Andreyev]] headed Rabkrin. Like his predecessor, Ordzhonikidze, Andreyev pushed for greater industrial growth as well as military expansion. From October 1931 to January 1934, [[Yan Rudzutak]] replaced him as head of the People’s Commissariat of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspectorate. After the success of the first five-year plan, the Soviet economy had entered a period of expansion and financial security. Compared to other world powers at the time, which were experiencing the impacts of the [[Great Depression]], the Soviet economy seemed unstoppable from an external perspective. At the [[17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party]], feeling its purpose had been served in creating a more efficient administrative and economic structure, Rabkrin was dissolved and its functions were passed on to the [[People's Control Commission|People’s Control Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Rees, E.A. State Control in Soviet Russia: The Rise and Fall of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspectorate, 1920-1934. London: Palgrave Macmillan, 1987. 147-150.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the People’s Control Commission became responsible for productivity, an increase in labor unions became a support system for many Soviet citizens in the industrial areas, leading to less chaos caused by bureaucratic control. While Rabkrin is remembered for its restrictions and its confrontations with other Soviet establishments, under Stalin’s reign, it did meet limited success in assisting in the creation of the Soviet economy.&lt;ref&gt;Kuromiya, Hiroaki.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10512">'''Racial formation theory''' is an analytical tool in [[sociology]], developed by [[Michael Omi]] and [[Howard Winant]], which is used to look at [[race (classification of humans)|race]] as a socially constructed [[identity formation|identity]], where the content and importance of racial categories are determined by social, economic, and political forces.{{sfn|Omi|Winant|2015|pp=105–36}}  Unlike other traditional race theories, "In [Omi and Winant's] view, racial meanings pervade US society, extending from the shaping of individual racial identities to the structuring of collective political action on the terrain of the state".{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1986|p=66}}

== Race concept ==
In order to delve further into the topic of racial formation, it is important to explore the question of what "race" is.  Racial formation theory is a framework that has the objective of deconstructing race as it exists today in the United States. To do this, the authors first explore the historical development of race as a dynamic and fluid [[social construct]]. This goes against the dominant discourses on race, which see race as a static and unchanging concept based purely on physical and genetic criteria.

Instead of claiming race as something that is concrete, where the person's biology and upbringing are what shape racial identity, Omi and Winant suggest that race is something that is fluid, where "the racial order is organized and enforced by the continuity and reciprocity between micro-level and macro-level of social relations".{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1986|p=67}}

In the above definition, the "micro-level" [[social relation]]s refer to "the ways in which we understand ourselves and interact with others, the structuring of our practical activity in work and family, as citizens and as thinkers",{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1986|pp=66–67}}  basically, a person's individual interactions with other people.

The "macro-level" social relations refer to the [[social structure]]s and common [[ideologies]] of a society. Relevant social structures include collective organizations like businesses, the media, and the government, and the common ideologies include cultural and [[stereotypical]] beliefs on race, [[class (social)|class]], sexuality, and gender.

Omi and Winant also believe that "race [is] an unstable and 'de-centered' complex of social meanings constantly being transformed by political struggle".{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1986|p=68}}  Because of this, people are able to constantly contest the definition of race both in the micro- and the macro-level.

== Functions and origin of racial discrimination ==
Throughout modern history, people have assigned identity based on race, both as a means of distinguishing one group from another, but more importantly as a means of control. The dominant culture assigns identity to [[minority group]]s as a means of separating them, diminishing their status, and maintaining control over them. Often, this distinction is made simply on the basis of skin color. Through this mechanism of assigning identity, race becomes a political weapon of the majority that has several limiting effects on the oppressed group: 
* determines freedom of movement within the society
* limits upward mobility from class to class
* prohibits or minimizes economic gain
* has a psychological impact on how the oppressed individual perceives themselves and exists within the confines of the limiting social expectations that have been imposed upon them.

=== Origin of racism as a justification for ethnocentrism ===
Omi and Winant argue that the concept of race developed gradually and was created to justify and explain inequality and [[genocide]] that is characteristic of European colonization. The expropriation of property, the denial of political rights, the introduction of [[slavery]] and other forms of coercive labor, well as outright extermination, all presupposed a worldview which distinguished European – children of God, human beings, etc. – from "others".  Such a worldview was needed to explain why some should be "free" and others enslaved, why some had rights to land while others did not. Race and the interpretation of racial differences were central factors in that worldview.
 
The need for a justification for institutionalized [[racial discrimination]] led to the "biological essentialist" framework.  In this framework, White European Americans were viewed as being born inherently superior.  Religious debates also flared over the role of race in definitions of humanity: "Arguments took place over creation itself, as theories of polygenesis questioned whether God had made only one species of humanity ('monogenesis')."{{sfn|Rothenberg|2006|pp=13–14}}

In their book ''Racial Formation'', Omi and Winant present race as a relatively recent phenomenon in the United States.{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1994|p=58}}  They describe how race becomes established in social consciousness, even without anyone having an explicit intention to perpetuate it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Everybody learns some combination, some version, of the rules of racial classification, and of their own racial identity, often without obvious teaching or conscious inculcation. Race becomes 'common sense' – a way of comprehending, explaining, and acting in the world.{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1994|p=106}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Race was legitimated through science ===
There was also a scientific preoccupation with the idea of race. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries in particular, some of the most respected scientists of the time took up the question of [[racial superiority]]. Many of them concluded that White Europeans were, in fact, superior based on studies on everything from [[cranial capacity]] to [[social Darwinism]].

This scientific debate was not, however, a purely academic one. It was a central icon of public fascination, often in the popular magazines of the time. Even today, scientists are still working on finding a genetic basis for racial categorization. None of these efforts has been successful in defining race in an empirical and objective way.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

Racial formation theory examines race as a dynamic social construct with inherent structural barriers, ideologies and individual actions, whereas the biological essentialist understands individual deficiency as the basis for racial marginalization and oppression.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

== Calling for a "racial formation perspective" ==
According to Omi and Winant, a "racial formation perspective" is needed to explain race as "an autonomous field of social conflict, political organizations, and cultural/ideological meaning".{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1994|p=52}} The second part of their book is an elaboration of this racial formation perspective.

Omi and Winant define "racial formation" as "the process by which social, economic and political forces determine the content and importance of racial categories, and by which they are in turn shaped by racial meanings".{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1994|p=61}} The racial formation perspective emphasizes the extent to which race is a social and political construction that operates at two levels, the micro (individual identity) and the macro (collective social structure). The two levels interact to form a racial social movement when individuals at the micro level are mobilized in response to political racial injustice at the macro level.

=== Race as seen through the racial formation perspective ===
Becoming a citizen of this society is the process of learning to see race – that is, to ascribe social meanings and qualities to otherwise meaningless biological features. And in turn, race consciousness figures centrally in the building of a collective body of knowledge without which we could not make sense of the world around us – a body of knowledge that Omi and Winant call "racial common sense". That describes the associations we make between individual characteristics, preferences, behaviors, and attitudes and a particular physical appearance or perceived group membership.{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1986|p=60}}

=== Racial formation guides our expectations ===

Those expectations will guide all our daily interactions.{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1986|p=59}}  Individuals that do not perform according to our racial expectations disrupt this micro-level process. Omi and Winant provide several illustrative examples of this disruption of expectations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The black banker harassed by police while walking in casual clothes through his own well-off neighborhood, the Latino or white kid rapping in perfect Afro patois, the unending faux pas committed by whites who assume that the non-whites they encounter are servants or tradespeople, the belief that non-white colleagues are less qualified persons hired to fulfill affirmative action guidelines...{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1986|p=59}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When our racial expectations are violated, our reactions can betray our "preconceived notions of a racialized social structure".{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1986|p=59}} There are many racial projects dispersed throughout society that "mediate between discursive or representational means in which race is identified and signified on the one hand, and the institutional and organizational forms in which is it routinized and standardized on the other".{{sfn|Omi|Winant|1986|p=60}}

The '''Reggio revolt''' occurred in [[Reggio Calabria]], [[Italy]], from July 1970 to February 1971. The cause of the protests was a government decision to make [[Catanzaro]], not Reggio, regional capital of [[Calabria]].&lt;ref name=paoli198/&gt;&lt;ref name=partridge50&gt;Partridge, ''Italian politics today'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=I-5OR8tDkEIC&amp;pg=PA50 p. 50]&lt;/ref&gt; The nomination of a regional capital was the result of a decentralization programme of the Italian government, under which 15 governmental regions were created and given their own administrative councils and a measure of local autonomy.&lt;ref name=time261070&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100628183459/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904398-2,00.html No Saints in Paradise], Time Magazine, Oct. 26, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Image:Fatti di Reggio Cittadini210171.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Manifest produced during the events]]
Protest in Reggio Calabria exploded in July 1970 when the much smaller town of Catanzaro (with a population of 82,000 against 160,000 in Reggio) was chosen as the regional capital of Calabria. The people of Reggio blamed their rivals' success to "the Red Barons" in Rome, a group of influential centre-left Calabrian politicians from Cosenza and Catanzaro, including Deputy Prime Minister [[Giacomo Mancini]].&lt;ref name=time261070/&gt;

On July 14, a general strike was called and five days of street fighting left one dead and several policemen injured.&lt;ref name=time261070/&gt;&lt;ref name=rep050108&gt;{{it icon}} [http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2008/01/05/la-brutta-avventura-di-reggio-calabria.html La brutta avventura di Reggio Calabria], La Repubblica, January 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A force of 5,000 armed police and [[carabinieri]] was moved into the area. The national government ordered state-owned [[RAI TV]] not to report on the insurrection. Nevertheless, the revolt steadily picked up steam and sympathy.&lt;ref name=time261070/&gt;

Drawn out road and railway blockades damaged the entire country. Strikes, barricades and wrecked railway tracks forced trains from the north of Italy to halt two hours short of Reggio. Italy's main north-south autostrada, the Highway of the Sun, was closed off. When the port of Reggio was blocked, hundreds of lorries and railroad freight cars were forced to remain on the other side of the [[Straits of Messina]].&lt;ref name=time261070/&gt;

==Neofascists taking over==
The revolt was taken over by young [[neofascist]]s of the [[Italian Social Movement]] (''Movimento Sociale Italiano'' – MSI) backed by the [['Ndrangheta]], a [[Mafia]]-type criminal organisation based in Calabria,&lt;ref name=paoli198&gt;Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt171070&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/17/archives/troops-are-sent-into-italian-city-4500-ferried-to-rebellious-reggio.html Troops Are Sent Into Italian City], The New York Times, October 17, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ind040296&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/town-the-mafia-shut-down-1317203.html Town the mafia shut down], The Independent, 4 February 1996&lt;/ref&gt; the [[De Stefano 'ndrina]] in particular.&lt;ref name=broken&gt;Paoli, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=K616GHp62UkC&amp;pg=PA42 Broken bonds: Mafia and politics in Sicily]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francesco Franco]], a trade union leader from the [[General Labour Union (Italy)|National Italian Workers' Union]] (CISNAL) close to the neofascist movement became the informal leader of the rebel Action Committee and of the revolt. "Boia chi molla" ([[:it:Boia chi molla|it]]) (Death to him who gives up) was the right-wing rallying cry during the revolt.&lt;ref name=archivio&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.archivio900.it/it/documenti/doc.aspx?id=31 La Rivolta di Reggio Calabria], Archivio'900&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Italian press labeled the demonstrators fascists and hooligans against the center‐left Government in Rome,&lt;ref name=nyt010271&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/01/archives/disorders-and-a-general-strike-again-paralyze-reggio-calabria.html Disorders and a General Strike Again Paralyze Reggio Calabria], The New York Times, February 1, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; but according to [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] the revolt cut across class barriers, quoting Reggio's mayor at the time, Pietro Battaglia, who declared that it was a "citizens' revolt".&lt;ref name=time261070/&gt;

On July 22, 1970, a bomb exploded on "Treno del Sole", the [[Palermo]]-[[Turin]] train, in the Calabrian city of [[Gioia Tauro]], killing 6 persons and wounding 136. The [[Gioia Tauro massacre]] was linked to the revolt. In 1993, the former member of the 'Ndrangheta, Giacomo Lauro, said he had supplied the explosives to people linked to the leaders of the revolt.&lt;ref name=rep050108/&gt; The 'Ndrangheta was ready to support the subversive forces. Party and union headquarters were bombed, as well as the cars of politicians accused of treason and shops because they did not join the strikes.&lt;ref name=rep050108/&gt;

In the period from July–September 1970, there were 19 days of general strikes, 32 road blocks, 12 bomb attacks, 14 occupations of the railway station and two of the post office, as well as the airport and the local TV station. The local prefecture was assaulted six times and the police headquarters four times; 426 people were charged with public order offences.&lt;ref name=ginsborg156&gt;Ginsborg, '' A History of Contemporary Italy: 1943-80'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=nkodznkxb7EC&amp;pg=RA1-PR156 pp. 156-57]&lt;/ref&gt; By their own admission, many of the urban-guerilla style actions during the revolt were coordinated and led by members of [[National Vanguard (Italy)|National Vanguard]].&lt;ref name=ferraresi67&gt;Ferraresi, ''Threats to Democracy'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=r0DG3uk9o8oC&amp;pg=PA67 p. 67]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 1970, Franco was arrested along with other leaders of the revolt on charges of incitement in a police sweep that targeted some 100 people. The news about the arrest provoked violent reactions, in particular in the dilapidated Sbarre suburb.&lt;ref name=nyt200970&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/20/archives/italian-city-is-paralyzed-by-sixth-day-of-turmoil.html Italian City Is Paralyzed By Sixth Day of Turmoil], The New York Times, September 20, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Two armories were stormed and about five hundred people attacked the police station.&lt;ref name=nyt180970&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/18/archives/protesters-in-italy-fire-on-police-from-cathedral-one-man-killed-in.html Protesters in Italy Fire on Police From Cathedral], The New York Times, September 18, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; At least 6,000 police men were deployed from many parts of Italy to try to stop the violence.&lt;ref name=nyt210970&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/21/archives/6000-policemen-are-deployed-in-tense-southern-italian-city.html 6,000 Policemen Are Deployed In Tense Southern Italian City], The New York Times, September 21, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Franco was released on December 23, 1970.

After three police officers were shot and wounded in October 1970, Prime Minister [[Emilio Colombo]] decided to tackle the conflict.&lt;ref name=time261070/&gt; Colombo warned that the Government would resort to force to restore order if necessary. Some 4,500 soldiers were sent to Reggio Calabria; it was the Italian Army's first assignment to crush civil disorder in 25 years.&lt;ref name=nyt171070/&gt; The decision on the location of Calabria's government was declared "provisional" and an assurance was given that the issue would be discussed in the Italian parliament for a final decision.&lt;ref name=time261070/&gt; Tensions subsided for a while, but new protests and violence broke out in January 1971 when the Parliament  decided that the regional assembly had to designate the capital of Calabria.&lt;ref name=nyt010271/&gt;

==End of the conflict==
[[File:Repubblica di sbarre centrali.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Typed proclamation of the Sbarre Central Republic]]
On January 31, 1971, four leaders of the rebel Action Committee were arrested on charges for instigating violence.&lt;ref name=nyt010271/&gt; Francesco Franco was able to escape arrest initially, but was arrested on June 5, 1971, after a scuffle at a neo-fascist party rally in Rome.&lt;ref name=ap070671&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19710607&amp;id=aB1OAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2ewDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5813,2657856 Leader of Revolt Arrested in Italy], Associated Press, June 7, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1971, journalist [[Oriana Fallaci]] had been able to interview the fugitive Franco for ''[[L'Europeo]]''. He  explained that many potentially leftist youths "today are fascists simply because they believe that the battle of Reggio is interpreted fairly only by the fascists."&lt;ref name=rep050108/&gt;

On February 23, 1971, armored cars entered the Sbarre neighbourhood, where a short-lived Central Sbarre Republic (''Repubblica di Sbarre Centrali'') had been proclaimed, and finally suppressed the revolt. According to official figures of the Italian Ministry of the Interior there were 3 dead, and 190 policemen and 37 civilians wounded. Other sources mention 5 dead and hundreds of wounded.&lt;ref name=archivio/&gt;

The so-called Colombo Package (named after then Prime minister [[Emilio Colombo]]) offering to build the Fifth Steelwork Centre in Reggio including a railroad stump and the port in [[Gioia Tauro]], an investment of 3 billion lire which would create 10,000 jobs, softened the people of Reggio and helped to quell the revolt.&lt;ref name=archivio/&gt;&lt;ref name=ginsborg156/&gt; The issue of Calabria's capital was resolved by a [[Solomonic decision]]: Catanzaro and Reggio Calabria became Calabria's joint regional capitals, Catanzaro as the seat of the regional administration and Reggio Calabria as the seat of the regional parliament.&lt;ref name=ginsborg156/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt160271&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/16/archives/vote-for-a-capital-in-south-italy-lost-by-reggio-calabria.html Vote for a Capital In South Italy Lost By Reggio Calabria], The New York Times, February 16, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolt defies any attempt to schematic classification. Issues of employment (the capital meant safe jobs in an economically depressed city) and local pride intermingled; it was mainly a matter of identity.&lt;ref name=rep050108/&gt; The revolt ended up by being taken over by neo-fascists&lt;ref name=nyt220373&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/22/archives/reggio-calabria-goes-back-to-the-barricades.html Reggio Calabria Goes Back to the Barricades], The New York Times, March 22, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; (relevant was also the role of the militant neo-fascist movement [[National Vanguard (Italy)|National Vanguard]]&lt;ref name=ferraresi67/&gt;) and led to unexpected electoral fortunes for the Italian Social Movement at the [[Italian general election, 1972|Italian general election]] in May 1972, when Franco was elected senator. The neo-fascists benefitted, because the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]] were divided, while the city was one of its fiefdoms, and the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) supported the suppression of the riots.&lt;ref name=rep050108/&gt;

==Aftermath== 
In October 1972, the main left wing labour unions led by the [[Italian General Confederation of Labour]] organized a conference in Reggio to regain their influence. Twenty trains were chartered to bring workers from northern and central Italy. On one of the trains full of workers and trade unionists a [[1972 bombings in Italy|bomb exploded leaving five injured]]. Two other bombs burst on the rails in the vicinity of Lamezia Terme, while other unexploded bombs were found along the same railway line.&lt;ref name=archivio/&gt; Despite the attacks, many did reach Reggio to attend the conference and street march. Franco was investigated for distributing leaflets hostile to the anti-fascist demonstration.&lt;ref name=atti020273&gt;{{it icon}} [http://legislature.camera.it/_dati/leg06/lavori/stenografici/sed0081/sed0081.pdf Seduta di venerdì 2 febbraio 1973] Atti Parlamentari, Camera dei Deputati, February 2, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent judicial investigations of charges of provocation and terrorism ended with his acquittal.

The steelworks was never built,&lt;ref name=partridge50/&gt; but a conflict between different 'Ndrangheta groups over the spoils of public construction contracts to built a railroad stump, the steelwork center, and the port in [[Gioia Tauro]], led to the [[First 'Ndrangheta war]].&lt;ref name=paoli115&gt;Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sauer Commission''' (South Africa), was created in 1947 largely in response to the [[Fagan Commission]]. It was appointed by the [[Herenigde Nasionale Party]] and favoured even stricter segregation laws.

The Sauer Commission was concerned with the 'problem' of controlling the influx of African people into urban areas. White workers, traders and merchants were concerned that this would represent a threat to their jobs and businesses, particularly since African workers would work in semi-skilled positions for a lower wage than white workers. Businesses demanded racially segregated trading zones in order to protect their businesses from competition.
Numerous groups influenced this policy of 'total Apartheid', including the [[South African Bureau of Race Affairs]] (SABRA).

Ultimately the Sauer commission did not enforce the total segregation to the extent originally envisioned. Rather, it resulted in the immediate implementation of 'practical Apartheid', which allowed some African people to enter and work in urban areas, with the complete implementation of total Apartheid envisioned as a future goal. The recommendations made by the Sauer commission were still more restrictive than those made by the Fagan Commission.

The members of the Sauer commission were: P.O. Sauer, G.B.A. Gerdener, [[Ernest George Jansen|E.G. Jansen]], J.J. Serfontein and M.D.C. De Wet Nel.

'''''The Dark Side of Chocolate''''' is a 2010 [[documentary film]] about the [[Children in cocoa production|exploitation and slavetrading of African children to harvest chocolate]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cm-life.com/2010/10/18/chocolate-industry-built-on-blood-and-sweat-of-child-slaves/ COLUMN: Chocolate industry built on blood and sweat of child slaves], Lonnie Allen, ''[[Central Michigan Life]]'', 18 October 2010 (retrieved 29 October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; still occurring nearly ten years after the [[cocoa industry]] pledged to end it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalexchange.org/blogs/fairtrade/2010/08/04/film-shows-cocoa-child-slavery-continues/ Film Shows Cocoa Child Slavery Continues], Adrienne Fitch-Frankel, Fair Trade Blog, [[Global Exchange]], 4 August 2010 (retrieved 29 October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Cocoa plantations in Ghana and the Ivory Coast provide 80% of the world with chocolate, according to [[CorpWatch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=12754 AFRICA: The Dark Side of Chocolate], Kate McMahon, ''[[CorpWatch]]'', 25 October 2005 (retrieved 29 October 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Chocolate producers around the world have been pressured to “verify that their chocolate is not the product of [[child labor]] or [[slavery]].”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/dark-side-of-chocolate/content?oid=1468540 The dark side of chocolate: Are candy companies doing enough to end child labor?], Sara Peck, "News Review", 05 August 2010 (retrieved 29 October 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[BBC]] aired ''Slavery: A Global Investigation'' which brought the issue of child labor in the cocoa industry to light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childlabor-payson.org/meetings/Ghana_Consultative_Meeting_2010/Documents/Background%20Information%20for%20ghana%20web.pdf Ghana Consultative Meeting 2010], Tulane University, 11 June 2010 (retrieved 6 November 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association and its members signed a document that prohibited child trafficking and labor in the cocoa industry after 2008. Despite this effort, numerous children are still forced to work on cocoa plantations in Africa.

In 2009, [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]] and [[Cadbury]] joined the [[Rainforest Alliance]] to fight against child labor. By 2020, these major chocolate manufacturers hope to completely eradicate child labor on any plantations from which they purchase their cocoa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/dark-side-of-chocolate/content?oid=1468540 The dark side of chocolate: Are candy companies doing enough to end child labor?], Sara Peck, "News Review", 05 August 2010 (retrieved 29 October 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
''The Dark Side of Chocolate'' was directed by Danish journalist [[Miki Mistrati]] who investigated the use of child labor and trafficked children in chocolate production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northernlife.ca/news/lifestyle/2010/10/chocolate-191010.aspx Feature film exposes the dark side of treat], Jenny Jelen, ''[[Northern Life (newspaper)|Northern Life]]'', 19 October 2010 (retrieved 20 October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; It was filmed by [[U. Roberto Romano]] and produced by Helle Faber.

The filming started in Germany, where Mistrati asked vendors where their chocolate comes from. They then flew to [[Mali]], where many of the children are from. Next, they explored the [[Ivory Coast]] where the cocoa plantations are located. The film ends in Switzerland where both the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) and the [[Nestle]] headquarters are located.

Much of the footage in this documentary is recorded using a secret camera.

The documentary was released in 2010, first in Denmark, and later in Sweden, Ireland, Belgium, and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thedarksideofchocolate.org/ The Dark Side of Chocolate Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
In 2001, the [[Chocolate Manufacturers Association]] formed an action plan entitled the [[Harkin-Engel Protocol]], an agreement that was signed by the major chocolate companies almost 10 years before the film was made, aimed at ending child trafficking and slave labor in the cocoa industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.american.edu/ted/chocolate-slave.htm Chocolate and Slavery] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210170034/http://www1.american.edu/ted/chocolate-slave.htm |date=2012-02-10 }}, Samlanchith Chanthavong, "Chocolate and Slavery", 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary starts in Cologne, [[Germany]] where Mistrati asks several chocolate company representatives whether they are aware of child labour in cocoa farms. In Mali, the film shows that children, having been promised paid work, are taken to towns near the border such as [[Zegoua]], from where another trafficker transports the children over the border on a dirt-bike. Then they are left with a third trafficker who sells the children to farmers for around 250 Euros each.

The children, ranging in age from 10 to 15, are forced to do hard and often hazardous labor, are often beaten, and according to the film's narrator most are never paid. The narrator also claims that most of them stay with the plantation until they die, never seeing their families again. No documentary evidence is shown to support the claims that the children are not paid or that they are made to work until they die. The Harkin-Engel Protocol promised to end the use of child labour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/dark-side-of-chocolate/content?oid=1468540 The dark side of chocolate: Are candy companies doing enough to end child labor?], Sara Peck, "News Review", 05 August 2010 (retrieved 29 October 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

When confronted with this issue, corporate representatives denied all rumors of child labor and trafficking, but the investigations of the filmmakers brought to light the continued widespread use of trafficked child slaves on cocoa plantations.

[[Nestle]] and other companies declined an invitation to watch the film and to answer questions. In response, Mistrati set up a large screen next to Nestle’s headquarters in Switzerland, forcing employees to catch a glimpse of child labor in the cocoa industry.

As a closing edit window to the film, during the credits roll, we see the local police arrive, to ask why they are showing the film outside Nestle's Head Office in Vevey, Switzerland.  The police ask if the film is 'for or against Nestle'.  The reply is "It is not against".  After checking their documents the policeman says "we turn it off", referring to showing the film. {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Reception==
In 2012, ''The Dark Side of Chocolate'' was nominated for the [[Adolf Grimme Award]] in the category of Information &amp; Culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[:da:Miki Mistrati|Miki Mistrati - da.wikipedia.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linkedin.com/pub/miki-mistrati/2b/954/947 Miki Mistrati - LinkedIn]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Special Operations Command''' ('''USSOCOM''' or '''SOCOM''') is the [[Unified Combatant Command]] charged with overseeing the various [[Special forces|Special Operations]] Component Commands of the [[USASOC|Army]], [[MARSOC|Marine Corps]], [[NAVSPECWARCOM|Navy]], and [[AFSOC|Air Force]] of the [[United States Armed Forces]]. The command is part of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and is the only Unified Combatant Command legislated into being by the U.S. Congress. USSOCOM is headquartered at [[MacDill Air Force Base]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], Florida.

The idea of an American unified special operations command had its origins in the aftermath of [[Operation Eagle Claw]], the disastrous attempted rescue of [[Iran hostage crisis|hostages]] at the [[Den of Espionage|American embassy]] in Iran in 1980. The ensuing investigation, chaired by [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[James L. Holloway III]], the retired [[Chief of Naval Operations]], cited lack of [[Command and control (military)|command and control]] and inter-service coordination as significant factors in the failure of the mission.{{r|Adm Holloway bio}} Since its activation on 16 April 1987, U.S. Special Operations Command has participated in many [[Military operation|operations]], from the 1989 [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion]] of [[Panama]] to the ongoing [[War on Terror|Global War on Terrorism]].{{r|NYT Bang Panama}}{{r|NYT Regime thought}}

USSOCOM conducts several covert and clandestine missions, such as [[Direct action (military)|direct action]], [[special reconnaissance]], [[counter-terrorism]], [[foreign internal defense]], [[unconventional warfare]], [[psychological warfare]], [[civil affairs]], and [[counter-narcotics]] operations. Each branch has a Special Operations Command that is unique and capable of running its own operations, but when the different special operations forces need to work together for an operation, USSOCOM becomes the joint component command of the operation, instead of a SOC of a specific branch.{{r|posture statement}}

==History==
The unworkable command and control structure of separate U.S. military special operations forces (SOF), which led to the failure of [[Operation Eagle Claw]] in 1980, highlighted the need within the Department of Defense for reform and reorganization. Since the incident, the Army Chief of Staff, General [[Edward C. Meyer|Edward C. "Shy" Meyer]], called for a further restructuring of special operations capabilities, eventually helping to create the U.S. [[Delta Force]].{{r|Delta elite force}} Although unsuccessful at the joint level, Meyer nevertheless went on to consolidate [[USASOC|Army SOF]] units under the new 1st Special Operations Command in 1982, a significant step to improve the U.S. Army's SOF.

[[File:Barry Goldwater.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Senator Barry Goldwater]], Former Chairman of the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]]]]
By 1983, there was a small but growing sense in the Congress for the need for military reforms. In June, the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] (SASC) began a two-year-long study of the Defense Department,  which included an examination of SOF spearheaded by Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] (R-AZ). With concern mounting on [[Capitol Hill]], the Department of Defense created the Joint Special Operations Agency on 1 January 1984; this agency, however, had neither operational nor command authority over any SOF.{{r|BIT}}{{r|hr5109}} The Joint Special Operations Agency thus did little to improve SOF readiness, capabilities, or policies, and therefore was insufficient. Within the Defense Department, there were a few staunch SOF supporters. Noel Koch, Principal Deputy Assistant [[Secretary of Defense]] for International Security Affairs, and his deputy, Lynn Rylander, both advocated SOF reforms.{{r|socomch}}

At the same time, a few on Capitol Hill were determined to overhaul [[United States Special Operations Forces]]. They included Senators [[Sam Nunn]] (D-GA) and [[William Cohen]] (R-ME), both members of the Armed Services Committee, and Representative Dan Daniel (D-VA), the chairman of the [[United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness]]. Congressman Daniel had become convinced that the U.S. military establishment was not interested in special operations, that the country's capability in this area was second rate, and that SOF operational command and control was an endemic problem.{{r|socomch}} Senators Nunn and Cohen also felt strongly that the Department of Defense was not preparing adequately for future threats. Senator Cohen agreed that the U.S. needed a clearer organizational focus and chain of command for special operations to deal with low-intensity conflicts.{{r|BIT}}

In October 1985, the Senate Armed Services Committee published the results of its two-year review of the U.S. military structure, entitled "Defense Organization: The Need For Change."{{r|S.CON.RES.80}} Mr. James R. Locher III, the principal author of this study, also examined past special operations and speculated on the most likely future threats. This influential document led to the [[Goldwater-Nichols Act|Goldwater-Nichols Defense Reorganization Act of 1986]].{{r|H.R.3622}}{{r|reorg JCS}} By spring 1986, SOF advocates had introduced reform bills in both houses of Congress. On 15 May, Senator Cohen introduced the Senate bill, co-sponsored by Senator Nunn and others, which called for a joint military organization for SOF and the establishment of an office in the Defense Department to ensure adequate funding and policy emphasis for low-intensity conflict and special operations.{{r|S.2453}} Representative Daniel's proposal went even further—he wanted a national special operations agency headed by a civilian who would bypass the Joint Chiefs and report directly to the Secretary of Defense; this would keep Joint Chiefs and the Services out of the SOF budget process.{{r|hr5109}}

Congress held hearings on the two bills in the summer of 1986. Admiral [[William J. Crowe Jr.]], [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], led the Pentagon's opposition to the bills. He proposed, as an alternative, a new Special Operations Forces command led by a three-star general. This proposal was not well received on Capitol Hill—Congress wanted a four-star general in charge to give SOF more clout. A number of retired military officers and others testified in favor of the need for reform.{{r|socomch}} By most accounts, retired Army Major General [[Richard Scholtes]] gave the most compelling reasons for change. Scholtes, who commanded the joint special operations task force in [[Operation Urgent Fury|Grenada]], explained how conventional force leaders misused SOF during the operation, not allowing them to use their unique capabilities, which resulted in high SOF casualties. After his formal testimony, Scholtes met privately with a small number of Senators to elaborate on the problems that he had encountered in Grenada.{{r|NYT Taubman}}

Both the House and Senate passed SOF reform bills, and these went to a conference committee for reconciliation. Senate and House conferees forged a compromise. The bill called for a unified combatant command headed by a four-star general for all SOF, an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict, a coordinating board for low-intensity conflict within the National Security Council, and a new Major Force Program (MFP-11) for SOF (the so-called "SOF checkbook").{{r|SOLIC}}{{r|SOF transition Giles}} The final bill, attached as a rider to the 1987 Defense Authorization Act, amended the Goldwater-Nichols Act and was signed into law in October 1986. Congress clearly intended to force DOD and the Administration to face up to the realities of past failures and emerging threats. DOD and the Administration were responsible for implementing the law, and Congress subsequently had to pass two additional bills to ensure proper implementation.{{r|socomch}} The legislation promised to improve SOF in several respects. Once implemented, MFP-11 provided SOF with control over its own resources, better enabling it to modernize the force. Additionally, the law fostered interservice cooperation: a single commander for all SOF promoted interoperability among the forces assigned to the same command. The establishment of a four-star Commander in Chief and an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict eventually gave SOF a voice in the highest councils of the Defense Department.{{r|SOLIC}}
[[File:GEN James Lindsay 1986.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[General James Lindsay]] the first Commander in Chief, Special Operations Command]]
Implementing the provisions and mandates of the Nunn-Cohen Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987, however, was neither rapid nor smooth. One of the first issues to surface was appointing an ASD (SO/LIC), whose principal duties included monitorship of special operations activities and low-intensity conflict activities of the Department of Defense. The Congress even increased the number of assistant secretaries of defense from 11 to 12, but the Department of Defense still did not fill this new billet. In December 1987, the Congress directed [[Secretary of the Army]] [[John O. Marsh]] to carry out the ASD (SO/LIC) duties until a suitable replacement was approved by the Senate. Not until 18 months after the legislation passed did Ambassador [[Charles Whitehouse]] assume the duties of ASD (SO/LIC).{{r|NYT Lewis}}

Meanwhile, the establishment of USSOCOM provided its own measure of excitement. A quick solution to manning and basing a brand new unified command was to abolish an existing command. [[United States Readiness Command]] (USREDCOM), with an often misunderstood mission, did not appear to have a viable mission in the post Goldwater-Nichols era, and its Commander in Chief, General [[James J. Lindsay|James Lindsay]], had had some special operations experience. On 23 January 1987, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to the [[Secretary of Defense]] that USREDCOM be disestablished to provide billets and facilities for USSOCOM. President [[Ronald Reagan]] approved the establishment of the new command on 13 April 1987. The Department of Defense activated USSOCOM on 16 April 1987 and nominated General Lindsay to be the first Commander in Chief Special Operations Command (USCINCSOC). The Senate accepted him without debate.{{r|socomch}}

===Operation Earnest Will===
[[File:MH-60 Blackhawk landing on Hercules.JPG|thumb|MH-60 landing on Hercules]]
USSOCOM's first tactical operation involved [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (United States)|160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)]] ("Night Stalkers") aviators,  SEALs, and [[Special Boat Teams]] (SBT) working together during Operation Earnest Will in September 1987. During [[Operation Earnest Will]], the United States ensured that neutral oil tankers and other merchant ships could safely transit the [[Persian Gulf]] during the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. Iranian attacks on tankers prompted [[Kuwait]] to ask the United States in December 1986 to register 11 Kuwaiti tankers as American ships so that they could be escorted by the U.S. Navy. President Reagan agreed to the Kuwaiti request on 10 March 1987, hoping it would deter Iranian attacks.{{r|socomch}} The protection offered by U.S. naval vessels, however, did not stop [[Iran]], which used mines and small boats to harass the convoys steaming to and from Kuwait. In late July 1987, Rear Admiral Harold J. Bernsen, commander of the Middle East Force, requested NSW assets. Special Boat Teams deployed with six Mark III Patrol Boats and two SEAL platoons in August.{{r|socomch}} The Middle East Force decided to convert two oil servicing barges, Hercules and Wimbrown VII, into mobile sea bases. The mobile sea bases allowed SOF in the northern [[Persian Gulf]] to thwart clandestine [[Iran]]ian mining and small boat attacks.

On 21 September, Nightstalkers flying MH-60 and [[MH-6|Little Birds]] took off from the frigate [[USS Jarrett (FFG-33)|USS ''Jarrett'']] to track an Iranian ship, ''[[Iran Ajr]]''. The Nightstalkers observed ''Iran Ajr'' turn off her lights and begin laying mines. After receiving permission to attack, the helicopters fired guns and rockets, stopping the ship. As ''Iran Ajr'''s crew began to push mines over the side, the helicopters resumed firing until the crew abandoned ship. Special Boat Teams provided security while a SEAL team boarded the vessel at first light and discovered nine mines on the vessel's deck, as well as a logbook revealing areas where previous mines had been laid. The logbook implicated Iran in mining international waters.{{r|socomch}}
[[File:Operation Nimble Archer DN-SC-88-01042.jpg|thumb|left|175px|One of two [[Iran]]ian oil platforms set ablaze after shelling by American [[destroyers]].]]
Within a few days, the Special Operations forces had determined the [[Iran]]ian pattern of activity; the Iranians hid during the day near oil and gas platforms in Iranian waters and at night they headed toward the Middle Shoals Buoy, a navigation aid for tankers. With this knowledge, SOF launched three Little Bird helicopters and two patrol craft to the buoy. The Little Bird helicopters arrived first and were fired upon by three Iranian boats anchored near the buoy. After a short but intense firefight, the helicopters sank all three boats. Three days later, in mid-October, an Iranian Silkworm missile hit the tanker ''[[MV Sea Isle City|Sea Isle City]]'' near the oil terminal outside [[Kuwait City]]. Seventeen crewmen and the American captain were injured in the missile attack.{{r|socomch}}{{r|OEWDP}} During [[Operation Nimble Archer]], four [[destroyers]] shelled two oil platforms in the Rostam oil field. After the shelling, a SEAL platoon and a demolition unit planted explosives on one of the platforms to destroy it. The SEALs next boarded and searched a third platform {{convert|2|mi|0}} away. Documents and radios were taken for intelligence purposes.

On 14 April 1988, {{convert|65|mi|sigfig=2}} east of [[Bahrain]], the frigate [[USS Samuel B. Roberts (FFG-58)|USS ''Samuel B. Roberts '']] hit a mine, blowing an immense hole in its hull.{{r|NHH}} Ten sailors were injured. During [[Operation Praying Mantis]] the U.S. retaliated fiercely, attacking the Iranian frigate ''Sahand'' and oil platforms in the Sirri and Sassan oil fields.{{r|OEWDP}} After U.S. warships bombarded the Sirri platform and set it ablaze, a UH-60 with a SEAL platoon flew toward the platform but was unable to get close enough because of the roaring fire. Secondary explosions soon wrecked the platform.{{r|socomch}} Thereafter, Iranian attacks on neutral ships dropped drastically.  On 18 July, Iran accepted the United Nations cease fire; on 20 August 1988, the Iran–Iraq War ended. The remaining SEALs, patrol boats, and helicopters then returned to the United States.{{r|socomch}} Special operations forces provided critical skills necessary to help CENTCOM gain control of the northern Persian Gulf and balk Iran's small boats and minelayers. The ability to work at night proved vital, because Iranian units used darkness to conceal their actions. Additionally, because of Earnest Will operational requirements, USSOCOM would acquire new weapons systems—the patrol coastal ships and the [[Mark V Special Operations Craft]].{{r|socomch}}

===Somalia===
Special Operations Command first became involved in [[Somalia]] in 1992 as part of [[Operation Provide Relief]]. C-130s circled over Somali airstrips during delivery of relief supplies. Special Forces medics accompanied many relief flights into the airstrips throughout southern Somalia to assess the area. They were the first U.S. soldiers in Somalia, arriving before U.S. forces who supported the expanded relief operations of Restore Hope.{{r|socomch}}{{r|NYT somalia step}}{{r|NYTttt}} The first teams into Somalia were CIA [[Special Activities Division]] paramilitary officers with elements of JSOC. They conducted very high risk advanced force operations prior to the entry of the follow on forces. The first casualty of the conflict came from this team and was a Paramilitary officer and former Delta Force operator name [[Larry Freedman]]. Freedman was awarded the [[Intelligence Star]] for ''"extraordinary heroism"'' for his actions.{{r|Gup 2000}}

The earliest missions during [[Operation Restore Hope]] were conducted by Navy SEALs. The SEALs performed several hydro-graphic reconnaissance missions to find suitable landing sites for [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]]. On 7 December, the SEALs swam into Mogadishu Harbor, where they found suitable landing sites, assessed the area for threats, and concluded that the port could support offloading ships. This was a tough mission because the SEALs swam against a strong current which left many of them overheated and exhausted. Furthermore, they swam through raw sewage in the harbor, which made them sick.{{r|socomch}} When the first SEALs hit the shore the following night, they were surprised to meet members of the news media. The first Marines came ashore soon thereafter, and the press redirected their attention to them. Later, the SEALs provided personal security for [[George H. W. Bush|President George Bush]] during a visit to Somalia.{{r|socomch}}{{r|NYTttt}} In December 1992, Special Forces assets in Kenya moved to Somalia and joined Operation Restore Hope. January 1993, a Special Forces command element deployed to Mogadishu as the Joint Special Operations Forces-Somalia (JSOFOR) that would command and control all special operations for Restore Hope. JSOFOR's mission was to make initial contact with indigenous factions and leaders; provide information for force protection; and provide reports on the area for future relief and security operations. Before redeploying in April, JSOFOR elements drove over {{convert|26000|mi|sigfig=2}}, captured 277 weapons, and destroyed over {{convert|45,320|lb|kg}} of explosives.{{r|socomch}}

[[File:75th Ranger Regiment Bravo Company 3rd Batallion Somalia 1993.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Bravo Company, 3rd Battalion of the [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|75th Ranger Regiment]] in Somalia, 1993.]]
In August 1993, Secretary of Defense [[Les Aspin]] directed the deployment of a Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF) to Somalia in response to attacks made by General [[Mohamed Farrah Aidid]]'s supporters upon U.S. and UN forces. The JSOTF, named Task Force (TF)
Ranger, was charged with a mission named [[Operation Gothic Serpent]] to capture Aidid. This was an especially arduous mission, for Aidid had gone underground, after several [[Lockheed AC-130]] air raids and UN assaults on his strongholds.{{r|socomch}}{{r|BHD}}{{r|BoG}}

While Marines from the 24th MEU provided an interim QRF (Force Recon Det and helicopters from HMM-263), the task force arrived in the country, and began training exercises. The Marines were asked to take on the Aidid snatch mission, but having the advantage of being in the area for more than two months, decided after mission analysis that the mission was a "no-go" due to several factors, centered around the inability to rescue the crew of a downed helicopter (re: the indigenous forces technique of using RPGs against helicopters and blocking the narrow streets in order to restrict the movement of a ground rescue force). This knowledge was not passed on to the Rangers, due to the Marines operating from the USS Wasp and the Rangers remaining on land. TF Ranger was made up of operators from [[Delta Force]], [[75th Ranger Regiment]], [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (United States)|160th SOAR]], SEALs from the [[Naval Special Warfare Development Group]], and Air Force special tactics units.{{r|socomch}}{{r|BHD}} During August and September 1993, the task force conducted six missions into [[Mogadishu]], all of which were successes. Although Aidid remained free, the effect of these missions seriously limited his movements.{{r|BoG}}

On 3 October, TF Ranger launched its seventh mission, this time into Aidid's stronghold the [[Bakara Market]] to capture two of his key lieutenants. The mission was expected to take only one or two hours.{{r|BHD}} Helicopters carried an assault and a ground convoy of security teams launched in the late afternoon from the TF Ranger compound at Mogadishu airport. The TF came under increasingly heavy fire, more intense than during previous missions. The assault team captured 24 Somalis including Aidid's lieutenants and were loading them onto the convoy trucks when a [[UH-60 Black Hawk|MH-60 Blackhawk]] was hit by a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] (RPG).{{r|socomch}}{{r|BoG}} A small element from the security force, as well as an [[MH-6]] assault helicopter and an MH-60 carrying a fifteen-man combat search and rescue (CSAR) team, rushed to the crash site.{{r|socomch}}{{r|BHD}}{{r|BoG}} The [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|battle]] became increasingly worse. An RPG struck another MH-60, crashing less than {{convert|1|mi|1}} to the south of the first downed helicopter. The task force faced overwhelming Somali mobs that overran the crash sites, causing a dire situation.{{r|BHD}} A Somali mob overran the second site and, despite a heroic defense, killed everyone except the pilot, whom they took prisoner. Two defenders of this crash site, [[Gary Gordon|Master Sergeant Gary Gordon]] and [[Randy Shughart|Sergeant First Class Randall Shughart]], were posthumously awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].{{r|socomch}}{{r|BHD}}{{r|BoG}} About this time, the mission's quick reaction force (QRF) also tried to reach the second crash site. This force too was pinned by Somali fire and required the fire support of two [[AH-6]] helicopters before it could break contact and make its way back to the base.{{r|socomch}}
[[File:Battle of mogadishu map of city.png|thumb|Map of the main battle sites during the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]].]]
The assault and security elements moved on foot towards the first crash area, passing through heavy fire, and occupied buildings south and southwest of the downed helicopter. They fought to establish defensive positions so as not to be pinned down by very heavy enemy fire, while treating their wounded, and worked to free the pilot's body from the downed helicopter. With the detainees loaded on trucks, the ground convoy force attempted to reach the first crash site. Unable to find it amongst the narrow, winding alleyways, the convoy came under devastating small arms and RPG fire. The convoy had to return to base after suffering numerous casualties, and sustaining substantial damage to their vehicles.

Reinforcements, consisting of elements from the QRF, [[10th Mountain Division]] soldiers, Rangers, SEALs, [[Pakistan Army]] tanks and [[Malaysian Army|Malaysian]] [[armored personnel carriers]], finally arrived at 1:55&amp;nbsp;am on 4 October. The combined force worked until dawn to free the pilot's body, receiving RPG and small arms fire throughout the night.{{r|socomch}} All the casualties were loaded onto the armored personnel carriers, and the remainder of the force was left behind and had no choice but to move out on foot.{{r|BHD}} AH-6 gunships raked the streets with fire to support the movement. The main force of the convoy arrived at the [[Pakistan Army|Pakistani]] Stadium-compound for the QRF-at 6:30&amp;nbsp;am,{{r|BHD}} thus concluding one of the bloodiest and fiercest urban firefights since the [[Vietnam War]]. Task Force Ranger experienced a total of 17 killed in action and 106 wounded. Various estimates placed Somali casualties above 1,000.{{r|BHD}} Although Task Force Ranger's few missions were successes, the overall outcome of Operation Gothic Serpent was deemed a failure because of the Task Force's failure to complete their stated mission, capturing [[Mohamed Farrah Aidid]].{{r|BHD}} Most U.S. forces pulled out of Somalia by March 1994. The withdrawal from Somalia, was completed on March 1995.{{r|socomch}} Even though Operation Gothic Serpent failed, USSOCOM still made significant contributions to operations in Somalia. SOF performed reconnaissance and surveillance missions, assisted with humanitarian relief, protected American forces and conducted riverine patrols. Additionally, they ensured the safe landing of the Marines and safeguarded the arrival of merchant ships carrying food.{{r|socomch}}{{r|OEWDP}}

===Iraq===
USSOCOM's [[10th Special Forces Group]], elements of [[JSOC]] and CIA/SAD Paramilitary Officers linked up again and were the first to enter Iraq prior to the invasion. Their efforts organized the Kurdish [[Peshmerga]] to defeat [[Ansar Al Islam]] in Northern Iraq before the invasion. This battle was for control of a territory in Northeastern Iraq that was completely occupied by Ansar Al Islam, an ally of Al Qaeda. This was a very significant battle and led to the death of a substantial number of terrorists and the uncovering of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat. These terrorists would have been in the subsequent insurgency had they not been eliminated during this battle. Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war. This battle may have been the Tora Bora of Iraq, but it was a sound defeat for Al Qaeda and their ally Ansar Al Islam.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} This combined team then led the Peshmerga against Saddam's northern Army. This effort kept Saddam's forces in the north and denied the ability to redeploy to contest the invasion force coming from the south. This effort may have saved the lives of hundreds if not thousands of coalition service men and women.{{r|PoA}}

At the launch of the [[Iraq War]] dozens of 12-member [[Special Forces]] teams infiltrated southern and western Iraq to hunt for [[Scud]] missiles and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of [[Navy SEALs]] seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast.{{r|NYT Dao}} [[Air Force combat controllers]] flew combat missions in [[Lockheed MC-130|MC-130H Combat Talon IIs]] and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It was a far cry from the [[Persian Gulf war]] of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines. But it would not be a replay of Afghanistan, where [[Army Special Forces]] and Navy SEALs led the fighting. After their star turn in Afghanistan, many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in Iraq. Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders.{{r|NYTaSOF}} From that point, USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and [[Al-Qaeda]] terrorists. It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training the [[Iraqi security forces]].{{r|Kruzel}}{{r|NYT Gordon}}

==Current role==
United States Special Operations Command played a pivotal role in fighting the former [[Taliban]] government in [[Afghanistan]] in 2001{{r|Kozaryn}} and toppling it thereafter, as well as combating the insurgency and capturing [[Saddam Hussein]] in Iraq. USSOCOM in 2004 was developing plans to have an expanded and more complex role in the global campaign against terrorism,{{r|reach of war}} and that role continued to emerge before and after the [[killing of Osama bin Laden]] in Pakistan in 2011.{{r|WP01}}{{r|CP01}} In 2010, "of about 13,000 Special Operations forces deployed overseas, about 9,000 [were] evenly divided between Iraq and Afghanistan."{{r|WP01}}

===War in Afghanistan===
[[File:Special Forces Medic in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|A [[7th Special Forces Group (United States)|7th SFG]] Special Forces medic in [[Kandahar Province]], [[Afghanistan]], in September 2008.]]
In the initial stages of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]], USSOCOM forces linked up with CIA Paramilitary Officers from [[Special Activities Division]] to defeat the Taliban without the need for large-scale conventional forces.{{r|Lehman}} This was one of the biggest successes of the global [[War on Terrorism]].{{r|Time Waller}}
These units linked up several times during this war and engaged in several furious battles with the enemy. One such battle happened during [[Operation Anaconda]], the mission to squeeze life out of a Taliban and Al-Qaeda stronghold dug deep into the [[Shah-i-Kot]] mountains of eastern Afghanistan. The operation was seen as one of the heaviest and bloodiest fights in the War in Afghanistan.{{r|Time Anaconda}} The battle on an Afghan mountaintop called [[Takur Ghar]] featured special operations forces from all 4 services and the CIA. Navy SEALs, Army Rangers, Air Force Combat Controllers, and Pararescuemen fought against entrenched Al-Qaeda fighters atop a {{convert|10000|ft|m|adj=on}} mountain. Subsequently, the entrenched Taliban became targets of every asset in the sky. According to an executive summary, the [[battle of Takur Ghar]] was the most intense firefight American special operators have been involved in since 18 U.S. Army Rangers were killed in [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Mogadishu]], Somalia, in 1993.{{r|Takur Ghar}}{{r|Takur Ghar summary}}{{r|Roberts Ridge}} During [[Operation Red Wings]] on 28 June 2005, four Navy SEALs, pinned down in a firefight, radioed for help. A Chinook helicopter, carrying 16 service members, responded but was shot down. All members of the rescue team and three of four SEALs on the ground died. It was the worst loss of life in Afghanistan since the invasion in 2001. The Navy SEAL [[Marcus Luttrell]] alone survived.{{r|Lone Survivor}}{{r|Sole Survivor}} Team leader [[Michael P. Murphy]] was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions in the battle.

===Global presence===
[[File:Members of the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command, assigned to the 23rd Special Tactics Squadron.jpg|thumb|U.S. Air Force Special Tactics Commandos training in Jordan]]

SOC chief Olson said in 2011 that SOCOM "is a microcosm of the Department of Defense, with ground, air, and maritime components, a global presence, and authorities and responsibilities that mirror the Military Departments, Military Services, and Defense Agencies."{{r|CP01}} In 2010, special operations forces were deployed in 75 countries, compared with about 60 at the beginning of 2009.{{r|WP01}} In 2011, SOC spokesman Colonel Tim Nye (Army{{r|ArmyTimes Naylor}}) was reported to have said that the number of countries with SOC presence will likely reach 120 and that joint training exercises will have been carried out in most or all of those countries during the year. One study identified joint-training exercises in Belize, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Germany, Indonesia, Mali, Norway, Panama, and Poland in 2010 and also, through mid-year 2011, in the Dominican Republic, Jordan, Romania, Senegal, South Korea, and Thailand, among other nations. In addition, SOC forces executed the high-profile [[killing of Osama bin Laden]] in Pakistan in 2011.{{r|CP01}}

In November 2009 ''[[The Nation]]'' reported on a covert JSOC/[[Blackwater USA|Blackwater]] anti-terrorist operation in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Scahill, [http://www.thenation.com/article/secret-us-war-pakistan "The Secret U.S. War in Pakistan"], ''The Nation'', 23 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[White House]] [[counterterrorism]] director [[John O. Brennan]] said that the United States "will not merely respond after the fact" of a terrorist attack but will "take the fight to al-Qaeda and its extremist affiliates whether they plot and train in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia and beyond." Olson said, "In some places, in deference to host-country sensitivities, we are lower in profile. In every place, Special Operations forces activities are coordinated with the U.S. ambassador and are under the operational control of the four-star regional commander."{{r|WP01}}

The conduct of actions by SOC forces outside of Iraq and Afghan war zones has been the subject of internal U.S. debate, including between representatives of the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration such as [[John B. Bellinger III]], on one hand, and the [[Barack Obama|Obama]] administration on another. The United Nations in 2010 also "questioned the administration's authority under international law to conduct such raids, particularly when they kill innocent civilians. One possible legal justification – the permission of the country in question – is complicated in places such as Pakistan and Yemen, where the governments privately agree but do not publicly acknowledge approving the attacks," as one report put it.{{r|WP01}}

==Subordinate Commands==
===Joint Special Operations Command===
[[File:JSOC.png|thumb|right|The Joint Special Operations Command insignia]]
{{r|NYT Risen}}
[[Joint Special Operations Command]] (JSOC) is a component command of the USSOCOM and is charged to study special operations requirements and techniques to ensure interoperability and equipment standardization, plan and conduct special operations exercises and training, and develop Joint Special Operations Tactics.{{r|2013 SOCOM Fact book}} It was established in 1980 on recommendation of [[Charles Alvin Beckwith|Col. Charlie Beckwith]], in the aftermath of the failure of [[Operation Eagle Claw]].&lt;ref&gt;Emerson 1988, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Units'''
* The U.S. Army's [[1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta]], popularly known as Delta Force, is the first of the two counter-terrorism, [[Special Mission Unit|special mission units]] that fall under the Joint Special Operations Command.{{r|NYTsw}} Modeled after the British [[Special Air Service]], Delta Force is regarded as one of the premier special operations forces in the world.{{r|IDF}}  Delta also includes a stringent training and selection process. Delta recruits primarily from the most proficient and highly skilled soldiers of the [[United States Army Special Operations Command|U.S. Army Special Operations Command]], although it encompasses the capability of recruiting throughout the U.S. Armed Forces.{{r|BHD}}{{r|IDF}} Recruits must pass a rigid selection course before beginning training, known as the Operators' Training Course (OTC). Delta has received training from numerous U.S. government agencies and other tier one SOF and has created a curriculum based on this training and techniques that it has developed.{{r|IDF}} Delta conducts clandestine and covert special operations all over the world.{{r|IDF}} It has the capability to conduct myriad special operations missions but specializes in counter-terrorism and hostage rescue operations.{{r|BHD}}{{r|NYTsw}}{{r|NYTsomblu}}
* The [[Intelligence Support Activity]] (ISA, The Activity) is the support branch of JSOC and USSOCOM. Its primary missions are to provide Human Intelligence ([[HUMINT]]) and Signal Intelligence ([[SIGINT]]) mainly for Delta and DEVGRU's operations.{{r|NYTsw}}{{r|Smith 2007}} Before the establishing of the [[Strategic Support Branch]] in 2001, the ISA required the permission of the [[CIA]] to conduct covert operations, which considerably lessened its effectiveness in its support of JSOC operations as a whole.{{r|NYTsw}}{{r|WP Gellman}}{{r|NYTSU}}
* The U.S. Army's [[75th Ranger Regiment]]: [[Regimental Reconnaissance Company]] (formerly known as Regimental Reconnaissance Detachment/RRD) is a unit that is rumored to be the newest operational member of the Joint Special Operations Command. The unit is believed to have been formally invited to join JSOC in 2007 due to its extensive training and unique capabilities to conduct special reconnaissance and close target reconnaissance (CTR) operations.
* The U.S. Navy's [[Naval Special Warfare Development Group]] (DEVGRU, SEAL Team Six) is the second of the two counter-terrorism, special mission units that fall under the Joint Special Operations Command.{{r|NYTsw}} DEVGRU is the U.S. Navy's counterpart to Delta, specializing in maritime counter-terrorism. DEVGRU recruits the most proficient operators from [[United States Naval Special Warfare Command|Naval Special Warfare]], specifically the [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEALs]]. Like Delta, DEVGRU can conduct a variety of special operations missions, but trains primarily for maritime counter-terrorism and hostage rescue operations. DEVGRU has gained prolific notoriety in recent years, due to high-profile hostage rescue operations and their role in [[Operation Neptune Spear|the killing of Osama Bin Laden]]. {{r|BHD}}{{r|NYTsw}}
* The Air Force [[24th Special Tactics Squadron]] (24th STS) is the [[Air Force Special Operations Command|AFSOC]] component of JSOC. The 24th STS consists of specially selected AFSOC personnel, including [[United States Air Force Pararescue|Pararescuemen]], [[United States Air Force Combat Control Team|Combat Controllers]], and [[United States Air Force Tactical Air Control Party|TACPs]]. These special operators usually serve with Delta Force and DEVGRU, because of the convenience of the 24th STS's ability to synchronize and control the different elements of air power and enhance air operations deep in enemy territory; As well as providing needed medical assistance in the case of Pararescuemen. {{r|BHD}}
* The [[Joint Communications Unit]] (JCU) is a technical unit of the United States Special Operations Command charged to standardize and ensure interoperability of communication procedures and equipment of the Joint Special Operations Command and its subordinate units. The JCU was activated at Ft. Bragg, NC in 1980, after the failure of Operation Eagle Claw. The JCU has earned the reputation of "DoD's Finest Communicators". [http://www.jcu.mil]

Portions of JSOC units have made up the constantly changing special operations task force, operating in the [[U.S. Central Command]] area of operations. The [[Task Force 11]], [[Task Force 121]], [[Task Force 6-26]] and [[Task Force 145]] are creations of the Pentagon's post-11 September campaign against terrorism, and it quickly became the model for how the military would gain intelligence and battle insurgents in the future. Originally known as Task Force 121, it was formed in the summer of 2003, when the military merged two existing Special Operations units, one hunting [[Osama bin Laden]] in and around Afghanistan, and the other tracking [[Sadaam Hussein]] in Iraq.{{r|NYT Schmitt 2006}}{{r|NYT Sanger}}

===Special Operations Command – Joint Capabilities===
Special Operations Command – Joint Capabilities (SOC-JC) was transferred to USSOCOM from the soon to be disestablished [[United States Joint Forces Command]] in 2011. {{r|jfcom transition}} Its primary mission was to train conventional and SOF commanders and their staffs, supports USSOCOM international engagement training requirements, and supports implementation of capability solutions in order to improve strategic and operational Warfighting readiness and joint interoperability. SOC-JC must also be prepared to support deployed Special Operations Joint Task Force (SOJTF) Headquarters (HQ).

The [[Government Accountability Office]] wrote that SOC-JC was disestablished in 2013, and positions were to be zeroed out in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = DEFENSE HEADQUARTERS: DOD Needs to Reevaluate Its Approach for Managing Resources Devoted to the Functional Combatant Commands|last = |first = |publisher = Government Accountability Office|date = June 2014|isbn = |location = Washington DC|pages = 45|url = http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/664443.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 1989 the [[United States Army Special Operations Command]] (USASOC) activated as the 16th major Army command. These special operations forces have been America's spearhead for unconventional warfare for more than 40 years. USASOC commands such units as the well known Special Forces (SF, or the "[[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Berets]]"), the [[United States Army Rangers|Rangers]], and such relatively unknown units as Psychological Operations Groups (PSYOP) and a Civil Affairs Brigade (CA). These are one of the USSOCOM's main weapons for waging unconventional warfare and counter-insurgency. The significance of these units is emphasized as conventional conflicts are becoming less prevalent as insurgent and guerrilla warfare increases.{{r|USASOC overview}}{{r|NYT Schmitt}}

'''Units:'''
* [[United States Army Special Forces]] (SF) aka Green Berets perform several doctrinal missions: unconventional warfare, foreign internal defense, special reconnaissance, direct action and counter-terrorism. These missions make Special Forces unique in the U.S. military, because they are employed throughout the three stages of the operational continuum: peacetime, conflict and war.{{r|CSSF}} Foreign internal defense operations, SF's main peacetime mission, are designed to help friendly developing nations by working with their military and police forces to improve their technical skills, understanding of human rights issues, and to help with humanitarian and civic action projects. Special Forces unconventional warfare capabilities provide a viable military option for a variety of operational taskings that are inappropriate or infeasible for conventional forces. Special Forces are the U.S. military's premier unconventional warfare force.{{r|2002 Shanker}} Foreign internal defense and unconventional warfare missions are the bread and butter of Special Forces soldiers. For this reason SF candidates are trained extensively in weapons, engineering, communications and medicine. SF soldiers are taught to be warriors first and teachers second because they must be able to train their team and be able to train their allies during a FID or UW mission.{{r|CSSF}}{{r|WRPNYT}} Often SF units are required to perform additional, or collateral, activities outside their primary missions. These collateral activities are coalition warfare/support, combat search and rescue, security assistance, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, humanitarian de-mining and counter-drug operations.{{r|USASF mission}}
* The [[Delta Force|1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta]] (1st SFOD-D), commonly referred to as Delta Force, Combat Applications Group/"CAG", "The Unit", Army Compartmented Element, or within JSOC as Task Force Green,&lt;ref name="RelentStrike"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naylor|first1=Sean|title=Relentless Strike|location=Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an elite [[Special Mission Unit]] of the [[United States Army]], under the organization of the USASOC but is controlled by the [[Joint Special Operations Command]] (JSOC).  It is used for hostage rescue and counterterrorism, as well as [[direct action (military)|direct action]] and [[reconnaissance]] against [[high-value target]]s.  1st SFOD-D and its [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] counterpart, [[United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group|DEVGRU, "SEAL Team 6"]], perform many of the most highly complex and dangerous missions in the U.S. military.  These units are also often referred to as "Tier One" and [[Special Mission Unit|special mission units]] by the U.S. government.
* The [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|75th Ranger Regiment]] (U.S. Army Rangers) is the premier light-infantry unit of the [[United States Army]] and is headquartered at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The 75th Ranger Regiment's mission is to plan and conduct special missions in support of U.S. policy and objectives.{{r|75th ranger website}} The Rangers are a flexible and rapid-deployable force. Each battalion can deploy anywhere in the world within 18 hours notice. The Army places much importance on the 75th Ranger Regiment and its training; it possesses the capabilities to conduct conventional and most special operations missions. Rangers are capable of infiltrating by land, sea, or air and [[Direct action (military)|direct action]] operations such as conducting raids or assaulting buildings or airfields.{{r|75th ranger website2}}
[[File:3rd Special Forces Group.JPG|thumb|right|[[United States Army Special Forces|Special Forces]] on a patrol in [[Afghanistan]].]]
* The [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (United States)|160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment]] (Night Stalkers) headquartered at [[Fort Campbell]], [[Kentucky]] provides aviation support to units within USSOCOM. The Regiment consists of [[MH-6]] and [[AH-6]] light helicopters, [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|MH-60]] helicopters and [[MH-47]] heavy assault helicopters. The capabilities of the 160th SOAR (A) have been evolving since the early 1980s. Its focus on night operations resulted in the nickname, the "Night Stalkers."{{r|160th fact sheet}} The primary mission of the Night Stalkers is to conduct overt or covert infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply of special operations forces across a wide range of environmental conditions.{{r|160th MH-60 fact sheet}}
* [[4th Psychological Operations Group]] (Airborne) and [[8th Psychological Operations Group]] (Airborne) Soldiers use persuasion to influence perceptions and encourage desired behavior.{{r|PSYOP recruiting}}{{r|PSYOP tsunami}} PSYOP soldiers supports national objectives at the tactical, operational and strategic levels of operations. Strategic psychological operations advance broad or long-term objectives; global in nature, they may be directed toward large audiences or at key communicators. Operational psychological operations are conducted on a smaller scale. 4th POG(A) is employed by theater commanders to target groups within the theater of operations. 4th POG(A) purpose can range from gaining support for U.S. operations to preparing the battlefield for combat. Tactical psychological operations are more limited, used by commanders to secure immediate and near-term goals. In this environment, these force-enhancing activities serve as a means to lower the morale and efficiency of enemy forces.{{r|PSYOP fact sheet}}
* [[95th Civil Affairs Brigade (United States)|95th Civil Affairs Brigade]] (Airborne) specialists identify critical requirements needed by local citizens in war or disaster situations. They also locate civilian resources to support military operations, help minimize civilian interference with operations, support national assistance activities, plan and execute noncombatant evacuation, support counter-drug operations and establish and maintain liaison with civilian aid agencies and other nongovernmental organizations. In support of special operations, these culturally oriented, linguistically capable Soldiers may also be tasked to provide functional expertise for foreign internal defense operations, unconventional warfare operations and direct action missions.{{r|95th fact sheet}}
* [[528th Sustainment Brigade (United States)|528th Sustainment Brigade --Special Operations-- (Airborne)]] (SBSO(A)) has a difficult mission supporting USASOC. In their respective fields, signal and support soldiers provide supplies, maintenance, equipment and expertise allowing Special Operation Forces to "shoot, move and communicate" on a continuous basis. Because USASOC often uses Special Operations Forces-unique items, soldiers assigned to these units are taught to operate and maintain a vast array of specialized equipment not normally used by their conventional counterparts. SBSO(A) also provides the USASOC with centralized and integrated material management of property, equipment maintenance, logistical automation and repair parts and supplies.{{r|SOSCOM}}
* [[John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School|John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center]] (USAJFKSWCS) trains USSOCOM and Army Special Operations Forces through development and evaluation of special operations concepts, doctrines and trainings.{{r|USAJFKSWCS}}

In October 2005, the [[Secretary of Defense]] directed the formation of [[United States Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command]], the Marine component of United States Special Operations Command. It was determined that the [[Marine Corps]] would initially form a unit of approximately 2500 to serve with USSOCOM. On February 24, 2006 MARSOC activated at [[Camp Lejeune]], North Carolina. MARSOC initially consisted of a small staff and the Foreign Military Training Unit (FMTU), which had been formed to conduct foreign internal defense. FMTU is now designated as the Marine Special Operations Advisor Group (MSOAG).{{r|2006 Kenyon}}

As a service component of USSOCOM, [[MARSOC]] is tasked by the Commander USSOCOM to train, organize, equip, and deploy responsive U.S. Marine Corps special operations forces worldwide, in support of combatant commanders and other agencies. MARSOC has been directed to conduct foreign internal defense, direct action and special reconnaissance. MARSOC has also been directed to develop a capability in unconventional warfare, counter-terrorism, and information operations.
MARSOC deployed its first units in August 2006, six months after the group's initial activation. MARSOC reached full operational capability in October 2008.{{r|MARSOC}}

'''Units'''
* [[Marine Special Operations Regiment|Marine Raider Regiment]] (Marine Raiders) consists of a Headquarters Company and three Marine Raider Battalions, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd. The Regiment provides tailored military combat-skills training and advisor support for identified foreign forces in order to enhance their tactical capabilities and to prepare the environment as directed by USSOCOM as well as the capability to form the nucleus of a Joint Special Operations Task Force. Marines and Sailors of the MRR train, advise and assist friendly host nation forces – including naval and maritime military and paramilitary forces – to enable them to support their governments' internal security and stability, to counter subversion and to reduce the risk of violence from internal and external threats. MRR deployments are coordinated by MARSOC, through USSOCOM, in accordance with engagement priorities for Overseas Contingency Operations.
* [[Marine Intelligence Battalion]] (MIB) trains, sustains, maintains combat readiness, and provides intelligence support at all operational levels in order to support MARSOF training and operations worldwide with mission-specific intelligence capability.
* [[Marine Special Operations Support Group]] (MSOSG) trains, equips, structures, and provides specially qualified Marine forces, including, operational logistics, intelligence, Military Working Dogs, Firepower Control Teams, and communications support in order to sustain worldwide special operations missions as directed by Commander, U.S. Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (COMMARFORSOC).

** [[The Special Mission Training Branch—East]] provide special operations training in tactics, techniques and procedures, and evaluation and certification of MARSOC forces to specified conditions and standards for SOF. The Marines of MSOS are operators with the training, experience and mature judgment to plan, coordinate, instruct and supervise development of SOF special reconnaissance and direct action skills.{{r|MSOS info}}

===Navy===
[[File:NAVSPECWARCOM.logo.gif|thumb|[[United States Naval Special Warfare Command]] emblem.]]
The [[United States Naval Special Warfare Command]] (NAVSPECWARCOM, NAVSOC, or NSWC) was commissioned April 16, 1987, at [[Naval Amphibious Base Coronado]] in San Diego as the Naval component to the United States Special Operations Command. Naval Special Warfare Command provides vision, leadership, doctrinal guidance, resources and oversight to ensure component special operations forces are ready to meet the operational requirements of combatant commanders.{{r|NAVSOC}} Today, [[United States Navy SEALs|SEAL Teams]] and [[Special Boat Teams]] comprise the elite combat units of Naval Special Warfare. These teams are organized, trained, and equipped to conduct a variety of missions to include direct action, special reconnaissance, counter-terrorism, foreign internal defense, unconventional warfare and support psychological and civil affairs operations. Their highly trained operators are deployed worldwide in support of [[National Command Authority]] objectives, conducting operations with other conventional and special operations forces.

* [[United States Navy SEALs]] have distinguished themselves as an individually reliable, collectively disciplined and highly skilled special operations force. The most important trait that distinguishes Navy SEALs from all other military forces is that SEALs are maritime special operations, as they strike from and return to the sea. SEALs (SEa, Air, Land) take their name from the elements in and from which they operate. SEALs are experts in direct action and special reconnaissance missions. Their stealth and clandestine methods of operation allow them to conduct multiple missions against targets that larger forces cannot approach undetected. Because of the dangers inherent in their missions, prospective SEALs go through what is considered by many military experts to be the toughest training regime in the world.{{r|SEAL website}}{{r|Couch 2001}}
* [[SEAL Team Six|Naval Special Warfare Development Group]] (DEVGRU), referred to as SEAL Team Six, the name of its predecessor which was officially disbanded in 1987.
* [[SEAL Delivery Vehicle Teams]] are SEAL teams with an added underwater delivery capability who use the SDV MK VIII and the Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS), submersibles that provides NSW with an unprecedented capability that combines the attributes of clandestine underwater mobility and the combat swimmer.{{r|insert/extract}}{{r|2002 Tiron}}
* [[Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen]] (SWCC) operate and maintain state-of-the-art surface craft to conduct coastal patrol and interdiction and support special operations missions. Focusing on infiltration and exfiltration of SEALs and other SOF, SWCCs provide dedicated rapid mobility in shallow water areas where larger ships cannot operate. They also bring to the table a unique SOF capability: Maritime Combatant Craft Aerial Delivery System—the ability to deliver combat craft via parachute drop.{{r|2013 SOCOM Fact book}} Like SEALs, SWCCs must have excellent physical fitness, highly motivated, combat-focused and responsive in high stress situations.{{r|SEAL SWCC}}

The '''Vice President of the Confederate States of America''' was the office held by [[Alexander H. Stephens]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], who served under [[President of the Confederate States of America|President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] of [[Mississippi]] from February 18, 1861, until the dissolution of the Confederacy on May 5, 1865. Having first been elected by the [[Provisional Confederate States Congress]], both were considered provisional office-holders until they won the [[Confederate States presidential election, 1861|presidential election of November 6, 1861]] without opposition&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/US_govt_CSA.html World Statesmen.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and inaugurated on February 22, 1862.

==The office==
According to the [[Confederate States Constitution]], the Vice President's office was almost entirely identical to that of the [[Vice President of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/csa/csa.htm |title=Yale University |access-date=2012-03-20 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AhbaG740?url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/csa/csa.htm |archive-date=2012-09-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vice President was elected by an [[Electoral College (Confederate States)|electoral college]] (closely modeled after the [[U.S. Electoral College]]) along with the President. Electors had to cast one of their votes for someone not from their State. If no candidate won a majority in the Electoral College, the [[Confederate Senate]] would elect the Vice President from the top two vote-getters. Like the President, the Vice President had to be a natural-born citizen of the Confederacy or a natural-born citizen of the U.S. born prior to December 20, 1860, and a resident in the Confederacy for over 14 years.

The major difference between the U.S. and the C.S. Vice Presidencies was that the Confederate term in office was six years long. The President was explicitly forbidden from running for a second term by the constitution, but the Vice President was not. It was unclear whether or not a Vice President, who became President in the middle of a term, could run for his own term afterward.

==Duties==
The Vice President's primary duty was presiding over the [[Confederate Senate]] and breaking tied votes, as the U.S. Vice President presides and breaks ties in the U.S. Senate. He was also the first person in the line of succession. If the President died, resigned or was removed from office, the Vice President would become the new president for the remainder of his term. This never happened.

During his tenure in office, Vice President Alexander Stephens grew increasingly distant from President Davis and spent less and less time in Richmond, the Confederate capital. He eventually spent much of his time trying, without success, to maintain diplomatic channels with the USA and pushed for a negotiated end to the war. He was sent by Davis to represent the Confederate government at the [[Hampton Roads Conference|Hampton Roads peace conference]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2492 New Georgia Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27404">[[File:RichardWagner.jpg|thumb|Richard Wagner]]
The German composer [[Richard Wagner]] was a controversial figure during his lifetime, and has continued to be so after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Millington, Barry (Ed.) (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Even today he is associated in the minds of many with [[Nazism]] and his operas are often thought to extol the virtues of [[German nationalism]]. The writer and Wagner scholar [[Bryan Magee]] has written:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I sometimes think there are two Wagners in our culture, almost unrecognizably different from one another: the Wagner possessed by those who know his work, and the Wagner imagined by those who know him only by name and reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Magee, Bryan (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most of these perceptions arise from Wagner's published opinions on a number of topics. Wagner was a voluminous writer and published essays and pamphlets on a wide range of subjects throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;Many of Wagner's writings are available online in English translations at [http://users.belgacom.net/wagnerlibrary/ The Wagner Library].&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner's writing style is verbose, unclear and turgid, which has greatly added to the confusion about his opinions. Several of his writings have achieved some notoriety, in particular his essay ''[[Das Judenthum in der Musik]]'' (''Jewishness in Music''), a critical view on the influence of Jews in German culture and society at that time. The essays he wrote in his final years were also controversial, with many readers perceiving them to employ an endorsement of [[racism|racist]] beliefs. Some commentators also believe that some of Wagner's operas contain adverse caricatures of Jews.

Wagner was promoted during the Nazi era as one of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s favourite composers. Historical perception of Wagner has been tainted with this association ever since, and there is debate over how Wagner's writings and operas might have influenced the creation of Nazi Germany.

Finally there is controversy over both extremes of Wagner's life, his paternity and his death. It is suggested that he was the son of [[Ludwig Geyer]], rather than his legal father Carl Friedrich Wagner, and some of his biographers have proposed that Wagner himself believed that Geyer was Jewish. A belief also exists that his fatal [[heart attack]] followed an argument with his wife [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]] over the singer [[Carrie Pringle]], with whom some claim he had an amorous relationship.

== Paternity ==
[[File:Wagnershofar.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Caricature, entitled ''[[Darwinian Evolution]]'', by T. Zajacskowski in the [[Vienna|Viennese]] satirical magazine, ''Der Floh'', c. 1875. The suggestion is that Wagner descends from the orthodox Jew (left) who is holding a ''[[shofar]]'', while Wagner wields a [[baton (conducting)|baton]].]]

Richard Wagner was born on May 22, 1813, the ninth child of Carl Friedrich Wagner, a clerk in the Leipzig police service, and Johanna Rosine Wagner. Wagner's father died of [[typhus]] six months after Richard's birth, by which time Wagner's mother was living with the actor and playwright [[Ludwig Geyer]] in the [[Brühl (Leipzig)|Brühl]], at that time the Jewish quarter of Leipzig. Johanna and Geyer married in August 1814, and for the first 14 years of his life, Wagner was known as Wilhelm Richard Geyer. Wagner in his later years discovered letters from Geyer to his mother which led him to suspect that Geyer was in fact his biological father, and furthermore speculated that Geyer was Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Magee, Bryan (2002) pages 358 - 361.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gutman, Robert (1968, revised 1990) page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smerus.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/vulture_.htm 'A Vulture is Almost an Eagle'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cosima's diaries (26 December 1868) Wagner "did not believe" that Ludwig Geyer was his real father. At the same time Cosima noted a resemblance between Wagner's son Siegfried and Geyer.&lt;ref&gt;Deathridge (1984), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was one of Wagner's closest acolytes, and proof-read Wagner's autobiography ''[[Mein Leben (Wagner)|Mein Leben]]'' (My Life). It may have been this closeness that led Nietzsche to claim in his 1888 book ''Der Fall Wagner'' ([[The Case of Wagner]]) that Wagner's father was Geyer, and to make the pun that "Ein Geyer ist beinahe schon ein Adler" (A vulture is almost an eagle) &amp;mdash;Geyer also being the German word for "vulture" and Adler being both a very common Jewish surname and the German word for "eagle". Despite these conjectures on the part of Wagner and Nietzsche, there is no evidence that Geyer was Jewish, and the question of Wagner's paternity is unlikely to be settled without [[Genealogical DNA tests|DNA]] evidence.

== Death ==
{{Main article|Carrie Pringle}}
The frequent allegation that Wagner had an affair with the singer Carrie Pringle, and that an argument about this with his wife Cosima precipitated his fatal heart attack, is discussed and dismissed as invention by the Wagner scholar Stewart Spencer, who demonstrates that there is no first-hand or documentary evidence for this story.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antisemitism ==
Prior to 1850 there is no record of Wagner expressing any particular antisemitic sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jacob, (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; However, as he struggled to develop his career he began to resent the success of Jewish composers such as [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]] and blamed them for his lack of success, particularly after his stay in Paris in 1840–41 when he was impoverished and reduced to music copy-editing. Ironically, at the same time Wagner did have considerable contact with Meyerbeer, who loaned him money, and used his influence to arrange for the premiere of ''[[Rienzi]],'' Wagner's first successful opera, in Dresden in 1842; Meyerbeer later expressed hurt and bewilderment over Wagner's written abuse of him, his works, and his faith. Wagner's first and most controversial essay on the subject was ''[[Das Judenthum in der Musik]]'' ''('Jewishness in Music')'', originally published under the pen-name K. Freigedank (K. Freethought) in 1850 in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]''. In a previous issue [[Theodor Uhlig]] had attacked the success in Paris of Meyerbeer's ''[[Le prophète]]'', and Wagner's essay expanded this to an attack on supposed 'Jewishness' in all German art. The essay purported to explain popular dislike of Jewish composers, in particular Mendelssohn and Meyerbeer, who is not mentioned by name but is clearly a target. Wagner wrote that the German people were repelled by Jews due to their 'alien' appearance and behaviour: 'with all our speaking and writing in favour of the Jews' emancipation, we always felt instinctively repelled by any actual, operative contact with them.' He argued that Jewish musicians were only capable of producing music that was shallow and artificial, because they had no connection to the genuine spirit of the German people.

In the conclusion to the essay, he wrote of the Jews that 'only one thing can redeem you from the burden of your curse: the redemption of [[Wandering Jew|Ahasuerus]] — going under!' Although this has been taken by some commentators to mean actual physical annihilation, in the context of the essay it seems to refer only to the eradication of Jewish separateness and traditions. Wagner advises Jews to follow the example of [[Ludwig Börne]] by abandoning Judaism. In this way Jews will take part in 'this regenerative work of deliverance through self-annulment; then are we one and un-dissevered!'&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.belgacom.net/wagnerlibrary/prose/wagjuda.htm Wagner, R. Judaism in Music]&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner was therefore calling for the assimilation of Jews into mainstream German culture and society - although there can be little doubt, from the words he uses in the essay, that this call was prompted at least as much by anti-semitism as by a desire for social amelioration. (In the very first publication, the word here translated as 'self-annulment' was represented by the phrase 'self-annihilating, bloody struggle').&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.belgacom.net/wagnerlibrary/prose/wagjuda.htm Wagner, R. Judaism in Music], note 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial publication of the article attracted little attention, but Wagner wrote a self-justifying letter about it to [[Franz Liszt]] in 1851, claiming that his "long-suppressed resentment against this Jewish business" was "as necessary to me as [[bile|gall]] is to the blood".&lt;ref&gt;''Selected Letters'', ed. Millington and Spencer: letter of 18 April 1851, pp. 221–2&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner republished the pamphlet under his own name in 1869, with an extended introduction, leading to several public protests at the first performances of ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]''. Wagner repeated similar views in later articles, such as "What is German?" (1878, but based on a draft written in the 1860s), and Cosima Wagner's diaries often recorded his comments about "Jews". Although many have argued that his aim was to promote the integration of Jews into society by suppressing their Jewishness, others have interpreted the final words of the 1850 pamphlet (suggesting the solution of an ''Untergang'' for the Jews, an ambiguous word, literally 'decline' or 'downfall' but which can also mean 'sinking' or 'going to a doom'&lt;ref&gt;Collins German Dictionary, London, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;) as meaning that Wagner wished the Jewish people to be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Teachout, (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some biographers, such as [[Theodor Adorno]] and Robert Gutman&lt;ref&gt;Gutman, Robert (1968, revised 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; have advanced the claim that Wagner's opposition to Jews was not limited to his articles, and that the operas contained such messages. In particular the characters of Mime in the ''Ring'', Klingsor in ''[[Parsifal]]'' and Sixtus Beckmesser in ''Die Meistersinger'' are supposedly Jewish stereotypes, although none of them are identified as Jews in the libretto. Such claims are disputed. Wagner, over the course of his life, produced a huge amount of written material analyzing every aspect of himself, including his operas and his views on Jews (as well as many other topics); these purportedly 'Jewish' characterizations are never mentioned, nor are there any such references in Cosima Wagner's copious diaries.&lt;ref&gt;See however Weiner (1997) for very detailed allegations of anti-Semitism in Wagner's music and characterisations&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his published views on Jewishness, Wagner maintained Jewish friends and colleagues throughout his life. One of the most notable of these was [[Hermann Levi]], a practising Jew and son of a [[Rabbi]], whose talent was freely acknowledged by Wagner. Levi's position as [[Kapellmeister]] at Munich meant that he was to conduct the premiere of ''Parsifal'', Wagner's last opera. Wagner initially objected to this and was quoted as saying that Levi should be baptized before conducting ''Parsifal''. Levi, however, held Wagner in adulation, and was asked to be a pallbearer at the composer's funeral.

==Racism==
Some biographers have asserted that Wagner in his final years came to believe in the [[Aryan race|Aryanist]] philosophy of [[Arthur de Gobineau]].&lt;ref&gt;Gutman (1990) pages 418ff&lt;/ref&gt; However the influence of Gobineau on Wagner's thought is debated.&lt;ref&gt;Gregor-Dellin, Martin (1983) pages 468,487.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monsalvat.no/racism.htm ''Parsifal and Race'']&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner was first introduced to Gobineau in person in Rome in November 1876. The two did not cross paths again until 1880, well after Wagner had completed the libretto for ''[[Parsifal]]'', the opera most often accused of containing racist ideology. Although Gobineau's ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' was written 25 years earlier, it seems that Wagner did not read it until October 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Gutman (1990) page 406&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence to suggest that Wagner was very interested in Gobineau's idea that Western society was doomed because of [[miscegenation]] between "superior" and "inferior" races. However, he does not seem to have subscribed to any belief in the superiority of the supposed Germanic or "[[Nordic race]]".

Wagner's conversations with Gobineau during the philosopher's 5-week stay at [[Wahnfried]] in 1881 were punctuated with frequent arguments. Cosima Wagner's diary entry for June 3 recounts one exchange in which Wagner "positively exploded in favour of Christianity as compared to racial theory." Gobineau also believed that in order to have musical ability, one must have black ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Gutman (1990) page 419&lt;/ref&gt;

Wagner subsequently wrote three essays in response to Gobineau's ideas: ''Introduction to a Work of Count Gobineau, Know Thyself'', and ''Heroism and Christianity'' (all 1881). The ''Introduction'' is a short piece&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.belgacom.net/wagnerlibrary/prose/wlpr0155.htm#d0e393 Introduction to a work of Count Gobineau's&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; written for the ''[[Bayreuther Blätter]]'' in which Wagner praises the Count's book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We asked Count Gobineau, returned from weary, knowledge-laden wanderings among far distant lands and peoples, what he thought of the present aspect of the world; to-day we give his answer to our readers. He, too, had peered into an Inner: he proved the blood in modern manhood's veins, and found it tainted past all healing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In "Know Thyself"&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.belgacom.net/wagnerlibrary/prose/wagknow.htm Know Thyself&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner deals with the German people, whom Gobineau believes are the "superior" Aryan race. Wagner in fact rejects the notion that the Germans are a race at all, and further proposes that we should look past the notion of race to focus on the human qualities ("das Reinmenschliche") common to all of us. In "Heroism and Christianity",&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.belgacom.net/wagnerlibrary/prose/waghero.htm Hero-dom and Christendom&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner proposes that Christianity could function to provide a moral harmonization of all races, preferable to the physical unification of races by miscegenation:
&lt;blockquote&gt; Incomparably fewer in individual numbers than the lower races, the ruin of the white races may be referred to their having been obliged to mix with them; whereby, as remarked already, they suffered more from the loss of their purity than the others could gain by the ennobling of their blood [...] To us Equality is only thinkable as based upon a universal moral concord, such as we can but deem true Christianity elect to bring about.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wagner's concerns over miscegenation occupied him until the very end of his life; he was in the process of writing another essay, ''On the Womanly in the Human Race'' (1883),&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.belgacom.net/wagnerlibrary/prose/wlpr0130.htm On the Womanly in the Human Race&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; at the time of his death, in which he discusses the role of marriage in the creation of races:"it is certain that the noblest white race is monogamic at its first appearance in saga and history, but marches toward its downfall through polygamy with the races which it conquers."

Wagner's son-in-law [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]] expanded on Wagner and Gobineau's ideas in his 1899 book ''[[The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Evans (2004), 33–4.&lt;/ref&gt; a racist work extolling the Aryan ideal that later strongly influenced [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ideas on race.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw (1998), 151&amp;nbsp;– "Hitler drew heavily for his ideas from well-known antisemitic tracts such as those of Houston Stewart Chamberlain".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nazi appropriation==
About the time of Wagner's death, European [[nationalism|nationalist]] movements were losing the [[Romanticism|Romantic]], idealistic egalitarianism of 1848, and acquiring tints of militarism and aggression, due in no small part to [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s takeover and unification of Germany in 1871. After Wagner's death in 1883, [[Bayreuth]] increasingly became a focus for German nationalists attracted by the mythos of the operas, who have been referred to by later commentators as the [[Bayreuth Circle]]. This group was endorsed by [[Cosima Wagner]], whose anti-Semitism was considerably less complex and more virulent than Richard's.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Evans (2004), 32-33&lt;/ref&gt; One of the circle was [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], the author of a number of 'philosophic' tracts which later became required Nazi reading. Chamberlain married Wagner's daughter, Eva. After the deaths of Cosima and Siegfried Wagner in 1930, the operation of the Festival fell to Siegfried's widow, English-born [[Winifred Wagner|Winifred]], who was a friend of [[Adolf Hitler]]. The latter was a fanatical admirer of Wagner's music and sought to incorporate it into his heroic mythology of the German nation. Hitler held many of Wagner's original scores in his [[Führerbunker|Berlin bunker]] at the end of World War II, despite the pleadings of [[Wieland Wagner]] to have these important documents put in his care; the scores perished with Hitler in the final days of the war.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

Many scholars have argued that Wagner's views, particularly his anti-Semitism and purported Aryan-Germanic racism, influenced the Nazis. These claims are disputed. Recent studies suggest that there is no evidence that Hitler even read any of Wagner's writings and further argue that Wagner's works do not inherently support Nazi notions of heroism.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Richard J. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; During the Nazi regime, ''Parsifal'' was denounced as being "ideologically unacceptable"&lt;ref&gt;Magee, Bryan (2002), 366.&lt;/ref&gt; and the opera was not performed at Bayreuth during the war years. It has been suggested that a [[de facto]] ban had been placed on ''Parsifal'' by the Nazis;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monsalvat.no/banned.htm |title=The 1939 Ban on Parsifal |author=Everett, Derrick |accessdate=February 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however there were 23 performances at the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]], between 1939 and 1942, which suggests that no formal ban was in place.&lt;ref&gt;Deathridge (2008), 173-174.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazi fascination with Wagner was largely inspired by Hitler, sometimes to the dismay of other high-ranking Nazi officials, including [[Joseph Goebbels]]. In 1933, for instance, Hitler ordered that each [[Nuremberg Rally]] open with a performance of the overture from ''[[Rienzi]]''. He also issued one thousand free tickets for an annual Bayreuth performance of ''Meistersinger'' to Nazi functionaries. When Hitler entered the theater, however, he discovered that it was almost empty. The following year, those functionaries were ordered to attend, but they could be seen dozing off during the performance, so that in 1935, Hitler conceded and released the tickets to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts (1999), 156&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, while Wagner's music was often performed during the Third Reich, his popularity actually declined in Germany in favor of Italian composers such as [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] and [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]. By the 1938–39 season, Wagner had only one opera in the list of fifteen most popular operas of the season, with the list headed by Italian composer [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Pagliacci]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Richard J.(2005), 198-201&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, according to [[Albert Speer]], the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] Orchestra's last performance before their evacuation from Berlin at the end of World War II was of Brünnhilde's immolation scene at the end of ''[[Götterdämmerung]]''.

As part of the regime's propaganda intentions of 'Nazifying' German culture, specific attempts were made to appropriate Wagner's music as 'Nazi' and pseudo-academic articles appeared such as Paul Bülow's "Adolf Hitler and the [[Bayreuth Circle|Bayreuth Ideological Circle]]" (''Zeitschrift fur Musik'', July 1933). Such articles were Nazi attempts to rewrite history to demonstrate that Hitler was integral to German culture.&lt;ref&gt;Spotts, (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that music of Wagner was used at the [[Dachau concentration camp]] in 1933/4 to 'reeducate' [[political prisoner]]s by exposure to 'national music'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.music.ucsb.edu/projects/musicandpolitics/archive/2007-1/fackler.html ''Music in Concentration Camps 1933-45] by [[Guido Fackler]]. See also [http://holocaustmusic.ort.org/places/camps/ Music and the Holocaust] website&lt;/ref&gt; However, there seems to be no documentation to support claims sometimes made that his music was played at [[Nazi death camps]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. John (2004) for a detailed essay on music in the Nazi death camps, which however nowhere mentions Wagner&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wagner's music in Israel==
Wagner's operas have never been staged in the modern [[State of Israel]], and the few public instrumental performances that have occurred have provoked much controversy.

Despite Wagner's known writings against Jews, there was no opposition to his music in the early [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement and its founders; [[Theodor Herzl]], the founder of Zionism, was an avid admirer of Wagner's music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herzl.org/english/Article.aspx?Item=515&amp;Section=491 Herzl Museum website] - article 'Herzl - a Man of his Times'&lt;/ref&gt; The Palestine Orchestra, founded in 1936 by [[Bronisław Huberman]] in what is now the state of Israel (and which became the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]]), 'during its first two years [...] programme[d] several works by Richard Wagner who was recognised as one of the great Western composers despite the well-known fact that he had been a fanatical anti-Semite'. However the orchestra banished his works from its repertoire after [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938 (to be followed shortly after by the exclusion of works of [[Richard Strauss]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bruen (1993), 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Wagner's works are broadcast on Israeli government-owned radio and television stations, attempts to stage public performances in Israel have raised protests, including protests from [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors. In 1981 [[Zubin Mehta]], as an encore at an orchestral concert on Tel-Aviv, played extracts from ''Tristan und Isolde'', after offering those who wished (including two members of the orchestra who had asked to be excused) the opportunity to leave. Despite a few vocal protests, most of the audience stayed to the end of the piece.&lt;ref&gt;Lili Eyton [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/Wagner.html The Controversy over Wagner], in the Jewish Virtual Library website, accessed 7 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheffi (2013), 123&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1992, [[Daniel Barenboim]] programmed works by Wagner at a concert of the Israel Philharmonic, but this was cancelled after protests, although a rehearsal was opened to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Bruen (193), 99&lt;/ref&gt; The first documented public Israeli Wagner concerts were in 2000, when the Holocaust survivor Mendi Rodan conducted the ''[[Siegfried Idyll]]'' in [[Rishon LeZion]], and in August 2001 when [[Daniel Barenboim#Conducting Wagner in Israel|a concert]] conducted by Barenboim in [[Tel Aviv]] included as an encore an extract from ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', which divided the audience between applause and protest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1428634.stm BBC report] of [[Daniel Barenboim]]'s concert in [[Jerusalem]], 8 July 2001&lt;/ref&gt; A concert with works by Wagner was announced for 18 June 2012 in Tel Aviv;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/israeli-orchestra-to-break-boycott-against-wagner-s-works-for-first-time.premium-1.433230# | title=Israeli orchestra to break boycott against Wagner's works for first time| author=Noam Ben-Zeev| date= May 30, 2012 | accessdate=2012-05-31| work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; however these plans were abandoned after protests.&lt;ref&gt;Harriet Sherwood, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/05/tel-aviv-wagner-concert-cancelled?INTCMP=SRCH ''Tel Aviv Wagner concert cancelled after wave of protest''], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 5 June 2012, accessed 5 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Zagreb crisis''' ({{lang-hr|Zagrebačka kriza}}) is the political crisis that followed the elections for the City of [[Zagreb]] local assembly held in October 1995. During the crisis the winning parties were unable to appoint their candidate for [[Mayor of Zagreb]] because the President of Croatia, [[Franjo Tuđman]], refused to provide the formal confirmation of their decision.

A centre-left coalition of winning parties continued to hold majority in the local assembly during the crisis and continued to suggest other candidates, but they were all eventually turned down by the President as Croatian law at the time required a formal Presidential confirmation of the appointment. Meanwhile, the city was run by the government-appointed acting mayor, which meant that the city ''de facto'' had two parallel administrations. The situation led to several huge protests and was not resolved until the next local elections in April 1997, after which two opposition members of the assembly switched to Tuđman's [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) party. This meant that HDZ finally succeeded in gaining the majority in the 50-seat assembly, which enabled the party to appoint their mayor, who was afterwards approved by Tuđman.

==Background==
The crisis had its origin in the factional struggle within the ruling party of Croatia at the time, the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ). In 1993 the former [[Prime Minister of Croatia|Prime Minister]] [[Josip Manolić]], head of security services and leader of HDZ party moderates gradually fell out of favour with President [[Franjo Tuđman]], whose became increasingly aligned with extreme nationalists led by Defence Minister [[Gojko Šušak]]. In the spring of 1994, when it became apparent that Manolić would lose his post of Speaker of the Chamber of Counties (the short-lived upper house body in the [[Croatian Parliament]]), him and [[Stjepan Mesić]], who was at the time Speaker of Parliament, organized a mass defection of HDZ members of parliament who formed a new party called [[Croatian Independent Democrats]] (HND), hoping to strip Tuđman of majority in the parliament. The attempt ultimately failed and Tuđman's party eventually managed to maintain power on the national level. However, in a number of local and regional assemblies the defection of HDZ members allowed opposition parties to gain majorities.

One of these was the [[Zagreb County]] Assembly. For Tuđman this apparently represented an embarrassing setback that he had to revert in any way possible. He initiated legislation aimed at merging the two county-level administrative units (the [[Zagreb County]] and [[Zagreb|City of Zagreb]]) which would then require a new election for the enlarged assembly. The idea was to drown the opposition-controlled Zagreb County assembly with votes from the City of Zagreb constituency, which was at the time widely perceived as a solid HDZ stronghold.

==1995 election==
The new law was passed and the date for the new by-election was called for 29 October 1995, coinciding with the next [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1995|general election]]. It was believed that the widespread euphoria following the August 1995 [[Operation Storm]] and Croatian military success in the last stages of the still ongoing [[Bosnian War]], together with a massive [[propaganda]] drive supported by the state-controlled media, would lead to Tuđman's party comfortably winning majority in the new municipal assembly.

Although the first election results had showed HDZ gaining ground in rural areas of the former Zagreb County, opposition parties managed to achieve success in urban areas of Zagreb proper. This was very apparent in the [[blue-collar]] neighborhoods which switched support from HDZ to the centre-left [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP), mainly due to the populist rhetoric of [[Zdravko Tomac]] and organizational abilities of [[Milan Bandić]], prominent SDP members at the time. As a result, HDZ eventually lost the elections for the new Zagreb assembly, and Zdravko Tomac became the new Speaker of the Assembly.

Soon afterwards, opposition parties formed a governing coalition which elected [[Goran Granić]], a member of the [[Croatian Social Liberal Party]] (HSLS), for mayor.

==The crisis==
Croatian legislation at the time stipulated that the mayor of Zagreb had the status equal to a county prefect (''župan''), and as such his appointment had to be confirmed by the [[President of Croatia]]. This was seen as a mere formality, because Tuđman had already made a precedent by confirming opposition prefects following the disastrous defeat of his party in the February 1993 local elections in [[Istria County]].

However, Tuđman surprised many by saying he would not allow an "opposition situation" in the Croatian capital. Commenting in February 1996 on the outcome of the election, he stated the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/imamo-hrvatsku-stoka-sitnog-zuba-ili-tko-nema-novca-neka-uci/2131065/|title=Imamo Hrvatsku: Stoka sitnog zuba ili tko nema novca, neka uči!|date=20 September 2010|work=[[Jutarnji list]]|last=Bešker|first=Inoslav|authorlink=Inoslav Bešker|language=hr|accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"What does it mean that the opposition has 60% of the vote? It is as if a farmer told you that he had 60 animals in his manor. Are those pigs or calves? Are those chicken or geese? Whereas every sensible farmer and man would know that, compared to such a flock, a single stud, let alone a pair of studs or cows, is worth more than an entire flock."
Tuđman refused to confirm the appointment of an opposition mayor, and the [[Croatian Government]] appointed a former city administration official and HDZ member [[Marina Matulović-Dropulić]] as interim mayor. This caused a stalemate as Zagreb municipal assembly refused to acknowledge Matulović-Dropulić as mayor, but with Tuđman's apparent refusal to confirm an opposition candidate, they were unable to appoint their own. Throughout the following 18 months, three other opposition candidates from HSLS ranks ([[Jozo Radoš]], [[Ivo Škrabalo]] and [[Dražen Budiša]]) had been proposed by the municipal assembly, only to be denied the required presidential confirmation every time. A plan to appoint [[Ante Ledić]], a businessman with strong links to HDZ, which was seen as a compromise solution, also failed. In the meantime, Matulović-Dropulić continued to run city affairs.

==Protests and resolution==
The spectacle of the nation's capital having two administrations not recognizing each other and the country's leader refusing to acknowledge the will of the voters led many to believe that Croatia had experienced a dramatic drop in democratic standards during the war, and that this state of affairs would not be resolved as long as Tuđman remained in power. Increasingly paranoid remarks made by Tuđman in public, who began to describing his political opponents and their supporters as "foreign agents" and "enemies of the state" also contributed to that assessment.

In November 1996, more than a year after the elections, and with the crisis still going on, the Croatian government decided not to renew the [[broadcast license]] for [[Radio 101 (Croatia)|Radio 101]], a popular local radio station known for vocal criticism of the ruling regime, and decided to award the license to [[Ninoslav Pavić]], a media [[tycoon]] widely perceived to be rather tolerant to the regime, instead. The announcement of the decision sparked a mass protest which saw about 120,000 people gathered at the [[Ban Jelačić Square]] on 21 November 1996 in the biggest demonstrations in Croatia's modern history.

Although the immediate cause for the protest had been the desire to preserve a popular symbol of the city, many protesters used the rally as an opportunity to express disagreement with Tuđman and his authoritarian policies. At the same time, Tuđman was out of the country undergoing [[stomach cancer]] treatment at the [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed Hospital]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. Upon hearing what was going on, Tuđman reportedly ordered the police to take action against protesters. The then [[Ministry of the Interior (Croatia)|Interior Minister]] [[Ivan Jarnjak]] reportedly refused to do so, which resulted in his resignation in mid-December. Following the protests, Radio 101 managed to retain its independence and broadcast license as the government's original decision was revoked. Upon returning to Croatia, Tuđman made statements attacking the protests, calling his opponents "''green and yellow devils''" and accusing them of being foreign mercenaries and traitors who sold out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/vrhovnikov-rodjendan-jesmo-li-se-za-ovo-borili/386841.aspx {{hr icon}} Index.hr: Vrhovnikov rođendan: "Jesmo li se za ovo borili?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The regular City of Zagreb local elections were then held in April 1997. This time the opposition parties did not form a coalition and decided to run on separate tickets, allowing HDZ to win 24 out of 50 seats. When two representatives of the centre-right [[Croatian Peasant Party]] (HSS) switched to HDZ in exchange for lucrative government posts in the immediate aftermath of the election, HDZ finally gained an absolute majority in the municipal assembly. This enabled the party to legally appoint Marina Matulović-Dropulić as mayor, who was then confirmed by Tuđman. This formally ended the crisis.

However, in 1998 a mass rally was organised once again at the city's main square, this time by workers' unions. This time the reason for the rally was a drastic drop in the standard of living. The police, however, refused to issue the required permit for the gathering to take place, and police forces cordoned off the square to prevent protesters from reaching it. For several hours, angry citizens attempted to push back the police cordons, but were unsuccessful. The media attention focused on the event, further promoting the idea that Tuđman's rule was becoming  increasingly [[authoritarian]]. Tuđman commented on all of these events yet again, by calling the people involved in them "small-time [[cattle]]" ("''stoka sitnog zuba''").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ce-review.org/00/4/cvijetic4.html CE-Review] CROATIA: 
Coffee With the President&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the crisis' formal resolution in 1997, most citizens of Zagreb and large parts of the Croatian public refused to acknowledge the new administration, considering the crisis an ongoing event. In May 2000, four months after the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2000|general election in January]] in which HDZ had lost power at the national level, the new centre-left government of [[Ivica Račan]] called for a special local by-election in Zagreb, which ultimately resulted in SDP's landslide victory and SDP's [[Milan Bandić]] becoming mayor.

The '''Åland Islands Peace Institute''' in [[Mariehamn]], [[Finland]], conducts projects and research into peace and conflict issues in a broadly defined sense from the vantage-point of [[Åland]] and the special status that Åland enjoys under [[international law]]. It focuses on autonomy in various forms, -minority-related issues, demilitarisation and conflict management. The Institute was founded in 1992 as an independent charitable foundation. 

==Governance &amp; networks==
The Institute is a member of several national and international networks of organisations working on closely related issues. The Steering Board makes decisions relating to the Institute’s overall remit, while the Research Council is responsible for the Institute’s research activities. The Åland Islands Peace Institute has consultative status with the [[UN Economic and Social Council]], ECOSOC.

==Research==
The Peace Institute’s researchers and guest researchers focus on three broad subject areas:
* Security
* Autonomy, including the “Åland Example”
* Minorities

The Institute regularly publishes books and reports in these areas. By arranging seminars and conferences and through a growing -library that is open to the public, the Institute serves as a meeting-point for Åland, the Nordic countries and the [[Baltic Sea]] region.

Autonomy and conflict management seminars are arranged with groups from conflict-ridden regions around the world.

==Educational activities==
The Åland Islands Peace Institute arranges courses and seminar series in Åland and internationally in the following areas:
* Conflict management and non-violence
* Global and regional security
* Democracy and human rights
* Autonomies
* Minorities
* Trafficking prevention

The Institute runs a project called Educating for Peace in Åland’s schools. The aim is to introduce knowledge and experience about conflict management, non-violence, tolerance and school mediation in local schools. The Peace Institute runs this project  in collaboration with the Åland Government and the schools.

==Co-operation with neighbouring regions==
The Åland Islands Peace Institute has built a well-functioning network of non-governmental organisations in [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]] and the [[Kaliningrad]] region (Russia).

This co-operation is based on the experiences gained and methods developed at the Nendre Centre for Women and Children in [[Vilnius, Lithuania]]. Nendre was established in 1998 by the Åland Islands Peace Institute and the Devyndarbe Women’s Club. Today the Centre offers social services to single mothers and their children. It provides support to the mothers, day care for small children and afternoon activities for schoolchildren. Nendre has become recognized as one of the leading organisations in the field of gender equality education and promotion in Lithuania.

Since 2005 Nendre has been sharing its experience with organisations in Belarus and Kaliningrad. The goal is to give marginalised groups the strength to manage their problems and take control of their own lives. Project initiatives include training, counselling and -development activities for women and children.

The Åland Islands Peace Institute has also helped to spread the “girls’ group” method in Lithuania. This method, originally developed in the Nordic countries and adapted to local conditions, helps to -strengthen young girls’ self-awareness and prevent trafficking. The method is now also being introduced in Belarus.

==Youth work and the “Youth in Action” EU Programme==
The Åland Islands Peace Institute participates in international youth work in the following areas:
* European Voluntary Service (EVS). The Institute sends out and receives volunteers.
* Youth exchange programmes.
* Seminars, courses and other activities aimed at promoting dialogue and know-ledge about the living conditions of other people.

==The Åland Conciliation Office==
The Åland Conciliation Office is run by the Åland Islands Peace Institute on behalf of the County Administration in Åland. The Conciliation Office offers conciliation in accordance with the Finnish Act on Conciliation in Criminal and Certain Civil Cases.

Conciliation is a free service. The idea is that the parties through meetings and discussions should be able to agree on an indemnification, e.g. monetary compensation or a work performance. A conciliation session brings together the parties to the breach or dispute and two voluntary, trained and impartial mediators.

==The Åland Islands==
Åland consists of around 6,500 islands, of which 80 are inhabited, and has a population of about 27,000 people. Åland is a self-governing, demilitarised and Swedish-speaking region of Finland. Demilitarisation means that no troops may be stationed in Åland and that no fortifications may be built in the territory. Åland is also neutralised, which means that it must be kept outside the theatre of war in case of conflict. The international regime governing Åland is based on an 1856 demilitarisation convention.

[[File:Emile edde.png|thumb|Émile Eddé]]
'''Émile Eddé''' (5 May 1886 in [[Damascus]], [[Ottoman Syria]] – 28 September 1949) ({{lang-ar|إميل أده}}) was a [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]] [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] political figure.

==Career==
During the period of the French Mandate in which the Republic of Lebanon functioned under the authority of a French High Commissioner, Eddé served as prime minister from 11 October 1929 to 25 March 1930 and as the [[president of Lebanon]] from 1936 to 1941.  On 11 November 1943, following the act of the Lebanese legislature in abolishing the Mandate, the High Commissioner installed Eddé as President.  Ten days later, however, under pressure from France's other Allies in World War II, the French removed Eddé from office and restored the government of [[Bechara El Khoury]] on 21 November. &lt;ref&gt; James Barr, ''A Line in the Sand: The Anglo-French Struggle for the Middle East, 1914-1948'' (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2012) pp244-250  &lt;/ref&gt;, and briefly in 1943.&lt;ref name=Ghhgbjlwire25may&gt;{{cite news|title=Profiles of Lebanon's presidents since independence|url=http://www.lebanonwire.com/0805MLN/08052502AGC.asp|accessdate=21 March 2013|newspaper=Lebanon Wire|date=25 May 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120060845/http://lebanonwire.com/0805MLN/08052502AGC.asp|archivedate=20 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also founded and led the [[Lebanese National Bloc]] party. He was succeeded as party leader by his son [[Raymond Eddé]].
