The '''Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive''' 2011/61/EU (or "AIFMD" for short) is an [[EU law]] on the [[financial regulation]] of [[hedge fund]]s, [[private equity]], real estate funds, and other "Alternative Investment Fund Managers" (AIFMs) in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="FCA14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/markets/international-markets/aifmd |title=Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) |date=12 November 2014 |work=Financial Conduct Authority |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Waller14&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businesslife.co/Features.aspx?id=the-long-and-winding-road |title=The long and winding road |author=Dave Waller |work=''BusinessLife.co'' |accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Directive requires all covered AIFMs to obtain authorisation, and make various disclosures as a condition of operation. It followed the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|global financial crisis]]. Before, the alternative investment industry had not been regulated at EU level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The EU as a Global Player |author=Astrid B.

==Background==
The AIFMD was prompted as part of a wider regulatory effort undertaken by [[G-20 major economies|G20 nations]] following the [[Global financial crisis in September 2008|global market downturn of 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The EU as a Global Player |author=Astrid B.

On the need for the directive, an explanatory document from the European Commission stated that AIFMs had become "very significant actors in the European financial system, managing a large quantity of assets on behalf of pension funds and other investors; accounting for a significant proportion of trading activity in financial markets; and constituting an important source of counterparty risk for other market participants" and that they had "contributed to the build-up of leverage in the financial system, the consequences of which for the stability of financial markets became apparent when leverage in the hedge fund sector was rapidly unwound during the crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=16 September 2015|url= http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-10-572_en.htm?locale=en|title= Directive on Alternative Investment Fund Managers ('AIFMD'): Frequently Asked Questions|date=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the directive was approved by the [[European Parliament]], [[José Manuel Barroso]], then [[President of the European Commission]], said "The adoption of the directive means that hedge funds and private equity will no longer operate in a regulatory void outside the scope of supervisors. The new regime brings transparency and security to the way these funds are managed and operate, which adds to the overall stability of our financial system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |accessdate=16 September 2015|url= http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-10-573_en.htm?locale=en|title= European Commission statement at the occasion of the European Parliament vote on the directive on hedge funds and private equity|date=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
===Ch I, General provisions===

{{expand section|date=May 2016}}
The scope of the application of the directive is defined. The directives apply to EU AIFMs which manage one or more AIFs irrespective of whether such AIFs are EU AIFs or non-EU AIFs; non-EU AIFMs which manage one or more EU AIFs; and non-EU AIFMs which market one or more AIFs in the Union irrespective of whether such AIFs are EU AIFs or non-EU AIFs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L:2011:174:FULL&amp;from=EN|title=Official Journal L 174/2011|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|access-date=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific entities that are exempt from the directives are also listed.

===Ch II, Authorisation===
An AIFM must be authorised with the AIFM's home state regulator for AIFMs that have assets under management in AIFs above the thresholds of: (1) 100 million EUR, if the AIF uses leverage; or (2) 500 million EUR, if the AIF does not use leverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=AIFM Directive for US Private Fund Managers |author=Neil Robson |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/print/article/aifm-directive-us-private-fund-managers |work=The National Law Review |date=24 October 2014 |accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ch III, Operating conditions for AIFMs===
The AIFMD's reporting regulations require each AIF to be named using a series of codes, including its national identification code, the Bank Identifier Code (BIC) and the Legal Entity Identifier code.&lt;ref name=EC2/&gt;&lt;ref name=ESMAconsult13&gt;{{cite journal |year=2013 |title=Consultation paper: guidelines on reporting obligations under Article 3 and Article 4 of the AIFMD |publisher=European Securities and Market Authority |url=http://www.esma.europa.eu/system/files/2013-592_consultation_paper_on_esma_guidelines_on_aifmd_reporting_for_publication.pdf |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; AIFMs must select only brokers and counterparties that are subject to regulatory supervision, that are financially sound, and that have the necessary organizational structure to provide services to the AIFM or the AIF.&lt;ref name=EC2/&gt; All AIFMs must submit quarterly, semi-annual, or annual reports to their respective member state regulator with information about the AIFM and its AIFs as well as an annual report with information such as the fund's financial statements, activities, and information about the total amount of remuneration paid by the AIFM to its staff.&lt;ref name=EC2/&gt;

===Chs IV-V, Transparency requirements===
Special requirements apply to AIFMs using leverage. AIFMs are required to disclose the extent of the leverage employed within their funds, and prove that leverage in any fund has been limited to a reasonable amount.&lt;ref name=PDF&gt;{{cite journal |year=2013 |title=Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive: AIFMs managing leveraged AIFs |pages=3–5 |publisher=Financial Services Commission |url=http://www.fsc.gi/download/AIFMD/AIFMDManagingSpecificTypesOfAIFsAIFMsManagingLeveragedAIFs.pdf |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of AIFMD requirements that apply to AIFMs are different, depending on whether the AIFM is engaged in portfolio or risk management activities within the EU or markets its funds to EU investors. Each fund can only have one AIFM, though the AIFM can delegate certain functions to other entities. EU AIFMs became subject to all of the provisions of the AIFMD once it was implemented at the EU Member State level.&lt;ref name=Yonge13&gt;{{cite news |title=AIFMD's Impact on Non-EU Managers of Non-EU Alternative Investment Funds |author=William Younge |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-338211304.html |work=Mondaq Business Briefing |date=30 July 2013 |accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorised fund managers located within the EU are permitted to market their EU funds to professional investors in any EU member state under what the AIFMD calls a passport.&lt;ref name=Yonge13/&gt;

The reporting requirements of the AIFMD apply to all AIFMs who manage or market alternative funds within the EU.&lt;ref name=Hedgeweek14&gt;{{cite news |title=SEI introduces AIFMD Annex IV reporting solution |url=http://www.hedgeweek.com/2014/12/09/214424/sei-introduces-aifmd-annex-iv-reporting-solution |work=HedgeWeek |date=12 September 2014 |accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To fulfill the reporting requirements, AIFMs must file an Annex IV report within 30 days of the end of the applicable reporting period, which is determined by the amount of an AIFM's assets under management. Reporting periods range from quarterly to half-yearly to annually.&lt;ref name=ESMAconsult13/&gt; The Annex IV report is a government regulatory document comprising 41 questions, analysing a fund's investment portfolios, exposures, leverage ratios, liquidity and risk analysis.&lt;ref name=Lipman14&gt;{{cite news |title=This is Why AIFMD Annex IV Reports Demand More Attention |author=Becca Lipman |url=http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/data-management/this-is-why-aifmd-annex-iv-reports-demand-more-attention/d/d-id/1268695? |work=Wallstreet &amp; Technology |accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=COOwebinar&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cooconnect.com/webinar-review/how-ready-are-aifms-for-annex-iv-reporting-under-aifmd |title=2014 Q2 Webinar Programme |author=CME Group |date=7 July 2014 |work=COOConnect |accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter V, section 2, articles 26–30, additional obligations apply for AIFs acquiring controlling influence in non-listed companies. This is essentially directed at [[private equity]] firms, and partly aims to stop [[asset stripping]]. Article 26(5) defines "control" as holding over 50% of voting rights, including as a ‘club deal’. This was watered down from 30% in the AIFMD draft (formerly in article 26(1)(a)). Article 27(1) states that funds have to notify investee companies and shareholders when they acquire control, and article 28(4) requires them to disclose the acquisition to stakeholder groups including employees or representatives via the investee's board. Article 29 places an obligation on the central Private Equity management company (rather than an investee companies) to give information on operational and financial developments in firm's annual reports. Article 30 lists distribution requirements, which are intended to prevent [[asset stripping]] in the first 24 months from acquiring control).

===Chs VI-VIII, Marketing and the AIFMD passport===
For the purposes of the directive, marketing is defined as any offering or placement (sale) of an AIF at the initiative of the AIFM, or on behalf of the AIFM, to investors domiciled in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=AIFM Directive for US Private Fund Managers |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/aifm-directive-us-private-fund-managers |work=The National Law Review |date=24 October 2014 |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lawrence14&gt;{{cite news |title=AIFMD: Time to Back Up on Reverse Solicitation |author=David Lawrence |url=http://www.finalternatives.com/node/26688 |work=FIN Alternatives |date=8 April 2014 |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Member state laws and rules determine whether a fund is engaged in marketing for purposes of the directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The British Virgin Islands – AIFMD one year on |author=Tim Clipstone |url=http://www.hedgeweek.com/2014/06/27/205833/british-virgin-islands-%E2%80%93-aifmd-one-year |work=HedgeWeek |date=27 June 2014 |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EU funds managed by EU managers may be marketed across the EU under the AIFMD passport, provided the manager complies with all of the requirements of the directive.&lt;ref name=Lawrence14/&gt; EU or non-EU funds managed by non-EU managers may currently be marketed within the EU only under national private placement regimes, as non-EU managers cannot obtain the marketing passport.&lt;ref name=Moran15&gt;{{cite news |title=AIFMD offers passport to European markets |author=Michelle Moran |url=http://www.ftadviser.com/2015/03/30/investments/fixed-income/aifmd-offers-passport-to-european-markets-maFHbHp1XZ0R07MAUizxnK/article.html |work=Financial Times Advisor |date=30 March 2015 |accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Likewise, non-EU funds managed by EU managers may only be marketed under the private placement regimes. Funds marketed under national private placement regimes are subject to compliance with certain provisions of the AIFMD related to reporting, regulatory co-operation agreements, and the jurisdiction of the fund and the manager not being listed as a "non-cooperative country and territory" by the [[Financial Action Task Force]] (FATF).&lt;ref name=EurActiv15&gt;{{cite news |title=Why competition is vital to Europe's investors |url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/euro-finance/why-competition-vital-europes-investors-311308 |work=''EurActiv.com'' |date=15 January 2015 |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, an analyst for EurActiv.com, a European news and policy website, expressed concern that the directive puts non-EU funds at a disadvantage.&lt;ref name=EurActiv15/&gt;&lt;ref name=Griffith14&gt;{{cite news |title=The AIFMD Deadline Tomorrow: Is The Industry Ready? |author=Saul Griffith |url=http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/07/aifmd-hedge-funds/ |work=ValueWalk |date=21 July 2014 |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the European Securities and Markets Authority initiated a consultation to discuss issuing new rules to allow EU AIFMs to market their non-EU AIFs under the AIFMD passport, and likewise for non-EU managers to market their funds under the AIFMD passport.&lt;ref name=EurActiv15/&gt;&lt;ref name=COO&gt;{{cite news |title=Uncertainty over extent to which AIFMD passport will be afforded to non-EU managers |url=http://cooconnect.com/news/uncertainty-over-extent-to-which-aifmd-passport-will-be-afforded-to-non-eu-managers |work=COO Connect |date=16 February 2015 |accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ESMAevidence&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esma.europa.eu/consultation/Call-evidence-AIFMD-passport-and-third-country-AIFMs |title=Call for evidence on AIFMD passport and third country AIFMs |publisher=ESMA |accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016 AIFM concluded that there were no fundamental obstacles to issuing AIFMD passports to Canada, [[Guernsey]], Japan, [[Jersey]] and [[Switzerland]], seven other non-EU countries are also under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-advises-extension-funds-passport-12-non-eu-countries |title=EXTENSION OF FUNDS PASSPORT TO 12 NON-EU COUNTRIES |publisher=ESMA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principality of Liechtenstein (1 April 2013)===
Since 1 April 2013, the FMA Liechtenstein accepts applications for authorisation of AIFMs and AIFs as well as other persons and entities requiring authorisation under the AIFM Act.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fma-li.li/en/intermediaries/securities-division/alternative-investment-fund-managers-under-the-aifm-act/authorization.html&lt;/ref&gt;
On 30 September 2016, the EEA Joint Committee, whose decisions result in the inclusion of new EU law in the EEA Agreement, decided to incorporate the first package of legal acts relating to the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.regierung.li/news1.aspx?id=115237&amp;nid=7292&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malta (27 June 2013)===
On 27 June 2013 (the measures were released on 25 June 2013) [[Malta]] became the first EU Member State to complete the transposition of the requirements of the Directive into national law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ganadoadvocates.com/resources/news/malta-publishes-final-aifmd-implementing-measures-malta-is-open-for-aifmd-business/|title=Malta publishes final AIFMD implementing measures: Malta is open for AIFMD business|work=''ganadoadvocates.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maltese legislator and the [[Malta Financial Services Authority]] transposed the requirements of the Directive by means of a series of regulations issued under the Investment Services Act (Cap. 370, Laws of Malta) and a number of new MFSA rulebooks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfsa.com.mt/pages/readfile.aspx?f=readfile.aspx?f=/files/AIFMD/MFSA%20Statement%20on%20AIFMD.pdf MFSA Statement on the AIFMD.

==Reception==
In a study conducted by Multifonds in June 2014, 72% of respondents from the EU and Canada said they expected non-EU managers to set up European operations in order to take advantage of AIFMD.&lt;ref name=Multifonds12&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.multifonds.com/media-centre/news/two-thirds-fund-admin-industry-believes-aifmd-will-be-catalyst-convergence-long-on |title=Two-thirds of fund admin industry believes AIFMD will be a catalyst for the convergence of long-only and hedge funds |author=Fishburn Hedges |date=10 September 2012 |work=Media Centre |publisher=Multifonds |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 study conducted by [[Preqin]], 71% of American fund managers said they believed the AIFMD would have a negative effect on the industry.&lt;ref name=Schmerken14b&gt;{{cite news |title=Hedge Fund Readiness for AIFMD Is Lacking as Deadline Approaches |author=Ivy Schmerken |url=http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/compliance/hedge-fund-readiness-for-aifmd-is-lacking-as-deadline-approaches/d/d-id/1297376 |work=Wall Street &amp; Tech |date=17 July 2014 |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jessop14&gt;{{cite news |title=Foreign hedge funds could lose as Europe tightens rules |author=Simon Jessop |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/21/uk-hedgefunds-aifmd-idUSKBN0FQ15G20140721 |agency=Reuters |date=21 July 2014 |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fund managers from within the EU, Asia and the rest of the world excluding the United States reported in 2014&lt;ref name=Hernandez14&gt;{{cite news |title=Minority of Infrastructure and Real Estate Fund Managers Believe AIFMD Has Positive Impact |author=Vittorio Hernandez |url=http://www.ibtimes.com.au/minority-infrastructure-real-estate-fund-managers-believe-aifmd-has-positive-impact-1350071 |work=International Business Times |date=11 August 2014 |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2015&lt;ref name=Kumar15&gt;{{cite news |title=European hedge funds close at record pace as higher costs, poor returns bite |author=Nishant Kumar |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/16/hedgefunds-europe-closures-idUSL3N0U62N620150216 |agency=Reuters |date=16 February 2015 |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the AIFMD was costing them more than they had expected it to.&lt;ref name=Kilhof14&gt;{{cite news |title=AIFMD compliance falls behind |author=Sandra Kilhof |url=http://www.worldfinance.com/wealth-management/aifmd-compliance-falls-behind |work=World Finance: The Voice of the Market |date=15 November 2014 |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of the costs of the legislation comes partly from industry lobbyists.&lt;ref name=Griffith14/&gt;

According to a study conducted by [[Deloitte]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_LU/lu/market-challenges/aifmd/index.htm|title=AIFMD|work=Deloitte Luxembourg}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of the UK-based [[asset management|asset managers]] think that the AIFM Directive could reduce the competitiveness of the EU's alternative investment funds industry because of the compliance the regulations impose on the industry. In addition, these managers from the hedge fund, private equity and real estate sectors believe that the directive will reduce the number of non-EU managers operating within the EU.  The AIFMD passed after contentious negotiations, especially between UK and French authorities, and because of its third-country provisions, which attracted considerable interest and engagement from U.S. authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=2383445 |title=Varieties of Regulation: How States Pursue and Set International Financial Standards |last1=Prabhakar |first1=Rahul |date=1 June 2013 |publisher=Oxford University GEG |accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals''' ('''ASPCA''') is a [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to preventing [[cruelty to animals]]. Based in [[New York City]] since its inception in 1866, the organization's mission is "to provide effective means for the prevention of cruelty to animals throughout the United States."&lt;ref name=ASPCAAbout&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspca.org/about-us/history.aspx |title=About the |publisher=ASPCA |date=1995-01-01 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Miss Baker with Certificate of Merit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Squirrel monkey]] "[[Miss Baker]]" poses with the Certificate of Merit for Distinguished Service she was awarded by the ASPCA after her successful return to earth, the associated medal, and the couch used for her flight (to the right). Baker and her traveling companion Able were the first animals to return alive from space.]]

Following the creation of the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (RSPCA) in the United Kingdom in 1824 (given Royal status in 1840), [[Henry Bergh]] founded the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals on April 10, 1866 in [[New York City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspca.org/about-us/about-the-aspca|title=About Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the belief that animals are entitled to kind and respectful treatment at the hands of humans, and must be protected under the law. It is the oldest [[animal welfare]] organization in the United States. Founded in 1866, the ASPCA was the first humane organization in the Western Hemisphere.  Buffalo's chapter, founded in 1867, is the second oldest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=general_history |title=SPCA Serving Erie County |publisher=Yourspca.org |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASPCA was founded to stop the injustices animals face across the United States. On February 8, 1866, Bergh pleaded on behalf of animals at a meeting at Clinton Hall in New York City. Some of the issues he discussed were [[cockfighting]] and the horrors of [[slaughterhouses]]. After getting signatures for his "Declaration of the Rights of Animals," Bergh was given an official charter to incorporate ASPCA on April 10, 1866. On April 19, 1866, the first anti-cruelty law was passed since the founding of ASPCA, and the organization was granted the right to enforce anti-cruelty laws. At that time, there were three staff members at the ASPCA. In 1867, ASPCA operated its first ambulance for injured horses and advocated alternatives for inhumane actions toward animals such as horses, live pigeons, cats and dogs. By the time of Bergh's death in 1888, 37 out of the 38 states in the union had enacted anti-cruelty laws that were enforced by the ASPCA. Early goals of ASPCA focused on efforts for horses and [[livestock]], since at the time they were used for a number of activities.

Starting at the turn of the 20th century, small domestic animals, like cats and dogs, became the focus for members of ASPCA. ASPCA wrote its first annual report in 1867 after a man was sentenced to 2 years in prison for beating a cat to death.&lt;ref name=ASPCAHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_history|title=ASPCA|website=ASPCA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''at the time of citation, this item was not available online''&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal| author = Staff| year = 2009| title = The ASPCA Has Spent More than 140 Years Protecting Our Nation's Equines| journal = ASPCA Action| volume = 5| issue = 1 (Winter 2009)| pages = ppg 1&amp;ndash;4| publisher = ASPCA| location = New York| issn = 1554-6624| oclc = 57658359| url = http://www.aspca.org/news/aspca-action/| format = print| accessdate = 2009-02-15| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090131080637/http://www.aspca.org/news/aspca-action/| archivedate = 2009-01-31| deadurl = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1894 to 1994, the ASPCA operated the municipal [[animal shelter]] system in New York City which inevitably euthanized unadopted animals. Starting in 1977, the ASPCA entered into a contract with [[New York City Department of Health]] to receive municipal funding to operate the shelter system. This created the effect of being increasingly reliant on government contracting/government income rather than private donations. This resulted in being subject to the effects of yearly city budget appropriations. In 1993, the ASPCA decided that operating the kill shelter system for New York City conflicted with its mission and discouraged private donations. The group then terminated its contract for operating the shelter system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/26/nyregion/aspca-plans-to-stop-killing-strays.html | work=The New York Times | title=A.S.P.C.A.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement for operation of the Humane Law Enforcement Division remained unchanged by this action. Operation of the shelter system was transferred to [[Center for Animal Care and Control]] in 1995.

==Medicine for animals under ASPCA==
One of the early goals of ASPCA was to improve the health and welfare of animals. The first [[veterinary medicine|animal hospitals]] under ASPCA were created in 1912. Since the creation of these hospitals, ASPCA found a new tactic in improving its cause: the ability to develop various medical procedures and innovations with help from new discoveries in medicine and technology. Some of these procedures and innovations include the following:
*In 1918, ASPCA veterinarians developed the use of anesthesia and as a result were able to work on a horse with a broken kneecap
*In 1954, ASPCA hospitals added pathology and radiography laboratories and programs
*In 1961, ASPCA veterinarians performed their first open-heart surgery on a dog&lt;ref name=ASPCAHistory/&gt;

===Resources for pets and parents===
[[File:ASPCA Rogers Memorial 233 Butler St Bk jeh.jpg|thumb|Brooklyn chapter]]
This initiative is designed to assist individuals' care for their animals in a proper and ethical way. Some services offered to assist individuals are:
* A 24-hour Animal Poison Control Line
* Free expert training and behavior advice
* A dedicated staff of veterinarians ready to provide high-quality medical care
* ASPCA mobile spay/neuter clinics that serve low-income communities throughout New York City
* Pet loss support services for those who are grieving
24 hour animal poison control line requires $65 payment by credit card

===Outcomes for at-risk animals===
This program is designed as an initiative to take steps to take care and provide for at-risk animals around the country. Some programs designed to help at-risk animals include:
* The ASPCA Mission: Orange Initiative: An invitation of key cities across the United States to join ASPCA in ending the unnecessary euthanasia of adoptable pets.
* Creating plans for animals in times of emergency by ASPCA experts
* An {{convert|8000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} state-of-the-art adoption facility in New York City
* ASPCA Meet Your Match, a research-based matching system to match animals with the best homes.
* Helping at-risk horses with the ASPCA Equine Fund

==Other efforts==
The ASPCA describes itself as the nation's main humane organization, "providing local and national leadership in three key areas: caring for pet parents and pets, providing positive outcomes for at-risk animals and serving victims of animal cruelty".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aspca.org/Home/About-Us/programs-services-landing |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327085059/http://www.aspca.org/Home/About-Us/programs-services-landing |archive-date=2012-03-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from rescuing animals, the ASPCA is also involved with disaster preparedness and management. For instance, prior to [[Hurricane Gustav]] making landfall in Louisiana on September 1, 2008, the ASPCA checked in more than 800 animals into a shelter located in Shreveport. The ASPCA, along with the [[American Humane Association]], maintained a 24-hour presence at the shelter.

The ASPCA works primarily with [[Pet|companion animal]] issues, such as pet care, equine or horse cruelty issues, and animal cruelty and neglect. Its programs and services include: a national [[Poison control center|poison control]] hotline for pet owners and animal health professionals; a [[Animal shelter|shelter]] outreach program to promote best practices within locally owned shelters, a corporate partner program to promote animal-friendly products and services, and a special anti-cruelty initiative to teach animal welfare education and [[animal welfare]] law enforcement practices (known as "humane law enforcement" within the organization) across the United States. In the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement Division|ASPCA's Humane Law Enforcement division]] has powers to investigate cruelty and enforce laws. The Humane Law Enforcement division has been featured on the [[Animal Planet]] television program, ''[[Animal Precinct]]''.

The ASPCA provides relief services for the domestic animal victims of [[natural disaster]]s such as [[Hurricane Katrina]], where the National Outreach department collected donations to provide supplies; coordinated volunteer efforts; deployed rescue teams to recover [[abandoned pets]]; provided temporary shelter to displaced animals; and reunited pets with their owners.

The ASPCA has also partnered with Hartville Group, Inc to provide pet health insurance under the ASPCA name as ASPCA Pet Insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartvillegroup.com/|title=Crum &amp; Forster Pet Insurance|website=www.hartvillegroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cases involving torture, killings and mistreatment of animals are some examples of cases handled by the ASPCA. A common example was displayed in the news in October 2008, when the ASPCA was in charge of an investigation involving the slaughtering of a [[beagle]] that lived in the Bronx. Brian McCafferty was charged with torturing and injuring his wife's beagle, Jerry, after an argument with his wife. The ASPCA conducted an [[necropsy]] that concluded that Jerry was stabbed twice and shot in the neck with a rifle. McCafferty claims that he was acting in self-defense when the dog attacked him. He was eventually released on bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishabroad.com/news/irish-voice/news/Articles/wifes-dog-killed051108.aspx |title=Man Charged With Killing Wife’s Dog |publisher=Irishabroad.com |date=2008-11-05 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ASPCA has an Adopt-a-Shelter-Dog program each October where it holds events and programs, and recruits and asks potential pet owners to adopt one of the more than one million animals living in shelters across the country.

At ''ASPCA Day'' on April 10 each year, the organizes encourages supporters to wear orange—the official color of the ASPCA—to commemorate the protection of animals. ASPCA members spread their message that day using mobile adoption vans, photo booths for pets, information booths on animal cruelty laws and ways to better care for pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=aspcaday |title=Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Month |publisher=ASPCA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515213048/http://www.aspca.org/about-us/aspca-april/ |archivedate=May 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2014 the ASPCA spoke out in support of new New York City mayor Bill de Blasio's campaign to ban horse-drawn carriages in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/nyregion/who-speaks-for-the-horses-in-battle-over-carriages.html |title=Who Speaks for the Carriage Horses? |publisher=New York Times |date=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
In 2012 the ASPCA agreed to pay [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]] $9.3 million of donations to settle a lawsuit regarding the ASPCA's false allegations of animal cruelty by the circus. Courts found that ASPCA activists had paid the key witness, a former Ringling barn helper, at least $190,000, making him "essentially a paid plaintiff" who lacked credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_22273969/animal-rights-group-settles-lawsuit-ringling/ |title=Animal rights group settles lawsuit with Ringling |publisher=Denver Post |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2017-01-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230031351/http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_22273969/animal-rights-group-settles-lawsuit-ringling/ |archivedate=December 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwin J. Sayres stepped down as CEO in 2012, and in 2013 longtime ASPCA staff member Matthew Bershadker was named president and CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/fashion/angst-at-the-aspca.html|title=Angst at the ASPCA |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
The ASPCA is active in [[lobbying]] for animal welfare legislation, with regional and federal lobbyists covering all 50 states. The ASPCA communicates with federal and state legislators to consider animal-friendly legislation and bills. The ASPCA also drafts animal welfare legislation initiatives and proposals for legislators to consider during their sessions. The ASPCA's "Advocacy Brigade" allows users to write or e-mail their legislators on important animal legislation bills and referendums.

In 2008, the Illinois Senate passed the bill HB 5076. This bill contains various "Good Samaritan" provisions that protect rescuers from being sued if they rescue and provide for an injured animal in disasters or other emergencies. This bill also brings clarification to the Humane Care for Animals Act.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myequinenetwork.com/News/tabid/56/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/1678/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== Groups under the ASPCA ==
The ASPCA has three groups in which they are divided: Animal Health Services, Anti-Cruelty and Community Outreach. From those three groups, the groups have subsidiary departments. The Animal Health Services group is composed of three departments that focus on the health and well-being of animals. The Anti-Cruelty Group has eight departments that focus on different problems relating to animal cruelty. The Community Outreach Group works with multiple resources so that more animals that are classified as at risk-animals will be helped by the improvements that the group provides.&lt;ref name=":07"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aspca.org/about-us/aspca-policy-and-position-statements/structure|title=Structure|website=ASPCA|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

Life-saving treatment to animals, whose owners cannot afford the treatment, are provided by The Trooper Fund which is administrated by the Animal Hospital. Another department is the [https://www.aspcapro.org/about-programs-services/aspca-animal-poison-control-center ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center], which provides treatment for natural and man-made chemical exposure poisonings. New findings are published and therefore promote poison prevention, leading to improvement of animal lives. The group also has a Mobile Spay/Neuter Clinics. The surgical mobile units help end the euthanasia of adoptable animals which serves the ASPCA Mobile Spay/Neuter Clinics mission through the recognition of overpopulation.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt;

=== Anti-Cruelty Group ===

==== Field Investigation and Response &amp; Forensic Sciences and Anti-Cruelty Projects ====
The Field Investigation and Response teams work with animal rescue from cases including abuse, neglect and natural-disasters or man-made disasters.

The also offers The [https://www.nij.gov/topics/forensics/Pages/welcome.aspx Forensic Science] and Anti-Cruelty department, which focuses on providing assistance in both criminal cases involving animals and any evidence surrounding animals in a crime. Through the use of the departments original research and outreach to professional disciplines related to the case, the department uses medicine, forensic science, and animal behavior to assist with the prosecution and prevention of animal cruelty. The department also provides legal assistance which can be described as, “assistance to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies as well as animal care and control agencies, local humane societies and SPCAs, veterinary associations and individual practitioners.”&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt;

==== Humane Law Enforcement/Cruelty Intervention Advocacy/NYPD ====
The ASPCA has a partnership with the NYPD, which began in January 2014. The partnership occurred when the NYPD took on the task of answering calls of animal cruelty in the city. While the NYPD answers cruelty calls, ASPCA works with what follows, such as providing medical attention, legal backup and finding a place for the animal. The Humane Law Enforcement team maintains a relationship with the NYPD officers by giving them training on how to respond to animal cruelty cases. Not only does the program do things to benefit their goal but, “instead involve owners who face barriers to providing care to their animals due to either a lack of financial resources, access to services or other circumstances, such as domestic violence, medical or mental health challenges”&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt;

==== ASPCA Behavioral Rehabilitation Center &amp; Anti-Cruelty Behavior Team (ACBT) ====
The [https://www.aspca.org/animal-placement/behavioral-rehabilitation-center Behavioral Rehabilitation] center is the only center dedicated for this cause and is located in Madison, New Jersey. The center helps rehabilitate animals that are under socialized or fearful of human interaction, which usually come from cases of hoarding and puppy mills. These animals go through a program which they will graduate from and be up for adoption. Animals that come in from cruelty cases are provided with behavior support from the ACBT. The ACBT also works with providing agencies recommendations on how to rehabilitate the animals through assessments that they have performed.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt;

==== Legal Advocacy ====
The department makes prosecution of animal cruelty and animal fighting cases successful by giving legal assistance. The assistance is given to the people who are involved in the cases such as the prosecutors, police and cruelty investigators. Legal documents, resources and proceedings related to animal cruelty cases are given to the prosecutors and legal investigators as a way of providing legal assistance in an animal related criminal case. Cases that could impact many animals or could potentially have an important impact by changing a legislation in the field are identified/found and worked with.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt;

==== Anti-Cruelty Strategy and Campaigns ====
The department works by setting multi-pronged campaigns, having a main focus on improving the welfare for farm animals and ending puppy mills, therefore doing their goal of reducing animal suffering. They strive for animals to have a more humane life and do so through their holistic and multi-pronged approach. The department has two teams, the farm team and the puppy mill team. The farm team works by increasing the consumer demand, which include advocating for regulations and protective laws and better living conditions for the animals. Through the increase in consumer demand, the team seeks to improve welfare standards and transparency in the agricultural facilities. The puppy mill team do their job by talking to the public and educating them on how bad puppy mills are. The puppy mill team, like the farm team, advocate for laws and legislation that would improve the situation of those animals, such as legislating for the elimination of puppy mills that have substandard breeding operations.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt;

=== Community Outreach Group ===

==== Community Outreach Programs Office (COPO) ====
The COPO department oversees the group as a whole. They ensure the staff is up to date with all the things that the group is doing. The department also makes sure that information is sent out and distributed to all staff. The department is also in charge of the cohesiveness of the programs within the group. They are the ones that coordinate the meetings and provide the data for the meetings, primarily statistical reports.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt;

Some of the programs that the department has includes, improving the shelters, the relocation of animals that are at risk, creating the standards for national disaster readiness and the improvement of professionalism. Through the ASPCA Equine Fund, the department is able to give grants to expand the capabilities of sanctuaries and of equine rescues.&lt;ref name=":07" /&gt;

==== Adoption Center ====
The Adoption Center has the main goal of “finding good homes for as many dogs and cats possible.” The center helps groups or organizations around them by taking in animals from the public, other shelters and other rescue groups.

The '''art student scam''' is a [[confidence trick]] in which cheap, [[mass-produced]] paintings or prints are misrepresented as original works of art, often by young people pretending to be art students trying to raise money for art supplies or tuition fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scam art ripples Peninsula "Students" up-sell cheap, mass-produced works door-to-door|newspaper=''Peace Arch News'' |location=The (White Rock, British Columbia, Canada) |date= 10 August 2004 |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |id= |page=1 |quote=An Israeli art scam with suggested links to espionage and fundamentalist fundraisers may have turned up on the Semiahmoo Peninsula.

==Mass-produced paintings==
Most mass-produced prints and paintings originate in Asia.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} These are essentially posters, sometimes referred to as "Hong Kong horrors," printed on rough paper, making the absence of brush strokes less apparent. There is a confusion between "mass-produced paintings" which are actually prints. These are being sold over the internet described as real oil paintings, taking advantage of the difficulty of spotting the scam behind the screen. Sometimes a few brush strokes are added to the prints to give them a more authentic oil-painting look.

==Australia and New Zealand==
People posing as art students were reported in Australia and New Zealand from as early as 2003.&lt;ref name=moyes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/east-bays-courier/3403169/Warning-on-art-scam|title=Warning on art scam|last=Moyes|first=Sarah|author2=Michelle Robinson|date=5 March 2010|work=East And Bays Courier|accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designfederation.net/general/beware-of-door-to-door-art-scams/|title=Beware of 'Israeli' door-to-door art scams!|last=Rogers|first=Sy|date=2 March 2009|work=Design Federation|accessdate=29 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100719053941/http://www.designfederation.net/general/beware-of-door-to-door-art-scams/| archivedate= 19 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings, worth around [[A$]]5, were passed off as being worth hundreds of dollars.&lt;ref name="ABCAustralia"/&gt; Three backpackers—an Israeli and two Chileans—were taken to court in [[Dunedin]] for the scam in 2003 but were discharged as the judge said that they were "minnows" in the organisation.

The [[Consumers' Institute of New Zealand]] suspected that an Auckland man was the organiser of the operation.&lt;ref name="NZ"/&gt; A 23-year-old man was arrested in New South Wales, Australia, for operating the scam and 50 oil paintings were found in his car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/12/13/2445638.htm?site=idx-nsw|title=Police arrest 23yo over alleged art scam|date=13 December 2008|work=ABC News|accessdate=29 July 2010|location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adviser for the New Zealand [[Ministry of Economic Development (New Zealand)#Organisation|Consumer Affairs Ministry]] said: "All around the world, students from various countries are doing this."

==Canada==
In 2004, a group of Israelis said to have been selling mass-produced paintings as their own work, for hundreds of dollars each, were deported from Canada for working in violation of their visas. The scam recurred in 2009 in [[Calgary]] and in [[Warman, Saskatchewan]]. Eight people claiming to be students from Israel, Germany, and France were arrested, and 100 paintings were seized by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and Border Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstalk980.com/story/20090904/21900 |title=Scam 'Artists' in Warman |last=Slobodian |first=Erin |date=4 September 2009 |work=News Talk 980 |accessdate=29 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909184329/http://www.newstalk980.com/story/20090904/21900 |archivedate=9 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
In China, scammers approach tourists at popular attractions such as the [[Forbidden City]] and [[Tiananmen Square]].&lt;ref&gt;"The famous art show ripoff in Tiananmen Square was recently cleaned up for the Olympics. This was a pretty funny one, where English-speaking 'art students' would strike up conversation with overseas visitors and tell them they happen to be in town for an art show across the street. The show was closing today when I first heard the spiel in 2006, it was closing today when I returned to Beijing in 2007, but the pre-Olympics cleanup really seems to have closed the collection of knockoff art."

See also [http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Asia/China/Beijing_Shi/Beijing-1024960/Tourist_Traps-Beijing-Art_Students-BR-1.html].&lt;/ref&gt; The scammer speaks English well enough to get into a conversation with the foreigner and then claims to be an art student whose works are on display at a nearby exhibition, which is part of the scam and sells mass-produced art reproductions at exorbitant prices.

==United States==
From the summer of 2000, news outlets in the [[Pacific Northwest]] reported that young people were posing as art students selling mass-produced oil paintings, both copies and originals, for US$780–$2000 each. The so-called art students were said to be selling in exhibitions and galleries, primarily targeting local businesses. They claimed to be studying at art schools in Europe and to be in the United States selling works by talented fellow artists to raise money for art supplies or school fees.&lt;ref name="Seattle"/&gt;

Through the early 2000s, some 13 separate incidents of "art student" encounters were reported across the United States.

In 2004, the scam surfaced again in Atlanta and Boston, with allegations that the Europeans art students were asking about the new [[National Security Agency]]'s data center.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

In late September, 2017, the scam appears to be active in the suburbs southeast of Portland, Oregon, perpetrated by a woman going door-to-door claiming to be an Israeli art student. &lt;ref&gt; https://happyvalleyor.nextdoor.com/news_feed/?post=65305911/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Australian mining law''' governs the exploration and extraction of minerals and petroleum in Australia. It differs substantially from the mining laws of other common law countries, the most important differences arising from the policy decision that [[the Crown]] should own all minerals.

== History of mining law ==
The first Australian mining laws were enacted in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;
A proclamation by [[Charles Augustus FitzRoy|Charles Fitzroy]], [[Governors of New South Wales|Governor of New South Wales]], on 22 May 1851 asserted the Crown's right to all gold discovered in New South Wales. The [[Governors of Victoria|Victorian Governor]] issued a similar proclamation on 16 August 1851. In January 1852, Victoria enacted the Mining Act 1852 (repealed) supplemented by the Mining Act 1853 (repealed).&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, ownership of minerals and petroleum passed to those who were granted title to land by the colonial [[Governors of the Australian states|governors]] according to common law concepts, except the right to "Royal Mines" (the precious metals of gold and silver) which remained vested in [[the Crown]] by virtue of [[Royal prerogative]]. From 1855, colonial parliaments legislated for ownership of minerals to be retained by the Crown in future grants of [[freehold title]]. Thus, the situation developed where throughout Australia, the crown in right of the State owns nearly all the minerals.

== Legislation ==
In relation to minerals situated within state boundaries, first sight, the power to legislate for minerals remains with the states. However, despite the fact that the [[Constitution of Australia]] does not list minerals as an area over which the Federal Parliament has jurisdiction, a number of the Commonwealth Parliament's powers encompass matters relevant to mining operations and any legislation of the Commonwealth based upon these powers will override any inconsistent State legislation. As to Commonwealth jurisdiction over the Territories, the constitutional limitations regarding mining operations conducted within the States have no application in the Northern Territory, or other Australian territories.

Each of the States and Territories has its own legislation regulating the exploration for and production of onshore minerals.&lt;ref&gt;ACT: Land (Planning and Environment) Act 1991; Northern Territory: Mining Act 1980; NSW: Mining Act 1992; Queensland: Mineral Resources Act 1989; South Australia: Mining Act 1971; Tasmania: Mineral Resources Development Act 1995; Victoria: Mineral Resources Development Act 1990; Western Australia: Mining Act 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The Commonwealth has no onshore mining legislation which is applicable in the States or Territories.

As to offshore minerals, the Commonwealth has [[sovereignty]] in respect of the [[territorial sea]], and sovereign rights in respect of both the [[continental shelf]] and the [[exclusive economic zone]] for the purpose of exploitation of their natural resources. Thus, the sovereignty over minerals of the States and the Northern Territory extends only to the low-water mark and it is the Commonwealth which is entitled under international law to exercise sovereignty over minerals under the territorial sea, within the exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf. However, following an agreement negotiated between the Commonwealth Government and the States in 1979, the Commonwealth conferred power on the States and the Northern Territory to make laws for matters including mining operations in respect of the coastal waters and granted them proprietary rights to the seabed.

In addition, the Corporations Act 2001 and the [[Australian Stock Exchange]] Listing Rules contain special provisions governing the conduct and reporting requirements of mining companies.

== Ownership of minerals ==
According to the maxim "[[Cuius est solum eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos|to whomsoever the soil belongs, he owns also to the sky and to the depths]]", there is a presumption that a land owner also owns all minerals on or beneath the surface of that land.&lt;ref&gt;The original maxim is Latin: ''cujus est solum, ejus est usque ad coelum et usque ad inferos''. It was applied in a mining context in ''Commonwealth v New South Wales'' (1923) 33 CLR 1 at 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The presumption is subject to the exception of the Royal metals. As early as the sixteenth century, the [[common law]] has held that all gold and silver, whether situated on public or private land, has been owned by the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;''Case of Mines'' (1567) 1 Plowd 310; 75 ER 472.&lt;/ref&gt; This Royal prerogative has also been applied in Australia, by both common law&lt;ref&gt;''Woolley v A-G (Vic)'' (1877) LR 2 App Cas 163 at 167–8&lt;/ref&gt; and legislation.&lt;ref&gt;(New South Wales) Mining Act 1992 s 379 (gold and silver mines); (Queensland) Mineral Resources Act 1989 s 8 (all minerals); (South Australia) Mining Act 1971 s 16 (all minerals); (Tasmania) Mineral Resources Development Act 1995 s 6(4) (gold, silver, oil, hydrogen, helium and atomic substances); (Victoria) Mineral Resources Development Act 1990 s 9 (most minerals); (Western Australia) Mining Act 1978 s 9 (all precious metal, and all other minerals not alienated from the Crown before 1 January 1899).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the principle of the owner of land owning the minerals within it has been virtually abolished by statute in Australia {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}. The general rule is that the Crown (in right of the State) owns all minerals. This has been implemented by statute; initially by enacting that all future grants of land must contain a reservation to the Crown of all minerals. Now, all new grants of freehold titles in Australia have provided that all minerals were reserved to the Crown.

In respect of titles granted prior to the legislation, the owner of the land retained ownership of the minerals (except the Royal metals of gold and silver). That owner may grant a [[profit à prendre]] to enter and take minerals.

Crown ownership of minerals has been made universal in Victoria&lt;ref&gt;Mineral Resources Development Act 1990 s 9.&lt;/ref&gt; and South Australia&lt;ref&gt;Mining Act 1971 s 16.&lt;/ref&gt; by legislative expropriation of all minerals. In Tasmania&lt;ref&gt;Mineral Resources Development Act 1995 s 6(4).&lt;/ref&gt; and New South Wales,&lt;ref&gt;Coal Acquisition Act 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; this approach of legislative expropriation has been applied on a selective basis (in Tasmania, for gold, silver, oil, hydrogen, helium and atomic substances, and, in New South Wales, for coal). The Crown, pursuant to statute, may grant various leases or licences to enter onto land and take minerals.

State ownership of minerals has had the important result that governments, rather than private landholders, determine the legal regimes governing mineral exploration and production.

== Ratified agreements ==
Large mining operations are likely to be regulated by a ratified agreement, sometimes also called a "state agreement", an "agreement act", a "franchise agreement", a "government agreement" or a "special agreement act". The basis of such an agreement is that the State contracts with the miner in the form of a written agreement which is ratified by a statute of that State or Territory Parliament. This ratification ensures that the provisions of the negotiated agreement have legislative effect and override any inconsistent provisions under the general mining legislation or any other statutes of that State or Territory. Ratified agreements have been used throughout Australia to establish large, export-oriented mining projects since the 1950s.  They have been most extensively used in West Australia, where a high proportion of large mining projects continue to operate under such arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;See Anne M Fitzgerald, "Mining Agreements: Negotiated frameworks in the Australian minerals sector" (2001), at http://eprints.qut.edu.au/34063/&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell owned 80% of the joint venture, and Rogers owned 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellmediapr.ca/olympics/releases/release.asp?id=13117&amp;yyyy=2010|title=Canada's Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium Wins Seven Gemini Awards for Esteemed Coverage of Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games|author=Canada's Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium|date=2010-11-03|accessdate=2011-04-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727114324/http://www.bellmediapr.ca/olympics/releases/release.asp?id=13117&amp;yyyy=2010|archivedate=2011-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The consortium encompassed many of the properties owned by both companies, including Bell Media's [[CTV Television Network]], [[The Sports Network|TSN]], [[Réseau des Sports|RDS]] and [[RDS Info]], and Rogers Media's [[Omni Television]], [[Sportsnet]], [[OLN]], and the Rogers radio stations group. Several other broadcasters will carried consortium coverage, including [[V (TV network)|V]] (formerly TQS), and several channels owned by [[Asian Television Network]]. Finally, dedicated websites in English and French (''ctvolympics.ca'' and ''rdsolympiques.ca'') were set up to stream live coverage over the [[Internet]] to Canadian viewers. The consortium replaced [[CBC Sports]], which had held the Canadian rights to all Olympics beginning with the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 games]], although some cable rights had been sub-licensed to TSN / RDS beginning in 1998.

Rogers announced in September 2011 that it would withdraw from the consortium following London 2012, and therefore not participate in its bid for rights to the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] and [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. The company cited scheduling conflicts and financial considerations for the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2011/08/c9399.html|title=Rogers Media Withdraws from Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium in Bid for 2014/16 Olympic Games|author=[[Rogers Media]]|date=2011-09-08|accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell Media then announced a new partnership with the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] to bid for Canadian [[broadcasting rights]] of Sochi 2014 and Rio 2016. Broadcast details for the joint bid were never released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2011/09/c9855.html|title=Bell Media and CBC/Radio-Canada to Jointly Bid for Sochi 2014 and Rio 2016 Olympic Games|author=[[Bell Media]] and [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=2011-09-09|accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The joint Bell/CBC bid was considered the prohibitive favourite to win the rights when the [[International Olympic Committee]] accepted bids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/bell-media-cbc-partner-for-olympic-bid/article2159515/|title=Bell Media, CBC partner for Olympic bid|first=Susan|last=Krashinsky|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=2011-09-09|accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Bell/CBC bids were rejected by the IOC.

On August 1, 2012, CBC Sports announced that it had made a deal to broadcast the 2014 and 2016 Summer and Winter Olympics, replacing the Bell/Rogers group.&lt;ref name=cbc-returns&gt;{{cite web|title=CBC wins rights to 2014, 2016 Olympic Games|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2012/08/01/cbc-olympics-rights.html|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2013, CBC announced that both Sportsnet and TSN would sub-license broadcast rights to the 2014 Winter Olympics.&lt;ref name=sn-sochi&gt;{{cite web|title=Sportsnet to air 200 hours of Sochi Games|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/olympics/2013/02/07/sportsnet_reaches_olympic_sub_license_deal/|publisher=[[Sportsnet]]|accessdate=8 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213143302/http://www.sportsnet.ca/olympics/2013/02/07/sportsnet_reaches_olympic_sub_license_deal/#|archive-date=2013-02-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cbc-2014coverage&gt;{{cite web|title=CBC/Radio Canada welcomes partners in 2014 Sochi Olympics coverage|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/story/2013/02/07/sp-cbc-sports-sochi-olympics-tv-coverage.html|publisher=CBC|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participating media outlets==

===Television===
*Primary coverage (live coverage of major events, and highlights of all events) was carried on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] (English) and [[V (TV network)|V]] (French).
**As there is no full-time CTV affiliate in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], coverage was simulcast on Bell-owned [[CTV Two Atlantic]], which is available on cable in Newfoundland (in other areas, [[CTV Two]] carried normal programming). During the 2010 Winter Olympics, over-the-air station [[CJON-TV|NTV]] carried only the opening and closing ceremonies, and coverage of the [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Men's tournament|men's hockey gold medal game]].
**V's coverage was produced by RDS&lt;ref name="2010-coverage" /&gt; and mostly used that channel's talent, as V has no in-house production staff for news or sports. Similarly, most hosts for CTV's coverage came from TSN.
**Since V has limited coverage outside Quebec, its coverage of the 2010 games was simulcast on the [[Cable Public Affairs Channel]] (CPAC), which has mandatory carriage on all cable and satellite providers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpac.ca/forms/index.asp?dsp=template&amp;act=view3&amp;section_id=21&amp;template_id=1302&amp;lang=e CPAC and CTV Team Up to Deliver French Olympic Coverage], CPAC / COBMC press release, 2010-02-11&lt;/ref&gt;
*Secondary coverage (full events and some highlights between events) aired primarily on [[The Sports Network|TSN]] and [[Sportsnet]] (English), as well as [[Réseau des sports|RDS]] and [[RDS Info]] (French). Select TSN coverage was rebroadcast later on [[TSN2]]. [[OLN]] (English) also provided full-event coverage of selected outdoor events.
*Multilingual coverage on various [[Omni Television]] stations:
**[[CFMT-DT|Omni.1 (Ontario)]] only: Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Ukrainian
**[[CJMT-DT|Omni.2 (Ontario)]], [[CJEO-DT|Omni Edmonton]], [[CJCO-DT|Omni Calgary]], [[CHNM-DT|Omni British Columbia]]: Cantonese, Mandarin
**Omni BC only: Punjabi
*Multilingual coverage on seven [[Asian Television Network]] channels:
**[[ATN Bangla (Canada)|ATN Bangla]] ([[Bengali language|Bengali]])
**[[ATN Gujarati]] ([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]])
**[[ATN Channel]] ([[Hindi]])
**[[ATN Alpha ETC Punjabi]] and [[ATN MH1]] ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]])
**[[ATN Jaya TV]] ([[Tamil language|Tamil]])
**[[ATN ARY Digital]] ([[Urdu]])
*[[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network|APTN]] provided coverage of the 2010 games in several native languages; including ([[Cree]], [[Dene]], [[Inuktitut]], [[Michif language|Mechif]], [[Mi'kmaq]], [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], [[Ojibwe language|Ojibway]] and [[Oji-Cree]]). In some cases the network was split, with commentary in two or three different languages on the East, West, and North feeds. It also aired some English and French coverage as an overflow channel. APTN did not participate in coverage for the 2012 Summer Olympics.

===Radio===
*English-language radio coverage aired over Rogers's [[Sportsnet Radio|Sportsnet Radio Network]]. Ten Rogers stations, namely "Sportsnet Radio" ([[CJCL]] Toronto and [[CFAC]] Calgary), all-news or news/talk stations ([[CKWX]] Vancouver, [[CFTR (AM)|CFTR]] Toronto, [[CFFR]] Calgary, [[CKGL]] Kitchener, [[CHNI-FM]] Saint John, [[CJNI-FM]] Halifax, and [[CKNI-FM]] Moncton), as well as [[CISQ-FM]] Whistler, were listed as "official" Consortium stations and typically air most if not all coverage. Portions of the coverage aired on other [[Rogers Media]] radio stations, as well as several other stations in non-competing markets (such as CTV-owned [[CKGM]] [[Montreal]]).
*[[French-language]] radio coverage of the 2010 games was aired on Cogeco radio stations, primarily airing on [[CKAC]] Montreal (then an all-sports station). No similar coverage plans were announced for the 2012 games.

===Other affiliated outlets===
*Several other Bell Media-owned channels, such as [[CTV News Channel (Canada)|CTV News Channel]] and [[Discovery Channel (Canada)|Discovery Channel]]) provided ancillary (non-event) coverage related to the games. CTV-owned music channel [[MuchMusic]] broadcast programming live from the Vancouver area throughout the 2010 games, including special editions of ''[[MuchOnDemand]]'' broadcast from Whistler.
*''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', a national newspaper which was owned by CTVglobemedia at the time of the Vancouver games (and is currently 15% owned by Bell Media's parent company), was listed as part of the consortium and supplied content for its websites, however its sponsorship/coverage of the games is independent of the broadcast rights.

==History==

===Early coverage===
{{Split section|discuss=Talk:Canada's Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium#Olympics on CTV before Vancouver games|date=March 2018}}
CTV has previously broadcast the Summer Games in [[1976 Summer Games|1976]] (along with CBC) and [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], and the Winter Games in [[1964 Winter Olympics|1964]], [[1968 Winter Olympics|1968]], [[1972 Winter Olympics|1972]], [[1976 Winter Olympics|1976]], [[1980 Winter Olympics|1980]], [[1984 Winter Olympics|1984]], [[1988 Winter Olympics|1988]] and [[1994 Winter Olympics|1994]].

The 1980 "[[Miracle on Ice]]" game was aired live on CTV in Canada, but not [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]] in the United States. Thus, American viewers who resided in or near the Canada–US border and received the CTV signal could watch the game live, but the rest of the United States had to wait for a delayed rebroadcast.

====Rights fees====
In 1974, [[Johnny Esaw]] (who anchored CTV's prime time Olympic coverage from 1964–1980) became vice-president of CTV Sports, a position he would hold until his retirement in 1990. He negotiated the host broadcasting rights to the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary, Alberta]]. As the main host broadcaster for the 1988 Winter Olympics, the CTV television network paid $45&amp;nbsp;million for domestic rights to the 1988 Winter Olympics. Esaw also brought the [[1964 Winter Olympics]] to CTV.

Production of the broadcasting for the 1994 Winter Olympics in [[Lillehammer, Norway]], which costs NOK&amp;nbsp;462&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;LOOC (I): 30&lt;/ref&gt; was the responsibility of the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] (NRK), with assistance from CTV and the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU).&lt;ref&gt;LOOC (II): 206&lt;/ref&gt; NRK had 1,424 people working at the Olympics, while international broadcasters sent an additional 4,050 accredited broadcasting personnel. The transmission rights for the games were held by EBU in Europe, [[Olympics on CBS|CBS]] in the United States, [[NHK]] in Japan, CTV in Canada, the [[Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union]], [[Nine Network]] in Australia, as well as other broadcasters in other countries. The total transmission rights price was 350 million United States dollars.&lt;ref&gt;LOOC (II): 205&lt;/ref&gt;

====Commentators====
*[[Rod Black]] anchored CTV's coverage of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona, Spain]] and [[1994 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lillehammer, Norway]].
*[[Don Chevrier]] provided [[television network]] coverage of the [[Olympic Games]] for North American audiences since 1972, working for the CBC, the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC), and the [[CTV Television Network]] before moving on to NBC. More recently, he covered events at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], including [[badminton]], [[table tennis]], and [[synchronized swimming]] for NBC, and, along with longtime partner, [[Don Duguid]], called curling at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]] and in the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]] for NBC.
*[[Rob Faulds]] worked on CTV's coverage of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona, Spain]] and the [[1994 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lillehammer, Norway]].

==Other rights==

===Paralympic Games===
The consortium also owned rights to the corresponding [[Paralympic Games]], namely the [[2010 Winter Paralympics]] and the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]].

Coverage for the 2010 games consisted primarily of coverage of the opening ceremonies (live on [[CIVT-TV|CTV British Columbia]], and on tape delay on the rest of the CTV network and RIS); daily highlights packages split among CTV, TSN and Sportsnet in English (and RDS / RIS in French); and live coverage of all [[Ice sledge hockey at the 2010 Winter Paralympics|sledge hockey]] games featuring the Canadian team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctvmedia.ca/olympics/releases/release.asp?id=12356&amp;yyyy=2010 Canada's Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium Reveals Broadcast Plans for Vancouver 2010 Paralympic Winter Games, March 12-21] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314053351/http://www.ctvmedia.ca/olympics/releases/release.asp?id=12356&amp;yyyy=2010# |date=2010-03-14 }}, COBMC press release, 2010-03-08&lt;/ref&gt; Although not originally scheduled, CTV and RDS later added live coverage of the closing ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvmedia.ca/olympics/releases/release.asp?id=12390&amp;yyyy=2010 |title=Closing Ceremony of 2010 Paralympic Winter Games To Air Live on CTV and RDS, This Sunday |publisher=Canada's Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium (press release) |date=2010-03-16 |accessdate=2010-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719081607/http://www.ctvmedia.ca/olympics/releases/release.asp?id=12390&amp;yyyy=2010 |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coverage for the 2012 games offered no live television coverage and consisted primarily of 10 late night highlight shows carried on [[TSN2]], [[Sportsnet One]], and [[RDS2]], though rebroadcasts of the opening ceremony were carried on both CTV and Rogers-owned broadcast network [[Citytv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.ca/en/London-2012/London-2012-News/Follow-Your-Team-Canadian-Paralympic-Committee-Announces-Complete-Broadcast-Schedule-of-2012-Paralympic-Games-Coverage.html|title=FOLLOW YOUR TEAM: CANADIAN PARALYMPIC COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES COMPLETE BROADCAST SCHEDULE OF 2012 PARALYMPIC GAMES COVERAGE|author=[[Canadian Paralympic Committee]]|date=2012-08-23|accessdate=2012-08-31|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130115115916/http://www.paralympic.ca/en/London-2012/London-2012-News/Follow-Your-Team-Canadian-Paralympic-Committee-Announces-Complete-Broadcast-Schedule-of-2012-Paralympic-Games-Coverage.html#|archive-date=2013-01-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.citytv.com/schedule/toronto/day/?date=2012-08-31|title=Citytv Toronto Program Schedule – August 31, 2012|accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CDNParalympics/status/241634267367620610|title=Tweet from the Canadian Paralympic Committee|work=[[Twitter]]|date=2012-08-31|accessdate=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of Paralympic Games coverage====

=====2010 Winter Paralympics opening and closing ceremonies=====
Originally, CTV did not plan to air the [[2010 Winter Paralympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] live. After receiving criticism on the decision, CTV changed its mind and decided to air the ceremony live in Vancouver region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportscastermagazine.ca/on-air/ctv-vancouver-to-air-paralympic-opening-ceremonies/1000363892/ |title=CTV Vancouver To Air Paralympic Opening Ceremonies |publisher=The Sports Broadcasting Magazine |date=March 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; CTV originally continued to stick to its initial plan of not airing the [[2010 Winter Paralympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]] live. This decision led to more complaints and CTV relented by airing the closing ceremony live across Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.straight.com/article-298096/vancouver/ctv-decides-broadcast-paralympic-closing-ceremony-live |title=CTV decides to broadcast Paralympic closing ceremony live |publisher=The Georgia Straight |date=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====2012 Summer Paralympics=====
Despite the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] being a breakthrough games for international media coverage, giving a significant boost to the overall audience shares of British broadcaster [[Channel 4]] and Australia's [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaweek.co.uk/News/MostEmailed/1148995/Paralympics-coverage-changed-disability-perceptions-says-C4/ | title=Paralympics coverage changed disability perceptions, says C4|author=Media Week|date=2012-09-10|accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/media/paralympics-a-ratings-winner-for-abc/story-e6frg996-1226472161772 | title=Paralympics a ratings winner for ABC|author=[[The Australian]]|date=2012-09-12|accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; no Paralympics sports events were shown live on television in Canada or the United States. 
"Based on the level of overall coverage, it's clear that Canadian broadcasters do not deem disability to be important. They are not supporters of inclusion", SCI BC ([[BC Paraplegic Association]]) Executive Director Chris McBride said, contrasting Canada's coverage with Britain's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sci-bc.ca/news/put-the-paralympics-on-tv/ | title=Put the Paralympics on TV!|author=SCI BC|date=2012-09-18|accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 1,000 people signed a petition calling for Canadian broadcasters to provide full Paralympics coverage at future Games. [[International Paralympic Committee]] President [[Philip Craven]] criticised North American broadcasters for having fallen behind&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/paralympic-sport/9509190/NBC-criticised-Paralympics-after-opening-ceremony-blackout.html/ | title=NBC criticised Paralympics after opening ceremony blackout|author=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2012-08-30|accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said in future the International Paralympic Committee would scrutinize broadcast partners more carefully. "If the values fit, we've got a chance. If they don't we'll go somewhere else", he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19544410/ | title=Extra scrutiny for Paralympic TV deals|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2012-09-10|accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth Olympics===
Finally, the consortium owned broadcast rights to the first [[Youth Olympic Games]], the [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics]] in [[Singapore]]. Coverage of those games was limited to a one-hour daily highlights package on [[Sportsnet]] and [[TSN2]] (rebroadcast several weeks later on TSN).

The '''center of government''' (CoG) is the institution or group of institutions that provide direct support to the chief executive (president or prime minister) in leading the management of government.&lt;ref name=CoGP&gt;
{{cite web
  |title=Center of Government Project
  |publisher=Inter-American Development Bank
  |url=http://www.iadb.org/en/topics/government/strengthening-the-center-of-government-cog,9091.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike line ministries and other government agencies, the CoG does not deliver services directly to the citizens, and it does not focus on a specific policy area.&lt;ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Two types of CoG definition exist: by structure or by function.&lt;ref name=IADB-Role&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first type, the defining criterion is the position in the structure of the Executive branch. It only includes institutions and units that directly and exclusively support the head of the government. For example, it refers to Ministries or General-Secretariats of the Presidency, Offices of the President or Prime Minister, and Cabinet Offices.

In the functional definitions, the defining criterion is that the institution performs whole-of-government functions, especially in terms of planning, coordination, monitoring, political management, and communications. Therefore, in addition to the previously mentioned institutions (such as Ministries of the Presidency), other institutions performing these tasks are also included, even if they are not part of the structure of the Presidency. For example, Ministries or Offices of Planning, [[:en:Prime Minister's Delivery Unit|Delivery Units]], Inter-Ministerial Committees, and even Budget Offices are considered part of the CoG.

A number of authors favor functional definitions, for considering them more applicable to countries with different forms of government and institutional frameworks.&lt;ref name="Core Executive Studies in Britain"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IADB-Strength&gt;

Chief Executives (Presidents and Prime Ministers) have had supporting institutions for a long time. In the United Kingdom, the [[:en:Cabinet Office|Cabinet Office]] dates to 1916, when the war demanded a stronger central coordination for the government.&lt;ref&gt;

However, a number of factors lead to a greater importance of the CoG. The following factors have been highlighted: the cross-cutting nature of several current public problems,&lt;ref&gt;

Moreover, new institutional developments have generated increased interest in the CoG. The [[:en:Prime Minister's Delivery Unit|Prime Minister's Delivery Unit]] in the United Kingdom was established to ensure that the government's priorities were being implemented, through an intensive monitoring by the CoG.

The relationship between '''[[Christianity]] and [[animal rights]]''' has been a complex one that's varied greatly depending on the historical context, with different Christian communities in different nations coming to very different conclusions. The matter is closely related to, but still distinct from and broader than, efforts by [[Christian vegetarians]] as well as [[Christian environmentalists]]. Majority viewpoints in many nations have held that animals must be treated humanely beyond mere [[inanimate]] objects, yet the details of how exactly to do so have remained under dispute.

Many Christian [[philosophers]] and socio-political figures have stated that individuals should follow the example of [[Jesus]] and treat animals in a way that expresses both [[compassion]] as well demonstrates the respectful stewardship of [[Human|humanity]] over the [[Natural environment|environment]]. [[William Wilberforce]], a co-founder of the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]], is an example. Large organizations in which a variety of different groups work together, such as the [[Humane Society of the United States]], have undergone religious outreach using such arguments.&lt;ref name=Scholars/&gt;

Animal rights activists such as Peter Singer have argued that some Christians in the past and present have been either neglectful or dismissive of the causes for animal rights. Others however, have noted that it would be wrong to see Christianity as an enemy on this since Christian theology, like all other religious traditions, has some unique insights to viewing animal life as having fundamental value.&lt;ref name=Satya/&gt; Various church founders have recommended vegetarianism, such as [[William Cowherd]] from the [[Bible Christian Church (vegetarian)|Bible Christian Church]] and [[Ellen G.

London: I. B. Tauris pp.&amp;nbsp;30–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian denominations like Seventh Day Adventists have central vegetarian doctrines incorporated.&lt;ref name="advent" /&gt; John Wesley, the founder of [[Methodism]] also recommended vegetarianism and helped establish the American Vegetarian Society in 1850.&lt;ref name="Veg hand" /&gt; 

The rise of Christianity put an end to animal sacrificing.&lt;ref name="DeMello2012" /&gt; And references to peaceful co-existence of creatures such as lambs and wolves in the world to come are found in the Bible.&lt;ref name="Souls" /&gt;    

==Background and details==

===Biblical context===
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}

[[Image:Isaiah scroll.PNG|thumb|250px|right|This image shows the [[Book of Isaiah]], written in its original [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], on a scroll.]]

The role of animals in the [[Bible]] states that any questions of the relationships between animals and people, is a complex one. As remarked by Christian writer Jack Zavada, "Most interpreters of the Bible assume that man’s likeness to God and animals’ subservience to man implies that animals may have the 'breath of life', ''nephesh chay'' in Hebrew, but not an immortal soul in the same sense as man’s."

The book of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] describes humanity as being made in God's image as well as being given general dominion over the other beings of [[Earth|the earth]]. No mention is made of [[Adam and Eve]] consuming animal flesh, nor of them in any way harming animals through ill treatment.&lt;ref name=Souls&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christianity.about.com/od/whatdoesthebiblesay/f/animalsinheaven.htm|title=Do Animals Have Souls?|publisher=[[About.com]]|first=Jack|last=Zavada|accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creatures co-exist in a relationship sense rather than an exploitative one.&lt;ref name=Satya/&gt;

A variety of passages have been cited in support for caring about animal welfare in the broad sense, an example being how [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs 12:10]] states that a "righteous man cares about his animal's health."

More specifically, [[meat-eating]] and other forms of using some animals for human benefit receive an explicit approval by [[God]] in the aftermath of the events from the expulsion from [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] to the end of the [[Genesis flood narrative|global flood]]. A [[Book of Genesis|Genesis 9:3]] (NIV) section states: "Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything."&lt;ref name=Souls/&gt;

The traditional [[Bible|biblical]] (especially [[Old Testament]]) viewpoint among [[Jews]] and Christians is that God distinguished man from animals, and gave man control over animals to benefit man, but also that God gave man moral guidelines to prevent cruelty to - or needless suffering by - animals.

In particular, [[animal sacrifice]] plays a major role in many sections of the Bible, reflective of [[Ritual slaughter#Jewish and Islamic ritual slaughter|the practice's widespread nature]] in early [[Judaism]]. Specific instances include [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus 1:2]] (NIV): "Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'When any of you brings an offering to the Lord, bring as your offering an animal from either the herd or the flock.'"&lt;ref name=Souls/&gt; A consensus viewpoint doesn't exist as to the exact meaning and reasoning behind said sacrifices, even if they have been interpreted as perhaps symbolizing the returning to God the sense of the 'power over life' in reverential tribute to how God served as the maker of creation to begin with. As remarked by theologian [[Andrew Linzey|Rev. Dr. Andrew Linzey]], "there’s no one view of animal sacrifices even by those who practiced it."&lt;ref name=Satya/&gt;

In terms of the [[afterlife]] and the world to come, descriptions of [[heaven]] describe an existence without violence and strife either among non-human animals or in their relationship to people. For example, [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah 65:25]] (NIV) states: "The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, but dust will be the serpent’s food. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain, says the Lord."&lt;ref name=Souls/&gt; The depiction of how God's ideal new earth will look like can be interpreted as a signal that human beings should minimize violence as much as possible in terms of all animals.&lt;ref name=Satya/&gt;

[[Jesus Christ]] in the [[New Testament]] exists not just as the core theological figure in Christian thought but also as a moral icon to look to as an inspiration in terms of [[Christian ethics]]. Looking at the canonical [[gospels]], Jesus did not directly identify being a vegetarian and did not act like one.&lt;ref name=Satya/&gt; Biblical passages associate Jesus and his followers with [[fishing]], which could be an implied support for meat-eating (at least of that type) specifically.&lt;ref name=Scholars/&gt; In the larger context of animal rights, though, the association of Jesus as a '[[good shepherd]]' character, one taking things so far that "the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep", establishes a moral theme of those that are stronger and more powerful being willing to sacrifice for the weaker and less powerful, all out of love. This can be taken as inspiration for animal welfare advocacy by modern Christians.&lt;ref name=Satya/&gt;

The rise of Christianity ended animal sacrifice, as Christians believe Jesus died for all the sins of humanity and is often portrayed as the last sacrificial lamb in the New Testament.&lt;ref name="DeMello2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=DeMello|first=Margo|title=Animals and Society: An Introduction to Human-Animal Studies|date=18 September 2012|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231526760|page=317|quote=Later, with the rise of Christianity, animal sacrifice ended. Instead, Christians believe that God sacrificed his son Jesus in order to give humankind salvation; this is one of the reasons that Jesus is often represented as a lamb in Christianity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian perspectives===

{{see also|Christian culture|Christian ethics}}

Various church founders have recommended vegetarianism, such as [[William Cowherd]] from the [[Bible Christian Church (vegetarian)|Bible Christian Church]] and [[Ellen G. White]] from the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]].&lt;ref name=desc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivu.org/history/thesis/bible-christian.html|title=The Bible Christian Church|publisher=International Vegetarian Union|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vegetarian America: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0AiAz62C_jcC&amp;pg=PA97 |page=97|author=Karen Iacobbo|author2=Michael Iacobbo|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cowherd, who founded the Bible Christian Church in 1809, helped to establish the world's first [[Vegetarian Society]] in 1847.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=827|title=History of Vegetarianism - Early Ideas|publisher=The Vegetarian Society|accessdate=2008-07-08}}; Gregory, James (2007) ''Of Victorians and Vegetarians''. London: I. B.

Some Christians denominations such as the Seventh Day Adventists have central vegetarian doctrines that play a role in adherents.&lt;ref name="advent"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grant|first1=George|last2=Montenegro|first2=Jose|title=Vegetarianism in Seventh-day Adventism|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199362202.001.0001/acprof-9780199362202-chapter-5|website=Oxford Scholarship Online|publisher=Oxoford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Leo Tolstoy 1897, black and white, 37767u.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Leo Tolstoy]], a [[Russian people|Russian]] novelist regarded as one of the greatest writers of all time, has strongly influenced debates on Christian moral thinking, including towards animals.]]

The tradition of [[Christian vegetarianism]] has long been a minority viewpoint among Christian communities, though its history has gone back many decades in religious thought. [[Leo Tolstoy]]’s views, as expressed in things such as his famous 1909 essay about a [[slaughterhouse]], have remained influential for years. Later writers that cite his comments on animal rights include Catholic columnist [[Mary Eberstadt]].&lt;ref name=Scholars/&gt;

The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] takes the position that Christians are called to express kindness to the world's creatures in general, and people possess a [[Morality|moral obligation]] to avoid causing unnecessary suffering to animals. [[Meat-eating]] in the context of nourishment is permitted. Examples of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] figures that have written in favor of animal rights and against [[factory farming]], though not strictly being [[vegetarian]]s themselves, include [[Fordham University]] professor Charles Camosy and the aforementioned columnist Mary Eberstadt. The former wrote the work ''For Love of Animals: Christian Ethics, Consistent Action'' on the subject, which the latter praised while writing for ''[[National Review]]''.&lt;ref name=Scholars/&gt;

Opinions within the [[Church of England]] have drawn influence from the work of seminal Anglican theologian [[Andrew Linzey]], who published ''Animal Rights: A Christian Assessment'' in 1976 while still a student. Labeled by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as having "caused a sensation in Christian circles" from his first book on,&lt;ref name=Scholars/&gt; he's a member of the faculty at the [[University of Oxford]] as well as the founder and director of the [[Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics]], an independent academic organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordanimalethics.com/who-we-are/director/|title=Director - Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics|website=www.oxfordanimalethics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, [[Anglican]] figures arguing in support of taking a stance against animal cruelty succeeded in having forty-one [[bishops]] signing a pledge not to [[Fur clothing|wear fur]] because of the suffering inflicted, with the pledge getting some attention. However, the debate undertaken by the [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]] in 1990 about both [[hunting]] and factory farming practices done on Church-owned land ended with said practices being allowed to go on.&lt;ref name=Satya&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''Satya''|url=http://www.satyamag.com/feb96/linzey.html|date=February 1996|title=Christianity and Animals: An Interview with Andrew Linzey|first=Rynn|last=Berry|accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the [[Methodism|Methodist tradition]], figures such as [[University of Chester]] professor and author David Clough have held a respect for the rights of animals should exist given that, in Christian terms, God deliberately created the creatures of the world and proclaimed them all as good. He's written that how non-humans are "reconciled to God in Jesus Christ and will be redeemed by God in the new creation" accordingly creates duties for mankind. Besides serving as a Methodist pastor, he's President of the Society for the Study of Christian [[Ethics]].&lt;ref name=Scholars&gt;{{cite news|date=December 6, 2013|accessdate=October 6, 2015|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/us/exploring-christian-perspectives-on-animal-rights.html|title=Scholars Explore Christian Perspectives on Animal Rights|first=Mark|last=Oppenheimer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clough&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chester.ac.uk/departments/trs/staff/clough|title=Professor David Clough|publisher=[[University of Chester]]|accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bands often labeled as being [[Christian metal]] or influenced by [[Christian music]] such as [[Blessthefall]], [[MyChildren MyBride]], [[Gwen Stacy (band)|Gwen Stacy]], and [[Sleeping Giant (band)|Sleeping Giant]] have had members speak out in favor of animal rights, with those statements garnering attention from secular music-related publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smnnews.com/2010/02/05/christian-metal-bands-talk-animal-rights/|title=Christian Metal Bands Talk Animal Rights|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secular responses and additional debate==
[[File:Peter_Singer_MIT_Veritas.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Philosopher [[Peter Singer]] is pictured here at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT's campus]] speaking in 2009.]]

{{expand section|date=October 2015}}
Philosopher [[Peter Singer]] has argued in publications such as his seminal book ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'', first published in 1975, that Christian thought has contributed to animal cruelty and suffering. He's cited commentary from figures such as [[Aquinas]] about humanity's innate right to control the natural world as holding back progress in animal rights. However, Singer later stated that he had changed his views in part given the complexity of different views towards animals among different Christians.&lt;ref name=Scholars/&gt;

The aforementioned Rev. Dr. Andrew Linzey commented in 1996 that:
{{quote|[I]t’s right for animal rights people to be critical and judgmental of the Christian tradition... [which] has been amazingly callous towards animals. Christian theologians have been neglectful and dismissive of the cause of animals— and many still are. Christians and Jews have allowed their ancient texts— such as Genesis— to be read as licensing tyranny over animals... [and] animal rights people sometimes look on Christianity as though it was unambiguously "the enemy." I think it is wrong to write off Christianity in this way. All religious traditions have great resources for a very positive ethic in relation to animals. I would go further and say that however awful the record of Christianity has been, Christian theology has some unique insights fundamental to valuing animal life. From my perspective, without a sense of ultimate meaning and purpose, it is difficult, if not impossible, to justify any kind of moral endeavor... I’m one of those people who believe that morality really depends upon vision.&lt;ref name=Satya/&gt;}}

Contemporary philosopher [[Bernard Rollin]] writes that "''dominion'' does not entail or allow abuse any more than does dominion a parent enjoys over a child."&lt;ref name="Rollin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rollin|first=Bernard E.|title=Animal Rights and Human Morality|publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|isbn=978-1-61592-211-6|page=117}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rollin further states that the [[Biblical Sabbath]] requirement promulgated in the [[Ten Commandments]] "required that animals be granted a day of rest along with humans. Correlatively, the Bible forbids 'plowing with an ox and an ass together' (Deut. 22:10–11). According to the rabbinical tradition, this prohibition stems from the hardship that an ass would suffer by being compelled to keep up with an ox, which is, of course, far more powerful. Similarly, one finds the prohibition against 'muzzling an ox when it treads out the grain' (Deut. 25:4–5), and even an environmental prohibition against destroying trees when besieging a city (Deut. 20:19–20). These ancient regulations, "bespeak of an eloquent awareness of the status of animals as ends in themselves", a point also corroborated by [[Norm Phelps]].&lt;ref name="Rollin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phelps2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Phelps|first=Norm|title=Animal Rights According to the Bible|year=2002|publisher=Lantern Books|isbn=978-1-59056-009-9|page=70|quote=The Bible's most important reference to the sentience and will of nonhuman animals is found in Deuteronomy 25:4, which became the scriptural foundation of the rabbinical doctrine of ''tsar ba'ale chayim'', "the suffering of the living," which makes relieving the suffering of animals a religious duty for Jews. "You shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing." The point of muzzling the ox was to keep him from eating any of the grain that he was threshing. The point of the commandment was the cruelty of forcing an animal to work for hours at a time with his face only inches from delicious food while not allowing him to eat any of it.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cooper v. Oklahoma''''', 517 U.S. 348 (1996),&lt;ref name=opinion&gt;{{ussc|name=Cooper v. Oklahoma|volume=517|page=348|year=1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court reversed an [[Oklahoma]] court decision holding that a [[defendant]] is presumed to be [[Competency evaluation (law)|competent to stand trial]] unless he proves otherwise by the second highest legal [[Legal burden of proof|standard of proof]], that of [[clear and convincing evidence]], ruling that to be [[unconstitutional]]. The court said the defendant's [[Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Fourteenth Amendment]] rights to [[due process]] were violated.&lt;ref name=oyez&gt;{{Bluebook website|first= |last= |title=Cooper v. Oklahoma |publisher=[[OYEZ Project]] |url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1995/95-5207 |access-date=August 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, the defendant's ability to understand the [[Indictment|charge]]s against him and his ability to assist in his own [[Defense (legal)|defense]] was challenged on five separate occasions before and during his [[trial]] and [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] for [[capital murder]], but the trial judge ruled he was competent to stand trial because he did not meet Oklahoma's high standard of proof.&lt;ref name=opinion/&gt;

==Circumstances==
Byron Keith Cooper was charged in 1989 with the [[murder]] of an 86-year-old man while in the course of committing [[burglary]]. Both before and during his trial, the question of his [[Competency evaluation (law)|competency to stand trial]] was raised five times. The first time the question arose, the trial judge relied on the opinion of a state [[psychologist]] in determining to [[involuntary commitment|commit]] the defendant to a state [[psychiatric hospital]] for three months of treatment. Upon Cooper's return, the trial judge heard [[testimony]] from two state psychologists regarding Cooper's competence, but as these [[expert witness|experts]] disagreed over whether Cooper was competent to stand trial, the judge decided to rule against Cooper and ordered the trial to proceed. After the pretrial hearing was completed, the [[defense attorney]] raised the issue of Cooper's competence a third time, telling the court that Cooper's behavior was "odd" and that he refused to communicate with his attorney. The attorney said that it could be a serious matter "if he's not [[malingering|faking]]".  However, the judge declined to review his earlier decision that Cooper was competent to proceed.&lt;ref name=opinion/&gt;

On the first day of trial, Cooper's bizarre behavior (such as fleeing from his defense attorney, refusing to change his [[prison]] clothes because regular clothes "burned" him, and talking to himself while in the [[fetal position]]) induced the court to conduct a further competency hearing. This time the trial judge observed Cooper and heard testimony from people including lay [[witness]]es, defendant Cooper, and a third psychologist who concluded that Cooper was incompetent. While expressing his uncertainty and not disagreeing with the psychologist, the judge ruled against Cooper and ordered the trial to proceed, finally opining:
{{quotation|I think it's going to take smarter people than me to make a decision  here. I'm going to say that I don't believe he has carried the burden by  clear and convincing evidence of his incompetency and I'm going to say  we're going to go to trial.&lt;ref&gt;''Cooper'', 517 U.S. at 352.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The trial proceeded with Cooper continuing to act in a bizarre manner and refusing to be near his attorney. Cooper was [[convicted]] of [[first degree murder]], and during the sentencing phase of the trial the history of Cooper's [[child abuse|childhood abuse]] was recounted. Finally the defense attorney pleaded for either a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]] or further evaluation into Cooper's competence, describing Cooper's courtroom behavior:
{{quotation|Without looking for his safety at all and looking what's behind him, when I moved the least bit [toward him] he fell to get away from me. He fell. He hit his head. The thud on that [[marble]] when he jackknifed backward off of that railing into that marble could be heard at the back of that courtroom. . . .  he's just busted his head, tears are streaming down his eyes and he does not respond in any normal fashion.&lt;ref&gt;''Cooper'', 517 U.S. at 351 n.1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The court [[Summary judgment|summarily denied]] the motion. Cooper received the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]] after the jury recommended death.&lt;ref name=opinion/&gt;

Cooper appealed, and the [[Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals]] affirmed both the conviction and the sentence. Cooper appealed to the Supreme Court on a [[writ]] of [[certiorari]].

==Decision==
In a unanimous verdict, the Supreme Court reversed the judgment and remanded the case back to  the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals for further consideration in light of their opinion. The Court held that the State may not proceed with a criminal trial when the defendant has demonstrated that he is more likely than not to be incompetent. Requiring a higher standard of proof, that of "[[Clear and convincing evidence#Clear and convincing evidence|clear and convincing evidence]]", was too high a [[Legal burden of proof|standard of proof]] for a defendant to demonstrate a need for a [[competency evaluation (law)|competency evaluation]], increasing the possibility of error to a level "incompatible with the dictates of [[due process]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Cooper'', 517 U.S. at 368-69.&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal defendants must be allowed to avoid trial if they prove incompetence by a "preponderance of the evidence."&lt;ref name=oyez/&gt;

The court used the relevant history of [[common law]] regarding competency and the treatment of the insane and also compared Oklahoma's standards with the contemporary practices  of other states, finding that only 4 of the 50 states used Oklahoma's heightened standard of proof.&lt;ref&gt;''Cooper'', 517 U.S. at 360-61.&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that this "demonstrates that the vast majority of jurisdictions remain persuaded that the heightened standard of proof imposed on the accused in Oklahoma is not necessary to vindicate the State's interest in prompt and orderly disposition of criminal cases."&lt;ref&gt;''Cooper'', 517 U.S. at 360.&lt;/ref&gt; The court found most states uses a burden of proof far lower, or imposed no burden of proof at all, once the competency question is raised.&lt;ref&gt;''Cooper'', 517 U.S. at 361-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The American Academy for Psychiatry and the Law unofficially considers this decision a [[landmark case]] in [[Competency evaluation (law)|competency to stand trial]] [[case law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website|first= |last= |title=Landmark Case List |publisher=American Academy for Psychiatry and the Law |url=https://www.aapl.org/landmark_list.htm |date=2014 |access-date=August 8, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court stated that no one questions the [[fundamental right]] of competency to stand trial. As established in ''[[Dusky v. United States]]'', a defendant has a fundamental right not to be put to trial unless he has "sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding  . . . [and] a [[Rationality|rational]] as well as [[fact]]ual understanding of the proceedings against him." A State may not proceed with a criminal trial after the defendant has demonstrated that he is more likely than not to be incompetent.&lt;ref name=opinion/&gt;

[[File:Charlie McCreevy portrait.jpg|thumb|'''Finance Min. [[Charlie McCreevy]]''' Reduced Irish corporate tax from 32% to 12.5% in the 1999 Finance Act, and whose 1997 Tax and Consolidation Act, laid the framework for Ireland's [[BEPS]] tax tools, the world's largest.&lt;ref name="zux"/&gt;]]

'''Ireland's Corporate Tax System''' is a central component of Ireland's economy.  In 2016–17, foreign firms paid 80% of Irish corporate tax, employed 25% of the Irish labour force (paid 50% of Irish salary tax), and created 57% of Irish OECD non-farm value-add.  U.S.–controlled firms represent almost all foreign firms in Ireland and in 2017 were 25 of the top 50 Irish firms, and 70% of the revenue of the top 50 Irish firms ({{slink|#Low tax economy}}).  By 2018, Ireland had received the most U.S. {{slink|#Corporate tax inversions}} in history, and Apple was over one–fifth of Irish GDP. Academics rank Ireland as the largest [[tax haven]]; larger than the Caribbean tax haven system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/ireland/ireland-named-as-world-s-biggest-tax-haven-8tx2ngcgj|title=Ireland named as world’s biggest tax haven|publisher=The Times U.K.|date=14 June 2018|quote=Research conducted by academics at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Copenhagen estimated that foreign multinationals moved €90 billion of profits to Ireland in 2015 — more than all Caribbean countries combined.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apple logo black.svg|thumb|'''[[Apple Inc.|Apple (Ireland)]]''' Ireland's largest company, and over one-fifth of Irish GDP, whose [[Investigation of Apple's transfer pricing arrangements with Ireland|2016 EU €13 billion fine]] on their [[Double Irish]] BEPS scheme is the largest tax fine in history.&lt;ref name="taxf"/&gt;]]

Ireland's "headline" corporation tax rate is 12.5%, however, foreign multinationals pay an {{slink|#Effective tax rate (ETR)}} of under 4% on global profits "shifted" to Ireland, via Ireland's global network of bilateral [[tax treaties]].  These lower effective tax rates are achieved by a complex set of Irish [[base erosion and profit shifting]] ("BEPS") tools which handle the largest BEPS flows in the world (e.g. the '''[[Double Irish]]''' as used by Google and Facebook, the '''[[double Irish arrangement#Replacement by single malt|Single Malt]]''' as used by Microsoft and Allergan, and '''[[double Irish arrangement#CAIA|Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets]]''' as used by Accenture, and by Apple post Q1 2015).&lt;ref name="zux"/&gt;

Ireland's main {{slink|#Multinational tax schemes}} use "[[intellectual property]]" ("IP") accounting to affect the [[BEPS]] movement, which is why almost all foreign multinationals in Ireland are from the industries with substantial IP, namely technology and life sciences.  Multinationals from jurisdictions with "territorial tax" systems (i.e. almost all OECD countries), make little use of tax havens, thus, almost most foreign multinationals in Ireland date from periods when their home tax system was a "worldwide tax" system (e.g. UK pre–2009, and U.S. pre–2018); and is why there are no non–U.S./non–UK multinationals in Ireland's top 50 firms.

[[File:Ireland Trade Good Discrepancy (1995-2017).png|thumb|'''[[Apple Inc.|Apple (Ireland)]]''' The Q1 2015 restructuring of Apple's non-U.S. IP to Ireland ([[leprechaun economics]]), is the largest [[BEPS]] action in history.&lt;br&gt;[[Brad Setser]] &amp; Cole Frank ([[Council on Foreign Relations|CoFR]]).&lt;ref name="cofr"/&gt;]]

As with all [[tax havens]], Ireland's GDP is artificially inflated by BEPS accounting flows.  This distortion escalated in Q1 2015 when Apple executed the largest BEPS transaction in history, on-shoring $300 billion of non–U.S. IP to Ireland (called "[[leprechaun economics]]").  It forced the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] to abandon GDP in 2017, and replace with [[modified gross national income]] (GNI*), which removes part, but not all, of the distortions by BEPS tools.  Irish GDP was 162% of Irish GNI* in 2017.{{efn|name="gnigdp"|In contrast, EU–28 2017 GDP was 100% of EU–28 2017 GNI).&lt;ref name="eurostat2"/&gt;}} 

[[File:Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers Figure 3 Network of ownership flows between countries.jpg|thumb|'''[[Corporate tax haven]]''': Ireland is ranked as one of the largest global [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|Conduit OFCs]] in terms of connections to tax havens,&lt;ref name="xx1"/&gt; the largest global [[Tax haven#Tax haven lists|Tax Haven]] in terms of quantum of profits shielded,&lt;ref name="gbz"/&gt; and the 3rd-largest global [[Offshore financial centre#Shadow banking|Shadow Banking OFC]].&lt;ref name="FSF1"/&gt;]]

Ireland's corporation tax regime is integrated with Ireland's [[International Financial Services Centre|IFSC]] tax schemes (e.g. [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)|Section 110 SPVs]] and [[Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF)|QIAIFs]]), which offer traditional [[tax haven]]-type tools to give confidential routes out of the Irish corporate tax system to Ireland's favoured [[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Sink OFC|Sink OFC]], Luxembourg, which is 50% of all outbound Irish FDI.&lt;ref name="luxx"/&gt;  This functionality has made Ireland one of the largest global [[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Conduit OFC|Conduit OFCs]], and the third largest global [[Offshore financial centre#Shadow banking|Shadow Banking OFC]].&lt;ref name="FSF1"/&gt; Irish privacy and data protection laws hide Irish tax tools from public scrutiny.  There is evidence Ireland behaves like a "[[Ireland as a tax haven#Captured state|captured state]]", fostering tax avoidance schemes.  Ireland is labelled a {{slink|#Corporate tax haven}}.

As {{slink|#Countermeasures to Ireland}}, the U.S. [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] (TCJA) moves the U.S to a "territorial tax" system.  The TJCA's GILTI–FDII–BEAT tax regime has seen U.S. IP–heavy multinationals (e.g. Pfizer), forecast 2019 effective tax rates that are similar to those of prior U.S. [[#Corporate tax inversions|tax inversions]] to Ireland (e.g.  Medtronic).  Ireland's corporate tax regime is also threatened by the EU's desire to introduce EU–wide anti-BEPS tool regimes (e.g. the 2020 Digital Services Tax, and the [[Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base|CCCTB]]).

{{See also|#Historical rates (1994–2018)}}

{{As of | November 2018}}, there are two rates of corporation tax ("CT") in the Republic of Ireland:&lt;ref name="ida1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.idaireland.com/invest-in-ireland/ireland-corporate-tax|title=Corporate Tax regime in Ireland|publisher=[[IDA Ireland|Industrial Development Authority]]|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ida2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.idaireland.com/IDAIreland/media/docs/publications/Taxation_2016.pdf|title=Corporate Taxation in Ireland 2016|publisher=[[IDA Ireland|Industrial Development Authority]]|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="du"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-charities/corporation-tax-for-companies/corporation-tax/index.aspx|title=Irish Corporation Tax Portal|publisher=[[Revenue Commissioners]]|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*a 12.5% ''headline rate''{{efn|name="ETR"|In ''[[#ETR|Effective Tax Rates]]'' it is shown that Ireland's true CT tax rate for foreign multinationals is between 0% to 3% depending on what particular Irish BEPS tools are used. ''[[#ETR|Effective Tax Rates]]'' also shows that the ''aggregate'' CT tax rate in Ireland is between 2% and 4.5% depending on various assumptions.}} for '''trading income''' (or active businesses income in the Irish tax code); ''trading'' relates to conducting a business, not ''investment trading'';
*a 25.0% ''headline rate''{{efn|Ireland offers specific Central Bank of Ireland–regulated SPVs that foreign investors in passive Irish income can use avoid the 25% rate (and all other Irish taxes and duties), on Irish assets.  The main vehicles are the Irish [[QIAIF]] and the Irish [[Section 110 SPV]].  Public tax scandals in Ireland in 2016, revealed because Irish Section 110 SPVs have to file Irish public accounts, led to the Central Bank of Ireland to introduce the [[L–QIAIF]] vehicle to replace the Section 110 SPV for foreign investors who want to avoid the 25% passive income tax in a confidential manner.  QIAIFs and L–QIAIFs do not have to file Irish public accounts; instead filing confidential accounts with the Central Bank of Ireland which are protected under the ''Central Bank Secrecy Act'' of 1942.&lt;ref name="cba"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/central-bank-secrecy-law-will-limit-public-disclosure-of-key-documents-1.2079188|title=Powerful Central Bank secrecy laws limit public disclosure of key documents|date=January 2016|publisher=Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} for '''non-trading income''' (or also called '''passive income''' in the Irish tax code); covering investment income (e.g. income from buying and selling assets), rental income from real estate, net profits from foreign trades, and income from certain land dealings and income from oil, gas and mineral exploitations in Ireland.

===Key aspects===
[[File:OECD 2018 Corporate Tax Rates.png|thumb|2018 ''headline'' corporate tax rates for all 35 OECD members (pre and post the 2017 U.S [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|TCJA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://taxfoundation.org/us-corporate-income-tax-more-competitive/|title=The United States’ Corporate Income Tax Rate is Now More in Line with Those Levied by Other Major Nations|publisher=[[Tax Foundation]]|date=12 February 2018|author=Kyle Pomerleau}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{As of | November 2018}}, the key attributes that tax experts note regarding the Irish corporate tax system are as follows:&lt;ref name="du"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BTC"/&gt;

* Low headline rate.  At 12.5%, Ireland has one of the lowest ''headline''{{efn|name="ETR"}} [[tax rates in Europe]] (Hungary 9% and Bulgaria 10% are lower); OECD average is 24.9%.&lt;ref name="ida2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://taxfoundation.org/corporate-income-tax-rates-around-the-world-2017/|title=Lowest and Highest Global Global Corporate Tax Rates|author=Kari Jahnsen|publisher=[[Tax Foundation]]|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Transparent.  Many of Ireland's corporation tax tools are OECD–whitelisted,&lt;ref name="CC1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/ireland-awarded-high-oecd-rating-on-tax-transparency-1.3194255|title=Ireland awarded high OECD rating on tax transparency|publisher=Irish Times|date=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ireland has one of the lowest '''secrecy scores''' in the 2018 [[Financial Secrecy Index|FSI rankings]].&lt;ref name="CC2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/we-have-no-problem-with-irish-tax-system-oecd-36566931.html|title='We have no problem with Irish tax system' - OECD|publisher=Irish Times|date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EUU"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/ireland-does-not-engage-in-harmful-tax-competition-says-european-commission-1.2895658?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2Fireland-does-not-engage-in-harmful-tax-competition-says-european-commission-1.2895658| title=Ireland does not engage in “harmful tax competition” says European Commission| publisher=Irish Times|date=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "Worldwide tax". Ireland is one of 6 remaining countries that use a "worldwide tax" system (Chile, Greece, Ireland, Israel, South Korea, Mexico).&lt;ref name="ida2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://taxfoundation.org/worldwide-taxation-very-rare/|title=Worldwide Taxation is Very Rare|publisher=[[Tax Foundation]]|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* No "thin capitalisation".  Ireland has no [[thin capitalisation]] rules, which means that Irish corporates can be financed with 100% debt, and 0% equity.&lt;ref name="du"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dilloneustace.com/download/1/Publications/Tax/Holding%20Companies%20in%20Ireland.pdf|title=Holding Companies in Ireland|publisher=Dillon Eustace Law Partners (Dublin)|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Double Irish]] residency. Before 2015, Irish CT was based where a company was "managed and controlled" versus registered; the "[[Double Irish]]" ends in 2020.&lt;ref name="ida2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="du"/&gt;

* [[Double Irish arrangement#Single malt|Single Malt]] residency. Post closure of the Double Irish to new entrants in 2015, it can be recreated by wordings in selective tax treaties (e.g. Malta and UAE).&lt;ref name="ida2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="du"/&gt;

* Extensive treaties. {{As of| March 2018}}, Ireland has bilateral tax treaties with 73 countries (the 74th, Ghana, is pending).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tax-agreements/double-taxation-treaties/index.aspx?page=u|title=Double Irish Taxation Treaties|publisher=[[Revenue Commissioners]]|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ida2"/&gt;

* Holding company regime. Built for [[#Corporate tax inversions|tax inversions]], it gives Irish–based holding companies tax relief on withholding taxes, foreign dividends and CGT.&lt;ref name="BTC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btconsulting.ie/page17/files/UK%20PLC%20Inversion.pdf|title=Inversion of UK plcs to Ireland|publisher=BT Consulting|date=2009|quote= However, in recent times, it is Ireland’s treatment of profits made by foreign subsidiaries of Irish resident companies that has been attracting attention and encouraging, in particular, UK firms to move their holding companies to Ireland and become tax resident there in order to reduce their tax burden.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="du"/&gt;

* [[Intellectual property]] regime.  Built for the BEPS tools of U.S. technology and life sciences firms, recognises a wide range of [[Intellectual capital|intellectual assets]] that can be charged against Irish tax; the [[CAIA arrangement]].&lt;ref name="acox2"/&gt;

* Knowledge Development Box. Ireland created the first OECD–compliant KDB in 2016 to support its IP–based BEPS tools.&lt;ref name="ida2"/&gt;

===Structure of Irish taxation===
{{Main article|Taxation in the Republic of Ireland}}
[[File:Distribution of Irish Exchequer Tax (2000 to 2017).png|thumb|upright=1.5|Distribution of Irish Exchequer Tax Revenues.&lt;ref name="dof10"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.finance.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/annual-taxation-report.pdf|title=ANNUAL TAXATION REPORT |publisher=[[Department of Finance (Ireland)]]|quote=Figure A.1: share of tax revenue 2000-2017, per cent|date=January 2018|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Each year, the [[Department of Finance (Ireland)|Department of Finance]] is required to produce a report on ''Estimates for Receipts and Expenditure'' for the coming year.  The table below, is extracted from the "Tax Revenues" section of the report for the prior-year (e.g. the 2017 column is from the 2018 report), by which time the "Tax Revenues" for that year are largely known (although still subject to further revision in later years).  

[[File:Irish Exchequer Tax Revenues to GDP and GNI.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Irish Exchequer Tax Revenues as % of GDP / GNI*.&lt;ref name="dof10"/&gt;]]

The "Tax Revenues" quoted are ''Exchequer Tax Revenues'', and do not include ''Appropriations-in-Aid'' ("A–in–A") items, the largest being Social Security (or PRSI) which for 2015 was €10.2 billion, and other smaller items.  Irish Personal Income tax, and the two main Irish consumption taxes of VAT and Excise, have consistently been circa 80% of the total Irish Exchequer Tax Revenue, with the balance being Corporate tax.

Ireland's economic model was transformed from a predominantly agricultural-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, when the EU agreed to waive EU State-aid rules to allow Ireland's '''special rate''' of 10% for manufacturing (created in 1980–81 with the EU's agreement),&lt;ref name="dof1"/&gt; to be extended to the [[special economic zone]] called the [[International Financial Services Centre]] ("IFSC") in Dublin city centre in 1987.&lt;ref name="dof1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="his4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="his3"/&gt;  The transformation was accelerated when Ireland's standard corporate tax rate was reduced from 40% to 12.5% (phased in from 1996–2003), in response to the EU's 1996–1998 decision to withdraw the State-aid waiver.&lt;ref name="dof1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="his2"/&gt;  The passing of the ''1997 Taxes and Consolidated Acts'' laid the legal foundations for the [[base erosion and profit shifting]] (BEPS) tools used by U.S. multinationals in Ireland (e.g. the [[Double Irish]], the [[Double Irish arrangement#CAIA|Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets]] and the [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)|Section 110 SPV]]), to achieve an effective Irish CT rate, or ''[[#ETR|ETR]]'', of 0–3%.{{efn|name="ETR"}}

While low CT rates (and evern lower [[#ETR|effective tax rates]]), are a central part of Irish tax policy, non–CT ''[[Taxation in the Republic of Ireland]]'' is closer to EU–28 and OECD averages.{{efn|However, only when Irish [[Modified gross national income]] (or GNI*) is used for comparision, rather than Irish GDP which is artificially inflated and distorted by BEPS flows.

Ireland's main foreign multinationals are from periods when their home jurisdiction had a "worldwide tax" system (see ''[[#Table 1|Table 1]]''), and since the UK switched to a "territorial tax" system in 2009–12, Ireland has been almost exclusively a U.S. corporate–[[tax haven]] (see ''[[#Table 1|Table 1]]'').&lt;ref name="hines2016"/&gt;  In October 2014, the ''[[The Guardian]]'' quoted the Irish lead singer of ''[[U2]]'', ''[[Bono]]'' as saying that "his country’s tax policies have "brought our country the only prosperity we’ve known"".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/12/bono-tax-laws-bring-ireland-prosperity-apple-google-u2|title=Bono: controversial tax laws have brought Ireland the only prosperity it’s ever known|date=12 October 2014|author=Rupert Neate|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|quote=In an interview with the Observer, the Irish singer says his country’s tax policies have “brought our country the only prosperity we’ve known”.

U.S.–controlled multinationals, either legally based in the U.S. or legally based in Ireland (e.g. tax inversions), dominate Ireland's economy.  In June 2018, the ''American Chamber of Commerce (Ireland)'' estimated the value of U.S. investment in Ireland was €334 billion, which compared to 2017 Irish [[GNI*]] [[Modified gross national income#Irish GDP versus Modified GNI (2009–2017)|of €181.2 billion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/denouncing-ireland-as-a-tax-haven-is-as-dated-as-calling-it-homophobic-because-of-our-past-37032219.html|title=Denouncing Ireland as a tax haven is as dated as calling it homophobic because of our past|publisher=Irish Independent|date=21 June 2018|quote=The total value of US business investment in Ireland - ranging from data centres to the world's most advanced manufacturing facilities - stands at $387bn (€334bn) - this is more than the combined US investment in South America, Africa and the Middle East, and more than the BRIC countries combined.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, [[Eurostat]] used 2015 data to show the ''gross operating surplus'' of foreign companies in Ireland was almost exclusively from U.S. companies, with the UK was a distant second, and little other foreign firm activity (see graphic).  Not only did U.S. companies rank ahead of Irish companies, but a material quantum of the ''gross operating surplus'' attributed to Irish companies, is from U.S. tax inversion such as [[Medtronic]], [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]] and [[Allergan]], who are in effect, U.S.–controlled multinationals, and have little attachment to Ireland.

In 2016–2017, foreign multinationals, being entirely U.S.–controlled:

===Multinational features===

The main features regarding foreign multinationals in Ireland are:

* '''They are almost exclusively U.S.'''  U.S.–controlled multinationals are 25 of the top 50 firms in Ireland, and 70% of top 50 firm revenue (see ''[[#Table 1|Table 1]]''). This includes U.S. multinationals that are legally headquartered in Ireland (e.g. [[Medtronic]]), but who are run from the U.S. (e.g. all senior executives and the main offices are in the U.S.).&lt;ref name="ita"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/article.php?id=2116085|title=Most of Ireland’s biggest companies aren’t Irish at all | publisher=[[TheJournal.ie]]|date=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="itb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.top1000.ie/companies|title=2017: Ireland's Top 1,000 Companies | publisher=[[Irish Times]]| date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''The are from countries with "worldwide tax" systems'''.  Tax academics show that firms from "territorial tax" systems (over 95% of all countries),{{efn|name="territorial"|"Territorial tax" systems have the flexibility to apply much lower tax rates on foreign sourced income to incentivise companies to maintain their headquarters at home (e.g. Germany applies a 5% tax on foreign profits).&lt;ref name="uk1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="her"&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Territorial Tax System Would Create Jobs and Raise Wages for U.S. Workers|url = https://www.heritage.org/taxes/report/territorial-tax-system-would-create-jobs-and-raise-wages-us-workers|publisher = The Heritage Foundation|date = 12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the 2017 U.S. ''[[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]]'', the U.S. was one of 7 remaining jurisdictions (e.g. Chile, Greece, Ireland, Israel, South Korea, Mexico and the U.S.), to operate a "worldwide tax" system which applied a fixed single high rate of 35% tax on all worldwide income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2013/wp13205.pdf|title=Territorial vs. Worldwide Corporate Taxation: Implications for Developing Countries|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|date=2013|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} make little use of [[tax havens]].&lt;ref name="hines2016"&gt;{{cite journal| url = https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2831&amp;context=articles|title=Multinational Firms and Tax Havens|author1=[[James R.

===Multinational job focus===
{{see also|Corporate haven#Employment tax}}

Ireland's corporate BEPS tools emphasise job creation (either of Irish employees or of foreign employees to Ireland).  To use Irish BEPS tools, and their [[#ETR|ETR]]s of 0–3%,{{efn|name="ETR"}} the multinational must meet conditions on the [[intellectual property]] ("IP") they will be using as part of their Irish BEPS tool.  This is outlined in the Irish Finance Acts particular to each scheme, but in summary, the multinational must:&lt;ref name="cap1"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Intangible Assets Scheme under Section 291A Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 |url = https://www.revenue.ie/ga/tax-professionals/historic-material/tax-briefing/2010/tax-briefing-issue-09-2010.pdf|publisher=[[Irish Revenue Commissioners]]|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cap2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-09/09-02-05.pdf|title=Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets under section 291A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (Part 9 / Chapter2)|publisher=[[Irish Revenue Commissioners]]|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Prove they are carrying out a "relevant trade" on the IP in Ireland (i.e. Ireland is not just an "empty shell" through which IP passes en route to another tax haven);
* Prove the level of Irish employment doing the "relevant activities" on the IP is consistent with the Irish tax relief being claimed (the ratio has never been disclosed);{{efn|There are fewer cases of U.S. technology multinationals conducting genuine software programming origination in Ireland.  The "high-value" Irish jobs tend to be "[[language localisation]]" work (e.g. converting software into different languages) or "sales and marketing".  These are sufficient to meet the Irish [[Revenue Commissioners]] criteria for a "relevant trade" and "relevant activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/work/ireland-s-top-tech-companies-who-pays-the-most-1.2526778|title=Google UK employees paid double their Irish equivalent|publisher=Irish Times|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="appleq"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/29/apple-tax-profits-ireland-cork|title=Apple's multi-billion dollar, low-tax profit hub: Knocknaheeny, Ireland|publisher=The Guardian|date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* Put this into an approved "business plan" (agreed with Revenue Commissioners and other State bodies, such as IDA Ireland), for the term of the tax relief scheme;

The percentage of Irish wage-to-profits has never been disclosed, however, commentators imply the Irish wage-roll needs to be circa 2–3% of gross Irish profits:

*  Apple employed 6,000 people in 2014, and at say €100,000 cost per employee gives a €600 million wage-roll on 2014 Irish profits of €25 billion (see table below),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/revealed-eight-facts-you-may-not-know-about-the-apple-irish-plant-36409796.html|title=Revealed Eight facts you may not know about the Apple Irish plant|publisher=Irish Independent|date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="appleq"/&gt; or 2.4%
*  Google employed 2,763 people in 2014, and at say €100,000 cost per employee gives a €276 million wage roll on Google 2014 Irish profits of €12 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finfacts.ie/Irish_finance_news/articleDetail.php?Does-Google-Ireland-have-6-000-employees-in-Ireland-649|title=Does Google Ireland have 6,000 employees in Ireland?|publisher=FinFacts|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 2.3%

To the extent that the Irish jobs are performing real functions (e.g. the function is not replicated elsewhere in the Group), the cost is not a "employment tax", however, at worst case, the U.S. multinational should incur an aggregate effective Irish corporation tax of 2–6% (actual Irish BEPS tool tax of 0–3%,{{efn|name="ETR"}} plus Irish employment costs of 2–3%).  Therefore, as shown in {{slink|#Yearly returns (2001–2017)}}, while Irish CT has consistently been between 10 and 15% of Total Irish Tax, the additional employment contribution made by U.S. multinationals in Ireland, has led to strong growth in overall Irish Total Taxes.

===Background===

[[File:Ireland Trade Good Discrepancy (1995-2017).png|thumb|'''[[Apple Inc.|Apple (Ireland)]]''' The Q1 2015 restructuring of Apple's non–U.S. IP to Ireland ([[leprechaun economics]]), is the largest [[BEPS]] action in history.&lt;br&gt;[[Brad Setser]] &amp; Cole Frank ([[Council on Foreign Relations|CoFR]]).&lt;ref name="cofr"/&gt;]]

The tax schemes used by U.S. multinationals in Ireland are called [[base erosion and profit shifting]] (BEPS) tools by tax academics.&lt;ref name="be"/&gt;  Whereas Ireland's ''headline'' corporation tax rate is 12.5%, Ireland's BEPS tools enable an [[#ETR|effective tax rate]] of 0% to 3% to be achieved, depending on which BEPS tool is used.{{efn|name="ETR"}}

Ireland has been associated with U.S. multinational ''profit shifting'' to avoid taxes since the U.S. IRS produced a list on the 12 January 1981.{{efn|name="gordon1"|Ireland was listed as a ''manufacturing tax haven'' in the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (1981) Tax Haven and Their Use by United States Taxpayers (The Gordon Report).

Hines Jr.]] identified Ireland as one of seven "major" tax havens for U.S. multinational ''profit shifting''.&lt;ref name="h3"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://taxdoctoralseminar.web.unc.edu/files/2016/02/Hines-Rice.pdf|title=FISCAL PARADISE: FOREIGN TAX HAVENS AND AMERICAN BUSINESS |author1=[[James R.

===Key features===

====Intellectual property====
{{see also|Corporate haven#IP–based BEPS tools}}

[[File:GIPC Intellectual Property 2018 (Patents Sub-Category).png|thumb|2018 GIPC League Table: ''Patents'' Sub-Category.&lt;ref name="gipc1"/&gt;]]

Ireland's main BEPS tools use [[intellectual property]] (IP) to effect the ''profit shift'' from the higher-tax locations to Ireland, via [[royalty payment]] schemes.  To avoid incurring Irish corporation tax on these ''shifted profits'', the BEPS tools either send-on the profits to traditional tax havens (with explicit 0% CT rates) via royalty payment schemes (e.g. the Double Irish and Single Malt BEPS tools), or use intangible capital allowances schemes to write-off the profits against Irish tax (e.g. the CAIA BEPS tool).&lt;ref name="zew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp.zew.de/pub/zew-docs/dp/dp13078.pdf|title=Profit Shifting and "Aggressive" Tax Planning by Multinational Firms|publisher=[[Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung|Centre for European Economic Research]], (ZEW)|author1=Clemens Fuest|author2=Christoph Spengel|author3=Katharina Finke|author4=Jost Heckemeyer|author5=Hannah Nusser|date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tilburg"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=143915| title=Intellectual Property Tax Planning in the light of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting  | publisher=University of Tilburg | date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the reason why most U.S. multinationals in Ireland are from the two largest IP–industries, namely technology companies and life sciences;&lt;ref name="be"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wipo"/&gt; or, are specific companies with valuable industrial patents such as Ingersoll-Rand and Eaton Corporation.&lt;ref name="fordam"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fordhamiplj.org/2016/08/30/ip-tax-avoidance-ireland/ | title=Intellectual Property and Tax Avoidance in Ireland | publisher=[[Fordham Intellectual Property, Media &amp; Entertainment Law Journal]] | date=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ireland describes its IP–based BEPS tools as being part of its "knowledge economy"; however, U.S. tax academics describe IP as "the leading tax-avoidance vehicle in the world".&lt;ref name="ucla"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/62-1-1.pdf | page=4|title=Intellectual Property Law Solutions to Tax Avoidance | publisher=UCLA Law Review | date=2015 | quote=Intellectual property (IP) has become the leading tax avoidance vehicle in the world today.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="raw"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bnrbeurs.nl/2017/02/22/the-corporate-tax-avoidance-toolbox/| title=The Corporate Tax Avoidance Toolbox|publisher=B&amp;R Beurs|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its small size, Ireland ranks 6th in the 2018 U.S. [[Global Intellectual Property Center]] (GIPC) league table of the top 50 global centres for IP–leglislation, and 4th in the important ''Patents'' sub-category (see graphic opposite).&lt;ref name="gipc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobalipcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GIPC_IP_Index_2018.pdf|title=U.S. Chamber International IP Index, 6th Edition, 2018|publisher=[[Global Intellectual Property Center]]|date=February 2018|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Ireland's most important BEPS tools are all IP–based, Ireland has other BEPS tools including Transfer Pricing–based BEPS tools (e.g. [[contract manufacturing]]), and Debt–based BEPS tools (e.g. the Irish [[Section 110 SPV]], and the Irish [[L-QIAIF]]).

===="Worldwide Tax" systems====

Ireland's IP–based BEPS tools have only attracted material operations from multinationals whose home jurisdiction had a "worldwide tax" system; namely, the U.K pre–2009, and the U.S. pre–2018 (see ''[[#Table 1|Table 1]]'').  Ireland has not attracted material technology or life sciences multinationals (outside of a specific plant, under its TP–based ''Contract Manufacturing'' BEPS tool), whose home jurisdiction operates a "territorial tax" system.  {{As of|November 2018}}, there are only 6 remaining jurisdictions in the world who operate a "worldwide tax" system, of which Ireland is one (e.g. Chile, Greece, Ireland, Israel, South Korea, Mexico).{{efn|name="territorial"}}

====Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets====
{{Main article|CAIA arrangement}}

In June 2009, the Irish State established the ''Commission on Taxation'', to review Ireland's tax regime, and included [[Feargal O'Rourke]] ("architect" of the Double Irish, see above).&lt;ref name="fear20"/&gt; In September 2009, the Commission recommended that the Irish State provide [[capital allowance]]s for the acquisition of [[intangible assets]], creating the ''[[CAIA arrangement|Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets]]'' (CAIA) BEPS tool.&lt;ref name="cot"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/handle/10197/1447| title=Commission on Taxation report 2009|date=September 2009| publisher=UCD Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1017830.shtml| title=Commission on Taxation Report Ireland 2009: Proposed property tax, a carbon tax, and domestic water charges as part of overhaul of Irish tax system|date=7 September 2009| publisher=FinFacts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas the Double Irish and Single Malt BEPS tools enable Ireland to act as a ''confidential'' "[[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Conduit OFC|Conduit OFC]]" for rerouting untaxed profits to places like Bermuda (e.g. it must be ''confidential'' as higher-tax locations would not sign full tax treaties with locations like Bermuda), the CAIA BEPS tool, enables Ireland to act as the "[[Conduit and Sink OFCs#Sink OFC|Sink OFC]]" (e.g. the terminus for untaxed profits, like Bermuda).

CAIA uses the accepted tax concept of providing [[capital allowance]]s for the purchase of physical assets.{{efn|Most tax codes in developed countries have [[capital allowance]] programs that give tax relief on capital expenditure that is amortised over the life of the physical asset on which the capital was invested in.}}  However, Ireland turns it into a BEPS tool by providing the allowances for the purchase of ''[[intangible assets]]'', and particularly ''[[intellectual property]]'' assets; and critically, where the owner of the intangible assets is a "connected party" (e.g. a Group subsidiary, often located in a tax haven); and has valued the assets for the inter-Group transaction using an Irish [[International Financial Services Centre|IFSC]] accounting firm. 

CAIA ''capitalises'' the tax shield of the Double Irish, and thus materially increases the distortion of the Irish national accounts.  This was shown in July 2016 when the Irish CEO had to restate Irish 2015 GDP by 34.4% due to Apple's Q1 2015 "[[leprechaun economics]]" restructure into a CAIA BEPS tool.&lt;ref name="apple"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/world/apple-taxes-jersey.html|title=After a Tax Crackdown, Apple Found a New Shelter for Its Profits|publisher=New York Times|author=Jesse Drucker|author2=Simon Bowers|date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A June 2018 report by the EU Parliament's [[European United Left-Nordic Green Left|GUE–NGL]] body showed that Apple doubled the Irish corporate tax shield of its CAIA BEPS tool by financing the acquisition of the IP via Jersey (the report called the CAIA BEPS tool, the ''[[Ireland as a tax haven#Green Jersey|Green Jersey]]'').&lt;ref name="emmaclancy"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.taxjustice.net/2018/06/25/new-report-is-apple-paying-less-than-1-tax-in-the-eu/|title=New Report on Apple's New Irish Tax Structure|publisher=[[Tax Justice Network]]|author=Naomi Fowler|date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emma"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://src.bna.com/zNy|title=Apple's Irish Tax Deals|publisher=[[European United Left-Nordic Green Left]] EU Parliament|author1=Martin Brehm Christensen|author2=Emma Clancy|date=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas the Double Irish and Single Malt have an ETR of less than 1%, the ETR of the CAIA BEPS tool ranges from 0% to 3% depending on the date on which the CAIA tool was started (see [[#Effective tax rate (ETR)|effective tax rates]]).{{efn|name="cap"}}&lt;ref name="coxx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="maples"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mhc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mhc.ie/latest/e-zines/world-ip-day-2014/P1|title=World IP Day: IRELAND'S 2.5% IP Tax Rate (Section 4.1.1)|publisher=Mason Hayes and Curran (Law Firm)|date=April 2013|quote=When combined with other features of Ireland’s IP tax regime, an effective rate as low as 2.5% can be achieved on IP related income}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Knowledge Development Box====

Ireland created the first OECD–compliant '''Knowledge Development Box''' ("KDB"), in the 2015 ''Finance Act'', to further support it's [[intellectual property]] [[base erosion and profit shifting|BEPS]] toolkit.&lt;ref name="ida2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.independent.ie/business/budget/budget-2016-do-you-know-what-the-knowledge-box-is-31576795.html|title=Do you know what the Knowledge Box is?|publisher=Irish Indepdendant|date=9 October 2015|author=Michael Cogley|quote=The initial announcement of the KDB came after the closure of the ‘double Irish’ tax loophole and while he does not see it as a knee-jerk reaction Ken Hardy, tax partner at KPMG believes it is an attempt to keep Ireland’s tax scheme as competitive as possible.  However, other European countries, including Germany, have warned that these incentives should only be used as a reward for R&amp;D investment and not as a tax avoidance to}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The KDB behaves like a [[Double Irish arrangement#CAIA|CAIA]] BEPS scheme with a cap of 50% (i.e. similar to getting 50%–relief against capitalised IP, for a net effective Irish tax rate of 6.25%). As with the CAIA BEPS scheme, the KDB is limited to specific "qualifying assets", however, unlike CAIA tool, these are quite narrowly defined by the 2015 ''Finance Act''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-29/29-03-01.pdf|title=Revenue Guidance Notes for Knowledge Development Box|publisher=Revenue Commissioners|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bdo.ie/en-gb/insights/tax/knowledge-development-box/knowledge-development-box-(kdb)|title=Guidelines Knowledge Development Box|publisher=BDO Ireland|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

The Irish KDB was created with tight conditions to ensure OECD compliance and thus meets the OECD's "modified Nexus standard" for IP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.oecd.org/ctp/beps-action-5-agreement-on-modified-nexus-approach-for-ip-regimes.pdf|title=Action 5 Agreement on Modified Nexus Approach for IP Regimes|publisher=OECD|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has drawn criticism from Irish tax advisory firms who feel that its use is limited to pharmaceutical (who have the most "Nexus" compliant patents/processes), and some niche sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/ie/en/pages/tax/articles/knowledge-development-box-ireland.html|title=Knowledge Development Box Improvements Needed|publisher=Deloitte Ireland|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://home.kpmg.com/ie/en/home/insights/2016/04/kdb-best-in-class.html|title=Knowledge Development Box: Best in Class?|publisher=KPMG Ireland|date=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is expected these conditions will be relaxed over time through refinements of the 2015 ''Finance Act''; a route taken by other Irish [[Corporate haven#IP-based BEPS tools|IP–based BEPS]] tools:

* [[Double Irish]] – the unusual definition of tax residence was embedded in the 1997 ''Taxes and Consolidation Act'' (TCA), and expanded in 1999-2003 ''Finance Acts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-02/02-02-03.pdf|title=Guidance on Tax Residence Irish Revenue|publisher=Revenue Commissioners|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Double Irish arrangement#Single malt|Single Malt]] – takes the Double Irish tax-residence concept around "management and control", and worded directly into specific bilateral tax treaties (Malta, UAE).&lt;ref name="ca"/&gt;
* [[Double Irish arrangement#CAIA|Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets]] – introduced in the 1997 TCA but expanded in the 2009 ''Finance Act'',&lt;ref name="ida2"/&gt; and made tax-free in the 2015 ''Finance Act'' for Apple.{{efn|name="cap"}}&lt;ref name="app1"/&gt;
* [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)|Section 110 SPVs]] – created in the 1997 TCA with strong anti-avoidance controls, which were eroded in 2003, 2008, 2011 ''Finance Acts'' (see [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)|Section 110]] article).
* [[L–QIAIFs]] – [[QIAIF]]s were introduced in 2013 with the new EU [[Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 2011|AIFMD]] regulations, but expanded in 2018 into a full [[Corporate haven#Debt-based BEPS tools|Debt–based BEPS tool]].

Irish tax-law firms expect the Irish KDB terms will be brought into alignment with the CAIA BEPS tool terms in the future.&lt;ref name="KDB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.matheson.com/images/uploads/documents/KDB_Matheson.pdf|title=Knowledge Development Box Public Consultation and Observations|publisher=Matheson|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Section 110 SPV====
{{main article|Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)}}

[[File:Stephen Donnelly 2016.jpg|thumb|'''[[Stephen Donnelly|Stephen Donnelly TD]]''' Estimated U.S. funds would avoid €20 billion in Irish taxes from 2016–2026 on circa €40 billion of Irish investments (2012–2016), by using Section 110 SPVs.&lt;ref name="sd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stephendonnelly.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Closing-Down-Section-110-for-Vulture-Funds.pdf | title=WHY LETTING SECTION 110 SPVS OPERATE IN THE IRISH DOMESTIC ECONOMY WILL DAMAGE OUR TAX BASE AND OUR REPUTATION AS A ‘LOW-TAX’ ECONOMY | publisher=Stephen Donnelly (Dail Submission)|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle''' ("SPV") is an Irish [[tax resident]] company, which qualifies under Section 110 of the 1997 ''Irish Taxes Consolidation Act'' (“TCA”), by virtue of restricting itself to only holding "qualifying assets", for a special tax regime that enables the SPV to attain full tax neutrality (i.e. the SPV pays no Irish corporate taxes).  It is a major Irish [[Corporate haven#Debt-based BEPS tools|Debt–based BEPS]] tool.  

Section 110 was created to help [[International Financial Services Centre]] ("IFSC") legal and accounting firms compete for the administration of global [[securitisation]] deals. While they pay no Irish taxes, they contribute circa €100 million annually to the Irish economy from fees paid to the IFSC legal and accounting firms.&lt;ref name="idsa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idsa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IDSA_Securitisation-Industry-in-Ireland.pdf|title=Ireland: The Leading European Jurisdiction for SPVs, Structured Finance and Securitised Structures|publisher=Irish Debt Securities Association|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; IFSC firms lobbied the Irish State for [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)#Evolution|successive amendments]] to the Section 110 legislation, so that by 2011, Section 110 had become an Irish Debt–based BEPS tool, for avoiding tax on Irish and international assets.

These [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)#Abuses|abuses]] were discovered because Section 110 SPVs must file public accounts with the Irish [[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|CRO]].  In 2018 [[Central Bank of Ireland]] overhauled the little-used [[Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF)#L-QIAIF|L–QIAIF]] vehicle, so that is now offers the same tax benefits on Irish assets held via debt as the Section 110 SPV, but without having to file Irish public accounts.

====L–QIAIF====
{{main|Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF)}}

The Irish [[Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF)|QIAIF]] regime is exempt from all Irish taxes and duties (including VAT and withholding tax), and apart from the VCC wrapper, do not have to file public accounts with the Irish [[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|CRO]].  This has made [[Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF)|QIAIF]] an important "backdoor" out of the Irish corporate tax system.  The most favoured destination is to [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|Sink OFC]] Luxembourg, which receives 50% of all outbound Irish [[foreign direct investment]] ("FDI).&lt;ref name="luxx"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2018/06/28/Ireland-Selected-Issues-46027|page=20|quote=Figure 3.

When the Section 110 SPV Irish domestic tax avoidance [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)#Abuses|scandals]] surfaced in late 2016, it was due to Irish financial journalists and [[Dail Eireann]] representatives scrutinising the Irish [[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|CRO]] public accounts of U.S. distressed firms.  In November 2016 the [[Central Bank of Ireland|Central Bank]] began to overhaul the [[Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF)#L-QIAIF rationale|L-QIAIF]] regime.  In early 2018, the Central Bank upgraded the [[Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF)#L-QIAIF rationale|L-QIAIF]] regime so that it could replicate the Section 110 SPV (e.g. closed end debt structures), but without needing to file public [[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|CRO]] accounts.  In June 2018, the Central Bank announced that €55 billion of U.S. distressed debt assets had transferred out of Section 110 SPVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/tax-free-funds-once-favoured-by-vultures-fall-55bn-1.3546101|title=Tax-free funds once favoured by ‘vultures’ fall €55bn: Regulator attributes decline to the decision of funds to exit their so-called ‘section 110 status’|publisher=Irish Times|date=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is expected that the Irish [[Qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF)#L-QIAIF rationale|L–QIAIF]] will replace the Irish Section 110 SPV as Ireland's main [[Corporate haven#Debt-based BEPS tools|Debt–based BEPS tool]] for U.S. multinationals in Ireland.

The ability of foreign institutions to use QIAIFs (and particularly the ICAV wrapper) to avoid all Irish taxes on Irish assets has been blamed for the bubble in Dublin commercial property (and, by implication, the Dublin housing crisis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/commercial-property/tax-breaks-for-commercial-property-will-fuel-bubble-35189754.html| title=Tax breaks for commercial property will fuel bubble| quote=They'll do this by making commercial property investment, mainly by large foreign landlords, entirely tax free.

===TP–based BEPS tools===

Ireland's [[transfer pricing]] ("TP") based BEPS tools are mostly related to [[contract manufacturing]].  By refusing to implement the 2013 EU Accounting Directive (and invoking exemptions on reporting holding company structures until 2022), Ireland enables their TP and IP–based BEPS tools to structure as "unlimited liability companies" (ULCs) which do not have to file public accounts with the Irish [[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|CRO]].&lt;ref name="acc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taxjustice.net/2018/06/25/new-report-is-apple-paying-less-than-1-tax-in-the-eu/|title=New report: is Apple paying less than 1% tax in the EU?|publisher=[[Tax Justice Network]]|date=28 June 2018|quote=The use of private "unlimited liability company" (ULC) status, which exempts companies from filing financial reports publicly.

However, Irish TP–based BEPS tools are smaller, and therefore harder to pick out from a listed multinational's group accounts.  In addition, the Irish State, to help obfuscate the activities of the larger and more important IP–based BEPS tools, sometimes present their data as ''manufacturing'' data, and blended in with TP–based BEPS data; the example of how the Irish State [[Leprechaun economics#Obfuscation of source|obfuscated]] Apple's Q1 2015 CAIA BEPS tool, by crediting the 2015 [[leprechaun economics]] GDP growth rate to contract manufacturing and aircraft leasing activities is a notable case.  It is generally regarded that Ireland's main TP–based BEPS tool users are the life sciences manufacturers.

=={{anchor|ETR}}Effective tax rate (ETR)==

===Background===

The ''headline'' tax rate is the rate of taxation that is applied to the profits that a tax-code deems to be taxable after deductions.  The ''effective'' tax rate is the rate of taxation implied by the actual quantum of tax paid versus profits before all deductions are applied.  The gap between the Irish corporate ''headline'' rate of 12.5%, and the much lower Irish corporate ''effective'' rate of 2–4%, is a source of controversy:  

{{quote|Many of the multinationals gathered at the Four Seasons [in Dublin, Ireland] that day pay far less than 12.5 percent tax, their accounts show.

In 2014, Ireland refused to implement the 2013 EU Accounting Directive, and invoked exemptions on reporting holding company structures until 2022, so that multinationals can register as Irish "unlimited liability companies" (ULCs), which do not have to file public accounts with the Irish [[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|CRO]].&lt;ref name="acc1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acc2"/&gt;  However, as most foreign multinationals in Ireland are major U.S. listed companies (see ''[[#Table 1|Table 1]]''), tax academics have been able to estimate their Irish ETR from U.S. filings.  In addition, the 2014–2016 EU investigation into Apple, Ireland's largest company, produced detail on Apple's Irish ETR from 2004–2014.

===Independent research===

In February 1994, the most cited academic in tax haven research,&lt;ref name="respec"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/cgi-bin/htsearch?form=extended&amp;wm=wrd&amp;dt=range&amp;ul=&amp;q=tax+haven&amp;cmd=Search%21&amp;wf=4BFF&amp;s=C&amp;db=&amp;de=|title=IDEAS/RePEc Database|quote=Tax Havens by Most Cited}}&lt;/ref&gt; American tax economist [[James R. Hines Jr.]], published the most cited academic paper on tax havens,&lt;ref name="respec"/&gt; titled: "Fiscal Paradise: Foreign Tax Havens and American Business"; which estimated in Appendix IV that Ireland's ''aggregate'' effective corporate rate (ETR) was 4%.&lt;ref name="h3"/&gt; 

In October 2013, Bloomberg commissioned a ''Special Investigation'' into the tax affairs of U.S. multinationals in Ireland, which estimated that the effective tax rate of all U.S. multinationals in Ireland had fallen to 3% by 2010.&lt;ref name="bberg"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/infographics/u-s-profits-in-ireland-pile-up.html|title=Ireland: Where Profits Pile Up, Helping Multinationals Keep Taxes Low|publisher=Bloomberg News|quote=Meanwhile, the tax rate reported by those Irish subsidiaries of U.S. companies plummeted to 3% from 9% by 2010|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report featured research into the "architect" of the Double Irish BEPS tool, PWC tax partner [[Feargal O'Rourke]], who Bloomberg noted was regarded as a "hero" in Ireland.&lt;ref name="fr1"/&gt;

In February 2014, [[Trinity College, Dublin]] Professor of Finance, Dr. Jim Stewart, author of studies into Ireland's tax systems,&lt;ref name="jimst"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jimstew"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tasc.ie/download/pdf/apple_tax_case.pdf|title=Apple Tax Case and the Implications for Ireland|page=19|author=Professor Jim Stewart|publisher=[[Trinity College, Dublin]]|quote=It is important to note that the most attractive aspect of [corporate] tax incentives offered by Ireland is not the [headline 12.5%] tax rate but the tax regime|date=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the U.S. [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] data filed by U.S. multinationals on their global operations, to estimate that the effective tax rate of U.S. multinationals in Ireland for 2011 was 2.2% to 3.8% (depending on assumptions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/corporate-tax-calculations-1.1689233?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fcorporate-tax-calculations-1.1689233|quote=A study by Dr Jim Stewart, associate professor in finance at Trinity College Dublin, suggests that in 2011 the subsidiaries of U.S. multinationals in Ireland paid an effective tax rate of 2.2 per cent. |title=Effective Corporate Tax calculations: 2.2%|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|date=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/multinationals-escape-tax-due-to-exceptional-rules-study-claims-1.1784447|title=Multinationals escape tax due to ‘exceptional’ rules, study claims|publisher=Irish Times|date=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, the ''[[Tax Justice Network]]'', in their ''Ireland Country Report'' from the 2013 [[Financial Secrecy Index]], said the Irish State's claims that the effective tax rate was 12.5% were "misleading", and that Ireland's corporate ETR was between 2.5% to 4.5%, depending on the various assumptions used.&lt;ref name="tjn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/Archive2013/Country%20Reports/Ireland.pdf|title=TAX JUSTICE NETWORK: Ireland Financial Secrecy Index Country Report 2014|quote=Misleadingly, studies cited by the Irish Times and other outlets suggest that the effective tax rate is close to the headline 12.5 percent rate – but this is a fictional result based on a theoretical 'standard firm with 60 employees' and no exports: it is entirely inapplicable to transnationals. Though there are various ways to calculate effective tax rates, other studies find rates of just 2.5–4.5 percent.|publisher=[[Tax Justice Network]]|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Irish economist [[David McWilliams (economist)|David McWilliams]] writing in the ''[[Irish Times]]'' quoted that the U.S. BEA statistics implied that U.S. multinationals in Ireland paid an effective tax rate of 3.27% on Irish registered pre-tax income of $106,789 million in 2013, and 3.38% on Irish registered pre-tax income of $108,971 million in 2014, due to "a myriad of loopholes to avoid even our own low rates of tax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/david-mcwilliams-a-new-economic-plan-for-ireland-1.3294430|title=A new economic plan for Ireland|date=18 November 2017|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|author=[[David McWilliams (economist)|David McWilliams]]|quote=Our corporation tax rate is 12.5 per cent, so they should be paying about €12 billion a year in tax.

In June 2018, 24 years after the 1994 James R. Hines paper into global corporate tax havens, noted French tax economist [[Gabriel Zucman]], in his major study into the BEPS flows of global tax havens titled: "The Missing Profits of Nations";&lt;ref name="zuc10"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/corporations-push-profits-into-tax-havens-as-countries-struggle-in-pursuit-study-says-1528634659|title=Zucman:Corporations Push Profits Into Corporate Tax Havens as Countries Struggle in Pursuit, Gabrial Zucman Study Says|quote=Such profit shifting leads to a total annual revenue loss of $200 billion globally|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; also estimated in Appendix I of the study that Ireland's ''aggregate'' effective corporate tax rate was 4%.&lt;ref name="gabrielzucman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gabriel-zucman.eu/|title=APPENDIX 1 Table 2 : The Missing Profits of Nations|page=31|quote=Ireland's effective tax rate on all foreign corporates (U.S. and non–U.S.) is 4%|publisher=[[National Bureau of Economic Research]], Working Papers|author1=[[Gabriel Zucman]]|author2=Thomas Torslov|author3=Ludvig Wier|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filed accounts===

Over the years, the largest U.S. multinationals in Ireland, who are both Ireland's largest companies and pay most of Ireland's corporation tax (see [[#Low tax economy|low tax economy]]),&lt;ref name="ct1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RTE"/&gt; have filed various accounts showing their Irish ETR.  As discussed above, because Ireland refused to ratify the 2013 EU Accounting Directive, many of these multinationals have switched to "unlimited liability companies" in Ireland, which do not file accounts; thus the information is only available in a few cases.  However, where U.S. multinationals have disclosed Irish financials, they all imply an Irish ETR of less than 1 percent.{{efn|Note that the accounts referenced below are from U.S. multinationals in Ireland who were at the time of filing, [[Double Irish arrangement#Multinationals who used Irish BEPS tools|known to be using]] the Double Irish and Single Malt BEPS tools; they thus reflect the ETR of these specific Irish BEPS tools.}}

===Marketing brochures===

Irish BEPS tools are not overtly marketed as brochures showing near-zero effective tax rates would damage Ireland's ability to sign and operate bilateral tax treaties (i.e. higher-tax countries do not sign full treaties with known tax havens).{{efn|name="treaty"|In September 2018, Ireland had a global network of 73 bilateral tax treaties, and a 74th with Ghana awaiting ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tax-agreements/double-taxation-treaties/index.aspx|title=Revenue: Double Taxation Treaties|publisher=[[Revenue Commissioners]]|date=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} However, in the Irish financial crisis, some Irish tax law firms in the [[Irish Financial Services Centre|IFSC]] produced CAIA brochures openly marketing that its ETR was 2.5%.{{efn|name="cap"|When the Irish State applied a cap of 80% on the total amount of Irish intangible capital allowances that can be used against taxable profits in any year, it gave an Irish effective tax rate (ETR) of 2.5% for the CAIA BEPS tool, being the Irish corporation tax rate of 12.5% multiplied by 20%. Therefore, the ETR of the CAIA is often described as being 0–2.5%, depending on the Irish State rules regarding caps at the date the CAIA scheme was started.

In February 2014, as a result of Bloomberg's ''Special Investigation'' and Trinity College Professor Dr. Jim Stewart's ETR calculations (see above), the "architect" of Ireland's Double Irish BEPS tool, PricewaterhouseCoopers tax-partner [[Feargal O'Rourke]], went on ''[[RTE Radio]]'' to state that: "there was a hole the size of the Grand Canyon", in the analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/multinationals-paid-2-2-per-cent-tax-1310050-Feb2014/|title=Multinational companies paid just 2.2 per cent tax in 2011 - report|publisher=[[TheJournal.ie]]|date=15 February 2014|author=Paul Hosford|quote=[Dr. Stewart] criticised the report’s use of a single company for a host of countries across the world, telling RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that the PWC report was based on a “fictitious or hypothetical” company, adding:  You can’t say we have an effective tax rate of 11.9 per cent.

Yet a recent study by Jim Stewart, associate professor of finance at Trinity College Dublin, shows some US multinational subsidiaries operating in Ireland paid an effective rate of tax of just 2.2 per cent on their Irish activities in 2011. Prof Stewart argued that, in order for PwC and the World Bank to compare tax rates across the world, they created a hypothetical company that does not engage in tax planning, and was “small, domestically owned, has no imports or exports and produces and sells ceramic flower pots”.

In December 2014, the Irish [[Department of Finance (Ireland)|Department of Finance]], gathered a panel of Irish experts (but no international experts) to estimate Irish corporate ETR for the Committee on Finance Public Expenditure.&lt;ref name="his2"/&gt;  The results, summarised on Section 2 (page 13) of the report, showed all of the Irish experts, with the exception of Dr. Jim Stewart, agreed with Feargal O'Rourke and PricewaterhouseCoopers:

==Corporate tax inversions==
{{see also|Tax inversion}}

===Background===

An Irish '''[[corporate tax inversion]]''' is a strategy in which a foreign multinational acquires or merges with an Irish–based company, and then shifts its legal place of incorporation to Ireland to avail of Ireland's favourable corporate tax regime; however, the multinational's majority ownership, ''effective headquarters'' and executive management stay in its home jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/what-are-tax-inversions-1.2598741|title=What are tax inversions?|publisher=[[Irish Times]]|date=5 April 2016|quote=Inversions are in essence, a financial exercise which allow companies to lower their tax bills by acquiring a legal address abroad.

Almost all tax inversions to Ireland have come from the U.S., and to a lesser degree, the UK (see below); the first U.S. tax inversions to Ireland were [[Ingersoll Rand]] and [[Accenture]] 2009,&lt;ref name="bbb"/&gt; and as of November 2018, Ireland was also the destination for the largest U.S. corporate tax inversion in history, namely the $81 billion merger of [[Medtronic]] and [[Covidien]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="medtronic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestreet.com/slideshow/14222919/1/as-treasury-moves-to-bring-back-inversions-here-are-seven-of-the-biggest-recent-deals.html|title=As Treasury Moves to Bring Back Inversions, Here are 7 of the Biggest Recent Deals|author=Emily Stewart|date=22 July 2017|publisher=TheStreet}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. tax code's anti-avoidance rules prohibit a U.S. company simply creating a new "legal" headquarters in Ireland while its main business is in the US (known as a "self-inversion").&lt;ref name="cox"/&gt;  Up until April 2016, the U.S. tax code would only consider the inverted company as foreign (i.e. outside the U.S. tax-code), where the inversion was part of an acquisition, and the Irish target was at least 20% of the value of the combined group; although the Irish target had to be over 40% of the combined group for the inversion to be fully considered as outside of the U.S. tax-code.&lt;ref name="rules2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forbesinversion"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2014/09/10/the-tax-inversion-rush-in-one-handy-graphic/#4b2eac18bf02|title=The Tax Inversion Rush: One Handy Graphic|publisher=[[Forbes Magazine]]|author=Janet Novack|date=10 September 2014|quote=The U.S. company is in black, as is the share of the merged company its current shareholders will own; it must be less than 80% for the tax trick to work under the current law.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once inverted, the U.S. company can use Irish [[#Multinational tax schemes|multinational BEPS strategies]] to achieve an [[#ETR|effective tax rate]] well below the Irish headline rate of 12.5% on non–U.S. income, and also reduce U.S. taxes on U.S. income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/tax-inversion|title=Bloomberg Special TAX INVERSION|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2014, ''[[Forbes Magazine]]'' quoted research that estimated a U.S. inversion to Ireland reduced the U.S. multinational's ''aggregate'' tax rate from above 30% to well below 20%.&lt;ref name="forbesinversion"/&gt;

In July 2015, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' noted that Ireland's lower ETR made U.S. multinationals who inverted to Ireland highly acquisitive of other U.S. firms (i.e. they could afford to pay more to acquire U.S. competitors to re-domicile them to Ireland), and listed the post-inversion acquisitions of Activis/Allergan, Endo, Mallinckrodt and Horizon.&lt;ref name="wsjinversions"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/horizon-pharma-at-the-nexus-of-taxes-and-deals-1436296946|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]|author=Liz Hoffman|date=7 July 2015|quote=Horizon and other inverted companies are using their new, lower tax rates to turbocharge corporate takeovers. Applying those rates, often in the midteens, to profits of companies in the U.S., with a federal corporate rate of 35%, can yield extra savings on top of those traditionally wrung from mergers. Moreover, unlike the U.S., Ireland and most other countries, only tax profits earned in-country, giving companies the freedom and incentive to shift income to still-lower-tax jurisdictions.|title=The Tax Inversion Wave Keeps Rolling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, the Irish [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]] (CSO) warned that tax inversions to Ireland artificially inflated Ireland's GDP data (e.g. without providing any Irish tax revenue).

In April 2016, the Obama administration announced new tax rules to increase the threshold for a U.S. corporate tax inversion to be considered a "foreign company", and thus escape U.S. taxation.  The new rules were directly designed to block the proposed $160 billion merger of U.S.–based Pfizer and Irish–based Allergan, which would have been the largest corporate tax inversion in history.&lt;ref name="rules1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/69f01f50-fbbc-11e5-8f41-df5bda8beb40|title=Collapse of $160bn Pfizer and Allergan merger shocks corporate US|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=6 April 2015|author1=Barney Jopson|author2=David Crow|author3=James Fontanella-Khan|author4=Arash Massoudi|quote=The collapse of Pfizer’s $160bn merger with Allergan on Wednesday brought the total value of abandoned deals this year to its highest since the eve of the financial crisis and sent shockwaves through corporate America.

Ireland is labelled a both a [[corporate tax haven]], due to its BEPS tools (e.g. Double Irish, Single Malt and CAIA), and a traditional [[tax haven]], due to [[QIAIF]]s.  The topic is covered in more detail in [[Ireland as a tax haven]], however, the main facts regarding Ireland's [[corporate tax haven]] status are:

During 2009–2012, both the Labour Government and the Conservative Government, overhauled the UK corporate tax code, switching from a "worldwide tax" system to a "territorial tax" system.&lt;ref name="uk1"/&gt; By 2014, the UK ''[[HM Revenue and Customs|HMRC]]'' reported most of the UK firms that inverted to Ireland had returned to the UK (e.g., WPP plc, United Business Media plc, Henderson plc), or were about to be acquired by U.S. multinationals as part of a U.S. tax inversion (e.g. Shire plc{{efn|name="shire"}}).&lt;ref name="HMRC"/&gt;  

{{As of |November 2018}}, since the UK overhauled its tax code, there have been no inversions of UK firms to Ireland; of the 3 main UK–controlled firms in Ireland (see ''[[#Table 1|Table 1]]''):

* [[Shire plc]] – the UK pharmaceutical inverted to Ireland in 2009, but did not return to the UK post the 2009–2012 UK tax reforms due to acquisition interest by U.S. pharmaceutical firms attempting to use Shire plc to execute a U.S. tax inversion to Ireland; however, the Obama administration's changes to the U.S. tax code in 2016 stopped further U.S. interest in Shire plc, and in 2018, it accepted a lower bid from Japanese pharmaceutical multinational [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]], who will not be using Shire plc to invert to Ireland.{{efn|name="shire"}}
* [[Experian plc]] – the first UK corporate tax inversion to Ireland in 2016, however almost all of Experian's business is U.S.–based, so it is unlikely to return to the UK.{{efn|name="experian"|Ireland's largest law firm, ''Authur Cox'', records the move of ''[[Experian plc]]'' to Ireland in 2006, as the first UK corporate tax inversion to Ireland.&lt;ref name="arthurcox"/&gt;  Experian was formed in 2006 from the de-merger of UK conglomerate GUS plc, but most of Experian's business was U.S. based (e.g it had a limited remaining connection to the UK).&lt;ref name="experian"/&gt;}}
* [[Tesco plc|Tesco (Ireland)]]  Tesco is not in Ireland for any tax-related reason; Tesco (Ireland) is the Irish holding company for Tesco plc's large network of Irish grocery stores.

In April 2018, the EU Commission's [[General Data Protection Regulation|GDPR]] rules forced Facebook to move 1.5 billion of the 1.9 billion Facebook accounts hosted in Ireland ( 79% of the 2.4 billion total global Facebook accounts), back to the U.S.&lt;ref name="fbk9"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/facebook-to-put-1-5bn-users-out-of-reach-of-new-eu-gdpr-privacy-law-1.3466837|title=Facebook to put 1.5bn users out of reach of new EU GDPR privacy law| publisher=[[Irish Times]]|date=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The April 2018 Irish High Court ruling in the [[Max Schrems]] EU data-protection case could make Ireland even less attractive to Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europe-v-facebook.org/sh2/PA-ref.pdf|title=Irish High Court sends Facebook’s EU-US data transfers before CJEU|publisher=[[Max Schrems]]| date=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====US countermeasures (2016–2018)====
{{see also|Double Irish arrangement#Effect of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act}}

The U.S. has had a contradictory approach to Ireland's CT system.  U.S. investigations, from the first U.S. IRS study in 1981,{{efn|name="gordon1"}}&lt;ref name="gordon2"/&gt; up to and including 2013 U.S. McCain–Levin Senate investigations into Apple's tax structures, label Ireland as a "tax haven" for U.S. multinationals.&lt;ref name="psi2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psi3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="holygrail"/&gt;  However, it was the EU and not the U.S., that forced Ireland to close its Double Irish BEPS tool in 2015.&lt;ref name="roy1"/&gt;  While the Obama administration supported the McCain–Levin findings on Apple, it came to Apple's defense in 2016 when the EU Commission fined Apple €13 billion for taxes avoided over 2004–2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. accuses EU of grabbing tax revenues with Apple decision|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-apple-taxavoidance-usa-idUSKCN1161UC|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This contradiction is chronicled in "[[Ireland as a tax haven#Political compromises|political compromises]]".  The source of the contradiction is ascribed to the findings of U.S. tax academic, [[James R. Hines Jr.]]; Hines is the most cited author on tax haven research, and his important [[James R. Hines Jr.#Tax haven research|1994 Hines–Rice paper]] was one of the first to use the term'' "[[BEPS|profit shifting]]"''.&lt;ref name="be"/&gt; The 1994 Hines–Rice paper showed that ''low foreign tax rates [from tax havens] ultimately enhance U.S. tax collections''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d8b8cb98-c956-11de-b551-00144feabdc0|title=Tax havens benefits spelt out|publisher=[[The Financial Times]]|date=4 November 2009|quote=The study said "a large body of economic research over the last 15 years" contradicted the popular view that offshore centres erode tax collections, divert economic activity and otherwise burden nearby high-tax countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hines' insight that the [[Tax haven#U.S. as the largest beneficiary|U.S. is the largest beneficiary from tax havens]] was confirmed by others,&lt;ref name="dryng"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1475-679X.2009.00346.x|title=Using Financial Accounting Data to Examine the Effect of Foreign Operations Located in Tax Havens and Other Countries on U.S. Multinational Firms' Tax Rates|author1=Scott Dyreng|author2=Bradley P.

However, by 2014 Ireland had become the leading destination for U.S. [[#Corporate tax inversions|corporate tax inversions]], and in 2016, the Obama administration decided to move against Ireland's CT system by amending the U.S. tax-code to block the proposed $160 billion Pfizer–Allergan Irish corporate tax inversion, which would have been the largest tax inversion in history.

The most serious threat to Ireland's CT system, and Ireland's economic model came in December 2017 with the passing of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|Tax Cuts and Jobs Act]] (TCJA) by the Trump administration.&lt;ref name="hbr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/ideacast/2017/12/breaking-down-the-new-u-s-corporate-tax-law|title=Breaking Down the New U.S. Corporate Tax Law|publisher=[[Harvard Business Review]]|author=[[Mihir A.

===Sustainability of system===

The above post–2009 UK, EU and U.S. countermeasures against Ireland's corporate tax system, and by extension Ireland's economic model, have been a cause of concern in Ireland, and even the "architect" of Ireland's BEPS tools, PricewaterhouseCoopers tax-partner, [[Feargal O'Rourke]], has warned on the sustainability of Irish CT revenues.&lt;ref name="fearg"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/frothiness-of-corporate-tax-revenues-risk-to-economy-says-pwc-chief-1.3471704|title=‘Frothiness’ of corporate tax revenues risk to economy, says PwC chief|date=24 April 2018|publisher=Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, the Irish Government publilshed a study on the sustainability of its corporate tax system by [[University College Cork]] economist Seamus Coffey.&lt;ref name="coffey1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/updates/minister-donohoe-publishes-review-of-irelands-corporation-tax-code/|title=Minister Donohoe publishes Review of Ireland’s Corporation Tax Code|publisher=[[Department of Finance (Ireland)]]|date=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coffey2"/&gt;  Coffey reported that Irish CT revenues were sustainable to 2020,&lt;ref name="seas1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/strong-corporate-tax-receipts-sustainable-until-2020-1.3218290?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fstrong-corporate-tax-receipts-sustainable-until-2020-1.3218290|title=Strong corporate tax receipts ‘sustainable’ until 2020| publisher=[[Irish Times]]|date=12 September 2017|author=Eoin Burke-Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt; but caveated that given the concentration of CT revenues to a handful of U.S. multinationals, a shock to Ireland's CT revenues is "inevitalbe".&lt;ref name="cf1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ireland-in-line-for-shock-over-business-tax-q9zpc2d3b|title=Ireland in line for shock over business tax|date=17 May 2018|publisher=[[The Sunday Times]]|author=Peter O'Dwyer|quote=Ireland is putting “all its eggs in one basket” through its growing reliance on international multinationals, and a shock to corporation tax receipts is unavoidable, a leading economist has warned.  Seamus Coffey, the author of a report on corporation tax published last year, warned that Ireland’s dependence on revenue from this source from foreign companies was “way out of line” with that of all other EU member states.  He identified Ireland as the only EU country in which more than half of corporation tax came from overseas companies and said that this was because of their relatively larger presence than in other member states.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cf2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/shock-to-ireland-s-corporation-tax-base-inevitable-1.3497421|title=Shock to Ireland’s corporation tax base ‘inevitable’|date=17 May 2018|publisher=Irish Times|author=Eoin Burke-Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Q2 2018, an IMF country report on Ireland, while noting the significant exposure of Ireland's economy to U.S. corporates, concluded that the TCJA may not be as effective as Washington expects in countering Ireland as a U.S. corporate tax haven. In writing its report, the IMF conducted confidential anonymous interviews with Irish corporate tax experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/CR/2018/cr18195.ashx|title=IRELAND SELECTED ISSUES Section E: The U.S. Tax Reform|pages=27–33|publisher=IMF|date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in June 2018, the former IMF mission-chief for Ireland [[Ashoka Mody]], who oversaw Ireland's bailout during the 2009–22012 Irish financial crisis, warned that in relation to TCJA:

The following are the historical rates of Irish corporation tax since 1994.&lt;ref name="his2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eandy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coffey2"/&gt;

A '''special rate''' of 10% for companies in manufacturing (and the [[Shannon Free Zone]]), was introduced in 1980–81 (with EU State-aid approval), and extended to the financial services in the [[International Financial Services Centre]] (IFSC) zone in 1987 (with EU State-aid approval); due to EU decision to withdraw EU State-aid approval in 1996–1998,&lt;ref name="dof1"/&gt; the special rate was phased-out and ended on 31 December 2003 for new schemes, with expiry for all existing IFSC schemes in 2005, and all existing manufacturing schemes by 2010.  To counter the EU's decision to withdraw State-aid approval for Ireland's special rate,  the Irish State reduced the Irish ''standard rate'' of corporation tax from 40% in 1995, to 12.5% by 2003; splitting the standard rate into trading and non-trading rates in 2000.&lt;ref name="dof1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120125054/http://www.revenue.ie/en/business/incentives/tax-incentives-investors-ireland.html | title=10% rate of Corporation Tax for Manufacturing Enterprises | publisher=[[Revenue Commissioners]] | access-date=17 November 2018 | quote=A 10% rate of corporation tax is applied to income from the sale of goods manufactured by a company in the State.

Existing operations which are eligible for the 10% rate will retain entitlement to this rate until the end of the year 2010 in the case of manufacturing.  New projects established after 22 July 1998 in manufacturing will be eligible for the 10% rate in respect of their activities until 31 December 2002, after which they will then be subject to the 12.5% rate.

==History of system==

Ireland's corporate tax code has gone through distinct phases of development, from building a separate dentify from the British system, to most distinctively, post the creation of the Irish [[International Financial Services Centre]] ("IFSC") in 1987, becoming a "low tax" knowlegdge based (i.e. focus intgangible assets) multinational economy.&lt;ref name="eandy"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.budget.gov.ie/Budgets/2015/Documents/EY_Historical_Dev_International_Context_Irish_%20Corporation_Tax.pdf|title= The historical development and international context of the Irish corporate tax system (Ernst &amp; Young).|publisher=Department of Finance|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has not been without controversy and complaint from both Ireland's EU partners,&lt;ref name="aa2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-corporate-tax-rate-davos-stealing-3817678-Jan2018/| title='That's a joke', 'stealing': Ireland's low corporate tax rate criticised at Davos| publisher=thejournal.ie|date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aa1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/several-of-ireland-s-top-companies-pay-as-little-as-1-in-tax-1.3238360?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fseveral-of-ireland-s-top-companies-pay-as-little-as-1-in-tax-1.3238360| title=Several of Ireland’s top companies pay as little as 1% in tax| publisher=Irish Times|date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aa3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/luxembourg-blasts-rate-of-corporation-tax-in-ireland-467927.html| title=Luxembourg PM blasts Ireland's low corporate tax Rate| publisher=The Irish Examiner|date=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also from the US (whose multinationals, for specific reasons, comprise almost all of the major foreign multinationals in Ireland).&lt;ref name="aa4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/joseph-stiglitz-cheating-ireland-muddled-europe-1.2776981?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fjoseph-stiglitz-cheating-ireland-muddled-europe-1.2776981| title=Joseph Stiglitz: ‘Cheating’ Ireland, muddled Europe|publisher=The Irish Examiner|date=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-independence under Cumann na nGaedheal===
It was only with the acceptance of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] by both the [[Dáil]] and [[British House of Commons]] in 1922 that the mechanisms of a truly independent state begin to emerge in the [[Irish Free State]]. In keeping with many other decisions of the newly independent state the [[Irish Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] and later the Free State government continued with the same practices and policies of the iriash administration with regard to corporate taxation.

This continuation meant that the British system of "corporate profits taxation" ("CPT") in addition to [[income tax]] on the profits of firms was kept. The CPT was a relatively new innovation in the United Kingdom and had only been introduced in the years after [[World War I]], and was widely believed at the time to have been a temporary measure. However, the system of firms being taxed firstly through income taxed and then through the CPT was to remain until the late seventies and the introduction of Corporation Tax, which combined the income and corporation profits tax in one.

During the years of [[W. T. Cosgrave]]'s governments, the principal aim with regard to fiscal policy was to reduce expenditure and follow that with similar reductions in taxation. This policy of tax reduction did not extend to the rate of the CPT, but companies did benefit from two particular measures of the Cosgrave government. Firstly, and probably the achievement of which the [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] administration was most proud, was the reduction by 50% in the rate of income tax from 6 shillings in the pound to 3 shillings. While this measure benefited all income earners, be they private individuals or incorporated companies, a number of adjustments in the Finance Acts, culminating in 1928, increased the allowance on which firms were not subject to taxation under the CPT. This allowance was increased from £500, the rate at the time of independence, to £10,000 in 1928. This measure was in part to compensate Irish firms for the continuation of the CPT after it has been abolished in the United Kingdom.

A measure which marked the last years of the Cumann na nGaedheal government, and one that was out of kilter with their general free trade policy, but which came primarily as a result of [[Fianna Fáil]] pressure over the 'protection' of Irish industry, was the introduction of a higher rate of CPT for foreign firms. This measure survived until 1948, when the [[Government of the 13th Dáil|Inter-Party government]] rescinded it, as many countries with which the government was attempting to come to double taxation treaties viewed it as discriminatory.

===Fianna Fáil under Éamon de Valera===

The near twenty years of Fianna Fáíl government between from 1931 to 1948, cannot be said to have been a time where much effort was expended on changing or analysing the taxation system of corporations. Indeed, only one policy sticks out during those year of Fianna Fáil rule; being the continued reduction in the level of the allowance on which firms were to be exempt from taxation under the CPT, from £10,000 when Cumman na nGaehael left office, to £5,000 in 1932 and finally to £2,500 in 1941. The impact of this can be seen in the increasing importance of CPT as a percentage of government revenue, rising from and less than 1% of tax revenue in the first decade of the Free State to 3.64% in the decade 1942–43 to 1951–52. This increase in revenue from the CPT was due to more firms being in the tax net, as well as the reduction in allowances. The increased tax net can be seen from the fact that between 1932–33 and 1938–39, the number of firms paying CPT increased by over 33%. One other aspect of the Fianna Fáil government which bears all the fingerprints of [[Seán Lemass]], was the 1946 decision to allow mining companies to write off all capital expenditure against tax over five years.

===Seán Lemass and an Irish tax system===

The period between after the late 1950s and up to the mid-1970s can be viewed as a period of radical change in the evolution of the Irish Corporate Taxations system. The increasing realisation of the government that Ireland would be entering into an age of increasing free trade encouraged a number of reforms of the tax system. By the mid-1970s, a number of amendments, additions and changes had been made to the CPT, these included fifteen-year tax holidays for exporting firms, the decision by the government to allow full depreciation in 1971 and in 1973, and the Section 34 of the Finance Act, which allowed total tax relief in respect of royalties and other income from licenses patented in Ireland.

This period from c.1956 to c.1975, is probably the most influential on the evolution of the Irish corporate tax system and marked the development of an 'Irish' corporate tax system, rather than continuing with a version of the British model.

This period saw the creation of Corporation Tax, which combined the Capital Gains, Income and Corporation Profits Tax that firms previously had to pay. Future changes to the corporate tax system, such as the measures implemented by various governments over the last twenty years can be seen as a continuation of the policies of this period. The introduction in 1981 of the 10% tax on manufacturing was simply the easiest way to adjust to the demands of the EEC to abolish the export relief, which the EEC viewed as discriminatory. With the accession to the EEC, the advantages of this policy became increasingly obvious to both the Irish government and to foreign multi-nationals; by 1982 over 80% of companies who located in Ireland cited the taxation policy as the primary reason they did so.

===Charles Haughey low-tax economy (1987–2009)===
{{related article|International Financial Services Centre#History}}
{{related article|Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)}}
The Irish [[International Financial Services Centre]] ("IFSC") was created in Dubin in 1987 by Taoiseach [[Charles Haughey]] with an EU approved 10% [[special economic zone]] corporate tax rate for global financial firms within its 11-hectare site.  The creation of the IFSC is often considered the birth of the [[Celtic Tiger]] and the driver of its first phase of growth in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="his3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance-magazine.com/display_article.php?i=2300&amp;pi=142|title=Dermot Desmond on the IFSC past and future|publisher=Finance Dublin|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="his4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance-magazine.com/display_article.php?i=2304&amp;pi=142|title=Milestones of the IFSC|publisher=Finance Dublin|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to EU pressure to phase out the 10% IFSC rate by the end 2005, the overall Irish corporation tax was reduced to 12.5% on trading income, from 32%, effectively turning the entire Irish country into an IFSC.&lt;ref name="eandy"/&gt; This gave the second boost to the [[Celtic Tiger]] from 2000 up until the Irish economic crisis in 2009.&lt;ref name="his1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budget.gov.ie/Budgets/2015/Documents/EY_Historical_Dev_International_Context_Irish_%20Corporation_Tax.pdf | title= History of the Irish Corporate Tax System | publisher=Ernst and Young|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="his2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/committees/finance/Report---Global-Corporate-Taxation-Final.pdf | title=Report on Ireland’s Relationship with Global Corporate Taxation Architecture | publisher=[[Department of Finance (Ireland)]]| date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1998 Budget (in December 1997) Finance Minister, [[Charlie McCreevy]]&lt;ref name="eandy"/&gt; introduced the legislation for a new regime of corporation tax that led to the introduction of the 12.5% rate of corporation tax for trading income from 1 January 2003.  The legislation was contained in section 71 of the Finance Act 1999 and provided for a phased introduction of the 12.5% rate from 32% for the financial year 1998 to 12.5% commencing from 1 January 2003.  A higher rate of corporation tax of 25% was introduced for [[passive income]], income from a foreign trade and some development and mining activities.  Manufacturing relief, effectively a 10% rate of corporation tax, was ended on 31 December 2002.  For companies that were claiming this relief before 23 July 1998, it would still be available until 31 January 2010.  The 10% rate for IFSC activities ended on 31 December 2005 and after this date, these companies moved to the 12.5% rate provided their trade qualified as an Irish trading activity.

The additional passing of the important Irish Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 (“TCA”) by [[Charlie McCreevy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/39/enacted/en/html|title=Taxes and Consolidation Act 1997|publisher=Irish Government|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; laid the foundation for the new vehicles and structures that would become used by IFSC law and accounting firms to help global multinationals use Ireland as a platform to avoid non-US taxes (and even the 12.5% Irish corporate tax rate).  These vehicles would become famous as the [[Double Irish]], [[Double Irish#Replacement by single malt|Single Malt]] and the [[Double Irish#Backstop of capital allowances|Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets]] tax arrangements.  The Act also created the [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)| Irish Section 110 SPV]], which would make the [[International Financial Services Centre|IFSC]] the largest securitisation location in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/ireland-is-top-eurozone-jurisdiction-for-secretive-spvs-36047198.html|title=Ireland is top Eurozone jurisdiction for SPVs|publisher=Irish Independent|date=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post crisis zero-tax economy (2009–2018)===

The Irish financial crises created unprecedented forces in the Economy.  Irish banks, the largest domestic corporate taxpayers, faced insolvency, while Irish public and private debt-to-GDP metrics approached the highest levels in the OECD.  The Irish Government needed foreign capital to re-balance their overleveraged economy.  Directly, and indirectly, they amended many Irish corporate tax structures from 2009-2015 to effectively make them "zero-tax" structures for foreign multinationals and foreign investors. The US [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] ("BEA") "effective" Irish CT rate, fell to 2.5%.&lt;ref name="ct2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="his2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wwz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wwx"/&gt;

They materially expanded the [[double Irish arrangement#Backstop of capital allowances|capital allowances for intangible assets]] scheme in the 2009 Finance Act.  This would encourage US multinationals to locate [[intellectual property]] assets in Ireland (as opposed to the Caribbean, as per the [[double Irish]] scheme), which would albeit artificially, raise Irish economic statistics to improve Ireland's "headline" Debt-to-GDP metric.  They also indirectly, allowed US distressed debt funds to use the [[Irish Section 110 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)|Irish Section 110 SPV]] to enable them to avoid Irish taxes on the circa €100bn of domestic Irish assets they bought from NAMA (and other financial institutions) from 2012-2016.

While these [[base erosion and profit shifting|BEPS]] schemes were successful in capital, they had downsides.  US multinational tax schemes lead to large distortions in Irish GNI/GNP/GDP statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/europe-points-finger-at-ireland-over-tax-avoidance-1.3417948|title=Europe points finger at Ireland over tax avoidance|publisher=Irish Times|date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Apple "onshored" their ASI subsidiary in January 2015, it caused Irish GDP to rise 26.3% in one quarter ("[[leprechaun economics]]").  Foreign multinationals were now 80% of corporate taxes, and concentrated in a smaller group.&lt;ref name="ct1"/&gt;  In response, the Government introduced "[[Modified gross national income|modified GNI]]" (or GNI*) in 2017, which was circa 40% below 2017 Irish GDP, and a paired back of some BEPS schemes to improve corporation tax sustainability.&lt;ref name="coffey1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coffey2"/&gt;

Ireland's [[base erosion and profit shifting|BEPS]] tax strategy led it to become labelled as one of the top 5 global [[Conduit and Sink OFCs|conduit OFCs]], and has come under attack from the US&lt;ref name="aa4"/&gt; and the EU (Apple's largest tax fine in history).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2923_en.htm|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - State aid: Ireland gave illegal tax benefits to Apple worth up to €13 billion|last=|first=|date=30 August 2016|website=europa.eu|publisher=|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under pressure from the EU,&lt;ref name="roy1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Ireland closed down the [[double Irish]] in 2015, which was described as the largest tax avoidance scheme in history.  However, Ireland replaced it with the new [[Double Irish arrangement#Replacement by single malt|single malt]] system,&lt;ref name="sm1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sm2"/&gt; and an expanded [[double Irish arrangement#Backstop of capital allowances|capital allowances]] scheme.  More targeted responses have come in the form of the US 2017 [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|TCJA]] (esp. FDII and GILTI rates), and the EU's 2018 impending Digital Services Tax.

The '''fathers' rights movement''' is a movement whose members are primarily interested in issues related to [[family law]], including [[child custody]] and [[child support]] that affect fathers and their [[child]]ren.&lt;ref name=Collier2006&gt;[[#FRALR|Collier &amp; Sheldon]], 2006, p. 1–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=collier&gt;{{cite news |last1=Collier |first1=R. |last2=Sheldon |first2=S. |title=Unfamiliar territory: The issue of a father's rights and responsibilities covers more than just the media-highlighted subject of access to his children |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2006-11-01 |url=http://society.guardian.co.uk/children/story/0,,1935970,00.html |accessdate=2007-10-17 |location=London |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520124643/http://society.guardian.co.uk/children/story/0%2C%2C1935970%2C00.html |archivedate=20 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its members are fathers who desire to share the parenting of their children equally with their children's mothers—either after [[divorce]] or as unwed fathers—and the children of the terminated marriage. The movement includes men as well as women, often the second wives of divorced fathers or other family members of men who have had some engagement with [[family law]].&lt;ref name=Collier2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaye&gt;{{cite journal | last =Kaye | first =Miranda |last2=Tolmie |first2=Julia | title =Fathers' Rights Groups in Australia and their Engagement with Issues in Family Law | journal =Australian Journal of Family Law | volume =12 | pages = 19–68 | year =1998 | url =http://sisyphe.org/IMG/doc/doc-656.doc |accessdate=2007-03-24 |format=Doc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crowley"/&gt;

Most of its members had little prior interest in the law or politics. However, as they felt that their goal of equal-shared parenting was being frustrated by the family courts, many took an interest in family law, including child custody and child support.&lt;ref name=Collier2006/&gt;&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Many Women in Civil Rights Movement"/&gt;

The movement has received international press coverage as a result of high-profile activism of their members.&lt;ref name=Collier2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt; It has become increasingly vocal, visible and organised, and has played a powerful role in family law debates.&lt;ref name=Collier2006 /&gt;

The fathers' rights movement has both liberal and conservative branches, with different viewpoints about how men and women compare. Although both groups agree on the victimization and discrimination against men, they disagree on why men and women differ ([[nature versus nurture]]) and traditional [[gender role]]s. The liberal version believes the differences between the sexes are due to culture and supports equality between men and women; in contrast, the conservative branch believes in traditional [[patriarchy|patriarchal]]/[[Complementarianism|complementary]] families and that the differences [[Gender differences|between genders are due to biology]].&lt;ref name="williams2"&gt;{{cite book | last = Williams | first =GI | title = Historical and Multicultural Encyclopedia of Women's Reproductive Rights in the United States | publisher = [[Greenwood Press]] | year = 2002| pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZKVzULJ–764C&amp;pg=PA81 81–83] | chapter = Fathers' Rights Movement|isbn=978-0-313-30644-0|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gavanas04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite book | last = Williams | first = GI |last2=Williams |first2=RH | title = Social Problems: Constructionist Readings | editor-last = Loseke |editor-first=DR |editor-last2=Best |editor-first2=J | publisher = Aldine Transaction | year = 2003 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=BXIspcMwljIC&amp;pg=PA93 93–100] | chapter = Framing in the Fathers' Rights Movement | isbn = 978-0-202-30703-9 | url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross Parke and Armin Brott view the fathers' rights movement as one of three strands within the [[men's movement]] that deal almost exclusively with fatherhood, the other two being the good fathers' movement and groups forming the Christian Men's movement – the [[Promise Keepers]] being the largest.&lt;ref name=Parke1999&gt;[[#Parke1999|Parke]], 1999, p.

[[Warren Farrell]], a veteran of the women's, men's and fathers' movement since the 1970s, describes the fathers' rights movement as part of a larger "gender transition movement" and thinks that, similar to women in the 1960s, fathers are transitioning from gender-based to more flexible family roles. Farrell also believes the movement helps children by increasing the number who are raised equally by both parents, which in turn increases the children's social, academic, psychological, and physical benefits—in his opinion it becomes a [[children's rights]] issue with fathers acting as advocates.&lt;ref name=Farrell2001/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2010}}

Fathers' rights groups also provide emotional and practical support for members during separation and divorce.&lt;ref name=Collier2006/&gt;

Some fathers' rights groups have become frustrated with the slow pace of traditional campaigning for law reform; groups such as the originally UK-based ''[[Fathers 4 Justice]]'' have become increasingly vocal and visible, undertaking public demonstrations that have attracted public attention and influenced the politics of family justice.&lt;ref name=fralr3/&gt; Following protests, some fathers' rights activists have been convicted of offenses such as harassment and assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Main issues==

===Family court system===
{{See also|Family law}}

[[Stephen Baskerville]] is an associate professor of political science, president of the [[American Coalition of Fathers and Children]] and fathers' rights advocate and defines court-determined custody as not a right to parent one's children but as the power to prevent the other partner from parenting.&lt;ref name=Baskerville&gt;[[#Baskerville 2007|Baskerville]], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the fathers' rights movement state that family courts are biased against fathers and shared custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Select Committee on Constitutional Affairs Fourth Report | publisher = House of Commons, Parliament UK | date = 2005-02-23 | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmconst/116/116we23.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Operation of the Family Courts | publisher = House of Commons Constitutional Affairs Committee Family Justice | date = 2004-11-08 | format = pdf | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmconst/116/116ii.pdf | accessdate = 2007-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baskerville states that the outcome of divorce is overly one-sided and is initiated by mothers in more than two-thirds of cases – especially when children are involved. He also states that divorce provides advantages for women such as automatic custody of the children and financial benefits in the form of child support payments.&lt;ref name="Divorce as revolution"&gt;{{cite magazine | last = Baskerville | first = S | title = Divorce as Revolution | magazine = The Salisbury Review | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | year = 2003 | url = http://www.fatherhoodcoalition.org/cpf/newreadings/2003/Divorce_as_Revolution_SBsum03.htm | accessdate = 2008-11-10 | date =  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070403030149/http://www.fatherhoodcoalition.org/cpf/newreadings/2003/Divorce_as_Revolution_SBsum03.htm | archive-date = 3 April 2007 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the FR movement also state that family courts are slow to help fathers enforce their parental rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Sacks | first = G | last2 = Brass | first2 = R | title = National Fatherhood Initiative's Ad Campaign Insults African-American Fathers | newspaper = Daily Breeze | location = Torrance, Calif. | date = 2004-05-25 | url = http://www.glennsacks.com/national_fatherhood_initiative_ads.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-14 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070328054904/http://www.glennsacks.com/national_fatherhood_initiative_ads.htm | archivedate = 28 March 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New research shows bias in restraining orders"&gt;{{cite web | last = Charalambous | first = M | title = New research shows bias in restraining orders | publisher = The Fatherhood Coalition | date = 2005-07-10 | url = http://www.fatherhoodcoalition.org/cpf/newreadings/2005/MC_Gardner_Study-2_050710.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-14 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927103948/http://www.fatherhoodcoalition.org/cpf/newreadings/2005/MC_Gardner_Study-2_050710.htm | archive-date = 27 September 2007 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are expensive and time-consuming.&lt;ref name="Government and Fatherlessness"&gt;{{cite book | last = Baskerville | first = S | title = The Fatherhood Crisis: Time for a New Look | publisher = National Center for Policy Analysis | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-56808-136-7 | url = http://www.ncpa.org/pub/st/st267/st267.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-03-18 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061213061316/http://www.ncpa.org/pub/st/st267/st267.pdf | archivedate = 13 December 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baskerville has also stated that family courts are secretive, censoring and punitive towards fathers who criticize them.&lt;ref name=Baskerville/&gt; He also claims that employees and activists within the courts support and benefit from the separation of children from their parents&lt;ref name="Politics of Fatherhood - S. Baskerville"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Baskerville | first = S | title = The Politics of Fatherhood | journal = Political Science and Politics | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | year = 2002 | url = http://www.childrensjustice.org/politics-fatherhood.html | accessdate = 2007-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that family law today represents civil rights abuses and intrusive perversion of government power.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others{{who|date=December 2012}} contest these conclusions, stating that family courts are biased in favor of fathers{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} and that the lower percentage of separated fathers as custodial parents is a result of choices made by fathers rather than bias of family courts.&lt;ref name="Separation Divorce and Remarriage"&gt;{{cite book | last = Baker | first = M | title = Families, labour and love: family diversity in a changing world | publisher = UBC Press | location = Vancouver, B.C., Canada | year = 2001 | pages = 198–9 | isbn = 0-7748-0848-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to sociologist [[Michael Flood]], father's rights activists have exaggerated the disparity in custody awards between mothers and fathers, and ignored the fact that in the vast majority of cases, fathers voluntarily relinquish custody of their children through private arrangements; either because they are willing to do so, or because they do not expect a favorable court ruling.&lt;ref name=Rossi2004&gt;{{cite book|last=Rossi|first=Stacey Elin|title=The Battle and Backlash Rage On: Why Feminism Cannot be Obsolete|year=2004|publisher=Xlibris|location=New York|isbn=1-4134-5934-X|pages=261–278}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shared parenting===
{{Main|Child custody|shared parenting|best interests}}
Stating that "children need two parents" and that "children have a fundamental human right to an opportunity and relationship with both their mother and father", members of the fathers' rights movement call for greater equality in parental responsibility following separation and divorce.&lt;ref name="The first article"&gt;{{cite news | last = Parkin | first = K | date = 1974-06-12 | title = Fathers need their families | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | url = http://www.fnf.org.uk/about-us/the-first-article | accessdate = 2008-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shared Parenting Council"&gt;{{cite web | title = Shared Parenting Council | publisher = Shared Parenting Council | url = http://www.familylawwebguide.com.au/spca/index.php?page= | accessdate = 2008-11-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081004094739/http://www.familylawwebguide.com.au/spca/index.php?page= | archivedate = 4 October 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They call for laws creating a [[rebuttable presumption]] of 50/50 shared custody after divorce or separation, so that children would spend equal time with each parent unless there were reasons against it.&lt;ref name="Ottaman"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ottman | first = Ana |last2=Lee |first2=Rebekah | title = Encyclopedia of Interpersonal Violence | editor-last=Edleson |editor-first=Jeffrey L. |editor-last2=Renzetti |editor-first2=Claire M. | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]] | year = 2008 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=BOKAMXEA_jQC&amp;pg=PA252 252] | chapter = Fathers' rights movement | isbn = 978-1-4129-1800-8 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They point to studies showing that children in shared custody settings are better adjusted and have fewer social problems such as low academic achievement, crime, pregnancy, substance abuse, depression and suicide,&lt;ref name="Politics of Fatherhood - S.

Members of the fathers' rights movement and their critics disagree about the correlation of negative developmental outcomes for children to sole custody situations. Social scientist V. C. McLoyd states that father absence covaries with other relevant family characteristics such as the lack of an income from a male adult, the absence of a second adult, and the lack of support from a second extended family system and conclude that it is the negative effects of poverty, and not the absence of a father, that result in negative developmental outcomes.&lt;ref name="Father Absent Homes"&gt;{{cite journal | last = McLoyd |first=VC | title = Socioeconomic disadvantage and child development | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 185–204 |date=February 1998 | pmid = 9491747 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.53.2.185 | url = http://content.apa.org/journals/amp/53/2/185}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Professor Craig Hart states that although the consequences of poverty and having a single parent are interrelated, each is a risk factor with independent effects on children,&lt;ref name="Shared Parenting Research"&gt;{{cite web | last = Hart | first = CH | title = Combating the Myth that Parents Don't Matter | publisher = The Howard Center for Family Religion and Society | year = 1999 | url = http://www.worldcongress.org/wcf2_spkrs/wcf2_hart.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070211235613/http://www.worldcongress.org/wcf2_spkrs/wcf2_hart.htm | archivedate = 11 February 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Silverstein and Auerbach state that the negative outcomes for children in sole custody situations correlate more strongly to "fatherlessness" than to any other variable including poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Deconstructing the Essential Father | publisher = SPARC | url = http://www.deltabravo.net/custody/deconstruct.php | accessdate = 2007-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Is there really a fatherhood crisis?"/&gt;

Members of the fathers' rights movement criticize the [[best interests]] of the child standard currently used in many countries for making custody decisions, which they describe as highly subjective and based on the personal prejudices of family court judges and court-appointed child custody evaluators,&lt;ref name="Fathers &amp; Families Comment on NYT article"&gt;{{cite web | title = New York Times Press Gives Major Press Coverage for Fathers | publisher = Fathers &amp; Families | date = 2005-05-08 | url = http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/site/news.php?id=54 | accessdate = 2007-05-27 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070828231255/http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/site/news.php?id=54 | archivedate = 28 August 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Children's rights"&gt;{{cite web | last = Schlafly | first = Phyllis | authorlink = Phyllis Schlafly | title = Children's rights should include life with both parents | date = 2007-07-23 | url = http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=21639 | accessdate = 2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fatherphobia"&gt;{{cite news | last = Schlafly | first = Phyllis | authorlink = Phyllis Schlafly | title = The Fatherphobia of Family Courts | date = 2005-02-02 | url = http://www.eagleforum.org/column/2005/feb05/05-02-02.html | accessdate = 2007-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Family Feud"&gt;{{cite web | last = Newdow | first = M | title = Family Feud | publisher = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date = 2004-06-18 | url = http://www.slate.com/id/2102650/ | accessdate = 2007-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that courts are abusive when more than half custody is taken away from a willing, competent parent.&lt;ref name="ACFC Appeal to Parents"&gt;{{cite web | title = An Appeal to the Parents of America about the Destruction of the American Family | publisher = [[American Coalition of Fathers and Children]] | url = http://www.acfc.org/site/DocServer/ACFC2saved.pdf?docID=181 | format = pdf | accessdate = 2007-03-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070508050549/http://www.acfc.org/site/DocServer/ACFC2saved.pdf?docID=181 | archivedate = 8 May 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the fathers' rights movement including Ned Holstein state that a rebuttable presumption of shared parenting is supported by a majority of citizens.&lt;ref name="F&amp;F Testimony"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Fathers &amp; Families | title = Testimony in Support of an Act Relative to Shared Parenting | date = 2003-09-25 | url = http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/Publications/Test%20HB%202464%20Custody.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-10-14 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071026184257/http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/Publications/Test%20HB%202464%20Custody.pdf | archivedate = 26 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baskerville writes that proposals to enact shared parenting laws are opposed by divorce lawyers, and he says that "radical feminist" groups oppose shared parenting because of the possibility of domestic violence and child abuse.&lt;ref name="Taken Into Custody 303"&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p.21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Baskerville states that shared parenting has been demonstrated to reduce parental conflict by requiring parents to cooperate and compromise, and that it is the lack of constraint by one parent resulting from the ability of that parent to exclude the other, that results in increased parental conflict.&lt;ref name="Taken Into Custody 305"&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Seltzer |first=Judith | title = Father by Law: Effects of Joint Legal Custody on Nonresident Fathers' Involvement With Children | journal = Demography | volume = 35| issue = 2 | date = May 1998 | pmid = 9622777 | pages = 135–46 | doi=10.2307/3004047}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further states that only when child support guidelines exceed true costs do parents ask for or seek to prevent changes in parenting time for financial reasons, adding that any argument that a parent is asking for increased parenting time to reduce child support is at the same time an argument that the other parent is making a profit from child support.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report | title = Child Cost Economics and Litigation Issues: An Introduction to Applying Cost Shares Child Support Guidelines | author = R.

Stephen Baskerville describes no-fault or unilateral divorce based on no fault as a power grab by the parent that initiates the divorce and he also states that fathers have a constitutional right to shared control of their children and through political action they intend to establish parental authority for both parents and for the well-being of their children.&lt;ref name="Divorced From Reality"&gt;{{cite web | title = Divorced From Reality | publisher = [[Touchstone (magazine)|Touchstone]] | date = January 2009 | url=http://touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=22-01-019-f | accessdate = 2010-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parental Authority"&gt;{{cite web |author=Stephen Baskerville | title = Fathers' Rights Are Fathers' Duties | publisher = FatherMag.Com | date = 1998–2000 | url = http://www.fathermag.com/803/action/ | accessdate = 2007-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the fathers' rights movement state that a rebuttable presumption for shared parenting preserves a child's protection against unfit or violent parents.&lt;ref name="F&amp;F Position Paper"&gt;{{cite web | title = Position Paper of Fathers &amp; Families | publisher = Fathers &amp; Families | year = 2007 | url = http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/Publications/Legislation/2007_HB1460_SB994_Position_Paper_Shared_Parenting.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-10-06 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071028142738/http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/Publications/Legislation/2007_HB1460_SB994_Position_Paper_Shared_Parenting.pdf | archivedate = 28 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pro-feminist]] sociologist [[Michael Flood]] states that supporters of shared parenting use it only as a symbolic issue related to "rights", "equality", and "fairness" and that the father's rights movement is not actually interested in the shared care of their children or the children's wishes, adding that fathers' rights groups have advocated policies and strategies that are harmful to mothers and children and also harmful to the fathers themselves.&lt;ref name="flood"&gt;{{cite conference | first = M | last = Flood | title = Separated Fathers and the Fathers' Rights Movement | booktitle = Feminism, Law and the Family Workshop | publisher = Law School, University of Melbourne | date =  | url = http://www.xyonline.net/downloads/Supportingseparatedfath.doc | format = DOC | accessdate = 2007-03-12 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070207223803/http://www.xyonline.net/downloads/Supportingseparatedfath.doc | archivedate = 7 February 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, social scientist [[Sanford Braver]] states that the bad divorced dad image is a myth that has led to harmful and dangerous social policies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child support===
{{See also|Child support|paternity fraud}}
Members of the fathers' rights movement campaign for the reform of child support guidelines, which in most Western countries are based on maintaining the children's standard of living after separation, and on the assumption that the children live with one parent and never with the other.&lt;ref name="Fathers Are Capable Too - Comments on Child Support Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web | title = Comments on the Child Support Guidelines | publisher = F.A.C.T.

Morgan has stated that it focuses on the relative living standards of divorcing parents rather than the best interests of the children and financially supporting them at the same level after divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Morgan | first = LW | title = The "Cost Share" model of child support guidelines | date = 2005-02-15 | url = http://www.supportguidelines.com/articles/art200407.html | accessdate = 2007-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solangel Maldonado states that the law should value a broader definition of fathering for poor fathers by reducing the focus on collecting child support and encouraging the informal contributions (such as groceries, clothes, toys, time with the children) of these fathers by counting these contributions as child support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Maldonado | first = S | title = Deadbeat or Deadbroke: Redefining Child Support for Poor Fathers | year = 2006 | url = http://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/Vol39/Issue3/DavisVol39No3_MALDONADO.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-06-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090306021547/http://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/Vol39/Issue3/DavisVol39No3_MALDONADO.pdf | archivedate = 6 March 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the fathers' rights movement state that child support should be terminated under certain conditions, such as if the custodial parent limits access to the children by moving away against the wishes of the other parent, gives fraudulent testimony, or if paternity fraud is discovered,&lt;ref name="Recommendations for Child Support Guideline Revisement"&gt;{{cite web | title = Recommendations for Child Support Guideline Revisement June 2001 | date = June 2001 | url = http://www.fatherhoodcoalition.org/cpf/2001/CSGuidelineRecommendations2001.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-15 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070406095103/http://fatherhoodcoalition.org/cpf/2001/CSGuidelineRecommendations2001.htm | archive-date = 6 April 2007 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; adding that two men should not have to pay child support for the same child.&lt;ref name="Fathers Are Capable Too - Comments on Child Support Guidelines"/&gt;

Stephen Baskerville states that it is often difficult for fathers in financial hardship or who take on a larger caregiving role with their children to have their child support payments lowered. He also states that unemployment is the primary cause of child support arrears, and further states that these arrearages make the father subject to arrest and imprisonment without due process.&lt;ref name="Is there really a fatherhood crisis?"&gt;{{cite web | last = Baskerville | first = S | title = Is There Really A Fatherhood Crisis? | publisher = The Independent Institute | year = 2004 | url = http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?issueID=13&amp;articleID=35 | accessdate = 2007-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Baskerville states that the purpose of child support should be publicly determined, and enforcement programs must be designed to serve that purpose, observing the due process of law.&lt;ref name=Baskerville2007298/&gt;

Supporters of the fathers' rights movement assert that some women make false claims of domestic violence, sexual or child abuse in order to gain an upper hand in divorce, custody disputes and/or prevent fathers from seeing their children, and they state that lawyers advise women to make such claims.&lt;ref name="gavanas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fatherphobia"/&gt; They state that false claims of domestic violence and child abuse are encouraged by the inflammatory "win or lose" nature of child custody hearings, that men are presumed to be guilty rather than innocent by police and by the courts,&lt;ref name="Recommendations for Child Support Guideline Revisement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Controlling DV Against Men"&gt;{{cite web | title = Controlling Domestic Violence Against Men|last1=Corry|first1=CE|last2=Fiebert|first2= MS|last3=Pizzey|first3= E| publisher = Equal Justice Foundation | year = 2002 | url = http://www.ejfi.org/DV/dv-9.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers and advocates for abused women assert that family court proceedings are commonly accompanied with allegations of domestic violence because of the prevalence of domestic violence in society rather than as a result of false allegations of domestic violence. They also assert that domestic violence often begins or increases around the time of divorce or separation.&lt;ref name=" Ottaman"/&gt; Academic critic, Michael Flood, argues that fathers' rights groups have had a damaging impact on the field of domestic violence programming and policy by attempting to discredit female victims of violence, to wind back the legal protections available to victims and the sanctions imposed on perpetrators, and to undermine services for the victims of men's violence.&lt;ref name="Flood"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Flood | first = Michael | year = 2010 | title = ‘Fathers' Rights' and the Defense of Paternal Authority in Australia | journal = Violence Against Women | publisher = Sage | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 328–347 | url = http://www.xyonline.net/content/fathers-rights-and-defence-paternal-authority-australia | doi=10.1177/1077801209360918}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Baskerville asserts that when child abuse occurs the perpetrator is not likely to be the father, and that child abuse most often occurs after the father has been separated from his children.&lt;ref name="Divorce as revolution"/&gt; Baskerville proposes that domestic violence and child abuse must be adjudicated as criminal assault, observing due process protections, and that government funding for programs addressing these issues must be made contingent on such protections.&lt;ref name=Baskerville2007298/&gt;

===Parenting time interference===
{{See also|Gatekeeper parent|Parental alienation syndrome}}

[[Glenn Sacks]] states that some mothers interfere with the father's parenting time and that such interference should be stopped.&lt;ref name="Parenting Time Interference a problem for dads"&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Thompson | first1 = D | last2 = Sacks | first2 = G | title = Equal Parents Week Highlights Need for Family Court Reform | publisher = GlennSacks.Com | date = 2002-09-26 | url = http://glennsacks.com/equal_parents_week_pf.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061214213644/http://www.glennsacks.com/equal_parents_week_pf.htm | archivedate = 14 December 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sacks and [[Jeffery M.

Fathers' rights activists have also advocated for the inclusion of parental alienation syndrome, a proposed syndrome developed by [[Richard A. Gardner]] that alleges unjustified disruption of the relationship between a parent and a child is caused by the other parent.&lt;ref&gt;

===No-fault divorce===
{{Main|No-fault divorce}}

[[Stephen Baskerville]] states that laws establishing no-fault divorce did not stop at removing the requirement that grounds be cited for a divorce, so as to allow for divorce by "mutual consent"; it also allows either spouse to end the marriage without any agreement or fault by the other.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phyllis Schlafly]] states that no-fault divorce should be referred to as unilateral divorce.&lt;ref name=Keynote&gt;{{cite web | title = Phyllis Schlafly's keynote address | publisher = [[American Coalition of Fathers and Children]] | year = 2006 | url = http://www.acfc.org/media/video/2006nflrc/ka/ka-schlafly.wmv | format = wmv | last = Schlafly | first = P | authorlink = Phyllis Schlafly | accessdate = 2007-05-12 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926002543/http://www.acfc.org/media/video/2006nflrc/ka/ka-schlafly.wmv | archivedate = 26 September 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Baskerville states that laws establishing no-fault divorce can be seen as one of the boldest social experiments in modern history that have effectively ended marriage as a legal contract.&lt;ref name=Baskerville200746&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; He states that it is not possible to form a binding agreement to create a family, adding that government officials can, at the request of one spouse, end a marriage over the objection of the other.&lt;ref name=Baskerville200746/&gt; He states that no-fault divorce has left fathers with no protection against what he describes as the confiscation of their children.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baskerville states that fault has entered through the back door in the form of child custody hearings, and that the forcibly divorced spouse ("defendant") is presumed guilty.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, other members of the fathers' rights movement believe that men fail to get appropriate recognition of their innocence as a result of no-fault divorce.&lt;ref name=kaye/&gt; Baskerville describes a proposed amendment of no-fault divorce laws that would create a [[rebuttable presumption]] that custody of any minor children be awarded to the respondent [who is innocent or does not wish to divorce] regardless of gender. He also notes the predictions of Tim O'Brien, the author of the proposed amendment, who states that the proposed amendment would result in a plummeting divorce rate and reduced negative consequences for children.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Baskerville proposes "reasonable limits" on no-fault divorce when children are involved.&lt;ref name=Baskerville2007298&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the FRM support the end of the no-fault principle in child custody and divorce decisions.&lt;ref name=kaye/&gt;&lt;ref name="khader"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Khader | first = Serene J. | date = October–December 2008 | title = When Equality Justifies Women's Subjection: Luce Irigaray's Critique of Equality and the Fathers' Rights Movement | journal = Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy | publisher = Indiana University Press | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 48–74 | doi = 10.2979/HYP.2008.23.4.48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Cheltenham"&gt;{{cite web | title = Restoring Control over matrimonial and family law | date = September 2004 | url = http://www.ukmm.org.uk/publics/rcomfl/report.htm | publisher = The Cheltenham Group | accessdate = 2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the fathers' rights movement state that the availability of divorce should also be limited.&lt;ref name=kaye/&gt;

===Government involvement===
Stephen Baskerville states that governments throughout the United States and other democracies are engaged, by accident or design, in a campaign against fathers and fatherhood, which in his view, lies at the root of a larger problem that threatens marriage, destroys families, devastates the lives of many children, and undermines [[parents]], [[democracy]] and [[accountability]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, pp. 18, 268, 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Baskerville also states that it is the removal of the father from the family through divorce that initiates problems for which the government is perceived as the solution rather than the problem, and that these problems are then used to justify the continued existence and expansion of the government.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the fathers' rights movement state that modern divorce involves government officials invading parents' private lives, evicting people from their homes, seizing their property, and taking away their children.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baskerville2007|Baskerville]], 2007, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gavanas | first = A | title = Making Men Into Fathers: Men, Masculinities and the Social Politics of Fatherhood | year = 2002 | editor-last = Hobson | editor-first = B | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZHeEA4syMUC&amp;pg=PA220 |page=220 | isbn = 0-511-02952-7 | chapter = The Fatherhood Responsibility Movement: the centrality of marriage, work and male sexuality in reconstructions of masculinity and fatherhood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parental and reproductive rights===
{{Main|Parents' rights movement}}
Fathers' rights advocates have worked for the right of unwed, otherwise fit, fathers to get custody if the mother tries to have their child [[adoption|adopted]] by a third party or if child welfare authorities place the child in [[foster care]].&lt;ref name="williams2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shanley"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shanley |first=Mary Lyndon |title=Making babies, making families: what matters most in an age of reproductive technologies, surrogacy, adoption, and same-sex and unwed parents|publisher=Beacon Press |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3GnloZRnWOAC&amp;pg=PA44 |pages=46–47 |isbn=0-8070-4409-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fathers' rights activists seek a gender-neutral approach in which unwed men and women would have equal rights in adoption issues, an approach that critics state does not sufficiently acknowledge the different biological roles in procreation and pregnancy, and the disparity in society's social and economic structures.&lt;ref name="shanley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-415-91027-7"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fineman |first=Martha |title=The neutered mother, the sexual family, and other twentieth century tragedies |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-415-91027-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2016}} In the US, some states have passed laws to protect the rights of unwed fathers to custody. Courts have increasingly supported these rights, though judges often require evidence that the father has shown interest in, and given financial and emotional support to, the mother during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="williams2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn1-59337-369-4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Godwin |first=Raymond |last2=Beauvais-Godwin |first2=Laura |title=The Complete Adoption Book: Everything You Need to Know to Adopt a Child |publisher=Adams Media Corporation |location=Avon, MA |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=n0BIlzqdvMEC&amp;pg=PA96 |pages=96–97 |isbn=1-59337-369-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fathers' rights advocates have sought the right to prevent women from having an [[abortion]] without the father's consent, on the basis that it is discriminatory for men not to have the ability to participate in a decision to terminate a pregnancy.&lt;ref name="williams2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-7614-7907-4"&gt;{{cite book |publisher =Marshall Cavendish Corporation |title=Sex and Society Volume 2 |author =Marshall Cavendish |year=2009 |isbn=0-7614-7907-4 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=YtsxeWE7VD0C&amp;pg=PA596 |page=596}}&lt;/ref&gt; This option is not supported by any laws in the United States.&lt;ref name=Buchanan2007/&gt; Fathers' rights advocates Jeffrey M.

===Parental leave===
{{Main|Paternity leave}}
Pressure from father's rights groups, among others, have in several countries resulted in gender-neutral program(s) eligible for parental leave. While historically, maternity benefits were given to mothers based on the physical biology of childbirth, including the need to protect the health and financial well-being of the woman and child, parental leave benefits emphasize gender-neutral child-rearing, the benefits of the participation of fathers in children's care, and redress discrimination against men who wish to be involved with their infants.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Maureen, Parental Benefit Policies and the Gendered Division of Labor The Social Service Review, Vol. 71, No. 1 (March 1997), pp. 51–71 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30012606]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-7391-0688-0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reese |first1=Laura A. |last2=Gottfried |first2=Heidi |title=Equity in the workplace: gendering workplace policy analysis |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lexington, Mass |year=2004 |pages= 187–88|isbn=0-7391-0688-0 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dK5p625del8C&amp;pg=PA187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
Some fathers' rights activists object to the term "visitation", which they see as denigrating to their level of authority as parents, and instead prefer the use of "parenting time".&lt;ref&gt;[[#crowley2008|Crowley]], 2008, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Some legal scholars and feminist writers have accused the fathers' rights movement of putting the interests of fathers above the interests of children, for example, by suggesting that it is acceptable for fathers to withdraw child support if they are not given access to their children, or by lobbying for changes in family law that would allegedly heighten children's exposure to abusive fathers, and would allegedly further endanger mothers who are victims of domestic violence.&lt;ref name=Rossi2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaye1998&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaye|first=Miranda|author2=Julia Tolmie|title=Discoursing Dads: The Rhetorical Devices of Fathers' Rights Groups|journal=Melbourne University Law Review|year=1998|volume=22|pages=172–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kelly|last=Behre|date=13 June 2014|title=The Fathers' Rights Movement Undermines Victims of Domestic Violence|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/06/13/fathers-rights-and-womens-equality/the-fathers-rights-movement-undermines-victims-of-domestic-violence|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism is that father's rights activists allegedly incorrectly maintain that the courts are biased against fathers, while in reality the vast majority of cases are settled by private agreement and fathers voluntarily relinquish primary custody of their children, which explains the lower percentage of custodial fathers; and that the "bias" of courts is in favour of the primary caregiver, not mothers per se.&lt;ref name="Separation Divorce and Remarriage" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rossi2004"/&gt;

Researchers [[Martha Fineman]], [[Michael Flood]], and others have criticized the movement for allegedly perpetuating negative stereotypes of women as deceptive, vindictive, and irresponsible, as well as the stereotype that women are out to take advantage of men financially.&lt;ref name=Rossi2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaye1998/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanigsberg|first=Julia E.|title=Mother Troubles: Rethinking Contemporary Maternal Dilemmas|year=1999|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=0-8070-6787-3|page=150|author2=Sara Ruddick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WI Police Dog.jpg|thumb|238px|right|alt=A dog with a police badge attached to its collar|Police dog]]
Oral argument in this case – and that of another dog sniff case, ''[[Florida v. Jardines]]'' – was heard on October 31, 2012. The Court unanimously held that if a bona fide organization has certified a dog after testing his reliability in a controlled setting, or if the dog has recently and successfully completed a training program that evaluated his proficiency, a court can presume (subject to any conflicting evidence offered) that the dog's alert provides probable cause to search, using a "[[totality of the circumstances|totality-of-the-circumstances]]" approach.

==Background==
Prior to this case, the [[United States Supreme Court]] has on three occasions dealt with cases involving "dog sniffs" by detection dogs trained to identify [[narcotics]], and has addressed whether or not a dog sniff constituted a "[[search and seizure|search]]" under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]].  In those three cases, the Supreme Court has held that:
:* "... the canine sniff is ''[[sui generis]]''. We are aware of no other investigative procedure that is so limited both in the manner in which the information is obtained and in the content of the information revealed by the procedure." – ''[[United States v. Place]]'', {{ussc|source=f|462|696|1983|pin=706}}
:* "The fact that  officers walk a narcotics-detection dog around the exterior of each car at the Indianapolis checkpoints does not transform the seizure into a search." – ''[[City of Indianapolis v. Edmond]]'', {{ussc|source=f|531|32|2000|pin=40}}
:* "A dog sniff conducted during a concededly lawful traffic stop that reveals no information other than the location of a substance that no individual has any right to possess does not violate the Fourth Amendment." – ''[[Illinois v. Caballes]]'', {{ussc|source=f|543|405|2005|pin=410}}

Indeed, the question of whether or not a canine sniff is a "search" was not at issue in this case.  One passage from ''Caballes'' does, however, foretell the issue in the instant case:
{{quote|Respondent likewise concedes that "drug sniffs are designed, and if properly conducted are generally likely, to reveal only the presence of contraband."  Although respondent argues that the error rates, particularly the existence of false positives, call into question the premise that drug-detection dogs alert only to contraband, the record contains no evidence or findings that support his argument.  Moreover, respondent does not suggest that an erroneous alert, in and of itself, reveals any legitimate private information, and, in this case, the trial judge found that ''the dog sniff was sufficiently reliable to establish probable cause to conduct a full-blown search'' of the trunk." (emphasis added)(citation omitted)|''[[Illinois v. Caballes]]'', {{ussc|source=f|543|405|2005|pin=409}}}}

This case addressed whether that dog's alert alone is sufficient to establish [[probable cause]] for a search, or whether law enforcement must first establish the reliability of such an alert.

==Facts of the case==
On June 24, 2006, a [[Liberty County, Florida]] Sheriff's [[police dog|Canine Officer]] Wheetley and his [[detection dog|drug-detection dog]], Aldo, were on patrol. The officer conducted a traffic stop of defendant Clayton Harris's truck because his tag had expired. Approaching the truck, the officer noticed that the defendant was shaking, breathing fast, and appeared agitated – he also noticed an open beer container in the vehicle's cup holder. When the defendant refused consent to search the truck, the officer deployed Aldo to walk around the truck. As he performed a "free air sniff" of the truck's exterior, the dog alerted his handler to the driver's side door handle.&lt;ref name="Fla-S-Ct"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Harris v. State of Florida  |vol=71 |reporter=So.3d |opinion=756 |pinpoint=759–760 |court=Fla.|date=2011 |url=http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Harris_v_State_71_So_3d_756_Fla_2011_Court_Opinion  |accessdate=26 September 2012 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The officer then searched the vehicle, and found over 200 [[pseudoephedrine]] pills in a plastic bag under the driver's seat.  On the passenger's side, the officer found boxes containing a total of 8000 matches. Harris was then placed under arrest, and a further search uncovered [[muriatic acid]], [[antifreeze]]/water remover, a foam plate inside a [[latex glove]], and a coffee filter with [[iodine]] crystals.  The officer testified that these chemicals are precursors of [[methamphetamine]]. After being read his [[Miranda rights]], Harris stated that he had been "cooking meth" for about one year, and had most recently cooked it at his home two weeks prior.  As no methamphetamine was found in the vehicle, the State charged Harris with possession of the listed chemical pseudoephedrine with intent to use it to manufacture methamphetamine.&lt;ref name="MeritBrief-Fla"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bondi|first1=P.J.|last2=Garre |first2=G.G. |last3=Schmalzbach |first3=B.D. |last4=Snurkowski |first4=C.M. |last5=Krauss |first5=R.J. |last6=Shanahan |first6=S.M. |title=''State of Florida v. Clayton Harris'', Brief for Petitioner, on Writ of Certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida|url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/briefs/11-817_pet.pdf|publisher=State of Florida|accessdate=26 September 2012|location=Tampa, Fla.|format=PDF|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About two months after the June 24 stop, Harris was again stopped by the same officer for another traffic infraction. During that stop, the officer again deployed Aldo – who once again alerted to the driver's side door handle. The officer again searched the vehicle, and found no illegal substances, save for an open bottle of alcoholic beverage.&lt;ref name="Fla-S-Ct"/&gt;

The trial court denied Harris's motion to suppress the evidence produced by the search, and instead found that there was probable cause to support the search.  The decision of the [[Florida First District Court of Appeal]] (DCA), in a [[per curiam]] decision, affirmed the trial court's ruling.&lt;ref name="Fla-DCA"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Harris v. State of Florida  |vol=989 |reporter=So.2d |opinion=1214 |pinpoint= |court=Fla. 1st DCA|date=2008 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?hl=en&amp;case=180806905525458364 |accessdate=26 September 2012 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The First District, without elaboration, cited ''State v.

Harris sought review by the [[Supreme Court of Florida]], based on contradictory appellate rulings from other districts, namely ''Gibson v. State'' (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Gibson v. State of Florida  |vol=968 |reporter=So.2d |opinion=631 |pinpoint= |court=Fla. 2nd DCA|date=2007 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10518878639038781408hl=en |accessdate=26 September 2012 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Matheson v. State'' (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Matheson v. State of Florida  |vol=870 |reporter=So.2d |opinion=8 |pinpoint= |court=Fla. 2nd DCA|date=2003 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12493864131219788644&amp;hl=en |accessdate=26 September 2012 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his challenge, Harris pointed out that on each of the two occasions in which his vehicle was searched, the dog alerted his handler to contraband which was not present in the vehicle.

==Aldo's training and reliability==
The police officer testified that on the date of Harris's arrest, he had been on the force for three years, and had been a canine handler for two. Aldo completed a 120-hour drug detection training course two years earlier with his handler at the time, and was certified by an independent company that certifies K-9s.  Aldo is trained and certified to detect cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, heroin, and methamphetamine – he is not trained to detect alcohol or pseudoephedrine.  Although pseudoephedrine is a precursor to methamphetamine, there was no testimony as to whether a dog trained to detect methamphetamine would also detect pseudoephedrine.&lt;ref name="Fla-S-Ct-760"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Harris v. State of Florida  |vol=71 |reporter=So.3d |opinion=756 |pinpoint=760 |court=Fla.|date=2011 |url=http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Harris_v_State_71_So_3d_756_Fla_2011_Court_Opinion  |accessdate=26 September 2012 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officer Wheetley and Aldo were partnered for a year before the Harris stop, and they completed an annual forty-hour training seminar four months prior to that stop.  In addition, the officer spends four hours per week training Aldo in detecting drugs in vehicles, buildings, and warehouses. For example, the officer testified, he may take Aldo to a wrecker yard and plant drugs in six to eight out of ten vehicles.  Aldo must alert the handler to the vehicles with drugs, and he is rewarded when he does so.  Aldo's rate of success during these sessions was described as "really good".  The dog's training records, which the officer began keeping six months prior to Harris's stop, showed that on a dual grade of "satisfactory" or "unsatisfactory", Aldo performed "satisfactory" 100% of the time. The officer did not track false positives, nor did he explain whether any false positive alerts by Aldo would affect his "satisfactory" performance rating.&lt;ref name="Fla-S-Ct-760" /&gt;

In Florida, a single-purpose dog like Aldo, such as one trained only to detect drugs, is not required by law to carry certification.  In contrast, a dual-purpose dog, such as one trained in both apprehension and drug detection, must carry [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]] (FDLE) certification.&lt;ref name="Fla-S-Ct-760"/&gt;

As for Aldo's performance in the field, the Florida Supreme Court noted that:
{{quote|Officer Wheetley maintains records of Aldo's field performance only when [he] makes an arrest. Officer Wheetley testified that he does not keep records of Aldo's alerts in the field when no contraband is found; he documents only Aldo's successes. These records were neither produced prior to the hearing nor introduced at the hearing. Thus, it is impossible to determine what percentage of time Aldo alerted and no contraband was found following a warrantless search of the vehicle.|Florida Supreme Court, {{cite court |litigants=Harris v. State of Florida  |vol=71 |reporter=So.3d |opinion=756 |pinpoint=761 |court=Fla.|date=2011 |url=http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Harris_v_State_71_So_3d_756_Fla_2011_Court_Opinion  |accessdate=26 September 2012 |quote=}}}}

==Lower court==
As a result, the Florida Supreme Court reversed, saying:
{{quote|Like the informant whose information forms the basis for probable cause, where the dog's alert is the linchpin of the probable cause analysis, such as in this case, the reliability of the dog to alert to illegal substances within the vehicle is crucial to determining whether probable cause exists. ...

We conclude that when a dog alerts, the fact that the dog has been trained and certified is simply not enough to establish probable cause to search the interior of the vehicle and the person. We first note that there is no uniform standard in this state or nationwide for an acceptable level of training, testing, or certification for drug-detection dogs. ...  Second, ... any presumption of reliability ... does not take into account the potential for false alerts, the potential for handler error, and the possibility of alerts to residual odors.|Florida Supreme Court, {{cite court |litigants=Harris v. State of Florida  |vol=71 |reporter=So.3d |opinion=756 |pinpoint=767–768 |court=Fla.|date=2011 |url=http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Harris_v_State_71_So_3d_756_Fla_2011_Court_Opinion  |accessdate=26 September 2012 }}}}

Additionally, the Florida Supreme Court cited one commentator's description of the "'mythic infallibility' of the dog's nose":
{{quote|In cases involving dog sniffing for narcotics it is particularly evident that the courts often accept the mythic dog with an almost superstitious faith. The myth so completely has dominated the judicial psyche in those cases that the courts either assume the reliability of the sniff or address the question cursorily; the dog is the clear and consistent winner.| A.E.

The Unscientific Myth of the Dog Scent Lineup |journal=[[Hastings Law Journal]]| pages=15, 22, 28 |year=1990| volume=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==Supreme Court==
The State of Florida petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a [[writ of certiorari]], which was granted on March 26, 2012.&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Florida v.

===Arguments===
{{SCOTUS oral arguments}}
Oral argument was heard on October 31, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida v. Harris; Transcript of Oral Argument|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-817.pdf|publisher=[[Supreme Court of the United States]]|accessdate=31 October 2012|date=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This case was heard on the same day as that of another dog sniff case, ''[[Florida v. Jardines]]''.  That case addresses whether a dog sniff at the front door of a house is a Fourth Amendment search requiring probable cause and a [[search warrant]], or whether it is an acceptable [[minimally invasive warrantless search]].&lt;ref name=Jardines-Q&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/qp/11-00564qp.pdf |format=PDF |title=11-564 ''Florida v.

====No certification standards====

====False alerts in the field====
In ''Harris'', one of the major points raised by a number of the ''amici curiae'' is that a dog's training or certification does not necessarily reflect that dog's reliability in the field.  They point to what they say are "the most comprehensive data available on the rate of false alerts in real-world settings"&lt;ref name=NACDL-Brief/&gt;  – several years' of studies undertaken by an independent government agency in [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]], [[Australia]], under the Police Powers (Drug Detection Dogs) Act 2001.&lt;ref name=NSW-2006-A&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Police dogs went through an initial 6 weeks of training to detect cannabis, ecstasy, methamphetamine, cocaine and heroin, received additional training weekly, and were tested and re-certified every three months.  The police dogs would randomly sniff individuals at train stations, licensed premises, on streets and sidewalks, at nightclub strips, shopping centers, concerts, and other public locations – the dog would sit next to a person if it alerted.  In the first 9 months of 2011, dogs alerted (and police searched) 14,102 times, and drugs were found only 2,854 times—a false alert rate of 80%.  Those results, they say, are surprisingly consistent – in 2010, the false alert rate was 74%.&lt;ref name=4outof5&gt;{{cite news

|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/animals/sniffer-dogs-get-it-wrong-four-out-of-five-times-20111211-1oprv.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further still, the study found that individual dog's performance varied wildly, with accuracy rates ranging from a high of 56% to a low of 7%, with two-thirds of the dogs performing below the average. The [[New South Wales]]' [[Ombudsman]] summarized his report by saying:
{{quote|Despite the best efforts of police officers, the use of drug detection dogs has proven to be an ineffective tool for detecting drug dealers. Overwhelmingly, the use of drug detection dogs has led to public searches of individuals in which no drugs were found, or to the detection of (mostly young) adults in possession of very small amounts of cannabis for personal use. These findings have led us to question whether the Drug Dogs Act will ever provide a fair, efficacious and cost effective tool to target drug supply. Given this, we have recommended that the starting point, when considering this report, is to review whether the Drug Dogs Act should be retained at all."{{sfnp|Barbour|2006a|p=forward}}}}

Prosecutors, on the other hand, say that does not prove anything.  They point to "residual odors", meaning that the individuals may have in fact been in contact with drugs earlier and the drugs were no longer present, or the drugs may have been extremely well-hidden. In a reply brief, P.J. Bondi, Attorney General of Florida, wrote:

===Decision===
The United States Supreme Court returned a unanimous decision on February 19, 2013, ruling against Harris and overturning the ruling of the Florida Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Robert|title=Supreme Court sides with drug-sniffing dog|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-02-19/politics/37171249_1_oral-arguments-search-warrant-appeals-court|accessdate=26 March 2013|newspaper=Washington Post|date=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the unanimous opinion, Justice Elena Kagan stated that the dog's certification and continued training are adequate indication of his reliability, and thus is sufficient to presume the dog's alert provides probable cause to search, using the "totality-of-the-circumstances" test per ''[[Illinois v. Gates]]''. She wrote that the Florida Supreme Court instead established "a strict evidentiary checklist", where "an alert cannot establish probable cause ... unless the State introduces comprehensive documentation of the dog’s prior 'hits' and 'misses' in the field ... No matter how much other proof the State offers of the dog’s reliability, the absent field performance records will preclude a finding of probable cause."&lt;ref&gt;''Florida v. Harris'', {{ussc|568||2013|docket=11-817}} (slip op., at 6).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court did not, however, rule out the questioning of reliability where specific grounds are present.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com" /&gt; Kagan also stated that "a defendant must have an opportunity to challenge such evidence of a dog’s reliability, whether by cross-examining the testifying officer or by introducing his own fact or expert witnesses. The defendant may contest training or testing standards as flawed, or too lax, or raise an issue regarding the particular alert."&lt;ref&gt;''Harris'', 568 U.S., (slip op., at 8).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

'''''Girls Lean Back Everywhere: The Law of Obscenity and the Assault on Genius''''' by [[Edward de Grazia]] is a 1992 book chronicling the history of literary censorship in the United States and elsewhere.

==Contents==
The book details the history of struggles against literary censorship, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. As the narrative develops, it turns increasingly to US First Amendment law. It tells the stories of various censorship struggles and cases throughout the twentieth century. The book is dedicated to [[Justice William Brennan]].&lt;ref name="gates"&gt;[[Henry Louis Gates]], "Book Review: To 'Deprave and Corrupt': ''Girls Lean Back Everywhere''", 38 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 401 (1993); ''The Nation'', v.254, 898 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

The title comes from [[Jane Heap]], discussed in chapter one, which is based on the biographical writings of Heap and [[Margaret C. Anderson|Margaret Anderson]].  Heap and Anderson were American feminists and publishers, who in 1918 published the "[[Nausicaa]]" episode of [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' in their magazine, ''[[The Little Review]]''.&lt;ref name="EDG-1991"&gt;[[Edward de Grazia]], [http://www.cardozoaelj.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/edward-de-grazia.pdf "Introduction"], ''[[Cardozo Arts &amp; Entertainment Law Journal]]'', v.9, pp. 387–391 (July 10, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Their effort to publish the work [[Obscenity trial of Ulysses in The Little Review|was censored as the result of a criminal prosecution]] instigated by [[John S. Sumner]], Secretary of the [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]].&lt;ref name="EDG-1991" /&gt; In response to Sumner, Heap wrote of [[James Joyce]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Joyce was not teaching early Egyptian perversions nor inventing new ones. Girls lean back everywhere, showing lace and silk stockings; wear low-cut sleeveless blouses, breathless bathing suits; men think thoughts and have emotions about these things everywhere—seldom as delicately and imaginatively as Mr. Bloom (in the "Nausicaa" episode)--and no one is corrupted.&lt;ref name="gates" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other chapters tell the stories of numerous publishers, authors, and works, including [[Radclyffe Hall]]'s ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]; [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'; ''[[Lolita]]'' by [[Vladimir Nabokov]]; [[Theodore Dreiser]] and [[Émile Zola]]; and comedian [[Lenny Bruce]], as well as of censor boards and organizations, such as the Boston [[Watch and Ward Society]], the [[National Vigilance Association]], and the [[Cincinnati Citizens for Community Values]].&lt;ref name="gates" /&gt; The final chapter covers censorship in the 1980s of photographers [[Andres Serrano]], [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], and [[Jock Sturge]]; musicians [[2 Live Crew]]; and performance artists [[Karen Finley]] and [[Holly Hughes (performance artist)|Holly Hughes]].&lt;ref name="EDG-1991" /&gt;

The book is organized in the form of a court transcript, effectively "put[ting] the arts vigilantes on trial."&lt;ref name="gates" /&gt;

==Publication history==
The first two chapters of the book were published serially in the ''[[Cardozo Arts &amp; Entertainment Law Journal]]''.&lt;ref name="EDG-1991" /&gt;

::"The Hominidae form a taxonomic family, including four extant genera: humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans."

::"The recognition that we as a species are not phylogenetically separated from other animals, but are nested within the primate group known as the Great Apes, is no longer controversial. Goodman (1963) proposed on this basis to include the great apes (orang utan, gorilla and chimpanzee) in the family Hominidate, a view revived by Groves (1986) and increasingly adopted since then. Increasingly, too, the vernacular term 'Great Apes' has come to be used as a pure synonym for Hominidae, so that humans are also 'Great Apes.' The only remaining systemic controversy seems to be whether chimpanzees and gorillas together form the sister-group of humans, or chimpanzees and humans together constitute the sister-group of gorillas."
:Karcher, Karen. "The Great Ape Project" in [[Marc Bekoff]] (ed.). ''The Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare''. Greenwood, 2009, pp. 185–187:
::"The Great Ape Project (GAP) seeks to extend the scope of three basic moral principles to all members of what the GAP founders call the five great ape species (humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans)."&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates include [[Primatology|primatologists]] [[Jane Goodall]] and [[Dawn Prince-Hughes]], evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], philosophers [[Paola Cavalieri]] and [[Peter Singer]], and legal scholar [[Steven Wise]].&lt;ref name=GAPGoodall&gt;Goodall, Jane in Paola Cavalieri &amp; Peter Singer (eds.)

On February 28, 2007, the parliament of the [[Balearic Islands]], an autonomous community of Spain, passed the world's first legislation that would effectively grant legal [[personhood]] rights to all great apes.&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_rose/20070802.html |title=Going ape over human rights |access-date=26 June 2008 |author=Thomas Rose |date=2 August 2007 |publisher=CBC News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203225450/http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/vp_rose/20070802.html |archivedate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act sent ripples out of the region and across Spain, producing public support for the rights of great apes. On June 25, 2008 a parliamentary committee set forth resolutions urging Spain to grant the primates the rights to life and liberty. If approved "it will ban harmful experiments on apes and make keeping them for circuses, television commercials, or filming illegal under Spain's penal code."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSL256586320080625 |title=Spanish parliament to extend rights to apes |access-date=2008-07-11 |date=25 June 2008 |publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These precedents followed years of European legal efforts. In 1992, [[Switzerland]] amended its [[Constitution of Switzerland|constitution]] to recognize animals as ''beings'' and not ''things''.&lt;ref name="APBerlin"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2002/05/18/germany-rights.htm |title=Germany guarantees animal rights in constitution |accessdate=2008-06-26 |date=2002-05-18 |publisher=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1999 the Swiss constitution was completely rewritten. A decade later, [[Germany]] guaranteed rights to animals in a 2002 amendment to its constitution, becoming the first [[European Union]] member to do so.&lt;ref name="APBerlin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/06/21/germany.animals/index.html |title=Germany guarantees animal rights |access-date=2008-06-26 |date=21 June 2002 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jun/22/germany.animalwelfarel |title=German animals given legal rights |access-date=2008-06-26 |date=2002-06-22 |author=Kate Connolly |publisher=The Guardian }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Zealand]] granted strong protections to five great ape species in 1999. Their use is now forbidden in research, testing, or teaching. Some argue that New Zealand's protections amount to a form of weak [[legal rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animallaw.info/journals/jo_pdf/lralvol_7p35.pdf "A STEP AT A TIME: NEW ZEALAND'S PROGRESS TOWARD HOMINID RIGHTS" BY ROWAN TAYLOR] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728153305/http://www.animallaw.info/journals/jo_pdf/lralvol_7p35.pdf |date=July 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several European countries (including Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden) completely [[Great ape research ban|banned the use of great apes]] in animal testings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXII/I/I_00993/fnameorig_043770.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303200904/http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXII/I/I_00993/fnameorig_043770.html |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Argentina]] granted a captive orangutan basic human rights, starting from late 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/23/world/americas/feat-orangutan-rights-ruling/|title=Argentine orangutan granted unprecedented legal rights|last1=Giménez|first1=Emiliano|last2=|first2=|date=January 4, 2015|website=edition.cnn.com|publisher=[[CNN Espanol]]|access-date=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 20, 2015, Justice Barbara Jaffe of New York State Supreme Court ordered a writ of [[habeas corpus]] to two captive chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/2015/04/20/judge-recognizes-two-chimpanzees-as-legal-persons-grants-them-writ-of-habeas-corpus/ |title=Judge Recognizes Two Chimpanzees as Legal Persons, Grants them Writ of Habeas Corpus |author= |date=April 20, 2015 |website=nonhumanrightsproject.org |publisher=[[Nonhuman Rights Project]] |access-date=April 21, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909212513/http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/2015/04/20/judge-recognizes-two-chimpanzees-as-legal-persons-grants-them-writ-of-habeas-corpus/ |archivedate=September 9, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 21, the ruling was amended to strike the words "writ of habeas corpus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/habeas%20update.pdf|title=Judge Barbara Jaffe's amended court order|date=April 21, 2015|website=iapps.courts.state.ny.us|publisher=[[New York Supreme Court]]|access-date=April 21, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430234057/http://news.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/habeas%20update.pdf|archivedate=April 30, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/22/nyregion/judge-orders-hearing-for-2-chimps-said-to-be-unlawfully-detained.html|title=Judge Orders Stony Brook University to Defend Its Custody of 2 Chimps|date=April 21, 2015|website=www.nytimes.com|publisher=[[New York Times]]|access-date=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/08/chimps-dont-have-same-legal-rights-as-humans-must-remain-in-research-lab/ David Kravets ''Ars Technica'' (8/3/2015) No habeas corpus; chimps are lab “property”: "Animals, including chimpanzees," judge rules, "are considered property."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy==
Well-known advocates include primatologist [[Jane Goodall]], who was appointed a goodwill ambassador for the [[United Nations]] to fight the [[bushmeat]] trade and end [[ape]] extinction; [[Richard Dawkins]], former Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at [[Oxford University]]; [[Peter Singer]], professor of philosophy at [[Princeton University]]; and attorney and former Harvard professor [[Steven Wise]], founder and president of the [[Nonhuman Rights Project]] (NhRP), whose aim is to work through U.S. common law on a state-by-state basis to achieve recognition of legal personhood for great apes and other self-aware, autonomous nonhuman animals; all advocate for great ape personhood.&lt;ref name=GAPGoodall/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nonhumanrights.org |title=Nonhuman Rights Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, the NhRP filed three lawsuits on behalf of four chimpanzees being held in captivity in New York State, arguing that they should be recognized as legal persons with the fundamental right to bodily liberty (i.e. not to be held in captivity) and that they are entitled to common law writs of [[habeas corpus]] and should be immediately freed and moved to sanctuaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/magazine/the-rights-of-man-and-beast.html?_r=0 |title=Should a Chimp Be Able to Sue Its Owner? |author=Charles Siebert |date=23 April 2014 |publisher=New York Times Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three petitions for writs of habeas corpus were denied, allowing for the right to appeal. The NhRP is in the process of appealing all three decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Appeals-panel-to-weigh-personhood-for-chimpanzee-5797943.php |title=Appeals panel to weigh personhood for chimpanzee |author=Robert Gavin |date=3 October 2014 |publisher=Times Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodall's [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] revealed the social and family life of chimps to be very similar to that of human beings in some respects. She herself calls them individuals, and says they relate to her as an individual member of the clan. Laboratory studies of [[Great ape language|ape language ability]] began to reveal other human traits, as did [[genetics]], and eventually three of the great apes were reclassified as [[hominidae|hominids]].

Other studies, such as one done by Beran &amp; Evans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Beran MJ|author2= Evans TA |title=Maintenance of delay of gratification by four chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes): the effects of delayed reward visibility, experimenter presence, and extended delay intervals |journal=Behavioural Processes |volume=73 |issue=3 |pages=315–24 |year=2006 |pmid=16978800 |doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2006.07.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicate other qualities that humans share with non-human primates, namely the ability to self-control. In order for chimpanzees to control their impulsivity, they use self-distraction techniques similar to those that are used by children. Great apes also exhibited ability to plan as well as project "oneself into the future", known as the process of [[Chronesthesia|mental time travel]]. Such complicated tasks require self-awareness, which great apes appear to possess: "the capacity that contribute to the ability to delay gratification, since a self-aware individual may be able to imagine future states of the self".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Animal Cognition: Time Flies When Chimps Are Having Fun.|last =Heilbronner, S. Platt, M., L. |first = |date = 4 December 2007|journal = |doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2007.10.012|pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This, alongside the increasing risk of great ape extinction, had led the [[animal rights]] movement to put pressure on nations to recognize apes as having limited [[rights]] and being legal "persons." In response, the [[United Kingdom]] introduced a ban on research using great apes, although testing on other primates has not been limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/businessofresearch/story/0,,1663535,00.html |title=RSPCA outrage as experiments on animals rise to 2.85m |accessdate=2008-06-26 |author=Alok Jha |date=2005-12-05 |publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer and lecturer Thomas Rose makes the argument that granting legal rights afforded to humans to non-humans is nothing new. He points out that in the majority of the world, "corporations are recognized as legal persons and are granted many of the same rights humans enjoy, the right to sue, to vote and to freedom of speech."&lt;ref name="Rose" /&gt; [[Dawn Prince-Hughes]] has written that great apes meet the commonly accepted standards for personhood: "self-awareness; comprehension of past, present, and future; the ability to understand complex rules and their consequences on emotional levels; the ability to choose to risk those consequences, a capacity for [[empathy]], and the ability to [[Abstraction|think abstractly]]."&lt;ref name="Prince-Hughes138"&gt;{{cite book |title= Songs of the Gorilla Nation|last= Prince-Hughes|first= Dawn|authorlink= Dawn Prince-Hughes|coauthors= |year= 1987|publisher= Harmony|location= |isbn=1-4000-5058-8|page= 138|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gary Francione]] questions the concept of granting personhood on the basis of whether the animal in question is human-like (as some have argued for great apes), and clarifies that [[sentience]] is the sole characteristic an animal requires to have basic rights. Therefore, he asserts, other animals—including mice and rats—should also be granted such rights.&lt;ref name="Gary 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Francione | first=Gary | title=The Great Ape Project: Not so Great | year=2006 | url=http://www.abolitionistapproach.com/the-great-ape-project-not-so-great/ | accessdate=2010-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
Depending on the precise wording of any proposed or adopted declaration, personhood for the Great Apes may raise questions concerning protections and obligations under national and international laws, such as:
* Articles 7–29 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]
* The [[1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons]] and [[1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness]] regarding nationality and citizenship for persons
* Provisions 4 &amp; 5 of the [[Declaration of the Rights of the Child]]

The '''Indonesian nationality law''' is a law regulating about who an Indonesian citizen is, the requirements and how to obtain Indonesian citizenship, the loss of Indonesian citizenship, the requirements and how to re-obtain Indonesian citizenship, and the penal provision. The nationality law is stated in [[Constitution of Indonesia]].

The Indonesian nationality law is based on [[jus sanguinis]] and [[jus soli]]. The latest law regulating Indonesian nationality is Law No. 12/2006 (UU No. 12 Tahun 2006). This law revokes Law No. 62/1958 (UU No. 62 Tahun 1958).

Generally, Indonesian citizens are those natural [[Indonesian people]] and those of other nationalities that are endorsed by the law as Indonesian citizens.  The Indonesian nationality law does not recognize [[dual citizenship]] except for persons under the age of 18 (single citizenship principle). After reaching 18 years of age individuals must choose one citizenship (limited double citizenship principle).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/indonesias-new-immigration-law-confuses-one-and-all/|title=Indonesia's New Immigration Law Confuses One and All|last=|first=|date=|work=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=[[Jakarta Globe]]|accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indonesian citizen==
An Indonesian citizen is:
* one who before the enactment of this law was already an Indonesian citizen
* a child from a legal marriage whose parents are Indonesian citizens
* a child from a legal marriage whose father is an Indonesian citizen and mother is a foreign citizen
* a child from a legal marriage whose mother is an Indonesian citizen and father is a foreign citizen
* a child from a legal marriage whose mother is an Indonesian citizen and father is stateless or whose nationality law does not give citizenship to offspring
* a child from a legal marriage born within 300 days after the father's death and the father was an Indonesian citizen at the time of death
* a child from an illegal marriage whose mother is an Indonesian citizen
* a child from an illegal marriage whose mother is a foreign citizen but the father is an Indonesian citizen and recognizes the child as his child before the child turns 18 or is married
* a child born in Indonesian territory whose parent's citizenship status is unknown
* a newly born child found in Indonesian territory as long as the father and mother are unknown
* a child born in Indonesian territory if the parents are stateless or cannot be found
* a child born outside of Indonesian territory whose parents are Indonesian citizens and, because of the law where the child was born, the child was granted another citizenship
* a child from whose father or mother was already granted Indonesian citizenship but died before taking an oath of allegiance

==Obtaining Indonesian citizenship==
A foreign citizen can apply to become an Indonesian citizen with the following requirements:
* being the age of 18 years or older, or being married
* when applying, having resided in Indonesia for a minimum of 5 consecutive years or 10 non consecutive years
* physically and mentally healthy
* can speak the [[Indonesian language]] and acknowledge [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] and [[Constitution of Indonesia|Undang-Undang Dasar Negara Republik Indonesia Tahun 1945]]
* never convicted of a crime for which the punishment is imprisonment for one year or more
* if having Indonesian citizenship will not give the person dual citizenship
* employed or have fixed income
* pay the citizenship fee

Any application for citizenship is granted by the [[President of Indonesia]].

==Losing Indonesian citizenship==
This could happen if:
* a person over the age of 18 obtains another citizenship by his/her own will
* a person does not reject or release another citizenship even he/she has the opportunity to do so
* A person renounces Indonesian citizenship to the President of Indonesia on his/her own will with the provision that he/she is already 18 years old or married, is staying in a foreign country, and is not stateless if he/she loses Indonesian citizenship
* a person joins a foreign military without the President's permission
* a person voluntarily taking another country's oath of allegiance
* a person has a valid passport or other passport-like documents from a foreign country as proof of citizenship
* staying outside Indonesian territory for 5 consecutive years, not stating the will to stay as Indonesian citizen before the 5-year period is over, and not reporting every 5 years to a representative of the Indonesian government

==Travel freedom==
{{main|Visa requirements for Indonesian citizens}}
[[File:Visa requirements for Indonesian citizens.png|thumbnail|400px|right|Visa requirements for Indonesian citizens]]
In 2018, Indonesian citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 70 countries and territories, ranking the [[Indonesian passport]] 69th in the world according to the [[Travel_visa#Visa_restrictions|Visa Restrictions Index]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3470">An '''innocence commission''' is a legal commission set up by a [[government]] for post-conviction review of cases, to try to ensure that wrongful convictions do not stand and that no innocent person is executed. 

==History==

In November 2002 Chief Justice [[I. Beverly Lake|I. Beverly Lake Jr.]] of the North Carolina State Supreme Court established the Criminal Justice Study Commission following several highly publicized exoneration cases in the state. It reviewed police and prosecution procedures for factors that contributed to wrongful convictions.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.innocencecommission-nc.gov/Forms/pdf/statutes%20and%20rules/NCIIC-Rules-and-Procedures-Updated-9.2.2016.pdf Rules and Procedures, p. 7, North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission&lt;/ref&gt; The group recommended reforms, including changes to the procedure for gaining eyewitness testimony. This resulted in a change to state law.&lt;ref name="8Closed"&gt;[http://www.journalnow.com/app/specialreports/hunt/stories/parteight/story.html Phoebe Zerwick, Part 8: "Closed Doors"], ''Winston-Salem Journal'', 23 November 2007; accessed 7 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  

As a result of recommendations of the Justice Study, in 2006 the North Carolina legislature passed a bill to establish a state independent Innocence Inquiry Commission, signed into law by Governor [[Mike Easley]]. It was the first U.S. state to do so. The Innocence Commission was developed to review credible post-conviction cases in which the defendants and their advocates claim wrongful conviction; it started operating in 2007 and has exonerated 10 people as of March 2017. 

The commission was authorized after some high-profile convictions were overturned. These cases had generated considerable controversy and the exonerations were damaging to even before their convictions were overturned. 

The states of Pennsylvania, California, Connecticut, Wisconsin, and Illinois have since created similar innocence commissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innocenceproject.org/fix/Innocence-Commissions.php], Innocence Project&lt;/ref&gt;

The law is modeled after one that established the Innocence Network of the [[United Kingdom]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innocencenetwork.org.uk/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Process==
===North Carolina===
Defense attorneys apply to the commission to have their clients cases reviewed. The eight-member commission selects which cases to review. Its recommendations are reviewed by a three-judge panel.

==Appointment Process==
===North Carolina===
The eight Commission members are appointed by the chief justice of the state Supreme Court and chief judge of the state Court of Appeals.

==Other solutions==
* Creation of panels to review and improve legal process

'''Iranian nationality law''' contains principles of both ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' and ''[[jus soli]]''. Children acquire nationality of [[Iran]] through their fathers, but not their mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNICEF|2005|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full nationality law is defined in Book 2 of the Civil Code of Iran, Articles 976 through 991.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNHCR|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of Iranian nationals==
Article 976 of the Civil Code of Iran defines who is an Iranian national:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNICEF|2005|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# All persons residing in Iran except those whose foreign nationality is established; the foreign nationality of such persons is considered to be established if their documents of nationality have not been objected to by the [[Iranian Government]].
# Those born in Iran or outside whose father is Iranian.
# Those born in Iran of unknown parentage.
# Persons born in Iran of foreign parents, one of whom was also born in Iran.
# Persons born in Iran of a father of foreign nationality who have resided at least one more year in Iran immediately after reaching the full age of 18; in other cases their [[naturalization]] as Iranian subjects will be subject to the stipulations for Iranian naturalization laid down by the law. New legislation passed by the Iranian Parliament in 2012 grants [[permanent residency]] to children born to Iranian mothers and foreign fathers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.payvand.com/news/12/may/1070.html&lt;/ref&gt;
# Every woman of foreign nationality who marries an Iranian husband.
# Every foreign national who has obtained Iranian nationality.

According to Article 979 of the Civil Code of Iran, people can obtain Iranian nationality under following conditions:

# Have reached the full age of 18. 
# Have resided five years, whether continuously or intermittently, in Iran.
# Are not deserters from military service.
# Have not been convicted in any country of non - political major misdemeanours or felonies.

Applicants also have to proof employment which ensures livelihood.

Multiple citizenship{{See also|Iranian citizens abroad}}
In practice, the [[Iranian government]] considers dual citizens as Iranian citizens ''only''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dualcitizenship.com/countries/iran.html&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, article 977 of the Civil Code of Iran deals with [[multiple citizenship]]. As a consequence of Paragraphs 4 or 5 of Article 976, some Iranian minors may have multiple citizenship. If they wish to retain the non-Iranian nationality after age 18, they have to inform Iran's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Iran)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNICEF|2005|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel freedom==
{{main|Visa requirements for Iranian citizens|Tourism in Iran}}
[[File:Visa requirements for Iranian citizens.png|thumbnail|400px|right|Visa requirements for Iranian citizens]]
In 2016, Iranian citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 37 countries and territories, ranking the [[Iranian passport]] 98th in the world according to the [[Visa (document)#Visa Restrictions Index|Visa Restrictions Index]].

'''Law practice management software''' is [[software]] designed to manage a [[Law Practice|law firm]]'s case and client records, [[Bill (payment)|bill]]ing and [[bookkeeping]], schedules and appointments, deadlines, computer files and to facilitate any [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]] requirements such as with document retention policies, courts' electronic filing systems and, in the UK, the [[Legal cashier#Solicitors.27 Accounts Rules|Solicitors' Accounts Rules]] as defined by the Solicitors Regulation Authority.

==Purpose==
Because [[law school]]s do not generally teach new [[Lawyer|attorneys]] the business skills to run a law office, many offices have turned to technology to ease the learning curve and reduce clerical errors. The [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) has found that calendar and deadline related mistakes account for most [[legal malpractice]] claims. Therefore, an initial investment in software tools can yield long term savings in defending against such claims.&lt;ref name="Law.com"&gt;National Law Journal (April 18, 2005) - [http://www.law.com/jsp/law/sfb/lawArticleSFB.jsp?id=1113555910154 "How Small Firms Can ward Off Malpractice Suits"]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the ABA has an entire section devoted entirely to law office management, of which software and related programs are an increasingly important part of its mission delivery. Many state bar associations also provide assistance&lt;ref name="abanet.org"&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/tech/ltrc/charts/PracticeCaseManagement-TimeBilling-IntegratedSoftwareChart.pdf Practice Management Software Comparison Chart from the ABA]&lt;/ref&gt; and discounts to their members for such software.&lt;ref name="njsba"&gt;[http://www.njsba.com/NJSBAstatic/law_office_manage/dsp_software.cfm New Jersey State Bar Association official web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726020851/http://www.njsba.com/NJSBAstatic/law_office_manage/dsp_software.cfm |date=2007-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main purpose of these programs is to allow a law firm to run more smoothly.&lt;ref name="Law Office Management Software"&gt;Amy Hall, [http://www.articleinsider.com/article/170842 ''Law Office Management Software''], retrieved from ''Article Insider''&lt;/ref&gt;

Case Management Software, used properly, improves efficiency, provides for conflict checking, and enables a law office to not have to search for the physical file each time a client calls with questions, thereby helping to reduce the need for callbacks since the client can get answers on an as needed basis at the time of their inquiry. &lt;ref&gt;https://lawfirmpracticemanagementadvice.com/2016/02/14/cloud-based-practice-management-software/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the industry==
Legal law office management is a growing business in [[North America]] and the [[United Kingdom]] due to the highly competitive market to gain customers. In the UK, the [http://www.lssa.co.uk/ Legal Software Suppliers Association (LSSA)] is the industry body for legal software systems developers and vendors. Representing a selection of UK suppliers and chaired by the chairman of one of the suppliers, it claims that it sets and maintains professional standards within the industry and manage areas of mutual interest between lawyers and software providers – such as the Land Registry, LSC, Law Society &amp; other legislative bodies.

==Types of software==
Software applications have become increasingly important in modern law practice. Picking the best software for a law office depends on many variables. Attorneys/Solicitors often buy their software based on their practice area. The New Jersey State Bar Association web site&lt;ref name="njsba"/&gt; lists a variety of applications by substantive law (Bankruptcy, Collections, Estate planning and administration, and Real estate) as well as by practice matter (Calendar/Schedule/Docket Control, Case &amp; Practice Management, Document Assembly, and Document Management).

Regardless of the type of law practiced, practice management software (a form of [[Customer relationship management]] software) is among the most important. Features of practice management software include:
* Case management [[Database|(databases]], checking [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] and [[Statute of limitations|statutes of limitations]])
* [[Time tracking]] (for billing)
* [[Document assembly]]
* [[Contact management]]
* Calendaring
* Docket management
* Client communication&lt;ref name="abanet.org"/&gt; 
* Contract Management 
* Court Case Status Tracker

Other software systems that are useful for law firms include: [[Password]] security, [[Disk encryption]], [[Mindmapping]], desktop notes, [[word processing]], and [[email management]]. Some firms use modified versions of [[Open-source software|Open source]] software.&lt;ref name="Law Office Management Software"/&gt;

Most law firms also subscribe to a [[Computer-assisted legal research]] database for [[Legal research]]. Such databases provide [[Case law]] from [[Law report|case reporters]], and often other legal resources. The two largest legal databases are [[Westlaw]] (part of [[West (publisher)|West]], which is owned by [[Thomson Reuters]]) and [[LexisNexis]], but other databases also exist, including the free [[Google Scholar]], and the newer [[Bloomberg Law]], as well as [[Loislaw]] (operated by [[Wolters Kluwer]]) and several smaller databases.Some [[bar association]]s and lawyers' organizations have their own software.

The '''Legal Assistance Centre''' is a human rights organization in Windhoek, Namibia &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nid.org.na/images/pdf/ngo_management_training/Guide_to_Civil_Society.pdf|title=Guide to Civil Society in Namibia|last=|first=|publisher=Namibian Institute for Democracy|year=2009|isbn=978-999-16-860-9-7|location=Windhoek|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
The history of the Legal Assistance Centre is embedded in Namibia's struggle to end South Africa's apartheid occupation and brutal rule of the country. In the 1980s, the [[SWAPO|South West African People's Organization (SWAPO)]] was making progress in their fight for an independent state. However,  human right violations and the use of apartheid era law continued to justify inhumane, degrading and discriminatory practices.&lt;ref name="protecting" /&gt;

On the legal front, a young lawyer named Dave Smuts began taking on public interest cases against the apartheid government. In 1987, Smuts worked with churches in northern Namibia to successfully challenge the detainment of a group who had been held in prison without trial for several years. They were successful and together Smuts and church leaders began helping people obtain legal aid and spread information about laws.&lt;ref name="protecting" /&gt;

In July 1988, the Legal Assistance Centre was officially opened in [[Ongwediva]] in northern Namibia by Smuts and a group of lawyers and paralegals. The Legal Assistance Centre's founding was based on the principle of taking public interest legal cases to court and providing free services to clients.&lt;ref name="protecting" /&gt; Additional offices were set up in [[Windhoek]], [[Tsumeb]], [[Walvis Bay]] and [[Rundu]].

Nearly 500 cases were handled by the organization in its first hear of operation, the vast majority involving human rights abuses (assault, rape, detention) perpetrated by security forces. Labour cases (unfair dismiasal, non payment of wages, workmen's compensation claims) were also brought to court in the Centre's first year.&lt;ref name="protecting" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45545">This article contains a '''list of treaties by number of parties''' to the treaty. A "party" to a treaty is a state or other entity that ratifies, accedes to, approves, or succeeds to the treaty.{{efn|For simplicity, this article uses "ratify" to mean "ratify, accedes to, approves, or succeeds to".}}

==General principles of ratification==
In general, multilateral treaties are open to ratification by any state. Some treaties may also be ratified by supranational bodies, such as the [[European Union]], and by other international organizations.

In practice, the [[depositary]] of a treaty will usually only recognise ratifications of the treaty that are performed by a state that is recognised as a state at international law. A state can be formally recognised as such by becoming a member of the United Nations; there are currently {{UNnum}} [[member states of the United Nations]].  The only non-UN states that undoubtedly meet the standard of statehood are the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]], who have had their "full treaty-making capacity" recognised by the [[United Nations Secretariat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/Historicalinfo.aspx|title=Historical Information|accessdate=2014-04-10|publisher=[[United Nations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|format=PDF |url=http://legal.un.org/repertory/art102/english/rep_supp8_vol6-art102_e_advance.pdf |title=Repertory of Practice |publisher=[[United Nations|UN]] |contribution=Organs Supplement |number=8 |page=10 |accessdate=2014-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019223055/http://legal.un.org/repertory/art102/english/rep_supp8_vol6-art102_e_advance.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Holy See]]—while not a state per se but an entity closely tied to the state of [[Vatican City]]—is also widely recognised as being able to legitimately ratify treaties and has been granted [[UN observer|non-member observer state]] status by the [[UN General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/members/nonmembers.shtml|title=Non-member States|publisher=[[United Nations]]|accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|For simplicity, this article treats the Holy See as a state rather than as a non-state organization.}} Following the UNGA passing a [[United Nations General Assembly resolution 67/19|resolution]] granting non-member observer state status to the [[State of Palestine]], the UNSG has begun to recognize its right to ratify treaties. Ratifications performed by other [[List of states with limited recognition|states with more limited recognition]]—such as the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]); [[Republic of Kosovo|Kosovo]]; [[Northern Cyprus]]; [[Somaliland]]; the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] ([[Western Sahara]]); [[South Ossetia]]; [[Abkhazia]]; [[Transnistria]]; and [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|Nagorno-Karabakh]]—have usually not been recognised by treaty depositaries as states that can ratify treaties, although there are some exceptions to this general rule.

If a state party to a treaty ''[[Denunciation (international law)|denounce]]s'' the treaty, the state (often after a certain period before the denunciation takes effect) is no longer a party to the treaty, although in some cases certain parts of the treaty may continue to apply.

==Ratifications by defunct states==
States change over time, and often a state that ratified a treaty will cease to exist. International law deals with this issue in two ways. First, it is possible for a state to be declared the ''successor'' state to the defunct state. In this situation, any ratifications performed by the defunct state are transferred to and attributed to the successor state. Examples of successor states are the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] (successor to the [[Soviet Union]]), [[Serbia]] (successor to [[Serbia and Montenegro]]), [[Belarus]] (successor to the [[Byelorussian SSR]]), [[Ukraine]] (successor to the [[Ukrainian SSR]]), and [[Tanzania]] (successor to [[Tanganyika]]). It is possible for a single state to be the successor state of multiple states, as with [[Yemen]] being the successor state of both [[North Yemen]] and [[South Yemen]].

Second, some states have no legal successor state but cease to exist; in such cases, the ratifications performed by the state are disregarded. In some cases, such states are subsumed into an existing state, as when [[East Germany]] became part of the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]. In other cases, the defunct state is divided into two or more states, with none of the states being designated as the formal successor state. Examples of the latter situation include [[Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]. In this situation, the new states usually declare which treaties the defunct state ratified continue to have force for the new state. Such a declaration is regarded as a "ratification" by the new state.{{efn|Similar declarations may be made by states that result from the division of a defunct state when there ''is'' a formal successor state. For instance, when [[Serbia and Montenegro]] divided into [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]], Serbia was designated as the successor state. Upon division, Montenegro made declarations as to which treaties ratified by Serbia and Monenegro remain in force for Montenegro.}}

For purposes of the numbers in this list, only ratifications, accessions, or successions of currently existing states are considered. No regard is given to ratifications by defunct states that have no current successor state.

==Maximum limits to ratification numbers?==
Due to these limitations, in 2016, the maximum number of state ratifications that a multilateral treaty can have is usually going to be 197; this total consists of all 193 [[UN member states]]; both [[UN observer]]s, the [[Holy See]] and [[State of Palestine]]; and the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]]. If supranational or other international organizations ratify the treaty, the total number of ratifications may exceed 197.

==Legal effect of a high number of ratifications==
When a treaty is ratified by nearly all recognised states in the world, the legal principles contained in the treaty may become [[customary international law]]. Customary international law applies to ''all'' states, whether or not the state has ratified a treaty that enshrines the principle. There is no set number of ratifications that are required to convert a treaty's principles into customary international law, and states and experts often disagree on what principles have and have not attained the status.

==List of treaties by number of parties==
Below is the list of treaties by number of parties. Only treaties with a minimum of 170 parties are included.

On 10 July 1964, the UPU incorporated the Treaty of Bern into a new Constitution of the UPU, which is now the governing treaty that is ratified when a state joins the UPU.  

Include as UPU members are two "joint memberships" for dependent territories (one for the [[British overseas territories]] and one for the Caribbean constituent countries ({{lang-nl|landen}}) of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] ([[Aruba]], [[Curaçao]] and [[Sint Maarten]]), originally as [[Netherlands Antilles]]).

'''Massachusetts Public Records Law''' is a [[law]] in [[Massachusetts]] detailing what kinds of documents are actually [[public records]].  It is a [[Massachusetts General Laws|state law]] that is similar to the federal [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], which was passed by [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in 1966.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.sec.state.ma.us/pre/prepdf/guide.pdf A Guide to the Massachusetts Public Records Law&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Boston Globe'' newspaper in 2016, "Massachusetts is currently the one state in the country where the [[Massachusetts General Court|Legislature]], [[Judiciary of Massachusetts|judiciary]], and [[Governor of Massachusetts|governor’s office]] all claim to be completely '''exempt''' from the [public records] law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/06/03/how-will-new-public-records-law-make-government-more-transparent/7DOIWWJDXsF2tC2r32dFXO/story.html |title= How will new records law make Mass. more transparent? |work= Boston Globe |date=June 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
The [[government]] and other agencies are required under the Public Records Act to disclose records and documents upon request.  There are exemptions to Public Records Act that the government can use to keep certain records private. 
The Massachusetts Public Records Law parallels FOIA.  All records including photographs, [[memorandum|memo]]s, books, papers, maps, recorded tapes, [[financial statement]]s, [[statistical]] [[tabulation]]s, or other [[documentary]] materials or [[data]] are considered public information in Massachusetts, unless they are withheld from public view under one of the sixteen exemptions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1615">The '''New York Farm Winery Act of 1976''' is a law that allows grape growers in [[New York (state)|New York]] to establish [[winery|wineries]] and sell directly to the public, subject to a maximum of {{convert|50000|gal|L}} annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Wine Country|url=http://www.lakeeriewinecountry.org/about-wine-country/|publisher=Lake Erie Wine Country|accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, John Miller, of Benmarl Winery, and [[John S. Dyson|John Dyson]], commissioner of agriculture, put together a plan to help revitalize the [[New York wine]] industry, which was foundering at the time. Governor [[Hugh Carey]] signed the plan into law in 1976.&lt;ref name=WinesNY&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Miller: Farm Winery Act of 1976|url=http://www.winesny.com/NewYorkWines/Articles/Hudson-Valley-Wines-09/Hudson-Valley-Wines-Mark-Miller.aspx|publisher=WinesNY.com|accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law allowed small grower-producers to sell directly to consumers, as well as reducing certain fees and providing tax and marketing advantages. Originally, the law required farm wineries to sell only estate-grown wines, but it was amended in 1978 to allow the use of any New York-grown grapes in wine sold at a farm winery.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

A '''[[notary public]]''' in the Commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]] is empowered to perform six distinct official acts: taking an acknowledgment; administering an oath or affirmation; taking a verification on oath or acknowledgment; witnessing or attesting a signature; certifying or attesting a copy or deposition; and noting a protest of a negotiable instrument. A notary is strictly prohibited from giving legal advice or drafting legal documents such as [[contract]]s, [[Mortgage law|mortgages]], [[lease]]s, [[Will (law)|will]]s, [[power of attorney|powers of attorney]], [[liens]] or [[Bond (finance)|bonds]].

According to the Pennsylvania Association of Notaries, there are more than 84,000 notaries in the state; 247 of them also have been approved by the Secretary of the Commonwealth to notarize electronically.

Although the notarial office is unique, other officers of the Commonwealth are authorized to act as notaries in some respects. For example, the Secretary and clerks of courts may issue certifications, election officers may administer oaths, and [[law enforcement officer]]s may take affidavits.

==Commissioners of Deeds==
Until July 1, 2003, the Commonwealth required notaries to be residents of the state; non-residents were appointed [[Commissioner of deeds|Commissioners of Deeds]], an essentially identical position.  Now, anyone with a regular office located in Pennsylvania can be appointed a Notary; there will be no further Commissioners of Deeds appointed.

==Notary Public Law==
Pennsylvania notaries are governed by Title 57 of the Pennsylvania Statutes, known as the Notary Public Law. Act 151 of 2002 amended Title 57, bringing about the most significant changes to the Notary Public Law in 50 years. In effect since July 1, 2003, these changes include required education for notaries, specific signer identification procedures, eligibility of nonresidents to hold notarial commission, embossing seal no longer required on notarized documents, and authorization for electronic notarization. As a result of the repeal of the embosser requirement the wording "Commonwealth of Pennsylvania" is recommended to be clearly written or typed along the top border of the Notary Public's notarial seal.

==History==
The first law to govern American notaries in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was enacted in 1791. Isaac Craig, a glassmaker in [[Pittsburgh]], was the first notary to be appointed under the new, independent state constitution. Governor Charles Mifflin, the first constitutionally elected governor, appointed Craig, with whom he had served in the Revolutionary War.

However, as early as 1727, [[Great Britain|British]]-appointed notaries sympathetic to the call for [[American independence]] began administering "Oaths of Allegiance to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania," in which individuals renounced loyalty to Britain. These oaths were documents signed by groups of individuals, in the style of a petition, or were personally written or distributed in a pre-printed form that could be signed, witnessed and sealed. In response to increasing numbers of foreigners arriving in the [[British colonies]], [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] ordered the administration of "Oaths of Fidelity" and "Oaths of Abjuration" in 1729; the first oath disavowed ties to any monarch other than the British Crown, and the second abjured, or renounced, any connection to the Roman Catholic Church.

Throughout the 17th and 18th century—both before and after the Revolutionary War—notaries and their traveling counterparts, commissioners of deeds, played vital roles in documenting the formation of the country. They performed the notarial acts necessitated by owning property and titling land, electing governmental leaders, and building the economy. The 19th and 20th century saw the numbers of commissioned notaries increase dramatically to meet the needs of developing business and commerce and a related increase in the number of lawsuits.

The Pennsylvania State Archives has preserved examples of the work of notaries throughout the last three centuries in the state. The oldest of these documents involve land records, including the 1681 Land Charter, which transferred ownership of the land that became Pennsylvania from King [[Charles II of England]] to [[William Penn]]. Subsequently, Penn purchased some of the land in parcels from the [[Native Americans in the United States|natives]] who occupied it and who Penn considered the rightful owners. Many deeds for so-called Indian lands were drawn up, acknowledged before notaries, and publicly recorded. The State Archives also preserves what is probably the state's earliest recorded fraudulent land transfers. The 1737 Walking Purchase is an instrument by which Penn's sons sold Indian land that their father had not purchased to a [[Europe]]an land speculator. This illegal agreement deprived the [[Delaware Indians]] of the entire upper [[Delaware River|Delaware]] and [[Lehigh River]] valleys.

{{Judicial interpretation}}

'''Original intent''' is a theory in [[law]] concerning [[constitution]]al and [[statute|statutory]] interpretation. It is frequently used as a [[synonym]] for [[originalism]];{{ref|syn}} while original intent is indeed one theory in the originalist family, it has some salient differences which has led originalists from more predominant schools of thought such as [[original meaning]] to distinguish original intent as much as [[Legal realism|legal realists]] do.

==Approach==
Original intent maintains that in interpreting a text, a [[court]] should determine what the authors of the text were trying to achieve, and to give effect to what they ''intended'' the statute to accomplish, the actual ''text'' of the legislation notwithstanding.{{ref|Beal}}{{ref|Zander}} As in [[purposivism]], tools such as [[legislative history]] are often used.

==Problems==
===Originalist criticisms of original intent proponents (and some proposed rebuttals)===
Despite the potential confusion of terms between the original Intent and originalism, other schools of Originalist thought have been as critical of original intent as non-Originalists.{{ref|originalist-critics}}
* Original intent presumes that there ''is'' a single, unified intent behind a text. In the case of the United States Constitution, the [[Philadelphia Convention]] was composed of over fifty men, who spent an entire summer compromising and arguing over provisions that were interpreted very differently the moment the Constitution's text became public.{{ref|op1}} It is far from clear, therefore, that those fifty-plus men ''had'' – i.e., agreed upon – a single original intent of the text, or whether their purposes in drafting the Constitution were predicated on personal self-interest.{{ref|Beard}} (There is no meaning from an originalist perspective without intent. That is, it is impossible to interpret anything which has no intent, according to originalism. Lawmakers either have no intent, one intent, or multiple intents. But these multiple intents are always consistent, otherwise the law can have no meaning.)
* Even if the Convention did have a single, unified intent, it is unclear how it could reliably be determined from two centuries' distance. (That may be, but what &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; often be determined is that an interpretation being considered is inconsistent with the original intent even though the exact intent is not known.)
* Many of the clauses of the Constitution are relative, and thus specifically defy any claim that it is possible to divine a single, indisputable outcome to any specific problem or dispute. Key passages in the Constitution were originally cast as flexible evaluations, such as "due process," a phrase that suggests the definitions, requirements and dimensions of court or other governmental proceedings sufficient in any given context to permit citizens to be deprived of their rights were never intended to be fixed forever. (A single indisputable decision is never the outcome using any other jurisprudence. This is an argument against making any decision at all. The judge must merely make his best effort to decide in a manner which is consistent with the intent of the framers or authors of legislation, so far as he can ascertain it.)
* In the case of [[Federal government of the United States|US Federal Law]], law is made by majority vote in two chambers, and is then signed by the [[President of the United States|President]]. 536 people are therefore potentially involved in this process, and not one of them needs to share the same intentions as any other of them in order to play their part in ratifying the bill. They need only vote; their vote will count the same if they share the same intent as their colleagues, if they do ''not'' share the intent of their colleagues, and indeed, if they ''have'' no particular intention, and are voting solely because their party whip handed them a note saying "be on the Senate floor at 9:36pm and say 'Aye'." Their vote will count even if they are falling-down drunk or if they have not even ''read'' the bill under consideration.{{ref|mm}} All of which is to say that giving effect to the intent of the legislature not only presumes that there '''is''' a singular intent – no less dubious an assertion where statutes are concerned than where the Constitution is – but, worse yet, the very diversity of these bodies may permit a judge to corrupt his inquiry by finding a floor statement or committee report which suggests an intent that the Judge thinks would be a good result.{{ref|leghist}} (The intent can be ascertained so far as the authors of the legislation or other less authoritative contemporary sources said what it was)
* Original intent may fall afoul of [[Legal formalism|formalist]] theories of law, which explicitly decline interest in how a law is made, an inquiry which is obviously at the core of an original intent inquiry.

* Original intent cannot be reconciled against [[Textualism]]. Most of those who are originalists in Constitutional matters are also textualists in statutory matters, and textualism rejects the value of the ''intentions'' of the legislature in passing a text.{{ref|scalia}} If one adopts originalism as an "error-correcting lens which fits over textualism to account for the passage of time," one cannot adopt an originalist theory which is incoherent with the underlying textualism.

==Other schools of thought==
In [[Canada]], the predominant school of thought for legal interpretation is the [[living tree doctrine]], under which interpretations can evolve along with the society, to deal with new conditions that were different or did not exist when the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]] was framed.

{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2011}}[[File:Vaderschapsverlof.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Demonstration for parental leave in the [[European Parliament]].]]
'''Parental leave''' or '''family leave''' is an [[employee benefit]] available in almost all countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/u-s-behind-world-parental-leave-policy-study-papua-new-guinea-swaziland-u-s-lag-article-1.134271|title=U.S. behind most of world in parental leave policy: study; Papua New Guinea, Swaziland &amp; U.S. lag|publisher=NY Daily News|date=24 Dec 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "parental leave" generally includes [[maternity]], [[Paternity (law)|paternity]], and [[adoption]] leave. A distinction between "maternity leave" and "parental leave" is sometimes made- maternity leave as the mother's leave time directly before and after childbirth and parental leave being the time given to care for newborns.&lt;ref name="Ruhm"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ruhm |first=Christopher J. |title=The Economic Consequences of Parental Leave Mandates: Lessons from Europe |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=113 |issue=1 |year=1998 |pages=285–317 |doi=10.1162/003355398555586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries and jurisdictions, "family leave" also includes leave provided to care for ill family members. Often, the minimum benefits and eligibility requirements are stipulated by law.

Unpaid parental or family leave is provided when an employer is required to hold an employee's job while that employee is taking leave. Paid parental or family leave provides [[paid time off]] work to care for or make arrangements for the welfare of a child or dependent family member. The three most common models of funding are social insurance/social security (where employees, employers, or taxpayers in general contribute to a specific public fund), employer liability (where the employer must pay the employee for the length of leave), and mixed policies that combine both social security and employer liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Addati|first=Laura|date=2015-01-01|title=Extending maternity protection to all women: Trends, challenges and opportunities|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/issr.12060/abstract|journal=International Social Security Review|language=en|volume=68|issue=1|pages=69–93|doi=10.1111/issr.12060|issn=1468-246X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parental leave has been available as a [[legal right]] and/or governmental program for many years, in one form or another. In 2014, the [[International Labour Organization]] reviewed parental leave policies in 185 countries and territories, and found that all countries except [[Papua New Guinea]] have laws mandating some form of parental leave.&lt;ref&gt;International Labour Organization. (2014). [http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_242615.pdf Maternity and Paternity at Work: Law and Practice Across the World].&lt;/ref&gt; A different study showed that of 186 countries examined, 96% offered some pay to mothers during leave, but only 81 of those countries offered the same for fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gualt|first1=Barbara|last2=Hartmann|first2=Heidi|last3=Hegewisch|first3=Ariane|last4=Milli|first4=Jessica|last5=Reichlin|first5=Lindsey|title=Paid Parental Leave in the United States|url=https://www.dol.gov/wb/resources/paid_parental_leave_in_the_united_states.pdf|publisher=Institute for Women’s Policy Research|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States]], [[Suriname]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and a few island countries in the [[Pacific Ocean]] are the only countries in the [[United Nations]] that do not require employers to provide paid time off for new parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/10/06/495839588/countries-around-the-world-beat-the-u-s-on-paid-parental-leave |title=Countries Around The World Beat The U.S. On Paid Parental Leave |last=Deahl |first=Jessica |website=NPR |publication-date=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private employers sometimes provide either or both unpaid and paid parental leave outside of or in addition to any legal mandate.

== Economic models ==

=== Benefits of universal, paid parental leave ===

==== Capabilities approach ====
[[Jeremiah Carter]] and [[Martha Nussbaum]] have developed a political model known as the [[Capabilities approach]], where basic freedoms and opportunities are included in economic assessments of a country's well-being, in addition to [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Amartya. 1999. Development as Freedom. New York: Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nussbaum"&gt;Nussbaum, Martha. 2011. Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martha Nussbaum|Nussbaum]] proposed [[Capability approach#Nussbaum.27s central capabilities|11 central capabilities]] as the minimum requirement for a decent society. In [[Martha Nussbaum|Nussbaum]]'s model, states should provide the resources and freedoms to ensure people have the opportunity to achieve a minimum threshold of each central capability. Universal, paid parental leave is an example resource states can provide so people have the option of starting a family while also working; for instance, under [[Capability approach#Nussbaum.27s central capabilities|capacity 10 (control of one's environment)]], the state has a responsibility to ensure all people have "the right to seek employment on an equal basis with others."&lt;ref name="Nussbaum" /&gt;

==== Income and workforce ====
Paid parental leave [[Incentive#Economics|incentivizes]] labor market attachment for women both before and after birth, affecting GDP and national productivity, as the [[workforce]] is larger.&lt;ref name="Geyer1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/diw/diwwpp/dp1366.html|title=The Effects of Family Policy on Mothers' Labor Supply: Combining Evidence from a Structural Model and a Natural Experiment|first1=Johannes|last1=Geyer|first2=Peter|last2=Haan|first3=Katharina|last3=Wrohlich|date=1 January 2014|publisher=|via=RePEc - IDEAS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kluve | first1 = J. | last2 = Tamm | first2 = M. | year = 2013 | title = Parental Leave Regulations, Mothers' Labor Force Attachment and Fathers' Childcare Involvement: Evidence from a Natural Experiment | url = | journal = Journal of Population Economics | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 983–1005 | doi = 10.1007/s00148-012-0404-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: Rønsen &amp; Kitterød, in their literature review on p. 60, reference several other citations to this same point, q.v., Marit Rønsen and Marianne Sundstrøm [1996]; Jutta M. Joesch [1997]; Christopher J. Ruhm [1998]; JaneWaldfogel, Yoshio Higuchi, and Masahiro Abe [1999]; Chiara Daniela Pronzato [2009]. These could be added&lt;/ref&gt; Parental leave increases income at the household level, as well, by supporting [[Working parent#Working mothers|dual-earner families]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Esping-Andersen | first1 = G | year = 2003 | title = Women in the New Welfare Equilibrium | url = | journal = [[The European Legacy]] | volume = 8 | issue = 5| pages = 599–610 | doi=10.1080/1084877032000153975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paid parental leave [[Incentive#Economics|incentivizes]] childbirth, which affects the future workforce. It is thus argued that paid parental leave, in contrast to unpaid parental leave, is harmful to children's welfare because in countries with an [[population aging|aging workforce]] or countries with [[Sub-replacement fertility]], children are born not because the parents want the child and can meet the child's needs but because children are expected to support their parents. Some see children as responsible for supporting all those in older generations in the society (not just the child's specific parents); their earnings are expected not to be saved for the children's own old age, but to be spent on the earlier generations' demand for [[Social Security (United States)|social security]] and [[pension]]s for which there was inadequate savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bittman | first1 = M | year = 1999 | title = Parenthood Without Penalty: Time Use And Public Policy In Australia And Finland | url = | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 27–42 | doi = 10.1080/135457099337798 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Esping-Andersen | first1 = G | year = 2003 | title = Women in the New Welfare Equilibrium | url = | journal = [[The European Legacy]] | volume = 8 | issue = 5| page = 606 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Challenges to universal, paid leave ===

==== Statistical discrimination ====
The [[Labour economics#Neoclassical microeconomics of labour markets|neoclassical model of labor markets]] predicts that if the cost of hiring women of child-bearing years is anticipated to increase (either because the employer is mandated to pay for maternity leave, or because she will be absent from work on public leave), then the "demand" for women in the labor market will decrease. While gender discrimination is illegal, without some kind of remedy, the neoclassical model would predict "statistical discrimination" against hiring women of child-bearing years.&lt;ref&gt;Akerlof, G. A., &amp; Kranton, R. E. (2010). Identity Economics: How Our Identities Shape Our Work, Wages, and Well-Being. Princeton: Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Esping-Andersen | first1 = G | year = 2003 | title = Women in the New Welfare Equilibrium | url = | journal = [[The European Legacy]] | volume = 8 | issue = 5| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Occupational sex segregation ====
If women take long parental leaves, the neoclassical model would predict that their lifetime earnings and opportunities for promotion will be less than their male or [[childfree]] counterparts, or the "[[motherhood penalty]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Theunisse | first1 = G. | last2 = Verbruggen | first2 = M. | last3 = Forrier | first3 = A. | last4 = Sels | first4 = L. | year = 2011 | title = Career Sidestep, Wage Setback? The Impact of Different Types of Employment Interruptions on Wages | url = | journal = Gender, Work &amp; Organization | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = e110–e131 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0432.2009.00471.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women may seek out employment sectors that are "family-friendly" (i.e., with generous parental leave policies), resulting in [[occupational sexism|occupational sex segregation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Datta Gupta | first1 = N. | last2 = Smith | first2 = N. | last3 = Verner | first3 = M. | year = 2008 | title = The Impact of Nordic Countries' Family Friendly Policies on Employment, Wages, and Children | url = | journal = Review of Economics of the Household | volume = 6 | issue = 1| pages = 65–89 | doi=10.1007/s11150-007-9023-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nielsen, Simonsen, and Verner examine what the different outcomes for women in [[Denmark]] are between the "family-friendly" and the "non-family-friendly" sector.&lt;ref name="Geyer1" /&gt; In [[Denmark]], the [[public sector]] is "family-friendly" because of its generous leave and employee benefits; workers decide which sector to work on based on their preferences and
opportunities. The study found that while in the "family-friendly" sector, there was basically no wage loss related to taking parental leave, women did have consistent earnings loss in the "non-family-friendly" private sector for a 1-year leave.&lt;ref name="Geyer1" /&gt;

==== Cost ====
Universal, paid parental leave can be privately funded (i.e., corporations are mandated to absorb the cost of paid parental [[paid time off|time off]] as part of [[employee benefit]]s) or publicly funded (i.e., transferred directly to workers on leave, like [[unemployment insurance]]). Concerns about private funding include the statistical discrimination described above as well as the costs to smaller businesses. Datta Gupta, Smith, &amp; Verneer found in 2008 that, while publicly funded parental leave has benefits, it is very expensive to fund and question if it is the most [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effective]] use of funds.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==== Criticism of the 'Father Quota' ====
Social norms have historically not included child care in the main responsibilities of fathers. However, in some, mainly western, countries, politicians, and social scientists argue for changing the role of the fathers, and the idea of the ‘new father’ has especially been shaped by the Nordic countries. The process enables fathers to rationalize their parenting style and align this with what characterizes good care. Even though the mother’s role as main parent has not changed, male parental leave is claimed by its supporters to transform the traditionally gendered father practices and to create a social morality in relation to partners and children. Some, however, consider that the allegedly positive effects of male parental leave are not supported by research, and warn that it might have negative effects. Norwegian psychology professor [[Leif Edward Ottesen Kennair]] believes the father's quota is indefensible from a psychological point of view, and argues that "we must at the very least ask ourselves what the consequences will be when we make a childhood environment that differs from what our species has evolved into." He believes the father's quota is "based on ideology, and only to an extremely limited extent on knowledge," arguing that it is "a social experiment, the effects of which are unknown.".&lt;ref name="aftenposten2291665"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article2291665.ece|title=Kvinner er mer opptatt av barna sine enn menn, sier forsker|publisher=[[Aftenposten]]|accessdate=2011-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other psychological perspectives summarise evidence and find that the role of a father in child development is very similar to that of a mother, which conflicts with the idea that greater paternal involvement in childcare could lead to subtantial and potentially dangerous consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Michael E. (2010) The Role of the Father in Child Development. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp;Sons&lt;/ref&gt; It also has to be considered that fathers from different classes see their roles alternatively during their paternity leave. Whereas middle class fathers consider themselves as suitable alternative to the mother having the same competencies, working class men see themselves more as supporters during their leave. In consequence middle class fathers mostly use their leave right after the mother returns to work, meanwhile working class fathers do their leave during the mother's leave.&lt;ref&gt;Brandth, B., &amp; Kvande, E. (2016). Fatherhood in the Nordic Welfare States: Comparing Care Policies and Practice. Bristol, United Kingdom: Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of parental leave ==
Typically, the effects of parental leave are improvements in prenatal and postnatal care, including a decrease in infant mortality.&lt;ref name="Motherhood Manifesto"&gt;{{cite book |last=Blades |first=Joan |first2=Kristin |last2=Rowe-Finkbeiner |year=2006 |title=The Motherhood Manifesto: What America's Moms Want and What to Do about It |location=New York |publisher=Nation |isbn=1-56025-884-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of parental leave on the labor market include an increase in employment, changes in wages, and fluctuations in the rate of employees returning to work. Leave legislation can also impact fertility rates.&lt;ref name="Utrecht"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/cje/bes052| title = Labour market effects of parental leave in Europe| journal = [[Cambridge Journal of Economics]]| volume = 37| issue = 4| pages = 845–862| year = 2012| last1 = Akgunduz | first1 = Y. E.| last2 = Plantenga | first2 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects on the labor market ===
A study in Germany found that wages decreased by 18 percent for every year an employee spends on parental leave.&lt;ref name="Utrecht" /&gt; However, after the initial decrease in wages, the employee’s salary rebounds faster than the salary of someone not offered parental leave.&lt;ref name="Utrecht" /&gt; A study of California’s leave policy, the first state in the U.S. to require employers to offer paid parental leave, showed that wages did increase.&lt;ref name="NBER"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/pam.21676| title = The Effects of California's Paid Family Leave Program on Mothers' Leave-Taking and Subsequent Labor Market Outcomes| journal = [[Journal of Policy Analysis and Management]]| volume = 32| issue = 2| pages = 224–245| year = 2013| last1 = Rossin-Slater | first1 = M.| last2 = Ruhm | first2 = C. J.| last3 = Waldfogel | first3 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parental leave can lead to greater job security.&lt;ref name="Utrecht" /&gt; Studies differ in how this helps return to work after taking time off. Some studies show that if a parent is gone for more than a year after the birth of a child, it decreases the possibility that he or she will return.&lt;ref name="Utrecht" /&gt; Other studies of shorter leave periods show that parents no longer need to quit their jobs in order to care for their children, so employment return increases.&lt;ref name="NBER" /&gt;

It does not appear that parental leave policies have had a significant effect on the gender wage gap, which has remained relatively steady since the late 1980s, despite increasing adoption of parental leave policies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rønsen | first1 = M. | last2 = Kitterød | first2 = R. H. | year = 2015 | title = Gender-equalizing family policies and mothers' entry into paid work: recent evidence from Norway | url = | journal = Feminist Economics | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 59–89 | doi=10.1080/13545701.2014.927584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Maternity leave and its effects ====

In the U.S., while the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]] allows for unpaid parental leave, parents often do not utilize this eligibility to its fullest extent as it is unaffordable. As a result, some studies show that the FMLA has had a limited impact on how much leave new parents take.&lt;ref name="HanWaldfogel"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Waldfogel|first2=J.|year=2003|title=Parental Leave: The Impact of Recent Legislation on Parents' Leave-Taking|url=|journal=Demography|volume=40|issue=1|pages=191–200|doi=10.1353/dem.2003.0003|last1=Han|first1=W.-J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though specific amounts can vary, having a child (including the cost of high-quality childcare) costs families approximately $11,000 in the first year.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; These high costs contribute to new mothers in the United States returning to work quicker than new mothers in European countries; approximately one-third of women in the United States return to work within three months of giving birth, compared to approximately five per cent in the UK, Germany, and Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;Berger, L.M., Hill, J. et al. 2005. "Maternity Leave, Early Maternal Employment and Child Health Development in the US." ''The Economic Journal''. 115(501):F29-F47.&lt;/ref&gt; and just over half of mothers in the United States with a child under the age of one work.&lt;ref&gt;(Johnson 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence that legislation for parental leave raises the likelihood of women returning to their previous jobs as opposed to finding a new job. This rise is thought to fall to between 10% and 17%. Simultaneously, there is a decrease in the percentage of women who find new jobs which falls between 6% and 11%. Thus, such legislation appears to increase how many women return to work post-childbirth by around 3% or 4%.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baum II|first=Charles L.|date=April 2003|title=The Effects of Maternity Leave Legislation on Mothers' Labor Supply after Childbirth|jstor=1061651|journal=Southern Economic Journal|volume=69|pages=772–799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it appears that parental leave policies do allow women to stay home longer before returning to work as the probability of returning to an old job falls in the second month after childbirth before dramatically rising in the third month. Although this legislation thus appears to have minimal effect on women choosing to take leave, it does appear to increase the time women take in leave.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Maternity leave legislation could pose benefits or harm to employers. The main potential drawback of mandated leave is its potential to disrupt productive activities by raising rates of employee absenteeism. With mandated leave for a certain period of time and facing prolonged absence of the mothers in the workplace, firms will be faced with two options: hire a temp (which could involve training costs) or function with a missing employee. Alternatively, these policies could be positive for employers who previously did not offer leave because they were worried about attracting employees who were disproportionately likely to use maternity leave. Thus, there is potential for these policies to correct [[market failure]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A drawback of rising leave at the societal level, however, is the resulting decrease in female labor supply. In countries with a high demand for labor, including many present-day countries with aging populations, a smaller labor supply is unfavorable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Something important to note for all the research cited above is that the results typically depend on how leave coverage is defined, and whether the policies are for unpaid or paid leave. Policies guaranteeing paid-leave are considered by some to be dramatically more effective than unpaid-leave policies.&lt;ref name="HanWaldfogel" /&gt;

For women individually, long breaks in employment, as would come from parental leave, negatively affects their careers. Longer gaps are associated with reduced lifetime earnings and lower pension disbursements as well as worsened career prospects and reduced earnings. Due to these drawbacks, some countries, notably Norway, have expanded family policy initiatives to increase the father's quota and expand childcare in an effort to work towards greater gender equality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to a 2016 study, the expansion of government-funded maternity leave in Norway from 18 to 35 weeks led mothers to spend more time at home without a reduction in family income.&lt;ref name="What is the case"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahl|first=Gordon B.|last2=Løken|first2=Katrine V.|last3=Mogstad|first3=Magne|last4=Salvanes|first4=Kari Vea|date=2016-03-23|title=What Is the Case for Paid Maternity Leave?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1162/REST_a_00602|journal=Review of Economics and Statistics|volume=98|issue=4|pages=655–670|doi=10.1162/REST_a_00602|issn=0034-6535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Paternity leave and its effects ====

Although parental leave is increasingly granted to fathers, mothers continue to take the majority of guaranteed parental leave.&lt;ref name="Ruhm" /&gt; When guaranteed leave is unpaid, research indicates that men's leave usage is unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waldfogel|first=J|last2=Han|first2=WJ|date=February 2003|title=Parental leave: the impact of recent legislation on parents' leave taking|journal=National Center for Biotechnology Information|volume=40|pages=191–200|pmid=12647520}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, where parental leave is guaranteed for both parents, the financial incentive, alone, was not enough to encourage fathers to take paternal leaves.&lt;ref&gt;VOGL, S., &amp; KRELL, C. (2012). PARENTAL LEAVE AND PARENTING BENEFITS: Potential Effects on Father Participation in Germany. ''International Journal of Sociology of the Family,'' ''38''(1), 19-38. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/43488388&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While uncommon on a worldwide scale some countries do reserve parts of the paid leave for the father, meaning it can't be transferred to the mother and lapses unless he uses it. Among the earliest countries to actively push for increased usage of paternity leave are the Nordic welfare states, starting with Sweden making paternal leave gender neutral in 1974 and soon followed by Iceland, Denmark, Norway and Finland. These countries lack a unified concept of paternity leave, each imposing different conditions, ratios and timescales, but are regarded as among the most generous in the world.

Partly in an initiative to combat the "[[Motherhood penalty]]," [[Norway]] in 1993 initiated a policy change to incentivize [[Fathers rights movement#Parental leave|paternal leave]], the so-called "[[father's quota]]", and Sweden followed suit in 1995. This means a certain number of parental leave-days can only be used by the father, and are otherwise lost. In countries in which leave entitlements include a father's quota there has been a pronounced impact, with the quota being credited for increasing paternal involvement and challenging gender roles within the family, promoting a more equal division of labor.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronsen|first=Marit|last2=Kitterod|first2=Ragni Hege|date=July 2014|title=Gender-Equalizing Family Policies and Mothers' Entry into Paid Work: Recent Evidence from Norway|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13545701.2014.927584|journal=Feminist Economics|volume=21|pages=59–89|doi=10.1080/13545701.2014.927584}}&lt;/ref&gt; To evaluate this change, Rønsen &amp; Kitterød looked at the rate and timing of women's return to work after giving birth, and the effect on this of the new parental leave policy. In their 2015 study, Rønsen &amp; Kitterød found [[women in Norway]] returned to work significantly faster after the policy change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Kitterød|first2=R. H.|year=2015|title=Gender-equalizing family policies and mothers' entry into paid work: recent evidence from Norway|journal=Feminist Economics|volume=21|issue=1|pages=59–89 [84]|last1=Rønsen|first1=M.|doi=10.1080/13545701.2014.927584}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, public or subsidized daycare was greatly expanded at the same time, so Rønsen &amp; Kitterød did not find that the "[[father's quota]]" was solely responsible for the timing of work entry. But it can be understood to have an effect on [[Division of labour#Gendered division of labour|division of household labor]] by gender when both parents can take time to care for a new baby.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Another impact from fathers taking more leaves is that in Norway, it has been shown to have the potential to either decrease or increase the time women take, depending on whether the mother's and father's childcare are seen as [[Substitute good|substitutes]] or [[Complement good|complements]]. If substitute goods, mothers are able to return to work sooner as fathers take some of the childcare responsibility. As for the latter, longer leave for fathers can motivate mothers to also stay home.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Fathers tend to use less parental leave than mothers in the United States as well as in other countries where paid leave is available,&lt;ref name="HanWaldfogel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bygren"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Duvander|first2=A.-Z.|year=2006|title=Parents' Workplace Situation and Fathers' Parental Leave Use|url=|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=68|issue=2|pages=363–372|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2006.00258.x|last1=Bygren|first1=M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this difference may have factors other than the financial constraints which impact both parents. Bygren and Duvander,&lt;ref name="Bygren" /&gt; looking at the use of parental leave by fathers in Sweden, concluded that fathers’ workplace characteristics (including the size of the workplace, whether there were more men or women in the workplace, and whether the workplace was part of the private or public sector) influenced the length of parental leave for fathers, as did the presence of other men who had taken parental leave at an earlier point in time. As of 2016 paternity leave accounts for 25% of paid parental leave in Sweden.

==== Length of leave ====
[[File:"WORKING MOTHERS - YOUR SCHOOLS CAN HELP" - NARA - 516193.jpg|thumb|Family policy during World War II when women were recruited into the workplace.]]
In 2013, Joseph, Pailhé, Recotillet, and Solaz published a [[natural experiment]] evaluating a 2004 policy change in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The economic impact of taking short parental leave: Evaluation of a French reform|last = Joseph|first = Olivier|date = 2013|journal = Labour Economics, 25(European Association of Labour Economists 24th Annual Conference, Bonn, Germany, 20–22 September 2012)|doi = 10.1016/j.labeco.2013.04.012|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Pailhé |volume=25 |pages=63–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were interested in the economic effects of full-time, short paid parental leave. Before the reform, women had a mandatory two-month parental leave, and could take up to three years unpaid parental leave with their job guaranteed, though most women only took the two months. The new policy, ''complément libre choix d'activité'' (CLCA), guarantees six months of paid parental leave. The authors found positive effects on employment: compared to women in otherwise similar circumstances before the reform, first-time mothers who took the paid leave after the reform were more likely to be employed after their leave, and less likely to stay out of the labor force. The authors point to similar results of full-time, short paid parental leave observed in Canada in 2008 by Baker and Milligan,&lt;ref&gt;Baker, M., Milligan, K.,2008. How does job-protected maternity leave affect mothers' employment? [https://www.jstor.org/journal/jlaboreconomics Journal of Labor Economics] 26,655–692.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Germany in 2009 by Kluve and Tamm.&lt;ref&gt;Kluve, J., Tamm, M.,2009. [http://ftp.iza.org/dp4500.pdf Now daddy's changing diapers and mommy's making her career: evaluating a generous parental leave regulation using a natural experiment]. IZA Discussion Papers 4500. Institute for the Study of Labor(IZA).&lt;/ref&gt; However, Joseph, et al., also found that wages were lower (relative to women before the reform) for medium- and highly educated women after the leave, which could be because the women returned to work part-time or because of a "[[motherhood penalty]]," where employers discriminate against mothers, taking the six-month leave as a "signal" that the woman will not be as good of an employee because of her mothering responsibilities.

Rasmussen conducted analyzed a similar [[natural experiment]] in Denmark with a policy change in 1984 where parental leave increased from 14 to 20 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rasmussen | first1 = A. W. | year = 2010 | title = Increasing the length of parents' birth-related leave: The effect on children's long-term educational outcomes | url = | journal = Labour Economics | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 91–100 | doi = 10.1016/j.labeco.2009.07.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rasmussen found the increased length of parental leave had no negative effect on women's wages or employment, and in the short-run (i.e., 12 months) it had a positive effect on women's wages, compared to the shorter leave. There was no difference on children's long-term educational outcomes before and after the policy change.

=== Effects on health and development ===

A Harvard report cited research showing paid maternity leave “facilitates breastfeeding and reduces risk of infection”&lt;ref name="Motherhood Manifesto" /&gt; but is not associated with changes in immunization rate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This research also found that countries with parental leave had lower infant mortality rates.&lt;ref name="Motherhood Manifesto" /&gt; Returning to work within 12 weeks was also associated with less regular medical checkups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berger|first=Lawrence M.|last2=Hill|first2=Jennifer|last3=Waldfogel|first3=Jane|date=February 2005|title=Maternity leave, early maternal employment and child health and development in the US|url=|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=115|pages=F29-F47|doi=10.1111/j.0013-0133.2005.00971.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from 16 European countries during the period 1969-1994 revealed that the decrease of infant mortality rates varied based on length of leave. A 10-week leave was associated with a 1-2% decrease; a 20-week leave with 2-4%; and 30 weeks with 7-9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruhm|first=C.|date=2000|title=Parental leave and child health|url=|journal=Journal of Health Economics|volume=19|pages=931–60|doi=10.1016/s0167-6296(00)00047-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States, which does not have a paid parental leave law, ranked 56th in the world in 2014 in terms of infant mortality rates, with 6.17 deaths per every 1,000 children born.&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research did not find any infant health benefits in countries with unpaid parental leave.

Paid leave, particularly when available prior to childbirth, had a significant effect on birth weight. The frequency of low birth rate decreases under these policies which likely contributes to the decrease in infant mortality rates as low birth weight is strongly correlated with infant death. However, careful analysis reveals that increased birth weight is not the sole reason for the decreased mortality rate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanaka|first=Sakiko|date=January 2005|title=Parental leave and child health across OECD countries|url=|journal=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0013-0133.2005.00970.x/abstract|volume=115|pages=F7-F28|doi=10.1111/j.0013-0133.2005.00970.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2016 study, the expansion of government-funded maternity leave in Norway from 18 to 35 weeks had little effect on children's schooling.&lt;ref name="What is the case" /&gt; However, when infants bond and have their needs met quickly by caregivers (mothers, fathers, etc.) they will become confident and be prepared to have healthy relationships throughout their life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/medicalcenter/healthtips/20100114_infant-bonding.html|title=Bonding is essential for normal infant development|website=UC Davis Medical Center|last1=Steinfeld|first1=Mary|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children whose mothers did not work in the first 9 months were found to be less ready for school at the age of 3 years. The effects of mother's employment appeared to be the most detrimental when employment started between the sixth and ninth month of life. The reasons for this were uncertain, but there is conjecture that there was something unusual for the group of mothers who returned to work in this time period as they represented only 5% of all families studied. Negative impacts in terms of school-readiness were most pronounced when the mother worked at least 30 hours per week. These findings were complicated by many factors, including race, poverty, and how sensitive the mother was considered. The effects were also greater in boys which is explained by the fact that many analysts consider boys more vulnerable to stress in early life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks-Gunn|first=Jeanne|last2=Han|first2=Wen-Jui|last3=Waldfogel|first3=Jane|date=August 2002|title=Maternal Employment and Child Cognitive Outcomes in the First Three Years of Life: The NICHD Study of Early Child Care|url=|journal=Child Development|volume=73|pages=1052–1072|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same Harvard report also linked paid parental leave and a child’s psychological health. It found that parents with paid parental leave had closer bonds with their children.&lt;ref name="Motherhood Manifesto" /&gt; Based on research of heterosexual couples, a better father’s immersion in the process of raising a child leads to an enhanced child’s development and furthermore improves the relationship between the two parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fira.ca/cms/documents/29/Effects_of_Father_Involvement.pdf Allen, Sarah and Kerry Daly. 2007. The Effects of Father Involvement: An Updated Research Summary of the Evidence. Centre for Families, Work &amp; Well-Being, University of Guelph. Guelph, Ontario. 53 p. (accessed February 3, 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, various OECD countries drew attention to the topic, especially to the time of the parental leave taken by fathers, and concluded that short-term paternal leaves still lead to positive outcomes for the child’s development. However, due to the typically higher income-levels of men, maternal leaves are preferred to paternal leaves since the family forfeits less income when the mother takes a break work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/75-001-x/2008106/article/10639-eng.htm|title=Perspectives on Labour and Income: Fathers' use of paid parental leave|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also observable improvements in the mental health of mothers when they are able to return to work later. While the probability of experiencing postpartum depression had no significant statistical change, longer leave (leave over 10 weeks) was associated with decreased severity of depression and decreased number of experienced symptoms. This reduction was, on average, between 5% and 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chatterji |first=Pinka |last2=Markowitz |first2=Sara |title=Does The Length Of Maternity Leave Affect Maternal Health? |journal=[[Southern Economic Journal]] |year=2005 |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=16–41 |doi=10.2307/20062092 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While studies have shown conflicting results, some research has shown a link between paid parental leave and higher fertility rates. The research looked at women 25–34 years old, who are more likely to be affected by leave legislation. Fertility rates peaked for those between 25-29 and 30-34 across European countries.&lt;ref name="Utrecht" /&gt;

=== Effects on economy ===
The economic consequences of parental leave policies are subject to controversy. According to a 2016 study, the expansion of government-funded maternity leave in Norway from 18 to 35 weeks had net costs which amounted to 0.25% of GDP, negative redistribution properties and implied a considerable increase in taxes at a cost to economic efficiency.&lt;ref name="What is the case" /&gt; In the U.S., paid family leave tends to lead to a higher employee retention rate and higher incomes for families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gualt|first1=Barbara|last2=Hartmann|first2=Heidi|last3=Hegewisch|first3=Ariane|last4=Milli|first4=Jessica|last5=Reichlin|first5=Lindsey|title=Paid Parental Leave in the United States|url=https://www.dol.gov/wb/resources/paid_parental_leave_in_the_united_states.pdf|publisher=Institute for Women’s Policy Research|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence from selected countries in Western Europe suggests that moderate levels of parental leave can encourage mothers to reenter the work force after having children, promoting national economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=Kimberly J.|title=Working mothers and the welfare state religion and the politics of work-family policies in Western Europe and the United States|date=2006|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, Calif.|isbn=9780804754132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects on gender equality ===
Parental leave policies has an impact on [[gender equality]] with regards to [[parenting]] and is therefore used by various countries as a tool to promote gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;Elborgh-Woytek, Katrin, Monique Newiak, Kaplana Kochhar, Stefania Fabrizio, Kangni Kopdar, Philippe Wingender, Benedict Clements, and Gerd Schwartz. 2013. Women, Work, and the Economy: Macroeconomic Gains from Gender Equity.

Empowering the Third Billion: Women and the World of Work in 2012. Booz &amp; Company Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries/regions have implement paid parental leave policies for both parents, which promotes gender equality, while a minority of countries, like the United States, only have unpaid maternity leave.

When discussing the sources of gender inequality, the lack of men's participation in parenting was rarely considered as a source of gender inequality. Various studies highlights the importance of egalitarian parental leave policies in achieving equal distribution of childcare between parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gornick|first=Janet C.|last2=Meyers|first2=Marcia K.|date=2008-09|title=Creating Gender Egalitarian Societies: An Agenda for Reform|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0032329208320562|journal=Politics &amp; Society|language=en|volume=36|issue=3|pages=313–349|doi=10.1177/0032329208320562|issn=0032-3292}}&lt;/ref&gt;Moreover, when discussing parental leave policies, generally the current state of largely maternity leave provided is compared with the absence of parental leave in the past, rather examining and comparing the impact of diverse policies seen in many countries around the world that distributes parental leave differently between both parents.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castro-García|first=Carmen|last2=Pazos-Moran|first2=Maria|date=2015-10-16|title=Parental Leave Policy and Gender Equality in Europe|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F13545701.2015.1082033|journal=Feminist Economics|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=51–73|doi=10.1080/13545701.2015.1082033|issn=1354-5701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistics show a positive correlation between maternal only leave policies and women’s employment, but the causation relationship cannot be firmly established.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While many believe that maternal leave policies encourage women's participation in the labor force, [[Anita Nyberg]] suggests that it is the other way around and that maternal leave policy's development was a response to women's participation in the labor force.&lt;ref&gt;Nyberg, Anita. (2004). Parental Leave, Public Childcare and the Dual Earner/ Dual Carer-Model in Sweden. &lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally agreed that men's involvement in childcare at the same level as women is essential for eliminating differences in gender roles. Thus, an increase in the use of parental leave by women (and lack thereof by men) will have a negative impact on gender equality. Inversely, an increase in the use of leave by men will have a positive impact.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Transferable leave appear to be fair and equal in theory, since they do not specifically allot childcare to women and even allow the family to choose. In practice, it leads to the majority of women using most of the parental leave.&lt;ref&gt;Ruhm, Christopher. 1998. “The Economic Consequences of Parental Leave Mandates: Lessons from Europe.” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 113 (1): 285-317&lt;/ref&gt;

Through examination of leave policies in twenty-one European countries by describing the existing policy schemes’ duration, payment, and transferability, Carmen Castro-Garcia created the Parental Leave Equality Index (PLEI) which can predict the participation of each parent in raising their children based on their gender, and the existing policy regarding parental leave. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;His model shows that a policy that provides equal, nontransferable, and well-paid leave for each parent (which no country has at the moment) will best encourage men's and women's equal participation in childcare.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== European Union ====
The [[European Union]] recognizes the ability for countries to utilize varying parental leave policies to affect labor force participation, the [[Labour economics|labor market]], maternal health, the [[work–life balance]] of parents, and the physical and emotional [[Child development|development of children]]. And by affecting the work-life balance of parents, it may reduce the barriers to participation of both parents in parenting. More specifically, paternity and parental leave policies are key to encouraging fathers’ involvement in parenting the child.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;van Belle, Janna, Paternity and parental leave policies across the European Union. European Commission, 2016. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1666.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christine Erhel &amp; Mathilde Guergoat-Larivière (2013) Labor Market Regimes, Family Policies, and Women's Behavior in the EU, Feminist Economics, 19:4, 76-109, DOI: 10.1080/13545701.2013.842649&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flag of Europe.svg|thumb|242x242px|European Union flag]]
In 2014, the [[European Parliament]] concludes that by promoting the uptake of parental leave and paternity leave by fathers, governments can aim to facilitate a more gender-equal distribution of care work, support mothers’ return to the labor market, and to equalize the circumstances in which women and men enter the labor market.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; And that the uptake of paternity leave and father-specific parental leave also has a positive effect on the work–life balance of families.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;European Parliament. 2014. ‘A new strategy for gender equality post 2015.’ European Parliament. As of 17 October 2018: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2014/509984/IPOL_STU(2014)509984_EN.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Findings by the European Parliament in 2015 found that 18 of the EU-28 countries offer paternity leave, and that the EU-average length is 12.5 days, ranging from one day in Italy to 64 working days in [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament. 2015b. ‘Maternity, paternity and parental leave: Data related to duration and compensation rates in the European Union.’ European Parliament. As of 17 October 2018: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/509999/IPOL_STU(2015)509999_EN.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For 23 EU member states, on average only 10 percent of fathers take parental leave, ranging from 0.02 per cent in Greece to 44 per cent in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament. 2015a. ‘At a glance: Maternity and paternity leave in the EU.’ European Parliament. As of 17 October 2018: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2014/545695/EPRS_ATA(2014)545695_REV1_EN&lt;/nowiki&gt;. pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The gender difference in the employment rate is representative of the gender employment gap; filling this gap is an important objective in promoting gender equality and is a part of the [[Europe 2020]] target of an employment rate of 75 per cent for both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission. 2010. 'EUROPE 2020.' European Commission. As of 17 October 2018: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;The uptake of leave by fathers can reduce the [[motherhood penalty]] by enabling mothers to return to the labor market, as illustrated by studies that have shown that the involvement of fathers in childcare has a positive effect on mothers’ full-time employment.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, H., M. Elliot &amp; C. Fagan. 2014. ‘Which fathers are the most involved in taking care of their toddlers in the UK? An investigation of the predictors of paternal involvement.’ Community, Work &amp; Family 17 (2): 163– 180&lt;/ref&gt;

Reduction of the [[gender pay gap]] (GPG) is also an important goal for the EU. In 2014 the GPG in the EU-28 was 16.1 percent, which means that for every euro men got paid in the EU, women got paid 83.9 cents.&lt;ref&gt;Eurostat. 2016. ‘Gender pay gap statistics.’ European Commission. As of 18 October 2018: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Gender_pay_gap_statistics&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (The GPG exists equally after correction for occupation and education level.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;) An study done on the gender pension gap estimates the gap to be around 40 percent, which is more than twice the gender pay gap&lt;ref&gt;Tinios, P., F. Bettio &amp; G. Betti. 2015. ‘Men, Women and Pensions.’ European Commission.  &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/documents/150618_men_women_pensions_en.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.Increased leave uptake by fathers can reduce the length of career interruptions for women, reduce part-time work by women and potentially reduce the GPG, all of which are leading causes of the gender pension gap.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission. 2014. ‘Report on equality between women and men 2014.’ European Commission.  &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/annual_reports/150304_annual_report_2014_web_en.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruhm, Christopher. 1998. “The Economic Consequences of Parental Leave Mandates: Lessons from Europe.” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 113 (1): 285-317&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nordic Countries ====
The advancement of gender equality has also been on the political agenda of [[Nordic countries]] for decades. Although, all Nordic countries have extended the total leave period, their politics towards father’s quota are different. [[Iceland]] and [[Norway]] have established equal 3 month quotas for the father. In [[Sweden]] 90 days cannot be transferred from one parent to the other—i.e. each parent gets at least 90 days of parental leave, thus the quota applies equally to both parents and is not specifically fathers.&lt;ref name="Sweden" /&gt; The only Nordic country that does not provide fathers with a quota is [[Denmark]]. However, the dual earner/dual care model seems to be the direction of all the Nordic countries are moving in the construction of their parental leave systems.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eydal|first1=G|last2=Gíslason|first2=I|last3=Rostgaard|first3=T|last4=Brandth|first4=B|last5=Duvander|first5=A|last6=Lammi-Taskula|first6=J|year=2015|title=Trends in parental leave in the Nordic countries: Has the forward march of gender equality halted?|url=|journal=Community, Work &amp; Family|volume=18|issue=2|pages=167–181|doi=10.1080/13668803.2014.1002754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done in Norway found that when parental leave is granted for both parents, there is still gender inequality observed in the form of mothers being more likely to have part-time jobs compared to non-mothers.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Since, the governments has provided child care support for parents who wants them to encourage mothers to return to full-time jobs earlier, and it is effective to a certain extent.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Marit Rønsen &amp; Ragni Hege Kitterød (2015) Gender-Equalizing Family Policies and Mothers' Entry into Paid Work: Recent Evidence From Norway, Feminist Economics, 21:1, 59-89, DOI: 10.1080/13545701.2014.927584&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Germany ====
[[File:Paid parental leave picnic (7174336376).jpg|thumb|Mother spending time with her child]]
In [[Germany]], original laws tackling gender inequality with respect to parenting date back to 1986 in both [[Eastern germany|Eastern]] and  [[Western Germany]] where one parent could take up to two years of leave after the birth of the child with a maximum allowance.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.perfar.eu/policy/family-children/germany|title=Family Policies: Germany (2014)|last=Radenacker|first=Anke|date=|website=perfar.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study done in 2006, 97% of the people who took the leave were mothers.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;VOGL, S., &amp; KRELL, C. (2012). PARENTAL LEAVE AND PARENTING BENEFITS: Potential Effects on Father Participation in Germany. ''International Journal of Sociology of the Family,'' ''38''(1), 19-38. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/43488388&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, declining [[Birth rate|birth rates]] and demographic change led to a new law, the "Parenting Benefits and Parental Leave Law" (Bundeselterngeld- und Elternzeit-Gesetz).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This change in family policy had mainly two aims: to reduce parents' financial loss in the first year after childbirth, and to encourage fathers to actively participate in childcare by taking parental leave.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

With this shift in paradigm, a better work-life balance and less support for the male breadwinner model was targeted. This was part of a "sustainable family policy" promoted by German unification and European integration with the underlying objective was to raise birth rates by providing financial incentive. &lt;ref&gt;Leitner, S., Ostner, I. &amp; Schmitt, C. (2008). Family Policies in Germany. In Ostner &amp; Schmitt (Eds), Family Policies in the Context of Family Change, (pp. 175-202). The Nordic Countries in Comparative Perspective. Wiesbaden: VS-Verlag&lt;/ref&gt;

The law's impact was mainly perceived positively with men reporting high motivation to take leave. So far this has not been reflected in official statistics, but Susanne Vogl concludes that if there is a general willingness of men to participate in parental leave the new Parenting Benefits regulations will help facilitate the actual decision to take a leave.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; 

==== United States ====
Even though, according to a survey conducted by [[WorldatWork]] and Mercer in 2017, 93% of Americans agree that mother should receive paid parental leave, while 85% agree that fathers should receive paid parental leave, as of October 2018, the [[United States]] as a whole does not grant paid parental leave to its workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatwork.org/docs/research-and-surveys/Survey-Report-Survey-of-Paid-Parental-Leave-in-the-US.pdf|title=Survey of Paid Parental Leave in the United States|last=WorldatWork|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Even though the nation does not have laws granting parental leave, certain states passed laws providing paid workers with such rights. As of July 2018, 6 states([[California]]&lt;ref&gt;(A.B. 908, 2015-2016 Leg., Reg. Sess. (Cal. 2016) (enacted)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(S.B. 63, 2017-2018 Leg., Reg. Sess. (Cal. 2017) (enacted))&lt;/ref&gt;, [[New Jersey]]&lt;ref&gt;(N.J. Stat. Ann. § 43:21-38) &lt;/ref&gt;, [[Rhode Island]]&lt;ref&gt;(R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-41-35(h))&lt;/ref&gt;, [[New York (state)|New York]]&lt;ref&gt;(S. 6406C, Part SS, 239th Leg., Reg. Sess. (N.Y. 2016) (enacted)) &lt;/ref&gt;, [[Washington (state)|Washington]]&lt;ref&gt;(S.B. 5975, 65th Leg., 3rd Special Sess. (Wash. 2017) (enacted))&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Massachusetts]]&lt;ref&gt;(H. 4640 § 29, 190th Gen. Court, Reg. Sess. (Mass. 2018) (enacted))&lt;/ref&gt;) and 1 district ([[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]&lt;ref&gt;(D.C. Law 21-264 (D.C. 2016))&lt;/ref&gt;) have enacted laws that grant parental leave as part of state paid family and medical leave insurance laws, with 4 being effective currently. In states without such laws, a small proportion of companies does provide paid parental leave&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-webber" /&gt;.

According to Eileen Appelbaum, the lack of parental leave policies results in many low income families struggling to support themselves financially if both parents are off work. As a result, many mothers leave work to take care of her children while the father remains at work, trying to financially support the family best he could.&lt;ref&gt;Kleman, Jacob, Kelly Daley, and Alyssa Pozniak. 2013. Family and Medical Leave in 2012: Technical Report, Cambridge: Abt Associates. &lt; &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.dol.gov/asp/evaluation/fmla/FMLA-2012-Technical-Report.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Appelbaum, Eileen and Ruth Milkman. 2011. Leaves That Pay: Employer and Worker Experiences with Paid Family Leave in California. Washington DC: Center for Economic and Policy Research.&lt;/ref&gt; This reinforces gender roles and gender inequality.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

==== Australia ====
[[File:Chinese couple in wedding attire at Temple of Heaven.jpg|thumb|Chinese couple getting married.]]
Australian government provides paid parental leave for both parents, but more for the mother compared to the father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/maternity-and-parental-leave|title=Maternity and Parental Leave|last=|first=|date=|website=Fair Work|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Michael Bittman (1999) Parenthood Without Penalty: Time Use And Public Policy In Australia And Finland, Feminist Economics, 5:3, 27-42, DOI: 10.1080/135457099337798&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/maternity-and-parental-leave/paid-parental-leave|title=Paid Parental Leave|last=|first=|date=|website=Fair Work|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Bittman saw that the reason they provide parental leave is unique in that they view children as “[[Public good|public goods]]”, and therefore, the state is responsible to provide and support the child. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; But like most places around the world, studies done in Australia shows that the inequality still persists within the family, and that women spends more time doing unpaid work (like parenting) compared to men.&lt;ref&gt;Bryson, Lois, Michael Bittman and Susan Donath. 1994. “Men’s and Women’s Welfare States: Tendencies to Convergence in Theory and Practice?” in Diane Sainsbury (ed.) Engendering Welfare States: Combining Insights of Feminist and Mainstream Research, pp. 118–31. London: Sage&lt;/ref&gt;

==== China ====
According to a study done by Nan Jia, during the [[History of the People's Republic of China (1949–1976)|Maoist era]], women's full participation in the labor force played a key role in the Chinese government's efforts to advance women's position in society, and to facilitate women's labor force participation, the Chinese government initiated a series of measures to mitigate the work–family conflict that women face during pregnancy and childbirth.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These measures included an entitlement to 56 days of paid maternity leave.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Nan Jia, Xiao-yuan Dong &amp; Yue-ping Song (2018) Paid Maternity Leave and Breastfeeding in Urban China, Feminist Economics, 24:2, 31-53, DOI: 10.1080/13545701.2017.1380309&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-reform era, a series of new regulations have been introduced to protect women's employment and reproductive rights in the new market economy. The [[Labour law|Labor Law]] adopted in 1995 ensured that women and men have equal employment rights and that employers will not lay off women employees or lower their wages for reasons of marriage, pregnancy, maternity leave, or breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/Law/2007-12/12/content_1383754.htm|title=laws|website=www.npc.gov.cn|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Labor Contract Law enacted in 2008 introduced the provision that prohibits employers from unilaterally terminating labor contracts with women employees who are pregnant, give birth, and care for a baby postpartum. Thus, under the Labor Law and Labor Contract Law, women employees are entitled to job-protected maternity leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/Law/2009-02/20/content_1471106.htm|title=laws|website=www.npc.gov.cn|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The post-reform era saw further improvements in maternity benefits. The length of paid maternity leave was extended from fifty-six days prior to reform, to ninety days in 1988, and to 98 days in 2012. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/china-maternity-leave-further-extended-by-provinces/|title=China: Maternity Leave Further Extended by Provinces|last=Zhang|first=Laney|date=May 3, 2016|website=Library of Congress|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;Most recently in 2016, paid maternity leave is extended to a minimum of 128 days after the long-standing one-child policy was replaced with a policy that encourages each couple to have two children. This latest extension of paid leave aims to increase fertility rates and slow the population aging process.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; None of the policies directly aim to tackle gender roles and gender inequality, but rather to solve immediate problems the country is facing at the time.  

== Private parental leave ==
{{Globalize |Section |date=May 2015 |discuss=Talk:Parental leave#Globalize }}

Some businesses adopt policies that are favorable to workers and [[public opinion]]. In their study of maternity leave policies in the United States, Kelly and Dobbin found that public policy surrounding [[pregnancy]] as a temporary disability (for instance, California's [[Pregnancy discrimination#Legislation|Family Temporary Disability Insurance]] program) gave rise to business practices that included maternity leave as a benefit.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kelly | first1 = E. | last2 = Dobbin | first2 = F. | year = 1999 | title = Civil Rights Law at Work: Sex Discrimination and the Rise of Maternity Leave Policies | url = | journal = The American Journal of Sociology | volume = 105 | issue = 2| pages = 455–492 | doi=10.1086/210317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies are starting to offer paid parental leave as a benefit to some American workers, seeing a profitable aspect of doing so, including: reduced [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]] costs, increased [[productivity#Drivers of productivity growth|productivity]] from workers, and increased rates of [[Employee retention|retention]] among women after childbirth. Some see the increase in paid parental leave as indicative of companies reaching out to women, as more women are working and returning to work after having children, and by doing so these companies generate positive publicity as employers with family-friendly workplaces.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, K., Helmuth, A.S. et al. 2009.

The report also noted that it would take newer workers four years to accrue enough paid leave (sick leave and annual leave) to equal the 12 weeks of unpaid parental leave provided under the FMLA, and that private sector companies which offer paid parental leave have a significant advantage over the federal government in the recruitment and retention of younger workers who may wish to have children.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

As of February 2018, multinational companies such as [[Deloitte]], [[TIAA]] and [[Cisco]] were providing parental-leave regardless of the parent's gender.&lt;ref name=wsj-webber&gt;{{cite news |last=Webber |first=Lauren |date=February 21, 2018 |title=Some Companies Move to Gender-Blind Leave for New Parents |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/modern-family-some-companies-move-to-gender-blind-leave-for-new-parents-1519225200 | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |location=The New York Times, New York City, United States |access-date=September 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variation in international law ==
The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] introduces "maternity leave with pay or with comparable [[social benefits]] without loss of former employment, seniority or social allowances".&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]], Article 11, 2 (b)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Maternity Protection Convention, 2000|Maternity Protection Convention C 183]] adopted in 2000 by [[International Labour Organization]] requires 14 weeks of maternity leave as minimum condition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maternity Protection Convention, 2000|Maternity Protection Convention C 183]], Article 4&lt;/ref&gt;

National laws vary widely according to the politics of each jurisdiction. As of 2012, only three countries do not mandate paid time off for new parents: [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Lesotho]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Addati, L., Cassirer, N., &amp; Gilchrist, K. (2014, May 13).

Unless otherwise specified, the information in the tables below is gathered from the most recent [[International Labour Organization]] reports. '''Maternity leave''' refers to the legal protection given to the mother immediately after she gives birth (but may also include a period before the birth), '''paternity leave''' to legal protection given to the father immediately after the mother gives birth, and '''parental leave''' to protected time for childcare (usually for either parent) either after the maternity/paternity leave or directly immediately after birth (for example when the parent is not eligible for maternity/paternity leave, and/or where the time is calculated until the child is a specific age - therefore excluding maternity/paternity leave - usually such jurisdictions protect the job until the child reaches a specific age.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in [[Czech Republic]]: "Section 196 Parental Leave reads: "In order to extend the care being given to a child, the employer shall grant a female or male employee parental leave if so requested (applied for). Parental leave is granted to the mother of a child upon termination of her maternity leave and to the father of a child from the day when the child is born and it is granted within the scope as requested (as applied for), but '''no longer than until the day when the child reaches the age of three years'''." [http://www.mpsv.cz/files/clanky/3221/labour_code.pdf#]&lt;/ref&gt;) Others allow the parental leave to be transferred into part-time work time. Parental leave is generally available to either parent, except where specified. Leave marked "Unpaid" indicates the job is protected for the duration of the leave. Different countries have different rules regarding eligibility for leave, and long a parent has to have worked at their place of employment prior to giving birth before they are eligible for paid leave. In the [[European Union]], the policies vary significantly by country - with regard to length, to payment, and to how parental leave relates to prior maternity leave - but the EU members must abide by the minimum standards of the [[Pregnant Workers Directive]] and [[Parental Leave Directive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/rights/work-life-balance/index_en.htm|title=Professional, private and family life - European Commission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "first parental leave" must be taken (by either the mother or the father) immediately after the end of maternity leave. The "second parental leave" may be taken by the other parent at any time up until the child's 6th birthday.

Parental leave can be taken in a variety of formats:

* 4 or 6 months' full-time leave
* 8 or 12 months with 50% leave and 50% working
* 4 months' leave split over a maximum period of 20 months
* 1 day per week on leave for up to 20 months

The latter three options require the employer's approval. The first option is an absolute right and cannot be refused by the employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cae.public.lu/fr/conge-parental/informations-generales/modeles.html|title=Modèles|access-date=2018-06-11|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As international organizations are not subject to the legislation of any country, they have their own internal legislation on parental leave.

| 16 weeks 100% (however, no fewer than 10 weeks must be after delivery, even if the pre-delivery leave was longer due to a late birth)
| 4 weeks 100% (or 8 weeks for staff members serving at locations where they are not allowed to live with their family)

|
| The fact that a staff member is or will be on parental leave cannot be a factor in deciding contract renewal. To ensure that this is enforced, if a contract ends while the staff member is on parental leave, the contract must be extended to cover the duration of such leave.

{{Criminal procedure (trial)}}
'''Parole''' is a temporary release of a [[prisoner]] who agrees to certain conditions before the completion of the maximum sentence period, originating from the [[French language|French]] ''[[wikt:parole#French|parole]]'' ("voice, spoken words"). The term became associated during the [[Middle Ages]] with the release of prisoners who gave their word.

This differs greatly from [[amnesty]] or [[commutation of sentence]] in that parolees are  still considered to be serving their sentences, and may be returned to prison if they violate the conditions of their parole. Conditions of parole often include things such as obeying the law, not voting in an election, refraining from drug and alcohol use, avoiding contact with the parolee's victims, obtaining employment and keeping required appointments with a [[parole officer]]. Should a parolee have legal dependents, namely minor children, the parolee may also be required to show cause of being a dedicated caregiver. A specific type of parole is medical parole or [[compassionate release]] which is the release of prisoners on medical or humanitarian grounds. Some justice systems, such as the United States federal system, place defendants on [[supervised release under United States federal law|supervised release]] after serving their entire prison sentence; this is not the same as parole. In [[Colorado]], parole is an additional punishment after the entire prison sentence is served, called "mandatory parole", per §18-1.3-401(1)(a)(V)(B).

==Development of modern parole==
[[Alexander Maconochie (penal reformer)|Alexander Maconochie]], a Scottish geographer and captain in the [[Royal Navy]], introduced the modern idea of parole when, in 1840, he was appointed superintendent of the British penal colonies in [[Norfolk Island]], Australia. He developed a plan to prepare them for eventual return to society that involved three grades. The first two consisted of promotions earned through good behaviour, labour, and study. The third grade in the system involved conditional liberty outside of prison while obeying rules. A violation would return them to prison and they would start all over again through the ranks of the three-grade process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Joel Samaha | title=Criminal Justice | publisher=[[Thomson/Wadsworth]] | place=Belmont, CA | date=2006 | isbn=9780534645571 | oclc=61362411 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=barry&gt;John V.

In an instance of [[multiple discovery]], in 1846, [[Arnould Bonneville de Marsangy]] proposed the idea of parole (which he termed "preparatory liberations") to the Civil Tribunal at [[Reims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Normandeau |first=André |title=Pioneers in Criminology: Arnould Bonneville de Marsangy (1802-1894) |journal=[[The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology, and Police Science]] |publisher=[[Northwestern University School of Law]] |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=28–32 |url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5565&amp;context=jclc |quote=Historical innovations are often created independently and almost simultaneously. This seems to be the case about the origins of parole, especially in view of factors of time and means of communication. In effect, Maconochie developed his scheme in the years 1840-1844 as governor of Norfolk Island, a famous penal colony east of Australia, whereas Bonneville's ideas came out in the years 1846-1847. Our knowledge of the slowness of communications at the time, especially in such a sector of activity, leaves us with the impression that Bonneville really did not know about Maconochie's proposal.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title="Twenty-Third Annual Report of the Executive Committee of the Prison Association of New York for 1867" |date=January 29, 1868 |publisher=C.

==Canada==
In general, in Canada, prisoners are eligible to [[Parole Board of Canada|apply for full parole]] after serving one-third of their sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Release - Fact Sheet|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/parole-board/corporate/publications-and-forms/fact-sheets/types-of-release-fact-sheet.html?wbdisable=true|website=Government of Canada|accessdate=9 August 2017|date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners are also eligible to apply for [[day parole]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/parole/002007-0003-eng.shtml | title=Types of Release | publisher=Correctional Services Canada | date=2014-12-01 | access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can do this before being eligible to apply for full parole.

Any prisoner whose sentence is less than two years is sent to a correctional [[Provincial correctional services in Canada|facility in the province or territory that convicted him or her]], whilst anyone sentenced to serve no less than two years will be sent to a [[Correctional Service of Canada|federal correctional facility]] and will thus have to deal with the [[Parole Board of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/media-room/009-0002-eng.shtml |title=Frequently Asked Questions|first= |last= |date= |website=Correctional Service Canada |publisher= |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parole is an option for most prisoners. However, parole is not guaranteed, particularly for prisoners serving life or indeterminate sentences. In cases of first-degree murder, one can apply for parole after 25 years if convicted of a single murder. However, if convicted of multiple murder (either first or second-degree), the sentencing judge has the option to make parole ineligibility periods consecutive - thereby extending parole ineligibility beyond 25 years and, in rare cases, beyond a normal life-span.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/10/31/justin-bourque-gets-unprecedented-five-life-sentences-for-moncton-shootings/|title=Justin Bourque handed harshest sentence since Canada's last execution more than 50 years ago|first=Michael|last=MacDonald|date=31 October 2014|work=[[National Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/winnipeg-killing-machine-who-targeted-homeless-men-gets-three-life-sentences-no-parole|title=Winnipeg ‘killing machine’ who targeted homeless men gets three life sentences, no parole|author=|date=28 June 2016|website=nationalpost.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
In [[China]], prisoners are often granted medical parole or [[compassionate release]], which releases them on the grounds that they must receive medical treatment which cannot be provided for in prison. Occasionally, medical parole is used as a no-publicity way of releasing an accidentally imprisoned convict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Chinese legal code has no explicit provision for exile, but often dissidents are released on the grounds that they need to be treated for a medical condition in another country, and with the understanding that they will be reincarcerated if they return to China. Dissidents who have been released on medical parole include [[Ngawang Chophel]], [[Ngawang Sangdrol]], [[Phuntsog Nyidron]], [[Takna Jigme Zangpo]], [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]], [[Wei Jingsheng]], [[Gao Zhan (alleged spy)|Gao Zhan]] and [[Fang Lizhi]].

== Israel ==
Until 2001, parole in Israel was possible only after the prisoner had served two thirds of their sentence. On 13 February 2001 the [[Knesset]] passed a bill, brought forward by [[Reuven Rivlin]] and [[David Libai]], which allowed the early release of prisoners who had served half of their prison term. The law was originally intended to help ease overcrowding in prisons.

==Italy==
{{main article|Libertà condizionata}}
''Libertà condizionata'' is covered by Article 176 of the Italian Penal Code. A prisoner is eligible if he has served at least 30 months (or 26 years for life sentences), and the time remaining on his sentence is less than half the total (normally), a quarter of the total (if previously convicted or never convicted) or five years (for sentences greater than 7.5 years). In 2006, 21 inmates were granted ''libertà condizionata''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

==New Zealand==
{{see also|New Zealand Parole Board}}
In New Zealand, inmates serving a short-term sentence (up to two years) are automatically released after serving half their sentence, without a parole hearing.  Inmates serving sentences of more than two years are normally seen by the New Zealand Parole Board after serving one-third of the sentence, although the judge at sentencing can make an order for a minimum non-parole period of up to two-thirds of the sentence. Inmates serving [[Life imprisonment in New Zealand|life sentence]]s usually serve a minimum of 10 years, or longer depending on the minimum non-parole period, before being eligible for parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paroleboard.govt.nz/about-us/cases-and-eligibility.html |title=Cases and Eligibility |publisher=Paroleboard.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505131850/http://www.paroleboard.govt.nz/about-us/cases-and-eligibility.html |archivedate=2012-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parole is not an automatic right and it was declined in 71 percent of hearings in the year ending 30 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.paroleboard.govt.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/477515/NZPB_Annual_Report_09_10.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-06-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004235056/http://www.paroleboard.govt.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/477515/NZPB_Annual_Report_09_10.pdf |archive-date=2011-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many sentences include a specific non-parole period.

==United States==

===Early history===
[[Penologist]] [[Zebulon Brockway]] introduced parole when he became superintendent of [[Elmira Correctional Facility|Elmira Reformatory]] in [[Elmira, New York]]. To manage prison populations and rehabilitate those incarcerated, he instituted a two-part strategy that consisted of indeterminate sentences and parole releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o0rjRPnO7K4C&amp;pg=PA408&amp;lpg=PA408&amp;dq=history+of+parole&amp;source=web&amp;ots=GjoaCigjgo&amp;sig=3kh6yHRFWCI0CIpEhu9-IREJEsU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA408,M1 |title=Criminal Justice - Joel Samaha - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
In the [[United States]], courts may specify in a sentence how much time must be served before a prisoner is eligible for parole.  This is often done by specifying an indeterminate sentence of, say, "15 to 25 years", or "15 years to life".  The latter type is known as an indeterminate life sentence; in contrast, a sentence of "life without the possibility of parole" is known as a determinate life sentence.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Jeanice D.'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/28C3d210.htm 28 Cal. 3d 210] (1980) ("25 years to life" is indeterminate life sentence implying that minor convicted of first-degree murder was eligible for commitment to California Youth Authority rather than determinate life sentence which would require incarceration in regular prison).&lt;/ref&gt;

On the federal level, Congress abolished parole in the [[Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984]] (Pub. L. No. 98-473 § 218(a)(5), 98 Stat. 1837, 2027 [repealing 18 U.S.C.A. § 4201 et seq.]). Federal prisoners may, however, earn a maximum of 54 days good time credit per year against their sentence (18 U.S.C.A. § 3624(b)). At the time of sentencing, the federal judge may also specific a post-imprisonment period of supervised release.&lt;ref name="US-legal"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Supervised Release Law and Legal Definition |publisher=US Legal |url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/s/supervised-release/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823060226/https://definitions.uslegal.com/s/supervised-release/ |archive-date=23 August 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Parole Commission still has jurisdiction over parole for those prisoners convicted of felonies in the District of Columbia and who are serving their sentences there, as well as over certain federally incarcerated military and international prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=United States Parole Commission |date=February 2012 |publisher=United States Department of Justice |url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/jmd/legacy/2013/10/18/fy13-uspc-justification.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313033033/https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/jmd/legacy/2013/10/18/fy13-uspc-justification.pdf |archive-date=13 March 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=History of the Federal Parole System |date=May 2003 |publisher=United States Parole Commission |url=http://www.fedcure.org/information/TheHistoryOfTheFederalParoleSystem-2003.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026004400/http://www.fedcure.org/information/TheHistoryOfTheFederalParoleSystem-2003.pdf |archive-date=26 October 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all |access-date=17 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most states, the decision of whether an inmate is paroled is vested in a paroling authority such as a parole board. Mere good conduct while incarcerated in and of itself does not necessarily guarantee that an inmate will be paroled. Other factors may enter into the decision to grant or deny parole, most commonly the establishment of a permanent residence and immediate, gainful employment or some other clearly visible means of self-support upon release (such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] if the prisoner is old enough to qualify). Many states now permit sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole (such as for [[murder]] and [[espionage]]), and any prisoner not sentenced to either this or the [[death penalty]] will eventually have the [[right to petition]] for release (one state{{spaced ndash}}[[Alaska]]{{spaced ndash}}maintains neither the death penalty nor life imprisonment without parole as sentencing options).

Before being granted the privilege of parole, the inmate meets with members of the parole board and is interviewed,  The parolee also has a psychological exam. The inmate must first agree to abide by the conditions of parole set by the paroling authority. While in prison, the inmate signs a parole certificate or contract. On this contract are the conditions that the inmate must follow. These conditions usually require the parolee to meet regularly with his or her parole officer or community corrections agent, who assesses the behavior and adjustment of the parolee and determines whether the parolee is violating any of his or her terms of release (typically these include being at home during certain hours which is called a curfew, maintaining steady employment, not [[wikt:Appendix:Glossary of legal terms#Abscond|absconding]], refraining from illicit drug use and, sometimes, abstaining from [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]), attending drug or alcohol counseling, and having no contact with their victim.  The inmate gives an address which is verified by parole officers as valid before the inmate is released to parole supervision.

Upon release, the parolee goes to a parole office and is assigned a parole officer.  Parole officers make unannounced visits to parolees' houses or apartments to check on them.  During these home visits officers look for signs of drug or alcohol use, guns or illegal weapons, and other illegal activities. Should parolees start to use drugs or alcohol, they are told to go to drug or alcohol counseling and [[Narcotics Anonymous]] or [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings. Should they not comply with conditions on the parole certificate a warrant is issued for their arrest.  Their parole time is stopped when the warrant is issued and starts only after they are arrested.  They have a [[Morrissey Hearing|parole violation hearing]] within a specified time, and then a decision is made by the parole board to revoke their parole or continue the parolee on parole. In some cases, a parolee may be discharged from parole before the time called for in the original sentence if it is determined that the parole restrictions are no longer necessary for the protection of society (this most frequently occurs when elderly parolees are involved).

Service members who commit crimes while in the [[US military|U.S. military]] may be subject to [[court martial]] proceedings under the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ). If found guilty, they may be sent to [[Federal prison|federal]] or [[military prisons]] and upon release may be supervised by U.S. [[Federal Probation]] officers.

The United States is the only nation in the world where parole is a politically divisive issue. According to the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], at least sixteen states have removed the option of parole entirely, and four more have abolished parole for certain violent offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Quality of snitches declining as result of sentencing laws |date=17 August 1997 |newspaper=Arizona Republic |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=Parole system in transition assailed as unfair |magazine=Newsday |date=2 May 2007 |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--parolequestioned0505may05,0,1199416.story |df=dmy}}{{Deadlink|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During elections, politicians whose administrations parole any large number of prisoners (or, perhaps, one notorious criminal) are typically attacked by their opponents as being "soft on crime". The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) stated in 2005 that about 45% of parolees completed their sentences successfully, while 38% were returned to prison, and 11% absconded. These statistics, the DOJ says, are relatively unchanged since 1995; even so, some states (including [[New York (state)|New York]]) have abolished parole altogether for violent felons, and the federal government abolished it in 1984 for all offenders convicted of a federal crime, whether violent or not. Despite the decline in jurisdictions with a functioning parole system, the average annual growth of parolees was an increase of about 1.6% per year between 1995 and 2002.

A variant of parole is known as "[[time off for good behavior]]", or, colloquially, "good time". Unlike the traditional form of parole{{spaced ndash}}which may be granted or denied at the discretion of a parole board{{spaced ndash}}time off for good behavior is automatic absent a certain number (or gravity) of infractions committed by a convict while incarcerated (in most jurisdictions the released inmate is placed under the supervision of a parole officer for a certain amount of time after being so released). In some cases "good time" can reduce the original sentence by as much as one-third. It is usually not made available to inmates serving life sentences, as there is no release date that can be moved up.

===Difference between parole and mandatory supervision===
Some states in the United States have what is known as "mandatory supervision", whereby an inmate is released before the completion of their sentence due to legal technicalities which oblige the offender justice system to free them. In the federal prison system,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://famm.org/projects/federal/us-congress/good-time-credit-for-federal-prisoners/ “Good Time Credit” for Federal Prisoners] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614143028/http://famm.org/projects/federal/us-congress/good-time-credit-for-federal-prisoners/# |date=2017-06-14 }}." [[Families Against Mandatory Minimums]]. Retrieved on May 10, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and in some states such as Texas, inmates are compensated with "[[good conduct time|good time]]", which is counted towards time served. For example, if an inmate served five years of a ten-year prison term, and also had five years of "good time", they will have completed their sentence "on paper", obliging the state to release them unless deemed a threat to society in writing by the parole board. Where parole is granted or denied at the discretion of a parole board, mandatory supervision does not involve a decision making process: one either qualifies for it or does not. Mandatory supervision tends to involve stipulations that are more lenient than those of parole, and in some cases place no obligations at all on the individual being released.

===US immigration law===
{{main article|Parole (United States immigration)}}
In US [[immigration law]], the term ''parole'' has two meanings related to allowing persons to enter or leave the United States without the normally required documentation.

==Prisoners of war==
Parole is "the agreement of persons who have been taken prisoner by an enemy that they will not again take up arms against those who captured them, either for a limited time or during the continuance of the war."&lt;ref&gt;2 Bouvier's Law Dictionary 2459 (1914)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[US Department of Defense]] defines parole more broadly: "Parole agreements are promises given the captor by a [[POW]] to fulfill stated conditions, such as not to bear arms or not to escape, in consideration of special privileges, such as release from captivity or lessened restraint."&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Defense Directive 1300.7, Training and Education Measures Necessary to Support the Code of Conduct (23 December 88).&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of paroling enemy troops began thousands of years ago, at least as early as the time of [[Carthage]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert C. Fooks, Prisoners of War 297 (1924).&lt;/ref&gt; Parole allowed the prisoners' captors to avoid the burdens of having to feed and care for them while still avoiding having the prisoners rejoin their old ranks once released; it could also allow the captors to recover their own men in a [[prisoner exchange]]. [[Hugo Grotius]], an early international lawyer, favorably discussed prisoner of war parole.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugo Grotius]], ''[[De Jure Belli ac Pacis]]'' (1625), reprinted in 2 Classics of International Law 853-54 (J. Scott ed. 1925).&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[American Civil War]], both the [[Dix–Hill Cartel]] and the [[Lieber Code]] set out rules regarding prisoner of war parole.&lt;ref&gt;[[James M. McPherson]], ''[[Battle Cry of Freedom (book)|Battle Cry of Freedom]]'' 791 (1988); U.S. Army General Orders No. 100 (24 April 1863), reprinted in R. S. Hartigan, Lieber's Code and the Law of War 45–71 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Lieber]]'s thoughts on parole later reappeared in the Declaration of Brussels of 1874, the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]], and the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War.&lt;ref&gt;Annex to Hague Convention IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Art. 10 (1907) and Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Art. 21 (1949), both reprinted in Documents on the Laws of War 216 (A. Roberts &amp; R. Guelff (ed.), 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, current policy prohibits US military personnel who are prisoners of war from accepting parole. The [[Code of the United States Fighting Force]] states: "I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy."&lt;ref&gt;Code of Conduct for Members of the Armed Forces of the United States, Exec. Order No. 10,631, 20 Fed. Reg. 6057, 3 C.F.R. 1954–58 Comp. 266 (1955), as amended by Exec. Order No. 12,017, 42 Fed. Reg. 57941 (1977); and Exec. Order No. 12,633, 53 Fed. Reg. 10355 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; The position is reiterated by the Department of Defense. "The United States does not authorize any Military Service member to sign or enter into any such parole agreement."&lt;ref&gt;DoD Directive 1300.7, Enclosure 2, Para. B3a(5).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18298">'''Particularly serious crime''' in the [[Immigration and Nationality Act]] (INA) of the [[United States]] refers to any criminal [[conviction]] that manifestly renders the actor a danger to the community of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|8|1158|b|2|A|ii}} ("'''Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an [[alien (law)#United States|alien]] if the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] determines that— ... the alien''', having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, '''constitutes a danger to the community of the United States'''") (emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Matter of N-A-M-"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diego v.

(emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt; This legal finding "is consistent with one of the most basic [[statutory interpretation#Canons|interpretive canons]], that a [[statutory law|statute]] should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant."&lt;ref name="statutory interpretation"&gt;''[[Rubin v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2630">A '''perjury trap''' is a form of [[prosecutorial misconduct]] in which a prosecutor calls a witness to testify, typically before a [[grand jury]], with the intent of coercing the witness into [[perjury]] (intentional deceit under oath).&lt;ref name=Gershman&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gershman|first=Bennett L.|date=1981|title=The "Perjury Trap"|url=http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1169&amp;context=lawfaculty|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|volume=129|issue=624|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most often a perjury trap is employed because the prosecutor is unable to prosecute the defendant on other charges.

As an example, suppose that a person committed a crime for which they were never prosecuted, but the [[statute of limitations]] on that crime has expired.

'''Prodnalog''' ({{lang-rus|Продналог|p=prədnɐˈlok}}, [[syllabic abbreviation|from]] '''прод'''овольственный '''налог''', '''''Prod'''ovolstvenniy '''nalog'''''; {{literally}} "food tax") is the [[Russian language|Russian]] word for a [[taxation|tax]] on food production, [[barter|paid in kind]] in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], and sometimes known as "the '''Tax in Kind'''". ''Prodnalog'', which replaced ''[[prodrazvyorstka]]'', was introduced by a [[Soviet Decrees|Decree]] of the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] on March 21, 1921 and was abolished in 1924.

The transition to prodnalog was the first act of the [[New Economic Policy]] and a necessary incentive for increasing [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[agricultural]] production . The [[peasant]]s knew in advance how much produce they would have to surrender to the state. The [[Tax rate|rate]] of prodnalog was much smaller than [[prodrazvyorstka]]. For comparison, in 1920-1921 the peasants surrendered to the state 367 million ''[[pood]]s'' (6,010,000 [[tonne|metric tons]]) of [[cereal]]s through prodrazvyorstka, as opposed to 240 million poods (3,930,000 metric tons) in 1921-1922 through prodnalog.

During the first year of introduction of prodnalog, a significant amount of [[bread]] and other products remained at peasant [[household]]s' disposal, which provided an incentive for peasants to develop their own household [[economy]], widen the sowing areas, increase the total number of [[livestock]] and [[productivity]] of [[agriculture|crops]]. The rate of prodnalog on each kind of agricultural product was determined depending on local conditions and prosperity of a given peasant household. The Soviet state adhered to a policy of [[progressive taxation]]; the highest rate of prodnalog had to be paid by the [[kulak]] households.

In March and April 1921, a number of [[Soviet Decrees]] introduced a natural tax on bread, [[potato]], oilseeds, [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[dairy products]], [[wool]], [[Hide (skin)|hides]], [[flax]] and [[Industrial hemp|hemp]] linen, [[tobacco]] etc. The collection of agricultural goods in excess of prodnalog, if necessary, was intended to be made on a [[barter]] basis by giving peasants manufactured goods. In order to accelerate the expansion of [[commodity]] circulation, create necessary conditions for developing [[farming]] and [[industry]] and speed up the productive forces of the country, the government encouraged small-scale production all over  [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Union]]. The introduction of prodnalog revived the trade and created a different kind of relations between the city and the village.   
       
By the decision of the [[12th Congress of the RCP(b)|12th Congress]] of the [[CPSU|RCP(b)]] (April 1923), prodnalog and other taxes in the rural areas were exchanged for a universal direct agricultural tax (decree of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and [[Sovnarkom]] on May 10, 1923). The latter would be collected in [[monetary]] form starting in 1924, with the establishment of [[hard currency]] in the [[USSR]].

In the context of [[European Union]] law, a '''public service obligation''' or '''PSO''' means an obligation imposed on an organisation by [[legislation]] or [[contract]] to provide a [[service of general interest]] within the European Union territories. PSOs may operate in any field of public service, but [[postal services]], [[social services]], [[Energy law|energy]], [[Transport law|transport]] and [[Banking law|banking]] are identified as specific sectors where the concept is relevant.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, [http://ec.europa.eu/services_general_interest/docs/comm_quality_framework_en.pdf A Quality Framework for Services of General Interest in Europe, Brussels 20.12.2011 COM(2011)900 Final]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport law==
[[File:Dash 8.jpg|thumb|right|Two [[de Havilland Canada|DHC]] [[de Havilland Canada Dash 8|Dash-8-100]] aircraft of [[Widerøe]] of Norway at [[Trondheim Airport, Værnes]]. Widerøe makes a large portion of its revenue from PSO routes like these in Northern and Western Norway]]
In the context of EU transport law, a PSO is an arrangement in which a governing body or other authority offers an [[auction]] for [[subsidy|subsidies]], thereby permitting the winning company a [[monopoly]] to operate a specified service of [[public transport]] for a specified period of time for the given subsidy. This is done in cases where there is not enough [[revenue]] for routes to be profitable in a [[free market]], but where there is a socially desirable advantage in this transport being available. The use of PSO can be applied to many [[mode of transport]], including [[air transport|air]], [[ship transport|sea]], [[road transport|road]] or [[rail transport|rail]]. In many cases the introduction of PSO has been a way to [[privatization|privatize]] former government owned transport. The infrastructure is often separated from the operation, and may be owned by the governing body or by a third party. The authority may also maintain the ownership of the vehicles, such as ferries or [[rolling stock]].

Traditionally, public transport has been operated through a company wholly owned by the state with monopoly, like a national railway company. Alternatively, private companies were granted [[Privilege (social inequality)|privileges]] (with or without subsidies) granting them a monopoly. In later years many markets have been deregulated, especially in Europe, paying the lowest bidding operator to carry out the traffic at regular auctions.

===Specification===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
The authority issuing the auction may be a [[Ministry of Transport|ministry of transport]], [[county]], [[province]], [[State (administrative division)|state]], [[municipality]] or other regional or local authority, or it can be a [[transit authority]] or other ad hoc organization responsible for some state of transport in an area. To be the auctioning part the authority must have some vested interest in subsidizing the transport in addition to the authority to ban other interests from operating competing services on parts or all of the system.

The auctioneer will specify a number of terms of the service, such as [[headway|frequency]], size of vehicle, timing of service, the maximum permitted [[fare]] paid by some or all the available seats and/or other specifications related to service and quality. The auctioneer can specify either a net or gross contract. In the latter the operator bids for the full operating costs, and all revenue goes to the authority; with net contracts the operator will be granted all revenue, and will bid only for the necessary difference between fare revenue and that needed to make the desired profit. The use of gross contracts reduces the risk of the operator since they do not need to estimate the ridership and will normally give lower bids since there is a lower [[risk premium]] in each bid. This option also makes it easier to create free transfer between operators and modes.

Net contracts commonly used to give the operators an incentive to increase ridership, where there would be a high administrative costs with the authority administrating the fares, or where the auctioneer wants to reduce its own risk. Urban public transport with transit authorities is most commonly operated with gross contracts, while airlines and ferry routes are typically operated on net contracts.

Typical uses of PSO include [[regional airline]] services in districts of for instance in [[Northern Norway]] or [[Ireland]], where the airlines serve marginally populated areas not profitable for the carriers without subsidies. Rail services can be unprofitable even on major routes, and government subsidies are sometimes offered through PSO on unprofitable routes, for instance this has been very popular in [[Germany]]. Most cities subsidize their [[public transport]], and in places where the transport is provided by private companies, that may be awarded through PSO. Other common PSO services are ferries, such as the routes to [[Gotland]] in Sweden, or car ferries on the road network of Norway. Ferry routes serving [[islands of Hong Kong|outlying island]]s in [[Hong Kong]] are also subsidised since recently, as a result of rising oil price and therefore the costs of operations.

===European Union===
[[File:Veolia GTW front.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Veolia Transport|Veolia]] train in the [[Netherlands]]. Veolia has expanded rapidly based on winning many PSO contracts for bus and rail services in Europe]]
In the [[European Union]], route PSOs are governed by Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 and Council Regulation (EEC) 3577/92. They must be offered for [[call for bids|tender]] in the [[Official Journal of the European Union]] and be open to any transport operator registered in an EU member state. There are limitations in the number of passengers which can be carried where the route can remain eligible for PSO. The winning tenderer usually receives a monopoly on the route, but may have to conform to one or more conditions of service, such as the type and size of vehicle, the timing of services, the maximum fare paid for a portion or all of the seats offered, membership of a common reservation system, quality of service measured by a maximum percentage of cancelled services, etc.

Examples of air transport PSOs currently in operation in Europe are routes from [[Dublin Airport|Dublin]] to [[Kerry Airport|Kerry]] and [[Donegal Airport|Donegal]], routes between the [[Greece|Greek Mainland]] and the [[Greek Islands]], routes from [[Italy|Italian mainland]] to [[Sardinia]] and [[Elba]], routes between the [[France|French mainland]] and [[Corsica]], certain domestic routes within [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]], and routes to the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Highlands and Islands]].

International routes are usually not supported by PSO. This is because of a political principle that people should pay for international travel themselves, not through tax money. This is especially evident in Scandinavia where there is very little international air traffic between cities other than through the capitals, where connections are commercially profitable.

The term is also used about electricity generation, such as wind power and biomass powerplants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cer.ie/docs/001034/CER15142%20PSO%20Levy%202015-16%20%20Decision%20Paper.pdf Public Service Obligation Levy 2015/2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The [[Essential Air Service]] (EAS) is a [[United States Government|U.S. government]] program enacted to guarantee that small communities in the [[United States]], which, prior to deregulation, were served by certificated [[airline]]s, maintained commercial service. Its aim is to maintain a minimal level of scheduled air service to these communities that otherwise would not be profitable. This came in response to the [[Airline Deregulation Act]], passed in 1978, which gave U.S. airlines almost total freedom to determine which markets to serve domestically and what fares to charge for that service.&lt;ref name="DOT"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dot.gov/policy/aviation-policy/small-community-rural-air-service/essential-air-service | title = Essential Air Service | publisher = U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) | accessdate = 1 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is codified at {{USC|49|41731|41748}}.

[[File:Essential Air Service Locations (cropped).png|thumb|right|440px|Areas in the [[continental United States]] served by the Essential Air Service.]]
The [[United States Department of Transportation]] (DOT) subsidizes airlines to serve [[rural]] communities across the country that otherwise would not receive any scheduled air service.&lt;ref name="DOT" /&gt; As of November 1, 2013, the Essential Air Service subsidized 160 communities, of which 43 were in Alaska, whose guidelines for service are distinct from the rest of the country. The decision as to what degree of subsidized service a community requires is made based on identifying a specific [[airline hub|hub]] for the community and from there determining the number of trips, seats, and type of aircraft that are necessary to reach that hub.&lt;ref name="DOT" /&gt;

'''''Save the Plastic Bag Coalition v. City of Manhattan Beach''''' is a [[California Supreme Court]] case, decided by a full majority, in which the plaintiffs challenged the City of Manhattan Beach's ordinance banning single-use [[plastic bag]]s.&lt;ref name="Supreme Court Case S176099"&gt;{{cite web|title=Save the Plastic Bag Coalition v. City of Manhattan Beach|url=http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/mainCaseScreen.cfm?dist=0&amp;doc_id=1919128&amp;doc_no=S176099|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction and background==

On July 14, 2008, the City of [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]] adopted Ordinance No. 2115 to ban the use of single use plastic bags at "retail establishments, restaurants, vendor or non-profit vendor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Manhattan Beach|title=Ordinance No. 2115|url=http://www.citymb.info/Index.aspx?page=1591|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;"  The plastic ban ordinance is only applicable to plastic bags used to take goods away from a store, but not produce bags from grocery stores.  As stated in Section 1, A of the ordinance, "As a coastal city Manhattan Beach has a strong interest in protecting the marine
environment an element which contributes to the unique quality of life in the City."

The City of [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]] concluded the proposed ordinance would not have a significant effect on the environment and a Negative Declaration was prepared.  Subsequently, a writ of mandate was submitted to the [[Los Angeles Superior Court]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Los Angeles Superior Court, Case No. BS-116362|title=• Petition for Writ of Mandate Under CEQA|url=http://plasticbaglaws.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/lit_Manhattan-Beach_CEQA-Petition.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which was granted and upheld by the Appeals Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=California Court of Appeal, 2nd Dist., Case No. B215788|title=• Appellate Order Affirming Superior Court's Grant of Writ of Mandate|url=http://plasticbaglaws.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/lit_Manhattan-Beach_CEQA-Order-appellate-court.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A petition for review was submitted to California Supreme Court by City of Manhattan Beach and on April 21, 2010, the [[California Supreme Court]] accepted the City of Manhattan Beach's Petition.  On July 14, 2011, by unanimous decision the California Supreme Court upheld the standing of the Save the Plastic Bag Coalition, but reversed the judgment by the Court of the appeals that there was substantial evidence in the administrative record that an environmental impact report should be prepared.

==Parties==

'''The Plaintiff''' - Save The Plastic Bag Coalition (the "Coalition") is an unincorporated association. Its members are [[plastic bag]] manufacturers, plastic bag distributors, retailers, and concerned citizens. The Coalition was founded by Elkay Plastics and Command Packaging. The coalition grew quickly after the ordinance banning plastic bags was adopted by the City of Manhattan Beach and included several other companies that sell and distribute plastic bags to retail stores, restaurants and other businesses operating in the City of Manhattan Beach.&lt;ref name="Superior Court"&gt;{{cite web|title=Superior Court Case BS116362|url=http://plasticbaglaws.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/lit_Manhattan-Beach_superior-court-ruling.pdf|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Defendant'''- The City of Manhattan Beach.  The City had completed an initial environmental study regarding the environmental impact of banning single-use plastic carry bags. The premise for the ban was that plastic bags make up a significant portion of litter within the city and create a significant eyesore throughout the community.   The City of Manhattan performed the initial environmental study in June 2008 to meet the requirements of [[California Environmental Quality Act]] (CEQA).&lt;ref name="Env Study"&gt;{{cite web|title=Initial Study/Environmental Checklist For The Manhattan Beach Municipal Code Amendment To Prohibit Single-Use Plastic Carry-Out Bags At Commercial Establishments|url=http://plasticbaglaws.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/lit_Manhattan-Beach_CMB-Initial-Study.pdf|accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on that study, the City of Manhattan determined that an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was not required and a Negative Declaration was prepared and adopted by the City along with the ordinance banning plastic bags on July 15, 2008.&lt;ref name="Superior Court" /&gt;

==Industry summary==
The [[high-density polyethylene]] (HDPE) single-use bag was invented by a Swedish company in the 1960s.  The single-use plastic bag was introduced into the U.S. by [[ExxonMobil Corporation]] and had found its way to grocery stores by 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doucette|first=Kitt|title=The Plastic Bag Wars|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-plastic-bag-wars-20110725|publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, there are approximately 92 billion plastic bags used annually by retail industries such as supermarkets and pharmacies as compared to roughly 5 billion paper bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Huus|first=Kari|title=Battle of The Plastic Bags|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23596727/ns/us_news-environment/t/topmsnbccomponentsteasesusnewsbattleofthebagspaperplasticartheardjpgtoptruehttpmsnbcmediamsncomfalsepfalsefalsebattle-bags-interactivebattle-bags-interactive/|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From a global perspective, it is estimated there are anywhere from 500 billion to 1 trillion plastic bags used each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roach|first=John|title=Are Plastic Bags Sacking the Environment|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/09/0902_030902_plasticbags.html|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to concerns over litter and impacts to marine wildlife and environments, many countries have either banned or placed levies on plastic bags. Within the United States, there are 16 states that have introduced some type of legislation banning, imposing fees, or mandating plastic bag recycling.&lt;ref name="State and local laws"&gt;{{cite web|last=plasticbaglaws.org|title=State and local laws|url=http://plasticbaglaws.org/legislation/state-laws/|publisher=plasticbaglaws.org|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[San Francisco]] 2007 ordinance banning plastic bags, twelve California cities have enacted plastic bag ordinances, including [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], [[Santa Monica]], [[Fairfax, California|Fairfax]], [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]].  Similar actions have taken place at the county level in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]], [[Marin County, California|Marin]] and [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara]] counties with numerous other cities and counties following suit with proposed plastic bag ordinances pending activation.&lt;ref name="State and local laws" /&gt; In efforts to respond to pressure from retailers and environmental and special interest groups, the plastic bag industry is looking to increase the amount of recycled material in plastic bags to 40% by the year 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Granger|first=Trey|title=Plastic Bag Industry Invests $50 Million in Recycled Content Bags|url=http://earth911.com/news/2009/04/24/plastic-bag-industry-invests-50-million-in-recycled-content-bags/|publisher=Earth911.com|accessdate=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The plastic bag industry believes that by increasing the recycling of plastic bags, some 463 million pounds of greenhouse gas emissions and 300 million pounds of waste will be avoided on an annual basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Horovitz|first=Bruce|title=Makers of Plastic Bags to Use 40% Recycled Content by 2015|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/environment/2009-04-20-plastic-bags-recyclable_N.htm|publisher=USAToday.com|accessdate=4 May 2012|date=21 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research against plastic bags ===

There are numerous reports and studies regarding the negative impacts associated with single-use plastic bags.  A summary of two reports with relevance to this case are provided here.  The first is a staff report to the [[Los Angeles Board of Supervisors]] on plastic bags which identified several findings including plastic carryout bags being a significant contributor to litter and having detrimental impacts on marine wildlife and the environment.  The report also concluded that biodegradable carryout bags were not a practical solution to the issue as there are no local composting facilities available to process [[biodegradable bags]].  The final two findings of the report focused on the benefits of reusable bags over plastic as well as paper bags and that the acceleration of the widespread use of reusable bags will lessen the amount of litter from plastic bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors|title=An Overview of Carryout Bags in Los Angeles County|url=http://ladpw.org/epd/pdf/PlasticBagReport.pdf|publisher=Los Angeles County|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second report is a comprehensive compilation of information and literature regarding single-use bags found in the Master Environmental Assessment (MEA) on Single Use and Reusable Bags. The intent of the MEA is to provide a comprehensive reference available to cities and counties that can be used to help in understanding the impacts associated with actions targeted at cutting the use of single-use bags. The MEA reports several findings specific to plastic bags, including that "nearly 20 billion single-use [[high-density polyethylene]] (HDPE) plastic grocery bags are used annually in California, and most end up in landfills or as litter. In fact, of the four types of bags considered, plastic bags had the greatest impact on litter."  The MEA reports that single-use paper bags are recycled more than plastic bags, but considering lifecycles, paper bags contribute to larger greenhouse gas emission, water consumption and ozone production as compared to plastic bags.  In comparing plastic bags to biodegradable bags, the MEA found that biodegradable bags had a higher environmental impact at the manufacturing stage and that biodegradable bags may degrade only under composting conditions and will have similar effects on aesthetics and marine life when littered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ICF International|title=Master Environmental Assessment on Single-Use and Reusable Bags|url=http://plasticbaglaws.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/MEA_green-cities-CA.pdf|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research for use of plastic bags ===

Several studies cited in the lower court's records assert that the removal of plastic bags from retail stores and shops actually increase the use of paper bags, which are worse for the environment from a sustainability point of view.  The Boustead Report documents a life-cycle assessment for [[biodegradable plastic]], recycled/recyclable paper, and recyclable plastic bags.  The results of the report show that impact from recyclable plastic bags is the least of all of the bags when considering total energy, fossil fuel use, amount of solid waste, greenhouse gas emissions, and freshwater usage.&lt;ref name="The Boustead Report"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Chaffee, Chet  |author2=Yaros, Bernard R |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Life Cycle Assessment for three Types of Grocery Bags|url=http://plasticbaglaws.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/study_Boustead-Report-Prepared-for-PBA-2007.pdf|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Scottish study evaluated the potential impacts of placing a levy on light-weight plastic bags used by retail shops and other businesses. The study considered several alternatives ranging from placing a levy only on plastic bags at large retailers to placing a levy on plastic and paper bags covering all businesses.  The study concluded that environmental benefits would be realized by consumers forgoing the use of lightweight plastic bags and using reusable bags. In each scenario evaluated, consumption of non-renewable energy, atmospheric acidification, the formation of ground-level ozone and the risk of litter decreased as compared to the current use of bags. The study did suggest paper bags have a greater negative environmental impact than conventional plastic carrier bags. If plastic bags are replaced by paper bags, it is estimated that paper bag usage will increase by 174 million bags per year to 213 million per year. This will have associated environmental implications in terms of increased energy use, transport costs, storage space and waste disposal.&lt;ref name="Scottish Report"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Cadman, James |author2=Evans, S |author3=Holland, M |author4=Boyd, R |title=Proposed Plastic Bag Levy - Extended Impact|url=http://www.plasticbaglaws.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/study_Scotland_Env-Group-Report-on-Proposed-Plastic-Bag-Levy-2005.pdf|publisher=Scottish Executive|accessdate=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third study evaluated the impacts of the San Francisco Plastic Bag Reduction ordinance which was enacted in November 2007 and banned the use of plastic bags by supermarkets and drugstores. The study was conducted by visiting retail stores and observing checkout procedures and bagging preferences.  The study concluded that if the plastic bag ban was intended to reduce impacts to the environment, results of the ban at the time of the study indicated that the ban would not be successful.  The study also concluded that the state of California should ensure that recycling bins for plastic bags are present in all major stores as there is still a public desire to recycle plastic bags.&lt;ref name="ULS Report"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lilienfeld|first=Robert|title=A Qualitative Study of Grocery Bag Use in San Francisco|url=http://plasticbaglaws.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/study_ULS-Report-on-SF-Bag-Ban-2008.pdf|accessdate=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issue==

The two issues that were addressed include the following (as stated in the California Supreme Court opinion):

# The standing requirements for a corporate entity to challenge a determination on the preparation of an environmental impact report?
# Was the City of Manhattan Beach required to prepare an environmental impact report on the effects of an ordinance banning the use of plastic bags by local businesses?

==Ruling==

'''Los Angeles Superior Court, Case No. BS-116362&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Los Angeles Superior Court, Case No. BS-116362|title=• Petition for Writ of Mandate Under CEQA|url=http://plasticbaglaws.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/lit_Manhattan-Beach_CEQA-Petition.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Los Angeles Superior Court, Case No. BS-116362|title=Order Granting Petition for Writ of Mandate Under CEQA|url=	http://plasticbaglaws.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/lit_Manhattan-Beach_superior-court-ruling.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

On August 12, 2008, the Save the Plastic Bag Coalition submitted a writ of mandate to the Los Angeles Superior Court.  The petitioners claim that the City of [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]] as the lead agency should have prepared an environmental impact report to address the assumptions of using plastic bags on the environment and analyze the impacts to the environment of increased usage of paper bags. Evidence was presented suggesting that using paper bags can have significant environmental impacts.

Included in the writ of mandate was the City of Oakland decision issued in April 2008.  The City of Oakland approved a similar ordinance as City of Manhattan Beach using a "common sense" and two categorical exemptions from the California Environmental Quality Act.  The Alameda Superior Court determined the City of Oakland had not considered the environmental effects of increased paper bag usage because a Notice of Exemption had been issued.

On February 29, 2009, the petition for a writ of mandate was granted by the Los Angeles Superior Court.  The first issue the Superior Court determined was if the petitioner had standing.  The petitioner was granted standing because they are not "a for profit corporation that is seeking a commercial advantage over a specific competitor." The second issue decided was that there was enough substantial evidence in the public record to support the conclusion that an environmental import report should be prepared to evaluate the impacts of increased paper bag usage prior to a decision by the City of Manhattan Beach.

=== California Court of Appeal, 2nd Dist., Case No. B215788===

The appeal, written by Judge David P. Yaffe held the Superior Court decision. The opinion reviewed four reports (the Scottish Government Report, the Boustead Report, ULS Report, and the Franklin Report) presented as substantial evidence in the record.  The opinion concludes the Save the Plastic Bag Coalition is granted standing because they are a "beneficially interested" party; the ordinance is a "project" pursuant to review subject to the [[California Environmental Quality Act]]; and there is a fair argument for the preparation of an environmental impact report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=California Court of Appeal, 2nd Dist., Case No. B215788|title=Appellate Order Affirming Superior Court's Grant of Writ of Mandate|url=http://plasticbaglaws.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/lit_Manhattan-Beach_CEQA-Order-appellate-court.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opinion highlights the four different reports that concluded, "a plastic bag ban is likely to lead to increased use of paper as well as reusable bags; paper bags have greater negative environmental effects as compared to plastic bags; and the negative environmental effects include greater nonrenewable energy and water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, solid waste production, and acid rain." Based on a "low threshold for preparation of an environmental impact report" there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the conclusion that the plastic ban ordinance may have a significant impact on the environment, which requires the preparation of an environmental impact report to analyze the impacts.  The City of Manhattan Beach lawyers argued the geographic size supports the conclusion that increased paper bag is negligible.  However, as stated the opinion, the Initial Study prepared by the City of Manhattan Beach did not included this analysis and statutory exemptions from the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] do not apply to Cities "based on geographic or population size."

The dissenting opinion, written by Judge J. Mosk, focuses on the language in the ordinance by clarifying the focus of the ordinance is on "distribution (not use) of plastic carryout bags" and "promotes the use of reusable bags (not paper bags) and does not consider the ordinance as a project pursuant to the [[California Environmental Quality Act]]. Also, the dissenting opinion, disputes the premise the reports presented are substantial evidence because they are general conclusions about the international plastic bag industry and/or does not specifically address the environmental impacts of plastic bags in a small coastal town in California.

=== California Supreme Court ===

The opinion, written by Judge J. Corrigan concludes the Save the Plastic Bag Coalition satisfies the requirement for public interest, whereas the City argued the plaintiff does not have standing based on the Waste Management, supra, 79 Cal.App.4th 1223.  The Supreme Court rejected "the Waste Management rule holding corporations to a higher standard in qualifying for public interest standing" and concluded, "the ordinance's ban on plastic bags would have a severe and immediate effect on their business in the City."

On the issue of whether there was a fair argument that City of Manhattan Beach prepare an environmental impact report, the Court ruled that, "Substantial evidence and common sense support the city's determination that its ordinance would have no significant environmental effect. Therefore, a negative declaration was sufficient to comply with the requirements of the [[California Environmental Quality Act]]." This decision was based on the "overreliance on generic studies of life cycle impacts" and the Court concluded proper perspective must be adhered in order evaluate environmental impacts.

==Other plastic bag litigation in California==

Other litigation regarding plastic bag laws in California includes the following:

'''Save the Plastic Bag Coalition v. City of San Francisco''' – Petition for Writ of Mandate,  dated February 29, 2012.  Petitioner seeks a judgment and writ of mandate to set aside, void, annul, and repeal the San Francisco Ordinance banning plastic carryout bags at retail stores, restaurants, and other food establishments, and requiring consumers to pay a 10-cent fee for each paper carryout bag and each compostable carryout bag.  Petitioner claims that the ban violates CEQA because an EIR was not completed and that the ban is preempted by the California Retail Food Code.&lt;ref name="Plastic Bag Litigation"&gt;{{cite web|last=Plasticbaglaws.org|title=Litigation|url=http://www.plasticbaglaws.org|publisher=plasticbaglaws.org|accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Save the Plastic Bag Coalition v. City of Long Beach''' - Petition for Writ of Mandate under CEQA – The Petitioner challenged the City of Long Beach and the selection of its own greenhouse gas significance threshold rather than use the thresholds identified in the Los Angeles County Environmental Impact Report on plastic bags use.  The suit was dropped when the City of Long Beach adopted a resolution that adopting the Los Angeles county EIR without any change.&lt;ref name="Plastic Bag Litigation" /&gt;

'''Schmeer et al. v. County of Los Angeles''' - Petition for Writ of Mandate where petitioner challenged that the $0.10 charge on paper carry-out bags was a tax as defined in the California Constitution and since it was not put out for popular vote it was unconstitutional.  Writ of mandate has been denied and a notice of appeal was filed on April 16, 2012.&lt;ref name="Plastic Bag Litigation" /&gt;

'''Save the Plastic Bag Coalition v. The City of Carpinteria''' – Save the Plastic Bag Coalition filed suit against the City of Carpinteria filing of a city ordinance banning plastic bags on the grounds that the ordinance is preempted by the California Retail Food Code.  Case expected to be heard in court in May 2012.&lt;ref name="Plastic Bag Litigation" /&gt;

'''Save the Plastic Bag Coalition v. County of Marin, et al.''' – Petition for Writ of Mandate.  Petitioner filed suit to have the county repeal an ordinance regulating retail stores provision of single-use plastic bags on the grounds that the county of Marin violated CEQA by not completing an EIR.  The petition for writ of mandate was denied by the Superior Court on September 14, 2011.  As of May 2012, the case was being heard in the 1st Appellate District Court.&lt;ref name="Plastic Bag Litigation" /&gt;

'''Coalition to Support Plastic Bag Recycling v. City of Oakland, et al.''' – Petition for Writ of Mandate filed and petitioner challenged the legality of a City of Oakland ordinance banning 100% recyclable bags from large retailers on the basis that CEQA had been violated because an environmental review of the impacts of the ordinance had not been completed.  On May 16, 2008, an Alameda County Superior Court granted a writ of mandate in favor of the petitioners and ordered the City of Oakland to suspend the ordinance banning plastic bags and not re-enact the ordinance until such time that the City of Oakland had complied with the requirements of CEQA.  The City of Oakland did not appeal the decision.&lt;ref name="Plastic Bag Litigation" /&gt;

'''Save the Plastic Bag Coalition v. San Luis Obispo County Integrated Waste Management Authority''' - Petition for Writ of Mandate was filed on January 1, 2012.  Petitioner challenged the legality of an ordinance banning plastic bags and requiring retailers to charge $0.10 per paper bag on the grounds that CEQA had been violated because an environmental impact report had not been completed prior to adoption of the ordinance.  There have been no further court actions on this case as of May 2012.&lt;ref name="Plastic Bag Litigation" /&gt;

'''Save the Plastic Bag Coalition v. City of Palo Alto, et al.''' – Petition for Writ of Mandate filed on April 10, 2009.  The Petitioner sought to have a city ordinance prohibiting supermarkets from distributing single-use plastic bags at the point of sale repealed on the basis that the City violated CEQA when they failed to complete an EIR prior to adopting the ordinance.   The issues was resolved through a settlement agreement whereby, the suit was dropped and the City of Palo Alto agreed not enact or adopt any ordinance or law that prohibits, places a fee, or regulates the distribution of plastic bags unless the City completes an EIR that complies with the requirements of CEQA.  The agreement did not include any ordinance that was enacted prior to March 30, 2009.&lt;ref name="Plastic Bag Litigation" /&gt;

'''Slavery at common law''' in former colonies of the [[British Empire]] developed slowly over centuries, and was characterised by inconsistent decisions and varying rationales for the treatment of [[slavery]], the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]], and the rights of [[List of slaves|slaves]] and [[List of slave owners|slave owners]].  Unlike in its colonies, within the home islands of Britain, until 1807, except for statutes facilitating and taxing the international slave trade, there was virtually no legislative intervention in relation to slaves as property, and accordingly the [[common law]] had something of a "free hand" to develop, untrammeled by the "paralysing hand of the Parliamentary draftsmen".&lt;ref&gt;A reference from Cheshire's ''Private International Law'' (1936) as to the virtues of developing common law principles without statutory intervention; although ''quaere'' the extent to which this was a benefit in relation to slavery.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parliament was not totally silent on the subject of slavery.  Although no legislation was ever passed which either expressly legalised slavery prior to the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition]] acts, slavery was mentioned in passing in several acts of parliament, all of which tacitly assumed it to be lawful.  A list of the British statutes relating to slavery can be found [http://www.pdavis.nl/Legislation.htm here], no less than 13 of which pre-date abolition.  Further, a number of statutes were also passed in the British colonies, where the common law applied, including the [[Amelioration Act 1798]] passed in the [[Leeward Islands]] regulating the ownership of slaves.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups assert slavery was not recognised as lawful,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/huk-1833act.htm Anti-slavery society]&lt;/ref&gt; often on the basis of pronouncements such as those attributed to [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], that "the air of England is too pure for any slave to breathe."&lt;ref&gt;Academics dispute the true origin of the saying.  Some believe it dates from ''In the matter of Cartwright'', 11 Elizabeth; 2 Rushworth's Coll 468 (1569), and others believe it is a misquote of Lord Henley's comments in ''Shanley v Harvey'' (1763) 2 Eden 126 at 127&lt;/ref&gt;  However the true legal position has been both nuanced and complex through the relevant time period.  In the 17th and 18th century, some African slaves were openly held, sold, and sought within Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://qz.com/1301918/researchers-discovered-hundreds-of-ads-for-runaway-slaves-in-18th-century-britain/ |title=Researchers discovered hundreds of ads for runaway slaves in 18th-century Britain |last=Mohdin |first=Aamna |website=Quartz |language=en-US |access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ruane&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/07/03/ads-for-runaway-slaves-in-british-newspapers-show-the-cruelty-of-the-genteel/ |title=Ads for runaway slaves in British newspapers show the cruelty of the ‘genteel’ |last= Ruane  |first=Michael E. |date=July 3, 2018 |work=Washington Post |access-date=2018-09-03 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early common law==
{{Slavery}}
There was Irish decree in 1171 "that all the English slaves in the whole of Ireland, be immediately emancipated and restored to their former liberty."  The same source indicates that slavery in England was abolished by a general charter of emancipation in 1381.[http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Anti-Slavery-Examiner-Part-2-of-41.html]  Other historical sources for such an emancipation proclamation appear thin, although the date would coincide with the [[Peasants' Revolt]], after which a number of concessions were made by the 14-year-old King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], which were later rescinded.  Certainly villeinage continued in England, slowly decaying, until the last villein died in the early 17th century.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.

In later common law cases, none of the foregoing decrees or proclamations were cited or referred to as binding law in relation to the status of slaves generally.

==Cartwright's case==

In 1569, a man, Cartwright, was observed savagely beating another, which in law would have amounted to a [[battery (tort)|battery]], unless a defence could be mounted. Cartwright averred that the man was a slave whom he had brought to England from [[Russia]], and thus such chastisement was not unlawful. The case is reported by John Rushworth in his 1721 summary of John Lilburne's case of 1649. He wrote: "Whipping was painful and shameful, Flagellation for Slaves. In the Eleventh of Elizabeth [i.e., 1569], one Cartwright brought a Slave from Russia, and would scourge him, for which he was questioned; and it was resolved, That England was too pure an Air for Slaves to breath in. And indeed it was often resolved, even in Star-Chamber, That no Gentleman was to be whipt for any offence whatsoever; and his whipping was too severe."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=74904&amp;strquery=cartwright%20russia ''In the matter of Cartwright'', 11 Elizabeth; 2 Rushworth's Coll 468 (1569)]; although more commonly cited is the descriptions of the case in the arguments of counsel in the case of James Somersett&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that the court held that the man must be freed, and it is often said that the court held "that England was too pure an air for a slave to breathe in."&lt;ref&gt;Reports that the court held this all generally trace back to the argument of counsel in Somersett's case; however, the documents of the original case of 1569 have not been found. Others have suggested that it is a misquote of Lord Hardwicke's comment "As soon as a man sets foot on English ground he is free" in ''Shanley v Harvey'' (1763) 2 Eden 126 at 127. Wherever the pronouncement originated, various reports alter the grammar and phraseology of the judgment, the original words of which were most likely only ever issued orally, and thus can never be definitively ascertained.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent citations of the effect of the case was actually to impose limits on the physical punishment on slaves, rather than to express comment on legality of slavery generally.  In the case of John Lilburne in 1649, the defendant's counsel relied upon ''Cartwright's case'' to show that the severity of a whipping received by Lilburne exceeded that permitted by law.&lt;ref&gt;''The Trial of Lilburne and Wharton'', T.C. Hansard (1818-26)&lt;/ref&gt;  In none of subsequent common law cases prior to Somersett's case was Cartwright's case cited as authority for the proposition that slavery was unlawful.  However, those disputes predominantly concerned disputes between slave merchants (the notable exception being ''Shanley v Harvey'', as to which see below), for whom it would have been commercially unwise to [[pleading|plead]] that slavery was unlawful.

It is inferred that, because he was from Russia, Cartwright's slave was white, and probably a Christian, although this is not recorded.&lt;ref&gt;In his arguments in Somersett's case, [[Granville Sharp]] averred that the court held: "...and it was resolved, that England was too pure an air for a slave to breathe, and so everyone who breathes it becomes free. Everyone who comes to this island is entitled to the protection of English law, whatever oppression he may have suffered and ''whatever may be the colour of his skin.''" However it is not clear from where Sharp drew this authority, and he may have embellished the reports of the decision that he had found.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible that he was African, as, although they were uncommon, [[Abram Petrovich Gannibal|African slaves in Russia]] were not unknown prior to the emergence of the [[Atlantic slave trade]].

==African slave trade and the common law==
{{close paraphrasing|section|source=J H Baker, ''An Introduction to English Legal History'' (Oxford, 2007) Chapter 27, "Colonial Slavery and the English Courts"|date=September 2016}}
{{further|Partus sequitur ventrem}}
However, the initial opposition of the courts of England to the status of slavery began to change with the rising importance of the [[Atlantic slave trade|African slave trade]].  An extensive traffic in black slaves from Africa began in the 17th century, primarily to supply labour for the [[sugar]] and [[tobacco]] plantations in British colonies abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ism/slavery/europe/index.aspx | title=European traders | publisher=International Slavery Museum | accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1660, what became the [[Royal African Company]] was chartered by the King with a monopoly in the trade, and in 1698, an act of parliament opened the trade to all English subjects.&lt;ref&gt;P.E.H Hair &amp; Robin Law, 'The English in West Africa to 1700', in ''The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume 1, The Origins of Empire: British Overseas Enterprise to the close of the Seventeenth Century'', ed. Nicholas Canny (Oxford : Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[History of the Caribbean|Caribbean]], [[Barbados]] became an English Colony in 1624 and [[Jamaica]] in 1655.  These and other Caribbean colonies became the center of wealth and the focus of the slave trade for the growing English empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abolition.e2bn.org/slavery_45.html | title=British Involvement in the Transatlantic Slave Trade | publisher=E2BN - East of England Broadband Network and MLA East of England | work=The Abolition Project | date=2009 | accessdate=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  English merchants were prominent in the [[slave trade]], and in commercial disputes slavery soon presented the English courts with novel legal questions.  Under the ''[[law merchant|lex mercatoria]]'' slaves were treated as [[Chattel slavery|chattel]]s, with few if any rights, but the English courts did not always recognise mercantile custom as law.  The question arose in English courts because personal actions could be laid in England even if the cause of action arose abroad.  In the 18th century, owners in England would advertise their sales of African slaves and also for the return of runaway slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://qz.com/1301918/researchers-discovered-hundreds-of-ads-for-runaway-slaves-in-18th-century-britain/ |title=Researchers discovered hundreds of ads for runaway slaves in 18th-century Britain |last=Mohdin |first=Aamna |website=Quartz |language=en-US |access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===The "infidel" rationale===
Initially, the courts held that an action for [[trover]] would lie for blacks, as if they were chattels, but this was reasoned on the grounds that they were infidels rather than slaves, and lacked the rights enjoyed by Christians;&lt;ref&gt;See ''Butts v Penny'' (1677) 2 Lev 201, 3 Keb 785 - an action was brought to recover possession of 100 slaves.  The court held that slavery was legal in England in relation to infidels and that an action for trover would lie; see also ''Gelly v Cleve'' (1694) 1 Ld Raym 147&lt;/ref&gt; (reasoning which would later find echoes in the U.S. case of ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857)) but [[John Holt (judge)|Judge Holt]] was to later reject this analysis,&lt;ref&gt;''Chamberlain v Harvey'' (1697) 1 Ld Raym 146; ''Smith v Gould'' (1705-07) 2 Salk 666&lt;/ref&gt; and also denied the possibility of bringing an ''[[assumpsit]]'' on the sale of a negro in England: "as soon as a negro comes to England he is free; one may be a [[villein]] in England, but not a slave."&lt;ref&gt;''Smith v Brown'' (1702) 2 Salk 666&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this comment was construed as more of an admonition against careless [[pleading]] rather than a reproach to slave dealers.  The plaintiff was felt to have simply overdone the fictions, and was allowed to amend his declaration to allege the sale of a slave in the [[Colony of Virginia|royal colony of Virginia]], where slavery was recognised by colonial law, and the English courts would recognise and enforce the rights arising under Virginian law.  Slaves were regularly bought and sold on the [[Liverpool]] and [[London]] markets, and actions on contract concerning slaves were common in the 18th century without any serious suggestion that they were [[void (law)|void]] for illegality.&lt;ref&gt;Although arguably in a dispute between two slave merchants, the defendant would have little incentive to argue that slavery was illegal in their defense.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the statement made in the various trover decisions appear to have been directed to good pleading rather than the legality of slavery: a pleading which averred the conversion of a "negro" rather than a "slave" would fail, as there was no inherent reason why a black person should not be a free man.  In 1706 Chief Justice Holt refused an action for trover in relation to a slave holding that no man could have property in another,&lt;ref&gt;''Smith v Gould'' 2 Salk 666 (1706); Ray 1274&lt;/ref&gt; but held that an alternative action, trespass ''[[quare captivum suum cepit]]'', would be available, which was actually felt to have strengthened the legal position of slaveowners.

Ultimately the comments made in Holt's decisions had little long-term effect.  In 1700 there was no extensive use of slave labour in England as there was in the colonies.  African servants were common as status symbols, but their treatment was not comparable to that of plantation slaves in the colonies.  The legal problems that were most likely to arise in England were if a slave were to escape in transit, or if a slave-owner from the colonies brought over a slave and expected to continue exercising his power to prevent the slave from leaving his service.  Increasing numbers of slaves were indeed brought into England in the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;In 1772 it was estimated that there was as many as 14,000 slaves in Britain, see ''An Introduction to English Legal History'', J.H.Baker (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and this may help to explain the growing awareness of the problems presented by the existence of slavery.  Quite apart from the moral considerations, there was an obvious conflict between the mercantile custom of recognizing property in slaves and the English tradition of freedom protected by ''[[habeas corpus]]''.  If the courts acknowledged the property which was generally assumed to exist in slaves in the colonies, how would such property rights be treated if a slave was subsequently brought to England?

===The Yorke–Talbot slavery opinion===
{{main|Yorke–Talbot slavery opinion}}
However, the decisions of Holt had caused sufficient consternation as to the legal status of slaves that some slave owners sought clarity of the law.  In 1729 various slave owners obtained the [[Yorke–Talbot slavery opinion]] made by the Crown's principal law officers at one of the [[Inns of Court]].&lt;ref&gt;The opinion was written by [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke|Philip Yorke]] and [[Charles Talbot, 1st Baron Talbot of Hensol|Charles Talbot]], each of whom would later rise to the rank of [[Lord Chancellor]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The law officers opined that under English law (i) a slave's status did not change when he came to England,&lt;ref&gt;There was a popular perception in the day that a slave which set foot in England was free.  As early as 1577 William Harrison in his ''Description of England'' asserted that when slaves came to England "all note of servile bondage is utterly removed from them".  More importantly, in the first edition of his hugely influential work, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', [[William Blackstone]] asserted that slaves were free when they came to England, ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Bl. Comm.]]'', 1:123, although he changed his view in subsequent editions.&lt;/ref&gt;  (ii) a slave could be compelled to return to the colonies from England, and (iii) that baptism would not manumit a slave.  The opinion cited no authorities, and set out no legal rationale for the views expressed in it, but it was widely published and relied upon.  One of the authors of the opinion, [[Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke|Lord Hardwicke]] (although at the time he was only known as Philip Yorke), subsequently endorsed the views expressed in the opinion (although not expressly referring to it) whilst sitting in judicial capacity in ''Pearne v Lisle'' (1749) Amb 75, 27 ER 47.  The case revolved around title to fourteen slaves who were in [[Antigua]], and involved a number of technical points as to colonial law.  But Lord Hardwicke held that slavery was not contrary to English law, and that as the common law of England applied at the time to Antigua, that slavery was not unlawful in Antigua.&lt;ref&gt;It was this determination that the common law of England applied in the colonies that was part of the angst which Lord Mansfield underwent in relation to the Somersett decision; he knew that if he held slavery to be unlawful in England, it would ''de facto'' mean it was unlawful throughout the colonies and would cause economic ruin.  This may be why he sought to limit his ruling territorially.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time the cases in which the English courts had recognised property in slaves had arisen from purely commercial disputes and did not establish any rights exercisable as against the slaves themselves, if the slave was within the jurisdiction.  As with villeins centuries before, the analogy with chattels (as between putative owners) failed to answer the [[leading question]] whether slaves could establish their freedom by bringing suit in the courts (as between slave and owner).  The writ ''de homine replegiando'' was outmoded, and so the usual eighteenth-century question was whether ''habeas corpus'' lay to free slaves from captivity.  [[William Blackstone|Sir William Blackstone]] was in no doubt that "the spirit of liberty is so deeply ingrained in our constitution" that a slave, the moment he lands in England, is free.&lt;ref&gt;[[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Bl. Comm.]], vol I, p 123; although he resiled from this position later, some argue under political pressure&lt;/ref&gt;  Other prominent lawyers, such as Lord Hardwicke and [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], felt that it was better to recognise slavery, and to impose regulation on the slave trade rather than to withdraw from it, since less enlightened nations would reap the benefits of abolition and slaves would suffer the consequences.  The "infidel" argument for maintaining African slaves as chattels was abandoned in the middle of the 18th century, since by then many slaves had been converted to [[Christianity]] without gaining ''de facto'' freedom;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} and legal justifications for slave ownership were now sought by analogy with the old law of villeinage.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==''Shanley v Harvey''==

In ''Shanley v Harvey'' (1763) 2 Eden 126, a claim was instituted by Shanley as [[administrator (law)|administrator]] of the estate of his deceased niece.

Shanley had brought Harvey as a child slave, to England, 12 years earlier and had given him to his niece.  She had him [[baptism|baptised]] and had changed his name.  She became very ill and about an hour before her death, she gave Harvey about £800 in cash (a substantial sum in those days), asked him to pay the butcher's bill&lt;ref&gt;The case report is not clear whether this was literally a [[butcher]]'s bill, or whether this was the popular eighteenth century slang for the physician's fees.&lt;/ref&gt; and to make good use of the money.  After her death, Shanley brought an action against Harvey to recover the money.

[[Robert Henley, 1st Earl of Northington|Lord Henley]], the Lord Chancellor, dismissed the action, with costs against Shanley.  In his judgment he held that as soon as a person set foot on English soil, he or she became free and that a "negro" might maintain an action against his or her master for ill usage, together with an application for ''[[habeas corpus]]'' if detained.  However, such comments were not necessary for the decision in the case, and in law were only ''[[obiter dictum]]'' and not binding on subsequent courts.

==''R v Stapylton''==
One of the few non-commercial disputes relating to slavery arose in ''R v Stapylton'' (1771, unreported) in which Lord Mansfield sat. Stapylton was charged after attempting to forcibly deport his purported slave, Thomas Lewis. Stapylton's defence rested on the basis that as Lewis was his slave, his actions were lawful.

Lord Mansfield had the opportunity to use a legal procedure at the time in criminal cases referred to as the Twelve Judges to determine points of law (which were not for the [[jury]]) in criminal matters. However, he shied away from doing so, and sought (unsuccessfully) to dissuade the parties from using the legality of slavery as the basis of the defence.

In the end Mansfield directed the jury that they should presume Lewis was a free man, unless Stapylton was able to prove otherwise. He further directed the jury that unless they found that Stapylton was the legal owner of Lewis "you will find the Defendant guilty". Lewis was permitted to testify. The jury convicted. However, in the course of his summing up, Lord Mansfield was careful to say "whether they [slave owners] have this kind of property or not in England has never been solemnly determined."&lt;ref&gt;Somewhat injudiciously, as he had just prevented such a solemn determination from taking place during the course of the trial.&lt;/ref&gt;

==James Somersett's case==
{{main|Somerset v Stewart}}
The question of a slave's rights as against his putative master (as opposed to merchant's rights as against each other) eventually came before Lord Mansfield and the King's Bench in 1771.  A writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' had been issued to secure the release of James Somersett, a negro confined in irons on board a ship arrived in the [[River Thames|Thames]] from Virginia, bound for Jamaica, and the return stated that he was a slave under the law of Virginia.  Lord Mansfield was anxious to avoid the issue principle, and pressed the parties to settle; but the case was taken up by the West India merchants, who wanted to know whether slaves were a safe investment, and by abolitionists such as [[Granville Sharp]], so that it became a ''cause célèbre''.  The law of villeinage was turned by Somersett's counsel into an argument against slavery, since the kind of proof that was required to establish villein status was not available in claiming slaves.  After arguments closed it still took Lord Mansfield 3 agonising months before he delivered his judgment, which in the end, was short and delivered orally only.  In the event the court ordered in 1772 that "the black must be discharged".  But Lord Mansfield, while stating that slavery was "odious", did not decide that slavery was unlawful, nor even that Somersett was no longer a slave, confining himself to the narrow point that a slave could not be made to leave England against his will.  The decision also left aside the problem in the [[conflict of laws]]; if a person was a slave by law of his [[Domicile (law)|domicile]], which was not disputed in the case of Somersett, a mere temporary presence in England would not set him free permanently, even for the purpose of English law.&lt;ref&gt;English law is fond of such fudges; in land law, after 12 years a trespasser may obtain "[[squatter's rights]]" and cannot then be evicted by the true landowner, but the trespasser cannot himself be registered as the landowner until a subsequent period passes and he acquires it by prescription.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several contract cases concerning overseas slaves in fact came before Lord Mansfield, and counsel did not even think it worth arguing that the contracts were illegal or contrary to public policy.

==''R v Inhabitants of Thames Ditton''==

Lord Mansfield subsequently commented upon his decision in the ''Somersett'' case in ''R v Inhabitants of Thames Ditton'' (1785)&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hSdFAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA301&amp;lpg=PA301&amp;dq=1785+%22Lord+Mansfield%22+%22Thames+Ditton%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aKrYY0iW3Z&amp;sig=PdIkoOQAQKxSFXPoX2U5pdciSpU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBWoVChMI8-aw7p6ByAIVTCweCh1trgJh#v=onepage&amp;q=1785%20%22Lord%20Mansfield%22%20%22Thames%20Ditton%22&amp;f=false R v Inhabitants of Thames Ditton]'' (1785) 99 ER 891.&lt;/ref&gt;  The official report notes that Mansfield expressed the view during counsel's argument that his ruling in the Somerset case decided only that a slave could not be forcibly removed from England against his will: "The determinations go no further than that the master cannot be force compel him to go out of the kingdom."  In ''Thames Ditton'' a black woman by the name of Charlotte Howe had been brought to England as a slave by one Captain Howe.  After Captain Howe died Charlotte sought poor relief from the Parish of [[Thames Ditton]].  Mansfield stated that the ''Somersett'' case had only determined that a master could not force a slave to leave England, much as in earlier times a master could not forcibly remove his villein.  He ruled that Charlotte was not entitled to relief under [[English Poor Laws|Poor Laws]] because relief was dependent on having  been "hired", and this did not relate to slaves.

==Joseph Knight's case==
{{See also|Joseph Knight (slave)}}
In 1777 after the Mansfield decision in England, a servant in [[Scotland]], [[Joseph Knight (slave)|Joseph Knight]], sought the freedom to leave the employment of [[John Wedderburn of Ballendean]], and claimed in his pleadings that the very act of landing in Scotland freed him from perpetual servitude, as slavery was not recognised in Scotland (records do not now record whether this was on the basis of the Mansfield decision).  Many years earlier Knight had been purchased by Wedderburn in Jamaica from a slave trader, although his status at the time of the trial was the subject of disagreement (Knight averred that Wedderburn wished to take him back to Jamaica to sell him on as a slave in the colonies, which Wedderburn denied).

The case caused disagreement in the courts as Wedderburn, referred to through the document as "The Complainer", insisted that slavery and perpetual servitude were different states.  He argued that in Scots law Knight, even though he was not recognised as a slave, was still bound to provide perpetual service in the same manner as an [[indentured servant]] or an [[apprenticeship|apprenticed artisan]].  The Justices of the Peace in Perth, at first instance, found in favour of Wedderburn. However, when Knight then appealed to the Sheriff Deputy the first instance decision was then overturned.  Wedderburn then made a further appeal to the [[Court of Session|Lords of Council and Session]].  The Court of Session emphatically rejected Wedderburn's appeal, ruling that "the dominion assumed over this Negro, under the law of Jamaica, being unjust, could not be supported in this country to any extent: That, therefore, the defender had no right to the Negro’s service for any space of time, nor to send him out of the country against his consent: That the Negro was likewise protected under [[Criminal Procedure Act 1701#Scotland|the act 1701, c.6]]. from being sent out of the country against his consent."

Evidence presented by both sides in the case survives in the National Archives of Scotland (reference CS235/K/2/2).[http://www.nas.gov.uk/about/071022.asp]

==''Zong'' massacre==
[[File:Slave-ship.jpg|thumb|350px|alt=A painting entitled "The Slave Ship" by J. M. W. Turner. In the background, the sun shines through a storm while large waves hit the sides of a sailing ship. In the foreground, slaves are drowning in the water, while others are being eaten by large fish|''[[The Slave Ship]]'', [[J. M. W. Turner]]'s representation of the mass murder of slaves, inspired by the ''Zong'' killings&lt;ref&gt;Burroughs 2010, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Zong massacre}}
In late November or early December 1781 the captain and crew of the English [[slave ship]], ''Zong'', threw various African slaves into the sea off the island of [[Hispaniola]], ostensibly to save the lives of the remaining slaves as provisions were short.  The shipowners then sought to claim under policies of insurance, arguing that jettisoning the cargo constituted a recoverable loss, even though it necessarily resulted in the murder of the slaves.  In the first round of legal proceedings a jury initially held for the shipowners and upheld the claim.  On a subsequent application to set that judgment aside, Lord Mansfield indicated that the jury in the initial trial "had no doubt (though it shocks one very much) that the Case of Slaves was the same as if Horses had been thrown over board ... ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walvin |first=James |title=The Zong: A Massacre, the Law and the End of Slavery |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven &amp; London |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-300-12555-9|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That finding was overturned and fresh trial ordered, but in both legal actions it was accepted in principle by the court that the killing of the negro slaves was permissible, and did not thereby invalidate the insurance by virtue of being an unlawful act.&lt;ref&gt;A report of one of the appeals is available: ''Gregson v Gilbert'' (1783) 3 Doug KB 232&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly afterwards provisions in the [[Slave Trade Act 1788]] made it unlawful to insure against similar losses of slaves.

==''R v Hodge''==
{{Main|Arthur William Hodge}}

In 1811, Arthur Hodge became the first (and only) [[British subject]] ever to stand trial for the [[murder]] of a slave.  As part of his defence, Hodge argued that "A Negro being property, it was no greater offense for his master to kill him than it would be to kill his dog," but the court did not accept the submission, and point was dismissed summarily.[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llst&amp;fileName=064/llst064.db&amp;recNum=183&amp;itemLink=r%3Fammem%2Fllst%3A%40field%28DOCID%2B%40lit%28llst064div1%29%29%3A%230640004&amp;linkText=1]&lt;ref&gt;Counsel for the prosecution averred that killing a slave had always been contrary to the common law, but cited no authority for this proposition.[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llst&amp;fileName=064/llst064.db&amp;recNum=172&amp;itemLink=r%3Fammem%2Fllst%3A%40field%28DOCID%2B%40lit%28llst064div1%29%29%3A%230640004&amp;linkText=1]&lt;/ref&gt;  Counsel for the prosecution also obliquely referred to the [[Amelioration Act 1798]] passed by the Legislature of the [[British Leeward Islands|Leeward Islands]], which applied in the [[British Virgin Islands]].  That Act provided for penalties for slave owners who inflicted cruel or unusual punishments on their slaves, but it only provides for fines, and does not expressly indicate that a slave owner could be guilty of a greater crime such as murder or another [[offence against the person]].

The trial took place under English common law in [[British Virgin Islands]]. However, there was no appeal (Hodge was executed a mere eight days after the [[jury]] handed down their verdict). The jury (composed largely of slave owners) actually recommended mercy, but the court nonetheless sentenced Hodge to death, and so the directions of the trial judge are not treated by commentators as an authoritative [[precedent]].

==''Forbes v Cochrane''==

The closest thing to an explicit judicial statement in England that "positive law" would be required to make slavery lawful appears in the judgment of [[William Best, 1st Baron Wynford|Mr. Justice Best]] in ''[[Forbes v Cochrane]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Forbes v Cochrane'' (1824) 3 Dow &amp; Ry KB 679 at 742, 2 B &amp; C 448 at 463, 107 ER 450 at 456, 2 State Trials NS 147&lt;/ref&gt; in 1824. He said, "There is no statute recognising slavery which operates in that part of the British empire in which we are now called upon to administer justice."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9bANAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA325&amp;lpg=PA325&amp;dq=Forbes+v+Cochrane+%281824%29+Great+Britain&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TpQHSfmlqF&amp;sig=Kn5ymylhVsQjcdElFQqmdvyCWog&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BiGTU9mfIYKyyATcgYH4DQ&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Forbes%20v%20Cochrane%20%281824%29%20Great%20Britain&amp;f=false ''The Debates in Parliament, Session 1833 - on the Resolutions and Bill for the Abolition of Slavery in the British Colonies: With a Copy of the Act of Parliament'' (Google eBook), Great Britain Parliament, 1834, p. 325]&lt;/ref&gt; He described the ''Somerset'' case as entitling a slave in England to discharge (from that status), and rendering any person attempting to force him back into slavery as guilty of trespass.&lt;ref&gt;(1824) 2 Barnewall and Cresswell, p. 448.&lt;/ref&gt;  But not all reports of the case agree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/huk-slavery.htm |title=Slavery in England |publisher=Anti-Slavery Society |author= |date= |accessdate=18 September 2015 |quote= In 1824 in Forbes v Cochrane (1824) 3 Dow &amp; Ry KB 679 at 742, 2 B &amp; C 448 at 463, 107 ER 450 at 456, 2 State Trials NS 147, Holroyd J held that where a person gets out of the territory where it [sc slavery] prevails and out of the power of his master and gets under the protection of another power, without any wrongful act done by the party giving that protection, the right of the master, which is founded on the municipal law of the particular place only, does not continue.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent legislation==

The common law, ultimately, would go no further.  But the decision of 1772 in James Somersett's case was widely misunderstood as freeing slaves in England, and whilst not legally accurate, this perception was fuelled by the growing abolitionist movement, notwithstanding this was scarcely an accurate reflection of the decision.  Slavery did not, like villeinage, die naturally from adverse public opinion, because vested mercantile interests were too valuable.  In 1788 the [[Slave Trade Act 1788]] was passed, partly in response to the [[Zong Massacre|''Zong'' Massacre]] to ameliorate the conditions under which slaves might be transported (the Act would be renewed several times before being made permanent in 1799).  In 1792 the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] voted in favour of "gradual" abolition, and in 1807 parliament outlawed the African slave trade by legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Slave Trade Act|Slave Trade Act 1807]], Stat 47 Geo III, chap 36.  The offences created by the Act were made felony in 1811, to discourage contraband traffic.   Slaves exported contrary to the Act were forfeited to the King, for the purpose only of divesting property.&lt;/ref&gt;  This prevented British merchants exporting any more people from Africa, but it did not alter the status of the several million existing slaves, and the courts continued to recognise colonial slavery.  The abolitionists therefore turned their attention to the emancipation of West Indian slaves.  Legally, this was difficult to achieve, since it required the compulsory divesting of private property; but it was finally done in 1833,&lt;ref&gt;[[Slavery Abolition Act|Slavery Abolition Act 1833]], Stat 3 &amp; 4 Will IV, chap 73.&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of £20 million paid from public funds in compensation to slave owners.  With no sense of irony, whilst slave owners were compensated for their loss, the freed slaves themselves received no compensation for their forced labour.&lt;ref&gt;Note; slaves were usually fed, clothed, and housed at their 'owners' expense, thus while enslaved had been, in financial terms, better off than many [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]]s .&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1 August 1834, all slaves in the British colonies were "absolutely and forever manumitted."&lt;ref&gt;Transitional provisions, turning the freed slaves into bound "apprentices", ended in 1838.&lt;/ref&gt;

In British colonies, it was widely assumed that positive law was needed to make slavery lawful, and various [[Royal Colony|royal colonies]] passed laws to this effect.&lt;ref&gt;In 1641 Massachusetts was the first colony to legalise slavery; this was followed by Connecticut (1650), Virginia (1661), Maryland (1663) and New York and New Jersey (1664) - see generally [[History of slavery#Slavery in North America|History of slavery - Slavery in North America]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''State Central Library Hyderabad''', {{lang|te|స్టేట్ సెంట్రల్ లైబ్రరీ}}({{lang-ur|مكتبہ آصفیہ}}) known as the '''State Central Library''' (SCL) earlier known as '''Asafia Library''', is a [[public library]] in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Telangana]]. The building was constructed in 1891 with the help of chief engineer of [[Nizam]] - Nawab Khan Bahadur Mirza Akbar Baig. It is one of the most imposing structures in the city and was granted heritage status in 1998 by [[INTACH]], Hyderabad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2009/07/05/stories/2009070559780300.htm State Central Library calls for uplift in ''The Hindu''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The library is located at [[Afzal Gunj]] on the bank of the [[Musi River (India)|River Musi]]. It houses 500,000 books and magazines including some rare [[Palm-leaf manuscript]]s. This library is the apex of the state's library system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ifla.queenslibrary.org/VII/s8/annual/cr02-in.htm "Public Library Services in India: Systems and Deficiencies"], R. Bhattacharjee, [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]], 19 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The State Central Library began in 1891 due to the efforts of Moulvi [[Syed Hussain Bilgrami]] (Nawab Imadul Mulk Bahadur), whose personal library formed the institution's initial core.
[[File:Central library renewate.JPG|thumb|230px|right|State Central Library Hyderabad]]
The library building has an area of 72,247 square yards and was built under the supervision of architect, [[Aziz Ali (architect)|Aziz Ali]]. The foundation stone was laid in January 1932 by Prince [[Mir Osman Ali Khan]]. At the construction's completion, the Asafia Library shifted to the new building in 1936 to mark [[Nizam VII]]'s silver jubilee. The architecture is reminiscent of a palace with its huge halls and high ceilings.

In 1941, the Asafia State Library celebrated its Golden Jubilee. When the Hyderabad Public Libraries Act became law in 1955, Asafia State Library was declared as the State Central library for the Hyderabad State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urducouncil.nic.in/urdu_wrld/o_kha/ANDHRA%20PRADESH.htm "State Government - Oriental Manuscripts Library and Research Institute (OMLRI) - Osmania University Campus, Hyderabad 500 007"], ''accessed 17 December 2009''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
# The main objective is to collect literature on Science, Technology and similar subjects.
# It should be Telangana's main source of reference materials for researchers and scholars.
# It should serve as a focal point and organizing agency for the interlibrary loan of books.
# The library, in accordance with its objectives, maintains a strong reference collection including State and Central Government Publications.
# The library organizes book exhibitions, professional seminars, conferences, and nationwide week celebrations.
# A main objective is to create awareness and to establish the habit of reading in its students. This is emphasized and highlighted during National Library Week.
# The library provides literature for research scholars, children of various ages, students, and readers of all standards (including blind readers).

==Collection==
The Library has an excellent collection of around five hundred thousand books published since the early 19th century, including books in English, Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Marathi, Sanskrit, Urdu, Arabic and Persian. Nearly 17,000 manuscripts dating to the fifth and sixth centuries were transferred to the [[Telangana Oriental Manuscripts Library]] in 1967.

[[Hyderabad Samachara]] monthly newspaper published by HEH in 1941.

==Digitalization==
The first phase of computerisation and networking in libraries through e-Grandhalaya software developed by [[National Informatics Centre]] has begun. The project will begin on an experimental basis in Warangal and Hyderabad. Over 40,000 books have already been digitised at SCL with the help of Carnegie Mellon University's Universal Online Library Projects. The digitised works include titles in Hindi, English, Telugu, Urdu and Persian. [[Carnegie Mellon University]] provides the funding for this project.

'''''The Law That Never Was: The Fraud of the 16th Amendment and Personal Income Tax''''' is a 1985 book by William J. Benson and Martin J. "Red" Beckman which claims that the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], commonly known as the [[Income tax in the United States|income tax]] amendment, was never properly [[Ratification|ratified]]. In 2007, and again in 2009, Benson's contentions [[#Benson's non-ratification argument ruled fraudulent|were ruled to be fraudulent]].

== Background ==

Under [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]] of the [[United States|U.S. Constitution]], an amendment proposed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] must be ratified by three-fourths of the [[U.S. state|state]]s to become part of the Constitution. The Article permits Congress to specify, for each amendment, whether the ratification must be by each state's [[State legislature (United States)|legislature]] or by a [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] in each state; for the Sixteenth Amendment, Congress specified ratification by the legislatures. There were 48 states in the Union in 1913 — the year when the Sixteenth Amendment was finally ratified — which meant that the Amendment required ratification by the legislatures of 36 states to become effective. In February 1913, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Philander C. Knox]] issued a proclamation that 38 states had ratified the amendment. (According to Congressional analysis, a total of 42 states had ratified the amendment as of 1992.)&lt;ref&gt;Senate Document No. 103-6 (1992 ed.), Analysis and Interpretation of the Constitution; Annotations of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States (United States Government Printing Office). {{cite web |url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/html/conamt.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205125036/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/html/conamt.html |archivedate=2008-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contentions ==

Prior to Benson, the "non-ratification" argument was presented in a court of law by James Walter Scott in the 1975 case of ''United States v. Scott'', some sixty-two years after the ratification. Scott's argument was to no avail; he was convicted of willful failure to file federal income tax returns for the years 1969 through 1972, and the conviction was upheld by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Scott'', 521 F.2d 1188 (9th Cir. 1975).&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1977 case involving a tax protester named Bob Tammen, a U.S. District Court noted that Tammen was involved with a group called "United Tax Action Patriots," which took the position "that the Sixteenth Amendment was improperly passed and therefore invalid...." However, the specific issue of the validity of the ratification was neither presented to nor decided by the court.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Ex parte Tammen'', 438 F. Supp. 349, 78-1 U.S. Tax Cas. ([[CCH (company)|CCH]]) ¶ 9302 (N.D. Tex. 1977), at [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=%22438+F.+Supp.+349%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=3,44&amp;case=7762166821465252170&amp;scilh=0].&lt;/ref&gt;

William Benson's book relates how, in 1984, nine years after the Scott case and seventy-one years after the ratification was proclaimed, Benson began a research project to investigate the ratification process by traveling to the [[National Archives]] and the [[List of state capitols in the United States|capitol]]s of various [[New England]] states to review documents relating to the ratification of the Amendment.

Benson found variations in wording, punctuation, capitalization, and pluralization in the language of the Amendment as ratified by many states. He used the changes as part of the basis for his contention that those states had not properly ratified the Amendment. Benson further claimed to have found documents suggesting that some states that had been certified as having ratified the Amendment never voted to ratify it, or voted against ratification. Benson claimed that no states, or only a few states (variously reported as two states or four states), had properly ratified the Amendment.

In his book, Benson made the following claims:

*Seven states (Connecticut, Florida, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Utah,  Virginia) did not ratify the amendment, and it was reported as such.
*Two states (Kentucky and Tennessee) did not ratify the amendment, but Secretary Knox reported that they did.
*Eight states (Delaware, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont and Wyoming) were reported by Secretary Knox as having ratified the amendment, but the States actually have missing or incomplete records of the ratification procedures or votes, and there is no conclusive record that they ratified the amendment or reported any ratification to the Secretary of State.
*Six states (Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Washington) did approve the amendment, but the Governor or another official who was required by their respective state constitutions to sign the legislation into law did not sign the legislation.
*In twenty-five states (Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia and Wyoming), the legislature violated a provision of its state constitution during the ratification process.
*Twenty-nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, West Virginia and Wyoming) violated "state law" or procedural rules during the ratification process.

Additionally, Benson asserted that:

*Twenty-two states approved the amendment, but with changes in wording, and the inexact version was accepted as a ratification of the original version.
*One state approved the amendment, but with variations in spelling, and the inexact version was accepted as a ratification of the original version.
*At least twenty-six states approved the amendment, but with changes in punctuation, and the inexact version was accepted as a ratification of the original version.

Benson asserted that the Oklahoma State Legislature changed the wording of the amendment they approved so that it meant the opposite of the original amendment as it was submitted to the States by Congress, but that Secretary Knox counted Oklahoma as having approved the amendment.

Benson also asserted, as an example of a state's violation of its own Constitution, laws, or procedural rules, the claim that the Tennessee State Constitution prohibited the legislature from acting on any proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution submitted by Congress until after the next state legislative elections. According to Benson, the Tennessee legislature acted on the proposed 16th amendment the same month it was received (prior to any new state legislative elections).

== Legal status of Benson's claims ==

The Benson book was published in 1985. The earliest reported court cases where the book was mentioned appear to be ''United States v. House''&lt;ref&gt;617 F. Supp. 237, 87-2 U.S. Tax Cas. ([[CCH (company)|CCH]]) ¶ 9562 (W.D. Mich. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''United States v. Wojtas''.&lt;ref&gt;611 F. Supp. 118 (N.D. Ill. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Benson testified unsuccessfully in the ''House'' case. In the latter case, defendant Wayne Wojtas was unsuccessful in his attempt to use Benson's theory to have his indictment for failure to file federal tax returns dismissed. In the case the judge ruled that Benson's evidence was inadmissible, stating that:

{{quote|[T]he few cases that have been asked to deal with issues comparable to the one now tendered to this Court have uniformly held questions as to compliance with Article V's requirements are within the sole province of Congress and not the courts—in the language that has come to characterize such issues, they are "political" (that is, nonjusticiable).}}

Wojtas was convicted, sentenced to prison, and released in August 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Francis Wojtas, inmate # 93604-024, Federal Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Dep't of Justice, at [http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;FirstName=Wayne&amp;Middle=&amp;LastName=Wojtas&amp;Race=U&amp;Sex=U&amp;Age=&amp;x=113&amp;y=33].&lt;/ref&gt;

Benson's claim was also rejected in ''Miller v. United States''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Case citation|868 F.2d 236]] 89-1 U.S. Tax Cas. ([[CCH (company)|CCH]]) ¶ 9184 ([[7th Cir.]] 1989) (per curiam).&lt;/ref&gt; The court stated, "We find it hard to understand why the long and unbroken line of cases upholding the constitutionality of the Sixteenth Amendment generally, ''Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Company''&amp;nbsp;... and those specifically rejecting the argument advanced in ''The Law That Never Was'', have not persuaded Miller and his compatriots to seek a more effective forum for airing their attack on the federal income tax structure." The court then sanctioned the litigants for advancing a "patently [[Frivolous litigation|frivolous]]" position.

Similar "Sixteenth Amendment arguments" have been uniformly rejected by the courts in other cases including ''United States v. Thomas''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Case citation|788 F.2d 1250, 1252]] ([[7th Cir.]] 1986), ''cert. denied'', 479 U.S. 853, 107 S. Ct. 187 (1986), at [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=%22788+F.2d+1250%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=3,44&amp;case=15005018928858012497&amp;scilh=0]. See also ''United States v. Thomas'', 934 F.2d 840 (7th Cir. 1991), at [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=%22934+F.2d+840%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=3,44&amp;case=647759442258492063&amp;scilh=0].&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Thomas'' the court, in affirming the tax convictions of Kenneth L. Thomas, referred to Benson's book and noted that the errors found by Benson had already been investigated by Secretary of State Knox at the time of ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment, and had been determined to be insignificant. (See [[Tax protester constitutional arguments]].)

Arguments that the Sixteenth Amendment was not properly ratified were also rejected in ''Sisk v. Commissioner'';&lt;ref&gt;791 F.2d 58, 86-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9433 (6th Cir. 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; ''United States v. Sitka'';&lt;ref&gt;845 F.2d 43, 88-1 U.S. Tax Cas. ([[CCH (company)|CCH]]) ¶ 9308 (2d Cir.), ''cert. denied'', 488 U.S. 827 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''United States v. Stahl''.&lt;ref&gt;792 F.2d 1438, 86-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9518 (9th Cir. 1986), ''cert. denied'', 107 S. Ct. 888 (1987). See generally ''United States v. Hempfling'', 431 F. Supp. 2d 1069 (E.D. Calif. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The non-ratification argument has also been deemed legally frivolous in ''Brown v. Commissioner''&lt;ref&gt;53 T.C.M. (CCH) 94, T.C. Memo 1987-78, CCH Dec. 43,696(M) (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Lysiak v. Commissioner''.&lt;ref&gt;816 F.2d 311, 87-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9296 (7th Cir. 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that the Sixteenth Amendment was not ratified, and variations of this argument, have been officially identified as legally frivolous federal income tax return positions for purposes of the $5,000 frivolous tax return penalty imposed under Internal Revenue Code section 6702(a).&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|6702}}, as amended by section 407 of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-432, 120 Stat. 2922 (Dec. 20, 2006). See Notice 2008-14, item 9j, I.R.B. 2008-4 (Jan. 14, 2008), Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Department of the Treasury (superseding Notice 2007-30).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benson's federal income tax problems ==

In ''United States v. Benson'',&lt;ref&gt;941 F.2d 598, 91-2 U.S. Tax Cas. ([[CCH (company)|CCH]]) ¶ 50,437 (7th Cir. 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; a criminal case, Benson himself raised the Sixteenth Amendment argument, which was rejected by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. In this phase of the case, his conviction for tax evasion and willful failure to file tax returns was overturned on other grounds and the case was remanded to the trial court.

Upon retrial, Benson was again convicted of tax evasion and willful failure to file tax returns, and his conviction was upheld on appeal. The conduct for which he was convicted involved over $100,000 of income he did not report on Federal income tax returns. He was sentenced to four years in prison and five years of probation.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Benson'', 67 F.3d 641, 95-2 U.S. Tax Cas. ([[CCH (company)|CCH]]) ¶ 50,540 (7th Cir. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Benson continued to promote his views. Until early 2008, Benson included verbiage on his web site{{spaced ndash}}in quotation marks{{spaced ndash}}that he attributed to the text of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in ''[[Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad]]'', an early case interpreting the Amendment. He quoted the Court as saying that the Sixteenth Amendment "did not change the constitutional limitations which forbid any direct taxation of individuals."&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved on 22 November 2006 from http://www.thelawthatneverwas.com/new/ratification.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The text of the Court's decision does not contain any such quotation.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad'', 240 U.S. 1 (1916); text available at http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=240&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt; No U.S. Federal court has ever ruled that any provision of the United States Constitution forbids any direct taxation of individuals. Benson apparently removed the material after [[#Benson's non-ratification argument ruled fraudulent|a court order was issued regarding his materials]].

Until January 2008, Benson's web site also stated: "After serving time in federal prison for not paying his United States income taxes, Bill Benson still does not pay income taxes and yet our federal government chooses not to arrest him. Why? Because ''now he can use this book'', which he has written : 'THE LAW THAT NEVER WAS' in his defense."&lt;ref&gt;The statement was found at the caption near Benson's picture at bottom of web page. Retrieved on 22 November 2006 from [http://www.thelawthatneverwas.com/new/home.asp]. As of January 30, 2008, after the issuance of a permanent injunction against Benson (see below), this language apparently was removed.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, as late as the year 2007, Benson claimed, in marketing the "Reliance Defense Package" that included his non-ratification argument, that "[t]o date, the IRS has steadfastly refused to prosecute any person standing on this defense. Why do they do this? Because they know they cannot win!!"&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in the court decision on April 6, 2009, at entry 58, p. 8 ''United States v. Benson'', case no. 08-1312 and case no. 08-1586, United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was actually published several years before Benson's arrest and, as noted above, Benson himself actually was convicted despite using the defense.

In one of Benson's cases, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Benson argues that he did not need to file tax returns or pay income taxes because the Sixteenth Amendment was not properly ratified. [....] The district court denied Benson's request for an evidentiary hearing on this issue and refused to hear any Sixteenth Amendment argument.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

As the district court noted, we have repeatedly rejected the claim that the Sixteenth Amendment was improperly ratified.&amp;nbsp;[...] One would think this repeated rejection of Benson's Sixteenth Amendment argument would put the matter to rest&amp;nbsp;[...] Benson is the co-author of The Law That Never Was, a book that purports to "review the documents concerning the states' ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment" and to show "that only four states ratified the Sixteenth Amendment [and that] the official promulgation of the amendment by Secretary of State Knox in 1913 is therefore void."&amp;nbsp;[...] Benson insists that as the co-author of The Law That Never Was, and the man who actually reviewed the state documents "proving" improper ratification, he is uniquely qualified to make the "exceptionally strong showing" we spoke of in Foster. Because of this, Benson insists, the district court should have at least granted him an evidentiary hearing on the Sixteenth Amendment issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Benson is wrong. In Thomas, we specifically examined the arguments made in The Law That Never Was, and concluded that "Benson ... did not discover anything." We concluded that Secretary Knox's declaration that sufficient states had ratified the Sixteenth Amendment was conclusive, and that "Secretary Knox's decision is now beyond review." [....] It necessarily follows that the district court correctly refused to hold an evidentiary hearing; no hearing is necessary to consider an issue that is "beyond review."&lt;ref&gt;941 F.2d 598, 91-2 U.S. Tax Cas. ([[CCH (company)|CCH]]) ¶ 50,437 (7th Cir. 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Benson's non-ratification argument ruled fraudulent ==

On December 17, 2007, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ruled that Benson's "Reliance Defense Package" (including Benson's Sixteenth Amendment non-ratification argument), which Benson sold to customers via the internet, constituted a "fraud perpetrated by Benson" that had "caused needless confusion and a waste of the customers' and the IRS' time and resources."&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum Opinion, p. 14, Dec. 17, 2007, docket entry 106, ''United States v. Benson'', case no. 1:04-cv-07403, United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court stated: "Benson has failed to point to evidence that would create a genuinely disputed fact regarding whether the Sixteenth Amendment was properly ratified or whether United States Citizens are legally obligated to pay federal taxes. Also, as is indicated above, Benson is precluded in this action from taking the position that the Sixteenth Amendment was not properly ratified."&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum Opinion, p. 9, Dec. 17, 2007, docket entry 106, ''United States v. Benson'', case no. 1:04-cv-07403, United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.&lt;/ref&gt; The court stated that "the undisputed evidence shows that Benson had actual knowledge that the information in the Reliance Defense Package was false or fraudulent."&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum Opinion, p. 10, Dec. 17, 2007, docket entry 106, ''United States v. Benson'', case no. 1:04-cv-07403, United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.&lt;/ref&gt; The court also stated: "Benson falsely tells customers that if they purchase and use his products they will be shielded from criminal prosecution for violating the internal revenue laws. Purchasers of the 'Reliance Defense Package' receive a letter signed by Benson that falsely represents that the purchaser can rely on Benson's research to conclude that the Sixteenth Amendment was not ratified, and that the purchaser is thereby not required to file federal income tax returns or pay federal income or social security taxes to the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum Opinion, p. 2, Dec. 17, 2007, docket entry 106, ''United States v. Benson'', case no. 1:04-cv-07403, United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled that "Benson's position has no merit and he has used his fraudulent tax advice to deceive other citizens and profit from it" in violation of {{usc|26|6700}}.&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum Opinion, p. 22, Dec. 17, 2007, docket entry 106, ''United States v. Benson'', case no. 1:04-cv-07403, United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court granted an injunction under {{usc|26|7408}} prohibiting Benson from promoting the theories in Benson's "Reliance Defense Package," which the court referred to as "false and fraudulent advice concerning the payment of federal taxes."&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum Opinion, p. 9 &amp; p. 20, Dec. 17, 2007, docket entry 106, ''United States v. Benson'', case no. 1:04-cv-07403, United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Permanent Injunction, Jan. 10, 2008, docket entry 116, ''United States v. Benson'', case no. 1:04-cv-07403, United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.&lt;/ref&gt; The court injunction requires that Benson send his customers copies of the order, and that he post the order on his website.&lt;ref&gt;News Release, ''Federal Court Bars Illinois Man from Promoting Fraudulent Tax Scam; William J. Benson Sold Bogus "Defenses" to Criminal Tax Prosecution'', Jan. 11, 2008, U.S. Dep't of Justice, at [http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/January/08_tax_020.html].&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2008 Benson had modified his web site and posted a copy of the court order.

Benson appealed the decision of the District Court. Benson argued that prohibiting him from selling his "Reliance Defense Package" and his "16th Amendment Reliance Package" was a violation of his First Amendment Rights. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected that argument in a ruling on April 6, 2009. The Court ruled that although Benson could sell his book, ''The Law that Never Was'', the court order prohibiting him from selling his "Reliance Defense Package" and his "16th Amendment Reliance Package" did not violate his First Amendment Right, as the sale of those two items constituted "false commercial speech."&lt;ref&gt;Entry 58, p. 14, April 6, 2009, case no. 08-1312 and case no. 08-1586, ''United States v. Benson'', 561 F.3d 718 (7th Cir. 2009), ''cert. denied'', no. 09-464 (Nov. 30, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court of Appeals stated:

::Benson knew or had reason to know that his statements were false or fraudulent. 26 U.S.C. [section] 6700(a)(2)(A). Benson's claim to have discovered that the Sixteenth Amendment was not ratified has been rejected by this Court in Benson's own criminal appeal. [ . . . . ] Benson knows that his claim that he can rely on his book to prevent federal prosecution is equally false because his attempt to rely on his book in his own criminal case was ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Entry 58, pp. 8 &amp; 9, April 6, 2009, case no. 08-1312 and case no. 08-1586, ''United States v. Benson'', 561 F.3d 718 (7th Cir. 2009), ''cert. denied'', no. 09-464 (Nov. 30, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court of Appeals also ruled that the government could obtain a ruling ordering Benson to turn his customer list over to the government.&lt;ref&gt;Entry 58, p. 18, April 6, 2009, case no. 08-1312 and case no. 08-1586, ''United States v. Benson'', 561 F.3d 718 (7th Cir. 2009), ''cert. denied'', no. 09-464 (Nov. 30, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Benson petitioned the United States Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court denied his petition in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;''Cert. denied'', no. 09-464 (Nov. 30, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Followers of Benson==
Followers of Benson who have been convicted of federal tax crimes include Kenneth L. Thomas and Wayne Wojtas (see above). Additionally, on March 6, 2008, the United States Attorney's office in Grand Rapids, Michigan announced that Charles E. Hughes of Dansville, Michigan had been convicted of four counts of tax evasion. Hughes had purchased Benson's "16th Amendment Reliance Defense Package" for $3,500, and had used the materials. The U.S. Attorney's office stated:

:Although the legal analysis and claims contained in the package have been thoroughly discredited, some persons who purchase this or similar packages have used it in an attempt to justify their decision to stop paying federal income taxes. Hughes made that choice. He failed to file his 2000 through 2002, and 2004 federal tax returns, despite having more than $300,000 in income over that period. In addition to his failure to file returns, Hughes also took affirmative steps to avoid having federal tax withheld from his income, including the filing of fraudulent forms.&lt;ref&gt;Press Release, March 6, 2008, "Dansville Man Sentenced For Tax Evasion," Office of the United States Attorney, Western District of Michigan, Grand Rapids, Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tipstaff''' is an officer of a [[court]] or, in some countries, a [[law clerk]] to a judge. The duties of the position vary from country to country. It is also the name of a symbolic rod, which represents the authority of the tipstaff or other officials such as senior police officers.

[[File:BLW Tipstaves at Bedford Museum.jpg|thumb|Tipstaves (the short [[Club (weapon)|club]] after which the office is named) on display at [[Bedford Museum &amp; Art Gallery|Bedford Museum]]]]

==History==
[[File:Tipstaffs in West Midlands Police Museum.jpg|right|thumb|Police tipstaffs in [[West Midlands Police Museum]]]]

The office of the Tipstaff is thought{{by whom|date=August 2012}} to have been created in the 14th century.  One of the earliest records of the Tipstaff was mentioned in 1570: "The [[Knight Marshal]]l with all hys tippe staues".  It is a position of both law enforcement and ceremonial duties.&lt;ref name="HMCS website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/hmcts/ |title=About HM Courts &amp; Tribunals Service |publisher=Hmcourts-service.gov.uk |date=1 April 2011 |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier mention of tipstaff is in 1555 when the Rev'd Dr [[Rowland Taylor]] was burned at the stake during the reign of [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]] for his religious views that were contrary to those of the [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Stephen Gardiner|Gardiner]]. In [[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]] it states that Dr Taylor would have spoken to the people but as soon as he opened his mouth the yeoman of the guard thrust a tipstaff into his mouth, and would in no wise permit him to speak. This is also quoted in the book ''Five English Reformers'' by [[J. C. Ryle]].&lt;ref&gt;Five English Reformers, page 85. 1961, Banner of Truth Trust publishers. First published in "Light from Old Times", 1890.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name originates from the early law enforcement officers who would apprehend a person intended for arrest by enforcing their duty, if necessary, with a tipped staff or stave.  The staff was made of wood or metal or both, topped with a crown.  The crown, which unscrewed, could be removed to reveal inside the hollow staff a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] appointing the holder to his position of authority.  Some staffs were definitely a means of protection and this is where the present day policeman's [[Baton (law enforcement)|baton]] originates.&lt;ref name="HMCS website"/&gt;

Examples remain at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] and the [[Metropolitan Police]] museum in London and vary depending on the type and rank of officer.{{Clarify|date=January 2009|reason=Examples of the officers or the staffs?}} These tipstaves were first carried in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. When detectives (in plain clothes) were first authorised the tipstaves issued to plain clothes officers from 1867 were re-issued in 1870 engraved "Metropolitan Police officer in plain clothes".{{Clarify|date=January 2009}}&lt;ref name="HMCS website"/&gt;

The staff kept at the Royal Courts of Justice is now only used on ceremonial occasions.  It is 12&amp;nbsp;inches in length and made of ebony decorated with a silver crown and three bands of silver engraved with the Royal Arms at the top. Around the middle is inscribed "AMOS HAWKINS, TIPSTAFF COURTS OF CHANCERY" and around the bottom is inscribed "Appointed 14th January, 1884, by the [[Rt. Hon.]] [[Roundell Palmer, 1st Earl of Selborne|The Earl of Selborne]], [[Lord Chancellor|L.C.]]” with another coats of Royal Arms.  The date was that on which this staff was first used, soon after the Law Courts were opened.  Prior to 1884, each Tipstaff had his own staff, which he retained when he retired.&lt;ref name="HMCS website"/&gt;
[[File:Rank insignia of police ACC or commander.jpg|right|thumb|Crossed tipstaffs within a wreath - rank of police assistant chief constable or commander in the UK]]

==As a symbol==
The emblem of two crossed tipstaves (tipstaffs) within a wreath appears on the rank insignia of senior police officers in several Commonwealth countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia. In Canada, the emblem is used for the most senior officers of the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] and [[Royal Newfoundland Constabulary]].

==Current usage==
===Australia===
{{Main article|Judge's associate}}
In Australia, a tipstaff is roughly equivalent to a [[law clerk]] in the [[United States]]. The term is used principally in the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]].

===United Kingdom===
{{Law enforcement in the United Kingdom}}

====England and Wales====
There are currently two Tipstaves in England and Wales: one is an officer of the [[Royal Borough of Kingston]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kingston.gov.uk/information/your_council/mayor/governance.htm |title=Governance |publisher=Kingston.gov.uk |date=24 July 2010 |accessdate=30 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013141744/http://www.kingston.gov.uk/information/your_council/mayor/governance.htm |archivedate=13 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other an officer of the [[High Court of England and Wales]], appointed under section 27 of the [[Courts Act 1971]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dca.gov.uk/publications/annual_reports/2003/judstat03_ch08.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090117130040/http://www.dca.gov.uk/publications/annual_reports/2003/judstat03_ch08.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 January 2009 |title= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the latter to which this section refers.

The High Court Tipstaff may appoint three assistants and can call on any [[constable]], [[bailiff]] or member of the public to assist in carrying out their duties. Their jurisdiction extends throughout [[England and Wales]]. They are authorised to force entry if necessary, and will have a police officer present to prevent breach of the peace. The relevant [[territorial police force]] is informed of arrests.&lt;ref name="HMCS website"/&gt;

Sometimes a local bailiff or police will detain a person in custody until the Tipstaff arrives to collect him and take him to court or prison. [[Pentonville Prison]] (for civil offenders) is obliged to take into custody‚ no matter what the circumstances‚ anybody taken there by the Tipstaff.&lt;ref name="HMCS website"/&gt; Tipstaff may make the same demands of the custody suite within the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] itself, and they are obliged to take into custody any individual he brings there.

The Tipstaff heads a procession of the Lord Chancellor and judges at the start of the legal year‚ preceding them with his staff as a symbol of authority and law enforcement. They also lead the Lord Mayor from his golden coach to the Lord Chief Justice's Court for the "swearing in" of the Lord Mayor‚ afterwards attending the Lord Mayor's Banquet, having led the Lord Chancellor into the Guildhall. The black uniform‚ only worn on ceremonial occasions‚ is based on that of a Victorian police inspector. They wear a black hat with gold braid trimmings and jacket with silver buttons‚ a wing collar with a white bow tie and white gloves. The Tipstaff is the only person authorised to make an arrest within the precincts of the Royal Courts of Justice.&lt;ref name="HMCS website"/&gt;

Every applicable order made in the High Court is addressed to the Tipstaff: "I hereby command you the Tipstaff and your assistants in Her Majesty's name to take and safely convey and deliver the said ... to the Governor of Her Majesty's Prison ..."(as in the case of making an arrest). The majority of their work involves taking children into custody (i.e. a place of safety)‚ including cases of [[child abduction]] abroad.&lt;ref name="HMCS website"/&gt;

In child abduction cases, there may be a 'seek and locate' order backed by a [[bench warrant]] ordering any person with knowledge of the child to give that information to the Tipstaff or to his deputy or assistants. Related orders may require the alleged abductor to hand his or her passport and other travel documents to the Tipstaff, and order the Tipstaff to take the child and deliver him/her to a designated place. There may also be a 'port alert' executed by the Tipstaff, to help prevent the child being taken abroad.&lt;ref name="HMCS website"/&gt;

In the case of children who have been declared a [[ward of court]] i.e. where the court is acting [[in loco parentis]], the Tipstaff has a role in ensuring that those children are delivered to the locations specified by the court.&lt;ref name="HMCS website"/&gt;

====Northern Ireland====
Tipstaffs and Court Criers in Northern Ireland have no enforcement role, but act as personal assistants to High Court and County Court judges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/F286B853-D16B-4ECB-9B0F-AC0EB61B4DD6/0/CandidateinformationBooklet.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424075306/http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/F286B853-D16B-4ECB-9B0F-AC0EB61B4DD6/0/CandidateinformationBooklet.pdf |date=24 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In some states of the United States, the Tipstaff is called a Tipstave and is responsible for courtroom decorum.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} His position is similar to that of a [[bailiff]]. The Civil Division of the Municipal Court of [[Philadelphia]] employs Tipstaves as clerks to the court. The Criminal Trial Division employs Tipstaves in positions commonly referred to as Court officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://courts.phila.gov/municipal/civil/#mc-tipstaves |title=Municipal Court – Civil Division @ The Philadelphia Courts – First Judicial District of Pennsylvania |publisher=Courts.phila.gov |date= |accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6533">The '''Transport Act 1983''' (the Act) was the main statute establishing government transport organisations and regulating land transport activities in the [[State of Victoria]], [[Australia]] for 27 years from mid-1983 to mid-2010.  The Act was used as the vehicle for changes to transport organisational arrangements and transport regulation activities pursued by Victorian governments over that period.

The Transport Act received the [[royal assent]] on 23 June 1983 and commenced on 1 July of that year.&lt;ref&gt;See endnotes, [[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act remained as Victoria's principal transport statute until mid-2010 when that position was taken by a new statute, the [[Transport Integration Act 2010]].  It was renamed as the [[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]], a title which it retains to this day.

== Initial purpose ==

=== Organisational reforms ===
The Transport Act was initially passed by the [[Victorian Parliament]] as a major reform measure particularly in relation to institutional arrangements in the transport portfolio.  The Act abolished a range of long established transport agencies including the [[Victorian Railways]], the [[Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board]] and the [[Country Roads Board]].&lt;ref&gt;Transport Act, Part II.&lt;/ref&gt;  In their place a range of new organisations including the [[State Transport Authority (Victoria)|State Transport Authority]], the [[Metropolitan Transit Authority (Victoria)|Metropolitan Transit Authority]], the [[Road Construction Authority]] and the Road Traffic Authority were established.&lt;ref&gt;Transport Act 1983, Part II.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Transport Act also established the Ministry of Transport as the prime coordinating agency for transport in Victoria.

=== Transport regulation ===
The Transport Act also consolidated much of the suite of Victorian land transport statutes containing regulatory controls. The Act initially contained a suite of provisions affecting trains and trams, buses, taxis and hire cars and tow trucks.  Few of these provisions remain today in the [[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983|Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act]].  The main schemes which remain relate to taxi and hire car regulation, the only substantial area of Victorian transport regulation not to be contained in a discrete statute, and provisions relating to compliance and enforcement in safety areas and affecting public transport ticketing and conduct.

== Later developments ==
The major organisational changes brought about by the Transport Act were themselves the subject of major changes in the period after 1983.

=== 1989 organisational consolidation ===
{{Main|Public Transport Corporation|VicRoads}}
In 1989, the Victorian Parliament passed a new statute, the Transport (Amendment) Act, which made major adjustments to the initial organisational changes made by the Transport Act in 1983.  The new Act merged the [[State Transport Authority (Victoria)|State Transport Authority]] and the [[Metropolitan Transit Authority (Victoria)|Metropolitan Transit Authority]] to establish a new organisation, the [[Public Transport Corporation]], to manage train, tram and bus operations in metropolitan and regional areas of Victoria.  The Transport (Amendment) Act also merged the [[Road Construction Authority]] and the Road Traffic Authority to create the Roads Corporation or [[VicRoads]] to manage the State's road network and its vehicle licensing and registration systems.  The mergers took effect on 1 July 1989.

=== Other organisational changes ===
{{Main|Transport Integration Act|Director of Public Transport|VicTrack|V/Line}}
Other major organisational changes occurred after 1989 including the establishment of the office of the [[Director of Public Transport]] and the abolition of the [[Public Transport Corporation]] as well as the creation of discrete and special purpose organisations such as [[VicTrack]] and [[V/Line]].

=== Regulatory developments ===
{{Main|Rail Safety Act|Accident Towing Services Act|Bus Safety Act|Tourist and Heritage Railways Act}}
Many of the regulatory consolidations effected by the Transport Act have been reversed since the Act was initially passed. In many cases, the Victorian Parliament has acted to pass new principal statutes for subject matters previously regulated by the Transport Act, for example:

* Public Transport Competition Act 1995 (since renamed the Bus Services Act 1995)
* Rail Corporations Act 1996
* [[Rail Safety Act|Rail Safety Act 2006]]
* [[Accident Towing Services Act|Accident Towing Services Act 2007]]
* [[Bus Safety Act|Bus Safety Act 2009]], and
* [[Tourist and Heritage Railways Act|Tourist and Heritage Railways Act 2010]].

== The Transport Integration Act 2010 ==
{{Main|Transport Integration Act}}
The Victorian Parliament passed a major new transport statute, the [[Transport Integration Act]], in early 2010 and it commenced on 1 July of that year.  The new Act took over from the Transport Act as Victoria's main transport statute and, at the same time, it stretched beyond land transport settings to cover ports and marine activities.&lt;ref name="TIA2010"&gt;[[Transport Integration Act 2010]] - see Parts 3, 5 and 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transfer of organisations ===
All Victorian transport organisations created by statute have been transferred to the [[Transport Integration Act]] including the land transport agencies previously established and empowered by the Transport Act.&lt;ref name="TIA2010"/&gt;

=== Change of name of Transport Act ===
{{Main|Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983}}
The [[Transport Integration Act]] changed the name of the Transport Act 1983 to the [[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Transport Integration Act]], section 199(1).&lt;/ref&gt;   The name change took effect on 1 July 2010.

The [[alcohol laws of the United States by state|alcohol laws of the United States]] regarding minimum age for purchase have changed over time.  This history is given in the table below.  Unless otherwise noted, if different alcohol categories have different minimum purchase ages, the age listed below is set at the ''lowest age given'' (e.g. if the purchase age is 18 for beer and 21 for wine or spirits, as was the case in several states, the age in the table will read as "18", not "21").  In addition, the ''purchase age'' is not necessarily the same as the minimum age for ''consumption'' of alcoholic beverages, although they have often been the same.

As one can see in the table below, there has been much volatility in the states' drinking ages since the
[[Repeal of Prohibition|repeal]] of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] in 1933.  Shortly after the ratification of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st amendment]] in December, most states set their purchase ages at 21 since that was the [[voting age]] at the time. Most of these limits remained constant until the early 1970s.  From 1969 to 1976, some 30 states lowered their purchase ages, generally to 18. This was primarily because the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 in 1971 with the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|26th amendment]]. Many states started to lower their minimum drinking age in response, most of this occurring in 1972 or 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://report.nih.gov/nihfactsheets/viewfactsheet.aspx?csid=21 |title=NIH Fact Sheets - Underage Drinking |website=Report.nih.gov |date=2013-03-29 |accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson |first=Hunter |url=http://history128.web.unc.edu/2015/04/06/lowered-drinking-age-of-the-1970s/ |title=Lowered Drinking Age of the 1970’s &amp;#124; history 128 blog |website=History128.web.unc.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Toomey |first1=Traci L. |last2=Nelson |first2=Toben F. |last3=Lenk |first3=Kathleen M. |title=The age-21 minimum legal drinking age: a case study linking past and current debates |journal=Addiction |volume=104 |issue=12 |pages=1958–65 |year=2009 |pmid=19922564 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02742.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve states kept their purchase ages at 21 since repeal of Prohibition and never changed them.

From 1976 to 1983, several states voluntarily raised their purchase ages to 19 (or, less commonly, 20 or 21), in part to combat [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]] fatalities.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} In 1984, Congress passed the [[National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984|National Minimum Drinking Age Act]], which required states to raise their ages for purchase and public possession to 21 by October 1986 or lose 10% of their federal highway funds. By mid-1988, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had raised their purchase ages to 21 (but not Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, see Additional Notes below). [[South Dakota]] and [[Wyoming]] were the final two states to comply with the age 21 mandate. The current drinking age of 21 remains a point of contention among many Americans, because of it being higher than the age of majority (18 in most states) and higher than the drinking ages of most other countries. The National Minimum Drinking Age Act is also seen as a congressional sidestep of the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|tenth amendment]]. Although debates have not been highly publicized, a few states have proposed legislation to lower their drinking age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keen |first=Judy |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-03-20-drinkingage_N.htm |title=States weigh lowering drinking age |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Guam has raised its drinking age to 21 in July 2010.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guamlegislature.com/Public_Laws_30th/P.L.%2030-156%20-%20Bill%20No.%20389-30%20(COR).pdf|title=Ramon Someros Oberiano Act|last=|first=|date=8 July 2010|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Additional notes ==
* Contrary to popular belief, since the [[National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984]], not all states specifically prohibit minors' and young adults' consumption of alcohol in private settings.  That is because the federal law is concerned only with purchase and public possession, not private consumption, and contains several exceptions. As of January 1, 2007, 14 states and the District of Columbia ban underage consumption outright, 19 states do not specifically ban underage consumption outright, and 17 states have family member or location exceptions to their underage consumption laws. Federal law explicitly provides for religious, medical, employment and private club possession exceptions; as of 2005, 31 states have family member or location exceptions to their underage possession laws.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;
* In the 1960s the age for buying or drinking beer and wine in the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.) was 18; the age for hard liquor was 21.&lt;ref name=dcdebcontonal/&gt;&lt;ref name=bftlda1871/&gt; Residents from Virginia and Maryland would often drive to D.C. to obtain alcohol. In [[Louisiana]], the 1987 law raising the age from 18 to 21 was deliberately written solely to comply with the [[National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984]] to avoid losing highway funding, while still allowing 18- to 20-year-olds to drink as before.  Not only did it still allow 18- to 20-year-olds to consume in private, it contained a major loophole allowing bars and stores to ''sell'' alcohol to 18- to 20-year-olds without penalty (despite ''purchase'' being technically illegal) which meant that the ''de facto'' age was still 18.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; In other words, the drinking age was 21 only on paper. This loophole was closed in 1995, but in 1996 the Louisiana Supreme Court declared a drinking age of 21 unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;  That briefly lowered the ''de jure'' purchase age to 18, causing an uproar which prompted the Louisiana Supreme Court to reverse its decision, raising the age to 21 three months later.&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt; Other exceptions still remain to this day, including drinking in a private residence,&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; and Louisiana still has some of the most liberal general alcohol laws of any state.
* Some states were "dry" well before national [[Prohibition]] was enacted in 1919, in some cases since achieving statehood.  Also, some states did not become fully "wet" until several years after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933 (e.g. Mississippi in 1966).  Since 1966, all states and territories of the USA have been "wet", but [[dry counties]] and towns still exist in some states.

The '''United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change''' ('''UNFCCC''') is an [[International law|international]] [[Environmental protocol|environmental treaty]] adopted on 9 May 1992 and opened for signature at the [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] from 3 to 14 June 1992. It then entered into force on 21 March 1994, after a sufficient number of countries had ratified it. The UNFCCC objective is to "stabilize [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic interference]] with the [[climate system]]".&lt;ref name="art2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/background_publications_htmlpdf/application/pdf/conveng.pdf|title=Article 2|work=The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework sets non binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions for individual countries and contains no enforcement mechanisms. Instead, the framework outlines how specific international treaties (called "protocols" or "Agreements") may be negotiated to specify further action towards the objective of the UNFCCC

Initially, an Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) produced the text of the Framework Convention during its meeting in New York from 30 April to 9 May 1992. The UNFCCC was adopted on 9 May 1992, and opened for signature on 4 June 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Status of Ratification of the Convention|publisher= United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change |url= https://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/status_of_ratification/items/2631.php |accessdate= 10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UNFCCC has 197 parties as of December 2015. The convention enjoys broad legitimacy, largely due to its nearly universal membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://report.mitigation2014.org/drafts/final-draft-postplenary/ipcc_wg3_ar5_final-draft_postplenary_chapter13.pdf R.

In 2015 the [[Paris Agreement]] was adopted, governing emission reductions from 2020 on through commitments of countries in Nationally Determined Contributions. The Paris Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016.

One of the first tasks set by the UNFCCC was for signatory nations to establish [[greenhouse gas inventory|national greenhouse gas inventories]] of [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions and removals, which were used to create the 1990 benchmark levels for accession of Annex I countries to the Kyoto Protocol and for the commitment of those countries to GHG reductions. Updated inventories must be submitted annually by Annex I countries.

"UNFCCC" is also the name of the [[United Nations Secretariat]] charged with supporting the operation of the Convention, with offices in [[Haus Carstanjen]], and the UN Campus (known as [[Langer Eugen]]) in [[Bonn, Germany]]. From 2010 to 2016 the head of the secretariat was [[Christiana Figueres]]. In July 2016, [[Patricia Espinosa]] succeeded Figueres. The Secretariat, augmented through the parallel efforts of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), aims to gain consensus through meetings and the discussion of various strategies.

== Treaty ==
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was opened for signature at the 1992 [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED) in [[Rio de Janeiro]] (known by its popular title, the [[Earth Summit]]). On 12 June 1992, 154 nations signed the UNFCCC, which upon ratification committed signatories' governments to reduce atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases with the goal of "preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with Earth's climate system".  This commitment would require substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions (see the later section, [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations|"Stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations"]])

Article 3(1) of the Convention&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation

 | url=http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1355.php
}}, in {{harvnb|United Nations|1992}}
&lt;/ref&gt; states that Parties should act to protect the climate system on the basis of "common but differentiated responsibilities", and that developed country Parties should "take the lead" in addressing climate change. Under Article 4, all Parties make general commitments to address climate change through, for example, climate change mitigation and adapting to the eventual impacts of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The extent to which developing country Parties will effectively implement their commitments under the Convention will depend on the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology and will take fully into account that economic and social development and [[poverty reduction|poverty eradication]] are the first and overriding priorities of the developing country Parties.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Framework Convention specifies the aim of developed (Annex I) Parties stabilizing their greenhouse gas emissions ([[carbon dioxide]] and other anthropogenic greenhouse gases not regulated under the [[Montreal Protocol]]) at 1990 levels, by the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;

===Kyoto Protocol===
{{main|Kyoto Protocol}}
After the signing of the UNFCCC treaty, Parties to the UNFCCC have met at conferences ("[[UNFCCC#Conferences of the Parties|Conferences of the Parties]]" – COPs) to discuss how to achieve the treaty's aims. At the [[UNFCCC#1995: COP 1, The Berlin Mandate|1st Conference of the Parties]] (COP-1), Parties decided that the aim of Annex I Parties stabilizing their emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 was "not adequate",&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and further discussions at later conferences led to the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. The Kyoto Protocol sets emissions targets for developed countries which are binding under international law.

The Kyoto Protocol has had two commitment periods, the first of which lasted from 2008-2012. The second one runs from 2013-2020 and is based on the Doha Amendment to the Protocol, which has not entered into force.

The US has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, while Canada denounced it in 2012. The Kyoto Protocol has been ratified by all the other Annex I Parties.

All Annex I Parties, excluding the US, have participated in the 1st Kyoto commitment period. 37 Annex I countries and the EU have agreed to second-round Kyoto targets. These countries are Australia, all members of the European Union, Belarus, Croatia, Iceland, Kazakhstan, Norway, Switzerland, and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Figueres|2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine have stated that they may withdraw from the Protocol or not put into legal force the Amendment with second round targets.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Allan|Kruppa|2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Japan, New Zealand, and Russia have participated in Kyoto's first-round but have not taken on new targets in the second commitment period. Other developed countries without second-round targets are Canada (which withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol in 2012)&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States.

===Paris Agreement===
{{main|Paris Agreement}}
In 2011, parties adopted the "Durban Platform for Enhanced Action".&lt;ref name="durban legal instrument"&gt;Paragraphs 2-4, in {{harvnb|COP|2012|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the Durban Platform, parties have agreed to "develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties".&lt;ref name="durban legal instrument"/&gt; At Durban&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|COP|2012|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Doha,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|COP|2013|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; parties noted "with grave concern" that current efforts to hold global warming to below 2 or 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C relative to the pre-industrial level appear inadequate.

In 2015, all (then) 196 parties to the convention came together for the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|UN Climate Change Conference]] in Paris 30 November - 12 December and adopted by consensus the Paris Agreement, aimed at limiting global warming to less than two degrees Celsius, and pursue efforts to limit the rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = COP21 {{!}} United nations conference on climate change|url = http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en/|website = www.cop21.gouv.fr|accessdate = 2015-12-07|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151210193240/http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en/|archivedate = 10 December 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Paris Agreement (climate change)|Paris Agreement]] entered into force on November 4, 2016.

=== Intended Nationally Determined Contributions ===
{{Main|Intended Nationally Determined Contributions}}
At the [[2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference|19th session of the Conference of the Parties]] in Warsaw in 2013, the UNFCCC created a mechanism for [[Intended Nationally Determined Contributions|Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs)]] to be submitted in the run up to the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|21st session of the Conference of the Parties in Paris]] (COP21) in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://climateobserver.org/open-and-shut/indc/|title=INDC - Climate Policy Observer|newspaper=Climate Policy Observer|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countries were given freedom and flexibility to ensure these climate change mitigation and adaptation plans were nationally appropriate;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://climateobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/l05.pdf Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action Second session, part seven],'' UNFCCC, Geneva, 12 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; this flexibility, especially regarding the types of actions to be undertook, allowed for developing countries to tailor their plans to their specific adaptation and mitigation needs, as well as towards other needs.

In the aftermath of COP21, these INDCs became Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) when a country ratified the Paris Agreement, unless a new NDC was submitted to the UNFCCC at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/focus/ndc_registry/items/9433.php|title=NDC registry|last=Change|first=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2016 United Nations Climate Change Conference|22nd session of the Conference of the Parties]] (COP22) in Marrakesh focused on these Nationally Determined Contributions and their implementation, after the Paris Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-d&amp;chapter=27&amp;clang=_en|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|language=EN|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Climate and Development Knowledge Network]] (CDKN) created a guide for NDC implementation, for the use of decision makers in Less Developed Countries. In this guide, CDKN identified a series of common challenges countries face in NDC implementation, including how to: 
* build awareness of the need for, and benefits of, action among stakeholders, including key government ministries
* mainstream and integrate climate change into national planning and development processes
* strengthen the links between subnational and national government plans on climate change
* build capacity to analyse, develop and implement climate policy
* establish a mandate for coordinating actions around NDCs and driving their implementation
* address resource constraints for developing and implementing climate change policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdkn.org/ndc-guide/|title=Planning for NDC implementation: A Quick-Start Guide|website=www.cdkn.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other decisions===
In addition to the Kyoto Protocol (and its amendment) and the Paris Agreement, parties to the Convention have agreed to further commitments during UNFCCC Conferences of the Parties. These include the [[2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Bali Action Plan]] (2007),&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|COP|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Copenhagen Accord]] (2009),&lt;ref name="copenhagen accord p5"/&gt;  the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Cancún agreements]] (2010),&lt;ref name="COP 2011"&gt;{{harvnb|COP|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Durban Platform for Enhanced Action]] (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|COP|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Bali Action Plan
As part of the Bali Action Plan, adopted in 2007, all developed country Parties have agreed to "quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives, while ensuring the comparability of efforts among them, taking into account differences in their national circumstances."&lt;ref name="cop bali action plan"&gt;
Decision 1/CP.13, in {{harvnb|COP|2008|p=3}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Developing country Parties agreed to "[nationally] appropriate mitigation actions [NAMAs] context of sustainable development, supported and enabled by technology, financing and capacity-building, in a measurable, reportable and verifiable manner."&lt;ref name="cop bali action plan"/&gt; 42 developed countries have submitted mitigation targets to the UNFCCC secretariat,&lt;ref&gt;
* {{harvnb|UNFCCC|2012c}} (23 August)
* {{harvnb|UNFCCC|2013a}} (18 February)
&lt;/ref&gt; as have 57 developing countries and the [[African Group]] (a group of countries within the UN).&lt;ref&gt;
* {{harvnb|UNFCCC|2013b}} (28 May)
* {{harvnb|UNFCCC|2013c}} (1 July)
&lt;/ref&gt;

;Copenhagen Accord and Cancún agreements
As part of the 2009 Copenhagen negotiations, a number of countries produced the [[Copenhagen Accord]].&lt;ref name="copenhagen accord p5"&gt;
{{harvnb|COP|2010|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Accord states that global warming should be limited to below 2.0&amp;nbsp;°C (3.6&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name="copenhagen accord p5"/&gt; This may be strengthened in 2015 with a target to limit warming to below 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="copenhagen accord p7"&gt;{{harvnb|COP|2009|p=7}}, paragraph 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The Accord does not specify what the baseline is for these temperature targets (e.g., relative to pre-industrial or 1990 temperatures). According to the UNFCCC, these targets are relative to pre-industrial temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNFCCC|2012a}} (16 May)&lt;/ref&gt;

114 countries agreed to the Accord.&lt;ref name="copenhagen accord p5"/&gt; The UNFCCC secretariat notes that "Some Parties [...] stated in their communications to the secretariat specific understandings on the nature of the Accord and related matters, based on which they have agreed to [the Accord]." The Accord was not formally adopted by the Conference of the Parties. Instead, the COP "took note of the Copenhagen Accord."&lt;ref name="copenhagen accord p5"/&gt;

As part of the Accord, 17 developed country Parties and the EU-27 have submitted mitigation targets,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNFCCC|2011a}} (25 February)&lt;/ref&gt; as have 45 developing country Parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNFCCC|2012b}} (21 May)&lt;/ref&gt; Some developing country Parties have noted the need for international support in their plans.

As part of the Cancún agreements, developed and developing countries have submitted mitigation plans to the UNFCCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNFCCC|2011c}} (7 June)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNFCCC|2011b}} (18 March&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These plans are compiled with those made as part of the Bali Action Plan.

;Developing countries
At Berlin,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|COP|1995|pp=4–5}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Cancún,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|COP|2011|p=2}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and Durban,&lt;ref name="durban development"&gt;{{harvnb|COP|2012|p=9}}
&lt;/ref&gt; the development needs of developing country parties were reiterated. For example, the Durban Platform reaffirms that:&lt;ref name="durban development"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] social and economic development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of developing country Parties, and that a low-emission development strategy is central to sustainable development, and that the share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Interpreting Article 2 ===
{{Further|Climate change mitigation}}
The ultimate objective of the Framework Convention is to prevent "dangerous" anthropogenic (i.e., human-caused) interference of the climate system.&lt;ref name=art2/&gt; As is stated in Article 2 of the Convention, this requires that GHG concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where [[climate change and ecosystems|ecosystems]] can adapt naturally to climate change, [[climate change and agriculture|food production]] is not threatened, and [[economics of global warming|economic development]] can proceed in a sustainable fashion.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
To stabilize atmospheric GHG concentrations, global anthropogenic GHG emissions would need to peak then decline (see [[climate change mitigation]]).&lt;ref name="stabilize conc"&gt;
[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/mains5-4.html Section 5.4 Emission trajectories for stabilisation], in: Synthesis Report, in: {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 SYR|2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Lower stabilization levels would require emissions to peak and decline earlier compared to higher stabilization levels.&lt;ref name="stabilize conc"/&gt; The graph above shows projected changes in annual global GHG emissions (measured in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-equivalents) for various stabilization scenarios. The other two graphs show the associated changes in atmospheric GHG concentrations (in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-equivalents) and global mean temperature for these scenarios. Lower stabilization levels are associated with lower magnitudes of global warming compared to higher stabilization levels.&lt;ref name="stabilize conc"/&gt;
[[File:Projected global warming in 2100 for a range of emission scenarios.png|thumb|300px|alt=Refer to caption and image description|Projected global warming in 2100 for a range of emission scenarios]]
There is uncertainty over how GHG concentrations and global temperatures will change in response to anthropogenic emissions (see [[climate change feedback]] and [[climate sensitivity]]).&lt;ref name="uncertainty in projections"&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12877&amp;page=59 Chapters 2 and 3], in: {{harvnb|US NRC|2011}}

The global warming that has already occurred poses a risk to some human and natural systems (e.g., coral reefs).&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, W., ''et al.'', Executive summary, in: [https://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap18_FINAL.pdf Chapter 18: Detection and attribution of observed impacts] (archived {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018073217/https://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap18_FINAL.pdf |date=18 October 2014 }}), pp.982-984, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG2 A|2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Higher magnitudes of global warming will generally increase the risk of negative impacts.&lt;ref name="climate change impacts"&gt;Field, C.B., ''et al.'', Section B: FUTURE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADAPTATION, in: [https://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-TS_FINAL.pdf Technical summary] (archived {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018073024/https://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-TS_FINAL.pdf |date=18 October 2014 }}), pp.59-84, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG2 A|2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Field ''et al.'' (2014),&lt;ref name="climate change impacts"/&gt; climate change risks are "considerable" with 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;°C of global warming, relative to pre-industrial levels. 4&amp;nbsp;°C warming would lead to significantly increased risks, with potential impacts including widespread [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] and reduced global and regional [[food security]].&lt;ref name="climate change impacts"/&gt;

Climate change policies may lead to costs that are relevant to Article 2.&lt;ref name="dangerous climate change"/&gt; For example, more stringent policies to control GHG emissions may reduce the risk of more severe climate change, but may also be more expensive to implement.&lt;ref name="climate change impacts"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogner, H-.H., ''et al.'', [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/ch1s1-2.html Section 1.2.1: Article 2 of the Convention] (archived {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923012655/http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/ch1s1-2.html |date=23 September 2014 }}), in: Chapter 1: Introduction, p.99, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG3|2007}}

&lt;/ref&gt; could lead to global warming (in 2100) of 3.7 to 4.8&amp;nbsp;°C relative to pre-industrial levels (2.5 to 7.8&amp;nbsp;°C including climate uncertainty).&lt;ref&gt;

=== Precautionary principle ===
In decision making, the [[precautionary principle]] is considered when possibly dangerous, irreversible, or catastrophic events are identified, but scientific evaluation of the potential damage is not sufficiently certain (Toth ''et al''., 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;655–656).&lt;ref name="2001 toth precautionary principle"&gt;{{cite book | year = 2001 | contribution = 10.4.2.2 Precautionary Considerations | title = Chapter 10. Decision-making Frameworks | series = Climate Change 2001: Mitigation: Contribution of Working Group III to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change | editor = B. Metz | publisher = Cambridge University Press | author = Toth, F.L. | url = http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/437.htm | display-authors = etal | display-editors = etal | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120412121951/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg3/437.htm | archivedate = 12 April 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The precautionary principle implies an emphasis on the need to prevent such adverse effects.

Uncertainty is associated with each link of the causal chain of climate change. For example, future GHG emissions are uncertain, as are climate change damages. However, following the precautionary principle, uncertainty is not a reason for inaction, and this is acknowledged in Article 3.3 of the UNFCCC (Toth ''et al''., 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;656).&lt;ref name="2001 toth precautionary principle"/&gt;

=== Classification of Parties and their commitments ===
Parties to the UNFCCC are classified as:
* '''Annex I''': There are 43 Parties to the UNFCCC listed in Annex I of the Convention, including the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=anexIlist&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/parties_and_observers/parties/annex_i/items/2774.php|title=List of Annex I Parties to the Convention| publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change | accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These Parties are classified as [[developed country|industrialized (developed) countries]] and "[[transition economy|economies in transition]]" (EITs).&lt;ref name="unfccc parties and observers"&gt;{{citation | title=Parties &amp; Observers | url=http://unfccc.int/parties_and_observers/items/2704.php | publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change | accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 14 EITs are the former centrally-planned ([[Soviet Union|Soviet]]) economies of Russia and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="unfccc annex i"&gt;{{citation | title=Full text of the convention - Annex I | url=http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1346.php | publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change | accessdate=2014-05-15 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517120740/http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1346.php | archivedate=17 May 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annex II Parties are required to provide financial and technical support to the EITs and [[developing countries]] to assist them in reducing their [[greenhouse gas]] emissions ([[climate change mitigation]]) and manage the impacts of climate change ([[climate change adaptation]]).&lt;ref name="unfccc parties and observers"/&gt;
* '''Annex B''': Parties listed in Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol are Annex I Parties with first- or second-round Kyoto greenhouse gas emissions targets (see [[Kyoto Protocol]] for details). The first-round targets apply over the years 2008–2012. As part of the [[2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2012 Doha climate change talks]], an amendment to Annex B was agreed upon containing with a list of Annex I Parties who have second-round Kyoto targets, which apply from 2013–2020.&lt;ref&gt;

== Conferences of the Parties ==
{{main|United Nations Climate Change conference}}
The United Nations Climate Change Conference are yearly conferences held in the framework of the UNFCCC. They serve as the formal meeting of the UNFCCC Parties (''Conferences of the Parties'') (COP) to assess progress in dealing with climate change, and beginning in the mid-1990s, to negotiate the [[Kyoto Protocol]] to establish legally binding obligations for developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="climate-leaders.org"/&gt; From 2005 the Conferences have also served as the [[Meetings of Parties of the Kyoto Protocol (CMP)]]. Also parties to the Convention that are not parties to the Protocol can participate in Protocol-related meetings as observers. The first conference (COP1) was held in 1995 in Berlin. The 3rd conference (COP3) was held in Kyoto and resulted in the Kyoto protocol, which was amended during the [[2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2012 Doha]] Conference (COP18, CMP 8). The [[COP21]] (CMP11)) conference was held in [[Paris, France|Paris]] and resulted in adoption of the [[Paris Agreement]]. Negotiations for the Paris Agreement took place during [[COP22]] in [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]]. The [[2017 United Nations Climate Change Conference|twenty-third COP]] ("COP23") was led by Fiji and took place in [[Bonn]], [[Germany]].

== Subsidiary bodies ==
A subsidiary body is a committee that assists the Conference of the Parties. Subsidiary bodies include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://unfccc.int/essential_background/glossary/items/3666.php | title = Glossary of climate change acronyms | work = Essential Background | publisher = UNFCCC.int | accessdate = 23 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Permanents:
** The [[Subsidiary Body of Scientific and Technological Advice]] (SBSTA) is established by Article 9 of the Convention to provide the Conference of the Parties and, as appropriate, its other subsidiary bodies with timely information and advice on scientific and technological matters relating to the Convention. It serves as a link between information and assessments provided by expert sources (such as the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]) and the COP, which focuses on setting policy.
** The [[Subsidiary Body of Implementation]] (SBI) is established by Article 10 of the Convention to assist the Conference of the Parties in the assessment and review of the effective implementation of the Convention. It makes recommendations on policy and implementation issues to the COP and, if requested, to other bodies.
* Temporary:
** Ad hoc Group on Article 13 (AG13), active from 1995 to 1998;
** Ad hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate (AGBM), active from 1995 to 1997;
** [[Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol]] (AWG-KP), established in 2005 by the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to consider further commitments of industrialized countries under the Kyoto Protocol for the period beyond 2012; it concluded its work in 2012 when the CMP adopted the [[2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Doha Amendment]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://unfccc.int/bodies/body/6409.php | title = What is the AWG-KP? | publisher = UNFCCC.int | accessdate = 23 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action]] (AWG-LCA), established in Bali in 2007 to conduct negotiations on a strengthened international deal on climate change;
** [[Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action]] (ADP), established at [[2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 17 in Durban]] in 2011 "to develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2011/cop17/eng/09a01.pdf#page=2 | title = Establishment of an Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action | work = Decision 1/CP.17 | publisher = UNFCCC.int | accessdate = 23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ADP concluded its work in Paris on 5 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://unfccc.int/bodies/body/6645.php | title = What is the ADP? | publisher = UNFCCC.int | accessdate = 23 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work under the UNFCCC is facilitated by a secretariat in [[Bonn]], Germany. The secretariat is established under Article 8 of the Convention. It is headed by the Executive Secretary. The current Executive Secretary, [[Patricia Espinosa]], was appointed on 18 May 2016 by United Nations Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] and took office on 18 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Secretary|url=http://unfccc.int/secretariat/executive_secretary/items/1200.php|website=unfccc.int|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She succeeded [[Christiana Figueres]] who held the office since 2010. Former Executive Secretaries have been [[Yvo de Boer]] (2006-2010), [[Joke Waller-Hunter]] (2002-2005) and [[Michael Zammit Cutajar]] (1995-2002).

== Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) ==
{{Main|Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE)}}

Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) is a term adopted by the UNFCCC in 2015 to have a better name for this topic than "Article 6". It refers to Article 6 of the Convention's original text (1992), focusing on six priority areas: education, training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information, and international cooperation on these issues. The implementation of all six areas has been identified as the pivotal factor for everyone to understand and participate in solving the complex challenges presented by [[climate change]]. ACE calls on governments to develop and implement educational and public awareness programmes, train scientific, technical and managerial personnel, foster access to information, and promote public participation in addressing climate change and its effects. It also urges countries to cooperate in this process, by exchanging good practices and lessons learned, and strengthening national institutions. This wide scope of activities is guided by specific objectives that, together, are seen as crucial for effectively implementing climate adaptation and mitigation actions, and for achieving the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002464/246435e.pdf|title=Action for climate empowerment: Guidelines for accelerating solutions through education, training and public|last=UNESCO and UNFCCC|first=|publisher=UNESCO and UNFCCC|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3100-182-6|location=|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall umbrella and processes of the UNFCCC and the adopted Kyoto Protocol have been criticized by some as not having achieved its stated goals of reducing the emission of [[carbon dioxide]] (the primary culprit blamed for rising global temperatures of the 21st century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kyoto Protocol: Hot air|url=http://www.nature.com/news/the-kyoto-protocol-hot-air-1.11882|work=Nature|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a speech given at his alma mater, Todd Stern&amp;nbsp;— the US Climate Change envoy&amp;nbsp;— has expressed the challenges with the UNFCCC process as follows, "Climate change is not a conventional environmental issue...It implicates virtually every aspect of a state's economy, so it makes countries nervous about growth and development. This is an economic issue every bit as it is an environmental one."  He went on to explain that, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is a multilateral body concerned with climate change and can be an inefficient system for enacting international policy. Because the framework system includes over 190 countries and because negotiations are governed by consensus, small groups of countries can often block progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Voices" speaker talks climate change |url=http://thedartmouth.com/2012/08/03/news/climate|publisher=The Dartmouth|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure to achieve meaningful progress and reach effective-CO2 reducing-policy treaties among the parties over the past eighteen years have driven some countries like the United States to never ratify the UNFCCC's largest body of work&amp;nbsp;— the Kyoto Protocol, in large part because the treaty didn't cover developing countries who now include the largest CO2 emitters. However, this fails to consider the historical responsibility for climate change since industrialisation, which is a contentious issue in the talks, and the responsibility of emissions from consumption and importation of goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Which nations are most responsible for climate change? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/21/countries-responsible-climate-change|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=2 January 2013|location=London|first=Duncan|last=Clark|date=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also led Canada to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol out of a desire to not force its citizens to pay penalties that would result in wealth transfers out of Canada. Canada formally withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canada pulls out of Kyoto Protocol |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2011/12/12/pol-kent-kyoto-pullout.html|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the US and Canada are looking at [[Voluntary Emissions Reduction]] schemes that they can implement internally to curb carbon dioxide emissions outside the Kyoto Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.N. Global Warming Summit: Heading Over the Climate Cliff|url=http://science.time.com/2012/11/27/u-n-global-warming-summit-heading-over-the-climate-cliff/#ixzz2DcXQP6Zp|work=Time|accessdate=29 November 2012|date=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perceived lack of progress has also led some countries to seek and focus on alternative high-value activities like the creation of the [[Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants]] which seeks to regulate short-lived pollutants such as methane, [[black carbon]] and [[hydrofluorocarbon]]s (HFCs) which together are believed to account for up to 1/3 of current global warming but whose regulation is not as fraught with wide economic impacts and opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secretary Clinton To Announce a Climate and Clean Air Initiative To Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/02/184011.htm|publisher=US Dept of State|accessdate=29 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113045309/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/02/184011.htm#|archive-date=13 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Japan stated that it will not sign up to a second Kyoto term, because it would impose restrictions on it not faced by its main economic competitors, China, India and Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan derails climate talks by refusing to renew Kyoto treaty |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/japan-derails-climate-talks-by-refusing-to-renew-kyoto-treaty-2148769.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=29 November 2012|location=London|first=Michael|last=McCarthy|date=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar indication was given by the Prime Minister of New Zealand in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NZ backs off Kyoto climate change route|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10846305|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=29 November 2012|date=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2012 conference, last minute objections at the conference by Russia, [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and [[Kazakhstan]] were ignored by the governing officials, and they have indicated that they will likely withdraw or not ratify the treaty.&lt;ref name="Belarus negotiator hints at Kyoto exit, says others could follow

&lt;/ref&gt; These defections place additional pressures on the UNFCCC process that is seen by some as cumbersome and expensive: in the UK alone the climate change department has taken over 3,000 flights in two years at a cost of over [[₤]]1,300,000 (British Pounds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK climate change department takes over 3000 flights at a cost of over £1.3m|url=http://www.thecommentator.com/article/1920/uk_climate_change_department_takes_over_3000_flights_at_a_cost_of_over_1_3m|publisher=The Commentator|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]], [[National Geographic Magazine]] added criticism, writing: "Since 1992, when the world's nations agreed at Rio de Janeiro to avoid 'dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system,' they've met 20 times without moving the needle on carbon emissions. In that interval we've added almost as much carbon to the atmosphere as we did in the previous century."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/2015/11/climate-change/introduction-text Fresh Hope for Combating Climate Change], National Geographic, November 2015, page 14 of print edition&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benchmarking===
[[Benchmarking]] is the setting of a policy target based on some frame of reference.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation
 | chapter=Annex I: Glossary:
 | at=[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/annex1-ensglossary-a-d.html Benchmark]
 | editor=Verbruggen, A.
}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG3|2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt; An example of benchmarking is the UNFCCC's original target of Annex I Parties limiting their greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Goldemberg ''et al.'' (1996)&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation
 | author=Goldemberg, J.
 | chapter=1. Scope of the Assessment: 1.4.1 General issues: Benchmarks
|display-authors=etal}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC SAR WG3|1996|pp=32–33}} (pp.38–39 of PDF)
&lt;/ref&gt; commented on the economic implications of this target. Although the target applies equally to all Annex I Parties, the economic costs of meeting the target would likely vary between Parties. For example, countries with initially high levels of [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] might find it more costly to meet the target than countries with lower levels of energy efficiency. From this perspective, the UNFCCC target could be viewed as [[equity (economics)|inequitable]], i.e., unfair.

Benchmarking has also been discussed in relation to the first-round emissions targets specified in the [[Kyoto Protocol]] (see [[views on the Kyoto Protocol]] and [[Kyoto Protocol and government action]]).

The '''''Utrecht Journal of International and European Law''''' is a biannual [[peer-reviewed]] [[open access]] [[law review|law journal]] covering [[International law|international]] and [[European Union law|European law]]. It is affiliated with [[Utrecht University]] and [[Urios]].

The journal was established in 1981 as a student [[magazine]] titled ''Merkourios'', containing summaries of study-trips, conferences, and other issues related to Urios, an association for international and European law. Since then it has evolved from a magazine into a formal, academic law journal. This development was finalised in 2009, when peer-review was officially integrated into the reviewing process. The journal obtained its current name in 2013, and is published by [[Ubiquity Press]].[http://www.ubiquitypress.com/site/journals/]

[[File:1912_Wild_Dogs_Act_Australia.png|thumb|350px|right]]

The '''Wild Dogs Act''', initially passed in 1912, was a piece of [[South Australia|South Australian]] legislation regarding wild [[Dog|dogs]] and [[dingo]]s in [[Australia]], and subtitled ''An Act to provide for the Destruction of Wild Dogs''. This act led to an economy of [[dingo scalping]] to collect bounties.&lt;ref name="Keen2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Keen|title=Indigenous Participation in Australian Economies: Historical and Anthropological Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8IhO9UdBfU4C&amp;pg=PA11|year=2010|publisher=ANU E Press|isbn=978-1-921666-86-5|pages=11–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This act was followed by updates and amendments, including 1931, 1938, and 1948.&lt;ref name="Australia1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=South Australia|title=Acts of the Parliament of South Australia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V84_AQAAIAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Government Printer, South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wirt Adams Yerger, Jr.''' (born June 1930),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mylife.com/wirt-yerger/e306067311948|title=Wirt Yerger|publisher=Mylife.com|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a retired [[business]]man from [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], [[Mississippi]], who is the founding 20th century state chairman of the [[Mississippi Republican Party]], a position that he filled from 1956 to 1966.

==Background==

Yerger is a son of Wirt Yerger, Sr. (1901-1974) and Rivers Applewhite Yerger (1904-1991), she a native of [[Columbia, Mississippi|Columbia]] in [[Marion County, Mississippi|Marion County]] in southwestern Mississippi. The couple is interred at Greenwood Cemetery in the capital city of Jackson, as are other family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/111699935|title=Rivers Applewhite Yerger|publisher=findagrave.com|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yerger's younger brother, William Swan Yerger (born 1932), is a retired [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds County]] [[circuit court]] [[judge]] who held his office from 1997 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mslitigationreview.com/2009/06/articles/hinds-county-circuit-court-2/hinds-circuit-judge-swan-yerger-announces-retirement-in-2010/|title=Philip Thomas, Hinds Circuit Judge Swan Yerger announces retirement in 2010, June 1, 2009|publisher=''Mississippi Litigation Review''|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swan Yerger, as he is known, ran unsuccessfully as a Republican [[Candidate|nominee]] at the age of thirty-one for the [[Mississippi House of Representatives]] in 1963 against [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] William I. S. "Billy" Thompson, the son of Jackson [[List of mayors of Jackson, Mississippi|Mayor]] [[Allen C. Thompson]]. At the time, Swan Yerger was a staunch critic of [[unpledged elector]]s, which had carried Mississippi in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1960|1960 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;Billy Hathorn, "Challenging the Status Quo: Rubel Lex Phillips and the Mississippi Republican Party (1963-1967)", ''The Journal of Mississippi History'' XLVII, November 1985, No. 4, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yerger is a former [[insurance agent]] with the firm Ross &amp; Yerger (founded 1860) in Jackson. He is affiliated with [[Rotary International]], the [[Chamber of Commerce]], and the [[YMCA]]. One of the founders of the Fondren Renaissance Foundation, he also operates the Wirt A. Yerger Jr. Foundation, Inc. He and his wife, Mary, have three children, one of whom is the businessman Wirt, III (born May 1957).&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfgreaterjackson.org/giving-you-best.html|title=Wirt Yerger, Jr.|publisher=cfgreaterjackson.org|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political life==

===Winning the chairmanship by one vote===
Yerger led a younger and more vigorous group of [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] entrepreneurs, businesspeople, and lawyers, some having previously been part of the Young Republicans organization, and most the product of increasing [[Urban area|urbanization]] of a still heavily [[rural]]-oriented state. At the age of twenty-six, he was named in  Jackson as the party's first chairman by the margin of his one vote, his own. Yerger's [[Political faction|faction]] defeated a motion to include [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in the first party [[Political platform|platform]],&lt;ref name=madison/&gt; but many of the early Mississippi Republicans, like their Democratic counterparts, were segregationists. In 1957 and 1958, Yerger was placed on the defensive in Mississippi following the desegregation of [[Little Rock Central High School]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], [[Arkansas]]. Years later, Yerger said that he and his wife were harassed by segregationists, the kind of treatment also received by [[civil rights]] activists, because he was viewed as a threat to "white rule" as the chairman of the party of the president, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who intervened in Little Rock. In 1960, the Mississippi GOP declared segregation a "local matter that could best be handled by individual states" and attempted to focus on other matters, such as [[reapportionment]] of legislative bodies and [[Local option|local-option]] liquor elections to replace statewide [[prohibition]], which ended in Mississippi in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;"Challenging the Status Quo", p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replacing the Black and Tans===
Yerger's conservatives, who stressed [[States' rights]], replaced the former [[black-and-tan faction|Black and Tan contingent]], which had governed the state party from [[Washington, D.C.]], with the [[African-American]] [[lawyer]] [[Perry Wilbon Howard]] as the national committeeman and the past dispenser of the limited federal patronage in the state.&lt;ref name=jacksonfp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2009/may/12/yergers-revisionist-lily-white-history/|title=Ronni Mott, Yerger's Revisionist ‘Lily White' History, May 12, 2009|publisher=''[[Jackson Free Press]]''|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[1952 Republican National Convention]] in [[Chicago]], Howard led an all-black delegation pledged not to Eisenhower, but [[U.S. Senator]] [[Robert A. Taft]] of [[Ohio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mises.org/daily/2755|title=Murray N. Rothbard, "Swan Song of the Old Right"|publisher=mises.org|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a favorite of the conservative forces but known for his opposition to segregation, in Taft's words: "No segregationist belongs on a Republican ticket or even in the party".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Challenging the Status Quo", p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Yerger and Howard factions, there were two other smaller groups contending for intraparty power, the [[Lily-White Movement]], led by [[George L. Sheldon]], a former [[governor of Nebraska]], who had run for governor of Mississippi in 1947 and polled only 2.5 percent of the vote, and the "Democrats for Eisenhower" under E. O. Spencer. Some media had incorrectly identified Yerger as the head of the Lily Whites who had ousted the Black and Tans.&lt;ref name=madison&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinemadison.com/m/Articles.aspx?ArticleID=23246|title=Yerger recounts history of state GOP in new book|publisher=onlinemadison.com|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George Sheldon's son, Anson Hoisington Sheldon (born 1905 in Nebraska), a resident of [[Washington County, Mississippi|Washington County]], was a member of the Mississippi Republican State Executive Committee from 1944 to 1967, the state chairman from 1948 to 1952, the vice-chairman from 1952 to 1967, and a delegate to the [[Republican National Convention]]s of [[1956 Republican National Convention|1956]] and [[1960 Republican National Convention|1960]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/sheldon.html#867.05.30|title=Sheldon, Anson Hoisington|publisher=[[The Political Graveyard]]|accessdate=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Sheldon's earlier tenure as chairman, the Yerger faction considered Yerger to be the first of the modern state Republican chairmen in Mississippi. Yerger said that his forces represented "the ultimate break with the old-line, [[Racism|racist]] [[Southern Democrats]] who didn't know whether they wanted to be [[Liberal (politics)|liberal]] or conservative, but were vocally committed to keeping long-held, highly corrupted power."&lt;ref name=book/&gt;

===Building a party from scratch===
Yerger held party positions beyond Mississippi. He was the chairman of the Mississippi delegation to the [[Republican National Convention]]s in 1956, 1960, and [[1964 Republican National Convention|1964]]. In 1960, Yerger was elected to a four-year term as chairman of the Southern Association of Republican State Chairmen.&lt;ref name=misspol/&gt; In 1963, Yerger was named Mississippi chairman of the [[Draft Goldwater Committee]] under the national director, [[Peter O'Donnell (Texas)|Peter O'Donnell, Jr.]], of [[Dallas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.ecfs.org/fieldston57/since40/units/unit3/supplements/EdsallChain.html|title=Thomas Byrne Edsall with Mary D. Edsall, "A Pivotal Year"|publisher=projects.ecfs.org|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Yerger lost a bid to become the national head of the organization of state Republican Party chairmen. His opposition to the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] was a factor in his defeat for that position. Yerger had an altercation with liberal Republican [[Charles H. Percy]], a defeated candidate for [[governor of Illinois]] in 1964 but a successful nominee in 1966 for the [[U.S. Senate]]. Percy accepted an invitation to speak before the Mississippi Council on Human Relations, a biracial group sponsored by the Southern Regional Council. Yerger branded the group a "Democratic [[Front organization|front]]" and worked with Illinois Republicans to have Percy's speech scuttled.&lt;ref name=jacksonfp/&gt;

Yerger built his state party from scratch. He gained recognition for his chairmanship from the Eisenhower administration and thereafter supported the presidential candidacies of [[Richard M. Nixon]] and [[Barry M. Goldwater]]. In April 1961, the first Republican in Mississippi during the Yerger chairmanship was elected to a local office; '''Joe O. Sams, Jr.''', of [[Columbus, Mississippi|Columbus]] became the county attorney of [[Lowndes County, Mississippi|Lowndes County]].&lt;ref&gt;"Challenging the Status Quo", p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1963 campaign===

In 1963, the Mississippi party offered candidates for [[governor of Mississippi|governor]] and [[Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi|lieutenant governor]], both former Democrats. [[Rubel Phillips]], a former member of the [[Mississippi Public Service Commission]] from [[Corinth, Mississippi|Corinth]] and Jackson, and [[Stanford Morse]], a member of the [[Mississippi State Senate]] from [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], switched parties that year to challenge the elections of [[Paul B. Johnson, Jr.]] and [[Carroll Gartin]] for governor and lieutenant governors, respectively. Neither Phillips nor Morse reached 40 percent of the vote in the [[general election]], but they paved the way for later Republican candidates who in time won the majority of statewide offices in Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;"Challenging the Status Quo", pp. 242-243&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Phillips-Morse campaign, Yerger was frequently ridiculed as "Squirt" Yerger by the Democratic State Chairman [[Bidwell Adam]], a lawyer from Gulfport who served as lieutenant governor from 1928 to 1932 during the administration of staunch segregationist [[Theodore Bilbo]]. Adam and outgoing Governor [[Ross Barnett]] employed harsh anti-Republican rhetoric in their determined support for the Democrat Paul Johnson. The pair accused Phillips of being a Republican "turncoat" and then also questioned Phillips loyalty to the GOP. Johnson called his rival Phillips "a [[Adlai Stevenson II|Stevenson]] liberal in Republican outer-garments."&lt;ref&gt;"Challenging the Status Quo", p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; Adam accused Phillips and Morse of onitting the word "Republican" from campaign literature in a ploy to confuse voters.&lt;ref&gt;"Challenging the Status Quo", p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

An advertisement in the former ''Jackson Daily News'', now part of ''[[The Clarion-Ledger]]'', linked the Mississippi white Republicans with [[scalawags]] from the era of [[Reconstruction era in the United States|Reconstruction]], a term Yerger found offensive, as he is a great-grandson of a [[Confederate Army]] officer.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

With Phillips' defeat, which Bidwell Adam termed an "electrocution", the Democrat telegraphed his state chairman counterpart Yerger to ask: "Will you please advise the date and place you will deliver the [GOP] funeral oration?"&lt;ref&gt;"Challenging the Status Quo", pp. 256-257.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vacating the chairmanship===

Yerger stepped down as chairman with plans to challenge Democratic U.S. Senator [[James Eastland|James O. Eastland]] in the 1966 general election. In the Phillips-Johnson race, Yerger had accused Eastland of missing twenty-five of fifty-one roll call votes while Eastland was in Mississippi campaigning for Paul Johnson. Eastland said that his support of Johnson was essential to protect "white rule" in Mississippi. Democratic Chairman Bidwell Adam said that Eastland had a "patriotic duty" to support the state's Democratic nominees.&lt;ref name=eastland&gt;"Challenging the Status Quo", p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Prentiss Walker]], the Republican [[U.S. representative]] from [[Mize, Mississippi|Mize]], who represented [[Mississippi's 4th congressional district]] for a single term, instead ran against Eastland. Walker was the first Mississippi Republican since Reconstruction to win a U.S. House seat. Yerger therefore did not pursue an elected office but later said that Walker's senatorial candidacy was "very devastating" to the Mississippi GOP because the House seat returned to the Democrats and was held for decades by [[Gillespie V. Montgomery]] of [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]], who carried bipartisan support. Walker also polled barely a quarter of the vote against Eastland.&lt;ref name=eastland/&gt;

Yerger was succeeded as chairman by [[Clarke Reed]], a businessman from [[Greenville, Mississippi|Greenville]], who also served ten years in the post.

===The 1967 campaign===

In 1967, Phillips mounted his second unsuccessful race for governor, this time against [[U.S. Representative]] John Bell Williams of [[Mississippi's 3rd congressional district]], who had supported Goldwater in 1964 and been stripped in 1965 of House seniority for doing so. Sensing that he could not run to the "right" of Williams as he had tried to do with Johnson in 1963, Phillips shed his former segregationiost image and adopted a more moderate stance similar to that employed unsuccessfully by Williams' Democratic [[runoff election|runoff]] rival, state Treasurer and later Governor [[William Winter (politician)|William F. Winter]].&lt;ref&gt;"Challenging the Status Quo", p. 258-259.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==

In 2009, the central committee of the Mississippi [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] recognized Yerger's lifetime achievements by naming him "[[Emeritus|chairman emeritus]]."&lt;ref name=misspol&gt;Jere Nash and Andy Taggert. ''Mississippi Politics: The Struggle for Power, 1976-2006''. [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]]: [[University Press of Mississippi]], 2006. pp. 41-42&lt;/ref&gt; He is also chairman emeritus of Ross &amp; Yerger Insurance.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

In January 2010, his active political career long behind him, Yerger published with Joseph L. Maxwell, III, a lengthy memoir with even a long title, ''A Courageous Cause: A Personal Story of Modern Republicanism's Birth from 1956 to 1966 in Mississippi''.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|url=http://acouragouscause.blogspot.com/|title=''A Courageous Cause''|publisher=LifeStory Publishing, 509 pp. |isbn=978-0975898871|accessdate=May 10, 2014|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yerger was chosen as a presidential elector for Mississippi in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]] but did not cast a vote and was hence replaced by an alternate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/2012-certificates/pdfs/ascertainment-mississippi.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-03-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216232459/https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/2012-certificates/pdfs/ascertainment-mississippi.pdf# |archive-date=2017-02-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/2012-certificates/pdfs/vote-mississippi.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-03-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217174851/https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/2012-certificates/pdfs/vote-mississippi.pdf# |archive-date=2017-02-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All Mississippi electors voted for former [[governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[Mitt Romney]], who carried Mississippi over the Democratic incumbent [[Barack H. Obama]].

Four years later, Yerger served as a presidential elector for Mississippi in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], voting with the other Mississippi electors for [[Donald Trump]], who handily carried Mississippi over the Democratic nominee [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/2016-certificates/pdfs/vote-mississippi.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-03-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316025035/https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/2016-certificates/pdfs/vote-mississippi.pdf# |archive-date=2017-03-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
