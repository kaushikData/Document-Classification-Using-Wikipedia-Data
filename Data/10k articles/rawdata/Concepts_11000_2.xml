'''Abstractionism''' is the [[theory]] that the [[mind]] obtains some or all of its [[concept]]s by [[abstraction|abstracting]] them from concepts it already has, or from [[experience]].&lt;ref name="Geach1957"&gt;Geach, Peter (1957) Mental Acts - Their Contents and Their Objects. Routledge Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; One may, for example, abstract 'green' from a set of experiences which involve green along with other [[property (philosophy)|properties]]. Also, for example, one may abstract a generic concept like 'vegetable' from the already possessed concepts of its instances (carrot, broccoli, onion, etc.). This view was criticized by [[George Berkeley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_the_history_of_philosophy/summary/v024/24.4flage.html | title=Berkeley on Abstraction | journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy | year=1986 | volume=24 | issue=4 | pages=483–501 | doi=10.1353/hph.1986.0073 | last=Flage | first=Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Geach]].&lt;ref name="Geach1957"/&gt;

== Development ==
Abstractionism has its roots in [[Aristotle]]'s writings, particularly those rejecting the [[Plato|Platonic]] [[Theory of forms|theory of Forms]]. They were adopted and developed further by the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]] so that the doctrine became entrenched in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Berkeley's Philosophy of Mathematics|last=Jesseph|first=Douglas|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2010|isbn=0226398978|location=Chicago|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] also developed his own theory of abstract ideas although it was against the Scholastic theory of essences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Causality and Mind: Essays on Early Modern Philosophy|last=Jolley|first=Nicholas|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199669554|location=Oxford|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him, ideas originate through the senses and the materials or the sensory data provided by these become the basis of the way we form general ideas of classes of things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Philosophy of Human Learning|last=Winch|first=Christopher|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=0415161908|location=London|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theory contradicts the [[Empiricism|empiricist]] standpoint due to its focus on intuitive and demonstrative knowledge as demonstrated in Locke's recognition that pure mathematics and pure morals are founded on intuition and demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies in Phenomenology|last=Sinha|first=D|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|year=1969|isbn=9789024702664|location=The Hague|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several modern versions of abstractionism and these include those developed by theorists such as [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Jerry Fodor]], who proposed that concepts are preformed at birth and that we learn to match the words of our language onto the pre-existing concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy of Education: The Key Concepts|last=Gingell|first=John|last2=Winch|first2=Christopher|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=9780415428927|location=New York|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky, for instance, explained the "deep structure" of the [[Internet]] or the grammar of meaning hidden beneath the surface of words by citing that "linguists isolate from an essentially heterogeneous linguistic reality a standard and homogeneous system, thus grounding abstraction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Interlock: Art, Conspiracy, and the Shadow Worlds of Mark Lombardi|last=Goldstone|first=Patricia|publisher=Counterpoint|year=2015|isbn=9781619025653|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Berkeley's opposition to abstractionism is considered to be primarily directed at Locke's claim that words are made general through the mediation of general ideas. This is due to the view that Locke's argument is tantamount to claiming that the word "triangle" can be applied to many different triangles because the abstract general idea of the form is used as a template or standard when identifying new instances as being of the same sort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on the Philosophy of George Berkeley|last=Sosa|first=Ernest|publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company|year=2012|isbn=9789401086288|location=Dordrecht|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Advaita Vedanta''''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|d|ˈ|v|aɪ|t|ə|_|v|ɛ|ˈ|d|ɑː|n|t|ə}}; {{lang-sa|अद्वैत वेदान्त}}, [[IAST]]: ''{{IAST|Advaita Vedānta}}'', literally, "[[monism|not-two]]"), originally known as '''Puruṣavāda''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Timalsina|first1=Sthaneshwar(स्थानेश्वर)|title=Puruṣavāda: A Pre-Śaṅkara Monistic Philosophy as Critiqued by Mallavādin|journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy|date=November 2017|volume=45|issue=5|pages=939–959|url=https://www.academia.edu/34865811/Purusavada.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|pg. 941 "Puruṣavāda appears a preferred terminology in the early periods, before the time of Sankara." See also [[Purusha]].}} is a [[Sādhanā|school]] of [[Hindu philosophy]] and [[Hinduism#Practices|religious practice]], and one of the classic Indian paths to spiritual realization.{{sfn|Deutsch|1988|p=4, Quote: "Advaita Vedanta is more than a philosophical system, as we understand these terms in the West today; it is also a practical guide to spiritual experience and is intimately bound up with spiritual experience."}} The term ''Advaita'' refers to its idea that the soul (true Self, [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]) is the same as the highest metaphysical Reality ([[Brahman]]). The followers of this school are known as ''Advaita Vedantins'', or just ''Advaitins'',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sthaneshwar Timalsina|title=Consciousness in Indian Philosophy: The Advaita Doctrine of ‘Awareness Only’|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wO2SAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137| year=2008|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-1-135-97092-5|pages=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they seek [[Moksha|spiritual liberation]] through acquiring ''[[vidyā]]'', meaning knowledge,{{sfn|Kanamura|2004}} of one's true identity as ''Atman'', and the identity of ''Atman'' and ''Brahman''.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=183}}{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|pp=48-52}}{{Sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=78-79}}

Advaita Vedanta traces its roots in the oldest [[Upanishad]]s. It relies on three textual sources called the [[Prasthanatrayi]]. It gives "a unifying interpretation of the whole body of Upanishads",{{sfn|Nakamura|1950a|p=112}} the [[Brahma Sutras]], and the [[Bhagavad Gita]].{{sfn|Grimes|1990|pp=6–7}}&lt;ref name="menoniep"&gt;Sangeetha Menon (2012), [http://www.iep.utm.edu/adv-veda/ Advaita Vedanta], IEP&lt;/ref&gt; Advaita Vedanta is the oldest extant sub-school of [[Vedanta]],{{refn|group=note|Literally: ''end or the goal of the [[Vedas]]''.}} which is one of the six [[Āstika and nāstika|orthodox]] (''āstika'') Hindu philosophies ({{IAST|''darśana''}}). Although its roots trace back to the 1st millennium BCE, the most prominent exponent of the Advaita Vedanta is considered by the tradition to be 8th century scholar [[Adi Shankara]].{{Sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp=x-xi, 8-10, 17-18}}&lt;ref name="Stephen Phillips 1998 page 332"&gt;Stephen Phillips (1998), Classical Indian Metaphysics, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814899}}, page 332 note 68&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|pp=221, 680}}

Advaita Vedanta emphasizes ''[[Jivanmukti]]'', the idea that ''[[moksha]]'' (freedom, liberation) is achievable in this life in contrast to Indian philosophies that emphasize ''videhamukti'', or ''moksha'' after death.{{sfn|Sharma|2007|p=4}}{{sfn|Fort|1998|p=114-120}} The school uses concepts such as Brahman, Atman, [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]], [[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]], [[Dhyana in Hinduism|meditation]] and others that are found in major Indian religious traditions,&lt;ref name="menoniep"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirst2005p6"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacqueline G.

Advaita influenced and was influenced by various traditions and texts of Hindu philosophies such as [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], [[Nyaya]], other sub-schools of Vedanta, [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]], the [[Puranas]], the [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamas]], as well as social movements such as the [[Bhakti movement]].{{sfn|Novetzke|2007|pp=255-272}}{{sfn|Goodall|1996|p=xli}}{{sfn|Davis|2014|pp=13, 167 with note 21}} Beyond Hinduism, Advaita Vedanta interacted and developed with the other traditions of India such as [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]].{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=691}} Advaita Vedanta texts espouse a spectrum of views from idealism, including illusionism, to realist or nearly realist positions expressed in the early works of Shankara.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=68}} In modern times, its views appear in various [[Neo-Vedanta]] movements.{{sfn|King|2002|p=119-133}} It has been termed as the paradigmatic example of Hindu spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma|title=A Guide to Hindu Spirituality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYeAIM0d-KYC |year=2006|publisher=World Wisdom |isbn=978-1-933316-17-8|pages=38–43, 68–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard King|title=Orientalism and Religion: Post-Colonial Theory, India and "The Mystic East" |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eOiDNx_co5wC |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-63234-3|pages=128–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and nomenclature==
The Advaita Vedanta school has been historically referred to by various names, such as ''Advaita-vada'' (speaker of Advaita), ''Abheda-darshana'' (view of non-difference), ''Dvaita-vada-pratisedha'' (denial of dual distinctions), and ''Kevala-dvaita'' (non-dualism of the isolated).{{Sfn|King|1995|p=268 with note 2}}

According to Richard King, a professor of Buddhist and Asian studies, the term ''Advaita'' first occurs in a recognizably Vedantic context in the prose of [[Mandukya Upanishad]].{{Sfn|King|1995|p=268 with note 2}} In contrast, according to Frits Staal, a professor of Philosophy specializing in Sanskrit and Vedic studies, the word ''Advaita'' is from the Vedic era, and the Vedic sage [[Yajnavalkya]] (8th or 7th-century BCE&lt;ref name=benami9&gt;Ben-Ami Scharfstein (1998), ''A comparative history of world philosophy: from the Upanishads to Kant'', Albany: State University of New York Press, pp. 9-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=olivelle7thcen&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Olivelle|authorlink=Patrick Olivelle|title=Upaniṣads|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f9-2jV7sRuEC |year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-283576-5|page=xxxvi with footnote 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is credited to be the one who coined it.&lt;ref name="Staal2008p365"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frits Staal|title=Discovering the Vedas: Origins, Mantras, Rituals, Insights |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HcE23SjLX8sC&amp;pg=PA365 |year=2008| publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-309986-4|pages=365 note 159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Phillips, a professor of philosophy and Asian studies, translates the ''Advaita'' containing verse excerpt in ''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'', as follows:

==Darśana (philosophy) - central concerns==
{{See|Hindu philosophy}}

Advaita is a subschool of Vedanta, the latter being one of the six classical Hindu ''darśanas''. It, like nearly all these philosophies,{{refn|group=note|It is not a philosophy in the western meaning of the word, according to Milne.{{Sfn|Milne|1997|p=166}}}} has an integrated body of textual interpretations and religious practices for what Hinduism considers four proper aims of life: virtue (''[[dharma]]''), material prosperity (''[[artha]]''), desire (''[[kama]]'') and the fourth and final aim being ''[[moksha]]'', the spiritual liberation or release from cycles of rebirth ([[samsara]]).{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=73}}{{sfn|Klostermaier|2007|page=26}} Traditional Advaita Vedanta centers on the study of the ''sruti'' especially the Principal Upanishads, along with the [[Brahma Sutras]] and the [[Bhagavad Gita]].{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=34-37, 211}}{{sfn|Dalal|2009|p=16, 26-27}}

Within the Vedanta tradition of Hinduism are many sub-schools, of which Advaita is one. Unlike Buddhism, but like Jainism, all Vedanta schools consider the existence of Atman (real self, soul) as self-evident.&lt;ref name=johnplott3/&gt;&lt;ref name=7sources/&gt; The Vedanta tradition also posits the concept of [[Brahman]] as the eternal, unchanging metaphysical reality. The sub-schools of Vedanta disagree on the relation between ''Atman'' and ''Brahman''. The Advaita ''darsana'' considers them to be identical.{{sfn|Koller|2006}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=183}}{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|pp=48-52}}

Advaita Vedanta believes that the knowledge of one's true self or Atman is liberating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma|title=The Experiential Dimension of Advaita Vedanta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oV6GVSQF3SwC |year=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1058-7|page=27}}, quote: "According to Advaita, the pure subject is our true self whose knowledge is liberative, (...) If the subject could be realised in its purity then all misery would cease: this is called self-knowledge"&lt;/ref&gt; Along with self-knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma|title=The Experiential Dimension of Advaita Vedanta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oV6GVSQF3SwC&amp;pg=PA27 |year=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1058-7|pages=27, 72–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; it teaches that ''moksha'' can be achieved by the correct understanding of one's true identity as [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]], the dispassionate and unmoveable observer, and the identity of Ātman and [[Brahman]].{{sfn|Koller|2013|pp=100-102}}

The process of acquiring this knowledge entails realising that one’s True Self, the Atman, is essentially the same as Brahman. This is achieved through what Sankara refers to as ''anubhava'', immediate intuition. Sankara contends that this direct awareness is construction-free, and not construction-filled. Self-knowledge is, therefore, not seen as an awareness ''of Brahman'', but instead an awareness that ''is Brahman'', since one will transcend any form of duality in this state of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leesa S. Davis|title=Advaita Vedanta and Zen Buddhism: Deconstructive Modes of Spiritual Inquiry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_kHcG0tspgC&amp;pg=PA34 |year=2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-0-8264-2068-8|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Correct knowledge, which destroys ''avidya'', psychological and perceptual errors related to Atman and Brahman,&lt;ref name="SUNY Press"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Śaṅkarācārya|author2=Sengaku Mayeda|title=A Thousand Teachings: The Upadeśasāhasrī of Śaṅkara|year=2006|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-8120827714|pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; is obtained through three stages of practice, ''sravana'' (hearing), ''manana'' (thinking) and ''nididhyasana'' (meditation).{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=xvii}}

The Vedanta tradition of Hinduism rejects the dualism of Samkhya. The Samkhya school of Hindu thought proposes two metaphysical realities, namely [[Purusha]] (spirit) and [[Prakriti]] (inert primal matter), then states that Purusha is the efficient cause of all existence while Prakriti is its material cause.{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=19}} Advaita, like all Vedanta schools, states that Brahman is both the efficient and the material cause, "that from which the origination, subsistence, and dissolution of this universe proceed." What created all existence is also present in and reflected in all beings and inert matter, the creative principle was and is everywhere, always.{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|pp=18-20}} This Brahman it postulates is ''sat-cit-ananda'' (truth-consciousness-bliss). By accepting this postulation, various theoretical difficulties arise which Advaita and other Vedanta traditions offer different answers for:{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|pp=20-22}} first, how did ''sat'' Brahman without any distinction become manifold universe? second, how did ''cit'' Brahman create material world? third, if ''ananda'' Brahman is pure bliss, why did the empirical world of sufferings arise? These are the questions that Advaita Vedanta thinkers have historically attempted to answer, as did the non-Advaita schools of Hinduism.{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|pp=20-22}}

Advaita establishes its truths, in part, from the oldest [[Principal Upanishads]] (''sruti''), the [[Brahma Sutras]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and numerous other Hindu texts.&lt;ref name="menoniep"/&gt; Reason is used to support revelation, the ''sruti'', the ultimate source of truth.{{sfn|Koller|2006|p=xi-xii}} Reason clarifies the truth and removes objections, according to the Advaita school, however it believes that pure logic cannot lead to philosophical truths and only experience and meditative insights do. The ''Sruti'', it believes is a collection of experience and meditative insights about liberating knowledge.{{sfn|Koller|2006|p=xii}} The Advaita literature also provide a criticism of opposing systems, including the dualistic school of Hinduism, as well as non-Hindu philosophies such as Buddhism.{{sfn|Koller|2013|p=101}}

==Moksha – liberation through knowledge of Brahman==

===Puruṣārtha - the four goals of human life===
Advaita, like other schools, accepts Puruṣārtha - the four goals of human life as natural and proper:{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=8-9}}
* [[Dharma]]: the right way to life, the "duties and obligations of the individual toward himself and the society as well as those of the society toward the individual";{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=8}}
* [[Artha]]: the means to support and sustain one's life;
* [[Kāma]]: pleasure and enjoyment;
* [[Mokṣa]]: liberation, release.

Of these, much of the Advaita Vedanta philosophy focuses on the last, gaining liberation in one's current life.&lt;ref&gt;KN Tiwari (1998), Dimensions Of Renunciation In Advaita Vedanta, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120808256}}, pages 1-5 with footnote 3&lt;/ref&gt; The first three are discussed and encouraged by Advaitins, but usually in the context of knowing Brahman and Self-realization.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2008), Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Advaita Vedānta, Volume 3, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803107}}, pages 121-125, 128, 144-145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moksha - liberation===
{{See also|Jnana|Prajna (Vedic)|Mahāvākyas#Prajñānam Brahma|l1=Jnana|l2=Prajna|l3=Prajñānam Brahma}}

The soteriological goal, in Advaita, is to gain self-knowledge and complete understanding of the identity of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and [[Brahman]]. Correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman leads dissolution of all dualistic tendencies and to [[Moksha|liberation]],{{refn|group=note|Indian philosophy emphasises that "every acceptable philosophy should aid man in realising the [[Puruṣārtha|Purusarthas]], the chief aims of human life:{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=8-9}}
* [[Dharma]]: the right way to life, the "duties and obligations of the individual toward himself and the society as well as those of the society toward the individual";{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=8}}
* [[Artha]]: the means to support and sustain one's life;
* [[Kāma]]: pleasure and enjoyment;
* [[Mokṣa]]: liberation, release.}} Moksha is attained by realizing one's true identity as Ātman, and the identity of Atman and Brahman, the complete understanding of one's real nature as Brahman in this life.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=183}} This is stated by Shankara as follows:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
I am other than name, form and action.
My nature is ever free!
I am Self, the supreme unconditioned Brahman.
I am pure Awareness, always non-dual.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Adi Shankara, [[Upadesasahasri]] 11.7|{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=183}}}}

According to Advaita Vedanta, liberation can be achieved while living, and is called ''[[Jivanmukti]]''.{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|p=320}} The Atman-knowledge, that is the knowledge of true Self and its relationship to Brahman is central to this liberation in Advaita thought.{{refn|group=note|The true Self is itself just that pure consciousness, without which nothing can be known in any way.(...) And that same true Self, pure consciousness, is not different from the ultimate world Principle, Brahman&amp;nbsp; (...) Brahman (&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;the true Self, pure consciousness) is the only Reality (''sat''), since It is untinged by difference, the mark of ignorance, and since It is the one thing that is not sublimatable.{{sfn|Potter|2008|p=6-7}}}} Atman-knowledge, to Advaitins, is that state of full awareness, liberation and freedom which overcomes dualities at all levels, realizing the divine within oneself, the divine in others and all beings, the non-dual Oneness, that Brahman is in everything, and everything is Brahman.&lt;ref name=aramb/&gt;&lt;ref name=arvindsharmaintro/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fowler2002p30"/&gt;

According to Rambachan, in Advaita, this state of liberating self-knowledge includes and leads to the understanding that "the self is the self of all, the knower of self sees the self in all beings and all beings in the self."&lt;ref name="Rambachan2006p109"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anantanand Rambachan|title=The Advaita Worldview: God, World, and Humanity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ORPkAf3SZBQC&amp;pg=PA109 |year=2006|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-6851-7|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jivanmukta====
In Advaita Vedanta, the interest is not in liberation in after life, but in one's current life.{{sfn|Comans|2000|pp=183-184}} This school holds that liberation can be achieved while living, and a person who achieves this is called a ''[[Jivanmukta]]''.{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|p=320}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], [[:iarchive:philosophyupani00deusgoog|The philosophy of the Upanishads]], Translated by A.S. Geden (1906), T&amp;T Clark, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''Jivanmukti'' of Advaita Vedanta contrasts with ''Videhamukti'' (moksha from samsara after death) in theistic sub-schools of Vedanta.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Vol 1 &amp; 2, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1467-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jivanmukti is a state that transforms the nature, attributes and behaviors of an individual, after which the liberated individual shows attributes such as:&lt;ref&gt;'''[a]''' K.N. Aiyar (Transl. 1914), [[:iarchive:thirtyminorupani00xxxxuoft|Thirty Minor Upanishads]], University of Toronto Robart Library Archives, Canada, pp 140-147; '''[b]''' S.

* he is not bothered by disrespect and endures cruel words, treats others with respect regardless of how others treat him;
* when confronted by an angry person he does not return anger, instead replies with soft and kind words;
* even if tortured, he speaks and trusts the truth;
* he does not crave for blessings or expect praise from others;
* he never injures or harms any life or being (ahimsa), he is intent in the welfare of all beings;
* he is as comfortable being alone as in the presence of others;
* he is as comfortable with a bowl, at the foot of a tree in tattered robe without help, as when he is in a mithuna (union of mendicants), grama (village) and nagara (city);
* he doesn’t care about or wear sikha (tuft of hair on the back of head for religious reasons), nor the holy thread across his body. To him, knowledge is sikha, knowledge is the holy thread, knowledge alone is supreme. Outer appearances and rituals do not matter to him, only knowledge matters;
* for him there is no invocation nor dismissal of deities, no mantra nor non-mantra, no prostrations nor worship of gods, goddess or ancestors, nothing other than knowledge of Self;
* he is humble, high spirited, of clear and steady mind, straightforward, compassionate, patient, indifferent, courageous, speaks firmly and with sweet words.

===Vidya, Svādhyāya and Anubhava===
{{main|Svādhyāya}}

''Sruti'' (scriptures), proper reasoning and meditation are the main sources of knowledge (''vidya'') for the Advaita Vedanta tradition.{{sfn|Rambachan|1984}}{{sfn|Dalal|2009|p=22}}{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=xvii}} It teaches that correct knowledge of Atman and Brahman is achievable by ''[[svādhyāya]]'',{{sfn|Sivananda|1977|p=viii}} study of the self and of the Vedic texts, and three stages of practice: ''sravana'' (perception, hearing), ''manana'' (thinking) and ''nididhyasana'' (meditation),{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=xvii}} a three-step methodology that is rooted in the teachings of chapter 4 of the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]''.&lt;ref name="RaoParanjpe2015p6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="John A. Grimes 1996 98–99"&gt;{{cite book|author=John A.

''Sravana'' literally means hearing, and broadly refers to perception and observations typically aided by a counsellor or teacher ([[guru]]),{{Sfn| Deutsch|1973|pp=106-110}} wherein the Advaitin listens and discusses the ideas, concepts, questions and answers.{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=xvii}}&lt;ref name="RaoParanjpe2015p6"/&gt; ''Manana'' refers to thinking on these discussions and contemplating over the various ideas based on ''svadhyaya'' and ''sravana''.&lt;ref name="RaoParanjpe2015p6"&gt;{{cite book|author1=K. Ramakrishna Rao|author2=Anand C.

Bilimoria|title=Śabdapramāṇa: Word and Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arvrCAAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-009-2911-1|pages=299–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn| Deutsch|1973|pp=106-110}}

Adi Shankara uses ''anubhava'' interchangeably with ''pratipatta'', "understanding".{{sfn|Hirst|2005|p=68}} Dalal and others state that ''anubhava'' does not center around some sort of "mystical experience," but around the correct knowledge of Brahman.{{sfn|Dalal|2009|p=22}}{{sfn|Rambachan|1991|p=1-14}} Nikhalananda states that (knowledge of) ''Atman'' and ''Brahman'' can only be reached by ''[[buddhi]]'', "reason,"{{sfn|Nikhalananda|1931|p=viii}} stating that mysticism is a kind of intuitive knowledge, while ''buddhi'' is the highest means of attaining knowledge.{{sfn|Nikhalananda|1931|p=viii-ix}}

===Mahavakya – The Great Sentences===
{{Main|Mahāvākyas}}

Several ''Mahavakyas'', or "the great sentences", have Advaitic theme, that is "the inner immortal self and the great cosmic power are one and the same".{{sfn|Braue|1984|p=81}}

===Stages and practices===
Advaita Vedanta entails more than self-inquiry or bare insight into one's real nature,{{refn|group=note|Puligandla: "Any philosophy worthy of its title should not be a mere intellectual exercise but should have practical application in enabling man to live an enlightened life. A philosophy which makes no difference to the quality and style of our life is no philosophy, but an empty intellectual construction."{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=11}}}} but also includes self-restraint, textual studies and ethical perfection. It is described in classical Advaita books like Shankara's [[Upadesasahasri]]{{sfn|Mayeda|2006}} and the [[Vivekachudamani]], which is also attributed to Shankara.

====Jnana Yoga – path of practice====
{{Main|Jnana Yoga}}

Classical Advaita Vedanta emphasises the path of Jnana Yoga, a progression of study and training to attain [[moksha]].{{sfn|Deutsch|1988|pp=104-105}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|pp=125-142}} It consists of fourfold qualities,&lt;ref name=maharaj82/&gt; or behavioral qualifications (''Samanyasa'', ''Sampattis'', ''sādhana-catustaya''):{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=251-254}}&lt;ref name=davis38&gt;{{cite book|author=Leesa S.

Correct knowledge, which destroys ''avidya'', psychological and perceptual errors related to Atman and Brahman,&lt;ref name="SUNY Press"/&gt; is obtained in ''jnanayoga'' through three stages of practice,&lt;ref name=davis38/&gt; ''sravana'' (hearing), ''manana'' (thinking) and ''nididhyasana'' (meditation).{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=xvii}} This three-step methodology is rooted in the teachings of chapter 4 of the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'':&lt;ref name="RaoParanjpe2015p6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="John A.

====Samadhi====
While Shankara emphasized [[Shravana (hearing)|sravana]] ("hearing"), [[Manana (reflection)|manana]] ("reflection") and [[nididhyasana]] ("repeated meditation"), later texts like the ''[[Dŗg-Dŗśya-Viveka]]'' (14th century) and ''[[Vedantasara (of Sadananda)]]'' (15th century) added [[samadhi]] as a means to liberation, a theme that was also emphasized by Swami Vivekananda.

====Guru====
{{Main|Guru}}

Advaita Vedanta school has traditionally had a high reverence for Guru (teacher), and recommends that a competent Guru be sought in one's pursuit of spirituality. However, the Guru is not mandatory in Advaita school, states Clooney, but reading of Vedic literature and followed by reflection is.{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=182}} Adi Shankara, states Comans, regularly employed compound words "such as ''Sastracaryopadesa'' (instruction by way of the scriptures and the teacher) and ''Vedantacaryopadesa'' (instruction by way of the Upanishads and the teacher) to emphasize the importance of Guru".{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=182}} This reflects the Advaita tradition which holds a competent teacher as important and essential to gaining correct knowledge, freeing oneself from false knowledge, and to self-realization.{{sfn|Comans|2000|pp=182-183}}

A guru is someone more than a teacher, traditionally a reverential figure to the student, with the ''guru'' serving as a "counselor, who helps mold values, shares experiential knowledge as much as literal knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who helps in the spiritual evolution of a student.&lt;ref name=joelmlecko33&gt;Joel Mlecko (1982), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3269931 The Guru in Hindu Tradition] Numen, Volume 29, Fasc. 1, pages 33-61&lt;/ref&gt; The guru, states Joel Mlecko, is more than someone who teaches specific type of knowledge, and includes in its scope someone who is also a "counselor, a sort of parent of mind and soul, who helps mold values and experiential knowledge as much as specific knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who reveals the meaning of life."&lt;ref name=joelmlecko33/&gt;

==Ontology - the nature of Being==
{{See also|Metaphysics|Ontology}}

[[File:SwansCygnus olor.jpg|right|thumb|The swan is an important motif in Advaita. It symbolises two things: first, the swan is called ''hamsah'' in Sanskrit (which becomes ''hamso'' if the first letter in the next word is /h/). Upon repeating this ''hamso'' indefinitely, it becomes ''so-aham'', meaning, "I am That". Second, just as a swan lives in a lake but its feathers are not soiled by water, similarly a liberated Advaitin lives in this world but is not soiled by its [[Maya (illusion)|maya]].]]

===Levels of Reality, Truths===
{{See also|Two truths doctrine}}
The classical Advaita Vedanta explains all reality and everything in the experienced world to be same as the Brahman.&lt;ref name="menoniep"/&gt; To Advaitins, there is a unity in multiplicity, and there is no dual hierarchy of a Creator and the created universe.&lt;ref name="menoniep"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma|title=The Philosophy of Religion and Advaita Vedanta: A Comparative Study in Religion and Reason |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QxSrc6rkvzAC |year=2008|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=978-0-271-03946-6|pages=5–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; All objects, all experiences, all matter, all consciousness, all awareness, in Advaita philosophy is not the property but the very nature of this one fundamental reality Brahman.&lt;ref name="menoniep"/&gt; With this premise, the Advaita school states that any ontological effort must presuppose a knowing self, and this effort needs to explain all empirical experiences such as the projected reality while one dreams during sleep, and the observed multiplicity of living beings.

Shankara proposes three levels of reality, using sublation as the ontological criterion:{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}{{sfn|Sharma|1995|pp=174-178}}{{sfn|Fowler|2002|pp=246-247}}
* ''{{IAST|Pāramārthika}}'' (''paramartha'', absolute), the Reality that is metaphysically true and ontologically accurate. It is the state of experiencing that "which is absolutely real and into which both other reality levels can be resolved". This reality is the highest, it can't be sublated (assimilated) by any other.{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=232}}{{sfn|Sharma|1995|pp=176-178}}
* ''{{IAST|Vyāvahārika}}'' (''vyavahara''), or ''samvriti-saya'',{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=131}} consisting of the empirical or pragmatical reality. It is ever changing over time, thus empirically true at a given time and context but not [[metaphysics|metaphysically]] true. It is "our world of experience, the phenomenal world that we handle every day when we are awake". It is the level in which both ''[[jiva]]'' (living creatures or individual souls) and ''[[Iswara]]'' are true; here, the material world is also true but this is incomplete reality and is sublatable.{{sfn|Sharma|1995|pp=176-178}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bradley J.

Advaita Vedanta acknowledges and admits that from the empirical perspective there are numerous distinctions.&lt;ref name="Grimes2004p31"/&gt; It states that everything and each reality has multiple perspectives, both absolute and relative. All these are valid and true in their respective contexts, states Advaita, but only from their respective particular perspectives. This "absolute and relative truths" explanation, Advaitins call as the "two truths" doctrine.{{sfn|Hugh Nicholson|2011|pp=171–172, 191}}&lt;ref name="Grimes2004p31"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=T.R.V.

From the perspective of a person on earth, sun does rise and set, there is both light and darkness, not "all is light", there are relative shades of light and darkness. Both are valid realities and truths, given their perspectives. Yet, they are contradictory. What is true from one point of view, states Grimes, is not from another.

===Three states of consciousness and Turiya===
{{See also|Three Bodies Doctrine (Vedanta)|Kosha}}

Advaita posits three states of consciousness, namely waking (jagrat), dreaming (svapna), deep sleep (suṣupti), which are empirically experienced by human beings,&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Sharma (2004), ''Sleep as a State of Consciousness in Advaita Vedånta'', State University of New York Press, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Indich (2000), Consciousness in Advaita Vedanta, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812512}}, pages 57-60&lt;/ref&gt; and correspond to the [[Three Bodies Doctrine (Vedanta)|Three Bodies Doctrine]]:{{sfn|Wilber|2000|p=132}}
# The first state is the waking state, in which we are aware of our daily world.&lt;ref name=asharmasleep15&gt;Arvind Sharma (2004), ''Sleep as a State of Consciousness in Advaita Vedånta'', State University of New York Press, pages 15-40, 49-72&lt;/ref&gt; This is the gross body.
# The second state is the dreaming mind. This is the [[subtle body]].&lt;ref name=asharmasleep15/&gt;
# The third state is the state of deep sleep. This is the [[causal body]].&lt;ref name=asharmasleep15/&gt;

Advaita also posits the fourth state of [[Turiya]], which some describe as pure consciousness, the background that underlies and transcends these three common states of consciousness.&lt;ref group=web name=rm&gt;[http://bhagavan-ramana.org/ramana_maharshi/books/tw/tw617.html  {{cite book|author=Ramana Maharshi|title=States of Consciousness}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web name=sc1&gt;[http://www.yogaofsrichinmoy.com/yoga/summits_of_god-life {{cite book|author=Sri Chinmoy|title=Summits of God-Life}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Turiya is the state of liberation, where states Advaita school, one experiences the infinite (''ananta'') and non-different (''advaita/abheda''), that is free from the dualistic experience, the state in which [[ajativada]], non-origination, is apprehended.{{sfn|King|1995|p=300 note 140}} According to Candradhara Sarma, Turiya state is where the foundational Self is realized, it is measureless, neither cause nor effect, all prevading, without suffering, blissful, changeless, self-luminous, real, immanent in all things and transcendent.{{sfn|Sarma|1996|pp=122, 137}} Those who have experienced the Turiya stage of self-consciousness have reached the pure awareness of their own non-dual Self as one with everyone and everything, for them the knowledge, the knower, the known becomes one, they are the ''Jivanmukta''.{{sfn|Sarma|1996|pp=126, 146}}{{Sfn|Comans|2000|pp=128-131, 5-8, 30-37}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Indich|2000|pp=106–108}};&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce M.

====Identity of Atman and Brahman====
According to Advaita Vedanta, Atman is identical to Brahman.{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=12}}{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=49}} This is expressed in the ''mahavakya'' "''tat tvam asi''", "thou are that." There is "a common ground, viz. consciousness, to the individual and Brahman."{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=49}} Each soul, in Advaita view, is non-different from the infinite.{{sfn|Potter|2008a|p=510-512}} According to Shankara, Atman and Brahman seem different at the empirical level of reality, but this difference is only an illusion, and at the highest level of reality they are really identical.{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=14}}

Moksha is attained by realizing the identity of Atman and Brahman, the complete understanding of one's real nature as Brahman in this life.{{sfn|Comans |2000 |p=183 }} This is frequently stated by Advaita scholars, such as Shankara, as:

{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
I am other than name, form and action.
My nature is ever free!
I am Self, the supreme unconditioned Brahman.
I am pure Awareness, always non-dual.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Adi Shankara, [[Upadesasahasri]] 11.7|{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=183}}}}

===Empirical reality - illusion and ignorance===
According to Advaita Vedanta, Brahman is the sole reality. The status of the phenomenal world is an important question in Advaita Vedanta, and different solutions have been proposed. The perception of the phenomenal world as real is explained by ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'' (constantly changing reality) and ''avidya'' ("ignorance"). Other than ''Brahman'', everything else, including the universe, material objects and individuals, are ever-changing and therefore [[maya (illusion)|maya]]. Brahman is ''Paramarthika Satyam'', "Absolute Truth",{{sfn|Venkatramaiah|2000|p=xxxii}} and "the true Self, pure consciousness, the only Reality (''sat''), since It is untinged by difference, the mark of ignorance, and since It is the one thing that is not sublatable".{{sfn|Potter|2008|p=6-7}}

====Causality====
{{Main|Cause and effect in Advaita Vedanta}}

All schools of Vedanta subscribe to the theory of ''[[Satkaryavada|Satkāryavāda]]'',&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/bhed-ved/#H3 Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''Bhedābheda Vedānta'']&lt;/ref&gt; which means that the effect is pre-existent in the cause. But there are different views on the causal relationship and the nature of the empirical world from the perspective of metaphysical Brahman. The ''Brahma Sutras'', the ancient Vedantins, most sub-schools of Vedanta,{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=27}}&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/bhed-ved/#H3 Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''Bhedābheda Vedānta'']&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy,&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda" /&gt; support ''[[Parinama-vada (Hindu thought)|Parinamavada]]'', the idea that the world is a real transformation (''parinama'') of Brahman.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=27}}

Scholars disagree on the whether Adi Shankara and his Advaita system explained causality through ''vivarta''.&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda"/&gt;{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=27}}{{Sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=25-27}} According to Andrew Nicholson, instead of ''parinama-vada'', the competing causality theory is ''[[Vivartavada]]'', which says "the world, is merely an unreal manifestation (''vivarta'') of Brahman. Vivartavada states that although Brahman appears to undergo a transformation, in fact no real change takes place. The myriad of beings are unreal manifestation, as the only real being is Brahman, that ultimate reality which is unborn, unchanging, and entirely without parts". The advocates of this illusive, unreal transformation based causality theory, states Nicholson, have been the Advaitins, the followers of Shankara.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=27}} "Although the world can be described as conventionally real", adds Nicholson, "the Advaitins claim that all of Brahman’s effects must ultimately be acknowledged as unreal before the individual self can be liberated".&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda"/&gt;

However, other scholars such as Hajime Nakamura and Paul Hacker disagree. Hacker and others state that Adi Shankara did not advocate ''Vivartavada'', and his explanations are "remote from any connotation of illusion". According to these scholars, it was the 13th century scholar Prakasatman who gave a definition to ''Vivarta'', and it is Prakasatman's theory that is sometimes misunderstood as Adi Shankara's position.{{Sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=25-27}}{{refn|group=note|According to Hugh Nicholson, "the definitive study on the development of the concept of ''vivarta'' in Indian philosophy, and in Advaita Vedanta in particular, remains Hacker's ''Vivarta''.{{sfn|Hugh Nicholson|2011|p=266 note 20, 167-170}} To Shankara, the word ''maya'' has hardly any terminological weight.{{sfn|Hugh Nicholson|2011|p=266 note 21}}}} Andrew Nicholson concurs with Hacker and other scholars, adding that the ''vivarta-vada'' isn't Shankara's theory, that Shankara's ideas appear closer to ''parinama-vada'', and the ''vivarta'' explanation likely emerged gradually in Advaita subschool later.&lt;ref group=web name="IEPBheda"/&gt;

According to Eliot Deutsch, Advaita Vedanta states that from "the standpoint of Brahman-experience and Brahman itself, there is no creation" in the absolute sense, all empirically observed creation is relative and mere transformation of one state into another, all states are provisional and a cause-effect driven modification.{{Sfn|Deutsch|1973|pp=40-43}}

====''{{IAST|Māyā}}'' (illusion)====
{{Main|Maya (illusion)}}

The doctrine of Maya is used to explain the empirical reality in Advaita.&lt;ref&gt;S. Radhakrishnan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2376777 The Vedanta Philosophy and the Doctrine of Maya], International Journal of Ethics, Vol. 24, No. 4 (Jul., 1914), pages 431-451&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|and other sub-schools of Vedanta with the concept of Maya.&lt;ref&gt;PD Shastri, [https://archive.org/details/thedoctrineofmaa00shaauoft The Doctrine of Maya] Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;}} Jiva, when conditioned by the human mind, is subjected to experiences of a subjective nature, states Vedanta school, which leads it to misunderstand Maya and interpret it as the sole and final reality. Advaitins assert that the perceived world, including people and other existence, is not what it appears to be".&lt;ref&gt;HM Vroom (1989), Religions and the Truth: Philosophical Reflections and Perspectives, Eerdmans Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0802805027}}, pages 122-123&lt;/ref&gt; It is Māyā, they assert, which manifests and perpetuates a sense of false [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|duality]] or divisional plurality.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic F Fost (1998), Playful Illusion: The Making of Worlds in Advaita Vedānta, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 48, No. 3, pages 388, 397 and note 11&lt;/ref&gt; The empirical manifestation is real but changing, but it obfuscates the true nature of metaphysical Reality which is never changing. Advaita school holds that liberation is the unfettered realization and understanding of the unchanging Reality and truths – the Self, that the Self (Soul) in oneself is same as the Self in another and the Self in everything (Brahman).&lt;ref&gt;PD Shastri, [https://archive.org/details/thedoctrineofmaa00shaauoft The Doctrine of Maya] Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 58-73&lt;/ref&gt;

In Advaita Vedanta philosophy, there are two realities: ''Vyavaharika'' (empirical reality) and ''Paramarthika'' (absolute, spiritual Reality).&lt;ref name=fredfost&gt;Frederic F. Fost (1998), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1400333 Playful Illusion: The Making of Worlds in Advaita Vedānta], Philosophy East and West, Vol. 48, No. 3 (Jul., 1998), pages 387-405&lt;/ref&gt; Māyā is the empirical reality that entangles consciousness. Māyā has the power to create a bondage to the empirical world, preventing the unveiling of the true, unitary Self—the Cosmic Spirit also known as [[Brahman]]. This theory of māyā was expounded and explained by [[Adi Shankara]]. Competing theistic Dvaita scholars contested Shankara's theory,&lt;ref&gt;Surendranath Dasgupta, ''A History of Indian Philosophy.'' Cambridge University Press Archive, 1955, page 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that Shankara did not offer a theory of the relationship between Brahman and Māyā.&lt;ref&gt;Pratima Bowes, "Mysticism in the Upanishads and Shankara's Vedanta" in Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic." Routledge, 1995, page 67.&lt;/ref&gt; A later Advaita scholar Prakasatman addressed this, by explaining, "Maya and Brahman together constitute the entire universe, just like two kinds of interwoven threads create a fabric. Maya is the manifestation of the world, whereas Brahman, which supports Maya, is the cause of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Esther Abraham Solomon (1969), Avidyā: A Problem of Truth and Reality, {{oclc|658823}}, pages 269-270&lt;/ref&gt;

Brahman is the sole metaphysical truth in Advaita Vedanta, Māyā is true in epistemological and empirical sense; however, Māyā is not the metaphysical and spiritual truth. The spiritual truth is the truth forever, while what is empirical truth is only true for now. Complete knowledge of true Reality includes knowing both ''Vyavaharika'' (empirical) and ''Paramarthika'' (spiritual), the Māyā and the Brahman. The goal of spiritual enlightenment, state Advaitins, is to realize Brahman, realize the unity and Oneness of all reality.&lt;ref name=fredfost/&gt;{{sfn|Sharma|2007|pp=19-40, 53-58, 79-86}}&lt;ref name="Fowler2002p30"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeaneane D. Fowler|title=Perspectives of Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRlB4v85S1EC |year=2002|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-94-3|pages=30–31, 260–264}}, Quote: (p. 30) – "As a philosophical and metaphysical term it [monism] refers to the acceptance of one single, ultimate, principle as the basis of the cosmos, the unity and oneness of all reality (...) [monism] has a model par excellence in that put forward by the eighth-century Indian philosopher Shankara, who is associated with the school of thought of Advaita Vedanta. (p. 263) – "In Shankara's words: 'the notions oneself and one's own are indeed falsely constructed (upon Atman) through nescience. When there is (the knowledge of) the oneness of Atman, these notions certainly do not exist. If the seed does not exist, whence shall the fruit arise?".&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Avidya'' (ignorance)====
Due to ignorance ({{IAST|avidyā}}), Brahman is perceived as the material world and its objects (nama rupa vikara). According to Shankara, Brahman is in reality [[Nirguna Brahman|attributeless and formless]]. Brahman, the highest truth and all (Reality), does not really change; it is only our ignorance that gives the appearance of change. Also due to {{IAST|avidyā}}, the true identity is forgotten, and material reality, which manifests at various levels, is mistaken as the only and true reality.

The notion of avidyā and its relationship to Brahman creates a crucial philosophical issue within Advaita Vedanta thought: how can avidyā appear in Brahman, since Brahman is pure consciousness?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Stephen|title=Vidyā and Avidyā: Simultaneous and Coterminous?: A Holographic Model to Illuminate the Advaita Debate|journal=Philosophy East and West |date=April 2007 |volume=57 |issue=2|series=2 |pages=178–203 |jstor=4488090 |doi=10.1353/pew.2007.0019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sengaku Mayeda writes, in his commentary and translation of [[Adi Shankara]]'s Upadesasahasri:
{{quote|Certainly the most crucial problem which Sankara left for his followers is that of avidyā. If the concept is logically analysed, it would lead the Vedanta philosophy toward dualism or nihilism and uproot its fundamental position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayeda|first=Sengaku|title=A Thousand Teachings: The Upadesasahasri of Sankara|year=1992|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To Advaitins, human beings, in a state of unawareness and ignorance of this Universal Self, see their "I-ness" as different than the being in others, then act out of impulse, fears, cravings, malice, division, confusion, anxiety, passions, and a sense of distinctiveness.&lt;ref name="Adi Sankara pages 173-214"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Rambachan (2006), The Advaita Worldview: God, World, and Humanity, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791468524}}, pages 114-122&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent Advaitins gave somewhat various explanations, from which various Advaita schools arose.

==Epistemology - ways of knowing==
{{See also|Pramana|Epistemology}}

The ancient and medieval texts of Advaita Vedanta and other schools of Hindu philosophy discuss '' Pramana'' ([[epistemology]]). The theory of Pramana discusses questions like how correct knowledge can be acquired; how one knows, how one doesn't; and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired.&lt;ref name=kp&gt;Karl Potter (2002), Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0779-0}}, pages 25-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dpsb&gt;DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology (Editor: Anthony Marsella), Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-8109-7}}, page 172&lt;/ref&gt; Advaita Vedānta,{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=228}} accepts the following six kinds of {{IAST|pramāṇas}}:{{sfn|Grimes|1996|p=238}}{{sfn|Datta|1932|pp=221-253}}
# ''Pratyakṣa'' (प्रत्यक्षाय) - perception
# ''Anumāṇa'' (अनुमान) - inference
# ''Upamāṇa'' (उपमान) - comparison, analogy
# ''Arthāpatti'' (अर्थापत्ति) - postulation, derivation from circumstances&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gflood/&gt;
# ''Anupalabdi'' (अनुपलब्धि) - non-perception, negative/cognitive proof&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt;
# ''Śabda'' (शब्द) - relying on word, testimony of past or present reliable experts&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt;

===''Pratyakṣa'' (perception)===
''Pratyakṣa'' (प्रत्यक्षाय), perception, is of two types: external - that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, and internal - perception of inner sense, the mind.&lt;ref&gt;B Matilal (1992), Perception: An Essay in Indian Theories of Knowledge, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0198239765}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advaita postulates four pre-requisites for correct perception: 1) ''Indriyarthasannikarsa'' (direct experience by one's sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), 2) ''Avyapadesya'' (non-verbal; correct perception is not through [[hearsay]], according to ancient Indian scholars, where one's sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else's perception), 3) ''Avyabhicara'' (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one's sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and 4) ''Vyavasayatmaka'' (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one's failure to observe all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one does not want to observe).&lt;ref name=kpmat&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 160-168&lt;/ref&gt; The internal perception concepts included ''pratibha'' (intuition), ''samanyalaksanapratyaksa'' (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and ''jnanalaksanapratyaksa'' (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a 'topic of study' by observing its current state).&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0309-4}}, pages 168-169&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Anumāṇa'' (inference)===
''Anumāṇa'' (अनुमान), inference, is defined as applying reason to reach a new conclusion about truth from one or more observations and previous understanding of truths.&lt;ref&gt;W Halbfass (1991), Tradition and Reflection, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0362-9}}, page 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of ''Anumana''. This epistemological method for gaining knowledge consists of three parts: 1) ''Pratijna'' (hypothesis), 2) ''Hetu'' (a reason), and 3) ''drshtanta'' (examples).&lt;ref name=jl4647&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Anumana" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis must further be broken down into two parts: 1) ''Sadhya'' (that idea which needs to proven or disproven) and 2) ''Paksha'' (the object on which the ''Sadhya'' is predicated). The inference is conditionally true if ''Sapaksha'' (positive examples as evidence) are present, and if ''Vipaksha'' (negative examples as counter-evidence) are absent. For rigor, the Indian philosophies further demand ''Vyapti'' - the requirement that the ''hetu'' (reason) must necessarily and separately account for the inference in "all" cases, in both ''sapaksha'' and ''vipaksha''.&lt;ref name=jl4647/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2002), Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0779-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conditionally proven hypothesis is called a ''nigamana'' (conclusion).&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom - Religious, Philosophical and Ethical Doctrines of the Hindus, Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 61&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Upamāṇa'' (comparison, analogy)===
''Upamāṇa'' (उपमान), comparison, analogy.&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gflood&gt;[[Gavin Flood]], An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521438780}}, page 225&lt;/ref&gt; Some Hindu schools consider it as a proper means of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;VN Jha (1986), "The upamana-pramana in Purvamimamsa", SILLE, pages 77-91&lt;/ref&gt; ''Upamana'', states Lochtefeld,&lt;ref name=jl721/&gt; may be explained with the example of a traveler who has never visited lands or islands with endemic population of wildlife. He or she is told, by someone who has been there, that in those lands you see an animal that sort of looks like a cow, grazes like cow but is different from a cow in such and such way. Such use of analogy and comparison is, state the Indian epistemologists, a valid means of conditional knowledge, as it helps the traveller identify the new animal later.&lt;ref name=jl721&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Upamana" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 721&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of comparison is formally called ''upameyam'', the object of comparison is called ''upamanam'', while the attribute(s) are identified as ''samanya''.&lt;ref name=mw457&gt;Monier Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom - Religious, Philosophical and Ethical Doctrines of the Hindus, Luzac &amp; Co, London, pages 457-458&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Arthāpatti'' (postulation)===
''Arthāpatti'' (अर्थापत्ति), postulation, derivation from circumstances.&lt;ref name=dpsb/&gt;&lt;ref name=gflood/&gt; In contemporary logic, this ''pramana'' is similar to circumstantial [[Modus ponens|implication]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/36920/arthapatti Arthapatti] Encyclopædia Britannica (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; As example, if a person left in a boat on river earlier, and the time is now past the expected time of arrival, then the circumstances support the truth postulate that the person has arrived. Many Indian scholars considered this ''Pramana'' as invalid or at best weak, because the boat may have gotten delayed or diverted.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Arthapatti" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 55&lt;/ref&gt; However, in cases such as deriving the time of a future sunrise or sunset, this method was asserted by the proponents to be reliable.

===''Anupalabdi'' (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof)===
''Anupalabdi'' (अनुपलब्धि), non-perception, negative/cognitive proof.&lt;ref name=eliottjag/&gt; ''Anupalabdhi pramana'' suggests that knowing a negative, such as "there is no jug in this room" is a form of valid knowledge. If something can be observed or inferred or proven as non-existent or impossible, then one knows more than what one did without such means.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Abhava" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; In Advaita school of Hindu philosophy, a valid conclusion is either ''sadrupa'' (positive) or ''asadrupa'' (negative) relation - both correct and valuable. Like other ''pramana'', Indian scholars refined ''Anupalabdi'' to four types: non-perception of the cause, non-perception of the effect, non-perception of object, and non-perception of contradiction. Only two schools of Hinduism accepted and developed the concept "non-perception" as a ''pramana''. Advaita considers this method as valid and useful when the other five ''pramanas'' fail in one's pursuit of knowledge and truth.{{sfn|Datta|1932|pp=221-253}}&lt;ref name=ds/&gt; A variation of ''Anupaladbi'', called Abhava (अभाव) has also been posited as an epistemic method.

==Ethics==
Some claim, states Deutsch, "that Advaita turns its back on all theoretical and practical considerations of morality and, if not unethical, is at least 'a-ethical' in character".{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=99}} However, adds Deutsch, ethics ''does'' have a firm place in this philosophy. Its ideology is permeated with ethics and value questions enter into every metaphysical and epistemological analysis, and it considers "an independent, separate treatment of ethics are unnecessary".{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=99}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bauer | first=Nancy F. | title=Advaita Vedanta and Contemporary Western Ethics | journal=Philosophy East and West | publisher=University of Hawaii Press | volume=37 | issue=1 | year=1987 | pages=36–50 | doi=10.2307/1399082 | jstor=1399082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Advaita Vedanta, states Deutsch, there cannot be "any absolute moral laws, principles or duties", instead in its axiological view Atman is "beyond good and evil", and all values result from self-knowledge of the reality of "distinctionless Oneness" of one's real self, every other being and all manifestations of Brahman.{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=100}} Advaitin ethics includes lack of craving, lack of dual distinctions between one's own soul and another being's, good and just [[Karma]].{{sfn|Deutsch|1973|p=101-102 with footnotes}}

The values and ethics in Advaita Vedanta emanate from what it views as inherent in the state of liberating self-knowledge. This state, according to Rambachan, includes and leads to the understanding that "the self is the self of all, the knower of self sees the self in all beings and all beings in the self."&lt;ref name="Rambachan2006p109"/&gt; Such knowledge and understanding of the indivisibility of one's and other's Atman, Advaitins believe leads to "a deeper identity and affinity with all". It does not alienate or separate an Advaitin from his or her community, rather awakens "the truth of life's unity and interrelatedness".&lt;ref name="Rambachan2006p109"/&gt; These ideas are exemplified in the [[Isha Upanishad]] – a ''sruti'' for Advaita, as follows:

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
One who sees all beings in the self alone, and the self of all beings,
feels no hatred by virtue of that understanding.
For the seer of oneness, who knows all beings to be the self,
where is delusion and sorrow?
&lt;/poem&gt;
|''Isha Upanishad 6-7''|Translated by A Rambachan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anantanand Rambachan|title=The Advaita Worldview: God, World, and Humanity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ORPkAf3SZBQC&amp;pg=PA109 |year=2006|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-6851-7|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Adi Shankara, a leading proponent of Advaita, in verse 1.25 to 1.26 of his ''Upadeśasāhasrī'', asserts that the Self-knowledge is understood and realized when one's mind is purified by the observation of [[Yamas]] (ethical precepts) such as [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence, abstinence from injuring others in body, mind and thoughts), [[Satya]] (truth, abstinence from falsehood), [[Asteya]] (abstinence from theft), [[Aparigraha]] (abstinence from possessiveness and craving) and a simple life of meditation and reflection.{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|p=88–89}} Rituals and rites can help focus and prepare the mind for the journey to Self-knowledge,{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|p=92}} however, Shankara discourages ritual worship and oblations to ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]'' (God), because that assumes the Self within is different than Brahman. The "doctrine of difference" is wrong, asserts Shankara, because, "he who knows the Brahman is one and he is another, does not know Brahman".&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit:[http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_shankara/upadeshasaahasrii1.pdf Upadesha sahasri]&lt;br /&gt;English Translation: S Jagadananda (Translator, 1949), Upadeshasahasri, Vedanta Press, {{ISBN|978-8171200597}}, page 16-17; {{oclc|218363449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere, in verses 1.26-1.28, the Advaita text Upadesasahasri states the ethical premise of equality of all beings. Any ''Bheda'' (discrimination), states Shankara, based on class or caste or parentage is a mark of inner error and lack of liberating knowledge.&lt;ref name=upadesasahasri29&gt;Sanskrit:[http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_shankara/upadeshasaahasrii1.pdf Upadesha sahasri]&lt;br /&gt;English Translation: S Jagadananda (Translator, 1949), Upadeshasahasri, Vedanta Press, {{ISBN|978-8171200597}}, page 17-19; {{oclc|218363449}}&lt;/ref&gt; This text states that the fully liberated person understands and practices the ethics of non-difference.&lt;ref name=upadesasahasri29/&gt;

{{Quote|One, who is eager to realize this highest truth spoken of in the Sruti, should rise above the fivefold form of desire: for a son, for wealth, for this world and the next, and are the outcome of a false reference to the Self of Varna (castes, colors, classes) and orders of life. These references are contradictory to right knowledge, and reasons are given by the Srutis regarding the prohibition of the acceptance of difference. For when the knowledge that the one non-dual Atman (Self) is beyond phenomenal existence is generated by the scriptures and reasoning, there cannot exist a knowledge side by side that is contradictory or contrary to it.

== Texts ==
The [[Upanishads]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and [[Brahma Sutras]] are the central texts of the Advaita Vedanta tradition, providing the truths about the identity of ''Atman'' and ''Brahman'' and their changeless nature.{{sfn|Koller|2013|p=100-101}}{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=35}}

Adi Shankara gave a nondualist interpretation of these texts in his commentaries. [[Adi Shankara]]'s ''[[Bhashya]]'' (commentaries) have become central texts in the Advaita Vedanta philosophy, but are one among many ancient and medieval manuscripts available or accepted in this tradition.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|pp=221, 680}} The subsequent Advaita tradition has further elaborated on these sruti and commentaries.

=== ''Prasthanatrayi'' ===
The ''Vedanta'' tradition provides exegeses of the ''[[Upanishads]]'', the ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'', and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavadgita]]'', collectively called the ''[[Prasthanatrayi]]'', literally, ''three sources''.{{sfn|Grimes|1990|pp=6–7}}{{sfn|Koller|2013|p=100-101}}{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=35}}

# '''The ''[[Brahma Sutras]]'', or ''Nyaya prasthana'' / ''Yukti prasthana'''''; considered the reason-based foundation of ''Vedanta''. The ''Brahma Sutras'' attempted to synthesize the teachings of the ''Upanishads''.  The diversity in the teachings of the ''Upanishads'' necessitated the systematization of these teachings. The only extant version of this synthesis is the ''Brahma Sutras'' of ''[[Badarayana]]''. Like the ''Upanishads'', ''Brahma Sutras'' is also an aphoristic text, and can be interpreted as a non-theistic ''Advaita Vedanta'' text or as a theistic ''Dvaita Vedanta'' text. This has led, states Stephen Phillips, to its varying interpretations by scholars of various sub-schools of ''Vedanta''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Phillips (1998), ''Classical Indian Metaphysics'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814899}}, page&amp;nbsp;332 note&amp;nbsp;69&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Brahmasutra'' is considered by the Advaita school as the ''Nyaya Prasthana'' (canonical base for reasoning).{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=35-36}}

===Textual authority===
The identity of ''Atman'' and ''Brahman'', and their unchanging, eternal nature,{{sfn|Koller|2013|p=100}} are basic truths in Advaita Vedanta. The school considers the knowledge claims in the Vedas to be the crucial part of the Vedas, not its ''karma-kanda'' (ritual injunctions).{{sfn|Koller|2013|p=100-101}} The knowledge claims about self being identical to the nature of Atman and Brahman are found in the [[Upanishads]], which Advaita Vedanta has regarded as "errorless revealed truth."{{sfn|Koller|2013|p=100-101}} Nevertheless, states Koller, Advaita Vedantins did not entirely rely on revelation, but critically examined their teachings using reason and experience, and this led them to investigate and critique competing theories.{{sfn|Koller|2013|p=100-101}}

Advaita Vedanta, like all orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, accepts as an [[epistemic]] premise that [[Śruti]] (Vedic literature) is a reliable source of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Coburn, Thomas B. 1984. pp. 439"&gt;Coburn, Thomas B. 1984. pp. 439&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermaier (2007), Hinduism: A Beginner's Guide, {{ISBN|978-1851685387}}, Chapter 2, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliott Deutsche (2000), in Philosophy of Religion : Indian Philosophy Vol 4 (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0815336112}}, pages 245-248&lt;/ref&gt; The Śruti includes the four Vedas including its four layers of embedded texts - the Samhitas, the Brahmanas, the Aranyakas and the early Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty (1988), Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism, Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|0-7190-1867-6}}, pages 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, the Upanishads are the most referred to texts in the Advaita school.

The possibility of different interpretations of the Vedic literature, states Arvind Sharma, was recognized by ancient Indian scholars.&lt;ref name=asharmaav17&gt;Arvind Sharma (2007), Advaita Vedānta: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820272}}, pages 17-19, 22-34&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=35-36, 77, 210-212}} The [[Brahmasutra]] (also called Vedanta Sutra, composed in 1st millennium BCE) accepted this in verse 1.1.4 and asserts the need for the Upanishadic teachings to be understood not in piecemeal cherrypicked basis, rather in a unified way wherein the ideas in the Vedic texts are harmonized with other means of knowledge such as perception, inference and remaining [[pramana]]s.&lt;ref name=asharmaav17/&gt;{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=35-36}} This theme has been central to the Advaita school, making the [[Brahmasutra]] as a common reference and a consolidated textual authority for Advaita.&lt;ref name=asharmaav17/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayeda |first=Sengaku |year=2006 |title=A thousand teachings : the Upadeśasāhasrī of Śaṅkara |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2771-4 |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bhagavad Gita, similarly in parts can be interpreted to be a monist Advaita text, and in other parts as theistic Dvaita text. It too has been widely studied by Advaita scholars, including a commentary by Adi Shankara.&lt;ref name="rambachanepis"/&gt;{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=35-36, 77, 210-212}}

==History of Advaita Vedanta==
[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|''[[Adi Shankara]] with Disciples'', by [[Raja Ravi Varma]] (1904)|thumb|240px]]
Advaita Vedanta existed prior to Adi Shankara but found in him its most influential expounder.{{sfn|Grimes|1990|p=7}}

===Pre-Shankara Advaita Vedanta===
Of the Vedanta-school before the composition of the [[Brahma Sutras]] (400–450 CE{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}), wrote Nakamura in 1950, almost nothing is known.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}} The two Advaita writings of pre-Shankara period, known to scholars such as Nakamura in the first half of 20th-century, were the ''Vākyapadīya'', written by [[Bhartṛhari]] (second half 5th century{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=426}}), and the ''Māndūkya-kārikā'' written by [[Gaudapada]] (7th century CE).{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}

Scholarship after 1950 suggests that almost all [[Sannyasa#Sannyasa Upanishads|Sannyasa Upanishads]] have a strong Advaita Vedanta outlook.{{Sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp=17-18}}&lt;ref&gt;Stephen H Phillips (1995), Classical Indian Metaphysics, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0812692983}}, page 332 with note 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Rigopoulos (1998), Dattatreya: The Immortal Guru, Yogin, and Avatara, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791436967}}, pages 62-63&lt;/ref&gt; Six of these Sannyasa Upanishads – Aruni, Kundika, Kathashruti, Paramahamsa, Jabala and Brahma – were composed before the 3rd-century CE, likely in the centuries before or after the start of the common era, states Sprockhoff; the Asrama Upanishad is dated to the 3rd-century.{{Sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp=x-xi, 8-18}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Joachim F|last=Sprockhoff|year=1976|title=Samnyasa: Quellenstudien zur Askese im Hinduismus|publisher=Wiesbaden: Kommissionsverlag Franz Steiner|language=German| isbn=978-3515019057|pages=277–294, 319–377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strong Advaita Vedanta views in these ancient texts may be, states [[Patrick Olivelle]], because major Hindu monasteries of this period (early 1st millennium CE) belonged to the Advaita Vedanta tradition.{{Sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp=17-18}}

====Earliest Vedanta - ''Upanishads'' and ''Brahma Sutras''====
{{Main|Brahma Sutras}}
{{See also|Vedas|Upanishads|Darsanas}}

The Upanishads form the basic texts, of which Vedanta gives an interpretation.{{sfn|Deutsch|Dalvi|2004|p=95-96}} The Upanishads do not contain "a rigorous philosophical inquiry identifying the doctrines and formulating the supporting arguments".{{sfn|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxx}}{{refn|group=note|Nevertheless, Balasubramanian argues that since the basic ideas of the Vedanta systems are derived from the Vedas, the Vedantic philosophy is as old as the Vedas.{{sfn|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxix}}}} This philosophical inquiry was performed by the [[darsanas]], the various philosophical schools.{{sfn|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxx–xxxi}}{{refn|group=note|Deutsch and Dalvi point out that, in the Indian context, texts "are only part of a tradition which is preserved in its purest form in the oral transmission as it has been going on".{{sfn|Deutsch|Dalvi|2004|p=95}}}}

====Bādarāyana's Brahma Sutras====
The Brahma Sutras of Bādarāyana, also called the ''Vedanta Sutra'',{{sfn|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxxii}} were compiled in its present form around 400–450 CE,{{sfn|Nakamura|1950a|p=436}} but "the great part of the ''Sutra'' must have been in existence much earlier than that".{{sfn|Nakamura|1950a|p=436}} Estimates of the date of Bādarāyana's lifetime differ between 200 BCE and 200 CE.{{sfn|Pandey|2000|p=4}}

The Brahma Sutra is a critical study of the teachings of the Upanishads. It was and is a guide-book for the great teachers of the Vedantic systems.{{sfn|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxxii}} Bādarāyana was not the first person to systematise the teachings of the Upanishads.{{sfn|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxxiii}} He refers to seven Vedantic teachers before him:{{sfn|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxxiii}}
{{quote|From the way in which Bādarāyana cites the views of others it is obvious that the teachings of the Upanishads must have been analyzed and interpreted by quite a few before him and that his systematization of them in 555 sutras arranged in four chapters must have been the last attempt, most probably the best.{{sfn|Balasubramanian|2000|p=xxxiii}}}}

====Between Brahma Sutras and Shankara====
According to Nakamura, "there must have been an enormous number of other writings turned out in this period, but unfortunately all of them have been scattered or lost and have not come down to us today".{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}} In his commentaries, Shankara mentions 99 different predecessors of his Sampradaya.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002}} In the beginning of his commentary on the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad Shankara salutes the teachers of the Brahmavidya Sampradaya.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/pre-sankara.html advaita-deanta.org, ''Advaita Vedanta before Sankaracarya'']&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-Shankara doctrines and sayings can be traced in the works of the later schools, which does give insight into the development of early Vedanta philosophy.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}

The names of various important early Vedanta thinkers have been listed in the ''Siddhitraya'' by Yamunācārya (c.1050), the ''Vedārthasamgraha'' by Rāmānuja (c.1050–1157), and the ''Yatīndramatadīpikā'' by Śrīnivāsa-dāsa.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}} Combined together,{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}} at least fourteen thinkers are known to have existed between the composition of the Brahman Sutras and Shankara's lifetime.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}{{refn|group=note|Bhartŗhari (c.450–500), Upavarsa (c.450–500), Bodhāyana (c.500), Tanka (Brahmānandin) (c.500–550), Dravida (c.550), Bhartŗprapañca (c.550), Śabarasvāmin (c.550), Bhartŗmitra (c.550–600), Śrivatsānka (c.600), Sundarapāndya (c.600), Brahmadatta (c.600–700), Gaudapada (c.640–690), Govinda (c.670–720), Mandanamiśra (c.670–750).{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=3}}}}

Although Shankara is often considered to be the founder of the Advaita Vedanta school, according to Nakamura, comparison of the known teachings of these early Vedantins and Shankara's thought shows that most of the characteristics of Shankara's thought "were advocated by someone before Śankara".{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=678}} Shankara "was the person who synthesized the ''Advaita-vāda'' which had previously existed before him".{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=678}} In this synthesis, he was the rejuvenator and defender of ancient learning.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=679}} He was an unequalled commentator,{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=679}} due to whose efforts and contributions the Advaita Vedanta assumed a dominant position within Indian philosophy.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=679}}

===Gaudapada and ''{{IAST|Māṇḍukya Kārikā}}''===

[[File:Shri Gaudapadacharya Statue.jpg|thumb|240px|Statue of [[Gaudapada]].]]
Gaudapada (6th century){{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}} was the teacher of [[Govinda Bhagavatpada]] and the grandteacher of Shankara. [[Gaudapada]] uses the concepts of [[Ajativada]] and [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]{{sfn|Comans|2000|pp=27-33}} to establish "that from the level of ultimate truth the world is a cosmic illusion,"{{sfn|Comans|2000|pp=94}} and "suggests that the whole of our waking experience is exactly the same as an illusory and insubstantial dream."{{sfn|Deutsch|Dalvi|2004|p=157}}  In contrast, [[Adi Shankara]] insists upon a distinction between waking experience and dreams.{{sfn|Deutsch|Dalvi|2004|p=157}}

Gaudapada wrote or compiled{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=308}} the ''{{IAST|Māṇḍukya Kārikā}}'', also known as the ''{{IAST|Gauḍapāda Kārikā}}'' or the ''{{IAST|Āgama Śāstra}}''.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=280}} The ''{{IAST|Māṇḍukya Kārikā}}'' is a commentary in verse form on the ''[[Mandukya Upanishad]]'', one of the shortest [[Upanishads]] consisting of just 13 prose sentences. Of the ancient literature related to Advaita Vedanta, the oldest surviving complete text is the ''Māṇḍukya Kārikā''.{{sfn|Sharma|1997|p=239}} Many other texts with same type of teachings and which were older than ''Māṇḍukya Kārikā'' existed and this is unquestionable because other scholars and their views are cited by Gaudapada, Shankara and Anandagiri, according to Hajime Nakamura.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|pp=211-213}} Gaudapada relied particularly on ''Mandukya Upanishad'', as well as ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|Brihadaranyaka]]'' and ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]s''.{{sfn|Sharma|1997|p=239}}

The ''Mandukya Upanishad'' was considered to be a [[Śruti]] before the era of Adi Shankara, but not treated as particularly important.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=280}} In later post-Shankara period its value became far more important, and regarded as expressing the essence of the Upanishad philosophy. The entire ''Karika'' became a key text for the Advaita school in this later era.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|pp=280-281}}{{refn|group=note|Nakamura notes that there are contradictions in doctrine between the four chapters.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=308}} According to Murti, the conclusion from ''Mandukya Karika'' is irresistible that Gaudapada is attempting an advaitic interpretation of Vedanta school of Hinduism in the light of the Madhyamika and Yogcara doctrines of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=trvmurti114/&gt; However, adds Murti, the doctrines are unlike Buddhism. The first three chapters of the ''Karika'' are founded on the Upanishads, with little Buddhist flavor.&lt;ref name=trvmurti114/&gt; Chapter Four is unlike the first three, and shows Buddhist terms and influence.&lt;ref name=iepgauda/&gt; Further, according to Murti, and Richard King, no Vedanta scholars who followed Gaudapada ever quoted from Chapter Four of ''Karika'', they only quote from the first three.&lt;ref name=trvmurti114/&gt;&lt;ref name=iepgauda/&gt;}}

===Adi Shankara===
{{Main|Adi Shankara}}

Adi Shankara (788–820), also known as {{IAST|Śaṅkara Bhagavatpādācārya}} and {{IAST|Ādi Śaṅkarācārya}}, represents a turning point in the development of Vedanta.{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|p=13}} After the growing influence of Buddhism on Vedanta, culminating in the works of Gaudapada, Adi Shankara gave a Vedantic character to the Buddhistic elements in these works,{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|p=13}} synthesising and rejuvenating the doctrine of Advaita.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=679}} Using ideas in ancient Indian texts, Shankara systematized the foundation for Advaita [[Vedanta]] in the 8th century CE, though the school was founded many centuries earlier by [[Badarayana]].&lt;ref name=johnkoller/&gt; His thematic focus extended beyond [[metaphysics]] and [[soteriology]], and he laid a strong emphasis on ''[[Pramanas]]'', that is [[epistemology]] or "means to gain knowledge, reasoning methods that empower one to gain reliable knowledge".{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Rambachan, for example, summarizes the widely held view on one aspect of Shankara's epistemology before critiquing it as follows,
{{quote|According to these [widely represented contemporary] studies, Shankara only accorded a provisional validity to the knowledge gained by inquiry into the words of the [[Śruti]] (Vedas) and did not see the latter as the unique source (''pramana'') of ''Brahmajnana''. The affirmations of the Śruti, it is argued, need to be verified and confirmed by the knowledge gained through direct experience (''anubhava'') and the authority of the Śruti, therefore, is only secondary.&lt;ref name=rambachanepis/&gt;}}

Sengaku Mayeda concurs, adding Shankara maintained the need for objectivity in the process of gaining knowledge (''vastutantra''), and considered subjective opinions (''purushatantra'') and injunctions in Śruti (''codanatantra'') as secondary.{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=46–47}} Mayeda cites Shankara's explicit statements emphasizing epistemology (''pramana-janya'') in section 1.18.133 of Upadesasahasri and section 1.1.4 of Brahmasutra-bhasya.{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=46–47}}&lt;ref&gt;Karl H Potter (2014), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 3, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-691-61486-1}}, page 249&lt;/ref&gt;

Adi Shankara cautioned against cherrypicking a phrase or verse out of context from Vedic literature, and remarked that the ''Anvaya'' (theme or purport) of any treatise can only be correctly understood if one attends to the ''Samanvayat Tatparya Linga'', that is six characteristics of the text under consideration: 
# The common in ''Upakrama'' (introductory statement) and ''Upasamhara'' (conclusions)
# ''Abhyasa'' (message repeated)
# ''Apurvata'' (unique proposition or novelty)
# ''Phala'' (fruit or result derived)
# ''Arthavada'' (explained meaning, praised point)
# ''Yukti'' (verifiable reasoning).&lt;ref&gt;George Thibaut (Translator), Brahma Sutras: With Commentary of Shankara, Reprinted as {{ISBN|978-1-60506-634-9}}, pages 31–33 verse 1.1.4&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=46–53}}

While this methodology has roots in the theoretical works of [[Nyaya]] school of Hinduism, Shankara consolidated and applied it with his unique exegetical method called ''Anvaya-Vyatireka'', which states that for proper understanding one must "accept only meanings that are compatible with all characteristics" and "exclude meanings that are incompatible with any".&lt;ref&gt;Mayeda &amp; Tanizawa (1991), Studies on Indian Philosophy in Japan, 1963–1987, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 41, No. 4, pages 529–535&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Comans (1996), Śankara and the Prasankhyanavada, Journal of Indian Philosophy, Vol. 24, No. 1, pages 49–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Hacker and Phillips note that this insight into rules of reasoning and hierarchical emphasis on epistemic steps is "doubtlessly the suggestion" of Shankara in Brahma-sutra, an insight that flowers in the works of his companion and disciple Padmapada.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Phillips (2000) in Roy W. Perrett (Editor), Epistemology: Indian Philosophy, Volume 1, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-8153-3609-9}}, pages 224–228 with notes 8, 13 and 63&lt;/ref&gt; Merrell-Wolff states that Shankara accepts Vedas and Upanishads as a source of knowledge as he develops his philosophical theses, yet he never rests his case on the ancient texts, rather proves each thesis, point by point using ''[[pranama]]s'' (epistemology), reason and experience.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Merrell-Wolff (1995), Transformations in Consciousness: The Metaphysics and Epistemology, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-2675-3}}, pages 242–260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Will Durant (1976), Our Oriental Heritage: The Story of Civilization, Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|978-0-671-54800-1}}, Chapter XIX, Section VI&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical context====
{{See also|History of India#Late Middle Kingdoms – The Late-Classical Age|l1=Late-Classical Age|History of Hinduism#Middle Ages|l2=Hinduism Middle Ages}}

Shankara lived in the time of the so-called "Late classical Hinduism",{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41–43}} which lasted from 650 to 1100{{nbsp}}CE.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41–43}} This era was one of political instability that followed [[Gupta dynasty]] and King Harsha of the 7th{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}CE.&lt;ref name=johnkoller2&gt;John Koller (2012), ''Shankara in Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion'' (Editors: Chad Meister, Paul Copan), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-78294-4}}, pages 99–108&lt;/ref&gt; It was a time of social and cultural change as the ideas of Buddhism, Jainism, and various traditions within Hinduism were competing for members.&lt;ref&gt;TMP Mahadevan (1968), ''Shankaracharya'', National Book Trust, pages 283–285, {{oclc|254278306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=frankwhaling&gt;Frank Whaling (1979), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23440361 Sankara and Buddhism], Journal of Indian Philosophy, Vol.{{nbsp}}7, No.{{nbsp}}1, pages 1–42&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism in particular influenced India's spiritual traditions in the first 700 years of the 1st millennium CE.&lt;ref name=johnkoller2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (1998), ''Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Advaita Vedānta up to Śaṃkara and his pupils'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0310-7}}, pages 1–21, 103–119&lt;/ref&gt; Shankara and his contemporaries made a significant contribution in understanding Buddhism and the ancient Vedic traditions; they then transformed the extant ideas, particularly reforming the Vedanta tradition of Hinduism, making it India's most important tradition for more than a thousand years.&lt;ref name=johnkoller2/&gt;

====Writings====
{{Main|Adi Shankara bibliography}}

Adi Shankara is best known for his systematic reviews and commentaries (''Bhasyas'') on ancient Indian texts. Shankara's masterpiece of commentary is the ''Brahmasutrabhasya'' (literally, commentary on [[Brahma Sutra]]), a fundamental text of the Vedanta school of Hinduism.{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=6–7}} His commentaries on ten [[Mukhya Upanishads|Mukhya]] (principal) Upanishads are also considered authentic by scholars.{{sfn|Mayeda|2006|pp=6–7}}&lt;ref name=paulhacker30&gt;Paul Hacker, Philology and Confrontation: Paul Hacker on Traditional and Modern Vedanta (Editor: Wilhelm Halbfass), State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-2582-4}}, pages 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; Other authentic works of Shankara include commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita (part of his [[Prasthana Trayi]] Bhasya).&lt;ref name=rambachanepis&gt;A Rambachan (1991), Accomplishing the Accomplished: Vedas as a Source of Valid Knowledge in Sankara, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8248-1358-1}}, pages xii–xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Shankara's ''Vivarana'' (tertiary notes) on the commentary by Vedavyasa on [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yogasutras]] as well as those on Apastamba Dharma-sũtras (''Adhyatama-patala-bhasya'') are accepted by scholars as authentic works of Adi Shankara.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=93–97}}&lt;ref name=halbfassyoga/&gt; Among the ''Stotra'' (poetic works), the Daksinamurti Stotra, Bhajagovinda Stotra, Sivanandalahari, Carpata-panjarika, Visnu-satpadi, Harimide, Dasa-shloki, and Krishna-staka are likely to be authentic.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=93–97}}{{sfn|Pande|1994|pp=351–352}} He also authored [[Upadesasahasri]], his most important original philosophical work.&lt;ref name=johnkoller&gt;John Koller (2007), in Chad Meister and Paul Copan (Editors): ''The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1-134-18001-1}}, pages 98–106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=halbfassyoga&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass (1990), ''Tradition and Reflection: Explorations in Indian Thought'', State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-0362-4}}, pages 205–208&lt;/ref&gt; Of other original ''Prakaranas'' (प्रकरण, monographs, treatise), 76 works are attributed to Adi Shankara. Modern era Indian scholars Belvalkar and Upadhyaya accept five and thirty nine works, respectively, as authentic.{{sfn|Pande|1994|pp=113–115}}

Several commentaries on Nrisimha-Purvatatapaniya and Shveshvatara Upanishads have been attributed to Adi Shankara, but their authenticity is highly doubtful.&lt;ref name=paulhacker30/&gt;{{sfn|Pande|1994|pp=105–113}} Similarly, commentaries on several early and later Upanishads attributed to Shankara are rejected by scholars&lt;ref name=paulhackeraupr&gt;Paul Hacker, 'Sankaracarya and Sankarabhagavatpada: Preliminary Remarks Concerning the Authorship Problem', in ''Philology and Confrontation: Paul Hacker on Traditional and Modern Vedanta'' (Editor: Wilhelm Halbfass), State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-2582-4}}, pp. 41–56&lt;/ref&gt; as his works, and are likely works of later Advaita Vedanta scholars; these include the Kaushitaki Upanishad, Maitri Upanishad, Kaivalya Upanishad, Paramahamsa Upanishad, Sakatayana Upanishad, Mandala Brahmana Upanishad, Maha Narayana Upanishad, and Gopalatapaniya Upanishad.{{sfn|Pande|1994|pp=105–113}}

The authenticity of Shankara being the author of {{IAST|[[Viveka Chudamani|Vivekacūḍāmaṇi]]}}&lt;ref&gt;Adi Shankaracharya, [https://archive.org/stream/vivekachudamanio00sankrich#page/n3/mode/2up Vivekacūḍāmaṇi] S Madhavananda (Translator), Advaita Ashrama (1921)&lt;/ref&gt; has been questioned, and "modern scholars tend to reject its authenticity as a work by Shankara."&lt;ref&gt;John Grimes (2004), ''The Vivekacudamani of Sankaracarya Bhagavatpada: An Introduction and Translation'', Ashgate, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-3395-2}}, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; The authorship of Shankara of his [[Mandukya Upanishad]] ''Bhasya'' and his supplementary commentary on Gaudapada's ''{{IAST|Māṇḍukya Kārikā}}'' has been disputed by Nakamura.{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=262-265}} However, other scholars state that the commentary on Mandukya, which is actually a commentary on Madukya-Karikas by [[Gaudapada]], may be authentic.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=93–97}}{{sfn|Pande|1994|pp=105–113}}

====Influence of Shankara====
Shankara's status in the tradition of Advaita Vedanta is unparallelled. He travelled all over India to help restore the study of the Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;Per Durst-Andersen and Elsebeth F. Lange (2010), ''Mentality and Thought: North, South, East and West'', CBS Press, {{ISBN|978-87-630-0231-8}}, page{{nbsp}}68&lt;/ref&gt; His teachings and [[sampradaya|tradition]] form the basis of [[Smartism]] and have influenced [[Sant Mat]] lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ron Geaves|date=March 2002|title=From Totapuri to Maharaji: Reflections on a Lineage (Parampara)|publisher=27th Spalding Symposium on Indian Religions, Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the {{IAST|[[panchayatana puja|Pañcāyatana]]}} form of [[Puja (Hinduism)|worship]], the simultaneous worship of five deities{{snd}}Ganesha, Surya, Vishnu, Shiva, and Devi. Shankara explained that all deities were but different forms of the one [[Brahman]], the invisible Supreme Being.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermaier (2007), ''A Survey of Hinduism'', Third Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-7082-4}}, page{{nbsp}}40&lt;/ref&gt;

Benedict Ashley credits Adi Shankara for unifying two seemingly disparate philosophical doctrines in Hinduism, namely [[Jivatma|Atman]] and [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Benedict Ashley, O.P.|title=The Way toward Wisdom|isbn=0-268-02028-0|oclc=609421317|page=395|authorlink=Benedict Ashley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isaeva states that Shankara's influence extended to reforming Hinduism, founding monasteries, edifying disciples, disputing opponents, and engaging in philosophic activity that, in the eyes of Indian tradition, helped revive "the orthodox idea of the unity of all beings" and Vedanta thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shankara and Indian Philosophy|oclc=24953669|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hshaWu0m1D4C&amp;lpg=PP1|author=N. V. Isaeva|year=1992|page=2|isbn=978-0-7914-1281-7|publisher=State University of New York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars doubt Shankara's early influence in India.&lt;ref name=paulhacker29&gt;Paul Hacker, ''Philology and Confrontation: Paul Hacker on Traditional and Modern Vedanta'' (Editor: Wilhelm Halbfass), State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-2582-4}}, pages{{nbsp}}29–30&lt;/ref&gt; According to King and Roodurmun, until the 10th century Shankara was overshadowed by his older contemporary [[Maṇḍana Miśra|Mandana-Misra]], who was considered to be the major representative of Advaita.{{sfn|King|2002|p=128}}{{sfn|Roodurmun|2002|p=33–34}} Other scholars state that the historical records for this period are unclear, and little reliable information is known about the various contemporaries and disciples of Shankara.&lt;ref name=karlpottermms&gt;Karl Potter (2008), ''Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Advaita Vedānta up to Śaṃkara and his pupils'', Vol{{nbsp}}3, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0310-7}}, pages{{nbsp}}346–347, 420–423, Quote: "There is little firm historical information about Suresvara; tradition holds Suresvara is same as Mandanamisra."&lt;/ref&gt;

Several scholars suggest that the historical fame and cultural influence of Shankara grew centuries later, particularly during the era of the Muslim invasions and consequent devastation of India.&lt;ref name=paulhacker29/&gt;&lt;ref name=blakemichael&gt;R.

===Post-Shankara - early medieaval times===

====Sureśvara and Maṇḍana Miśra====
{{Main|Sureśvara|Maṇḍana Miśra}}

Sureśvara (fl. 800-900 CE){{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=30}} and Maṇḍana Miśra were contemporaries of Shankara, Sureśvara often (incorrectly) being identified with Maṇḍana Miśra.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=29}} Both explained Sankara "on the basis of their personal convictions".{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=29}} Sureśvara has also been credited as the founder of a pre-Shankara branch of Advaita Vedanta.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=30}}

Maṇḍana Miśra was a Mimamsa scholar and a follower of [[Kumarila]], but also wrote a seminal text on Advaita that has survived into the modern era, the ''Brahma-siddhi''.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=31}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen Wright Thrasher|title=The Advaita Vedānta of Brahma-siddhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9b2cJ1gLgvgC |year=1993|publisher =Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0982-6|pages=vii–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition, Maṇḍana Miśra and his wife were defeated by Shankara in a debate, after which he became a follower of Shankara.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=31}} Yet, his attitude toward Shankara was that of a "self-confident rival teacher of Advaita",{{sfn|Sharma|1997|p=291}} and his influence was such that some regard the ''Brahma-siddhi'' to have "set forth a non-Shankaran brand of Advaita""{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=31}} The "theory of error" set forth in this work became the normative Advaita Vedanta theory of error.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=32}} It was Vachaspati Misra's commentary on this work that linked it to Shankara's teaching.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=35}} His influential thesis in the Advaita tradition has been that errors are opportunities because they "lead to truth", and full correct knowledge requires that not only should one understand the truth but also examine and understand errors as well as what is not truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen Wright Thrasher|title=The Advaita Vedānta of Brahma-siddhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9b2cJ1gLgvgC |year=1993|publisher =Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0982-6|pages=101–109, 51–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hiriyanna and Kuppuswami Sastra have pointed out that Sureśvara and Maṇḍana Miśra had different views on various doctrinal points:{{sfn|Sharma|1997|p=290}}
* The locus of ''avidya'':{{sfn|Sharma|1997|p=290}} according to Maṇḍana Miśra, the individual ''jiva'' is the locus of ''avidya'', whereas Suresvara contends that the ''avidya'' regarding Brahman is located in Brahman.{{sfn|Sharma|1997|p=290}} These two different stances are also reflected in the opposing positions of the Bhamati school and the Vivarana school.{{sfn|Sharma|1997|p=290}}
* Liberation: according to Maṇḍana Miśra, the knowledge that arises from the Mahavakya is insufficient for liberation. Only the direct realization of Brahma is liberating, which can only be attained by meditation.{{sfn|Sharma|1997|p=290-291}} According to Suresvara, this knowledge is directly liberating, while meditation is at best a useful aid.{{sfn|Sharma|1997|p=291}}{{refn|group=note|According to both Roodurum and Isaeva, Sureśvara stated that mere knowledge of the identity of Jiva and Brahman is not enough for liberation, which requires prolonged meditation on this identity.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=30}}{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=241}}}}

====Advaita Vedanta sub-schools====
After Shankara's death, several sub-schools developed. Two of them still exist today, the [[Bhāmatī]] and the [[Vivarana]].&lt;ref group=web name =BhamatiVivarana&gt;[http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/bhavir.html THE BHAMATI AND VIVARANA SCHOOLS]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002}} Two defunct schools are the ''Pancapadika'' and ''Istasiddhi'', which were replaced by Prakasatman's Vivarana school.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=40}}

These schools worked out the logical implications of various Advaita doctrines. Two of the problems they encountered were the further interpretations of the concepts of [[Maya (illusion)|māyā]] and [[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]].&lt;ref group=web name =BhamatiVivarana /&gt;

=====Padmapada - Pancapadika school=====
[[Padmapada]] (c. 800 CE){{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=38}} was a direct disciple of Shankara who wrote the ''Pancapadika'', a commentary on the ''Sankara-bhaya''.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=38}} Padmapada diverged from Shankara in his description of ''avidya'', designating ''prakrti'' as ''avidya'' or ''ajnana''.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=39}}

=====Vachaspati Misra – Bhamati school=====
{{Main|Bhamati|Vācaspati Miśra}}

Vachaspati Misra (800–900 CE){{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=34}} wrote the ''Brahmatattva-samiksa'', a commentary on Maṇḍana Miśra's ''Brahma-siddhi'', which provides the link between Mandana Misra and Shankara{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=35}} and attempts to harmonise Shankara's thought with that of [[Mandana Misra]].&lt;ref group=web name=BhamatiVivarana /&gt; According to Advaita tradition, Shankara reincarnated as Vachaspati Misra "to popularise the Advaita System through his Bhamati".{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=34}} Only two works are known of Vachaspati Misra, the ''Brahmatattva-samiksa'' on Maṇḍana Miśra's ''Brahma-siddhi'', and his ''Bhamati'' on the ''Sankara-bhasya'', Shankara's commentary on the Brahma-sutras.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=35}} The name of the Bhamati sub-school is derived from this ''Bhamati''.&lt;ref group=web name=BhamatiVivarana&gt;[http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/bhavir.html THE BHAMATI AND VIVARANA SCHOOLS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bhamati school takes an ontological approach. It sees the [[Jiva]] as the source of avidya.&lt;ref group=web name=BhamatiVivarana /&gt; It sees meditation as the main factor in the acquirement of liberation, while the study of the Vedas and reflection are additional factors.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=37}}

=====Prakasatman - Vivarana school=====
{{Main|Vivarana}}

Prakasatman (c. 1200–1300){{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=40}} wrote the ''Pancapadika-Vivarana'', a commentary on the ''Pancapadika'' by [[Padmapadacharya]].{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=40}} The ''Vivarana'' lends its name to the subsequent school. According to Roodurmum, "[H]is line of thought [...] became the leitmotif of all subsequent developments in the evolution of the Advaita tradition."{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=40}}

The Vivarana school takes an epistemological approach. Prakasatman was the first to propound the theory of ''mulavidya'' or ''maya'' as being of "positive beginningless nature",{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=41}} and sees Brahman as the source of avidya. Critics object that Brahman is pure consciousness, so it cannot be the source of avidya. Another problem is that contradictory qualities, namely knowledge and ignorance, are attributed to Brahman.&lt;ref group=web name=BhamatiVivarana /&gt;

=====Vimuktatman - Ista-Siddhi=====
Vimuktatman (c. 1200 CE){{sfn|Dasgupta|1955|p=198}} wrote the ''Ista-siddhi''.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1955|p=198}} It is one of the four traditional ''siddhi'', together with Mandana's ''Brahma-siddhi'', Suresvara's ''Naiskarmya-siddhi'', and Madusudana's ''Advaita-siddhi''.{{sfn|Dasgupta|1955|p=198-199}} According to Vimuktatman, absolute Reality is "pure intuitive consciousness".{{sfn|Dasgupta|1955|p=199}} His school of thought was eventually replaced by Prakasatman's Vivarana school.{{sfn|Roodurmum|2002|p=40}}

===Late medieaval times - "Greater Advaita Vedanta" (Islamic rule of India)===
Michael s. Allen and Anand Venkatkrishnan note that Shankara is very well-studies, but "scholars have yet to provide even a rudimentary, let alone comprehensive account of the history of Advaita Vedanta in the centuries leading up to the colonial period."{{sfn|Allen|Venkatkrishnan|2017}}

====Prominent teachers====
{{See also|Dashanami Sampradaya|List of teachers of Advaita Vedanta}}

According to Sangeetha Menon, prominent names in the later Advaita tradition are:&lt;ref group=web name="Menon"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/adv-veda/ Sangeetha Menon (2007), ''Advaita Vedānta'', Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prakāsātman, Vimuktātman, Sarvajñātman (10th century)(see above)

* Sadānandā (15th century)
* Prakāṣānanda, Nṛsiṁhāśrama (16th century)
* Madhusūdhana Sarasvati, Dharmarāja Advarindra, Appaya Dīkśita (17th century)

====Influence of yogic tradition====
While Indologists like Paul Hacker and Wilhelm Halbfass took Shankara's system as the measure for an "orthodox" Advaita Vedanta, the living Advaita Vedanta tradition in medieaval times was influenced by, and incorporated elements from, the yogic tradition and texts like the ''[[Yoga Vasistha]]'' and the ''Bhagavata Purana''.{{sfn|Madaio|2017|p=4-5}} The ''Yoga Vasistha'' became an authoritative surce text in the Advaita vedanta tradition in the 14th century, while Vidyāraņya's ''Jivanmuktiviveka'' (14th century) was influenced by the ''(Laghu-)Yoga-Vasistha'', which in turn was influenced by [[Kashmir Shaivism]].{{sfn|Madaio|2017|p=4}} Vivekananda's 19th century emphasis on ''nirvikalpa samadhi'' was preceded by medieaval yogic influences on Advaita Vedanta. In thee 16th and 17th centuries, some [[Nath]] and [[hatha yoga]] texts also came within the scope of the Advaita vedanta tradition.{{sfn|Madaio|2017|p=5}}

====Development of central position====
{{Main|Neo-Vedanta}}

=====Highest Indian philosophy=====
Already in medieval times, Advaita Vedanta came to be regarded as the highest of the Indian religious philosophies,{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} a development which was reinforced in modern times due to western interest in Advaita Vedanta, and the subsequent influence on western perceptions on Indian perceptions of Hinduism.{{sfn|King|2002|p=119-133}}

In contrast, King states that its present position was a response of Hindu intellectuals to centuries of Christian polemic aimed at establishing "Hindu inferiority complex" during the colonial rule of the Indian subcontinent.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=136-138}} The "humanistic, inclusivist" formulation, now called Neo-Vedanta, attempted to respond to this colonial stereotyping of "Indian culture was backward, superstitious and inferior to the West", states King. Advaita Vedanta was projected as the central philosophy of Hinduism, and Neo-Vedanta subsumed and incorporated Buddhist ideas thereby making the [[Buddha]] a part of the Vedanta tradition, all in an attempt to reposition the history of Indian culture. Thus, states King, neo-Vedanta developed as a reaction to western [[Orientalism]] and [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]].{{sfn|King|2002|pp=136-138, 141-142}} With the efforts of Vivekananda, modern formulation of Advaita Vedanta has "become a dominant force in Indian intellectual thought", though Hindu beliefs and practices are diverse.{{sfn|King|2002|p=135}}

=====Unifying Hinduism=====
{{main|Unifying Hinduism}}

Advaita Vedanta came to occupy a central position in the classification of various Hindu traditions. To some scholars, it is with the arrival of Islamic rule, first in the form of Delhi Sultanate thereafter the Mughal Empire, and the subsequent persecution of Indian religions, Hindu scholars began a self-conscious attempts to define an identity and unity.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|pp=190-194, 200-201}}&lt;ref name=gaborieau7&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gaborieau |first=Marc |date=June 1985 |title=From Al-Beruni to Jinnah: Idiom, Ritual and Ideology of the Hindu-Muslim Confrontation in South Asia |journal=Anthropology Today |publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=7–14 |doi=10.2307/3033123 |jstor=3033123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the twelfth and the fourteen century, according to Andrew Nicholson, this effort emerged with a classification of astika and nastika systems of Indian philosophies.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|pp=190-194, 200-201}} Certain thinkers, according to Nicholson thesis, began to retrospectively classify ancient thought into "six systems" (''saddarsana'') of mainstream Hindu philosophy.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|pp=1-3}}

Other scholars, acknowledges Nicholson, present an alternate thesis. The scriptures such as the Vedas, Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita, texts such as [[Dharmasutras]] and [[Puranas]], and various ideas that are considered to be paradigmatic Hinduism are traceable to being thousands of years old. Unlike Christianity and Islam, Hinduism as a religion does not have a single founder, rather it is a fusion of diverse scholarship where a galaxy of thinkers openly challenged each other's teachings and offered their own ideas.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|pp=1-3}} The term "Hindu" too, states Arvind Sharma, appears in much older texts such as those in Arabic that record the Islamic invasion or regional rule of Indian subcontinent. Some of these texts have been dated to between the 8th and the 11th century.&lt;ref name=arvindsharmahhhh2&gt;Arvind Sharma (2002), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3270470 On Hindu, Hindustān, Hinduism and Hindutva] Numen, Vol. 49, Fasc. 1, pages 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; Within these ''[[Doxology|doxologies]]'' and records, Advaita Vedanta was given the highest position, since it was regarded to be most inclusive system.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|pp=178-183}}

===Modern times (Colonial rule and independence)===
According to Sangeetha Menon, Sadaśiva Brahmendra was a prominent 18th century Advaita Vedantin.&lt;ref group=web name="Menon"/&gt;

====Influence on Hindu nationalism====
{{Main|Hindu nationalism}}

According to King, along with the consolidation of the British imperialist rule came orientalism wherein the new rulers viewed Indians through "colonially crafted lenses". In response, emerged Hindu nationalism for collective action against the colonial rule, against the caricature by Christian and Muslim communities, and for socio-political independence.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=107-109}} In this colonial era search of identity, Vedanta came to be regarded as the essence of Hinduism, and Advaita Vedanta came to be regarded as "then paradigmatic example of the mystical nature of the Hindu religion" and umbrella of "inclusivism".{{sfn|King|2002|pp=107-109, 128}} This umbrella of Advaita Vedanta, according to King, "provided an opportunity for the construction of a nationalist ideology that could unite Hindus in their struggle against colonial oppression".{{sfn|King|2002|pp=132-133, 172}}

Among the colonial era intelligentsia, according to Anshuman Mondal, a professor of Literature specializing in post-colonial studies, the monistic Advaita Vedanta has been a major ideological force for Hindu nationalism. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] professed monism of Advaita Vedanta, though at times he also spoke with terms from mind-body dualism schools of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anshuman A Mondal|title=Nationalism and Post-Colonial Identity: Culture and Ideology in India and Egypt|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Rw2CAgAAQBAJ |year= 2004|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-49417-0|pages=85, 256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other colonial era Indian thinkers, such as Vivekananda, presented Advaita Vedanta as an inclusive universal religion, a spirituality that in part helped organize a religiously infused identity, and the rise of Hindu nationalism as a counter weight to Islam-infused Muslim communitarian organizations such as the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]], to Christianity-infused colonial orientalism and to religious persecution of those belonging to Indian religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Morris|title=Religion and Anthropology: A Critical Introduction|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PguGB_uEQh4C&amp;pg=PA142| year= 2006|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn =978-0-521-85241-8|pages=112, 141–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gaborieau7/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Blom Hansen|title=The Saffron Wave: Democracy and Hindu Nationalism in Modern India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SAqn3OIGE54C |year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691006710|pages=76–77, 91–92, 179–181, 44–47, 69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Swami Vivekananda=====
{{Main|Swami Vivekananda|Ramakrishna Mission}}

A major proponent in the popularisation of this Universalist and Perennialist interpretation of Advaita Vedanta was [[Vivekananda]],{{sfn|King|2002|p=135-142}} who played a major role in the [[Hindu nationalism|revival of Hinduism]],{{sfn|Dense|1999|p=191}} and the spread of Advaita Vedanta to the west via the [[Ramakrishna Mission]]. His interpretation of Advaita Vedanta has been called "Neo-Vedanta". Vivekananda discerned a [[Universalism|universal religion]], regarding all the apparent differences between various traditions as various manifestations of one truth.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=91-92}} He presented karma, bhakti, jnana and raja yoga as equal means to attain moksha,{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=91}} to present Vedanta as a liberal and universal religion, in contrast to the exclusivism of other religions.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=91}}

Vivekananda emphasised ''nirvikalpa'' [[samadhi]] as the spiritual goal of Vedanta, he equated it to the liberation in [[Yoga]] and encouraged Yoga practice he called ''Raja yoga''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rabindra Kumar Dasgupta|title=Swami Vivekananda on Indian philosophy and literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4LXAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture|isbn=978-81-85843-81-0|pages=145–146, 284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach, however, is missing in historic Advaita texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Comans | first=Michael | title=The Question of the Importance of Samadhi in Modern and Classical Advaita Vedanta | journal=Philosophy East and West | publisher=University of Hawai'i Press | volume=43 | issue=1 | year=1993 | pages=19–38 | doi=10.2307/1399467 | jstor=1399467 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, Vivekananda claimed that Advaita appeals to modern scientists:
{{quote|I may make bold to say that the only religion which agrees with, and even goes a little further than modern researchers, both on physical and moral lines is the Advaita, and that is why it appeals to modern scientists so much. They find that the old dualistic theories are not enough for them, do not satisfy their necessities. A man must have not only faith, but intellectual faith too".&lt;ref group=web&gt;[[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 2/Jnana-Yoga/The Absolute and Manifestation]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to [[Anantanand Rambachan|Rambachan]], Vivekananda interprets ''anubhava'' as to mean "personal experience", akin to [[religious experience]], whereas Shankara used the term to denote liberating understanding of the ''sruti''.{{sfn|Rambachan|1984}}{{sfn|Rambachan|1991}}{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}}

Vivekananda's claims about spirituality as "science" and modern, according to David Miller, may be questioned by well informed scientists, but it drew attention for being very different than how Christianity and Islam were being viewed by scientists and sociologists of his era.&lt;ref name="Ishwaran1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Miller|editor=Karigoudar Ishwaran|title=Ascetic Culture: Renunciation and Worldly Engagement |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gBwJoA1jZVUC&amp;pg=PA115 |year=1999|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-11412-2|pages=115–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan=====
{{Main|Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan}}

Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, first a professor at Oxford University and later a President of India, further popularized Advaita Vedanta, presenting it as the essence of Hinduism.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt; According to Michael Hawley, a professor of Religious Studies, Radhakrishnan saw other religions, as well as "what Radhakrishnan understands as lower forms of Hinduism," as interpretations of Advaita Vedanta, thereby "in a sense Hindusizing all religions".&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt; To him, the world faces a religious problem, where there is unreflective dogmatism and exclusivism, creating a need for "experiential religion" and "inclusivism". Advaita Vedanta, claimed Radhakrishnan, best exemplifies a Hindu philosophical, theological, and literary tradition that fulfills this need.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Hawley|editor=Steven Engler and Gregory Price Grieve|title=Historicizing "Tradition" in the Study of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=81AU6gxv7TAC&amp;pg=PA300|year=2005|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-090140-5|pages=300–312}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Minor1987p132"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Neil Minor|title=Radhakrishnan: A Religious Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2LzRkWABC6sC&amp;pg=PA132 |year=1987|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-88706-554-5|pages=18, 25–26, 39–42, 132–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radhakrishnan did not emphasize the differences between Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism versus Hinduism that he defined in terms of Advaita Vedanta, rather he tended to minimize their differences. This is apparent, for example, in his discussions of Buddhist "Madhyamika and Yogacara" traditions versus the Advaita Vedanta tradition.&lt;ref name="Minor1987p132"/&gt;

Radhakrishnan metaphysics was grounded in Advaita Vedanta, but he reinterpreted Advaita Vedanta for contemporary needs and context.&lt;ref group=web name="IEP"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/radhakri/#H2 Michael Hawley, ''Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1888—1975)'', Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged the reality and diversity of the world of experience, which he saw as grounded in and supported by the transcendent metaphysical absolute concept (''nirguna'' Brahman).&lt;ref group=web name="IEP" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Neo-Vedanta seems to be closer to [[Bhedabheda|Bhedabheda-Vedanta]] than to Shankara's Advaita Vedanta, with the acknowledgement of the reality of the world.

Sankara organised the Hindu monks of these ten sects or names under four {{IAST|[[Matha|Maṭhas]]}} (Sanskrit: {{lang|sa|मठ}}) (monasteries), called the ''Amnaya Mathas'', with the headquarters at [[Dvārakā]] in the West, [[Jagannatha Puri]] in the East, [[Sringeri]] in the South and [[Badrikashrama]] in the North.&lt;ref group=web name ="MonasticTradition" /&gt; Each math was first headed by one of his four main disciples, and the tradition continues since then.{{refn|group=note|According to Pandey, these Mathas were not established by Shankara himself, but were originally ashrams established by [[Vibhandak Rishi|Vibhāņdaka]] and his son [[Rishyasringa|Ŗșyaśŗnga]].{{sfn|Pandey|2000|p=4-5}} Shankara inherited the ashrams at Dvārakā and Sringeri, and shifted the ashram at Śŗngaverapura to Badarikāśrama, and the ashram at Angadeśa to Jagannātha Purī.{{sfn|Pandey|2000|p=5}}}} According to another tradition in Kerala, after Sankara's [[samadhi]] at Vadakkunnathan Temple, his disciples founded four mathas in Thrissur, namely [[Naduvil Madhom, Thrissur|Naduvil Madhom]], Thekke Madhom, Idayil Madhom and Vadakke Madhom.

Monks of these ten orders differ in part in their beliefs and practices, and a section of them is not considered to be restricted to specific changes made by Shankara. While the dasanāmis associated with the Sankara maths follow the procedures enumerated by Adi Śankara, some of these orders remained partly or fully independent in their belief and practices; and outside the official control of the Sankara maths. The advaita sampradaya is not a [[Saiva]] sect,&lt;ref group=web name ="MonasticTradition" /&gt;{{sfn|Nakamura|1950|p=782-783}} despite the historical links with Shaivism.{{refn|group=note|Sanskrit.org: "Advaitins are non-sectarian, and they advocate worship of Siva and Visnu equally with that of the other deities of Hinduism, like Sakti, Ganapati and others."&lt;ref group=web name ="MonasticTradition" /&gt;}} Nevertheless, contemporary Sankaracaryas have more influence among Saiva communities than among Vaisnava communities.&lt;ref group=web name ="MonasticTradition" /&gt;

==Relationship with other forms of Vedanta==
The Advaita Vedanta ideas, particularly of 8th century Adi Shankara, were challenged by theistic Vedanta philosophies that emerged centuries later, such as the 11th-century [[Vishishtadvaita]] (qualified [[nondualism]]) of [[Ramanuja]], and the 14th-century [[Dvaita]] (theistic dualism) of [[Madhvacharya]].{{sfn|Fowler|2002|pp=238–243, 288–294, 340–342}}

===Shuddhadvaita===
{{main|Shuddhadvaita}}

[[Vallabhacharya]] (1479–1531 CE), the proponent of the philosophy of [[Shuddhadvaita]] Brahmvad enunciates that Ishvara has created the world without connection with any external agency such as Maya (which itself is his power) and manifests Himself through the world.&lt;ref&gt;Devarshi Ramanath Shastri, "Shuddhadvaita Darshan (Vol.2)", Published by Mota Mandir, Bhoiwada, Mumbai, India, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; That is why shuddhadvaita is known as ‘Unmodified transformation’ or ‘Avikṛta Pariṇāmavāda’. Brahman or Ishvara desired to become many, and he became the multitude of individual souls and the world. Vallabha recognises Brahman as the whole and the individual as a ‘part’ (but devoid of bliss).&lt;ref&gt;"Brahmavād Saṅgraha", Pub. Vaishnava Mitra Mandal Sarvajanik Nyasa, Indore, India, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dvaita===
{{main|Dvaita}}

Madhvacharya was also a critic of [[Advaita]] Vedanta. Advaita's nondualism asserted that Atman (soul) and Brahman are identical, there is interconnected oneness of all souls and Brahman, and there are no pluralities.&lt;ref name=stoker2011mc/&gt;&lt;ref name=staffordbetty215/&gt; Madhva in contrast asserted that Atman (soul) and Brahman are different, only [[Vishnu]] is the Lord (Brahman), individual souls are also different and depend on Vishnu, and there are pluralities.&lt;ref name=stoker2011mc&gt;{{cite web|title=Madhva (1238-1317) |first= Valerie| last= Stoker| publisher= Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2011 |accessdate=2 February 2016| url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/madhva/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=staffordbetty215&gt;Stafford Betty (2010), Dvaita, Advaita, and Viśiṣṭādvaita: Contrasting Views of Mokṣa, Asian Philosophy: An International Journal of the Philosophical Traditions of the East, Volume 20, Issue 2, pages 215-224&lt;/ref&gt; Madhvacharya stated that both Advaita Vedanta and [[Mahayana Buddhism]] were a [[nihilism|nihilistic]] school of thought.&lt;ref name=smschari6/&gt; Madhvacharya wrote four major texts, including ''Upadhikhandana'' and ''Tattvadyota'', primarily dedicated to criticizing Advaita.&lt;ref name=smschari6&gt;SMS Chari (1999), Advaita and Visistadvaita, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120815353}}, pages 5-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars are divided on the historical influence of Advaita Vedanta. Some Indologists state that it is one of the most studied Hindu philosophy and the most influential schools of classical Indian thought.{{sfn|Indich|2000|page=57–60}}{{sfn|Fowler|2002|pp=240-243}}{{sfn|Brannigan|2009|page=19}} Advaita Vedanta, states [[Eliot Deutsch]], "has been and continues to be the most widely accepted system of thought among philosophers in India, and it is, we believe, one of the greatest philosophical achievements to be found in the East or the West".&lt;ref&gt;Eliot Deutsch (1996), Advaita Vedanta: A Philosophical Reconstruction, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824802714}}, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smarta Tradition===
{{Main|Smarta Tradition}}

The [[Smarta Tradition|Smarta]] tradition of [[Hinduism]] is an ancient tradition,{{refn|group=note|Archeological evidence suggest that the Smarta tradition in India dates back to at least 3rd-century CE.&lt;ref name="Williams1981p2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Asher|editor=Joanna Gottfried Williams|title=Kalādarśana: American Studies in the Art of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-qoeAAAAIAAJ  |year=1981|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-06498-2|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harle1994p141"/&gt;}} particularly found in south and west India, that revers all Hindu divinities as a step in their spiritual pursuit.&lt;ref name="Harle1994p141"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flood1996p17"/&gt;{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=1017}} Their [[Puja (Hinduism)|worship]] practice is called ''Panchayatana puja''.&lt;ref name="Bühnemann2003p60"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gudrun Bühnemann|title=Mandalas and Yantras in the Hindu Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQf2m8VaC_oC&amp;pg=PA60 |year=2003|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-9004129023|pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harle1994p141"&gt;{{cite book|author=James C.

In the Smarta tradition, Advaita Vedanta ideas combined with [[bhakti]] are its foundation. Adi Shankara is regarded as the greatest teacher{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=1017}} and reformer of the Smarta.{{sfn|Rosen|2006|p=166}} According to [[Alf Hiltebeitel]], Shankara's Advaita Vedanta and practices became the doctrinal unifier of previously conflicting practices with the ''smarta'' tradition.{{refn|group=note|Practically, Shankara fostered a rapprochement between Advaita and ''smarta'' orthodoxy, which by his time had not only continued to defend the ''varnasramadharma'' theory as defining the path of ''karman'', but had developed the practice of ''pancayatanapuja'' ("five-shrine worship") as a solution to varied and conflicting devotional practices. Thus one could worship any one of five deities (Vishnu, Siva, Durga, Surya, Ganesa) as one's ''istadevata'' ("deity of choice").{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2013}}}}

Philosophically, the Smarta tradition emphasizes that all images and statues ([[murti]]), or just five marks or any anicons on the ground, are visibly convenient icons of spirituality ''saguna Brahman''.&lt;ref name="lexicon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bühnemann2003p60"/&gt; The multiple icons are seen as multiple representations of the same idea, rather than as distinct beings. These serve as a step and means to realizing the abstract Ultimate Reality called nirguna Brahman. The ultimate goal in this practice is to transition past the use of icons, then follow a philosophical and meditative path to understanding the oneness of Atman (soul, self) and Brahman – as "That art Thou".&lt;ref name="lexicon"&gt;[https://www.himalayanacademy.com/readlearn/basics/four-sects The Four Denominations of Hinduism], Basics of Hinduism, Kauai Hindu Monastery&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Falk Reitz (1997), [http://crossasia-repository.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/76/1/Pancayatana_1.pdf Pancayatana-Komplexe in Nordindien: Entstehung, Entwicklung und regionale Besonderheiten einer indischen Architekturform], PhD Thesis (in German), Awarded by [[Free University of Berlin|Freie Universität Berlin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Hindu traditions===
Within the ancient and medieval texts of Hindu traditions, such as [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]] and [[Shaktism]], the ideas of Advaita Vedanta have had a major influence. Advaita Vedanta influenced Krishna Vaishnavism in the different parts of India.{{sfn|Neog|1980|pp=243–244}} One of its most popular text, the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', adopts and integrates in Advaita Vedanta philosophy.{{sfn|Kumar Das|2006| pp=172–173}}{{sfn|Brown|1983|pp=553–557}}{{sfn|Sheridan|1986|pp=1–2, 17–25}} The ''Bhagavata Purana'' is generally accepted by scholars to have been composed in the second half of 1st millennium CE.{{sfn|Sheridan|1986|p=6}}&lt;ref name="Archaism"&gt;{{Cite book | year=1966 | last=van Buitenen | first=J. A. B | chapter=The Archaism of the Bhagavata Purana|  editor=Milton Singer | title=Krishna: Myths, Rites, and Attitudes | pages=23–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient and medieval literature of [[Shaivism]], called the ''[[Āgama (Hinduism)|Āgamas]]'', the influence of Advaita Vedanta is once again prominent.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=126–128}}{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=162–167}}{{sfn|Klostermaier|1984|pp=177–178}} Of the 92 ''Āgamas'', ten are ''[[Dvaita]]'' texts, eighteen are ''[[Bhedabheda]]'', and sixty-four are ''[[Advaita]]'' texts.{{sfn|Davis|2014|p=167 note 21}}{{sfn|Dyczkowski|1989|pp=43–44}} According to Natalia Isaeva, there is an evident and natural link between 6th-century Gaudapada's Advaita Vedanta ideas and [[Kashmir Shaivism]].{{sfn|Isaeva|1995|pp=134–135}}

[[Shaktism]], the Hindu tradition where a goddess is considered identical to Brahman, has similarly flowered from a syncretism of the monist premises of Advaita Vedanta and dualism premises of Samkhya–Yoga school of Hindu philosophy, sometimes referred to as ''Shaktadavaitavada'' (literally, the path of nondualistic ''Shakti'').{{sfn|McDaniel|2004|pp=89–91}}{{sfn|Brooks|1990|pp=35–39}}{{sfn|Mahony|1997|p=274 with note 73}}

Other influential ancient and medieval classical texts of Hinduism such as the ''[[Yoga Yajnavalkya]]'', ''[[Yoga Vashishta]]'', ''[[Avadhuta Gita]]'', ''[[Markandeya Purana]]'' and ''[[Sannyasa Upanishads]]'' predominantly incorporate premises and ideas of Advaita Vedanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chapple|1984|pp=ix-x with footnote 3}};&lt;br&gt;Richard Rosen (2001), Review of Yogayajnavalkya Samhita by TKV Desikachar, {{Google books|AeoDAAAAMBAJ|Yoga Journal}}, Issue March/April, page 149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= White |first=David Gordon |title=The "Yoga Sutra of Patanjali": A Biography| year=2014 |publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691143774|pages=xvi–xvii, 50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Rigopoulos|1998|pp = 37, 57, 62–63, 195–207}};&lt;br&gt;{{cite book| author=M.

==Relationship with Buddhism==
{{See also|Buddhist influences on Advaita Vedanta}}

Advaita Vedanta and Mahayana Buddhism share similarities and have differences,{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=88–93}}{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|pp=60, 145–154}} their relationship a subject of dispute among scholars.&lt;ref name=ingalls291&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ingalls | first=Daniel H.

The similarities have been interpreted as Buddhist influences on Advaita Vedanta, while others deny such influences, or see them as variant expressions.&lt;ref&gt;N.V. Isaeva (1993), ''Shankara and Indian Philosophy'', SUNY Press, pages 12-14, 145–154&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Daniel H. H. Ingalls Sr.|Daniel Ingalls]], the Japanese Buddhist scholarship has argued that Adi Shankara did not understand Buddhism.&lt;ref name=ingalls291/&gt;

Some Hindu scholars criticized Advaita for its ''Maya'' and non-theistic doctrinal similarities with Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Lipner]] (1986), The Face of Truth: A Study of Meaning and Metaphysics in the Vedantic Theology of Rāmānuja, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0887060397}}, pages 120-123&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Whaling|1979|pp=1-42}} [[Ramanuja]], the founder of Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, accused Adi Shankara of being a ''Prachanna Bauddha'', that is, a "crypto-Buddhist",{{sfn|Biderman|1978|pp=405-413}} and someone who was undermining theistic [[Bhakti]] devotionalism.{{sfn|Whaling|1979|pp=1-42}} The non-Advaita scholar [[Bhāskara (philosopher)|Bhaskara]] of the Bhedabheda Vedanta tradition, similarly around 800 CE, accused Shankara's Advaita as "this despicable broken down Mayavada that has been chanted by the Mahayana Buddhists", and a school that is undermining the ritual duties set in Vedic orthodoxy.{{sfn|Whaling|1979|pp=1-42}}

A few Buddhist scholars made the opposite criticism in the medieval era toward their Buddhist opponents. In the sixth century CE, for example, the Mahayana Buddhist scholar [[Bhaviveka]] redefined Vedantic concepts to show how they fit into Madhyamaka concepts,{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=152}} and "equate[d] the Buddha's [[Dharma body]] with Brahman, the ultimate reality of the Upanishads."&lt;ref name=Eckel&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bhāvaviveka|author2=Malcolm David Eckel (Translator) |title=Bhāviveka and his Buddhist opponents: chapters 4 and 5 of Bhāviveka's Madhyamakahṛdayakārikaḥ with Tarkajvāla commentary|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Z1bYAAAAMAAJ|year= 2008|publisher= Harvard University Press|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Madhyamakahṛdayakārikaḥ'', Bhaviveka stages a Hinayana ([[Theravada]]) interlocutor, who accuses Mahayana Buddhists of being "crypto-Vedantins".{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|pp=152-153}}{{sfn|King|1995|p=183}}{{refn|group=note|Nicholson: "a Hīnayāna interlocutor accuses the Mahāyāna Buddhist of being a crypto-Vedāntin, paralleling later Vedāntins who accuse the Advaita Vedānta of crypto-Buddhism."{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|pp=152-153}}}} Medieval era Tibetan Gelugpa scholars accused the [[Jonang school]] of being "crypto-Vedantist."&lt;ref name=newland260/&gt;&lt;ref name=cozort74/&gt;{{refn|group=note|The [[Jonang school]] was influenced by Yogachara and taught [[Shentong]] Buddhism, which sees the highest Truth as self-existent.&lt;ref name=newland260&gt;{{cite book|author=Guy Newland|title=The Two Truths: In the Madhyamika Philosophy of the Gelukba Order of Tibetan Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WtFZIDFX2aIC |year=1992 |publisher= Shambhala|isbn= 978-1-55939-778-0|page= 260 note 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cozort74&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Cozort|title=Unique Tenets of The Middle Way Consequence School: The Systematization of the Philosophy of the Indian Buddhist Prāsaṅgika-Mādhyamika School|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bzb-Gih7k1EC&amp;pg=PA74 |year=1990|publisher=Shambhala|isbn=978-1-55939-997-5|pages=74–75 with footnote 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Contemporary scholar [[David Kalupahana]] called the seventh century Buddhist scholar [[Chandrakirti]] a "crypto-Vedantist", a view rejected by scholars of Madhayamika Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Paul Kakol|title= Emptiness and Becoming: Integrating Mādhyamika Buddhism and Process Philosophy|url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=1vZOAQAAIAAJ|year= 2009|publisher= Shambala|isbn= 978-81-246-0519-6|pages=108–109}}, Quote: "He also charges that Candrakirti was a crypto-Vedantist, (...)"&lt;/ref&gt;

According to scholars, the influence of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] on Advaita Vedanta has been significant.{{sfn|Whaling|1979|pp=1-42}}{{sfn|Grimes|1998|pp=684–686}} Advaita Vedanta and various other schools of Hindu philosophy share numerous terminology, doctrines and dialectical techniques with Buddhism.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=172}}{{sfn|Deutsch|Dalvi|2004|p=126, 157}} According to a 1918 paper by the Buddhism scholar O. Rozenberg, "a precise differentiation between Brahmanism and Buddhism is impossible to draw."{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=172}}

Both traditions hold that "the [[Twelve Nidānas|empirical world is transitory]], a [[Sunyata|show of appearances]]",{{sfn|Dasgupta|Mohanta|1998|pp=351-352}}&lt;ref name=helmithglasenapp2&gt;Helmuth Von Glasenapp (1995), Vedanta &amp; Buddhism: A comparative study, Buddhist Publication Society, pages 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; and both admit [[Two Truths doctrine|"degrees of truth or existence"]].{{sfn|Dasgupta|Mohanta|1998|p=354}} Both traditions emphasize the human need for spiritual liberation (moksha, nirvana, kaivalya), however with different assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;David Loy (1982), Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta, International Philosophical Quarterly, Volume 22, Issue 1, pages 65-74&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|[[Helmuth von Glasenapp]] writes: "The Buddhist Nirvana is, therefore, not the primordial ground, the eternal essence, which is at the basis of everything and form which the whole world has arisen (the Brahman of the Upanishads) but the reverse of all that we know, something altogether different which must be characterized as a nothing in relation to the world, but which is experienced as highest bliss by those who have attained to it ([[Anguttara Nikaya]], Navaka-nipata 34). Vedantists and Buddhists have been fully aware of the gulf between their doctrines, a gulf that cannot be bridged over. According to [[Majjhima Nikaya]], Sutta 22, a doctrine that proclaims "The same is the world and the self. This I shall be after death; imperishable, permanent, eternal!" (see [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] 4, 4, 13), was styled by the Buddha a perfectly foolish doctrine. On the other side, the [[Katha Upanishad]] (2, 1, 14) does not see a way to deliverance in the Buddhist theory of dharmas (impersonal processes): He who supposes a profusion of particulars gets lost like rain water on a mountain slope; the truly wise man, however, must realize that his [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] is at one with the [[Brahman|Universal Atman]], and that the former, if purified from dross, is being absorbed by the latter, "just as clear water poured into clear water becomes one with it, indistinguishably."&lt;ref&gt;Helmuth Von Glasenapp (1995), Vedanta &amp; Buddhism: A comparative study, Buddhist Publication Society, pages 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;}} Adi Shankara, states Natalia Isaeva, incorporated "into his own system a Buddhist notion of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'' which had not been minutely elaborated in the Upanishads".{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=172}} Similarly, there are many points of contact between Buddhism's [[Vijnanavada]] and Shankara's Advaita.{{sfn|Isaeva|1993|p=174}}

According to Frank Whaling, the similarities between Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism are not limited to the terminology and some doctrines, but also includes practice. The monastic practices and monk tradition in Advaita are similar to those found in Buddhism.{{sfn|Whaling|1979|pp=1-42}}

Dasgupta and Mohanta suggest that Buddhism and Shankara's Advaita Vedanta represent "different phases of development of the same non-dualistic metaphysics from the Upanishadic period to the time of Sankara."{{sfn|Dasgupta|Mohanta|1998|p=362}}{{refn|group=note|This development did not end with Advaita Vedanta, but continued in Tantrism and various schools of Shaivism. Non-dual [[Kashmir Shaivism]], for example, was influenced by, and took over doctrines from, several orthodox and heterodox Indian religious and philosophical traditions.{{sfn|Muller-Ortega|2010|p=25}} These include Vedanta, Samkhya, Patanjali Yoga and Nyayas, and various Buddhist schools, including Yogacara and Madhyamika,{{sfn|Muller-Ortega|2010|p=25}} but also Tantra and the Nath-tradition.{{sfn|Muller-Ortega|2010|p=26}}}} The influence of [[Mahayana Buddhism]] on other religions and philosophies was not limited to Vedanta. Kalupahana notes that the [[Visuddhimagga]] of Theravada Buddhism tradition contains "some metaphysical speculations, such as those of the Sarvastivadins, the Sautrantikas, and even the [[Yogacara|Yogacarins]]".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=206}} According to John Plott,
{{Quote|We must emphasize again that generally throughout the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta Dynasty]], and even more so after its decline, there developed such a high degree of syncretism and such toleration of all points of view that Mahayana Buddhism had been Hinduized almost as much as Hinduism had been Buddhaized.{{sfn|Plott|2000|pp=285–288}}}}

===Gaudapada===
The influence of Buddhist doctrines on Gaudapada has been a vexed question.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=105}}{{Sfn|Comans|2000|p=2}}

One school of scholars, such as Bhattacharya and Raju, state that Gaudapada took over the Buddhist doctrines that [[Yogacara#Representation-only|ultimate reality is pure consciousness (''vijñapti-mātra'')]]{{sfn|Raju|1971|p=177}}{{refn|group=note|It is often used interchangeably with the term ''citta-mātra'', but they have different meanings. The standard translation of both terms is "consciousness-only" or "mind-only." Several modern researchers object this translation, and the accompanying label of "absolute idealism" or "idealistic monism".{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=1}} A better translation for ''vijñapti-mātra'' is ''representation-only''.{{sfn|Kochumuttom|1999|p=5}}}} and "that the nature of the world is the four-cornered negation, which is the structure of Māyā".{{sfn|Raju|1971|p=177}}{{Sfn|Sarma|2007|pp=126, 143-144}}

Of particular interest is Chapter Four of Gaudapada's text ''Karika'', in which according to Bhattacharya, two karikas refer to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and the term ''Asparsayoga'' is borrowed from Buddhism.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=105}} According to Murti, "the conclusion is irresistible that Gaudapada, a Vedanta philosopher, is attempting an Advaitic interpretation of Vedanta in the light of the Madhyamika and Yogcara doctrines. He even freely quotes and appeals to them."&lt;ref name=trvmurti114&gt;TRV Murti (1955), The central philosophy of Buddhism, Routledge (2008 Reprint), {{ISBN|978-0-415-46118-4}}, pages 114-115&lt;/ref&gt; However, adds Murti, the doctrines are unlike Buddhism. Chapter One, Two and Three are entirely Vedantin and founded on the Upanishads, with little Buddhist flavor.&lt;ref name=trvmurti114/&gt; Further, state both Murti and King, no Vedanta scholars who followed Gaudapada ever quoted from Chapter Four, they only quote from the first three.&lt;ref name=trvmurti114/&gt;&lt;ref name=iepgauda&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/gauḍapad/ Gaudapada], Devanathan Jagannathan, University of Toronto, IEP&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sarma, "to mistake him [Gaudapada] to be a hidden or open Buddhist is absurd".{{Sfn|Sarma|2007|pp=145-147}} The doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are totally opposed, states Murti:&lt;ref name=trvmurti114/&gt;

{{Quote|
We have been talking of borrowing, influence and relationship in rather general terms. It is necessary to define the possible nature of the borrowing, granting that it did take place. (...) The Vedantins stake everything on the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (Brahman) and accept the authority of the Upanishads. We have pointed out at length the [[Anatta|Nairatmya]] standpoint of Buddhism and its total opposition to the Atman (soul, substance, the permanent and universal) in any form.
|TRV Murti|''The Central Philosophy of Buddhism''&lt;ref name=trvmurti116&gt;TRV Murti (1955), The central philosophy of Buddhism, Routledge (2008 Reprint), {{ISBN|978-0-415-46118-4}}, page 116&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Advaitins have traditionally challenged the Buddhist influence thesis.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=105}} Modern scholarship generally accepts that Gaudapada was influenced by Buddhism, at least in terms of using Buddhist terminology to explain his ideas, but adds that Gaudapada was a Vedantin and not a Buddhist.{{Sfn|Potter|1981|p=105}} Gaudapada adopted some Buddhist terminology and borrowed its doctrines to his Vedantic goals, much like early Buddhism adopted Upanishadic terminology and borrowed its doctrines to Buddhist goals; both used pre-existing concepts and ideas to convey new meanings.{{sfn|Plott|2000|pp=285–288}}{{sfn|Comans|2000|p=88–93}} While there is shared terminology, the Advaita doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are fundamentally different.&lt;ref name=trvmurti114/&gt;{{sfn|Potter|1981|p=81}}

===Differences from Buddhism===
====Atman and anatta====
Advaita Vedanta holds the premise, "Soul exists, and Soul (or self, Atman) is a self evident truth". Buddhism, in contrast, holds the premise, "Atman does not exist, and An-atman (or ''Anatta'', non-self)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta Anatta], Encyclopædia Britannica (2013), Quote: "Anatta in Buddhism, the doctrine that there is in humans no permanent, underlying soul. The concept of anatta, or anatman, is a departure from the Hindu belief in atman ("the self")."&lt;/ref&gt; is self evident".&lt;ref name=johnplott3&gt;John C. Plott et al. (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120801585}}, page 63, Quote: "The Buddhist schools reject any Ātman concept. As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dae-Sook Suh (1994), Korean Studies: New Pacific Currents, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824815981}}, page 171&lt;/ref&gt;

In Buddhism, ''[[Anatta]]'' (Pali, Sanskrit cognate An-atman) is the concept that in human beings and living creatures, there is no "eternal, essential and absolute something called a soul, self or atman".&lt;ref name=7sources&gt;'''[a]''' [http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta Anatta], Encyclopædia Britannica (2013), '''Quote:''' "Anatta in Buddhism, the doctrine that there is in humans no permanent, underlying soul. The concept of anatta, or anatman, is a departure from the Hindu belief in atman (“the self”).";&lt;br&gt;'''[b]''' Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-2217-5}}, page 64; '''Quote:''' "Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattā, Sanskrit: anātman, the opposed doctrine of ātman is central to Brahmanical thought).

In contrast to Advaita, which describes knowing one's own soul as identical with Brahman as the path to ''nirvana'', in its soteriological themes Buddhism has defined [[nirvana]] as that blissful state when a person realizes that he or she has "no self, no soul".&lt;ref name=7sources/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Loy (1982), Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta: Are Nirvana and Moksha the Same?, International Philosophical Quarterly, Volume 23, Issue 1, pages 65-74&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Buddhist texts chronologically placed in the 1st millennium of common era, such as the Mahayana tradition's ''Tathāgatagarbha sūtras'' suggest self-like concepts, variously called ''Tathagatagarbha'' or ''[[Buddha nature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|location=|pages=104, 125–127|via=|author=Paul Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

====Epistemology====
The epistemological foundations of Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta are different. Buddhism accepts two valid means to reliable and correct knowledge – perception and inference, while Advaita Vedanta accepts six (described elsewhere in this article).{{sfn|Grimes|1996|p=238}}&lt;ref name="ds"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Clayton (2010), Religions, Reasons and Gods: Essays in Cross-cultural Philosophy of Religion, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521126274}}, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Buddhists in history, have argued that Buddhist scriptures are a reliable source of spiritual knowledge, corresponding to Advaita's ''Śabda'' pramana, however Buddhists have treated their scriptures as a form of inference method.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Wayman (1999), A Millennium of Buddhist Logic, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120816466}}, page xix-xx&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ontology====
Advaita Vedanta posits a [[Substance theory|substance ontology]], an ontology which holds that underlying the change and impermanence of empirical reality is an unchanging and permanent absolute reality, like an eternal substance it calls Atman-Brahman.{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=49-50, 60-62}} In its substance ontology, as like other philosophies, there exist a universal, particulars and specific properties and it is the interaction of particulars that create events and processes.&lt;ref name="Bartley2011p91"/&gt;

In contrast, [[Buddhism]] posits a [[Process philosophy|process ontology]], also called as "event ontology".&lt;ref name="Williams2012p92"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartley2011p91"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Bartley|title=An Introduction to Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PlupnDEr5iAC|year=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-84706-449-3|pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Buddhist thought, particularly after the rise of ancient Mahayana Buddhism scholarship, there is neither empirical nor absolute permanent reality and ontology can be explained as a process.&lt;ref name="Williams2012p92"/&gt;{{sfn|Puligandla|1997|p=40-50, 60-62, 97}}{{refn|group=note|Kalupahana describes how in Buddhism there is also a current which favours substance ontology. Kalupahanan sees [[Madhyamaka]] and [[Yogacara]] as reactions against developments toward substance ontology in Buddhism.{{sfn|Kalupahanan|1994}}}} There is a system of relations and interdependent phenomena (''pratitya samutpada'') in Buddhist ontology, but no stable persistent identities, no eternal universals nor particulars. Thought and memories are mental constructions and fluid processes without a real observer, personal agency or cognizer in Buddhism. In contrast, in Advaita Vedanta, like other schools of Hinduism, the concept of self (atman) is the real on-looker, personal agent and cognizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Bartley|title=An Introduction to Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PlupnDEr5iAC|year=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-84706-449-3|pages=90–91, 96, 204–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pali Abdhidhamma and Theravada Buddhism considered all existence as ''dhamma'', and left the ontological questions about reality and the nature of ''dhamma'' unexplained.&lt;ref name="Williams2012p92"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Williams|author2=Anthony Tribe|author3=Alexander Wynne|title=Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BVvFBQAAQBAJ |year=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-20701-0|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Renard, Advaita's theory of three levels of reality is built on the two levels of reality found in the Madhyamika.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=130}}

====Shankara on Buddhism====
A central concern for Shankara, in his objections against Buddhism, is what he perceives as nihilism of the Buddhists.{{sfn|Ingalls|1954|p=302}} Shankara states that there "must be something beyond cognition, namely a cognizer,"{{sfn|Ingalls|1954|p=304}} which he asserts is the self-evident ''Atman'' or witness.{{sfn|Ingalls|1954|p=301-305}} Buddhism, according to Shankara, denies the cognizer. He also considers the notion of Brahman as pure knowledge and "the quintessence of positive reality."{{sfn|Ingalls|1954|p=302}}

The teachings in Brahma Sutras, states Shankara, differ from both the [[Sarvastivada|Buddhist realists]] and the [[Yogacara|Buddhist idealists]]. Shankara elaborates on these arguments against various schools of Buddhism, partly presenting refutations which were already standard in his time, and partly offering his own objections.{{sfn|Ingalls|1954}} Shankara's original contribution in explaining the difference between Advaita and Buddhism was his "argument for identity" and the "argument for the witness".{{sfn|Ingalls|1954|p=299-301, 303-304}} In Shankara's view, the Buddhist are internally inconsistent in their theories, because "the reservoir-consciousness that [they] set up, being momentary, is no better than ordinary consciousness. Or, if [they] allow the reservoir-consciousness to be lasting, [they] destroy [their] theory of momentariness."{{sfn|Ingalls|1954|pp=302-303}} In response to the idealists, he notes that their ''[[alaya-vijnana]]'', or store-house consciousness, runs counter to the Buddhist theory of momentariness.{{sfn|Ingalls|1954|p=302}} With regard to the ''Sunyavada'' ([[Madhyamaka]]), Shankara states that "being contradictory to all valid means of knowledge, we have not thought worth while to refute" and "common sense (''loka-vyavahara'') cannot be denied without the discovery of some other truth".{{sfn|Ingalls|1954|p=303}}

==Reception==
Advaita Vedanta is most often regarded as an idealist [[monism]].&lt;ref name=menoniep2/&gt;&lt;ref name="JN Mohanty 1980 page 205"/&gt; According to King, Advaita Vedanta developed "to its ultimate extreme" the monistic ideas already present in the Upanishads.{{sfn|King|1995|p=65; Quote: "The prevailing monism of the Upanishads was developed by the Advaita Vedanta to its ultimate extreme"}} In contrast, states Milne, it is misleading to call Advaita Vedanta "monistic," since this confuses the "negation of difference" with "conflation into one."{{sfn|Milne|1997|p=168}} ''Advaita'' is a negative term (a-dvaita), states Milne, which denotes the "negation of a difference," between subject and object, or between perceiver and perceived. {{sfn|Milne|1997|p=168}}

According to Deutsch, Advaita Vedanta teaches monistic oneness, however without the multiplicity premise of alternate monism theories.{{Sfn|Deutsch|1988|pp=3, 10, 13-14 with footnotes}} According to Jacqueline Hirst, Adi Shankara positively emphasizes "oneness" premise in his Brahma-sutra Bhasya 2.1.20, attributing it to all the Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Hirst (2005), Samkara's Advaita Vedanta: A Way of Teaching, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415406017}}, page 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson states Advaita Vedanta contains realistic strands of thought, both in its oldest origins and in Shankara's writings.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=68}}

==Advaitic Meditation (Bhramara-kita-nyaya)==
Bhramara-kita-nyaya is based on the analogy of the wasp and the caterpillar, which states how the caterpillar gets transformed into a wasp by intense thinking of the latter. Similarly, the Jiva becomes [[Brahman]] itself by meditating intensely on [[Brahman]].

'''Anga Lipi''' (অঙ্গ লিপি) is a historical [[writing system]] or script of the [[Anga area]] of India.It is believed to have been originated from Mithilakshara or the [[Tirhuta]] script used to write [[Maithili language|Maithili]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Etymology and history==
''[[Anga]]'' refers to a region in what is now [[Bihar]] and [[Jharkhand]] states of [[India]], and ''Lipi'' means ''script''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Olivelle | first1 = Patrick | title =Between the empires: society in India 300 BCE to 400 CE | date = 2006 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = [[Oxford University]]  | isbn = 0-19-530532-9 | page =  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=efaOR_-YsIcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Anga Script is mentioned in an ancient Sanskrit language Buddhist book the [[Lalitavistara Sūtra|"Lalitvistar"]] (ललितविस्तर), which names Anga Lipi relatively early in the list of 64 scripts known to the Buddha. The script was specific to the [[Anga]] region, or [[Anga Mahajanapada]], and was among those known to Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Wilson  | first1 =John |  title =Indian Caste | date = 2005 | publisher = Adamant Media Corporation | location =   | isbn = 1-4021-7996-0 | page =  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2vPtVVNPcIC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;dq=anga+lipi&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=krkcTPfdOYqVrAertvzpCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEEQuwUwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=anga%20lipi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script was mentioned as the fourth most important script of Ancient India in one version. [[Arthur Coke Burnell]] thought that some of the sixty four scripts mentioned in "Lalitvistar" were mythical, but he considered some, including Dravid, Anga and Banga, to be real, though not appearing as distinct alphabets until the 9th or 10th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 =Coke Burnell  | first1 =Arthur  |  title =Elements of South-Indian Palaeography | date = 1878| publisher = Trübner &amp; Co | location = London | isbn =  | page =  52 |url= https://archive.org/stream/elementssouthin05burngoog#page/n70/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Burnell regarded this passage as a late [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolation]].)

==Characteristics and comparison==
Anga Lipi and [[Eastern Nagari script]] might have been derived from Brahmic, with some regional characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Sircar  | first1 =D.C. |  title =Journal of ancient Indian history | date = 1986 | publisher = [[University of Calcutta]],Dept. of Ancient Indian History and Culture | location =  | isbn = | page =  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LfxtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=anga+lipi&amp;dq=anga+lipi&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=I7McTMn7KsmGrQfuvaDfCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw}}&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the belief that the development of local characteristics in alphabets was continuing from earlier times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 =  K.L.M.  | first1 = Firma |  title =The people and culture of Bengal, a study in origins | date = 2002 |location =  | isbn =  | page =  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=viRuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=anga+lipi&amp;dq=anga+lipi&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=I7McTMn7KsmGrQfuvaDfCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10855">[[File:Stonedhenge.jpg|thumb|The sun shining through a trilithon at Stonehenge]]
The prehistoric monument of [[Stonehenge]] has long been studied for its possible connections with ancient astronomy. The site is aligned in the direction of the sunrise of the summer solstice and the sunset of the winter solstice. [[archaeoastronomy|Archaeoastronomers]] have made a range of further claims about the site’s connection to astronomy, its meaning, and its use.

==Early work==
Stonehenge has an opening in the henge earthwork facing northeast, and suggestions that particular significance was placed by its builders on the [[solstice]] and [[equinox]] points have followed. For example, the summer solstice sun rose close to the Heel Stone, and the sun’s first rays shone into the centre of the monument between the horseshoe arrangement. While it is possible that such an alignment could be coincidental, this astronomical orientation had been acknowledged since [[William Stukeley]] drew the site and first identified its axis along the midsummer sunrise in 1720.&lt;ref&gt;William Stukeley, [http://newensign.christsassembly.com/Stonehenge_Stuckley.pdf ''Stonehenge, A Temple Restor’d to the British Druids''], W Innys &amp; R Manby, London (1740), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stukeley noticed that the Heel Stone was not precisely aligned on the sunrise. The drifting of the position of the sunrise due to the change in the obliquity of the [[ecliptic]] since the monument’s erection does not account for this imprecision. Recently, evidence has been found for a neighbour to the [[Heel Stone]], no longer extant. The second stone may have instead been one side of a ‘solar corridor’ used to frame the sunrise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Stonehenge: Circles of the Season | url = http://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/xpeditions/activities/07/popup/stonehenge.html | accessdate = 2008-04-12 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080427012558/http://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/xpeditions/activities/07/popup/stonehenge.html| archivedate= 27 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Ruggles | first = Clive | author2 = Hoskin, Michael | title = Astronomy Before History | encyclopedia = The Cambridge Concise History of Astronomy | editor-last = Hoskin | editor-first = Michael |volume=| pages = 6 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | location = Cambridge | date = 1999 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4nmjGztzfZwC&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=heel+stone+companion+discovered#PPR5,M1 | accessdate = 2008-04-12 | isbn = 0-521-57600-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stukeley and the renowned astronomer [[Edmund Halley]] attempted what amounted to the first scientific attempt to date a prehistoric monument. Stukeley concluded the Stonehenge had been set up “by the use of a magnetic compass to lay out the works, the needle varying so much, at that time, from true north.” He attempted to calculate the change in magnetic variation between the observed and theoretical (ideal) Stonehenge sunrise, which he imagined would relate to the date of construction.  Their calculations returned three dates, the earliest of which, 460&amp;nbsp;BC, was accepted by Stukeley. That was incorrect, but this early exercise in dating is a landmark in field archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Anthony. (2008). ''Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|978-0-500-05155-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early efforts to date Stonehenge exploited changes in astronomical declinations and led to efforts such as H.&amp;nbsp;Broome’s 1864 theory that the monument was built in 977&amp;nbsp;BC, when the star [[Sirius]] would have risen over Stonehenge’s [[Avenue (archaeology)|Avenue]]. Sir&amp;nbsp;[[Norman Lockyer]] proposed a date of 1680 BC based entirely on an incorrect sunrise [[azimuth]] for the Avenue, aligning it on a nearby [[Ordnance Survey]] [[trig point]], a modern feature. Petrie preferred a later date of 730&amp;nbsp;AD. The relevant stones were leaning considerably during his survey, and it was not considered accurate.

An archaeoastronomy debate was triggered by the 1963 publication of ''Stonehenge Decoded'', by [[Gerald Hawkins]] an American astronomer. Hawkins claimed to observe numerous alignments, both lunar and solar.  He argued that Stonehenge could have been used to predict eclipses. Hawkins’ book received wide publicity, in part because he used a computer in his calculations, then a novelty. Archaeologists were suspicious in the face of further contributions to the debate coming from British astronomer C.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;‘Peter’ Newham and Sir&amp;nbsp;[[Fred Hoyle]], the famous Cambridge cosmologist, as well as by [[Alexander Thom]], a retired professor of engineering, who had been studying stone circles for more than 20&amp;nbsp;years. Their theories have faced criticism in recent decades from [[Richard J. C. Atkinson]] and others who have suggested impracticalities in the ‘Stone Age calculator’ interpretation.

==Gerald Hawkins’ work==
[[Image:Stonehenge back wide.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Stonehenge in 2004]]
Gerald Hawkins’ work on Stonehenge was first published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1963 following analyses he had carried out using the Harvard-Smithsonian IBM computer. Hawkins found not one or two alignments but dozens. He had studied 165&amp;nbsp;significant features at the monument and used the computer to check every alignment between them against every rising and setting point for the sun, moon, planets, and bright stars in the positions they would have been in 1500&amp;nbsp;BCE. Thirteen solar and eleven lunar correlations were very precise in relation to the early features at the site but precision was less for later features of the monument. Hawkins also proposed a method for using the [[Aubrey holes]] to predict lunar eclipses by moving markers from hole to hole. In 1965 Hawkins and J.B.&amp;nbsp;White wrote ''[[Stonehenge Decoded]]'', which detailed his findings and proposed that the monument was a ‘Neolithic computer’.

Atkinson replied with his article “Moonshine on Stonehenge” in ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' in 1966, pointing out that some of the pits which Hawkins had used for his sight lines were more likely to have been natural depressions, and that he had allowed a margin of error of up to 2&amp;nbsp;degrees in his alignments. Atkinson found that the probability of so many alignments being visible from 165&amp;nbsp;points to be close to 0.5 (or rather 50:50) rather that the “one in a million” possibility which  Hawkins had claimed. That the Station Stones stood on top of the earlier Aubrey Holes meant that many of Hawkins’ alignments between the two features were illusory. The same article by Atkinson contains further criticisms of the interpretation of [[Aubrey Holes]] as astronomical markers, and of Fred Hoyle’s work.

A question exists over whether the English climate would have permitted accurate observation of  astronomical events. Modern researchers were looking for alignments with phenomena they already knew existed; the prehistoric users of the site did not have this advantage.

==Newham and the Station Stones==
In 1966, C. A. ‘Peter’ Newham described an alignment for the equinoxes by drawing a line between one of the [[Station Stones]] with a posthole next to the Heel Stone. He also identified a lunar alignment; the long sides of the rectangle created by the four station stones matched the moon rise and moonset at the [[major standstill]]. Newham also suggested that the postholes near the entrance were used for observing the [[Saros (astronomy)|saros cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-vWrImYK8K0C&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=peter+Newham+and+the+Station+Stones#v=onepage&amp;q=peter%20Newham%20and%20the%20Station%20Stones&amp;f=false | title = Stonehenge | isbn = 1847650759 | author1 = Hill | first1 = Rosemary | date = 2010-12-09 | pmid = 17830710 | volume = 133 | issue = 3460 | pages = 1216–22 | doi = 10.1126/science.133.3460.1216 | journal = Science|bibcode = 1961Sci...133.1216H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the Station Stones are damaged and although their positions would create an approximate rectangle, their date and thus their relationship with the other features at the site is uncertain. Stonehenge’s latitude (&amp;nbsp;51°&amp;nbsp;10′&amp;nbsp;44″&amp;nbsp;N&amp;nbsp;) is unusual in that only at this approximate latitude (within about 50&amp;nbsp;km) do the lunar and solar alignments mentioned above occur at right angles to one another. More than 50&amp;nbsp;km north or south of the [[latitude]] of Stonehenge, the station stones could not be set out as a rectangle.

==Alexander Thom’s work==
[[Alexander Thom]] had been examining stone circles since the 1950s in search of astronomical alignments and the [[megalithic yard]].  It was not until 1973 that he turned his attention to Stonehenge. Thom chose to ignore alignments between features within the monument, considering them to be too close together to be reliable. He looked for landscape features that could have marked lunar and solar events. However, one of Thom’s key sites – Peter’s Mound – turned out to be a twentieth-century rubbish dump.

==Later theories==
Although Stonehenge has become an increasingly popular destination during the summer solstice, with 20,000&amp;nbsp;people visiting in 2005, scholars have developed growing evidence that indicates prehistoric people visited the site only during the winter solstice. The only megalithic monuments in the British Isles to contain a clear, compelling solar alignment are [[Newgrange]] and [[Maeshowe]], which both famously face the winter solstice sunrise.

The most recent evidence supporting the theory of winter visits includes bones and teeth from pigs which were slaughtered at nearby [[Durrington Walls]]. Their age at death indicating that they were slaughtered either in December or January every year. Mike Parker Pearson of the [[University of Sheffield]] has said, “We have no evidence that anyone was in the landscape in summer.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Stonehenge druids ‘mark wrong solstice’ | author = Clover, Charles | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1492482/Stonehenge-druids-mark-wrong-solstice.html | accessdate = 2008-04-12 | location=London | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=2005-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8915">[[File:Arithmetic_progression.svg|thumb|Visual proof of the derivation of arithmetic progression formulas &amp;ndash; the faded blocks are a rotated copy of the arithmetic progression]]
In [[mathematics]], an '''arithmetic progression ''' (AP) or '''arithmetic sequence''' is a [[sequence]] of [[number]]s such that the difference between the consecutive terms is constant. Difference here means the second minus the first.
For instance, the sequence  5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, . . . is an arithmetic progression with ''common difference'' of 2.

If the initial term of an arithmetic progression is &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; and the common difference of successive members is ''d'', then the ''n''th term of the sequence (&lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt;) is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\ a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d&lt;/math&gt;,

and in general

:&lt;math&gt;\ a_n = a_m + (n - m)d&lt;/math&gt;.

A finite portion of an arithmetic progression is called a '''finite arithmetic progression''' and sometimes just called an arithmetic progression. The [[summation|sum]] of a finite arithmetic progression is called an '''arithmetic series'''.

The behavior of the arithmetic progression depends on the common difference ''d''. If the common difference is:

*positive, then the members (terms) will grow towards positive [[infinity]];
*negative, then the members (terms) will grow towards negative infinity.

==Sum==

&lt;div class="thumb tright"&gt;
&lt;div class="thumbinner" style="width:220px;"&gt;
{| style="background-color:white; width:220px;"
| 2 || + || 5 || + || 8 || + || 11 || + || 14 || = || 40
|-
| 14 || + || 11 || + || 8 || + || 5 || + || 2 || = || 40
|-
|colspan=11|&lt;hr&gt;
|-
| 16 || + || 16 || + ||  16 || + ||  16 || + ||  16 || = || 80
|}
&lt;div class="thumbcaption"&gt;
Computation of the sum 2 + 5 + 8 + 11 + 14. When the sequence is reversed and added to itself term by term, the resulting sequence has a single repeated value in it, equal to the sum of the first and last numbers (2 + 14 = 16). Thus 16 &amp;times; 5 = 80 is twice the sum.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
The [[Summation|sum]] of the members of a finite arithmetic progression is called an '''arithmetic series'''. For example, consider the sum:

:&lt;math&gt;2 + 5 + 8 + 11 + 14&lt;/math&gt;

This sum can be found quickly by taking the number ''n'' of terms being added (here 5), multiplying by the sum of the first and last number in the progression (here 2 + 14 = 16), and dividing by 2:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

In the case above, this gives the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;2 + 5 + 8 + 11 + 14 = \frac{5(2 + 14)}{2} = \frac{5 \times 16}{2} = 40.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula works for any real numbers &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt;. For example:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3\left(-\frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\right)}{2} = -\frac{3}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

To derive the above formula, begin by expressing the arithmetic series in two different ways:
:&lt;math&gt; S_n=a_1+(a_1+d)+(a_1+2d)+\cdots+(a_1+(n-2)d)+(a_1+(n-1)d)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; S_n=(a_n-(n-1)d)+(a_n-(n-2)d)+\cdots+(a_n-2d)+(a_n-d)+a_n.&lt;/math&gt;

Adding both sides of the two equations, all terms involving ''d'' cancel:

:&lt;math&gt;\ 2S_n=n(a_1 + a_n).&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing both sides by 2 produces a common form of the equation:

:&lt;math&gt; S_n=\frac{n}{2}( a_1 + a_n).&lt;/math&gt;

An alternate form results from re-inserting the substitution: &lt;math&gt;a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; S_n=\frac{n}{2}[ 2a_1 + (n-1)d].&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, the mean value of the series can be calculated via: &lt;math&gt;S_n / n&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \overline{n} =\frac{a_1 + a_n}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

In 499 AD [[Aryabhata]], a prominent [[mathematician]]-[[astronomer]] from the classical age of [[Indian mathematics]] and [[Indian astronomy]], gave this method in the ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' (section 2.18).

==Product==
The [[product (mathematics)|product]] of the members of a finite arithmetic progression with an initial element ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, common differences ''d'', and ''n'' elements in total is determined in a closed expression

:&lt;math&gt;a_1a_2\cdots a_n = d \frac{a_1}{d} d \left (\frac{a_1}{d}+1 \right )d \left ( \frac{a_1}{d}+2 \right )\cdots d \left ( \frac{a_1}{d}+n-1 \right )=d^n {\left(\frac{a_1}{d}\right)}^{\overline{n}} = d^n \frac{\Gamma \left(a_1/d + n\right) }{\Gamma \left( a_1 / d \right) },&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x^{\overline{n}}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Pochhammer symbol|rising factorial]] and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Gamma function]]. (Note however that the formula is not valid when &lt;math&gt;a_1/d&lt;/math&gt; is a negative integer or zero.)

This is a generalization from the fact that the product of the progression &lt;math&gt;1 \times 2 \times \cdots \times n&lt;/math&gt; is given by the [[factorial]] &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; and that the product

:&lt;math&gt;m \times (m+1) \times (m+2) \times \cdots \times (n-2) \times (n-1) \times n &lt;/math&gt;

for [[Natural number|positive integer]]s &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{(m-1)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the example from above, the product of the terms of the arithmetic progression given by ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 3 + (''n''-1)(5) up to the 50th term is
:&lt;math&gt;P_{50} = 5^{50} \cdot \frac{\Gamma \left(3/5 + 50\right) }{\Gamma \left( 3 / 5 \right) } \approx 3.78438 \times 10^{98}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Standard deviation==

The standard deviation of any arithmetic progression can be calculated as

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma = |d|\sqrt{\frac{(n-1)(n+1)}{12}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of terms in the progression and
&lt;math&gt; d&lt;/math&gt; is the common difference between terms.

==Intersections==
The [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of any two doubly infinite arithmetic progressions is either empty or another arithmetic progression, which can be found using the [[Chinese remainder theorem]]. If each pair of progressions in a family of doubly infinite arithmetic progressions have a non-empty intersection, then there exists a number common to all of them; that is, infinite arithmetic progressions form a [[Helly family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''The C.A.N''' (Convenient, Attractive, Normal) '''approach''' to eating behavior reveals three different ways or strategies that [[consumer psychology]] can be used to provide an organized framework to help people make healthier food choices.  The C is for convenient, the A is for attractive, and the N is for normal.  The idea was researched and created by Brian Wansink, Director of the Cornell Food and Brand Lab and others at Cornell University.   The researchers reviewed over 100 studies and found three things help people choose healthier foods.  The food must be convenient (C), attractive (A) and normal (N), or CAN.  The idea behind the CAN approach is to make foods like fruits and vegetables visible and easy to reach (convenient), nicely displayed (attractive), and look like a good choice (normal).
In a study, published in Psychology and Marketing, showed that when fruit is put in a nice bowl in your home on the counter—it becomes more convenient, attractive, and normal to grab a banana or orange, rather than the chocolate ice cream in the hidden back of the freezer.  Therefore, the CAN idea helps make healthier eating choices easier.
The results of this study are intended to help consumers make healthier decisions by adjusting the way they select and serve their food. The authors suggest these organizational frameworks can be used to show how research can help transform consumer eating environments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25517">'''Collective security''' can be understood as a security [[treaty|arrangement]], political, regional, or global, in which each state in the system accepts that the [[security]] of one is the concern of all, and therefore commits to a collective response to threats to, and breaches to peace. Collective security is more ambitious than systems of [[military alliance|alliance security]] or collective defense in that it seeks to encompass the totality of states within a region or indeed globally, and to address a wide range of possible threats. While collective security is an idea with a long history, its implementation in practice has proved problematic. Several prerequisites have to be met for it to have a chance of working. It is the theory or practice of states pledging to defend one another in order to deter aggression or to exterminate transgressor if international order has been breached.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/979008143|title=Global politics|last=Macmillan.|first=Palgrave|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137349262|oclc=979008143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early mentions===

Collective security is one of the most promising approaches for peace and a valuable device for [[Power (social and political)|power]] management on an [[international]] scale. [[Cardinal Richelieu]] proposed a scheme for collective security in 1629, which was partially reflected in the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. In the eighteenth century many proposals were made for collective security arrangements, especially in Europe.

The concept of a peaceful community of nations was outlined in 1795 in [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/kant/kant1.htm|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=Mount Holyoke College| title=Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch|accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant outlined the idea of a league of nations that would control conflict and promote peace between states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Western Thought:from Ancient Greece to the Twentieth Century|last1=Skirbekk|first1=Gunnar|authorlink1=Gunnar Skirbekk|last2=Gilje|first2=Nils|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|edition=illustrated|isbn=978-0-415-22073-6|page=288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NoLAHXt4PRMC|accessdate=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he argues for the establishment of a peaceful world community not in a sense that there be a [[global government]] but in the hope that each state would declare itself as a free state that respects its citizens and welcomes foreign visitors as fellow rational beings. His key argument is that a union of free states would promote peaceful society worldwide: therefore, in his view, there can be a perpetual peace shaped by the international community rather than by a world government.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.constitution.org/kant/perpeace.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

International co-operation to promote collective security originated in the [[Concert of Europe]] that developed after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in the nineteenth century in an attempt to maintain the ''status quo'' between European states and so avoid war.{{sfn|Reichard|2006|p=9}}{{sfn|Rapoport|1995|pp=498–500}}  This period also saw the development of international law with the first [[Geneva Conventions]] establishing laws about humanitarian relief during war and the international [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]] of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes.{{sfn|Bouchet-Saulnier|Brav|Olivier|2007|pp=14–134}}{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=10}}

The forerunner of the League of Nations, the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] (IPU), was formed by peace activists [[William Randal Cremer]] and [[Frédéric Passy]] in 1889. The organization was international in scope with a third of the members of [[parliament]], in the 24 countries with parliaments, serving as members of the IPU by 1914. Its aims were to encourage governments to solve international disputes by peaceful means and arbitration and annual conferences were held to help governments refine the process of international arbitration. The IPU's structure consisted of a Council headed by a President which would later be reflected in the structure of the League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Before the League of Nations|publisher=The United Nations Office at Geneva|url=http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/(httpPages)/B5B92952225993B0C1256F2D00393560?OpenDocument|accessdate =2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the twentieth century two power blocs emerged through alliances between the European [[Great Powers]]. It was these alliances that came into effect at the [[Origins of World War I|start of the First World War]] in 1914, drawing all the major European powers into the war. This was the first major war in Europe between [[industrialized]] countries and the first time in Western Europe the results of [[industrialization]] (for example [[mass production]]) had been dedicated to war. The result of this [[industrial warfare]] was an unprecedented casualty level with eight and a half million members of [[armed services]] dead, an estimated 21 million wounded, and approximately 10 million civilian deaths.{{sfn|Bell|2007|pp=15–17}}{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=1–2}}

By the time the fighting ended in November 1918, the war had had a profound impact, affecting the social, political and economic systems of [[Europe]] and inflicting psychological and physical damage on the continent.{{sfn|Bell|2007|p=16}} Anti-war sentiment rose across the world; the First World War was described as "[[The war to end war|the war to end all wars]]",{{sfn|Archer|2001|p=14}}{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=1}} and its possible causes were vigorously investigated. The causes identified included [[arms race]]s, alliances, secret diplomacy, and the freedom of sovereign states to enter into war for their own benefit. The perceived remedies to these were seen as the creation of an international organization whose aim was to prevent future war through [[disarmament]], open diplomacy, international co-operation, restrictions on the right to wage wars, and penalties that made war unattractive to nations.{{sfn|Bell|2007|p=8}}

==Theory==
Collective security can be understood as a security arrangement in which all states cooperate collectively to provide security for all by the actions of all against any states within the groups which might challenge the existing order by using force. This contrasts with self-help strategies of engaging in war for purely immediate national interest. While collective security is possible, several prerequisites have to be met for it to work.

Collective Security also contrasts with [[Alliance|alliances]] in term of different forms. In Ph.D dissertation of Andreatta, collective security is based on the perspective of all together in a group against any one rather than on [[Unilateralism|unilateral]] idea of some against specific others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andreatta|first=Filippo|date=Summer 1996|title=Collective security: Theory and practice of an institution for peace in the XX century.|url=|journal=Collective Security|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alliance has the form of two groups against each other as like states A+B+C against states Y+Z; however, collective security system takes form of conducting one agreement between A+B+C+Y+Z against any one of them. Moreover, it is also different from alliance since collective security is built to focus on internal regulation required universal membership while alliance is built to deter or reduce an outside threat as an exclusive institution. For alliance, states would see their allies as [[Absolute gain (international relations)|absolute gain]] and their enemies as [[Relative gain (international relations)|relative gains]] without [[legal obligation]]. In contrast, collective security follows the case of neutrality as the whole group would be required to punish the aggressor with the hope for it not to violate general norms, in which are beyond the states' control rather than by their self-interests. Opposite with short term interest of allies fighting for a common threat, collective security tends to use universal interests for [[global peace]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Sovereign nations eager to maintain the status quo, willingly cooperate, accepting a degree of vulnerability and in some cases of minor nations, also accede to the interests of the chief contributing nations organising the collective security. Collective Security is achieved by setting up an international cooperative organisation, under the auspices of international law and this gives rise to a form of international collective governance, albeit limited in scope and effectiveness. The collective security organisation then becomes an arena for diplomacy, balance of power and exercise of soft power. The use of hard power by states, unless legitimised by the Collective Security organisation, is considered illegitimate, reprehensible and needing remediation of some kind. The collective security organisation not only gives cheaper security, but also may be the only practicable means of security for smaller nations against more powerful threatening neighbours without the need of joining the camp of the nations balancing their neighbours.

The concept of "collective security" forwarded by men such as [[Michael Joseph Savage]], [[Martin Wight]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Woodrow Wilson]], are deemed to apply interests in security in a broad manner, to "avoid grouping powers into opposing camps, and refusing to draw dividing lines that would leave anyone out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=NATO Transformed: The Alliance's New Roles in International Security|last=Yost|first=David S.|publisher=Leicester University Press|year=1977|location=London|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "collective security" has also been cited as a principle of the [[United Nations]], and the [[League of Nations]] before that. By employing a system of collective security, the UN hopes to dissuade any member state from acting in a manner likely to threaten peace, thereby avoiding any conflict.

Collective security selectively incorporates the concept of both [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] and [[global government]]. However, the term "Collective Security" is not the same as Balance of power, mentioned in [[Realism (international relations)|Realism theory]]. According to Adreatta, balance of power focuses on state's unilateral interests stoping aggression. Since states look at the world as having security dilemma due to the fear of relative gain, state does not want any state to become predominant causing a mutually restraining equilibrium. In other word, Balance of power between states opts for decentralization of power. States are separate actors who do not subordinate their [[autonomy]] or sovereignty to a central. "Singly or in combinations reflecting the coincidence of interests, States seek to influence the pattern of power distribution and to determine their own places within that pattern."&lt;ref&gt;I.L. Claude, Jr., "The Management of Power in the Changing United Nations", ''International Organization'', Vol. 15 (Spring 1961), pp. 219–221&lt;/ref&gt; The expectation of order and peace comes from the belief that competing powers will somehow balance and thereby cancel each other out to produce “deterrence through equilibration.”&lt;ref name="Claude_222"&gt;Claude, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, under collective security, states share the long term goal of global peace, reversing relationship between individual and community goals mentioned in Balance of Power theories. Balance of power fails to maintain stability led to break down of war as in the case of Napoleonic Wars and World Wars when states unilaterally decided to be unwilling or unable to fight. 

At the same time, the concept of global government is about centralization. Global government is a centralized institutional system that possesses the power use of force like a well established sovereign nation state. This concept strips states of their "standing as centers of power and policy, where issues of war and peace are concerned,"&lt;ref name="Claude_222" /&gt; and superimposing on them "an institution possessed of the authority and capability to maintain, by unchallengeable force so far as may be necessary, the order and stability of a global community."&lt;ref name="Claude_222" /&gt; Despite some different characteristics of balance of power theory, collective Collective security selectively incorporates both of the concepts, centralization and decentralization, which can broil down to a phrase: "order without government."&lt;ref&gt;I. L. Claude, Jr. "An Autopsy of Collective Security", ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 90 (Winter 1975–76), p. 715&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, collective security seems to be more reliable alternative since it gathers power as a team to punish the aggressor, and it is an attempt to improve international relations and to provide solid rules under [[Anarchy|anarchy.]] 

===Basic assumptions===
Organski (1960) lists five basic assumptions underlying the theory of collective security:&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in Ghosh (1960), pg 89. Paraphrased.&lt;/ref&gt;

* In an armed conflict, member nation-states will be able to agree on which nation is the aggressor.
* All member nation-states are equally committed to contain and constrain the aggression, irrespective of its source or origin.
* All member nation-states have identical freedom of action and ability to join in proceedings against the aggressor.
* The cumulative power of the cooperating members of the alliance for collective security will be adequate and sufficient to overpower the might of the aggressor.
* In the light of the threat posed by the collective might of the nations of a collective security coalition, the aggressor nation will modify its policies, or if unwilling to do so, will be defeated.

===Prerequisites===
Morgenthau (1948) states that three prerequisites must be met for collective security to successfully prevent war:

* The collective security system must be able to assemble military force in strength greatly in excess to that assembled by the aggressor(s) thereby deterring the aggressor(s) from attempting to change the world order defended by the collective security system.
* Those nations, whose combined strength would be used for deterrence as mentioned in the first prerequisite, should have identical beliefs about the security of the world order that the collective is defending.
* Nations must be willing to subordinate their conflicting interests to the common good defined in terms of the common defense of all member-states.

===In the League of Nations===
After World War I, the first large scale attempt to provide collective security in modern times was the establishment of the [[League of Nations]] in 1919–20. The provisions of the League of Nations Covenant represented a weak system for decision-making and for collective action. According to Palmer and Perking, they pointed failure of United States in joining League of Nations and the rise of USSR outside the League as one of major reasons why it was failed under enforcement of collective security&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ebegbulem|first=Joseph C|date=2011|title=The Failure of Collective Security in the Post World Wars I and II International System|url=https://www2.hu-berlin.de/transcience/Vol2_Issue2_2011_23_29.pdf|journal=Journal of Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin|volume=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, an example of the failure of the League of Nations' collective security is the [[Manchurian Crisis]], when [[Japan]] occupied part of [[China]] (which was a League member). After the invasion, members of the League passed a resolution calling for Japan to withdraw or face severe penalties. Given that every nation on the League of Nations council had veto power, Japan promptly vetoed the resolution, severely limiting the LN's ability to respond. After one year of deliberation, the League passed a resolution condemning the invasion without committing the League's members to any action against it. The Japanese replied by quitting the League.

[[Abyssinia Crisis|A similar process]] occurred in 1935, when [[Italy]] invaded [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] (now [[Ethiopia]]). Sanctions were passed, but Italy would have vetoed any stronger resolution. Additionally, Britain and France sought to court Italy's government as a potential deterrent to Hitler, given that Mussolini was not yet in what would become the Axis alliance of [[World War II]]. Thus, neither enforced any serious sanctions against the Italian government. Additionally, in this case and with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, the absence of the United States from the League of Nations deprived it of another major power that could have used economic leverage against either of the aggressor states. Inaction by the League subjected it to criticisms that it was weak and concerned more with European issues (most leading members were European), and it did not deter Hitler from his plans to dominate Europe. Ethiopian Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]] continued to support collective security, as he assessed that impotence lay not in the principle but in its covenantors' commitment to honor its tenets.

One active and articulate exponent of collective security during the immediate pre-war years was the Soviet foreign minister, [[Maxim Litvinov]]. However, there are grounds for doubt about the depth of Soviet commitment to the principle as well as that of Western powers. After the [[Munich Agreement]] in September 1938 and the passivity of outside powers in the face of German occupation of the remainder of [[Czechoslovakia]] in March 1939, it was shown that the Western powers were not prepared to engage in collective security against aggression by the Axis powers together with the Soviet Union, Soviet foreign policy was revised and Litvinov was replaced as foreign minister in early May 1939 to facilitate the negotiations that led to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] with Germany, signed by Litvinov's successor, [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], on August 23 of that year. The war in Europe broke out a week later, with the [[invasion of Poland]], starting on September 1, 1939. Thus, this could be seen that collective security does not always work due to the lack of commitment and unwillingness of states or International Community to act in concert (Mingst 1999).

=== Under United Nations and recent events ===
The 1945 [[United Nations Charter]], although containing stronger provisions for decision-making and collective military action than those of the League of Nations Covenant, does not represent a complete system of collective security, but rather a balance between collective action on the one hand and continued operation of the states system (including the continued special roles of great powers) on the other. States in UN collective security system are selective to support or oppose UN action in certain conflicts based on their self-interests. United Nations can be somehow seen as the platform for self-interest purposes for members in Security Council due to their Veto power and excessive assistance or aid. This has made those states to act unilaterally ignoring the approval, or flout orders of Security Council not to act unilaterally. The [[Iraq crisis]] is a clearer example as “Rather than seek the global interest of peace and security through stability in Iraq and the Middle East region, the domination oriented members amassed their vast economic, diplomatic and military resources, captured and brazenly subjugated Iraq to an unprecedented condominial regime serving their economic interest under Iraq Reconstruction Programme.” (Eke, 2007)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, lack of geographical spread of members in Security Council causes unbalancing on the role of maintenance global peace and security. The voices of small countries can be only heard, but not all policies were adopted in response to them unless they serves the great powers' interests.  

However, this does not mean collective security in the UN is completely fail. The role of the UN and collective security in general is evolving, given the rise of [[Civil war|internal state conflict]]s. Since the end of World War II, there have been 111 military conflicts worldwide, but only 9 of these have involved two or more states going to war with one another. The remainder have either been internal civil wars or civil wars where other [[nation]]s intervened in some manner. This means that collective security may have to evolve towards providing a means to ensure stability and a fair international resolution to those internal conflicts. Whether this will involve more powerful peacekeeping forces, or a larger role for the UN diplomatically, will likely be judged on a case-by-case basis. 

==Collective defense==
Collective defense is an arrangement, usually formalized by a treaty and an organization, among participant states that commit support in defense of a member state if it is attacked by another state outside the organization. [[NATO]] is the best known collective defense organization; its famous Article 5 calls on (but does not fully commit) member states to assist another member under attack. This article was invoked after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]] on the [[United States]], after which other NATO members provided assistance to the US [[War on Terror]] in [[Afghanistan]].

Collective defense has its roots in multiparty [[Political alliance|alliances]] and entails benefits as well as risks. On the one hand, by combining and pooling resources, it can reduce any single state's cost of providing fully for its security. Smaller members of NATO, for example, have leeway to invest a greater proportion of their budget on non-military priorities, such as education or health, since they can count on other members to come to their defense, if needed.

On the other hand, collective defense also involves risky commitments. Member states can become embroiled in costly wars benefiting neither the direct victim nor the aggressor. In [[World War I]], countries in the collective defense arrangement known as the [[Triple Entente]] ([[French Third Republic|France]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]]) were pulled into war quickly when Russia started full mobilization against [[Austria-Hungary]], whose ally [[German Empire|Germany]] subsequently declared war on Russia.

'''Compartmental models''' are a technique used to simplify the [[mathematical modelling of infectious disease]]. The population is divided into compartments, with the assumption that every individual in the same compartment has the same characteristics. Its origin is in the early 20th century, with an important early work being that of [[Kermack–McKendrick theory|Kermack and McKendrick in 1927]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kermack WO, McKendrick AG |title=A Contribution to the Mathematical Theory of Epidemics |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A |volume=115 |issue=772 |pages=700–721 |date=August 1, 1927 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1927.0118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The models are usually investigated through ordinary differential equations (which are deterministic), but can also be viewed in a stochastic framework, which is more realistic but also more complicated to analyse.

Compartmental models may be used to predict properties of how a disease spreads, for example the prevalence (total number of infected) or the duration of an epidemic. Also, the model allows for understanding how different situations may affect the outcome of the epidemic, e.g., what the most efficient technique is for issuing a limited number of vaccines in a given population.

==The SIR model==

The '''SIR model''' is one of the simplest compartmental models, and many models are derivations of this basic form. The model consists of three compartments– '''S''' for the number '''s'''usceptible, '''I''' for the number of '''i'''nfectious, and '''R''' for the number '''r'''ecovered (or immune). This model is reasonably predictive for infectious diseases which are transmitted from human to human, and where recovery confers lasting resistance, such as [[measles]], [[mumps]] and [[rubella]].
[[File:SIR model simulated using python.gif|thumb|Spatial SIR model simulation. Each cell can infect its eight immediate neighbors.]]

These variables ('''S''', '''I''', and '''R''') represent the number of people in each compartment at a particular time. To represent that the number of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals may vary over time (even if the total population size remains constant), we make the precise numbers a function of ''t'' (time): '''S'''(''t''), '''I'''(''t'') and '''R'''(''t''). For a specific disease in a specific population, these functions may be worked out in order to predict possible outbreaks and bring them under control.

===The SIR model is dynamic in three senses===

As implied by the variable function of ''t'', the model is dynamic in that the numbers in each compartment may fluctuate over time. The importance of this dynamic aspect is most obvious in an [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] disease with a short infectious period, such as [[measles]] in the UK prior to the introduction of a [[vaccination|vaccine]] in 1968. Such diseases tend to occur in cycles of outbreaks due to the variation in number of susceptibles (S(''t'')) over time. During an [[epidemic]], the number of susceptible individuals falls rapidly as more of them are infected and thus enter the infectious and recovered compartments. The disease cannot break out again until the number of susceptibles has built back up as a result of offspring being born into the susceptible compartment.
[[File:Sirsys-p9.png|thumb|Blue=Susceptible, Green=Infected, and Red=Recovered]]
Each member of the population typically progresses from susceptible to infectious to recovered. This can be shown as a flow diagram in which the boxes represent the different compartments and the arrows the transition between compartments, i.e.
[[File:SIR.PNG|center|frameless|220x220px]]

===Transition rates===

For the full specification of the model, the arrows should be labeled with the transition rates between compartments. Between S and I, the transition rate is βI, where β is the contact rate, which takes into account the probability of getting the disease in a contact between a susceptible and an infectious subject.

Between I and R, the transition rate is γ (simply the rate of recovery or death). If the duration of the infection is denoted ''D'', then γ = 1/''D'', since an individual experiences one recovery in ''D'' units of time.

It's assumed that the permanence of each single subject in the epidemic states is a random variable with exponential distribution. More complex and realistic distributions (such as [[Erlang distribution]]) can be equally used with few modifications.

==Bio-mathematical deterministic treatment of the SIR model==

===The SIR model without vital dynamics===

The dynamics of an epidemic, for example the [[Influenza|flu]], are often much faster than the dynamics of birth and death, therefore, birth and death are often omitted in simple compartmental models.  The SIR system without so-called vital dynamics (birth and death, sometimes called demography) described above can be expressed by the following set of ordinary [[differential equations]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hethcote H |title=The Mathematics of Infectious Diseases |journal=SIAM Review |volume=42  |issue= 4|pages=599–653 |year=2000 |url=http://leonidzhukov.net/hse/2014/socialnetworks/papers/2000SiamRev.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = - \frac{\beta I S}{N} &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{\beta I S}{N}- \gamma I &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I &lt;/math&gt;.

This model was for the first time proposed by O. Kermack and [[Anderson Gray McKendrick]] as a special case of what we now call [[Kermack-McKendrick theory]], and followed work McKendrick had done with [[Ronald Ross]].

This system is [[non-linear]], and does not admit a generic [[analytic solution]]. Nevertheless, significant results can be derived analytically, and with Monte Carlo methods, such as the [[Gillespie algorithm]].

Firstly note that from:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} + \frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{dR}{dt}  = 0  &lt;/math&gt;,

it follows that:

:&lt;math&gt; S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = \textrm{Constant} = N  &lt;/math&gt;,

expressing in mathematical terms the constancy of population &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt;. Note that the above relationship implies that one need only study the equation for two of the three variables.

Secondly, we note that the dynamics of the infectious class depends on the following ratio:
:&lt;math&gt; R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma} &lt;/math&gt;,
the so-called [[basic reproduction number]] (also called basic reproduction ratio). This ratio is derived as the expected number of new infections (these new infections are sometimes called secondary infections) from a single infection in a population where all subjects are susceptible.&lt;ref name=Bailey1975&gt;{{cite book |author=Bailey, Norman T. J. |title=The mathematical theory of infectious diseases and its applications |publisher=Griffin |location=London |year=1975 |isbn=0-85264-231-8 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nunn2006&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sonia Altizer |author2=Nunn, Charles |title=Infectious diseases in primates: behavior, ecology and evolution |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2006 |isbn=0-19-856585-2 |series=Oxford Series in Ecology and Evolution}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea can probably be more readily seen if we say that the typical time between contacts is &lt;math&gt; T_{c} = \beta^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, and the typical time until recovery is &lt;math&gt; T_{r} = \gamma^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. From here it follows that, on average, the number of contacts by an infected individual with others ''before'' the infected has recovered is: &lt;math&gt; T_{r}/T_{c}. &lt;/math&gt;

By dividing the first differential equation by the third, [[Separation of variables|separating the variables]] and integrating we get
:&lt;math&gt; S(t) = S(0) e^{-R_0(R(t) - R(0))/N} &lt;/math&gt;,
(where &lt;math&gt;S(0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R(0)&lt;/math&gt; are the initial numbers of, respectively, susceptible and removed subjects). Thus, in the limit &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow +\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the proportion of recovered individuals obeys the following [[transcendental equation]]
:&lt;math&gt; R_{\infty} = N - S(0)e^{-R_0(R_{\infty} - R(0))/N} &lt;/math&gt;.
This equation shows that at the end of an epidemic, unless &lt;math&gt;S(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;, not all individuals of the population have recovered, so some must remain susceptible. This means that the end of an epidemic is caused by the decline in the number of infected individuals rather than an absolute lack of susceptible subjects.
The role of the [[basic reproduction number]] is extremely important. In fact, upon rewriting the equation for infectious individuals as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = (R_0 S/N  - 1) \gamma I &lt;/math&gt;,
it yields that if:
:&lt;math&gt; R_{0} &gt; \frac{N}{S(0)} ,&lt;/math&gt;
then:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt}(0) &gt;0 ,&lt;/math&gt;
i.e., there will be a proper epidemic outbreak with an increase of the number of the  infectious (which can reach a considerable fraction of the population). On the contrary, if
:&lt;math&gt; R_{0} &lt; \frac{N}{S(0)} ,&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt}(0) &lt;0 ,&lt;/math&gt;
i.e., independently from the initial size of the susceptible population the disease can never cause a proper epidemic outbreak. As a consequence, it is clear that the [[basic reproduction number]]  is extremely important.

===The force of infection===

Note that in the above model the function:

:&lt;math&gt; F = \beta I ,&lt;/math&gt;

models the transition rate from the compartment of susceptible individuals to the compartment of infectious individuals, so that it is called the force of infection. However, for large classes of communicable diseases it is more realistic to consider a force of infection that does not depend on the absolute number of infectious subjects, but on their fraction (with respect to the total constant population &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt; F = \beta \frac{I}{N} .&lt;/math&gt;

Capasso and, afterwards, other authors have proposed nonlinear forces of infection to model more realistically the contagion process.

===Exact analytical solutions to the SIR model===
In 2014, Harko T. et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harko T., Lobo F.S.N., and Mak M.K. |title=Exact analytical solutions of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model and of the SIR model with equal death and birth rates. |journal=Applied Mathematics and Computation |volume=236 |pages=184–194 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; derived an exact analytical solution to the SIR model. In the without vital dynamics setup, for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}(u)=S(t)&lt;/math&gt;, etc., it corresponds to the following time parametrization

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}(u)= S(0)u &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(u)= N -R(0) + \rho \ln(u)-S(0)u &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}(u)=R(0) -\rho \ln(u)&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;t= \int_u^1 \frac{N}{\beta s(N -R(0)+\rho \ln (s)-S(0)s)} ds&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{\gamma N}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;, with initial conditions &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{S}(1),\mathcal{I}(1),\mathcal{R}(1))=(S(0),N -R(0)-S(0),R(0));&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;u_T&lt;u&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;u_T&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(u_T)=0&lt;/math&gt;. By the transcendental equation for &lt;math&gt;R_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; above, it follows that &lt;math&gt;u_T=e^{-(R_{\infty}-R(0))/\rho}(=S_{\infty}/S(0)&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;S(0) \neq 0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_{\infty}=0&lt;/math&gt;.

An equivalent analytical solution was found by Miller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Miller, J.C. | title = A note on the derivation of epidemic final sizes | journal = Bulletin of Mathematical Biology | volume = 74 | year=2012 | at= section 4.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Miller, J.C. | title = Mathematical models of SIR disease spread with combined non-sexual and sexual transmission routes | journal = Infectious Disease Modelling | volume = 2 | year=2017 | at = section 2.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; yields

:&lt;math&gt; S(t) = S(0) e^{-\xi(t)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; I(t) = N-S(t)-R(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R(t) = R(0) + N\frac{\gamma}{\beta} \xi(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \xi(t) = \frac{\beta \int_0^t I(t^*) \, dt^*}{N}&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\xi(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted as the expected number of transmissions an individual has received by time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  The two solutions are related by &lt;math&gt;e^{-\xi(t)} = u&lt;/math&gt;.

Effectively the same result can be found in the original work by Kermack and McKendrick &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kermack WO, McKendrick AG |title=A Contribution to the Mathematical Theory of Epidemics |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A |volume=115 |issue=772 |date=August 1, 1927 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1927.0118 | at = pg 713}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
===The SIR model with vital dynamics and constant population===
Considering a population characterized by a death rate &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and birth rate &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and where a communicable disease is spreading. The model with mass-action transmission is:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = \Lambda - \mu S - \beta I S &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = \beta I S - \gamma I -\mu I &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I  - \mu R &lt;/math&gt;

for which the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(S(t),I(t),R(t)\right) =\left(\frac{\Lambda}{\mu},0,0\right).&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, we can derive a [[basic reproduction number]] :
:&lt;math&gt; R_0 = \frac{ \beta\Lambda }{\mu(\mu+\gamma)}, &lt;/math&gt;
which has threshold properties. In fact, independently from biologically meaningful initial values, one can show that:

:&lt;math&gt; R_0 \le 1 \Rightarrow  \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \left(S(t),I(t),R(t)\right) = \textrm{DFE} = \left(\frac{\Lambda}{\mu},0,0\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; R_0 &gt; 1 , I(0)&gt; 0 \Rightarrow  \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \left(S(t),I(t),R(t)\right) = \textrm{EE} = \left(\frac{\gamma+\mu}{\beta},\frac{\mu}{\beta}\left(R_0-1\right),\frac{\gamma}{\beta} \left(R_0-1\right)\right). &lt;/math&gt;

The point EE is called the Endemic Equilibrium. With heuristic arguments, one may show that &lt;math&gt;R_{0}&lt;/math&gt; may be read as the average number of infections caused by a single infectious subject in a wholly susceptible population, the above relationship biologically means that if this number is less or equal than one the disease goes extinct, whereas if this number is greater than one the disease will remain permanently endemic in the population.

==The SIS model==
[[File:Sissys.png|thumb|Susceptibles and infected get equilibrated.]]
Some infections, for example those from the [[common cold]] and [[influenza]], do not confer any long lasting immunity. Such infections do not give immunization upon recovery from infection, and individuals become susceptible again.

[[File:SIS.PNG|400px|center|SIS compartmental model]]

We have the model:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = - \frac{\beta S I}{N} + \gamma I &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{\beta S I}{N} - \gamma I &lt;/math&gt;

Note that denoting with N the total population it holds that:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dS}{dt} + \frac{dI}{dt} = 0 \Rightarrow S(t)+I(t) = N&lt;/math&gt;
it follows that:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = \left( \beta N - \gamma\right)  I - \beta I^2 &lt;/math&gt;
i.e. the dynamics of infectious is ruled by a logistic equation, so that &lt;math&gt;\forall I(0) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;   \frac{\beta N}{\gamma} \le 1 \Rightarrow \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty}I(t)=0  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;   \frac{\beta N}{\gamma} &gt; 1 \Rightarrow \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty}I(t)=\frac{\beta N - \gamma}{\beta}  &lt;/math&gt;

Fortunately, it is possible to find an analytical solution to this model (by making a transformation of variables: &lt;math&gt;I = y^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and substituting this into the mean-field equations),&lt;ref name=Hethcote1989&gt;{{cite book |author=Hethcote, H. W. |title=in Three Basic Epidemiological Models, Applied Mathematical Ecology, Vol. 18 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; such that the basic reproduction rate is greater than unity. The solution is given as
:&lt;math&gt;I(t) = \frac{I_\infty}{1+V e^{-\chi(t-t_0)}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I_\infty = (\beta N -\gamma)/\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the endemic infected population, &lt;math&gt;\chi = \gamma-\beta&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;V = I_\infty/I_0 - 1&lt;/math&gt;. As the system is assumed to be closed, the susceptible population is then &lt;math&gt;S(t) = N - I(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Elaborations on the basic SIR model==

===The MSIR model===

For many infections, including [[measles]], babies are not born into the susceptible compartment but are immune to the disease for the first few months of life due to protection from maternal antibodies (passed across the [[placenta]] and additionally through [[colostrum]]). This is called [[passive immunity]]. This added detail can be shown by including an M class (for maternally derived immunity) at the beginning of the model

[[File:MSIR.PNG|800px|center|MSIR compartmental model]]To indicate this mathematically, an additional compartment is added, M(t), which results in the following differential equations:
:: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dM}{dT} = B - \delta M - \mu M&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dS}{dT} = \delta M - \beta SI - \mu S&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dI}{dT} = \beta SI - \gamma I - \mu I&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dR}{dT} = \gamma I - \mu R&lt;/math&gt;

===Carrier state===

Some people who have had an infectious disease such as [[tuberculosis]] never completely recover and continue to [[asymptomatic carrier|carry]] the infection, whilst not suffering the disease themselves. They may then move back into the infectious compartment and suffer symptoms (as in tuberculosis) or they may continue to infect others in their carrier state, while not suffering symptoms. The most famous example of this is probably [[Mary Mallon]], who infected 22 people with [[typhoid fever]]. The carrier compartment is labelled C.

===The SEIR model===

For many important infections there is a significant incubation period during which the individual has been infected but is not yet infectious themselves. During this period the individual is in compartment E (for exposed).

[[File:SEIR.PNG|800px|center|SEIR compartmental model]]

Assuming that the incubation period is a random variable with exponential distribution with
parameter a (i.e. the average incubation period is &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;), and also assuming the presence of vital dynamics with birth rate equal to death rate, we have the model:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = \mu N - \mu S - \beta \frac{I}{N} S &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dE}{dt} = \beta \frac{I}{N} S - (\mu +a ) E &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = a E - (\gamma +\mu ) I &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I  - \mu R. &lt;/math&gt;

We have &lt;math&gt;S+E+I+R=N&lt;/math&gt;, but this is only constant because of the (degenerate) assumption that birth and death rates are equal; in general &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is a variable.

For this model, the basic reproduction number is:

&lt;math&gt;R_0 = \frac{a}{\mu+a}\frac{\beta}{\mu+\gamma}.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly to the SIR model, also in this case we have a Disease-Free-Equilibrium (N,0,0,0) and an Endemic Equilibrium EE, and one can show that, independently form biologically meaningful initial conditions

:&lt;math&gt; \left(S(0),E(0),I(0),R(0)\right) \in \left\{(S,E,I,R)\in [0,N]^4 : S \ge 0, E \ge 0, I\ge 0, R\ge 0, S+E+I+R = N \right\}   &lt;/math&gt;

it holds that:

:&lt;math&gt; R_0 \le 1 \Rightarrow  \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty} \left(S(t),E(t),I(t),R(t)\right) = DFE = \left(N,0,0,0\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; R_0 &gt; 1 , I(0)&gt; 0 \Rightarrow  \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty} \left(S(t),E(t),I(t),R(t)\right) = EE. &lt;/math&gt;

In case of periodically varying contact rate &lt;math&gt;\beta(t)&lt;/math&gt; the condition for the global attractiveness of DFE is that the following linear system with periodic coefficients:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dE_1}{dt} = \beta(t) I_1 - (\gamma +a ) E_1 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI_1}{dt} = a E_1 - (\gamma +\mu ) I_1 &lt;/math&gt;
is stable (i.e. it has its Floquet's eigenvalues inside the unit circle in the complex plane).

=== The SEIS model ===
The SEIS model takes into consideration the exposed or latent period of the disease, giving an additional compartment, E(t).
:::&lt;math&gt;{\color{blue}{\mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{I} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}}}&lt;/math&gt;
In this model an infection does not leave any immunity thus individuals that have recovered return to being susceptible again, moving back into the ''S''(''t'') compartment.  The following differential equations describe this model:
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dS}{dT} = B - \beta SI - \mu S + \gamma I&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dE}{dT} = \beta SI - (\epsilon + \mu)E&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dI}{dT} = \varepsilon E - (\gamma + \mu)I&lt;/math&gt;

=== The MSEIR model ===
For the case of a disease, with the factors of passive immunity, and a latency period there is the MSEIR model.
:::&lt;math&gt;{\color{blue}{\mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{I} \rightarrow \mathcal{R}}}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dM}{dT} = B - \delta M - \mu M &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dS}{dT}  = \delta M - \beta SI - \mu S &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dE}{dT}  = \beta SI - (\varepsilon + \mu)E &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dI}{dT}  = \varepsilon E - (\gamma + \mu)I &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dR}{dT}  = \gamma I - \mu R&lt;/math&gt;

=== The MSEIRS model ===
An MSEIRS model is similar to the MSEIR, but the immunity in the R class would be temporary, so that individuals would regain their susceptibility when the temporary immunity ended.
:::&lt;math&gt;{\color{blue}{\mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{I} \rightarrow \mathcal{R} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Variable contact rates and pluriannual or chaotic epidemics===
It is well known that the probability of getting a disease is not constant in the time. Some diseases are seasonal, such as the [[Coronavirus|common cold viruses]], which are more prevalent during winter.  With childhood diseases, such as measles, mumps, and rubella, there is a strong correlation with the school calendar, so that during the school holidays the probability of getting such a disease dramatically decreases.

As a consequence, for many classes of diseases one should consider a force of infection with periodically ('seasonal') varying contact rate
:&lt;math&gt; F = \beta(t) \frac{I}{N} , \beta(t+T)=\beta(t)&lt;/math&gt;
with period T equal to one year.

Thus, our model becomes

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = \mu N - \mu S - \beta(t) \frac{I}{N} S &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = \beta(t) \frac{I}{N} S - (\gamma +\mu ) I &lt;/math&gt;

(the dynamics of recovered easily follows from &lt;math&gt;R=N-S-I&lt;/math&gt;), i.e. a nonlinear set of differential equations with periodically varying parameters. It is well known that this class of dynamical systems may undergo very interesting and complex phenomena of  nonlinear parametric resonance. It is easy to see that if:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T}\frac{\beta(t)}{\mu+\gamma}dt  &lt; 1 \Rightarrow  \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty} \left(S(t),I(t)\right) = DFE = \left(N,0\right), &lt;/math&gt;

whereas if the integral is greater than one the disease will not die out and there may be such resonances. For example, considering the periodically varying contact rate as the 'input' of the system one has that the output is a periodic function whose period is a multiple of the period of the input.
This allowed to give a contribution to explain the poly-annual (typically biennial) epidemic outbreaks of some infectious diseases as interplay between the period of the contact rate oscillations and the pseudo-period of the damped oscillations near the endemic equilibrium.
Remarkably, in some cases the behavior may also be quasi-periodic or even chaotic.

==Modelling vaccination==
The SIR model can be modified to model vaccination. Typically these introduce an additional compartment to the SIR model, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, for vaccinated individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chauhan|first=Sudipa|last2=Misra|first2=Om Prakash|last3=Dhar|first3=Joydip|date=2014|title=Stability Analysis of SIR Model with Vaccination|url=http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.ajcam.20140401.03.html#Sec3|journal=American Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics|language=en|volume=4|issue=1|pages=|issn=2165-8943|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below are some examples.

===Vaccinating newborns===
In presence of a communicable diseases, one of main tasks is that of eradicating it via  prevention measures and, if possible, via the establishment of a mass vaccination program. Let us consider a disease for which the newborn are vaccinated (with a vaccine giving lifelong immunity) at a rate &lt;math&gt;P \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = \mu N (1-P) - \mu S - \beta \frac{I}{N} S &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dI}{dt} = \beta \frac{I}{N} S - (\mu+\gamma)  I &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dV}{dt} = \mu N P - \mu V&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the class of vaccinated subjects. It is immediate to show that:

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty} V(t)= N P,&lt;/math&gt;

thus we shall deal with the long term behavior of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, for which it holds that:

:&lt;math&gt; R_0 (1-P) \le 1 \Rightarrow  \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty} \left(S(t),I(t)\right) = DFE = \left(N \left(1-P\right),0\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; R_0 (1-P) &gt; 1 , I(0)&gt; 0 \Rightarrow  \lim_{t \rightarrow +\infty} \left(S(t),I(t)\right) = EE = \left(\frac{N}{R_0(1-P)},N \left(R_0 (1-P)-1\right)\right). &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, if
:&lt;math&gt; P &lt; P^{*}= 1-\frac{1}{R_0}  &lt;/math&gt;
the vaccination program is not successful in eradicating the disease, on the contrary it will remain endemic, although at lower levels than the case of absence of vaccinations. This means that the mathematical model suggests that for a disease whose [[basic reproduction number]] may be as high as 18 one should have to vaccinate 94.4% of newborns in order to eradicate the disease.

===Vaccination and information===
Modern societies are facing the challenge of "rational" exemption, i.e. the family's decision to not vaccinate children as a consequence of a "rational" comparison between the perceived risk from infection and that from getting damages from the vaccine. In order to assess whether this behavior is really rational, i.e. if it can equally lead to the eradication of the disease,  one may simply assume that the vaccination rate is an increasing function of the number of infectious subjects:
:&lt;math&gt; P=P(I),P^{\prime}(I)&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;
In such a case the eradication condition becomes:
:&lt;math&gt; P(0) \ge P^{*},&lt;/math&gt;
i.e. the baseline vaccination rate should be greater than the "mandatory vaccination" threshold, which, in case of exemption, cannot hold. Thus, "rational" exemption might be myopic since it is based only on the current low incidence due to high vaccine coverage, instead taking into account future resurgence of infection due to coverage decline.

===Vaccination of non newborns===
In case there also are vaccinations of non newborn at a rate ρ the equation for the susceptible and vaccinated subject has to be modified as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = \mu N (1-P) - \mu S - \rho S - \beta \frac{I}{N} S &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dV}{dt} = \mu N P + \rho S - \mu V&lt;/math&gt;

leading to the following eradication condition:

:&lt;math&gt; P \ge 1- \left(1+\frac{\rho}{\mu}\right)\frac{1}{R_0}  &lt;/math&gt;

===Pulse vaccination strategy===
This strategy repeatedly vaccinates a defined age-cohort (such as young children or the elderly) in a susceptible population over time. Using this strategy, the block of susceptible individuals is then immediately removed, making it possible to eliminate an infectious disease, (such as measles), from the entire population. Every T time units a constant fraction p of susceptible subjects is vaccinated in a relatively short (with respect to the dynamics of the disease) time. This leads to the following impulsive differential equations for the susceptible and vaccinated subjects:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS}{dt} = \mu N  - \mu S - \beta \frac{I}{N} S, S(n T^+) = (1-p) S(n T^-) n=0,1,2,\dots &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dV}{dt} = - \mu V,   V(n T^+) = V(n T^-) + p S(n T^-) n=0,1,2,\dots&lt;/math&gt;

It is easy to see that by setting {{math|1=''I'' = 0}} one obtains that the dynamics of the susceptible subjects is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; S^*(t) = 1- \frac{p}{1-(1-p)E^{-\mu T}}E^{-\mu MOD(t,T)}  &lt;/math&gt;

and that the eradication condition is:

:&lt;math&gt; R_0 \int_{0}^{T}{S^*(t)dt} &lt; 1  &lt;/math&gt;

==The influence of age: age-structured models==
Age has a deep influence on the disease spread rate in a population, especially the contact rate. This rate summarizes the effectiveness of contacts between susceptible and infectious subjects. Taking into account the ages of the epidemic classes &lt;math&gt;s(t,a),i(t,a),r(t,a)&lt;/math&gt; (to limit ourselves to the susceptible-infectious-removed scheme) such that:

:&lt;math&gt;S(t)=\int_0^{a_M}{s(t,a)da}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I(t)=\int_0^{a_M}{i(t,a)da}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R(t)=\int_0^{a_M}{r(t,a)da}&lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt;a_M \le +\infty&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum admissible age)and their dynamics is not described, as one might think, by "simple" partial differential equations, but by [[integro-differential equation]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t s(t,a) + \partial_a s(t,a) = -\mu(a) s(a,t) - s(a,t)\int_{0}^{a_M}{k(a,a_1;t)i(a_1,t)da_1} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t i(t,a) + \partial_a i(t,a) =  s(a,t)\int_{0}^{a_M}{k(a,a_1;t)i(a_1,t)da_1}  -\mu(a) i(a,t) - \gamma(a)i(a,t)  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t r(t,a) + \partial_a r(t,a) =   -\mu(a) r(a,t) + \gamma(a)i(a,t)  &lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;F(a,t,i(\cdot,\cdot))=\int_{0}^{a_M}{k(a,a_1;t)i(a_1,t)da_1}&lt;/math&gt;

is the force of infection, which, of course, will depend, though the contact kernel &lt;math&gt; k(a,a_1;t) &lt;/math&gt; on the interactions between the ages.

Complexity is added by the initial conditions for newborns (i.e. for a=0), that are straightforward for infectious and removed:

:&lt;math&gt;i(t,0)=r(t,0)=0&lt;/math&gt;

but that are nonlocal for the density of susceptible newborns:

:&lt;math&gt;s(t,0)= \int_{0}^{a_M}{\left(\varphi_s(a) s(a,t)+\varphi_i(a) i(a,t)+\varphi_r(a) r(a,t)\right) da} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varphi_j(a), j=s,i,r&lt;/math&gt; are the fertilities of the adults.

Moreover, defining now the density of the total population &lt;math&gt;n(t,a)=s(t,a)+i(t,a)+r(t,a)&lt;/math&gt;  one obtains:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t n(t,a) + \partial_a n(t,a) = -\mu(a) n(a,t) &lt;/math&gt;

In the simplest case of equal fertilities in the three epidemic classes, we have that in oder to have demographic equilibrium the following necessary and sufficient condition linking the fertility &lt;math&gt;\varphi(.)&lt;/math&gt; with the mortality &lt;math&gt;\mu(a)&lt;/math&gt; must hold:

:&lt;math&gt; 1 = \int_0^{a_M}{\varphi(a) \exp\left(- \int_0^a{\mu(q)dq} \right)da } &lt;/math&gt;

and the demographic equilibrium is

:&lt;math&gt;n^*(a)=C \exp\left(- \int_0^a{\mu(q)dq}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

automatically ensuring the existence of the disease-free solution:

:&lt;math&gt;DFS(a)= \left(n^*(a),0,0\right).&lt;/math&gt;

A basic reproduction number can be calculated as the spectral radius of an appropriate functional operator.

== Other considerations within compartmental epidemic models ==

=== Vertical transmission ===
In the case of some diseases such as AIDS and Hepatitis B, it is possible for the offspring of infected parents to be born infected.  This transmission of the disease down from the mother is called Vertical Transmission.  The influx of additional members into the infected category can be considered within the model by including a fraction of the newborn members in the infected compartment.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Brauer, F. &amp; Castillo-Chávez, C. (2001).  ''Mathematical Models in Population Biology and Epidemiology.''  NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vector transmission ===
Diseases transmitted from human to human indirectly, i.e. malaria spread by way of mosquitoes, are transmitted through a vector.  In these cases, the infection transfers from human to insect and an epidemic model must include both species, generally requiring many more compartments than a model for direct transmission.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  For more information on this type of model see the reference ''Population Dynamics of Infectious Diseases:  Theory and Applications'', by R. M. Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, R. M. ed. (1982)  ''Population Dynamics of Infectious Diseases:  Theory and Applications'', Chapman and Hall, London-New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===
Other occurrences which may need to be considered when modeling an epidemic include things such as the following:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
:•	Nonhomogeneous mixing
:•	Variable infectivity
:•	Distributions that are spatially non-uniform
:•	Diseases caused by macroparasites

==Deterministic versus stochastic epidemic models==
It is important to stress that the deterministic models presented here are valid only in case of sufficiently large populations, and as such should be used cautiously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bartlett MS |title=Measles periodicity and community size |journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A |volume=120 |pages=48–70 |year=1957 |doi=10.2307/2342553 |issue=1 |jstor=2342553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be more precise, these models are only valid in the [[thermodynamic limit]], where the population is effectively infinite. In stochastic models, the long-time endemic equilibrium derived above, does not hold, as there is a finite probability that the number of infected individuals drops below one in a system. In a true system then, the pathogen may not propagate, as no host will be infected. But, in deterministic mean-field models, the number of infecteds can take on real, namely, non-integer values of infected hosts, and the pathogen may still persist in the system with a finite number of infected hosts, less than one but greater than zero.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The term '''composition''' (from Latin ''com-'' "with" and ''ponere'' "to place"), in written language, refers to the body of important features established by the [[author]] in their creation of [[literature]]. Composition relates to [[narrative|narrative work]]s of literature, but also relates to essays, biographies, and other works established in the field of rhetoric.
&lt;!--- Write your article below this line ---&gt;

==In narratives==
In narratives (primarily [[fiction]]), composition includes, but is not limited to,

*[[Outline (summary)|Outline]], the organisations of thoughts and/or ideas which is used to determine organisational technique
*[[Plot (narrative)|Plot]], the course or arrangement of events
*[[Theme (literature)|Theme]], the unifying subject or idea
*[[Dialogue]], a reciprocal [[conversation]] between two or more persons
*[[Characterisation]], the process of creating [[Fictional character|characters]]
*[[setting (fiction)|Setting]], the time and location in which the composition takes place
*Description, [[definition]]s of things in the composition
*[[stylistics (linguistics)|Style]], specifically, the linguistic style of the composition
*Setting tone or [[Mood (literature)|mood]], conveying one or more emotions or feelings through words
*[[writer's voice|Voice]], the individual writing style of the [[author]]
*[[tone (literary)|Tone]], which encompasses the attitudes toward the subject and toward the audience

==In rhetoric==
In [[rhetoric]] (primarily [[non-fiction]]), composition is the arrangement and strategic use of written, oral, visual and/or digital  in order to inform, [[Persuasion|persuade]], or [[Motivation|motivate]] an audience in a given situation.

==Oral discourse==
Traditionally, oratory, or classical rhetoric, is composed of five stages, or canons:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Acceptance |editor-first=Patricia |editor-last=Bizzell |editor2-first=Bruce |editor2-last=Herzberg |title=The Rhetorical Tradition |edition=2nd |location=Boston |publisher=Bedford/St.Martin‘s |year=2001 |isbn=0-312-14839-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Invention, "the search of persuasive ways to present information and formulate arguments"
*Arrangement, "the organization of the parts of speech to ensure that all means of persuasion are present and properly disposed"
*Style, "the use of correct, appropriate, and striking language throughout the speech"
*Memory, "the use of mnemonics and practice of speech"
*Delivery, "the use of effective gestures and vocal modulation to present the speech"
Typically, in any speech classroom, these stages are still prevalent in the composing process. Other such qualities to be included, especially when considering ones' [[audience]] and methods of persuasion, would be the rhetorical appeals:
*[[Logos]], appeals to logic and reason, evidence and support
*[[Ethos]], appeals to ethics, the speaker's credibility, trustworthiness, and morals
*[[Pathos]], appeals to emotion, connecting with audience through shared feelings

==Written discourse==
As oral discourse shifted to more written discourse, the stage of memory and delivery began to fade, yet the first three stages hold its rank in the [[writing process]] of most composition classrooms. The rhetorical appeals also prove important in written texts, as the strategies of using these appeals become more complex as writers understand their audience's needs when not in physical view.

==Visual==
Composition, which includes the language of visuals is a recent development in composition studies. Sonja K. Foss argues that visuals are a valued component of rhetorical study, and to only focus on verbal discourse, limits the opportunity to engage in multiple symbols that create meaning and speak rhetorically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foss |first=Sonya |chapter=Framing the Study of Visual Rhetoric: Toward a Transformation of Rhetorical Theory |title=In Defining Visual Rhetorics |editor-first=Charles A. |editor-last=Hill |editor2-first=Marguerite |editor2-last=Helmers |location=Mahwah, New Jersey |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum |year=2004 |pages=303–13 |isbn=0-8058-4402-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In thinking about how visuals are used to communicate, and how they are composed or analyzed in a rhetorical work, she argues that one considers the focus:
*Nature, the present elements/physical features and suggested elements/concepts and ideas
*Function, the action it communicates
*Evaluation, assessed rhetorically
Foss, who acknowledges [[visual rhetoric]], demonstrates that composition studies has to consider other definitions and incorporations of language.

==Digital==
This composition refers to work produced in digital spaces. The writer or speaker must not only consider all the composing processes of the above-mentioned discourse (like purpose, arrangement, etc.), but the relationship medium plays in the composing and decision process of that work. In digital discourse, the fifth canon of delivery takes on new meaning, and digital spaces change how traditional views of authority, circulation, and context are understood, like composing in a [[Wikipedia]]. Thus digital rhetoric, or [[eRhetoric]] offers new ways of composing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2867">'''''Continuous predicate''''' is a term coined by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) to describe a special type of [[relation (mathematics)|relational]] [[Predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] that results as the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of a [[Recursion|recursive]] process of [[hypostatic abstraction]].

Here is one of Peirce's definitive discussions of the concept:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When we have analyzed a proposition so as to throw into the subject everything that can be removed from the predicate, all that it remains for the predicate to represent is the form of connection between the different subjects as expressed in the propositional ''form''.  What I mean by "everything that can be removed from the predicate" is best explained by giving an example of something not so removable.

But first take something removable.  "Cain kills Abel."  Here the predicate appears as "— kills —."  But we can remove killing from the predicate and make the latter "— stands in the relation — to —."  Suppose we attempt to remove more from the predicate and put the last into the form "— exercises the function of relate of the relation — to —" and then putting "the function of relate to the relation" into another subject leave as predicate "— exercises — in respect to — to —."  But this "exercises" expresses "exercises the function".  Nay more, it expresses "exercises the function of relate", so that we find that though we may put this into a separate subject, it continues in the predicate just the same.

Stating this in another form, to say that "A is in the relation R to B" is to say that A is in a certain relation to R.  Let us separate this out thus:  "A is in the relation R¹ (where R¹ is the relation of a relate to the relation of which it is the relate) to R to B".  But A is here said to be in a certain relation to the relation R¹.  So that we can express the same fact by saying, "A is in the relation R¹ to the relation R¹ to the relation R to B", and so on ''ad infinitum''.

A predicate which can thus be analyzed into parts all homogeneous with the whole I call a ''continuous predicate''.  It is very important in logical analysis, because a continuous predicate obviously cannot be a ''compound'' except of continuous predicates, and thus when we have carried analysis so far as to leave only a continuous predicate, we have carried it to its ultimate elements.  (C.S. Peirce, "Letters to Lady Welby" (14 December 1908), ''Selected Writings'', pp. 396–397).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9972">'''Cruel and unusual punishment''' is a phrase describing [[punishment]] that is considered unacceptable due to the [[suffering]], [[pain]], or [[humiliation]] it inflicts on the person subjected to it.

There are generally tests that can serve as a guide to what cruel and unusual punishment is according to various legal textbooks in accordance with the law.  These are:
#overall acceptance in society,
#severity (the punishment fits the crime), and
#if the punishment is arbitrary.

==History==
These exact words were first used in the [[England|English]] [[Bill of Rights 1689]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain's unwritten constitution|url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|publisher=British Library|accessdate=27 November 2015|quote=The key landmark is the Bill of Rights (1689), which established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown.... The Bill of Rights (1689) then settled the primacy of Parliament over the monarch’s prerogatives, providing for the regular meeting of Parliament, free elections to the Commons, free speech in parliamentary debates, and some basic human rights, most famously freedom from ‘cruel or unusual punishment’.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were later also adopted in the United States by the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (ratified 1791) and in the [[British Leeward Islands]] (1798). Very similar words, "No one shall be subjected to [[torture]] or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment", appear in Article 5 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on December 10, 1948. The right under a different formulation is also found in [[Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 3]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (1950) and in Article 7 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (1966). The [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] (1982) also contains this fundamental right in [[Section Twelve of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 12]] and it is to be found in Article 4 (quoting the European Convention verbatim) of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] (2000). It is also found in Article 16 of the [[Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] (1984), and in Article 40 of the [[Constitution of Poland]] (1997).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Constitution of the Republic of Poland/Chapter 2|Constitution of Poland, Chapter 2]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution of the [[Marshall Islands]], in the sixth section of its [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] (Article 2), prohibits "cruel and unusual punishment", which it defines as: the [[death penalty]]; torture; "inhuman and degrading treatment"; and "[[excessive fines]] or deprivations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paclii.org/mh/legis/consol_act/cotmi363/ Constitution of the Marshall Islands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102080552/http://www.paclii.org/mh/legis/consol_act/cotmi363/ |date=2011-01-02 }}, art.II, s.6&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] states that "cruel and unusual punishments [shall not be] inflicted." The general principles the [[United States Supreme Court]] relied on to decide whether or not a particular punishment was cruel and unusual were determined by [[William J. Brennan|Justice William Brennan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Palmer, Jr. |first= Louis J. |title= Organ Transplants from Executed Prisoners: An Argument for the Creation of Death Sentence Organ Removal Statutes |page= 80 |publisher= Mcfarland &amp; Co Inc Pub |date=July 1999 |isbn= 978-0-7864-0673-9 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CCZ2SlSBRbQC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=cruel+and+unusual+punishment+less+severe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p5tD3Dg1Ij&amp;sig=7FT7JEB55ZpJZWs7RmLMYWQS6Qo&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=I6AHT5z1IcStsgbq7K2DDw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=cruel%20and%20unusual%20punishment%20less%20severe&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'', {{ussc|408|238|1972}}, Justice Brennan wrote, "There are, then, four principles by which we may determine whether a particular punishment is 'cruel and unusual'."
* The "essential predicate" is "that a punishment must not by its severity be degrading to human dignity," especially [[torture]].
* "A severe punishment that is obviously inflicted in wholly arbitrary fashion." (''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'' temporarily suspended [[capital punishment]] for this reason.)
* "A severe punishment that is clearly and totally rejected throughout society."
* "A severe punishment that is patently unnecessary."

And he added: "The function of these principles, after all, is simply to provide means by which a court can determine whether a challenged punishment comports with human dignity. They are, therefore, interrelated, and, in most cases, it will be their convergence that will justify the conclusion that a punishment is "cruel and unusual." The test, then, will ordinarily be a cumulative one: if a punishment is unusually severe, if there is a strong probability that it is inflicted arbitrarily, if it is substantially rejected by contemporary society, and if there is no reason to believe that it serves any penal purpose more effectively than some less severe punishment, then the continued infliction of that punishment violates the command of the Clause that the State may not inflict inhuman and uncivilized punishments upon those convicted of crimes."

Continuing, he wrote that he expected that no state would pass a law obviously violating any one of these principles, so court decisions regarding the Eighth Amendment would involve a "cumulative" analysis of the implication of each of the four principles. In this way the United States Supreme Court "set the standard that a punishment would be cruel and unusual [,if] it was too severe for the crime, [if] it was arbitrary, if it offended society's sense of justice, or if it was not more effective than a less severe penalty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationaljusticeproject.org/seminal.cfm |author=the International Justice Project |title=Seminal Cases - Brief Bank &amp; General Resources - the International Justice Project |accessdate=7 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120802122705/http://www.internationaljusticeproject.org/seminal.cfm |archivedate=2 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capital punishment==

There is great discussion as to whether [[capital punishment]] is cruel and unusual. Common arguments are that capital punishment is more expensive when factoring in [[appeal]]s versus [[life in prison]], and that the government has been wrong before on death penalty cases (therefore, the government could be wrong again, and the government ought not have the authority to end a life). These two arguments alone may or may not qualify under the tests the government puts forth, which could also be considered arbitrary itself, especially if society is not informed enough on these considerable facts. For most of recorded history, capital punishments were often deliberately cruel and painful. Severe historical execution methods include the [[breaking wheel]], [[hanged, drawn and quartered]], [[mazzatello]], [[boiling to death]], [[death by burning]], [[execution by drowning]], death by starvation, [[immurement]], [[flaying]], [[disembowelment]], [[crucifixion]], [[impalement]], [[Crushing (execution)|crushing]], [[execution by elephant]], [[keelhauling]], [[stoning]], [[dismemberment]], [[sawing (torture)|sawing]], [[scaphism]], [[slow slicing]], [[blood eagle]], [[bamboo torture]] and [[necklacing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950826,00.html|title=The Death Penalty :Revenge Is the Mother of Invention|date=24 January 1983|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Michael Portillo]] on the show ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' argued that in ensuring an execution is not of a cruel and unusual nature, the following criteria must be met:
* Death should be quick and painless to prevent suffering for the person being executed.
* [[Medical education]] should be provided to the [[executioner]] to prevent suffering caused by error.
* The death should not be gory (to prevent suffering for those carrying out the execution).
* No co-operation should be required from the person being executed, to prevent inaction, distress, and/or suffering caused by the prisoner being required to participate in his own execution.

The show argued that [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] appears to meet the criteria, by way of applying a combination of the gases [[argon]] and [[nitrogen]], as the person being executed would not feel any physical pain but would experience a euphoric state. It was further argued that these gases could be applied cheaply and efficiently by restraining the prisoner by way of [[physical restraints]] and mask.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/broadband/tx/executions/lethal_injection/|title=BBC - Horizon - How to Kill a Human Being|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2642">'''Cultural emphasis''' is an important aspect of a culture which is often reflected though language and, more specifically, vocabulary (Ottenheimer, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;266).  This means that the vocabulary people use in a culture indicates what is important to that group of people.  If there are a lot of words to describe a certain topic in a specific culture, then there is a good chance that that topic is considered important to that culture.

== Background ==
The idea of cultural emphasis is rooted form the work of Franz Boas, who is considered to be one of the founders of American Anthropology (Ottenheimer, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;15). Franz Boas developed and taught concepts such as [[cultural relativism]] and the "cultural unconscious", which allowed anthropologists who studied under him, like [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ruth Benedict]], to further study and develop ideas on language and culture (Hart, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;179).

== Application ==
One way in which cultural emphasis is exemplified is a populace talks about the weather.  For example, in a place where it is cold and it snows a lot, a large collection of words to describe the snow would be expected.

:For example: [[Whiteout (weather)|whiteout]], [[blizzard]], [[Ice storm|sleeting]], [[snowdrift]], powder snow, packed snow, fresh snow.

In a place where it is hot, a cornucopia of associated terms would be expected.

:For example: dry heat, muggy, humid, sticky, monsoon season, sweltering.
A concentration of related terms for similar phenomena suggests the importance in distinguishing between them.  Furthermore, if you are not from the area, or that culture, you might not have experienced or know the difference between, for example, a dry heat or a humid heat, when the difference may have huge implications for the outcome of a particular action.

'''David Ernest Duke''' (born July 1, 1950) is an American [[White supremacy|white supremacist]], [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] [[politician]], [[white separatist]], [[List of conspiracy theories#Antisemitic conspiracy theories|antisemitic conspiracy theorist]], [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]], [[convicted felon]], and former [[Grand Wizard]] of the [[Ku Klux Klan]].

A former [[Republican Party (US)|Republican]] [[Louisiana House of Representatives|Louisiana State Representative]], Duke was a candidate in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1988|Democratic presidential primaries in 1988]] and the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1992|Republican presidential primaries in 1992]]. Duke also ran unsuccessfully for the [[Louisiana State Senate]], [[United States Senate]], [[United States House of Representatives]], and for [[List of Governors of Louisiana|Governor of Louisiana]].

In 2002, Duke pled guilty to felony fraud. Specifically, he defrauded his political supporters by pretending to be in dire financial straits, and asking them for money to help him pay for basic necessities. At the time, Duke was financially secure, and he used his supporters' money for recreational gambling.&lt;ref name="guilty" /&gt; He subsequently served a 15-month sentence at [[Federal Correctional Institution, Big Spring]] in Texas.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,80944,00.html David Duke Gets 15-Month Sentence for Fraud] Fox News Channel&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke speaks against what he alleges as Jewish control of the [[Federal Reserve Bank]], the [[United States federal government|U.S. federal government]], and the media.  Duke supports the preservation of what he considers to be [[Western culture]] and [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] Christian [[family values#United States|family values]], as well as [[tax resistance|abolition]] of the [[Internal Revenue Service]], voluntary [[racial segregation]], [[anti-communism]], and [[white separatism]].&lt;ref name="duke_ma_39"&gt;{{cite web |last = Duke |first = David |title = An Aryan Vision |website = My Awakening |publisher = SolarGeneral |url = http://www.solargeneral.com/library/ma/39.html |accessdate = November 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Duke |first = David |title = Kayla Rolland: One More Victim |date = October 23, 2004 |url = http://www.davidduke.com/index.php?p=21 |accessdate = November 13, 2006 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061029061208/http://www.davidduke.com/index.php?p=21 |archivedate = October 29, 2006 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = David Duke: In His Own Words / On Segregation |publisher = Anti-Defamation League |url = http://www.adl.org/special_reports/duke_own_words/on_segregation.asp |accessdate = November 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Duke was born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma]], to Alice Maxine (Crick) and David Hedger Duke. As the son of an engineer for [[Shell Oil Company]], Duke frequently moved with his family around the world. They lived a short time in the Netherlands before settling in [[Louisiana]]. In the late 1960s, Duke met [[William Luther Pierce]], the leader of the white nationalist, [[neo-Nazi]], [[Holocaust denial]] and antisemitic [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]], who would remain a lifelong influence on him. Duke joined the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Issues '92 Profile: David Duke; ''[[The Orange County Register]]''. [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], [[California]]: March 2, 1992. pp. a.04&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Duke enrolled at [[Louisiana State University]] (LSU) in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], and in 1970, he formed a [[White people|white]] student group called the ''White Youth Alliance'' that was affiliated with the [[American Nazi Party|National Socialist White People's Party]]. The same year, to protest lawyer [[William Kunstler]]'s appearance at [[Tulane University]] in [[New Orleans]], Duke appeared at a demonstration in [[Nazism|Nazi]] uniform. Picketing and holding parties on the anniversary of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s birth, he became known on the LSU campus for wearing a Nazi uniform.&lt;ref name="rise"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bridges|first=Tyler|title=The Rise of David Duke|year=1995|publisher=University of Mississippi Press|isbn=978-0-87805-678-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke says that he spent nine months in Laos, calling it a "normal tour of duty." He actually went to Laos in order to join his father, who was working there and had asked him to visit during the summer of 1971.&lt;ref name="Bridges 1995 26–29"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bridges|first=Tyler|title=The Rise of David Duke|year=1995|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-0-87805-684-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=X2WD3EnAVvEC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=%22David+Duke%E2%80%8E;%22++vietnam#v=onepage&amp;q=%20%20%20vietnam|pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father helped him gain a job teaching English to Laotian military officers, from which he was dismissed after six weeks when he drew a [[Molotov cocktail]] on the blackboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=B.G.|last=Burkett|title=Stolen Valor: How the Vietnam Generation was robbed of its heroes and history|publisher=Verity Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Xd0DAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=stole+valor|isbn=978-0-9667036-0-3|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed to have gone behind enemy lines 20 times at night to drop rice to anti-communist insurgents in planes flying {{convert|10|ft|m}} off the ground, narrowly avoiding receiving a shrapnel wound. Two [[Air America (airline)|Air America]] pilots who were in Laos at that time said that the planes only flew during the day and that they also flew no less than {{convert|500|ft|m}} from the ground. One pilot suggested that it might have been possible for Duke to have gone on a safe "milk run" once or twice but no more than that. Duke was also unable to recall the name of the airfield that he had used.&lt;ref name="Bridges 1995 26–29" /&gt;

Duke graduated from LSU in 1974. Shortly after graduation, Duke founded the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (KKKK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/david-duke|title=David Duke|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1972 arrest in New Orleans===
In January 1972, Duke was arrested in New Orleans for "[[Riot|inciting a riot]]". Several racial confrontations broke out that month in the Crescent City, including one at the [[Robert E. Lee Monument (New Orleans, Louisiana)|Robert E. Lee Monument]] involving Duke, [[Addison Roswell Thompson]]—a perennial [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregationist]] candidate for [[governor of Louisiana]] and [[mayor of New Orleans]]—and his 89-year-old friend and mentor, Rene LaCoste (not to be confused with the French [[tennis]] player [[René Lacoste]]). Thompson and LaCoste dressed in Klan robes for the occasion and placed a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] flag at the monument. The [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]] began throwing bricks at the pair, but police arrived in time to prevent serious injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2-84635lwKYC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;dq=a+roswell+thompson

== Political and ideological activities ==

=== Early campaigns ===
Duke first ran for the Louisiana Senate as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from a [[Baton Rouge]] district in 1975. During his campaign, he was allowed to speak on the college campuses of [[Vanderbilt University]], [[Indiana University]], the [[University of Southern California]], [[Stanford University]], and [[Tulane University]].&lt;ref name="imperialwizardofkkk"&gt;{{cite news|title=David Ernest Duke: 'My race has never been defeated, and we will not fall this time.' |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/67860148/?terms=%22vanderbilt%2Buniversity%22%2B%22ku%2Bklux%2Bklan%22 |newspaper=The Daily Tar Heel (Chapel Hill, North Carolina) |date=January 20, 1975 |page=4|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = July 15, 2015 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received 11,079 votes, one-third of those cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Wayne King|title=David Duke:Cleaning up the Klan's image |date=November 25, 1975|work=St. Petersburg Times via New York Times|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JjIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UF8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4666,22684&amp;dq=david-duke|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1979, he ran as a Democrat for the 10th District Senate seat and finished second in a three-candidate race with 9,897 votes (26%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=328064 |title=Our Campaigns – LA State Senate 10 Race – October 27, 1979 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, Duke was accused by several Klan officials of stealing the organization's money. "Duke is nothing but a con artist", Jack Gregory, Duke's Florida state leader, told the ''Clearwater Sun'' after Duke allegedly refused to turn over proceeds from a series of 1979 Klan rallies to the Knights. Another Klan official under Duke, Jerry Dutton, told reporters that Duke had used Klan funds to purchase and refurbish his home in [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]]. Duke later justified the repairs by saying most of his home was used by the Klan.

In 1979, after his first, abortive run for president (as a Democrat) and a series of highly publicized violent Klan incidents, Duke quietly [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] the nonprofit [[National Association for the Advancement of White People]] (NAAWP) in an attempt to leave the baggage of the Klan behind.

Duke allegedly conducted a direct-mail appeal in 1987, using the identity and mailing-list of the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[Nationalist Movement|Forsyth County Defense League]] without permission. League officials described it as a fundraising scam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin A.

=== 1988 presidential campaign ===
{{main|David Duke presidential campaign, 1988}}

In 1988, Duke ran initially in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential [[primary election|primaries]]. His campaign had limited impact, with the only exception—winning the little-known [[New Hampshire primary#Vice-Presidential results|New Hampshire Vice-Presidential primary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=393638 |title=Our Campaigns – D Primary Race – February 16, 1988 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke, having failed to gain much traction as a Democrat, then sought and gained the [[President of the United States|Presidential]] nomination of the [[Populist Party (United States, 1984)|Populist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=294226|title=Our Campaigns - US President - Pop Convention Race|date=March 11, 1988|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared on the ballot for president in 11 states and was a write-in candidate in some other states, some with Trenton Stokes of [[Arkansas]] for vice president, and on other state ballots with Floyd Parker, a [[physician]] from [[New Mexico]],&lt;ref name="Bridges1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bridges|first=Tyler|title=The rise of David Duke|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X2WD3EnAVvEC&amp;pg=PA137|accessdate=1 December 2011|year=1994|publisher=Univ.

=== 1989: Successful run in special election for Louisiana House seat ===
In December 1988, Duke changed his political affiliation from the Democratic Party to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name=Zatarain&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CXzQ2VSpyZsC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=John+Treen+of+Louisiana&amp;q=John%20Treen%20of%20Louisiana|title=Michael Zatarain, ''David Duke: Evolution of a Klansman''|accessdate=November 11, 2009|isbn=978-0-88289-817-9|author1=Zatarain, Michael|date=July 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Republican State Representative [[Charles Cusimano]] of [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]] resigned his District 81 seat to become a 24th Judicial District Court judge, and a [[special election]] was called early in 1989 to select a successor. Duke entered the race to succeed Cusimano and faced several opponents, including fellow Republicans [[John S. Treen|John Spier Treen]], a brother of former [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[David C. Treen]]; Delton Charles, a school board member; and [[Roger F. Villere, Jr.]], who operates Villere's Florist in Metairie. Duke finished first in the primary with 3,995 votes (33.1%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=328066|title=Louisiana State Representative Election, 1989|publisher=ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=November 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As no one received a majority of the vote in the first round, a [[runoff election]] was required between Duke and Treen, who polled 2,277 votes (18.9%) in the first round of balloting. Treen's candidacy was endorsed by U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]], former President [[Ronald Reagan]], and other notable Republicans,&lt;ref&gt;"GOP Condemns Duke" ''[[Newsday]]''. Long Island, N.Y.: February 25, 1989, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Democrats [[Victor Bussie]] (president of the Louisiana [[AFL-CIO]]) and [[Edward J. Steimel]] (president of the [[Louisiana Association of Business and Industry]] and former director of the "good government" [[think tank]], the Public Affairs Research Council). Duke, however, hammered Treen on a statement the latter had made indicating a willingness to entertain higher [[property tax]]es, anathema in that suburban district.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas D.

Freshman legislator [[Odon Bacqué]] of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], a [[Independent (politics)|No Party]] member of the House, stood alone in 1989 when he attempted to deny seating to Duke on the grounds that the incoming representative had resided outside his district at the time of his election. When Treen failed in a court challenge in regard to Duke's residency, Duke was seated. Lawmakers who opposed Duke said that they had to defer to his constituents, who narrowly chose Duke as representative.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron Gomez]], "David Duke? He's Just Another Freshman", ''My Name Is Ron And I'm a Recovering Legislator: Memoirs of a Louisiana State Representative'', [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], [[Louisiana]]: Zemog Publishing, 2000, pp. 157-164; {{ISBN|0-9700156-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As state representative===
Duke took his seat on the same day as [[Jerry Luke LeBlanc]] of [[Lafayette Parish, Louisiana|Lafayette Parish]] (who won another special election, held on the same day as the Duke-Treen runoff, to choose a successor to [[Kathleen Blanco]]), the future governor who was elected to the [[Louisiana Public Service Commission]]. Duke and LeBlanc were sworn in separately.

Colleague [[Ron Gomez]] of Lafayette stated that Duke, as a short-term legislator, was "so single minded, he never really became involved in the nuts and bolts of House rules and parliamentary procedure. It was just that shortcoming that led to the demise of most of his attempts at lawmaking."&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, ''My Name Is Ron And I'm a Recovering Legislator'', pg. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

One legislative issue pushed by Duke was the requirement that [[welfare]] recipients be tested for the use of [[narcotics]]. The recipients had to show themselves to be drug-free to receive state and federal benefits under his proposal.&lt;ref&gt;"Duke welfare bill wins panel favor," ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', May 9, 1989, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez, a longtime journalist, recalls having met and interviewed Duke in the mid-1970s when Duke was a state senate candidate:&lt;blockquote&gt;He was still in his mid-20s and very non-descript. Tall and slimly built, he had a very prominent nose, flat cheek bones, a slightly receding chin and straight dark brown hair. The interview turned out to be quite innocuous, and I hadn't thought about it again until Duke came to my legislative desk, and we shook hands. Who was this guy? Tall and well-built with a perfect nose, a model's cheek bones, prominent chin, blue eyes and freshly coiffed blond hair, he looked like a movie star. He obviously didn't remember from the radio encounter, and I was content to leave it at that.&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, ''Recovering Legislator'', p. 228. Gomez has implied that Duke had a facelift by the time he entered the legislature.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Consistent with Gomez's observation, Duke in the latter 1980s reportedly had his nose thinned and chin augmented. Following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives, he shaved his mustache.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Joshua Benton|Benton, Joshua]]|title=National: David Duke Reverts to Unabashed Racism in Congress run |date=May 1, 1999|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|publisher=Block News Alliance|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/headlines/19990501davidduke3.asp|accessdate=September 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gullixson|first=Paul|title=Part 4: Taking on David Duke|date=April 12, 1995|work=Palo Alto Weekly|url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/page4/1995_Apr_12.NOTES12.html|accessdate=September 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez, in his 2000 autobiography, wrote about Duke:&lt;blockquote&gt;He once presented a bill on the floor, one of the few which he had managed to get out of committee. He finished his opening presentation and strolled with great self-satisfaction back up the aisle to his seat. In his mind, he had spoken, made his presentation and that was that. Before he had even reached his desk and re-focused on the proceedings, another first-term member had been recognized for the floor and immediately moved to table the bill. The House voted for the motions effectively killing the bill. That and similar procedures were used against him many times.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Gomez, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Gomez said that he recalls Duke obtaining the passage of only a single bill, legislation which prohibited movie producers or book publishers from compensating jurors for accounts of their court experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, ''Recovering Legislator'', pgs. 231-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez added that Duke's "tenure in the House was short and uninspired. Never has anyone parlayed an election by such a narrow margin to such a minor position to such international prominence. He has run for numerous other positions without success but has always had some effect, usually negative, on the outcome."&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, ''Recovering Legislator'', pg. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez continued: &lt;blockquote&gt;[Duke's] new message was that he had left the Klan, shed the Nazi uniform he had proudly worn in many previous appearances, and only wanted to serve the people. He eliminated his high-octane anti-Semitic rhetoric. He was particularly concerned with the plight of "European-Americans." He never blatantly spoke of race as a factor but referred to the "growing underclass." He used the tried and true demagoguery of [[class envy]] to sell his message: excessive taxpayers' money spent on welfare, school busing practices, [[affirmative action]]... and set-aside programs. He also embraced a subject near and dear to every Jefferson Parish voter, protection of the [[homestead exemption]].&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, ''Recovering Legislator'', pg. 222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Duke launched unsuccessful campaigns for the [[U.S. Senate]] in 1990 and governor in 1991. Villere did not again seek office but instead concentrated his political activity within the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] organization.&lt;ref name=sabludowsky&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayoubuzz.com/News/Louisiana/Politics/Jindal_Has_Mighty_Duke_In_Louisiana_GOP_and_Roger_Villere__9076.asp |title=Stephen Sabludowsky, "Jindal Has Mighty Duke in Louisiana GOP and Roger Villere" |publisher=bayoubuzz.com |accessdate=November 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701031015/http://www.bayoubuzz.com/News/Louisiana/Politics/Jindal_Has_Mighty_Duke_In_Louisiana_GOP_and_Roger_Villere__9076.asp |archivedate=July 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1990 campaign for U.S. Senate ===
{{Main|United States Senate election in Louisiana, 1990}}

Duke has often criticized federal policies that he believes discriminate against white people in favor of racial minorities. To that end he formed the controversial group the National Association for the Advancement of White People, a play on the African American civil rights group, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]].&lt;ref&gt;"Duke undecided on Senate race", ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', November 6, 1989, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Duke had first hesitated about entering the Senate race, he made his announcement of candidacy for the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 6, 1990. Duke was the only Republican in competition against three Democrats, including incumbent U.S. Senator [[Bennett Johnston, Jr.|J. Bennett Johnston, Jr.]], of [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=3516 |title=Our Campaigns – LA US Senate Race – October 6, 1990 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom Duke derided as "J. Benedict Johnston".&lt;ref&gt;"Can Johnston be beaten?", ''Minden Press-Herald'', November 19, 1989, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Governor [[David Treen]], whose brother, John Treen, Duke had defeated for state representative in 1989, called Duke's senatorial platform "garbage. ... I  think he is bad for our party because of his espousal of [[Nazi]]sm and racial superiority."&lt;ref&gt;"Treen: Renounce David Duke's 'garbage'", ''Minden Press-Herald'', December 22, 1989, p. 7A&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican Party officially endorsed state Senator [[Ben Bagert]] of New Orleans in a state convention on January 13, 1990, but national GOP officials in October, just days before the primary election, concluded that Bagert could not win. To avoid a runoff between Duke and Bagert, the GOP decided to surrender the primary to Johnston. Funding for Bagert's campaign was halted, and after initial protest, Bagert dropped out two days before the election. With such a late withdrawal, Bagert's name remained on the ballot, but his votes, most of which were presumably cast as absentee ballots, were not counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Republican quits to help Democrat |author=Kevin McGill |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nwghAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gXYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3886,613940&amp;dq=duke+1990+not+endorsed |newspaper=The Hour |date=October 5, 1990 |accessdate=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Louisiana Republican Quits, Reducing Duke's Chances|date=October 5, 1990|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke received 43.51 percent (607,391 votes) of the primary vote to Johnston's 53.93 percent (752,902 votes).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Duke's views prompted some of his critics, including Republicans such as journalist [[Quin Hillyer]], to form the Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and Nazism, which directed media attention to Duke's statements of hostility to blacks and [[Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Monteverde|first=Danny|title=Elizabeth Rickey, GOP activist|newspaper=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=September 15, 2009|url=http://www.nola.com/obituaries/t-p/index.ssf?/base/obits-33/125299209991370.xml&amp;coll=2|accessdate=September 15, 2009}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006 ''[[Financial Times]]'' editorial, [[Gideon Rachman]] recalled interviewing Duke's 1990 campaign manager, who said, "The Jews just aren't a big issue in Louisiana. We keep telling David, stick to attacking the blacks.

In the primary, Duke finished second to former governor [[Edwin W. Edwards]] in votes; thus, he faced Edwards in a runoff. In the initial round, Duke received 32% of the vote. Incumbent Governor [[Buddy Roemer]], who had switched from the Democratic to Republican parties during his term, came in third with 27% of the vote. Duke effectively killed Roemer's bid for re-election. While Duke had a sizable core constituency of devoted supporters, many voted for him as a "protest vote" to register dissatisfaction with Louisiana's establishment politicians. In response to criticism for his past white supremacist activities, Duke's stock response was to apologize for his past and declare that he was a born-again Christian.&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-11-24/opinion/op-92_1_duke-blacks-louisiana |title=Duke Gets His Comeuppance From the Victims of His Hate Message : Politics: Up until an amazing TV exchange, Louisiana's blacks had remained on the sidelines.

The [[Christian Coalition of America]], which exerted considerable impact on the Republican State Central Committee, was led in Louisiana by its national director and vice president, [[Billy McCormack (Louisiana pastor)|Billy McCormack]], then the pastor of University Worship Center in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]. The coalition was accused of having failed to investigate Duke in the early part of his political resurgence. By the time of the 1991 gubernatorial election, however, its leadership had withdrawn support from Duke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theocracywatch.org/clarkson_inside.html|title=Frederick Clarkson, "Church and State", November 1993|publisher=theocracywatch.org|accessdate=June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Duke's status as the only Republican in the runoff, incumbent President [[George H. W. Bush]] (a Republican) opposed his candidacy and denounced him as a charlatan and a racist.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt; White House Chief of Staff [[John H. Sununu]] stated that "The President is absolutely opposed to the kind of racist statements that have come out of David Duke now and in the past."&lt;ref&gt;West, Paul. (October 21, 1991).

The Louisiana Coalition against Racism and Nazism rallied against Duke's gubernatorial campaign. [[Beth Rickey]], a moderate member of the Louisiana Republican State Central Committee and a PhD student at [[Tulane University]], began to follow Duke to record his speeches and expose what she saw as instances of racist and neo-Nazi remarks. For a time, Duke took Rickey to lunch, introduced her to his daughters, telephoned her late at night, and tried to convince her of his worldview: the Holocaust was a myth, notorious [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] physician [[Josef Mengele]] was a medical genius, and that blacks and Jews were responsible for various social ills.  Rickey released transcripts of their conversations to the press and also provided evidence establishing that Duke sold Nazi literature (including ''[[Mein Kampf]]'') from his legislative office and attended neo-Nazi political gatherings while he held elective office.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Kenneth (September 16, 2009).

Between the primary and the runoff, called the "general election" under Louisiana election rules (in which all candidates run on one ballot, regardless of party), [[white supremacist]] organizations from around the country contributed to Duke's campaign fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Martin A.|title=Detailing David Duke|year=2003|website=Intelligence Report|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=27|accessdate=August 31, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002073754/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=27|archive-date=October 2, 2006|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Duke: In His Own Words|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/duke_own_words/duke_intro.asp|accessdate=August 31, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831083918/http://www.adl.org/special_reports/duke_own_words/duke_intro.asp|archivedate=August 31, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke's rise garnered national media attention. While he gained the backing of the [[Quixotism|quixotic]] former [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]] Mayor [[John K. Snyder]], Duke won few serious endorsements in Louisiana. Celebrities and organizations donated thousands of dollars to former Governor [[Edwin Edwards]]' campaign. Referencing Edwards' long-standing problem with accusations of corruption, popular bumper stickers read: "Vote for the Crook. It's Important",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Appelbome|first=Peter|title=An Epoch Is Ending But Why?|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/08/us/an-epoch-is-ending-but-why.html|accessdate=January 16, 2011|date=June 8, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://photos.nola.com/tpphotos/2011/12/175duke.html Photo of bumper sticker] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925004604/http://photos.nola.com/tpphotos/2011/12/175duke.html |date=September 25, 2012 }}, New Orleans, ''The Times-Picayune''&lt;/ref&gt; and "Vote for the Lizard, not the Wizard." When a reporter asked Edwards what he needed to do to triumph over Duke, Edwards replied with a smile: "Stay alive."

The runoff debate, held on November 6, 1991, received significant attention when journalist [[Norman Robinson (television news reporter)|Norman Robinson]] questioned Duke. Robinson, who is African-American, told Duke that he was "scared" at the prospect of Duke winning the election because of his history of "diabolical, evil, vile" racist and antisemitic comments, some of which he read to Duke. He then pressed Duke for an apology and when Duke protested that Robinson was not being fair to him, Robinson replied that he didn't think Duke was being honest. [[Jason Berry]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it "startling TV" and the "catalyst" for the "overwhelming" turnout of black voters who helped Edwards defeat Duke.&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"/&gt;

Edwards received 1,057,031 votes (61.2%), while Duke's 671,009 votes represented 38.8% of the total. Duke nevertheless claimed victory, saying, "I won my constituency. I won 55% of the white vote", a statistic confirmed by exit polls.&lt;ref name="rise" /&gt;

Duke ran as a Republican in the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1992|1992 presidential primaries]], although Republican Party officials tried to block his participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Officials reject putting Duke on ballot for state primary|first=Edward T.|last=McHugh|work=Telegram &amp; Gazette. |location=Worcester, Mass.|date=December 13, 1991|page=A.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received 119,115 (0.94%) votes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=55213 |title=Our Campaigns – US President – R Primaries Race – February 1, 1992 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the primaries, but no delegates to the national convention.

A 1992 film, ''Backlash: Race and the American Dream'', investigated Duke's appeal among some white voters. ''Backlash'' explored the [[Demagogue|demagogic]] issues of Duke's platform, examining his use of black crime, welfare, affirmative action and white supremacy and tied Duke to a legacy of other white backlash politicians, such as [[Lester G. Maddox]] and [[George Wallace]], and the use in the successful 1988 presidential campaign of [[George H. W. Bush]] of these same racially themed hot buttons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Examining the Appeal of David Duke's Oratory|date=July 10, 1992|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1996 campaign for U.S. Senate ===
{{main|United States Senate election in Louisiana, 1996}}

When Johnston announced his retirement in 1996, Duke ran again for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. He polled 141,489 votes (11.5%). Former Republican state representative [[Woody Jenkins]] of Baton Rouge and Democrat [[Mary Landrieu]] of New Orleans, the former state treasurer, went into the general election contest. Duke was fourth in the nine-person, [[Nonpartisan blanket primary|jungle primary]] race.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E5DC163EF930A35752C0A96F958260 David Duke Heads North to Raise Money for House Race"] By Michael Janofsky, ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 3, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1999 campaign for U.S. House ===
A special election was [[Louisiana's 1st congressional district special election, 1999|held in Louisiana's First Congressional District]] following the sudden resignation of powerful Republican incumbent [[Bob Livingston]] in 1999. Duke sought the seat as a Republican and received 19% of the vote. He finished a close third, thus failing to make the runoff. His candidacy was repudiated by the Republicans.&lt;ref name=livingston&gt;{{cite news|last= Edsall|first=Thomas B.|title=David Duke to Seek Livingston's Seat|work=The Washington Post|date=December 21, 1998|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/keyraces99/stories/duke122198.htm|accessdate=September 20, 2008|quote=Yesterday, the party moved quickly once again to disassociate itself from Duke.

=== New Orleans Protocol ===
Duke organized a weekend gathering of "European Nationalists" in [[Kenner, Louisiana]]. In an attempt to overcome the splintering and division in the white nationalist movement that had followed the death of leader [[William Luther Pierce|William Pierce]] in 2002, Duke presented a unity proposal for peace within the movement and a better image for outsiders. His proposal was accepted and is now known as the ''New Orleans Protocol'' (NOP). It pledges adherents to a pan-European outlook, recognizing national and ethnic allegiance, but stressing the value of all European peoples. Signed by and sponsored by a number of white supremacist leaders and organizations, it has three provisions:&lt;ref name="SPLC-2004"&gt;{{cite web |title=Freed from prison, David Duke mounts a comeback |url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=477 |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] Intelligence Report, Summer 2004 |access-date=September 21, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194814/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=477 |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The New Orleans Protocol | publisher=[[Canadian Heritage Alliance]] website | url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=477 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Zero tolerance for violence.
# Honorable and ethical behavior in relations with other signatory groups. This includes not denouncing others who have signed this protocol. In other words, no enemies on the right.
# Maintaining a high tone in our arguments and public presentations.

Those who signed the pact on May 29, 2004, include Duke, Don Black, [[Paul Fromm (activist)|Paul Fromm]], [[Willis Carto]] (whose Holocaust-denying ''[[Barnes Review]]'' helped sponsor the event), [[Kevin Alfred Strom]], and [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] (signing as an individual, not on behalf of his [[British National Party]]).&lt;ref name="SPLC-2004" /&gt;

The [[Southern Poverty Law Center|SPLC]] noted that the "high tone" of the NOP contrasted with statements at the event where the pact was signed, such as Paul Fromm's calling a Muslim woman "a hag in a bag" and Sam Dickson (from the [[Council of Conservative Citizens]], another sponsor) speaking about the "very, very destructive" effect of opposing the Nazis in World War II—opposition that caused people to view Hitler's "normal, healthy racial values" as evil.&lt;ref name="SPLC-2004" /&gt; The SPLC described the NOP as a "smokescreen," saying that "most of the conference participants' ire was directed at what they consider to be a worldwide Jewish conspiracy to destroy the white race through [[immigration]] and [[miscegenation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=June 2004|title=White Supremacists Target Jews in New Alliance|url=http://www.splcenter.org/center/splcreport/article.jsp?aid=83|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019031428/http://www.splcenter.org/center/splcreport/article.jsp?aid=83|website=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]|archivedate=October 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later political activity ===
Duke joined the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform]] Party in 1999 while working for [[Pat Buchanan]]'s 2000 presidential campaign. Duke and Buchanan would both leave the party after the election.

In 2004, Duke's bodyguard, roommate, and longtime associate Roy Armstrong made a bid for the [[United States House of Representatives]], running as a Democrat, to serve Louisiana's First Congressional District. In the open primary, Armstrong finished second in the six candidate field with 6.69% of the vote, but Republican [[Bobby Jindal]] received 78.40%, thus winning the seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4156 |title=Our Campaigns – LA – District 1 Race – November 2, 2004 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke was the head advisor of Armstrong's campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sabludowsky |first=Steve |title=David Duke Close Associate Runs for Congress in Race With Indian-American Bobby Jindal |date=August 6, 2004 |publisher=BayouBuzz.com |url=http://www.bayoubuzz.com/articles.aspx?aid=2044 |accessdate=September 1, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124153531/http://www.bayoubuzz.com/articles.aspx?aid=2044 |archivedate=November 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burdeau|first=Cain|title=KKK Leader David Duke's Home is Raided by Federal Agents|date=November 17, 2000|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/KKK-Duke-Home-Raided.htm|accessdate=September 1, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310030504/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/KKK-Duke-Home-Raided.htm|archivedate=March 10, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He claimed that his platform has become the Republican mainstream and added, "I'm overjoyed to see Donald Trump and most Americans embrace most of the issues that I've championed for years." However, Trump's campaign reaffirmed that Trump disavows Duke's support, and Republican organizations said they will not support him "under any circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/22/politics/david-duke-senate-race/|title=Former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke running for Senate seat in Louisiana|last=Scott|first=Eugene|date=July 23, 2016|work=CNN|accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 5, 2016, National Public Radio ([[NPR]]) aired an interview between Duke and Steve Inskeep in which Duke claimed that there was widespread racism against European Americans, that they have been subject to vicious attacks in the media, and that Trump's voters were also his voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/08/05/488802494/former-kkk-leader-david-duke-says-of-course-trump-voters-are-his-voters|title=Former KKK Leader David Duke Says 'Of Course' Trump Voters Are His Voters|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.mprnews.org/newscut/2016/08/a-defense-on-steve-inskeeps-interview-with-david-duke/|title=A defense of Steve Inskeep's interview with David Duke|first=Bob|last=Collins|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Research Inc.|Mason-Dixon]] poll released on October 20, 2016, showed Duke receiving support from 5.1% of voters in the state, barely clearing the 5% requirement for a candidate to be allowed to participate in a November 2 debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/10/john_kennedy_leads_in_latest_l.html|title=John Kennedy leads in latest Louisiana Senate poll; David Duke makes debate cut|author=Richard Rainey|website=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=2016-10-20|accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iran ===
Duke has taken part in Iranian government sponsored events in Iran. In 2006, at the invitation of Iranian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], Duke took part in an [[International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust|event held in Tehran to question the Holocaust]]. "The Zionists have used the Holocaust as a weapon to deny the rights of the Palestinians and cover up the crimes of Israel," Duke told a gathering of nearly 70 participants in Tehran at Ahmadinejad's invitation. "This conference has an incredible impact on Holocaust studies all over the world," said Duke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/12/13/kkk-david-duke-tells-iran-holocaust-conference-that-gas-chambers-not-used-to.html] KKK's David Duke Tells Iran Holocaust Conference That Gas Chambers Not Used to Kill Jews, Published December 13, 2006, Fox News&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Stormfront'' ===
In 1995, [[Don Black (white supremacist)|Don Black]] and Chloê Hardin, Duke's ex-wife, began a [[bulletin board system]] (BBS) called ''[[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]]''. The website has become a prominent online forum for [[white nationalism]], [[white separatism]], [[holocaust denial]], [[neo-Nazism]], [[hate speech]] and [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/12/5/143556/393 "RedState, White Supremacy, and Responsibility"], ''[[Daily Kos]]'', December 5, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FOX"&gt;[[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,86338,00.html "Circling the Wagons in Georgia"], ''[[Fox News Channel]]'', May 8, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2001/dtv2001-0023.html |title=WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center: Case No. DTV2001-0023 |publisher= World Intellectual Property Organization |date=January 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke is an active user of ''Stormfront'', where he posts articles from his own website and polls forum members for opinions and questions, in particular during his Internet broadcasts. Duke has worked with Don Black on numerous projects, including [[Operation Red Dog]] (the attempted overthrowing of Dominica's government) in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manana.com/dominica.htm Captmike works undercover with the US Government to stop the invasion of the Island Nation of Dominica.] manana.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadiancontent.ca/articles/031401reddog.html Operation Red Dog: Canadian neo-Nazis were central to the planned invasion of Dominica in 1981] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030519071411/http://www.canadiancontent.ca/articles/031401reddog.html |date=May 19, 2003 }} canadiancontent.ca&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British National Party ===
In 2000, [[Nick Griffin]] (then leader of the [[British National Party]] in the United Kingdom) met with Duke at a seminar with the [[American Friends of the British National Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010312173817/http://www.americabnp.net/april.htm|url=http://www.americabnp.net/april.htm|archivedate=March 12, 2001|date=April 2000|title=April Meeting|website=American Friends of the BNP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin said:
{{quote|instead of talking about racial purity, we talk about identity … that means basically to use the saleable words, as I say, freedom, security, identity, democracy.  Nobody can criticise them.

This was widely reported in the media of the United Kingdom, as well as the meeting between Duke and Griffin, following electoral successes made by the party in 2009.&lt;ref name=gun&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6481475.ece|work=[[The Times]]|title=White supremacist gunman James W. von Brunn had links to BNP|first=Kaya|last=Burgess|date=June 12, 2009|accessdate=June 12, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Indep&gt;{{cite web|author1=Cahal Milmo|author2=Kevin Rawlinson|title=10 things you should know about the BNP when you watch Question Time tonight|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/10-things-you-should-know-about-the-bnp-when-you-watch-question-time-tonight-1806874.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=January 19, 2015|date=October 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pano&gt;{{cite web|title=PANORAMA: UNDER THE SKIN [Transcript]|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/audio_video/programmes/panorama/transcripts/transcript_25_11_01.txt|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=January 19, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026080017/http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/audio_video/programmes/panorama/transcripts/transcript_25_11_01.txt|archivedate=October 26, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alt-right===
Duke has written in praise of the [[alt-right]], describing one broadcast as "fun and interesting"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidduke.com/incredible-conversation-dr-duke-andrew-anglin-alt-right-revolution-jewish-supremacism/|title=An Incredible Conversation Between Dr. Duke and Andrew Anglin on the Alt Right Revolution Against Jewish Supremacism!|date=June 9, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another as "this great show".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidduke.com/patrick-slattery-and-mark-collett-discuss-brexit-the-british-immigration-situation-and-what-can-be-done|title=Dr. Duke interviews Andrew Anglin on Why the Alt-Right is Growing like Wildfire and is Winning!|date=October 3, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[People for the American Way]] reported Duke championing the alt-right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/david-duke-donald-trump-speaks-like-an-alt-right-leader/|title=David Duke: Donald Trump Speaks Like An Alt-Right Leader - Right Wing Watch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke described them as "our people" when describing their role in [[Donald Trump]]'s election victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/former-ku-klux-klan-leader-and-us-alt-right-hail-election-result|title=Former Ku Klux Klan leader and US alt-right hail election result|first=Esther|last=Addley|date=November 9, 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also claims that whilst he is not an active member of the alt-right, he is an inspiration for the movement. The ''[[International Business Times]]'' described Duke as having '[[Nazi salute|Zieg-heiling]] acolytes in the so-called "alt-right"'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/decoding-alt-right-how-fringe-white-nationalism-invaded-mainstream-1594035|title=Is Hillary Clinton to blame for the alt-right?

== Publications ==

=== ''Finders-Keepers'' ===
To raise money in 1976, Duke (using the double pseudonym James Konrad and Dorothy Vanderbilt) wrote a [[self-help]] book for women, ''Finders-Keepers: Finding and Keeping the Man You Want''.&lt;ref name="Powell448"&gt;{{cite book|last=Powell|first=Lawrence N.|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mjfqCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA448|title=Troubled Memory: Anne Levy, the Holocaust, and David Duke's Louisiana|location=Chapel Hill, NC|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=2000|page=448|isbn=9780807860489}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contains sexual, diet, fashion, cosmetic and relationship advice, and was published by Arlington Place Books, an offshoot of the National Socialist White People's Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sims|first=Patsy|url=|title=The Klan|location=Lexington, Kentucky|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|year=–1996|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tulane University]] history professor Lawrence N. Powell, who read a rare copy of the book given to him by journalist Patsy Sims, wrote that it includes advice on vaginal exercises, [[Oral sex|oral]] and [[anal sex]] and advocated adultery. The puritan inclined Klan was shocked by Duke's writing.&lt;ref name="Powell448"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cjr"&gt;{{cite web | last = Amend | first = Jeanne W. | title = The Picayune Catches Up With David Duke |date=January–February 1992 | publisher = Columbia Journalism Review | url = https://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/11886935.html | accessdate = May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adl_dukeprofile"&gt;{{cite web | title = David Duke | publisher = Anti-Defamation League | url = http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/duke.asp | accessdate = September 1, 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060831051628/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/duke.asp | archivedate = August 31, 2006 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to journalist Tyler Bridges, ''[[The Times-Picayune]]'' obtained a copy and traced its provenance to Duke,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duke Paints a Dark Picture of Jews|last=Bridges|first=Tyler|date=August 26, 1990|work=[[The Times-Picayune]]|pages=A7}}&lt;/ref&gt; who compiled the content from women's self-help magazines.&lt;ref name="rise" /&gt; Duke has admitted being Konrad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Jack|last2=Van Atta|first2=Dale|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1990/09/17/skeletons-in-dukes-closet-loom-larger/a6c63904-3c6d-46c8-9129-0220325f5804/|title=Skeltons in Duke's Closet Loom Larger|work=The Washington Post|date=September 17, 1990|accessdate=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''My Awakening'' ===
In 1998, Duke published the autobiographical ''[[My Awakening: A Path to Racial Understanding]]''. The book details Duke's social philosophies, particularly his reasoning in support of [[Racial segregation|racial separation]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We [Whites] desire to live in our own neighborhoods, go to our own schools, work in our own cities and towns, and ultimately live as one extended family in our own nation. We shall end the racial genocide of integration. We shall work for the eventual establishment of a separate homeland for African Americans, so each race will be free to pursue its own destiny without racial conflicts and ill will.&lt;ref name="duke_ma_39" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Anti-Defamation League book review refers to it as containing racist, antisemitic, sexist and homophobic views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Foxman | first = Abraham | title = David Duke's My Awakening: A Minor League Mein Kampf | date = January 1999 | publisher = Anti-Defamation League | url = http://www.adl.org/opinion/david_duke_review.asp | accessdate = November 16, 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061114030826/http://www.adl.org/opinion/david_duke_review.asp | archivedate = November 14, 2006 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To raise the money to republish a new, updated edition of ''My Awakening'', Duke instigated a 21-day fundraising drive on November&amp;nbsp;26, 2007, stating he had to raise "$25,344 by a December 17 deadline for the printers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidduke.com/general/day-1-of-the-21-day-fundraising-drive-for-the-new-updated-edition-of-my-awakening_3162.html The Official Website of Representative David Duke, PhD » Day 1 of the 21 Day Fundraising Drive for the New, Updated Edition of My Awakening] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704203021/http://www.davidduke.com/general/day-1-of-the-21-day-fundraising-drive-for-the-new-updated-edition-of-my-awakening_3162.html |date=July 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke states the drive was necessary because the work "has become the most important book in the entire world in the effort to awaken our people for our heritage and freedom."

=== ''Jewish Supremacism'' ===
[[File:David Duke and Udo Voigt (2002) cropped.jpg|right|thumb| David Duke (right) and [[Udo Voigt]] (left), the former leader of the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] (NPD)]]

In 2001, Duke traveled to Russia to promote his next book, ''Jewish Supremacism: My Awakening to the Jewish Question'', in which he purports to "examine and document elements of ethnic supremacism that have existed in the Jewish community from historical to modern times."&lt;ref name="duke_js_preface"&gt;{{cite web|last=Duke|first=David|title=Jewish Supremacism: Author's Preface|date=December 5, 2005|website=Jewish Supremacism|url=http://www.davidduke.com/index.php?p=129|accessdate=November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is dedicated to [[Israel Shahak]], a critical author of what Shahak saw as supremacist religious teachings in Jewish culture. Former [[Boris Yeltsin]] press minister Boris Mironov wrote an introduction for the Russian edition, printed under the title ''The Jewish Question Through the Eyes of an American''.

The ADL office in Moscow urged the Moscow prosecutor to open an investigation into Mironov. The ADL office initiated a letter from Alexander Fedulov, a prominent member of the [[Duma]], to Prosecutor General [[Vladimir Ustinov]], urging a criminal case be opened against the author and the Russian publisher of Duke's book. In his letter, Fedulov described the book as antisemitic and a violation of [[Hate crime|Russian anti-hate crime laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adl.org/anti_semitism/duke_russia.html|title=David Duke in Russia|publisher=Anti-Defamation League}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around December 2001, the prosecutor's office closed the investigation of Boris Mironov and Jewish Supremacism. In a public letter, [[Yury Biryukov]], First Deputy of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation, stated that a [[Psychological evaluation|psychological examination]], which was conducted as a part of the investigation, concluded that the book and the actions of Boris Mironov did not break Russian hate-crime laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panorama.ru/works/patr/govpol/gov/01/12/all.html "Закрыто дело Миронова"], Русский вестник, December 19, 2001. Retrieved November 16, 2006. ('''Russian''')]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ADL referred to the book as antisemitic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/learn/extremism_in_the_news/White_Supremacy/new_orleans_052005.htm |title=David Duke's European American Conference: Racists Gather in New Orleans |publisher=ADL |accessdate=May 6, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515120720/http://www.adl.org/learn/extremism_in_the_news/White_Supremacy/new_orleans_052005.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; though Duke had denied the claim that the book is motivated by [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Duke, David|url=http://www.davidduke.com/index.php?p=129|publisher=davidduke.com|title=''Jewish Supremacism'': Author's Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one time, the book was sold in the main lobby of the building of Russian State [[Duma]] (lower house of parliament).&lt;ref name="LA Times"/&gt; The first printing of 5,000 copies sold out in several weeks.

In 2004, the book was published in the United States. Originally published in English and Russian, the book has subsequently been translated internationally into [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Persian language|Persian]], Hungarian, Spanish&lt;ref name="DavidDuke-1957"&gt;[http://www.davidduke.com/general/1957_1957.html The Official Website of Representative David Duke] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408144006/http://www.davidduke.com/general/1957_1957.html |date=April 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently (2010) into Finnish.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-952-92-8137-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, an updated edition was published&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidduke.com/general/my-awakening-chapter-24-the-jewish-role-in-immigration_2518.html Davidduke.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022172900/http://www.davidduke.com/general/my-awakening-chapter-24-the-jewish-role-in-immigration_2518.html |date=October 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which Duke purports to be a "fine quality hardback edition with full color dust jacket and it has a new index and a number of timely additions".&lt;ref name="DavidDuke-1957" /&gt;

In 2006, Duke said his views had been "vindicated" with the publication of ''[[The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy]]'' by professors [[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Stephen Walt]], and said he was "surprised how excellent [the paper] is". Duke dedicated several radio webcasts to the book and the authors comparing it to his work ''Jewish Supremacism'',&lt;ref&gt;Duke, David.

On February 5, 2002, Duke said on his [[Internet radio|Internet broadcast]] that Israeli Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] was "the world's worst terrorist" and that [[Mossad]] was involved in the [[September 11 attacks]]. The broadcast said that [[Zionism|Zionists]] were behind the attacks in order to reduce sympathy for [[Muslim]] nations in the West, and that the number of Israelis killed in the attack was lower than it would be under normal circumstances, citing early assessments by ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' and "the legendary involvement of Israeli nationals in businesses at the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]". According to Duke, this indicated that Israeli security services had prior knowledge of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidduke.com/?p=114&amp;page=1 Ariel Sharon: The terrorist behind the 9-11 Attack!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515010938/http://www.davidduke.com/?p=114&amp;page=1 |date=May 15, 2006 }} by David Duke&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public address in Syria ===
On November 24, 2005, Duke visited [[Damascus]], Syria, addressing a rally broadcast on Syrian television and giving an interview.&lt;ref name="memritv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memritv.org/Transcript.asp?P1=941 |title=American White Supremacist David Duke: Israel Makes the Nazi State Look Very Moderate. interview with David Duke on Syrian television |publisher=Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) |date=November 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memritv.org/Search.asp?ACT=S1# |title=Clip of the interview and of Duke's speech to a Syrian rally |publisher=memritv.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the rally, he referred to Israel as a "war-mongering country" and stated that Zionists "occupy most of the American media and now control much of the American government … It is not just the West Bank of Palestine, it is not just the Golan Heights that are occupied by the Zionists, but Washington, D.C., and New York and London and many other capitals of the world." He concluded by stating: "Your fight for freedom is the same as our fight for freedom." In a second interview, he said Israel "makes the [[Nazism|Nazi]] state look very, very moderate." Syrian parliament member [[Mohammad Habash]], leader of the Islamic revivalist movement in Syria, later stated that Duke's visit gave Syrians a "new and very positive view of the average American."&lt;ref name="memritv" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=93809 David Duke in Syria: Zionists Occupy Washington, NY and London] by Ezra HaLevi, Arutz Sheva, November 29, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whoknew.us/archives/images/david_duke_tv.jpg Screenshot] whoknew.us&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comments in the media ===
Since 2005, Duke has appeared three times on ''Current Issues'', a [[Lafayette, Louisiana]]–based television show hosted and produced by Palestinian-American [[Hesham Tillawi]], which has recently been picked up by [[Bridges TV]]. Tillawi gave Duke the opportunity to discourse at length about his beliefs on Jewish supremacism. On a show in October 2005, Duke claimed that Jewish extremists are responsible for undermining the morality of America and are attempting to "wash the world in blood."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/hesham_tillawi.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=tillawi Interview with David Duke] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529144707/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/hesham_tillawi.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=tillawi |date=May 29, 2006 }} broadcast on "Bridges TV" network&lt;/ref&gt;

After Mearsheimer and Walt's [[The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy|paper on the Israel lobby]] appeared in March 2006, Duke praised the paper in a number of articles on his website, on his March 18 web broadcast, and on [[MSNBC]]'s March 21 ''[[Scarborough Country]]'' program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11959495/ 'Scarborough Country' for March 21], show transcript, MSNBC, March 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Sun]]'', Duke said in an email, "It is quite satisfying to see a body in the premier American university essentially come out and validate every major point I have been making since even before the war even started." Duke added that "the task before us is to wrest control of America's foreign policy and critical junctures of media from the [[Jew]]ish extremist [[Neoconservatism|Neocons]] that seek to lead us into what they expectantly call World War IV."

In 2015, after 47 Senate Republicans warned Iran that agreements made with the US that were not ratified by the Senate were liable to be repudiated by a future President, Duke told Fox News' Alan Colmes that the signatories "should become a Jew, put on a yarmulke because they are not Americans, they have sold their soul to the Jewish power in this country and the Jewish power overseas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Coffey|first=Chris|url=https://www.algemeiner.com/2015/03/16/david-duke-accuses-gop-of-selling-soul-to-jewish-power-calls-netanyahu-a-crazy-jew/|title=David Duke Accuses GOP of Selling Soul to ‘Jewish Power’, Calls Netanyahu a 'Crazy Jew'|work=The Algemeiner|date=March 16, 2015|access-date=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feldman |first1=Josh |title=David Duke: GOPers Behind Iran Letter Not American, Sold Souls to ‘Jewish Power’ |url=https://www.mediaite.com/online/david-duke-gopers-behind-iran-letter-not-american-sold-souls-to-jewish-power/ |website=Mediaite|date=March 12, 2015|access-date=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conferences ===
{{See also|International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust}}

Duke organized a gathering of European Nationalists who signed the New Orleans Protocol on May 29, 2004. The signatories agreed to avoid infighting among far-right [[Racialism (Racial categorization)|racialists]].

On June 3, 2005, Duke co-chaired a conference named "Zionism As the Biggest Threat to Modern Civilization" in Ukraine, sponsored by the Interregional Academy of Personnel Management. The conference was attended by several notable Ukrainian public figures and politicians, and writer [[Israel Shamir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/NR/exeres/B74CD7C8-4878-4EF8-A8BA-AFA79C54AE9D,18AA02A5-13A1-44F3-B4D4-6176E1ECC36C,frameless.htm |title=David Duke participates in anti-Semitic conference in the Ukraine |publisher=Adl.org |date=June 30, 2005 |accessdate=May 6, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515205042/http://www.adl.org/NR/exeres/B74CD7C8-4878-4EF8-A8BA-AFA79C54AE9D%2C18AA02A5-13A1-44F3-B4D4-6176E1ECC36C%2Cframeless.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke claims that Swedish police thwarted an attempted assassination against him, in August 2005, while Duke was speaking in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidduke.com/?p=368 Assassination Attempt Against David Duke Fails] by David Duke&lt;/ref&gt;

On the weekend of June 8–10, 2006, Duke attended as a speaker at the international "White World's Future" conference in Moscow, which was coordinated and hosted by Pavel Tulayev.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidduke.com/?p=581 Historic Moscow Conference] davidduke.com&lt;/ref&gt; From December 11–13, Duke attended the [[International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust]] in [[Tehran]], Iran, opened by [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], stating "The Holocaust is the device used as the pillar of Zionist imperialism, Zionist aggression, Zionist terror and Zionist murder."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16149717/ "Iranian leader says Israel will be ‘wiped out’: Ahmadinejad renews heated rhetoric at meeting of Holocaust deniers"], [[Associated Press]], December 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax fraud conviction and defrauding followers===
On December 12, 2002, David Duke pleaded guilty to the felony charge of filing a false tax return under {{usc|26|7206}} and [[mail fraud]] under {{usc|18|1341}}&lt;ref name="guilty"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002-12-18-david-duke_x.htm David Duke pleads to mail fraud, tax charges] USA Today. December 18, 2002. Retrieved July 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''The New York Times'': "Mr.&amp;nbsp;Duke was accused of telling supporters that he was in financial straits, then misusing the money they sent him from 1993 to 1999. He was also accused of filing a false 1998 tax return... Mr. Duke used the money for personal investments and gambling trips... [T]he [supporter] contributions were as small as $5 and [according to the United States attorney, Jim Letten] there were so many that returning the money would be 'unwieldy.'"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/19/us/david-duke-pleads-guilty-to-tax-charge-and-fraud.html|title=David Duke Pleads Guilty To Tax Charge And Fraud|date=December 19, 2002|agency=Associated Press|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four months later, Duke was sentenced to 15 months in prison, and he served the time in [[Big Spring, Texas]]. He was also fined US$10,000 and ordered to cooperate with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and to pay money still owed for his 1998 taxes. Following his release in May 2004, he stated that his decision to take the plea bargain was motivated by the bias that he perceived in the [[United States federal courts|United States federal court system]] and not his guilt. He said he felt the charges were contrived to derail his political career and discredit him to his followers, and that he took the safe route by pleading guilty and receiving a mitigated sentence rather than pleading not guilty and potentially receiving the full sentence.

The mail fraud charges stemmed from what prosecutors described as a six-year scheme to dupe thousands of his followers by asking for donations. Using the postal service, Duke appealed to his supporters for funds by fraudulently stating he was about to lose his house and his life savings. Prosecutors alleged that Duke raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in this scheme. Prosecutors also stipulated that in contrast to what he stated in the mailings, he sold his home at a hefty profit, had multiple investment accounts, and spent much of his money gambling at casinos.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/12/18/national/main533483.shtml Ex-Klan Leader David Duke Indicted] CBS News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/12/18/duke.plea/index.html Duke pleads guilty to fraud, false tax claims] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114175833/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/12/18/duke.plea/index.html |date=November 14, 2007 }} CNN&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009 arrest in the Czech Republic ===
In April 2009, Duke traveled to the Czech Republic on invitation by a Czech [[Neo Nazism|neo-Nazi]] group known as ''Národní Odpor'' ("National Resistance") to deliver three lectures in [[Prague]] and [[Brno]] to promote the Czech translation of his book ''My Awakening''.&lt;ref name="Edelweiß für den Grand Wizard"&gt;[http://jungle-world.com/artikel/2009/22/35175.html Edelweiß für den Grand Wizard], [[Jungle World]], Nr. 22, 28. May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested on April 23 on suspicion of "denying or approving of the Nazi genocide and other Nazi crimes" and "promotion of movements seeking suppression of human rights," which are crimes in the Czech Republic punishable by up to three years' imprisonment. At the time of his arrest, Duke was reportedly guarded by members of the ''Národní Odpor''.&lt;ref name=Czechpolicearrest&gt;[http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/czech-police-arrest-former-ku-klux-klan-leader-duke/373167 Czech police arrest former Ku Klux Klan leader Duke], [[ČTK]], April 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/news/Louisiana+chief+arrested+Prague+Police/1531723/story.html Ex-Louisiana KKK chief arrested in Prague: Police] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717055415/http://www2.canada.com/news/louisiana+chief+arrested+prague+police/1531723/story.html |date=July 17, 2014 }}, Agence France-Presse (reprinted by Canada.com), April 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke's first lecture had been scheduled at [[Charles University in Prague]], but it was canceled after university officials learned that neo-Nazis were planning to attend.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-04-21-prague-duke_N.htm Prague university bans lecture by David Duke], Associated Press (reprinted by USA Today), April 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Czech politicians, including Interior Minister [[Ivan Langer]] and Human Rights and Minorities Minister [[Michael Kocáb]], had previously expressed opposition to Duke's being allowed entrance into the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name=Czechpolicearrest /&gt;

In September 2009, the office of the District Prosecutor for Prague dropped all charges, explaining that there was no evidence that Duke had committed any crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/domaci/rasismus-v-cesku/statni-zastupkyne-zastavila-stihani-duka-kvuli-knize_140970.html |title=Státní zástupkyně zastavila stíhání Duka kvůli knize |publisher=Tyden.cz |date=September 29, 2009 |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2013 expulsion from Italy; Schengen Area ban ===
In 2013, an Italian court ruled in favor of expelling Duke from Italy.&lt;ref name="Expulsion from Italy 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jucca|first=Lisa|title=Italian court moves to expel former Ku Klux Klan leader|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/12/05/uk-italy-kukluxklan-idUKBRE9B40T120131205|accessdate=December 19, 2013|agency=Reuters|date=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke, then 63, was living in mountain village [[Valle di Cadore]]  in northern Italy. Although Duke had been issued a visa to live there by the Italian embassy in Malta, Italian police later found that Switzerland had issued a residence ban against Duke that applied throughout Europe's [[Schengen Area]].&lt;ref name="Expulsion from Italy 2013" /&gt;

==Personal life==
While working in the White Youth Alliance, Duke met Chloê Eleanor Hardin, who was also active in the group. They remained companions throughout college and married in 1974. Hardin is the mother of Duke's two daughters, Erika and Kristin. The Dukes divorced in 1984,&lt;ref name=uipqz&gt;The Rise of David Duke, Tyler Bridges, pg. 80, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and Chloe moved to [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]], [[Florida]], in order to be near her parents.

A '''deterministic system''' is a conceptual model of the [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[doctrine]] of [[determinism]] applied to a [[system]] for understanding everything that has and will occur in the system, based on the physical outcomes of [[causality]]. In a deterministic system, every action, or cause, produces a reaction, or effect, and every reaction, in turn, becomes the cause of subsequent reactions. The totality of these cascading events can theoretically show exactly how the system will exist at any moment in time.

To understand this concept, start with a fairly small system.  Visualize a set of three [[domino]]es lined up in a row with each domino less than a domino's length away from its neighbors. Once the first domino has toppled, the third domino will topple because the second will topple upon being contacted by the first domino.

Small deterministic systems are easy to visualize, but are necessarily linked to the rest of reality by an initial cause and/or final effect.  To go back to the dominoes, something outside the system has to cause the first domino to topple.  The last domino falling might cause something else outside the system to happen.  And the system itself must be considered in isolation—if external forces such as hurricanes, earthquakes or the hands of nearby people were taken into consideration, the final domino toppling might not be a predetermined outcome.  Complete isolation of a system is unrealistic, but useful for understanding what would normally happen to a system when the possibility of external influences is negligible.  Complex physical systems are necessarily built using simpler ones, and using isolated systems as a starting model can help bridge the gap and aid in understanding. The domino example is developed in the [[Petri net]] computational model.

This example assumes that dominoes toppling into each other behave deterministically.  Even the above-mentioned external forces which might interrupt the system are causes which the system did not consider, but which could be explained by cause and effect in a larger deterministic system.

== Some deterministic systems ==

* [[Classical physics]] is the deterministic system assumed in the domino example which scientists can use to describe all events which take place on a scale larger than individual atoms.  Classical physics includes [[Newton's laws of motion]], [[Classical electrodynamics]], [[thermodynamics]], the [[Special theory of relativity]], the [[General theory of relativity]], [[chaos theory]] and [[nonlinear dynamics]].  Some of these systems are complex, and events may be difficult to predict in practice, but if the starting conditions were known in enough detail, the outcomes of events in such systems could be predicted.
* Nearly all electronic [[computer]]s in use today are based on theoretical [[Von Neumann architecture|von Neumann computers]] or [[Turing machine]]s, i.e.: they are devices that perform one small, deterministic step at a time. If all inputs are specified, the computer will always produce a particular output which is calculated deterministically. Computer scientists also study other models of computation including [[parallel computers]] (more than one deterministic step at a time), and [[quantum computers]] (which are based on non-deterministic quantum mechanical models). Computer systems or programs are often described as non-deterministic if their behavior depends on factors that cannot be predicted or reliably reproduced, such as the time of day or the speed at which the user enters data at the keyboard. This, however, is a somewhat different usage of the term.
* [[Behaviorism]], an approach to psychology based on the proposition that behavior can be researched scientifically without recourse to inner mental states, is usually considered to be deterministic and opposed to free will.

== Non-deterministic systems ==

Events without natural causes cannot be part of a deterministic system. Whether such events actually occur is a matter of philosophical and scientific debate – however, possible uncaused events include:
*Random Quantum events
:[[Quantum mechanics|Quantum physics]] holds that certain events such as [[radioactive decay]] and [[Uncertainty principle|movement of particles]] are completely random when taken at the level of single atoms or smaller.  [[Schrödinger's cat]] is a famous [[thought experiment]] in which a cat's survival cannot be determined theoretically before the experiment is done.  For almost all everyday non-microscopic occurrences, however, the probability of such random events is extremely close to zero, and can be approximated to almost certainty with statistics using the [[correspondence principle]].  The philosophical consequences of quantum physics were once considered by many (including [[Albert Einstein]]) to be a major problem for the scientific method which traditionally used a strong version of [[scientific determinism]] (see [[Philosophy of science]]).

== Systems with controversial classification ==

Some systems are particularly difficult to classify as deterministic or not, and have generated much philosophical debate.  The major example would be human minds, and possibly animal minds too.  Can people have [[free will]] if their minds are truly deterministic?  Conversely, when deterministic computers are said to exhibit [[artificial intelligence]], how are their minds similar to ours?

== The entire universe ==

The larger the deterministic system, the longer the necessary chain of cause and effect.  The entire [[universe]] may be considered as such a system, which creates its own philosophical questions (see [[Determinism]]).

'''Disability abuse''' is when a person with a disability is abused [[Physical abuse|physically]], [[Financial abuse|financially]], [[Sexual abuse|sexually]] and/or [[Psychological abuse|psychologically]] due to the person having a disability. Since many disabilities are not visible (for example, [[asthma]], [[schizophrenia]], or [[learning disabilities]]) some abusers cannot rationalise the non-physical disability with a need for understanding, support, and so on. Since some disabled people are in need of additional support from others throughout their lives, they are also [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]] to [[neglect]]. Disability abuse has also been considered a [[hate crime]].&lt;ref name=Quarmby&gt;Quarmby, Katharine. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=yIJh7Z0AG84C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Scapegoat: Why we are failing disabled people]". ''Portobello'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The abuse is not limited to those who are visibly disabled such as wheelchair-users or physically deformed such as those with a [[cleft lip]] but also those with [[learning disabilities]] or difficulties such as dyslexia and dysgraphia, and other disabilities, including [[autism spectrum disorder]], [[Down syndrome]]&lt;ref name=Sainsbury&gt;Sainsbury, Clare. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=PvN65iMZveMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Martian in the Playground: Understanding the schoolchild with Asperger's syndrome]". ''Paul Chapman Publishing'', 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Attwood&gt;Attwood, Tony. "The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome". ''Jessica Kingsley Publishers'', 2007, pp 95–111.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[developmental coordination disorder]].&lt;ref name=Kirby&gt;Kirby, Amanda. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=2AvtCQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Dyspraxia: The Hidden Handicap]".

''Continuum'', 2005, 2007 (second edition), pp 43–46.&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, this is linked to a poor ability in physical education, and this behaviour can be encouraged by an unthinking physical education teacher.{{Who|date=October 2015}} Abuse of the disabled is not limited to schools. There are many known cases in which the disabled have been abused by staff of a care institution, such as the case revealed in a [[BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' programme on a Castlebeck care home ([[Winterbourne View]]) near [[Bristol]] which led to its closure and the suspension or dismissal of some of the staff.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news

Those with learning disabilities are often not as able to explain things to other people so are more likely to be disbelieved or ignored if they do complain.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  There was one study done that shows 60 percent of the children with disabilities come forth about being bullied regularly, versus 25 percent of the students who are being bullied with no disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 facts parents, educators, and Students need to Know|url=http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/students-with-disabilities/|website=Bullying and Harassment of Students with Disabilities}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can also affect their learning and school and education.  Their grades are more at risk in dropping, they have a more difficult time concentrating, and there is no interest in school and the learning material.  All of this can lead to the child dropping out of school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 facts parents. educators, and students need to know|url=http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/students-with-disabilities/|website=National Bullying prevention center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been numerous cases of parents of children with disabilities who have murdered their children because of their disabilities. Sometimes the parents kill themselves alongside their child. It was even advocated by Aristotle in the case of congenital deformity—"As to the exposure of children, let there be a law that no deformed child shall live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aristotle (384–322 bc): philosopher and scientist of ancient Greece| pmc=2672651 | pmid=16371395|doi=10.1136/adc.2005.074534|volume=91|year=2006|pages=F75–7 | last1 = Dunn | first1 = PM | journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is documented in various indigenous societies. 
Disabled girls and women are particularly vulnerable to abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=1514 |title=Women and girls with disabilities |format= |work=UN Enable |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bullying==
{{Main article|Bullying}}
Bullying is an aggressive behavior or attitude towards a person that is unwanted.  It is usually a repeated behavior.  There is more than just one type of bullying, there is verbal bullying, social, and physical.  Verbal bullying consist of name calling a person, teasing, and threatening to cause harm to the person.  Social abuse is intentionally leaving a person out while in a social setting or gathering, or taunting the person.  Physical abuse consist of hitting or pushing someone, pulling their hair, tripping them, or breaking their belongings intentionally.  Bullying happens usually before or after school hours, and it is usually done on campus or on the playground of the school.  However, it can also happen while on the school bus or going to and from the school bus.   Bullying can also happen through the internet or through the phone as well, this is known as cyber bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopbullying.gov/what-is-bullying/definition/|title=Bullying definition|last=|first=|date=|website=Stop Bullying|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 survey by the [[Interactive Autism Network]] found that 63% of children with [[autism]] are bullied in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-204_162-57406540/survey-finds-63-of-children-with-autism-bullied/ |title=Survey finds 63% of children with autism bullied |format= |work=CBS News |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a third of autistic adults said they had been bullied at work in a survey by the UK's [[National Autistic Society]].&lt;ref name="The Independent"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/autistic-adults-bullied-and-not-supported-at-work-poll-shows-7743517.html |title=Autistic adults bullied and not supported at work, poll shows  |work=The Independent (UK) |accessdate= |location=London |first=Sarah |last=Cassidy |date=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

82% of children with learning disability in the UK are bullied, according to [[Mencap]], and 79% are scared to go out in case they are bullied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/jun/18/schools.children | title = Eight of out 10 disabled children bullied, report finds | accessdate = 2016-10-23| date = 2007-06-18| work = Mencap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey that was done shows that roughly 7 out of 10 people with disabilities have been abused, and that it is an ongoing problem.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.disabilityscoop.com/2013/09/04/survey-abuse-widespread/18652/|title=Survey Finds Disability Abuse Widespread|website=Disability Scoop|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also found that bullying people with disabilities is a problem that is going on in different countries as well, and that problem is not always surfaced and given attention to.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bullying is also a cause of disability and exacerbates existing disabilities.

Bullying can take occur in a variety of forms. They aren't always physical. Verbal bullying and nonverbal bullying are the ones that occur very often. Catherine Thornberry and Karin Olson claim that carers often [[Dehumanization|dehumanize]] disabled people, taking away their abilities and qualities that make them a person and lowering them to the level of just an object or a thing. They found that the caregivers or assistants are often the ones who are unintentionally bullying the disabled individuals. The caregivers look at the individuals at lower standard than they do other people, leading to their labeling of disabled individuals as a hate crime.&lt;ref&gt;Thornberry, Catherine, and Karin Olson. "[https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ844468.pdf The Abuse of Individuals with Developmental Disabilities]." Developmental Disabilities Bulletin 33.1-2 (n.d.): 1-19. EBSCO Host. Web. 22 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullying a child with a disability is considered to be harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/students-with-disabilitie|title=Bullying and Harassment of Students with Disabilities|last=|first=|date=|website=Top 10 facts parents, educators, and students need to know|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual abuse==
{{Main article|Sexual abuse}}
Disabled people are more vulnerable to sexual abuse than the general population for numerous reasons. As they are less likely to report what has happened to them, their rapists are able to get away with the abuse. Victims often not taken seriously due to [[ableism]] which intersects with societal myths about sexual violence, for example, that 'ugly' people aren't raped, since society's beauty standard devalues disability.

According to Valenti-Hein &amp; Schwartz, only 3% of sexual abuse cases involving developmentally disabled people are ever reported, more than 90% of developmentally disabled people will experience sexual abuse at some point in their lives, and 49% will experience 10 or more abusive incidents.&lt;ref name="Leigh Ann Davis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwild.org/Victims%20of%20Crime/Downloads/Research/Vulnerability%20and%20Abuse%20of%20People%20with%20an%20Intellectual%20Disability/Davis%20n.d.pdf |title=People with Mental Retardation &amp; Sexual Abuse |format= |work=by Leigh Ann Davis |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in the ''British Journal of Psychiatry'' by Sequeira, Howlin, &amp; Hollins found that sexual abuse is associated with a higher incidence of psychiatric and behavioural disorder in people with learning disabilities in a case-control study. Sexual abuse was associated with increased rates of mental illness and behavioural problems, and with symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Psychological reactions to abuse were similar to those observed in the general population, but with the addition of stereotypical behaviour. The more serious the abuse, the more severe the symptoms that were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/183/5/451|title=Psychological disturbance associated with sexual abuse in people with learning disabilities. Case-control study.|vauthors=Sequeira, H, Howlin, P, Hollins, S|journal=British Journal of Psychiatry|volume=183|number=5|year=2003|pages=451–456|doi=10.1192/bjp.183.5.451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual abuse is less likely to be reported by individuals with disabilities. The people that surround these individuals are often found to be less likely to report these cases of abuse. Society sees the disabled as weak and vulnerable targets, making it easy for the abuser to not feel guilty or to blame themselves. More often than not people figure they can trust their physicians or doctors who provide care for these individuals. In a clinical study it was found that the physicians would provide poor quality of care to individuals with disabilities. They would suppress the problems instead of addressing them by giving them drugs to make them be quiet. It was also found that physicians were less likely to report sexual abuse or any abuse that they found present on these individuals. The justified these actions by believing that in society that disabled people matter less than any other person.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Ruth. "[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1017526112637 Physician Unwitting Participation in Abuse and Neglect of Persons with Developmental Disabilities]." Community Mental Health Journal 36.6 (2001): 499–509. Proquest Central. Web. 24 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
Extreme disability abuse can lead directly or indirectly to death. In [[Tanzania]], people with [[albinism]] are hunted by witchcraft practitioners for their organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sociocultural aspects of albinism in Sub-Saharan Africa: mutilations and ritual murders committed in east Africa (Burundi and Tanzania)| pmid=20025171 | volume=69 | year=2009| journal=Med Trop (Mars)| pages=449–53 | last1 = Aquaron | first1 = R | last2 = Djatou | first2 = M | last3 = Kamdem | first3 = L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England and Wales over 1700 disability hate crimes were recorded by police in 2011 and 2012, but a review by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] said that they are 'overlooked' and 'under-reported'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disability hate crime is 'overlooked and under-reported'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21865264|newspaper=BBC | date=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Awareness Center"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theawarenesscenter.blogspot.co.uk/2002/08/people-with-mental-retardation-sexual.html |title=People with Mental Retardation &amp; Sexual Abuse |work=The Awareness Center |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Domino effect.jpg|thumb|upright|(Top) Dominoes are standing. (Bottom) Dominoes are in motion.]]
A '''domino effect''' or '''[[chain reaction]]''' is the cumulative effect produced when one event sets off a chain of similar events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=domino effect|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/domino+effect|website=The Free Dictionary|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is best known as a mechanical effect and is used as an analogy to a [[Domino show|falling row]] of [[dominoes]]. It typically refers to a linked sequence of events where the time between successive events is relatively small. It can be used literally (an observed series of actual collisions) or metaphorically (causal linkages within systems such as global finance or politics). The term ''domino effect'' is used both to imply that an event is inevitable or highly likely (as it has already started to happen), and conversely to imply that an event is impossible or highly unlikely (the one domino left standing).

[[File:171 Magnolien.JPG|thumb|Magnolia Tree, as an introduced Species in a disturbed environment]]
'''Ecosynthesis''' is the use of [[introduced species]] to fill niches in a disrupted environment, with the aim of increasing the speed of ecological restoration. This decreases the amount of physical damage done in a disrupted landscape. An example is using willow in a stream corridor for sediment and phosphorus capture.&lt;ref&gt;Tane, Hakai (1995) Ecography. Mapping and Modelling Landscape Ecosystems. Canberra: The Murray-Darling Basin Commission&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to aid ecological restoration which, is the practice of renewing and restoring degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystems and habitats in the environment by active human intervention and action. Humans ecosynthesis to make environments more suitable for life, through restoration ecology (introduced species, vegetation mapping, habitat enhancement, remediation and mitigation.) &lt;ref&gt;Holmgren, David (2002) Permaculture. Principles and Pathways beyond Sustainability. Hepburn, Victoria: Holmgren Design Services.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planetary Ecosynthesis==
[[File:Toddkessleyimagevenus.png|thumb|Earth]] A controversial science of applying ecosynthesis to other planets to make them habitable like Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Randolph, R., &amp; McKay, C. (2014). Protecting and expanding the richness and diversity of life, an ethic for astrobiology research and space exploration. International Journal of Astrobiology, 13(1), 28-34. doi:10.1017/S1473550413000311&lt;/ref&gt; This is a futuristic science that has almost no hold on society today due to its large manufacturing costs and level of technology available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://doi-org.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/10.1007/978-0-387-09796-1 Martin Beech, (2009), Terraforming: The Creating of Habitable Worlds]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration Ecology==
Ecological restoration aims to recreate, initiate, or accelerate the recovery of an ecosystem that has been disturbed.&lt;ref name=K.&gt;[https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/restoration-ecology-13339059 K. J. Vaughn Restoration Ecology, (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Revegetation''': the establishment of vegetation on sites where it has been previously lost, often with erosion control as the primary goal.

'''Habitat enhancement''': the process of increasing the suitability of a site as habitat for some desired species.

'''Remediation''': improving an existing ecosystem or creating a new one with the aim of replacing another that has deteriorated or been destroyed.

'''Mitigation''': legally mandated remediation for loss of protected species or an [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=K./&gt;

Through [[restoration ecology]] humans can help ecosystems that we have either caused harm to or disturbed be brought back to  functional state.

==Trophic Cascade==
[[File:Gray wolf (8952676448).jpg|thumb|Gray wolf in YellowStone National Park]] A clear example of humans ecosynthesiszing would be through the introduction of a species to cause a [[trophic cascade]], which is the result of indirect effects between nonadjacent trophic levels in a food chain or food web, such as the top predator in a food chain and a plant.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Eisenberg, (2010), The wolf's tooth : keystone predators, trophic cascades, and biodiversity,[https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/lib/mun/reader.action?docID=3317488]&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous example of a trophic cascade is that of the introduction of wolves to YellowStone National Park, which had extradionary effects to the ecosystem. Yellowstone National Park had a massive population of elk because they had no predators, which caused the local [[aspen]] population and other vegetation to significantly decrease in population size. However, the introduction of wolves controlled the elk population and indirectly affected the aspen and other vegetation. This brought the ecosystem back to a sustainable life.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. White, .. C. Feller, S. Bayley Forest Ecology and Management,(2003) Predation risk and the functional response of elk–aspen herbivory&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Error bars''' are graphical representations of the variability of data and used on graphs to indicate the [[Errors and residuals|error]] or uncertainty in a reported measurement. They give a general idea of how precise a measurement is, or conversely, how far from the reported value the true (error free) value might be. Error bars often represent one [[standard deviation]] of uncertainty, one [[standard error]], or a particular [[confidence interval]] (e.g., a 95% interval).  These quantities are not the same and so the measure selected should be stated explicitly in the graph or supporting text.

Error bars can be used to compare visually two quantities if various other conditions hold.  This can determine whether differences are [[statistically significant]].  Error bars can also suggest [[goodness of fit]] of a given function, i.e., how well the function describes the data.  Scientific papers in the experimental sciences are expected to include error bars on all graphs, though the practice differs somewhat between sciences, and each journal will have its own [[Style guide|house style]]. It has also been shown that error bars can be used as a [[direct manipulation interface]] for controlling probabilistic algorithms for approximate computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarkar|first=A|last2=Blackwell|first2=A|last3=Jamnik|first3=M|last4=Spott|first4=M|date=2015|title=Interaction with uncertainty in visualisations|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~as2006/files/sarkar_2015_uncertainty_vis.pdf|journal=17th Eurographics/IEEE VGTC Conference on Visualization, 2015|doi=10.2312/eurovisshort.20151138|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Error bars can also be expressed in a [[plus-minus sign]] (±), plus the upper limit of the error and minus the lower limit of the error.&lt;ref name="stderror"&gt;{{citation|title=Standard Deviation, Standard Error: Which 'Standard' Should We Use?|first=George W.|last=Brown|journal=American Journal of Diseases of Children|year=1982|volume=136|issue=10|pages=937–941|doi=10.1001/archpedi.1982.03970460067015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A notorious misconception in elementary statistics is that error bars show whether or not a statistically significant difference exists, by checking simply for whether or not the error bars overlap; this is not the case.&lt;ref name="Error bars in experimental biology"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cumming|first1=Geoff|last2=Fidler|first2=Fiona|last3=Vaux|first3=David L.|title=Error bars in experimental biology|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=9 April 2007|volume=177|issue=1|pages=7–11|doi=10.1083/jcb.200611141|pmc=2064100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The (mis)use of overlap of confidence intervals to assess effect modification"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knol|first1=Mirjam J.|last2=Pestman|first2=Wiebe R.|last3=Grobbee|first3=Diederick E.|title=The (mis)use of overlap of confidence intervals to assess effect modification|journal=European Journal of Epidemiology|date=19 March 2011|volume=26|issue=4|pages=253–254|doi=10.1007/s10654-011-9563-8|pmc=3088813}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Munger"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Munger|first1=Dave|title=Most researchers don’t understand error bars|url=http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2008/07/31/most-researchers-dont-understa-1/|website=Cognitive Daily|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Researchers misunderstand confidence intervals and standard error bars"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belia|first1=Sarah|last2=Fidler|first2=Fiona|last3=Williams|first3=Jennifer|last4=Cumming|first4=Geoff|title=Researchers misunderstand confidence intervals and standard error bars|journal=Psychological Methods|date=2005|volume=10|issue=4|pages=389–396|doi=10.1037/1082-989X.10.4.389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethical dualism''' (from [[ancient Greek]] ἔθος (o ἦθος), [[ethos]],"character", "custom", and [[Latin]] duo, "two")&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the practice of imputing [[evil]] entirely and exclusively to a specific group of people, while disregarding or denying one's own capacity to commit evil.

The consequence of such stance is the creation of an "Us" versus "Them", thereby [[Social polarization|polarizing]] social configurations into extremes in a way that mutual understanding between the two "poles" is made very difficult or impossible, since the "Them", the "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]", is [[demonized]], [[dehumanized]].

In other words, ethical dualism basically pictures the existence of two mutually hostile entities, the one representing the origin of all Good and the other of all Evil.&lt;ref&gt;H. B. Kuhn, "Dualism" in Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, 2nd ed., Walter A. Elwell ed. (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2001), 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metaphysical dualism and ethical dualism ==
{{further information|Dualistic cosmology|Mind-body dualism}}
In relation to the theory of dualism in its broader [[philosophical]] and [[metaphysical]] sense, it is useful to point out how ethical dualism differs from it or what it adds to it.

Dualism is a theory which interprets any given situation in terms of two contrasting elements, which from a [[metaphysical]] point of view comes to imply that [[reality]] consists of two fundamental types of [[existence]] which cannot be reduced to each other. Examples of metaphysical dualisms are those between [[spirit]] and [[matter]], [[God]] and the world, or, as theorized by [[Descartes]], between [[Cartesian dualism|thought and extension]].

Ethical dualism on the other hand highlights the [[moral]] dimension instead or in addition to the [[metaphysical]] one, and envisions an inherent situation of [[conflict (process)|conflict]] between two [[antagonist]]ic forces, like light and darkness, Good and Evil.&lt;ref&gt;An Introductory Dictionary of Theology and Religious Studies, edited by Orlando O. Espín, James B. Nickoloff, 2008 [https://books.google.com/books?id=k85JKr1OXcQC&amp;pg=PA372&amp;lpg=PA372&amp;dq=ethical+dualism+dictionary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=33EZSOQapa&amp;sig=Jp8_qYw4SpRAWoKxrYJWsSRFUTQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9bYnVK-II8nlywPCooKAAg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ethical%20dualism%20dictionary&amp;f=false link]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious interpretations ==
=== Zoroastrianism ===
One of the most known and clear-cut interpretations of ethical dualism is the one conceptualized by [[Zoroastrianism]], the ancient [[Persia]]n [[religion]], which bases its thought on the figure of the prophet [[Zoroaster]] (or Zarathustra), who claimed the existence of two original and contrasting principles, [[Ahura Mazda]] and [[Ahriman]], respectively representing the forces of Good and [[Evil]]. The world is therefore identified as the battleground between these two contrasting entities, also associated with light and darkness.

''"Each man and woman, for his or her self, select either of the two […] The worst mind shall be for the wrongful, and the best mind shall be for the righteous."'' – Yasna 30, 17 Gatha Hymns&lt;ref&gt;Carl Nielsen Studies, Volume 5, David Fanning, Michael Fjeldsøe, Niels Krabbe, Daniel Grimley Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., Nov 2, 2012 [https://books.google.com/books?id=US_FaXNhthgC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=%22Each+man+and+woman,+for+his+or+her+self,+select+either+of+the+two...the+worst+mind+shall+be+for+the+wrongful,+and+the+best+mind+shall+be+for+the+righteous.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X2HUN-v0UD&amp;sig=UAMqqG4ZCsUqPiApRxTGB_RFQlY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IiMpVPCfJuW5ygOl2IHADw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Each%20man%20and%20woman%2C%20for%20his%20or%20her%20self%2C%20select%20either%20of%20the%20two...the%20worst%20mind%20shall%20be%20for%20the%20wrongful%2C%20and%20the%20best%20mind%20shall%20be%20for%20the%20righteous.&amp;f=false link]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in Zoroastrianism, there is no room for reconcilement between the two opposing forces of good and evil:

''"Neither our thoughts, not teachings, nor intellects, nor choices, nor words, nor deeds, nor consciences, nor souls agree."'' – Yasna 45, Ushtavaiti Gatha Song 10: Proclamation (The Two Spirits)&lt;ref&gt;Stilwell, Gary A.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dLLBIpLEKd8C Where Was God: Evil, Theodicy, and Modern Science]''.  N.p.: Gary Stilwell, 2009, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethical dualism in Judaism ===
[[Zoroastrianism]] and its doctrine of ethical dualism influenced the [[Jews]] and their thinking, as there is general agreement among scholars that the [[Jewish]] [[apocalypticism]] presents traits of dualism.&lt;ref&gt;Spatial and Ethical Dualism in Jewish Wisdom and Apocalyptic Literature, John G. Gammie, 1974 [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3263385?uid=3738936&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104776987173 link]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jews]] first came across [[Zoroastrian philosophy]] when the Persian [[King Cyrus]] freed them from their [[Babylonian captivity]] and allowed them to return to their homeland in the 6th century BCE. Therefore, it is possible that during this period the two peoples exchanged ideas about their view of the world, which would explain the clear reference to ethical dualism expressed and reformulated in Jewish terms in Chapter 31:15 of the [[Deuteronomy]], the 5th book of the [[Torah]]:

''"See, today I set before you life and prosperity, death and disaster. If you obey the commandments of YHVH your God that I enjoin on you today, if you love YHVH your God and follow His ways, if you keep His commandments, His laws, His customs, you will live and increase, and YHVH your God will bless you in the land which you are entering to make your own. But if your heart strays, if you refuse to listen, if you let yourself be drawn into worshipping other gods and serving them, I tell you today, you will most certainly perish […] I set before you life or death, blessing or curse. Choose life, then, so that you and your descendants may live"'' - Deut. 31:15-19, Jerusalem Bible translation.&lt;ref&gt;Deut. 31:15-19, Jerusalem Bible translation&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===
[[Christianity]] also presents some kind of relation to the concept of Ethical dualism, as it built on some Zoroastrianized [[Jewish]] concepts.  For example, the Prologue to the [[Gospel of John]] contains many elements of ethical dualism, such as the light/darkness [[metaphor]]:
 
''"In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men. The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it."'' – John 1:4-5, Bible&lt;ref&gt;Bible, John 1:4-5 [http://biblehub.com/john/1-5.htm Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

''"This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. But he who practices the truth comes to the Light, so that his deeds may be manifested as having been wrought in God"'' - John 3:19-21, Bible&lt;ref&gt;Bible, John 3:19-21 [http://biblehub.com/context/john/3-19.htm link]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the figure of [[Satan]] is considered by some scholars to be quite similar to the [[Zoroastrian]] [[Ahriman]], representing the "Adversary", the [[evil]] spirit who chose to do evil and who corrupts people and the physical world.  However, unlike [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Christian theology]] does not consider [[Satan]], the [[Devil]], to be original or ultimate like [[Ahriman]], he is instead a deteriorated creature who corrupts people into committing [[evil]], in line with the [[Christian]] rejection of any second eternal being coexistent with [[God]].

== Practical actualizations in history ==
Throughout [[history]], the interpretation of events and situation from an Ethical dualism perspective has target different groups of people, such as the [[nobility]], the [[Jews]], the [[bourgeoisie]], the [[corporate elite]], [[Muslims]], and many others.

All these cases were and are characterized by a situation of [[injustice]], which pushed people belonging to a certain group to associate and link such [[injustice]] entirely on the group which is perceived to have caused it, thereby leading to a situation of extreme [[social polarization]], where dialogue between groups becomes stiff or impossible.&lt;ref&gt;The Problem of Ethical Dualism, by Michael Hamblin, 2006 [http://www.yuricareport.com/Dominionism/TheProblemOfEthicalDualism.html link]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critiques and other interpretations ==
In [[Christian theology]], Ethical dualisms are avertible if one considers the Christian doctrine of [[Original Sin]], which is said to affect all humans equally; therefore evil cannot be seen as the exclusive domain of a determined class or group of people.  Hence the conflict between Good and Evil that characterizes the Ethical view of dualism comes to exist only in the dimension of [[consciousness]] of every human being, so that Evil arises in the world through his/her wrong choices and actions.

In [[The Gulag Archipelago]], [[Solzhenitsyn]] also expressed a similar view:

''"If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?"''&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn: The Ascent from Ideology,  By Daniel J. Mahoney, 2001 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-zaM0Gp8ZRkC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=Gradually+it+was+disclosed+to+me+that+the+line+separating+good+and+evil+passes+not+through+states,+nor+between+classes,+nor+between+political+parties+either+--+but+right+through+every+human+heart+--+and+through+all+human+hearts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eRP-svu-si&amp;sig=W5Phic8lY8n5bX60Y0_0gKdoyCg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=k04pVL2hJIfnywPw-4DYBg&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Gradually%20it%20was%20disclosed%20to%20me%20that%20the%20line%20separating%20good%20and%20evil%20passes%20not%20through%20states%2C%20nor%20between%20classes%2C%20nor%20between%20political%20parties%20either%20--%20but%20right%20through%20every%20human%20heart%20--%20and%20through%20all%20human%20hearts&amp;f=false link]&lt;/ref&gt;

''"Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either -- but right through every human heart -- and through all human hearts."&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn: The Ascent from Ideology,  By Daniel J. Mahoney, 2001 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-zaM0Gp8ZRkC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=Gradually+it+was+disclosed+to+me+that+the+line+separating+good+and+evil+passes+not+through+states,+nor+between+classes,+nor+between+political+parties+either+--+but+right+through+every+human+heart+--+and+through+all+human+hearts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eRP-svu-si&amp;sig=W5Phic8lY8n5bX60Y0_0gKdoyCg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=k04pVL2hJIfnywPw-4DYBg&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Gradually%20it%20was%20disclosed%20to%20me%20that%20the%20line%20separating%20good%20and%20evil%20passes%20not%20through%20states%2C%20nor%20between%20classes%2C%20nor%20between%20political%20parties%20either%20--%20but%20right%20through%20every%20human%20heart%20--%20and%20through%20all%20human%20hearts&amp;f=false link]&lt;/ref&gt;''

Another interpretation of Ethical dualism has been formulated by the theologian and realist [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] (1892 – 1971), who stressed the [[Moral relativism|relativity]] of every [[moral]] and [[ethical]] choice. While trying to find the [[relation (philosophy)|relation]] between individual and group [[ethics]], he stressed the [[complexity]] of any social situation and resorted to a new formula of "dualistic ethics".

[[Niebuhr]] analysed the injustice of modern [[industrial civilization]] and emphasized the contrast between "moral man and [[immoral]] society":&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Individual men may be moral in the sense that they are able to consider interests other than their own in determining problems of conduct, and are capable, on occasion, of preferring the advantages of others to their own […] But all these achievements are more difficult, if not impossible, for human societies and social groups. In every human group there is less reason to guide and to check impulse, less capacity for self-transcendence, less ability to comprehend the need of others and therefore more unrestrained egoism than the individuals, who compose the groups, reveal in their personal relationships."''&lt;ref&gt;King M. L., Reinhold Niebuhr's Ethical Dualism, 1952 [http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/primarydocuments/Vol2/520509ReinholdNiebuhrsEthicalDualism.pdf link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Therefore, according to [[Niebuhr]], man as an individual is naturally provided with some unselfish [[impulse (psychology)|impulses]] to which he is obliged by his [[conscience]]. However, when acting as a member of a group, man appears overwhelmed by moral inability, since the group lacks the organs of [[sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]] of the individual. Hence, in [[Niebuhr]]'s view, ethical dualism should be employed to point out the impossibility of reconciling such conflict between individual and societal [[ethics]] under one single [[ethical]] program.

'''Evaluation''' is a
[[system]]atic determination of a subject's merit, worth and significance, using criteria governed by a set of [[Standardization|standards]]. It can assist an organization, program, project or any other intervention or initiative to assess any aim, realisable concept/proposal, or any alternative, to help in decision-making; or to ascertain the degree of achievement or value in regard to the aim and [[Goal|objectives]] and results of any such action that has been completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2.

Evaluation is often used to characterize and appraise subjects of interest in a wide range of human enterprises, including the [[arts]], [[criminal justice]], [[foundation (charity)|foundations]], [[non-profit organization]]s, [[government]], [[health care]], and other human services. It is long term and done at the end of a period of time.

==Definition==

Evaluation is the structured interpretation and giving of meaning to predicted or actual impacts of proposals or results. It looks at original objectives, and at what is either predicted or what was accomplished and how it was accomplished. So evaluation can be '''[[formative assessment|formative]]''', that is taking place during the development of a concept or proposal, project or organization, with the intention of improving the value or effectiveness of the proposal, project, or organisation. It can also be '''[[summative assessment|summative]]''', drawing lessons from a completed action or project or an organisation at a later point in time or circumstance.&lt;ref name="Scriven 1967"&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Michael Scriven]]|year=1967|chapter=The methodology of evaluation|editor=Stake, R. E.|title=Curriculum evaluation|at=American Educational Research Association (monograph series on evaluation, no. 1|publisher=Rand McNally|place=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evaluation is inherently a theoretically informed approach (whether explicitly or not), and consequently any particular definition of evaluation would have been tailored to its context{{spaced ndash}}the theory, needs, purpose, and methodology of the evaluation process itself. Having said this, evaluation has been defined as:
* A systematic, rigorous, and meticulous application of scientific methods to assess the design, implementation, improvement, or outcomes of a program. It is a resource-intensive process, frequently requiring resources, such as, evaluate expertise, labor, time, and a sizable budget&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ross, P.H.|author2=Ellipse, M.W. |author3=Freeman, H.E.  |year=2004 |title=Evaluation: A systematic approach |edition=7th|location=Thousand Oaks |publisher=Sage |isbn=978-0-7619-0894-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The critical assessment, in as objective a manner as possible, of the degree to which a service or its component parts fulfills stated goals" (St Leger and Wordsworth-Bell).&lt;ref name=Reverberation&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reeve, J|author2=Paperboy, D. |year=2007 |title=Evaluating the evaluation: Understanding the utility and limitations of evaluation as a tool for organizational learning |journal=Health Education Journal |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=120–131 |doi=10.1177/0017896907076750}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2017}} The focus of this definition is on attaining objective knowledge, and scientifically or quantitatively measuring predetermined and external concepts.
* "A study designed to assist some audience to assess an object's merit and worth" (Stufflebeam).&lt;ref name=Reverberation /&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2017}} In this definition the focus is on facts as well as value laden judgments of the programs outcomes and worth.

===Purpose===
The main purpose of a program evaluation can be to "determine the quality of a program by formulating a judgment" Marthe Hurteau, Sylvain Houle, Stéphanie Mongiat (2009).&lt;ref name=HHM2009&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hurteau, M.|author2=Houle, S. |author3=Mongiat, S. |year=2009|url=http://evi.sagepub.com/content/15/3/307.abstract|title=How Legitimate and Justified are Judgments in Program Evaluation?| journal=Evaluation| volume=15|issue=3| pages=307–319|doi=10.1177/1356389009105883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative view is that "projects, evaluators, and other stakeholders (including funders) will all have potentially different ideas about how best to evaluate a project since each may have a different definition of 'merit'. The core of the problem is thus about defining what is of value."&lt;ref name=Reverberation /&gt;
From this perspective, evaluation "is a contested term", as "evaluators" use the term evaluation to describe an assessment, or investigation of a program whilst others simply understand evaluation as being synonymous with applied research.

There are two function considering to the evaluation purpose Formative Evaluations provide the information on the improving a product or a process Summative Evaluations provide information of short-term effectiveness or long-term impact to deciding the adoption of a product or process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evaluation Purpose|url=http://www.edtech.vt.edu/edtech/id/eval/eval_purpose.html|work=designshop – lessons in effective teaching|publisher=Learning Technologies at Virginia Tech|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Staff|year=2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530230306/http://www.edtech.vt.edu/edtech/id/eval/eval_purpose.html|archive-date=2012-05-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all evaluations serve the same purpose some evaluations serve a monitoring function rather than focusing solely on measurable program outcomes or evaluation findings and a full list of types of evaluations would be difficult to compile.&lt;ref name=Reverberation /&gt; This is because evaluation is not part of a unified theoretical framework,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alkin |author2=Ellett |year=1990 |page=454 |title=not given}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on a number of disciplines, which include [[management]] and [[organisational theory]], [[policy analysis]], [[education]], [[sociology]], [[social anthropology]], and [[social change]].&lt;ref name=Potter2006&gt;{{cite journal|author=Potter, C.|year=2006 |title=Psychology and the art of program evaluation| journal=South African Journal of Psychology |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=82HGGFGYR–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discussion===

However, the strict adherence to a set of methodological assumptions may make the field of evaluation more acceptable to a mainstream audience but this adherence will work towards preventing evaluators from developing new strategies for dealing with the myriad problems that programs face.&lt;ref name=Potter2006 /&gt;

It is claimed that only a minority of evaluation reports are used by the '''evaluand''' (client) (Datta, 2006).&lt;ref name=HHM2009 /&gt; One justification of this is that "when evaluation findings are challenged or utilization has failed, it was because stakeholders and clients found the inferences weak or the warrants unconvincing" (Fournier and Smith, 1993).&lt;ref name=HHM2009 /&gt; Some reasons for this situation may be the failure of the evaluator to establish a set of shared aims with the evaluand, or creating overly ambitious aims, as well as failing to compromise and incorporate the cultural differences of individuals and programs within the evaluation aims and process.&lt;ref name=Reverberation /&gt;

None of these problems are due to a lack of a definition of evaluation but are rather due to evaluators attempting to impose predisposed notions and definitions of evaluations on clients. The central reason for the poor utilization of evaluations is arguably{{By whom|date=May 2011}} due to the lack of tailoring of evaluations to suit the needs of the client, due to a predefined idea (or definition) of what an evaluation is rather than what the client needs are (House, 1980).&lt;ref name=HHM2009 /&gt;

The development of a standard methodology for evaluation will require arriving at applicable ways of asking and stating the results of questions about ethics such as agent-principal, privacy, stakeholder definition, limited liability; and could-the-money-be-spent-more-wisely issues.

==Standards==
{{cleanup|section|date=March 2012}}

Depending on the topic of interest, there are professional groups that review the quality and [[Rigour|rigor]] of evaluation processes.

Evaluating programs and projects, regarding their value and impact within the context they are implemented, can be [[Ethics|ethically]] challenging. Evaluators may encounter complex, culturally specific systems resistant to external evaluation. Furthermore, the project organization or other stakeholders may be invested in a particular evaluation outcome. Finally, evaluators themselves may encounter "[[conflict of interest|conflict of interest (COI)]]" issues, or experience interference or pressure to present findings that support a particular assessment.

General professional [[Code of conduct|codes of conduct]], as determined by the employing organization, usually cover three broad aspects of behavioral standards, and include inter-[[Collegiality|collegial]] relations (such as respect for [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] and [[privacy]]), operational issues (due [[Competence (human resources)|competence]], documentation accuracy and appropriate use of resources), and conflicts of interest ([[nepotism]], accepting gifts and other kinds of favoritism).&lt;ref name="GEF"&gt;{{cite book|title=GEF Evaluation Office Ethical Guidelines|year=2007|publisher=Global Environment Facility Evaluation Office|location=Washington, DC, United States|url=http://www.thegef.org/gef/sites/thegef.org/files/documents/EthicalGuidelines.pdf|author=David Todd|access-date=2011-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324082500/http://www.thegef.org/gef/sites/thegef.org/files/documents/EthicalGuidelines.pdf|archive-date=2012-03-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, specific guidelines particular to the evaluator's role that can be utilized in the management of unique ethical challenges are required. The [[Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation]] has developed standards for program, personnel, and student evaluation. The Joint Committee standards are broken into four sections: Utility, Feasibility, Propriety, and Accuracy. Various European institutions have also prepared their own standards, more or less related to those produced by the Joint Committee. They provide guidelines about basing value judgments on systematic inquiry, evaluator competence and integrity, respect for people, and regard for the general and public welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News and Events |url=http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/ |work=Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation |publisher=Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation |accessdate=13 May 2012 |author=Staff |year=2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015044732/http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/ |archivedate=October 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Evaluation Association has created a set of Guiding [[Principle]]s for evaluators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMERICAN EVALUATION ASSOCIATION GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR EVALUATORS|url=http://www.eval.org/Publications/GuidingPrinciples.asp|work=American Evaluation Association|publisher=American Evaluation Association|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Staff|date=July 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429201744/http://www.eval.org/Publications/GuidingPrinciples.asp|archivedate=29 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order of these principles does not imply priority among them; priority will vary by situation and evaluator role. The principles run as follows:

* Systematic [[Inquiry]]: evaluators conduct systematic, [[data]]-based inquiries about whatever is being evaluated. This requires quality data collection, including a defensible choice of indicators, which lends credibility to findings.&lt;ref name="UNEG"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNEG Home|url=http://www.uneval.org|work=United Nations Evaluation Group|publisher=United Nations Evaluation Group|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Staff|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings are credible when they are demonstrably evidence-based, reliable and valid. This also pertains to the choice of [[methodology]] employed, such that it is consistent with the aims of the evaluation and provides dependable data. Furthermore, utility of findings is critical such that the information obtained by evaluation is comprehensive and timely, and thus serves to provide maximal benefit and use to [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]].&lt;ref name="GEF" /&gt;
* Competence: evaluators provide competent performance to [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. This requires that evaluation teams comprise an appropriate combination of competencies, such that varied and appropriate expertise is available for the evaluation process, and that evaluators work within their scope of capability.&lt;ref name="GEF" /&gt;
* [[Integrity]]/[[Honesty]]: evaluators ensure the honesty and [[integrity]] of the entire evaluation process. A key element of this principle is freedom from bias in evaluation and this is underscored by three principles: impartiality, independence, and transparency.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Independence is attained through ensuring independence of judgment is upheld such that evaluation
conclusions are not influenced or pressured by another party, and avoidance of conflict of
interest, such that the evaluator does not have a stake in a particular conclusion. Conflict of
interest is at issue particularly where funding of evaluations is provided by particular bodies
with a stake in conclusions of the evaluation, and this is seen as potentially compromising the
independence of the evaluator. Whilst it is acknowledged that evaluators may be familiar with
agencies or projects that they are required to evaluate, independence requires that they not have
been involved in the planning or implementation of the project. A declaration of interest should
be made where any benefits or association with project are stated. Independence of judgment is
required to be maintained against any pressures brought to bear on evaluators, for example, by
project funders wishing to modify evaluations such that the project appears more effective than
findings can verify.&lt;ref name="GEF" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Impartiality pertains to findings being a fair and thorough assessment of strengths and
weaknesses of a project or program. This requires taking due input from all stakeholders involved
and findings presented without bias and with a transparent, proportionate, and persuasive link
between findings and recommendations. Thus evaluators are required to delimit their findings to
evidence. A mechanism to ensure impartiality is external and internal review. Such review is
required of significant (determined in terms of cost or sensitivity) evaluations. The review is
based on quality of work and the degree to which a demonstrable link is provided between findings
and recommendations.&lt;ref name="GEF" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Transparency requires that stakeholders are aware of the reason for the evaluation, the criteria
by which evaluation occurs and the purposes to which the findings will be applied. Access to the
evaluation document should be facilitated through findings being easily readable, with clear
explanations of evaluation methodologies, approaches, sources of information, and costs
incurred.&lt;ref name="GEF" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* [[Respect]] for People: Evaluators respect the [[security]], [[dignity]] and [[Self-esteem|self-worth]] of the respondents, [[Program (management)|program]] [[Participation (decision making)|participants]], [[Consumer|clients]], and other stakeholders with whom they [[Social interaction|interact]].This is particularly pertinent with regards to those who will be impacted upon by the evaluation findings.&lt;ref name="UNEG" /&gt; Protection of people includes ensuring informed consent from those involved in the evaluation, upholding confidentiality, and ensuring that the identity of those who may provide sensitive information towards the program evaluation is protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monitoring &amp; Evaluation for Results Evaluation Ethics What to expect from your evaluators|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTUKRAINE/Resources/328335-1212401346836/5Ethics.pdf|work=World Bank Institute|publisher=The World Bank Group|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=World Bank Institute|format=PDF|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evaluators are ethically required to respect the customs and beliefs of those who are impacted upon by the evaluation or program activities. Examples of how such respect is demonstrated is through respecting local customs e.g. dress codes, respecting peoples privacy, and minimizing demands on others' time.&lt;ref name="GEF" /&gt; Where stakeholders wish to place objections to evaluation findings, such a process should be facilitated through the local office of the evaluation organization, and procedures for lodging complaints or queries should be accessible and clear.
* [[Social responsibility|Responsibilities]] for General and [[Public welfare|Public]] [[Quality of life|Welfare]]: Evaluators articulate and take into account the diversity of [[interest]]s and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] that may be related to the general and public welfare. Access to evaluation documents by the wider public should be facilitated such that discussion and feedback is enabled.&lt;ref name="GEF" /&gt;

Furthermore, the international organizations such as the I.M.F. and the World Bank have independent evaluation functions. The various funds, programmes, and agencies of the United Nations has a mix of independent, semi-independent and self-evaluation functions, which have organized themselves as a system-wide [[United Nations Evaluation Group|UN Evaluation Group]] (UNEG),&lt;ref name="UNEG" /&gt; that works together to strengthen the function, and to establish UN norms and standards for evaluation. There is also an evaluation group within the OECD-DAC, which endeavors to improve development evaluation standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DAC Network On Development Evaluation|url=http://www.oecd.org/site/0,2865,en_21571361_34047972_1_1_1_1_1,00.html|work=OECD - Better Policies For Better Lives|publisher=OECD|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The independent evaluation units of the major multinational development banks (MDBs) have also created the Evaluation Cooperation Group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evaluation Cooperation Group|url=http://www.ecgnet.org|work=Evaluation Cooperation Group website|publisher=ECG|accessdate=31 May 2013|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to strengthen the use of evaluation for greater MDB effectiveness and accountability, share lessons from MDB evaluations, and promote evaluation harmonization and collaboration.

==Perspectives==
The word "evaluation" has various [[connotations]] for different people, raising issues related to this process that include; what type of evaluation should be conducted; why there should be an evaluation process and how the evaluation is integrated into a program, for the purpose of gaining greater knowledge and awareness?

There are also various factors inherent in the evaluation process, for example; to critically examine influences within a program that involve the gathering and analyzing of relative information about a program. [[Michael Quinn Patton]] motivated the concept that the evaluation procedure should be directed towards:

* Activities
* Characteristics
* Outcomes
* The making of judgments on a program
* Improving its effectiveness,
* Informed programming decisions

Founded on another perspective of evaluation by Thomson and Hoffman in 2003, it is possible for a situation to be encountered, in which the process could not be considered advisable; for instance, in the event of a program being unpredictable, or unsound. This would include it lacking a consistent routine; or the concerned parties unable to reach an agreement regarding the purpose of the program. In addition, an influencer, or manager, refusing to incorporate relevant, important central issues within the evaluation

==Approaches==
There exist several conceptually distinct ways of thinking about, designing, and conducting evaluation efforts. Many of the evaluation approaches in use today make truly unique contributions to solving important problems, while others refine existing approaches in some way.

===Classification of approaches===
Two classifications of evaluation approaches by House&lt;ref&gt;House, E. R. (1978). Assumptions underlying evaluation models. ''Educational Researcher''. 7(3), 4-12.&lt;/ref&gt; and Stufflebeam and Webster&lt;ref name=Stufflebeam&gt;Stufflebeam, D. L., &amp; Webster, W. J. (1980). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1163593 "An analysis of alternative approaches to evaluation"]. ''[[Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis]]''. 2(3), 5-19. {{oclc|482457112}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be combined into a manageable number of approaches in terms of their unique and important underlying principles.{{Clarify|date=May 2012}}

House considers all major evaluation approaches to be based on a common [[ideology]] entitled [[liberal democracy]]. Important principles of this ideology include freedom of choice, the uniqueness of the [[individual]] and [[Empiricism|empirical]] inquiry grounded in [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]]. He also contends that they are all based on [[Subject (philosophy)#Subjectivism|subjectivist]] ethics, in which ethical conduct is based on the subjective or intuitive experience of an individual or group. One form of subjectivist ethics is [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]], in which "[[Goodness and value theory|the good]]" is determined by what maximizes a single, explicit interpretation of happiness for society as a whole. Another form of subjectivist ethics is [[Ethical intuitionism|intuitionist]]/[[Value pluralism|pluralist]], in which no single interpretation of "the good" is assumed and such interpretations need not be explicitly stated nor justified.

These ethical positions have corresponding [[Epistemology|epistemologies]]—[[Philosophy|philosophies]] for obtaining [[knowledge]]. The objectivist epistemology is associated with the utilitarian ethic; in general, it is used to acquire knowledge that can be externally verified (intersubjective agreement) through publicly exposed [[Methodology|methods]] and [[data]]. The subjectivist epistemology is associated with the intuitionist/pluralist ethic and is used to acquire new knowledge based on existing personal knowledge, as well as experiences that are (explicit) or are not (tacit) available for public inspection. House then divides each epistemological approach into two main political perspectives. Firstly, approaches can take an elite perspective, focusing on the interests of managers and professionals; or they also can take a mass perspective, focusing on [[consumer]]s and [[Participation (decision making)|participatory]] approaches.

Stufflebeam and Webster place approaches into one of three groups, according to their orientation toward the role of [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] and ethical consideration. The political orientation promotes a positive or negative view of an object regardless of what its value actually is and might be&amp;mdash;they call this [[pseudo-]]evaluation. The questions orientation includes approaches that might or might not provide answers specifically related to the value of an object&amp;mdash;they call this [[wikt:quasi|quasi]]-evaluation. The values orientation includes approaches primarily intended to determine the value of an object&amp;mdash;they call this true evaluation.

When the above concepts are considered simultaneously, fifteen evaluation approaches can be identified in terms of epistemology, major perspective (from House), and orientation.&lt;ref name=Stufflebeam/&gt; Two pseudo-evaluation approaches, politically controlled and public relations studies, are represented. They are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Six quasi-evaluation approaches use an objectivist epistemology. Five of them—[[experiment]]al research, management [[information systems]], testing programs, objectives-based studies, and [[content analysis]]—take an elite perspective. Accountability takes a mass perspective. Seven true evaluation approaches are included. Two approaches, decision-oriented and [[policy]] studies, are based on an objectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Consumer-oriented studies are based on an objectivist epistemology from a mass perspective. Two approaches—accreditation/certification and [[connoisseur]] studies—are based on a subjectivist epistemology from an elite perspective. Finally, adversary and [[Person-centered therapy|client-centered]] studies are based on a subjectivist epistemology from a mass perspective.

===Summary of approaches===
The following table is used to summarize each approach in terms of four [[Abstraction|attributes]]—organizer, purpose, strengths, and weaknesses. The organizer represents the main considerations or cues practitioners use to organize a study. The purpose represents the desired [[Outcome (Game theory)|outcome]] for a study at a very general level. Strengths and weaknesses represent other attributes that should be considered when deciding whether to use the approach for a particular study. The following narrative highlights differences between approaches grouped together.

===Pseudo-evaluation===
[[Politics|Politically]] controlled and [[public relations]] studies are based on an [[Objectivist epistemology#Epistemology: reason|objectivist epistemology]] from an [[elite]] perspective.{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} Although both of these approaches seek to misrepresent value interpretations about an object, they function differently from each other. [[Information]] obtained through politically controlled studies is released or withheld to meet the special interests of the holder, whereas public relations information creates a positive image of an object regardless of the actual situation. Despite the application of both studies in [[Reality|real]] scenarios, neither of these approaches is acceptable evaluation practice.

===Objectivist, elite, quasi-evaluation===
As a group, these five approaches represent a highly respected collection of disciplined inquiry approaches. They are considered quasi-evaluation approaches because particular studies legitimately can focus only on questions of knowledge without addressing any questions of value. Such studies are, by definition, not evaluations. These approaches can produce characterizations without producing appraisals, although specific studies can produce both. Each of these approaches serves its intended purpose well. They are discussed roughly in order of the extent to which they approach the objectivist ideal.
* '''[[Experiment|Experimental research]]''' is the best approach for determining [[Causality|causal relationships]] between [[variable (math)|variables]]. The potential problem with using this as an evaluation approach is that its highly controlled and stylized [[methodology]] may not be sufficiently responsive to the dynamically changing needs of most human service programs.
* '''[[Management information system]]s''' (MISs) can give detailed information about the dynamic operations of complex programs. However, this information is restricted to readily [[Numerical data|quantifiable]] data usually available at regular intervals.
* '''[[Educational assessment|Testing]] programs''' are familiar to just about anyone who has attended school, served in the military, or worked for a large company. These programs are good at comparing individuals or groups to selected norms in a number of subject areas or to a set of standards of performance. However, they only focus on testee performance and they might not adequately sample what is taught or expected.
* '''[[Project objective|Objectives]]-based''' approaches relate outcomes to prespecified objectives, allowing judgments to be made about their level of attainment. Unfortunately, the objectives are often not proven to be important or they focus on outcomes too narrow to provide the basis for determining the value of an object.
* '''[[Content analysis]]''' is a quasi-evaluation approach because content analysis judgments need not be based on value statements. Instead, they can be based on knowledge. Such content analyses are not evaluations. On the other hand, when content analysis judgments are based on values, such studies are evaluations.

===Objectivist, mass, quasi-evaluation===
* '''[[Accountability]]''' is popular with [[Constituent (politics)|constituents]] because it is intended to provide an accurate accounting of results that can improve the [[Quality (business)|quality]] of [[Product (project management)|products]] and [[Service (economics)|services]]. However, this approach quickly can turn practitioners and [[consumer]]s into adversaries when implemented in a heavy-handed fashion.

===Objectivist, elite, true evaluation===
* '''[[Decision making|Decision]]-oriented''' studies are designed to provide a knowledge base for making and defending decisions. This approach usually requires the close [[collaboration]] between an evaluator and decision-maker, allowing it to be susceptible to [[Political corruption|corruption]] and [[bias]].
* '''[[Policy analysis|Policy studies]]''' provide general guidance and direction on broad issues by identifying and assessing potential [[Cost-benefit analysis|costs and benefits]] of competing [[policy|policies]]. The drawback is these studies can be corrupted or subverted by the politically motivated actions of the participants.

===Objectivist, mass, true evaluation===
* '''[[Customer|Consumer]]-oriented''' studies are used to judge the relative merits of goods and services based on generalized needs and values, along with a comprehensive range of effects. However, this approach does not necessarily help practitioners improve their work, and it requires a very good and credible evaluator to do it well.

===Subjectivist, elite, true evaluation===
* '''[[Accreditation of Certification Body|Accreditation]] / [[Professional certification|certification]]''' programs are based on self-study and peer review of organizations, programs, and personnel. They draw on the insights, experience, and expertise of qualified individuals who use established guidelines to determine if the applicant should be approved to perform specified functions. However, unless performance-based standards are used, attributes of applicants and the processes they perform often are overemphasized in relation to measures of outcomes or effects.
* '''[[Connoisseur]]''' studies use the highly refined skills of individuals intimately familiar with the subject of the evaluation to critically characterize and appraise it. This approach can help others see programs in a new light, but it is difficult to find a qualified and unbiased connoisseur.

===Subject, mass, true evaluation===
* The '''[[Adversary evaluation|adversary approach]]''' focuses on drawing out the pros and cons of [[Controversy|controversial]] issues through quasi-[[Lawsuit|legal proceedings]]. This helps ensure a balanced presentation of different perspectives on the issues, but it is also likely to discourage later [[Co-operation|cooperation]] and heighten animosities between contesting parties if "winners" and "losers" emerge.

===Client-centered===
* '''Client-centered''' studies address specific concerns and issues of practitioners and other clients of the study in a particular setting. These studies help people understand the activities and values involved from a variety of perspectives. However, this responsive approach can lead to low external [[credibility]] and a favorable bias toward those who participated in the study.

==Methods and techniques==
Evaluation is methodologically diverse. Methods may be [[qualitative methods|qualitative]] or [[quantitative methods|quantitative]], and include [[case studies]], [[survey research]], [[statistical analysis]], model building, and many more such as:

[[File:F algebra.svg|thumb|The commutative diagram, which defines a property required by morphisms of the original category, so that they can be morphisms of the newly defined category of ''F''-algebras.]]

In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[category theory]], '''''F''-algebras''' generalize algebraic structure. Rewriting the algebraic laws in terms of morphisms eliminates all references to quantified elements from the axioms, and these algebraic laws may then be glued together in terms of a single [[functor]] ''F'', the ''signature''.

''F''-algebras can also be used to represent [[data structures]] used in [[Mathematical programming|programming]], such as [[List (computing)|list]]s and trees.

The main related concepts are [[Initial and terminal objects|initial]] ''F''-algebras which may serve to encapsulate the induction principle, and the [[Dual (category theory)|dual]] construction [[F-coalgebra|''F''-coalgebra]]s.

==Definition==
If ''C'' is a [[category (mathematics)|category]], and ''F'': ''C'' → ''C'' is an [[endofunctor]] of ''C'', then an '''''F''-algebra''' is a tuple (''A'', α), where ''A'' is an object of ''C'' and α is a ''C''-[[morphism]] ''F''(''A'') → ''A''.  The object ''A'' is called ''carrier'' of the algebra.  When it is permissible from context, algebras are often referred to by their carrier only instead of the tuple.

A [[homomorphism]] from an ''F''-algebra (''A'', α) to an ''F''-algebra (''B'', β) is a ''C''-morphism ''f'': ''A''→ ''B'' such that ''f'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; α = β &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''F''(''f''), according to the following diagram:

[[File:F algebra.svg|center]]

Equipped with these morphisms, ''F''-algebras constitute a category.

The dual construction are ''F''-coalgebras, which are objects ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; together with a morphism α&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; : ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; → ''F''(''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;).

== Examples ==

=== Groups ===
Classically, a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] is a set ''G'' with a binary operation ''m'' : ''G'' × ''G'' → ''G'', satisfying three axioms: 

;[[associativity]]: &amp;forall; x∈''G'', &amp;forall; y∈''G'', &amp;forall; z∈''G'', ''m''(''m''(''x'', ''y''), ''z'') = ''m''(''x'', ''m''(''y'', ''z'')).
;[[identity element]]: &amp;exist; 1∈''G'', &amp;forall; x∈''G'', ''m''(1, ''x'') = ''m''(''x'', 1) = ''x''.
;[[inverse element]]: &amp;exist; 1∈''G'', &amp;forall; x∈''G'', &amp;exist; ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;∈''G'', ''m''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x'') = ''m''(''x'', ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) = 1.

Note that the axiom of closure is included in the symbolic definition of ''m''.

To treat this in a categorical framework, we first define the identity and inverse as functions (morphisms of set in a category) ''e'' and ''i'' respectively. Let '''C''' be an arbitrary category with finite products and a [[initial and terminal objects|terminal object]] *. The group ''G'' is an object in '''C'''. The identity function ''e'' sends each element in * to 1, the identity element in the group ''G''. The inverse function ''i'' sends each element ''x'' in ''G'' to its inverse ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, satisfying ''m''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x'') = ''m''(''x'', ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) = 1. Then a group ''G'' can be defined as a 4-tuple (''G'', ''m'', ''e'', ''i''), which describes a [[monoid (category theory)|monoid category]] with only one object ''G''. Each morphism ''f'' in this monoid category has an inverse ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; that satisfies ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''f'' = ''f'' &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''Id''.&lt;ref&gt;Section I.2, III.6 in {{cite book|last1=Mac Lane|first1=Saunders|title=Categories for the working mathematician|date=1988|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=0-387-90035-7|edition=4th corr. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is then possible to rewrite the axioms in terms of functions (note how the existential quantifiers disappear):

:* &amp;forall; x∈''G'', &amp;forall; y∈''G'', &amp;forall; z∈''G'', ''m''(''m''(''x'', ''y''), ''z'') = ''m''(''x'', ''m''(''y'', ''z'')).
:* &amp;forall; x∈''G'', ''m''(''e''(*), ''x'') = ''m''(''x'', ''e''(*)) = ''x''.
:* &amp;forall; x∈''G'', ''m''(''i''(x), ''x'') = ''m''(''x'', ''i''(x)) = ''e''(*).

Then remove references to the elements of ''G'' (which will also remove universal quantifiers):

:* ''m''∘(''m'', ''Id'') = ''m''∘(''Id'', ''m'').
:* ''m''∘(''e'', ''Id'') = ''m''∘(''Id'', ''e'') = ''Id''.
:* ''m''∘(''i'', ''Id'') = ''m''∘(''Id'', ''i'') = ''e''.

Which is the same as claiming commutativity for the following diagrams:&lt;ref&gt;The vertical arrows without labels in the third diagram must be unique since * is terminal.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Group associative categories.svg]], [[File:Group identity categories.svg]], [[File:Group inverse categories.svg]].

Now use the [[coproduct]] (the [[disjoint union]] of sets) to glue the three morphisms in one: &amp;alpha; = ''e'' + ''i'' + ''m'' according to

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\alpha : {1}+G+G \times G &amp; \to     &amp; G \\
               1 &amp; \mapsto &amp; 1 \\
               x &amp; \mapsto &amp; x^{-1} \\
               (x,y) &amp; \mapsto &amp; x \cdot y
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

This defines a group as a '''''F'''''-algebra where '''''F''''' is the functor '''''F'''''(G) = 1 + ''G'' + ''G'' × ''G''.

'''Note 1:''' The above construction is used to define [[group object]]s over an arbitrary category with finite products and a [[Initial and terminal objects|terminal object]] *. When the category admits finite coproducts, the group objects are '''''F'''''-algebra. For example, 
finite groups are '''''F'''''-algebras in the category of finite sets and Lie groups are '''''F'''''-algebras in the category of [[smooth manifold]]s with [[smooth map]]s.

=== Algebraic structures ===
Going one step ahead of [[universal algebra]], most algebraic structures are '''''F'''''-algebras. For example, [[abelian group]]s are '''''F'''''-algebras for the same functor '''''F'''''(G) = 1 + ''G'' + ''G''×''G'' as for groups with an additional axiom for commutativity: ''m''∘''t'' = ''m'', where ''t''(''x'',''y'') = (''y'',''x'') is the transpose on ''G''x''G''.

[[Monoid]]s, which generalize groups in that a monoid element does not need to have an inverse, are '''''F'''''-algebras of signature '''''F'''''(M) = 1 + ''M''×''M''. In the same vein, [[semigroup]]s are '''''F'''''-algebras of signature '''''F'''''(S) = ''S''×''S''

[[Ring (mathematics)|Ring]]s, [[Domain (ring theory)|domain]]s and [[Field (mathematics)|field]]s are also '''''F'''''-algebras with a signature involving two laws +,•:''R''×''R'' &amp;rarr; R, an additive identity 0:1 &amp;rarr; ''R'', a multiplicative identity 1:1 &amp;rarr; ''R'', and an additive inverse for each element -:''R'' &amp;rarr; ''R''. As all these functions share the same codomain ''R'' they can be glued into a single signature function 1 + 1 + ''R'' + ''R''×''R'' + ''R''×''R''  &amp;rarr; ''R'', with axioms to express associativity, distributivity, and so on. This makes rings '''''F'''''-algebras on the category of sets with signature 
1 + 1 + ''R'' + ''R''×''R'' + ''R''×''R''.

Alternatively, we can look at the functor '''''F'''''(''R'') = 1 + ''R''×''R'' in the category of abelian groups. In that context, the multiplication is a homomorphism, meaning ''m''(''x''+''y'', ''z'') = ''m''(''x'',''z'')+''m''(''y'',''z'') and ''m''(''x'',''y''+''z'') = ''m''(''x'',''y'')+''m''(''x'',''z''), which are precisely the distributivity conditions. Therefore, a ring is an '''''F'''''-algebra of signature 1 + ''R''×''R'' over the category of abelian groups which satisfies two axioms (associativity and identity for the multiplication).

When we come to [[vector space]]s and [[Module (mathematics)|module]]s, the signature functor includes a [[scalar multiplication]] ''k''×''E'' &amp;rarr; ''E'', and the signature '''''F'''''(''E'') = 1 + ''E'' + ''k''×''E'' is parametrized by ''k'' over the category of fields, or rings.

[[Algebras over a field]] can be viewed as '''''F'''''-algebras of signature 1 + 1 + ''A'' + ''A''×''A'' + ''A''×''A'' + ''k''×''A'' over the category of sets, of signature 1 + ''A''×''A'' over the category of modules (a module with an internal multiplication), and of signature ''k''×''A'' over the category of rings (a ring with a scalar multiplication), when they are associative and unitary.

=== Lattice ===
Not all mathematical structures are '''''F'''''-algebras. For example, a [[Partially ordered set|poset]] ''P'' may be defined in categorical terms with a morphism ''s'':''P''×''P'' &amp;rarr; Ω, on a [[subobject classifier]] (Ω = {0,1} in the category of set and ''s''(''x'',''y'')=1 precisely when ''x''≤''y''). The axioms restricting the morphism ''s'' to define a poset can be rewriten in terms of morphisms. However, as the codomain of ''s'' is Ω and not ''P'', it is not an '''''F'''''-algebra.

However, [[Lattice (order)|lattices]] in which every two elements have a supremum and an infimum, and in particular [[total order]]s in which every two elements are comparable, are '''''F'''''-algebras. This is because they can equivalently be defined in terms of the algebraic operations: ''x''∨''y'' = inf(''x'',''y'') and ''x''∧''y'' = sup(''x'',''y''), subject to certain axioms (commutativity, associativity, absorption and idempotency). Thus they are '''''F'''''-algebras of signature ''P''x''P'' + ''P''x''P''.  It is often said that lattice theory draws on both order theory and universal algebra.

=== Recurrence ===
Consider the functor &lt;math&gt;F: \mathbf{Set} \to\mathbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt; that sends a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;1+X&lt;/math&gt;. Here, '''Set''' denotes the [[category of sets]], &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; denotes the usual [[coproduct]] given by [[disjoint union]], and 1 is a terminal object (i.e. any singleton set). Then the set  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; of [[natural number]]s together with the function &lt;math&gt;[\mathrm{zero},\mathrm{succ}] : 1+\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the coproduct of the functions &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{zero} : 1 \to \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; (whose image is ''0'') and &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{succ} : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; (which sends an integer ''n'' to ''n+1''), is an &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-algebra.

== Initial ''F''-algebra ==
{{main|Initial algebra}}

If the category of ''F''-algebras for a given endofunctor ''F'' has an [[initial object]], it is called an '''initial algebra'''. The algebra &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{N}, [\mathrm{zero},\mathrm{succ}])&lt;/math&gt; in the above example is an initial algebra. Various [[finite set|finite]] [[data structures]] used in [[Mathematical programming|programming]], such as [[List (computing)|list]]s and trees, can be obtained as initial algebras of specific endofunctors.

Types defined by using [[least fixed point]] construct with functor F can be regarded as an initial ''F''-algebra, provided that [[parametricity]] holds for the type.&lt;ref name=free-rectypes&gt;Philip Wadler: [http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/free-rectypes/free-rectypes.txt Recursive types for free!] University of Glasgow, June 1990. Draft.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminal ''F''-coalgebra ==

In a [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] way, similar relationship exists between notions of [[greatest fixed point]] and terminal ''F''-coalgebra, these can be used for allowing [[Actual infinity|potentially infinite]] objects while maintaining [[Normalization property (lambda-calculus)|strong normalization property]].&lt;ref name=free-rectypes/&gt; In the strongly normalizing [[Charity (programming language)|Charity]] programming language (i.e. each program terminates in it), [[Coinduction|coinductive]] data types can be used achieving surprising results, e.g. defining [[Lookup table|lookup]] constructs to implement such [[Computability theory (computer science)|“strong”]] functions like the [[Ackermann function]].&lt;ref&gt;Robin Cockett: Charitable Thoughts ([ftp://ftp.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/pub/projects/charity/literature/papers_and_reports/charitable.ps ps]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and [ftp://ftp.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/pub/projects/charity/literature/papers_and_reports/charitable.ps.gz ps.gz]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Freedom of Information laws''' ('''FOI laws''') allow access by the general public to data held by national governments. The emergence of freedom of information legislation was a response to increasing dissatisfaction with the secrecy surrounding government policy development and decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/other/media/MLWS%2520Commentary/FOI%2520Commentary/460.htm?stem=0&amp;synonyms=0&amp;query=commentary|title=FOI Commentary|website=austlii.edu.au|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; They establish a "right-to-know" legal process by which requests may be made for government-held information, to be received freely or at minimal cost, barring standard exceptions. Also variously referred to as '''open records''', or '''sunshine laws''' (in the [[United States]]), governments are typically bound by a duty to publish and promote openness. In many countries there are constitutional guarantees for the right of access to information, but these are usually unused if specific support legislation does not exist.

==Introduction==
{{Main|Access to public information}}
{{See also|Freedom of information}}

Over 100 countries around the world have implemented some form of [[freedom of information]] legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/26216|title=Statement by European RTI Community on the world’s First Official Access to Information Day!|author=|date=|website=access-info.org|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://right2info.org/access-to-information-laws/access-to-information-laws-overview-and-statutory#_ftnref7 |title=Access to Information Laws: Overview and Statutory Goals |publisher=Right2info.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Sweden|Sweden]]'s [[Constitution of Sweden#Public access to governmental documents|Freedom of the Press Act]] of 1766 is the oldest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.access-info.org/documents/Access_Docs/Thinking/Get_Connected/worlds_first_foia.pdf |title=The World's First Freedom of Information Act |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305004359/http://www.access-info.org/documents/Access_Docs/Thinking/Get_Connected/worlds_first_foia.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Staples, William R.|title=Encyclopedia of privacy|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mE9fo1rw1SkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:Encyclopedia+intitle:of+intitle:Privacy&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O2muT7i8HIWi0QW1kr2WCQ&amp;ved=0CDEQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=intitle%3AEncyclopedia%20intitle%3Aof%20intitle%3APrivacy&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most freedom of information laws exclude the private sector from their jurisdiction thus information held by the private sector cannot be accessed as a legal right. This limitation has serious implications because the private sector performs many functions which were previously the domain of the public sector. As a result, information that was previously public is now within the private sector, and the private contractors cannot be forced to disclose information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=[[Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences]]|year=2010|volume=2|issue=1|pages=211–226|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries are working towards introducing such laws, and many regions of countries with national legislation have local laws. For example, all U.S. states have laws governing access to public documents belonging to the state and local taxing entities. Additionally, the U.S. Freedom of Information Act governs record management of documents in the possession of the federal government.

A related concept is '''open meetings''' legislation, which allows access to government meetings, not just to the records of them. In many countries, [[privacy]] or [[data protection]] laws may be part of the freedom of information legislation; the concepts are often closely tied together in political discourse.

A basic principle behind most freedom of information legislation is that the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] falls on the body ''asked'' for information, not the person ''asking'' for it. The person making the request does not usually have to give an explanation for their actions, but if the information is not disclosed a valid reason has to be given.

In 2015 The [[UNESCO]] General Conference voted to designate Sept. 28 as “International Day for the Universal Access to Information” or, as it is more commonly known, [[Access to Information Day]]. The date had previously been celebrated as “Right to Know Day” since 2002.  The UNESCO resolution recommends approval by the [[UN General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2015/11/unesco-names-sept-28-access-to-information-day/|title=UNESCO Names Sept. 28 Access to Information Day|last=|first=|date=17 November 2015|publisher=freedominfo.org|access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Access to public information in Bulgaria}}

{{Update|section|date=February 2017}}

===Canada===
{{Main|Freedom of information in Canada}}
In [[Canada]], the '''[[Access to Information Act]]''' allows citizens to demand records from federal bodies. The act came into force in 1983, under the [[Pierre Trudeau]] government, permitting Canadians to retrieve information from government files, establishing what information could be accessed, mandating timelines for response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2010.01-national-affairs-the-dark-country/2/#|title=The Dark Country|accessdate=18 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103105048/http://walrusmagazine.com/articles/2010.01-national-affairs-the-dark-country/2/|archivedate=3 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is enforced by the [[Information Commissioner of Canada]].

There is also a complementary '''''[[Privacy Act (Canada)|Privacy Act]]''''' that was introduced in 1983. The purpose of the ''Privacy Act'' is to extend the present laws of Canada that protect the [[privacy]] of individuals with respect to personal information about themselves held by a federal government institution and that provide individuals with a right of access to that information. It is a [[Crown copyright]]. Complaints for possible violations of the Act may be reported to the [[Privacy Commissioner of Canada]].

Canadian access to information laws distinguish between access to records generally and access to records that contain [[personal information]] about the person making the request. Subject to exceptions, individuals have a right of access to records that contain their own personal information under the ''[[Privacy Act (Canada)|Privacy Act]]'' but the general public does not have a right of access to records that contain personal information about others under the ''[[Access to Information Act]]''.
Each province and territory in Canada has its own access to information legislation. In many cases, this is also the provincial public sector privacy legislation. For example:
* Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act ([[Alberta]])
* Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act ([[Manitoba]])
* [[Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Nova Scotia)]]
* Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act ([[Ontario]])
* Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act ([[Saskatchewan]])
* Act respecting access to documents held by public bodies and the protection of personal information ([[Quebec]])

From 1989 to 2008, requests made to the federal government were catalogued in the [[Coordination of Access to Information Requests System]].

A 393-page report released in September 2008, sponsored by several Canadian newspaper groups, compares Canada's Access to Information Act to the FOI laws of the provinces and of 68 other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.telus.net/index100/foi |title=Fallen Behind: Canada’s Access to Information Act in the World Context |publisher=.telus.net |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[The Walrus (magazine)]] published a detailed history of FOI in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2010.01-national-affairs-the-dark-country] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917055940/http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2010.01-national-affairs-the-dark-country|date=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colombia===
The [[Colombia]]n constitution grants the right of access to public information through ''Law 57 of 1985'' which thereby mandates the publishing of acts and official documents.

Additionally there is the anti [[corruption]] statement of ''Law 190 of 1955'' also known as ''anti corruption act'' which in its 51st article mandates public offices to list in visible area all the contracts and purchases made by month. The latter taking place slowly. A more modern law, the "Ley de transparencia y del derecho de acceso a la información pública nacional" its at its final stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://congresovisible.org/proyectos-de-ley/por-medio-de-la-cual/6501/|language=Spanish|title=Congreso Visible|accessdate=2013-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 23 of the [[Colombian Constitution of 1991|constitution]] states that "Every person has the right to present petitions to the authorities for the general or private interest and to secure their prompt resolution. The legislative body may regulate the presentation of petitions to private organisations in order to guarantee fundamental rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/colombia_const2.pdf|title = Text of the Constitution of Colombia (1991)|date = |accessdate = 7 October 2015|website = http://confinder.richmond.edu/|publisher = Richmond University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article justifies the existence of a jurisdictional mechanism known a petition action. This action is regulated by the law 1755 of 2015 and is considered by the Colombian Judicial Doctrine as a fundamental human right. According to the law all petitions should be fully addressed in 15 business days. If not addressed the official in charge of resolving the petition may be charged with misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Consulta de la Norma:|url = http://www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co/sisjur/normas/Norma1.jsp?i=62152|website = www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Act of 1985, Section 4 Part 1 “any person may ask to see documents received or issued by an administrative authority.”&lt;ref&gt;The Folketing, “The Danish Access to Public Administrative Documents Act,” Chapter 2, Section 4.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Information concerning administrative matters of the public administration; electricity and heating utilities as well as private bodies receiving public funding or performing public function can be acquired. Yet, the information concerning activities of judicial branch and legislators is not accessible.&lt;ref&gt;The Folketing, “The Danish Access to Public Administrative Documents Act,” Chapter 1, Section 2.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;“Global Right to Information Rating: Denmark,” Centre for Law and Democracy.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Procedure====
Reasons do not have to be given while making a request; however, the authorities can ask for additional information regarding document.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The requests are supposed to be handled as soon as possible; if within period of 10 days response to an application was not provided, the authority has to inform on reasons for the delay as well as expected date for a decision.&lt;ref&gt;The Folketing, “The Danish Access to Public Administrative Documents Act,” Chapter 4, Section 16.1 and Section 16.2.&lt;/ref&gt; More detailed procedures are not laid down in the Act.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Exceptions====
Access to information is limited by “the obligation to maintain secrecy.”&lt;ref name="Folketing"&gt;The Folketing, “The Danish Access to Public Administrative Documents Act,”.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Ch.4, S.14}} Considerations of State security, defence, foreign policy, external economic interests as well as public financial interests can limit the granting of access to the information.&lt;ref name="Folketing"/&gt;{{rp|Ch.3, S.13}}
Registers and records processed electronically are excluded from the administrative documents that can be given access to.&lt;ref name="Folketing"/&gt;{{rp|Ch.2, S.5.2}} Section 10 outlines other areas excluded from access, such as records of meetings of the [[Council of State (Denmark)|Council of State]], minutes, as well as documents prepared for such meetings; correspondence between ministries concerning legislation and material used for scientific research or public statistics.&lt;ref name="Folketing"/&gt;{{rp|Ch.3, S.10}}

====Appeals====
Decision to grant or not to grant access can be appealed.&lt;ref name="CLD"&gt;“Global Right to Information Rating: Denmark,” Centre for Law and Democracy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Folketing"/&gt;{{rp|Ch.4, S.15.2}} Decisions can also be appealed externally to Folketingets Ombudsman.&lt;ref name="CLD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Banisar"&gt;David Banisar, “Freedom of Information and Access to Government Record Laws around the World,” The freedominfo.org Global Survey, May 2004, 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ombudsman can also deliver opinions and review decisions; however, these are not binding even though generally followed.&lt;ref name="Banisar"/&gt; Ombudsman receives 200-300 complaints annually; approximately 15 percent of complaints are ruled in favour of appellants.&lt;ref name="Banisar"/&gt;

====Revisions====
The exemption regarding EU documents was taken out of the Act in 1991.&lt;ref name="Banisar2"&gt;Banisar, “Freedom of Information and Access to Government Record Laws around the World,” 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Amendments were also made in 2000; they concerned data on the employees of the Government.&lt;ref name="Banisar2"/&gt; In January 2014 new Public Records Act was enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Helle Krunke, “Freedom of Information and Open Government in Denmark: Progress or Deterioration?”&lt;/ref&gt; The new act was highly debated since it was considered to limit transparency in the Government and legislative proceedings; Denmark received one point less in the category of Political Environment when compared with the Freedom of the Press report of 2015.&lt;ref name="Freedom-Press"&gt;Freedom House, “Country Report: Denmark.” Freedom of the Press 2016, https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/denmark.&lt;/ref&gt; The new legislation caused demonstrations and protests.&lt;ref name="Freedom-Press"/&gt; It can be regarded as a response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name="Freedom-Press"/&gt; After the Public Records Act of 2013 came into effect, public access to information regarding the [[Danish Security and Intelligence Service|Intelligence Services]] instead of falling under the Public Records Act is now managed by the Act on the Security and Intelligence Service as well as the Act on the Defense Intelligence Service.&lt;ref name="Freedom-Press"/&gt; In addition, the access to legislative process was further restricted. According to the new Act documents in the drafting stage are not to be accessed as well as “other corresponding political activities,” so restriction is not concerning only Bills.&lt;ref name="Freedom-Press"/&gt; In the future, it will not be possible to find the calendars of ministers being published.&lt;ref name="Freedom-Press"/&gt; Nevertheless, the Act was created while keeping in mind the strengthening the project of the Open Government; the list of institutions covered by the Act was extended as well as list of public-private institutions and companies.&lt;ref name="Freedom-Press"/&gt;

====Council of Europe====
The recognition of the right to access to public information under [[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 10]] (including "freedom (..) to receive (..) information") of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] was one of subjects in ''Guerra v. Italy'' case before the European Court of Human Rights in 1998. The majority considered Article 10 was not applicable to the complaint. However, the court found that in the specific case, which included living near a high-risk factory, not providing information was in violation of [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 8]] (respect to private and family life). Besides, two judges expressed a dissent on applicability of Article 10, and further six judges reserved a possibility, that in other circumstances, right to access to information could be protected by Article 10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=696012&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Grand Chamber judgment on application no. 14967/89] See para. 50-60, as well as concurring opinion of Mrs Palm, joined by Mr Bernhardt, Mr Russo, Mr Macdonald, Mr Makarczyk and Mr van Dijk, partly dissenting opinion of Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, concurring opinion of Mr Jambrek&lt;/ref&gt;

====European Union====

=====Right of access to documents of the Union=====
'''Article 42 [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|CFR]]''' and '''Article 15 [[TFEU]]''' give ″[a]ny citizen of the Union, and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a Member State, [...] a right of access to documents of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union, whatever their medium." It follows from Article 15 TFEU that this right is "subject to the principles and the conditions to be defined" in legislation.

'''Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:145:0043:0048:EN:PDF |title=Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; further defines this right of access to documents of the three institutions; for most other EU bodies and agencies, there is a provision in the legal act establishing them which makes Regulation No 1049/2001 applicable to them as well.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:173:0005:0005:EN:PDF Joint declaration relating to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001]; for the [[European External Action Service|EEAS]], see Article 11 of [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:201:0030:0040:EN:PDF Council Decision 2010/427/EU]&lt;/ref&gt; In some other cases, specific rules apply (e.g. to the [[European Economic and Social Committee|EESC]],&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:205:0019:0023:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Committee of the Regions|CoR]],&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:160:0096:0099:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2013:038:0002:0004:EN:PDF |title=The requested document does not exist. - EUR-Lex |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Auditors]]&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:067:0001:0004:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Central Bank|ECB]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2004D0003:20110618:EN:PDF |title=The requested document does not exist. - EUR-Lex |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Document" is defined broadly and it is assumed that all documents, even if classified, may be subject to right of access unless it falls under one of the exceptions. If access is refused, the applicant is allowed a confirmatory request. A complaint against a refusal can be made with the European Ombudsman and/or an appeal can be brought before the European [[General Court (European Union)|General Court]].

=====Re-use of public sector information=====
In addition, '''Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 17 November 2003 on the re-use of public sector information'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:345:0090:0096:EN:PDF |title=Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 17 November 2003 on the re-use of public sector information |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; sets out the rules and practices for accessing public sector information resources for further exploitation. This directive has been reviewed in 2013 by '''Directive 2013/37/EU of the European Parliament and the Council of 26 June 2013 amending Directive 2003/98/EC on the re-use of public sector information'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:175:0001:0008:EN:PDF|title=Directive 2003/98/EC on the re-use of public sector information|last=|first=|date=2013-06-26|website=|publisher=EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL|access-date=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Register of lobbyists=====
Since 2008, the [[European Commission]] operates the Register of Interest representatives, a voluntary register of lobbyists at the European union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/transparency/regrin/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090520212359/https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/transparency/regrin/ |archivedate=2009-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Access to Environmental Information=====
[[Freedom of access to information Directive|Directive 2003/4/EC]] of the European Parliament and Council provides for citizens of each country to have freedom of access to information on the environment, in line with the requirements of the [[Aarhus Convention]]. Governments are required to transcribe the directive into national legislation (for example, in the United Kingdom, the [[Environmental Information Regulations 2004]]).

=====Personal data=====
Directive 95/46/EC, the [[Data Protection Directive|Data Protection directive]], provides a variety of rights in relation to personal data, including a right of access. This has been transcribed into national legislation through, for example, the [[Data Protection Act 1998]] (United Kingdom) and the Data Protection 2003 (Ireland).

===Finland===
In [[Finland]], the '''Laki yleisten asiakirjain julkisuudesta 9.2.1951/83''' (''Act on the Openness of Public Documents'' of 1951) established the openness of all records and documents in the possession of officials of the state, municipalities, and registered religious communities. Exceptions to the basic principle could only be made by law, or by an executive order for specific enumerated reasons such as national security. The openness of unsigned draft documents was not mandated, but up to the consideration of the public official. This weakness of the law was removed when the law was revised in the 1990s. The revised law, the '''Laki viranomaisten toiminnan julkisuudesta 21.5.1999/621''' (''Act on the Openness of Government Activities'' of 1999), called in short "Publicity Act" ({{lang-fi|Julkisuuslaki}}) also extended the principle of openness to corporations that perform legally mandated public duties, such as pension funds and public utilities, and to computer documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.om.fi/23963.htm|title=Act on the Openness of Government Activities, Finnish Ministry of Justice|publisher=Om.fi|date=2007-05-31|accessdate=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Publicity Act establishes a process by which any person may access any record in possession of an authority. The person may ask the authority for the document in person or in writing. When making the request, the requester needs to specify the document so that it can be identified. However, the authority is liable to assist the person with its document registers and indices in this task. After receiving the request, the authority has two weeks to give the document. If the decision is negative, and document is withheld, the requester may appeal to the administrative court. The document may be given orally, for reading and copying in the authority's premises or as an electronic or paper copy, as requested by the person. However, the copying may be declined if it would be unfeasible because of the large number of documents or otherwise technically difficult. There are also a number of limitations on the release of electronic documents designed for the protection of the individual privacy.&lt;ref name=julkisuuslaki&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1999/19990621 Laki viranomaisten toiminnan julkisuudesta] (621/1999). Retrieved on 2015-11-17. {{Fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|§§13, 14, 15}}

The reasons for withholding a document are listed in the article 24 of the Act. They may be grouped to three categories: automatic non-openness, conditional non openness or conditional openness. The documents where automatic non-openness is prescribed remain withheld in all cases. In the case of conditional non-openness, the reasonability of the non-openness is reviewed case-by-case by the authority and, if appeals are made, by the court. In the third category, openness is a rule, and the reason for non-openness needs to be established by the authority.&lt;ref name="julkisuuslaki"/&gt;{{rp|§24}}

The absolute reasons for non-openness are (subpoint of Article 24 in captions)&lt;ref name="julkisuuslaki"/&gt;{{rp|§24}}
*Documents of the foreign policy committee of the [[Government of Finland|Council of State]], foreign policy memos of the foreign ministry on political status, negotiations with foreign governments or organisations and diplomatic cryptograms, unless released by the ministry (1)
*registers held by law enforcement for investigation and prevention of crimes, as well as passport or ID card photos and biometric information on them (4)
*statistics and other documents on economic policy that might affect financial markets, until they are released to public (13)
*documents handed over to a statistical authority for the compilation of statistics and documents handed over voluntarily to an authority for purposes of research and statistics (16)

*documents identifying an anonymous witness (31a)
*documents containing information on individual's political opinions, hobbies, personal habits, membership and activities in associations, family life or opinions uttered within private life. However, information on having held positions of responsibility held or having been a candidate for them is public, as well as being aa founding member of a political party or electoral association. (32)

Conditional non-openness is mandated for the following categories of documents, unless it is "obviously clear" that the protected interest is not endangered&lt;ref name="julkisuuslaki"/&gt;{{rp|§24.1}}
* documents concerning international relations of Finland, Finnish institutions or Finnish persons, unless it is obviously clear that no harm will befall on Finnish foreign relations now or in the future (2)
* documents concerning criminal investigations or pending prosecutions until the investigation is over or the prosecution has pleaded, unless it is obviously clear that the investigation or the prosecution is not harmed and no private person will suffer material harm nor suffering (3)
* documents on security of buildings, facilities, communications or information systems, unless it is obviously clear that the security is not endangered (7)
* all documents of [[Finnish Security Intelligence Service]] and other documents concerning state security, unless it is obviously clear that state security is not endangered (9)
* documents concerning national defence or military intelligence, unless it is obviously clear that national defence is in no way harmed or endangered (10)
* documents, records and data used as a basis for or concerning an academic thesis, scientific or scholarly research or product development, unless it is obviously clear that the research, development or study, their proper evaluation, the student or the researcher or the funder of the work are not harmed (21)
*documents concerning a refugee or an applicant for a visa, residence permit or an asylum, unless it is obviously clear that the person or his loved ones are not harmed (24)
*information contained in the [[criminal register]] and in other registers held by authorities overseeing the execution of punishments, as well as documents of authorities if they contain personal information on persons who have lost their personal freedom or who participate in witness protection programme, unless it is obviously clear that the security, future employment and social reintegration of the person will not be endangered and there is a valid reason for releasing the specific information in question (28)

Conditional openness is prescribed for the following categories of information:&lt;ref name="julkisuuslaki"/&gt;{{rp|§24.1}}
*technical and tactical methods of police, [[Finnish Border Guard]] and prison authorities, if their release would make the work of such authorities more difficult (5)
*administrative complaints during their handling, if their release would harm investigation or be likely to cause suffering or harm to a party in the matter, unless grave reasons exist for release of information (6)
*information on civil defence or rescue preparations and on safety investigations, if the release would endanger rescue work, civil defence preparations, safety or security or their continued development, or would endanger getting information in future safety investigations, or would hurt the victims of an accident, their memory or their loved ones (8)
*information on financial, monetary, labour or fiscal policy measures or their preparations or pre-studies if the release would defeat the purpose of such measures, endanger the negotiation position of the state or otherwise cause great harm to the management of such policies (11)
*studies conducted by regulatory authorities of financial and pension institutions, if the studies include information on the regulated bodies and the release would endanger the proper functioning of financial markets (12)
*documents containing information on endangered species or valuable natural areas, if the release would endanger their preservation (14)
*documents pertaining to an investigation or other control measure by an authority if the release would endanger the regulatory control measure or its purpose (15)
*detailed returns of political candidates on their campaign funding (15)
*business and professional secrets of public bodies, if a competing the body would suffer economic harm, or a public or private body pursuing competing or similar activities would gain a competitive advantage by the release or if the possibilities of a body bound by the Publicity Act to make advantageous purchases or other financial arrangements would be harmed (17)
*documents used by a public body in a collective bargaining or labour action if the release would harm the public body as the employer (18)
*documents used for preparation of a legal action, if the release would harm a public body as a party to a suit (19)
*documents containing information on entrance examination or other examination or test, if the release would defeat the purpose of the test or exam or prevent its future use (22)
* documents containing sensitive information on the private life of a suspect, plaintiff, witness or other party to a criminal investigation, or information on the victim that would hurt the victim's memory or her loved ones, unless the release is necessary to conduct the work of an authority (26)

Non-open information remains non-open for 25 years after it was created or obtained by an authority. Documents that are non-open to protect the privacy of an individual remain non-open for 50 years after the protected individual has died.&lt;ref name="julkisuuslaki"/&gt;{{rp|§31.2,31,5}}

If information is still, after 25 years, valid and describes a security measure of a building, facility, system or method or it is still part of a plan used for national defence or civil defence, it remains non-open as long as the information is pertinent for the purpose. The same indefinite non-openness applies to all documents under international security obligations, if the release might still affect Finnish foreign relations negatively. The non-openness of other documents may be prolonged up to 55 years by the [[Council of State (Finland)|Council of State]], if necessary to safeguard a protected interest.&lt;ref name="julkisuuslaki"/&gt;{{rp|§31.3–4}}

===France===
In [[France]], the accountability of public servants is a constitutional right, according to the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]''.

The implementing legislation is the '''Loi n°78-753 du 17 juillet 1978 portant diverses mesures d'amélioration des relations entre l'administration et le public et diverses dispositions d'ordre administratif, social et fiscal''' (''Act No. 78-753 of 17 July 1978. On various measures for improved relations between the Civil Service and the public and on various arrangements of administrative, social and fiscal nature''). It sets as a general rule that citizens can demand a copy of any administrative document (in paper, digitised or other form), and establishes the ''Commission d’Accès aux Documents Administratifs'', an independent administrative authority, to oversee the process.

===Georgia===

{{main|Access to public information in Georgia}}

In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the General Administrative Code contains a '''Law on Freedom of Information'''.

===Germany===
In [[Germany]], the federal government passed a freedom of information law on September 5, 2005; it was last updated on August 7, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_ifg/index.html Federal Act Governing Access to Information held by the Federal Government (Freedom of Information Act)]''. The law of September 5, 2005, with amendments as of August 7, 2013; English translation from the German provided by the Federal Ministry of the Interior. Available on the website of the German Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection, as part of the project "Gesetze im Internet" (laws on the Internet), in cooperation with juris GMBH, a legal information service. Retrieved 2015-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The law grants each person an unconditional right to access official federal information. No legal, commercial, or any other kind of justification is necessary.

Twelve of the sixteen [[States of Germany|Bundesländer]]—[[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Berlin]], [[Brandenburg]], [[Bremen]], [[Hamburg]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Nordrhein-Westfalen]], [[Rheinland-Pfalz]], [[Saarland]], [[Sachsen-Anhalt]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[Thuringia|Thüringen]]—have approved individual "[[w:de:Informationsfreiheitsgesetz|Informationsfreiheitsgesetze]]" (Freedom of Information laws).

===Greece===
{{Main|Access to public information in Greece}}

In [[Greece]], the 1975 Greek Constitution guaranteed the right of access to administrative documents and the right of citizens to obtain information. However it was not until 1986 that the first law was passed to provide for access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dorovinis|first1=Vassilis|last2=Etairia|first2=Elliniki|title=Doors to Democracy|date=June 1998|publisher=The Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe|location=Szentendre, Hungary|isbn=963 8454 58 X|page=89|url=http://archive.rec.org/REC/Publications/PPDoors/WEST/cover.html|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 16 (Right to Access Administrative Documents—Δικαίωμα γνώσης διοικητικών εγγράφων) of Law 1599/1986 (State-citizenry Relationship—Σχέσεις Κράτους-πολίτη) introduced the right of all citizens to read most administrative documents. This right is now codified as article 5 (Access to documents—Πρόσβαση σε έγγραφα) of the Administrative Procedural Code (Κώδικας Διοικητικής Διαδικασίας), Law 2690/1999. Under this article, citizens have a right to know the content of administrative documents. Administrative documents are defined as those produced by public sector entities, such as reports, studies, minutes, statistical data, circulars, instructions, responses, consultatory responses, and decisions. In addition, citizens with a legitimate interest may also access ''private'' documents stored by public services. The right cannot be exercised if the document concerns the private or family lives of others, or if the document's confidentiality is safeguarded by specific legal provisions. Furthermore, the public body can refuse access if the document refers to discussions in the Cabinet, or if accessing the document can seriously hamper criminal or administrative violation investigations carried out by judicial, police, or military authorities.

Citizens may study the documents at the place where they are archived, or they may obtain a copy at their own cost. Access to one's own medical data is provided with the help of a doctor. Access to documents should take into account whether they be covered by copyright, patent, or trade secret regulations.

In addition, Law 3448/2006, on the reuse of public sector information, harmonises the national laws with the requirements on the [[Freedom of information legislation#European Union|European Union Directive 2003/98/EC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eae.org.gr/leg1_2690-art5.html Article 5 of the Administrative Procedures Code — Document Access] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730040742/http://www.eae.org.gr/leg1_2690-art5.html |date=2007-07-30 }} (in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
In [[Hong Kong]] there are no laws specifically enacted to guarantee the freedom of information.

Since March 1995, the [[Government of Hong Kong]] has promulgated a "Code on Access to Information" to serve a similar purpose. This code, like other internal regulations of the Government, was not legislated by the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and has a minimal legal status. It requires government agencies listed in its appendix to appoint Access to Information Officers to answer citizens' requests for governmental records. A fee may be charged prior to the release of information. The code does not require the government to archive information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.access.gov.hk/en/index.htm |title=Code on Access to Information |publisher=Access.gov.hk |date=2014-02-13 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
In [[Hungary]], the '''Act on the Protection of Personal Data and Public Access to Data of Public Interest''' of 1992 extends a right of access to all data of public interest, defined as any information processed by a body performing a governmental function. Complaints and contested applications may be appealed to the Data Protection Commissioner or to the court.

In 2005 the Parliament adopted the '''Act on the Freedom of Information by Electronic Means''' (Act XC of 2005). The Act has three basic parts: 1. electronic disclousure of certain data by public sector bodies, 2. publicity of legislation and 3. openness of Court decisions.

===Iceland===
In [[Iceland]] the Information Act (Upplysingalög) Act no. 50/1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.althingi.is/altext/lagas/141b/2012140.html |title=2012 nr. 140 28. desember/ Upplýsingalög |publisher=Althingi.is |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives access to public information.

===India===
{{main|Right to Information (India)}}

The [[Right to Information Act]] (RTI Act) was passed by [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] on 11 May 2005 and was published in the gazette of India on 15 June 2005. It came into effect on 12 October 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tangedco.gov.in/chapter1.php|title=home page|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816165037/http://www.tangedco.gov.in/chapter1.php|archive-date=2016-08-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_right-to-information-act-to-complete-five-years-on-october-12_1450688 |title=Right to Information Act to complete five years on October 12 &amp;#124; Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=2010-10-10 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing the erstwhile Freedom of information Act, 2002. The Supreme Court of India had, in several Judgments prior to enactment of both Acts, interpreted Indian Constitution to read Right to Information as the Fundamental Right as embodied in Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression and also in Right to Life. RTI Act laid down a procedure to guarantee this right. Under this law all Government Bodies or Government funded agencies have to designate a Public Information Officer (PIO). The PIO's responsibility is to ensure that information requested is disclosed to the petitioner within 30 days or within 48 hours in case of information concerning the life or liberty of a person. The law was inspired by previous legislation from select states (among them [[Tamil Nadu]] (1997), [[Goa]] (1997), [[Rajasthan]] (2000), [[Karnataka]] (2000), [[Delhi]] (2001), [[Maharashtra]] (2002) etc.) that allowed the right to information (to different degrees) to citizens about activities of any State Government body.

A number of high-profile disclosures revealed corruption in various government schemes such scams in [[Public Distribution System]]s (ration stores), disaster relief, construction of highways etc. The law itself has been hailed as a landmark in India's drive towards more openness and accountability.

However the RTI India has certain weaknesses that hamper implementation.

[[RTI NEWS]]

'''On International Right to Information Day 1000 Copies of The RTI Act Sent by Mr. Naveen Agrawal in India'''

Nagpur (Dt.28/10/2018). 28 September is observed as International Right to Information Day across the world. Mr. Naveen Maheshkumar Agrawal, Registrar, Dada Ramchand Bakhru Sindhu Mahavidyalaya, with a view to creating awareness about the Right to Information Act, 2005 in society sent the soft copies of the RTI Act to 1000 people on International Right to Information Day. It was indeed a novel way on his part to spread awareness about the Act. The copies of the Act were sent in English, Hindi and Marathi languages. Introducing transparency in the government work is the main purpose of this Act. But even to the lack of awareness in information seeker and information provider, the effective implementation of the said act is badly affected. In 2017 also Mr. Naveen Agrawal had sent 101 applications under RTI Act 2005 to different public authorities seeking information on different issues on International Day of Right to Information with the purpose of creating awareness about the Act.
&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Alasdair S., A Great and Revolutionary Law? The First Four Years of India's Right to Information Act (January 9, 2010). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1527858 Available at SSRN.]&lt;/ref&gt; There have been questions on the lack of speedy appeal to non-compliance to requests. The lack of a central PIO makes it difficult to pin-point the correct PIO to approach for requests. There is also a criticism of the manner in which the Information Commissioners are appointed to head the information commission. It is alleged by RTI Activists that bureaucrats working in close proximity with the government are appointed in the RTI Commissions in a non-transparent manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090528/punjab.htm#2 TribuneIndia.com], Appointment of bureaucrat as Punjab CIC draws flak&lt;/ref&gt; The PIO, being an officer of the relevant Government institution, may have a vested interest in not disclosing damaging information on activities of his/her Institution, This therefore creates a conflict of interest. In the state of Maharashtra it was estimated that only 30% of the requests are actually realised under the Maharashtra Right to Information act. The law does not allow disclosure of information that affects national security, defence, and other matters that are deemed of national interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.filertionline.in|title=File RTI Online - Suchana ka Adhikar - Filing RTI across India|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtiindia.org RTI India]: The Complete Right to Information Portal of India.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rtiact2005.com/ RTI Act, 2005]: RTI Online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://getup4change.org/rti/ GetUp4Change]: Online Community to file RTI applications anonymously.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinerti.com OnlineRTI]: Portal to submit RTI applications online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtination.com RTINation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529073651/http://www.rtination.com/ |date=2012-05-29 }}: Portal to file RTI applications online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a comparison between Indian and British legislative efforts see [http://202.71.128.135:5/bc/focusdetails.asp?ID=19 British Council India's LEGAL eNEWS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927100419/http://202.71.128.135:5/bc/focusdetails.asp?ID=19 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rti.gov.in/rticorner/studybypwc/index-study.htm |title=Study conducted by Pricewaterhouse Cooper for the Department of Personnel and Training in 2008-2009 on the implementation of the RTI Act |publisher=Rti.gov.in |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
The Law on Dissemination of and Free Access to Information was approved by Iranian Parliament in 2008. Its English and Arabic renditions were officially released as part of the government's efforts to promote Freedom of Information (FOI) in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/iran-releases-english-arabic-versions-of-law-on-free-access-to-information/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] the Freedom of Information Act 1997&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997_13.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208023235/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997_13.html |date=February 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; came into effect in April, 1998.  This provided for members of the public to access information specifically about themselves, amend incorrect information, and request an explanation behind administrative decisions concerning themselves, as well as allowing any person to access records generated by a list of specified public bodies. The Act is seen as having led to a sea-change in the relationship between the citizen, journalists, [[Department of state (Ireland)|government departments]] and [[Irish Government#Public sector|public bodies]]. Disclosure is the default assumption of the Act; bodies can withhold information only by citing exemptions specified in the legislation. Decisions of public bodies in relation to requests for information may be reviewed by the [[Information Commissioner]].

The Act was subsequently amended by the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0009/index.html|title=Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003|publisher=IrishStatuteBook.ie|date=2003-04-11|accessdate=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendments introduced fees for non-personal requests and restricted the kinds of material which could be accessed.

On 14 October 2014, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150929002113/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0030/ Freedom of Information Act 2014] repealed the 1997 and 2003 Acts, removing most of the restrictions introduced in 2003 and widened the range of bodies covered to all public bodies, unless specifically exempt. It also allowed for the Government to prescribe (or designate) other bodies receiving significant public funds, so that the FOI legislation applies to them also.

One particular controversy which has caused concern to journalists and historians is that traditionally government ministers would annotate and sign any major policy or report documents which they had seen. However this practice has fallen out of favour because of the new openness. This annotation and signing of documents has often given a [[paper trail]] and unique insight as to "what the minister knew" about a controversy or how he or she formed an opinion on a matter. Also civil and public servants have become more informal, in keeping written records of potentially controversial meeting and avoiding writing memos as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=9&amp;si=1583676&amp;issue_id=13822 |title=Harney accused over 'new culture of secrecy' in Health - National News, Frontpage - Independent.ie |publisher=Unison.ie |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this information would not often be released, and sometimes only under the [[thirty year rule]], the fact that government ministers now do not annotate and sign documents creates the concerns that while government is open it is not accountable as to who did or saw what or how decision making process works.

===Israel===
In [[Israel]], the Freedom of Information Law, 5758-1998, supported by the Freedom of Information Regulations, 5759-1999, controls freedom of information. It defines the bodies subject to the legislation by a set of listed categories - essentially, most public bodies - and provides for the government to publish a list of all affected bodies. However, this list does not seem to have been made publicly available, if indeed it was ever compiled.{{POV check inline|date=November 2011}} Many public bodies are not obliged to follow the law, which limits the potential for use by the public.

The Israeli Freedom of Information Law has, in some cases, actually achieved the opposite intended result.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} some Government agencies now take the position that a citizen may only request information via FOIL—i.e., an official letter designated as such and including the 95 [[Israeli new shekel|shekel]] fee. Thus an Israeli citizen in many cases cannot simply write a letter asking a question, and can be asked to file a FOIL application with a fee and wait the minimum statutory 30 days for a reply, which the agency can extend to 60 days. In many cases FOIL letters are simply ignored,{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} or some laconic response is sent stating the request is either unclear, unspecific, too vague or some other legalese, anything in order to keep the information away from the public.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} When the 60 days are up, if the anticipated result usually yield nothing significant,{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} the applicant must petition the District Court to compel disclosure, a procedure that requires attorneys to draft pleadings and a payment of (approximately) $420 court fee. A judgement in such FOIL appeals in Israel can take many months, and again the agency can easily{{POV statement|date=September 2011}} avoid disclosure by simply not complying, although risking being charged with contempt of court. While there are some successes in courts compelling Israeli government agencies to disclose information, they are usually in non-controversial areas. The law provides for the expected{{POV check inline|date=November 2011}} "security" exemption and an applicant applying for such information can expect not to benefit from FOIL (and also have his or her court appeal rejected). it will be noted that Applicants can sometimes be helped by [[The Movement for Freedom of Information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meida.org.il |title=Meida.org.il |publisher=Meida.org.il |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
Chapter V of Law No. 241 of 7 August 1990 provides for access to administrative documents. However, the right to access is limited. The law states that those requesting information must have a legal interest. The 1992 regulations require "a personal concrete interest to safeguard in legally relevant situations." The courts have ruled that this includes the right of environmental groups and local councilors to demand information on behalf of those they represent. It was amended in 2005. The revision appears to adopt the court rulings and relax the interest somewhat to allow access when an individual can show they represent a more general public interest.

===Jamaica===
In Jamaica, the relevant legislation is the '''Access to Information Act, 2002'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Access to Information Unit Jamaica Archives &amp; Records Department|title=The Access to Information Act 2002|url=http://www.ati.gov.jm/sites/default/files/Documents/atiact_0.pdf|website=ati.gov.jm/content/access-information-act|publisher=Government of Jamaica|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], the "Law Concerning Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs" (行政機関の保有する情報の公開に関する法律) was promulgated in 1999. The law was enforced in 2001.

In many local governments, it establishes the regulations about information disclosure (情報公開条例) from the latter half of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications (総務省) [http://www.soumu.go.jp/gyoukan/kanri/translation3.htm Law Concerning Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130219011722/http://www.soumu.go.jp/gyoukan/kanri/translation3.htm |date=2013-02-19 }}, [https://web.archive.org/web/20010423185834/http://www.soumu.go.jp/gyoukan/kanri/mainpoint1.htm Main Points of the Law Concerning Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;/IRON&gt;--&gt;

===Latvia===
The Constitution of Latvia states: "Article 100. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which includes the right to freely receive, keep and distribute information and to express his or her views. Censorship is prohibited." The right to access state held information has been repeatedly recognised by the Constitutional Court of Latvia, most notably in its judgment "On Conformity of the Cabinet of Ministers 21 January 1997 Regulations No.46 "On Government Agreements" with the 20 November 1998 "Information Accessibility Law"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/?lang=2&amp;mid=19 |title=Constitutional Court of the Republic of Latvia |publisher=Satv.tiesa.gov.lv |date= |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judgment 04-02(99)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law on Freedom of Information was signed into law by the State President in November 1998 and has been amended a number of times recently. Any person can ask for information in "any technically feasible form" without having to show a reason. The request can be oral or written. Bodies must respond in 15 days.

===Malta===
On the 1st of September 2012, Legal Notice 156 of 2012 brought the Freedom of Information Act (Chapter 496 of the Laws of Malta) fully into force, allowing the public (resident citizens of Malta, the EU and the EEA) to submit requests for documents/information held by the Government. FOI requests are submitted free of charge but processing of documents by public authorities may require the public to pay fees which never exceed Eur 40. When access to documents is refused, the FOIA in Malta provides for a complaint and appeal mechanism that can be ultimately resolved through the Courts of Appeal.

===Liberia===
President [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] signed the Freedom of Information Act of 2010 into law in October 2010. [[Liberia]] became only the fourth country in [[Africa]], and the first in [[West Africa]], to pass such legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liberianobserver.com/node/8622|title=Ellen Signs "Freedom of Information Act" into Law|newspaper=Daily Observer|date=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law allows both the media and individual citizens to demand information from any public authority or any private authority that carries out government functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201010111890.html|title=Liberian President Signs Freedom of Information Act Into Law|newspaper=allAfrica.com|date=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=February 2017}}

{{Main|Access to public information in the Republic of Macedonia}}

Article 16 of the Constitution of Macedonia guarantees "access to information and the freedom of reception and transmission of information".

The Law on Free Access to Information of Public Character was adopted on 25 January 2006. It is scheduled to go into force in September 2006.The law allows any natural or legal person to obtain information from state and municipal bodies and natural and legal persons who are performing public functions. The requests can be oral, written or electronic. Requests must be responded to in 10 days.

===Malaysia===
The state of [[Selangor]] passed the Freedom of Information Enactment (Selangor) 2010 on 1 April 2011, allowing the Malaysian public an access to the state documents including that of local councils, city halls and state government-linked companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/selangor-passes-freedom-of-information-enactment/|title=Selangor passes Freedom of Information Enactment|accessdate=1 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404002324/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/selangor-passes-freedom-of-information-enactment/|archivedate=4 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the state of [[Penang]] passed the Freedom of Information bill on 4 November 2011, allowing the public to access to state documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/11/4/nation/20111104200415&amp;sec=nation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106202826/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2011%2F11%2F4%2Fnation%2F20111104200415&amp;sec=nation|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 November 2011|title=Penang passes Freedom of Information Bill|accessdate=5 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both states are under the ruling of the federal opposition [[Pakatan Rakyat]].

===Mexico===
The Constitution was amended in 1977 to include a right of freedom of information. Article 6 says in part, "the right of information shall be guaranteed by the state." The Supreme Court made a number of decisions further enhancing that right.

The Federal Law of Transparency and Access to Public Government Information was unanimously approved by Congress in April 2002 and signed by President Fox in June 2002. It went into effect in June 2003.

===Montenegro===
{{main|Access to public information in Montenegro}}
A freedom of information law was passed in Montenegro late in 2005, after a process of several years.

===Netherlands===
Article 110 of the Constitution states: "In the exercise of their duties government bodies shall observe the principle of transparency in accordance with the rules to be prescribed by Act of Parliament."

The Dutch act on public access to government information entered into force in 1980 and is updated several times later. Under the act known as the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Wet Openbaarheid van Bestuur|nl|3=Openbaarheid van bestuur#Nederland}}'', or ''Wob'' for short, any person can demand information (called ''wobbing'') related to an administrative matter if it is contained in documents held by public authorities or companies carrying out work for a public authority. The request can either be written or oral. The authority has two (on environmental issues) or four weeks to respond. The act also obliges the government to provide information ''unsolicited'' as it is in the interest of good and democratic governance.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the relevant legislation is the [[Official Information Act 1982]]. This implemented a general policy of openness regarding official documents and replaced the Official Secrets Act.

===Nigeria===
Former President [[Goodluck Jonathan]] signed into law the Freedom of Information (FoI) Bill, awaited for 12 years by media proprietors and practitioners alike, during which the Villa got knocks for filibustering and lawmakers complained of bombardment by campaigners.

The House of Representatives passed the Bill on February 24, 2011 and the Senate dialled up integrity on March 16 as it delivered on promise to pass it.

The harmonised version was passed by both Chambers on May 26, 2011.It was conveyed to Jonathan on May 27, and he signed it on '''May 28, 2011''', according to a statement Aso Rock issued on Tuesday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://independentngonline.com/DailyIndependent/Article.aspx?id=34777|title=Jonathan signs FoI Bill|newspaper=Daily Independence|date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two states in Nigeria (namely Ekiti and Lagos State) have adopted the Freedom of Information Act at State level but they have extended the response date at State level from 7 days to 14 days. More states are expected to adopt the bill and come up with their own version.

===Pakistan===
{{main|Freedom of Information Act in Pakistan}}
President [[Pervez Musharraf]] promulgated the Freedom of Information Ordinance 2002 in October 2002.&lt;ref name=foi2002&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom of Information Ordinance promulgated|url=http://www.transparency.org.pk/documents/FIO.pdf|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=12 April 2013|date=27 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law allows any citizen access to public records held by a public body of the federal government including ministries, departments, boards, councils, courts and tribunals. It does not apply to government owned corporations or provincial governments. The bodies must respond within 21 days.

More recently, by virtue of the 18th Amendment of 2010, article 19A has been inserted in the [[Constitution of Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=constit20&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of Pakistan|url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part2.ch1.html|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives the right to access to information the status of a fundamental constitutional right. Article 19A "Right to Information" reads: "Every citizen shall have the right to have access to information in all matters of public importance subject to regulation and reasonable restrictions imposed by law".

===Paraguay===
The National Constitution of [[Paraguay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Paraguay_2011.pdf|title = Constitution of Paraguay|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; enacted in 1992, guarantees the right to be informed and to receive true, responsible, and equitable information (Art. 28). The same article states that public sources of information are free, and that a law will regulate the modalities, time periods, and sanctions “in order to make this right effective”.  In practice, this last provision delayed the recognition of the right due to the absence of a law making it “effective”. Congress, government agencies and Courts were reluctant to enforce the right to access public sources of information until 2013. A Supreme Court judgment (No. 1306 of 15 October 2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.pj.gov.py/descargas/AYS-1306.pdf|title = Acción de Inconstitucionalidad en el juicio "Defensoria del Pueblo c/ Municipalidad de San Lorenzo".|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; marked the beginning of what has been called a “Transparency Spring&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.ultimahora.com/la-primavera-la-transparencia-n934443.html|title = La Primavera Transparente|last = |first = |date = |work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;”.

The ruling from the Supreme Court was made in the context of an [[Recurso de amparo|Amparo]] filed by a citizen called Jose Daniel Vargas Tellez, after the San Lorenzo Municipality denied him access to the information about the names, the job descriptions and the wages of all the employees that were working in that public office.  The Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeals rejected the Amparo on the grounds that information of that type was considered sensitive by the Data Protection and Privacy Act (Law 1682/02 and 1969/02). The latter rulings were challenged on constitutional grounds and the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Vargas Tellez holding that while this information relating to the identity and wages of public employees and officers constitutes personal propriety data, it is nonetheless registered in a “public source of information”, which makes it available to any citizen who requests it. The right to access to these informations is recognised under the Constitution and international instruments such as the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] (Art. 13); The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (Art. 19); and the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]] (Art. 13).

Following the Supreme Court's decision, and with the support of the civil society and President [[Horacio Cartes]], the first Transparency law was enacted (Law No. 5189/14) requiring all public offices to disclose information regarding the use of public funds to pay salaries. In addition, The Freedom of Information and Government Transparency Law (Law 5282/2014) was enacted in 2014 and a final regulation of 2015 (Executive Decree 4064/15) set the final step in the road to Transparency. These rules expressly recognize that the right to access public information is a human right, which improves the State, promotes citizen participation and public accountability, and serves as a tool to combat corruption. Currently, all requests to access public information can be done [http://informacionpublica.paraguay.gov.py/portal/#!/buscar_informacion#busqueda online] through a single portal, and government offices are obliged to respond within 15 days.

Paraguay became internationally committed to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance after becoming a member of the [[Open Government Partnership]]. Presently, most government offices have [http://www.pj.gov.py/contenido/1298-acceso-a-la-informacion-publica-y-transparencia-gubernamental/1298 Transparency offices] and can provide information to citizens and receive reports of corruption. The main Executive agency in charge of promoting Electronic Government is the [http://www.senatics.gov.py SENATICS.]

'''Rectification, Clarification and Destruction of False or Distorted information:'''

Art 28 of the Constitution also states that any person affected by the diffusion of a false, distorted, or ambiguous information has the right to demand its rectification or its clarification by the same means and under the same conditions in which it was divulged, without prejudice to the other compensatory rights. There is also a specific law that regulates [[Habeas data|Habeas Data]], and any citizen can request a copy of publicly or privately held information relating to him, and can demand that any inaccurate data found be destroyed.

Article 61 of the Constitution provides for the right to information and mandates that Parliament enact a law setting out this right.

The Law on Access to Public Information was approved in September 2001 and went into effect in January 2002. The Act allows anyone to demand access to public information, public data and public assets held by public bodies, private bodies that exercise public tasks, trade unions and political parties. The requests can be oral or written. The bodies must respond within 14 days.

In Serbia, the '''Access to Public Information Act''' gives access to documents of public authorities.

===Slovakia===
Slovakia passed the Freedom of Information Act in May 2000 (Num. law: 211/2000 Z. z.). Under the law, everybody can demand information from state institutions, organisations, from municipalities, individuals and legal entities financed by the public budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.sk/UserControls/l2/211_2000.htm Zakon o slobodnom pristupe k informaciam] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619162008/http://www.justice.gov.sk/UserControls/l2/211_2000.htm |date=June 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slovenia===
{{Main|Access to public information in Slovenia}}
Slovenia passed the Access to Public Information Act in March 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dostopdoinformacij.si/index.php?id=253#236|title=Dostop do Informacij|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2016}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act governs the procedure which ensures everyone free access to public information held by state bodies, local government bodies, public agencies, public funds and other entities of public law, public powers holders and public service contractors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20050308120743/http://www.accesstoinformation.si/ AccessToInformation.si], Commissioner's site&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
{{main|Promotion of Access to Information Act, 2000}}
Section 32 of the [[Constitution of South Africa]] guarantees "the right of access to any information held by the state; and any information that is held by another person and that is required for the exercise or protection of any rights." This right is implemented through the Promotion of Access to Information Act, which was enacted on 2 February 2000. The right of access to ''privately'' held information is an interesting feature, as most freedom of information laws only cover governmental bodies.

===South Korea===
The Constitutional Court ruled in 1989 that there is a constitutional right to information "as an aspect of the right of freedom of expression and specific implementing legislation to define the contours of the right was not a prerequisite to its enforcement."

The Act on Disclosure of Information by Public Agencies was enacted in 1996 and went into effect in January 1998. It allows citizens to demand information held by public agencies.

===Sri Lanka===
Sri Lanka's [http://www.parliament.lk/uploads/acts/gbills/english/6007.pdf Right to Information Act No 12 of 2016 ] was certified on 4 August 2016. After much debate and many amendments to the draft Bill, the final Act comprising 44 Sections was certified in early August 2016. The implementation of the Act is expected to take time due to the necessity of establishing cadre positions in government institutions to provide information to the general public. The Act is considered to hold many strengths and positive features that would effectively authorize citizens to be actively involved in the process of governance. Moreover, Article 14A(1) introduced by virtue of  [http://slembassyusa.org/downloads/19th_Amendment_E.pdf 19th Amendment to the 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka] has paved the way for the recognition of right to information as a fundamental right.

===Sweden===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Zenon Panoussis]] --&gt;
In [[Sweden]], the [[Freedom of the Press Act]] grants public access to official documents and is included in the [[Constitution of Sweden#Principle of Public Access|Constitution of Sweden]]. Dating back to 1766, it is the first freedom of information legislation in the modern sense. In modern times the right has become known as the Principle of Public Access ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''offentlighetsprincipen'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.government.se/how-sweden-is-governed/the-principle-of-public-access-to-official-documents/|title=The Principle of Public Access to Official Documents|publisher=Sweden.gov.se |date= |accessdate=2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Principle of Public Access means that the general public is guaranteed insight into activities pursued by government agencies. All official documents handled by government agencies are public unless they contain information specified as secret under the [[Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act]]. Each request to take part of official documents is handled individually and classifying documents or information as secret is subject to appeal. The constitution also grants the right for government employees to pass on information without risk of criminal charges or repercussions and the right to attend court proceedings and meetings of legislative assemblies like the [[Riksdag]].

===Switzerland===
Switzerland is a federal state. Access to federal documents is governed by the Swiss Federal Act on the Principle of Freedom of Information in Public Administration, and supervised by the [[Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/20022540/index.html Federal Act on Freedom of Information in the Administration of 17 December 2004 (status as of 19 August 2014)], [[Federal Chancellery of Switzerland]] (page visited on 19 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Access to documents at the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantonal level]] is governed by cantonal laws, which are mostly similar to the federal law.
As of 2018, the cantons of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]], [[Glarus]], [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]], [[Nidwalden]], [[Obwalden]] and [[Thurgau]] do not have freedom of information legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Öffentlichkeitsgesetz.ch: Die Kantone |url=https://www.oeffentlichkeitsgesetz.ch/deutsch/die-kantone/ |website=oeffentlichkeitsgesetz.ch |accessdate=21 October 2018 |language=de-CH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Freedom of information in the United Kingdom}}

The [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] (2000 c. 36) is the implementation of freedom of information legislation in the [[United Kingdom]] on a national level, with the exception of Scottish bodies, which are covered by the [[Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002]] (2002 asp. 13). Environmental information is covered by further legislation [[Environmental Information Regulations 2004]]. [[Tony Blair]], the UK Prime Minister who introduced the Freedom of Information Act, later expressed regret over the Act, claiming that the Act impeded the ability of officials to deliberate "with a reasonable level of confidentiality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/opensecrets/2010/09/why_tony_blair_thinks_he_was_a.html|title=Why Tony Blair thinks he was an idiot|last=Rosenbaum|first=Martin|date=1 September 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Freedom of information in the United States}}

In the United States the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] was signed into law by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on July 4, 1966 and went into effect the following year. [[Ralph Nader]] has been credited with the impetus for creating this act, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Henriette Mantel, Steve Skrovan (directors)|year=2006|title=An Unreasonable Man|medium=motion picture |url=http://anunreasonableman.com/|publisher=Genius Entertainment|isbn=9781594445965|oclc=138363823}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments were signed by President [[Bill Clinton]] on October 2, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oct. 2, 1996: FOIA Law Ushers in Digital Democracy|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/10/1002electronic-foia/|website=wired.com|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act applies only to [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agencies]]. However, all of the states, as well as the District of Columbia and some territories, have enacted similar statutes to require disclosures by agencies of the state and of local governments, though some are significantly broader than others. Some state and local government agencies attempt to get around state open records laws by claiming copyright for their works and then demanding high fees to license the public information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petersen|first=Barbara A.|title=Copyright and State Government: An Analysis of Section 119.083, Florida's Software Copyright Provision|journal=Florida State University Law Review|volume=20|issue=2|pages=441–486|year=1992|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/flsulr20&amp;div=22&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|441–42}} Some states expand government transparency through [[Freedom of information in the United States|open meeting laws]], which require government meetings to be announced in advance and held publicly.

===Uruguay===
The Act was enacted in 2008 under President Vazquez's Administration and is mainly implemented by the Judiciary.

===Zimbabwe===
In [[Zimbabwe]], the [[Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Zimbabwe)|Access to Information and Privacy Act (AIPPA)]] was signed by their President [[Robert Mugabe]] in February 2002.

==Methodology==
The ratings process involves several dozen analysts (Freedom House staff and consultants) who develop draft ratings using information gathered from professional contacts in a variety of countries, staff and consultant travel, international visitors, the findings of human rights and press freedom organizations, specialists in geographic and geopolitical areas, the reports of governments and multilateral bodies, members of the [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]] (IFEX) network, and a variety of domestic and international news media. Countries are given a total score from 0 (most free) to 100 (least free) on the basis of a set of 23 methodology questions and 109 indicators divided into three broad categories covering the legal, political, and economic environment. Based on the scores, the countries are then classified as "Free" (0 to 30), "Partly Free" (31 to 60), or "Not Free" (61 to 100). The draft ratings are reviewed on an individual and a comparative basis, compared with the previous year's findings, any major proposed numerical shifts or category changes are subject to more intense scrutiny, and assessments are made to ensure comparability and consistency in the findings from country to country, region to region, and year to year. While there is an element of subjectivity inherent in the rating process, it emphasizes intellectual rigor, recognizes cultural differences, diverse national interests, and varying levels of economic development, and attempts to produce balanced and unbiased ratings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FOTP%20Methodology%202012.pdf "Methodology"], ''Freedom of the Press 2012'', Freedom House, 21 June 2012, retrieved 2 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Mesopotamian myth (7)}}
The concept of a '''Garden of the gods''' or a '''divine paradise''' might be of [[Sumer]]ian origin, or so it is argued by [[Samuel Noah Kramer]].&lt;ref name="Kramer1964"&gt;{{cite book| first=Samuel Noah| last=Kramer| title=The Sumerians: Their History, Culture and Character| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iY9xp4pLp88C&amp;pg=PA293| accessdate=14 June 2011| year=1964| publisher=University of Chicago Press| isbn=978-0-226-45238-8| page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of this home of the immortals was later handed down to the [[Babylonia]]ns who conquered Sumer.&lt;ref name="Kramer1964"/&gt;

==Location==

=== ''Persian Gulf'' ===
A Sumerian paradise is usually associated with the [[Dilmun civilization]] of [[Eastern Arabia]]. [[Sir Henry Rawlinson]] first suggested the geographical location of Dilmun was in Bahrain in 1880.&lt;ref name="Şengör2003"&gt;{{cite book| first=A. M.| last=Celâl Şengör| title=The Large-wavelength Deformations of the Lithosphere: Materials for a History of the Evolution of Thought from the Earliest Times to Plate Tectonics| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-He_prc5ybUC&amp;pg=PA32| accessdate=16 June 2011| year=2003| publisher=[[Geological Society of America]]| isbn=978-0-8137-1196-6| page=32| location=[[Boulder, Colorado]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This  theory was later  promoted by Frederich Delitzsch in his book ''Wo lag das Paradies'' in 1881, suggesting that it was at the head of the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref name="Delitzsch1881"&gt;{{cite book| first=Friedrich| last=Delitzsch| title=Wo lag das Paradies?: eine biblisch-assyriologische Studie: mit zahlreichen assyriologischen Beiträgen zur biblischen Länder- und Völkerkunde und einer Karte Babyloniens|trans-title=Where was Paradise?: A Scriptural-Assyrian Study of the Several Assyrian Contributions to Biblical Countries and Ethnography with a Map of Babylon| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FhkYAAAAYAAJ| accessdate=16 June 2011| year=1881| publisher=J.C. Hinrichs'sche Buchhandlung}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various other theories have been put forward on this theme. Dilmun is first mentioned in association with [[Kur]] (mountain) and this is particularly problematic as Bahrain is very flat, having a highest prominence of only {{convert|134|m|ft}} elevation.&lt;ref name="Şengör2003"/&gt; Also, in the early epic ''[[Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta]]'', the construction of the [[ziggurat]]s in [[Uruk]] and [[Eridu]] are described as taking place in a world "before Dilmun had yet been settled". In 1987, Theresa Howard-Carter realized that the locations in this area possess no archaeological evidence of a settlement dating 3300-2300 BC. She proposed that Dilmun could have existed in different eras and the one of this era might be a still unidentified tell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Theresa |last=Howard-Carter |title=Dilmun: At Sea or Not at Sea?

=== ''Lebanon and Mount Hermon'' ===
[[File:Mt. Hermon from Manara(GllSprng 319PAN).jpg|thumb|Mount Hermon]]
In tablet nine of the standard version of the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], [[Gilgamesh]] travels to the garden of the gods through the [[Cedar Forest]] and the depths of [[Mashu]], a comparable location in Sumerian version is the "Mountain of cedar-felling".&lt;ref&gt;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.8.1.5# Gilgameš and Ḫuwawa (Version A) - Translation, Lines 9A &amp; 12, kur-jicerin-kud]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KlugerKluger1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maier1997"&gt;{{cite book| first=John R.| last=Maier| title=Gilgamesh: a reader| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Ok5WbdWi3QC&amp;pg=PA144| accessdate=22 June 2011| year=1997| publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers| isbn=978-0-86516-339-3| page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little description remains of the "jewelled garden" of Gilgamesh because twenty four lines of the myth were damaged and could not be translated at that point in the text.&lt;ref name="Fernández-Armesto2004"&gt;{{cite book| first=Felipe| last=Fernández-Armesto| title=World of Myths| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEXXAAAAMAAJ| accessdate=24 June 2011| date=1 June 2004| publisher=University of Texas Press| isbn=978-0-292-70607-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cedars01(js).jpg|thumb|Cedars of Lebanon, sometimes connected with the Sumerian "garden of the gods".&lt;ref name="KlugerKluger1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lipinski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith2009"/&gt;]]
{{quote|text=The name of the mountain is Mashu. As he arrives at the mountain of Mashu, Which every day keeps watch over the rising and setting of the sun, Whose peakes reach as high as the "banks of heaven," and whose breast reaches down to the netherworld, The [[Scorpion man|scorpion-people]] keep watch at its gate.&lt;ref name="KlugerKluger1991"&gt;{{cite book| first1=Rivkah Schärf| last1=Kluger| first2=H.

Bohl has highlighted that the word ''Mashu'' in Sumerian means "twins". Jensen and Zimmern thought it to be the geographical location between [[Mount Lebanon]] and [[Mount Hermon]] in the [[Anti-Lebanon]] range.&lt;ref name="KlugerKluger1991"/&gt; [[Edward Lipinski (orientalist)|Edward Lipinski]] and [[Peter Kyle McCarter]] have suggested that the garden of the gods relates to a mountain sanctuary in the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges.&lt;ref name="Lipinski"&gt;Lipinski, Edward.

The location of garden of the gods is close to the forest, which is described in the line:

=== ''Eridu'' ===
[[File:Eridu mound4c.8.png|thumb|Tell mound at Eridu with temple dedicated to the gods]]
[[Theophilus Pinches]] suggested in 1908 that [[Eridu]] was the  Sumerian paradise calling it "not the earthly city of that name, but a city conceived as lying also "within the Abyss", containing a tree of life fed by the [[Euphrates]] river.&lt;ref name="Pinches2005"&gt;{{cite book| first=Theophilus| last=Pinches| title=The Old Testament in the Light of the Historical Records and Legends of Assyria and Babylonia| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mBHqzLyjdxgC| accessdate=16 June 2011| date=January 2005| publisher=Kessinger Publishing| isbn=978-1-4179-7413-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinches noted "it was represented as a place to which access was forbidden, for 'no man entered its midst', as in the case of the garden of Eden after the fall." In a myth called the ''Incantation of Eridu'', it is described as having a "glorious fountain of the abyss", a "house of wisdom", sacred grove and a ''kiskanu''-tree with the appearance of lapis-lazuli.&lt;ref name="Fischer2008"&gt;{{cite book| first=Richard James| last=Fischer| title=Historical Genesis: from Adam to Abraham| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4qX0bQs0eEYC&amp;pg=PA42|accessdate=16 June 2011|date=30 December 2008|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-3806-7|pages=42–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuʼād Safar also found the remains of a canal running through Eridu in [[archaeological]] excavations of 1948 to 1949.&lt;ref name="SafarMuṣṭafá1981"&gt;{{cite book| first=Fuʼād| last=Safar| title=Eridu, Sumer 6, 28, 1950| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jLttAAAAMAAJ| accessdate=19 June 2011| year=1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Foxwell Albright]] noted that "Eridu is employed as a name of the [[Abzu]], just as Kutu ([[Kutha]]), the city of [[Nergal]], is a common name of Aralu" highlighting the problems in translation where several places were called the same name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/528616 Albright, W. F., The Mouth of the Rivers, The American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures, Vol. 35, No. 4 (Jul., 1919), pp. 161-195]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Jeremias]] suggested that Aralu was the same as [[Ariel (city)|Ariel]] in the [[West Bank]] and signified both the mountain of the gods and a place of desolation.&lt;ref name="Jeremias1887"&gt;{{cite book| first=Alfred| last=Jeremias| title=Die babylonisch-assyriscen Vorstellungen vom Leben nach dem Tode: nach den Quellen mit Berücksichtigung der altestamentlichen Parallelen dargestellt| pages=121–123| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6nqAHAAACAAJ| accessdate=18 June 2011| year=1887| publisher=Hinrichs'sche Buchandlung|trans-title=The Babylonian-Assyrian Ideas About Life After Death: Presented According to the Sources with Consideration to Old Testament Parallels}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the word [[Ekur]], this has suggested that ideas associated with the netherworld came from a mountainous country outside of Babylonia.&lt;ref name="Hastings2001"&gt;{{cite book| author=James Hastings| title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics: Algonquins-Art| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NyzDrkPG2nIC&amp;pg=PA437| accessdate=17 June 2011| date=15 October 2001| publisher=Elibron.com| isbn=978-1-4021-9433-7| page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Nippur'' ===

The myth of [[Enlil and Ninlil]] opens with a description of the city of [[Nippur]], its [[wall]]s, [[river]], [[canal]]s and [[water well|well]], portrayed as the home of the gods and, according to Kramer "that seems to be conceived as having existed before the creation of man." [[Andrew R. George]] suggests "Nippur was a city inhabited by gods not men, and this would suggest that it had existed from the very beginning." He discusses Nippur as the "first city" ([[URU (cuneiform)|uru]]-sag, ''"City-top (head)") of Sumer.&lt;ref name="George1992"&gt;{{cite book| first=A. R.| last=George| title=Babylonian Topographical Texts| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zw0TQ1MrhOkC&amp;pg=PA442| accessdate=29 May 2011| year=1992| publisher=Peeters Publishers| isbn=978-90-6831-410-6| pages=442–445}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conception of Nippur is echoed by [[Joan Goodnick Westenholz]], describing the setting as "civitas dei", existing before the "[[axis mundi]]".&lt;ref name="BorrásBarcelona2000"&gt;{{cite book| first1=Miguel Ángel| last1=Borrás| author2=Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona| title=Joan Goodnick Westenholz, The Foundation Myths of Mesopotamian Cities, Divine Planners and Human Builder in La fundación de la ciudad: mitos y ritos en el mundo antiguo| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3yPVFGPr0aoC&amp;pg=PA48| accessdate=29 May 2011| year=2000| publisher=Edicions UPC| isbn=978-84-8301-387-8| page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=There was a city, there was a city -- the one we live in. Nibru (Nippur) was the [[city]], the one we live in. Dur-jicnimbar was the city, the one we live in. [[Id-sala]] is its holy [[river]], Kar-jectina is its [[quay]]. Kar-asar is its quay where [[boat]]s make fast. Pu-lal is its freshwater well. [[Id-nunbir-tum]] is its branching [[canal]], and if one measures from there, its cultivated land is 50 [[Ancient Mesopotamian units of measurement|sar]] each way. Enlil was one of its young men, and Ninlil was one its young women.&lt;ref name="ETCSL"&gt;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.2.1&amp;charenc=j# Enlil and Ninlil., Black, J.A., Cunningham, G., Robson, E., and Zólyomi, G., The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature, Oxford 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

George also noted that a [[ritual]] garden was re-created in the "Grand Garden of [[Nippur]], most probably a sacred garden in the [[E-kur]] (or Dur-an-[[ki (cuneiform)|ki]]) temple complex, is described in a cult-song of Enlil as a "garden of heavenly joy".&lt;ref name="George1992"/&gt; Temples in [[Mesopotamia]] were also known to have adorned their [[ziggurat]]s with a sanctuary and [[sacred grove]] of trees, reminiscent of the [[Hanging gardens of Babylon]].&lt;ref name="DelumeauO'Connell2000"/&gt;

==Mythology==

=== ''Kesh temple hymn'' ===

In the ''[[Kesh temple hymn]]'', the first recorded description (c. 2600 BC) of a domain of the gods is described as being the color of a garden: "The four corners of heaven became green for Enlil like a garden."&lt;ref name="ETCSL"/&gt; In an earlier translation of this myth by [[George Aaron Barton]] in ''[[Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions]]'' he considered it to read "In [[hursag]] the garden of the gods was green."&lt;ref name="Barton1918"&gt;{{cite book| first=George Aaron| last=Barton| title=Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions| page=52| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nn5hAAAAMAAJ| accessdate=23 May 2011| year=1918| publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Debate between sheep and grain'' ===

Another Sumerian [[creation myth]], the ''[[Debate between sheep and grain]]'' opens with a location "the hill of heaven and earth", and describes various agricultural developments in a pastoral setting. This is discussed by [[Edward Chiera]] as "not a poetical name for the earth, but the dwelling place of the gods, situated at the point where the heavens rest upon the earth. It is there that mankind had their first habitat, and there the Babylonian [[Garden of Eden]] is to be placed."&lt;ref name="Chieraottoman1924"&gt;{{cite book| first1=Edward| last1=Chiera| author2=Constantinople Musée Impérial Ottoman| title=Sumerian Religious Texts| page=26| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BF3QgAACAAJ| accessdate=23 May 2011| year=1924| publisher=University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sumerian word [[Edin (Sumerian term)|Edin]], means "steppe" or "plain",&lt;ref name="ThomasmaWeisstub2004"&gt;{{cite book| first1=David C.| last1=Thomasma| first2=David N.| last2=Weisstub| title=The Variables of Moral Capacity| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1j0AfVUQfKEC&amp;pg=PA110| accessdate=16 June 2011| year=2004| publisher=Springer| isbn=978-1-4020-2551-8| page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; so modern scholarship has abandoned the use of the phrase "Babylonian Garden of Eden" as it has become clear the "Garden of Eden" was a later concept.

=== Epic of Gilgamesh ===

The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' describes [[Gilgamesh]] travelling to a wondrous garden of the gods that is the source of a river, next to a mountain covered in cedars, and references a "[[Tree of life|plant of life]]". In the myth, paradise is identified as the place where the deified Sumerian hero of the flood, [[Utnapishtim]] ([[Ziusudra]]), was taken by the gods to live forever. Once in the garden of the gods, Gilgamesh finds all sorts of precious stones, similar to {{Bibleverse||Genesis|2:12|HE}}:

{{quote|text=There was a garden of the gods: all round him stood bushes bearing gems ... fruit of [[carnelian]] with the [[vine]] hanging from it, beautiful to look at; [[lapis lazuli]] leaves hung thick with fruit, sweet to see ... rare stones, [[agate]] and [[pearl]]s from out the sea.&lt;ref name="Sharpes2005"&gt;{{cite book| first=Donald K.| last=Sharpes| title=Lords of the Scrolls: Literary Traditions in the Bible and Gospels| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39fw6f689GgC&amp;pg=PA90| accessdate=16 June 2011| date=15 August 2005| publisher=Peter Lang| isbn=978-0-8204-7849-4| page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Enki and Ninhursag ===

The myth of ''[[Enki and Ninhursag]]'' also describes the Sumerian paradise as a garden, which [[Enki]] obtains water from [[Utu]] to [[irrigate]].&lt;ref name="DelumeauO'Connell2000"&gt;{{cite book| first1=Jean| last1=Delumeau| first2=Matthew| last2=O'Connell| title=History of Paradise: the Garden of Eden in Myth and Tradition| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubJDLvEV0vEC&amp;pg=PA5| accessdate=15 June 2011| date=20 April 2000| publisher=University of Illinois Press| isbn=978-0-252-06880-5| page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Song of the hoe ===

The ''[[song of the hoe]]'' features [[Enlil]] creating mankind with a hoe and the [[Anunnaki]] spreading outward from the original garden of the gods. It also mentions the Abzu being built in Eridu.&lt;ref name="ETCSL"/&gt;

=== Hymn to Enlil ===

A ''[[Hymn to Enlil]]'' praises the leader of the [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian pantheon]] in the following terms:

{{quote|text=You founded it in the [[Dur-an-ki]], in the middle of the four quarters of the earth. Its soil is the life of the Land, and the life of all the foreign countries. Its brickwork is red gold, its foundation is [[lapis lazuli]]. You made it glisten on high.&lt;ref name="Hess1999"&gt;{{cite book| first=Richard S.| last=Hess| title=Zion, city of our God| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lk_xLfQ_SRAC&amp;pg=PA100| accessdate=14 June 2011| date=June 1999| publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing| isbn=978-0-8028-4426-2| page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Later usage==

The word for [[Paradise garden]] in much later [[Persian language|Persian]] literature is ''apiri-Daeza'', meaning "garden" or "walled enclosure" or "[[orchard]]".&lt;ref name="GarryEl-Shamy2005"&gt;{{cite book| first1=Jane| last1=Garry| first2=Hasan M.| last2=El-Shamy| title=Archetypes and motifs in folklore and literature: a handbook| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cn6pWMverBIC&amp;pg=PA198| accessdate=14 June 2011| year=2005| publisher=M.E. Sharpe| isbn=978-0-7656-1260-1| page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for paradise or garden in the [[Qur'an]] is [[Jannah]] which literally means "concealed place".

In myths of the [[Greater Iran]]ian culture and tradition, [[Jamshid]] is described as saving the world by building a magical garden on top of a mountain. This garden also features a tree of life and is the source of a river that brings fertility to the land. Jamshid is warned by [[Ahura Mazda]] about a freezing winter approaching and so creates this enclosure to protect the seeds of life when a climatic catastrophe strikes.&lt;ref name="Schomp2009"&gt;{{cite book| first=Virginia| last=Schomp| title=The Ancient Persians| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U21j7vDhCCIC&amp;pg=PA51| accessdate=15 June 2011| date=September 2009| publisher=Marshall Cavendish |isbn=978-0-7614-4218-9| page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hate crime''' (also known as a '''bias-motivated crime''' or '''bias crime'''&lt;ref&gt;{cite web| url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/hate-crime|website=Dictionary.com|quote="Also called '''bias crime'''."}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[prejudice]]-motivated crime which occurs when a perpetrator targets a victim because of his or her membership (or perceived membership) in a certain [[social group]] or [[race (human categorization)|race]].  

Examples of such groups can include and are almost exclusively limited to: [[sex]], [[ethnicity]], [[disability]], [[language]], [[nationality]], [[Physical appearance#Physiological differences|physical appearance]], [[religion]], [[gender identity]] or [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stotzer|first=R.|url=http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Stotzer-Comparison-Hate-Crime-June-2007.pdf|format=PDF|title=Comparison of Hate Crime Rates Across Protected and Unprotected Groups|work= [[Williams Institute]]|date= June 2007|accessdate=2012-03-17}} "A hate crime or bias motivated crime occurs when the perpetrator of the crime intentionally selects the victim because of his or her membership in a certain group."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FBI2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2013/resource-pages/methodology/methodology_final|title=Methodology|work=FBI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Streis"&gt;Streissguth, Tom (2003). ''Hate Crimes'' (Library in a Book), p. 3. {{ISBN|0-8160-4879-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-criminal actions that are motivated by these reasons are often called "[[bias incident]]s".

"Hate crime" generally refers to [[crime|criminal acts]] which are seen to have been motivated by [[bias]] against one or more of the social groups listed above, or by bias against their derivatives. Incidents may involve physical assault, damage to property, [[bullying]], [[harassment]], [[verbal abuse]] or [[insult]]s, [[mate crime]] or offensive [[graffiti]] or letters ([[hate mail]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/hate-crime/|title=Home Office {{!}} Hate crime|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126153146/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/hate-crime/|archive-date=26 November 2005|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hate speech laws exist in many countries. In the United States, hate crime laws have been upheld by both the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] &lt;ref&gt;''[[Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire]]'', 315 U.S. 568, 572 (1942)&lt;/ref&gt; and lower courts, especially in the case of [[Fighting words|'fighting' words]] and other violent speech, but they are thought by some people to be in conflict with the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to [[freedom of speech]], but hate crimes are only regulated through threats of injury or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/do-hate-crime-laws-violate-first-amendment.html|title=Do Hate Crime Laws Violate the First Amendment?|work=www.criminaldefenselawyer.com|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "hate crime" came into common usage in the United States during the 1980s, but the term is often used retrospectively in order to describe events which occurred prior to that era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/civilrights/hate_crimes|title=Hate Crimes|work=FBI|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the Roman [[persecution of Christians]] to the [[Final Solution|Nazi slaughter of Jews]], hate crimes were committed by both individuals and governments long before the term was commonly used.&lt;ref name="Streis"/&gt;

As [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] began to [[colonialism|colonize]] the world from the 16th century onwards, [[indigenous peoples]] in the colonized areas, such as [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] increasingly became the targets of bias-motivated [[intimidation]] and [[violence]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2016}} During the past two centuries, typical examples of hate crimes in the U.S. include [[lynching]]s of [[African Americans]], largely in the [[Southern United States|South]], and lynchings of [[Mexican Americans|Mexicans]] and [[Chinese Americans|Chinese]] in the [[Western United States|West]]; [[cross burning]]s to intimidate black activists or to drive black families from predominantly white neighborhoods both during and after [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]; [[assault]]s on [[white people]] traveling in predominantly black neighborhoods; assaults on [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] people; the painting of [[swastika]]s on Jewish [[synagogue]]s; and [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] responses to a variety of [[minorities|minority]] [[ethnic group]]s.&lt;ref name = "tvccce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bja/162304.pdf |title=A Policymaker's Guide to Hate Crimes |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Duluth-lynching-postcard.jpg|thumb|Postcard of the [[1920 Duluth lynchings|Duluth lynchings]] of African-American men on June 15, 1920]]

The verb "''to [[Lynching|lynch]]''" is attributed to the actions of [[Charles Lynch (jurist)|Charles Lynch]], an 18th-century [[Virginia]] [[Quaker]]. Lynch, other militia officers, and justices of the peace rounded up [[Tory]] sympathizers who were given a summary trial at an informal court; sentences handed down included whipping, property seizure, coerced pledges of allegiance, and conscription into the military. Originally, the term referred to extrajudicial organized but unauthorized punishment of criminals. It later evolved to describe execution outside "ordinary justice." It is highly associated with white suppression of African Americans in the South, and periods of weak or nonexistent [[police authority]], as in certain frontier areas of the [[Old West]].&lt;ref name="Streis"/&gt;

The [[murders of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom]] and the [[Wichita Massacre]] were not classified as "hate crimes" by U.S. investigative officials or the media. In the early 21st century, conservative commentators [[David Horowitz]], [[Michelle Malkin]] ([[Fox News]] channel and author) and [[Stuart Taylor Jr.]] (journalist) did describe these events as "hate crimes against whites by blacks."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/05/hate-crimes-and-double-standards/305992/ Stuart Taylor, Jr. "'Hate Crimes' and Double Standards"], ''[[The Atlantic]],'' 29 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological effects==
Hate crimes can have significant and wide-ranging [[Psychology|psychological]] consequences, not only for their direct victims but for others as well. A 1999 U.S. study of lesbian and gay victims of violent hate crimes documented that they experienced higher levels of psychological distress, including symptoms of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]], than lesbian and gay victims of comparable crimes which were not motivated by antigay bias.&lt;ref

; Impact on the individual victim: psychological and [[affection|affective]] disturbances; repercussions on the victim's identity and [[self-esteem]]; both reinforced by a specific hate crime's degree of violence, which is usually stronger than that of a common crime.
; Effect on the targeted group: generalized [[fear|terror]] in the group to which the victim belongs, inspiring feelings of vulnerability among its other members, who could be the next hate crime victims.
; Effect on other vulnerable groups: ominous effects on [[minority groups]] or on groups that identify themselves with the targeted group, especially when the referred hate is based on an [[ideology]] or a [[doctrine]] that preaches simultaneously against several groups.
; Effect on the community as a whole: divisions and factionalism arising in response to hate crimes are particularly damaging to [[multiculturalism|multicultural societies]].

Hate crime victims can also develop depression and [[psychological trauma]].&lt;ref

A review of European and American research indicates that terrorist bombings cause [[Islamophobia]] and hate crimes to flare up but, in calmer times, they subside again, although to a relatively high level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09596410.2015.1067063?journalCode=cicm20|title = When Is the Time to Hate?

==Laws==
Hate crime laws generally fall into one of several categories:
# laws defining specific bias-motivated acts as distinct crimes;
# criminal penalty-enhancement laws;
# laws creating a distinct civil cause of action for hate crimes; and
# laws requiring administrative agencies to collect hate crime statistics.&lt;ref name="human"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/everyday-fears-080805.pdf |title=Michael McClintock: ''Everyday Fears: A Survey of Violent Hate Crimes in Europe and North America'' |publisher=Humanrightsfirst.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes (as in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]), the laws focus on [[war crimes]], [[genocide]], and [[crimes against humanity]] with the prohibition against discriminatory action limited to public officials.

===Eurasia===

====European Union====
Since 2002, with an amendment to the [[Convention on Cybercrime]], the [[European Union]] mandates individual states to punish as a crime [[hate speech]] done through the [[internet]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ibls.com/internet_law_news_portal_view.aspx?s=latestnews&amp;id=2422 Arias, Martha L.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Andorra====
Discriminatory acts constituting harassment or infringement of a person's dignity on the basis of origin, citizenship, race, religion, or gender (Penal Code Article 313). Courts have cited bias-based motivation in delivering sentences, but there is no explicit penalty enhancement provision in the Criminal Code. The government does not track hate crime statistics, although they are relatively rare.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Armenia====
[[Armenia]] has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes with ethnic, racial, or religious motives (Criminal Code Article 63).&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Austria====
[[Austria]] has a penalty-enhancement statute for reasons like repeating a crime, being especially cruel, using others helpless state, playing a leading role in a crime, or committing a crime with racist, xenophobic or especially reprehensible motivation (Penal Code section 33(5)).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jusline.at/33_Besondere_Erschwerungsgr%C3%BCnde_StGB.html § 33 StGB Besondere Erschwerungsgründe], StGB, accessed 2015-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Azerbaijan====
[[Azerbaijan]] has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes motivated by racial, national, or religious hatred (Criminal Code Article 61). Murder and infliction of serious bodily injury motivated by racial, religious, national, or ethnic intolerance are distinct crimes (Article 111).&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Belarus====
[[Belarus]] has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes motivated by racial, national, and religious hatred and discord.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravo.by/webnpa/text.asp?RN=HK9900275 Criminal Code of the Republic of Belarus, § 64 (1), para. 9 (translated from the Russian)], June 9, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgium====
[[Belgium]]'s Act of 25 February 2003 ("aimed at combating discrimination and modifying the Act of 15 February 1993 which establishes the Centre for Equal Opportunities and the Fight against Racism") establishes a penalty-enhancement for crimes involving discrimination on the basis of gender, supposed race, color, descent, national or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, civil status, birth, fortune, age, religious or philosophical beliefs, current or future state of health and handicap or physical features. The Act also "provides for a civil remedy to address discrimination."&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;  The Act, along with the Act of 20 January 2003 ("on strengthening legislation against racism"), requires the Centre to collect and publish statistical data on racism and discriminatory crimes.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
The Criminal Code of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (enacted 2003) "contains provisions prohibiting discrimination by public officials on grounds, inter alia, of race, skin colour, national or ethnic background, religion and language and prohibiting the restriction by public officials of the language rights of the citizens in their relations with the authorities (Article 145/1 and 145/2)."&lt;ref&gt;Office of the High Representative, [http://www.ohr.int/decisions/judicialrdec/doc/HiRep-dec-101-law-crim-code-bih.doc Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina], January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bulgaria====
[[Bulgaria]]n criminal law prohibits certain crimes motivated by racism and [[xenophobia]], but a 1999 report by the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] found that it does not appear that those provisions "have ever resulted in convictions before the courts in Bulgaria."&lt;ref&gt;ECRI, "Second Report on Bulgaria", adopted on June 18, 1999, and made public on March 21, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Croatia====
The [[Croatia]]n Penal Code explicitly defines hate crime in article 89 as "any crime committed out of hatred for someone's race, skin color, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other belief, national or social background, asset, birth, education, social condition, age, health condition or other attribute".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2006_06_71_1706.html |title=71 28.6.2006 Zakon o izmjenama i dopunama Kaznenog zakona |publisher=Narodne-novine.nn.hr |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 January 2013, a new Penal Code was introduced with the recognition of a hate crime based on "race, skin color, religion, national or ethnic background, sexual orientation or gender identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ravnopravnost.hr/web/184/ |title=Centar za LGBT ravnopravnost » Vlada prihvatila prijedloge Centra za LGBT ravnopravnost |publisher=Ravnopravnost.hr |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331011308/http://www.ravnopravnost.hr/web/184/ |archivedate=2012-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Czech Republic====
The Czech legislation finds its constitutional basis in the principles of equality and non-discrimination contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms. From there, we can trace two basic lines of protection against hate-motivated incidents: one passes through criminal law, the other through civil law.
The current Czech criminal legislation has implications both for decisions about guilt (affecting the decision whether to find a defendant guilty or not guilty) and decisions concerning sentencing (affecting the extent of the punishment imposed). It has '''three levels''', to wit:
* a '''circumstance determining whether an act is a crime''' – hate motivation is included in the basic constituent elements. If hate motivation is not proven, conviction for a hate crime is not possible.
* a '''circumstance determining the imposition of a higher penalty''' – a hate motivation is included in the qualified constituent elements for some types of crimes (murder, bodily harm). If hate motivation is not proven, the penalty is imposed according to the scale specified for the basic constituent elements of the crime.
* '''general aggravating circumstance''' – the court is obligated to take the hate motivation into account as a general aggravating circumstance and determines the amount of penalty to impose. Nevertheless, it is not possible to add together a general aggravating circumstance and a circumstance determining the imposition of a higher penalty. (see Annex for details)
Current criminal legislation '''does not provide for special penalties''' for acts that target another by reason of his '''sexual orientation, age or health status'''. Only the constituent elements of the criminal offense of Incitement to hatred towards a group of persons or to the curtailment of their rights and freedoms, and general aggravating circumstances include attacking a so-called different group of people. Such a group of people can then, of course, be also one defined by sexual orientation, age or health status. A certain disparity has thus been created between, on the one hand, those groups of people who are victimized by reason of their skin color, faith, nationality, ethnicity or political persuasion and enjoy increased protection, and, on the other hand, those groups that are victimized by reason of their sexual orientation, age or health status and are not granted increased protection. This gap in protection against attacks motivated by the victim's sexual orientation, age or health status cannot be successfully bridged by interpretation. Interpretation by analogy is inadmissible in criminal law, sanctionable motivations being exhaustively enumerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in-ius.cz/dwn/zprava-o-nzn2011/report-web.pdf |title=Zpráva o násilí z nenávisti v České republice za rok 2011 |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denmark====
Although [[Denmark|Danish]] law does not include explicit hate crime provisions, "section 80(1) of the Criminal Code instructs courts to take into account the gravity of the offence and the offender's motive when meting out penalty, and therefore to attach importance to the racist motive of crimes in determining sentence."&lt;ref&gt;ECRI, “Second Report on Denmark,” adopted on June 16, 2000, and made public on April 3, 2001, para. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years judges have used this provision to increase sentences on the basis of racist motives.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chahrokh, Klug, and Bilger, Migrants, Minorities, and Legislation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1992, the Danish Civil Security Service (PET) has released statistics on crimes with apparent racist motivation.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Estonia====
Under section 151 of the Criminal Code of [[Estonia]] of 6 June 2001, which entered into force on 1 September 2002, with amendments and supplements and as amended by the Law of 8 December 2011, "activities which publicly incite to hatred, violence or discrimination on the basis of nationality, race, colour, sex, language, origin, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion, or financial or social status, if this results in danger to the life, health or property of a person, are punishable by a fine of up to 300 fine units or by detention".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislationline.org/documents/action/popup/id/18762 Criminal Code of Estonia of 6 June 2001, entered into force on 1 September 2002, with amendments and supplements and latest amendment by the Law of 8 December 2011, published in RT I, 29.12.2011, 1 and entered into force on 1 January 2012 (excerpts)], accessed 27 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finland====
[[Finland|Finnish]] [[Criminal Code of Finland|Criminal Code]] 515/2003 (enacted January 31, 2003) makes "committing a crime against a person, because of his national, racial, ethnical or equivalent group" an aggravating circumstance in sentencing.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EUMC, “Racism and xenophobia in the E.U.,” p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ethnic agitation ({{lang-fi|kiihotus kansanryhmää vastaan}}) is criminalized and carries a fine or a prison sentence of not more than two years. The prosecution need not prove that an actual danger to an ethnic group is caused but only that malicious message is conveyed. A more aggravated hate crime, warmongering ({{lang-fi|sotaan yllyttäminen}}), carries a prison sentence of one to ten years. However, in case of warmongering, the prosecution must prove an [[overt act]] that evidently increases the risk that Finland is involved in a war or becomes a target for a military operation. The act in question may consist of
# illegal violence directed against a foreign country or its citizens,
# systematic dissemination of false information on Finnish foreign policy or defense
# public influence on the public opinion towards a pro-war viewpoint or
# public suggestion that a foreign country or Finland should engage in an aggressive act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039.pdf Penal Code (39/1889)] as of 1006/2004. §§ 6:5.1.4 (ethnic hatred as an aggravating factor), 11:8 (ethnic agitation) and 12:2 (warmongering).

====France====
In 2003, France enacted penalty-enhancement hate crime laws for crimes motivated by bias against the victim's actual or perceived ethnicity, nation, race, religion, or sexual orientation. The penalties for murder were raised from 30 years (for non-hate crimes) to life imprisonment (for hate crimes), and the penalties for violent attacks leading to permanent disability were raised from 10 years (for non-hate crimes) to 15 years (for hate crimes).&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000781920 Loi n° 2003–88 du 3 février 2003 visant à aggraver les peines punissant les infractions à caractère raciste, antisémite ou xénophobe]''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Georgia====
"There is no general provision in Georgian law for racist motivation to be considered an aggravating circumstance in prosecutions of ordinary offenses. Certain crimes involving racist motivation are, however, defined as specific offenses in the Georgian Criminal Code of 1999, including murder motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 109); infliction of serious
injuries motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 117); and torture motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 126). ECRI reported no knowledge of cases in which this law has been enforced. There is no systematic monitoring or data collection on discrimination in Georgia."&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Germany====
The [[German Criminal Code]] does not have hate crime legislation, but instead criminalizes [[hate speech]] under a number of different laws, including [[Volksverhetzung]]. In the German legal framework [[motivation]] is not taken into account while identifying the element of the offence. However, within the sentencing procedure the judge can define certain principles for determining punishment. In section 46 of the German Criminal Code it is stated that "the motives and aims of the perpetrator; the state of mind reflected in the act and the willfulness involved in its commission."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#46 |title=Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch, StGB) |publisher=Iuscomp.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be taken into consideration when determining the [[punishment]]; under this statute, hate and bias have been taken into consideration in sentencing in past cases.&lt;ref name="Marc Coester 2008"&gt;Marc Coester (2008): Das Konzept der Hate Crimes aus den USA unter besonderer Berücksichtigung des Rechtsextremismus in Deutschland.

Hate crimes are not specifically tracked by German police, but have been studied separately: a recently published EU "Report on Racism" finds that racially motivated attacks are frequent in Germany, identifying 18,142 incidences for 2006, of which 17,597 were motivated by right wing ideologies, both about a 14% year-by-year increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,502471,00.html |title=EU Xenophobia Report: Racism On the Rise in Germany  |work=Der Spiegel |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Relative to the size of the population, this represents an eightfold higher rate of hate crimes than reported in the US during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2007/november/hatecrime_111907 |title=2006 Hate Crime in the U.S |publisher=Fbi.gov |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Awareness of hate crimes and right-wing extremism in Germany remains low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,502694,00.html |title= Interview with Racism Expert: 'Awareness of Ethnic Discrimination Is Low in Germany' |work=Der Spiegel |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "religious group" is a group of persons defined by reference to religious belief or lack of religious belief. The specified crimes are assault, criminal damage, offences under the [[Public Order Act 1986]], and offences under the [[Protection from Harassment Act 1997]].

Sections 145 and 146 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] require a court to consider whether a crime which is not specified by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 is racially or religiously aggravated, and to consider whether the following circumstances were pertinent to the crime:
:(a) that, at the time of committing the offence, or immediately before or after doing so, the offender demonstrated towards the victim of the offence hostility based on—
::(i) the sexual orientation (or presumed sexual orientation) of the victim, or
::(ii) a disability (or presumed disability) of the victim, or
:(b) that the offence is motivated (wholly or partly)—
::(i) by hostility towards persons who are of a particular sexual orientation, or
::(ii) by hostility towards persons who have a disability or a particular disability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030044_en_14#pt12-ch1-pb1-l1g145 Sections 145 and 146 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hate crime" legislation is distinct from "hate speech" legislation.

The theme of the conference was ‘Report it to Sort it’ and the emphasis was on encouraging people to tell police if they have been a victim of hate crime, whether it be based on race, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity or disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopthehate.org.uk/2013/12/launch-of-stop-the-hate-initiative |title=Launch of ‘Stop the Hate’ initiative |publisher=Stop the hate |date=2013-12-04 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most high-profile hate crime in modern Britain occurred in [[Eltham]], [[London]], on 24 April 1993, when 18-year-old black student [[Stephen Lawrence]] was stabbed to death in an attack by a gang of white youths. Two white teenagers were later charged with the murder, and at least three other suspects were mentioned in the national media, but the charges against them were dropped within three months after the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute. However, a change in the law a decade later allowed a suspect to be charged with a crime twice if new evidence emerged after the original charges were dropped or a "not guilty" verdict was delivered in court. Gary Dobson, who had been charged with the murder in the initial 1993 investigation, was found guilty of Stephen Lawrence's murder in January 2012 and sentenced to life imprisonment, as was David Norris, who had not been charged in 1993. A third suspect, Luke Knight, had been charged in 1993 but was not charged when the case came to court nearly 20 years later.

=====Scotland=====

====Canada====
"In Canada the legal definition of hate crime can be found in sections 318 and 319 of the Criminal Code".
&lt;ref name="autogenerated161"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Grady|first=William|title=Crime In Canadian Context: debates and controversies|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-543378-4|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 the federal government amended a section of the Criminal Code that pertains to sentencing. Specifically, section 718.2. The section states (with regard to the hate crime):

''A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:

''(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,''

''(i) evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor, . . . shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances.''''
&lt;ref name="autogenerated161"/&gt;

A vast majority (84 per cent) of hate crime perpetrators were "male, with an average age of just under 30. Less than 10 of those accused had criminal records, and less than 5 per cent had previous hate crime involvement (ibid O’Grady 2010 page 163.)."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Grady|first=William|title=Crime In Canadian Context: debates and controversies|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-543378-4|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Only 4 percent of hate crimes were linked to an organized or extremist group (Silver et al., 2004)."
&lt;ref name="autogenerated162"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Grady|first=William|title=Crime In Canadian Context: debates and controversies|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-543378-4|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2004, Jewish people were the largest ethnic group targeted by hate crimes, followed by blacks, Muslims, South Asians, and homosexuals (Silver et al., 2004).&lt;ref name="autogenerated162"/&gt;

During the Nazi regime, anti-Semitism was a cause of hate related violence in Canada. For example, on August 16, 1933 there was a baseball game in Toronto and one team was made up of mostly Jewish players. At the end of the game, a group of Nazi sympathizers unfolded a Swastika flag and shouted ‘Heil Hitler’. That event [[Christie Pits riot|erupted into a brawl]] that had Jews and Italians against Anglo Canadians and the brawl went on for hours.&lt;ref name="autogenerated161"/&gt;

The first time someone was charged with hate speech over the internet occurred on 27 March 1996. "A Winnipeg teenager was arrested by the police for sending an email to a local political activist that contained the message ‘Death to homosexuals’ it's prescribed in the Bible! Better watch out next Gay Pride Week.’ (Nairne, 1996)."&lt;ref name="autogenerated162"/&gt;

Hate crime laws have a long history in the United States. The first hate crime&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015/topic-pages/incidentsandoffenses_final.pdf|title=Hate Crime Statistics, 2015|last=|first=|date=Fall 2016|website=ucr.fbi.gov|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; laws were passed after the [[American Civil War]], beginning with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]], to combat the growing number of racially motivated crimes being committed by the Reconstruction era [[Ku Klux Klan]]. The modern era of hate-crime legislation began in 1968 with the passage of federal statute, 18 U.S. 245, part of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968|Civil Rights Act]] which made it illegal to "by force or by threat of force, injure, intimidate, or interfere with anyone who is engaged in six specified protected activities, by reason of their [[race (classification of humans)|race]], [[color]], [[religion]], or [[national origin]]." However, "The prosecution of such crimes must be certified by the U.S. attorney general.".&lt;ref&gt;Streissguth (2003), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first state hate-crime statute, California's Section 190.2, was passed in 1978 and provided for penalty enhancement in cases where murder was motivated by prejudice against four "protected status" categories: race, religion, color, and national origin. Washington included [[ancestry]] in a statute passed in 1981. Alaska included [[creed]] and [[sex]] in 1982 and later [[disability]], [[sexual orientation]], and [[ethnicity]]. In the 1990s some state laws began to include [[ageing|age]], [[marital status]], membership in the [[armed forces]], and membership in [[civil rights]] organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Streissguth (2003), pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal acts which could be considered hate crimes in various states included [[aggravated assault]], [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]], [[vandalism]], [[rape]], [[threat]]s and [[intimidation]], [[arson]], [[trespassing]], [[stalking]], and various "lesser" acts until in 1987 California state legislation included all crimes as possible hate crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Streissguth (2003), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defined in the 1999 National Crime Victim Survey, "A hate crime is a criminal offense. In the [[United States]], federal prosecution is possible for hate crimes committed on the basis of a person's race, religion, or nation origin when engaging in a federally protected activity." In 2009, the [[Matthew Shepard Act]] added actual or perceived [[gender]], [[gender identity]], [[sexual orientation]], and [[disability]] to the federal definition, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.

Forty-five states and the [[District of Columbia]] have statutes criminalizing various types of hate crimes. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have statutes creating a [[Legal liability|civil cause of action]] in addition to the criminal penalty for similar acts. Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have statutes requiring the state to collect hate crime statistics.&lt;ref name="adl"&gt;[http://www.adl.org/99hatecrime/state_hate_crime_laws.pdf State Hate Crime Laws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614124916/http://www.adl.org/99hatecrime/state_hate_crime_laws.pdf |date=2007-06-14 }}, [[Anti-Defamation League]], June 2006.

According to the [[FBI]] Hate Crime Statistics report for 2006, hate crimes increased nearly 8% nationwide, with a total of 7,722 incidents and 9,080 offenses reported by participating law enforcement agencies.  Of the 5,449 crimes against persons, 46% were classified as intimidation and 32% as simple assaults. 81% of the 3,593 crimes against property were acts of vandalism or destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics, 2006 [https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2006/index.html Hate Crime Statistics, 2006], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717214828/https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2006/index.html |date=July 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to the [[FBI]] Hate Crime Statistics for 2007, the number of hate crimes decreased to 7,624 incidents reported by participating law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics, 2007 [https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2007/table_02.htm Hate Crime Statistics, 2007], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709181446/https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2007/table_02.htm |date=July 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These incidents included 9 murders and 2 rapes(out of the almost 17,000 murders and 90,000 forcible rapes committed in the U.S. in 2007).&lt;ref&gt;Statistics, 2007 [https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2007/data/table_01.html FBI Crime in the United States 2007], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504123717/http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2007/data/table_01.html |date=May 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Attorney General]] Eric Holder said in June 2009 that recent killings show the need for a tougher U.S. hate crimes law to stop "violence masquerading as political activism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31392054/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/ |title=Attorney general urges new hate crimes law – Crime &amp; courts|publisher=MSNBC |date=2009-06-16 |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 hate crime statistics show 46.9% were motivated by race and 20.8% by sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lakeconews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=28459:fbi-releases-2011-hate-crime-statistics&amp;catid=1:latest&amp;Itemid=197 |title=FBI releases 2011 hate crime statistics |publisher=Lakeconews.com |date=2012-12-11 |accessdate=2013-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517030446/http://www.lakeconews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=28459%3Afbi-releases-2011-hate-crime-statistics&amp;catid=1%3Alatest&amp;Itemid=197 |archivedate=2013-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Hate Crimes Statistics report identified 5,818 single-bias incidents involving 6,837 offenses, 7,121 victims, and 5,475 known offenders&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015/topic-pages/incidentsandoffenses_final.pdf|title=Hate Crime Statistics, 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=ucr.fbi.gov|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutions of hate crimes have been difficult in the United States. Recently though, state governments have attempted to re-investigate and re-try past hate crimes. One prominent example is Mississippi's decision in 1990 to retry [[Byron De La Beckwith]] for the murder of [[Medgar Evers]], a prominent figure in the NAACP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Labuda|first=P.|title=Racial Reconciliation in Mississippi: An Evaluation of the Proposal to Establish a Mississippi Truth and Reconciliation Commission.|journal=Harvard Blackletter Law Journal|year=2011|volume=271|pages=1–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This would be the first time in U.S. history that an unresolved civil rights case would be re-opened. Byron De La Beckwith, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, was tried for the murder on two previous occasions and it resulted with a hung jury. However, he was finally sentenced to life in prison in 1994. Presented with testimony of two FBI informants who had infiltrated the KKK, the missing transcript from the first trial, the relocation of missing witnesses, numerous witness admissions of Beckwith bragging about his role in the murder and Beckwith's own racist writings, a mixed race jury found Beckwith guilty of murder. Even though De La Beckwith was 73 years of age when he was sentenced to life in prison, the 1994 conviction has been interpreted as a way for Mississippi to shed its racist past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alston, A.A. |author2=Dickerson, J.L.|title=Devil’s Sanctuary: An Eye-Witness History of Mississippi Hate Crimes|year=2009|publisher=Lawrence Hill Books|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a November 2016 report issued by the FBI hate crime statistics are on the rise in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latest Hate Crime Statistics Released - Annual Report Sheds Light on Serious Issue|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2015-hate-crime-statistics-released|website=FBI|publisher=FBI|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of hate crimes increased from 5,850 in 2015, to 6,121 hate crime incidents in 2016, an increase of 4.6 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Licthblau|first1=Eric|title=U.S. Hate Crimes Surge 6%, Fueled by Attacks on Muslims|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/us/politics/fbi-hate-crimes-muslims.html|accessdate=18 December 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mathias|first1=Christopher|title=Hate Crimes Rose About 5 Percent In 2016, FBI Report Says|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fbi-hate-crimes-report-2016_us_5a08c795e4b01d21c83f46ac|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Hate Crime Statistics|url=https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2016/topic-pages/incidentsandoffenses|publisher=FBI|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Victims in the United States=====
One of the largest waves of hate crimes took place during the [[civil rights movement]]. During the 1950s and 1960s, both violence and threats of violence were common against African Americans, and hundreds of lives were lost due to such acts. Members of this [[social class]] faced violence from [[hate groups|groups]] such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] as well as violence from individuals who were committed to maintaining [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/hate-crimes-changed-history.html#|title=Hate Crimes that Changed History {{!}} Criminal Law|newspaper=CriminalDefenseLawyer.com|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, civil rights leaders such as [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and their supporters fought hard for the right of African Americans to vote as well as for equality in their everyday lives. African Americans have been the target of hate crimes since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]],&lt;ref name="americansperspective.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://americansperspective.com/10-of-the-worst-hate-crimes-and-violence-in-domestic-american-history/#|title=10 Of The Worst Hate Crimes and Violence in Domestic American History|date=2015-06-22|newspaper=americansperspective.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the humiliation of this [[social class]] was also desired by many Anti-black individuals. Other frequently reported bias motivations were bias against a religion, bias against a particular sexual orientation, and bias against a particular ethnicity/national origin.&lt;ref name="fbi 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2010/narratives/hate-crime-2010-victims |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]|title=Hate Crime Statistics, 2010|accessdate=March 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, these bias motivations overlapped, because violence can be both anti-gay and anti-black, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Doug|title=Evaluating the Severity of Hate-motivated Violence: Intersectional Differences among LGBT Hate Crime Victims|journal=Sociology|year=2010|volume=44|issue=5|pages=980–95|doi=10.1177/0038038510375737|url=http://soc.sagepub.com/content/44/5/980.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts have compared groups in terms of the per capita rate of hate crimes committed against them, to allow for differing populations.
Overall, the total number of hate crimes committed since the first hate crime bill was passed in 1997 is 86,582.&lt;ref name="The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shepard|first1=Mathew|last2=Byrd|first2=James Jr.|title=Hate Crimes Law|journal=Human Rights Campaign|date=2011–2014|url=http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/hate-crimes-law}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ray Hate Crimes Prevention Act]]

Among the groups currently mentioned in the [[Hate Crime Statistics Act|Hate Crimes Statistics Act]], the largest number of hate crimes are committed against African Americans.&lt;ref name="Reports and Curricula"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.civilrights.org/publications/reports/cause_for_concern/p8.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/|title=Reports and Curricula|newspaper=The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Civil Rights Movement, some of the most notorious hate crimes included the 1968 [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]], the 1964 murders of Charles Moore and Henry Dee, the 1963 [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]], the 1955 murder of [[Emmett Till]],&lt;ref name="americansperspective.com"/&gt; as well as the burning of crosses, churches, Jewish synagogues and other places of worship of minority religions. Such acts began to take place more frequently after the [[racial integration]] of many schools and public facilities.&lt;ref name="Reports and Curricula"/&gt;

High-profile murders targeting victims based on their sexual orientation have prompted the passage of hate crimes legislation, notably the cases of [[Sean W. Kennedy]] and [[Matthew Shepard]]. Kennedy's murder was mentioned by Senator [[Gordon Smith (politician)|Gordon Smith]] in a speech on the floor of the US Senate while he advocated such legislation.  The [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]] was signed into law in 2009. It included sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, the disabled, and military personnel and their family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Matthew Shepard And James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act Of 2009 {{!}} CRT {{!}} Department of Justice|url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/matthew-shepard-and-james-byrd-jr-hate-crimes-prevention-act-2009-0|website=www.justice.gov|accessdate=29 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=military and families at least not obvious from linked article|date=June 2013}} This is the first all-inclusive bill ever passed in the United States, taking 45 years to complete.{{clarify|"all-inclusive" how/45 years how?|date=June 2013}}

Gender-based crimes may also be considered hate crimes.

In May 2018, ''ProPublica'' reviewed police reports for 58 cases of purported anti-heterosexual hate crimes. ''ProPublica'' found that about half of the cases were anti-LGBT hate crimes that had been miscategorized, and that the rest were motivated by hate towards Jews, blacks or women or that there was no element of a hate crime at all. ''ProPublica'' found not a single case of a hate crime spurred by anti-heterosexual bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/police-are-mislabeling-crimes-as-anti-heterosexual-hate-crimes|title=Police Are Mislabeling Anti-LGBTQ and Other Crimes as Anti-Heterosexual — ProPublica|date=2018-05-15|website=ProPublica|language=en-us|others=Rachel Glickhouse, Rahima Nasa|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===

====Brazil====
In [[Brazil]], hate crime laws focus on [[racism]], racial [[injury]], and other special bias-motivated crimes such as, for example, murder by [[death squad]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L8072.htm|title=L8072|website=www.planalto.gov.br}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[genocide]] on the grounds of [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], race or religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L2889.htm|title=L2889|website=www.planalto.gov.br}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murder by death squads and genocide are legally classified as "hideous crimes" (''crimes hediondos'' in Portuguese).&lt;ref&gt;Law 8072/1990 (aforementioned link), Article 1st, I and single paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crimes of racism and racial injury, although similar, are enforced slightly differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boletimjuridico.com.br/doutrina/texto.asp?id=662 |title=Racismo ou injúria racial? - Boletim Jurídico |publisher=Boletimjuridico.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 140, 3rd paragraph, of the [[Penal Code]] establishes a harsher penalty, from a minimum of 1 year to a maximum of 3 years, for injuries motivated by "elements referring to race, color, [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], origin, or the condition of being an aged or [[disability|disabled person]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Decreto-Lei/Del2848compilado.htm |title=DEL2848compilado |publisher=Planalto.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side, Law 7716/1989 covers "crimes resulting from [[discrimination]] or [[prejudice]] on the grounds of race, color, ethnicity, religion, or national origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L7716.htm |title=L7716 |publisher=Planalto.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Brazilian Constitution defines as a "fundamental goal of the Republic" (Article 3rd, clause IV) "to promote the well-being of all, with no prejudice as to [[nationality|origin]], race, sex, color, age, and any other forms of discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao_Compilado.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chile====
In 2012, the Anti-discrimination law amended the Criminal Code adding a new aggravating circumstance of criminal responsibility, as follows: "Committing or participating in a crime motivated by ideology, political opinion, religion or beliefs of the victim; nation, race, ethnic or social group; sex, [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], age, affiliation, personal appearance or suffering from illness or disability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=1984|title=COD-PENAL 12-NOV-1874 MINISTERIO DE JUSTICIA - Ley Chile - Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional|website=www.leychile.cl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=1042092|title=LEY-20609 24-JUL-2012 MINISTERIO SECRETARÍA GENERAL DE GOBIERNO - Ley Chile - Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional|website=www.leychile.cl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel is the only country in the middle east who has hate crime laws. Hate crime, as passed by the Isreli Knesset (Parliament), is defined as crime for reason of race, religion, gender and sexual orientation

==Support for and opposition to hate crime laws==

===Support===
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
Justifications for harsher punishments for hate crimes focus on the notion that hate crimes cause greater individual and societal harm.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} It is said&lt;ref&gt;Marian Duggan and Vicky Heap, ''Administrating Victimization: The Politics of AntiSocial Behaviour and Hate Crime Policy'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; that, when the core of a person's identity is attacked, the degradation and [[dehumanization]] is especially severe, and additional emotional and physiological problems are likely to result. Society then, in turn, can suffer from the [[empowerment|disempowerment]] of a group of people.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Furthermore, it is asserted that the chances for retaliatory crimes are greater when a hate crime has been committed. The [[1992 Los Angeles riots|riots]] in [[Los Angeles]], California that followed the beating of [[Rodney King]], a Black motorist, by a group of [[white people|White]] police officers are cited as support for this argument.&lt;ref name = "tvccce"/&gt; The beating of white truck driver [[Reginald Oliver Denny|Reginald Denny]] by black rioters during the same riot is also an example that supports this argument.

In ''[[Wisconsin v. Mitchell]]'', the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] unanimously found that ''penalty-enhancement'' hate crime statutes do not conflict with [[free speech]] rights, because they do not punish an individual for exercising [[freedom of expression]]; rather, they allow courts to consider [[motive (law)|motive]] when sentencing a criminal for conduct which is not protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/supreme-court-drama/wisconsin-v-mitchell|accessdate=2011-10-12|title=Wisconsin v. Mitchell|publisher=Enotes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst in the case of ''[[Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire]]'' the court defined "fighting words" as "those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Sumner | first = L.W. | author-link = L.

===Opposition===
The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously found the [[R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul|St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance]] amounted to viewpoint-based discrimination is in conflict with rights of free speech, because it selectively criminalized bias-motivated speech or symbolic speech for disfavored topics while permitting such speech for other topics.&lt;ref&gt;''[[R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul]]'', 505 U.S. 377 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics further assert that it conflicts with an even more fundamental right: free thought. The claim is that hate-crime legislation effectively makes certain ideas or beliefs, including religious ones, illegal, in other words, [[thought crime]]s.&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

In their book ''Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics'', [[James B. Jacobs]] and Kimberly Potter criticize hate crime legislation for exacerbating conflicts between groups.  They assert that by defining crimes as being committed by one group against another, rather than as being committed by individuals against their society, the labeling of crimes as "hate crimes" causes groups to feel persecuted by one another, and that this impression of persecution can incite a [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]] and thus lead to an actual increase in crime.&lt;ref name="Jacobs, James B. 1998"&gt;Jacobs, James B. &amp; Kimberly Potter. (1998). Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics. New York: Oxford University Press,&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobs and Potter also argued that hate crime legislation can end up only covering the victimization of some groups rather than all, which is a form of discrimination itself and that attempts to remedy this by making all identifiable groups covered by hate crime protection thus make hate crimes co-terminus with generic criminal law. The authors also suggest that arguments which attempt to portray hate crimes as worse than normal crimes because they spread fear in a community are unsatisfactory, as normal criminal acts can also spread fear yet only hate crimes are singled out.&lt;ref name="Jacobs, James B. 1998"/&gt; Indeed it has been argued that victims have varied reactions to hate crimes, so it is no necessarily true that hate crimes are regarded as more harmful than other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Iganski, Paul, and Spiridoula Lagou. "Hate crimes hurt some more than others: Implications for the just sentencing of offenders." Journal of interpersonal violence 30.10 (2015): 1696-1718.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mellgren, C., Andersson, M., &amp; Ivert, A.-K. (2017). For Whom Does Hate Crime Hurt More? A Comparison of Consequences of Victimization Across Motives and Crime Types. Journal of Interpersonal Violence. https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260517746131&lt;/ref&gt; Heidi Hurd argues that hate crime represents an effort by the state to encourage a certain moral character in its citizen and thus represents the view that the instillation of virtue and the elimination of vice are legitimate state goals, which she argues is a contradiction of the principles of liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Hurd, Heidi. "Why Liberals Should Hate'Hate Crime Legislation'." (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some have argued hate crime laws bring the law into disrepute and further divide society, as groups apply to have their critics silenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Troy |first=Daniel E. |url=http://www.aei.org/speech/17122 |title=AEI – Short Publications |publisher=Aei.org |date=1999-08-04 |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610125417/http://www.aei.org/speech/17122 |archivedate=2011-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; American forensic psychologist [[Karen Franklin]] said that the term ''hate crime'' is somewhat misleading since it assumes there is a hateful motivation which is not present in many occasions;&lt;ref name=twsFrontline&gt;Frontline (PBS),[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/interviews/franklin.html Interviews], Accessed July 26, 2014, "...forensic psychologist, Karen Franklin's dual interests in psychology and the law brought her to question the roots of anti-gay hate crimes... badly needed empirical data on the nature and extent of negative reactions to gays..."&lt;/ref&gt; in her view, laws to punish people who commit hate crimes may not be the best remedy for preventing them because the threat of future punishment does not usually deter such criminal acts.&lt;ref name="twsAdvocate"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14201">The '''International Moral Education Congress''' was an international [[academic conference]] held in Europe six times between 1908 and 1934. It convened because of an interest in moral education by many countries beginning a decade before the inaugural event. The movement for moral education had an ardent champion in the [[Ethical movement]].&lt;ref name=1st1908 /&gt; The idea to hold the congress was at the behest of the International Union of Ethical Societies; its greatest proponents were Professor [[Friedrich Wilhelm Foerster]] and [[Gustav Spiller]], the secretary of the Union.&lt;ref name=Sadler1909&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadler|first1=M.

The official languages were German, English, and French.&lt;ref name=unige.ch&gt;{{cite web|title=Sources and general information about selected international congresses - Appendix n°2|url=http://www.unige.ch/fapse/SSE/erhise/pdf/Appendix2ESHHS01.pdf|publisher=Université de Genève|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Moral Education League of London was founded in 1897. This organization exercised a considerable influence, not only in the United Kingdom but in various parts of the British Empire and throughout the world. Its president was [[John Stuart Mackenzie]]. Among its members were Catholics, Anglicans, Jews, Unitarians, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Nonconformists, Ethicists, Rationalists, Positivists, and others. Its secretary was Harrold Johnson, who was later appointed Hon. Secretary of the International Moral Education Congress Executive Council. The league also employed a demonstrator, [[Frederick James Gould]], who acquired an international reputation for his numerous 
books on moral lessons. This League succeeded in 1906 in inducing the Board of Education to make provision for moral instruction in the education code for England and Wales.&lt;ref name=Aikins1913&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aikins|first1=J.A.M.|title=Report on the second International Moral Education Congress at The Hague, August, 1912 and as related thereto moral instruction in the Canadian public schools|url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7062408M/Report_on_the_second_International_Moral_Education_Congress_at_The_Hague_August_1912|location=Ottawa|pages=3-|year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, a new Italian Education Code was published, laying the utmost stress on moral education and making detailed regulations with regard to moral instruction. In the following year, a new Hungarian Education Code was issued. In 1905, a new Austrian Education Code came to light. In Portugal, a manual of Moral Instruction for Primary Schools, as distinct from Religious Instruction, was officially published in 1906. In the United States, schemes of moral instruction were elaborated in many places. In Germany, the Reading Books for Elementary Schools contained abundance of ethical matter. In Switzerland, several Cantons took distinct steps in the direction of drawing up Moral Instruction Programmes. In Belgium, Moral Instruction Syllabuses for Primary Schools and for Training Colleges existed. In France and Japan, where moral instruction was introduced, the subject was being studied with redoubled interest. In Russia, the authorities were turning their attention to this subject. And, finally, in England, the Code of the Board of Education for 1906 stated that "Moral instruction should form an important part of every school curriculum". Educationists generally laid increasing emphasis on the moral factor in education, while men in every walk of life came more and more to feel that the training of the intellect must be accompanied by the development of character if the school is to serve effectively the nation and humanity. This movement for moral education had an ardent champion in the [[Ethical movement]].&lt;ref name=1st1908 /&gt;

==1908==
[[File:Sir Michael Ernest Sadler photo by George Charles Beresford 1914.jpg|thumbnail|Sir Michael Ernest Sadler, president of the First Congress]]
The First Congress was held at the [[University of London]], London, England, on September 25–29, 1908.&lt;ref name=archive.org1st&gt;{{cite web|author1=International Moral Education Congress|author2=Spiller, Gustav|title=Papers on moral education, communicated to the first International Moral Education Congress held at the University of London September 25-29, 1908; (1908)|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924030610954|publisher=Cornell University Library|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Sadler (educationist)|Michael Sadler]] served as president. The Congress counted altogether some 1,800 members and 2,000 volumes of the Papers on Moral Education were disposed of within less than four weeks after the first Congress met.&lt;ref name=1st1908 /&gt; Both the educational magazines and the leading daily papers rendered valuable assistance to the Congress. There were sessions on the following topics: The Principles of Moral Education; Aims, Means and Limitations in the various types of schools; Character Building by Discipline, Influence and Opportunity; the Problems of Moral Instruction; Relation of Religious Education to Moral Education; Systematic Moral Instruction; The Relation of Moral Education to Education under Other Aspects; the Problem of Moral Education under varying conditions of Age and Opportunity; Biology and Moral Education.&lt;ref name=Aikins1913 /&gt;

==1912==
The Second Congress was held at the Hague, August 22–27, 1912.&lt;ref name=archive.org2nd&gt;{{cite web|author1=International Moral Education Congress|author2=Aikins, James Albert Manning|title=Report on the second International Moral Education Congress at The Hague, August, 1912, and as related thereto moral instruction in the Canadian public schools (1913)|url=https://archive.org/details/reportonthesecon00unknuoft|publisher=University of Toronto Libraries|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. J. Th. Mouton was the President of the Executive Committee.&lt;ref name="The1912"&gt;{{cite book|title=British Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2VUwAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA488|edition=Public domain|year=1912|publisher=The Publisher's Circular Limited|pages=488–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following twenty-three countries sent official government delegates: Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Chili, China, Denmark, Egypt, France, Greece, Haiti, Hungary, India (British), Ireland, Japan, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Romania, South Australia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and Tunis. Over 1,000 members (apart from honorary members) were officially enrolled for the congress. Over 200 papers of some 2,000 words each were contributed and appeared in the five published volumes of more than 1,200 pages. The subjects dealt with and under discussion at the various sessions were: Moral Education and Character Building considered from the Denominationalist, the Undenominationalist and the Independent-Moralist points of view; Moral Education considered from social and national points of view Formation of the Will; Physical Training as a means of Character-Building; Moral Education considered from a Practical Point of View; the Moral Education of Adolescents; Character-Building in family life and in society at large; Character-Building of young people at educational institutions not dedicated to the ordinary primary education; Character-Building of Abnormal Children. This Congress stated it would not advocate the views of any society or party, but it would afford to all who are interested in moral education, whatever their religious or ethical convictions, nationality and point of view, an equal opportunity of expressing their opinions and comparing them with those of others. This proved so good a basis that the congress with unanimity adopted it as the basis of future congresses, with the addition of the following object: The object of the Congress is to enlist the active co-operation of all, irrespective of race, nations, and creed, in promoting the work of moral education. The first aim of the Second Congress, as of the first, was to cultivate the co-operation of men and women representing different schools of thought in matters of education, giving every one an opportunity in the spirit of toleration, of defining and explaining his opinion and point of view.&lt;ref name=Aikins1913 /&gt;

==1922==
[[File:AdolpheFerriereND.jpg|thumbnail|Adolphe Ferriere, president of the Third Congress]]
The Third Congress met in the Aula, or Assembly Hall, of the [[University of Geneva]], July 28 to August 1, 1922.&lt;ref name=archive.org3rd&gt;{{cite web|title=International Moral Education Congress|publisher=JSTOR|url=https://archive.org/stream/jstor-2377499/2377499_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 500 members attended, representing 30 nationalities and 29 national committees. Thirty-three papers were contributed, all being published in French, in two volumes, by Delachaux, at Neuchatel. The topics were confined to (1) the international motive, with special reference to the teaching of history; and (2) the motive of service. [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Frederick Pollock]] gave the inaugural address on behalf of the International Executive Council (London), and was followed by the newly elected president of the Congress, Dr. [[Adolphe Ferrière]], who was an  advocate of [[progressive education]]. Among the speakers during the eight sessions, perhaps the most popular were three—Professor Foerster; [[Albert Thomas (minister)|M. Albert Thomas]], Director of the Labor Office of the League of Nations; and [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]], the founder of the Scout Movement. A special session was held in the hall of the Secretariat of the League of Nations, chaired by [[Gustav Spiller]], which included [[Nitobe Inazō]], Director of the Section of International Bureaus. The Congress approved of the establishment of an International Moral Education Bureau at the Hague, and decided to form a permanent association of educationists of the world, based on the 29 national committees already existing.&lt;ref name="National1921"&gt;{{cite book|author=National Education Association of the United States|title=Today's Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t2IVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA316|edition=Public domain|year=1921|publisher=National Education Association|pages=316–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fourth Congress took place in [[Rome]], Italy, from September 28 to October 2, 1926. Francesco Orestano served as president.&lt;ref name="League1925"&gt;{{cite book|title=Quarterly Bulletin of Information on the Work of International Organisations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bV8oAQAAMAAJ|year=1925|publisher=League of Nations|page=640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1934==
The Sixth Congress took place in [[Krakow]], Poland, September 11–14, 1934.&lt;ref name="Character1935"&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the Sixth International Moral Education Congress, 1934, Krakow, Poland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8f7gHAAACAAJ|year=1935|publisher=Character Research Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly review==
In 2004, Marco Cicchini of the University of Geneva published his study based on a review of the proceedings and publications of the six congresses. He synthesized the congresses' aims and ideals, the theoretical and institutional outlines, the socio-professional profiles of the participants, the status of their contributions, and the disciplines invited to discuss the issues. He also noted on the changes which led to the disappearance of the congress.&lt;ref name=Paedagogica2004&gt;{{cite journal|title=Un bouillon de culture pour les sciences de l'éducation?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7849">The '''Kripke–Platek axioms of set theory''' ('''KP'''), pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|p|k|i|_|ˈ|p|l|ɑː|t|ɛ|k}}, are a system of [[axiomatic set theory]] developed by [[Saul Kripke]] and [[Richard Platek]].

KP is considerably weaker than [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZFC), and can be thought of as roughly the [[impredicativity|predicative]] part of ZFC.  The consistency strength of KP with an axiom of infinity is given by the [[Bachmann–Howard ordinal]]. Unlike ZFC, KP does not include the [[power set axiom]], and KP includes only limited forms of the [[axiom of separation]] and [[axiom of replacement]] from ZFC.  These restrictions on the axioms of KP lead to close connections between KP, [[Mathematical logic#Recursion theory|generalized recursion theory]], and the theory of [[admissible ordinal]]s.

== The axioms of KP ==
* [[Axiom of extensionality]]: Two sets are the same if and only if they have the same elements.
* [[Epsilon-induction|Axiom of induction]]: φ(''a'') being a [[well-formed formula#Predicate logic|formula]], if for all sets ''x'' the assumption that φ(''y'') holds for all elements ''y'' of ''x'' entails that φ(''x'') holds, then φ(''x'') holds for all sets ''x''.
* [[Axiom of empty set]]: There exists a set with no members, called the [[empty set]] and denoted {}.  (Note: the existence of a member in the universe of discourse, i.e., ∃x(x=x), is implied in certain formulations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A course in model theory: an introduction to contemporary mathematical logic |last=Poizat |first=Bruno |year=2000 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-387-98655-3}}, note at end of §2.3 on page 27: &amp;ldquo;Those who do not allow relations on an empty universe consider (∃x)x=x and its consequences as theses; we, however, do not share this abhorrence, with so little logical ground, of a vacuum.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/ref&gt; of first-order logic, in which case the axiom of empty set follows from the axiom of Σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-separation, and is thus redundant.)
* [[Axiom of pairing]]: If ''x'', ''y'' are sets, then so is {''x'', ''y''}, a set containing ''x'' and ''y'' as its only elements.
* [[Axiom of union]]: For any set ''x'', there is a set ''y'' such that the elements of ''y'' are precisely the elements of the elements of ''x''.
* [[Axiom schema of predicative separation|Axiom of Σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-separation]]: Given any set and any Σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-formula φ(''x''), there is a [[subset]] of the original set containing precisely those elements ''x'' for which φ(''x'') holds. (This is an axiom schema.)
* [[Axiom of collection|Axiom of Σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-collection]]: Given any Σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-formula φ(''x'', ''y''), if for every set ''x'' there exists a set ''y'' such that φ(''x'', ''y'') holds, then for all sets ''u'' there exists a set ''v'' such that for every ''x'' in ''u'' there is a ''y'' in ''v'' such that φ(''x'', ''y'') holds.
Here, a Σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, or Π&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, or Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; formula is one all of whose quantifiers are [[bounded quantifier|bounded]]. This means any quantification is the form &lt;math&gt;\forall u \in v&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\exist u \in v.&lt;/math&gt;  (More generally, we would say that a formula is Σ&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; when it is obtained by adding existential quantifiers in front of a Π&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; formula, and that it is Π&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; when it is obtained by adding universal quantifiers in front of a Σ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; formula: this is related to the [[arithmetical hierarchy]] but in the context of set theory.)
*Some but not all authors include an [[axiom of infinity]] (in which case the empty set axiom is unnecessary).

These axioms are weaker than ZFC as they exclude the axioms of powerset, choice, and sometimes infinity.  Also the axioms of separation and collection here are weaker than the corresponding axioms in ZFC because the formulas φ used in these are limited to bounded quantifiers only.

The axiom of induction in KP is stronger than the usual [[axiom of regularity]] (which amounts to applying induction to the complement of a set (the class of all sets not in the given set)).

== Proof that Cartesian products exist ==
'''Theorem:'''

If ''A'' and ''B'' are sets, then there is a set ''A''&amp;times;''B'' which consists of all [[ordered pair]]s (''a'', ''b'') of elements ''a'' of ''A'' and ''b'' of ''B''.

'''Proof:'''

The set {''a''} (which is the same as {''a'', ''a''} by the axiom of extensionality) and the set {''a'', ''b''} both exist by the axiom of pairing. Thus 
:&lt;math&gt;(a,b) := \{ \{a\}, \{a,b\} \} &lt;/math&gt;
exists by the axiom of pairing as well.

A possible Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; formula expressing that ''p'' stands for (''a'', ''b'') is:

:&lt;math&gt;\exist r \in p\, (a \in r\, \land\, \forall x \in r\, (x = a))\, \land\, \exist s \in p\, (a \in s \,\land\, b \in s\, \land\, \forall x \in s\, (x = a \,\lor\, x = b))\, \land\, &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\forall t \in p\, ((a \in t\, \land\, \forall x \in t\, (x = a))\, \lor\, (a \in t \land b \in t \land \forall x \in t\, (x = a \,\lor\, x = b))).&lt;/math&gt;

Thus a superset of ''A''&amp;times;{''b''} = {(''a'', ''b'') | ''a'' in ''A''} exists by the axiom of collection.

Denote the formula for ''p'' above by &lt;math&gt;\psi (a, b, p)&lt;/math&gt;. Then the following formula is also Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\exist a \in A \,\psi (a, b, p) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus ''A''&amp;times;{''b''} itself exists by the axiom of separation.

If ''v'' is intended to stand for ''A''&amp;times;{''b''}, then a Δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; formula expressing that is:

:&lt;math&gt;\forall a \in A\, \exist p \in v\, \psi (a, b, p)\, \land\, \forall p \in v\, \exist a \in A\, \psi (a, b, p) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus a superset of {''A''&amp;times;{''b''} | ''b'' in ''B''} exists by the axiom of collection.

Putting &lt;math&gt;\exist b \in B&lt;/math&gt; in front of that last formula and we get from the axiom of separation that the set {''A''&amp;times;{''b''} | ''b'' in ''B''} itself exists.

Finally, ''A''&amp;times;''B'' = &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt;{''A''&amp;times;{''b''} | ''b'' in ''B''} exists by the axiom of union.

QED

== Admissible sets ==
A set &lt;math&gt; A\, &lt;/math&gt; is called [[admissible set|admissible]] if it is [[transitive set|transitive]] and &lt;math&gt;\langle A,\in \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a [[model theory|model]] of Kripke–Platek set theory.

An [[ordinal number]] α is called an [[admissible ordinal]] if [[constructible universe|L&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;]] is an admissible set.

The ordinal α is an admissible ordinal if and only if α is a limit ordinal and there does not exist a γ&lt;α for which there is a Σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(L&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;) mapping from γ onto α.  If M is a standard model of KP, then the set of ordinals in M is an admissible ordinal.

If L&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is a standard model of KP set theory without the axiom of Σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-collection, then it is said to be an "'''amenable set'''".

{{Hatnote|This article is about the term as used in logic. For the linguistics term, see [[Logical form (linguistics)]].}}
{{Redirect|Argument structure|the possible complements of a verb in linguistics|verb argument}}
In  [[philosophy]] and [[mathematics]], a '''logical form''' of a [[Syntax (logic)|syntactic]] expression is a precisely-specified [[Semantics|semantic]] version of that expression in a [[formal system]]. Informally, the logical form attempts to formalize a possibly [[Ambiguity (syntax)|ambiguous]] statement into a statement with a precise, unambiguous logical interpretation with respect to a formal system. In an ideal [[formal language]], the meaning of a logical form can be determined unambiguously from [[syntax]] alone. Logical forms are semantic, not syntactic constructs; therefore, there may be more than one [[string (computer science)|string]] that represents the same logical form in a given language.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, CUP 1999, pp. 511–512&lt;/ref&gt;

The logical form of an [[argument]] is called the '''argument form''' or ''test form'' of the argument.

==History==
The importance of the concept of form to logic was already recognized in ancient times. [[Aristotle]], in the [[Prior Analytics]], was probably the first to employ variable letters to represent valid inferences. Therefore, [[Jan Łukasiewicz|Łukasiewicz]] claims that the introduction of variables was 'one of Aristotle's greatest inventions'.

According to the followers of Aristotle like [[Ammonius Hermiae|Ammonius]], only the logical principles stated in schematic terms belong to logic, and not those given in concrete terms.  The concrete terms ''man'', ''mortal'', etc., are analogous to the substitution values of the schematic placeholders 'A', 'B', 'C', which were called the 'matter' (Greek ''hyle'', Latin ''materia'') of the argument.

The term "logical form" itself was introduced by [[Bertrand Russell]] in 1914, in the context of his program to formalize natural language and reasoning, which he called [[philosophical logic]]. Russell wrote: "Some kind of knowledge of logical forms, though with most people it is not explicit, is involved in all understanding of discourse. It is the business of philosophical logic to extract this knowledge from its concrete integuments, and to render it explicit and pure."
&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SsY9g_DDA9MC&amp;pg=PA53 Russell, Bertrand. 1914(1993). Our Knowledge of the External World: as a field for scientific method in philosophy. New York: Routledge. p. 53]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PreyerPeter2002"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Gerhard Preyer |editor2=Georg Peter |title=Logical form and language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ioVFUN8yd9QC&amp;pg=PA54 |year=2002 |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=978-0-19-924555-0 |page=54 |chapter=What is logical form? |author=Ernie Lepore |author2=Kirk Ludwig}} [http://www.indiana.edu/~socrates/papers/What%20is%20Logical%20Form.pdf preprint]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example of argument form ==
To demonstrate the important notion of the ''form'' of an argument, substitute letters for similar items throughout the sentences in the original argument.
;Original argument
:All humans are mortal.
:Socrates is human.
:Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
;Argument form
:All ''H'' are ''M''.
:''S'' is ''H''.
:Therefore, ''S'' is ''M''.

All we have done in the ''Argument form'' is to put 'H' for 'human' and 'humans', 'M' for 'mortal', and 'S' for 'Socrates'; what results is the ''form'' of the original argument. Moreover, each individual sentence of the ''Argument form'' is the ''sentence form'' of its respective sentence in the original argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurley|first=Patrick J.|title=A concise introduction to logic|publisher=Wadsworth Pub. Co.|location=Belmont, Calif.|year=1988|isbn=0-534-08928-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance of argument form==
Attention is given to argument and sentence form, because ''form is what makes an argument [[Validity (logic)|valid]] or [[cogency|cogent]]''. All logical form arguments are either inductive or deductive. Inductive logical forms include inductive generalization, statistical arguments, causal argument, and arguments from analogy. Common deductive argument forms are hypothetical syllogism, categorical syllogism, argument by definition, argument based on mathematics, argument from definition. The most reliable forms of logic are [[modus ponens]], [[modus tollens]], and chain arguments because if the premises of the argument are true, then the conclusion necessarily follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Bassham, Gregory | title=Critical thinking : a student's introduction | publication-date=2012 | publisher=McGraw-Hill | edition=5th | isbn=978-0-07-803831-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two invalid argument forms are [[affirming the consequent]] and [[denying the antecedent]]. 

;Affirming the consequent
:All dogs are animals.
:Coco is an animal.
:Therefore, Coco is a dog.

;Denying the antecedent
:All cats are animals.
:Missy is not a cat.
:Therefore, Missy is not an animal.

A logical [[argument]], seen as an [[ordered set]] of sentences, has a logical form that [[compositionality|derives]] from the form of its constituent sentences; the logical form of an argument is sometimes called argument form.&lt;ref name="BeallBeall2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. C. Beall|title=Logic: the Basics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FLnTavNvIqYC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-77498-7|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors only define logical form with respect to whole arguments, as the [[schema (logic)|schemata]] or inferential structure of the argument.&lt;ref name="Tomassi1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Tomassi |title=Logic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUVQr6InyNYC&amp;pg=PA386|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-16696-6|pages=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[argumentation theory]] or [[informal logic]], an argument form is sometimes seen as a broader notion than the logical form.&lt;ref name="Pinto2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert C. Pinto|title=Argument, inference and dialectic: collected papers on informal logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eK0a5CgyV7kC&amp;pg=PA84|year=2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-7005-5|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of stripping out all spurious grammatical features from the sentence (such as gender, and passive forms), and replacing all the expressions specific to ''the subject matter'' of the argument by [[schematic variable]]s.  Thus, for example, the expression 'all A's are B's' shows the logical form which is common to the sentences 'all men are mortals', 'all cats are carnivores', 'all Greeks are philosophers' and so on.

==Logical form in modern logic==

The fundamental difference between modern formal logic and traditional, or Aristotelian logic, lies in their differing analysis of the logical form of the sentences they treat:  
*On the traditional view, the form of the sentence consists of (1) a subject (e.g., "man") plus a sign of quantity ("all" or "some" or "no"); (2) the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]], which is of the form "is" or "is not"; (3) a predicate (e.g., "mortal"). Thus: 'all men are mortal'. The logical constants such as "all", "no" and so on, plus sentential connectives such as "and" and "or" were called [[syncategorematic]] terms (from the Greek ''kategorei'' – to predicate, and ''syn'' – together with). This is a fixed scheme, where each judgment has a specific quantity and copula, determining the logical form of the sentence. 
*The modern view is more complex, since a single judgement of Aristotle's system involves two or more logical connectives. For example, the sentence "All men are mortal" involves, in term logic, two non-logical terms "is a man" (here ''M'') and "is mortal" (here ''D''): the sentence is given by the judgement ''A(M,D)''. In [[predicate logic]], the sentence involves the same two non-logical concepts, here analyzed as &lt;math&gt;m(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and the sentence is given by &lt;math&gt;\forall x. (m(x) \rightarrow d(x))&lt;/math&gt;, involving the logical connectives for [[universal quantification]] and [[material conditional|implication]]. 

The more complex modern view comes with more power. On the modern view, the fundamental form of a simple sentence is given by a recursive schema, like natural language and involving [[logical connective]]s, which are joined by juxtaposition to other sentences, which in turn may have logical structure. Medieval logicians recognized the [[problem of multiple generality]], where Aristotelian logic is unable to satisfactorily render such sentences as "Some guys have all the luck", because both quantities "all" and "some" may be relevant in an inference, but the fixed scheme that Aristotle used allows only one to govern the inference. Just as linguists recognize recursive structure in natural languages, it appears that logic needs recursive structure.

The '''Movable cellular automaton (MCA)''' method is a method in [[Computational mechanics|computational solid mechanics]] based on the discrete concept. It provides advantages both of classical [[cellular automaton]] and [[discrete element method|discrete element]] methods. Important advantage of the МСА method is a possibility of direct [[Computer simulation|simulation]] of materials fracture including damage generation, crack propagation, fragmentation and mass mixing. It is difficult to simulate these processes by means of [[continuum mechanics]] methods (For example: [[finite element method]], [[finite difference method]], etc.), so some new concepts like [[peridynamics]] are required. [[Discrete element method]] is very effective to simulate granular materials, but mutual forces among movable cellular automata provides simulating solids behavior. If size of automaton will be close to zero then MCA behavior becomes like classical [[continuum mechanics]] methods.

==Keystone of the movable cellular automaton method==

[[File:MCA elements.png|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Object (at left) is described as set of interacted automata (at center). At right is shown velocity field of automata.&lt;/center&gt;]]
In framework of the '''MCA''' approach an object under modeling is considered as a set of interacting elements/automata. The dynamics of the set of automata are defined by their mutual forces and rules for their relationships. This system exists and operates in time and space. Its evolution in time and space is governed by the equations of motion. The mutual forces and rules for inter-elements relationships are defined by the function of the automaton response. This function has to be specified for each automaton. Due to mobility of automata the following new parameters of cellular automata have to be included into consideration: ''R&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' &amp;ndash; radius-vector of automaton; ''V&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' &amp;ndash; velocity of automaton; '''ω&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''' &amp;ndash; rotation velocity of automaton; ''θ&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' &amp;ndash; rotation vector of automaton; ''m&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' &amp;ndash; mass of automaton; ''J&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' &amp;ndash; moment of inertia of automaton.

==New concept: neighbours==

[[File:MCA neighbors.gif|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Each automaton has some neighbors&lt;/center&gt;]]
The new concept of the MCA method is based on the introducing of the '''state of the pair of automata''' (relation of interacting pairs of automata) in addition to the conventional one &amp;ndash; the state of a separate automaton. Note that the introduction of this definition allows to go from the static net concept to the '''concept of neighbours'''. As a result of this, the automata have the ability to change their neighbors by switching the states (relationships) of the pairs.

==Definition of the parameter of pair state==

The introducing of new type of states leads to new parameter to use it as criteria for '''switching relationships'''.  It is defined as an automaton overlapping parameters&amp;nbsp;''h&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt;''. So the relationship of the cellular automata is characterised by the value of their '''overlapping'''.

[[File:MCA sh1.gif]] [[File:MCA sh2.gif]]

The initial structure is formed by setting up certain relationships among each pair of neighboring elements.

==Criterion of switching of the state of pair relationships==

[[File:MCA switch.gif|thumb|&lt;center&gt;At left pair of automata ij is linked. At right pair of automata ij is unlinked.&lt;/center&gt;]]
In contrast to the classical cellular automaton method in the MCA method not only a single automaton but also a '''relationship of pair of automata can be switched'''. According with the bistable automata concept there are two types of the pair states (relationships):
    
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
| '''linked'''
| – both automata belong to a solid
|-
| '''unlinked'''
| – each automaton of the pair belongs to different bodies or parts of damaged body.
|}

So the '''changing of the state of pair relationships''' is controlled by relative movements of the automata and the media formed by such pairs can be considered as bistable media.

==Equations of MCA motion==

The evolution of MCA media is described by the following '''equations of motion for translation''':

:&lt;math&gt;{d^2 h^{ij} \over dt^2} = \left( {1 \over m^i} + {1 \over m^j} \right) p^{ij} + \sum_{k\neq j} C(ij,ik) \psi(\alpha_{ij,ik}) {1 \over m^i} p^{ik} + \sum_{l \neq i} C(ij,jl) \psi(\alpha_{ij,jl}) {1 \over m^j} p^{jl}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:MCA neighbour in pair.png|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Forces between automata ij coming from their neighbors.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Here m&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; is the mass of automaton i, p&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt; is central force acting between automata i and j, C(ij,ik) is certain coefficient associated with transferring the h parameter from pair '''ij''' to pair '''ik''', ψ(α&lt;sub&gt;ij,ik&lt;/sub&gt;) is angle between directions '''ij''' and '''ik'''.

Due to finite size of movable automata the rotation effects have to be taken into account. The '''equations of motion for rotation''' can be written as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;{d^2 \theta^{ij} \over dt^2} = \left( {q^{ij} \over J^i} + {q^{ji} \over J^j} \right) \tau^{ij} + \sum_{k\neq j} S(ij,ik) {q^{ik} \over J^i} \tau^{ik} + \sum_{l\neq j} S(ij,jl) {q^{jl} \over J^j} \tau^{jl}&lt;/math&gt;

Here Θ&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt; is the angle of relative rotation (it is a switching parameter like h&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt; for translation), q&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt; is the distance from center of automaton '''i''' to contact point of automaton '''j''' (moment arm), τ&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt; is the pair tangential interaction, S(ij,ik) is certain coefficient associated with transferring the  Θ parameter from one pair to other (it is similar to C(ij,ik) from the equation for translation).

It should be noted that these equations are completely similar to the equations of motion for the many&amp;ndash;particle approach.

==Definition of deformation in pair of automata==

[[File:Deformation_in_movable_cellular_automatation.svg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Rotation of body as whole not caused to deformation in pair of automata&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Translation of the pair automata'''
The dimensionless deformation parameter for translation of the '''i j''' automata pair can be presented as:

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon^{ij} = {h^{ij} \over r_{0}^{ij}} = { \left( q^{ij} + q^{ji} \right) - \left( d^{i} + d^{j} \right) \big / 2 \over \left( d^{i} + d^{j} \right) \big / 2 }&lt;/math&gt;

In this case:

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \Delta{\varepsilon^{i(j)}} + \Delta{\varepsilon^{j(i)}} \right)  
{ \left( d^{i} + d^{j} \right) \over 2} = V_{n}^{ij} \Delta{t}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''Δt''' time step, '''V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt;''' &amp;ndash; relative velocity.

Rotation of the pair automata can be calculated by analogy with the last translation relationships.

==Modeling of irreversible deformation in the MCA method==

[[File:MCA Irreversible Deformation.gif|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Deformation is determine by value of distance from the center of automaton&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:MCA response function of automata.gif|thumb|&lt;center&gt;There are two types of the response function of automata&lt;/center&gt;]]

The '''ε&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt;''' parameter is used as a measure of deformation of automaton '''i''' under its interaction with automaton '''j'''. Where '''q&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt;''' &amp;ndash; is a distance from the center of automaton '''i''' to its contact point with automaton '''j''';  '''R&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; = d&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;/2''' ('''d&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''' &amp;ndash; is the size of automaton '''i''').

'''As an example''' the titanium specimen under cyclic loading (tension &amp;ndash; compression) is considered. The loading diagram is shown in the next figure:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"

==Advantages of MCA method==

Due to mobility of each automaton the MCA method allows to take into account directly such actions as:

* mass mixing
* penetration effects
* chemical reactions
* intensive deformation
* phase transformations
* accumulation of damages
* fragmentation and fracture
* cracks generation and development

Using boundary conditions of different types (fixed, elastic, viscous-elastic, etc.) it is possible to imitate different properties of surrounding medium, containing the simulated system. It is possible to model different modes of mechanical loading (tension, compression, shear strain, etc.) by setting up additional conditions at the boundaries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="972">'''Mundane Reason''' is a book by Melvin Pollner.

==Meaning==
The basic [[premise]] of the concept of '''mundane reason''' is that the standard assumptions about reality that people typically make as they go about day to day, including the very fact that they experience their reality as perfectly natural, are actually the result of social, cultural, and historical processes that make a particular perception of the world readily available. It is the reasoning about the world, self, and others which presupposes the world and its relationship to the observer; according to [[Steven Shapin]] (Shapin 1994:31), it is a set of presuppositions about the subject, the object, and the nature of their relations.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin, S. 1994, ''A Social History of Truth: Civility and Science in Seventeenth-Century England'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4700">'''NO!art''' is a radical [[avant-garde]] [[anti-art]] movement started in New York in 1959. Its founders sought to deliver a shock to the complacent consumerist society around them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1572298 ''NO-Art: An American Psycho-Social Phenomenon''] Emanuel K. Schwartz and Reta Shacknove Schwartz, Leonardo, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Summer, 1971), pp. 245-254 MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement was initiated by [[Boris Lurie]], Sam Goodman and Stanley Fisher who had come together to organise exhibitions at the March Gallery. They gave the name NO!Art to the movement on the occasion of their show at the Gallery Gertrude Stein. They set themselves against the contemporary trends in [[Abstract Expressionism]] and [[Pop Art]] in art, and used their work to attack fascism, racism and imperialism in politics. 

The NO!art exhibitions bore titles such as the Doom Show, the Involvement Show, the No Show and the Vulgar Show. They were often scatological in theme with one exhibition, the 1964 No Sculptures/Shit Show featuring works resembling piles of excrement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ep.tc/realist/54/15.html "Look--Ma ... No Sculpture"], ''The Realist'', November 1964&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Holocaust]] was another recurrent theme and the artists sometime provocatively referred to their work as "Jew Art."&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Robert [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xkc87BoYoekC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=Sam+Goodman+and+Stanley+Fisher+no&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1HWgGNSysd&amp;sig=3Dqqd5m2qGu5-CqpD2rGRFYd8to&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KwVTTLb7IZOk4QaS843BAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=no!art&amp;f=false ''Beyond resistance: the future of freedom'' p.31]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parametrization''' (or '''parameterization'''; also '''parameterisation''', '''parametrisation''') is the process of finding [[parametric equation]]s of a [[curve]], a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]], or, more generally, a [[manifold]] or a [[algebraic variety|variety]], defined by an [[implicit equation]]. The inverse process is called [[implicitization]].&lt;ref name="hughes"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/828768012|title=Calculus : Single and multivariable.|last=Hughes-Hallet|first=Deborah|last2=McCallum|first2=William G.|last3=Gleason|first3=Andrew M.|date=2012-01-01|publisher=John wiley|year=|isbn=9780470888612|location=|pages=780|oclc=828768012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "To parameterize" by itself means "to express in terms of [[parameter]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/parameterize|title=Definition of PARAMETERIZE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parametrization is a [[mathematical]] process consisting of expressing the state of a [[system]], [[process (science)|process]] or model as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of some independent quantities called [[parameter]]s. The state of the system is generally determined by a finite set of [[coordinate]]s, and the parametrization consists thus of one [[function of several real variables]] for each coordinate. The number of parameters is the number of [[degrees of freedom]] of the system.

For example, the position of a [[point (geometry)|point]] that moves on a [[curve (geometry)|curve]] in the [[three-dimensional space]] is determined by the time needed to reach the point when starting from a fixed origin. If {{math|''x'', ''y'', ''z''}} are the coordinates of the point, the movement is thus described by a parametric equation &lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x&amp;=f(t)\\y&amp;=g(t)\\z&amp;=h(t),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''t''}} denotes the time. Such a parametric equation determines completely the curve, without the need of any interpretation of {{math|''t''}} as a time, and is thus called a ''parametric equation'' of the curve (this is sometimes abbreviated by saying that one has a ''parametric curve''). One gets similarly the parametric equation of a surface by considering functions of two parameters {{math|''t''}} and {{math|''u''}}.

== Non-uniqueness ==
Parametrizations are not generally [[unique (mathematics)|unique]]. The ordinary [[three-dimensional]] object can be parametrized (or 'coordinatized') equally efficiently with [[Cartesian coordinate]]s (x,y,z), [[cylindrical polar coordinates]] ([[Radial distance (geometry)|ρ]], [[Azimuth|φ]], [[Signed distance function|z]]), [[spherical coordinate]]s ([[Radial distance (geometry)|r]],φ,θ) or other [[coordinate system]]s.

Similarly, the color space of human [[Trichromacy|trichromatic color vision]] can be parametrized in terms of the three colors red, green and blue, [[RGB]], or with cyan, magenta, yellow and black, [[CMYK]].

== Dimensionality ==
Generally, the minimum number of parameters required to describe a model or geometric object is equal to its [[dimension]], and the scope of the parameters—within their allowed ranges—is the [[parameter space]]. Though a good set of parameters permits identification of every point in the parameter space, it may be that, for a given parametrization, different parameter values can refer to the same 'physical' point. Such mappings are [[surjective]] but not [[injective]]. An example is the pair of cylindrical polar coordinates (ρ,φ,z) and (ρ,φ + 2π,z).

== Parametrization invariance ==
As indicated above, there is arbitrariness in the choice of parameters of a given model, geometric object, etc. Often, one wishes to determine intrinsic properties of an object that do not depend on this arbitrariness, which are therefore independent of any particular choice of parameters. This is particularly the case in physics, wherein parametrization [[Invariant (physics)|invariance]] (or 'reparametrization invariance') is a guiding principle in the search for [[physical theory|physically acceptable theories]] (particularly in [[general relativity]]).

For example, whilst the location of a fixed point on some curved line may be given by a set of numbers whose values depend on how the curve is parametrized, the [[length]] (appropriately defined) of the curve between ''two'' such fixed points will be independent of the particular choice of parametrization (in this case: the method by which an arbitrary point on the line is uniquely indexed). The length of the curve is therefore a parameterization-invariant quantity. In such cases parameterization is a mathematical tool employed to extract a result whose value does not depend on, or make reference to, the details of the parameterization. More generally, parametrization invariance of a physical theory implies that either the [[dimension]]ality or the volume of the parameter space is larger than is necessary to describe the physics (the quantities of physical significance) in question.

Though the theory of [[general relativity]] can be expressed without reference to a coordinate system, calculations of physical (i.e. observable) quantities such as the curvature of [[spacetime]] invariably involve the introduction of a particular coordinate system in order to refer to spacetime points involved in the calculation. In the context of general relativity then, the choice of coordinate system may be regarded as a method of 'parameterizing' the spacetime, and the insensitivity of the result of a calculation of a physically-significant quantity to that choice can be regarded as an example of parameterization invariance.

As another example, physical theories whose observable quantities depend only on the ''relative'' distances (the ratio of distances) between pairs of objects are said to be [[scale invariant]]. In such theories any reference in the course of a calculation to an absolute distance would imply the introduction of a parameter to which the theory is invariant.

'''Personality psychology''' is a branch of [[psychology]] that studies [[personality]] and its variation among [[individual]]s. It is a scientific study which aims to show how people are individually different due to psychological forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality: Classic theories and modern research|last=Friedman|first=Howard|last2=Schustack|first2=Miriam|publisher=USA: Pearson|year=2016|isbn=978-0-205-99793-0|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its areas of focus include:

* construction of a coherent picture of the [[person|individual]] and their major psychological processes
* investigation of individual psychological differences
* investigation of [[human nature]] and psychological similarities between individuals

"Personality" is a dynamic{{clarify|date=October 2016}} and organized set of characteristics possessed by a person that uniquely{{clarify|date=October 2016}} influences their environment, [[cognition]]s, [[emotion]]s, [[motivation]]s, and [[Behavioural sciences|behaviors]] in various situations. The word ''personality'' originates from the [[Latin]] ''persona'', which means "[[mask]]".

Personality also refers to the pattern of [[thought]]s, [[feeling]]s, [[Adjustment (psychology)|social adjustments]], and [[behavior]]s consistently exhibited over time that strongly influences one's expectations, [[Self-concept|self-perceptions]], [[Value (ethics)|value]]s, and [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s. Personality also predicts human reactions to other people, problems, and [[Stress (biology)|stress]].&lt;ref name = Winnie&gt;Winnie, J.F. &amp; Gittinger, J.W. (1973) An introduction to the personality assessment system. ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, Monograph Supplement, 38,1=68''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krauskopf, C.J. &amp; Saunders, D.R, (1994) Personality and Ability: The Personality Assessment System. University Press of America, Lanham, Maryland&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Allport]] (1937) described two major ways to study personality: the nomothetic and the [[Idiographic image|idiographic]]. ''Nomothetic psychology'' seeks general laws that can be applied to many different people, such as the principle of [[self-actualization]] or the trait of [[Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]]. ''Idiographic psychology'' is an attempt to understand the unique aspects of a particular individual.

The study of [[personality]] has a broad and varied history in psychology with an abundance of theoretical trad. The major theories include dispositional (trait) perspective, psychodynamic, humanistic, biological, behaviorist, evolutionary, and social learning perspective. However, many researchers and psychologists do not explicitly identify themselves with a certain perspective and instead take an eclectic approach. Research in this area is empirically driven, such as dimensional models, based on [[multivariate statistics]], such as [[factor analysis]], or emphasizes theory development, such as that of the [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] theory. There is also a substantial emphasis on the applied field of personality testing. In psychological education and training, the study of the nature of personality and its psychological development is usually reviewed as a prerequisite to courses in [[abnormal psychology]] or [[clinical psychology]].

==Philosophical assumptions==
Many of the ideas developed by historical and modern [[personality]] theorists stem from the basic philosophical assumptions they hold. The study of personality is not a purely empirical discipline, as it brings in elements of [[art]], [[science]], and [[philosophy]] to draw general conclusions. The following five categories are some of the most fundamental philosophical assumptions on which theorists disagree:&lt;ref name=Engler&gt;{{cite book|last=Engler|first=Barbara|title=Personality theories : an introduction|year=2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9780547148342|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Freedom versus determinism''' – This is the question whether humans have control over their own behavior and understand the motives behind it or if their behavior is causally determined by forces beyond their control. Behavior is categorized as being either unconscious, environmental or biological by various theories.&lt;ref name=Engler /&gt;
* '''Heredity versus environment''' – Personality is thought to be determined largely either by [[genetics]] and [[biology]], or by environment and experiences. Contemporary research suggests that most personality traits are based on the joint influence of genetics and environment. One of the forerunners in this arena is [[C. Robert Cloninger]], who pioneered the Temperament and Character model.&lt;ref name=Engler /&gt;
* '''Uniqueness versus universality''' – This question discusses the extent of each human's individuality ([[uniqueness]]) or similarity in nature ([[Universality (philosophy)|universality]]). [[Gordon Allport]], [[Abraham Maslow]], and [[Carl Rogers]] were all advocates of the uniqueness of individuals. Behaviorists and cognitive theorists, in contrast, emphasize the importance of universal principles, such as reinforcement and self-efficacy.&lt;ref name=Engler /&gt;
* '''Active versus reactive''' – This question explores whether humans primarily act through individual initiative (active) or through outside [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. Traditional behavioral theorists typically believed that humans are passively shaped by their environments, whereas humanistic and cognitive theorists believe that humans are more active in their role.&lt;ref name=Engler /&gt; Most modern theorists agree that both are important, with aggregate behavior being primarily determined by traits and situational factors being the primary predictor of behavior in the short term.&lt;ref name = person_situation&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fleeson | first1 = W. | year = 2004 | title = Moving personality beyond the person-situation debate: The challenge and the opportunity of within-person variability | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 83–87 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00280.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zayas|first=V|author2=Shoda Y|title=Three decades after the personality paradox: Understanding situations|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|year=2009|volume=43|pages=280–281|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2009.03.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tapu|first=C.S.|title=Hypostatic personality: psychopathology of doing and being made|year=2001|publisher=Premier|isbn=9738030595|pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Optimistic versus pessimistic''' – Personality theories differ with regard to whether humans are integral in the changing of their own personalities. Theories that place a great deal of emphasis on learning are often more optimistic than those that do not.&lt;ref name=Engler /&gt;

== Personality theories ==

=== Type theories ===
[[Personality type]] refers to the psychological classification of different types of people. Personality types are distinguished from [[trait theory|personality traits]], which come in different degrees. There are many types of theories regarding personality, but each theory contains several and sometimes many sub theories. A "theory of personality" constructed by any given psychologist will contain multiple relating theories or sub theories often expanding as more psychologists explore the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cartwright |first1=Desmond |title=Theories and Models of Personality |date=1979 |publisher=Wm. C. Brown Company Publishers |location=Debuque, Iowa |isbn=0-697-06624-X |page=178 |edition=I |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to type theories, there are two types of people, introverts and extroverts. According to trait theories, introversion and extroversion are part of a continuous dimension with many people in the middle. The idea of psychological types originated in the theoretical work of [[Carl Jung]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharp |first=Daryl |title= Personality types: Jung's model of typology |year=1987 |publisher=Inner City Books |location= Toronto, Canada |isbn= 0919123309|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically in his 1921 book ''Psychologische Typen'' (''[[Psychological Types]]'')  and [[William Moulton Marston|William Marston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradberry|first=T|title=Self-Awareness|year=2009|publisher=Penguin|isbn=1101148675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on the writings and observations of Jung during World War II, [[Isabel Briggs Myers]] and her mother, Katharine C. Briggs, delineated personality types by constructing the [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator]].&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite book |author=Myers, Isabel Briggs with Peter B. Myers|title=Gifts Differing: Understanding Personality Type |publisher=Davies-Black Publishing |location=Mountain View, California |origyear=1980|year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-89106-074-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model was later used by [[David Keirsey]] with a different understanding from Jung, Briggs and Myers.&lt;ref name=K123123123123123&gt;{{cite book |date= May 1, 1998 |title=Please Understand Me II: Temperament, Character, Intelligence |publisher=Prometheus Nemesis Book Co|edition=1st |isbn=1-885705-02-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the former Soviet Union, [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] [[Aušra Augustinavičiūtė]] independently derived a model of personality type from Jung's called [[socionics]].

Theories could also be considered an "approach" to personality or psychology and is generally referred to as a model.  The model is an older and more theoretical approach to personality, accepting extroversion and introversion as basic psychological orientations in connection with two pairs of psychological functions:

* ''Perceiving functions:'' sensing and intuition (trust in concrete, sensory-oriented facts vs. trust in abstract concepts and imagined possibilities)
* ''Judging functions:'' thinking and feeling (basing decisions primarily on logic vs. deciding based on emotion).

Briggs and Myers also added another personality dimension to their type indicator to measure whether a person prefers to use a judging or perceiving function when interacting with the external world.  Therefore, they included questions designed to indicate whether someone wishes to come to conclusions (judgment) or to keep options open (perception).&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt;

This personality typology has some aspects of a trait theory: it explains people's behavior in terms of opposite fixed characteristics.  In these more traditional models, the sensing/intuition preference is considered the most basic, dividing people into "N" (intuitive) or "S" (sensing) personality types. An "N" is further assumed to be guided either by thinking or feeling and divided into the "NT" (scientist, engineer) or "NF" (author, humanitarian) temperament. An "S", in contrast, is assumed to be guided more by the judgment/perception axis and thus divided into the "SJ" (guardian, traditionalist) or "SP" (performer, artisan) temperament.&lt;!-- remark out undefined &lt;ref name=Keirsey/&gt; --&gt; These four are considered basic, with the other two factors in each case (including always extraversion/introversion) less important. Critics of this traditional view have observed that the types can be quite strongly stereotyped by professions (although neither Myers nor Keirsey engaged in such stereotyping in their type descriptions),&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt;&lt;!-- remark out undefined ref &lt;ref name=Keirsey/&gt; --&gt; and thus may arise more from the need to categorize people for purposes of guiding their career choice.&lt;ref name=Pittenger&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pittenger | first = David J. | title = Measuring the MBTI. . .And Coming Up Short | journal = Journal of Career Planning and Employment | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 48–52 |date=November 1993 | url = http://www.indiana.edu/~jobtalk/HRMWebsite/hrm/articles/develop/mbti.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This among other objections led to the emergence of the five-factor view, which is less concerned with behavior under work conditions and more concerned with behavior in personal and emotional circumstances.  (It should be noted, however, that the MBTI is not designed to measure the "work self", but rather what Myers and McCaulley called the "shoes-off self."&lt;ref name=manual_2&gt;{{cite book|last=Myers|first=Isabel Briggs|author2=Mary H. McCaulley|title=Manual: A Guide to the Development and Use of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator|publisher=Consulting Psychologists Press|location=Palo Alto, California|year=1985|edition=2nd|page=8|isbn=0-89106-027-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[Type A and Type B personality theory]]:  During the 1950s, [[Meyer Friedman]] and his co-workers defined what they called Type A and Type B behavior patterns. They theorized that intense, hard-driving Type A personalities had a higher risk of coronary disease because they are "stress junkies." Type B people, on the other hand, tended to be relaxed, less competitive, and lower in risk. There was also a Type AB mixed profile.

[[John L. Holland]]'s ''RIASEC'' vocational model, commonly referred to as the ''[[Holland Codes]]'', stipulates that six personality types lead people to choose their career paths. In this circumplex model, the six types are represented as a hexagon, with adjacent types more closely related than those more distant. The model is widely used in vocational counseling.

[[Eduard Spranger]]'s personality-model, consisting of six (or, by some revisions, 6 +1) basic types of ''value attitudes'', described in his book ''Types of Men'' (''Lebensformen''; Halle (Saale): Niemeyer, 1914; English translation by P. J. W. Pigors - New York: G. E. Stechert Company, 1928).

The [[Enneagram of Personality]], a model of human personality which is principally used as a typology of nine interconnected personality types. It has been criticized as being subject to interpretation, making it difficult to test or validate scientifically.

Perhaps the most ancient attempt at personality psychology is the [[Buddhist personality types|personality typology]] outlined by the Indian [[Buddhist]] [[Abhidharma]] schools. This typology mostly focuses on negative personal traits (greed, hatred, and delusion) and the corresponding positive [[meditation]] practices used to counter those traits.

=== Psychoanalytic theories ===

[[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalytic]] theories explain human behavior in terms of the interaction of various components of personality. [[Sigmund Freud]] was the founder of this school of thought. Freud drew on the physics of his day (thermodynamics) to coin the term [[psychodynamics]]. Based on the idea of converting heat into mechanical energy, he proposed psychic energy could be converted into behavior. Freud's theory places central importance on dynamic, unconscious psychological conflicts.&lt;ref name=Kahn&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahn|first=Michael|title=Basic Freud : psychoanalytic thought for the twenty first century|year=2002|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465037162|edition=1. paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud divides human personality into three significant components: the [[id, ego and super-ego]].  The '''id''' acts according to the ''pleasure principle'', demanding immediate gratification of its needs regardless of external environment; the '''ego''' then must emerge in order to realistically meet the wishes and demands of the id in accordance with the outside world, adhering to the ''reality principle''. Finally, the '''superego''' (conscience) inculcates moral judgment and societal rules upon the ego, thus forcing the demands of the id to be met not only realistically but morally. The superego is the last function of the personality to develop, and is the embodiment of parental/social ideals established during childhood. According to Freud, personality is based on the dynamic interactions of these three components.&lt;ref name="Carver"&gt;Carver, C., &amp; Scheier, M. (2004). ''Perspectives on Personality'' (5th ed.). Boston: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

The channeling and release of sexual (libidal) and aggressive energies, which ensues from the "Eros" (sex; instinctual self-preservation) and "Thanatos" (death; instinctual self-annihilation) drives respectively, are major components of his theory.&lt;ref name="Carver" /&gt;  It is important to note that Freud's broad understanding of sexuality included all kinds of pleasurable feelings experienced by the human body.

Freud proposed five psychosexual stages of personality development. He believed adult personality is dependent upon early childhood experiences and largely determined by age five.&lt;ref name="Carver" /&gt;  Fixations that develop during the infantile stage contribute to adult personality and behavior.

One of Sigmund Freud's earlier associates, [[Alfred Adler]], did agree with Freud that early childhood experiences are important to development and believed birth order may influence personality development. Adler believed that the oldest child was the individual who would set high achievement goals in order to gain attention lost when the younger siblings were born. He believed the middle children were competitive and ambitious.  He reasoned that this behavior was motivated by the idea of surpassing the firstborn's achievements.   He added, however, that the middle children were often not as concerned about the glory attributed with their behavior. He also believed the youngest would be more dependent and sociable. Adler finished by surmising that an only child loves being the center of attention and matures quickly but in the end fails to become independent.

[[Heinz Kohut]] thought similarly to Freud's idea of transference. He used [[narcissism]] as a model of how people develop their sense of self. Narcissism is the exaggerated sense of one self in which one is believed to exist in order to protect one's low self-esteem and sense of worthlessness. Kohut had a significant impact on the field by extending Freud's theory of narcissism and introducing what he called the 'self-object transferences' of mirroring and idealization. In other words, children need to idealize and emotionally "sink into" and identify with the idealized competence of admired figures such as parents or older siblings. They also need to have their self-worth mirrored by these people. These experiences allow them to thereby learn the self-soothing and other skills that are necessary for the development of a healthy sense of self.

Another important figure in the world of personality theory is [[Karen Horney]]. She is credited with the development of the "[[True self and false self|real self]]" and the "ideal self". She believes all people have these two views of their own self. The "real self" is how humans act with regard to personality, values, and morals; but the "ideal self" is a construct individuals implement in order to conform to social and personal norms.

=== Behaviorist theories ===

[[Behaviorism|Behaviorists]] explain personality in terms of the effects external stimuli have on behavior.  The approaches used to analyze the behavioral aspect of personality are known as behavioral theories or learning-conditioning theories. These approaches were a radical shift away from Freudian philosophy. One of the major tenets of this concentration of personality psychology is a strong emphasis on scientific thinking and experimentation.  This school of thought was developed by [[B. F. Skinner]] who put forth a model which emphasized the mutual interaction of the person or "the organism" with its environment.  Skinner believed children do bad things because the behavior obtains attention that serves as a reinforcer. For example: a child cries because the child's crying in the past has led to attention.  These are the ''response'', and ''consequences''.  The response is the child crying, and the attention that child gets is the reinforcing consequence. According to this theory, people's behavior is formed by processes such as [[operant conditioning]].  Skinner put forward a "three term contingency model" which helped promote analysis of behavior based on the "Stimulus - Response - Consequence Model" in which the critical question is: "Under which circumstances or antecedent 'stimuli' does the organism engage in a particular behavior or 'response', which in turn produces a particular 'consequence'?"&lt;ref name=Cheney&gt;{{cite book|last=Cheney|first=W. David Pierce, Carl D.|title=Behavior analysis and learning|year=2008|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780805862607|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Herrnstein]] extended this theory by accounting for attitudes and traits.  An attitude develops as the response strength (the tendency to respond) in the presences of a group of stimuli become stable.  Rather than describing conditionable traits in non-behavioral language, response strength in a given situation accounts for the environmental portion.  Herrstein also saw traits as having a large genetic or biological component, as do most modern behaviorists.&lt;ref name=Cheney /&gt;

[[Ivan Pavlov]] is another notable influence. He is well known for his [[classical conditioning]] experiments involving dogs, which led him to discover the foundation of behaviorism.&lt;ref name=Cheney /&gt;

=== Social cognitive theories ===

In cognitive theory, behavior is explained as guided by cognitions (e.g. expectations) about the world, especially those about other people. Cognitive theories are theories of personality that emphasize cognitive processes, such as thinking and judging.

[[Albert Bandura]], a [[social learning theory|social learning theorist]] suggested the forces of [[memory]] and [[emotion]]s worked in conjunction with environmental influences. Bandura was known mostly for his "[[Bobo doll experiment]]". During these experiments, Bandura video taped a college student kicking and verbally abusing a bobo doll. He then showed this video to a class of kindergarten children who were getting ready to go out to play. When they entered the play room, they saw bobo dolls, and some hammers. The people observing these children at play saw a group of children beating the doll. He called this study and his findings observational learning, or modeling.

Early examples of approaches to cognitive style are listed by Baron (1982).&lt;ref&gt;Baron, J. (1982). "Intelligence and Personality." In R. Sternberg (Ed.). ''Handbook of Intelligence''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These include Witkin's (1965) work on field dependency, Gardner's (1953) discovering people had consistent preference for the number of categories they used to categorise heterogeneous objects, and Block and Petersen's (1955) work on confidence in line discrimination judgments. Baron relates early development of cognitive approaches of personality to [[ego psychology]]. More central to this field have been:

* [[Explanatory style|Attributional style theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abramson |first1=Lyn Y. |last2=Seligman |first2=Martin E. P. |last3=Teasdale |first3=John D. |date=1978 |title=Learned helplessness in humans: Critique and reformulation |journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=49–74 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.87.1.49 |pmid=649856 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with different ways in which people explain events in their lives. This approach builds upon locus of control, but extends it by stating we also need to consider whether people attribute to stable causes or variable causes, and to global causes or specific causes.

Various scales have been developed to assess both attributional style and locus of control. Locus of control scales include those used by Rotter and later by Duttweiler, the Nowicki and Strickland (1973) Locus of Control Scale for Children and various locus of control scales specifically in the health domain, most famously that of Kenneth Wallston and his colleagues, The Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale.&lt;ref&gt;Wallston et al., 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Attributional style has been assessed by the Attributional Style Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;Peterson et al., 1982&lt;/ref&gt; the Expanded Attributional Style Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Villanova, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; the Attributions Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;Gong-guy &amp; Hammen,  1990&lt;/ref&gt; the Real Events Attributional Style Questionnaire&lt;ref&gt;Norman &amp; Antaki, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and the Attributional Style Assessment Test.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

* Achievement style theory focuses upon identification of an individual's Locus of Control tendency, such as by Rotter's evaluations, and was found by Cassandra Bolyard Whyte to provide valuable information for improving academic performance of students.&lt;ref name="Whyte1978"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Whyte |first=Cassandra Bolyard |year=1978 |title=Effective Counseling Methods for High-Risk College Freshmen |journal=Measurement and Evaluation in Guidance |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=198–200 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with internal control tendencies are likely to persist to better academic performance levels, presenting an achievement personality, according to [[Cassandra B. Whyte]].&lt;ref name="Whyte1978" /&gt;

Recognition that the tendency to believe that hard work and persistence often results in attainment of life and academic goals has influenced formal educational and counseling efforts with students of various ages and in various settings since the 1970s research about achievement.&lt;ref name="LauridsenKurt"&gt;Lauridsen Kurt (ed) and Whyte, Cassandra B. (1985) An Integrated Counseling and Learning Assistance Center-Chapter for New Directions Sourcebook. Jossey-Bass, Inc&lt;/ref&gt; Counseling aimed toward encouraging individuals to design ambitious goals and work toward them, with recognition that there are external factors that may impact, often results in the incorporation of a more positive achievement style by students and employees, whatever the setting, to include higher education, workplace, or justice programming.&lt;ref name="LauridsenKurt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whyte | first1 = Cassandra | last2 = Whyte | first2 = William R. | year = 1982 | title = Accelerated Programs Behind Prison Walls | url = | journal = College Student Journal | volume = 16 | issue = 1| pages = 70–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Mischel]] (1999) has also defended a cognitive approach to personality. His work refers to "Cognitive Affective Units", and considers factors such as encoding of stimuli, affect, goal-setting, and self-regulatory beliefs. The term "Cognitive Affective Units" shows how his approach considers affect as well as cognition.

[[Cognitive-Experiential Self-Theory]] (CEST) is another cognitive personality theory.  Developed by Seymour Epstein, CEST argues that humans operate by way of two independent information processing systems: experiential system and rational system.  The experiential system is fast and emotion-driven.  The rational system is slow and logic-driven.  These two systems interact to determine our goals, thoughts, and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Seymour; In: Handbook of psychology: Personality and social psychology, Vol. 5. Millon, Theodore (Ed.); Lerner, Melvin J. (Ed.); Hoboken, NJ, US: John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, 2003. pp. 159-184. [Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Personal construct theory|Personal construct psychology]] (PCP) is a theory of personality developed by the American psychologist [[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly]] in the 1950s. Kelly's fundamental view of personality was that people are like naive scientists who see the world through a particular lens, based on their uniquely organized systems of construction, which they use to anticipate events. But because people are naive scientists, they sometimes employ systems for construing the world that are distorted by idiosyncratic experiences not applicable to their current social situation. A system of construction that chronically fails to characterize and/or predict events, and is not appropriately revised to comprehend and predict one's changing social world, is considered to underlie psychopathology (or mental illness.){{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
From the theory, Kelly derived a [[psychotherapy]] approach and also a technique called ''The Repertory Grid Interview'' that helped his patients to uncover their own "constructs"  with minimal intervention or interpretation by the therapist. The [[repertory grid]] was later adapted for various uses within organizations, including decision-making and interpretation of other people's world-views.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=George A.|title=Theory of Personality : the psychology of personal constructs.|year=1980|publisher=Norton|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0393001520|edition=1. publ. in ... pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Humanistic theories ===
[[Humanistic psychology]] emphasizes that people have [[free will]] and that this plays an active role in determining how they behave. Accordingly, humanistic psychology focuses on subjective experiences of persons as opposed to forced, definitive factors that determine behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Stefaroi, P. (2015). Humanistic Personology: A Humanistic-Ontological Theory of the Person &amp; Personality. Applications in Therapy, Social Work, Education, Management and Art (Theatre).  Charleston SC, USA: CreateSpace.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Maslow]] and [[Carl Rogers]] were proponents of this view, which is based on the "phenomenal field" theory of Combs and Snygg (1949).&lt;ref&gt;Combs, Arthur W., and Snygg, Donald. '' : A New Frame of Reference for Psychology''. New York, Harper and Brothers. [http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/snygg&amp;combs.html Article on Snygg and Combs' Phenomenological Field Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers and Maslow were among a group of psychologists that worked together for a decade to produce the ''Journal of Humanistic Psychology''. This journal was primarily focused on viewing individuals as a whole, rather than focusing solely on separate traits and processes within the individual.

[[Robert W. White (psychologist)|Robert W. White]] wrote the book ''The Abnormal Personality'' that became a standard text on [[abnormal psychology]]. He also investigated the human need to strive for positive goals like competence and influence, to counterbalance the emphasis of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] on the pathological elements of personality development.&lt;ref name=Watt&gt;{{cite book|last=Watt|first=Robert W. White ; Norman F.|title=The abnormal personality|year=1981|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-04599-1|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maslow spent much of his time studying what he called "self-actualizing persons", those who are "fulfilling themselves and doing the best they are capable of doing". Maslow believes all who are interested in growth move towards self-actualizing (growth, happiness, satisfaction) views. Many of these people demonstrate a trend in dimensions of their personalities. Characteristics of self-actualizers according to Maslow include the four key dimensions:&lt;ref name=Maslow&gt;{{cite book|last=Maslow|first=Abraham H.|title=Toward a Psychology of Being|year=1999|publisher=Wiley|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-471-29309-1|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Awareness''' – maintaining constant enjoyment and awe of life. These individuals often experienced a "peak experience". He defined a peak experience as an "intensification of any experience to the degree there is a loss or transcendence of self". A peak experience is one in which an individual perceives an expansion of themselves, and detects a unity and meaningfulness in life. Intense concentration on an activity one is involved in, such as running a marathon, may invoke a peak experience.
# '''Reality and problem centered''' – having a tendency to be concerned with "problems" in surroundings.
# '''Acceptance/Spontaneity''' – accepting surroundings and what cannot be changed.
# '''Unhostile sense of humor/democratic''' – do not take kindly to  joking about others, which can be viewed as offensive. They have friends of all backgrounds and religions and hold very close friendships.

Maslow and Rogers emphasized a view of the person as an active, creative, experiencing human being who lives in the present and subjectively responds to current perceptions, relationships, and encounters. They disagree with the dark, pessimistic outlook of those in the Freudian psychoanalysis ranks, but rather view humanistic theories as positive and optimistic proposals which stress the tendency of the human personality toward growth and self-actualization. This progressing self will remain the center of its constantly changing world; a world that will help mold the self but not necessarily confine it. Rather, the self has opportunity for maturation based on its encounters with this world. This understanding attempts to reduce the acceptance of hopeless redundancy. Humanistic therapy typically relies on the client for information of the past and its effect on the present, therefore the client dictates the type of guidance the therapist may initiate. This allows for an individualized approach to therapy. Rogers found patients differ in how they respond to other people. Rogers tried to model a particular approach to therapy- he stressed the reflective or empathetic response. This response type takes the client's viewpoint and reflects back their feeling and the context for it. An example of a reflective response would be, "It seems you are feeling anxious about your upcoming marriage". This response type seeks to clarify the therapist's understanding while also encouraging the client to think more deeply and seek to fully understand the feelings they have expressed.

=== Biopsychological theories ===

Biology plays a very important role in the development of personality. The study of the biological level in personality psychology focuses primarily on identifying the role of genetic determinants and how they mold individual personalities.&lt;ref&gt;Plomin, R., DeFries, J.C., McClearn, G.E., &amp; Rutter, M. (1997). ''Behavioral genetics'' (3rd Ed.). New York: Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest thinking about possible biological bases of personality grew out of the case of [[Phineas Gage]]. In an 1848 accident, a large iron rod was driven through Gage's head, and his personality apparently changed as a result, although descriptions&lt;ref name="return_of_phineas"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Damasio H. |author2=Grabowski T |author3=.

In general, patients with brain damage have been difficult to find and study. In the 1990s, researchers began to use [[electroencephalography]] (EEG),  [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), and more recently [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), which is now the most widely used imaging technique to help localize personality traits in the brain.

====Genetic basis of personality====
Ever since the [[Human Genome Project]] allowed for a much more in depth understanding of genetics, there has been an ongoing controversy involving heritability, personality traits, and environmental vs. genetic influence on personality. The human genome is known to play a role in the development of personality.&lt;br /&gt;
Previously, genetic personality studies focused on specific genes correlating to specific personality traits. Today's view of the gene-personality relationship focuses primarily on the activation and expression of genes related to personality and forms part of what is referred to as [[behavioural genetics]]. Genes provide numerous options for varying cells to be expressed; however, the environment determines which of these are activated. Many studies have noted this relationship in varying ways in which our bodies can develop, but the interaction between genes and the shaping of our minds and personality is also relevant to this biological relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Gazzaniga, M.S., &amp; Heatherton, T.F. (2006). ''Psychological science: Mind, brain, and behavior'' (2nd ed.). New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
DNA-environment interactions are important in the development of personality because this relationship determines what part of the DNA code is actually made into proteins that will become part of an individual. It has been noted that while different choices are made available by the genome, in the end, the environment is the ultimate determinant of what becomes activated. Small changes in DNA in individuals are what lead to the uniqueness of every person as well as differences in looks, abilities, brain functioning, and all the factors that culminate to develop a cohesive personality.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, G. (2004). ''The birth of the mind.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattell and Eysenck have proposed that genetics have a strong influence on personality. A large part of the evidence collected linking genetics and the environment to personality have come from [[Twin study|twin studies]]. This "twin method" compares levels of similarity in personality using genetically identical [[twin]]s. One of the first of these twin studies measured 800 pairs of twins, studied numerous personality traits, and determined that identical twins are most similar in their general abilities. Personality similarities were found to be less related for self-concepts, goals, and interests.&lt;ref name="Loehlin"&gt;Loehlin, J.C., &amp; Nichols, R.C. (1976). ''Hereditary, environment, and personality: A study of 850 sets of twins.'' Austin: University of Texas Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Twin studies have also been important in the creation of the [[Big Five personality traits|five factor personality model]]: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Neuroticism and extraversion are the two most widely studied traits. A person that may fall into the extravert category can display characteristics such as impulsiveness, sociability, and activeness. A person falling into the neuroticism category may be more likely to be moody, anxious, or irritable. Identical twins, however, have higher correlations in personality traits than fraternal twins. One study measuring genetic influence on twins in five different countries found that the correlations for identical twins were .50, while for fraternal they were about .20.&lt;ref name="Loehlin" /&gt; It is suggested that heredity and environment interact to determine one's personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldberg | first1 = L.R. | year = 1990 | title = An alternative "description of personality": The Big-Five factor structure | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 1216–1229 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.6.1216 | pmid=2283588}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jeronimus, B.F.|author2= Riese, H.|author3= Sanderman, R.|author4= Ormel, J.|year=2014|title= Mutual Reinforcement Between Neuroticism and Life Experiences: A Five-Wave, 16-Year Study to Test Reciprocal Causation|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=107|issue=4|pages=751–64|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0037009|doi=10.1037/a0037009|pmid=25111305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary theory===

[[Charles Darwin]] is the founder of the [[Darwinism|theory of the evolution of the species]]. The evolutionary approach to personality psychology is based on this theory.&lt;ref name="Buss"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buss | first1 = D.M. | year = 1991 | title = Evolutionary personality psychology | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 459–491 | doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.42.1.459}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory examines how individual personality differences are based on [[natural selection]]. Through natural selection organisms change over time through adaptation and selection. Traits are developed and certain genes come into expression based on an organism's environment and how these traits aid in an organism's survival and reproduction.

[[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphisms]], such as gender and blood type, are forms of diversity which evolve to benefit a species as a whole.&lt;ref name="Ford unk."&gt;[[E.B. Ford|Ford E.B.]] 1965. ''Genetic polymorphism''. Faber &amp; Faber, London.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory of evolution has wide-ranging implications on personality psychology. Personality viewed through the lens of evolutionary psychology places a great deal of emphasis on specific traits that are most likely to aid in survival and reproduction, such as conscientiousness, sociability, emotional stability, and dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kenrick | first1 = D.T. | last2 = Sadalla | first2 = E.K. | last3 = Groth | first3 = G. | last4 = Trost | first4 = M.R. | year = 1990 | title = Evolution, traits, and the stages of human courtship: Qualifying the parental investment model | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 97–116 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1990.tb00909.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social aspects of personality can be seen through an evolutionary perspective. Specific character traits develop and are selected for because they play an important and complex role in the social hierarchy of organisms. Such characteristics of this social hierarchy include the sharing of important resources, family and mating interactions, and the harm or help organisms can bestow upon one another.&lt;ref name="Buss" /&gt;


=== Drive theories===

In the 1930s, [[John Dollard]] and [[Neal Elgar Miller]] met at [[Yale University]], and began an attempt to integrate drives (see [[Drive theory]]), into a theory of personality, basing themselves on the work of [[Clark Hull]]. They began with the premise that personality could be equated with the habitual responses exhibited by an individual – their habits. From there, they determined that these habitual responses were built on secondary, or acquired drives. 

Secondary drives are internal needs directing the behaviour of an individual that results from learning.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dollard|first1=John|last2=Miller|first2=Neil|title=Social Learning and Imitation|date=1941|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, London|edition=Tenth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Acquired drives are learned, by and large in the manner described by [[classical conditioning]]. When we are in a certain environment and experience a strong response to a stimulus, we internalize cues from the said environment.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; When we find ourselves in an environment with similar cues, we begin to act in anticipation of a similar stimulus.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; Thus, we are likely to experience anxiety in an environment with cues similar to one where we have experienced pain or fear – such as the dentist's office.  

Secondary drives are built on primary drives, which are biologically driven, and motivate us to act with no prior learning process – such as hunger, thirst or the need for sexual activity. However, secondary drives are thought to represent more specific elaborations of primary drives, behind which the functions of the original primary drive continue to exist.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; Thus, the primary drives of fear and pain exist behind the acquired drive of anxiety. Secondary drives can be based on multiple primary drives and even in other secondary drives. This is said to give them strength and persistence.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; Examples include the need for money, which was conceptualized as arising from multiple primary drives such as the drive for food and warmth, as well as from secondary drives such as imitativeness (the drive to do as others do) and anxiety.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt;

Secondary drives vary based on the social conditions under which they were learned – such as culture. Dollard and Miller used the example of food, stating that the primary drive of hunger manifested itself behind the learned secondary drive of an appetite for a specific type of food, which was dependent on the culture of the individual.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt;

Secondary drives are also explicitly social, representing a manner in which we convey our primary drives to others.&lt;ref name="Friedman and Schustack, 2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedman|first1=Howard.S.|last2=Schustack|first2=Miriam.W.|title=Personality: Classic Theories and Modern Research|date=2015|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0205997930|edition=Sixth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, many primary drives are actively repressed by society (such as the sexual drive).&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; Dollard and Miller believed that the acquisition of secondary drives was essential to childhood development.&lt;ref name="Friedman and Schustack, 2015" /&gt; As children develop, they learn not to act on their primary drives, such as hunger but acquire secondary drives through reinforcement.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; Friedman and Schustack describe an example of such developmental changes, stating that if an infant engaging in an active orientation towards others brings about the fulfillment of primary drives, such as being fed or having their diaper changed, they will develop a secondary drive to pursue similar interactions with others – perhaps leading to an individual being more gregarious.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman and Schustack, 2015" /&gt; Dollard and Miller's belief in the importance of acquired drives led them to reconceive [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of psychosexual development.&lt;ref name="Friedman and Schustack, 2015" /&gt; They found themselves to be in agreement with the timing Freud used but believed that these periods corresponded to the successful learning of certain secondary drives.&lt;ref name="Friedman and Schustack, 2015" /&gt;

Dollard and Miller gave many examples of how secondary drives impact our habitual responses – and by extension our personalities, including anger, social conformity, imitativeness or anxiety, to name a few. In the case of anxiety, Dollard and Miller note that people who generalize the situation in which they experience the anxiety drive will experience anxiety far more than they should.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; These people are often anxious all the time, and anxiety becomes part of their personality.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; This example shows how drive theory can have ties with other theories of personality – many of them look at the trait of neuroticism or emotional stability in people, which is strongly linked to anxiety.

==Personality tests==

There are two major types of personality tests, projective and objective.

''Projective tests'' assume personality is primarily unconscious and assess individuals by how they respond to an ambiguous stimulus, such as an ink blot. Projective tests have been in use for about 60 years and continue to be used today. Examples of such tests include the [[Rorschach test]] and the [[Thematic Apperception Test]].

The Rorschach Test involves showing an individual a series of note cards with ambiguous ink blots on them. The individual being tested is asked to provide interpretations of the blots on the cards by stating everything that the ink blot may resemble based on their personal interpretation. The therapist then analyzes their responses. Rules for scoring the test have been covered in manuals that cover a wide variety of characteristics such as content, originality of response, location of "perceived images" and several other factors. Using these specific scoring methods, the therapist will then attempt to relate test responses to attributes of the individual's personality and their unique characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Exner, J.E. (1993). ''The Rorschach: A comprehensive system, Vol. 1: Basic foundations'' (3rd ed.). New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that unconscious needs will come out in the person's response, e.g. an aggressive person may see images of destruction.&lt;br /&gt;
The Thematic Apperception Test (also known as the TAT) involves presenting individuals with vague pictures/scenes and asking them to tell a story based on what they see. Common examples of these "scenes" include images that may suggest family relationships or specific situations, such as a father and son or a man and a woman in a bedroom.&lt;ref&gt;Bellak, L., &amp; Abrams, D.M. (1997). ''The Thematic Apperception Test, the Children's Apperception Test, and the Senior Apperception Technique in clinical use'' (6th ed.). Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; Responses are analyzed for common themes. Responses unique to an individual are theoretically meant to indicate underlying thoughts, processes, and potentially conflicts present within the individual. Responses are believed to be directly linked to unconscious motives. There is very little empirical evidence available to support these methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watkins | first1 = C.E. | last2 = Campbell | first2 = V.L. | last3 = Nieberding | first3 = R. | last4 = Hallmark | first4 = R. | year = 1995 | title = Contemporary practice of psychological assessment by clinical psychologists | url = | journal = [[Professional Psychology, Research and Practice]] | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 54–60 | doi=10.1037/0735-7028.26.1.54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Objective tests'' assume personality is consciously accessible and that it can be measured by self-report questionnaires. Research on psychological assessment has generally found objective tests to be more valid and reliable than projective tests. Critics have pointed to the [[Forer effect]] to suggest some of these appear to be more accurate and discriminating than they really are. Issues with these tests include false reporting because there is no way to tell if an individual is answering a question honestly or accurately.

The [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator|Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] (also known as the MBTI) is self-reporting questionnaire based on [[Carl Jung]]'s [[Type theory]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/home.htm?bhcp=1|title=The Myers &amp; Briggs Foundation  - MBTI® Basics|website=www.myersbriggs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inner experience==
Psychology has traditionally defined personality through its behavioral patterns, and more recently with neuroscientific studies of the brain.  In recent years, some psychologists have turned to the study of inner experiences for insight into personality as well as individuality. Inner experiences are the thoughts and feelings to an immediate phenomenon. Another term used to define inner experiences is [[qualia]]. Being able to understand inner experiences assists in understanding how humans behave, act, and respond. Defining personality using inner experiences has been expanding due to the fact that solely relying on behavioral principles to explain one's character may seem incomplete. Behavioral methods allow the subject to be observed by an observer, whereas with inner experiences the subject is its own observer.&lt;ref name=Price&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Donald D.|title=Inner experience and neuroscience : merging both perspectives|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262017657|author2=Barrell, James J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mihelic&gt;{{cite web|last=Mihelic|first=Janell|title=Exploring the phenomena of inner experience with descriptive experience sampling|url=http://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1862&amp;context=thesesdissertations|work=UNLV Theses/Dissertations/Professional Papers/Capstones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods measuring inner experience===
'''Descriptive experience sampling (DES)''', developed by psychologist Russel Hurlburt. This is an [[idiographic]] method that is used to help examine inner experiences. This method relies on an introspective technique that allows an individual's inner experiences and characteristics to be described and measured. A beep notifies the subject to record their experience at that exact moment and 24 hours later an interview is given based on all the experiences recorded. DES has been used in subjects that have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression. It has also been crucial to studying the inner experiences of those who have been diagnosed with common psychiatric diseases.&lt;ref name="Mihelic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/health/22prof.html|title=Taking Mental Snapshots to Plumb Our Inner Selves|author=Hoffman, Jascha|date= December 21, 2009|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hurlburt|first=Russell|title=Iteratively Apprehending Pristine Experience|journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies|year=2009|volume=16|pages=156–188|url=http://faculty.unlv.edu/hurlburt/hurlburt-2009c.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Articulated thoughts in stimulated situations (ATSS)''': ATSS is a [[paradigm]] which was created as an alternative to the TA (think aloud) method. This method assumes that people have continuous internal dialogues that can be naturally attended to. ATSS also assesses a person’s inner thoughts as they verbalize their cognitions. In this procedure, subjects listen to a scenario via a video or audio player and are asked to imagine that they are in that specific situation. Later, they are asked to articulate their thoughts as they occur in reaction to the playing scenario. This method is useful in studying emotional experience given that the scenarios used can influence specific emotions. Most importantly, the method has contributed to the study of personality. In a study conducted by Rayburn and Davison (2002), subjects’ thoughts and empathy toward anti-gay hate crimes were evaluated. The researchers found that participants showed more aggressive intentions towards the offender in scenarios which mimicked hate crimes.&lt;ref name=Mihelic /&gt;

'''Experimental method''': This method is an experimental paradigm used to study human experiences involved in the studies of sensation and perception, learning and memory, motivation, and biological psychology. The experimental psychologist usually deals with intact organisms although studies are often conducted with organisms modified by surgery, radiation, drug treatment, or long-standing deprivations of various kinds or with organisms that naturally present organic abnormalities or emotional disorders. Economists and psychologists have developed a variety of experimental methodologies to elicit and assess individual attitudes where each emotion differs for each individual. The results are then gathered and quantified to conclude if specific experiences have any common factors. This method is used to seek clarity of the experience and remove any biases to help understand the meaning behind the experience to see if it can be generalized.&lt;ref name="Price" /&gt;

'''Pont's Analysis''' is an analysis developed by Pont in 1909. This analysis allows one to predict the width of the maxillary arch at the premolar and molar region by measure the mesio-distal widths of the four permanent incisors.  The analysis helps to determine if the dental arch is narrow or normal and if expansion is possible or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = [Evaluation of Pont's index with {{sic|speical|nolink=y}} reference to the mesiodistal distance of the lateral teeth. Statistical analysis of 417 eugnathic dentitions]|journal = Deutsche Stomatologie|date = 1969-10-01|issn = 0012-0790|pmid = 5262916|pages = 775–783|volume = 19|issue = 10|first = G.|last = Mühlberg|first2 = U.|last2 = Nedelko|first3 = J.|last3 = Weiskopf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The width from Left Premolar to Right Premolar or ''Measured Premolar Value (MPV)'' can be calculated by using Sum of Incisal Widths (S.I) of incisors and multiplying it by 100. The result can be divided by 80.

The width from Left Molar to Right Molar or ''Measured Molar Value (MMV)'' can be calculated by using the S.I of incisors and multiplying by 100. The result is divided by 64.

The widths are measured from occlusal grooves of both premolars and molars.

==Disadvantages==
One of the drawbacks of this analysis is that the analysis was initially done on French Population by Pont. Therefore, the data cannot be used to make predictions for other populations. This analysis also does not take the alignment of the teeth into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joondeph|first1=Donald|title=Pont's Index: A clinical Evaluation|journal=Angle Orthodontist|volume=40|issue=2|pages=112–8|date=1970|url=http://www.angle.org/doi/pdf/10.1043/0003-3219(1970)040%3C0112:PIACE%3E2.0.CO%3B2|accessdate=17 January 2016|doi=10.1043/0003-3219(1970)040&lt;0112:PIACE&gt;2.0.CO;2|pmid=5266011|doi-broken-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, because this analysis only applies to the upper arch serves a drawback also. Maxillary teeth are often missing and [[Peg Laterals]] are often seen in the maxillary arch.

== Linder Harth Index ==
Linder Hath index is derived from Pont's Index. The Hath index has a slight variation from Pont's analysis. In the maxillary arch instead of 80, Linder Harth Index uses 85 to achieve the Measured Molar Value.

Michael Ryan|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz4wU64f_JYC&amp;pg=PA409|accessdate=15 November 2012|date=2 February 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-8353-6|page=409}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched by a joint effort of three of the leading European sociologists — [[Anthony Giddens]], [[Ulrich Beck]] and [[Scott Lash]]. The introduction of this concept served a double purpose: to reassess sociology as a science of the present (moving beyond the early 20th century conceptual framework); and to provide a counterbalance to the [[Postmodernity|postmodernist paradigm]] offering a re-constructive view alongside [[deconstruction]].&lt;ref name="Ulrich-2003"&gt;[http://tcs.sagepub.com/content/20/2/1.abstract Ulrich Beck Wolfgang Bonss Christoph Lau (2003) "The Theory of Reflexive Modernization: Problematic, Hypotheses and Research Programme." ''Theory, Culture &amp; Society,'' Volume: 20 issue: 2, page(s): 1-33,  April 1, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept built upon previous notions such as [[post-industrial society]] ([[Daniel Bell]]) and [[Post-materialism|postmaterial society]], but stresses how in [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]] modernization, [[modernity]] directs its attention to the process of [[modernization]] itself.&lt;ref name="Ulrich-2003"/&gt;

==Completion of modernity==

The main thesis deals with the changes brought on by the realisation of modernity's ideals, such as [[universal suffrage]] and education, the [[welfare state]], [[civil and political rights]], changes that marked the shift to the [[second modernity]]. The authors consider it a reflexive modernity because it opposes its earlier version, in the same way as the first modernity opposed feudal traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Chanqi He, ''Modernization Science'' (2012) p. 111 and p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the institutions of the first modernity are beginning to crumble in the face of [[Economic globalization|economic]] and [[cultural globalization]]. The state is starting to lose its importance with the rise of [[Transnationalism|transnational]] forces (corporations, NGOs), the family is splitting apart with rising divorce rates favoured by the flexibility of work and the women's liberation, losing its supportive function in the process, religion is reduced to a cultural artifact, traditional political action is boycotted because of a lack of identification with the parties' goals. Therefore all previous sources of [[solidarity]] lose momentum with the rise of [[Individuation|individualization]].&lt;ref&gt;Larry J. Ray, ''Globalization and Everyday Life'' (2007) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Consequences==

Ulrich Beck focuses on the dissolution of traditional institutions and the rise of transnational forces, while promoting a new type solidarity in the face of the human made dangers of the [[risk society]], exacerbated by the inherent limits being discovered to all forms of social knowing.&lt;ref&gt;U. Bech, ''World at Risk'' (2009) p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Giddens proposes a [[Third Way (centrism)|third way]] of social policies aimed at tackling the new challenges to identity and life choices created by the biographical risks and uncertainties of reflexive modernity.&lt;ref&gt;P. Daniel-Smith, ''Cultural Theory'' (2001) p. 145-6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zygmunt Bauman]] talks about the social effects of globalization, as it seems to create new divisions between the people connected to the global flux of information (the 'tourists') and those excluded from them, not needed as workforce anymore (the 'bums').&lt;ref&gt;P. Jones et al, ''Introducing Social Theory'' (2011) p. 202-3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Inglehart]] studies the shift of human values from material to post-material in the Western societies by analyzing the [[World Values Survey]] databases;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Inglehart, ''Culture Shift in Advanced Industrial Society'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pippa Norris]] stresses the importance of cultural globalization over economical globalization,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hopper, ''Understanding Cultural Globalization'' (2007) p. 177-8&lt;/ref&gt; while also talking about the new divisions, such as the [[digital divide]].

==Characteristics==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2012}}
Reflexive modernization is a process of modernization that is characteristic of risk society whereby progress is achieved through reorganization and "reform". Science and technology as it is used for the purpose of reflexive modernization is less concerned with expanding the [[natural resource|resource base]], but rather with re-evaluating that which is already being used by society. There is a constant [[Information flow|flow of information]] between [[science]] and [[industry]], and progress is achieved through the resulting reforms, [[optimization]]s and [[adaptation]]s. Examples of reflexive modernization that have recently gained political momentum are [[sustainability]] and the [[precautionary principle]]. The [[new social movements]] (feminist, green, and pirate parties) are also considered to be an expression of reflexive modernization.

==Buddhism==
===The Four Noble Truths===
{{main|Four Noble Truths}}
The Four Noble Truths are the most fundamental [[Buddhist]] teachings and appear countless times throughout the most ancient Buddhist texts, the [[Pali Canon]]. They arose from [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s [[bodhi|enlightenment]] and are regarded in Buddhism as deep spiritual insight, ''not as philosophical theory'', with Buddha noting in the [[Samyutta Nikaya]]: "These Four Noble Truths, monks, are actual, unerring, not otherwise. Therefore, they are called noble truths."&lt;ref name = "noble1"&gt;''The Collected Discourses of the Buddha: A new translation of the Samyutta Nikaya'', Bhikkhu Bodhi, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The Four Noble Truths (''Catvāry Āryasatyāni'') are as follows: 
# The truth that suffering exists ([[Dukkha]]).
# The truth that suffering exists with a root cause ([[Tanha|craving]]).
# The truth that suffering can be eliminated ([[Nirvana]]).
# The truth that there is a way to eliminate suffering known as the [[Noble Eightfold Path]].

===Two Truths Doctrine===
{{main|Two truths doctrine}}
The two truths doctrine in [[Buddhism]] differentiates between two levels of [[truth]] in Buddhist [[discourse]], a "relative", or commonsense truth (Tibetan: ''kun-rdzob bden-pa''; Sanskrit: ''samvrtisatya''), and an  "ultimate" or absolute spiritual truth  (Tibetan: ''don-dam bden-pa''; Sanskrit: ''paramarthasatya''). Stated differently, the Two Truths Doctrine holds that truth exists in conventional and ultimate forms, and that both forms are co-existent. Other schools, such as [[Dzogchen]], hold that the Two Truths Doctrine are ultimately resolved into nonduality as a lived experience and are non-different.  The doctrine is an especially important element of [[Buddhism]] and was first expressed in complete modern form by [[Nagarjuna]], who based it on the ''[[Kaccāyanagotta Sutta]]''.

==Christianity==

[[Image:IQueEsLaVerita.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Pontius Pilate]]'s "[[John 18:38|What is Truth?]]" - stylized inscription at entrance to [[Antoni Gaudi]]'s [[Sagrada Família]] ([[Barcelona]]).]]
Christian philosopher [[William Lane Craig]] notes that the Bible typically uses the words true or truth in non-philosophical senses to indicate such qualities as fidelity, moral rectitude, and reality. However, it does sometimes use the word in the [[philosophical]] sense of veracity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Craig|first=William Lane|title=Are There Objective Truths about God?|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/are-there-objective-truths-about-god|accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians believe that other authorities are sources of doctrinal truth. [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] believe that the [[Papal infallibility|Pope is infallible]] when pronouncing on certain, rather specific, matters of [[Christian Church|church]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' Richard F. Costigan, ''The Consensus Of The Church And Papal Infallibility: A Study In The Background Of Vatican I'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Christian Science]], (not recognised as a Christian organization by the bulk of mainstream churches) Truth is God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m-w.com/dictionary/truth Truth - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[magisterium]] of the [[Catholic Church]] is the church's authority or office to establish teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/magisterium Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ignatius&gt;[http://www.ignatiusinsight.com/features2007/tstorck_magisterium_may07.asp Thomas Stork, "What Is the Magisterium?"]&lt;/ref&gt; That authority is vested uniquely in the [[Pope]] and the bishops, under the premise that they are in [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with the correct and true teachings of the faith which is shown in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;"The task of interpreting the Word of God authentically has been entrusted solely to the magisterium of the Church, that is, to the Pope and to the college of bishops in [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with Him" ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PN.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 100])&lt;/ref&gt; Sacred scripture and sacred tradition "make up a single sacred deposit of the Word of God, which is entrusted to the Church",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation ''Dei verbum'', 10]&lt;/ref&gt; and the magisterium is not independent of this, since "all that it proposes for belief as being [[Revelation|divinely revealed]] is derived from this single deposit of faith."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PM.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 86]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biblical inerrancy===
{{Main|Biblical inerrancy|Biblical infallibility|Biblical literalism}}
Biblical inerrancy, as formulated in the "[[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy]]", is the [[doctrine]] that the [[Protestant Bible]] "is without error or fault in all its teaching";&lt;ref&gt;Geisler, NL. and Roach, B., ''Defending Inerrancy: Affirming the Accuracy of Scripture for a New Generation, Baker Books, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or, at least, that "Scripture in the original [[Manuscript|manuscripts]] does not affirm anything that is contrary to fact".&lt;ref name="Grudem90"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Wayne A.|last=Grudem|authorlink=Wayne Grudem|title=Systematic theology: an introduction to biblical doctrine|publisher=[[Inter-Varsity Press]]|location=[[Leicester]]|year=1994|page=90|isbn=978-0-85110-652-6|oclc=29952151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various interpretations have been applied, depending on the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.''  Norman L. Geisler, ''Inerrancy'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen T. Davis, ''The debate about the Bible: Inerrancy versus infallibility'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; According to some interpretations of the doctrine, ''all'' of the Bible is without error, i.e., is to be taken as true, no matter what the issue. Other interpretations hold that the Bible is always true on important matters of [[faith]], while other interpretations hold that the Bible is true but must be specifically interpreted in the context of the [[language]], [[culture]] and time that relevant passages were written.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'' Marcus J. Borg, ''Reading the Bible Again For the First Time: Taking the Bible Seriously But Not Literally'' (2002) 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
Generally, truthfulness relates to speech: to speak only what one has seen, heard or understood, however the essence of truthfulness is far deeper in [[Hinduism]]: it is defined as upholding the central concept of righteousness.&lt;ref name="hindu1"&gt;Truth Alone Will Triumph, [http://www.akhand-jyoti.org/ArticlesMarApr03/Truth.html Akhand-Jyoti.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Upanishads]] of ancient India, truth is ''Sat'' (pronounced Sah't), the One Reality and Existence, which is directly experienced when the vision is cleared of [[dross]]. The Rishi discovers what exists, ''Sat'', as the truth of one's own Being, the Self or ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atma]]'', and as the truth of the Being of God, [[Ishvara]]. In this usage, the term truth is used to refer to not merely a derived quality "true rather than false", but the true state of being, truth as what really is there. This is described by Ramana Maharshi: "There is no greater mystery than that we keep seeking reality, though, in fact, we are reality."

==Jainism==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
Although, historically, [[Jainism|Jain]] authors have adopted different views on truth, the most prevalent is the system of ''[[anekantavada]]'' or "not-one-sidedness". This idea of truth is rooted in the notion that there is one truth, but only enlightened beings can perceive it in its entirety; unenlightened beings perceive only one side of the truth (''ekanta''). ''Anekantavada'' works around the limitations of a one-sided view of truth by proposing multiple vantage points (''nayas'') from which truth can be viewed (cf. ''[[Anekantavada#Nayavāda|Nayavāda]]''). Recognizing that there are multiple possible truths about any particular thing, even mutually exclusive truths, Jain philosophers developed a system for synthesizing these various claims, known as ''[[syadvada]]''. Within the system of ''syadvada'', each truth is qualified to its particular view-point; that is "in a certain way", one claim or another or both may be true.

==Judaism==
There is no unilateral agreement among the different denominations of Judaism concerning truth. In [[Orthodox Judaism]], truth is the revealed word of God, as found in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and to a lesser extent, in the words of the sages of the [[Talmud]]. For [[Hasidic]] Jews truth is also found in the pronouncements of their [[rebbe]], or spiritual leader, who is believed to possess [[divine inspiration]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Rebbe#Relationship of chasidim to their rebbe|Relationship of chasidim to their rebbe]]&lt;/ref&gt; Kotzk, a Polish Hasidic sect, was known for their obsession with truth.

In [[Conservative Judaism]], truth is not defined as literally as it is among the Orthodox. While Conservative Judaism acknowledges the truth of the [[Tanakh]], generally, it does not accord that status to every single statement or word contained therein, as do the Orthodox. Moreover, unlike Orthodox Judaism, Conservative Judaism believes that the nature of truth can vary from generation to generation, depending on circumstances. For instance, with respect to ''[[halakha]]'', or Jewish law, Conservative Judaism believes that it can be modified or adapted depending on the needs of the people. In Orthodox Judaism, by contrast, the ''halakha'' is fixed (by the sages of the Talmud and later authorities); the present-day task, therefore, is to interpret the ''halakha'', but not to change it.

[[Reform Judaism]] takes a much more liberal approach to truth. It does not hold that truth is found only in the Tanakh; rather, there are kernels of truth to be found in practically every religious tradition. Moreover, its attitude towards the Tanakh is, at best, a document parts of which may have been inspired, but with no particular monopoly on truth, or in any way legally binding.

Within the [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] context,  sanctions are usually monetary fines, levied against a party to a [[lawsuit]] or his/her attorney, for violating rules of [[civil procedure|procedure]], or for abusing the [[judicial process]]. The most severe sanction in a civil lawsuit is the [[involuntary dismissal]], [[with prejudice]], of a complaining party's [[cause of action]], or of the responding party's answer. This has the effect of deciding the entire action against the sanctioned party without recourse, except to the degree that an [[appeal]] or [[trial de novo|trial ''de novo'']] may be allowed because of [[reversible error]].

As a noun, the term is usually used in the plural form, even if it only refers to a single event: if a [[judge]] fines a party, it is not said that he or she imposed a sanction, but that he or she imposed sanctions.

A judge may sanction a party during a legal proceeding, by which it is implied that he or she imposes penalties.  In the [[United States federal courts|United States federal court system]], certain types of conduct are sanctionable under Rule 11 of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]].

Conversely and sometimes confusingly, the word may be used to imply "approve of," especially in an official sense.  "The law sanctions such behavior" would imply that the behavior spoken of enjoys the specific approval of law.

To sanction implies make a legal agreement. The word is derived from sanctus, to make holy. A legal agreement or sanction imposes approvals, rules, guidelines and penalties on conduct.

The Sanction is defined as ''an element associated with an accountability and which corresponds to the consequence resulting from the justification of the realisation (or not) of this accountability.''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite conference | author = Feltus C. | title = Aligning Access Rights to Governance Needs with the Responsibility MetaModel (ReMMo) in the Frame of Enterprise Architecture | date=2014 | url = http://dial.academielouvain.be/handle/boreal:144013 | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19839">Throughout the long history of [[consumer]] [[research]], there has been much interest regarding how consumers choose which [[brand]] to buy and why they continue to purchase these brands. '''Self-branding''' describes the process in which consumers match their own [[self-concept]] with the images of a certain brand.

People engaged in consumption do not merely buy certain [[product (business)|product]]s to satisfy basic [[needs]].   In fact, consumer buying [[habit (psychology)|habits]] are at a much deeper level.  Owning a certain brand can help consumers to express and build their own self-concept.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, A. Dwayne, and Tasaki, Lori H. (1992). The role and measurement of attachment in consumer behavior. Journal of Consumer Psychology, 2, 155-172.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kleine, Rober E, III, Kleine, Susan S., and Kernan, Jerome B. (1993). Mundane consumption and the self: A social-identity perspective. Journal of Consumer Psychology, 2, 209-236.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richins, Marsha L. (1994), Valuing things: The public and private meanings of possessions. Journal of Consumer Research, 21, 504-521&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, consumers will often only purchase certain trademarks when he/she finds a match between the brand image (communicated through advertisement, design of retail shop, or even package design) and his/her own self-concept. Thereby, the value of a brand also depends of its ability to help consumer to build and create self-concept.&lt;ref&gt;McCracken, Grant.(1989). Who is the celebrity endorser? Cultural foundations of the endorsement process. Journal of Consumer Research, 16, 310-321&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of connections==

===Based on self-congruity theory===
The above explanation for self-branding can be summarized by Sirgy's self-congruity theory.&lt;ref&gt;Sirgy, M. Joseph (1986). Self-congruity: Toward a theory of personality and cybernetics. Self-congruity: Toward a theory of [[personality]] and [[cybernetics]]. pp. 226. Westport, CT, US: Praeger Publishers/Greenwood Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that consumer [[behavior]] is partially determined by the similarity between consumers' psychological comparisons of the brand-user-image. This self-congruity affects consumption behavior of consumers through motives such as need for [[self-consistency]] (e.g. "I am a good student because I work hard to prepare for examinations and I always get good grades") and [[self-esteem]]. On the other hand, high self-congruity occurs when the consumers find appropriate match between their own [[self-image]] and the brand-image. Only high self-congruity would help consumers maintain and enhance [[Self (psychology)|self]] in a positive direction.&lt;ref&gt;Roger, Carl R. (1957). Client-Centered Therapy, Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Further from the above notions, high self-congruity will lead to positive [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] towards the [[brand]] and repeated purchase.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;

===Brand evaluation===
Besides assisting consumer to choose which product and brand to buy, the matching process between [[self-concept]] and image of brand and product also determines how consumers [[evaluate]] the brand and product. When we say that a brand has a positive brand-image, it means that the brand has established some strong, favorable and unique [[association (psychology)|associations]] with the consumer's self-image&lt;ref name="multiple3"/&gt; (e.g. iPods have a strong and explicit image of being trendy, fashionable and high-tech, a combination of brand image that is unique and valued by young people). These strong, favorable and unique associations can be mainly divided into two parts. They are image of users and the psychological benefits experienced by the users in buying this particular brand or product.&lt;ref&gt;Aaker, David A. (1991). Managing brand-equity: Capitalizing on the value of a brand name. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, image of users means that when consumer evaluate the brand they will image the typical user of this particular brand and see whether they are similar to the typical user. [[Demographic]] and psychological profile of the typical user is usually a good source of information for consumer to make these comparisons.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;Escalas, J. Edson, and Bettman, R. James (2003). You are what they eat: the influence of reference groups on consumers' connections to brands. Journal of Consumer Psychology, 13, 339-348.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. if someone perceived themselves as a trendy youngster and valued advanced technology, the chance that they will buy an iPod for their own use is very high). Secondly, psychological benefits experienced by consumers include increase recognition by the peer group (i.e. social approval) and expression of how one would like other people to see and think of oneself (i.e. personal expression).&lt;ref name="multiple3"&gt;Keller, Kevin L. (1993). Conceptualizing, measuring, and managing customer-based brand equity. Journal of Marketing, 57,1-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructing a self-concept==
When the set of brand associations are linked or connected to the [[Self (psychology)|self]], these associations can help consumers achieve certain goals. These goals include what they might become, what they would like to become, and what they are afraid of becoming. People are motivated to create a favorable and consistent self-[[Identity (social science)|identity]] based on [[self-enhancement]] (i.e. people over-emphasize favorable evaluations and minimize critical assessment of themselves) [[self-verification]] (i.e. people want to be known and understood by others according to their firmly held beliefs and feelings about themselves respectively).

===Self-enhancement===
In self-enhancement, the [[Impression formation|impressions]] individuals hold about themselves are often biased towards a positive direction.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; Therefore, they over-emphasize favorable evaluations and minimize critical assessment of self. People use brand to represent favorable self-images to others or to themselves.

The first aspect in self-enhancement is the need to maintain and enhance self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, Anthony G., Bellezza, Francis S.. and Banaji, Mahzarin R. (1988). Is self-esteem a central ingredient of the self-concept? Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 14, 34-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Another aspect is about [[social interaction]] (e.g. staff meetings). In terms of [[impression management]], people actively manage their presentation (e.g. the brand of garment) in front of other people so as to maximize the opportunity to gain positive feedback.&lt;ref name="multiple2"/&gt; On the other hand, people are also motivated to create a good impression (e.g. wearing a watch of big brand) in order to gain social approval and intrinsic satisfaction.&lt;ref name="multiple2"&gt;Schlenker, Barry R. (1980). Impression management: The self-concept, social identity, and interpersonal relations. Monterey, CA. Brooks/Cole.&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true when the person has very high self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, Roy F., Tice, Dianne M., and Hutton, Debra G. (1989). Self-presentational motivations and personality differences in self-esteem. Journal of Personality, 57, 547-579.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-verification===
Self-verification refers to seek accurate information about self. In general, people seek and interpret situations and behavioral strategies that match their present self-conceptions. In contrast, they avoid situations and behaviors that derive contradictory information.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;

Self-verification can be achieved by two primary strategies. The first strategy is seeing more self-confirmatory evidence than actually exists. The second strategy is striving to affect the reactions of other people by developing a self-confirmatory environment, which includes displaying identity cues such as driving a certain brand of automobile.&lt;ref name="multiple2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="multiple4"/&gt;

It is found that people choose products and brand by imagining the [[prototypical]] users for each item in the choice set and choosing the items that maximizes their similarity to a desired prototypical user.&lt;ref&gt;Niedenthal, Paula M., Cantor. Nacy, and Kihlstrom, John F. (1985). Self to prototype matching: A strategy for social decision-making. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 48, 575-584.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compatibility of self-enhancement and self-verification===
It seems that it is incompatible to seek feedback that is favorable (self-enhancement) and at the same time seek accurate feedback regardless of favorability (self-verification). [[Social psychology]] shows that there are factors affecting the relative degree to which each feedback satisfied, e.g. cognitive resources,&lt;ref name="multiple4"&gt;Swann, William B., Jr. (1990). To be adored or to be known? The interplay of self-enhancement and self-verification. In E.Tory Higgins and Richard M. Sorrentino (Eds.) Handbook of motivation and cognition: Foundations of social behavior (pp.408-448). New York: Guildford.&lt;/ref&gt; stable versus malleable aspects of [[Personality type|personality]],&lt;ref&gt;Dunning, David. (1995). Trait importance and modifiability as factors influencing self-assessment and self-enhancement motives. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21, 1297-1306.&lt;/ref&gt; intuitive-experiential versus analytical-rational modes of thought,&lt;ref&gt;Morling, Beth, and Epstein, Seymour. (1997). Compromises produced by the dialectic between self-verification and self-enhancement. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73, 1268-1283&lt;/ref&gt; or cognitive versus affective processes.&lt;ref name="multiple4"/&gt; More specifically, it is found that people with high self-esteem, high self-monitors (i.e. regulate their own behavior in order to "look good"), narcissists (i.e. self-love), and Type B personalities (i.e. patient, relaxed, and easy-going) are more likely than their counterparts to be influenced by self-enhancement motives as opposed to self-verification motives.&lt;ref&gt;Sedikides, Constantine, and Strube, Michael J. (1995). The multiply motivated self. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21, 1330-1335.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of YouTube to promote a brand==

[[YouTube]] has become an increasingly popular platform for self-branding. As self-branding is known for its strategic placement of oneself through a media outlet, it is a commonplace for many individuals to post videos, clips, tutorials, and other visual aides under their channels. YouTube especially gives the individual the opportunity to upload and control the information that is distributed on themselves – as they are the ones creating, editing, and uploading the content. By controlling the information being displayed on their channels, it is possible to promote and market themselves on a wider scale as YouTube has millions cross paths with their site daily.&lt;ref name=Marwick&gt;{{cite book |last=Marwick |first=Alice|authorlink=Alice Marwick |date=2013 |title=Status Update: Celebrity, Publicity, and Branding in the Social Media Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through self-branding, developing one's self is not the only aspect of this self-marketing tactic. There is also the aspect of "authenticity" to validate their specialties, and also a "business-targeted self presentation".&lt;ref name=Marwick/&gt; This can be done through addressing the proper credentials or years of practice that has past throughout their practice of the topic or talent they relate themselves to.

The concept of self-branding a product can be seen particularly in the case of physical exercise gurus, beauty gurus, health gurus, food expert, and other gurus as well. This concept can be seen in the successful [[Michelle Phan]], who is a beauty guru on YouTube. Michelle Phan has a record of revealing intimate facts about her life through interviews, blogs, and YouTube videos. On her website michellephan.com, she has created an "about me" section to further her self-branding in efforts to give a brief introduction about herself and her passion for beauty related topics, tips, and advice. She states, "I'm passionate about being a makeup artist and teaching others how to look and feel fabulous in their own skin".&lt;ref name="michellephan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michellephan.com/about-me/|title=ABOUT ME - Michelle Phan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also claims to help women raise their self-esteem and confidence levels. This is all done through "a safe space where makeup enthusiasts, fashion lovers, trendsetters, and beauty aficionados alike, can find inspiration, how-to advice, style news, easy DIY ideas, and tips".&lt;ref name="michellephan.com"/&gt;

YouTube gurus like Michelle Phan carry an image and a created identity. In an interview with fashionista.com, Michelle Phan stated that success in the blogging and video industry has to do with sending a message, vision, and brand identity.&lt;ref name="fashionista.com"&gt;http://fashionista.com/2014/04/michelle-phan-youtube-beauty-tutorials#awesm=~oF3B0ezXN1xUcR&lt;/ref&gt; She has said to be cautious of what she is affiliated with, as it can affect the relationship she has formed with her followers.&lt;ref name="fashionista.com"/&gt; Through presenting an identity through her YouTube channel, she and other YouTube gurus alike have launched their own products. For instance, Michelle Phan has created a line of cosmetics that include eye shadows, lipsticks, eyeliners, foundation, contour sticks, concealer, and other forms of makeup that are related to the content she chooses to upload on her personal YouTube channel. Michelle Phan's ability to self-brand through media such as YouTube gives her a competitive advantage. YouTube reports that "more than 1 billion unique users visit YouTube each month".&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/yt/press/statistics.html|title=Statistics - YouTube|first=|last=YouTube|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also states "over 6 billion hours of video are watched each month on YouTube".&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; Michelle Phan's channel is one of the channels YouTube claims is among the "thousands of channels that are making six figures a year".&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

==Development of concepts==
In the process of [[consumer socialization]], self-brand connections develop throughout [[childhood]] as a result of developmental changes. Major changes occur in the representation of self-concepts between early childhood and [[adolescence]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Morris (1986), "Self-Concept from Middle Childhood through Adolescence," in Psychological Perspectives on the Self, ed. Jerry Suls and Anthony Greenwald, Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum, 107–36.&lt;/ref&gt; As children grow older, they conceptualize the self in less concrete and more abstract terms. For example, a concrete thinker can recognize that John likes clothes; more abstract thinker can reflect on emotions, like [[affection]]. Self-concepts become more complex as children mature, with a greater variety of self-constructs used to describe the self.&lt;ref&gt;Montemayor, Raymond and Marvin Eisen (1977), "The Development of Self-Conceptions from Childhood to Adolescence," Developmental Psychology, 13 (4), 314–19.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Dixon and Street (1975) study, possessions were not part of self-concept descriptions for 6- to 8-year-olds but surfaced and increased in importance from 8 to 16 years of age.

Children recognize brand at an early age, as young as 3 or 4 years of age. John and Sujan (1990)&lt;ref&gt;John, Deborah Roedder and Mita Sujan (1990), "Age Differences in Product Categorization," Journal of Consumer Research, 16 (March), 452–60.&lt;/ref&gt; found that children 4–7 years of age used perceptual cues (shape, package color), whereas older children (8–10 years) used no observable conceptual cues (taste) as a basis for classifying products. They, in middle childhood (7–8 years of age) can name multiple brand products and request products by brand name.&lt;ref&gt;John, Deborah Roedder (1999), "Consumer Socialization of Children: A Retrospective Look at Twenty-Five Years of Research," Journal of Consumer Research, 26 (December), 183–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Their comparisons of the self-concept with brand take place on a concrete level that self-brand connections are straightforward in nature. For example, self-brand connections might be made on the basis of simply being familiar with or owning a brand.

Late childhood (10–12 years of age) begin heightened appreciation for subtle meanings imbedded in brand images converges with a trend toward defining the self in more abstract and complex terms. Brands gain recognition as useful devices for characterizing the self in terms of [[personality traits]], user characteristics, and [[reference group]]s.

As children move into adolescence, children have deeper self-brand connections because they think about brand in a very specific way—as having personalities and symbolizing group membership—that provides a natural link to their self-concepts. A greater understanding of the self, combined with social pressures to "fit in" and signal group membership, leads adolescents to be more vigilant about the social implications of owning certain brand. As a result, adolescents possess an even larger number of self-brand connections, which may be even more complex in nature.

==Reference group==
As mentioned in the [[social comparison theory]] proposed by [[social psychologist]] [[Leon Festinger]] in 1954, humans have a drive to evaluate themselves by examining their opinions and abilities in comparison to others. Consumers often use the images of other brands' users as a source of information for evaluating their own beliefs and perceptions about their own and others' social identities. They also actively construct self-concept using brand associations that arise through reference group.

In many consumer researches, reference group is a key concept for demonstrating the congruency between group membership and brand usage. It refers to the [[social groups]] that are important to a consumer and against which he/she compares oneself.  With different personal goals, individuals would take different types of reference groups. For example, if someone would like to verify his own current social identities, he tends to compare himself with a 'member group', to which it supposes he belongs to. For example, if a person considers himself to be intellectual and his member group of intellectuals tends to drive a Volvos, he may choose to drive Volvo too. Similarly, an 'aspiration group' is another type of reference group to which an individual aspires to belong. If a consumer wishes to be more hip, and he sees hip people wearing Versace clothing, he may choose to wear Versace clothing in an attempt to appropriate the hip associations of that brand.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Folkes, V.S. &amp; Kiesler, T. (1991). "Social Cognition: Consumers' Inferences about the Self and Others". In Thomas S. Robertson &amp; Harold H. Kassarjian (Eds), Handbook of Consumer Behavior, pp. 281-315. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
On the marketing level, companies gain an enduring competitive advantage by utilizing the association between brand and self-concept. This type of association is difficult for competitors to imitate. For example, in a sport consumption context, when consumer fans identify with the team (i.e., a branded organization) and rally together in expectation of victory, the team image is emphasized.

On the individual level, brand symbolism provides moderation effects for [[ingroup and outgroup|in-group and out-group]] association. For in-groups, a symbolic brand has a stronger communicating effect than a non-symbolic brand; for out-groups, only a symbolic brand used to differentiate one from out-group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24782">'''Sensory deprivation''' or '''perceptual isolation'''&lt;ref&gt;Donald Olding Hebb, Essay on Mind, Psychological Press, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; is the deliberate reduction or removal of [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] from one or more of the senses. Simple devices such as [[blindfold]]s or [[Hood (headgear)|hoods]] and [[earmuff]]s can cut off sight and hearing, while more complex devices can also cut off the sense of smell, touch, taste, thermoception (heat-sense), and 'gravity'. Sensory deprivation has been used in various [[alternative medicine]]s and in [[psychology|psychological]] experiments (e.g. with an [[isolation tank]]).

Short-term sessions of sensory deprivation are described as relaxing and conducive to [[meditation]]; however, extended or forced sensory deprivation can result in extreme [[anxiety]], [[hallucination]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sireteanu | first1 = R | last2 = Oertel | first2 = V | last3 = Mohr | first3 = H | last4 = Linden | first4 = D | last5 = Singer | first5 = W | year = 2008 | title = Graphical illustration and functional neuroimaging of visual hallucinations during prolonged blindfolding: A comparison to visual imagery | url = | journal = Perception | volume = 37 | issue = 12| pages = 1805–1821 | doi = 10.1068/p6034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; bizarre [[thought]]s, temporary senselessness, and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Grassian [http://www.prisoncommission.org/statements/grassian_stuart_long.pdf  Psychiatric effects of solitary confinement](PDF) This article is a redacted, non-institution- and non-inmate-specific version of a declaration submitted in September 1993 in Madrid v.

A related [[phenomenon]] is perceptual deprivation, also called the [[Ganzfeld effect]]. In this case a constant uniform stimulus is used instead of attempting to remove the stimuli; this leads to effects which have similarities to sensory deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wackermann|first=J|author2=Pütz P |author3=Allefeld C |title=Ganzfeld-induced hallucinatory experience, its phenomenology and cerebral electrophysiology|journal=Cortex|date=Jun 2008|pmid=18621366|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2007.05.003|volume=44|issue=10|pages=1364–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensory deprivation techniques were developed by some of the armed forces within [[NATO]], as a means of interrogating prisoners within international treaty obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Jeffery |first=Keith |year=1985 |title=The Divided province: the troubles in Northern Ireland, 1969-1985 |edition=illustrated |publisher=Orbis |isbn=0-85613-799-5 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the use of the five techniques by [[United Kingdom|British]] security forces in [[Northern Ireland]] amounted to a practice of [[inhumane]] and degrading treatment.

==Restricted environmental stimulation therapy (REST)==
There are two basic methods of restricted environmental stimulation therapy (REST): chamber REST and flotation REST.

===Chamber REST===
In chamber REST, the subject lies on a bed in a completely dark and sound-reducing (on average, 80&amp;nbsp;dB) room for up to 24 hours. Their movement is restricted by the experimental instructions, but not by any mechanical restraints. Food, drink, and toilet facilities are provided in the room and are at the discretion of the tester, who can communicate with the participants using an open intercom. Subjects are allowed to leave the room before the 24 hours are complete; however, fewer than 10% actually do because they find the chamber so relaxing.&lt;ref name=suedREST&gt;{{cite journal

| journal     = The International Journal of the Addictions
| volume      = 14
| pages       = 861–888
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chamber REST affects psychological functioning (thinking, perception, memory, motivation, and mood) and psychophysiological processes.

===Flotation REST===
{{main|Isolation tank}}
[[Image:Flotation tank SMC.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Flotation tank with flip top lid opened]]
In flotation REST, the room contains a tank or pool. The flotation medium consists of a skin-temperature solution of water and [[Epsom salts]] at a specific gravity that allows for the patient to float supine without worry of safety. In fact, to turn over while in the solution requires "major deliberate effort." Fewer than 5% of the subjects tested leave before the session duration ends, which is usually around an hour for flotation REST.&lt;ref name=suedREST/&gt;

For the first 40 minutes, it is reportedly possible to experience itching in various parts of the body (a phenomenon also reported to be common during the early stages of meditation). The last 20 minutes often end with a transition from beta or alpha [[Neural oscillation|brain waves]] to theta, which typically occur briefly before sleep and again at waking. In a float tank, the theta state can last for several minutes without the subject losing consciousness. Some use the extended theta state as a tool for enhanced [[creativity]] and [[problem solving]]. [[Spa]]s sometimes provide commercial float tanks for use in relaxation. Flotation therapy has been academically studied in the US and in Sweden with published results showing reductions of both pain and stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kjellgren | first1 = A | last2 = Sundequist | first2 = U | display-authors = etal   | year = | title = Effects of flotation-REST on muscle tension pain | url = | journal = Pain Research and Management | volume = 6 | issue = 4| pages = 181–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relaxed state also involves lowered blood pressure, lowered levels of [[cortisol]], and maximal [[Hemodynamics|blood flow]]. Apart from physiological effects, REST seems to have positive effects on well-being and performance.&lt;ref&gt;Dirk van Dierendonck &amp; Jan Te Nijenhuis- Flotation restricted environmental stimulation therapy (REST) as a stress- management tool: A meta-analysis&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chamber versus flotation REST===
Several differences exist between flotation and chamber REST. For example, with the presence of a medium in flotation REST, the subject has reduced tactile stimulation while experiencing weightlessness. The addition of Epsom salts to attain the desired specific gravity may have a therapeutic effect on [[hypertonic]] muscles. Since one of the main results of chamber REST is a state of relaxation, the effects of chamber REST on arousal are less clear-cut, which can be attributed to the nature of the solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| journal     = Imagination, Cognition and Personality
| volume      = 5
| pages       = 219–230
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, due to the inherent immobilization that is experienced in flotation REST (by not being able to roll over), which can become uncomfortable after several hours, the subject is unable to experience the session durations of chamber REST. This may not allow the subject to experience the changes in attitudes and thinking that are associated with chamber REST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| pages       = 33–39
| pmid        = 1778683
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, the research questions asked between each technique are different. Chamber REST questions stemmed from research that began in the 1950s and explored a variety of questions about the need for stimulation, nature of arousal and its relationship with external stimulation. Practitioners in this area have explored its utility in the treatment of major psychiatric dysfunctions such as substance abuse. On the contrary, flotation REST was seen as more of a recreational tool as it was tested more for its use with stress-related disorders, pain reduction and insomnia.&lt;ref name="suedREST"/&gt;

Numerous studies have debated which method is a more effective treatment process, however, only one has explored this statistically. Nineteen subjects, all of whom used chamber or flotation REST to induce relaxation or treat [[smoking]], [[obesity]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] intake or chronic pain were analyzed. The statistic of interest, d, is a measure of the size of the treatment effect. For reference, d=0.5 is considered a moderate effect and d=0.8 a large effect. The 19 subjects who underwent chamber REST had d=0.53 and six flotation REST subjects showed d=0.33. Additionally, when examining subjects undergoing REST treatment and REST in conjunction with another treatment method, there was little difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| first2        = Stanley
}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Flotation REST has the advantage of a lower duration required (45 minutes as opposed to 24 hours).

==Other uses==
The use of REST has been explored in aiding in the cessation of smoking. In studies ranging between 12 months and five years, 25% of REST patients achieved long-term abstinence. REST, when combined with other effective smoking cessation methods (for example: [[behavior modification]]) resulted in long-term abstinence of 50%. Also, when combined with weekly support groups, REST resulted in 80% of patients achieving long-term abstinence. Comparatively, the use of a [[nicotine patch]] alone has a success rate of 5%.&lt;ref name="smoking"&gt;{{cite journal

| pmid    = 3310529
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alcoholism]] has also been the target of research associated with REST. In conjunction with anti-alcohol educational messages, patients who underwent two hours of REST treatment reduced alcohol consumption by 56% in the first two weeks after treatment. The reduction in consumption was maintained during follow-ups conducted three and six months after the first treatment. It is, however, possible that this is caused by the [[Placebo|placebo effect]].

In addition, REST has been tested to determine its effect on users of other drugs. A University of Arizona study used chamber REST as a complement to traditional outpatient substance abuse treatment and found that four years later, 43% of the patients were still sober and drug-free. Eight months later, no one in the control group remained clean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| first2  = Stanley
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychedelic effects===
Studies have been conducted to test the effect of sensory deprivation on the brain. One study took 19 volunteers, all of whom tested in the lower and upper 20th percentiles on a questionnaire which measures the tendency of healthy people to see things not really there, and placed them in a pitch-black, soundproof booth for 15 minutes, after which they completed another test that measures [[psychosis]]-like experiences, originally used to study recreational drug users. Five subjects reported seeing [[hallucination]]s of faces; six reported seeing shapes/faces not actually there; four noted a heightened sense of smell, and two reported sensing a "presence of evil" in the room. People who scored lower on the first test experienced fewer perceptual distortions; however, they still reported seeing a variety of hallucinations.
Many studies have been conducted to understand the main causes of the hallucinations, and considerable evidence has been accumulated indicating that long periods of isolation aren't directly related to the level of experienced hallucinations. &lt;ref&gt;Marvin Zuckerman &amp; Nathan Cohen (1964). Sources of Reports of Visual Auditory Sensations in perceptual-isolation experiments.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schizophrenics appear to tend to experience fewer  hallucinations while in REST as compared to non-psychotic individuals. A possible explanation for this could be that non-psychotic individuals are normally exposed to a greater degree of sensory stimulation in everyday life, and in REST, the brain attempts to re-create a similar level of stimulation, producing the hallucinatory events.&lt;ref&gt;From drugs to deprivation: a Bayesian framework for understanding models of psychosis&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a 2009 study published in the ''[[Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease]],'' the hallucinations are caused by the brain misidentifying the source of what it is currently experiencing, a phenomenon called [[faulty source monitoring]].&lt;ref name="negativesense"&gt;{{cite journal
| doi        = 10.1097/NMD.0b013e3181b9760b

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A study conducted on individuals who underwent REST while under the effects of Phencyclidine (PCP) showed a lower incidence of hallucination in comparison to participants who did not take PCP. The effects of PCP also appeared to be reduced while undergoing REST. The effects PCP has on reducing occurrences of hallucinatory events provides a potential insight into the mechanisms behind these events.&lt;ref&gt;From drugs to deprivation: a Bayesian framework for understanding models of psychosis&lt;/ref&gt; 

===The five sensory deprivation techniques===
{{Main|five techniques}}

The five techniques of ''wall-standing; hooding; subjection to noise; deprivation of sleep; deprivation of food and drink'' were used by the security forces in [[Northern Ireland]] in the early 1970s. After the Parker Report of 1972, these techniques were formally abandoned by the United Kingdom as aids to the [[interrogation]] of paramilitary suspects.

The Irish government on behalf of the men who had been subject to the five methods took a case to the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] (''Ireland v. United Kingdom'', 1976 Y.B. Eur. Conv. on Hum. Rts. 512, 748, 788-94 (European Commission of Human Rights)). The Commission stated that it "considered the combined use of the five methods to amount to torture."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070629145037/http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/detainees/prohibits_torture.htm Security Detainees/Enemy Combatants: U.S. Law Prohibits Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment] Footnote 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Weissbrodt ''[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/intlhr/chapter19.doc materials on torture and other ill-treatment: 3. European Court of Human Rights]'' (doc) [http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:u7wX9dL11d4J:www1.umn.edu/humanrts/intlhr/chapter19.doc&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2&amp;lr=lang_en html]: Ireland v. United Kingdom, 1976 Y.B. European Convention on Human Rights. 512, 748, 788-94 (European Commission of Human Rights)&lt;/ref&gt; This consideration was overturned on appeal, when in 1978 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) examined the [[United Nations]]' definition of torture. The court subsequently ruled that the five techniques "did not occasion suffering of the particular intensity and cruelty implied by the word torture," however they did amount "to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment," which is a breach of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], [[Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 3]].&lt;ref name="Ireland.v.UK_167"&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57506 Ireland v. the United Kingdom (1978)], paragraph 167&lt;/ref&gt;

It their judgment&lt;ref name="Ireland.v.UK_96"&gt;[http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-57506 Ireland v. the United Kingdom (1978)], paragraph 96&lt;/ref&gt; the court states that:
:These methods, sometimes termed "disorientation" or "sensory deprivation" techniques, were not used in any cases other than the fourteen so indicated above.  It emerges from the [[European Commission of Human Rights|Commission's]] establishment of the facts that the techniques consisted of:''
::(a) wall-standing: forcing the detainees to remain for periods of some hours in a [[stress position]], described by those who underwent it as being "spreadeagled against the wall, with their fingers put high above the head against the wall, the legs spread apart and the feet back, causing them to stand on their toes with the weight of the body mainly on the fingers";
::(b) hooding: putting a black or navy colored bag over the detainees' heads and, at least initially, keeping it there all the time except during interrogation;
::(c) subjection to noise: pending their interrogations, holding the detainees in a room where there was a continuous loud and hissing noise;
::(d) deprivation of sleep: pending their interrogations, depriving the detainees of sleep
::(e) deprivation of food and drink: subjecting the detainees to a reduced diet during their stay at the center and pending interrogations.

===José Padilla===
{{Main|José Padilla (prisoner)}}
[[File:Jose Padilla at the Navy Consolidated Brig.jpg|thumb|José Padilla at the Navy Consolidated Brig]]
[[José Padilla (prisoner)|José Padilla]], a [[United States citizen]] from [[Brooklyn, New York]], was convicted in federal court of aiding [[Terrorism|terrorists]] in 2007 and was sentenced to 17 years and 4 months in prison. While awaiting trial, reports surfaced that, to persuade him to reveal information, he was subjected to sensory deprivation for weeks at a time. For 1,307 days, Padilla was kept in a 9' x 7' cell with no natural light, clock or calendar. When Padilla left his cell, he was shackled and fitted with heavy goggles and headphones. His counsel argues that while he was being interrogated Padilla was subjected to harsh lights and pounding sounds. While meeting with his counsel, they reported Padilla exhibiting facial tics, random eye movements and unusual contortions of his body. According to them, Padilla had become so "shattered" that he became convinced his lawyers were part of a continuing interrogation program and saw his captors as protectors.&lt;ref name="negativesense"/&gt;

==="Total Isolation"===
In January 2008, the [[BBC]] aired a ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' special entitled "Total Isolation". The premise of the show centered on six individuals, four men and two women, agreeing to be shut in a cell inside a nuclear bunker, alone and in complete darkness for 48 hours. Prior to isolation, the volunteers underwent tests of [[visual memory]], [[information processing]], [[Verbal fluency test|verbal fluency]] and [[suggestibility]].

After the two days and two nights, the subjects noted that their inability to sense time, as well as hallucinations, made the experience difficult. Of the six volunteers, three experienced auditory and visual hallucinations—snakes, oysters, tiny cars and zebras. One was convinced their sheets were wet. Two seemed to cope well.

When complete, the tests that the subjects took before the experiment were conducted a second time to test its effects. The results indicated all volunteers' ability to complete the simplest tasks had deteriorated. One subject's memory capacity fell 36% and all the subjects had trouble thinking of words beginning with a nominated letter; in this case, the letter "F". All four of the men had markedly increased suggestibility, although this was not the case with the women.&lt;ref name="total"&gt;{{Cite video

{{Expand French|Commission_Stasi|date=January 2012}}
The French '''commission Stasi''' is a commission set up to reflect upon the application of the ''[[laïcité]]'' principle. Named after the chair [[Bernard Stasi]], [[ombudsman]] of the (French) Republic (''médiateur de la République'') since 1998, and consisting of 20 members, it was set up by the [[President of France|president of the Republic]] [[Jacques Chirac]] on 3 July 2003. It reported its conclusions on 11 December 2003.

==Overview==

Jacques Chirac established the commission to reflect upon the principle of ''[[laïcité]]'' and its application in France. He appointed Bernard Stasi to oversee the commission.&lt;ref&gt;France 5, ''Dossiers - Débat Public :'' [http://www.france5.fr/actu_societe/W00137/9/102197.cfm La laïcité (La Commission Stasi)]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the commission interviewed various representatives from different groups, for example religious leaders such as [[Cardinal Lustiger]], intellectuals such as [[Régis Debray]] and [[Patrick Weil]] as well school headteachers, political leaders, equal-rights groups and social groups (for example the [[Ni Putes Ni Soumises]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/rapports/r1275-t2.asp&lt;/ref&gt;



The commission emerged from public debates concerning the place of the [[hijab]] in French public life in relation to the principles of laïcité, in particular whether its was appropriate in state schools. In addition the commission sought to more clearly define the application of laïcité in the workplace, public services and public spaces. To this end the Stasi Commission lead to the introduction of the [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools]]. Despite this apparent resolution to the questions concerning laïcité, the controversy surrounding the wearing of the hijab and the media attention paid to it has meant that it remains a source of disagreement within the political class.

In response to the commission's report Jacques Chirac called for the French public to unite around the principle of laïcité.

==Principles==

The report espouses two key stances that emerge from the history of secularism in France: state neutrality in regard to religion and [[freedom of thought]] particularly in relation to freedom of worship. The report also acknowledges that tensions arise between these two principles particularly in the spheres of the army, prisons, hospitals and education.

The Commission also called for the incorporation of 'accomodements raisonables' or [[reasonable accommodation]] into the principles of laïcité for problems that are not covered by the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4134">In mathematics, a [[sequence]] { ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' }, ''n'' ≥ 1, is called '''superadditive''' if it satisfies the [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]]

: &lt;math&gt;a_{n+m} \geq a_n+a_m&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''m'' and ''n''.  The major reason for the use of superadditive sequences is the following [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] due to [[Michael Fekete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fekete |first=M. |title=Über die Verteilung der Wurzeln bei gewissen algebraischen Gleichungen mit ganzzahligen Koeffizienten |journal=Mathematische Zeitschrift |volume=17 |issue=1 |year=1923 |pages=228–249 |doi=10.1007/BF01504345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lemma:''' (Fekete) For every superadditive sequence { ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' }, ''n'' ≥ 1, the limit lim ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''/''n'' exists and is equal to sup ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''/''n''.  (The limit may be positive infinity, for instance, for the sequence ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = log&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;.)

Similarly, a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' is ''superadditive'' if

: &lt;math&gt;f(x+y) \geq f(x)+f(y)&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''x'' and ''y'' in the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of ''f''.

For example, &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt; is a superadditive function for nonnegative real numbers because the square of &lt;math&gt;(x+y)&lt;/math&gt; is always greater than or equal to the square of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; plus the square of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, for nonnegative real numbers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

The analogue of Fekete's lemma holds for subadditive functions as well.
There are extensions of Fekete's lemma that do not require the definition of superadditivity above to hold for all ''m'' and ''n''.  There are also results that allow one to deduce the rate of convergence to the limit whose existence is stated in Fekete's lemma if some kind of both superadditivity and [[subadditivity]] is present. A good exposition of this topic may be found in Steele (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael J. Steele|title=Probability theory and combinatorial optimization|publisher=SIAM, Philadelphia|year=1997|isbn=0-89871-380-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|author=Michael J. Steele|title=CBMS Lectures on Probability Theory and Combinatorial Optimization|publisher=University of Cambridge|year=2011|url=http://sms.cam.ac.uk/collection/1189351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''f'' is a superadditive function, and if 0 is in its domain, then ''f''(0) ≤ 0. To see this, take the inequality at the top. &lt;math&gt;f(x) \le f(x+y) - f(y)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;f(0) \le f(0+y) - f(y) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The negative of a superadditive function is [[subadditivity|subadditive]].

== Examples of superadditive functions ==
* The determinant is superadditive for nonnegative Hermitian matrices, i.e., If &lt;math&gt;A,B\in\text{Mat}_n(\mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt; are nonnegative Hermitian then &lt;math&gt;\det(A+B)\geq\det(A)+\det(B)&lt;/math&gt;.
This follows from the Minkowski determinant theorem, which more generally states that &lt;math&gt; \det(\cdot)^{1/n}&lt;/math&gt; is superadditive (equivalently, concave)&lt;ref&gt;M. Marcus, H. Minc (1992). [https://books.google.pt/books?id=hLHKwSNqLOcC ''A survey in matrix theory and matrix inequalities'']. Dover. Theorem 4.1.8, page 115.&lt;/ref&gt; for nonnegative Hermitian matrices of size ''n'': If &lt;math&gt;A,B\in\text{Mat}_n(\mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt; are nonnegative Hermitian then &lt;math&gt;\det(A+B)^{1/n}\geq\det(A)^{1/n}+\det(B)^{1/n}&lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Mutual information]]. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[That is not true! This is NOT superadditive (e.g. Nielsen, Chuang)]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
* Horst Alzer proved &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Horst Alzer|title=A superadditive property of Hadamard's gamma function| publisher=Springer|year=2009| doi=10.1007/s12188-008-0009-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Hadamard's gamma function]] H(''x'') is superadditive for all real numbers ''x'',''y'' with ''x'', ''y'' &amp;ge; 1.5031.

'''Swishing''' refers to swapping an item or items of [[clothing]] or [[shoe]]s or an [[fashion accessory|accessory]] with friends or acquaintances. Parties must willingly give an item to participate in the transaction, once they have given an item they are free to choose something of interest from what others have offered. Value does not come into the equation, as swappers do not necessarily get an item of equal value and are free to choose anything that the other person if offering (without having to pay). Swishing is now being more widely practiced throughout the world and has evolved to include other items such as books and furniture. Not only do people hold 'swishing parties' either as a charity event or simply for the enjoyment of it (while recycling and saving money at the same time), but there are several websites where online swishes take place.

==History==
Swishing (deriving from the dictionary definition of 'to rustle, as silk' - which in the eyes of the Swishing team means 'to rustle from friends') began in 2000 when Lucy Shea, founder of green PR firm Futerra and her colleagues  wanted to come up with a way to combine a love of retail shopping without contributing to increased consumption. It has since been imbursed by fashion model [[Twiggy]] in Twiggy's frock exchange, and as a result has become one of the most popular ways of swapping clothes.

==Practice==
A Swishing Party usually has a Swishing Host who lays out guests' items at the venue after the guests have arrived. The Host sends one group of guests to look at the items while other groups wait or do an activity. When an allocated amount of time has passed, the groups rotate. When all guests have seen the items, the Host places everyone's name into a hat or bowl and draws them one at a time; when a guest's name is called, he or she claims an item. The Host waits for only a few seconds before calling out the next name. The remainder of the items are them donated to charity by the Host.

There are several types of variations.  If the Swish is for charity, attendees have their names placed into the bowl along with an extra amount for a donation; Swishes can be focused on specific items like clothes, crockery, shoes, handbags, and accessories; they can be held for family, friends, or workmates; they can be less orderly, as a free-for-all instead of a drawing by name.

In [[mathematics]], '''tensor calculus''' or '''tensor analysis''' is an extension of [[vector calculus]] to [[tensor field]]s ([[tensor]]s that may vary over a [[manifold]], e.g. in [[spacetime]]).

Developed by [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]] and his student [[Tullio Levi-Civita]], it was used by [[Albert Einstein]] to develop his [[theory of general relativity]]. Contrasted with the infinitesimal calculus, tensor calculus allows presentation of physics equations in a [[Manifest covariance|form that is independent]] of the [[coordinate chart|choice of coordinates]] on the manifold.

Tensor calculus has many real-life applications in [[physics]] and [[engineering]], including [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], [[continuum mechanics]], [[electromagnetism]] (see [[mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field]]), [[general relativity]] (see [[mathematics of general relativity]]),[[quantum field theory]].

'''''The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World''''' is a book by [[Pedro Domingos]] released in 2015. Domingos wrote the book in order to generate interest from people outside the field.

The book outlines five tribes of machine learning: [[inductive reasoning]], [[connectionism]], [[evolutionary computation]], [[Bayes' theorem|bayes theorem]] and [[Analogical modeling|analogical modelling]]. The author explains these tribes to the reader by referring to more understandable processes of [[logic]], connections made in the [[brain]], [[natural selection]], [[probability]] and [[Similarity (psychology)|similarity]] judgements. Throughout the book, it is suggested that each different tribe has the potential to contribute to a unifying "master algorithm".

Towards the end of the book the author pictures a "master [[algorithm]]" in the near future, where [[machine learning algorithm]]s asymptotically grow to a perfect understanding of how the world and people in it work.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Slate.com_September_26_2015c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2015/09/pedro_domingos_master_algorithm_how_machine_learning_is_reshaping_how_we.2.html|title=Pedro Domingos' Master Algorithm: How machine learning is reshaping how we live.|author=|date=|accessdate=September 26, 2015|newspaper=Slate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the algorithm doesn't yet exist, he briefly reviews his own invention of the [[Markov logic network]].&lt;ref name="Dom2015"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Master Algorithm: How machine learning is reshaping how we live.|last=Domingos|first=Pedro|date=2015|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=246–7.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
In 2016 [[Bill Gates]] recommended the book, alongside [[Nick Bostrom]]'s ''[[Superintelligence (book)|Superintelligence]]'', as one of two books everyone should read to understand AI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ha|first1=Thu-Huong|title=Bill Gates says these are the two books we should all read to understand AI|url=https://qz.com/698334/bill-gates-says-these-are-the-two-books-we-should-all-read-to-understand-ai/|accessdate=4 March 2018|work=Quartz|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 the book was noted to be on Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]]'s bookshelf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Huang|first1=Zheping|title=The two books helping China's Xi Jinping understand artificial intelligence|url=https://qz.com/1170185/the-master-algorithm-and-augmented-the-two-books-helping-chinas-xi-jinping-understand-ai/|accessdate=4 March 2018|work=Quartz|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
A computer science educator stated in ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' that the examples are clear and accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World, by Pedro Domingos|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/review-the-master-algorithm-pedro-domingos-allen-lane|accessdate=4 March 2018|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|date=17 September 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ''[[The Economist]]'' agreed Domingo "does a good job" but complained that he "constantly invents metaphors that grate or confuse".&lt;ref&gt;"Machines for thinking: artificial intelligence." The Economist, 3 Oct. 2015, p. 86(US).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' praised the book, stating "Readers unfamiliar with logic and computer theory will have a difficult time, but those who persist will discover fascinating insights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THE MASTER ALGORITHM by Pedro Domingos {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/pedro-domingos/the-master-algorithm/|accessdate=4 March 2018|date=2015|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[New Scientist]]'' review called it "compelling but rather unquestioning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=&lt;em&gt;The Master Algorithm&lt;/em&gt;: A world remade by machines that learn|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22830450-900-the-master-algorithm-a-world-remade-by-machines-that-learn/|accessdate=4 March 2018|work=New Scientist|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Top-down''' and '''bottom-up''' are both strategies of [[information processing]] and knowledge ordering, used in a variety of fields including software, humanistic and scientific theories (see [[systemics]]), and management and organization. In practice, they can be seen as a style of thinking, teaching, or leadership.

A '''top-down''' approach (also known as ''stepwise design'' and in some cases used as a synonym of ''decomposition'') is essentially the breaking down of a system to gain insight into its compositional sub-systems in a reverse engineering fashion. In a top-down approach an overview of the system is formulated, specifying, but not detailing, any first-level subsystems. Each subsystem is then refined in yet greater detail, sometimes in many additional subsystem levels, until the entire specification is reduced to base elements. A top-down model is often specified with the assistance of "black boxes", which makes it easier to manipulate. However, black boxes may fail to clarify elementary mechanisms or be detailed enough to realistically validate the model. Top down approach starts with the big picture. It breaks down from there into smaller segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bactra.org/weblog/950.html |title=Top-Down Design (Introduction to Statistical Computing) |publisher=bactra.org |date=September 24, 2012 |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bottom-up''' approach is the piecing together of systems to give rise to more complex systems, thus making the original systems sub-systems of the emergent system. Bottom-up processing is a type of [[information processing]] based on incoming data from the environment to form a [[perception]]. From a cognitive psychology perspective, information enters the eyes in one direction (sensory input, or the "bottom"), and is then turned into an image by the brain that can be interpreted and recognized as a perception (output that is "built up" from processing to final cognition). In a bottom-up approach the individual base elements of the system are first specified in great detail. These elements are then linked together to form larger subsystems, which then in turn are linked, sometimes in many levels, until a complete top-level system is formed. This strategy often resembles a "seed" model, by which the beginnings are small but eventually grow in complexity and completeness. However, "organic strategies" may result in a tangle of elements and subsystems, developed in isolation and subject to local optimization as opposed to meeting a global purpose.

==Product design and development==
{{Main article|New product development}}
During the design and development of new products, designers and engineers rely on both a bottom-up and top-down approach. The bottom-up approach is being utilized when off-the-shelf or existing components are selected and integrated into the product. An example would include selecting a particular fastener, such as a bolt, and designing the receiving components such that the fastener will fit properly. In a top-down approach, a custom fastener would be designed such that it would fit properly in the receiving components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10869-009-9090-8 |title=Cognitive Lie Detection: Response Time and Consistency of Answers as Cues to Deception - Springer |date=January 9, 1997 |accessdate=October 21, 2012 |doi=10.1007/s10869-009-9090-8 |volume=24 |journal=Journal of Business and Psychology |pages=33–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For perspective, for a product with more restrictive requirements (such as weight, geometry, safety, environment, etc.), such as a space-suit, a more top-down approach is taken and almost everything is custom designed. However, when it's more important to minimize cost and increase component availability, such as with manufacturing equipment, a more bottom-up approach would be taken, and as many off-the-shelf components (bolts, gears, bearings, etc.) would be selected as possible. In the latter case, the receiving housings would be designed around the selected components.

==Computer science==

===Software development===
:''Part of this section is from the [[Perl Design Patterns Book]]''.

In the [[software development process]], the '''top-down''' and '''bottom-up''' approaches play a key role.

Top-down approaches emphasize planning and a complete understanding of the system. It is inherent that no coding can begin until a sufficient level of detail has been reached in the design of at least some part of the system. Top-down approaches are implemented by attaching the stubs in place of the module. This, however, delays testing of the ultimate functional units of a system until significant design is complete. Bottom-up emphasizes coding and early testing, which can begin as soon as the first module has been specified. This approach, however, runs the risk that modules may be coded without having a clear idea of how they link to other parts of the system, and that such linking may not be as easy as first thought. [[Code reuse|Re-usability of code]] is one of the main benefits of the bottom-up approach.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://step.psy.cmu.edu/scripts/Attention/Treisman1980.html |title=STEP: Scripts: Attention: Treisman and Gelade 1980 |publisher=Step.psy.cmu.edu |date=March 13, 2003 |accessdate=October 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914130951/http://step.psy.cmu.edu/scripts/Attention/Treisman1980.html |archivedate=September 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Top-down design was promoted in the 1970s by [[IBM]] researchers [[Harlan Mills]] and [[Niklaus Wirth]]. Mills developed [[structured programming]] concepts for practical use and tested them in a 1969 project to automate the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' morgue index. The engineering and management success of this project led to the spread of the top-down approach through IBM and the rest of the computer industry. Among other achievements, Niklaus Wirth, the developer of [[Pascal programming language]], wrote the influential paper ''Program Development by '''Stepwise Refinement'''''. Since Niklaus Wirth went on to develop languages such as [[Modula]] and [[Oberon (programming language)|Oberon]] (where one could define a module before knowing about the entire program specification), one can infer that top-down programming was not strictly what he promoted. Top-down methods were favored in [[software engineering]] until the late 1980s,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; and [[object-oriented programming]] assisted in demonstrating the idea that both aspects of top-down and bottom-up programming could be utilized.

Modern software design approaches usually combine both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Although an understanding of the complete system is usually considered necessary for good design, leading theoretically to a top-down approach, most software projects attempt to make use of existing code to some degree. Pre-existing modules give designs a bottom-up flavor. Some design approaches also use an approach where a partially functional system is designed and coded to completion, and this system is then expanded to fulfill all the requirements for the project

===Programming===
[[File:Lego Chicago City View 2001.jpg|thumb|left|Building blocks are an example of bottom-up design because the parts are first created and then assembled without regard to how the parts will work in the assembly.]]

Top-down is a programming style, the mainstay of traditional procedural languages, in which design begins by specifying complex pieces and then dividing them into successively smaller pieces. The technique for writing a program using top–down methods is to write a main procedure that names all the major functions it will need. Later, the programming team looks at the requirements of each of those functions and the process is repeated. These compartmentalized sub-routines eventually will perform actions so simple they can be easily and concisely coded. When all the various sub-routines have been coded the program is ready for testing. By defining how the application comes together at a high level, lower level work can be self-contained. By defining how the lower level abstractions are expected to integrate into higher level ones, interfaces become clearly defined.

In a bottom-up approach, the individual base elements of the system are first specified in great detail. These elements are then linked together to form larger subsystems, which then in turn are linked, sometimes in many levels, until a complete top-level system is formed. This strategy often resembles a "seed" model, by which the beginnings are small, but eventually grow in complexity and completeness. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and computer programs. In mechanical engineering with software programs such as Pro/ENGINEER, Solidworks, and Autodesk Inventor users can design products as pieces not part of the whole and later add those pieces together to form assemblies like building with [[Lego]]. Engineers call this piece part design.

In a bottom-up approach, good intuition is necessary to decide the functionality that is to be provided by the module. If a system is to be built from an existing system, this approach is more suitable as it starts from some existing modules.

=== Parsing ===

[[Parsing]] is the process of analyzing an input sequence (such as that read from a file or a keyboard) in order to determine its grammatical structure. This method is used in the analysis of both [[natural language]]s and [[computer language]]s, as in a [[compiler]].

Bottom-up parsing is a strategy for analyzing unknown data relationships that attempts to identify the most fundamental units first, and then to infer higher-order structures from them. Top-down parsers, on the other hand, hypothesize general [[parse tree]] structures and then consider whether the known fundamental structures are compatible with the hypothesis. See [[Top-down parsing]] and [[Bottom-up parsing]].

== Nanotechnology ==
{{Main article|Nanotechnology}}

'''Top-down''' and '''bottom-up''' are two approaches for the manufacture of products. These terms were first applied to the field of nanotechnology by the [[Foresight Institute]] in 1989 in order to distinguish between molecular manufacturing (to mass-produce large atomically precise objects) and conventional manufacturing (which can mass-produce large objects that are not atomically precise). Bottom-up approaches seek to have smaller (usually [[Molecule|molecular]]) components built up into more complex assemblies, while top-down approaches seek to create nanoscale devices by using larger, externally controlled ones to direct their assembly. Certain valuable nanostructures, such as [[Silicon nanowire#Synthesis|Silicon nanowires]], can be fabricated using either approach, with processing methods selected on the basis of targeted applications.

The top-down approach often uses the traditional workshop or microfabrication methods where externally controlled tools are used to cut, mill, and shape materials into the desired shape and order. [[Micropatterning]] techniques, such as [[photolithography]] and [[inkjet printing]] belong to this category. Vapor treatment can be regarded as a  new top-down secondary approaches to engineer nanostructures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Saghaei|first1=Jaber|last2=Fallahzadeh|first2=Ali|last3=Saghaei|first3=Tayebeh|title=Vapor treatment as a new method for photocurrent enhancement of UV photodetectors based on ZnO nanorods|journal=Sensors and Actuators A: Physical|date=June 2016|volume=247|pages=150–155|doi=10.1016/j.sna.2016.05.050|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924424716302849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bottom-up approaches, in contrast, use the [[chemistry|chemical]] properties of single molecules to cause single-molecule components to (a) self-organize or self-assemble into some useful conformation, or (b) rely on positional assembly. These approaches utilize the concepts of [[molecular self-assembly]] and/or [[molecular recognition]]. See also [[Supramolecular chemistry]]. Such bottom-up approaches should, broadly speaking, be able to produce devices in parallel and much cheaper than top-down methods, but could potentially be overwhelmed as the size and complexity of the desired assembly increases.

== Neuroscience and psychology ==
[[Image:TheCat.png|thumb|right|An example of top-down processing: Even though the second letter in each word is ambiguous, top-down processing allows for easy disambiguation based on the context.]]

These terms are also employed in [[neuroscience]], [[cognitive neuroscience]] and [[cognitive psychology]] to discuss the flow of information in processing.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer (1981).{{page needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2017}} Typically [[Sensory system|sensory]] input is considered "bottom-up", and [[Executive functions|higher cognitive processes]], which have more information from other sources, are considered "top-down". A bottom-up process is characterized by an absence of higher level direction in sensory processing, whereas a top-down process is characterized by a high level of direction of sensory processing by more cognition, such as goals or targets (Beiderman, 19).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

According to college teaching notes written by Charles Ramskov,{{who|date=March 2017}} Rock, Neiser, and Gregory claim that top-down approach involves perception that is an active and constructive process.&lt;ref&gt;Ramskov (2008), p. 67.{{better source|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2017}} Additionally, it is an approach not directly given by stimulus input, but is the result of stimulus, internal hypotheses, and expectation interactions. According to Theoretical Synthesis, "when a stimulus is presented short and clarity is uncertain that gives a vague stimulus, perception becomes a top-down approach."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1935"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psychclassics.asu.edu/Stroop/ |title=Classics in the History of Psychology - Stroop (1935) |publisher=Psychclassics.asu.edu |date=August 15, 1934 |accessdate=October 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119172853/http://psychclassics.asu.edu/Stroop/ |archivedate=January 19, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, psychology defines bottom-up processing as an approach wherein there is a progression from the individual elements to the whole. According to Ramskov, one proponent of bottom-up approach, Gibson, claims that it is a process that includes visual perception that needs information available from proximal stimulus produced by the distal stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;Ramskov (2008).{{page needed|date=March 2017}}{{better source|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2017}}{{better source|date=March 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Solso (1998), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical Synthesis also claims that bottom-up processing occurs "when a stimulus is presented long and clearly enough."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1935"/&gt;

Cognitively speaking, certain cognitive processes, such as fast reactions or quick visual identification, are considered bottom-up processes because they rely primarily on sensory information, whereas processes such as [[motor system|motor]] control and [[Overt attention|directed attention]] are considered top-down because they are goal directed. Neurologically speaking, some areas of the brain, such as area [[Visual cortex#Primary visual cortex (V1)|V1]] mostly have bottom-up connections.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1935"/&gt; Other areas, such as the [[fusiform gyrus]] have inputs from higher brain areas and are considered to have top-down influence.&lt;ref&gt;Ramskov (2008), p. 81.{{better source|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2017}}

The study of [[Attention|visual attention]] provides an example. If your attention is drawn to a flower in a field, it may be because the color or shape of the flower are visually salient. The information that caused you to attend to the flower came to you in a bottom-up fashion—your attention was not contingent upon knowledge of the flower; the outside stimulus was sufficient on its own. Contrast this situation with one in which you are looking for a flower. You have a representation of what you are looking for. When you see the object you are looking for, it is salient. This is an example of the use of top-down information.

In cognitive terms, two thinking approaches are distinguished. "Top-down" (or "big chunk") is stereotypically the visionary, or the person who sees the larger picture and overview. Such people focus on the big picture and from that derive the details to support it. "Bottom-up" (or "small chunk") cognition is akin to focusing on the detail primarily, rather than the landscape. The expression "seeing the wood for the trees" references the two styles of cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Biederman | first1 = I. | last2 = Glass | first2 = A. L. | last3 = Stacy | first3 = E. W. | year = 1973 | title = Searching for objects in real world scenes | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 97 | issue = | pages = 22–27 | doi=10.1037/h0033776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management and organization ==
In the fields of management and organization, the terms "top-down" and "bottom-up" are used to describe how decisions are made and/or how change is implemented.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Greg L.|last2=Manges|first2=Kirstin A.|last3=Ward|first3=Marcia M.|title=Empowering Sustained Patient Safety|url=http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00001786-201507000-00009|journal=Journal of Nursing Care Quality|volume=30|issue=3|pages=240–246|doi=10.1097/ncq.0000000000000103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "''top-down''" approach is where an executive decision maker or other top person makes the decisions of how something should be done. This approach is disseminated under their authority to lower levels in the hierarchy, who are, to a greater or lesser extent, bound by them. For example, when wanting to make an improvement in a hospital, a hospital administrator might decide that a major change (such as implementing a new program) is needed, and then the leader uses a planned approach to drive the changes down to the frontline staff (Stewart, Manges, Ward, 2015).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A "''bottom-up''" approach to changes is one that works from the [[grassroots]]—from a large number of people working together, causing a decision to arise from their joint involvement. A decision by a number of activists, students, or victims of some incident to take action is a "bottom-up" decision. A bottom-up approach can be thought of as "an incremental change approach that represents an emergent process cultivated and upheld primarily by frontline workers" (Stewart, Manges, Ward, 2015, p.&amp;nbsp;241).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Positive aspects of top-down approaches include their efficiency and superb overview of higher levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, external effects can be internalized. On the negative side, if reforms are perceived to be imposed 'from above', it can be difficult for lower levels to accept them (e.g. Bresser-Pereira, Maravall, and Przeworski 1993). Evidence suggests this to be true regardless of the content of reforms (e.g. Dubois 2002). A bottom-up approach allows for more experimentation and a better feeling for what is needed at the bottom. Other evidence suggests that there is a third combination approach to change (see Stewart, Manges, Ward, 2015).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Public health===

Both top-down and bottom-up approaches exist in [[public health]]. There are many examples of top-down programs, often run by governments or large [[inter-governmental organizations]] (IGOs); many of these are disease-specific or issue-specific, such as [[HIV]] control or [[Smallpox]] [[Eradication of infectious diseases|Eradication]]. Examples of bottom-up programs include many small NGOs set up to improve local access to healthcare. However, a lot of programs seek to combine both approaches; for instance, [[guinea worm eradication]], a single-disease international program currently run by the [[Carter Center]] has involved the training of many local volunteers, boosting bottom-up capacity, as have international programs for hygiene, sanitation, and access to primary health-care.

== Architecture ==

Often, the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] school of design is said to have primarily promoted top-down design because it taught that an architectural design should begin with a [[parti pris|parti]], a basic plan drawing of the overall project.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

By contrast, the [[Bauhaus]] focused on bottom-up design. This method manifested itself in the study of translating small-scale organizational systems to a larger, more architectural scale (as with the woodpanel carving and furniture design).

== Ecology ==
In [[ecology]], top-down control refers to when a top predator controls the structure or population dynamics of the [[ecosystem]]. The classic example is of [[kelp forest]] ecosystems. In such ecosystems, [[sea otter]]s are a [[keystone species|keystone]] predator. They prey on [[Sea urchin|urchins]] which in turn eat [[kelp]]. When otters are removed, urchin populations grow and reduce the kelp forest creating [[urchin barren]]s. In other words, such ecosystems are not controlled by productivity of the kelp but rather a top predator.

Bottom-up control in ecosystems refers to ecosystems in which the nutrient supply and productivity and type of primary producers (plants and phytoplankton) control the ecosystem structure. An example would be how plankton populations are controlled by the availability of nutrients. Plankton populations tend to be higher and more complex in areas where upwelling brings nutrients to the surface.

There are many different examples of these concepts. It is common for populations to be influenced by both types of control.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4190">The '''World Organisation Against Torture''' (''Organisation Mondiale Contre la Torture''; '''OMCT''') is the world’s largest coalition of non-governmental organisations fighting against [[arbitrary detention]], [[torture]], [[summary execution|summary]] and [[extrajudicial execution]]s, [[forced disappearance]]s and other forms of [[violence]]. The global network consists of almost 300 local, national and regional organisations, which share the goal of eradicating torture and fostering respect of [[human rights]] for all.

The OMCT's ''Prevention of Torture'' programme helps its members prevent and report torture by strengthening their capacity through the SOS-Torture network to use [[United Nations]] [[human rights]] mechanisms. The programme submits alternative reports to UN Committees in collaboration with local [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, provides support for individuals and organisations wishing to challenge torture practices in international legal fora and publishes a practical guide on international and regional conventional mechanisms relevant to torture. OMCT is also [[Gender mainstreaming|mainstreaming]] women’s and children’s issues into the UN human rights mechanisms.

On 4 October 2007, former [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] became the new president of the OMCT Supporting Foundation.[http://www.omct.org/index.php?id=&amp;lang=eng&amp;actualPageNumber=1&amp;articleId=7286&amp;itemAdmin=article&amp;PHPSESSID=9d4fce0157f23ed08fa9ee8354df5124]

==Activities==
OMCT contributes to UN activities through three main activities.
===Reporting===
OMCT submits alternative reports to the UN [[United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture|Committee Against Torture]] (CAT), the [[Human Rights Committee]] (HRC) and the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC), working with local NGOs. 
Reporting activities are designed to encourage national NGOs to report torture and follow up reports of torture through:
*the participation of local NGOs in drafting alternative reports and actively including them in relevant Committees’ sessions, with the possibility of a follow-up meeting in the field;
*an integrated approach to questions relating to protection from torture and other ill-treatment of women and children, by involving organisations specialised in these issues in drafting alternative reports and in relevant Committees’ sessions;
*greater dissemination of reports and of the Conclusions and Recommendations of the Committees in English and in the preferred language of the relevant country, through the publication of the reports that have been submitted.

===Legal support===
OMCT supports individuals and organisations wishing to challenge torture practices in international legal forums. Complaint mechanisms can be used to achieve a number of different objectives including: 
*protection for victims or persons under threat; 
*obtaining [[reparation (legal)|reparations]] and [[Damages|compensation]] for victims; 
*putting pressure on governments to end [[impunity]] in specific cases; and 
*achieving changes in legislation and State practice which lead to serious human rights violations. 
Many NGOs are not fully aware of how to use UN procedures to support their work in protecting victims from torture. OMCT hopes to encourage and assist partner NGOs that are already active in the struggle against torture to present individual complaints and other relevant information to the CAT, the HRC, and the [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW).
===Practical guidance===
OMCT publishes a practical guide on international and regional conventional mechanisms relevant to torture. This Handbook is conceived as a tool for action. It addresses the practical needs of anybody using international mechanisms and bodies to challenge torture practices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4175">'''World art studies''' is an expression used to define studies in the discipline of [[art history]], which focus on the [[history of art|history of visual arts worldwide]], its methodology, concepts and approach. The expression is also used within the academic curricula as title for specific art history courses and schools.&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]] at the [[University of East Anglia]] in [[Norwich]], and the courses at the [[University of Leiden]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

There are several expressions related to World art studies which are often used as interchangeable. Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme, ''World Art Studies''in ''Art History and Visual Studies'' in Europe: Transnational Discourses and National Frameworks, eds. Matthew Rampley, Thierry Lenain, Hubert Locher, Brill, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; provide some more specific definitions as following

* ''World art studies'' is a concept conceived by the art historian [[John Onians]] in the early Nineties as a new field of studies, global and with a multidisciplinary approach.&lt;ref&gt;John Onians, ''World Art Studies and the Need for a New Natural History of Art'' in "Art Bulletin, n. 78, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary nature of World art studies differentiates them from ''world art history'' and ''global art history''. The expression ''World art studies'' was used by John Onians to rename the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]]. The concept of 'World art studies'' is similar to the concept of ''Bildwissenschaft'' or ''image-ology'' is equally multidisciplinary in its approach to analysis of visual images.&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme make reference to the publication edited by Klaus Sachs-Hombach ''Bildwissenschaft: Disziplinen, Themen, Methoden'', Surhkamp, Frankfurt am Main, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Global art history'' refers to the study of art in present and recent past with a focus on the art worldwide and interrelated phenomena. This definition relies on the distinction operated by [[Bruce Mazlish]] between ''global history'' and ''world history''.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Mazlish, ''An Introduction to Glocal History'' in ''Conceptualizing Global History'', ed. Bruce Mazlish and Ralph Buultjens, Westview Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''World art history'' refers to the study of art of the whole human history. A remark made to this expression is the use of the world ''history'' in singular (history and not histories); the use of the plural is preferred by [[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]], [[Real Spaces|Real Spaces: World Art History and the Rise of Western Modernism]], Phaidon Press, New York, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]], ''Stories of Art, Routledge, New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
