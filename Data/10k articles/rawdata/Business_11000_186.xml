{{Nihongo|'''American Club'''|アメリカンクラブ株式会社}} is a company based in the Hiramatsuhonchō (平松本町) district of [[Utsunomiya, Tochigi]], Japan which has been involved in the "[[eikaiwa]]" (English conversation) business.

Though the company primarily operated as an English school in the 1980s and '90s, according to its business registration it is also involved in numerous other business activities such as restaurants and bars, athletic clubs, hotels, printing/publishing, video and software rental and employment services.&lt;ref name="Feb. 10, 2011 Business Registration"&gt;[http://moriosugimoto.webstarts.com/index.html?r=20110516114404 アメリカンクラブ株式会社登記] (American Club Business Registration), Utsunomiya Legal Records Office, Feb. 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history ==
The American Club began operating on July 15, 1986,&lt;ref name="Feb. 10, 2011 Business Registration"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isaokonno.webstarts"&gt;[http://isaokonno.webstarts.com/index.html?r=20110516115155 「英会話教室の外国人講師ら」'''賃金支払い求め訴訟'''経営者不在のまま閉鎖」]''朝日新聞''　(''Asahi Shimbun''), Utsunomiya edition, Utsunomiya, Jan. 25, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and recruited students for English classes during the [[Japanese asset price bubble]] economy of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The classes were mainly taught by native English-speaking teachers from the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand. At its peak, it had a main school in [[Utsunomiya]], and six branch schools in [[Mibu]], [[Mooka, Tochigi|Mooka]], [[Oyama, Tochigi|Oyama]], [[Tochigi, Tochigi|Tochigi]] City (all in [[Tochigi Prefecture]]), [[Koga, Ibaraki|Koga]] (in [[Ibaraki Prefecture]]) and [[Sendai]] (in [[Miyagi Prefecture]]).

== Financial problems and first lawsuit over unpaid wages ==
After the burst of Japan's [[bubble economy]] in the early 1990s, the American Club began to suffer.&lt;ref name="isaokonno.webstarts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="和解書　Court agreement"&gt;和解書　(Court agreement), Dec. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.donmaclaren.com/networking_-_page_1.html?r=20130828100811 "The fall of American Club"] ''Networking'', Utsunomiya, Tochigi, Japan, Feb. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 1994, employees' wages were late.&lt;ref name="和解書　Court agreement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; By October of that year, the school had stopped paying wages at all.&lt;ref name="和解書　Court agreement"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;  A group of employees, led by Don MacLaren, subsequently organized, formed a branch union through Japan's [[National Union of General Workers]] and took the company's president, Hiroaki (aka "Morio") Sugimoto, and director, Isao (aka "Yasuaki") Konno, to court.&lt;ref name="isaokonno.webstarts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="和解書　Court agreement"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;National Union of General Workers Japan, Utsunomiya branch records, 1994-96&lt;/ref&gt;  These employees received three months in back wages on December 26, 1994, with a stipulation insisted on by Sugimoto that "teachers will refrain from damaging the company's reputation".&lt;ref name="和解書　Court agreement"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Though the school had serious problems making its payroll between 1994 and 1996,&lt;ref name="isaokonno.webstarts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="和解書　Court agreement"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; it continued to recruit and hire new employees (both before the December 1994 lawsuit and after it) from overseas through a broker in Vancouver, Canada, as well as from within Japan, through  ''[[The Japan Times]]'' "help wanted" ads.&lt;ref&gt;American Club teachers' contracts, 1994-1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheJapan"&gt;''The Japan Times'' help wanted ads, 1994-1995&lt;/ref&gt; Many of ''The Japan Times''' ads were for positions at an affiliated school Sugimoto ran - International Business and Language [[Vocational School#Japan|Senmon Gakkou]] (aka IBL, which according to its business registration is, like American Club, still a legally functioning entity).&lt;ref name="TheJapan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Feb. 10, 2011 IBL Registration"&gt;IBL Business Registration, Utsunomiya Legal Records Office, Feb. 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Sugimoto was the landlord of the American Club spaces in Utsunomiya, and collected rent from the American Club through another company he owns, Mimasu Shoji, when the schools' teachers and secretaries were not being paid.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;登記　(Business Registrations for real estate in Motoimaizumi, Utsunomiya), Utsunomiya Legal Records Office, Mar. 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

By December 1995 the school was again three months late paying employees' wages.&lt;ref name="isaokonno.webstarts" /&gt;  By this time Sugimoto had legally resigned his position as president of the company, and Konno became its president.&lt;ref name="Jan. 1996 Business Registration"&gt;アメリカンクラブ株式会社登記 (American Club Business Registration), Utsunomiya Legal Records Office, Jan. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the business registrations for the Oyama and Mooka schools, Sugimoto's name was the only one listed as being responsible for the school.&lt;ref&gt;アメリカンクラブ株式会社登記 (American Club Business Registration), Oyama Legal Records Office, November. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;アメリカンクラブ株式会社登記 (American Club Business Registration), Mooka Legal Records Office, Nov. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1996 New Year's holidays, Konno fled.&lt;ref name="isaokonno.webstarts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; In a letter to an American Club employee he claimed Sugimoto had threatened him and his (Konno's) wife with harassment from [[sound trucks in Japan|sound trucks]] operated by [[Uyoku dantai|right wing]] organizations if Konno tried to declare bankruptcy for the American Club.  In the letter Konno explained that because Sugimoto relied on the financial solvency of the American Club in order to obtain business loans, he (Sugimoto) could not afford to have the American Club be declared bankrupt by its own president.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konno, Isao, Letter to American Club, Feb. 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yasukiyamauchi.webstarts"&gt;[http://yasukiyamauchi.webstarts.com/index.html?r=20111027071802 "AC Update: Threat"] ''Networking'', Utsunomiya, Tochigi, Japan, Mar. 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, Yasuki Yamauchi of [[Fukuoka City]], more than 1,000 kilometers from Utsunomiya, assumed legal responsibility for the school.&lt;ref name="Jan. 1996 Business Registration" /&gt;  According to a January 25, 1996 article on the American Club in the ''[[Asahi Shinbun]]'', a reporter from the newspaper made a call to the company's phone number in Fukuoka, but the person who answered the phone hung up on the reporter.&lt;ref name="isaokonno.webstarts" /&gt; None of the teachers met Yamauchi, and with no one coming forward to take charge of the company, the teachers eventually stopped working for it. However, after the American Club stopped holding English classes in 1996, Sugimoto continued to run IBL (which was government-supported).&lt;ref&gt;インタナショナルビジネスランゲージ専門学校登記 (International Business and Language Senmon Gakkou Business Registration), Utsunomiya Legal Records Office, Dec. 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second lawsuit over unpaid wages ==
A second lawsuit was filed by employees for three months in unpaid wages in January 1996,&lt;ref&gt;Court ruling, 宇都宮裁判所 (Utsunomiya Courthouse), Jan. 22, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; but none of the company's directors showed up in court and they ignored the subsequent court order to pay.  Eventually the employees received 80% of their back wages through the Labor Standards Office of the Japanese government.&lt;ref&gt;Payments through Labor Standards Office, Utsunomiya, Feb. 1996-Sep. 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

With no income received after three months, many teachers returned to their home countries.  The total amount of delinquent wages owed all employees during the lawsuits totaled the equivalent of more than US$100,000. Also, students, who had paid in advance for as much as a year's worth of classes, lost an undetermined amount of money.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Court ruling, 宇都宮裁判所 (Utsunomiya courthouse), Jan. 22, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, rent on the company’s spaces in branch schools, as well as rent on the teachers’ apartments (which had been deducted by the company from teachers’ pay) was as much as a year in arrears by the time of the second lawsuit.&lt;ref name="isaokonno.webstarts" /&gt;

== News reports ==
During the course of the second lawsuit, in January 1996, articles were run in the local edition of Japanese language newspapers: The [[Asahi Shinbun]]&lt;ref name="isaokonno.webstarts" /&gt; and the [[Shimotsuke Shinbun]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://acaux1.webstarts.com/index.html?r=20111027070101 「'''賃金支払い求め英会話学校訴え'''宇都宮地裁に講師ら」]''下野新聞'' (''Shimotsuke Shinbun''), Utsunomiya, Jan. 26, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="acaux1.webstarts" /&gt;  Articles were also run by a local English language newspaper: Networking&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yasukiyamauchi.webstarts" /&gt; (now defunct).  The Networking articles outlined the root causes of the lawsuits (specifically the events leading up to the first lawsuit) and focused on the immigrant employees involved.  Later, several letters and essays MacLaren wrote were published in journals such as [[BusinessWeek]] and [[The Japan Times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1998-12-07/corruption-is-de-rigueur-in-corporate-japan |title=Corruption is de rigueur in corporate Japan |publisher=''BusinessWeek'' |date=1998-12-07 |accessdate=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://laborscofflaws.webstarts.com/human_rights.html "Labor scofflaws often go unpunished"] ''The Japan Times'', Tokyo, December 14, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Labor scofflaws still running amok," ''The Japan Times'', Tokyo, April 4, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/rc20111201a2.html |title=Don't count on a reformation |publisher=''The Japan Times''  |date=2011-12-01 |accessdate=2012-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whlreview.com/no-5.2/essay/DonMacLaren.pdf "The American Club and the Vermin of the Wilderness"] ''Wilderness House Literary Review'', summer, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Pros and cons of Japan bashing," ''Mainichi Daily News'', Tokyo, October 31, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jbash.webstarts.com/the_back_wages_of_sin.html "The back-wages of sin"] ''Mainichi Daily News'', Tokyo, April 19, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; MacLaren also provided The Japan Times with a list of organizations he had contacted in order to help resolve the pay problems, which the newspaper subsequently published on numerous occasions.&lt;ref&gt;"Useful telephone numbers," ''The Japan Times'', Tokyo, 1997-2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current status ==
Though published news reports indicated the American Club was closed,&lt;ref name="isaokonno.webstarts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Networking'', Utsunomiya, Feb. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and its directors ignored a court summons and subsequent court order to pay wages in the second lawsuit, its business registration indicates the company is still a legally operating entity, with 30 million yen in equity.&lt;ref name="Feb. 10, 2011 Business Registration"/&gt;

The business registration indicates that the [[Shimotsuke Shinbun]], a newspaper that ran stories on the lawsuits,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="acaux1.webstarts"&gt;[http://acaux1.webstarts.com/shimotsuke_shinbun_23_feb_1996.html?r=20111027065015 「'''講師の賃金支払い命令'''英会話学校へ宇地裁」]''下野新聞'' (''Shimotsuke Shinbun''), Utsunomiya, Feb. 23, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; advertises American Club's services in its pages.&lt;ref name="Feb. 10, 2011 Business Registration"/&gt;

'''Armand Vallin Feigenbaum''' (April 6, 1920&lt;ref name= "FindaGrave"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Legacy"/&gt; – November 13, 2014)  was an American [[quality control]] expert and businessman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Robert Cecil|title=Who's who in American Education: A Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Living Educators of the United States, Volume 22|year=1966|publisher=Who's Who in American Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; He devised the concept of Total Quality Control which inspired [[Total Quality Management]] (TQM).

==Biography==
[[File:Feigenbaum Hall 1.JPG|thumb|left|Feigenbaum Hall on the campus of Union College]]
Feigenbaum received a bachelor's degree from [[Union College]], his master's degree from the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], and his [[Ph.D.]] in Economics from [[MIT]].  He was Director of Manufacturing Operations at [[General Electric]] (1958–1968), and was later the President and [[CEO]] of General Systems Company of [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]], an engineering firm that helps companies define [[Business operating system (management)|business operating systems]].  Feigenbaum wrote several books and served as President of the [[American Society for Quality]] (1961–1963). On November 13, 2014, he died at the age of 94.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.union.edu/news/stories/2014/11/college-mourns-armand-v.-feigenbaum-42.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

His contributions to the quality body of knowledge include:

*"[[Total Quality Management|Total quality control]] is an effective system for integrating the quality development, quality maintenance, and quality improvement efforts of the various groups in an organization so as to enable production and service at the most economical levels which allow full customer satisfaction."
*The concept of a "hidden" plant—the idea that so much extra work is performed in correcting mistakes that there is effectively a hidden plant within any factory.
*Accountability for quality:  Because quality is everybody's job, it may become nobody's job—the idea that quality must be actively managed and have visibility at the highest levels of management.
*The concept of [[quality costs]]

{{Insolvency}}
'''Bankruptcy''' is a legal status of a person or [[legal person|other entity]] who cannot repay debts to [[creditor]]s. In most jurisdictions, bankruptcy is imposed by a [[court order]], often initiated by the [[debtor]].

Bankruptcy is not the only legal status that an insolvent person may have, and the term ''bankruptcy'' is therefore not a synonym for [[insolvency]]. In some countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]], bankruptcy is limited to individuals; other forms of insolvency proceedings (such as [[liquidation]] and [[Administration (law)|administration]]) are applied to companies. In the [[United States]], ''bankruptcy'' is applied more broadly to formal insolvency proceedings. In France, the cognate French word ''banqueroute'' is used solely for cases of fraudulent bankruptcy, whereas the term ''faillite'' (cognate of "failure") is used for bankruptcy in accordance with the law.&lt;ref&gt;(fr) Dictionnaire Le Petit Larousse 2013, p 104 &amp; 446&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''bankruptcy'' is derived from Italian ''banca rotta'', meaning "broken bank", which may stem from a widespread custom in the [[Republic of Genoa]] of breaking a moneychanger's bench or counter to signify his insolvency, or which may be only a figure of speech.&lt;ref name="Loveland1912"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Olds Loveland|title=A treatise on the law and proceedings in bankruptcy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqE9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA4|year=1912|publisher=The W.

==History==
{{Main|History of bankruptcy law}}
[[File:John Law cartoon (1720).png|thumb|upright=0.8|Failure of [[John Law (economist)|John Law]]'s [[Mississippi Company]] led to French national bankruptcy in 1720.]]

In [[Ancient Greece]], bankruptcy did not exist. If a man owed and he could not pay, he and his wife, children or servants were forced into "[[debt slavery]]", until the creditor recouped losses through their [[Manual labour|physical labour]]. Many [[Polis|city-states]]  in ancient Greece limited debt slavery to a period of five years; debt slaves had protection of life and limb, which regular slaves did not enjoy. However, servants of the debtor could be retained beyond that [[Time limit|deadline]] by the creditor and were often forced to serve their new lord for a lifetime, usually under significantly harsher conditions. An exception to this rule was [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], which by the [[Solonian Constitution|laws]] of [[Solon]] forbade enslavement for debt; as a consequence, most Athenian slaves were foreigners (Greek or otherwise).

The [[Statute of Bankrupts Act 1542|Statute of Bankrupts]] of 1542 was the first statute under [[English law]] dealing with bankruptcy or [[insolvency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Bankruptcy |first=Edward William Donoghue |last=Manson |volume=3 |page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bankruptcy is also documented in [[East Asia]]. According to [[al-Maqrizi]], the [[Yassa]] of [[Genghis Khan]] contained a provision that mandated the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for anyone who became bankrupt three times.

A failure of a nation to meet bond repayments has been seen on many occasions. [[Philip II of Spain]] had to declare four [[sovereign default|state bankruptcies]] in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596. According to Kenneth S. Rogoff, "Although the development of international capital markets was quite limited prior to 1800, we nevertheless catalog the various defaults of [[France]], [[Portugal]], [[Prussia]], [[Spain]], and the early Italian city-states. At the edge of Europe, Egypt, Russia, and Turkey have histories of chronic default as well."&lt;ref&gt;Carmen M. Reinhart, Kenneth S. Rogoff (2009). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ak5fLB24ircC&amp;pg=&amp;dq=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false This time is different: eight centuries of financial folly]''". Princeton University Press. p.30. {{ISBN|0-691-14216-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern law and debt restructuring==
The principal focus of modern insolvency legislation and business [[debt restructuring]] practices no longer rests on the elimination of insolvent entities, but on the remodeling of the financial and organizational structure of debtors experiencing [[financial distress]] so as to permit the rehabilitation and continuation of the business.

For private households, some argue that it is insufficient to merely dismiss debts after a certain period {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. It is important to assess the underlying problems and to minimize the risk of financial distress to re-occur. It has been stressed that debt advice, a supervised rehabilitation period, financial education and social help to find sources of income and to improve the management of household expenditures must be equally provided during this period of rehabilitation (Refiner ''et al.'', 2003; Gerhardt, 2009; Frade, 2010). In most EU Member States, debt discharge is conditioned by a partial payment obligation and by a number of requirements concerning the debtor's behavior. In the United States (US), discharge is conditioned to a lesser extent. The spectrum is broad in the EU, with the UK coming closest to the US system (Reifner et al., 2003; Gerhardt, 2009; Frade, 2010). The Other Member States do not provide the option of a debt discharge. Spain, for example, passed a bankruptcy law (''ley concurs'') in 2003 which provides for debt settlement plans that can result in a reduction of the debt (maximally half of the amount) or an extension of the payment period of maximally five years (Gerhardt, 2009), but it does not foresee debt discharge.&lt;ref&gt;Dubois &amp; Anderson (2010) Managing household debts: Social service provision in the EU. Working paper. Dublin: European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. [http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/socialprotection/householdebts.htm euro found.europa.eu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107145903/http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/socialprotection/householdebts.htm |date=2013-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, it is very difficult to discharge federal or federally guaranteed student loan debt by filing bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ferral|first1=Katelyn|title=Narrow bankruptcy laws make it nearly impossible to discharge student debt|url=http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/narrow-bankruptcy-laws-make-it-nearly-impossible-to-discharge-student/article_927360b1-48c0-5f4c-978b-fcffe910f490.html|accessdate=13 March 2018|agency=The Cap Times|publisher=Madison.com|date=28 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313214310/http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/narrow-bankruptcy-laws-make-it-nearly-impossible-to-discharge-student/article_927360b1-48c0-5f4c-978b-fcffe910f490.html|archivedate=13 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most other debts, those student loans may be discharged only if the person seeking discharge establishes specific grounds for discharge under the ''Brunner'' test,&lt;ref name=brunner&gt;{{cite web|last1=Treff|first1=Leslie|title="Undue Hardship" Under Section 523(a)(8): Can the Debtor's Student Loans Be Discharged?|url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/bankruptcy/b/bankruptcy-law-blog/archive/2012/08/30/quot-undue-hardship-quot-under-section-523-a-8-can-the-debtor-s-student-loans-be-discharged.aspx|website=LexisNexis Legal Newsroom|accessdate=13 March 2018|date=29 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314042415/https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/bankruptcy/b/bankruptcy-law-blog/archive/2012/08/30/quot-undue-hardship-quot-under-section-523-a-8-can-the-debtor-s-student-loans-be-discharged.aspx|archivedate=14 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; under which the court evaluates three factors:
* If required to repay the loan, the borrower cannot maintain a minimal standard of living;
* The borrower's financial situation is likely to continue for most or all of the repayment period; and
* The borrower has made a good faith effort to repay the student loans.&lt;ref name=brunner/&gt;
Even if a debtor proves all three elements, a court may permit only a partial discharge of the student loan. Student loan borrowers may benefit from restructuring their payments through a [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13]] bankruptcy repayment plan, but few qualify for discharge of part or all of their student loan debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerson|first1=Seth J.|title=Separate Classification of Student Loans in Chapter 13|journal=Washington University Law Quarterly|date=January 1995|volume=73|issue=1|page=269|url=http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_lawreview/vol73/iss1/5|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223001445/http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_lawreview/vol73/iss1/5/|archivedate=2017-02-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fraud==
Bankruptcy [[fraud]] is a [[white-collar crime]]. While difficult to generalize across jurisdictions, common criminal acts under bankruptcy statutes typically involve concealment of assets, concealment or destruction of documents, conflicts of interest, fraudulent claims, false statements or declarations, and [[Fee fixing scandal|fee fixing]] or redistribution arrangements. Falsifications on bankruptcy forms often constitute [[perjury]]. Multiple filings are not in and of themselves criminal, but they may violate provisions of bankruptcy law. In the U.S., bankruptcy fraud statutes are particularly focused on the [[Mens rea|mental state]] of particular actions.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' 140 Cong. Rec. S14, 461 (daily ed. Oct. 6, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' 18 U.S.C. sec 152. [http://trac.syr.edu/laws/18USC152.html trac.syr.edu.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725123135/http://www.trac.syr.edu/laws/18USC152.html |date=2008-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bankruptcy fraud is a [[federal crime]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=18 U.S. Code § 157|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/html/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap9-sec157.htm|website=GPO|publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office|accessdate=14 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507212528/https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/html/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap9-sec157.htm|archivedate=7 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bankruptcy fraud should be distinguished from ''[[strategic bankruptcy]]'', which is not a [[crime|criminal]] act since it creates a real (not a fake) bankruptcy state. However, it may still work against the filer.

All assets must be disclosed in bankruptcy schedules whether or not the debtor believes the asset has a [[net value]]. This is because once a bankruptcy petition is filed, it is for the creditors, not the debtor, to decide whether a particular asset has value. The future ramifications of omitting assets from schedules can be quite serious for the offending debtor. In the United States, a closed bankruptcy may be reopened by motion of a creditor or the U.S. trustee if a debtor attempts to later assert ownership of such an "unscheduled asset" after being discharged of all debt in the bankruptcy. The trustee may then seize the asset and liquidate it for the benefit of the (formerly discharged) creditors. Whether or not a concealment of such an asset should also be considered for prosecution as fraud or [[perjury]] would then be at the discretion of the judge or U.S. Trustee.

To declare bankruptcy or for a creditor to lodge a petition, the debt must be at least $5,000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

All bankrupts must lodge a Statement of Affairs document with AFSA, which includes important information about their assets and liabilities. A bankruptcy cannot be annulled until this document has been lodged.

Ordinarily, a bankruptcy lasts three years from the filing of the Statement of Affairs with AFSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s149.html|title=BANKRUPTCY ACT 1966 - SECT 149 Automatic discharge|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2017-01-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131191832/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s149.html|archivedate=2017-01-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Bankruptcy Trustee (in most cases, the Official Receiver) is appointed to deal with all matters regarding the administration of the bankrupt estate. The Trustee's job includes notifying creditors of the estate and dealing with creditor inquiries; ensuring that the bankrupt complies with their obligations under the Bankruptcy Act; investigating the bankrupt's financial affairs; realising funds to which the estate is entitled under the Bankruptcy Act and distributing dividends to creditors if sufficient funds become available.

For the duration of their bankruptcy, all bankrupts have certain restrictions placed upon them. For example, a bankrupt must obtain the permission of their trustee to travel overseas. Failure to do so may result in the bankrupt being stopped at the airport by the Australian Federal Police. Additionally, a bankrupt is required to provide their trustee with details of income and assets. If the bankrupt does not comply with the Trustee's request to provide details of income, the trustee may have grounds to lodge an Objection to Discharge, which has the effect of extending the bankruptcy for a further five years.

The realisation of funds usually comes from two main sources: the bankrupt's assets and the bankrupt's wages. There are certain assets that are protected, referred to as ''protected assets''. These include household furniture and appliances, tools of the trade and vehicles up to a certain value. All other assets of value are sold. If a house or car is above a certain value, the bankrupt can buy the interest back from the estate in order to keep the asset. If the bankrupt does not do this, the interest vests in the estate and the trustee is able to take possession of the asset and sell it.

The bankrupt must pay income contributions if their income is above a certain threshold. If the bankrupt fails to pay, the trustee can issue a notice to garnishee the bankrupt's wages. If that is not possible, the Trustee may seek to extend the bankruptcy for a further five years.

Bankruptcies can be annulled prior to the expiration of the normal three-year period if all debts are paid out in full. Sometimes a bankrupt may be able to raise enough funds to make an Offer of Composition to creditors, which would have the effect of paying the creditors some of the money they are owed. If the creditors accept the offer, the bankruptcy can be annulled after the funds are received.

After the bankruptcy is annulled or the bankrupt has been automatically discharged, the bankrupt's credit report status is shown as "discharged bankrupt" for some years. The maximum number of years this information can be held is subject to the retention limits under the Privacy Act.  How long such information is on a credit report may be shorter, depending on the issuing company, but the report must cease to record that information based on the criteria in the Privacy Act.

===Brazil===
In [[Brazil]], the Bankruptcy Law (11.101/05) governs court-ordered or out-of-court receivership and bankruptcy and only applies to public companies (publicly traded companies) with the exception of financial institutions, credit cooperatives, consortia, supplementary scheme entities, companies administering health care plans, equity companies and a few other legal entities. It does not apply to state-run companies.

Current law covers three legal proceedings. The first one is bankruptcy itself ("Falência"). Bankruptcy is a court-ordered liquidation procedure for an insolvent business. The final goal of bankruptcy is to liquidate company assets and pay its creditors.

The second one is Court-ordered Restructuring (''Recuperação Judicial''). The goal is to overcome the business crisis situation of the debtor in order to allow the continuation of the producer, the employment of workers and the interests of creditors, leading, thus, to preserving company, its corporate function and develop economic activity. It's a court procedure required by the debtor which has been in business for more than two years and requires approval by a judge.

The Extrajudicial Restructuring (''Recuperação Extrajudicial'') is a private negotiation that involves creditors and debtors and, as with court-ordered restructuring, also must be approved by courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2004-2006/2005/Lei/L11101.htm |title=Brazil.

===Canada===
{{Main|Insolvency law of Canada}}
Bankruptcy, also referred to as insolvency in Canada, is governed by the [[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]] and is applicable to businesses and individuals, for example, [[Target Canada]], the Canadian subsidiary of the [[Target Corporation]], the second-largest [[Discount store|discount retailer]] in the United States filed for bankruptcy in January 15, 2015, and closed all of its stores by April 12. The office of the [[Superintendent of Bankruptcy]], a [[federal government of Canada|federal agency]], is responsible for overseeing that bankruptcies are administered in a fair and orderly manner by all licensed Trustees in Canada.

Trustees in bankruptcy, 1041 individuals licensed to administer insolvencies, bankruptcy and proposal estates and are governed by the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act of Canada.

Bankruptcy is filed when a person or a company becomes insolvent and cannot pay their debts as they become due and if they have at least $1,000 in debt.

In 2011, the Superintendent of bankruptcy reported that trustees in Canada filed 127,774 insolvent estates. Consumer estates were the vast majority, with 122 999 estates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br02805.html |title=Insolvency Statistics in Canada—2011 (Table 2) - Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada |publisher=Ic.gc.ca |accessdate=2013-07-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629074911/http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br02805.html |archivedate=2013-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The consumer portion of the 2011 volume is divided into 77,993 bankruptcies and 45,006 consumer proposals. This represented a reduction of 8.9% from 2010. Commercial estates filed by Canadian trustees in 2011 4,775 estates, 3,643 bankruptcies and 1,132 Division 1 proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br02808.html |title=Insolvency Statistics in Canada—2011 (Table 3) - Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada |publisher=Ic.gc.ca |accessdate=2013-07-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629065408/https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br02808.html |archivedate=2013-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents a reduction of 8.6% over 2010.

;Duties of trustees:
Some of the duties of the trustee in bankruptcy are to:
* Review the file for any fraudulent preferences or reviewable transactions
* Chair meetings of creditors
* Sell any non-exempt assets
* Object to the bankrupt's discharge
* Distribute funds to creditors

;Creditors' meetings:
Creditors become involved by attending creditors' meetings. The [[trustee]] calls the first meeting of creditors for the following purposes:
* To consider the affairs of the bankrupt
* To affirm the appointment of the trustee or substitute another in place thereof
* To appoint inspectors
* To give such directions to the trustee as the creditors may see fit with reference to the administration of the estate.

;Consumer proposals:
{{Main|Consumer bankruptcy in Canada}}
In Canada, a person can file a consumer proposal as an alternative to bankruptcy. A consumer proposal is a negotiated settlement between a debtor and their creditors.

A typical proposal would involve a debtor making monthly payments for a maximum of five years, with the funds distributed to their creditors. Even though most proposals call for payments of less than the full amount of the debt owing, in most cases, the creditors accept the deal—because if they do not, the next alternative may be personal bankruptcy, in which the creditors get even less money. The creditors have 45 days to accept or reject the consumer proposal. Once the proposal is accepted by both the creditors and the Court, the debtor makes the payments to the Proposal Administrator each month (or as otherwise stipulated in their proposal), and the general creditors are prevented from taking any further legal or collection action. If the proposal is rejected, the debtor is returned to his prior insolvent state and may have no alternative but to declare personal bankruptcy.

A consumer proposal can only be made by a debtor with debts to a maximum of $250,000 (not including the mortgage on their principal residence). If debts are greater than $250,000, the proposal must be filed under Division 1 of Part III of the [[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada)|Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]. An Administrator is required in the Consumer Proposal, and a Trustee in the Division I Proposal (these are virtually the same although the terms are not interchangeable). A Proposal Administrator is almost always a licensed [[trustee]] in bankruptcy, although the [[Superintendent of Bankruptcy]] may appoint other people to serve as administrators.

In 2006, there were 98,450 personal insolvency filings in Canada: 79,218 bankruptcies and 19,232 consumer proposals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/en/br01702e.html "Insolvency in Canada in 2006"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329033435/http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/en/br01702e.html |date=March 29, 2007 }}: Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy ([[Industry Canada]]).

{{Main|Bankruptcy in China}}
The People's Republic of China legalized bankruptcy in 1986, and a revised law that was more expansive and complete was enacted in 2007.

===Ireland===
[[Bankruptcy in the Republic of Ireland|Bankruptcy in Ireland]] applies only to [[natural person]]s. Other insolvency processes including [[liquidation]] and [[examinership]] are used to deal with corporate insolvency.

Irish bankruptcy law has been the subject of significant comment, from both government sources and the media, as being in need of reform. Part 7 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011&lt;ref name=ACTOF2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0023/sec0030.html#part7|title=Part 7 of the Civil Law Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2011|accessdate=21 September 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119020212/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0023/sec0030.html#part7|archivedate=19 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has started this process and the government has committed to further reform.

===India===
{{update|section|date=December 2016}}
{{Main|Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code}}
The [[Parliament of India]] in the first week of May 2016 passed [[Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code]] 2016 (New Code). Earlier a clear law on corporate bankruptcy did not exist, even though individual bankruptcy laws have been in existence since 1874. The earlier law in force was enacted in 1920 called the Provincial Insolvency Act.

The legal definitions of the terms bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation and dissolution are contested in the Indian legal system. There is no regulation or statute legislated upon bankruptcy which denotes a condition of inability to meet a demand of a creditor as is common in many other jurisdictions.

Winding up of companies was in the jurisdiction of the courts which can take a decade even after the company has actually been declared insolvent. On the other hand, supervisory restructuring at the behest of the [[Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction]] is generally undertaken using receivership by a public entity.

===The Netherlands===
Dutch bankruptcy law is governed by the Dutch Bankruptcy Code (''Faillissementswet''). The code covers three separate legal proceedings. 
* The first is the bankruptcy (''faillissement''). The goal of the bankruptcy is the liquidation of the assets of the company. The bankruptcy applies to individuals and companies. 
* The second legal proceeding in the ''Faillissementswet'' is the ''surseance van betaling''. The ''surseance van betaling'' only applies to companies. Its goal is to reach an agreement with the creditors of the company. Its is comparable to filing for protection against creditors. 
* The third proceeding is the ''schuldsanering''. This proceeding is designed for individuals only and is the result of a court ruling. The judge appoints a monitor. The monitor is an independent third party who monitors the individual's ongoing business and decides about financial matters during the period of the ''schuldsanering''. The individual can travel out of the country freely after the judge's decision on the case.

=== Russia ===
{{Main|Insolvency law of Russia}}
Federal Law No. 127-FZ "On Insolvency (Bankruptcy)" dated 26 October 2002 (as amended) (the "Bankruptcy Act"), replacing the previous law in 1998, to better address the above problems and a broader failure of the action.
Russian insolvency law is intended for a wide range of borrowers: individuals and companies of all sizes, with the exception of state-owned enterprises, government agencies, political parties and religious organizations. There are also special rules for insurance companies, professional participants of the securities market, agricultural organizations and other special laws for financial institutions and companies in the [[natural monopoly|natural monopolies]] in the energy industry.
Federal Law No. 40-FZ "On Insolvency (Bankruptcy)" dated 25 February 1999 (as amended) (the "Insolvency Law of Credit Institutions") contains special provisions in relation to the opening of insolvency proceedings in relation to the credit company. Insolvency Provisions Act, credit organizations used in conjunction with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.

Bankruptcy law provides for the following stages of insolvency proceedings:
• Monitoring procedure or Supervision (nablyudeniye);
• The economic recovery (finansovoe ozdorovleniye);
• External control (vneshneye upravleniye);
• Liquidation (konkursnoye proizvodstvo) and
• Amicable Agreement (mirovoye soglasheniye).

The main face of the bankruptcy process is the [http://arbir.ru/contact-insolvency-officer-cheskidov-roman.htm insolvency officer (trustee in bankruptcy, bankruptcy manager)]. At various stages of bankruptcy, he must be determined: the temporary officer in Monitoring procedure, external manager in External control, the receiver or administrative officer in The economic recovery, the liquidator. During the bankruptcy trustee in bankruptcy (insolvency officer) has a decisive influence on the movement of assets (property) of the debtor - the debtor and has a key influence on the economic and legal aspects of its operations.

===South Africa===
{{Main|South African insolvency law}}

===Switzerland===
{{Main|Insolvency law of Switzerland}}
Under [[Switzerland|Swiss]] law, bankruptcy can be a consequence of [[insolvency]]. It is a court-ordered form of debt enforcement proceedings that applies, in general, to registered commercial entities only. In a bankruptcy, all assets of the debtor are liquidated under the administration of the creditors, although the law provides for debt restructuring options similar to those under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, bankruptcy (Swedish: konkurs) is a formal process that may involve a company or individual. It is not the same as [[insolvency]], which is inability to pay debts that should have been paid. A creditor or the company itself can apply for bankruptcy. An external bankruptcy manager takes over the company or the assets of the person, and tries to sell as much as possible. A person or a company in bankruptcy can not access its assets (with some exceptions).

The formal bankruptcy process is rarely carried out for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skatteverket.se/konkurs/vadarkonkurs.4.14db52b102ed4e5fe380002973.html |title=Konkurs&amp;nbsp;– Vad är konkurs? |language=sv |publisher=Skatteverket.se |date=2009-05-28 |accessdate=2012-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809022942/http://www.skatteverket.se/konkurs/vadarkonkurs.4.14db52b102ed4e5fe380002973.html |archivedate=2011-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Creditors can claim money through the [[Enforcement Administration (Sweden)|Enforcement Administration]] anyway, and creditors do not usually benefit from the bankruptcy of individuals because there are costs of a [[Trustee in bankruptcy|bankruptcy manager]] which has priority. Unpaid debts remain after bankruptcy for individuals. People who are deeply in debt can obtain a debt arrangement procedure (Swedish: skuldsanering). On application, they obtain a payment plan under which they pay as much as they can for five years, and then all remaining debts are cancelled. Debts that derive from a ban on business operations (issued by court, commonly for tax fraud or fraudulent business practices) or owed to a crime victim as compensation for damages, are exempted from this—and, as before this process was introduced in 2006, remain lifelong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fattiga.se/news.php?item.51.6 |title=Evighetsgäldenärer, synpunkter från Skatteverket 2004 Skatteverkets skrivelse 041229 |language=sv |publisher=Fattiga.se |accessdate=2012-04-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314232824/http://www.fattiga.se/news.php?item.51.6 |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Debts that have not been claimed during a 3-10 year period are cancelled. Often crime victims stop their claims after a few years since criminals often do not have job incomes and might be hard to locate, while banks make sure their claims are not cancelled. The most common reasons for personal insolvency in Sweden are illness, unemployment, divorce or company bankruptcy.

For companies, formal bankruptcy is a normal effect of insolvency, even if there is a reconstruction mechanism where the company can be given time to solve its situation, e.g. by finding an investor. The formal bankruptcy involves contracting a bankruptcy manager, who makes certain that assets are sold and money divided by the priority the law claims, and no other way. Banks have such a priority. After a finished bankruptcy for a company, it is terminated. The activities might continue in a new company which has bought important assets from the bankrupted company.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|UK insolvency law|Liquidation|Administration (insolvency)}}
[[Bankruptcy in the United Kingdom]] (in a strict legal sense) relates only to individuals (including [[Sole Trader Insolvency|sole proprietors]]) and [[partnership]]s. Companies and other [[corporation]]s enter into differently named legal insolvency procedures: [[liquidation]] and [[administration (law)|administration]] ([[administration order]] and [[administrative receivership]]). However, the term 'bankruptcy' is often used when referring to companies in the media and in general conversation. Bankruptcy in Scotland is referred to as [[sequestration (law)|sequestration]]. To apply for bankruptcy in Scotland, an individual must have more than £1,500 of debt.

A [[trustee in bankruptcy]] must be either an [[Official Receiver]] (a civil servant) or a licensed [[insolvency practitioner]]. Current law in England and Wales derives in large part from the [[Insolvency Act 1986]]. Following the introduction of the [[Enterprise Act 2002]], a UK bankruptcy now normally last no longer than 12 months, and may be less if the Official Receiver files in court a certificate that investigations are complete. It was expected that the UK Government's liberalisation of the UK bankruptcy regime would increase the number of bankruptcy cases; initially, cases increased, as the Insolvency Service statistics appear to bear out. Since 2009, the introduction of the [[Debt Relief Order]] has resulted in a dramatic fall in bankruptcies, the latest estimates for year 2014/15 being significantly less than 30,000 cases.

A debtor declares bankruptcy to obtain relief from debt, and this is normally accomplished either through a discharge of the debt or through a restructuring of the debt. When a debtor files a voluntary petition, their bankruptcy case commences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 U.S. Code § 301 - Voluntary cases|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/301|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019221326/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/301|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Debts and exemptions====
While bankruptcy cases are always filed in [[United States Bankruptcy Court]] (an adjunct to the [[U.S. District Courts]]), bankruptcy cases, particularly with respect to the validity of claims and exemptions, are often dependent upon State law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 U.S. Code § 522 - Exemptions|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/522|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809225102/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/522|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Bankruptcy Exemption defines the property a debtor may retain and preserve through bankruptcy. Certain real and personal property can be exempted on "Schedule C"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/RulesAndPolicies/rules/BK_Forms_Official_2010/B_006C_0410.pdf |title=Schedule C- Property Claimed as Exempt |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610221416/http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/RulesAndPolicies/rules/BK_Forms_Official_2010/B_006C_0410.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of a debtor's bankruptcy forms, and effectively be taken outside the debtor's bankruptcy estate. Bankruptcy exemptions are available only to individuals filing bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/Bankruptcy/BankruptcyBasics/Glossary.aspx |title=Bankruptcy Exemptions Available to Individuals |publisher=Uscourts.gov |accessdate=2014-03-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310230239/http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/Bankruptcy/BankruptcyBasics/Glossary.aspx |archivedate=2014-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two alternative systems that can be used to "exempt" property from a bankruptcy estate, federal exemptions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/522 |title=Federal Bankruptcy Exemptions: 11 USC § 522 |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=2014-03-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226000317/http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/522 |archivedate=2014-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (available in some states but not all), and state exemptions (which vary widely between states). For example, Maryland and Virginia, which are adjoining states, have different personal exemption amounts that cannot be seized for payment of debts. This amount is the first $6,000 in property or cash in Maryland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Maryland, Sec. 11–504|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmStatutesText.aspx?article=gcj&amp;section=11-504&amp;ext=html&amp;session=2018RS&amp;tab=subject5|website=General Assembly of Maryland|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019220929/http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmStatutesText.aspx?article=gcj&amp;section=11-504&amp;ext=html&amp;session=2018RS&amp;tab=subject5|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but normally only the first $5,000 in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Virginia, Sec. 34-4. Exemption created.|url=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title34/chapter2/section34-4/|website=Legislative Information System|publisher=Commonwealth of Virginia|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019221510/https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title34/chapter2/section34-4/|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; State law therefore plays a major role in many bankruptcy cases, such that there may be significant differences in the outcome of a bankruptcy case depending upon the state in which it is filed.

After a bankruptcy petition is filed, the court schedules a hearing called a ''341 meeting'' or ''meeting of creditors'', at which the bankruptcy trustee and creditors review the petitioner's petition and supporting schedules, question the petitioner, and can challenge exemptions they believe are improper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a 341(a) Meeting of Creditors?|url=http://www.canb.uscourts.gov/faq/general-bankruptcy/what-341a-meeting-creditors|website=United States Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of California|publisher=United States Courts|accessdate=14 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611070109/http://www.canb.uscourts.gov/faq/general-bankruptcy/what-341a-meeting-creditors|archivedate=11 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chapters====
There are six types of bankruptcy under the [[Title 11 of the United States Code|Bankruptcy Code]], located at Title 11 of the [[United States Code]]:
* [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]]: basic liquidation for individuals and businesses; also known as straight bankruptcy; it is the simplest and quickest form of bankruptcy available
* [[Chapter 9, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 9]]: municipal bankruptcy; a federal mechanism for the resolution of municipal debts
* [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]]: rehabilitation or reorganization, used primarily by business debtors, but sometimes by individuals with substantial debts and assets; known as corporate bankruptcy, it is a form of corporate financial reorganisation which typically allows companies to continue to function while they follow debt repayment plans
* [[Chapter 12, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 12]]: rehabilitation for family farmers and fishermen;
* [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13]]: rehabilitation with a payment plan for individuals with a regular source of income; enables individuals with regular income to develop a plan to repay all or part of their debts; also known as Wage Earner Bankruptcy
* [[Chapter 15, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 15]]: ancillary and other international cases; provides a mechanism for dealing with bankruptcy debtors and helps foreign debtors to clear debts.

An important feature applicable to all types of bankruptcy filings is the [[automatic stay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 U.S. Code § 362 - Automatic stay|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/362|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827104847/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/362|archivedate=27 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The automatic stay means that the mere request for bankruptcy protection automatically halts most lawsuits, repossessions, foreclosures, evictions, garnishments, attachments, utility shut-offs, and debt collection activity.

The most common types of [[personal bankruptcy]] for individuals are Chapter 7 and Chapter 13. Chapter 7, known as a "straight bankruptcy" involves the discharge of certain debts without repayment. Chapter 13, involves a plan of repayment of debts over a period of years. Whether a person qualifies for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 is in part determined by income.&lt;ref name="C7Basics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 7 Basics|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-7-bankruptcy-basics|website=United States Courts|publisher=Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts|accessdate=14 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629140922/http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-7-bankruptcy-basics|archivedate=29 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 7 Means Test Calculation|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/form_b_122a-2.pdf|website=United States Courts|publisher=Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts|accessdate=14 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501105632/http://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/form_b_122a-2.pdf|archivedate=1 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 65% of all U.S. consumer bankruptcy filings are Chapter 7 cases.

Before a consumer may obtain bankruptcy relief under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13, the debtor is to undertake [[credit counselling]] with approved counseling agencies prior to filing a bankruptcy petition and to undertake education in personal financial management from approved agencies prior to being granted a discharge of debts under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13. Some studies of the operation of the credit counseling requirement suggest that it provides little benefit to debtors who receive the counseling because the only realistic option for many is to seek relief under the Bankruptcy Code.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Yvonne D. (2007). "Bankruptcy Reform: Value of Credit Counseling Requirement Is Not Clear (GAO-07-203)". Washington, D.C.: Government Accountability Office. p. (Highlights). {{LCCN|2007414394}}. {{OCLC|156274430}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporations and other business forms normally file under Chapters 7 or 11.

=====Chapter 7=====
{{main|Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code}}
Often called "straight bankruptcy" or "simple bankruptcy," a Chapter 7 bankruptcy potentially allows debtors to eliminate most or all of their debts over a period of as little as three or four months. In a typical consumer bankruptcy, the only debts that survive a Chapter 7 are [[student loan]]s, [[child support]] obligations, some tax bills and criminal fines. Credit cards, pay day loans, personal loans, medical bills, and just about all other bills are discharged.

In Chapter 7, a debtor surrenders non-exempt property to a bankruptcy trustee, who then liquidates the property and distributes the proceeds to the debtor's unsecured creditors. In exchange, the debtor is entitled to a discharge of some debt. However, the debtor is not granted a discharge if guilty of certain types of inappropriate behavior (e.g., concealing records relating to financial condition) and certain debts (e.g., spousal and child support and most student loans). Some taxes are not discharged even though the debtor is generally discharged from debt. Many individuals in financial distress own only exempt property (e.g., clothes, household goods, an older car, or the tools of their trade or profession) and do not have to surrender any property to the trustee.&lt;ref name="C7Basics"/&gt; The amount of property that a debtor may exempt varies from state to state (as noted above, Virginia and Maryland have a $1,000 difference.) Chapter 7 relief is available only once in any eight-year period. Generally, the rights of secured creditors to their collateral continues, even though their debt is discharged. For example, absent some arrangement by a debtor to surrender a car or "reaffirm" a debt, the creditor with a [[security interest]] in the debtor's car may repossess the car even if the debt to the creditor is discharged.

Ninety-one percent of U.S. individuals who petition for relief under Chapter 7 hire an attorney to file their petitions.&lt;ref name="uscourts.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/Statistics/BankruptcyStatistics/BAPCPA/2013/Tables2A-2X.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215234421/http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/Statistics/BankruptcyStatistics/BAPCPA/2013/Tables2A-2X.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical cost of an attorney is $1,170.00.&lt;ref name="uscourts.gov"/&gt; Alternatives to filing with an attorney are: filing pro se,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/FormsAndFees/Forms/BankruptcyForms.aspx|title=Bankruptcy Forms|author=|date=|website=uscourts.gov|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505070637/http://www.uscourts.gov/FormsAndFees/Forms/BankruptcyForms.aspx|archivedate=5 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; hiring a non-lawyer petition preparer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Preparing Petitions: It Irks the Lawyers, But Is It Lawyering?|author=Adam Liptak|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/13/us/preparing-petitions-it-irks-the-lawyers-but-is-it-lawyering.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=August 13, 2002|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624170126/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/13/us/preparing-petitions-it-irks-the-lawyers-but-is-it-lawyering.html|archivedate=June 24, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or using online software to generate the petition.

To be eligible to file a consumer bankruptcy under Chapter 7, a debtor must qualify under a statutory "means test".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pewlaw.com/bankruptcy/arizona-bankruptcy-means-test/|title=Arizona Bankruptcy Means Test - Pew Law Center|newspaper=Pew Law Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108190251/http://pewlaw.com/bankruptcy/arizona-bankruptcy-means-test/|archivedate=2017-01-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The means test was intended to make it more difficult for a significant number of financially distressed individual debtors whose debts are primarily consumer debts to qualify for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The "means test" is employed in cases where an individual with primarily consumer debts has more than the average annual income for a household of equivalent size, computed over a 180-day period prior to filing. If the individual must "take" the "means test", their average monthly income over this 180-day period is reduced by a series of allowances for living expenses and secured debt payments in a very complex calculation that may or may not accurately reflect that individual's actual monthly budget. If the results of the means test show no disposable income (or in some cases a very small amount) then the individual qualifies for Chapter 7 relief. An individual who fails the means test will have their Chapter 7 case dismissed, or may have to convert the case to a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.

If a debtor does not qualify for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, either because of the Means Test or because Chapter 7 does not provide a permanent solution to delinquent payments for secured debts, such as mortgages or vehicle loans, the debtor may still seek relief under Chapter 13 of the Code. A Chapter 13 plan often does not require repayment to general unsecured debts, such as credit cards or medical bills.

Generally, a trustee sells most of the debtor's assets to pay off creditors. However, certain debtor assets will be protected to some extent by bankruptcy exemptions. These include Social Security payments, unemployment compensation, limited equity in a home, car, or truck, household goods and appliances, trade tools, and books. However, these exemptions vary from state to state.

=====Chapter 11=====
{{main|Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code}}
In Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the debtor retains ownership and control of assets and is re-termed a [[debtor in possession]] (DIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 U.S. Code § 1101 - Definitions for this chapter|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1101|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019221324/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1101|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debtor in possession runs the day-to-day operations of the business while creditors and the debtor work with the Bankruptcy Court in order to negotiate and complete a plan. Upon meeting certain requirements (e.g., fairness among creditors, priority of certain creditors) creditors are permitted to vote on the proposed plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 U.S. Code § 1126 - Acceptance of plan|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1126|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019220225/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1126|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a plan is confirmed, the debtor continues to operate and pay debts under the terms of the confirmed plan. If a specified majority of creditors do not vote to confirm a plan, additional requirements may be imposed by the court in order to confirm the plan. Debtors filing for Chapter 11 protection a second time are known informally as "Chapter 22" filers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204124204577151211961572458|title=Twinkies Maker Preparing for Chapter 11 Filing|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 10, 2012|first=Mike|last=Spector|first2=Julie|last2=Jargon|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709060131/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204124204577151211961572458|archivedate=July 9, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Chapter 13=====
{{main|Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code}}
In Chapter 13, debtors retain ownership and possession of all their assets, but must devote some portion of future income to repaying creditors, generally over three to five years.&lt;ref name="el"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is Chapter 13 Bankruptcy|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/bankruptcy/chapter_13_bankruptcy.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=19 October 2017|date=15 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019220135/https://www.expertlaw.com/library/bankruptcy/chapter_13_bankruptcy.html|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of payment and period of the repayment plan depend upon a variety of factors, including the value of the debtor's property and the amount of a debtor's income and expenses.&lt;ref name="bbasics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 13 - Bankruptcy Basics|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-13-bankruptcy-basics|website=United States Courts|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020210719/http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-13-bankruptcy-basics|archivedate=20 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this chapter, the debtor can propose a repayment plan in which to pay creditors over three to five years. If the monthly income is less than the state's median income, the plan is for three years, unless the court finds "just cause" to extend the plan for a longer period. If the debtor's monthly income is greater than the median income for individuals in the debtor's state, the plan must generally be for five years. A plan cannot exceed the five-year limit.&lt;ref name="bbasics"/&gt;

Relief under Chapter 13 is available only to individuals with regular income whose debts do not exceed prescribed limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 U.S. Code § 109 - Who may be a debtor|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/109|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019220224/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/109|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the debtor is an individual or a sole proprietor, the debtor is allowed to file for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to repay all or part of the debts. Secured creditors may be entitled to greater payment than unsecured creditors.&lt;ref name="el"/&gt;

In contrast to Chapter 7, the debtor in Chapter 13 may keep all property, whether or not exempt. If the plan appears feasible and if the debtor complies with all the other requirements, the bankruptcy court typically confirms the plan and the debtor and creditors are bound by its terms. Creditors have no say in the formulation of the plan, other than to object to it, if appropriate, on the grounds that it does not comply with one of the Code's statutory requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, Rule 3015.

When the debtor completes payments pursuant to the terms of the plan, the court formally grant the debtor a discharge of the debts provided for in the plan.&lt;ref name="bbasics"/&gt; However, if the debtor fails to make the agreed upon payments or fails to seek or gain court approval of a modified plan, a bankruptcy court will normally dismiss the case on the motion of the trustee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, Rule 1017.

===Europe===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2007}}
In 2004, the number of insolvencies reached record highs in many European countries. In [[France]], company insolvencies rose by more than 4%, in [[Austria]] by more than 10%, and in [[Greece]] by more than 20%. The increase in the number of insolvencies, however, does not indicate the total financial impact of insolvencies in each country because there is no indication of the size of each case. An increase in the number of bankruptcy cases does not necessarily entail an increase in bad debt write-off rates for the economy as a whole.

Bankruptcy statistics are also a trailing indicator. There is a time delay between financial difficulties and bankruptcy. In most cases, several months or even years pass between the financial problems and the start of bankruptcy proceedings. Legal, tax, and cultural issues may further distort bankruptcy figures, especially when comparing on an international basis. Two examples:
* In [[Austria]], more than half of all potential bankruptcy proceedings in 2004 were not opened, due to insufficient funding.
* In [[Spain]], it is not economically profitable to open insolvency/bankruptcy proceedings against certain types of businesses, and therefore the number of insolvencies is quite low. For comparison: In [[France]], more than 40,000 insolvency proceedings were opened in 2004, but under 600 were opened in Spain. At the same time the average bad debt write-off rate in France was 1.3% compared to Spain with 2.6%.

The insolvency numbers for private individuals also do not show the whole picture. Only a fraction of heavily indebted households file for insolvency. Two of the main reasons for this are the stigma of declaring themselves insolvent and the potential business disadvantage.

Following the soar in insolvencies in the last decade, a number of European countries, such as France, Germany, Spain and Italy, began to revamp their bankruptcy laws in 2013. They modelled these new laws after the image of Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Currently, the majority of insolvency cases have ended in liquidation in Europe rather than the businesses surviving the crisis. These new law models are meant to change this; lawmakers are hoping to turn bankruptcy into a chance for restructuring rather than a death sentence for the companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323296504578398612178796882|title=Europe Builds Own Chapter 11|last=Ball|first=Deborah|date=2013-04-05|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-11-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122222544/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323296504578398612178796882|archivedate=2016-11-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effective sovereign bankruptcy==
Technically, states do not collapse directly due to a [[sovereign default]] event itself.  However, the tumultuous events that follow may bring down the state, so in common language we do describe states as being bankrupted.

Some examples of this are when a Korean state bankrupted Imperial China causing its destruction, or more specifically, when [[Chang'an]]'s ([[Sui Dynasty]]) war with [[Pyongyang]] ([[Goguryeo]]) in 614 A.D. ended in the former's disintegration within 4 years, although the latter also seemingly entered into decline and fell some 56 years later.&lt;ref&gt;"Koguryo". Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved October 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example is when the United States, with heavy financial backing from its allies (creditors), bankrupted the [[Soviet Union]] which led to the latter's demise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wais.stanford.edu/History/history_ussrandreagan.htm|title=The Collapse of the Soviet Union and Ronald Reagan|author=|date=|website=wais.stanford.edu|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322191321/http://wais.stanford.edu/History/history_ussrandreagan.htm|archivedate=22 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Buenos Aires [[Central Business District]]''' is the main commercial centre of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], though not an official [[Barrios and Communes of Buenos Aires|city ward]]. While the ''[[Neighbourhoods of Buenos Aires|barrios]]'' of [[Puerto Madero]] and [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]] house important business complexes and modern high-rise architecture, the area traditionally known as '''''Microcentro''''' (Spanish: Microcenter) is located within [[San Nicolás, Buenos Aires|San Nicolás]] and [[Monserrat, Buenos Aires|Monserrat]], roughly coinciding with the area around the historic center of the [[Plaza de Mayo]]. The ''Microcentro'' has a wide concentration of offices, service companies and banks, and a large circulation of pedestrians on working days. Another name given to this unofficial ''barrio'' is '''''La City''''', which refers more precisely to an even smaller sector within the ''Microcentro'', where almost all the banking headquarters of the country are concentrated.

==Overview==

The area was the site of the first [[Pedro de Mendoza|European settlement]] in what later became Buenos Aires. Its south-north axis runs along [[Leandro Alem Avenue]], from [[Avenida Belgrano|Belgrano Avenue]] in the south to [[Retiro railway station]] in the north, and its east-west axis runs from the [[Buenos Aires Ecological Reserve]] to [[Nueve de Julio Avenue|Ninth of July Avenue]]. The district is centered around the [[San Nicolás, Buenos Aires|San Nicolás]] ward, and includes the northern section of [[Montserrat, Buenos Aires|Montserrat]], the section of [[Retiro, Buenos Aires|Retiro]] south of [[Santa Fe Avenue]], and the section of [[Puerto Madero]] west of the [[Buenos Aires Docklands]].

The district is the financial, corporate, and cultural hub of Buenos Aires, and of Argentina. The economy of Buenos Aires was the 13th largest among the world's cities in 2006 at US$245 billion in [[purchasing power parity]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/richest-cities-2005.html City Mayors]&lt;/ref&gt;  which, based on the population of that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.indec.mecon.ar/nuevaweb/cuadros/4/EPHcont_3trim05.pdf# |title=INDEC |access-date=2009-07-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325001525/http://www.indec.mecon.ar/nuevaweb/cuadros/4/EPHcont_3trim05.pdf# |archive-date=2009-03-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; translates into US21,500 per capita. The Buenos Aires [[Human Development Index]] (0.925 in 1998) is likewise high by international standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.desarrollohumano.org.ar/IDHArgentina/98_nac/98_nac.html 'Informe Argentino Sobre Desarrollo Humano'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009000000/http://www.desarrollohumano.org.ar/IDHArgentina/98_nac/98_nac.html |date=October 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Port of Buenos Aires]] is one of the busiest in South America; navigable rivers by way of the [[Río de la Plata]] connect the port to [[Mesopotamia, Argentina|northeastern Argentina]], Brazil, [[Uruguay]] and [[Paraguay]]. As a result, it serves as the distribution hub for a vast area of the south-eastern region of the South American continent. Tax collection related to the port has caused many political problems in the past.

==Geography==
Buenos Aires CBD lies in the [[Pampa|Pampa region]], except some zones like the [[Buenos Aires Ecological Reserve]], the [[Boca Juniors|Boca Juniors (football) Club]] "sports city", [[Jorge Newbery Airport]], the [[Puerto Madero]] neighborhood and the main port itself. These latter were all built on [[reclaimed land]] along the coast of the [[Rio de la Plata]] (the world's largest [[estuary]]).

The region was formerly crossed by different [[Stream|creeks]] and [[lagoon]]s, some of which were refilled and other tubed. Among the most important creeks are: Maldonado, Vega, Medrano, Cildañez and White. In 1908 many creeks were channeled and rectified, as floods  were damaging the city's infrastructure. Starting in 1919, most creeks were enclosed. Notably, the Maldonado was tubed in 1954, and currently runs below Juan B. Justo Avenue (north of this district).

Facing the [[Río de la Plata]] estuary, the frontage remained flood-prone, and in 1846, Governor [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] had a contention wall six blocks long built along the existing promenade. An [[English Argentine]] investor, Edward Taylor, opened a pier along the promenade in 1855, and the flood-control walls were extended northwards to [[Recoleta, Buenos Aires|Recoleta]], and south to [[San Telmo]], in subsequent works completed in 1865.&lt;ref name=bue&gt;[http://www.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/ciudad/historico/calendario/destacado.php?menu_id=23203&amp;ide=216 Buenos Aires.gov: Paseo de Julio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531180343/http://www.buenosaires.gov.ar/areas/ciudad/historico/calendario/destacado.php?menu_id=23203&amp;ide=216 |date=2011-05-31 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sudden economic and population boom led the new President of Argentina, [[Julio Roca]], to commission the development in 1881 of an ambitious port to supplement the recently developed facilities at [[La Boca]], in Buenos Aires's southside. Approved by the [[Argentine Congress]] in 1882 and financed by the prominent London-based [[Barings Bank]] (the chief underwriter of Argentine bonds and investment, at the time), the project required the [[land reclamation|reclaiming]] of over 200 hectares (500 acres) of underwater land and was accompanied by the widening of the promenade into what became Leandro Alem Avenue.&lt;ref name=historia&gt;[http://www.puertomaderocancun.com/History.htm Puerto Madero: history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923162459/http://www.puertomaderocancun.com/History.htm |date=2009-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Buenos Aires Décembre 2007 - Avenida 5 de Mayo.jpg|thumb|260px|Diagonal Norte Avenue]]

[[Italian culture|Italian]] and [[French culture|French]] influences increased  after the [[Battle of Caseros|overthrow]] of strongman [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] in 1852, and particularly upon the advent of the modernizing [[Generation of '80|Generation of 1880]]. [[French architecture]] inspired the area's redevelopment during the beginning of the 20th century, and [[Eclecticist architeture|eclectic designs]] that drew from [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]], [[French Academy]], and [[Second Empire architecture]] were reflected by numerous historic buildings in this districts from the era, notably the headquarters for ''[[Buenos Aires House of Culture|La Prensa]]'', [[Buenos Aires City Hall|City Hall]], the [[Buenos Aires City Legislature|City Legislature]], [[Buenos Aires Customs]], [[Argentine Supreme Court|Palace of Justice]], the [[Argentine Congress|National Congress]], the [[Teatro Colón]], the [[Buenos Aires Stock Exchange]], the [[Buenos Aires Central Post Office]], and along most of the [[Avenida de Mayo]] and [[Diagonal Norte]] Avenue.
Some of the most prominent contributors to the district's architecture from the era included [[Francesco Tamburini]], [[Vittorio Meano]], [[Julio Dormal]], [[Virginio Colombo]], [[Juan Antonio Buschiazzo]], [[Mario Palanti]], and [[Francisco Gianotti]]. Later significant additions include those by [[Alejandro Christophersen]], [[Alejandro Bustillo]] (most notably the [[Banco de la Nación Argentina|National Bank]]), [[Andrés Kalnay]], [[Eduardo Le Monnier]], and [[Francisco Salamone]].

The [[Alas Building]], commissioned by [[Juan Perón]] and built in the early 1950s, was the tallest in Argentina until 1995, and was one of numerous commercial structures built in the [[Rationalist architecture|Rationalist]] style in this area during that time. Since the 1960s, newer, high-technology buildings were designed in the district by Argentine architects [[Clorindo Testa]], Santiago Sánchez Elía, [[César Pelli]], and [[Mario Roberto Álvarez]], by firms such as [[SEPRA Arquitectos]] and [[MSGSSS]], and by Uruguayan architect [[Rafael Viñoly]]. Some of the more notable commercial developments completed since then have included the [[Catalinas Norte]] [[office park]], [[Torre Bouchard]], [[Bouchard Plaza]], [[Galicia Financial Group|Galicia Tower]], the [[Repsol-YPF tower|Repsol-YPF Tower]], the [[Banco Macro|Banco Macro Tower]], and the [[Torre BBVA (Buenos Aires)|BBVA Tower]] .

== Districts ==

=== San Nicolás===
[[File:Reconquista hacia el norte.JPG|left|thumb|200px|[[Reconquista Street]], in the area's financial center]]
'''San Nicolás''' is one of the districts that shares most of the city and national government structure with neighboring [[Montserrat, Buenos Aires|Montserrat]], and is home of the business district's financial center. It's seldom referred to as ''San Nicolás'', but usually as '''''The Center''''' ("City Centre"), and the part east of the [[9 de Julio Avenue]] is called ''Microcentro'' ("Micro-centre").

The growing importance of the area as a financial center was highlighted by the 1854 establishment of the [[Buenos Aires Stock Exchange]]. San Nicolás remains the financial center of Argentina, something underscored by the presence of the [[Central Bank of Argentina|Central Bank]] and the [[Banco de la Nacion Argentina|National Bank]], Argentina's largest. The rapid development of the [[Economic history of Argentina|Argentine economy]] after 1875 made itself evident in San Nicolás with the reclaiming of riverfront land by businessmen [[Francisco Seeber]] and [[Eduardo Madero]], and the shore hitherto popular among washerwomen became the ''Paseo de Julio'' (today [[Leandro Alem Avenue]]).

The construction of [[Corrientes Avenue|Corrientes]] and [[Nueve de Julio Avenue]]s in the 1930s further modernized San Nicolás, which had hitherto been limited in its development by its colonial grid of narrow streets. [[Florida Street]], most of which is in San Nicolás, is the city's best-known [[pedestrianized street]].&lt;ref name=bnic&gt;[http://www.barriada.com.ar/sannicolas.htm Barriada: San Nicolás] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its most discernible landmark is the [[Galerías Pacífico]] [[shopping arcade]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buenosaires-argentina.com/neighborhoods/microcentro.html Buenos Aires Neighborhoods - Microcentro]&lt;/ref&gt;

The district is home to the [[Argentine Supreme Court]], the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral]], the [[Teatro Colón|Colón Opera House]], headquarters of numerous leading Argentine firms, including [[Aerolíneas Argentinas]], the [[Bank of the City of Buenos Aires]], ''[[La Nación]]'', [[Bunge y Born]], [[Gregorio Pérez Companc|Pérez Companc]], the [[Francisco Macri|Macri Group]], and most of the [[Buenos Aires Stock Exchange]] leaders, as well as the local offices of a number of international companies, such as [[BankBoston]], [[BBVA Banco Francés|BBVA]], [[Citibank Argentina|Citibank]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[HSBC Bank Argentina|HSBC]], [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], [[Banco Santander Río|Santander Bank]], and [[Techint]].&lt;ref name=bnic/&gt;

=== Retiro ===
[[File:Leandro Alem Buenos Aires 37.jpg|thumb|260px|Leandro Alem Avenue]]
Retiro is one of the largest hubs of transportation services in Argentina.  Local and long distance rail service heading to the north originate from [[Estación Retiro]] (Retiro Terminal Station), and [[Retiro bus station]] is the city's main long-distance bus terminal. [[Line C (Buenos Aires)|''Subte'' line C]] of the [[Buenos Aires Metro]] system and numerous local public bus services serve Retiro, and this area is always teeming with commuters and traffic on weekdays.

The most important avenue linking Retiro and the CBD to commuters living in residential areas to the north is [[Avenida del Libertador]], which becomes [[Leandro Alem Avenue]] past the Retiro Station. Other important thoroughfares in the Retiro section of the CBD are [[Avenida Córdoba|Córdoba]], [[Santa Fe Avenue|Santa Fe]], and [[9 de Julio Avenue]]s.

The high-rise business district of ''[[Catalinas Norte]]'', as well as the northern end of the Puerto Madero development, is located east of Leandro N. Alem Avenue. Opposite the Retiro train terminal, at the northern end of the CBD, is the leafy [[Plaza San Martín (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Martín]], surrounded by great palaces and hotels. The Retiro lowlands were once the training grounds for [[José de San Martín]]'s ''[[Granaderos a caballo|Granaderos]]'' corps,  and the modern-day Plaza San Martín features an [[equestrian statue]] honoring the hero of the [[Argentine War of Independence]], as well as a memorial for the dead in the 1982 [[Falklands War]]. Facing the station is Argentine Air Force Square, where the ''[[Torre Monumental]]'' (formerly ''Torre de los Ingleses''), a monument donated by the [[Anglo-Argentine]] community for the 1910 centennial celebrations, is located.&lt;ref name=bret&gt;[http://www.barriada.com.ar/retiro.htm Barriada: Retiro] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other significant landmarks opposite the Plaza are the [[Kavanagh Building]], a [[reinforced concrete]] structure that when completed in 1936, was the tallest building in Latin America at {{convert|120|m|ft|0}}. The nearby [[Brunetta Building]] (formerly headquarters for [[Olivetti]]'s Latin American operations) was the first in Argentina to be built in the [[International style (architecture)|International style]].&lt;ref name=bret/&gt;

=== Montserrat ===
'''Montserrat''' is located south of San Nicolás. The section of the Montserrat ward within the business district includes some of the most important buildings in [[Argentine Government]] and [[Argentine history|history]], and was the site of the [[Buenos Aires Cabildo]], the colonial town hall.
[[File:Buenos_Aires_Subte_station_Peru.jpg|left|thumb|260px|City Hall and the Avenue of May]]
[[Avenida de Mayo|Avenue of May]] runs through the Montserrat district, connecting [[Plaza de Mayo|May Square]] and [[Congressional Plaza]]. A block or two south of the Plaza de Mayo, the older section of Montserrat begins. This was the location of the [[Illuminated Block]], a [[Jesuit]] center of higher learning during the 18th century, and today home to the [[Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires]]. This is Buenos Aires's oldest neighborhood and even today, very little of the cityscape there is less than a hundred years old (except along Belgrano Avenue), thereby making a nearly seamless transition to the likewise historic [[San Telmo]] district to the south.&lt;ref name=bmon&gt;[http://www.barriada.com.ar/montserrat.htm Barriada: Montserrat] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The district's led central location and its presence therein of much of Argentina's governmental structure led to monumental construction over the 1910s, notable among which are the [[Casa Rosada|Pink House]], [[Buenos Aires City Hall|City Hall]], the [[Buenos Aires City Legislature|City Legislature]], the [[Buenos Aires Customs|Customs building]], the offices of ''[[La Prensa (Buenos Aires)|La Prensa]]'' (today the [[Buenos Aires House of Culture]]), the art-deco [[NH City Hotel]] (off the Plaza de Mayo), the [[Libertador Building]] (Ministry of Defense), and South Diagonal Avenue. Montserrat's western half was partitioned from the rest by the southward expansion of the massive [[Nueve de Julio Avenue]] around 1950.

The area became a largely bohemian quarter popular with [[Argentine tango|tango]] performers and artists, as well as many who preferred the area's close proximity to the growing [[San Nicolás, Buenos Aires|financial district]] to the north and its relatively low rent scale. Its rich architectural history and quiet, narrow streets have, as in neighboring [[San Telmo]], helped lead to renewed [[Tourism in Argentina|tourist]] interest in Montserrat since around 1990.&lt;ref name=bmon/&gt;

=== Puerto Madero===
[[File:Buenos Aires - Puerto Madero 142.jpg|thumb|260px|Puerto Madero]]
'''Puerto Madero''' occupies a significant portion of the [[Maritime dock|docklands]] and, as the newest of Buenos Aires's 48 boroughs, features the latest architectural trends in Argentina.

Originally developed by local businessman [[Eduardo Madero]] and designed by British engineer Sir [[John Hawkshaw]], Puerto Madero was inaugurated in 1897. Its four docks were relegated to ancillary port functions after the 1926 completion of the New Port to the north, however, and became derelict. Beginning around 1994, however, local and foreign investment led to a massive revitalization effort, recycling and refurbishing the west side warehouses into upscale offices, [[lofts]], restaurants, private universities and luxurious hotels. State-of-the-art multiplex cinemas, theatres, cultural centres, luxurious hotels and office and corporate buildings are located mostly in the eastern side of the district.&lt;ref name=bpm&gt;[http://www.barriada.com.ar/pmadero.htm Barriada: Puero Madero] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puerto Madero has been redeveloped with international flair, drawing interest from renown architects such as [[Santiago Calatrava]], [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]], [[César Pelli]] and [[Philippe Starck]], among others. Today one of the trendiest boroughs in Buenos Aires, it has become the preferred address for growing numbers of young professionals and retirees, alike. Increasing property prices have also generated interest in the area as a destination for foreign buyers, particularly those in the market for premium investment properties.

The neighborhood's road network has been entirely rebuilt, especially in the east side. The layout of the east side consists currently of three wide boulevards running east-west crossed by the east side's main street, Juana Manso Avenue. The layout is completed with some other avenues and minor streets, running both east-west and north-south, and by several pedestrianised streets. All the streets of Puerto Madero are named after [[Women in Argentina|women]]. The [[Puente de la Mujer]] (Women's Bridge), designed in 2001 by Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], is the newest link between the east and west docks of Puerto Madero.&lt;ref name=bpm/&gt;

Puerto Madero represents the largest wide-scale urban project in the city of Buenos Aires, currently. Having undergone an impressive revival in merely a decade, it is one of the most successful recent waterfront renewal projects in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Breen and Dick Rigby, ''The New Waterfront: A Worldwide Urban Success Story'' – McGraw-Hill Professional&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous new residential high-rises of up to 50 stories have been built facing on the eastern half of Puerto Madero since 2000.  These include [[El Mirador of Puerto Madero towers]], [[Renoir Towers]], [[El Faro towers]], [[Chateau Tower of Puerto Madero]], and the [[Mulieris towers]], among others. Notable non-residential structures include the [[Repsol-YPF tower]], the [[Hilton Buenos Aires]], the [[Faena Hotel+Universe]] (one of a number of refurbished former [[Molinos Río de la Plata]] silos), and the [[Fortabat Art Collection]] museum building.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5974">'''Business Intelligence 2.0''' ('''BI 2.0''') is a future development of the existing [[business intelligence]] model that began in the mid-2000s, where data can be obtained from many sources. The process allows for the querying of real-time corporate data by employees, but approaches the data with a [[web browser]] based solution. This is in contrast to previous proprietary querying tools that characterizes previous BI software.

The growth in [[service-oriented architecture]]s (SOA) is one of the main factors for this happening. BI 2.0 is intended to be more flexible and adaptive than normal business intelligence. [[Data exchange]] processes also differ, with [[XBRL]] (Extensible Business Reporting Language), [[Web Service]]s and various [[Semantic Web]] [[ontology (information science)|ontologies]] enable using data external to an organization, such as [[benchmarking]] type information.

Business Intelligence 2.0 is believed to have been named after [[Web 2.0]], although it takes elements from both Web 2.0 (a focus on user empowerment and community collaboration, technologies like [[RSS]] and the concept of [[mashup (web application hybrid)|mashup]]s), and the [[Semantic Web]], sometimes called "Web 3.0" ([[semantic integration]] through shared ontologies to enable easier exchange of data).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title = Start Making Sense: Get From Data To Semantic Integration
| publisher = intelligententerprise.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to analytics expert Neil Raden, BI 2.0 also implies a move away from the standard [[data warehouse]] that business intelligence tools have used, which "will give way to context, contingency and the need to relate information quickly from many sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22260">'''Central Atlanta Progress''' (CAP), founded in 1941, as the Central Area Improvement Association, is a private, not-for-profit corporation, chartered to plan and promote Atlanta's Central Area, that strives to create a robust economic climate for downtown [[Atlanta, Georgia]], in the [[United States]].

CAP was formed by a merger of the Central Atlanta Improvement Association with the Uptown Association on January 1, 1967.

Central Atlanta Progress (CAP) defines the central area as the central core of Atlanta bounded by the railroad cordon from West End on the south to Brookwood on the north and Boulevard on the east to Vine City on the west.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Celebration of People and Progress, Central Atlanta Progress 20th Anniversary,|last=|first=|publisher=Central Atlanta Progress, Inc.|year=1967|isbn=|location=Atlanta|pages=2, 14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The membership of CAP consists of the chief executives of approximately major corporations and property owners in Central Atlanta, The Board of Directors includes business leaders from the Atlanta area.  CAP is funded through the investment of businesses and institutions.

== First Central Area Study ==

The first '''Central Area Study''' of the city of Atlanta was performed by Central Atlanta Progress. Completed in 1971, the first Central Area Study (CAS I) dealt with the  areas of economic development, transport, housing, urban design, public safety, human services, and marketing.  The study focused on transport conditions and related land use and urban design in the areas proximate to downtown and midtown in Atlanta.  The idea that attracted press attention was the "four level Peachtree corridor" concept which would have buried the vehicular travel along Peachtree Street below the surface of the current road.

=== Study Recommendations ===
The Study states

{{quote|The Goal of this study is to recommend policies, plans, programs, and projects which will permit the study area - Central Atlanta - to reinforce its role as:
* Capitol [sic] of Georgia, and center of the metropolitan region;
* The cultural, educational, business, and transport center of the Southeast; -The focal point of a national and emerging international city; and
* A model in the field of improved human relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Atlanta Central Area Study|last =|first =|publisher = Central Area Policy Committee|date = March 12, 1971|isbn =|location =|pages = 4|via =}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When the study was written, freeway (and tollway) mileage within the city was expected to be significantly more than it became. Among the abandoned highways were an [[Interstate 85 in Georgia|I-85]] separate from the [[Downtown Connector]] by the construction of a west-side freeway, construction of [[Interstate 485 (Georgia)|I-485]] as an east-side parallel to the connector, extension of the [[Lakewood Freeway]], and construction of the [[Stone Mountain Freeway|Stone Mountain Expressway]] and its symmetrical sister, the South Cobb Expressway to relieve [[Interstate 75 in Georgia|I-75]] northwest of the central business district. Fifty specific local surface street improvements were also recommended, at a cost of $69 million (of the total of $326 million in improvements recommended by the study.)

The writers of the first Central Area Study appreciated that it was unreasonable to expect that the streets and parking lots of the Central Business District (CBD) would be sufficient to accommodate every automobile whose occupants' desired to travel there.  Therefore, the study strongly supported the construction of the [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|MARTA]] heavy-rail system as one of the means to "intercept the automobile." As recommended by the first Central Area Study, the MARTA referendum was passed in November 1971.

Also part of this interception idea was a people-mover system designed to link some of the key interception points with downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Atlanta Central Area Study I "Intercepting the Automobile"|last =|first =|publisher = Central Atlanta Progress|year = 1971|isbn =|location =|pages = 34|via =}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distribution system was imagined as an above ground, above vehicular right-of-ways, fixed guideway system.

CAS I saw the construction of MARTA rail as an extraordinary opportunity to accomplish several goals. The first of these was to impact land use around the rail stations in [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]], [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb]], and the [[Atlanta|City of Atlanta]]. "Land use plans, zoning and subdivision regulations should be altered to encourage high density residential and commercial development around the stations." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Atlanta Central Area Study I "Affecting Traffic By Public Policy"|last =|first =|publisher = Central Area Progress|year = 1971|isbn =|location = Atlanta, Georgia|pages = 38|via =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second opportunity brought about by the construction, and its inconvenience, was to simultaneously rebuild Peachtree Street as a four level transport corridor. This "Peachtree Promenade" would have converted the existing level of Peachtree Street to a pedestrian mall, with fountains and other urban design amenities. On the level immediately below the existing street, north-south vehicular traffic would run. Beneath this north-south spine would be two functions, east-west roadways on a separate grade from [[Peachtree Street|Peachtree]], and the concourses for the MARTA stations. On the third below ground level would be MARTA rail lines. "The construction of the MARTA line along Peachtree will indeed be disruptive for a short time. However, the exploitation of the singular opportunity which this construction presents will result in a more efficient and attractive system of coping with the future. ... Failure to move boldly in this direction would be inexcusable." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Atlanta Central Area Study I "Peachtree Promenade"|last =|first =|publisher = Central Area Progress|year = 1971|isbn =|location = Atlanta, Georgia|pages = 42|via =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Only the MARTA line was built, and Peachtree remained a vehicular street with at grade intersections.

Other specific Urban Design projects recommended by CAS I included the creation of a multilevel Five Points Park and development of pedestrian malls on Broad Street and on Alabama Street. The study also performed an investigation into the area called "Railroad Gulch" which corresponds to the area just south of the [[Five Points station|Five Points]] area. For this area, the study recommended formulation of a three level movement system, involving pedestrian walkways and air-rights construction over the railroad lines and the MARTA station.

As with most planning studies, CASwas predicated on demographic forecasts, noted in the table.  The forecasts anticipated too much growth in the central area as opposed to the rest of the Atlanta region. In particular, the amount of office space and the number of employees in downtown was overstated by a significant factor. The cities used as a model for the planners in the Central Area Study were older more urban cities rather than the newer suburban form of faster growing cities in the southern and western US.

=== Study Adoption ===
At the time of the first Central Area Study, the CAP Policy Committee consisted of: [[Sam Massell]], Mayor of the City of Atlanta; [[Wyche Fowler]], Alderman; Ira Jackson, Alderman; Wade Mitchell, Alderman; Mills Lane, Chairman of Citizens and Southern Bank; and [[John C. Portman Jr.|John Portman]], President of Central Atlanta Progress.  The Study Director was Robert Leary, the advisor was Robert Bivens, and the secretary was Collier Gladdin, who was Planning Director of the City of Atlanta.

On March 25, 1972, the first Central Area Study was delivered to the Aldermen of the City of Atlanta. Collier Gladdin, moved to achieve quick adoption of this program, which proposed to spend $326.7 million over 23 years to improve access and circulation in the central area of Atlanta. Gladdin did not want this to become another dust-gathering  report, he said "We're going to keep it alive." The study itself cost $200,000 and was funded by the United States Department of Transportation, the City of Atlanta, and Central Atlanta Progress, Inc., and was developed under the guidance of an urban planner, Robert M. Leary, hired as study director, with the assistance of an eight member team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Report Sets Cost for Malls, Parks|last=|first=|date=1972-03-26|work=Atlanta Constitution, p. 18A|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 30th of March, Alderman Wyche Fowler, while discussing the plan, stated that no group will ever adopt the plan to rebuild downtown in toto, but that they may approve it as a guide to development.

The idea that had grabbed the attention was the concept of a Four Level Peachtree Street, which had walkways for pedestrians, a rapid transit corridor, and streets for vehicle traffic, as well as automobile interceptor lots on the edge of the study area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Central Area Plan Hearing Delayed|last=Coffin|first=Alex|date=1972-03-30|work=Atlanta Constitution, p. 3b|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, John Portman was the President of Central Atlanta Progress, and one of the leading participants in the study. In April 1972, he boasted that Atlanta was one of under a handful of American cities which had a chance to solve its problems. He said "The Central Study can be one of the greatest tools in our history, if we'll only work together to make it happen, and now is the time to start." In the article appearing that day, the Constitution, in its usual manner of accurate reporting, increased the cost of the study to $300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Atlanta Can Solve Problems With Growth Plan - Portman|last=|first=|date=1972-04-07|work=Atlanta Constitution, p. 15B|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spring of 1972 was also the time that new officers were elected to the Board of Directors of CAP. Portman rival [[Tom Cousins|Thomas Cousins]], developer of the off-Peachtree Omni complex, was made 1st Vice President.

A public hearing in late April  was held to discuss the proposed plan, at which there was much discord over the proposal, with demagoguery reaching such heights that one speaker called it "an expensive and totally inappropriate tombstone to a city that committed suicide." The opponents were led by Kathryn Thompson, chair of the Virginia-Highlands Action Committee, and consisted of many environmentalists. It is worth noting that the plan would have converted over 15 square miles of Central Atlanta into pedestrian malls and parks if it had been fully implemented.  Citizen complainants maintained that the Study would not solve the "traffic mess", that there should be more mass transit, that it "Paves Atlanta" when it should "Save Atlanta", that there was no citizen involvement in the plan, only reaction, that the money should be used for neighborhood parks, and that the urban design restrictions were too lax. Those endorsing the Central Area Study were a diverse sample of the planning community including Larry Gellerstadt who was President of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, a Vice President of MARTA, a representative of the state DOT, and a city Traffic Engineer, Clyde Robbins,  a Vice President of Georgia Tech, and Steve Fuller, the chair of Underground Atlanta in its previous incarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Speakers Attack Plan to Rebuild Downtown|last=Coffin|first=Alex|date=1972-04-27|work=Atlanta Constitution, p. 17A|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voting to delay the approval or disapproval of the plan for two weeks on the sixteenth of October, the council avoided making a potentially controversial decision. This move disagreed with project supporter and member of the study's policy committee, Alderman Wyche Fowler, so much that he said "I don't think political pussyfooting on the part of some aldermen is going to win the day." The aldermen he was referring to were Chuck Driebe and Buddy Fowlkes, who offered an amendment that would receive the study as a guide for development with "no designated priorities", and subject to modification after the release of the then upcoming Atlanta Regional Commission's Regional Transportation Plan. Alderman Wade Mitchell moved to change the words "receive the plan" to "approve the plan", at which point Driebe moved to table the bill. Fowler, clearly unhappy with Driebe over this and other issues, said "Driebe knows additional language is superfluous and meaningless. I hope that any members of the board who do not feel that this is a unique study by both the public and the private sector that provides us a chance to channel our growth in an orderly fashion will have the guts to say so." The issue underlying approval of the Central Area Study and causing all of the nastiness was the charter revision, over which Driebe and Fowler had disagreements. Another reason for the opposition was because of the suggestion of the  construction of tollways through inner city areas. Aldermen Panke Bradley, Nick Lambros, and Chuck Driebe introduced legislation calling on the state of Georgia to stop tollway planning until the Atlanta Regional Commission prepared and the aldermanic council approved an alternative to the regional transport problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Aldermen Put Off Mid-City Study Vote|last=Linthicum|first=Tom|date=1972-10-17|work=Atlanta Constitution, p15A|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the fourth of November, the Atlanta Constitution published an editorial; it said in part:

&lt;blockquote&gt;we hope that the aldermen will adopt it as a guideline for the future. We would emphasize that action by the board would not commit the city or the aldermanic board to any specific project or priority of the Central Area Study. But it would commit the city to principles of sound planning for the future, whatever detailed decisions have to be made later. We think that is important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Central City - Editorial|last=Editorial staff|first=|date=1972-11-04|work=Atlanta Constitution, p.4A|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Aldermen finally approved the Central Area Study on November 7, 1972. Mayor Sam Massell proposed a compromise measure of which he said "Such approval does not carry with it or imply the prior approval of any specific program or project which is proposed or might be represented to implement said plan." and "Each individual improvement contained in this report must meet the test of careful study at the appropriate time to determine its applicability, financial feasibility, and impact prior to being submitted to the effected committee of the mayor and Board of Aldermen."

After this compromise was introduced, only Alderman Cecil Turner voted against the substitute resolution, because he wanted to substitute for accepting the study a statement which called the study "an acceptable statement of plans and goals for downtown Atlanta.  Alderman Fowler called Turner's proposal "legal jabberwocky designed to delay, frustrate and hinder the planning process."  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Aldermen OK Central Area Study|last=Linthicum|first=Tom|date=1972-11-07|work=Atlanta Constitution, p. 6A|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second Central Area Study ==

Cochaired by Mayor [[Andrew Young]], Jim Edwards, and Frank Carter, the second Central Area Study (CAS II) was begun in the fall of 1985 and completed in 1987. Like the first study, CAS II was a joint effort with the [[Atlanta|City of Atlanta]] and [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]].  The policy board guiding the study was divided into seven task forces dealing with strategic planning, conventions and tourism, transport and infrastructure, recreation and the  arts, public safety, retail and commercial, and housing. "The primary goal of CAS II is the creation of both the image and reality of Atlanta as a safe and clean city" &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and "The top priority of CAS II is to make the Central Area more livable and inviting to people." &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Central Atlanta Study ll A Plan for Atlanta's future|last=|first=|publisher=Central Atlanta Progress, Inc|year=1987|isbn=|location=Atlanta, Georgia|pages=4, 6, 18|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second Central Area Study promoted what it called "Pedestrian Peachtree", and said "We want buildings and public spaces designed so that they are hospitable to people. We want retail shops to face the sidewalks so that people are invited in, not shops buried deep within buildings that turn their backs on pedestrians and visitors." This last point is clearly aimed at John Portman's [[Peachtree Center]] complex which has very little street frontage of shops, but has an indoor mall. The idea of the Pedestrian Peachtree is a similar but scaled down version of what was proposed in the first Central Area Study.

CAS II proposed the creation of a Central Atlanta Retail Association. Three issues were to be the focus of this organization: maintenance of the environment, attracting shoppers, and recruiting and retaining desirable retail merchants.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Along with a retail association, the study advocated better marketing of downtown, with the creation of a marketing association which would merchandise downtown attractions, create a central information center, and improve signage. Along with this, entertainment facilities are to be clustered in certain districts of the central area. The CARA was also charged with the maintenance of downtown. This means that it is to be responsible for coordinating the repair of sidewalks, waste disposal, and general cleanliness.

The task force on housing maintained that if Atlanta were to remain a 24 hour city, it would have to attract upper and middle income housing. A coordinating agency for housing development, Housing Urban Design Assistance Team (HUDAT), was proposed, although whether the agency was to be new or an already existing agency was undecided.

Making Atlanta a "clean and safe city" was one of the priorities of the study, and to meet this goal, it proposed that the central police zone be reconstituted to include Midtown as well as downtown. This proposal met with some controversy because it essentially proposed making a safe downtown more important than other areas, offending those in other areas.

Funding would be accomplished by the steering of public and private incentives to achieve certain goals. This would be used in particular for promotion of downtown housing and better urban design.

"The focus of CAS I, completed in 1971, was on improving transport and circulation in Central Atlanta." &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These recommendations, including, making Spring Street and West Peachtree one-way pairs, improving the interstate system, and the construction of a heavy-rail MARTA system, were generally implemented. CASII suggested further transport improvements, in particular benefitting pedestrian flow, including the creation of pedestrian malls and  reducing vehicle-pedestrian conflictual interaction.

The fundamental difference between the two Central Atlanta Studies was not any particular recommendations. It is rather, that the first study focused on concrete achievable goals, the most important of which were achieved, while the second study much more heavily emphasized human resource type goals, whose success will be harder to measure and see.&lt;ref&gt;The idea is from Paul Kelman, Vice President of Central Atlanta Progress.&lt;/ref&gt; Improving safety, better marketing of downtown retail, and the creation of a "24 Hour City" are for the most part only able to be successful if they are perceived to be successful. From the point of view of downtown merchants, increased police will not have helped unless people feel safer, and spend more time downtown.

== Atlanta Downtown Improvement District ==
The '''Atlanta Downtown Improvement District''' (ADID), founded in 1995 by CAP, is a [[public-private partnership]] that strives to create a livable environment for Downtown Atlanta. With a Board of Directors of nine private and public-sector leaders, ADID is funded through a community improvement district within which commercial property owners pay special assessments.

According to their mission statements, Central Atlanta Progress and the Atlanta Downtown Improvement District are committed to a downtown for the diverse Atlanta community, including property owners, employees, residents, students and visitors.

Archives of Central Atlanta Progress are available at the [[Atlanta History Center]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3512">A '''Chief Administrative Officer''' ('''CAO''') is a top-tier executive who supervises the daily operations of an organization and is ultimately responsible for its performance.

==Government and nonprofit==
A '''Chief Administrative Officer''' ('''CAO''') is responsible for administrative management of private, public or governmental organizations and the ''[[de facto]]'' head of the organization.

In a municipal context, the title is usually used as an alternative for [[city manager]],&lt;ref name="City Management in Canada"&gt;{{cite book

In the [[United Kingdom]], CAOs of [[public company|public companies]] must be chartered secretaries ([[Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators]]), lawyers, certified/chartered accountants, or others with equivalent experience.

==Non-government corporations==
The CAO is one of the highest-ranking members of an organization, managing daily operations and usually reporting directly to the [[chief executive officer|Chief Executive Officer]]. In some companies, the CAO is also the president. It is very similar to a [[chief operating officer|Chief Operating Officer]] but is not the same as a [[chief executive officer|Chief Executive Officer]], which is a more senior title in [[for-profit corporations]].

==United Nations==
At the United Nations, the secretary-general is the [[de facto]] head of the [[United Nations]]. According to the United Nations: Equal parts diplomat and advocate, civil servant and CEO, the Secretary-General is a symbol of United Nations ideals and a spokesman for the interests of the world's peoples, in particular the poor and vulnerable among them. The Charter also empowers the Secretary-General to "bring to the attention of the Security Council any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security". These guidelines both define the powers of the office and grant it considerable scope for action. One of the most vital roles played by the Secretary-General is the use of his "good offices", steps taken publicly and in private, drawing upon his independence, impartiality and integrity, to prevent international disputes from arising, escalating or spreading.

The secretary-general appoints all staff at the [[United Nations]].

==History==
In [[Brunei]], Chief Administrative Officer was the highest rank of governmental officers in [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|Japanese occupied Brunei]] under the Japanese [[Governor]]. The first Chief Administrative Officer was [[Inche Ibrahim]] (known later as Pehin Datu Perdana Menteri Dato Laila Utama Awang Haji Ibrahim), a former Secretary to the British Resident, [[Ernest Edgar Pengilly]].

'''Chris Joseph''' is a British advertising executive and sufferer of [[bipolar disorder]] and the author of his autobiography ''Bye-Bye Bipolar?: 63 Manicdotes''. He has a divorced wife Helen and three children,&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bye-Bye Bipolar? - 63 Manicdotes|last=Joseph |first=Chris |year=2008 |publisher=Austin Macauley |location=London |asin= B01CO13SII}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also a supporter of [[Middlesbrough F.C|Middlesbrough Football Club]]. He was chairman of the Middlesbrough Official Supporters Club from 2014-2015 {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}and is the founder and President of the Middlesbrough Supporters Forum - www.boro.support

==Early life and education ==
Joseph attended the [[English Martyrs School and Sixth Form College]], Hartlepool. He left his [[BA Hons]] French degree at the [[University of Liverpool]] to become a priest, worked as a nightclub doorman, and at an iron foundry [[Head Wrightson]]&lt;ref name="fansonline"&gt;[http://fansonline.net/middlesbrough/article.php?id=652 Manicdotes].''fmttm'', Robert Nichols, 8 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; where he survived an industrial accident but lost his right arm, and then completed a changed degree at the [[University of Liverpool]] in French and communication studies before beginning a career in advertising.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{cite book|title=Manicdotes: There's Madness in His Method|author=Chris Joseph|publisher= Austin &amp; Macauley Publishers |year=2008|isbn= 978-1905609079 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}}

==Advertising career==
After joining the small advertising agency GDA, rapid promotion to new business director and subsequently being headhunted by [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]],&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; he set up his own agency, Hook Advertising, which he turned into an award-winning{{which|date=September 2016}} company with a £10 million a year turnover. The name comes from the solid [[silver hallmarks|silver hallmarked]] hook which replaced the hand he lost in his industrial accident.&lt;ref name="campaign2011"&gt;[http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/analysis/1073221/ The history of advertising 17 - Chris Joseph's silver hook].''campaignlive.co.uk'', 3 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Although clients of Hook Advertising included [[Fujitsu]] and [[Henkel|Schwarzkopf]], its biggest client was the [[Barclays]] [[Philips]] [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] consortium (BYPS). Joseph created and designed the name and logo for [[Rabbit (telecommunications)|Rabbit]], a telephone system and then pitched and won the £4 million advertising contract from BYPS. When Rabbit was later sold to [[Hutchison Telecommunications International Limited|Hutchison]], the latter requested an assignment of the Rabbit copyright from Hook Advertising which refused, believing it not to be covered by the contract. After Hutchison severed the contract it sued Hook Advertising.&lt;ref name="campaign1995"&gt;[http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/20791/ NEWS: Hook defends right to own Rabbit logo in High Court battle].''campaignlive.co.uk'',John Tylee, 8 December 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Four years of litigation followed where Hook Advertising also sued Barclays, Shell, Philips and Hutchison, and in addition Barclays sued Hook Advertising.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

In January 1996, [[Mary Arden (judge)|Mrs Justice Arden]] ruled that clients cannot take creative work pitched to them speculatively without a prior agreement, but that in Hook Advertising's enthusiasm to win the Rabbit deal it had effectively traded its rights to the logo and made such a preliminary deal.&lt;ref name="campaign2011" /&gt; This ruling replaced the legal precedent set in 1928 in the Hycolite case ([[Drabble (Harold) Ltd v. Hycolite Manufacturing Co.]] [1928] 44 TLR 264) that the conduct of the parties may imply a licence to use a copyright work without the need for it to be in writing.&lt;ref name="campaign2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ludlowLaw"&gt;Ludlow, G.C., LeBlanc, M.A., 2000.

==Illness==
Joseph suffers from [[bipolar disorder]], a [[psychiatric illness]] with cyclical [[Mania|manic]] and [[Major depressive episode|depressive]] episodes. He was [[Involuntary commitment|sectioned]] several times between 1988 and 2002 although he has now been well and not [[relapse]]d for 12 years.&lt;ref name="northernecho2012"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/lifestories/9821709.Bipolar_battler/ | title=Bipolar battler  | date=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During some of his manic periods he squandered money, including buying 200 [[The Football Association|FA]] football tickets worth over £5,000 for a match involving his favourite team [[Middlesbrough F.C]]. He then gave them all away to children he didn't know outside [[McDonald's]].&lt;ref name="fansonline" /&gt; He became chairman of the national Manic Depressive Fellowship charity (now Bipolar UK) during the period [[Spike Milligan]] was patron.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==SAFE (Struggle Against Financial Exploitation)==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2016}}
While fighting the litigation Joseph founded the group SAFE (Struggle Against Financial Exploitation). Its purpose was as a high-profile action group to demonstrate and draw attention to systemic fraud and deception upon unsuspecting individuals throughout the UK. SAFE caused severe embarrassment, with its demonstrations and creative but legal advertising campaigns and publicity stunts against [[Barclays|Barclays Bank]], the [[Bank of England]], the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] and [[Downing Street]] At its peak it had a membership of 2000 - second only to Greenpeace in terms of membership and profile.

One tactic was to buy shares in the banks, distribute them to aggrieved customers and then all attend [[Shareholder|shareholder's]] [[Annual general meeting|AGM]]s to ask awkward questions. SAFE ran mobile billboards around major UK cities with the message - "Are you being persecuted by a high street bank? We help people fight banks. Join SAFE and we'll give you a free share in your bank - you can attend its AGM with us and question the Chairman in person."

'''Ethical issues of [[business communication]]''' is the process by which individuals exchange information between other individuals or groups of people. Throughout the process, effective communicators try as clearly and accurately to convey their thoughts, intentions and, objectives to their receiver. Communication is successful only when both the sender and the receiver understand the same information. In today's business environments, effective communication skills are necessary due to the highly informational and technological era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.essentiallifeskills.net/goodcommunicationskills.html|title=Good Communication Skills - Key to Any Success|last=Hereford|first=Z|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of context, communication involves choice, reflects values, and has consequences. For better communication, understanding the obvious and the subtle issues relating to communication is necessary. Any company that aims to be socially and ethically responsible must make a priority of [[Communication ethics|ethical communication]] both inside the company and in its interactions with the public. In theory, many [[Consumer|consumers]] prefer to do business with [[Business|companies]] they believe are ethical which gives those ethical businesses an advantage in the market.

== Overview ==
Some of the vital characteristics of ethical communication are discussed below.

*'''Conveying the point without offending the audience''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/?term=communication|title=Online etymology Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While communicating with the audience, expressing the desired message to them in a significant manner is of primary importance. For instance, the employees in a company can be asked to increase their efficiency in a demanding manner whereas managers and executives will feel offended if the same tone is used on them. There are different ways to explain the exact things to them in a much smoother manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Meenakshi Raman, Prakash|title=Business communication|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=0-19-567695-5|edition=2. impression.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Maintain a relationship with the audience''':
Maintaining the same wavelength with the audience is very important for a communicator to ensure the audiences feel at home. Experienced communicators immediately build a relationship based on trust with the audience as soon as they start speaking. Great orators such as Winston Churchill and Mahatma Gandhi always were able to maintain a relationship with their audience because they were masters at striking the same wavelength of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogin|first=Mary Ellen Guffey, Kathleen Rhodes, Patricia|title=Business communication : process and product|year=2009|publisher=Nelson Education|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-17-650046-7|edition=3rd brief Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Avoid withholding crucial information''':

In the modern era, information is vital for all decisions. Hence, it is essential for any organization to be cautious when communicating with tvitalic. The related information should be absolute, and all crucial information must be conveyed appropriately. Purposely withholding crucial information might result in the public conceiving a bad image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al.]|first=A. C. "Buddy" Krizan |title=Business communication|year=2006|publisher=Thomson South-Western|location=Mason, OH|isbn=0-324-37485-2|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Well organized value system''':
In order to ensure that this concept is successfully practiced and understood in an organization, a well-organized value system must be established throughout the organization by the top management. If an organization functions on the base of value systems common to both the top management and the employees, mutual respect between them will be present. A sound and healthy value system can make way for ethical communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jethwaney|first=Jaishri|title=Corporate communication : principles and practice.|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-806365-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Accuracy of information is necessary''':

Any information that is to be passed on must be true and accurate. Communicating without checking the truth of the information can be highly dangerous for the organization. Identification of the source and testing the information is necessary before communicating it.

== Summary ==
The work of an organizational communication professional consists in developing communication plans that seek to restore trust, not only in the organization but the leaders and in all the people who work for it, in verbally promoting ethical behaviors and generating spaces of communication that help support institutional values.

In this way, both managers and employees will be "on the same page," employees will feel heard and respected and will treat customers in the same way. Also, this will generate more loyalty on the part of the client and, therefore, more business. In addition, a business that communicates internally with ethics will most likely project that image in the business community, will seek to maintain good relations with the government and its most successful businesses.  Without the distractions and negative effects that can have the legal implications of running a business " ethically debatable," the organization will be able to concentrate its efforts on its employees, its products, and its clients.

==Biography==

He was born in [[Mizil]], [[Prahova County]]&lt;ref name="cvdeputat"/&gt; and after attending secondary school at the town's Grigore Tocilescu Theoretical High School, with a focus on mathematics and physics, enrolled at the [[Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies]].

From 1993 to 1997, he was vice president of a furniture producer and distributor in [[Bucharest]]. From 1997 to 2004, he was director of a private firm.&lt;ref name="cvministru"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.gov.ro/gabriel-sandu__l1a164.html Profile at the Romanian Government site]; retrieved May 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

After joining the [[Union of Right-Wing Forces]] (UFD), Sandu became the president of its Prahova County chapter in 1999. He was then vice president (2000-2001) and secretary general (2001-2003) of the party before its absorption into the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL). From 2003 to 2004, he was a supplementary member of the PNL's executive bureau and vice president of its Prahova County chapter. In November 2004, he was [[Romanian legislative election, 2004|elected]] to the Chamber, where he served on the Committee for Political Economy, Reform and Privatisation. From 2004 to 2006, he was part of the PNL's executive bureau and vice president of its Brăila County chapter.&lt;ref name="cvministru"/&gt; In December 2006, he resigned from the PNL to follow [[Theodor Stolojan]] into the new [[Liberal Democratic Party (Romania)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (PLD),&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.mediafax.ro/economic/bio-gabriel-sandu-un-economist-de-45-de-ani-la-comunicatii.html?1686;3669062 "Gabriel Sandu, un economist de 45 de ani la Comunicaţii" ("Gabriel Sandu: an Economist of 45 at Communications")]; Mediafax, 18 December 2008; retrieved May 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; serving as that party's vice president for organisational consolidation and development.

A '''''Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung''''' ({{IPA-de|gəˈzɛlʃaft mɪt bəˈʃʁɛŋktɐ ˈhaftʊŋ|}}, abbreviated '''GmbH''' {{IPA-de|geː ʔɛm beː haː|}} and also '''GesmbH''' in Austria) is a type of [[Juristic person|legal entity]] very common in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]] (where it is equivalent to a [[société à responsabilité limitée]]) and [[Liechtenstein]]. It is an entity broadly equivalent with the [[private limited company]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, and the [[limited liability company]] (LLC) in the United States. The name of the GmbH form emphasizes the fact that the owners (''Gesellschafter'', also known as members&lt;!-- Note: Gesellschafter should rather be translated as member (as used in LLC), since shareholder is reserved for stock corporation. --&gt;) of the entity are not personally liable or credible for the company's debts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/bundesrecht RIS - Bundesrecht konsolidiert - Suche]. Ris.bka.gv.at. Retrieved on 2013-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/gmbhg GmbHG - nichtamtliches Inhaltsverzeichnis]. Bundesrecht.juris.de. Retrieved on 2013-07-19.&lt;/ref&gt; ''GmbH''s are considered [[legal person]]s under German, Swiss and Austrian law. Other variations include '''mbH''' (used when the term ''[[Gesellschaft]]'' is part of the company name itself), and '''gGmbH''' (''gemeinnützige'' GmbH) for [[non-profit]] companies.

The GmbH has become the most common corporation form in Germany, since the AG (''[[Aktiengesellschaft]]''), the other major company form corresponding to a stock corporation, was much more complicated to form and operate until recently.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-ViuQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=9041124446&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=kxV-Trn4B8jHsgag24UL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA Müller, Klaus J.

==History==

The laws governing this type of legal entity were adopted in Germany in 1892, and in Austria in 1906. The concept of limited liability created by these laws inspired the legal establishment of the [[limited liability company]] form in other countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the concept of a limited liability company already existed in the United Kingdom.

==Requirements of formation==

It is widely accepted that a GmbH is formed in three stages: the founding association, which is regarded as a private partnership with full liability of the founding partners/members; the founded company (often styled as "GmbH i.G.", with "i.G." standing for ''in Gründung'' – literally "in the founding stages", with the meaning of "registration pending"); and finally the fully registered GmbH. Only the registration of the company in the Commercial Register (''[[German Trade Register|Handelsregister]]'') provides the GmbH with its full legal status.

The founding act and the articles of association have to be [[Civil law notary|notarized]]. The GmbH law outlines the minimum content of the articles of association, but it is quite common to have a wide range of additional rules in the articles.

Under German law, the GmbH must have a minimum founding capital of €25,000 (§ 5 I GmbHG), from which €12,500 have to be raised before registering in the commercial register (§ 7 II GmbHG). A supervisory board (''Aufsichtsrat'') is required if the company has more than 500 employees, otherwise, the company is run only by the managing directors (''Geschäftsführer'') who have the unrestricted proxy for the company. The members acting collectively may restrict the powers of the managing directors by giving them binding orders. In most cases, the articles of the association list the business activities for which the directors must obtain prior consent from the members. Under German law, a violation of these duties by a managing director will not affect the validity of a contract with a third party, but the GmbH may hold the managing director in question liable for damages.

As of 2008, a derivate form called '''[[Entrepreneurial company (Germany)|Unternehmergesellschaft (haftungsbeschränkt)]]''' (English: "entrepreneurial company (limited liability)") or short  '''UG (haftungsbeschränkt)''' was introduced. It does not require a minimum founding capital and was introduced to assist company founders in setting up a new company. Also, the UG must every year enlarge its capital by at least 25% of its yearly net profit (with some adjustments), until the general minimum of €25,000 is reached (at which point the company may change its name for the more prestigious ''GmbH''). In this case, the word ''haftungsbeschränkt'' must not be abbreviated.

Because a legal entity with liability limited to the contributed capital was regarded in the 19th century as something dangerous, German law has many restrictions unknown to [[common law]] systems. A number of business transactions have to be [[Civil law notary|notarized]], such as transfer of shares, issuing of stock, and amendments to the articles of association. Many of those measures have to be filed with the company registry where they are checked by special judges or other judicial officers. This can be a tiresome and time-consuming process, as in most cases the desired measures are legally valid only when entered into the registry. The founding process is expensive. Normally the foundation of new GmbH cost about 1000€ - 3000€.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.juraforum.de/lexikon/gesellschaft-mit-beschraenkter-haftung |accessdate= 2018-09-29 |location=Hannover |title=GmbH gründen - alles zur Haftung, Geschäftsführer und Auflösung }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because there is no central company registry in Germany but rather several hundred connected to regional courts, the administration of the law can be rather different between [[States of Germany|German states]]. Since 2007 there has been an internet-based central company register for the whole of Germany, called ''Unternehmensregister''.

'''Gilbert Melville Grosvenor''', born on May 5, 1931, became president and chairman of the [[National Geographic Society]] after having served as the editor of ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="CG"&gt;Lanken, Dane. "The bee in Grosvenor's bonnet", ''Canadian Geographic'', Vol. 116.6, November–December 1996: pp. 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he retired after 23 years as Chairman of the Society.&lt;ref name="Wash Post on retirement"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heath|first1=Thomas|title=Gilbert Grosvenor steps down as National Geographic Society chairman after 23 years|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2010/10/26/ST2010102607625.html?sid=ST2010102607625|publisher=Washington Post|date=October 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grosvenor has received 14 honorary doctorates and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005 for his leadership in geography education. "As the world grows smaller and more interdependent daily, our country's future absolutely depends on our ability to see the connections between ourselves and our global neighbors," Grosvenor told an interviewer recently.&lt;ref name="Grosvenor Center"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview of Gilbert M.

==Biography==
Born in [[Washington, D.C.]], Grosvenor is the son of [[Melville Bell Grosvenor]] and the great-grandson of [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. He received a B.A. in psychology from Yale University in 1954. Between his junior and senior years, he volunteered in  the Netherlands in efforts to recover from the [[North Sea flood of 1953]] and co-authored an article that was published in the National Geographic. "Although I'm not sure I realized it at the time, it changed my life," Grosvenor recently recalled. "I discovered the power of journalism. And that's what we are all about—recording those chronicles of planet Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why National Geographic Is a Family Affair|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/02/150215-national-geographic-three-questions-history-geography/|publisher=NationalGeographic.com|date=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently joined the staff of the magazine as a picture editor.

In 1970, Grosvenor assumed the position of editor of ''National Geographic Magazine''.&lt;ref name="CG" /&gt; He served as editor until 1980, when he became president of the National Geographic Society, additionally becoming chairman of the board of trustees (on which he served from 1966 to 2014) in 1987. He retired as president in 1996 and chairman in 2011, since which time he has served as an honorary director of [[The Explorers Club]].

In 1996, Grosvenor was awarded a Gold Medal by the [[Royal Canadian Geographical Society]] and the [[Scottish Geographical Medal]] by the [[Royal Scottish Geographical Society]].&lt;ref name="CG" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsgs.org/awardsandmedals/ Royal Scottish Geographical Society Awards and Medals] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212031439/http://www.rsgs.org/awardsandmedals/ |date=February 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grosvenor was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the highest civilian honor in the [[United States]], by President [[George W. Bush]] on June 23, 2004.

The '''Global Climate Coalition''' (GCC) (1989–2001) was an international [[lobbying|lobbyist]] group of businesses that opposed action to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and challenged the science behind [[global warming]]. The GCC was the largest industry group active in climate policy and the most prominent industry advocate in international climate negotiations. The GCC was involved in opposition to the [[Kyoto Protocol]], and played a role in blocking ratification by the United States. The coalition promoted the views of [[climate change denial|climate skeptic]]s. The GCC dissolved in 2001 after membership declined in the face of improved understanding of the role of greenhouse gases in [[climate change]] and of public criticism.

== Founding ==

The Global Climate Coalition (GCC) was formed in 1989 as a project under the auspices of the [[National Association of Manufacturers]].&lt;ref name=levyrothenberg&gt;{{harvnb|Levy|Rothenberg|1999}}: On the organizational level, the three major US automobile companies, as well as the [[American Automobile Manufacturers Association]] (AAMA) worked largely through the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), which was formed in 1989, initially under the auspices of the [[National Association of Manufacturers]] (NAM), but reorganized as an independent entity in 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The GCC was formed to represent the interests of the major producers and users of [[fossil fuel]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kolk |first1=Ans |first2=David |last2=Levy |chapter=Multinationals and global climate change.

The Coalition's mission was to oppose policy action on climate change. ExxonMobil and the Coalition argued that global warming was a natural phenomenon and that human actions were not contributing to it.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mooney|2005}}: In 1989, the petroleum and automotive industries and the National Association of Manufacturers forged the Global Climate Coalition to oppose mandatory actions to address global warming.&lt;/ref&gt; and to challenge the science behind [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|2003}}: Exxon's backing of third-party groups is a marked contrast to its more public role in the Global Climate Coalition, an industry group formed in 1989 to challenge the science around global warming.&lt;/ref&gt; Context for the founding of the GCC from 1988 included the establishment of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dunlap |first1=Riley E. |first2=Aaron M. |last2=McCright |chapter=Organized climate change denial |title=The Oxford Handbook of Climate Change and Society |year=2011 |pages=144–160 |chapter-url=http://scottvalentine.net/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/dunlap_cc_denial.302183828.pdf |isbn=9780199566600 |accessdate=February 23, 2016 |quote=The Global Climate Coalition (GCC), formed in 1989 in reaction to the establishment of the IPCC, was an early front group designed to combat evidence of climate change and climate policy making.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NASA]] climatologist [[James Hansen]]'s congressional testimony that climate change was occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGregor|2008}}: One of the reasons given for its formation was that in 1988 there was a: “very alarmist presentation by James Hansen of NASA to a Senate Committee that climate change was taking place”.&lt;/ref&gt; The government affairs' offices of five or six corporations recognized that they had been inadequately organized for the [[Montreal Protocol]], the international treaty that phased out [[ozone]] depleting [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s, and the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] in the United States, and recognized that fossil fuels would be targeted for regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Franz|1998}}: The GCC began when the federal affairs representatives of five or six companies realized that they had not been organized for the Clean Air Act and its amendments or for the Montreal protocol. By 1989, it seemed clear the climate issue would come to directly address fossil fuels.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levy|Rothenberg|1999}}: A senior GCC staff member, discussing motivations for the creation of the GCC, expressed the view that industry had “been caught napping” by the ozone issue, and that there was also considerable dissatisfaction with the Clean Air Act process. As he expressed it, “Boy, if we didn't like the Montreal Protocol, we knew we really wouldn’t like climate change! This is the mother of all issues!”&lt;/ref&gt;

According to GCC's mission statement on the home page of its website, GCC was established: "to coordinate business participation in the international policy debate on the issue of global climate change and global warming,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalclimate.org/index.htm |publisher=Global Climate Coalition |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010302000601/http://www.globalclimate.org/index.htm |archive-date=March 2, 2001 |title=Home |dead-url=yes |accessdate=February 18, 2016 |quote=The Global Climate Coalition is an organization of trade associations established in 1989 to coordinate business participation in the international policy debate on the issue of global climate change and global warming.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and GCC's executive director in a 1993 press release said GCC was organized "as the leading voice for industry on the global climate change issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=John |last=Shlaes |publisher=Global Climate Coalition |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/STATEMENT+BY+JOHN+SHLAES,+EXECUTIVE+DIRECTOR,+GLOBAL+CLIMATE+COALITION-a013111109 |title=Statement by John Shlaes, executive director, Global Climate Coalition |agency=[[PR Newswire]] |date=February 2, 1993 |accessdate=February 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GCC reorganized independently in 1992,&lt;ref name=levyrothenberg/&gt; with the first chairman of the board of directors being the director of government relations for the [[Phillips Petroleum Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGregor|2008}}: ... GCC’s first chairman Thomas Lambrix, director of government relations for Phillips Petroleum.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exxon]] was a founding member, and a founding member of the GCC's board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitman|2015}}: The company, which in 1999 became Exxon Mobil, helped found the Global Climate Coalition, which from 1989 to 2002 argued the role "of greenhouse gases in climate change is not well understood," the ''New York Times'' reported Friday.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Banerjee|Song|Hasemyer|2015}}: "Exxon helped to found and lead the Global Climate Coalition, an alliance of some of the world's largest companies seeking to halt government efforts to curb fossil fuel emissions."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van den Hove|Le Menestrel|De Bettignies|2002}}: Instrumental to the implementation of Exxon’s strategy was its participation in industry and lobby groups. Exxon is a prominent member of the American Petroleum Institute (API), the major US petroleum industry trade association, and was, from the date of its creation in 1989, a board member of the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), one of the most influential US lobbying front group on the climate issue.&lt;/ref&gt; Exxon, and later [[ExxonMobil]], had a leadership role in coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lorenzetti|2015}}: Exxon has known about climate change for almost 40 years, despite its efforts to continue to promote fossil fuels and deny its existence throughout the 1990s as a leader of the Global Climate Coalition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vidal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Banerjee|Song|Hasemyer|2015}}: Exxon helped to found and lead the Global Climate Coalition&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API) was a leading member of the coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mooney|2005}}: In 1989, the petroleum and automotive industries and the National Association of Manufacturers forged the Global Climate Coalition to oppose mandatory actions to address global warming. Exxon—later ExxonMobil—was a leading member, as was the American Petroleum Institute&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lieberman|Rust|2015}}: a collection of energy companies, primarily from the coal sector, created the Global Climate Coalition to fight impending climate change regulations. The group approached the American Petroleum Institute for funding and support in the early 1990s. William O’Keefe, executive vice president of the Petroleum Institute at the time, delivered.&lt;/ref&gt; API's executive vice president was a chairman of the coalition's board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lieberman|Rust|2015}}: William O’Keefe, executive vice president of the Petroleum Institute at the time, delivered. The major oil companies, he recalled, decided “something has to be done.” By 1993, he was sitting on the board, and within a few years, he was chairman.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |magazine=[[Newsweek]] |title=Global Warming Deniers Well Funded |url=http://www.newsweek.com/global-warming-deniers-well-funded-99775 |date=August 12, 2007 |accessdate=February 6, 2016 |quote=There is too much "scientific uncertainty" to justify curbs on greenhouse emissions, William O'Keefe, then a vice president of the American Petroleum Institute and leader of the Global Climate Coalition, suggested in 1996.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other GCC founding members included the [[National Coal Association]], [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], [[American Forest &amp; Paper Association]], and [[Edison Electric Institute]]. GCC's executive director John Shleas was previously the director of government relations at the Edison Electric Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGregor|2008}}: The initial GCC members included major fossil fuel industry organisations (American Petroleum Institute, National Coal Association), major generators and industrial users of electricity (most generators in US use coal) and more general Business Interest NGOs (BINGOs) - US Chamber of Commerce, American Paper Institute and others... Executive Director...John Shlaes, was previously director of government relations at Edison Electric Institute (EEI), the association of investor-owned electric utilities. EEI was a founding member of the GCC.&lt;/ref&gt; GCC was run by [[Ruder Finn]], a public relations firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1997}}: The Global Climate Coalition (GCC), run by Washington P.R. firm Ruder Finn, represents the big oil, gas, coal, and auto corporations.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy activities ==

GCC was one of the most powerful [[lobbying|lobbyist groups]] against action to mitigate global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levy|1997}}: One of the most powerful lobbies opposing action on global warming is the Global Climate Coalition (GCC)&lt;/ref&gt; It was the most prominent industry advocate in international climate negotiations,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levy|Rothenberg|1999}}: Although the GCC was constituted as a U.S.-based organization and was focused on domestic lobbying, a number of US subsidiaries of European multinationals also joined, and the GCC quickly rose to be the most prominent voice of industry, both in the US and in the international negotiations.&lt;/ref&gt; and led a campaign opposed to policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Climatic Change (journal)|Climatic Change]] |date=September 2015 |accessdate=February 23, 2016 |volume=132 |issue=2 |pages=157–171 |title=The climate responsibilities of industrial carbon producers |first1=Peter C. |last1=Frumhoff |first2=Richard |last2=Heede |first3=Naomi |last3=Oreskes |authorlink3=Naomi Oreskes |doi=10.1007/s10584-015-1472-5 |url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10584-015-1472-5.pdf |quote=...leading investor-owned fossil fuel corporations, including ExxonMobil, Shell, and British Petroleum, created the Global Climate Coalition (GCC) to oppose greenhouse gas emission reduction policies. From 1989 to 2002, the GCC led an aggressive lobbying and advertising campaign aimed at achieving these goals by sowing doubt about the integrity of the IPCC and the scientific evidence that heat-trapping emissions from burning fossil fuels drive global warming. They worked successfully to prevent the United States from signing the Kyoto Protocol after it was negotiated in 1997.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GCC was one of the most powerful [[non-governmental organization]]s representing business interests in climate policy, according to Kal Raustiala, professor at the [[UCLA School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Raustiala |first=Kal |chapter=Nonstate actors in the global climate regime |chapter-url=http://graduateinstitute.ch/files/live/sites/iheid/files/shared/iheid/800/luterbacher/luterbacher%20chapter%205%20105.pdf |accessdate=February 12, 2016 |title=International Relations and Global Climate Change |page=117 |year=2001 |isbn=9780262621496 |editor-last1=Luterbacher |editor-first1=Urs |editor-first2=Detlef F. |editor-last2=Sprinz |quote=Perhaps the most powerful broad-based business NGO is the U.S.-based Global Climate Coalition, which has an annual budget of $2 million and a membership roster that comprises many of the most powerful American and European corporations, including several from the energy sector.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GCC's advocacy activities included [[lobbying]] government officials, [[grassroots lobbying]] through press releases and advertising, participation in international climate conferences, criticism of the processes of international climate organizations, critiques of [[climate models]], and personal attacks on scientists and environmentalists. Policy positions advocated by the coalition included denial of [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic climate change]], emphasizing the uncertainty in [[climatology]], advocating for additional research, highlighting the benefits and downplaying the risks of climate change, stressing the priority of economic development, defending national [[sovereignty]], and opposition to the regulation of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.

GCC sent delegations to all of the major international climate conventions. Only nations and non-profits may send official delegates to the [[United Nations Climate Change conference]]s. GCC registered with the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] as a [[non-governmental organization]], and executives from GCC members attended official UN conferences as GCC delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGregor|2008}}: Only not-for-profit organisations and governments are allowed to have delegates at the official international meetings of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC 2007). As GCC was a registered NGO with the UNFCCC, many executives from its member corporations registered as delegates under GCC for the official meetings.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, after U. S. [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] addressed the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) urging caution in responding to global warming, and offering no new proposals, GCC said Bush's speech was "very strong" and concurred with the priorities of economic development and additional research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bush Asks Cautious Response To Threat of Global Warming |page=1 |first=Philip |last=Shabecoff |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 6, 1990 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/06/us/bush-asks-cautious-response-to-threat-of-global-warming.html |accessdate=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; GCC sent 30 attendees to the 1992 [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]],&lt;ref name="Franz 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Franz|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it lobbied to keep targets and timetables out of the [[Framework Convention on Climate Change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Business Woos Delegates to Earth Summit |last=Dolan |first=Maura |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 30, 1992 |page=1 |accessdate=February 18, 2016 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-30/news/mn-224_1_earth-summit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223185658/http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-30/news/mn-224_1_earth-summit|archivedate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, 1992 GCC's executive director wrote in a letter to ''[[The New York Times]]'': "...there is considerable debate on whether or not man-made greenhouse gases (produced primarily by burning fossil fuels) are triggering a dangerous 'global warming' trend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What Global Warming? |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 22, 1992 |first=John |last=Schlaes |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/22/opinion/l-what-global-warming-250692.html |accessdate=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 GCC distributed a half-hour video entitled ''[[The Greening of Planet Earth]]'', to hundreds of journalists, the White House, and several Middle Eastern oil-producing countries, which suggested that increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide could boost crop yields and solve world hunger.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lieberman|Rust|2015}}: For the next 10 years, the coalition, whose annual revenue peaked at about $1.5 million before Kyoto, spent heavily on lobbying and public relations campaigns. As part of the effort, it distributed a video to hundreds of journalists, the White House and several Middle Eastern oil-producing countries suggesting that higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were beneficial for crop production, and could be the solution to world hunger.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helvarg|1996}}: Western Fuels funded a $250,000 video titled ''The Greening of Planet Earth'', which was distributed by the Global Climate Coalition to more than 1,000 U.S. journalists, the White House and various oil states in the Middle East. The video claims that industrial carbon dioxide buildup in the atmosphere acts as a kind of airborne nutrient that aids plant growth and therefore, by increasing crop yields, could be the solution to world hunger.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, after U. S. President [[Bill Clinton]] pledged "to reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases to their 1990 levels by the year 2000," GCC's executive director said it "could jeopardize the economic health of the nation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Berke |first=Richard L. |date=April 22, 1993 |title=Clinton declares new U.S. Policies for Environment |accessdate=February 7, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/22/world/clinton-declares-new-us-policies-for-environment.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; GCC's lobbying was key to the defeat in the [[United States Senate]] of Clinton's 1993 [[energy tax|BTU tax]] proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van den Hove|Le Menestrel|De Bettignies|2002}}: The API and the GCC were very hostile to action on climate change...They were key to defeating President Clinton’s 1993 BTU tax proposal, through lobbying the Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, after [[United States Secretary of Energy]] [[Hazel R. O'Leary]] said the 1992 [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] needed to be strengthened, and that voluntary carbon dioxide reductions may not be enough, GCC said it was: "disturbed by the implication that the President's voluntary climate action plan, which is just getting under way, will be inadequate and that more stringent measures may be needed domestically."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John H. |last=Cushman Jr. |title=Clinton wants to strengthen global pact on air pollution |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 16, 1994 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/16/us/clinton-wants-to-strengthen-global-pact-on-air-pollution.html |accessdate=February 8, 2016 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GCC did not fund original scientific research and its climate claims relied largely on the ''World Climate Review'' and its successor the ''[[World Climate Report]]'' edited by [[Patrick Michaels]] and funded by the [[Western Fuels Association]].&lt;ref name="Franz 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Franz|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; GCC promoted the views of [[climate change denial|climate skeptic]]s such as Michaels, [[Fred Singer]], and [[Richard Lindzen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levy|Rothenberg|1999}}: The GCC's efforts to challenge the science of climate change took a number of forms. It actively promoted the views of climate skeptics such as [[Patrick Michaels]], [[Fred Singer]], and [[Richard Lindzen]] in its literature, press releases, and congressional testimony, and would direct press inquiries to these people.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, GCC published a report entitled ''Global warming and extreme weather: fact vs. fiction'' written by [[Robert E. Davis (climatologist)|Robert E. Davis]].&lt;ref name="Franz 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Franz|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Davis |first=Robert E. |authorlink=Robert E. Davis (climatologist) |title=Global warming and extreme weather: fact vs. fiction |location=[[Washington D.C.]] |publisher=Global Climate Coalition |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GCC members questioned the efficacy of climate change denial and shifted their message to highlighting the economic costs of proposed greenhouse gas emission regulations and the limited effectiveness of proposals exempting developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levy|2001}}: Within the GCC, more companies were questioning the value of aggressively denying the climate problem...In the run-up to the Kyoto conference in December 1997, the GCC decided to shift strategy. Instead of challenging the science, industry's message shifted to the high cost and limited environmental effectiveness of an agreement that excludes developing countries from emission controls.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, after the [[United Nations Climate Change conference]] in [[Berlin]] agreed to negotiate [[greenhouse gas]] emission limits, GCC's executive director said the agreement gave "developing countries like China, India and Mexico a free ride" and would "change the relations between sovereign countries and the United Nations. This could have very significant implications. It could be a way of capping our economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kinzer |first=Stephen |title=Nations Pledge to Set Limits by 1997 on Warming Gases |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 8, 1995 |accessdate=February 7, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/08/world/nations-pledge-to-set-limits-by-1997-on-warming-gases.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stevens |first=William K. |title=Climate Talks Enter Harder Phase of Cutting Back Emissions |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 11, 1995 |accessdate=February 7, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/11/science/climate-talks-enter-harder-phase-of-cutting-back-emissions.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a [[Washington, D.C.]] press conference on the eve of the second [[United Nations Climate Change conference]] in [[Geneva]], GCC's executive director said, "The time for decision is not yet now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cushman Jr. |first=John H. |date=July 8, 1996 |title=Report says global warming poses threat to public health |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 8, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/08/world/report-says-global-warming-poses-threat-to-public-health.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the conference in Geneva, GCC issued a statement that said it was too early to determine the causes of global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Climate Session Opens with Words of Warning |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 9, 1996 |accessdate=February 8, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/09/science/climate-session-opens-with-words-of-warning.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; GCC representatives lobbied scientists at the September, 1996 IPCC conference in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helvarg|1996}}: At the I.P.C.C.'s most recent session in Mexico City on September 11–13, representatives from industry's Climate Council, Global Climate Coalition, [[Edison Electric Institute]], [[World Coal Institute]] and [[IPIECA]] (another oil group) were buttonholing scientists, trying to weaken report language and pressing for restrictions on new research.&lt;/ref&gt;

After actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], chairman of [[Earth Day]] 2000, interviewed Clinton for [[ABC News]], GCC sent out an e-mail that said that DiCaprio's first car was a [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] and that his current car was a [[Chevrolet Tahoe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=James |last1=Barron |first2=David |last2=Rohde |first3=Linda |last3=Lee |title=Public Lives|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 8, 2016 |date=April 13, 2000 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/13/nyregion/public-lives.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Predicting Future Climate Change: A Primer'' ===

In 1995, GCC assembled an advisory committee of scientific and technical experts to compile an internal-only, 17-page report on climate science entitled ''Predicting Future Climate Change: A Primer'', which said: “The scientific basis for the Greenhouse Effect and the potential impact of human emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2 on climate is well established and cannot be denied.” In early 1996, GCC's operating committee asked the advisory committee to redact the sections that rebutted contrarian arguments, and accepted the report and distributed it to members. The draft document was disclosed in a 2007 lawsuit filed by the auto industry against California’s efforts to regulate automotive greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="Revkin 2009"&gt;{{harvnb|Revkin|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/07/Climate-Deception-Dossier-7_GCC-Climate-Primer.pdf |first=Leonard S. |last=Bernstein |date=December 21, 1995 |accessdate=February 11, 2016 |title=Approval draft: Predicting Future Climate Change: A Primer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The New York Times'', the primer demonstrated that "even as the coalition worked to sway opinion, its own scientific and technical experts were advising that the science backing the role of greenhouse gases in global warming could not be refuted."&lt;ref name="Revkin 2009"/&gt; According to the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] in 2015, the primer was: "remarkable for indisputably showing that, while some fossil fuel companies’ deception about climate science has continued to the present day, at least two decades ago the companies’ own scientific experts were internally alerting them about the realities and implications of climate change."&lt;ref name="Mulvey 2015"&gt;{{harvnb|Mulvey|Shulman|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IPCC Second Assessment Report ===

GCC was an industry participant in the review process of the [[IPCC Second Assessment Report]].&lt;ref name="Franz 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Franz|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, prior to the publication of the Second Assessment Report, GCC distributed a report entitled ''The IPCC: Institutionalized Scientific Cleansing'' to reporters, US Congressmen, and scientists. The coalition report said that [[Benjamin D. Santer]], the lead author of Chapter 8 in the assessment, entitled "Detection of Climate Change and Attribution of Causes," had altered the text, after acceptance by the Working Group, and without approval of the authors, to strike content characterizing the uncertainty of the science. [[Frederick Seitz]] repeated GCC's charges in a letter to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' published June 12, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Naomi |last1=Oreskes |authorlink1=Naomi Oreskes |first2=Erik M. |last2=Conway |authorlink2=Erik M.

Santer and his co-authors said the edits were integrations of comments from peer review as per agreed IPCC processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucar.edu/communications/quarterly/summer96/insert.html |title=Special insert--An open letter to Ben Santer |publisher=[[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]] |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |date=Summer 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition to Kyoto Protocol ===

GCC was the main industry group in the United States opposed to the [[Kyoto Protocol]],&lt;ref name=vidal/&gt; which committed signatories to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. The coalition "was the leading industry group working in opposition to the Kyoto Protocol," according to [[Greenpeace]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Climate Coalition Meeting |date=June 21, 2001 |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/research/global-climate-coalition-meeti/ |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |accessdate=February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led opposition to the Kyoto Protocol, according to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]].''&lt;ref name=latimes20000315&gt;{{cite news |title=Briefly: Autos; Also |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/15/business/fi-8936 |date=March 15, 2000 |accessdate=February 21, 2016 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |quote=General Motors Corp. said it has quit the Global Climate Coalition, a lobbying group that has led the opposition to a 1997 global warming treaty reached in Kyoto, Japan.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1997, GCC spent about $1 million annually lobbying against limits on {{CO2}} emissions;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levy|1997}}: the GCC has spent nearly $1 million a year to convince policy makers that proposals to limit CO emissions: "are premature and are not justified by the state of scientific knowledge or the economic risks they create."&lt;/ref&gt; before Kyoto, GCC annual revenue peaked around $1.5 million;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lieberman|Rust|2015}}: the coalition, whose annual revenue peaked at about $1.5 million before Kyoto&lt;/ref&gt; GCC spent $13 million on advertising in opposition to the Kyoto treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farley|1997}}: The cost of a recent, influential $13-million advertising campaign sponsored by the Global Climate Coalition equaled Greenpeace's entire annual budget.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mitchell&gt;{{harvnb|Mitchell|1997}}: Using the same media team of Goddard-Claussen that produced the Harry and Louise ads, the Global Climate Coalition, an association of industry groups and some unions, has already run $13 million in television advertisements against the agreement.&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition funded the Global Climate Information Project and hired the advertising firm that produced the 1993-1994 [[Harry and Louise]] advertising campaign which opposed Clinton's health care initiative.&lt;ref name="Franz 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Franz|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mitchell/&gt; The advertisements said, “the UN Climate Treaty isn’t Global...and it won’t work”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van den Hove|Le Menestrel|De Bettignies|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Americans will pay the price...50 cents more for every gallon of gasoline."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2000}}: Among other things, the ads indicated that “Americans will pay the price ... 50¢ more for every gallon of gasoline,”even though there was no proposal for such a tax.&lt;/ref&gt;

GCC opposed the signing of the Kyoto Protocol by Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farley|1997}}: A group of energy companies, the Global Climate Coalition, has urged President Clinton not to OK signing a treaty here&lt;/ref&gt; GCC was influential in the withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol by the administration of President [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahm|2009}}: The Global Climate Coalition was influential in Bush administration decision making on withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol and policy positions on a successor treaty.&lt;/ref&gt; According to briefing notes prepared by the [[United States Department of State]] for the under-secretary of state, Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol was "in part based on input from" GCC.&lt;ref name=vidal&gt;{{harvnb|Vidal|2005}}: In briefing papers given before meetings to the US under-secretary of state, [[Paula Dobriansky]], between 2001 and 2004, the administration is found thanking Exxon executives for the company's "active involvement" in helping to determine climate change policy, and also seeking its advice on what climate change policies the company might find acceptable. "Potus [president of the United States] rejected Kyoto in part based on input from you [the Global Climate Coalition]," says one briefing note before Ms Dobriansky's meeting with the GCC, the main anti-Kyoto US industry group, which was dominated by Exxon.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mooney|2005}}: ...the Global Climate Coalition. For her meeting with the latter group, one of Dobriansky’s prepared talking points was “POTUS [President Bush in Secret Service parlance] rejected Kyoto, in part, based on input from you.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brill|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; GCC lobbying was key to the July, 1997 unanimous passage in the [[United States Senate]] of the [[Byrd-Hagel Resolution]], which reflected the coalition's position that restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions must include developing countries.&lt;ref name="Franz 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Franz|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van den Hove|Le Menestrel|De Bettignies|2002}}: The GCC was indeed instrumental to the passing the Byrd–Hagel Senate resolution in July 1997&lt;/ref&gt; GCC's chairman told a US congressional committee that mandatory greenhouse gas emissions limits were: "an unjustified rush to judgement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stevens |first=William K. |title=Industries Revisit Global Warming |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 8, 2016 |date=August 5, 1997 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/05/world/industries-revisit-global-warming.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition sent 50 delegates to the third Conference of the Parties to the [[United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Kyoto]].&lt;ref name="Franz 1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Franz|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 11, 1997, the day the Kyoto delegates reached agreement on legally binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions, GCC's chairman said the agreement would be defeated by the US Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stevens |first=William K. |title=Meeting Reaches Accord to Reduce Greenhouse Gases |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 8, 2016 |date=December 11, 1997 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/11/world/meeting-reaches-accord-to-reduce-greenhouse-gases.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, GCC's executive director compared the Kyoto Protocol to the ''[[RMS Titanic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Some Energy Executives Urge U.S. Shift on Global Warming |last1=Revkin |first1=Andrew C. |authorlink1=Andrew Revkin |last2=Banerjee |first2=Neela |date=August 1, 2001 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/01/business/some-energy-executives-urge-us-shift-on-global-warming.html |accessdate=February 8, 2016 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership decline and dissolution ==

GCC's challenge to science prompted a backlash from environmental groups.&lt;ref name="Jones 2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|Levy|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmentalists described GCC as a "club for polluters" and called for members to withdraw their support.&lt;ref name=nyt20000107&gt;{{cite news |title=DaimlerChrysler Leaving Climate Coalition |newspaper=''[[The New York Times]]'' |accessdate=February 8, 2016 |date=January 7, 2000 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/07/business/daimlerchrysler-leaving-climate-coalition.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Abandonment of the Global Climate Coalition by leading companies is partly in response to the mounting evidence that the world is indeed getting warmer," according to environmentalist [[Lester R. Brown]].&lt;ref name="Brown 2000"&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[European Green Party|Green Party]] delegates to the [[European Parliament]] introduced an unsuccessful proposal that the [[World Meteorological Organization]] name hurricanes after GCC members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Karliner |first=Joshua |title=Petroleum Weather |journal=Earth Island Journal |publisher=[[Earth Island Institute]] |volume=14 |date=December 1, 1998 |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defections weakened the coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levy|2001}}: The GCC was weakened by a series of defections&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, [[BP|British Petroleum]] resigned and later announced support for the Kyoto Protocol and commitment to greenhouse gas emission reductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How Green Is BP? |first=Darcy |last=Frey |date=December 8, 2002 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 8, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/08/magazine/how-green-is-bp.html}}: In 1996, BP resigned from the Global Climate Coalition, then offered its support of the Kyoto Protocol&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, [[Royal Dutch Shell]] withdrew after criticism from European environmental groups. In 1999, [[Ford Motor Company]] was the first US company to withdraw; the ''New York Times'' described the departure as "the latest sign of divisions within heavy industry over how to respond to global warming."&lt;ref name=nyt19991207&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/07/business/ford-announces-its-withdrawal-from-global-climate-coalition.html |title=Ford Announces Its Withdrawal From Global Climate Coalition |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DuPont]] left the coalition in 1997 and [[Shell Oil Company|Shell Oil (US)]] left in 1998. In 2000, GCC corporate members were the targets of a national student-run university [[divestment|divestiture]] campaign. Between December, 1999 and early March, 2000, [[Texaco]], the [[Southern Company]], [[General Motors]] and [[Daimler AG|Daimler-Chrysler]] withdrew.&lt;ref name=latimes20000315/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt20000107/&gt;&lt;ref name=gelbspan&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heatisonline.org/contentserver/objecthandlers/index.cfm?id=3440&amp;method=full |title=GCC Suffers Technical Knockout, Industry defections decimate Global Climate Coalition |publisher=The Heat is Online |accessdate=February 8, 2016 |authorlink=Ross Gelbspan |first=Ross |last=Gelbspan |quote=Between December, 1999 and early March, 2000, the GCC was deserted by Ford, Daimler-Chrysler, Texaco, the Southern Company and General Motors...The defeat of the Global Climate Coalition reflects, among other things, a student divestiture campaign which urged universities to divest their holdings in companies that belonged to the GCC. It also represents a sustained effort by the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility, which has mounted shareholder actions against a number of intransigent corporations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some former coalition members joined the Business Environmental Leadership Council within the [[Center for Climate and Energy Solutions|Pew Center on Global Climate Change]] which represented diverse stakeholders, including business interests, with a commitment to peer-reviewed scientific research and accepted the need for emissions restrictions to address climate change.&lt;ref name="Jones 2007"/&gt;

In 2000, GCC restructured as an association of [[trade association]]s; membership was limited to trade associations, and individual corporations were represented through their trade association. Brown called the restructuring "a thinly veiled effort to conceal the real issue - the loss of so many key corporate members."&lt;ref name="Mulvey 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown 2000"/&gt;

In 2001, after US President George W. Bush withdrew the US from the Kyoto process, GCC disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |title=Oil industry targets EU climate policy |first=David |last=Adam |date=December 7, 2005 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/dec/08/greenpolitics.europeanunion |accessdate=February 8, 2016 |quote=During the 1990s US oil companies and other corporations funded a group called the Global Climate Coalition, which emphasised uncertainties in climate science and disputed the need to take action.

== Reception ==

In 2015, the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] compared GCC's role in the public policy debate on climate change to the roles in the public policy debate on tobacco safety of the [[Tobacco Institute]], the tobacco industry's lobbyist group, and the Council for Tobacco Research, which promoted misleading science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mulvey|Shulman|2015}}: With key members bowing out, the GCC announced in 2000 that it would undergo a “strategic restructuring” much as the tobacco industry, under growing pressure, gave up its lobbying arm (the Tobacco Institute) and its wing devoted to promoting misleading science about the links between tobacco and disease (the Council for Tobacco Research) as part of the 1998 master settlement agreement with U.S. states.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahm|2009}}: The strategy drew on tactics pioneered by the tobacco industry in the 1960s - to promote doubt and uncertainty in the minds of the public that human actions were not contributing to global warming.&lt;/ref&gt; Environmentalist [[Bill McKibben]] said that, by promoting doubt about the science, "throughout the 1990s, even as other nations took action, the fossil fuel industry's Global Climate Coalition managed to make American journalists treat the accelerating warming as a he-said-she-said story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Climate of Denial |first=Bill |last=McKibben |authorlink=Bill McKibben |date=May 2005 |magazine=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2005/05/climate-denial |accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', GCC members integrated projections from climate models into their operational planning while publicly criticising the models.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lieberman|Rust|2015}}: O’Keefe said no one in the coalition denied the existence of global warming, but there was uncertainty about how well the models could project its future impact. What coalition members felt certain about, he said, was that any government-mandated emission reductions would have “a clear negative impact,” including unemployment, higher energy prices and a drop in the U.S. standard of living. When it came to their own investments, though, coalition members relied on scientific projections — from rising sea levels to thawing permafrost — to design and protect multibillion-dollar investments in pipelines, gas developments and offshore oil rigs.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Grand Hyatt New York''' is a hotel located directly east of the [[Grand Central Terminal]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Originally named '''The Commodore Hotel,''' it opened on January 28, 1919. In 1980, [[Donald Trump]] encased the outside of the building in glass and renovated the inside as part of his first construction project in [[Manhattan]].

==Commodore Hotel==
The Commodore Hotel was constructed by the [[Bowman-Biltmore Hotels]] group. The structure itself was developed as part of ''Terminal City'', a complex of palatial hotels and offices connected to [[Grand Central Terminal]] and all owned by the New York State Realty and Terminal Company (NYSRTC), a division of the [[New York Central Railroad]] (NYCRR). The Commodore was named after "Commodore" [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], the founder of NYCRR; a statue of Vanderbilt is located outside the hotel. The Commodore was designed by [[Warren &amp; Wetmore]] and leased by the NYSRTC to the Bowman-Biltmore Hotels Corporation, of which John McEntee Bowman was president.&lt;ref name=ar&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C9DmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA55| title=The World's Newest and Largest Hotels: The Hotel Pennsylvania and The Hotel Commodore| date=March 1919| volume=VIII| number=3| journal=[[Architectural Review]]| page=55| via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Commodore_Hotel,_New_York_City,_1921.jpg|thumb|left|The Commodore Hotel, 1921]]
The Commodore opened on January 28, 1919. Herbert R. Stone, of NYSRTC, oversaw the decor of its 2,000 rooms. The lobby, called the "Most Beautiful Lobby in The World," was the single largest room in the hotel, with modern low ceilings and a waterfall designed by John B. Smeraldi. A group of conventioneers once told Bowman that "New York City was like a circus," so the next day Bowman, ever a showman, arranged to place a circus, complete with elephants, in the grand ballroom. Another popular spot was the Century Room, which boasted its own orchestra. The Commodore shared a parking garage with its sister hotel, the [[New York Biltmore Hotel]], which had been Bowman-Biltmore's first hotel investment.&lt;ref name=ar /&gt; Another Terminal City property – [[The Roosevelt Hotel (Manhattan)|The Roosevelt Hotel]], originally a United Hotel asset – merged with Bowman-Biltmore Corporation on March 4, 1929, giving Terminal City access to all railroad passenger traffic in and out of New York City. One notable person to have stayed at The Commodore was [[Albert Einstein]], who stayed at the hotel for a few weeks in April 1921 during his tour of the east coast of the US promoting the creation of Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

The Commodore was successful for decades, and in June 1967, NYCRR – which by then was running the hotel through a division called Realty Hotels – upgraded the Commodore with a 3.4 million-dollar refurbishment. On May 10, 1972, while John R. Garside was the hotel's general manager, the Commodore became the first hotel in New York City to show in-room movies through Player Cinema Systems. By the late 1970s, both the railroad line (now called [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]]) and the hotel had become less successful. On May 11, 1977, the now-bankrupt railroad's asset manager, Victor Palmieri, told the city that the Commodore had lost $1.5 million in 1976 and might have to be shuttered. 

At that point, Donald Trump reached an option agreement with Penn Central to purchase the Commodore.&lt;ref name="mj"&gt;{{cite web |first=Max J. |last=Rosenthal |title=The Trump Files: How Donald Tricked New York Into Giving Him His First Huge Deal |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/07/trump-files-how-donald-tricked-new-york-huge-deal/ |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |date=July 11, 2016 | page= |accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyrb"&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Traub |title=Golden Boy |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2000/12/21/golden-boy/ |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |date=December 21, 2000 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506142343/https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2000/12/21/golden-boy/ |archive-date=2016-05-06 |access-date=2018-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump, however, did not have the $250,000 necessary to secure the option.&lt;ref name="mj"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nym"&gt;{{cite web |first=Frank |last=Rich |authorlink= |title=The Original Donald Trump |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/04/frank-rich-roy-cohn-the-original-donald-trump.html |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=April 29, 2018 | page= |accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Trump's father, [[Fred Trump]], had a long time political connection through the [[Brooklyn Democratic Party|Brooklyn Democratic machine]] to then-Mayor [[Abraham Beame]].&lt;ref name="nym"/&gt; Despite the city being in the midst of the [[History of New York City (1946–77)#Fiscal crisis|worst fiscal crisis]] in its history, Beame's deputy mayor, Stanley Friedman, pushed through a 40-year, $400 million tax abatement on the property.&lt;ref name="nym"/&gt; Asked by city officials to supply a copy of the agreement with Penn Central, Trump sent the option agreement paperwork minus the signatures.&lt;ref name="mj"/&gt; The abatement moved forward as if the agreement had been signed and as if Trump had paid to secure the option.&lt;ref name="mj"/&gt; Trump was then able to convince the [[Hyatt Corporation|Hyatt hotel chain]] to partner with the [[Trump Organization]] and purchase the Commodore.&lt;ref name="mj"/&gt;

==Grand Hyatt New York==
The Trump Organization rebuilt the hotel at a cost of $100 million, gutting the first few floors of the interior down to their steel frame (although the same basic layout of public rooms was retained) and placing a new reflective glass facade on top of the existing masonry exterior. The work was done by the firm of Gruzen Samton,&lt;ref name="trump"&gt;{{cite book| title=The Art of the Deal| last=Trump| first=Donald| year=1987| publisher=Warner Books| isbn=978-0394555287}}&lt;/ref&gt; with architect [[Der Scutt]], who would later design [[Trump Tower]], serving as design consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Fred A.| last=Bernstein| date=March 16, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/arts/design/16scutt.html |title=Der Scutt, Modernist Architect, Dies at 75 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only portion of the hotel's decor left untouched was the foyer to the grand ballroom, with its neoclassical columns and plasterwork. The hotel re-opened on September 25, 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/the-grand-hyatt-new-york-a-30-story-glass-box-officially-news-photo/515554474#new-york-the-grand-hyatt-new-york-a-30story-glass-box-officially-on-picture-id515554474 |title=Grand Hyatt Hotel Pictures |publisher=Getty Images |date=1980-09-25 |accessdate=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the Grand Hyatt New York, with [[Governor of New York]] [[Hugh Carey]] and [[Mayor of New York City]] [[Ed Koch]] in attendance. The new facade was criticized as out of place and as having destroyed the character of East 42nd Street.  The American Institute of Architects’ guide to New York buildings referred to the facade as an “utter and inexcusable outrage.”&lt;ref name="nyrb"/&gt; 

[[File:Grand central chrysler.jpg|thumb|left|upright|View eastward from [[Vanderbilt Avenue]] at night. The Grand Hyatt is east of the Grand Central Terminal and west of the Chrysler Building.]]

In 1989, New York State officials ordered the hotel to pay New York City $2.9 million in rent that had been withheld by the hotel in 1986 due to "unusual" accounting changes approved by Donald Trump.&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/inside-a-donald-trump-audit-missing-books-and-unusual-accounting/| title=Inside a Donald Trump audit: Missing books and unusual accounting| last=Kates| first=Graham| date=August 8, 2016| work=[[CBS News]]| access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation by New York City auditors noted that the hotel was missing basic financial records and found that the hotel was using procedures that violated [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (United States)|Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]].

The Trump/Hyatt partnership eventually collapsed, with Trump filing a civil racketeering suit against Hyatt owner [[Jay Pritzker]] on July 28, 1993, alleging that Hyatt had used improper accounting practices, in order to force Trump out of the partnership with Hyatt, which restricted the chain from operating any other convention hotel in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Henriques |first=Diana B. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/29/business/trump-sues-pritzker-as-a-feud-goes-public.html |title=Trump Sues Pritzker As a Feud Goes Public |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 29, 1983 |accessdate=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pritzkers countersued on March 28, 1994, alleging that Trump had violated their partnership by failing to remain solvent, using his share in the hotel as collateral for bank loans, and refusing to cover his share of the cost of necessary repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Henriques |first=Diana B. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/29/business/company-news-pritzker-vs-trump-and-vice-versa.html |title=COMPANY NEWS; Pritzker vs. Trump, and Vice Versa |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 29, 1994 |accessdate=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The much-needed renovation of the hotel finally began on April 8, 1996, and continued through that August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Grand Hyatt announces multi-million dollar renovation| url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18335583.html| date=March 20, 1996| newspaper=[[Real Estate Weekly]]| accessdate=July 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, on October 7, 1996, the Pritzkers bought Trump's half-share in the hotel for $142 million, ending the partnership.&lt;ref name="trump.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trump.com/real-estate-portfolio/new-york-past/grand-hyatt-hotel/ |title=The Grand Hyatt Hotel |publisher=The Trump Organization |accessdate=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/08/business/trump-sells-hyatt-share-to-pritzkers.html |title=Trump Sells Hyatt Share To Pritzkers |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 8, 1996 |accessdate=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hotel won the 2007 and 2008 ''Corporate and Incentive Travel'' magazine "Award of Excellence." It was completely renovated in 2011, at a cost of $130 million, at which point the 1980s modern interiors were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Fred A. |last=Bernstein |date=January 11, 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/12/business/12hyatt.html |title=Grand Hyatt Makover Sheds the Trump Glitter |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renovation was complicated by the structure's 1919 origins, including 138 different guest-room configurations.

'''Hazel Crane''' (1951 &amp;ndash; 10 November 2003) was a prominent socialite, [[businesswoman]] and posthumous memoirist in South Africa. She was assassinated on 10 November 2003 near her mansion home in the plush Northern [[Johannesburg]] suburb of [[Abbotsford, South Africa|Abbotsford]], the same suburb where controversial mining magnate [[Brett Kebble]] was murdered later in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Gill Gifford, [http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/kebble-and-hazel-crane-murdered-in-same-area-254700 "Kebble and Hazel Crane murdered in same area"], ''IOL'' (South Africa), 28 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born as '''Hazel Elizabeth Magee''' in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], she emigrated to then [[Rhodesia]]&lt;ref name=age/&gt; as a child and later to South Africa in adult life. In South Africa she was involved in several philanthropic committees and projects, such as the educational sponsorship of poor students.&lt;ref name=tfb/&gt;

==Later life==
Crane was previously married to Anthony Crane, although he was killed at age 25 in combat in the [[Rhodesian Bush War]]. The couple already had one child, and at the time of her husband's death, Crane was pregnant with their second child.&lt;ref name=age&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/World/High-society-rocked-by-the-shady-past-of-one-of-its-own/2004/12/23/1103391892184.html|title=High society rocked by the shady past of one of its own|publisher=The Age| date =24 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later had a tumultuous marriage with alleged Israeli mafia boss Shai Avissar. At the time of his murder in 1999, the couple were estranged.&lt;ref name=age/&gt;

She was a close friend of [[Winnie Mandela]], who attended her funeral and was the chief witness in her wedding to Avissar. Crane accompanied Mandela during her hearings before the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]].&lt;ref name=tfb/&gt;

Crane was shot dead in her car in November 2003, while travelling to the Johannesburg High Court to attend the trial of alleged [[Israeli mafia]] member Lior Saat, accused of murdering Crane's estranged husband near [[Sunninghill, Gauteng]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_1443209,00.html|title=Socialite dies after shooting|publisher=News24|date=10 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crane had been travelling with a female companion, who was shot in the hand, but police determined that the incident was a "direct attack" on Crane's life, who was shot in the head, leg, chest and arm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_1443216,00.html Hazel Crane killed in attack]&lt;/ref&gt; It later emerged that Crane had been expected to testify in the murder case against Saat and a source close to Crane said that she knew too much, being able to identify and implicate a number of figures in the Saat murder case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_1444520,00.html "Hazel knew too much"]&lt;/ref&gt; She was the third state witness in the Saat murder trial to be murdered; Giulio Bascelli was shot in the head in a deserted garage soon after Avassi's death in 1999 and Carlo Binne was shot dead at the Gecko Lounge, a Johannesburg nightclub, in April 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/nov/16/southafrica.andrewmeldrum1 "Israeli gangsters blamed for murder of Winnie's friend"]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Prior to her death, Crane was working with a British journalist, David Kray on her memoirs. The biography, ''Hazel Crane: Testimony from Beyond the Grave''&lt;ref name=tfb&gt;{{cite book|year=2004|first=David|last=Kray|first2=Hazel|last2=Crane| title=Hazel Crane: Testimony from Beyond the Grave|publisher=New Africa Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; received a [[List of works published posthumously|posthumous]] release in 2004 and contained several shocking details about the socialite's colourful past. The book details Crane's own secret life of crime. She made her fortune by smuggling [[diamonds]] and [[emeralds]], making blackmarket currency deals, owning a striptease joint and selling hard-core pornography. She also tells of how she would tuck emeralds into her beehive hairdo or pack them into her son's nappies for smuggling.&lt;ref name=age/&gt; Prior to a crime career, she trained as a State Registered Nurse in Rhodesia and in later life was an active businesswoman. &lt;!-- During her time in Rhodesia as a diamond smuggler, she developed a powerful team of Johannesburg associates who paid her in South African rands, much needed foreign currency in sanction-hit UDI Rhodesia, and ploughed her wealth into legitimate businesses including the successful restaurant, Copa Cobana, one of the most popular and fashionable meeting places in Rhodesia.

'''Hilton San Francisco Financial District''' is a 27-story hotel located in [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown's]] [[Portsmouth Square]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] at 750 Kearny Street.  Formerly the '''[[Holiday Inn|Holiday Inn Chinatown]]''', the hotel re-opened in January 2006 after a {{US$|55 million}} renovation.

The lobby interior, designed by [[Gensler]], is based on the ancient Chinese aesthetic system of [[Feng Shui]]. Water, fire and earth, three of Feng Shui's five elements, greet visitors as they enter the lobby, beginning with a medallion fountain centered in the hotel foyer. Potted orchids line the lobby perimeter and represent earth. A glass-enclosed fireplace marks the entrance to The Grille at Seven Fifty and completes the Feng Shui circle.

The Hotel is connected to nearby [[Portsmouth Square]] via a pedestrian bridge across [[Kearny Street]]. It is within walking distance of the [[Financial District (San Francisco)|Financial District]], [[North Beach, San Francisco, California|North Beach]] and [[Chinatown, San Francisco, California|Chinatown]]. Onsite attractions and outlets include The Grille at Seven Fifty, Flyte Wine Bar, Tru Spa and the [[Chinese Culture Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/california/hilton-san-francisco-financial-district-SFOFDHF/index.html Hilton website]- information on attractions in area&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=88577&amp;p=irol-newsArticleOther&amp;ID=803450 Hilton Corporation website] investor relations press release about the hotel&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The landmark site of the Hilton San Francisco Financial District dates back to the mid-19th century. The [[Jenny Lind]] Theatre&lt;ref&gt;Built by a New York entrepreneur, Tom Maguire. ''New York Times'', May 9, 1897, 'THE OLD TIME MINSTREL: He Has Gone Out of Vogue, but the Public Recollects Him with Pleasure:"...There, handsome Tom Maguire, a typical New York youth, illiterate but brainy and audacious, had built the Jenny Lind Theatre, and was dubbed the "Napoleon" of managers.  He had a hall and gambling house in Washington Street, San Francisco."&lt;/ref&gt; was the original structure, followed by [[San Francisco City Hall|City Hall]].  In 1900 the San Francisco [[Hall of Justice#San Francisco|Hall of Justice]] was built on this site but it burned in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.  The Hall of Justice was rebuilt and re-opened in 1912.  That building was on the site until it was demolished in 1968.  The hotel was built on the site in 1971.  The hotel was completely renovated the reopened in January 2006 as the Hilton San Francisco Financial District.

The television show [[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]] (1967–75), starring [[Raymond Burr]], featured many exterior shots of the old SF Police headquarters formerly located on the land now occupied by the hotel.  This was supposed to be the site of Ironside's office, the building was actually the old San Francisco [[Hall of Justice#San Francisco|Hall of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/archives/cushman/P09936 image of Old Hall of Justice] the Charles W. Cushman Photograph Collection at the Indiana University Archives / Digital Library Program&lt;/ref&gt;  The old Hall of Justice was demolished in April 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brainyhistory.com/events/1968/april_18_1968_134791.html Brainy History.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The hotel was originally built as the '''Holiday Inn Chinatown''' in 1971.  The new hotel had an unusual rooftop swimming pool {{coord|37|47|42.7|N|122|24|15.7|W|scale:1000}} that is featured in the opening scenes of the first [[Dirty Harry]] film (1971).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mistersf.com/hoc/files/hoc_fwdirtypool001.html Mr. SF website] information about Dirty Harry and pictures of the former rooftop swimming pool (now closed).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6694">'''John 'Jacky' Guard''' (ca. 1791/92 – 1857) was an English convict sent to Australia who was one of the first European settlers in the [[South Island]] of New Zealand, working as a [[whaling|whaler]] and trader.

==Early life==
Guard was born in [[London]] in 1791 or 1792.  On 17 March 1813 at age 21, the stonecutter was convicted of stealing a quilt&lt;ref name=JGAHF&gt;[http://tpo.tepapa.govt.nz/ViewTopicExhibitDetail.asp?TopicFileID=0x000a4d73 "Jack Guard and his Family"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724184105/http://tpo.tepapa.govt.nz/ViewTopicExhibitDetail.asp?TopicFileID=0x000a4d73 |date=2011-07-24 }}, Te Papa&lt;/ref&gt; and sentenced to transportation and five years hard labour.&lt;ref name=JGAHF /&gt; At the end of his sentence, he worked as a [[Seal hunting|sealer]], and after five or six years had his own boat and crew.&lt;ref name=JGAHF /&gt;

==New Zealand==
Guard can lay credit to a number of European firsts in New Zealand's [[South Island]]. His whaling station, established at Te Awaiti&lt;ref name=WisesTeAwaiti&gt;Wises New Zealand Guide, 7th Edition, 1979. p. 427&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Arapaoa Island]]&lt;ref name=WisesArapawa&gt;Wises New Zealand Guide, 7th Edition, 1979. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; shore of [[Tory Channel]] in 1827, was the first permanent settlement in the South Island.&lt;ref name=NZEGuard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/G/GuardJohn/GuardJohn/en |title=New Zealand Encyclopaedia 1966: Guard Biography |publisher=Teara.govt.nz |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (previous whaling stations having been seasonal) Guard's wife Elizabeth or Betty (née Parker, 1814–1870)&lt;ref name=DNZBELizabethGuard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=1G23 |title=Dictionary of New Zealand Biography: Elizabeth Guard |publisher=New Zealand Biography |date= |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom he married in Sydney in 1830,&lt;ref name=NZEGuard/&gt; was the first European woman to settle in the South Island.&lt;ref name=WisesArapawa/&gt;&lt;ref name=NZEGuard/&gt; Guard's son, John junior (born 1 October&lt;ref name=DNZBELizabethGuard/&gt; 1831)&lt;ref name=NZHo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/maori-european-contact-pre-1840/the-harriet-affair |title=New Zealand History online: The Harriet Affair 1834 |publisher=New Zealand History |date=2009-07-21 |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[First white child|first European child]] born in the South Island&lt;ref name=WisesTeAwaiti/&gt;&lt;ref name=WisesArapawa/&gt;&lt;ref name=NZEGuard/&gt; and his daughter Louisa (born late 1833)&lt;ref name=NZHo/&gt; the first female child.&lt;ref name=WisesArapawa/&gt;&lt;ref name=NZEGuard/&gt;

A year after starting the Te Awaiti station, in 1828, he started a branch whaling station at [[Port Underwood]] using the ship Waterloo. He used the ship to transport flax,whale oil and seal skins to Sydney 3 times per year, returning with supplies and trade goods. Later he had to abandon the Te Awaiti station.

In 1834 he was wrecked off the Taranaki coast in the ''Harriet''&lt;ref name=NZHo/&gt; with his wife and family and crew. The survivors were attacked by two different groups of local Maori. The wreck was plundered and 14 crew  killed and two eaten. Betty Guard was tomahawked in the head, only her comb saving her life. Mrs Guard and her daughter were taken by the chief but the young boy of two 1/2, was taken away from his mother and not seen for two months.

Richard Bourke, the governor of New South Wales, dispatched HMS Alligator to Taranaki with a group of 60 British soldiers of the 50th Regiment. They landed a small party on the coast and attempted  negotiations with the Maori captors to recover the eight remaining crew, Guard's wife and two children, John and Louisa, but were chased away. The Alligator was forced out to sea by bad weather. Together with the ship Isabella, it returned to the Taranaki coast and landed a detachment of sailors and marines. An arrangement was made to ransom the prisoners. The captain suspected the prisoner were being held at Te Namu Pa and landed a party there. They made contact with Maori. Guard grabbed  the chief and took him back to the Alligator where he was beaten up. His wounds were then treated by the surgeon. The next day large numbers of Maori gathered on the beach but negotiations stalled until the Maori chief, Oaoiti, was brought ashore. He made a speech to the Maori captors and immediately  Mrs Guard and her baby daughter were taken to the Alligator by waka but the boy was still held prisoner. While negotiations continued for his release  a shot from the Pa was fired, narrowly missing a sailor. The captain ordered a bombardment of the pa that lasted 3 hours during which the Maori hostage takers raised and then lowered a white flag several times. Near the end of the bombardment a Maori held up the captive boy to indicate he had not been killed. The Alligator's surgeon landed with 100 men. The boy was handed over and the soldiers then opened fire on the Maori gathered on the beach. The Maori fled and the pa was burnt down. The surgeon was horrified at the troop's action.  This was the first clash between Māori and British troops. The rescue expedition sent by [[Richard Bourke|Governor Bourke]] from Sydney was subsequently criticised by a British House of Commons report in 1835. Bourke used the kidnappings, murders and cannibalism to argue for a British warship to be permanently stationed in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;The Voyagers. p 42-50. Paul Moon. Penguin 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taranaki Story :The Harriet Incident. Puke Ariki&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Harriet Affair- a Frontier of Chaos?- NZ History Net.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guard settled permanently at [[Port Underwood]] in 1836, and was still whaling off the [[Kaikoura]] coast in the 1840s. About this time onshore whaling ceased to be economically viable in New Zealand. His later life is unknown,&lt;ref name=NZEGuard/&gt; but he probably farmed at Kakapo Bay. Guard died in 1857.&lt;ref name=JGAHF /&gt;

'''Josiah Franklin Sr.''' (December 23, 1657 – January 16, 1745) was an [[English people|English]] businessman and the father of [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Born in the village of [[Ecton, Northamptonshire|Ecton]], [[Northamptonshire]], [[England]], Josiah was the ninth child of blacksmith Thomas Franklin (b. 1598), and his first wife, Jane White. Thomas was the son of Henry Franckline (b. 1573) and Agnes Joanes. Thomas Franklin remarried and had more children. Josiah Franklin was an industrious young man who worked as a [[Dyeing|fabric dyer]] in Ecton. In [[Boston]], he was a member of the [[Congregational church|Congregational]] [[Old South Church]] where he served as a [[tithing]]man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/tithing Dictionary definition of "Tithing"] and [http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/Ti/Tithingman.html Dictionary definition of "Tithingman".] Webster's Online Dictionary. Retrieved June 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
Franklin immigrated to the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] in 1682. He married twice and had 17 children - ten boys and seven girls.

==Marriage to Anne Child==
Josiah Franklin married his first wife, Anne Child, in 1677 and they had seven children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/biography/app01.htm| title=Life of Benjamin Franklin: APPENDIX No. I |last=Sparks |first=Jared |date=1999 |website=UShistory.org |access-date=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;: Elizabeth, Samuel, Hannah. Josiah Jr., Joseph (1688-1688), Joseph II (1689-1689), and Ann&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/67815297&lt;/ref&gt;. Upon moving to [[Boston]], he took up the trade of [[tallow]] [[Chandlery|chandler]] and soap boiler because the trade he was born to was not in demand in [[New England]].

==Marriage to Abiah Folger==
In November 1689, Josiah Franklin married his second wife, Abiah Folger, in the Old South Church. Abiah of [[Nantucket]], Massachusetts, was the daughter of [[Peter Foulger|Peter]] and [[Mary Morril|Mary ''Morrill'' Foulger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Benjamin Franklin|last=Huang|first=Nian-sheng|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781444342154|editor-last=Waldstreicher|editor-first=David|pages=5–24|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781444342154.ch1|chapter = Franklin's Boston Years, 1706-1723}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Foulger was a schoolmaster, a miller and a surveyor.

Abiah bore Josiah 10 children: John (1690), Peter (1692), Mary (1694), [[James Franklin (printer)|James]] (1697), Sarah (1699), Ebenezer (1701), Thomas (1703), [[Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin]] (1706), Lydia (1708), and [[Jane Mecom|Jane]] (1712).

==Benjamin Franklin==
Josiah insisted that each of his sons must learn a trade. He had great dreams of Benjamin becoming a minister,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/info/index.htm Franklin], US History&lt;/ref&gt; but Josiah could only afford to send his son to school for two years. As his young Benjamin loved to read, Josiah apprenticed him to his brother James, who was a printer. Later, Benjamin Franklin borrowed books from his friends and taught himself [[arithmetic]], [[grammar]], and [[philosophy]]. Benjamin, whose full name was Benjamin Josiah Franklin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/info/index.htm Franklin], US History&lt;/ref&gt; had a very strong relationship with his father, who had a great influence on Benjamin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/info/index.htm Franklin], US History&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karl Wilhelm Söderman''' (7 May 1863 — 21 October 1911) was a Finnish [[engineer]], [[businessman]] and [[vuorineuvos]].

Before his studies Söderman worked for Helsinki Gas Works, where he got a staunch practical experience of shop floor work. After graduating in [[Helsinki University of Technology|Polytechnic Institute]] as 22-year-old engineer in 1886 he started working for John Stenberg's Engineering Works. The owner died in the same year after which Söderman managed and developed the company during 1887–1892.

In 1892 Söderman started as manager of [[Kone ja Silta]], which during his leadership grew the largest engineering company of Finland.

Söderman was twice member of [[City Council of Helsinki|Helsinki City Council]] and founding member of Finnish General Employers' Organisation.

He died to an unknown disease during health travel in [[Meran]], [[South Tyrol]].

== Early life and studies ==
Söderman was born in [[Oulu]], [[Oulu Province|Northern Ostrobothnia]]. His parents were [[sawmill]] operator Karl Söderman, whose roots were in [[Kronoby]], and Margaretha [[née]] Lybeck. Soon after his birth the family moved to [[Pori]]&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman II"/&gt; and onward to Kaunissaari&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt; in [[Porvoo]],&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman II"/&gt; where the father became property manager of [[August Eklöf]]'s [[Steam engine|steam]] sawmill. Already at a young age Söderman became familiar with [[timber industry]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt; Söderman had his [[primary education]] in Porvoo.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman II"/&gt; After the primary school Söderman started working in Helsinki Gas Works' engineering shop;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman II"/&gt; he became familiar with engineering workshop operations including model [[carpenter]], [[plumber]] and [[coppersmith]] work. At the same time there worked many innovative engineers, such as [[Edvin Bergroth]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt;

Söderman managed to get into [[Helsinki University of Technology|Polytechnic Institute]] in 1882.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman II"/&gt; He funded his studies by doing drawing work and giving [[private lesson]]s,&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt; and participated in [[Student society|student organisational]] activities. Söderman graduated [[engineer]] in 1886.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman II"/&gt;

== Career ==
=== John Stenberg's Engineering Works ===
After graduating, Söderman started working for John Stenberg's Engineering Works.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman II"/&gt; The founder John Didrik Stenberg passed away in the same year. The [[widow]] Pauline Stenberg offered the company to Edvin Bergroth, who refused, as he had recently started as technical manager in [[Nobel Brothers]] in [[Baku]]. 22-year-old Söderman, without experience about company management,&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt; rented the engineering works for 1887–1888 and continued managing it until 1892.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman II"/&gt; During his leadership the company made 12,000–15,000 marks' annual profit and product quality was improved substantially.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt;

In 1888 Söderman married daughter of John Stenberg, 19-year-old Ellen Stenberg.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman II"/&gt;

=== Kone- ja Siltarakennus ===
Söderman's capability was noted by Gunnar Lindqvist, manager of Brobyggnads Ab, who invited him in December 1891 to lead a new company [[Kone- ja Siltarakennus|Maskin- och Brobyggnads Ab]] ({{lang-fi|Kone- ja Siltarakennus Oy}}, "Machine and Bridge Construction Limited"; shortened as Kone ja Silta), which was created in result of merger between Osbergska Verkstad and Brobyggnads Ab. The main products were [[railway bridge]]s and [[steam boiler]]s. Although the beginning was difficult, few months after the company started increasingly receiving orders from [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. In 1894 orders to Russia reached 1.1 million marks, which formed 80% of the total sales; in the following year the Russian orders were already 1.6 million marks, which made Kone ja Silta the biggest Engineering company of Finland in terms of [[gross value added]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt;

Dependency on the Russian market created problems when political tensions between the Russian Empire and Grand Duchy of Finland culminated in 1902: a political committee in Russia suggested that Finland shall be treated as foreign country in [[tariff]] policy which would mean high toll fees for Finnish products. Finnish engineering companies became concerned and wrote a common letter which Karl Söderman and [[John Eager (engineer)|John Eager]], manager of [[Wm. Crichton &amp; Co.|W:m Crichton &amp; C:o]] delivered together to [[Vladimir Kovalevsky]] in [[Ministry of Finance of the Russian Empire|Ministry of Finance]]. Although the meeting was not successful, the Russian government cancelled the plans of extra tariffs at the end of the year.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman II"/&gt;

The average annual [[Gross value added|GVA]] was under one million marks in period 1892–1894, but in period 1904–1908 it was quadrupled. The top year was in 1905, when the company benefited from increased orders due to the [[Russo-Japanese War]]; the GVA reached 6.2 million marks.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt;

=== Political and organisational activities ===
Söderman was member of [[City Council of Helsinki|Helsinki City Council]] during 1896–1901 and 1904–1906.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman II"/&gt;

As Söderman had worked on shop floor himself, he had good communication and understanding with the company workers.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman II"/&gt; He founded a common [[pension fund]] for Kone ja Silta blue and white collar workers and strove for creating a national accident and health insurance system. In 1899 he attended in a committee that investigated possibilities to start [[vocational school]] for metal workers.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman II"/&gt;

[[Strike action|Striking]] became increasingly common at the beginning of the 20th century. Unrest experienced in 1902 in particular prompted the employers to create a counter-force to [[trade union]]s. This was initiated by [[Adolf Engström]], manager of Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering works. The organisation was founded in 1903 and Söderman became the first chairman of the new Confederation of Metal Industrialists. At the beginning many employers were not interested to unionise and the new union was too weak. The situation changed after the [[Revolution_of_1905#Finland|general strike of 1905]];&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt; the Finnish General Employers' Organisation was founded in 1906 and Söderman was its board member until his death. According to contemporary documents of the organisation, Söderman had a major role at its establishment.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman II"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Söderman had two children with Ellen née Stenberg (1868–1923): son Karl Helmer was born in 1889 and became later engineer, and daughter Saga Margareta was born in 1897.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman II"/&gt;

Söderman's favourite hobby was [[yachting]]. He was [[vice commodore]] of [[Nyländska Jaktklubben]]&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman II"/&gt; and he won several [[Sailing (sport)|sail racing]] prizes in Finland and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt;

For many years Söderman suffered of an unknown disease. He travelled to [[Meran]], [[South Tyrol]] for [[Health tourism|health holiday]] in 1911 but deceased during the trip.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Karl Söderman II"/&gt;

'''Lee Byung-chul''' (12 February 1910 &amp;ndash; 19 November 1987) was the founder of the [[Samsung|Samsung Group]] and one of South Korea's most successful [[Businessperson|businessmen]]. With the breakup of the [[Hyundai]] [[chaebol]], Samsung is now South Korea's largest business group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreaittimes.com/story/7223/hail-father-business-lee-byung-chul|title=Hail the Father of Business, Lee Byung-chul|last=Jung-hyun|first=Bang|date=11 February 2010|website=Korea IT Times|access-date=5 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515094230/http://www.koreaittimes.com/story/7223/hail-father-business-lee-byung-chul|archivedate=15 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Byung-chul was the son of a wealthy landowning family (a branch of the [[Lee (Korean name)#Gyeongju clan|Gyeongju Lee]] clan). He attended college at [[Waseda University]] in [[Tokyo]] but did not complete his degree.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt;

==Career==

=== Beginning ===
Byung-chul established a trucking business in [[Daegu]] on 1 March 1938, which he named Samsung Trading Co, the forerunner to Samsung.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woo|first1=Jaeyeon|title=Memorializing the Company Founder, With Ads, 3-D and Holograms|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2011/07/22/memorializing-the-company-founder-with-ads-3-d-and-holograms/|website=WSJ|language=English|date=22 July 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084636/http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2011/07/22/memorializing-the-company-founder-with-ads-3-d-and-holograms/|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samsung means "Three Stars" which explains the initial corporate logos.

By 1945 Samsung was transporting goods throughout Korea and to other countries. The company was based in Seoul by 1947. It was one of the ten largest "trading companies" when the [[Korean War]] started in 1950.&lt;ref name="watkins"&gt;Watkins, Thaer, "The Chaebol of South Korea", Website, downloaded July 22, 2011, [http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/chaebol.htm#SAMSUNG] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827070846/http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/chaebol.htm|date=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the conquest of Seoul by the North Korean army, Lee was forced to relocate his business to [[Busan]]. The massive influx of U.S. troops and equipment into Busan over the next year and a half of the war proved to be highly beneficial to Lee's trucking company.&lt;ref name="watkins" /&gt;

[[File:Lee Byung-chul.jpg|thumb|right|Lee in 1950]]

In 1961 when [[Park Chung-hee|General Park]] seized [[May Coup (South Korea)|power]], Lee was in Japan and for some time he did not return to South Korea. Eventually, a deal was struck and Lee returned but Samsung had to give up control over the banks it acquired and follow economic directives from Park's government.&lt;ref name="watkins" /&gt;

=== Federation of Korean Industries ===
The first step of the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) was established in August 1961. The association was founded by Samsung Group Chairman Lee Byung-chul. He was a noble leader to every employee that walked through the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=2837041&amp;cid=50867&amp;categoryId=50867|title=the Federation of Korean Industries by Naver|last=|first=|date=|website=Naver|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in life, Byung-chul served as chairman of the Federation of Korean Industries and was known as the richest man in Korea.&lt;ref name="KTimes2"&gt;"Samsung's development in chronological order"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Korean art collection ==
After his death, Byung-chul's estate (Ho-Am) was opened to the public for tours. His collection of [[Korean art]] is considered one of the largest private collections in the country and it features a number of art objects that have been designated "National Treasures" by the Korean government.&lt;ref name="Everland"&gt;[http://hoam.samsungfoundation.org/eng/info/main.html Ho Am Art Museum, "Official Web Site"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821021933/http://hoam.samsungfoundation.org/eng/info/main.html |date=2011-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ho-Am is located a short distance from the [[Everland]] park, South Korea's most popular amusement park (Everland is also owned by the Samsung Group).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35068">This is a '''list of [[Technopole|technology centers]]''' throughout the world.  Governmental planners and business networks like to use the name "silicon" or "valley" to describe their own areas as a result of the success of [[Silicon Valley]] in [[California]].  Nevertheless, there are a few qualitative differences between these places, and metrics may be applied to measure their dominance.

These metrics include:
* How much and to what extent public and/or private research and development funds are spent in the zones
* What percentage of local employment is technology related.
* If the zone is mainly government funded or is mainly corporate driven (or both)
* If mainly corporate, how much revenue and profit and which corporates have headquarters there.
* If mainly corporate, how much [[venture capital]] has been made available to companies in the zone.
* What supporting higher educational institutions are located in nearby.

== Globally Prominent clusters (with specific dominant markets listed) ==
&lt;!-- Note: this area should be a summary of major globally dominant in a particular field.  If there isnt a particular market to point out, it does not belong in this section, but the worldiwde list section below--&gt;
 {{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
*[[Silicon Valley]] - originating in Stanford University (Palo Alto and Menlo Park), and spreading south towards [[San Jose, California]] and suburbs. San Francisco and nearby areas including Berkeley and Oakland are technically not part of Silicon Valley but have seen growth in industries such as [[web development]] (2013-2016) and [[venture capital]].  Silicon Valley has maintained dominance for decades in core industries such as microprocessor development as well as software and web development.  
*[[Silicon Wadi]] - is an area with a high concentration of [[high-tech]] industries&lt;ref name="Viva Tel Aviv"/&gt; in the [[Israeli Coastal Plain|coastal plain]] in [[Israel]]. [[Israel]] as a whole country has strong innovation in Cyber Security, Agritech and more. The Silicon Wadi area covers much of the country, although especially high concentrations of hi-tech industry can be found in the area around [[Tel Aviv]], including small clusters around the cities of [[Ra'anana]], [[Petah Tikva]], [[Herzliya]], [[Netanya]], the academic city of [[Rehovot]] and its neighbour [[Rishon Le Zion]]. In addition, hi-tech clusters can be found in [[Haifa]] and [[Caesarea, Israel|Caesarea]].

Many of these businesses have connections with the University of Cambridge, and the area is now one of the most important technology centres in Europe.
*[[Shenzhen Hi-Tech Industrial Park]] - [[Shenzhen, Guangdong]], China Shenzhen municipality and surrounds, including [[Dongguan]]'s factories had been for a decade the world's dominant peripheral hardware suppliers.  More recently Shenzhen has become the dominant place worldwide for hardware startups (excluding microprocessors, chip memory, and [[pure-play semiconductor foundry]]).
*[[Suwon]], [[Korea]] or ''Samsung Digital City'' is the dominant place worldwide for [[Semiconductor memory|chip memory]] and integrated [[system on a chip]] with large components of microchip memory.

{{Business management}}

'''Management''' (or '''managing''') is the administration of an [[organization]], whether it is a [[business]], a not-for-profit organization, or government body. Management includes the activities of setting the [[Strategic management|strategy]] of an [[organization]] and coordinating the efforts of its [[employee]]s (or of volunteers) to accomplish its [[goal|objectives]] through the application of available [[Resource (economics)|resources]], such as [[financial]], [[natural resources|natural]], [[technological]], and [[human resources]].&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/0961463X17752652|title = Iterative lagged asymmetric responses in strategic management and long-range planning| journal=Time &amp; Society| pages=|year = 2018|last1 = Simandan|first1 = Dragos}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "management" may also refer to those people who manage an organization.

[[Social science|Social scientists]] study management as an [[academic discipline]], investigating areas such as [[social organization]] and [[organizational leadership]].&lt;ref&gt;Waring, S.P., 2016. Taylorism transformed: Scientific management theory since 1945. UNC Press Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Some people study management at colleges or universities; major degrees in management include the [[Bachelor of Commerce]] (B.Com.) and [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA.) and, for the public sector, the [[Master of Public Administration]] (MPA) degree. Individuals who aim to become management specialists or experts, management researchers, or professors may complete the [[Doctor of Management]] (DM), the [[Doctor of Business Administration]] (DBA), or the [[Ph.D|PhD]] in Business Administration or Management.

Larger organizations generally have three levels of managers, which are typically organized{{by whom|date=August 2017}} in a [[hierarchy|hierarchical]], pyramid structure:

* [[Senior management|Senior manager]]s, such as members of a [[Board of Directors]] and a [[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO) or a [[President (corporate title)|President]] of an organization. They set the strategic goals of the organization and make decisions on how the overall organization will operate. Senior managers are generally executive-level professionals, and provide direction to middle management who directly or indirectly report to them.
* [[Middle management|Middle manager]]s, examples of which would include branch managers, regional managers, department managers and section managers, provide direction to front-line managers. Middle managers communicate the strategic goals of senior management to the front-line managers.
* [[Line management|Lower manager]]s, such as [[supervisor]]s and front-line [[team leader]]s, oversee the work of regular employees (or volunteers, in some voluntary organizations) and provide direction on their work.

In smaller organizations, an individual manager may have a much wider scope. A single manager may perform several roles or even all of the roles commonly observed in a large organization.

==Definitions==

Views on the definition and scope of management include:
* According to [[Henri Fayol]], "to manage is to forecast and to plan, to organise, to command, to co-ordinate and to control."&lt;ref name="Gulshan"&gt;{{cite book|author=SS Gulshan|title=Management Principles and Practices by Lallan Prasad and SS Gulshan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ky4em-N02tAC&amp;pg=PA6|publisher=Excel Books India|isbn=978-93-5062-099-1|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fredmund Malik]] defines it as "the transformation of resources into utility."
* Management included as one of the factors of production – along with machines, materials and money.
* [[Ghislain Deslandes]] defines it as “a vulnerable force, under pressure to achieve results and endowed with the triple power of constraint, imitation and imagination, operating on subjective, interpersonal, institutional and environmental levels”.&lt;ref&gt;Deslandes G., (2014), “Management in Xenophon's Philosophy : a Retrospective Analysis”, 38th Annual Research Conference, Philosophy of Management, 2014, July 14–16, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Peter Drucker]] (1909–2005) saw the basic task of management as twofold: [[marketing]] and [[innovation]]. Nevertheless, innovation is also linked to marketing (product innovation is a central strategic marketing issue). Peter Drucker identifies marketing as a key essence for business success, but management and marketing are generally understood{{by whom|date=June 2013}} as two different branches of business administration knowledge.

===Theoretical scope===
Management involves identifying the [[mission statement|mission]], objective, procedures, rules and manipulation&lt;ref&gt;
Prabbal Frank attempts to make a subtle distinction between management and manipulation: {{cite book

In short, manipulation is skilful management. [...] Manipulation is in essence leveraged management. [...] It is an alive thing while management is a dead concept. It requires a proactive approach rather than a reactive approach. [...] People cannot be managed.

of the [[human capital]] of an [[business|enterprise]] to contribute to the success of the enterprise.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} This implies effective communication: an enterprise environment (as opposed to a physical or mechanical mechanism) implies human motivation and implies some sort of successful progress or system outcome.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} As such, management is not the manipulation of a mechanism (machine or automated program), not the herding of animals, and can occur either in a legal or in an illegal enterprise or environment. From an individual's perspective, management does not need to be seen solely from an enterprise point of view, because management is an essential function to improve one's [[personal life|life]] and [[Social relationship|relationships]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}  Management is therefore everywhere{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} and it has a wider range of application.{{clarify|date=August 2015}} Based on this, management must have humans. Communication and a positive endeavor are two main aspects of it either through enterprise or independent pursuit.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Plans, measurements, motivational psychological tools, goals, and economic measures (profit, etc.) may or may not be necessary components for there to be management. At first, one views management functionally, such as measuring quantity, adjusting [[plan]]s, meeting [[goal]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} This applies even in situations where planning does not take place. From this perspective, [[Henri Fayol]] (1841–1925)&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2015}}
considers management to consist of six [[function (engineering)|functions]]:

# forecasting
# planning
# organizing
# commanding
# coordinating
# controlling

In another way of thinking, [[Mary Parker Follett]] (1868–1933), allegedly defined management as "the art of getting things done through people".&lt;ref&gt;

suggesting the difficulty of defining management without [[circular definition|circularity]], the shifting nature of definitions{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} and the connection of [[Managerialism|managerial practices]] with the existence of a [[managerial class|managerial cadre]] or of a [[social class|class]].

One habit of thought regards management as equivalent to "[[business administration]]" and thus excludes management in places outside [[commerce]], as for example in [[Charitable organization|charities]] and in the [[public sector]]. More broadly, every organization must "manage" its work, people, processes, technology, etc. to maximize effectiveness.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Nonetheless, many people refer to university departments that teach management as "[[business school]]s". Some such institutions (such as the [[Harvard Business School]]) use that name, while others (such as the [[Yale School of Management]]) employ the broader term "management".

English-speakers may also use the term "management" or "the management" as a collective word describing the managers of an organization, for example of a [[corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;

But in the present era{{when|date=August 2015}} the concept of management is identified{{by whom|date=September 2015}} in the wide areas{{which|date=August 2015}} and its frontiers have been pushed to a broader range.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Apart from profitable organizations even non-profitable organizations ([[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]]) apply management concepts. The concept and its uses are not constrained{{by whom|date=August 2015}}. Management on the whole is the process of planning, organizing, coordinating, [[leadership|leading]] and controlling.

==Nature of work==
In profitable organizations, management's primary function is the satisfaction of a range of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. This typically involves making a profit (for the shareholders), creating valued products at a reasonable cost (for customers), and providing great employment opportunities for employees. In nonprofit management, add the importance of keeping the faith of donors. In most models of management and [[governance]], shareholders vote for the [[board of directors]], and the board then hires senior management. Some organizations have experimented with other methods (such as employee-voting models) of selecting or reviewing managers, but this is rare.

== History ==
Some see management as a late-modern (in the sense of late [[modernity]]) conceptualization.&lt;ref&gt;Waring, S.P., 2016, Taylorism transformed: Scientific management theory since 1945. UNC Press Books.&lt;/ref&gt; On those terms it cannot have a pre-modern history - only harbingers (such as [[Steward (office)|stewards]]). Others, however, detect management-like thought among ancient [[Sumer]]ian traders and the builders of the pyramids of [[ancient Egypt]]. Slave-owners through the centuries faced the problems of exploiting/motivating a dependent but sometimes unenthusiastic or recalcitrant workforce, but many pre-industrial [[business|enterprises]], given their small scale, did not feel compelled to face the issues of management systematically. However, [[innovation]]s such as the spread of [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system|Hindu numerals]] (5th to 15th centuries) and the codification of [[Double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry book-keeping]] (1494) provided [[management tool|tools]] for management assessment, planning and control.

[[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]  wrote about how to make organisations efficient and effective. The principles that Machiavelli set forth in ''Discourses'' (1531) can apply in adapted form to the management of organisations today:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Management (sixth edition)|last=Stoner|first=James A.F.|publisher=Prentice Hall, Inc.|year=1995|isbn=978-0-13-149444-2|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|page=30|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An organisation is more stable if members have the right to express their differences and solve their conflicts within  it.
* While one person can begin an organisation, "it is lasting when it is left in the care of many and when many desire to maintain it".
* A weak manager can follow a strong one, but not another weak one, and maintain authority.
* A manager seeking to change an established organization "should retain at least a shadow of the ancient customs".

With the changing workplaces of [[industrial revolution]]s in the 18th and 19th centuries, [[military]] theory and practice contributed approaches to managing the newly-popular [[factory|factories]].&lt;ref&gt;

Given the scale of most commercial operations and the lack of mechanized record-keeping and recording before the industrial revolution, it made sense for most [[ownership|owners]] of enterprises in those times to carry out management functions by and for themselves. But with growing size and complexity of organizations, a distinction between owners (individuals, industrial dynasties or groups of [[shareholder]]s) and day-to-day managers (independent specialists in planning and control) gradually became more common.

=== Etymology ===
The English verb "manage" comes from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''maneggiare'' (to handle, especially tools or a horse), which derives from the two [[Latin]] words ''manus'' (hand) and ''agere'' (to act). The French word for housekeeping, ''ménagerie'', derived from ''ménager'' ("to keep house"; compare ''ménage'' for "household"), also encompasses taking care of domestic animals. [[wikt:menagerie|''Ménagerie'']] is the French translation of [[Xenophon]]'s famous book ''[[Oeconomicus]]''&lt;ref&gt;
https://books.google.com/books?id=ITdXAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP21&amp;lpg=PP21&amp;dq=menagerie+xenophon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-xFcf4MOIt&amp;sig=KGryxF60feNGaDW9AlgIZJIb0gU&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5V4_VfiLKZDfau-OgZgO&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=menagerie%20xenophon&amp;f=false
&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-grc-gre|Οἰκονομικός}}) on household matters and [[husbandry]]. The French word ''mesnagement'' (or ''ménagement'') influenced the semantic development of the English word ''management'' in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/113218?redirectedFrom=management#eid|title= Home : Oxford English Dictionary|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, Chinese general [[Sun Tzu]] in his 6th-century BC work ''[[The Art of War]]'' recommends{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} (when re-phrased in modern terminology) being aware of and acting on strengths and weaknesses of both a manager's organization and a foe's.&lt;ref name="management_gomez-mejia_p19" /&gt;{{qn|date=July 2018}} The writings of influential [[Chinese Legalist]] philosopher [[Shen Buhai]] may be considered{{by whom|date=August 2017}} to embody a rare premodern example of abstract theory of administration.&lt;ref&gt;Creel, 1974 pp. 4–5 Shen Pu-hai: A Chinese Political Philosopher of the Fourth Century B.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various ancient and medieval civilizations produced "[[mirrors for princes]]" books, which aimed to advise new monarchs on how to govern. [[Plato]] described job specialization in 350 BC, and [[Alfarabi]] listed several leadership traits in AD 900.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Ricky W. CUSTOM Management: Principles and Practices, International Edition, 11th Edition. Cengage Learning UK, 08/2014&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include the Indian ''[[Arthashastra]]'' by [[Chanakya]] (written around 300 BC), and ''[[The Prince]]'' by Italian author

Smith described how changes in processes could boost productivity in the manufacture of [[pin (device)|pins]]. While individuals could produce 200 pins per day, Smith analyzed the steps involved in manufacture and, with 10 specialists, enabled production of 48,000 pins per day.&lt;ref name="management_gomez-mejia_p20" /&gt;{{qn|date=August 2017}}

===19th century===
Classical economists such as [[Adam Smith]] (1723–1790) and [[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873) provided a theoretical background to [[resource allocation|resource-allocation]], [[production, costs, and pricing|production]], and [[pricing]] issues. About the same time, innovators like [[Eli Whitney]] (1765–1825), [[James Watt]] (1736–1819), and [[Matthew Boulton]] (1728–1809) developed elements of technical production such as [[standardization]], [[quality control|quality-control]] procedures, [[cost accounting|cost-accounting]], interchangeability of parts, and [[plan|work-planning]]. Many of these aspects of management existed in the pre-1861 slave-based sector of the US economy. That environment saw 4 million people, as the contemporary usages had it, "managed" in profitable quasi-[[mass production]].

Salaried managers as an identifiable group first became prominent in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
By about 1900 one finds managers trying to place their theories on what they regarded as a thoroughly scientific basis (see [[scientism]] for perceived limitations of this belief). Examples include [[Henry R. Towne]]'s ''Science of management'' in the 1890s, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]'s ''[[The Principles of Scientific Management]]'' (1911), [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|Lillian Gilbreth]]'s ''Psychology of Management'' (1914),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://archive.org/details/thepsychologyofm16256gut|title= The Psychology of Management: The Function of the Mind in Determining, Teaching and Installing Methods of Least Waste|first= Lillian Moller|last= Gilbreth|publisher= |via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth|Frank]] and [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|Lillian Gilbreth]]'s ''Applied motion study'' (1917), and [[Henry L. Gantt]]'s charts (1910s). J. Duncan wrote the first [[college]] management-[[textbook]] in 1911. In 1912 [[Yoichi Ueno]] introduced [[Taylorism]] to [[Japan]] and became the first [[management consultant]] of the "Japanese-management style". His son Ichiro Ueno pioneered Japanese [[quality assurance]].

The first comprehensive theories of management appeared around 1920.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The [[Harvard Business School]] offered the first [[Master of Business Administration]] degree (MBA) in 1921. People like [[Henri Fayol]] (1841–1925) and [[Alexander Hamilton Church|Alexander Church]] (1866-1936) described the various branches of management and their inter-relationships. In the early-20th century, people like Ordway Tead (1891–1973), [[Walter Dill Scott|Walter Scott]] (1869-1955) and J. Mooney applied the principles of [[psychology]] to management. Other writers, such as [[Elton Mayo]] (1880–1949), [[Mary Follett|Mary Parker Follett]] (1868–1933), [[Chester Barnard]] (1886–1961), [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920), who saw what he called the "administrator" as [[bureaucrat]],&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rensis Likert]] (1903–1981), and [[Chris Argyris]] (born 1923) approached the phenomenon of management from a [[sociology|sociological]] perspective.

[[Peter Drucker]] (1909–2005) wrote one of the earliest books on applied management: ''[[Concept of the Corporation]]'' (published in 1946). It resulted from [[Alfred Sloan]] (chairman of [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] until 1956) commissioning a study of the [[organisation]]. Drucker went on to write 39 books, many in the same vein.

H. Dodge, [[Ronald Fisher]] (1890–1962), and Thornton C. Fry introduced statistical techniques into management-studies. In the 1940s, [[Patrick Maynard Stuart Blackett|Patrick Blackett]] worked in the development of the [[applied mathematics|applied-mathematics]] [[science]] of [[operations research]], initially for military operations. Operations research, sometimes known as "management science" (but distinct from Taylor's [[scientific management]]), attempts to take a [[science|scientific]] approach to solving decision-problems, and can apply directly to multiple management problems, particularly in the areas of [[logistics]] and operations.

Some of the more {{as of|2006|alt= recent}} developments include the [[Theory of Constraints]], [[management by objectives]], [[business process reengineering|reengineering]], [[Six Sigma]], the [[Viable system model]], and various [[information technology|information-technology]]-driven theories such as [[agile software development]], as well as group-management theories such as [[Cog's Ladder]].

As the general recognition of managers as a class solidified during the 20th century and gave perceived practitioners of the art/science of management a certain amount of prestige, so the way opened for [[business philosophies and popular management theories|popularised systems of management ideas]] to peddle their wares. In this context many [[management fad]]s may have had more to do with [[pop psychology]] than with scientific theories of management.

Towards the end of the 20th century, business management came to consist of six separate branches,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} namely:

# [[Finance|financial management]]
# [[human resource management]]
# [[information technology management]] (responsible for [[management information systems]])
# [[marketing management]]
# [[operations management]] and [[Manufacturing|production]] management
# [[strategic management]]

===21st century===
In the 21st century observers find it increasingly difficult to subdivide management into functional categories in this way. More and more processes simultaneously involve several categories. Instead, one tends to think in terms of the various processes, tasks, and objects subject to management.{{citation needed|date= August 2013}}

Branches of management theory also exist relating to [[Non-profit organization|nonprofits]] and to government: such as [[public administration]], [[public management]], and educational management. Further, management programs related to [[civil society|civil-society]] organizations have also spawned programs in [[nonprofit]] management and [[social entrepreneurship]].

Note that many of the assumptions made by management have come under attack from [[business ethics|business-ethics]] viewpoints, [[critical management studies]], and [[anti-corporate activism]].

As one consequence, [[workplace democracy]] (sometimes referred to as [[Workers' self-management]]) has become both more common and more advocated, in some places distributing all management functions among workers, each of whom takes on a portion of the work. However, these models predate any current political issue, and may occur more naturally than does a [[command hierarchy]]. All management embraces to some degree a democratic principle—in that in the long term, the majority of workers must support management. Otherwise, they leave to find other work or go on strike. Despite the move toward workplace democracy, command-and-control organization structures remain commonplace as ''de facto'' organization structures. Indeed, the entrenched nature of command-and-control is evident in the way that recent{{when|date=July 2018}} layoffs have been conducted with management ranks affected far less than employees at the lower levels.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} In some cases, management has even rewarded itself with bonuses after laying off lower-level workers.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, S.

==Topics==

===Basics===
According to [[Henri Fayol|Fayol]], management operates through five basic functions: planning, organizing, coordinating, commanding, and controlling.
* '''Planning''': Deciding what needs to happen in the future and generating plans for action (deciding in advance).&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt;
* '''Organizing''' (or staffing): Making sure the human and nonhuman resources are put into place.&lt;ref name="Peaucelle2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean-Louis Peaucelle|title=Henri Fayol, the Manager|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLg6CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55|date=22 July 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-31939-9|pages=55–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Coordinating''': Creating a structure through which an organization's goals can be accomplished.
* '''Commanding''' (or leading): Determining what must be done in a situation and getting people to do it.
* '''Controlling''': Checking progress against plans.

===Basic roles===
* '''Interpersonal''': roles that involve coordination and interaction with employees
Figurehead, leader
* '''Informational''': roles that involve handling, sharing, and analyzing information
Nerve centre, disseminator
* '''Decision''': roles that require decision-making 
Entrepreneur, negotiator, allocator

=== Skills ===
Management skills include:
* political: used to build a [[power base]] and to establish [[personal network|connections]]
* conceptual: used to analyze complex situations
* [[interpersonal]]: used to communicate, [[motivate]], mentor and [[delegate]]
* diagnostic: ability to [[mental image|visualize]] appropriate responses to a situation
* [[leadership]]: ability to lead and to provide guidance to a specific group
* technical: [[expertise]] in one's particular functional area.
* Behavioral:Perception towards others.

===Implementation of policies and strategies===
* All policies and strategies must be discussed with all managerial personnel and staff.
* Managers must understand where and how they can implement their policies and strategies.
* A plan of action must be devised for each department.
* Policies and strategies must be reviewed regularly.
* Contingency plans must be devised in case the environment changes.
* Top-level managers should carry out regular progress assessments.
* The business requires team spirit and a good environment.
* The missions, objectives, strengths and weaknesses of each department must be analyzed to determine their roles in achieving the business's mission.
* The forecasting method develops a reliable picture of the business' future environment.
* A planning unit must be created to ensure that all plans are consistent and that policies and strategies are aimed at achieving the same mission and objectives.

==Policies and strategies in the planning process==
* They give mid and lower-level managers a good idea of the future plans for each department in an organization.
* A framework is created whereby plans and decisions are made.
* Mid and lower-level management may add their own plans to the business's strategies.

==Levels==
Most organizations have three management levels: first-level, middle-level, and top-level managers. First-line managers are the lowest level of management and manage the work of nonmanagerial individuals who are directly involved with the production or creation of the organization's products. First-line managers are often called supervisors, but may also be called line managers, office managers, or even foremen. Middle managers include all levels of management between the first-line level and the top level of the organization. These managers manage the work of first-line managers and may have titles such as department head, project leader, plant manager, or division manager. Top managers are responsible for making organization-wide decisions and establishing the plans and goals that affect the entire organization. These individuals typically have titles such as executive vice president, president, managing director, chief operating officer, chief executive officer, or chairman of the board.

These managers are classified in a hierarchy of authority, and perform different tasks. In many organizations, the number of managers in every level resembles a pyramid.  Each level is explained below in specifications of their different responsibilities and likely job titles.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Top===
The top or senior layer of management consists of the [[board of directors]] (including [[non-executive director]]s and [[executive director]]s), president, vice-president, [[CEO]]s and other members of the [[Corporate title|C-level]] executives. Different organizations have various members in their C-suite, which may include a [[Chief Financial Officer]], [[Chief Technology Officer]], and so on. They are responsible for controlling and overseeing the operations of the entire organization. They set a "[[tone at the top]]" and develop [[strategic planning|strategic plans]], company policies, and make decisions on the overall direction of the organization. In addition, top-level managers play a significant role in the mobilization of outside resources. Senior managers are accountable to the shareholders, the general public and to public bodies that oversee corporations and similar organizations. Some members of the senior management may serve as the public face of the organization, and they may make speeches to introduce new strategies or appear in marketing.

The board of directors is typically primarily composed of non-executives who owe a [[fiduciary]] duty to shareholders and are not closely involved in the day-to-day activities of the organization, although this varies depending on the type (e.g., public versus private), size and culture of the organization. These directors are theoretically liable for breaches of that duty and typically insured under [[directors and officers liability insurance]]. [[Fortune 500]] directors are estimated to spend 4.4 hours per week on board duties, and median compensation was $212,512 in 2010. The board sets corporate strategy, makes major decisions such as major acquisitions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/documents/03.Board%20Duties.pdf Board of Directors: Duties &amp; Liabilities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324044348/http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/documents/03.Board%20Duties.pdf |date=2014-03-24 }}. Stanford Graduate School of Business.&lt;/ref&gt; and hires, evaluates, and fires the top-level manager ([[Chief Executive Officer]] or CEO). The CEO typically hires other positions. However, board involvement in the hiring of other positions such as the [[Chief Financial Officer]] (CFO) has increased.&lt;ref&gt;DeMars L. (2006). [http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/7109019 Heavy Vetting: Boards of directors now want to talk to would-be CFOs — and vice versa]. ''CFO Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a survey of over 160 CEOs and directors of public and private companies found that the top weaknesses of CEOs were "[[mentoring]] skills" and "board engagement", and 10% of companies never evaluated the CEO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/cldr/research/surveys/performance.html 2013 CEO Performance Evaluation Survey]. Stanford Graduate School of Business.&lt;/ref&gt; The board may also have certain employees (e.g., [[internal auditor]]s) report to them or directly hire independent contractors; for example, the board (through the [[audit committee]]) typically selects the [[auditor]].

Helpful skills of top management vary by the type of organization but typically include&lt;ref&gt;Kleiman, Lawrence S. "Management and Executive Development."Reference for Business:Encyclopedia of Business(2010): n. page. 25 Mar 2011. [http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/management/Log-Mar/Management-and-Executive-Development.html].&lt;/ref&gt; a broad understanding of competition, world economies, and politics. In addition, the CEO is responsible for implementing and determining (within the board's framework) the broad policies of the organization. Executive management accomplishes the day-to-day details, including: instructions for preparation of department budgets, procedures, schedules; appointment of middle level executives such as department managers; coordination of departments; media and governmental relations; and shareholder communication.

===Middle===
Consist of [[general manager]]s, branch managers and department managers. They are accountable to the top management for their  department's function. They devote more time to organizational and directional functions. Their roles can be emphasized as executing organizational plans in conformance with the company's policies and the objectives of the top management, they define and discuss information and policies from top management to lower management, and most importantly they inspire and provide guidance to lower level managers towards better performance.

Middle management is the midway management of a categorized organization, being secondary to the senior management but above the deepest levels of operational members.  An operational manager may be well-thought-out by middle management, or may be categorized as non-management operate, liable to the policy of the specific organization. Efficiency of the middle level is vital in any organization, since they bridge the gap between top level and bottom level staffs.

Their functions include:
* Design and implement effective group and inter-group work and information systems.
* Define and monitor group-level performance indicators.
* Diagnose and resolve problems within and among work groups.
* Design and implement reward systems that support cooperative behavior. They also make decision and share ideas with top managers.

===Lower===
Lower managers include [[supervisor]]s, section leaders, forepersons and team leaders. They focus on controlling and directing regular employees. They are usually responsible for assigning employees' tasks, guiding and supervising employees on day-to-day activities, ensuring the quality and quantity of production and/or service, making recommendations and suggestions to employees on their work, and channeling employee concerns that they cannot resolve to mid-level managers or other administrators. First-level or "front line" managers also act as role models for their employees. In some types of work, front line managers may also do some of the same tasks that employees do, at least some of the time. For example, in some restaurants, the front line managers will also serve customers during a very busy period of the day.

Front-line managers typically provide:
* Training for new employees
* Basic supervision
* Motivation
* Performance feedback and guidance

Some front-line managers may also provide career planning for employees who aim to rise within the organization.

==Training==
Colleges and universities around the world offer bachelor's degrees, graduate degrees, diplomas and certificates in management, generally within their colleges of business, business schools or faculty of management but also in other related departments. In the 2010s, there has been an increase in online management education and training in the form of electronic [[educational technology]] ( also called e-learning). Online education has increased the accessibility of management training to people who do not live near a college or university, or who cannot afford to travel to a city where such training is available.

While some professions require academic credentials in order to work in the profession (e.g., law, medicine, engineering, which require, respectively the [[Bachelor of Law]], [[Doctor of Medicine]] and [[Bachelor of Engineering]] degrees), management and administration positions do not necessarily require the completion of academic degrees. Some well-known senior executives in the US who did not complete a degree include [[Steve Jobs]], [[Bill Gates]] and [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. However, many managers and executives have completed some type of business or management training, such as a [[Bachelor of Commerce]] or a [[Master of Business Administration]] degree. Some major organizations, including companies, not-for-profit organizations and governments, require applicants to managerial or executive positions to hold at minimum [[Bachelor's degree]] in a field related to administration or management, or in the case of business jobs, a Bachelor of Commerce or a similar degree.

===United States of America===

====Undergraduate====
At the undergraduate level, the most common business program is the [[Bachelor of Commerce]] (B.Com.).  However to manage technological areas, you need an undergraduate degree in a STEM area as preferred to Defense Acquisition University guidelines.  This is typically a four-year program that includes courses that give students an overview of the role of managers in planning and directing within an organization. Course topics include accounting, financial management, statistics, marketing, strategy, and other related areas. There are many other undergraduate degrees that include the study of management, such as [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees with a major in [[business administration]] or management and Bachelor of Public Administration (B.P.A), a degree designed for individuals aiming to work as [[bureaucrat]]s in the [[Public administration|government jobs]]. Many colleges and universities also offer certificates and diplomas in business administration or management, which typically require one to two years of full-time study.

====Graduate====
At the graduate level students aiming at careers as managers or executives may choose to specialize in major subareas of management or business administration such as [[entrepreneurship]], [[human resources]], [[international business]], [[organizational behavior]], [[organizational theory]], [[strategic management]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aom.org/Placement/AOM-Placement-Presentations.aspx|title=AOM Placement Presentations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[accounting]], [[corporate finance]], entertainment, global management, [[healthcare management]], [[investment management]], sustainability and [[real estate]]. A [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) is the most popular professional degree at the master's level and can be obtained from many universities in the United States. MBA programs provide further education in management and leadership for graduate students. Other master's degrees in business and management include [[Master of Management]] (MM) and the [[Master of Science]] (M.Sc.) in business administration or management, which is typically taken by students aiming to become researchers or professors. There are also specialized master's degrees in administration for individuals aiming at careers outside of business, such as the [[Master of Public Administration]] (MPA) degree (also offered as a [[Master of Arts]] in [[Public Administration]] in some universities), for students aiming to become managers or executives in the public service and the [[Master of Health Administration]], for students aiming to become managers or executives in the health care and hospital sector.

Management doctorates are the most advanced [[terminal degree]]s in the field of business and management. Most individuals obtaining management doctorates take the programs to obtain the training in research methods, statistical analysis and writing academic papers that they will need to seek careers as researchers, senior consultants and/or professors in business administration or management. There are three main types of management doctorates: the [[Doctor of Management]] (D.M.), the [[Doctor of Business Administration]] (D.B.A.), and the [[Ph.D.]] in Business Administration or Management. In the 2010s, doctorates in business administration and management are available with many specializations.

===Good practices===
While management trends can change so fast, the long term trend in management has been defined by a market embracing diversity and a rising service industry. Managers are currently being trained to encourage greater equality for minorities and women in the workplace, by offering increased flexibility in working hours, better retraining, and innovative (and usually industry-specific) performance markers. Managers destined for the service sector are being trained to use unique measurement techniques, better worker support and more charismatic leadership styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four Ways to Be A Better Boss|url=https://www.randstadusa.com/workforce360/workforce-insights/4-ways-to-be-a-better-boss/229/|website=www.randstadusa.com|publisher=Randstad USA|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human resources finds itself increasingly working with management in a training capacity to help collect management data on the success (or failure) of management actions with employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Role of HR in Uncertain Times|url=http://graphics.eiu.com/marketing/pdf/Oracle_HR.pdf|website=Economist Intelligence Unit|publisher=Economist Intelligence Unit|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Markus Fugger''' (Marx Fugger) ''von der Lilie'' (14 February 1529 – 18 June 1597) was a German politician and businessman of the [[Fugger]] family. He was the eldest son of [[Anton Fugger]]. He achieved several high offices - chamberlain to [[Archduke Ernest of Austria]], Kammerpräsident, member of the kurbayrische ([[Bavaria]]n) council, Pfleger ([[Vogt|reeve]]) in the Landshut, and city-pfleger in [[Augsburg]].

==Life==
On his father's death in 1560, he and his brothers [[Hans Fugger|Hans]] and Jakob jointly managed their father's business. When they split up the business in 1575, Markus took its northern division. With other family members, he took over part of the [[Fuggerhäuser]] in Augsburg. Similarly, on his father's death, as eldest son Markus led the newly founded Marx Fugger and Brothers Firm (Firma Marx Fugger und Gebrüder) for 30 years. He was interested in church history, acted as a patron to artists and collected books and antiquities, taking on Nikolaus Juvenel as a portrait painter in Augsburg. He organised sumptuous parties with hour-long firework displays. In 1595 he suffered a stroke, from which he never recovered, and so the business passed to his brother Hans.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1557, he married [[graf|Gräfin]] (countess) Sibylla von Eberstein (1531–1589), allying the Fugger family with a number of noble families in south-west Germany - the Margraves of Baden-Sponheim, the Counts of Hanau-Lichtenberg and the [[County of Eberstein|Counts of Eberstein]]. The marriage produced 13 children (8 girls and 5 boys), though the male-line descent from Markus died out in 1671.

The '''Non-Manufacturing ISM Report on Business''' is a purchasing survey of the [[United States]] [[service economy]], published by the [[Institute for Supply Management]] since June 1998. Its results are a popular economic indicator and forecaster. The survey is currently written by Anthony Nieves, C.P.M., CFPM, the Senior Vice President of Supply Management for Hilton Hotels Corporation.

Its primary index is the [[Non-Manufacturing Business Activity Index]].

The other indices are
* New Orders
* Employment
* Supplier Deliveries
* Inventories
* Prices 
* Backlog of Orders 
* New Export Orders
* Imports
* Inventory Sentiment

Business Activity, New Orders, Imports, and Employment indices are seasonally adjusted. All data points from this survey are made available at [http://www.thinknum.com/symbolsView/?chosenDataSetName=US%20Maco&amp;chosenSector=Non-Manufacturing%20ISM%20Report%20on%20Business US Macro &gt;&gt; Non-Manufacturing ISM Report on Business] (link outdated, 404)

The report is based on data compiled from monthly replies to questions asked of more than 370 purchasing and supply executives in over 62 different industries representing nine divisions from the [[Standard Industrial Classification]] categories.

Prior to his appointment as Ambassador, the UAE did not have a [[diplomatic mission]] in [[Moscow]] for many years. More recently, however, the UAE has invested roughly $6 billion [[USD]] in Russia's infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/portrait-of-a-nation-the-ambassador-entrepreneur-and-trekker&lt;/ref&gt; Ghobash believes Russia's participation in fighting [[extremism]] is integral to creating stability in the region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/people--politics-uae-and-russia-have-a-bond-that-will-only-grow-stronger&lt;/ref&gt; A delegation from [[Abu Dhabi]] led by the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Sheikh]] [[Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan]], has bolstered its presence at [[The Kremlin]] in 2015 to coproduce solutions to counter [[terrorism]] and conflicts in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/uae-and-russia-hold-talks-to-tackle-extremism-in-middle-east&lt;/ref&gt;

He is considered by many to be a [[thought leader]] on [[moderate Islam]] and the future of the [[Arab world]], often calling for change through technological innovation and education in Arab countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fighting ISIS in the Realm of Ideas|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/fighting-isis-in-the-realm-of-ideas/|publisher=Knowledge at Wharton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding extremism in young Muslims, he said, “The key challenge for us is to stop treating our youth with distance, because there are recruiters out there making sure to grab those youth from us.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Al Almeri|first1=Khalid|title=Our Youth Need Guidance|url=http://www.thenational.ae/opinion/comment/our-youth-need-guidance-to-stave-off-evil-forces|accessdate=6 March 2015|publisher=The National}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving funding from the government of [[Abu Dhabi]], Ghobash was involved in 2008 in discussions with [[John Sexton]] on the opening of a campus of [[New York University]] in [[Abu Dhabi]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/education/10global.html?pagewanted=print|title=U.S. Universities Rush to Set Up Outposts Abroad |last=Lewin|first=Tamar|date=10 February 2008|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghobash is an avid hiker, once spending five years climbing the mountains of [[Nepal]] and [[Switzerland]]. He speaks [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref name="gulf210908" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2362">Omega, comprising 226 hectares straddling the [[M62 motorway|M62]] Motorway in [[Warrington]], [[Cheshire]] is a property development site. The site comprises a large part of the former [[RAF Burtonwood|RAF/USAF Burtonwood airbase]]. A new junction on the M62 (junction 8) was built in anticipation of the development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwda.co.uk/news--events/press-releases/200201/junction-8,-m62-opens-in-time.aspx Junction 8, M62 opens in time for Christmas - Northwest Regional Development Agency&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole site will provide 650,000 sq m of offices, manufacturing and distribution space along with ancillary leisure/retail facilities, hotel and conference facilities. Around 24,000 jobs are likely to be created over the lifetime of the scheme to make one of Europe's largest [[business park]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siteselection.com/issues/2002/nov/p803/ Military Base Redevelopment: A Fighting Chance, Site Selection Magazine, November 2002&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to the economic downturn, planning conditions were relaxed in 2011 to allow phased development.

In July 2012 it was announced that the long-awaited £1bn development of Warrington’s Omega business park was to begin with a 200,000 sq ft warehouse and a £7 million contract for new roads at Omega North, opening up the site for further development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miller Developments starts £1bn Omega site|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/business/commercial_property/s/1583572_miller-developments-starts-1bn-omega-site|publisher=Manchester Evening News|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015 Omega North was complete with distribution warehouses for [[Brake Bros]], [[Hermes Group]], and [[Travis Perkins]]. Omega South had [[The Hut Group]] and the largest [[Walmart]] development outside the USA with an [[Asda]] distribution warehouse, and plans for retail, leisure, and phased housing developments.
 
A [[Warrington West railway station|new railway station]] on the Liverpool-Warrington-Manchester line has been proposed which will link with a bus service to the Omega site.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12149">'''Peer production''' (also known as [[mass collaboration]]) is a way of producing goods and services that relies on [[self-organizing]] communities of individuals. In such communities, the labor of a large number of people is coordinated towards a shared outcome.

==Overview==
Peer production is a process taking advantage of new [[collaborative]] possibilities afforded by the [[internet]] and has become a widespread mode of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Benkler |first=Yochai|title=Freedom in the Commons: Towards a Political Economy of Information|journal=Duke Law Journal|date=April 2003|volume=52|issue=6|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1191&amp;context=dlj|accessdate=28 November 2011|page=1245}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[free software|Free]] and [[open source software]] and [[open source hardware]] are two examples of peer production. One of the earliest instances of networked peer production is [[Project Gutenberg]], a project in which volunteers make out-of-copyright works available online.&lt;ref name="duguid" /&gt; Examples include [[Wikipedia]], an online encyclopedia, and [[Linux]], a computer operating system. For-profit enterprises mostly use partial implementations of peer production, and would include such sites as [[Flickr]], [[Etsy]], [[Digg]], and [[Delicious (website)|Delicious]].&lt;ref&gt;Benkler, Y., Shaw, A., &amp; Hill, B. M. (2015). ''Peer production: A form of collective intelligence'' (pp. 175-204). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Peer production can also be utilized by sharing [[open source hardware]] designs to be replicated with digital manufacturing technologies such as [[RepRap]] 3-D printers.&lt;ref&gt;RepRap stands for self '''rep'''licating '''rap'''id prototyper and the design of the printer itself is an example of peer production.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of such designs is growing exponentially on free design sites such as [[Youmagine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wittbrodt | first1 = B.T. | last2 = Glover | first2 = A.G. | last3 = Laureto | first3 = J. | last4 = Anzalone | first4 = G.C. | last5 = Oppliger | first5 = D. | last6 = Irwin | first6 = J.L. | last7 = Pearce | first7 = J.M. | year = 2013 | title = Life-cycle economic analysis of distributed manufacturing with open-source 3-D printers | url = | journal = Mechatronics | volume = 23 | issue = 6| pages = 713–726 | doi = 10.1016/j.mechatronics.2013.06.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer production refers to the production process on which the previous examples are based. [[Commons-based peer production]] is a subset of peer production.

Peer production occurs in a socio-technical system which allows thousands of individuals to effectively cooperate to create a non-exclusive given outcome.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benkler, Yochai]] and [[Nissenbaum Helen]], "Commons based Peer Production and Virtue"&lt;/ref&gt; These collective efforts are informal. Peer production is a collaborative effort with no limit to the amount of discussion or changes that can be made to the product. However, as in the case of Wikipedia, a large amount, in fact the majority, of this collaborative effort is maintained by very few devoted and active individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Huberman, Bernardo A, Wilkinson, Dennis M, Wu, Fang "Feedback loops of attention in peer production"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
[[Crowdsourcing]] products such as community [[cookbooks]] are a form of peer production. [[Gooseberry Patch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gooseberry Patch|url=http://www.gooseberrypatch.com/|publisher=Gooseberry Patch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  has used its customer/friend community to create its line of exclusive cookbooks for over 18 years.

For example, there are now several types of open-source solar-powered [[3-D printers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = King | first1 = Debbie L. | last2 = Babasola | first2 = Adegboyega | last3 = Rozario | first3 = Joseph | last4 = Pearce | first4 = Joshua M. | year = | title = Mobile Open-Source Solar-Powered 3-D Printers for Distributed Manufacturing in Off-Grid Communities | url = https://www.academia.edu/8603622/Mobile_Open-Source_Solar-Powered_3-D_Printers_for_Distributed_Manufacturing_in_Off-Grid_Communities | journal = Challenges in Sustainability | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 18–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used for production in [[off grid]] locations&lt;ref&gt;D.J. Pangburn, How 3D Printers Are Boosting Off-The-Grid, Underdeveloped Communities - MotherBoard available at http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-3d-printers-are-boosting-off-the-grid-underdeveloped-communities Nov. 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and other forms of [[open source appropriate technology]] like the use of biomaterials.&lt;ref&gt;Rocco, G.R., 2015. Developing Maker Economies in Post-Industrial Cities: Applying Commons Based Peer Production to Mycelium Biomaterials.http://scholarworks.umass.edu/masters_theses_2/257/&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer production has also been utilized in producing collaborative [[Open Educational Resources]] (OERs). [[Writing Commons]], an international open textbook spearheaded by Joe Moxley at the [[University of South Florida]], has evolved from a print textbook into a crowd-sourced resource for college writers around the world.&lt;ref&gt;"About."{{cite web|title=Writing Commons|url=http://writingcommons.org/about|publisher=CC BY-NC-ND 3.0|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massive open online course]] (MOOC) platforms have also generated interest in building online [[eBooks]]. The Cultivating Change Community (CCMOOC) at the [[University of Minnesota]] is one such project founded entirely on a grassroots model to generate content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Anders |first=Abram |title=Experimenting with MOOCs: Network-based Communities of Practice. |booktitle=Great Plains Alliance for Computers and Writing Conference |date=November 9, 2012 |location=Mankato, MN |url=https://cultivatingchange.wp.d.umn.edu/community/ccmooc-experimenting-with-moocs-at-gpacw/ |accessdate=February 11, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107091212/https://cultivatingchange.wp.d.umn.edu/community/ccmooc-experimenting-with-moocs-at-gpacw/ |archivedate=November 7, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 10 weeks, 150 authors contributed more than 50 chapters to the CCMOOC eBook and companion site.&lt;ref&gt;"About."{{cite web|title=Cultivating Change Community|url=https://cultivatingchange.wp.d.umn.edu/community/about/|publisher=CC BY-NC 3.0|accessdate=11 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630121618/https://cultivatingchange.wp.d.umn.edu/community/about/|archivedate=30 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Peer to Peer University]] has applied peer production principles to online open learning communities and [[peer learning]].

==Criticism==
Several critics have challenged the prevailing optimism with which peer production is viewed.

Daniel Kreiss, Megan Finn, and Fred Turner criticize the consensus perspective on peer production as utopian. Asserting that this new mode of production challenges the traditional form of [[bureaucracy]], they reference [[Max Weber]]’s analysis of modern bureaucracy and urge that this analysis be applied to peer production. They argue that bureaucracy is better equipped to handle social problems than peer production, which they consider unsustainable. As bureaucracy promotes a rationally organized, rule-oriented functioning of society,  Kreiss, Finn, and Turner claim that peer production undermines this aspect due to its tendency to encourage individual behavior based on private morality. This tendency, they argue, degrades [[autonomy]] by “collapsing public and private boundaries,” allowing people’s professional lives to extend into their private domains.&lt;ref name=Kreiss&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kreiss|first1=Daniel|last2=Finn|first2=Megan|last3=Turner|first3=Fred|title=The limits of peer production|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/13/2/243.full.pdf+html|website=Sage Journals|publisher=Sage|accessdate=24 May 2014|pages=243–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics claim that the participatory nature of peer production is apt to generate misinformation and products of inferior quality. In his book [[The Cult of the Amateur]], [[Andrew Keen]] assesses peer-produced content on the [[Internet]] and asserts that it exists as a “smokescreen” which emptily promises more truth and deeper knowledge, but actually leading to the disappearance of truth. According to Keen, the Internet advocates peer production to a questionable degree by permitting anyone to post information freely. This form of peer production, he cautions, leaves room for people to plagiarize ideas and distort original thoughts, which he says ultimately creates an uncertainty in the validity of information.&lt;ref name=Keen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keen|first1=Andrew|title=The Cult of the Amateur: How Today's Internet Is Killing Our Culture|date=2007|publisher=Crown Business|edition=3rd|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another critic, [[Jaron Lanier]], cites [[Wikipedia]] as an example of how dependence on mass collaboration may result in unreliable or biased information. He warns that websites like Wikipedia promote the notion of the “collective” as all knowing, and that this concentrated influence stands in direct contrast to representative [[democracy]].&lt;ref name=Lanier&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lanier|first1=Jaron|title=You Are Not a Gadget: A Manifesto|date=2010|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|edition=1st|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these adversarial views, some critics assert that peer production does not perform as well in some contexts as it does in others.&lt;ref name=Benkler&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benkler|first1=Yochai|last2=Shaw|first2=Aaron|last3=Mako Hill|first3=Benjamin|title=Peer Production: A Modality of Collective Intelligence|url=http://mako.cc/academic/benkler_shaw_hill-peer_production_ci.pdf|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Duguid suggests that peer production works less efficiently outside of [[software development]], stating that continued reliance on peer production in various domains of information production will necessitate a search for new ways to guarantee quality.&lt;ref name="duguid"&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 1396-0466| volume = 11| issue = 10| last = Duguid| first = Paul| title = Limits of self-organization: Peer production and "laws of quality"
| journal = First Monday| accessdate = 2014-09-26| date = 2006-10-02| url = http://ojphi.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1405}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yochai Benkler]] similarly proposes that peer production may produce functional works like [[encyclopedias]] more proficiently than creative works.&lt;ref name="Benkler" /&gt; Despite the valuable potential of peer production, several critics continue to doubt extensive collaboration and its ability to yield high quality outputs.&lt;ref name="Benkler" /&gt;

'''Plastic resin pellet pollution''' is a type of [[marine debris]] originating from plastic particles utilized in manufacturing large-scale plastics. These pre-production plastic pellets are created separately from the user plastics they are melted down to form, and pellet loss is incurred during both the manufacturing and transport stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pelletwatch.org/en/what.html|title=What's resin pellet? :: International Pellet Watch|website=www.pelletwatch.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly referred to as [[Microplastics|nurdles]], these plastics are released into the open environment, creating pollution in the oceans and on beaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-3414-6_1|title=Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology|last=Hammer|first=Jort|last2=Kraak|first2=Michiel H. S.|last3=Parsons|first3=John R.|date=2012|publisher=Springer, New York, NY|isbn=9781461434139|series=Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology|pages=1–44|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-3414-6_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Plastic resin pellets are classified as primary source [[microplastics]], meaning that they were intentionally produced at the size ranging from 1–5&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;GESAMP (2015). “Sources, fate and effects of microplastics in the marine environment: a global assessment” (Kershaw, P. J., ed.). (IMO/FAO/UNESCO-IOC/UNIDO/WMO/IAEA/UN/UNEP/UNDP Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection). Rep. Stud. GESAMP No. 90, 96 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 60 billion pounds (27 million [[tonne]]s) of nurdles are manufactured annually in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthebay.org/currentissues/ppi/bills_AB258.asp|title=Heal the Bay - The Pacific Protection Initiative - AB 258: Nurdles|date=20 April 2008|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420095307/http://healthebay.org/currentissues/ppi/bills_AB258.asp|archivedate=20 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One pound of [[pelletizing|pelletized]] [[HDPE]] contains approximately 25,000 nurdles (approximately 20&amp;nbsp;[[milligram|mg]] per nurdle). They are typically under {{convert|5|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="blog"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/archive/2006/11/whats_a_nurdle.html|title=What's a nurdle?|date=7 November 2006|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mCCdKBcf?url=http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/archive/2006/11/whats_a_nurdle.html|archivedate=2009-12-21|accessdate=2009-12-21|postscript=.|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[File:Granulés plastiques industriels sur une plage de la côte Aquitaine.JPG|thumb|300px|Nurdles on a beach in southwest France, 2011.]]
Nurdles are a major contributor to [[marine debris]]. During a three-month study of [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] beaches researchers found them to be the most common beach contaminant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =  Moore | first = Charles | title = A comparison of neustonic plastic and zooplankton abundance in southern California's coastal waters and elsewhere in the North Pacific | work = Algalita Marine Research Foundation | year = 2002 | url = http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Ocean/Marine-Debris-Panel30oct02.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nurdles comprised roughly 98% of the beach debris collected in a 2001 Orange County study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opc.ca.gov/webmaster/ftp/pdf/agenda_items/20070208/0702COPC05_MarineDebris_Resolution.pdf "Adopted Marine Debris Resolution"]&lt;/ref&gt; Waterborne nurdles may either be a raw material of [[Plastics engineering|plastic production]], or from larger chunks of plastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6218698.stm|title=Plastics 'poisoning world's seas'|last=Ayre|first=Maggie|date=7 December 2006|work=[[BBC Online]]|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major concentration of plastic may be the [[Great Pacific garbage patch]], a growing collection of [[marine debris]] known for its high concentrations of plastic litter.

Nurdles that escape from the plastic production process into waterways or oceans have become a significant source of ocean and beach [[plastic pollution#Ocean|plastic pollution]]. Plastic pellet pollution that has been monitored in studies is mainly found in the sediments and beach areas and is usually [[polyethylene]] or [[polypropylene]], the two main plastic polymers found in [[Microplastics|microplastic]] pollution.&lt;ref&gt;GESAMP (2015). “Sources, fate and effects of microplastics in the marine environment: a global assessment” (Kershaw, P. J., ed.). (IMO/FAO/UNESCO-IOC/UNIDO/WMO/IAEA/UN/UNEP/UNDP Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection). Rep. Stud. GESAMP No. 90, 96 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Marine life is severely threatened by these small pieces of plastic; the creatures that make up the base of the marine [[Food web|food chain]], such as [[krill]], are prematurely dying by choking on nurdles.&lt;ref name="worldwithout"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weisman|first=Alan|title=The World Without Us|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books |date=July 10, 2007|chapter=9|isbn=978-0-312-34729-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nurdles have frequently been found in the [[digestive tract]]s of various marine creatures, causing physiological damage by [[Leaching (chemistry)|leaching]] plasticizers such as [[Polyvinyl chloride#Phthalate plasticizers|phthalates]].  Nurdles can carry two types of micropollutants in the marine environment: native plastic additives and [[hydrophobic]] pollutants absorbed from seawater. For example, concentrations of [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s and [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]] on nurdles collected from Japanese coastal waters were found to be up to 1 million times higher than the levels detected in surrounding seawater.&lt;ref&gt;Mato Y: "Plastic resin pellets as a transport medium for toxic chemicals in the marine environment", "Environmental Science &amp; Technology" 35(2), pages 318–324, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Plastic microbeads used in [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|cosmetic exfoliating]] products are also found in water.

==Incidents==
'''2018'''

USA - Pennsylvania - Semi-truck crash leading to release of nurdles into Pocono Creek, with a picture of the nurdles in Spring Run (The Morning Call, 9 April 2018).

'''2017'''

South Africa - Durban - Nurdle spill leading to extended cleanup efforts. An overview of the response can be found here (http://www.coastkzn.co.za/nurdles)

UK - "The Great Nurdle Hunt" occurring from June 2-5th, 2017 - across the United Kingdom drew attention to the issue of plastic pellet pollution. A program started by Fidra, a Scottish environmental charity, sourced information on nurdles from citizens across the region using shared photos to better understand the makeup of pollution across beaches in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nurdlehunt.org.uk/images/Leaflets/Results-140717.pdf|title=The Great European Nurdle Hunt|last=|first=|date=|website=Nurdle Free Oceans|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nurdle hunts occurring earlier in 2017 determined that 73% of UK beaches had nurdle pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/17/tiny-plastic-pellets-found-on-73-of-uk-beaches|title=Tiny plastic pellets found on 73% of UK beaches|last=Association|first=Press|date=2017-02-17|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2012'''

USA - San Francisco Bay Coastal Cleanup from multiple nurdle spills (https://baynature.org/article/tiny-plastics-have-become-big-problem-in-coastal-cleanup/)

In [[Hong Kong]], after being blown by [[Typhoon Vicente (2012)|Typhoon Vicente]] on 24 July 2012, some containers belonging to Chinese oil giant [[Sinopec]] which were carrying over 150 tonnes of plastic pellets were blown into the sea, washing up on southern Hong Kong coasts, such as [[Shek O]], [[Cheung Chau]], [[Ma Wan]] and [[Lamma Island]]. The spill disrupted marine life and is being credited with killing stocks of fish on fish farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/09/hong-kong-plastic-spill|title=Sinopec pledges help to clear Hong Kong plastic spill|date=9 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-24|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current progress and solutions ==
The plastic industry has responded to the increased interest and concern for plastic pellet loss and pollution sources. Operation Clean Sweep was created by [[Plastics Industry Association (PLASTICS)|SPI: The Plastics Industry Trade Association]] in 2001 and joined by the [[American Chemistry Council]] with the goal of zero pellet loss for plastic manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inthehopper.org/spi-news/operation-clean-sweep-celebrates-25-years/|title=Operation Clean Sweep Celebrates 25 Years {{!}} In The Hopper: SPI's Business Blog|website=In The Hopper: SPI's Business Blog|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This voluntary stewardship program provides its members with a manual which guides them through ways in which they can reduce pellet loss within their own facilities and provides the necessary training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://opcleansweep.org/manual/|title=OCS Program Manual - Operation Clean Sweep|work=Operation Clean Sweep|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actions for creating awareness ==
On April 11, 2013 in order to create awareness, artist [[Maria Cristina Finucci]] founded The [[Garbage Patch State]] at [[UNESCO]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/venice/about-this-office/single-view/news/the_garbage_patch_territory_turns_into_a_new_state/#.U71u8fl_u9U|title=The garbage patch territory turns into a new state - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|publisher=unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; –Paris in front of Director General [[Irina Bokova]]. First of a series of events under the patronage of [[UNESCO]] and of Italian Ministry of the Environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rivistasitiunesco.it/articolo.php?id_articolo=2073 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103173331/http://www.rivistasitiunesco.it/articolo.php?id_articolo=2073 |archivedate=2014-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roland "Roel" Pieper''' (born 1956) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] IT-[[entrepreneur]].

==Early life and education==
Pieper was born (April 13, 1956) in [[Vlaardingen]], son of an [[engineer]] at a car manufacturer. His father died when Pieper was 20, and on his 18th birthday he suffered a motoring accident which destroyed his sporting career as a player of the [[Juventus Schiedam]] [[basketball]] team. According to Pieper, both of these experiences instilled him with a certain toughness. Pieper obtained his [[MSc - Ir - degree]] from the [[Delft University of Technology]], 1980, in [[computer science]].

==Career in the United States==
After graduation, he worked for ten years for [[Software AG]] (both in [[Germany]] and in the [[United States]]), where he became Chief Technology Officer for the US branch. After leaving Software AG he was selected to be the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for [[Unix System Laboratories]] in the United States, a division of Bell Laboratories of  [[AT&amp;T]]. In 1993, after the resignation of co-founder [[Ralph Ungermann]], Roel became the president and CEO of [[Ungermann-Bass]].  Ungermann was tied to [[Tandem]] by an earlier [[White knight (business)|White Knight]] deal and Ungermann resigned after his required term. Roel renamed the company [[UB Networks]] while it was a subsidiary of [[Tandem Computers]]. Roel restructured [[UB Networks]] research investments into [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] technology, which was popular at the time, instead of continuing Ralph Ungermann's earlier successful investments and leadership in Ethernet technology.  Ungermann-Bass developed the first Virtual Network Architecture (VNA) in 1993. The ATM business was subsequently sold by Roel to Cisco. UB Networks itself was sold to Newbridge Networks successfully in 1996 after Pieper joined Tandem Computers as CEO. In 1996 Pieper became president and CEO of Tandem Computers where he was instrumental in repositioning the company. Under Pieper's leadership Tandem was sold to [[Compaq]] in 1997, and Pieper became a member of the executive board of Compaq. During his time in the US, Pieper gained a reputation as a successful restructurer. Under Pieper's leadership, USL, UB and Tandem Computer were successfully restructured and sold to strategic players in the industry.

==Career in the Netherlands==
Pieper returned to the Netherlands in 1998. For one year he was board member of the Dutch electronics giant [[Philips]] by invitation of [[Cor Boonstra]], then Philips' president. This involvement ended abruptly in May 1999 when Pieper got involved in the claimed coding technology of [[Jan Sloot]], a connection Pieper made on behalf of Philips. Philips officially decided not to use the technology. Pieper then decided to support the invention as a private investor and later also as board member, though Sloot's claimed huge compression is mathematically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ticc.uvt.nl/~pspronck/sloot.html |title=The Stick of Jan Sloot |publisher=Ticc.uvt.nl |date= |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inventor died of a heart attack shortly after he demonstrated his technology to a group of 20 investors and technology companies in the summer of 1999. After one year, Pieper ended his employment at Philips with a severance package of undisclosed value.

In 1998, together with ex-minister of economy [[Hans Wijers]], Pieper set up Twinning, an incubator for starting entrepreneurs, particularly in the IT and especially the Internet sector. The project received ninety Million [[Guilder]]s of government subsidy, and as the [[Dot-com bubble]] burst, the ministry decided to sell Twinning to a group of private investors. Of the fifty companies that Twinning started, more than 35 are still operating and some very successfully.

Pieper also independently took part in more than 30 IT businesses all as investor and or adviser. On 1 September 1999 Pieper was appointed as a professor of Electronic Commerce, a newly created chair at the faculty of informatics and technology management of the [[University of Twente]]. Pieper ended as a professor of business administration and corporate governance at the university of Twente in 2013.

At the end of 1999, Pieper founded [[Insight Capital Partners Europe]], a private investment fund for IT-businesses, later operating under the name of Favonius Ventures, particularly in the field of e-commerce. In November 2000 he became Chairman of the Board of [[Lernout &amp; Hauspie]], a Flemish company specializing in speech recognition technology. Pieper was instrumental in uncovering a financial scandal at this company, which took place in the period 1996-1999, before he joined the company. In cooperation with the Belgian authorities, Pieper helped to secure information that ultimately led to the formal charging of the founders Jo Lernout and Pol Hauspie. Pieper left as Chairman of the board after the shareholders decided to appoint a new CEO and board.

In 2001, Pieper entered into the board of advisors of Nearshore IT services company, [[Levi9 Global Sourcing]] and conducted a study requested by minister [[Tineke Netelenbos]] for setting up a system for road pricing, called ''Mobimiles''.  Later that year he became president of [[Connekt]], an organisation for addressing road tolling issues in the Netherlands. He presided as Chairman for seven years.

==Eclipse Aviation==
In 2003, Pieper started a new venture involving Very Light Jets ([[VLJ]]), in cooperation with Albuquerque, New Mexico-based [[Eclipse Aviation Corporation]].

Pieper, together with a Russian businessman Daniel Bolotin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoominfo.com/Search/ReferencesView.aspx?PersonID=1179760532 ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; started the joint venture investment business creating a Netherlands-based company called European Technology and Investment Research Center, or ETIRC BV.

The main project of ETIRC was ETIRC Aviation, which sought to establish an [[Air Taxi]] network for Europe, Turkey and Russia and a second manufacturing location for the Eclipse 500 jet in Russia for the European market. In July 2008, the Luxembourg-based ETIRC Aviation, which by then had become Eclipse Aviation's largest shareholder, ousted Eclipse Aviation founder Vern Raburn from his position as CEO.  Pieper then took over the job of acting CEO for Eclipse Corporation at the request of the shareholders and bondholders.

In the autumn of 2008, after Pieper had decided to raise the price of the Eclipse 500 aircraft substantially, several Eclipse customers sued Eclipse for the return of their deposits, claiming they had waited years for the delivery of their Eclipse 500 jets. After the collapse of the financial markets in autumn of 2008, the company Eclipse needed to be restructured and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, with the stated plan that a new company, headed by Pieper, would buy the assets of Eclipse and continue manufacturing. Pieper attempted to secure the necessary funds for this acquisition, but was unsuccessful largely due to the economic downturn, which led to several potential investors bowing out at the last moment.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Eclipse Aviation ran out of money in mid-February 2009, ceased operations, and laid off its remaining 850 employees. On February 25, a group of creditors petitioned the Delaware bankruptcy court to convert Eclipse's bankruptcy to Chapter 7 liquidation. Soon thereafter, the board of directors (including Pieper) acknowledged the company had no other options but to file for Chapter 7, effectively ending the company's 10-year run, during which it spent an estimated $2 billion in investments and loans. Various reports following the Chapter 7 filing of the company insinuated financial problems for Pieper including an email from Pieper himself &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sprout.nl/74/6955/nieuws/roel-pieper-nadert-faillissement.html |title=Roel Pieper nadert faillissement - Nieuws - Sprout, Inspireert ondernemers |publisher=Sprout.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2009, following the Chapter 7 filing of Eclipse Aviation, ETIRC BV in the Netherlands also declared bankruptcy. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] newspaper ''[[de Volkskrant]]'' reported that Pieper had invested US$146 million in Eclipse through ETIRC.&lt;ref name="Marsh16Apr09"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.aopa.org/aircraft/articles/2009/090416etirc.html|title = Investor who tried to save Eclipse is bankrupt|accessdate = 2009-04-13|last = Marsh|first = Alton K.|authorlink = |date = April 2009|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090425134245/http://www.aopa.org/aircraft/articles/2009/090416etirc.html|archivedate = 2009-04-25|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roel Pieper has two lawsuits pending on the demise of ETIRC BV. The first case led by a group of consultants who claim to not have been paid for six months was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quotenet.nl/biz/roel-pieper-verliest-wederom-rechtszaak.php |title=Roel Pieper verliest nog een rechtszaak en moet consultants Etirc €430.000 betalen - Quotenet - de website van Quote |publisher=Quotenet.nl |date=2010-12-06 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archief.nrc.nl/index.php/2010/December/4/Economie/17/Pieper+verliest+rechtszaak/check=Y |title=Pieper verliest rechtszaak |publisher=Archief.nrc.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401215415/http://archief.nrc.nl/index.php/2010/December/4/Economie/17/Pieper+verliest+rechtszaak/check=Y |archivedate=2012-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including a delay and review of a case by a legal firm that specialises in take-overs and bankruptcy claims,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.depers.nl/economie/466586/Iedereen-wil-geld-van-Pieper.html |title=Iedereen wil geld van Pieper |publisher=DePers.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216231359/http://www.depers.nl/economie/466586/Iedereen-wil-geld-van-Pieper.html |archivedate=2012-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Al Mann, who had Roel Pieper sign a 10 million collateral before he would invest 20 million in Eclipse. Al Mann and Roel Pieper have subsequently settled out of court &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=leagle.com |url=http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=In%20NYCO%2020101019285.xml&amp;docbase=CSLWAR3-2007-CURR |title=ALFRED E. MANN v. ETIRC - Decided October 19, 2010 |publisher=Leagle.com |date=2010-10-19 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although in a court case of 2016 there were still outstanding issues with Mann &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.quotenet.nl/Nieuws/Wereldwijd-beslag-gelegd-op-bezit-zwangere!-Roel-Pieper-169731|title='Wereldwijd beslag gelegd op bezit (zwangere!) Roel Pieper'|work=Quote|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

This investment was done with non-collateral US$150 million credit of Russian "Sviaz-bank". The Russian newspaper ''[[Vedomosti]]'' reported that this credit became later an object of an investigation in Russia, of which Pieper was not a part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article/2010/07/08/239926 |title=ВЕДОМОСТИ - Крупным планом: Как раздать миллиард |publisher=Vedomosti.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time he was fighting to save Eclipse, Pieper was investing tens of millions of dollars in a Russian technology to extract diesel fuel from coal. The Coal to Liquid project is on hold and will restart when oil prices have reached prices again above 100 dollars per barrel.

==Failures and successes==
Any venture capital investor is expected to have some of its investments fail, and Pieper has been able to keep a good set of results between failures and successes. Various successful companies include Veritas Software, Netwise, Quokka Sports, Google, TiVo, Netscape, General Instrument, Lost Boys, and various others. Some failures include a magazine, ''Opinio'', much older projects such as a web site, Tradingcars.com, and the telecommunications company Stonehenge. Efforts to start MyGuide, a company specializing in GPS navigation units and meant to compete with TomTom, also failed. Roel Pieper has been held accountable by the receivership of MyGuide for the lack of an administration, a coherent strategy and inferior products. There is currently a claim of 2 million Euros pending, which Pieper claims to be erroneous. At the trial it was noted that he maintained bad bookkeeping but due to the nature of the laws was unable to be held personally accountable.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quotenet.nl/Nieuws/Uitspraak-in-zaak-My-Guide-en-Roel-Pieper-zet-deur-open-voor-wanbeleid-en-fraude-103759&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, all cases around MyGuide have been closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quotenet.nl/biz/curator-roel-pieper-moet-2-miljoen-betalen.php |title=Curator MyGuide stelt Roel Pieper aansprakelijk voor ruim €2 miljoen - Quotenet - de website van Quote |publisher=Quotenet.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015 Roel Pieper had a court case pending regarding outstanding legal fees from Goodwin Procter &lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/24845365/__Familie_Pieper_voor_rechter__.html&lt;/ref&gt; which as of 2016 has been ruled in favour of goodwin procer. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.quotenet.nl/Nieuws/Roel-Pieper-verliest-weer-rechtszaak-en-moet-eindelijk-1-3-miljoen-neertellen-173595&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2016 the Goodwin Proctor lawsuit was settled out of court in a mutual agreement between all parties. 

==Pursuit Dynamics==
In 2009 Pieper was appointed CEO of UK-based production technology firm, Pursuit Dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=200909010700212682Y |title=FE Investegate &amp;#124;Pursuit Dynamics PLC Announcements &amp;#124; Pursuit Dynamics PLC: Appointment of new CEO |publisher=Investegate.co.uk |date=2009-09-01 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently left the firm on 15 December 2011 as a result of a conflict with some shareholders who forced a rights issue which was announced after the company failed to meet revenue targets. Pieper resigned after the board of directors decided to support the rights issue strategy demanded by one group of shareholders.  The company subsequently was unable to return to its full potential as the rights issue created a period of high volatility and uncertainty. The company in fact never survived that decision and was unable to attract any substantial new business. The company sold its assets and was effectively liquidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/tag/roel-pieper/ |title=FT Alphaville » Roel Pieper |publisher=Ftalphaville.ft.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdx.biz/company/company-regulatory-news/the-resignation-of-ceo-roel-pieper |title=The resignation of CEO Roel Pieper |publisher=Pdx.biz |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RiRo Ventures==
Since 2002 the Pieper family has invested in a number of high tech ventures. The investments are not limited to a geography or to a specific sector. In a number of these ventures the strategic direction of the investments becomes evident. New energy, engines, propulsion and a number of unique IT technologies such as the Antenna Company which was founded and funded together with Marcel Boekhoorn who is a long term business partner and friend of the family. Since the failure of Eclipse Aviation due to the financial crisis in 2009, most of Pieper's activities have been related to the RiRo Ventures main investments. A new website describing these activities has been created recently named after the successor company BJMD Ventures. Both RiRO Ventures and BJMD Ventures are part of a family fund structure created to support investments globally.

==Personal life==
In May 2003, Pieper was target of an attack by a confused deranged man who broke into his house in [[Aerdenhout]], and stabbed his wife who made a full recovery. Pieper publicly blamed the Dutch police as the attacker was caught trespassing on the property, including with video proof, on previous occasions. The Dutch police refused to act until the attack almost killed Pieper's wife. The man who stabbed Pieper's wife was convicted and sentenced to [[compulsory psychiatric treatment]] in a closed judicial institute ([[Terbeschikkingstelling]] in the Dutch language). He then was granted a temporary leave in 2007. The man has since been reinstated into supervised custody.
Pieper emigrated to Monaco in March 2008. The stated reason being that he was not informed, or was informed far too late, by the police or [[Ministry of Justice (Netherlands)|Ministry of Justice]] of this temporary leave of the attacker, although the government officials had promised to do so in writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtl.nl/(/actueel/rtlnieuws/binnenland/articleview/)/components/actueel/rtlnieuws/2008/04_april/02/binnenland/0402_0715_Piper_uit_Nederland_om_tbs-er.xml |title=Tbs'er jaagt Pieper naar Frankrijk |language=nl |publisher=Rtl.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fd.nl/csFdArtikelen/WEB-HFD/y2008/m04/d02/roelpieper?t=Roel_Pieper_verlaat_Nederland_ Roel Pieper verlaat Nederland - Het Financieele Dagblad] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404060251/http://www.fd.nl/csFdArtikelen/WEB-HFD/y2008/m04/d02/roelpieper?t=Roel_Pieper_verlaat_Nederland_ |date=April 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2007, Pieper became one of the major stakeholders of the [[Amsterdam]] Basketball Club and was also working with the city of Amsterdam on a new youth project for integration and education focuses on sports. After Pieper emigrated in March 2008, Pieper no longer was involved with Amsterdam Basketball which closed its doors in April 2011 after it was unable to attract new sponsors to remain in the first league of basketball in the Netherlands. The club BC Apollo has since been revived to become the largest basketball club in the Netherlands with plans to return to the first (ere-) division of basketball after winning the championship in the second division. In the years after, the BC Apollo has returned successfully to first premier league of basketball in the Netherlands.   

In the summer of 2008, Pieper was helmsman on the Favonius yacht (Swan 82) and he successfully claimed the Swan World Cup in Porto Cervo, Italy. Together with his longtime associate and navigator Roy Heiner, Pieper finally won this event after various attempts. The hobby of sailing and regattas were given to Pieper by his father who taught him sailing and racing at a very young age. Pieper's father bought a small yacht called Favonius in 1974 and as a remembrance Pieper always tried to use that name as part of his memories of his father. In 2013 Pieper has assisted in creating the K3 Foundation in Portland, Oregon, USA. The target of the foundation is to restore and maintain the globally well known sailing yacht Kialoa III. The yacht has successfully returned to the racing scene in 2015. 

In the years after 2014, Pieper has been active in Ukraine in a number of investment projects. One of the projects is related to establishing the bio ethanol market based on the huge supply of corn in the Ukraine.

'''Taichiro Morinaga''' (1865–1937) was a Japanese philanthropist and entrepreneur.  In 1918, he founded [[Morinaga &amp; Company|Morinaga &amp; Co]], the first modern candy company in Japan, and the first to produce chocolates in the country.

Now known for the popular fruit candy [[Hi-Chew]], one of [[Morinaga &amp; Company|Morinaga &amp; Co]]'s first products was [[marshmallow]].[[Taichiro Morinaga#cite note-IBD-1|[1]]][[Taichiro Morinaga#cite note-Minato-2|[2]]]

==Early life==
Morinaga (1865–1937) was born on Japan's southern island of [[Kyushu]].  He had no formal education. His father died when he was 7. Later he became a potter's apprentice and went to [[Tokyo]] in his teens to sell pottery.  He became a branch manager for a wholesaler in nearby [[Yokohama]] but his branch lost money after extending too much credit to customers because of leniency.  Since employees were personally responsible for such losses, Morinaga searched for a way to repay his boss.&lt;ref name='IBD'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article/540295/201007141641/Japans-Taichiro-Morinaga-Turned-Candy-Into-Sweet-Sales.aspx | title = Japan's Taichiro Morinaga Turned Candy Into Sweet Sales | accessdate = 2010-07-17 | last = Tsuoruka | first = Doug | date = 2010-07-14 | work = Investor's Business Daily | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130126121424/http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article/540295/201007141641/Japans-Taichiro-Morinaga-Turned-Candy-Into-Sweet-Sales.aspx | archivedate = 2013-01-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With no local prospects found to repay the loss, Morinaga, at age 23, moved to the [[United States]] where he opened a hardware store in [[San Francisco]].  However, the venture was unsuccessful due to local boycotting due to his race.&lt;ref name="IBD"/&gt;  During the visit, he converted to [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name='Minato'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lib.city.minato.tokyo.jp/yukari/e/man-detail.cgi?id=133 | title = Prominent People of Minato City: Taichiro Morinaga | accessdate = 2010-07-17 | publisher = Minato City Local History Museum / Minato City Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Candy pioneer in Japan==
During his time in the United States, an unidentified American gave him a piece of candy which was a new appetizing treat for Morinaga.  Having led an impoverished life in Japan, Morinaga had never tasted such a delicious treat.  At the time, candy in Japan was expensive and consisted of either boiled beans or bee honey, which was based on sweets originally brought by Chinese and Portuguese traders centuries earlier or even more expensive candy imported from Europe.  Morinaga returned to Japan but came to the United States for a second time.&lt;ref name=Minato /&gt; He was unable to obtain candy apprentice jobs in the United States because of his race.  Instead, he worked as a janitor in a candy factory to gain experience.  After interviewing a number of Japanese people in the United States, Moringa discovered that marshmallows were popular but unavailable in Japan.&lt;ref name=IBD /&gt;  This second visit to study candy manufacture lasted ten years.&lt;ref name="Minato" /&gt;

In 1899, he left the United States and initially sold candy from a push cart.  Later that year, he opened a candy shop in [[Tokyo]] ([[Minato, Tokyo|Minato City]]), the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop (later Morinaga Confectionery),&lt;ref name='Minato' /&gt;&lt;ref name='CompanyWebsite'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.morinaga.co.jp/english/dl_pdf/p21-22.pdf | title = Morinaga Pioneer History | accessdate = 2010-07-17 | format = PDF | publisher = Morinaga and Co., Ltd. | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110718202923/http://www.morinaga.co.jp/english/dl_pdf/p21-22.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; with Hanzaburo Matsuzaki, a business partner and fellow [[Christian]].&lt;ref name=IBD /&gt;

Morinaga later founded [[Morinaga &amp; Company|Morinaga &amp; Co]], the first modern candy company in Japan and the first to produce chocolates in the country when it started in 1918,&lt;ref name=IBD /&gt;&lt;ref name='Minato' /&gt; one year after opening a company dairy.  Morinaga is considered one of Japan's greatest industrialists who was not part of a [[zaibatsu]].&lt;ref name='JapEcoBook'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Flath | first1 = David | title = The Japanese Economy | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2005 | pages = 48 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8yXBx1ZkvasC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=Taichiro+Morinaga#v=onepage&amp;q=Taichiro%20Morinaga&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2010-07-17 | isbn = 0-19-927861-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early difficulties of the company included the fact that Japan had little commercial milk production, obliging the company to open its own [[dairy]]. Another difficulty was that Japan had little arable land for crops and no locally produced corn or sugar cane to make [[corn syrup]].

Currently, [[Morinaga &amp; Company|Morinaga &amp; Co]]. is one of Japan's biggest candy makers, with 2008 sales of $1.5 billion and over 5,000 employees.  The company also operates restaurants, coffee shops, cafeterias and golf courses in Japan.  The affiliated company, Morinaga Milk Industry, sells powdered milk and other dairy products worldwide, as well as health food snacks.&lt;ref name="IBD" /&gt;  In 2008, Morinaga America, Inc. was opened in the United States.&lt;ref name="CompanyWebsite" /&gt;

One of his early products were [[marshmallows]], which he called "angel food" because of their color and the association with Christianity, his own religion.  He developed a type of caramel, called [[Hi-Chew]], became one of his flagship products and resistant to turning into goo in hot Japanese weather, unlike caramel formulations that he had seen in the United States.  His formulation was less buttery and appealed better to the Japanese taste.&lt;ref name="IBD" /&gt;

==Legacy==
After the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|Great Kantō earthquake]], Morinaga led the rescue efforts and also distributed sweets to people displaced by the disaster.&lt;ref name=Minato /&gt;
[[File:Kanto-daishinsai.jpg|thumb|right|View of the destruction in Yokohama after the Great Kanto earthquake]]

In 1944, Morinaga's company, with the Army Medical School of Japan, was the first to produce penicillin, an antibiotic drug, in Japan.&lt;ref name='CompanyWebsite' /&gt;

'''''Washington v. United States''''', 584 U.S. ___ (2018), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case regarding Native American fishing rights in the U.S. state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. In the case, the court deadlocked 4-4, with Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] recusing himself due to his prior involvement in the case as a judge on the [[United States Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-269/39869/20180323153617321_Recusal%20Letter%20in%20No.%2017-269.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The deadlock left standing a lower court ruling that the State of Washington must redesign and rebuild road culverts to allow salmon to swim upstream, to uphold Native American treaty rights to fish. The issue decided by the federal courts was whether, under the 1855–1856 [[Stevens Treaties (disambiguation)|Stevens Treaties]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;, "the right to fish is the right to put a net in the water or the right for there to be fish to catch";&lt;ref name=OPB/&gt; however, with the 4-4 Supreme Court decision, it may not be binding on future court decisions.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

The case was argued on April 18, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/washington-v-united-states/ | title=Washington v. United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2017/17-269_o75q.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of [[stream restoration]] demanded by the court decision was estimated to be $3.7 billion,&lt;ref name=Kunkler2018/&gt; making culvert replacement of the top [[List of Seattle megaprojects|megaprojects in the Seattle area]].

The decision was ''[[per curiam]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-269_3eb4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Thomas Appleton''' (1859-1930), was an Australian businessman, shipping agent and public servant. He was born on 2 May 1859 in [[Leeds, Yorkshire]], England. His father, Thomas Appleton was a bookbinder, and his mother was Mary (née Burnley).&lt;ref name="ADB"&gt;[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/appleton-william-thomas-5043/text8399 G. R. Henning, 'Appleton, William Thomas (1859–1930)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 4 April 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1859 the Appleton family visited a maternal uncle (William Burnley) who ran an import-export agency in the [[Port Phillip District]], after which William Appleton returned to England and completed his education at [[Park Lane College Leeds|Wharfdale College]], [[Yorkshire]]. He then returned with his parents to [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] in 1869 settling in [[Geelong]], where he attended the [[Melbourne Grammar School|Melbourne Church of England Grammar School]] in 1872-73.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

He worked with his brother (Colonel) George Burnley Appleton (1850-1945) at his Geelong woolbroking firm. Later he was chairman of Huddart Parker &amp; Co. Pty Ltd. Appleton joined this firm in Geelong c. 1884 becoming Manager in 1887, then moving to the Melbourne office. He joined the Board of Management in 1894 becoming Managing Director in 1898 and Chairman of the Company in 1910-30.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

Whilst on the Harbour Trust, Appleton supported long-term plans for new dock construction. [[Appleton Dock]] on the north side of the [[Yarra River]] was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portofmelbourne.com/community/maritimeheritage/porthistory.aspx Port of Melbourne, Maritime history History of the port]&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War I]] Appleton held a number of temporary official posts. He died of cancer at his home in [[Malvern, Victoria|Malvern]] on 16 February 1930 leaving an estate of £131,323.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

==Career==

When Wong was 26, he became the first Singaporean [[director (business)|director]] at [[Borneo Company Limited]], a British trading company. Wong said his boss told him that a Chinese couldn't get promoted to the company's main board of directors, causing Wong to start his own business.&lt;ref name="still hungry" /&gt;

To start the Wywy Group, Wong got funding from executives of [[Fujifilm]], who had worked with Wong at Borneo. They helped him get a credit line of $178,000 from [[The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ]], which allowed him to start the Wywy Group as a distributor of copy machines.&lt;ref name="still hungry" /&gt;

Wong also served as the Chairman of [[Yeo Hiap Seng]], Singapore's largest drink manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TEA FOR TWO|url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/95/0728/biz1.html|publisher=Asiaweek|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Wong is married and has three grown children.&lt;ref name="directors"&gt;{{cite web|title=Directors|url=http://www.internationalforum.com/Directory%20Links/Directors.htm|publisher=The International Forum|accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wong's oldest son, Dr. Wong Meng Ee, contracted [[retinitis pigmentosa]] when he was 11 years old.&lt;ref name="still hungry" /&gt;  The condition resulted in permanent blindness. Dr. Wong Meng Ee is currently the president of the Retinitis Pigmentosa Society Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://retina-singapore.org/about_us.html|publisher=Retinitis Pigmentosa Society Singapore|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Workers' compensation''' is a form of insurance providing wage replacement and medical benefits to employees injured in the course of employment in exchange for mandatory relinquishment of the employee's right to sue their employer for the [[tort]] of negligence. The trade-off between assured, limited coverage and lack of recourse outside the worker compensation system is known as "the compensation bargain". One of the problems that the compensation bargain solved is the problem of employers becoming insolvent as a result of high damage awards. The system of collective liability was created to prevent that, and thus to ensure security of compensation to the workers. Individual immunity is the necessary corollary to collective liability.

While plans differ among jurisdictions, [[Provision (contracting)|provision]] can be made for weekly payments in place of wages (functioning in this case as a form of [[disability insurance]]), compensation for economic loss (past and future), reimbursement or payment of medical and like expenses (functioning in this case as a form of [[health insurance]]), and benefits payable to the dependents of workers killed during employment.

General damage for [[pain and suffering]], and [[punitive damages]] for employer [[negligence]], are generally not available in workers' compensation plans, and negligence is generally not an issue in the case. These laws were first enacted in Europe and Oceania, with the United States following shortly thereafter.

== Origin and international comparison ==
Laws regarding workers compensation vary by country, but the Workers’ Accident Insurance system put into place by [[Otto von Bismarck]] in 1881 is often cited as a model for Europe and later the United States.&lt;ref name="tradeoff"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insurancejournal.com/blogs/academy-journal/2015/03/19/360273.htm|title=Workers' Compensation History: The Great Tradeoff!|date=2015-03-19|work=Insurance Journal|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statutory no-default compensation ===
Workers' compensation statutes are intended to eliminate the need for litigation and the limitations of common law remedies by having employees give up the potential for pain- and suffering-related awards, in exchange for not being required to prove [[tort]] (legal fault) on the part of their employer. The laws provide employees with monetary awards to cover loss of wages directly related to the accident as well as to compensate for permanent physical impairments and medical expenses.

The laws also provide benefits for dependents of those workers who are killed in work-related accidents or illnesses. Some laws also protect employers and fellow workers by limiting the amount an injured employee can recover from an employer and by eliminating the liability of co-workers in most accidents. US state statutes establish this framework for most employment. US federal statutes are limited to federal employees or to workers employed in some significant aspect of interstate commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/workers_compensation|title=Workers' Compensation|last=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205074742/http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/workers_compensation|archivedate=5 February 2014|deadurl=no|accessdate=7 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exclusive remedy provision states that workers compensation is the sole remedy available to injured workers, thus preventing employees from also making tort liability claims against their employers.

=== Common law remedies ===
In common law nations, the system was motivated by an "unholy trinity" of tort defenses available to employers, including contributory negligence, assumption of risk, and the fellow servant rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haupt|first=Mary Kati|date=2016|title=Workers' Compensation Law &amp; the Remedial Waiver|url=https://lawpublications.barry.edu/barrylrev/vol21/iss2/4/|journal=Barry Law Review|language=en|volume=21|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common law imposes obligations on employers to provide a safe workplace, provide safe tools, give warnings of dangers, provide adequate co-worker assistance (fit, trained, suitable "fellow servants") so that the worker is not overburdened, and promulgate and enforce safe work rules.&lt;ref name="hood"&gt;J. Hood, B. Hardy, and L. Simpson. ''Workers' Compensation and Employee Protection Laws'' (St. Paul: West Academic Publishing, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims under the common law for worker injury are limited by three defenses afforded employers:

* The Fellow Servant Doctrine is that employer can be held harmless to the extent that injury was caused in whole or in part by a peer of the injured worker.
*Contributory negligence allows an employer to be held harmless to the extent that the injured employee failed to use adequate precautions required by ordinary prudence.
*Assumption of risk allows an employer to be held harmless to the extent the injured employee voluntarily accepted the risks associated with the work.&lt;ref name="hood" /&gt;

==By nation==

===Australia===
As Australia experienced a relatively influential [[Australian labour movement|labour movement]] in the late 19th and early 20th century, statutory compensation was implemented very early in Australia. Each territory has its own legislation and its own governing body.

A typical example is  [[WorkSafe Victoria|Work Safe Victoria]], which manages Victoria's workplace safety system. Its responsibilities include helping employees avoid workplace injuries occurring, enforcement of Victoria's occupational and safety laws, provision of reasonably priced workplace injury insurance for employers, assisting injured workers back into the workforce, and managing the workers' compensation scheme by ensuring the prompt delivery of appropriate services and adopting prudent financial practices.&lt;ref&gt;About WorkSafe Victoria – WorkSafe Victoria is the manager of Victoria's workplace safety system.

Broadly, the responsibilities of WorkSafe are the following:
    * help avoid workplace injuries occurring
    * enforce Victoria's occupational health and safety laws
    * provide reasonably priced workplace injury insurance for employers
    * help injured workers back into the workforce
    * manage the workers' compensation scheme by ensuring the prompt delivery of appropriate services and adopting prudent financial practices.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Compensation law in New South Wales has recently (2013) been overhauled by the state government. In a push to speed up the process of claims and to reduce the amount of claims, a threshold of 11% WPI (whole person impairment) was implemented.

Workers' compensation regulators for each of the states and territories are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hcalawyers.com.au/australian-labour-law/ |title=Australian Labour Law |publisher=Henry Carus &amp; Associates |accessdate=8 July 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028052732/http://www.hcalawyers.com.au/australian-labour-law/ |archivedate=28 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
The National Social Insurance Institute (in Portuguese, Instituto Nacional do Seguro Social – INSS) provides insurance for those who contribute. It is a public institution that aims to recognize and grant rights to its policyholders. The amount transferred by the INSS is used to replace the income of the worker taxpayer, when he or she loses the ability to work, due to sickness, disability, age, death, [[involuntary unemployment]], or even pregnancy and imprisonment. During the first 15 days the worker's salary is paid by the employer and after that by the INSS, as long as the inability to work lasts. Although the worker's income is guaranteed by the INSS, the employer is still responsible for any loss of working capacity, temporary or permanent, when found negligent or when its economic activity involves risk of accidents or developing labour related diseases.

===Canada===
Workers' compensation was Canada's first social program to be introduced as it was favoured by both workers' groups and employers hoping to avoid lawsuits. The system arose after an inquiry by Ontario Chief Justice [[William Ralph Meredith|William Meredith]] who outlined a system in which workers were to be compensated for workplace injuries, but must give up their right to sue their employers. It was introduced in the various provinces at different dates. Ontario was first in 1915, Manitoba in 1916, and British Columbia in 1917. It remains a provincial responsibility and thus the rules vary from province to province. In some provinces, such as Ontario's [[Workplace Safety and Insurance Board]], the program also has a preventative role ensuring workplace safety. In British Columbia, the occupational health and safety mandate (including the powers to make regulation, inspect and assess administrative penalties) is legislatively assigned to the Workers' Compensation Board of British Columbia [[WorkSafeBC]]. In most provinces the workers' compensation board or commission remains concerned solely with insurance. The workers' compensation insurance system in every province is funded by employers based on their payroll, industry sector and history of injuries (or lack thereof) in their workplace  (usually referred to as "experience rating").

The law paid indemnity to all private wage earners and apprentices, including those who work in the agricultural and horticultural sectors and marine industries, family helpers and students with work-related injuries, for up to 13 weeks. Workers who are totally disabled get continued benefits at 67 percent after 13 weeks, paid by the accident funds, financed entirely by employers.

The German compensation system has been taken as a model for many nations.

=== India ===

The [http://labour.gov.in/sites/default/files/TheWorkmenAct1923(1).pdf Indian worker's compensation law 1923] was introduced on 5 March 1923. It includes Employer's liability compensation, amount of compensation.  Workmen Compensation Insurance covers employees under Workmen Compensation Act, Fatal Accident Act and common law.

Adopted before Malaysia's independence from the UK, it is now used only by non-Malaysian workers, since citizens are covered by the national social security scheme.

===Mexico===
{{main|Worker's compensation (Mexico)}}
The Mexican Constitution of 1917 defined the obligation of employers to pay for illnesses or accidents related to the workplace. It also defined social security as the institution to administer the right of workers, but only until 1943 was the Mexican Social Security Institute created ([http://www.imss.gob.mx/ IMSS]). Since then, IMSS manages the Work Risks Insurance in a vertically integrated fashion: registration of workers and firms, collection, classification of risks and events, and medical and rehabilitation services. A reform in 1997 defined that contributions are related to the experience of each employer. Public sector workers are covered by social security agencies with corporate and operative structures similar to those of IMSS.

=== New Zealand ===
In [[New Zealand]], all companies that employ staff and in some cases others, must pay a levy to the [[Accident Compensation Corporation]], a [[Crown entity]], which administers New Zealand's universal [[No-fault insurance|no-fault]] accidental injury scheme. The scheme provides financial compensation and support to citizens, residents, and temporary visitors who have suffered personal injuries.

===United Kingdom===
Great Britain followed the German model. [[Joseph Chamberlain]], leader of the Liberal Unionist party and coalition with the Conservatives, designed a plan that was enacted under the Salisbury government in 1897. the [[Workmen's Compensation Act 1897]] was a key domestic achievement. It served its social purpose at no cost to the government, since compensation was paid for by insurance which employers were required to take out. The system operated from 1897 to 1946.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Hanes, ''The First British Workmen's Compensation Act of 1897'' (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; It was expanded to include industrial diseases by the [[Workmen's Compensation Act 1906]] and replaced by a state compensation scheme under the [[National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1946]]. Since 1976, this state scheme has been set out in the UK's Social Security Acts.&lt;ref&gt;Peter W.J. Bartrip, ''Workmen's Compensation in Twentieth Century Britain: Law, History, and Social Policy'' (Gower, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

Work related safety issues in the UK are supervised by the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) who provide the framework by which employers and employees are able to comply with statutory rules and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/|title=HSE: Information about health and safety at work|author=|date=|website=www.hse.gov.uk|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318033425/http://www.hse.gov.uk/|archivedate=18 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of the following, all employers are obliged to purchase compulsory Employer's Liability Insurance in accordance with the Employer's Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969. The current minimum limit of indemnity required is £5,000,000 per occurrence. Market practice is to usually provide a minimum £10,000,000 with inner limits to £5,000,000 for certain risks, e.g. workers on oil rigs and acts of terrorism.

These employers do not require Employer's Liability Insurance:
* local authorities (other than [[Civil parish|parish councils]])
* joint boards or committees whose members include members of local authorities
* police authorities
* nationalised industries or their subsidiaries
* certain bodies which are financed out of public funds
* employers of crews on offshore installations, ships or hovercraft, if they are covered instead with a mutual insurance association of ship owners or ship owners and others
* a health service body or NHS Trust&lt;ref&gt;Industrial engineering projects: practice and procedures for capital, By Joint Development Board (Great Britain), pp. 142–43 [https://books.google.com/books?id=7K8pSs_Y8WAC&amp;lpg=PA142dq=Employers%20who%20do%20not%20require%20Employers%20Liability%20Compulsory%20Insurance%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom&amp;pg=PA142#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false books.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Employees" are defined as anyone who has entered into or works under a contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer. The contract may be for manual labour, clerical work or otherwise, it may be written or verbal and it may be for full-time or part-time work.

These persons are not classed as employees and, therefore, are exempt:
* persons who are not employees (for example independent contractors who are not the employees of the person engaging them)
* people employed in any activity which is not a business (such as domestic servants)
* people who are related to the employer – husband, wife, father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, stepfather, stepmother, son, daughter, grandson, granddaughter, stepson, stepdaughter, brother sister, half-brother or half-sister
* people who are not normally resident in the United Kingdom and who are working there for fewer than 14 consecutive days.

Employees need to establish that their employer has a legal liability to pay compensation. This will principally be a breach of a statutory duty or under the tort of negligence. In the event that the employer is insolvent or no longer in existence, compensation can be sought directly from the insurer under the terms of the Third Parties (Rights against Insurers) Act 2010.

For the history of worker's compensation in the UK, see [[Workmen's Compensation Act 1897]] and following acts.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrip, ''Workmen's Compensation in Twentieth Century Britain: Law, History, and Social Policy'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, some form of workers compensation is typically compulsory in most states (depending upon the features of the organization), with the notable exception of [[Texas]] as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.employers.com/resources/blog/2014/is-workers-compensation-insurance-required-in-all-states|title=Is Workers Compensation Insurance Required in all states|last=|first=|date=|website=www.employers.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181124214945/https://www.employers.com/resources/blog/2014/is-workers-compensation-insurance-required-in-all-states|archive-date=2018-11-24|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of compulsory requirements, businesses may purchase insurance voluntarily, and in the United States policies typically include Part One for compulsory coverage and Part Two for non-compulsory coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irmi.com/term/insurance-definitions/workers-compensation-and-employers-liability-policy|title=Workers Compensation and Employers Liability Policy {{!}} Insurance Glossary Definition {{!}} IRMI.com|website=www.irmi.com|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1949, every state had enacted a workers' compensation program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://eh.net/encyclopedia/workers-compensation/ eh.net Fishback] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619023347/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/workers-compensation/ |date=19 June 2017 }} Includes extended data tables.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most states, workers compensation claims are handled by [[Administrative law judge|administrative law judges]], who often act as [[Trier of fact|triers of fact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=B.|first=Torrey, David|date=2012|title=Master or Chancellor?

Workers compensation statutes which emerged in the early 1900s were struck down as unconstitutional until 1911 when Wisconsin passed a law was not struck down; by 1920, 42 states had passed workers compensation laws.&lt;ref name="tradeoff"/&gt;
