'''Amanayé''' (Amanaje) is a possibly extinct [[Tupian languages|Tupi]] language last spoken in the town of São Domingos on the Capim River in [[Pará State]], Brazil. The closely related but possibly distinct language is Ararandewara, which is spoken at the headwaters of the Moju River (Lang 1914).

'''{{lang|de|Arbeit macht frei}}''' ({{IPA-de|ˈaɐ̯baɪt ˈmaxt ˈfʁaɪ||De-Arbeit macht frei.ogg}}) is a German phrase meaning "work sets you free". The slogan is known for appearing on the entrance of [[Auschwitz]] and other [[Nazi concentration camps]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopedia of the Holocaust]]'', [[Yad Vashem]],  1990, vol. 4, p. 1751.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The expression comes from the title of an 1873 novel by German [[Philology|philologist]] [[Lorenz Diefenbach]], {{lang|de|Arbeit macht frei: Erzählung von Lorenz Diefenbach}}, in which gamblers and fraudsters find the path to virtue through labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/18/auschwitz-arbeit-macht-frei-sign|title=Poland declares state of emergency after 'Arbeit Macht Frei' stolen from Auschwitz|last=Connolly|first=Kate|date=2009-12-18|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4tlbAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=diefenbach+arbeit+macht+frei&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjr9Jni0-TdAhVB7qwKHdGyD3gQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=diefenbach%20arbeit%20macht%20frei&amp;f=false|title=Arbeit macht frei: Erzählung von Lorenz Diefenbach|last=Diefenbach|first=Lorenz|date=1873|publisher=J. Kühtmann's Buchhandlung|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was also used in French ({{lang|fr|le travail rend libre!}})  by [[Auguste Forel]], a Swiss entomologist, neuroanatomist and psychiatrist, in his {{lang|fr|Fourmis de la Suisse}} (''English'': "Ants of Switzerland") (1920).&lt;ref name="Fourmis de la Suisse"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/lesfourmisdelasu00fore#page/n7/mode/2up |title=Les fourmis de la Suisse (2nd Ed.) |first=Auguste |last=Forel |authorlink=Auguste Forel|location=La Chaux-de-Fonds |publisher=Imprimarie cooperative |year=1920 |language=French |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, the {{lang|de|Deutsche Schulverein}} of Vienna, an ethnic nationalist "protective" organization of Germans within the Austrian empire, printed membership stamps with the phrase {{lang|de|Arbeit macht frei}}.

[[File:Arbeit Macht Frei Dachau 20180125-PR6A9314.jpg|thumb|[[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]]]
The slogan {{Lang|de|Arbeit macht frei}} was placed at the entrances to a number of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]]s. The slogan's use was implemented by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer [[Theodor Eicke]] at [[Dachau concentration camp]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOD9ncsixssC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=arbeit+macht+frei+%22eicke%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc2bjf2uTdAhUITKwKHRNGCUEQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=arbeit%20macht%20frei%20%22eicke%22&amp;f=false|title=Legacies of Dachau: The Uses and Abuses of a Concentration Camp, 1933-2001|last=Marcuse|first=Harold|date=2001-03-22|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521552042|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then copied by [[Rudolf Höss]] at Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/auschwitz/40-45/beginnings/|title=Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State . Auschwitz 1940-1945 . Surprising Beginnings {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slogan can still be seen at several sites, including over the entrance to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz I]] where the sign was erected by order of commandant [[Rudolf Höss]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Laurence Rees]], ''Auschwitz: a New History''&lt;/ref&gt;{{fact|date=October 2018}} The Auschwitz I sign was made by prisoner-labourers including master [[blacksmith]] [[Jan Liwacz]], and features an upside-down ''B'', which has been interpreted as an act of defiance by the prisoners who made it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auschwitz's sign of death and defiance|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8420681.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=B - the sculpture|url=http://www.auschwitz.info/en/b-the-sculpture.html| website=International Auschwitz Committee| accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 the first political prisoners were being rounded up for an indefinite period without charges. They were held in a number of places in Germany. The slogan was first used over the gate of a "wild camp" in the city of [[Oranienburg concentration camp|Oranienburg]], which was set up in an abandoned brewery in March 1933 (it was later rebuilt in 1936 as [[Sachsenhausen (detention camp)|Sachsenhausen]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} It can also be seen at the Dachau, [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp|Gross-Rosen]], and [[Concentration camp Theresienstadt|Theresienstadt]] camps, as well as at [[Fort Breendonk]] in [[Belgium]]. It has been claimed that the slogan was placed over the entrance gates of the [[Monowitz concentration camp|Monowitz]] camp (also known as Auschwitz III).&lt;ref&gt;Denis Avey with Rob Broomby ''The Man who Broke into Auschwitz'', Hodder and Stoughton, London, 2011 p.236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freddie Knoller with Robert Landaw ''Desperate Journey: Vienna-Paris-Auschwitz'', Metro, London, 2002, {{ISBN|978-184-358028-7}} p.158&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan appeared at the [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenbürg]] camp on the left gate post at the camp entry. The original gate posts survive in another part of the camp, but the slogan sign no longer exists.&lt;ref&gt;KZ-Gedenkstaette Flossenbuerg&lt;/ref&gt; [[Primo Levi]] describes seeing the words illuminated over a doorway (as distinct from a gate) at Monowitz.&lt;ref&gt;[[Primo Levi|Levi, Primo]], trans. Stuart Woolf, ''[[If This is a Man]]''. Abacus, London, 2004, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 the [[Austria]]n political [[cabaret]] writer [[Jura Soyfer]] and the [[composer]] [[Herbert Zipper]], while prisoners at [[Dachau Concentration Camp]], wrote the ''[[Dachaulied]]'', or ''The'' ''Dachau'' ''Song''. They had spent weeks marching in and out of the camp's gate to daily [[forced labour]], and considered the motto {{Lang|De|Arbeit macht frei}} over the gate an insult.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The song repeats the phrase cynically as a "lesson" taught by Dachau.

In ''The Kingdom of Auschwitz'', [[Otto Friedrich]] wrote about [[Rudolf Höss]], regarding his decision to display the motto so prominently at the Auschwitz entrance:

{{quote|He seems not to have intended it as a mockery, nor even to have intended it literally, as a false promise that those who worked to exhaustion would eventually be released, but rather as a kind of mystical declaration that self-sacrifice in the form of endless labour does in itself bring a kind of spiritual freedom.&lt;ref name=Friedrich&gt;{{cite book |last= Friedrich |first= Otto |title= The Kingdom of Auschwitz |publisher= [[Harper Perennial]] |date=August 1994 |isbn= 978-0-06-097640-8 |pages= 2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The signs are prominently displayed, and were seen by all prisoners and staff&amp;mdash;all of whom 
knew, suspected, or quickly learned that prisoners confined there would likely only be freed by death. The signs' psychological impact was tremendous.&lt;ref name=Friedrich/&gt;

==Thefts of {{Lang|De|Arbeit Macht Frei}} signs==
The {{Lang|De|Arbeit Macht Frei}} sign over the Auschwitz I gate was stolen in December 2009 and later recovered by authorities in three pieces. Anders Högström, a Swedish former neo-Nazi, and two Polish men were jailed as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/former-neo-nazi-jailed-for-auschwitz-sign-theft-2172533.html|title=Former neo-Nazi jailed for Auschwitz sign theft|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original sign is now in storage at the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]] and a replica was put over the gate in its place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12094855 | publisher=BBC News | title=Auschwitz sign theft: Swedish man jailed | date=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 November 2014, the sign over the Dachau gate was stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29878278 | publisher=BBC News | title=Dachau infamous Nazi concentration camp gate stolen | date=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found on 28 November 2016 under a tarpaulin at a parking lot in [[Ytre Arna]], a settlement north of [[Bergen]], Norway's second-largest city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/i/XyLgo/stjaalet-arbeit-macht-frei-port-funnet-i-bergen|title=Stjålet «Arbeit macht frei»-port funnet i Bergen|access-date=2018-10-01|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/221193|title='No usable evidence' in investigation into stolen Dachau sign|website=Israel National News|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Austrian Sign Language''', or ''Österreichische Gebärdensprache'' (ÖGS), is the [[sign language]] used by the [[Austria]]n [[Deaf]] community—approximately 10,000 people (see Krausneker 2006).

== Classification ==

ÖGS and [[Hungarian Sign Language]] seem to be related for historical reasons (First School for the Deaf in Vienna), but forms a cluster with neighboring languages rather than with ÖGS.&lt;ref&gt;Bickford, 2005. [http://www.sil.org/silesr/2005/silesr2005-026.pdf ''The Signed Languages of Eastern Europe'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Although there are no detailed studies of the extent of relatedness, ÖGS shares aspects of its [[grammar]] with [[German Sign Language]] and [[Swiss Sign Language]], while the [[vocabulary]] differs (see Skant et al. 2002); {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Wittmann (1991) places it in the [[French Sign Language family]]).

==Research==

Linguistic research on ÖGS started in the 1990s and is primarily conducted at the [[University of Klagenfurt]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-klu.ac.at/fzgs/ Forschungszentrum für Gebärdensprache und Hörgeschädigtenkommunikation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060809023654/http://www.uni-klu.ac.at/fzgs/ |date=August 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[University of Graz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-gewi.uni-graz.at/uedo/signhome/index.html Arbeitsgruppe für Gebärdensprache&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317163426/http://www-gewi.uni-graz.at/uedo/signhome/index.html |date=March 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a 15-year effort by the Deaf community, ÖGS was [[Legal recognition of sign languages|legally recognized]] by the [[Austrian Parliament]] on September 1, 2005.

==Associations==
The Austrian Deaf community is represented by the Austrian Federation of the Deaf (the ''Österreichischer Gehörlosenbund'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oeglb.at ÖGLB | Österreichischer Gehörlosenbund&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Balraj Pandit''' was a well-known Hindi and Punjabi playwright besides being a theatre director, poet, painter and a popular teacher. His ''Paanchwan Sawaar'' (पांचवा सवार) is considered a classic and a significant play of Indian dramaturgy. The play has been staged many times by different theatre troupes with actors like [[Naseeruddin Shah]], [[Om Puri]] and [[Manohar Singh]] among other playing roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20061214/cth2.htm | title = ‘Panchwan Sawar’ staged | publisher = The Tribune | date = 2006-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lok Udaasi'' (ਲੋਕ ਉਦਾਸੀ) in Punjabi was another of his well-known plays besides ''Biwiyon Ka Madrasa'', an adaptation of [[Molière]]'s ''[[L'École des Femmes]]'' (''The School for Wives'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://journojp.blogspot.in/2006/10/balraj-pandit-no-more.html | title = Balraj Pandit No More | author = Jatinder Preet | publisher = Slow Life | date = 2006-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Panditji, as he was fondly called, graduated from [[National School of Drama]], [[New Delhi]] in 1969. He studied theatre under such stalwarts as [[Ebrahim Alkazi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://nsd.gov.in/alumni2.asp?id=1969 | title = Alumni | publisher = National School of Drama | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131201063711/http://nsd.gov.in/alumni2.asp?id=1969 | archivedate = 2013-12-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then after a short stint of teaching in NSD he joined Theatre and Television Department at [[Punjabi University]] in Patiala. He taught generations of students there till his retirement.

He lived at [[Patiala]] in Punjab until he died on 13 October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20061020/ttlife1.htm | title = Fond memories mark Balraj Pandit’s exit| author = Anuradha Shukla | publisher = The Tribune | date = 2006-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bimal Kar''' ({{lang-bn|বিমল কর}})(19 September 1921 — 26 August 2003) was an eminent [[Bengali language|Bengali]] writer and novelist.

He received 1975 [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] in [[Sahitya Akademi Award to Bengali Writers|Bengali]], by [[Sahitya Akademi]], India's National Academy of Letters, for his novel ''Asamay''.

==Personal life and education==
Bimal Kar was born in North 24-Parganas, on 19 September 1921. Bimal Kar had gone by of Bihar like Jabalpur, Hazaribagh, Gomoh and Dhanbad. He died on 26 August 2003.&lt;ref name="telegraphindia.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/bimal-kar-dead/cid/808759|newspaper=The Telegraph|location=Calcutta | title=Bimal Kar dead | date=26 August 2003 | accessdate=11 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bimal Kar has written many Bengali classics. He also wrote dramas depicting society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/charming-tales/article2269352.ece | title=Charming tales | date=15 June 2007 | newspaper=The Hindu | first=Antara | last=Das | accessdate=11 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The special ability of Kar was that he had many completely different narration styles. For example, he has written superb stories without any dialogue, and he has also written noteworthy ones almost entirely comprising dialogue. His mastery of the Western Bengal and Chhota Nagpur locales matched well his in-depth association with modern Calcutta. Another special strength was his willingness to think when necessary like a woman.

He was involved in myriad professions that later helped him write on varied subjects. His writings reflect a modern mind and have inspired many young writers whom he also supported at the start of their literary careers.

For children, He created the retired magician Kinkar Kishore Ray, alias [[Kikira]] who solved mysteries with his two assistants. He created another detective character called Victor.

After moving to Kolkata, Bimal Kar worked as a journalist with Parag, Paschimbanga and Satyajug.&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata-/Writer-Bimal-Kar-dead/articleshow/147534.cms | title=Writer Bimal Kar dead | date=26 August 2003 | newspaper=The Times of India | accessdate=11 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1954 to 1982, he was associated with Desh where his novel Grahan was published in 1964. Asamay, also published in Desh, won him the Sahitya Akademi award in 1975. Kar won the Ananda Puraskar in 1967 and the Saratchandra Award from Calcutta University in 1981, among other honours.

Apart from Desh, the other magazines he was associated with were Shiladitya and Galpapatro.&lt;ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"/&gt;

Kar’s other works include novels like Dewal, Purna Apurna, Jadubansa and Balika Badhu. He introduced a new trend in Bengali short stories with his lucid language. He could win over the heart of the average reader of Bengali literature with his ability to craft characters and the fine art of storytelling. Many of his novels were made into films.&lt;ref name="telegraphindia.com" /&gt;

'''Carib''' or '''Kari'nja''' is a [[Cariban language]] spoken by the [[Kalina people]] (Caribs) of South America. It is spoken by around 7,400 people mostly in [[Venezuela]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]],&lt;ref&gt;Alain Fabre, Diccionario etnolingüístico y guía bibliográfica de los pueblos indígenas sudamericanos. ARAWAK, p.62&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[French Guiana]], and [[Brazil]]. The language is currently classified as ''highly endangered''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Names==
The language is known by several names to both its speakers and outsiders. Traditionally it has been known as "Carib" or "Carib proper" in English, after its speakers, called the "Caribs" in English. It is known ''Caribe'' in Spanish, ''Galina'' in French, and ''Karaïeb'' in Dutch. However, the speakers call themselves ''Kalina'' or ''Karìna'' (variously spelled), and call their language ''Karìna auran'' {{ipa|[kaɽiɁnʲauɽaŋ]}}.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book |last= Courtz |first= Henk |date= 2008 |title=A Carib Grammar and Dictionary |url= https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/12578/Thesis.pdf?sequence=1 |location= |publisher= Magoria Books |page= 1|isbn= 0978170768 |accessdate= May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other variants include ''Kali'na'', ''Kari'nja, Cariña'', ''Kariña'', ''Kalihna'', ''Kalinya''; other native names include ''Maraworno'' and ''Marworno''.

== Classification ==
Kari'nja is classified as part of the [[Cariban language]]s but also as a Guianan language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/2114|title=Did you know Kari'nja is threatened?|website=Endangered Languages|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographic distribution ==
Due to contact with Kari'nja invaders, some languages have Kari'nja words incorporated into them, despite being [[Arawakan languages]] linguistically.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/4452/1/05gildeaetal.pdf|title=The Story of *ô in the Cariban Family|last=Gildea|first=Spike|date=May 2010|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Suriname, there is an area called Konomerume which is located near the Wajambo River. With about 349 people living there, a majority identify as ethnically Kari'nja and as for who knows the language, the adults are reported to at least have a decent knowledge of it. Those above the age of 65 use the language as a primary language among the members of the community. Speakers between the ages of 45 and 65 tend to use the language only when speaking with older residents or elder members of their family, while for the most part using the official languages: [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Sranan Tongo]]. Younger adults between the ages of 20 to 40 for the most part understand the language but do not speak it, and children learn bits about Kari'nja in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/24611/1/yamada.pdf|title=Training in the Community-Collaborative Context: A Case Study|last=Yamada|first=Racquel-María|date=2014|website=|publisher=University of Oklahoma|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialects===
Carib dialects (with number of speakers indicated in parentheses):&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
*Venezuelan Carib (1000)
*Guyanese Carib (2000)
*Western Surinamese Carib (500)
*Eastern Surinamese and French Guianese Carib (3000)
**Suriname has two dialects of Kari'nja: ''Aretyry'' which is spoken in the west and central parts of the country, and ''Tyrewuju'' which is what the majority of Kari'nja speakers in Suriname use.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E3WjBQAAQBAJ|title=In and Out of Suriname: Language, Mobility and Identity|last=Carlin|first=Eithne B.|last2=Léglise|first2=Isabelle|last3=Migge|first3=Bettina|last4=Fat|first4=Paul B. Tjon Sie|date=2014-11-28|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004280120|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alphabet==
The Carib alphabet consists of 15 letters: [[a]], [[e]], [[i]], [[j]], [[k]], [[`]], [[m]], [[n]], [[o]], [[p]], [[r]], [[s]], [[t]], [[u]], [[w]], [[y]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Phonology ==
In the Kari'nja language, there are four syllable patterns: V, CV, VC, CVC; C standing for consonants while V means a vowel. Regarding phonemes, consonants are divided into two groups: obstruents (voiceless stops—p, t, k) and resonants (voiced stops—b, d, g, s).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/system/files/reapdata/85/19/13/85191306364792724967627267385868167068/11889.pdf|title=Languages of the Guianas|last=Grimes|first=Joseph|date=1972|website=|publisher=Benjamin F. Elson|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kari'nja has a typical 6 vowel system after *ô merged with *o, being ''a e i o u ï.'' Compared to past Kari'nja, the modern day Kari'nja has replaced the ''e'' in many words to ''o''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Grammar ===
There are 17 particles within Kari'nja which include the ''ky-'' prefix and the ''-ng'' suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yamada|first=Racquel-María|date=2011-01-01|title=A New Approach to ky- and -ng in Kari'nja: Evidentiality or Something Else?|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/657328|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=77|issue=1|pages=59–89|doi=10.1086/657328|issn=0020-7071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allophones for /r w t/ include sounds as /ɽ β,v tʃ/. /s/ before /i/ may be pronounced as /ʃ/. /n/ before a consonant may be pronounced as /ŋ/ and also /ɲ/ elsewhere. Another sound, ranging /h~x/, often occurs before a voiced or voiceless consonant, and succeeding a vowel, it can also be an allophone of /ʔ/.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Vocabulary ==
All four dialects of Kari'nja have loan words from the primary language of the area (Brazil, Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana). For example, the Kari'nja spoken in Suriname borrows words from Dutch and Sranantongo.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''charnel ground''' (Devanagari:  श्मशान; Romanized Sanskrit: śmaśān; Tibetan pronunciation: durtrö; {{bo|t=དུར་ཁྲོད|w=dur khrod}}),&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"&gt;Rigpa Shedra (July 2009). 'Charnel ground'. Source: [http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Charnel_ground] (accessed: Saturday December 19, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; in concrete terms, is an above-ground site for the putrefaction of bodies, generally human, where formerly living tissue is left to decompose uncovered.  Although it may have demarcated locations within it functionally identified as burial grounds, [[cemetery|cemeteries]] and [[crematorium|crematoria]], it is distinct from these as well as from [[crypt]]s or [[Burial vault (tomb)|burial vault]]s.

In a religious sense, it is also a very important location for [[sadhana]] and ritual activity for Indo-Tibetan traditions of [[Dharma]] particularly those traditions iterated by the [[Tantra|Tantric]] view such as [[Kashmiri Shaivism]], [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]] tradition, [[Esoteric Buddhism]], [[Vajrayana]], [[Mantrayana]], [[Dzogchen]], and the [[sadhana]] of [[Chöd]], [[Phowa]] and [[Zhitro]], etc. The charnel ground is also an archetypal [[liminality]] that figures prominently in the literature and liturgy and as an artistic motif in Dharmic Traditions and cultures iterated by the more [[antinomian]] and esoteric aspects of traditional Indian culture.

==India==
Throughout [[History of India|Ancient India]] and [[Medieval India]], charnel grounds in the form of open air [[crematoria]] were historically often located along rivers and many ancient famous charnel sites are now 'sanitized' pilgrimage sites (Sanskrit: [[Tirtha (Hinduism)|tirtha]]) and areas of significant domestic income through cultural tourism. However, proper "charnel grounds" can still be found in India, specially near large rivers banks and areas where abandoned people (without family) are cremated or simply left to decompose. These areas are often frequented by [[Aghori]]s, a [[Kapalika]] sect, that follows similar meditation techniques, as those thought by the 84 [[Mahasiddha]]s. A typical Aghori sadhana (at the charnel ground) lasts for 12 years.

==Himalayan 'sky burial'==
In the [[Himalaya]] where tillable topsoil for burial and fuel for cremation is scarce and a valuable commodity, the location of a so-called [[sky burial]] is identified with a charnel ground.&lt;ref name="Gold, Peter 1994 p.141"&gt;Gold, Peter (1994). ''Navajo and Tibetan Sacred Wisdom:  The Circle of the Spirit'' (Paperback). Inner Traditions.  {{ISBN|0-89281-411-X}}, {{ISBN|978-0-89281-411-4}}, p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sutrayana and Early Buddhism==
In the [[Pali Canon]] discourses, the Buddha frequently instructs his disciples to seek out a secluded dwelling (in a forest, under the shade of a tree, mountain, glen, hillside cave, charnel ground, jungle grove, in the open, or on a heap of straw).&lt;ref&gt;In these suttas, the Buddha instructs monks to stay in the forest in order to aid their meditation practice DN 2,DN 11,DN 12,DN 16,  MN 4,MN 10, MN 27,MN 39,MN 60,MN 66,MN 101, MN 105, MN 107, MN 125, AN 4.259, AN 5.75, AN 5.76, AN 5.114, AN 10.60, Sn 1.12, Sn 3.11, SN 11.3, SN 22.80, This list is not exhaustive as there are many more related suttas.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Sutrayana]] tradition of the 'Nine Cemetery Contemplations' (Pali: nava sīvathikā-manasikāra) of the ''[[Satipatthana Sutta]]'' demonstrate that charnel ground meditations were part of [[Early Buddhism]].

'Cemetery contemplations', as described in ''[[Mahasatipatthana Sutta]]'' ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]]: 22)  and the ''[[Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta]]'' ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]]: 10):

{{Quote|...have as their objects a corpse one or two or three days old, swollen up, blue-black in colour, full of corruption; a corpse eaten by crows, etc.; a framework of bones; flesh hanging from it, bespattered with blood, held together by the sinews; without flesh and blood, but still held together by the sinews; bones scattered in all direction; bleached and resembling shells; heaped together after the lapse of years; weathered and crumbled to dust.

At the end of each of these contemplations there follows the conclusion: "This body of mine also has this nature, has this destiny, cannot escape it.

Similar are the 10 objects of loathsomeness (asubha q.v.).|&lt;ref&gt;Nyanatiloka (1980). ''Buddhist Dictionary: Manual of Buddhist Terms and Doctrines.'' Fourth Revised Edition edited by Nyanaponika. Kandy, Sri Lanka: Buddhist Publication Society.

==Polysemy and metaphor==
{{cleanup|section|date=March 2012}}
On the face of it or alternatively the cosmetic level, the charnel ground is simply a locality often [[chthonic]] where bodies are disposed of, either by [[cremation]] or [[burial]].&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"/&gt;  Though the charnel ground is to be understood as a polysemy and metaphor it must be emphasized that holy people as part of their sadhana and natural spiritual evolution grappling with death, impermanence and transition did historically in both India, China and Tibet as well as in other localities, frequent charnel grounds, crematoriums and cemeteries and were often feared and despised by people who did not understand their 'proclivities' (Sanskrit: anusaya).

From a deeper structural significance and getting to the substantive bones of the Vajrayana spiritual point of view however, the charnel ground is full of profound [[Transpersonal psychology|transpersonal]] significance. It represents the 'death of [[Ego (religion)|ego]]' (Sanskrit: atmayajna), and the end of: 
*'''attachment''' (Sanskrit: ''[[Upādāna]]''; Tibetan: ''[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/len_pa len pa]'') to this body and life
*'''craving''' (Sanskrit: ''[[tṛṣṇā|{{IAST|Tṛṣṇā}}]]''; Tibetan: ''[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/sred_pa sred pa]'') for a body and life in the future
*'''fear of death''' (Sanskrit: abhiniveśa)
*'''aversion''' (Sanskrit: dveṣa; Wylie: zhe sdang)  to the decay of 'impermanence' (Sanskrit: [[anitya]]).&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"/&gt;
It is worth noting that 'attachment', 'craving', 'fear' and 'aversion' above cited in bold font are somewhat standardized and hence less-rich lexical choices for the [[semantic field]] represented by the four of the 'Five Poisons' (Sanskrit: pancha [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|klesha]]) they denote.

Prior to spiritual realization, charnel grounds are to be understood as terrifying places, full of 'roaming spirits' (Sanskrit: [[gana]]) and '[[hungry ghosts]]' (Sanskrit: [[pretas]]) indeed localities that incite consuming fear. In a charnel ground there are bodies everywhere in different states of decomposition: freshly dead bodies, decaying bodies, skeletons and disembodied bones.&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"/&gt;

[[Judith Simmer-Brown|Simmer-Brown]] (2001: p.&amp;nbsp;127) conveys how the 'charnel ground' experience may present itself in the modern Western [[mindstream]] situations of emotional intensity, protracted peak performance, marginalization and extreme desperation:

{{quote|In contemporary Western society, the charnel ground might be a prison, a homeless shelter, the welfare roll, or a factory assembly line. The key to its successful support of practice is its desperate, hopeless, or terrifying quality. For that matter, there are environments that appear prosperous and privileged to others but are charnel grounds for their inhabitants--Hollywood, Madison Avenue, Wall Street, Washington, D.C. These are worlds in which extreme competitiveness, speed, and power rule, and the actors in their dramas experience intense emotion, ambition, and fear. The intensity of their dynamics makes all of these situations ripe for the Vajrayana practice of the charnel ground.|&lt;ref name="Simmer-Brown 2001 p.127"&gt;[[Judith Simmer-Brown|Simmer-Brown, Judith]] (2001). ''Dakini's warm breath: the feminine principle in Tibetan Buddhism''. Boston, Massachusetts, USA: Shambhala Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-57062-920-4}} (paperback), p.127&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Denizens and pastimes of the charnel ground==
*[[Shiva]] as [[Bhairava]]
*'Outcastes' (Sanskrit: [[Chandala]]) literally cast out from the castes, outside the [[Varnashrama Dharma]] of the ''[[status quo]]''.

===Dancing===
[[File:GanpatiTibetan.jpg|thumb|left|Ganapati, Maha Rakta]]
Tibetan representations of Ganesha show ambivalent or richly different depictions of him.&lt;ref name="Nagar, p. 185"&gt;Nagar, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; In one Tibetan form he is shown being trodden under foot by [[Mahakala|Mahākala]], a popular Tibetan deity.&lt;ref name="Nagar, p. 185"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Getty, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  Other depictions show him as the Destroyer of Obstacles, sometimes dancing.&lt;ref&gt;Nagar, pp. 185-186.&lt;/ref&gt; This play of Ganesha as both the "creator and remover of obstacles" as per his [[epithet]] as well in the two Vajrayana iconographic depictions of him as that which consumes (Maha Rakta) and that which is consumed (danced upon by Vignantaka) is key to the reciprocity rites of the charnel ground.

''Ganapati, Maha Rakta'' (Tibetan: tsog gi dag po, mar chen. English: The Great Red Lord of Hosts or [[Gana]]s) is a Tantric Buddhist form of Ganapati ([[Ganesha]]) related to the [[Chakrasamvara]] Cycle of Tantras. The Sanskrit term 'rakta' holds the [[semantic field]] of "blood" and "red''. This form of Ganapati is regarded as an emanation of [[Avalokiteshvara]].

"...beside a lapis lazuli rock mountain is a red lotus with eight petals, in the middle a blue rat expelling various jewels, [mounted on his rat 'steed' (Sanskrit: [[vahana]])] Shri Ganapati with a body red in colour, having an elephant face with sharp white tusks and possessing three eyes, black hair tied in a [[Sikha|topknot]] with a [[cintamani|wishing-gem]] and a red silk ribbon [all] in a bundle on the crown of the head. With twelve hands, the six right hold an axe, [[arrow]], [[ankus|hook]], [[vajra]], sword and spear. The six left [hold] a [[pestle]], bow, [[khatvanga]], [[skullcup]] filled with blood, skullcup filled with human flesh and a shield together with a spear and [[dhvaja|banner]]. The peaceful right and left hands are signified by the vajra and skullcup filled with blood held to the heart. The remaining hands are displayed in a threatening manner. Wearing various silks as a lower garment and adorned with a variety of jewel ornaments, the left foot is extended in a dancing manner, standing in the middle of the bright rays of red flickering light." ([[Ngorchen Konchog Lhundrup]], 1497-1557).&lt;ref&gt;A Gift of Dharma to Kublai Khan By Chogyal Phagpa, Seventh Patriarch of Sakya. Ngorchen Konchog Lhundup, Ngor chos 'byung, folia 323?328. Translated by Jared Rhoton, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vignataka.jpg|thumb|right|Vignantaka trampling or dancing upon Vinayaka]]
This form of Ganapati belongs to a set of three powerful deities known as the 'mar chen kor sum' or the Three Great Red Deities included in a larger set called 'The Thirteen Golden Dharmas' of [[Sakya]]. The other two deities are Kurukulle and Takkiraja.

In depictions of the six-armed protector [[Mahakala]] (Skt: Shad-bhuja Mahakala, Wylie: mGon po phyag drug pa), an elephant-headed figure usually addressed as Vinayaka is seen being trampled by the Dharma Protector, but he does not appear distressed. In [[Vajrayana]] and cognate Buddhist art, He is depicted as a subdued god trampled by Buddhist deities like [[Aparajita]], [[Parnasabari]] and [[Vignataka]].

The Tibetan Ganesha appears, besides bronzes, in the resplendent Thangka paintings alongside the Buddha. In "''Ganesh, studies of an Asian God''," edited by Robert L. BROWN, State University of New York Press, 1992, page 241-242, he wrote that in the Tibetan Ka'gyur tradition, it is said that the Buddha had taught the "Ganapati Hridaya Mantra" (or "Aryaganapatimantra") to disciple [[Ananda]]. The sutra in which the Buddha teaches this mantra can be found here [http://ganesha.bravehost.com/index.html].

The [[lila (divine play)|'pastime' and 'play' (Sanskrit: ''lila'')]] of dancing and its representation in charnel ground literature and visual representations is endemic: [[Ganapati]] as son of Shiva, Ganapati as Lord of Gana, the demonic host of Gana, dancing ganesha, dancing gana, the dance of life and death, what is dance but a continuum of forms, dancing is energetic, dancing is symbolic of spiritual energy in iconography, particularly chthonic imagery of Dharmic Traditions. Energy moves (and cycles) between forms as does dance. The 'wheel' (Sanskrit: [[chakra]], [[mandala]]) in all its permutations and efflorescence is a profound Dharmic cultural artifact enshrining the energetic dance of the Universe. This is particularly applicable in the iconography of [[Nataraja]] and the 'wrathful deities' (Sanskrit: [[Heruka]]) of Vajrayana which are depicted with a flaming [[aureole]], a flaming wheel. This resonates with the deep symbolism of the mystery rite and folklore and folk custom and high culture of [[circle dance]]s which approaches a human [[cultural universal]]. [[Namkhai Norbu]], a famed [[Dzogchen]] master in the [[Bonpo]] tradition and the [[Dharmic Tradition]]s of [[esoteric Buddhism]] has revealed a number of [[terma (Buddhism)|terma]] (Tibetan) of circle dances such as the 'Dance of the [[Six Lokas]] of [[Samantabhadra]]'. The dance is a restricted initiatory rite and its process may not be disclosed as so doing would be a contravention of 'commitments ' (Sanskrit: [[samaya]]) but it may be affirmed that the rite is enacted on a colourful mandala of the [[Five Pure Lights]] and the 'central point' (Sanskrit: [[bindu (symbol)|bindu]]) of the dance mandala is illuminated with a sacred candle known as the 'garbha' (Sanskrit) within the International Dzogchen Community. This terma dance is all clearly applicable to the charnel ground when taken as the 'wheel of becoming' (Sanskrit: [[bhavachakra]]) which generally is demarcated by six distinct 'places' (Sanskrit: [[loka]]).

===Aghora===
[[Dattatreya]] the [[avadhuta]], to whom has been attributed the esteemed nondual medieval song, the'' [[Avadhuta Gita]]'', was a sometime denizen of the charnel ground and a founding deity of the [[Aghor tradition]] according to Barrett (2008: p.&amp;nbsp;33):

{{Quote|...Lord Dattatreya, an antinomian form of Shiva closely associated with the [[cremation ground]], who appeared to Baba Kina Ram atop Girnar Mountain in Gujarat. Considered to be the ''adi guru'' (ancient spiritual teacher) and founding deity of Aghor, Lord Dattatreya offered his own flesh to the young ascetic as ''prasād'' (a kind of blessing), conferring upon him the power of clairvoyance and establishing a guru-disciple relationship between them.|&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Ron (2008). Aghor medicine: pollution, death, and healing in northern India. Edition: illustrated. University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-25218-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-520-25218-9}}.

Barrett (2008: p.&amp;nbsp;161) discusses the sadhana of the '[[Aghori|Aghora]]' (Sanskrit; Devanagari: अघोर)&lt;ref&gt;'Aghora' in ''Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary'' [Online]. Source: [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/indexcaller.php] (accessed: Tuesday February 9, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; in both its left and right-handed proclivites and identifies it as principally cutting through attachments and aversion and foregrounding primordiality, a view uncultured, undomesticated:

{{Quote|The gurus and disciples of Aghor believe their state to be primordial and universal. They believe that all human beings are natural-born Aghori. Hari Baba has said on several occasions that human babies of all societies are without discrimination, that they will play as much in their own filth as with the toys around them. Children become progressively discriminating as they grow older and learn the culturally specific attachments and aversions of their parents. Children become increasingly aware of their mortality as they bump their heads and fall to the ground. They come to fear their mortality and then palliate this fear by finding ways to deny it altogether. In this sense, Aghor ''sādhanā'' is a process of unlearning deeply internalized cultural models. When this ''sādhanā'' takes the form of ''shmashān sādhanā'', the Aghori faces death as a very young child, simultaneously meditating on the totality of life at its two extremes. This ideal example serves as a prototype for other Aghor practices, both left and right, in ritual and in daily life.|&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Ron (2008).

*[[Vetala]] (Sanskrit)
*[[Shaivites]]
*Practitioners of [[Anuyoga]]. The Anuyoga class of tantras of the Nyingmapa is understood as the "Mother Tantras" of the Sarma Schools, this class of literature is also known as "Yogini Tantras" and there is a voluminous Shaivite or Shakta Tantra by the same name, Yoginitantra.
*In the dance of reciprocity that is the beauty and cruelty of the Mystery of living and dying, the rite of [[Ganachakra]] is celebrated, indeed all forms participate in the Ganachakra, there is nothing in the Three Worlds (''[[Trailokya|Triloka]]'') that is not a charnel ground...

Beer (2003: p.&amp;nbsp;102) relates how the symbolism of the [[khatvanga]] that entered [[esoteric Buddhism]] (particularly from [[Padmasambhava]]) was a direct borrowing from the [[Shaivite]] [[Kapalika]]s who frequented places of austerity such as charnel grounds and [[Crossroads (road)|cross roads]] etcetera as a form of 'left-handed path' (Sanskrit: [[vamamarga]]) 'spiritual practice' (Sanskrit: [[sadhana]]):

{{quote|The form of the Buddhist ''khatvanga'' derived from the emblematic staff of the early Indian Shaivite ''yogins'', known as ''kapalikas'' or 'skull-bearers'. The ''kapalikas'' were originally miscreants who had been sentenced to a twelve-year term of penance for the crime of inadvertently killing a Brahmin. The penitent was prescribed to dwell in a forest hut, at a desolate crossroads, in a charnel ground, or under a tree; to live by begging; to practice austerities; and to wear a loin-cloth of hemp, dog, or donkey-skin. They also had to carry the emblems of a human skull as an alms-bowl, and the skull of the Brahmin they had slain mounted upon a wooden staff as a banner.These Hindu ''kapalika'' ascetics soon evolved into an extreme outcaste sect of the 'left-hand' tantric path (Skt. vamamarg) of ''shakti'' or goddess worship. The early Buddhist tantric ''yogins'' and ''yoginis'' adopted the same goddess or ''dakini'' attributes of the ''kapalikas''. These attributes consisted of; bone ornaments, an animal skin loincloth, marks of human ash, a skull-cup, ''damaru'', flaying knife, thighbone trumpet, and the skull-topped tantric staff or ''khatvanga''.|&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Robert (2003).

==Sadhana==
Sadhana in the charnel ground within the Dharmic Traditions may be traced to ancient depictions of the chthonic [[Shiva]] and his [[wikt:chimera|chimeric]] son [[Ganapati]] (Ganesha) who was decapitated and returned to life with the head of an elephant. In certain narratives, Shiva made the Ganesha 'lord of the [[gana]]' (Sanskrit: Ganapati). Such depictions of Shiva, Ganesha and the ganas are evident in literature, architectural ornamentation and iconography, etc. In the Indian traditions of Tantra the charnel ground is very important. In must be remembered that the seat of Shiva and his locality of sadhana is the sacred Mount [[Kailasha]] in the Himalaya. In some non-Buddhist traditions of [[Ganachakra]] such as the Kaula the leader of the rite is known as 'ganapati', which is a title of respect. The Eight Great Charnel Grounds are important in the life of [[Padmasambhava]]. This is one definite way the importance of the charnel ground in sadhana entered and became replicated in the Himalayan Dharmic Tradition. The charnel ground is a particular place that holds powerful teachings on impermanence and is important for slaying the ego. In this, the charnel ground shares with the tradition of [[dark retreat]] that was foregrounded in some Himalayan practice lineages.

[[Judith Simmer-Brown|Simmer-Brown]] (2001: p.&amp;nbsp;127) conveys how great [[Mahasiddha]]'s in the [[Nath]] and [[Mantrayana]] [[Buddhadharma]] traditions such as [[Tilopa]] (988–1069) and [[Goraksa|Gorakṣa]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 11th - 12th century) yoked adversity to till the soil of the path and accomplish the fruit, the '[[Ground of Being (Dzogchen)|ground]]' (Sanskrit: āśraya; Wylie: gzhi)&lt;ref&gt;Dudjom Rinpoche and Jikdrel Yeshe Dorje (1991).

Wisdom Publications, Boston. {{ISBN|0-86171-087-8}}, p.535 Index of Technical Terms&lt;/ref&gt; of realization - worthy case-studies for those with spiritual proclivity:

{{quote|The charnel ground is not merely the hermitage; it can also be discovered or revealed in completely terrifying mundane environments where practitioners find themselves desperate and depressed, where conventional worldly aspirations have  become devastated by grim reality. This is demonstrated in the sacred biographies of the great siddhas of the Vajrayāna tradition. Tilopa attained realization as a grinder of sesame seeds and a procurer for a prominent prostitute. Sarvabhakṣa was an extremely obese glutton, Gorakṣa was a cowherd in remote climes, Taṅtepa was addicted to gambling, and Kumbharipa was a destitute potter. These circumstances were charnel grounds because they were despised in Indian society and the siddhas were viewed as failures, marginal and defiled.|&lt;ref name="Simmer-Brown 2001 p.127"/&gt;}}

==Poetry, song, and literature==
Dyczkowski (1988: p.&amp;nbsp;26) holds that [[Hāla]]'s [[Prakrit literature]] poem the ''[[Gāthāsaptaśati]]'' (third to fifth century CE) is one of the first extant literary references to a [[Kapalika]] where in the poem the Kapalika, who is a female, anoints and besmears her body with the crematory ash from the funeral pyre of her recently deceased lover.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"&gt;Dyczkowski, Mark S. G. (1988). ''The canon of the Śaivāgama and The Kubjikā Tantras of the western Kaula tradition''. SUNY series in Kashmir Śaivism.

Dyczkowski (1988: p.&amp;nbsp;26) relates how [[Krishna Mishra|Kṛṣṇa Miśra]] (c 1050-1100) casts the character of a [[Kāpālika]] in his play, the '' [[Prabodhacandrodaya]]'' and then quotes verbatim a source that renders the creed of this character into English:
{{quote|"My charming ornaments are made from garlands of human skulls." says the Kāpālika, "I dwell in the cremation ground and eat my food from a human skull. I view the world alternately as separate from God ([[Ishvara|Īśvara]]) and one with Him, through the eyes that are made clear with the ointment of yoga... We (Kāpālikas) offer oblations of human flesh mixed with brains, entrails and marrow. We break our fast by drinking liquor ([[Sura (alcoholic beverage)|surā]]) from the skull of a Brahmin. At that time the god Mahābhairava should be worshipped with offerings of awe-inspiring human sacrifices from whose severed throats blood flows in currents."&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"/&gt;}}

In Vajrayana poetry, literature and song, particularly that of the '[[songs of realization]]', charnel grounds are often described as containing "rivers of blood", "poisonous waterfalls", and depicted as localities containing dangerous wild beasts. The [[two truths]] doctrine though iterates this view and when perceived differently, charnel grounds are peaceful places of [[beatitude|beatific]] [[solitude]] and this [[chthonic]] symbolism and the [[twilight language]] and iconography accrues a rich [[polysemy]]. When perceived differently, the charnel grounds are places of 'peace' (Sanskrit: ''shanti''), pleasant groves, populated by wildflowers and fruit. [[Songbird]]s, tame lions and tigers, and the vast open vault of the sky, fruit and flowers are often used in Vajrayana iconography and poetry and Beer (1999)&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Beer|Beer, Robert]] (1999). ''The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs'', (Hardcover). Shambhala Publications. {{ISBN|1-57062-416-X}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57062-416-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains their symbolism and how they are understood in the tradition in fine detail. They are all included in depictions of the charnel ground.

==Beyond social convention==
In the charnel grounds of Vajrayana, there are no [[social convention]]s to conform to and no distractions to be seduced by for the [[siddha]].&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"/&gt;  Dakas and [[dakini]]s gather there to celebrate ceremonial tsok 'feasts' (Sanskrit: [[ganachakra]]). The lion's roar of [[Dharma]] discourse resound as do the [[liturgy]] and the specific 'hourglass drums' (Sanskrit: [[damaru]]) of the [[chöd]]pa and the light of the inner 'joy of bliss' (Sanskrit: [[ananda]]) radiates and this dynamic movement is represented iconographically by the 'bliss-whirling' (Sanskrit: [[gankyil|ananda-chakra]]).

In his ''Manual'' on the practice of the ''[[Longchen Nyingtik]]'', [[Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche]] holds that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Right now, our minds are very fickle. Sometimes you like a certain place, and it inspires, and yet with that same place, if you stay too long, it bores you. […] As you practice more and more, one day this kind of habit, this fickle mind will just go. Then you will search for the bindu interpretation of the right place, and according to the classic tantric texts, that is usually what they call the “eight great charnel grounds”. So then, you have to go to a cemetery, especially to one of the eight cemeteries. There, under a tree, in the charnel ground, wearing a tiger skin skirt, holding a [[kapāla]] and having this indifference between relatives and enemies, indifference between food and shit, you will practise. Then your [[bindu (symbol)|bindu]] will flow. At that time, you will know how to have intercourse between emptiness and appearance."&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, from ''Longchen Nyingtik Practice Manual'' (page 66).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the life in which a [[pratyekabuddha]] attains the fruit of their 'path' (Wylie: lam), they are naturally drawn to charnel grounds. "When reflecting on the bones found there, the pratyekabuddha inquire "Where do these bones come from?"&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"/&gt;  This [[samyama]] (Sanskrit) on the bones awakens knowledge of their many lifetimes of investigation into the [[Twelve Nidanas|'Twelve Links of Dependent Origination']]. These twelve links then unfold in their [[mindstream]] as a 'blessing' (Sanskrit: [[adhishthana]]), in both forward and reverse sequence and on that foundation they yield 'realisation' (Sanskrit: [[siddhi]]).&lt;ref name="rigpawiki.org"/&gt;

==Vajrayana iconography==
The charnel ground, cremation ground and cemetery is evident as a specific region within wrathful Indo-Tibetan [[sand mandala]] iconography. As the anthropologist Gold (1994: p.&amp;nbsp;141) relates in his comparative study drawn from his professional fieldwork into the symbolic universals of the sacred circles and [[sand-painting]]s of the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Tibetan people]]s, parses the sacred precinct and motif of the charnel ground as a locality in the symbolic grammar of the Indo-Tibetan 'fierce yidam' or '[[wrathful deities|wrathful deity]]' (Sanskrit: [[heruka]]) sand mandala:

{{Quote|The third concentric ring [from the circumference] is optional, in that it is only used in mandalas representing the reality of deities of fierce power. It represents the charnel grounds wherein bodies are cut up and offered to birds of prey as a "sky burial." This ring signifies the cutting away of the bones and flesh of illusion on the way to the primordial ground at the mandala's center. In some mandalas, it is positioned outside of the Mountain of Fire ring.|&lt;ref name="Gold, Peter 1994 p.141"/&gt;}}

The region of the charnel grounds in many wrathful mandala often hold eight specific charnel grounds where certain key events take place in the life of [[Padmasambhava]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Judith Simmer-Brown|Simmer-Brown, Judith]] (2001). ''Dakini's warm breath: the feminine principle in Tibetan Buddhism''. Boston, Massachusetts, USA: Shambhala Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-57062-920-4}} (paperback), p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vajrayana [[wrathful deities|yidam]] [[Citipati (Buddhism)|Citipati]] is said to be the Lord of Charnel Grounds.&lt;ref name="androgynylist"&gt;http://www.androgynylist.com/categories/Essence%20of%20Indistinction/sub/citipati.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Blood is thematic in Charnel Ground iconography where it may be understood as [[Blood|lifeblood]], a symbol of viscous 'compassion' (Sanskrit: [[Karuṇā|karuna]]) of 'sacrifice' (Sanskrit:[[yajna]]), and attendant with the symbolism of blood, bones ground our shared humanity and solidarity in the wider [[Mandala]] of life and the ancient lineage of '[[ancestors]]' from which all sentient beings are of lineal descent.

The tradition and custom of the 'sky burial' (Tibetan: ''jhator'') afforded [[Traditional Tibetan medicine]] and ''[[thangka]]'' [[iconography]] such as the '[[Tree of physiology]]' with a particular insight into the interior workings of the human body. Pieces of the [[human skeleton]] were employed in ritual tools such as the [[Kapala|skullcup]], [[Kangling|thigh-bone trumpet]], etc.

The 'symbolic bone ornaments' (Skt: {{IAST|aṣṭhiamudrā}}; Tib: rus pa'i rgyanl phyag rgya) are also known as "[[mudra]]" or 'seals' are also known as 'charnel ground ornaments'. The ''[[Hevajra Tantra]]'' identifies the Symbolic Bone Ornaments with the [[Five Wisdoms]] and [[Jamgon Kongtrul]] in his commentary to the ''Hevajra Tantra'' explains this further.&lt;ref name="Kongtrul_2005_493"&gt;{{harvnb|Kongtrul|2005|p=493}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The important Varnamala (or 'garland of [[Bīja|bija]] phonemes' in [[twilight language]] is iconographically represented by a 'garland of severed heads or skulls' (Sanskrit: [[Mundamala]]).

==Padmasambhava==
Beer (1999:  pp.&amp;nbsp;277–278) relates how [[Padmasambhava]] received the siddhi of the [[Kīla (Buddhism)|kīla]] [[esoteric transmission|transmission]] from a gigantic [[scorpion]] at the charnel ground of [[Rajgriha]]:

{{quote|The sting of the scorpion's whip-like tail transfixes and poisons its prey, and in this respect it is identified with the wrathful activity of the ritual dagger or kīla. Padmasambhava's biography relates how he received the siddhi of the kīla transmission at the great charnel ground of Rajgriha from a gigantic scorpion with nine heads, eighteen pincers and twenty-seven eyes. This scorpion reveals the kīla texts from a triangular stone box hidden beneath a rock in the cemetery. As Padmasambhava reads this terma text spontaneous understanding arises, and the heads, pincers, and eyes of the scorpion are 'revealed' as different vehicles or ''yanas'' of spiritual attainment. Here, at Rajgriha, Padmasambhava is given the title of 'the scorpion guru', and in one of his eight forms as Guru Dragpo or Pema Drago ('wrathful lotus'), he is depicted with a scorpion in his left hand. As an emblem of the wrathful kīla  transmission the image of the scorpion took on a strong symbolic meaning in the early development of the Nyingma or 'ancient school' of Tibetan Buddhism...".|&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Beer|Beer, Robert]] (1999).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="94644">[[Chewa language|Chichewa]] (also but less commonly known as Chinyanja, Chewa or Nyanja) is the main [[lingua franca]] of central and southern [[Malawi]] and neighbouring regions. Like other [[Bantu language|Bantu]] languages it has a wide range of tenses. In terms of time, '''Chichewa tenses''' can be divided into present, recent past, remote past, near future, and remote future. The dividing line between near and remote tenses is not exact, however. Remote tenses cannot be used of events of today, but near tenses can be used of events earlier or later than today.

The Chichewa tense system also incorporates [[Grammatical aspect|aspectual]] distinctions. Except for the Present Simple, nearly every tense in Chichewa is either [[Perfective aspect|perfective]] or [[Imperfective aspect|imperfective]] in aspect; for example the Recent Past ''ndinapíta'' "I went" is perfective, describing a simple action, while the Past Imperfective ''ndimapíta'' "I was going, I used to go" is imperfective, describing a continuing or habitual action. In the imperfective tenses for the most part there is no distinction between [[Habitual aspect|habitual]] and [[Progressive aspect|progressive]] aspect; however, in the present tense there is such a distinction; for example, ''ndímapíta'' "I go (every day)" (habitual) vs ''ndikupíta'' "I am going (now)" (progressive).

Another aspectual distinction in Chichewa is that between [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]] and past. A perfect tense is one which carries an implication that the result of a past action still holds at the present time; for example, ''wabwera'' "he has come" implies that the person is still here. The past tenses in Chichewa carry exactly the opposite implication, namely that the result of the past action no longer holds; for example the Recent Past tense ''anabwéra'' "he came" implies that the person has now gone. This kind of tense is known in modern linguistics as [[discontinuous past]]. It differs from the English Past Simple, which is generally neutral in implication.&lt;ref name=Com52&gt;Comrie (1978), ''Aspect'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between one tense and another in Chichewa is made partly by changing the tense-marker, which is an infix such as ''-ku-'', ''-na-'', ''-ma-'' etc. added to the verb, and partly by the use of [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]]. Often two different tenses, such as ''ndimapíta'' "I was going" and ''ndímapíta'' "I go", have the same tense-marker but are distinguished by their tonal pattern.

Compound tenses are also found in Chichewa to express more complex meanings, such as ''ndimatí ndipité'' "I was about to go" or ''ndakhala ndíkúpíta'' "I have been going".

In addition to ordinary tenses, Chichewa also has tenses to express obligation ("I should go"), potentiality ("I might go"), and persistence ("I am still going"), participle-like tenses with meanings such as "while going", "having gone", "before going", and a number of tenses meaning "when..." or "if..." such as ''akapita'' "when he goes", ''átápíta'' "if he were to go", and ''ákadapíta'' "if he had gone".

==Formation of the tenses==
===Basic tense formation===
Chichewa verbs in their basic form are made with a subject-marker (''ndi-'' "I", ''u-'' "you (sg)", etc.), which is followed by a tense-marker (if present), and then the verb stem. The Present Continuous (Present Progressive) tense, which has tense-marker ''-ku-'', goes as follows:&lt;ref name="Maxson 2011, p. 40"&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ndi-ku-thándiza'' "I am helping"
*''u-ku-thándiza'' "you (sg.) are helping"
*''a-ku-thándiza'' "he or she is helping"
*''ti-ku-thándiza'' "we are helping"
*''mu-ku-thándiza'' "you (pl. or polite) are helping"
*''a-ku-thándiza'' "they are helping"

Other subject-markers are possible, e.g. ''chi-'' (referring to ''chímanga'' "maize"), ''i-'' (referring to ''nkhúku'' "chicken"), ''zi-'' (referring to ''mbálame'' "birds") and so on.

Freestanding pronouns such as ''ine'' "I", ''iwe'' "you", ''iyé'' "he, she" are available and may be added for emphasis: ''ine ndikuthándiza'' "I am helping".&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Present Simple, Present Subjunctive, and Basic Imperative have no tense-marker; all the rest have a tense-marker.

In modern standard Chichewa except in the Perfect tense there is no difference between the 3rd person singular "he/she" and the 3rd person plural "they", although there are some dialects such as the Town Nyanja spoken in Lusaka, Zambia where the 3rd person plural is still ''βa-'' and thus different from the singular.&lt;ref&gt;Gray et al. (2013), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Perfect tense is exceptional in that the subject-marker is shortened when followed by the tense-marker ''-a-''. It is also exceptional in that the 3rd person singular has ''w-'' instead of ''a-'', and is thus different from the 3rd person plural:&lt;ref name="Maxson 2011, p. 40"/&gt;
*''nd-a-thandiza'' "I have helped"
*''w-a-thandiza'' "you (sg.) have helped"
*''w-a-thandiza'' "he/she has helped"
*''t-a-thandiza'' "we have helped"
*''mw-a-thandiza'' "you (pl. or polite) have helped"
*''a-thandiza'' "they have helped" (or "he/she (polite) has helped")

Other elements can be added between the tense-marker and the verb-stem, such as aspect-markers and object-markers. So for example the object-marker ''-mu-'' "him" or "her" can be added to any of the above verbs: ''nd-a-&lt;u&gt;mú&lt;/u&gt;-thandiza'' "I have helped &lt;u&gt;him&lt;/u&gt;".

===Near and remote tenses===
Certain tenses in Chichewa, such as those with ''-ná-'', ''-nká-'' and ''-dzá-'', are used for events remote in time, while others are used mainly for events of today (including last night).&lt;ref&gt;Watkins (1937), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; However, although the remote tenses are never used for events of today, the opposite is not true. As one scholar [[Jack Mapanje]] puts it: "Although traditional and other grammarians have latched on to the idea of immediate, near or remote past or future time, this is not a hard and fast rule for our languages. Usually the decision as to how immediate, near or remote past or future time is from the speech time is dependent on subjective factors."&lt;ref&gt;Mapanje (1983), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''-na-'' and ''-da-''===
The tense ''ndinábwera'' or ''ndidábwera'' "I came" can be made with either ''-na-'' or ''-da-''. The difference is partly regional, since ''-da-'' is heard mainly in parts of the Central Region, especially in the area around Lilongwe.&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p.109.&lt;/ref&gt; ''-da-'' was also chosen as the correct form to be used in written Chichewa by the first President of Malawi, [[Hastings Banda|Hastings Kamuzu Banda]], in his wish to standardise the language and to make the Central Region variety the basis of that standard. Banda is said to have declared: "The real Chichewa is what is spoken by the villagers in Dowa, Lilongwe, Dedza, Salima; in the Southern Region, Namkumba's area in Fort Johnston [Mangochi]".&lt;ref&gt;Kamwendo, (1999), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''-da-'' has come to be used as the standard form in written Chichewa. In the older 1922 translation of the Bible, ''-na-'' is more commonly used than ''-da-'' (although ''-da-'' is used occasionally), whereas in the more recent translation of 1998, ''-da-'' is the usual past tense marker.&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Books describing the language prescriptively for Malawian schools therefore allow only ''-da-'' as the Remote Perfect tense-marker.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Chibambo (2008), p. 56; Ngoma &amp; Chauma (2011), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Colloquially, however, ''-ná-'' seems to be more common, and is the form given in most books describing Chichewa grammar.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Stevick, Louw, Mtenje, Mchombo, Maxson, Mapanje, Katsonga-Woodward.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Recent Past tense is involved, as a rule only ''-na-'' is used, rarely ''-da-''.&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; ''-da-'' is regarded as incorrect by Malawian teachers, the only form allowed for events of today being ''-na-''.&lt;ref&gt;Chibambo (2008), p. 56; Ngoma &amp; Chauma (2011), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Remote Past tense, similarly some dialects use ''-na:-'' and others ''-da:-''. In some books, such as the 1998 Bible translation, ''Buku Loyera'', this tense-marker is always spelled with a double ''a'' (''-daa-''), but frequently the spelling ''-na-'' or ''-da-'' with a single ''a'' is used, so that only the context makes it clear whether the Past Simple or the Remote Past is intended.&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tense and tone==
{{see|Chichewa tones}}

[[Tone (linguistics)|Tones]] (the rises and falls in pitch of the voice) play an important part in the grammar of the Chichewa verb. Each tense has its own tonal pattern, although often the same pattern is used by more than one tense.&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the Present Continuous, Recent Past, and Imperfect all have a high tone on the syllable following the tense-marker:
*''ndi-ku-th'''á'''ndiza'' "I am helping"
*''ndi-na-th'''á'''ndiza'' "I helped (just now)"
*''ndi-ma-th'''á'''ndiza'' "I was helping"

The Present Habitual, on the other hand, has two high tones, one on the subject-marker and the other on the penultimate syllable:
*''nd'''í'''-ma-thand'''í'''za'' "I (usually) help"

The Past Simple (Remote Perfect) has a tone on the tense-marker itself, which in some dialects spreads to the following syllable:
*''ndi-n'''á'''-thandiza'' or ''ndi-n'''á'''-th'''á'''ndiza'' "I helped"

Further tonal patterns are noted in the table above.

The same tonal pattern is used whether the verb is short or long. However, when the verb is a short one of one or two syllables only, certain adjustments may be made. For example, a penultimate tone may move to the final or sometimes disappear:
*''nd'''í'''-ma-wer'''é'''nga'' "I usually read"
*''nd'''í'''-ma-dy'''á''''' "I usually eat"

*''ndi-nk'''á'''-thand'''í'''za'' "I used to help"
*''ndi-nk'''á'''-p'''í'''t'''á''''' "I used to go"&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999a), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ndi-nk'''á'''-dya'' "I used to eat"

The addition of an aspect-marker or object-marker to a verb can cause an extra tone on the verb-stem:
*''a-ku-s'''ó'''kosera'' "they are causing a disturbance"
*''a-ku-m'''á'''-sokos'''é'''ra'' "they are always causing a disturbance"

In negative tenses different tonal patterns are used.&lt;ref&gt;For different negative tenses see Mtenje (1986), p. 244ff; Mtenje (1987), p. 183ff; Kanerva (1990), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
*''mu-pit'''é''''' "you should go"
*''mu-sa-p'''í'''te'' "you shouldn't go"

Some tenses have two different negative intonations, depending on the shade of meaning. For example, the Remote Perfect ''ndi-n'''á'''-gula'' "I bought" has the following negatives with different meanings:
*''s'''í'''-nd'''í'''-na-g'''ú'''le'' (or ''sí-ndi-na-gúle'') "I didn't buy" 
*''si-ndi-na-g'''ú'''le'' "I haven't bought yet"

Another factor causing a change of tone is whether a verb is being used in a relative clause or certain other types of clause. For example, there is a difference in meaning between:
*''ndi-ku-p'''í'''ta'' "I am going"
*''nd'''í'''-k'''ú'''-p'''í'''ta'' "when I am/was going" 

Another factor affecting the tones of a verb is that when a verb is followed by an object or a place-argument, the tone usually spreads:&lt;ref&gt;Louw (1987), vol. 3, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''m'''ú'''-ma-kh'''á'''la'' "you stay"
*''m'''ú'''-ma-kh'''á'''l'''á''' kuti?'' "where do you live?"

For further details see [[Chichewa tones]].

==Aspect-Markers==
Following the tense-marker it is possible to add one or more aspect-markers, which are infixes which modify the meaning of the tense. There are four different aspect-markers, which usually are added in the order: ''-ma-'', ''-ka-'', ''-dza-'', ''-ngo-''.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman &amp; Mtenje (1999a), pp. 94f.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''-ma-''===
''-Ma-'' can be used in its own right as a tense-marker, or can be added to other tense-markers to make the tense habitual:
*''Usachíte'' "don't do", vs. ''usa'''má'''chíté'' "don't keep on doing".&lt;ref name="Salaun 1993, p. 77"&gt;Salaun (1993), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Ndikagula'' "if I buy", vs. ''ndika'''má'''gúlá'' "whenever I buy".&lt;ref name="Maxson 2011, p. 88"&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''-ka-''===
The meaning of ''-ka-'' is usually "go and...". Sometimes it can mean "go in order to":&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2016), s.v. "-ka-"; Maxson (2016), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Tidzápemphera'' "we will pray" vs. ''tidzá'''ká'''pemphera'' "we will go and pray"

===''-dza-''===
''-Dza-'' has two meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2016), s.v. "-dza-"; Maxson (2016), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The first meaning is "come and...".  With an Infinitive or Subjunctive after a verb of coming, it can mean "in order to":
*''Kuthándiza'' "to help" vs. ''ndabwera ku'''dzá'''thandizá'' "I have come to help".

The second meaning is or "at a later time, in future":
*''Zikadámúvuta'' "it would have caused him problems" vs. ''zikadá'''dzá'''múvuta'' "it would have caused him problems later"

===''-ngo-''===
The aspect-marker ''-ngo-'' means "just".&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2016), s.v. "-ngo-".&lt;/ref&gt; As it is derived from the Infinitive, the tone, as in the Infinitive itself, goes on the syllable following ''-ngo-'', and the final vowel is always ''-a'', never ''-e'':
*''Ndimafúna'' "I wanted", vs. ''Ndimá'''ngo'''fúna'' "I just wanted".&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual tenses==

===Present tenses===

====Present Simple====
The Present Simple tense is formed without any tense-marker, but with a tone on the subject-prefix: ''ndíthandiza'' "I help, I will help" (the first tone can spread, making ''ndíthándiza''). The Present Simple of the verb ''-li'' ("is") is irregular, in that it has no tone on the subject prefix: ''ndili'' "I am".&lt;ref name=Max79&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The negative has two different intonations depending on whether it has a future meaning: ''síndíthandiza'' "I don't help", ''sindithandíza'' "I won't help".

The Present Simple tense can be both perfective and imperfective in aspect. When the Present Simple is perfective, the meaning is usually immediate future:&lt;ref name=Max79 /&gt;
*'''''Ndínyamula''' katúndu, musavutíke.'' &lt;br /&gt;"I'll carry the bags, don't trouble yourself."

It can sometimes, however, be used perfectively referring to the present, for example in chapter headings or newspaper headlines.

When the Present Simple is imperfective, it refers to present time, and is usually habitual. In earlier Chichewa the simple tense was more widely used than today, and there are many places in the 1922 Bible translation (''Búkú Lópátuliká'') where the Present Simple is replaced in the more modern 1998 version by the Present Habitual or Present Continuous, for example:
*''Mphépo '''íomba''' pomwé '''ífuna'''''. (1922 version)&lt;ref&gt;John 3:8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The wind blows where it will."
*''Mphépo '''ímaombéra''' komwé '''íkúfúna'''''. (1998 version)&lt;br /&gt;"The wind blows where it will (lit. usually blows to where it is wanting)."

The modern tendency is to use the Present Habitual or Present Continuous even for stative verbs such as "I love", "I know", "I want", "I believe", "I hope" and so on, although the simple form can also sometimes be used.&lt;ref&gt;See table in Kiso (2012), p. 93; Maxson (2011), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain verbs, such as ''ndíkhoza'' "I might (do)" and ''ndili'' "I am", however, are always used in the simple form.

The Present Simple tense is more commonly used in an imperfective sense when negative. Often it is used for the negative of a stative verb:
*''Ine '''síndídziwa''' kuyéndetsa gálímoto.''&lt;br /&gt;"I don't know how to drive a car."

At other times it has a habitual meaning, and some authors see it as being the negative of the Present Habitual.&lt;ref&gt;Salaun (1993), p. 18; Mtenje (1987), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following example, the Present Habitual is used for the positive, but the Present Simple for the negative:
*''Nthénjere '''tímadyá''' koma nthúla '''sítidya'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"We eat sour-plums but we don't eat bitter-apples."

With negative monosyllabic verbs when negative, the Present Continuous is sometimes used, even though the meaning is habitual:&lt;ref&gt;Salaun (1993), pp. 18f.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Amaláwi ámbíri '''sákumwá''' mowa.''&lt;br /&gt;"Many Malawians don't drink alcohol."

However, ''sámwá'' and ''sámámwá'' are also possible here.

====Present Habitual====
The Present Habitual tense (''ndí-ma-thandíza'' "I help, habitually") is formed by adding ''-ma-'' to the Present Simple tense. The tones are on the subject-marker and penultimate; the first tone never spreads.&lt;ref name=Mte7n&gt;Mtenje (1995), p. 7n.&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically used for situations in the present which are repeated habitually or which are continuous and expected to continue indefinitely:&lt;ref&gt;Chibambo (2008), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Mvúlá ikagwa, mitsínje '''ímadzála'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"When it rains, the rivers get full."
*'''''Ndímakhálá''' ku Lilongwe.''&lt;br /&gt;"I live in Lilongwe."

As noted above, the negative of this tense usually omits ''-ma-''. However, the infix ''-ma-'' (with a tone) can be added especially if the meaning is emphatic:
*'''''Síndímádandaulá'''''.&lt;br /&gt;"I never complain".

The tense-marker ''-ma-'' appears to derive from an earlier ''-mba-''.&lt;ref&gt;Scott &amp; Hetherwick (1929), s.v. "ma", "mba"; cf. ''-kamba-'' for ''-kama-'' in Watkins (1937), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; (-mba- is also used as a habitual marker in the Malawian variety of [[Sena language|Chisena]].)&lt;ref&gt;Funnell (2004), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Kanerva (1990) records forms like ''ndíímaphíika'' "I cook", showing a long vowel in the first syllable in the Nkhotakota dialect;&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva (1990), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; however, other dialects have a short vowel.

====Present Continuous====
The Present Continuous (or Present Progressive) tense uses the tense-marker ''-ku-'', with the tone on the syllable immediately after ''-ku-'': ''ndi-ku-thándiza'' "I am helping". The negative also has a tone in the same place: ''sí-ndí-ku-thándiza'' "I am not helping".&lt;ref name="Mtenje 1986, p. 248"&gt;Mtenje (1986), p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; (Note that since ''-ku-'' can also mean "you (sg.)" these words, with the intonation ''ndíkúthandiza'' and ''sindikuthandíza'', can also mean "I will help you" and "I won't help you", assuming that the person being addressed is younger than or a close friend of the speaker.) 

It is used much like the English Present Continuous for temporary situations which are not expected to continue for long. It can also be used, as in English, for events which are already planned, e.g. "I'm going to Zambia next week" or which are still incompleted but under way:&lt;ref&gt;Chibambo (2008), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Ndikupítá''' ku msika.'' &lt;br /&gt;"I'm going to the market." (now)
*'''''Ndikupítá''' kwáthu máwa''.&lt;br /&gt;"I'm going home tomorrow."
*''Iyé '''akumángá''' khítchini kwáwo.''&lt;br /&gt;"He's building a kitchen at his house."

This tense is used in a wider range of contexts than the English equivalent, since it is also often used with stative verbs such as "know", "want", "remember", "believe", "expect", "think", "see":&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 79; Kiso (2012), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Ukugániza''' kutí '''síndikudzíwa'''?''&lt;br /&gt;"Do you think that I don't know?"

It is also used for performative verbs, such as ''ndikulónjeza'' "I promise", although some older speakers use the Present Simple in such contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p. 89, 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some contexts the Present Continuous can be used where English uses the Perfect Continuous:
*''Chigwetséreni ndalámayo zinthu '''zikuthína'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"Since the devaluation of the currency things have been getting difficult."

The longer form of this tense, ''ndinalí kuthándiza'' or ''ndínalí kuthándiza'', mentioned in some older books,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Scotton &amp; Orr (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; is not often used nowadays, the simpler form being much more common.

====Present Frequentative====
A Present Frequentative tense can be made by combining the Present Progressive ''-ku-'' and the aspect-marker ''-má-''.&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2016), s.v. -kuma-; Maxson (2011), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally used for situations which the speaker disapproves of. Again, the addition of ''-ma-'' is emphatic. The tones are on ''-ma-'' and the penultimate:
*'''''Akumásokoséra''' ndí máwáilesi.'' &lt;br /&gt;"They are always causing a disturbance with radios."

====Present Persistive====
This tense is formed with the tense-marker ''-kada-'', ''-kana-'', or ''-daka-'' and a single tone on the penultimate syllable: ''ndikadathandíza'' or ''ndidakathandíza'' "I am still helping".&lt;ref&gt;Watkins (1937), p. 99; Salaun (1993), p. 75; Scotton &amp; Orr (1980), vol. 2, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; (This tone moves to the final in monosyllabic verbs.) It is most often used with the verb ''-li'' "be". With other verbs the tendency is to replace this tense with the suffix ''-be'' "still": ''ndikuthándizábe'' "I am still helping",&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 276f.; Kiso (2012), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; but this suffix is not available with the verb ''-li'', since ''ndilíbe'' has a different meaning, namely "I do not have".&lt;ref&gt;Salaun (1993), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Mwanáyo '''akadavutíka'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"The girl is still suffering."
*''Malipiro '''akadalí''' wótsíka.''&lt;br /&gt;"Wages are still low."

Sometimes the tense-marker ''-kada-'' is shortened to ''-ka-''.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins (1937), p. 99; Salaun (1993), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of expressing "still" is a form in ''chi-...-re''; but this is used only for a few verbs:&lt;ref&gt;Salaun (1993), p. 75; Maxson, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Ali '''chigonére'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"She's still in bed."

For the participial form of the persistive tense, see below.

===Perfect tenses===
A [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]] tense is usually defined as one which indicates the continuing present relevance of a past situation.&lt;ref name=Com52 /&gt; Thus the use of the Perfect tense in the sentence "I have lost my penknife" indicates that the penknife is still missing.

Several different typical uses of perfect tenses are distinguished in linguistics textbooks:&lt;ref&gt;Comrie (1978), ''Aspect'', pp. 56-61.&lt;/ref&gt; the Perfect of Result (e.g. "I have lost my penknife"); the Experiential Perfect (e.g. "Bill has been to America (at least once)"); the Perfect of Persistent Situation (e.g. "I've been waiting for hours"); and the Perfect of Recent Past (e.g. "I've seen her this morning"). All of these uses can be found in the Chichewa Perfect.

In English, the use of the Perfect is incompatible with a time adverb referring to a time completely in the past (e.g. "yesterday"). However, this is not necessarily the case in all languages; in Spanish, for example, the Perfect is compatible with an adverb such as ''ayer'' "yesterday".&lt;ref&gt;Comrie (1978), ''Aspect'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; As will be seen below, Chichewa may also combine the Perfect with a past time adverb.

====Perfect Simple====
The Perfect Simple tense in Chichewa is formed as described above with the tense-marker ''-a-'', e.g. ''nd-a-gula'' "I have bought (some)". It is toneless, unless the verb-stem itself has a tone (e.g. ''nd-a-topá'' "I am tired"). There is no exact negative, although a particular intonation of the negative past with the tone on the penultimate only is often regarded as the equivalent of a negative Perfect (''si-ndi-na-gúle'' "I haven't bought it yet").&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1986), p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Perfect of result=====
As with the English Perfect, the Perfect tense is often used as a perfect of result, usually referring to very recent events:
*''Máyo! Sélula yángá '''yabedwa'''!''&lt;br /&gt;"Oh no! My phone's been stolen!" (implying that it is still lost)

Unlike the English Perfect, it is possible to combine it with an adverb of time such as "at ten o'clock":&lt;ref&gt;Mapanje (1983), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Tamúpeza''' pa téni koloko.'' &lt;br /&gt;"We found him at ten o'clock."

=====Perfect of experience=====
As in English also it can be used as a Perfect of experience to describe something which has happened once or more and which may happen again:&lt;ref&gt;Mapanje (1983), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Ndapitá'''nsó ku Chitípa katátu.'' &lt;br /&gt;"I've been back to Chitipa three times."

=====Perfect with present meaning=====
A usage less familiar from English but common in other Bantu languages such as Swahili&lt;ref&gt;D.V. Perrott (1951/1957) ''Swahili'', pp. 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt; is to express a present state resulting from a recent event. For example, "he is wearing a suit" is expressed in Chichewa as "he has put on a suit"; "he is sitting on a chair" is expressed as "he has sat down on a chair"; "I am tired" is expressed as "I have become tired", and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Mapanje (1983), p. 71; cf Kiso (2012), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Wavala''' súti''. &lt;br /&gt;"He's wearing a suit." (literally "he has put on a suit")
*''Mangó aja '''apsa'''.'' &lt;br /&gt;"Those mangoes are ripe." (lit. "have ripened")
*'''''Ndatopá'''.'' &lt;br /&gt;"I am tired." (lit. "I have become tired")
*'''''Wakhala''' m'khítchini.''&lt;br /&gt;"She's sitting in the kitchen (right now)"
*'''''Zatheká''' bwánji?''&lt;br /&gt;"How is it possible?"

To express the past version of such situations ("he was wearing a suit") the Recent Past or Remote Past is used.

=====Perfect Continuous=====
The Perfect tense of the verb ''-khala'' ("stay" or "be") either by itself or combined with another verb is used as the equivalent of the English Perfect Continuous to express a situation which began some time ago but which is still continuing now:
*'''''Ndakhala''' pano (kwá) miyezí isanu.''&lt;ref&gt;Scotton &amp; Orr (1980), vol.1, p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"I've been here for five months."
*'''''Takhala tíkúgwíra''' ntchíto kuyámbira Lólémba.''&lt;ref&gt;Scotton &amp; Orr (1980), vol.2, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"We've been working since Monday."
*'''''Akhala chiimíre''' kwá maólá ámbíri.''&lt;ref name="Maxson 2011, p. 200"&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"He has been standing for many hours."

This construction is not mentioned in any of the early writers on Chichewa grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

====Remote Perfect====
This tense is formed with the tense-marker ''-ná-'' or ''-dá-'' (see above for the distinction between these). The tone is on the tense-marker itself. In longer verbs in some dialects this tone spreads forward one syllable: ''ndi-ná-landira'' / ''ndi-ná-lándira'' 'I (have) received'.

This tense is sometimes referred to as the "Past"&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; or "Simple Past".&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1987), p. 172; Mapanje (1983), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the descriptions given by several authors make it clear that, except in its use in narrative, it should be classified as one of the perfect tenses, since like the Perfect it usually carries the implication that the effect of the action still holds. Watkins calls it the "Remote Past With Present Influence".&lt;ref name="Watkins 1937, p. 54"&gt;Watkins (1937), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to events of yesterday or earlier.

=====Remote Perfect of result=====
One common use is as a perfect of result, referring to an event whose result is still true at the time of speaking:
*'''''Anábwera'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"He came some time ago (and is still here)."&lt;ref&gt;Katsonga-Woodward (2012), p. 44; cf. Mapanje (1983), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''''Adápita''' kumudzi.''&lt;br /&gt;"He went home (supposes that he did not turn back)."&lt;ref&gt;Salaun (1993), p 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Adádya'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"He has eaten (and is not now hungry)"&lt;ref name="Watkins 1937, p. 54"/&gt;

It can be used with a past time adverb such as "yesterday" or "last year". "When this happens the 'perfect meaning' of the utterance is not lost" (Mapanje).&lt;ref&gt;Mapanje, (1983), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''''Anáfa''' chaká chátha.''&lt;br /&gt;"He died last year."

As Watkins noted,&lt;ref&gt;Watkins (1937), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; this is the appropriate tense to use to describe the creation of the world, since the result of the creation is still evident:
*''Pachiyámbi Mulungu '''adálenga''' kumwambá ndí dzíkó lápánsí.''&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 1:1 (1998 translation).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."

Like the Perfect tense it can also be used with the adverb ''masíkú ano'' "these days" to describe a change that has come about, but not recently:
*''Masíkú ano mpira '''unásintha''' kwámbíri''.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Nation 2 Sep 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"These days football has changed a lot."

=====Remote Perfect of experience=====
Like the Perfect, it can also be used experientially. In this sense, often ''-po'' or ''-ko'' is added to the verb.&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Ndinákhala''' ku África kawíri.''&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I have lived in Africa twice."
*''A Chibambo '''adáphunzitsá'''po m'sukúlú zá sékondale zósíyanásiyaná.''&lt;ref&gt;Chibambo (2008), author information.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Chibambo has taught in various secondary schools."

=====Remote Perfect in narrative=====
Another use is in narrative:&lt;ref name="Kiso 2012, p. 110"&gt;Kiso (2012), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''Ndinkáyéndá m'nkhalangó. Mwádzídzidzi '''ndidáponda''' njóka.''&lt;br /&gt;"I was walking in the forest. Suddenly I stepped on a snake."

The narrative Remote Perfect is typically used for the action in novels and short stories and in narratives such as the 1998 Bible translation. In this usage, it has the meaning of a simple past tense, and the implication that the result of the action still holds does not apply.

=====Remote Perfect negative=====
The negative of this tense has the final vowel ''-e''.&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1987), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The tones of the ordinary negative are on the negative marker (which may spread) and the penultimate; but when it has the meaning of an experiential perfect there is a single tone on the penultimate:
*'''''Síndínapíté''' ku Lilongwe.''&lt;br /&gt;"I didn't go to Lilongwe."
*'''''Sindinapíté'''pó ku Lilongwe.''&lt;br /&gt;"I have never been to Lilongwe."

The negative of the Recent Past is rarely used in modern Chichewa, and the Remote Perfect negative is used instead. When negative therefore this tense can refer to events of today as well as events in the more remote past.

===Past tenses===
The past tenses in Chichewa differ from the perfect tenses in that they all describe situations which were true in the past but of which the results no longer apply at the present time. Thus Maxson describes the Recent Past and the Remote Past as both implying that the situation has been "reversed or interrupted by another action".&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p.77; cf. Watkins (1937) p. 54ff&lt;/ref&gt; According to Watkins, the Remote Past tense would be appropriate in a sentence such as "Jesus Christ died (but rose again)"; whereas it would not be appropriate in the sentence "God created the world" since it would imply that the creation was cancelled and "a second creator did a more enduring piece of work".&lt;ref&gt;Watkins (1937), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, according to Kulemeka, the Recent Past would be inappropriate in a sentence such as "our cat died", since it would imply that the act of dying was not permanent but would allow the possibility that the cat could come to life again at some future time.&lt;ref&gt;Kulemeka (2002), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

These two tenses, therefore, appear to differ from the English past tense (which is neutral in implication), and would seem to belong to the category of past tenses known in modern linguistics as [[discontinuous past]].&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p. 121; Plungian &amp; van der Auwera (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Just as the Perfect and the Past Simple both carry the implication that the action had an enduring effect which continues to the present time, so the Recent Past and Remote Past carry the opposite implication, that the action was not permanent but was reversed or cancelled by a later action.

The Recent Past tense can also be used for narrating events that occurred earlier on the day of speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), pp. 110f.&lt;/ref&gt; (The use of the Perfect tense for narrative as described by Watkins&lt;ref name="Watkins 1937, p. 54"/&gt; is now apparently obsolete). However, for narrating a series of events of yesterday or earlier, the Remote Perfect tense is used.&lt;ref name="Kiso 2012, p. 110"/&gt;

====Recent Past====
The Recent Past is made with the tense-marker ''-na-''. The tone comes on the syllable immediately after ''-na-'': ''ndinathándiza'' "I helped (but...)".

The Recent Past is most often used for events of today, but it can also be used of earlier events. Although it can be used for simple narrative of events of earlier today, it usually carries the implication that the result of the action no longer holds true:
*'''''Anapítá''' ku Zombá, koma wabweráko.'' &lt;br /&gt;"He went to Zomba, but he has come back."&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 77; cf. Salaun (1993), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Ndinaíká''' m'thumba.'' &lt;br /&gt;"I (had) put it in my pocket (but it isn't there now)."
*'''''Anabwéra'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"He came just now (but has gone away again)."&lt;ref&gt;Katsonga-Woodward (2012), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the same verbs in which the Perfect tense describes a state in the present, the Recent Past describes a state in the recent past:
*'''''Anaválá''' súti''. &lt;br /&gt;"He was wearing a suit" (literally, "he had put on a suit").

It can also be used, however, as a simple past tense for narrative of events of earlier today:&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Ndimayéndá m'nkhalangó. Mwádzídzidzi '''ndinapóndá''' njóka''. &lt;br /&gt;"I was walking in the forest. Suddenly I stepped on a snake."

Although the tenses with ''-na-'' are usually perfective, the verb ''-li'' "be" is exceptional since the Recent Past and Remote Past in this tense usually have an imperfective meaning:
*'''''Ndinalí''' wókóndwa kwámbíri.''&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I was very pleased."

A negative form of this tense (''síndínafótókoza'' "I didn't explain", with a tone following ''na'', and with the ending -''a'') is recorded by Mtenje.&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1987), p. 183; cf. Stevick et al. (1965), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the negative seems to be rarely if ever used in modern standard Chichewa, and it is not mentioned by most other writers. Instead, the negative of the Remote Perfect (''síndínafotokóze'', with tones on the first and penultimate, and with the ending ''-e'') is generally used.

====Remote Past====
The tense-marker is ''-dáa-'' or ''-náa-'' (which are, however, usually written ''-da-'' and ''-na-'').&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1987), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; There are tones on the 1st, 2nd, and penultimate syllables. The first tone&lt;ref&gt;cf. Mapanje (1983), p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; or the second tone can be omitted: ''ndi-ná-a-gúla''; ''ndí-na-a-gúla'' "I (had) bought (but...)". This tense is a remote one, used of events of yesterday or earlier. The ''a'' of the tense-marker is always long, even though it is often written with a single vowel.

As might be expected of a tense which combines the past tense marker ''-na-'' or ''-da-'' and the Perfect tense marker ''-a-'', this tense can have the meaning of a Pluperfect:
*''Mkatí mwá chítupamo '''ádâdíndá''' chilolezo''. &lt;br /&gt;"Inside the passport they had stamped a visa."&lt;ref&gt;Moto, ''Nzeru Umati Zako'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Khamú lálíkúlu lidámtsatira, chifukwá '''lídáaóná''' zizindikiro zózízwitsa.''&lt;br /&gt;"A large crowd followed him, because they had seen amazing signs."&lt;ref&gt;1998 Bible translation, John 6:2.&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also be used to describe a situation in the distant past, using the same verbs which are used in the Perfect tense to describe a situation in the present:
*'''''Ánáaválá''' súti''. &lt;br /&gt;"He was wearing a suit." (literally, "he had put on a suit")

Another common use of this tense is as a [[discontinuous past]], expressing a situation in the past which later came to be cancelled or reversed:&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p. 120f.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Ndídáalandírá''' makúponi koma ndidágulitsa''.&lt;br /&gt;"I received some coupons but I sold them."
*''Anzáke '''ádamulétsa''', iyé sádamvére.''&lt;br /&gt;"Her friends tried to stop her but she wouldn't listen."
*''Nkhósa '''ídáatayíka'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"The sheep was lost (but has been found)."&lt;ref&gt;cf. Luke 15:6 (1998 translation).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Ádáabádwa''' wósapénya.''&lt;br /&gt;"He was born blind (but has regained his sight)."&lt;ref&gt;cf. John 9:19 (1998 translation).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Past Imperfective====
The usual Past Imperfective tense (or simply the Imperfect tense) is made with the tense-marker ''-ma-''. The tones are the same as for the Present Continuous and the Recent Past, that is, there is a tone on the syllable immediately after ''-ma''. The negative also has a tone after ''-ma-'': ''síndímathándiza'' "I wasn't helping".&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1986), p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; This tense can refer either to very recent time or to remote time in the past.&lt;ref name="Kiso 2012, p. 127"&gt;Kiso (2012), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be used for progressive events in the past:&lt;ref name=M122&gt;Mapanje (1983), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Ntháwi iméneyo '''umachókera''' kuti?'' &lt;br /&gt;"At that time where were you coming from?"

It can also be used for habitual events in the past:&lt;ref name=M122 /&gt;
*''M'kalási '''timakhálira''' limódzi''. &lt;br /&gt;"In class we used to sit together."

====Remote Past Imperfective====
This tense is formed with the tense-marker ''-nka-''. There are tones on ''nká'' and on the penultimate: ''ndinkáthandíza'' "I was helping/ used to help". It refers to events of yesterday or earlier.&lt;ref name="Kiso 2012, p. 127"/&gt; Since the Past Imperfective with ''-ma-'' can be used of both near and remote events, whereas ''-nka-'' can be used only for remote ones, the ''-nka-'' tense is perhaps less commonly used.

This tense is used for both habitual events in the distant past, and progressive events in the distant past:
*''Chaká chátha '''ankápítá''' kusukúlu, koma chaká chino amángokhála.''&lt;ref name=Sal76&gt;Salaun (1993), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Last year he used to go to school, but this year he just stays at home."
*'''''Ndinkáyéndá''' m'nkhalangó''.&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"I was walking in the forest."

The tense-marker ''-nká-'', which is pronounced with two syllables, is possibly derived from the verb ''muká'' or ''mká'' 'go'.&lt;ref&gt;Scott &amp; Hetherwick (1929), s.v. ''Nka''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future tenses===
====Perfective futures====
=====Present Simple as future=====
The Present Simple, as noted above, is often used for events in the near or immediate future:&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Ndíyimba''' fóni ndikafika.''&lt;br /&gt;"I'll give you a ring when I arrive."

Usually it refers to events of today, but it can also be used for tomorrow or even later times:&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Tíkúmana''' máwa.''&lt;br /&gt;"We'll meet tomorrow."
*''Máwa '''úkhala''' bwino. Ndikulónjeza.''&lt;br /&gt;"You'll be fine tomorrow, I promise."

The negative of this tense has a single tone on the penultimate syllable:
*''Ine '''sindipíta''' kuukwati.''&lt;br /&gt;"I'm not going to go to the wedding."

=====''-dzá-''=====
For events in a "general or more distant future (not today)"&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; the Future Tense with ''-dza-'' is used.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kiso (2012), pp. 131ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Some dialects put a tone on the first two syllables (e.g. ''ndídzáthándiza'' "I will help");&lt;ref&gt;cf. Mtenje (1987), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; more frequently authors report a tone on ''-dza-'' only (''ndidzáthandiza'')&lt;ref&gt;cf. Stevick et al. (1965), p. 95; Maxson (2011), p. 41; Kanerva (1990), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The tone of ''-dza-'' may spread. In the negative, as with most negative future tenses, there is a single tone on the penultimate: ''sindidzathandíza'' "I won't help".&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1987), pp. 183f.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Tsíkú lá Válentine '''ndidzápita''' kuófesi.''&lt;br /&gt;"On Valentine's day I shall go to the office."
*''Ife '''sitidzamuiwála'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"We will not forget him."

=====''-ká-''=====
Another future tense is formed with ''-ka-'', with the same tones as ''-dza-''. It usually refers to events in the near future. Maxson characterises this tense as follows: "The sense sometimes seems to be that the action will take place in relation to or dependent on something else. It might presuppose an unspoken conditional clause."&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Contingent Future" was suggested by Henry (1891), as opposed to the ''-dza-'' Future, which he called the "Indefinite Future".&lt;ref&gt;See Kiso (2012), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Mukándípezá''' kuntchíto.''&lt;br /&gt;"You'll find me at work (when you come)."
*''Makíyi '''mukáwápezá''' ndí álónda.''&lt;br /&gt;"You'll find the keys with the security guards (if you go there)." 
*''Mwína '''akándithandiza'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"Perhaps he'll help me (if I ask him)."

The future tense-marker ''-ka-'' is not to be confused with the aspect-marker ''-ka-'' "go and", which can be used combined with various tenses,&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 115; Salaun (1993), p. 44; Kiso (2012), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; for example:
*'''''Ndikátenga''' pa bánki.''&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2016), s.v. "-ka-".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I'll go and get it from the bank."

====Imperfective futures====
=====''-zi-''=====
Another future tense can be made with the tense-marker ''-zi-'', with tones on the initial syllable and penultimate. This usually refers to a situation in the near future, and has an imperfective meaning:
*''Sitíma '''ízinyamúka'''.''&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The train will be leaving soon."

In the negative, the tones are on ''-zi-'' and on the penultimate syllable:
*'''''Sazíyimírá'''nsó Maláwi.''&lt;br /&gt;"He will not be representing Malawi again."

In some dialects, ''-zi-'' in this tense and the Imperfect Subjunctive becomes ''-dzi-''.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Mapanje (1983), p. 142.; Stevick et al. (1965), p. 240, 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''-zidza-''=====
The ''-zidza-'' Future is an imperfective tense referring to events that will regularly take place in the distant future.&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; The tones are on the initial syllable (which may spread) and the penultimate:&lt;ref&gt;Mapanje (1983), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Idzákhala ntchító yánji? '''Ndízidzalandírá''' ndaláma zingáti?''&lt;br /&gt;"What sort of work will it be? How much money will I be getting?"

The tense-marker ''-zika-'' is sometimes used in place of ''-zidza-'', perhaps with the implication that the events will take place elsewhere:&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p. 138f.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Tízíkádya''' maúngu.''&lt;ref name=Map142&gt;Mapanje (1983), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"We will be going to eat pumpkins."

=====''-madza-''=====
Another tense referring to events in the distant future is ''-madza-'', which means "it will usually happen". The tones are on the initial and penultimate syllables:
*''Munthu wódzítukumúla ndí wódzíthémbá tsíkú líná '''ámadzamutsítsa'''.''&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2016), s.v. "-dzithemba'".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"When a person is arrogant and overconfident it will usually happen that one day he will be brought down to earth."
*''Chówúlúká chímakhála ndí tsíkú limódzi lomwé '''chímadzatéra'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"Something that flies generally has one day when it will usually happen that it will come down to land."

===Potential tenses===
====Present Potential====
The Present Potential is made with the tense-marker ''-nga-'' and the final vowel ''-e-''. It is toneless, unless the verb-stem itself has a tone.&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The negative has tones on the tense-marker and penultimate: ''sindingáthandíze'' "I can't help"; there is an alternative pronunciation: ''síndíngathandíze''.&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although sometimes referring to the present, this tense more often refers to something that might happen in the future. It can be translated "can", "could", "may", or "might":&lt;ref&gt;Salaun (1993), p. 74; Maxson (2011), pp. 156f; Katsonga-Woodward (2012), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Kodí '''mungandíthandize'''?''&lt;br /&gt;"Could you help me?"
*'''''Ndingabwereké'''ko njíngá yánû?''&lt;br /&gt;"Could I borrow your bike?"
*''Yendetsani bwino njingá, '''mungagunde''' mténgo.''&lt;br /&gt;"Ride the bike carefully, in case you crash into a tree."
*''Ndikuópa kutí '''angandímenye'''.''&lt;ref&gt;Katsonga-Woodward (2012), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I am scared that he might hit me."
*'''''Sindingávomerézé''' ziménezo.''&lt;ref&gt;For tones of the negative, see Downing &amp; Mtenje (2017), p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I can't agree to that."

Frequently this tense is used with the verb ''-tha'' "be able":
*'''''Mungathe''' kupítá kwánu.''&lt;br /&gt;"You can go home."

The aspect-marker ''-dza-'' can be added to this tense: ''angadzáthandize'' "he might one day help".

In conditional clauses referring to a hypothetical situation in the future, ''-nga-'' can mean "would". (See below.)

====Perfect Conditional====
This tense is made with ''-kada-'', ''-kana-'', or ''-daka-''. There is a tone on the second syllable of the tense-marker, which is often also found in the negative (''síndíkadáthandiza'' or ''síndikadathandíza'' "I would not have helped"). The meaning is "I would have done", "I could have done".&lt;ref name=Sal72&gt;Salaun (1993), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Ndikadáthandiza'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"I would have helped."

Sometimes the aspect-marker ''-ma-'' is added to this tense to make it imperfective: ''ndikanámathandíza'' "I would be helping; I could be helping". The aspect markers ''-ka-'' and ''-dza-'' may also be added: ''ndikadádzáthándiza'' "I would have helped later".
*''Adádziŵa kutí ngati chílichonsé chíkadachitíka, '''zikadádzámúvuta'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"He knew that if anything had happened, it would have caused him problems later."

Further information is given under Conditional Clauses below.

===Subjunctive mood===
====Present Subjunctive====
The Present Subjunctive has no tense-marker; the final vowel changes to ''-e'', which has a tone: ''ndithandizé'' "I should help". When an object-marker is added to the subjunctive, there is another tone following the object-marker, e.g. ''mundifótokozeré'' "please explain to me". In shorter verbs the tones are: ''mundithándízé'' "please help me", ''mundipátse'' "please give me", ''muzídye'' "please eat them".&lt;ref&gt;Mtenje (1995), p. 7; Stevick et al. (1965), p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

The Subjunctive usually expresses "either an order, or a wish, or an invitation to do something."&lt;ref&gt;Salaun (1993), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be a polite form of the imperative, or be used as the imperative of the 3rd person, or make suggestions for the 1st person:
*'''''Mundipátse'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"Please give it to me."&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Abweré''' msánga!''&lt;br /&gt;"Let him come at once!" (an order, not permission).
*'''''Tipité''' kuti?''&lt;br /&gt;"Where should we go?"

When the aspect-marker ''-ká-'' or ''-dzá-'' is added, there are tones on ''-ka-'' and the penultimate:
*'''''Tikásambíre'''!'' &lt;br /&gt;"Let's go and swim!"

The negative, which has the negative-marker ''-sa-'' after the subject-marker, has a single tone on the penultimate:&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Asabwéré''' máwa.''&lt;ref name=Max133&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"He shouldn't come tomorrow."

The Subjunctive can also be used in various subordinate clause constructions, for example to express purpose or a wish or an indirect command:
*''Ndinámubwereká njingá kutí '''afiké''' msánga.''&lt;ref&gt;Salaun (1993), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I lent him the bicycle so that he would arrive quickly."
*''Ndífuna '''mubweré''' máwa.''&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I want you to come tomorrow."
*''Tinawáúzá (kutí) '''agoné'''.''&lt;ref&gt;Scotton &amp; Orr (1980), vol 2, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"We told them to sleep." (lit. "that they should sleep")

Other clauses where the Subjunctive can be used are those where the meaning is "such as", and, as an alternative to an Infinitive, after ''m'maló mótí'' "instead of":
*''Sindipezá ntháwi yótí '''ndichezé''' náye.''&lt;ref&gt;Salaun (1993), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"I won't have time to chat with him." (lit. "such as I may chat")
*''M'maló mótí '''akonzé''' njíngá, waíwononga kweníkwéní.''&lt;ref&gt;Salaun (1993), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Instead of mending the bicycle, he has completely broken it."

It can also be used, with the relative clause intonation, after ''ngati'' "if" and ''ngakhále'' "even if" when the meaning is "if it should be the case that...":&lt;ref&gt;Scotton &amp; Orr (1980), vol. 2, p. 180; Salaun (1993), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Ndípita ngakhále mvúla '''ígwe''' kapená ayí.''&lt;br /&gt;"I'll go whether it rains or not."
*''Ngati '''múkondé''' nyímboyi...''&lt;br /&gt;"If you like this song..."

====Imperfective Subjunctive====
An imperfective form of the Subjunctive is made by adding the tense-marker ''-zi-''. There are tones on ''-zi-'' and on the penultimate. The final vowel is ''-a'': ''ndizíthandíza'' "I should be helping".

This tense can express an obligation that should be carried out regularly or at all times, or as a "habit or general requirement":&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), pp. 134, 135, 136.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Muzílemekézá''' makóló anú.'' &lt;br /&gt;"You must (always) respect your parents."

Just as with the ordinary subjunctive, it can also be used in purpose clauses after ''kutí'' "that":&lt;ref name=Sal76 /&gt;
*''Fóni ndidágula kutí '''ndizílumikizáná''' ndí anzánga.'' &lt;br /&gt;"I bought the phone so that I could be keeping in touch with my friends."

Another of its uses is to express a "strong obligation equivalent to an order" (Salaun):&lt;ref name=Sal76 /&gt;
*''Munthuyo '''azípítá''' kwáwo.'' &lt;br /&gt;"That man should go home!"

This tense has no negative. As with the Imperfective Future, in some regions ''-zi-'' can be replaced with ''-dzi-''.

====''-ba-'' Subjunctive====
Another kind of subjunctive, much less common than the two described above, is a tense with the aspect-marker ''-ba-'' (pronounced ''-baa-'' and with tones similar to the remote past tense),&lt;ref&gt;Mchombo (2004), p. 32; Mtenje (1987) p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; which means "while waiting for something else to happen":&lt;ref name=Sal76 /&gt;
*''Mphunzitsi sanafíke; '''tíbâkasewéra'''''.&lt;br /&gt;"The teacher hasn't come yet; let's go and play meanwhile."

It seems possible that ''-ba-'' has developed by contraction from the construction ''yamba'' "begin" plus the Perfect participle described above.

====''-ta-'' Subjunctive====
A form of the verb with ''-ta-'' can be used to express sentences of the kind "Let me do it" or "May I do it", referring to an action which the speaker would like to see done at once.&lt;ref name=Sal76 /&gt; There is a tone on the syllable after ''-ta-'':
*'''''Nditaóna'''!''&lt;br /&gt;"Let me see!"
*'''''Nditakúfunsáni''' chinthu chimódzi.''&lt;br /&gt;"Let me ask you one thing."

These same three prefixes, ''zi-'', ''ba-'', and ''ta-'' can also be added to the Imperative, with similar meanings (see below).

===Imperative===
====Basic Imperative====
The imperative is the command form of the verb. In Chichewa its basic form consists of the verb stem and final vowel ''-a''. The suffix ''-ni'' is added to make it plural or more respectful.&lt;ref&gt;Salaun (1993), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The imperative is toneless unless the verb-stem itself has a tone:
*'''''Gula'''!''&lt;br /&gt;"Buy!"
*'''''Pitani''' bwino!'' &lt;br /&gt;"Go well!" (plural or respectful) (root ''pita'')
*'''''Tsalání''' bwino!''&lt;br /&gt;"Stay well!" (root ''tsalá'')

If the verb-stem is monosyllabic, however, such as ''-dya'' "eat", a supporting ''i-'' is added before it: 
*'''''Idya'''!'' (plural '''''idyani'''!'')&lt;br /&gt;"Eat!"

An idiom "very widespread" among Bantu languages, according to [[A. E. Meeussen|Meeussen]],&lt;ref&gt;Meeussen (1967), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; is that if a series of commands is given, usually only the first is imperative, the second and third being subjunctive:
*'''''Tulutsani''' ndaláma, muyiké pansí muzípítá!''&lt;br /&gt;"Take out your money, put it on the ground, and be off!"

====Imperative with object-marker====
If an object-marker is added to the Imperative, the final vowel changes to ''-e'', and the tones are similar to those in the Subjunctive, that is, the tone of the object-marker goes on the syllable which follows, and there is a second tone on the final ''-e'':&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), pp. 220f; Salaun (1993), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Ndithándízéni'''!''&lt;br /&gt;"Help me!"

But in verbs of one or two syllables, there is a single tone on the penultimate:
*'''''Ndipátse'''!'' (or simply '''''pátse'''!'')&lt;ref name="Salaun 1993, p. 77"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Give me!"
*'''''Ídye'''!''&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Eat it!"

The Imperative can be made less direct by adding the suffix ''-ko'',&lt;ref name="Salaun 1993, p. 77"/&gt; which puts a tone on the syllable before it:
*'''''Pátseníko'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"Give me some please."

====Imperative with other prefixes====
The Imperative can also take the aspect-markers ''-ka-'' "go and" and ''-dza-'' "come and". In this case although ''-ka-'' and ''-dza-'' are toneless, the final vowel becomes ''-e'' with a tone:
*'''''Kaitané''' mnzáko.''&lt;br /&gt;"Go and call your friend."
*'''''Dzaonéni'''!''&lt;br /&gt;"Come and see!"

''-Ngo-'' "just" can also be added, with the supporting vowel ''i''. In this case the final vowel is ''-a'' and there is a tone on the syllable after ''-ngo-'':
*'''''Ingobwérani'''!''&lt;br /&gt;"Just come!"

Like the Subjunctive, the Imperative can have the prefixes ''ta-'',  ''ba-'' "meanwhile", and ''zi-'' (imperfective).&lt;ref name=Sal76 /&gt; ''-Ta-'' is fairly common and is used when the speaker wishes something to be done straightaway.&lt;ref name=Max133 /&gt; It puts a tone on the following syllable:
*'''''Tabwéra'''!'' &lt;br /&gt;"Please come (now)!"

''Ba-'' (pronounced ''baa'') and ''zi-'' put a tone on the penultimate syllable (not counting the plural suffix ''-ni''). These are less commonly used:
*'''''Baothérani''' dzúwa.''&lt;br /&gt;"Carry on warming yourselves in the sun (while I fetch the teacher)."
*'''''Ziweréngani'''!''&lt;br /&gt;"Keep on reading."

====Negative Imperative====
To make a negative command, either the negative subjunctive is used or a form (derived from the negative Infinitive) starting with ''ósa-'' (with tones on ''o-'' and the penultimate):&lt;ref name="Salaun 1993, p. 77"/&gt;
*'''''Musádye''' nthochízo.''&lt;br /&gt;"Don't eat those bananas."
*'''''Ósadyá''' nthochízo.''&lt;br /&gt;"Don't eat those bananas."

Adding the aspect-marker ''-ma-'' to either of these gives the meaning "don't keep on doing...". The final vowel is usually ''-e'':&lt;ref&gt;Although cf. Maxson (2011), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Usamáchíté''' zópúsa!''&lt;ref name="Salaun 1993, p. 77"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Don't keep on doing stupid things!"

===Tenses of "to be"===
There are several verbs used for expressing different tenses of the verb "to be".

====''-li''====
The verb ''-li'' is used mainly for temporary states and for location:&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 107f.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Ali''' bwino.''&lt;br /&gt;"He's fine."
*'''''Alí''' kuti?''&lt;ref&gt;For the tone, Stevick et al. (1965), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Where is he?"

It is irregular and has very few tenses. These are:&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), pp. 110f.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Present: &lt;br /&gt;'''''ndili''''' "I am" (toneless)
*Recent Past: &lt;br /&gt;'''''ndinalí''''' "I was"
*Remote Past: &lt;br /&gt;'''''ndínaalí''''' or '''''ndídaalí''''' "I was"
*Persistive: &lt;br /&gt;'''''ndikadalí''''' ('''''ndikalí''''') "I am still"
*Present Participial: &lt;br /&gt;'''''ndíli''''' "while I am", "while I was"
*Persistive Participial: &lt;br /&gt;'''''ndíkádalí''''' (or '''''ndíkalí''''') "while I am still", "while I was still"

Some authors describing Southern Region Chichewa write tones '''''ndináli''''' for the Remote Past,&lt;ref&gt;Mapanje (1983), p. 141; Stevick et al.(1965), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps a regional variation.

In this verb there is no distinction between perfective and imperfective.&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Past Imperfective with ''-ma-'', the tense ''-na-lí'' can be used equally of situations of today or of the remote past:
*''Dzíko lápánsílo '''linálí''' lópándá maonekedwe''.&lt;br /&gt;"The earth was without form." (Genesis 1:2, 1998 translation)

Negative forms also exist except for the persistive tense: ''síndili'' "I am not", ''síndinalí'' "I was not", ''ndísalí'' "without my being".&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 206; Maxson, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''''Sáli''' ku Lilongwe.''&lt;br /&gt;"They are not in Lilongwe."

There is also an applied form ending in ''-lílí'' used in phrases of manner:&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2016), s.v. "-lili", "momwe", "umo".&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Momwé '''ndílílí'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"The way I am".

The phrase ''ndili ndí'' (lit. "I am with") means "I have". The negative is ''ndilíbe'' "I do not have".&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 105; Stevick et al. (1965), p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Ndili ndí''' áná awíri.''&lt;br /&gt;"I have two children."
*'''''Ndilíbé''' aná.''&lt;br /&gt;"I don't have any children."

The forms ''kuli'', ''pali'', ''muli'' mean "there is". The negative is ''kulíbe'', ''palíbe'', ''mulíbe'' "there isn't":&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Mulíbé''' ndaláma m'gálímoto.''&lt;br /&gt;"There is no money in the car."

These forms can be strengthened to ''-liko'', ''-lipo'', ''-limo''. Of these, ''-lipo'' is the most common:&lt;ref&gt;Salaun (1993), p. 16f.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Kodí bambo '''alípo'''?'' – ''Ĭnde, '''alípo'''.'' / ''Ayí, palíbe.''&lt;br /&gt;"Is your father here?" – "Yes, he is." / "No, he isn't here."

====''ndi''====
Another word for expressing "is" or "are" is ''ndi'' (negative ''sí''), used in the present tense only. This word is used for permanent states or identity:&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 108; Salaun (1993), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Madzí '''ndi''' ófúniká.''&lt;br /&gt;"Water is important."
*''Kuyéndá usíku '''sí''' bwino.''&lt;br /&gt;"Walking at night isn't good."
*''Búku liméné lílí pathébulo '''ndi''' lánga.''&lt;ref&gt;Salaun (1993), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The book which is on the table is mine."

The toneless ''ndi'' "is" is to be distinguished from ''ndí'' "with", "and", which has a tone.&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2016), s.v. "ndi".&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ndi'' can have pronominal endings attached to it, e.g. ''ndine'' "I am", ''ndiwe'' "you are". The first and second persons are toneless; all the other endings have a tone, e.g. ''ndiwó'' "they are":&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), pp. 160, 161, 163, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Ine '''ndine''' mphunzitsi.''&lt;br /&gt;"I am a teacher."
*'''''Síndine''' mphunzitsi.''&lt;br /&gt;"I am not a teacher."
*''Ichi '''ndichó''' chímavúta.''&lt;br /&gt;"This is what causes problems."

''Ndi'' has no past tense, so the past tense of ''-li'' is used instead:&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Ndinálí''' (ndínalí) mphunzitsi''.&lt;br /&gt;"I was a teacher."
*''Nyumbá '''ínalí''' yáíkúlu.''&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The house was a big one."

====''-khala''====
For all other tenses of "to be", including the Immediate Future, Future, Perfect, Infinitive, Subjunctive, Imperative, and so on, the verb ''-khala'' ("sit" or "stay") is used:&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Khalani''' chete.''&lt;ref&gt;Louw (1987), vol. 3, s.v. "chete".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Be quiet!"
*'''''Tidzákhala''' ndí áná.''&lt;ref&gt;Salaun (1993), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"We will have children."
*''Máwa '''úkhala''' bwino.''&lt;br /&gt;"You'll be OK tomorrow."

==The Infinitive==
The Infinitive is formed with the prefix ''ku-'', which is proclitic, that is, it puts a tone on the syllable following itself: ''kuthándiza'' "to help". The negative is made by adding ''-sa-'' after ''-ku-'', and has a single tone on the penultimate: ''kusathandíza'' "not to help".

===Ordinary uses of the Infinitive===
The Infinitive can be used as the subject of a verb, in which case it is translated as a gerund:
*'''''Kusúta''' kúmaonóngá moyo.''&lt;br /&gt;"Smoking damages the health."

It can also be the object of verbs such as "want", "be able", "like", "know how to" and so on:
*''Ndikufúna '''kupíta'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"I want to go."
*''Sindíthá '''kubwéra'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"I can't come."
*''Ndímadzíwa '''kuchítá''' táipi.''&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I know how to type."

With the infix ''-ka-'' or ''-dza-'' the Infinitive can be used to express purpose, following a verb of going or coming respectively:&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 33, pp. 94ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Ndikupítá kunyumbá '''kukáchápá''' zôvála.''&lt;br /&gt;"I am going home to wash some clothes."
*''Ndabwera '''kudzákúonáni'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"I have come to see you."

But ''-dza-'' with the Infinitive can also simply have a future meaning, referring to an event or situation in the distant future:&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2016), s.v. "dza".&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Síndíkufúna '''kudzákhálá''' ndí áná ámbíri.''&lt;br /&gt;"I don't want to have a lot of children (lit. to be in future with a lot of children)."

Another idiomatic use of the Infinitive is to represent the second of two verbs in the same tense which have the same subject. The Infinitive is preceded by ''ndí'' "and" (or after a negative ''koma'' "but").&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), pp. 302, 306; Salaun (1993), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''ndí'' is often shortened to ''ń''':
*''Anthu ámakolóla chímanga ndí '''kúócha'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"People harvest maize and roast it."
*''Aná sámápita ku sukúlu koma '''kumáthandízá''' azibambo áwo.''&lt;br /&gt;"The children don't go to school but help their parents."
*''Mbavazi zidáthyola polísi '''ń'kúményá''' ápólísi.''&lt;br /&gt;"These thieves broke into a police station and beat up the policemen."
*''Ndimabá gálímoto '''ń'kúmákagulítsa''' ku Mozambíque.''&lt;br /&gt;"I used to steal cars and go and sell them in Mozambique."

There was formerly another idiom of using the prefix ''na-'', ''ni-'' or ''nu-'' (depending on the class concord) to represent the second of two past or perfect tenses; however, it is not much used in modern Chichewa:
*''Ánagwá panjingá '''náthyóká''' mwendo.''&lt;ref&gt;Salaun (1993), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"He fell from his bike and broke his leg."

Sometimes the Infinitive can be used as a tense in its own right, to represent actions happening right now:&lt;ref&gt;cf. also Kiso (2012), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Wájabu '''kulándíra''' mpira, '''kudyétsá''' njomba, ndí '''kúpátsira''' Keegan.''&lt;ref&gt;Mapanje (1983), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"Wajabu gets the ball, dribbles it, and passes to Keegan."

The Infinitive can also follow the preposition ''pa'' "on", which combines with ''ku'' to make ''po-'' (with a low tone):&lt;ref&gt;Salaun (1993), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Ndavutiká '''pobwérá''' kuno.''&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I have had difficulty in getting here."

===Adjectival Infinitive===
The Infinitive is frequently combined with ''á'' "of" to make a verbal adjective or adverb. The syllables ''á'' and ''ku'' usually merge to become a high-toned ''ó'', except when the verb is monosyllabic, when they usually remain separate. Thus ''ákuthándiza'' "of helping" is shortened to ''óthándiza'', but ''ákúbá'' "of stealing" remains unshortened. Since ''á'' "of" changes to ''wá'', ''yá'', ''chá'' etc. according to the noun it refers to, the verbal adjective changes similarly.&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), pp. 91-5; Scotton &amp; Orr (1980), vol. 2, pp. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently this form of the Infinitive is used as an adjective or adjectival participle:
*''Njira '''yôpítá''' ku Mwanzá.''&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965) p. 96; p. 209; tones, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"The road going (which goes) to Mwanza."
*''Ndinu '''ókwátira'''?''&lt;ref&gt;cf. Stevick et al. (1965) p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Are you married?"
*''Njingá '''yókóngola'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"A beautiful bicycle."

It can also be used as a noun, with the noun it agrees with understood:
*'''''Zôvála'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"Clothes." (lit. "(things) of wearing")
*'''''Ákúbá'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"Thieves." (lit. "(people) of stealing")
*'''''Pótúlukira'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"Exit." (lit. "(place) of going out")
*'''''Wóyéndetsa''' gálímoto.''&lt;br /&gt;"The driver of the car." (lit. "(the person) of driving the car")

Another use is in combination with the prefix ''mwá-'', contracted to ''mó-'', to make an adverb:&lt;ref&gt;Salaun (1993), p. 69; Maxson (2011), pp. 171f.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Mófúlumira'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"Rapidly (lit. "in (a manner) of hurrying")
*'''''Mósafulumíra'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"Without any haste."

The prefix ''pó-'' (with a high tone) can also sometimes be used as an adverb:&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Pósachédwa'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"Soon" (lit. "at (a time) of not being late")
*'''''Pósachédwapa'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"A short time ago."

The verb ''ganiza'' "think" combined with the ''zó-'' form of the Infinitive is a common way of saying "decide to":&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2016), s.v. "ganiza".&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Ndináganiza '''zópíta''' kupolísi.''&lt;br /&gt;"I decided to go to the police."

The negative Infinitive with ''ósa-'' has various uses:
*As a command: '''''Ósalówa'''.'' "Do not enter."
*As an adverb: '''''Ósazindikíra'''.'' "Without realising."
*As a noun: '''''Ósaóna'''.'' "Blind people."

The word ''ósatí'' (from the irregular verb ''-ti'' "say") is frequently used to mean "not":&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 210; Kanerva (1990), p. 140; Paas (2016), s.v. "osati".&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Akázi '''ósatí''' amúna.''&lt;br /&gt;"Women, not men."

==Tenses in subordinate clauses==
===Participial tenses===
These tenses occur only in dependent clauses. They generally have relative clause intonation, that is, with a high tone on the subject-marker. In their usage they resemble participles in European languages, but differ from them in that they have a personal subject.&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), pp. 85-87&lt;/ref&gt;

====Present Participial (''-ku-'')====
This tense is resembles a present participle in meaning: ''ndíkúthándiza'' "while (I am/was) helping". It is formed like the Present Continuous, but with a tone on the first syllable as well as the third (the two tones link into a plateau). It can refer to the subject, object, or another noun in the sentence:&lt;ref name="Maxson 2011, p. 85"&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Ndíkúyénda''' ndinaóná munthu '''ákúkwérá''' mténgo.''&lt;br /&gt;"While I was walking I saw a man climbing a tree."

The verb ''-li'' is again an exception, since in this tense it has no ''-ku-'', but merely a tone on the first syllable:&lt;ref name="Maxson 2011, p. 86"&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Amadwála kwámbíri '''áli''' mwaná.''&lt;br /&gt;"He was very sick when he was a child."

A negative of this tense is sometimes found, made with the negative-marker ''-sa-'', which follows the subject-marker:&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2016), s.v. "without"&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Ásakuzíndikira'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"Without his realising."

The negative is often replaced by the negative verbal adjective starting with ''ósa-'': ''ósazindikíra'' "without realising".

====Persistive Present Participial (''-kada-'')====
The Persistive Present with ''-kada-'' etc. can also be used in a dependent form, especially with the verb ''-li''.&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2016), s.v. "-li'', "when".&lt;/ref&gt; In this case there is also a tone on the initial syllable:
*''Ndidáyamba '''ndíkadalí''' ku sukúlu.'' &lt;br /&gt;"I began when I was still at school."

A frequent use is in the phrase ''pákádalí pano'' "at the present time" (lit. "it still being now").&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''Sákupézéká '''pákádalí''' pano.''&lt;br /&gt;"He is not available at present."

====Past Participial (''-ta-'')====
This tense is formed in the same way, but with ''-ta-'' instead of ''-ku-''.&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), pp. 87; Stevick et al. (1965), p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning is usually "after doing something":
*'''''Átádzúka''', anapítá kumsika.''&lt;br /&gt;"After getting up, she went to the market."
*''Anatípézá '''títáchóka'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"When he arrived we had already left." (lit. "He found us having left.")&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Tidzátha ntchítoyi inu '''mútáchóka'''.''&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"We will finish this work after you've left."

However, it can also be used with the meaning "when" of an event simultaneous with the main verb:
*'''''Átáfíká''' kunyumbá dzulo, ánalí wótópa kwámbíri.''&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"When he arrived home yesterday, he was very tired."

Combined with the aspect-marker ''-ngo-'', it can mean "as soon as":&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2016), s.v. "-tango-".&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Átángofíka'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"As soon as he arrived" / "No sooner had he arrived than..."

It can also be combined with the verbs ''-li'' and ''khala'' "be" to make compound tenses:
*''Ndítábwérá kumudzi '''ánalí átálémba''' makálata awíri.''&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"When I arrived home, (I found that) he had written two letters."
*''Ntháwi iméneyo anthu '''ámakhála átáthá''' kusósa.''&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"At this time of year people have generally finished clearing the fields."

Another idiomatic use is after the word ''n'kutí'' in sentences such as the following:&lt;ref name="Paas 2016, s.v. -ta-"&gt;Paas (2016), s.v. "-ta-".&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Ntháwiyi n'kutí '''átádyá''' kálé.''&lt;br /&gt;"By this time he had already eaten."
*''Pantháwiyi n'kutí anzáke ónse '''átákwátiwa'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"By this time all her friends had already got married."

Often the Past Participial tense is used following a verb of wishing, especially when the thing wished for is unrealisable:&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2016), s.v. -lakalaka&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Amalákalaka '''átákhála''' ngati mnzáke.''&lt;br /&gt;"He wished he could be like his friend."

Another use is in conditional sentences (see below).

It appears from Watkins (1937) that the tense-marker ''-ta-'' derives from a compound tense formed with the verb ''-ti'' "say" which has fused into a single verb. Thus ''átákhúta'' "after his hunger was satisfied" derives from an earlier ''wátí wákhúta''.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins (1937), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Negative Past Participial (''-sana-'')====
The opposite of ''-ta-'' is ''-sana-'' or ''-sada-'', which means "not yet having done", i.e. "before doing". It can be used of past or future time:
*''Akufúna kudzálá mbéwu mvúlá '''ísanabwére'''.''&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"He wants to plant the seed before the rain comes."
*''Dzulo madzuló ndídâkagóna achimwené '''ásanabwére'''.''&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Last night I had gone to bed before my brother came."
*''Ádalí '''ásadakwatíre'''.&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2016), s.v. "not yet".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"He had not yet married."

It can also mean "since":
*''Papita ntháwi '''tísanaténgé''' chikho.''&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2016), s.v. "kwapita".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"It's been a while since we won the cup." (lit. "time has gone our not having taken the cup")
*''Patenga ntháwitú '''ndísadamuóne'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"It's been a long time indeed since I saw him."

====Relative clause intonation of Perfect====
The relative clause intonation of the Perfect Simple has a tone on the first syllable (which may link or spread) and another on the penultimate (which may shift). As well as being used in relative, conditional, and concessive clauses, it also has several other idiomatic uses in some of which is resembles a participial tense.

It may be used as an adjective:&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Chaká '''chátha'''.''&lt;ref&gt;Mapanje (1983), p. 196; Stevick et al. (1965), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Last year (lit. the year which has finished)."
*''Mwezí '''wápítá'''yo.''&lt;br /&gt;"Last month (lit. that month which has gone)."

It can also be used as a noun, with the noun it describes being understood:
*'''''Wámwálíra'''yo'' (or '''''wámwálirá'''yo'').&lt;br /&gt;"The deceased (person)."
*'''''Wákhálá''' pampando ndaní?''&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2016), s.v. "ndani".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The (person) sitting on the chair is who?"
*'''''Mwátsékulá'''yi ndi Z.B.S.''&lt;ref&gt;Zodiak Radio call sign.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This (radio station) which you have opened is Z.B.S.", i.e. "You are listening to Z.B.S."

Thirdly it can be used in a construction with any tense of the verb ''yamba'' "begin" to mean "begin by doing":&lt;ref&gt;Salaun (1993), p. 71; for the tones, Watkins (1937), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Muyambé '''wákónzá''' njingá.''&lt;br /&gt;"Begin by repairing the bicycle / First repair the bicycle."

===Other clauses of time===
Adverbial clauses of time (temporal clauses) are clauses such as those which begin with "when" or "after". One way of making them is to use a participial verb, as described above. But there are also other ways of expressing time, as follows.

====''-ka-''====
The tense ''-ka-'', which is toneless, refers to a possibility, usually in the future. It can be translated "when" or "if":&lt;ref name="Maxson 2011, p. 86"/&gt;
*''Ndíyimba fóni '''ndikafika'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"I'll ring when I get there."
*'''''Ndikamúsíyá''' ádzádwalánso.''&lt;br /&gt;"If I leave him, he'll get sick again."

Sometimes ''-ka-'' is used in the place of ''-kama-'' to refer to a past habitual situation:&lt;ref&gt;Kiso (2012), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Akalandira''' ndaláma amagúlira msúngwana mphátso.''&lt;br /&gt;"Whenever he received money, he used to buy the girl a present."

====''-kadza-''====
The same tense with ''-kadza-'' refers to a time "far in the future":&lt;ref&gt;Katsonga-Woodward (2012), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Ndikadzálemera''' ndidzágula nyumbá yáíkúlu.''&lt;br /&gt;"When I get rich I shall buy a big house."

====''-kama-''====
This tense means "if ever" or "whenever" and unlike ''-ka-'' it refers to past or present time according to context. The tones are on ''-ma-'' and the penultimate syllable:
*'''''Ukamándilankhúla''' úmandisangalátsa.''&lt;ref name="Maxson 2011, p. 88"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Whenever you talk to me, you make me happy."
*''Ntháwi zónse '''akamákwérá''' bási, iyé ankásánkhá yomwé íli ndí chóyímbira chábwino.''&lt;br /&gt;"Whenever he used to get on a bus, he would always choose one with a good music system."

To refer to a situation in the future, the aspect-marker ''-dza-'' can be added:
*''Adámúuza  kutí '''akamádzadútsá''' pá Chitákálé adzáyímé pa nyumbá yáké.''&lt;br /&gt;"She told him that if ever he were passing through Chitakale he should stop by at her house."

===="When" (''paméne'')====
Another way of expressing a temporal clause is to use ''paméne''  or ''m'méne'' "when", which are followed by the relative clause intonation of the verb. If two events happened or are going to happen at the same time, the Chichewa idiom is that the verb in the "when" clause usually uses an imperfective tense, as in the examples below:
*''Amavála paméné '''ndímálówa'''''.&lt;ref&gt;Ngoma &amp; Chauma (2011), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"He was getting dressed when I entered (lit. was entering)."
*''Ndídalí ndítádyá paméné '''ánkafíka'''.''&lt;ref&gt;Chibambo (2008), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I had already eaten when he arrived (lit. was arriving)."
*''Jóni amapámbana mjahowo paméné '''ámákómóká'''.''&lt;ref&gt;Mapanje (1983), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"John was winning the race when he fainted (lit. was fainting)."
*''Ádzákhala átásósa paméné mvúla '''ízidzayámba'''.''&lt;ref name=Chi59&gt;Chibambo (2008), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"He will have finished clearing the field by the time the rain starts (lit. will be starting)."

However, other tenses are possible; for example, the following uses a form of the Subjunctive with ''-dza-'':
*''Mudzákhala mútádyá paméné '''ndídzafíké''' kwánu.''&lt;ref name=Chi59 /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You will have eaten by the time I get to your house."

===="Since"====
A way of expressing "since" is to use a nominalised form of the verb beginning with ''chi-'' and ending in ''-íre'' or ''-íreni'' (in some verbs ''-ére'' or ''-éreni''). There is a single tone on the penultimate syllable (not counting ''-ni''):
*'''''Chidzukíre''' sindinasámbe.''&lt;ref name="Maxson 2011, p. 200"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Since getting up I haven't yet had a bath."
*''Takhala ndí chisóni '''chimwalilíre''' chá abambo áthu.''&lt;ref&gt;Scotton &amp; Orr (1980), vol. 2, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same form of the verb with ''chi...-ire'' can also mean "still" or "always".&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), p. 200; Salaun (1993), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of expressing "since" is to use ''kuyámbira'' "to begin from" followed by a dependent clause verb:
*''Zonsézi ndakhala ndíkúzítsátá '''kuyámbira ndílí''' mwaná.''&lt;ref&gt;Mark 10:20 (1998 translation); cf. Kiso (2012), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"All these things I have been following since I was a child."

For a third way of expressing "since", see ''-sana-'' above.

===Conditional clauses===
Conditional clauses are those which begin with a word such as "if".

====Simple present situations====
One way of making a condition is to use the conjunction ''ngati'' "if", followed by the relative clause intonation. (This is in fact the only way conditions can be expressed with the verb ''-li''.) ''Ngati'' can also be used to make indirect questions:&lt;ref name = Sal72 /&gt;
*''Síndídziwa '''ngati álípó'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"I don't know if he's there."
*''Asapíté kumsonkhano '''ngati sáli''' bwino.''&lt;br /&gt;"He should not go to the meeting if he's not well."
*'''''Ngati múkondé''' nyímbo múmvetseréyi, sindikizani "star" kutí mugulé.''&lt;br /&gt;"If you like this music you are hearing, press * to buy it."

====Simple future situations====
A simple conditional clause about the future can be made with the toneless ''-ka-'' tense:&lt;ref name=Sal72 /&gt;
*'''''Mukakaná''' ndíkuwa.''&lt;br /&gt;"If you refuse, I shall shout."

There is no negative, but a negative meaning can be expressed with the verb ''panda'' "be without":&lt;ref name=Sal72 /&gt;
*'''''Ndikapanda''' kumúitaná sadzabwéra.''&lt;br /&gt;"If I don't invite him, he won't come."

The infix ''-dza-'' can be added to refer to the distant future:&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2016), s.v. "-dza-"&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Tikadzákufunani''' tidzákúyitanáni.''&lt;br /&gt;"If we need you at some future date, we'll call you."

====Hypothetical future situations====
The participial tense ''-ta-'' can also have the meaning "if", referring to a hypothetical situation in the future.&lt;ref name="Paas 2016, s.v. -ta-"/&gt; The main clause will often use ''-nga-'' or ''khoza'' "be able":
*'''''Pátádútsá''' munthu, ungathe kumángá buléki?''&lt;br /&gt;"If someone stepped in front of the car, could you brake in time?"
*'''''Mútáséma''' mútávála chíngachitíke n'chiyáni?''&lt;br /&gt;"If you were to cut (this root) with your clothes on, what would happen?"
*''Ngakhále '''mútákáná''' bwánji palíbé ákukhulupiriréni.''&lt;br /&gt;"Even if you were to deny it, there's no one who would believe you."

Another possibility is to use ''ndítátí'' (lit. "if I say") with the subjunctive:
*'''''Mútátí mumuóne''' mkáziyo, múkhoza kudábwa.''&lt;br /&gt;"If you were to see that lady, you might be surprised."

====Hypothetical past situations====
To make a condition about a hypothetical situation in the past, ''-kada-'' or ''-kana-'' or ''-daka-'' is used in both halves of the sentence, with the relative clause intonation in the "if" clause:&lt;ref&gt;Salaun (1993), pp. 72f.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Ákadadzíwa''' sákadáchita.''&lt;br /&gt;"If he had known, he wouldn't have done it."
*'''''Ndíkadamuitána''' akadábwera''.&lt;br /&gt;"If I had called him, he would have come."
*'''''Múkadapítá''' ku chipatala, mukadáchira msánga.''&lt;br /&gt;"If you had gone to hospital, you would have got better quickly."

The "if" clause alone can also mean "should have" or "if only":&lt;ref name=Sal72 /&gt;
*'''''Múkadandiúzá''' msánga.''&lt;br /&gt;"You should have told me at once." (lit. "if only you had told me...")
*'''''Ákadamvérá''' mawú á agógo.''&lt;br /&gt;"If only he'd listened to his grandparent's advice!" 

The same tense can be used when wishing for some past hypothetical situation:
*''Akulákalaka '''ákanabadwírá''' kwína''.&lt;br /&gt;"He wishes he'd been born somewhere else."

For a negative conditional, the verb ''-panda'' ("be without") is used in the "if" clause:
*'''''Ndíkadapánda''' kumúitaná, sákadábwera.''&lt;br /&gt;"If I hadn't called him, he wouldn't have come."

Sometimes, instead of using ''-kada-'' in the main clause, the word ''bwenzi'' "it would be the case that" or ''síbwenzi'' "it would not be the case that" is used, followed by a participial verb:&lt;ref name="Salaun 1993, p. 73"&gt;Salaun (1993), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Múkadapítá kuchipatala, '''bwenzi mútáchíra''' msánga.''&lt;br /&gt;"If you had gone to hospital, you would have got better quickly."

The following example, instead of ''-kada-'', uses the relative clause intonation of ''-li'' in the "if" clause:
*'''''Múlí''' inu, mukanátání?''&lt;br /&gt;"If it were you, what would you have done?"

====Hypothetical present situations====
Since ''-kada-'' is a perfective tense, sentences with ''-kada-'' usually refer to the past. However, sometimes if ''-khala'' is used, the reference can be to a hypothetical situation in the present:
*''Pákadapándá ine, iwe '''ukadákhala''' kuti?''&lt;ref&gt;Dossi, ''Makangano''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"If it were not for me, where would you be?"

A present situation can also be expressed with ''bwenzi'' "it would be the case that" and a Present Participial tense:
*''Ádakakhálá nyénga, '''bwenzi tíkúóna''' bweyá wáké wósósoká.''&lt;br /&gt;"If it were a mongoose (stealing the chickens), we would be seeing its torn off fur."

In some varieties of Chichewa the tense-marker ''-chi-'' can be used instead of ''-kada-'' in the "if" clause in hypothetical conditional sentences,&lt;ref name="Salaun 1993, p. 73"/&gt; but this is rare except in the word ''pachipanda'' "were it not for":&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2016), s.v. "bwenzi".&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Pachipanda''' asíng'anga síbwenzi mnyamatáyu álí ndí moyo.''&lt;br /&gt;"If it were not for the herbalist, this boy wouldn't be alive."

===Tenses in indirect statements===
In English, as in some other languages, a verb in an indirect statement usually goes into the past tense when the main verb is in the past tense. However, in Chichewa this rule does not apply and sentences such as the following, in which there is no change of tense in the dependent clause, are common:&lt;ref&gt;Maxson (2011), pp. 208-9.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Anáganiza kutí íyé '''waledzera'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"They thought that he was drunk (lit. he has become drunk)."
*''Anándíuza kutí '''sáli''' bwino.''&lt;br /&gt;"He told me that he wasn't well (lit. isn't well)."

In the same way, the participial tenses can refer to a present, past, or future situation according to the tense of the main verb which they are used:&lt;ref name="Maxson 2011, p. 85"/&gt;
*''Ndináwápeza (ndináápézá) '''ákúpémphera'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"I found them (while they were) praying." 
*''Ndingawápeze (ndingaápézé) '''átádyá'''''.&lt;br /&gt;"l might find them having already eaten."

==Compound tenses==
Compound tenses are also found in Chichewa. Among them are the following:

===Compound tenses with ''-li''===
''-li'' can be followed by an infinitive:
*'''''Ndili kumvá''' bwino.''&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I'm feeling fine."
*'''''Síndínalí kudzíwa'''.''&lt;ref&gt;Stevick et al. (1965), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I didn't know."

But a participial tense is also sometimes used:
*''Mvúla '''ídalí íkúgwábé'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"The rain was still falling."
*'''''Análi átádyá'''.''&lt;ref&gt;Mapanje (1983), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"He had already eaten."

===Compound tenses with ''-khala''===
''-khala'' is generally combined with one of the participial tenses:
*'''''Ndakhala ndíkúkúdikiríra''' kwá záká zitátu.''&lt;ref&gt;Chibambo (2008), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I have been waiting for you for three years."
*'''''Ádakhála ákúsúngira''' ndaláma kwá ntháwi yáítáli.''&lt;br /&gt;"He had been saving up money for a long time."
*'''''Tíkhala títádyá''' maúngu.''&lt;ref name=Map142 /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"We will have eaten the pumpkins.''
*'''''Mudzákhala mútádyá'''.''&lt;ref name=Chi59 /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You will have eaten.''

===Compound tenses with ''-ti''===
The verb ''-ti'' "say", followed by one of the subjunctive tenses, makes a future in the past:
*'''''Timatí tikádye''' maúngu.''&lt;ref name=Map142 /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"We were going to eat pumpkins."
*''Mméné '''ámátí adzíkwérá''' bási kondákitala adámuuuza kutí sángakwére ndí nkhúku.''&lt;br /&gt;"When he was about to get on the bus, the conductor told him that he couldn't get on with a chicken."

The literal meaning of ''timatí tikádye'' is "we were saying we should go and eat". Other ways of expressing the future in the past are to add ''-dza-'' to the Past Imperfective tense (''ndimadzáthandizá'' "I was about to help") or to use ''-funa'' "want" with the Infinitive (''ndinkáfuná kuthándiza'' "I was wanting to help").

===Compound tenses with ''-chita''===
The verb ''-chita'' "do" can be used in various tenses followed by an Infinitive, e.g.:
*'''''Ankáchitá kunénétsá'''.''&lt;ref&gt;Paas (2016), s.v. "chita".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"He used to say insistently."
*''Zikusónyeza kutí iyé '''adáchita kuphédwa'''.''&lt;br /&gt;"The indications are that she was murdered."
*''Mbátata '''síichita kufúná''' zámbíri pa ulimi wáke.''&lt;br /&gt;"Sweet potatoes don't require many things for their cultivation."

The difference in meaning, if any, between this and the simple form of the verb is not clear.

A further auxiliary verb, ''yenda'' "walk, go", is mentioned by Watkins in the form Present Simple plus Infinitive; it was used in narrative with the meaning "and then" (''ayéndopíta'' "he then went").&lt;ref&gt;Watkins (1937), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this verb is no longer used as an auxiliary in current standard Chichewa.

A '''consensus government''' is one in which the [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] is appointed by the legislature without reference to [[political parties]].

'''Czech conjugation''' is a term denoting [[Czech language]] [[verb]] [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]], or system of grammatically-determined modifications, in [[verb]]s in the [[Czech language]].

Czech is a [[null-subject language]], i.e. the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] (including personal [[pronoun]]s) can be omitted if known from context. The person is expressed by the verb:
:''já dělám = dělám'' = I do
:''on dělal = dělal'' = he was doing
{{TOC right}}

==Infinitive==

The [[infinitive]] is formed by the [[Ending (linguistics)|ending]] '''-t''', formerly also ''-ti''; on some words '''-ct''' ('''-ci'''):
:''bý'''t''''' - to be, ''jí'''t''''' - to go, ''pé'''ct''''' - to bake

Somewhat archaically:
:''bý'''ti''''' - to be, ''jí'''ti''''' - to go, ''pé'''ci''''' - to bake

==Participles==

[[Participle]]s are used for forming the past tense, conditionals and the passive voice in Czech. They are related to the short forms of [[adjective]]s. Therefore unlike other verb forms, they also express [[Grammatical gender|gender]] which must correspond with the gender of the [[subject (grammar)|subject]].

===Past participle===

(more precisely "active participle") is also called "l-participle" and is used for forming the past tense and the conditionals.

|by'''ly'''&lt;br&gt;děla'''ly'''
|by'''la'''&lt;br&gt;děla'''la'''
|was/were&lt;br&gt;did
|}

===Passive participle===

is also called "n/t-participle" and is used for forming the passive voice. There are two types of endings:

{|class=wikitable
|-
|colspan=3 align=center |'''Singular'''
|colspan=3 align=center |'''Plural'''
|Rowspan=2 align=center |'''English'''
|-
!Masculine
!Feminine
!Neuter
!Masculine&lt;br&gt;animate
!Masculine&lt;br&gt;inanimate&lt;br&gt;&amp; Feminine
!Neuter
|-
|bi'''t'''&lt;br&gt;dělá'''n'''
|bi'''ta'''&lt;br&gt;dělá'''na'''
|bi'''to'''&lt;br&gt;dělá'''no'''
|bi'''ti'''&lt;br&gt;dělá'''ni'''
|bi'''ty'''&lt;br&gt;dělá'''ny'''
|bi'''ta'''&lt;br&gt;dělá'''na'''
|beaten, battered&lt;br&gt;done
|}

=== Agreement between subject and predicate ===

The [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] must always be in accordance with the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] in the sentence – in [[Grammatical number|number]] and [[Grammatical person|person]] (personal [[pronoun]]s), and with past and passive [[participle]]s also in [[Grammatical gender|gender]]. This [[grammar|grammatical]] principle affects the orthography (see also [[Czech orthography#"Soft" I and "Hard" Y|Czech orthography]]) – it is especially important for the correct choice and writing of plural endings of [[participle]]s.

Examples:
{|class=wikitable
|-
!Gender 
!Sg.
!Pl.
!English
|-
!masculine animate
|pes byl koupen
|ps'''i''' byl'''i''' koupen'''i'''
|a dog was bought/dogs were bought
|-
!masculine inanimate
|hrad byl koupen
|hrad'''y''' byl'''y''' koupen'''y'''
|a castle was bought/castles were bought
|-
!feminine
|kočk'''a''' byl'''a''' koupen'''a'''
|kočk'''y''' byl'''y''' koupen'''y'''
|a cat was bought/cats were bought
|-
!neuter
|měst'''o''' byl'''o''' koupen'''o'''
|měst'''a''' byl'''a''' koupen'''a'''
|a town was bought/towns were bought
|}

The example mentioned shows both past (byl, byla ...) and passive (koupen, koupena ...) participles. The accordance in gender takes effect in the past [[Grammatical tense|tense]] and the passive [[Grammatical voice|voice]], not in the present and future tenses in active voice.

If the complex subject is a combination of nouns of different genders, masculine animate gender is prior to others and the masculine inanimate and feminine genders are prior to the neuter gender.

Examples:
:'''''muži''' a ženy byl'''i''''' - men and women were
:'''''kočky''' a koťata byl'''y''''' - cats and kittens were
:''my jsme byl'''i''''' (my = we all/men) vs. ''my jsme byl'''y''''' (my = we women) - we were

'''Priority of genders:'''
:masculine animate &gt; masculine inanimate &amp; feminine &gt; neuter

==Transgressives==
The [[Transgressive (linguistics)|transgressive]] (''přechodník'') expresses an action which happens coincidentally with or foregoing some other action.

The transgressive (''přechodník'') is an archaic form of the verb in the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] languages. Nowadays, it is used only occasionally for [[art]]istic purposes or in unchanging expressions. Transgressives were still used quite widely in Czech literature in the beginning of the 20th century (not in the spoken language). For example, [[Jaroslav Hašek]]'s [[The Good Soldier Švejk]] contains a lot of them.

The Czech language recognizes present and past transgressives. The present transgressive can express present or future action according to the [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] of the verb it is derived from. The past transgressive is usually derived from perfective verbs.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! &amp;nbsp;
! masculine
! feminine&lt;br /&gt;+&lt;br /&gt;neuter
! plural
|-
! present&lt;br /&gt;transgressive
| –e&lt;br /&gt;–a
| –íc&lt;br /&gt;–ouc
| –íce&lt;br /&gt;–ouce
|-
! past&lt;br /&gt;transgressive
| –v&lt;br /&gt;–×
| –vši&lt;br /&gt;–ši
| –vše&lt;br /&gt;–še
|}

'''Examples''':
* ''Usednuvši u okna, začala plakat.'' (Having sat down at a window, she began to cry.) – past transgressive (foregoing action)
* ''Děti, vidouce babičku, vyběhly ven.'' (The children, seeing grandma, ran out.) – present transgressive (coincident action/process)

==Aspect==

Czech verbs are distinguished by [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], they are either '''[[perfective aspect|perfective]]''' or '''[[imperfective aspect|imperfective]]'''. Perfective verbs indicate the finality of the process. Therefore, they cannot express the present tense.

Perfective verbs are usually formed adding [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]]es to imperfective verbs:
:''psát'' (imperf.) - to write, to be writing -&gt; '''''na'''psat'' (perf.) - to write down

Some perfective verbs are not formally related to imperfective ones:
:''brát'' (imperf.) - to take, to be taking -&gt; ''vzít'' (perf.) - to take

==Tenses==

Czech verbs express three absolute [[grammatical tense|tenses]] - past, present and future. Relativity can be expressed by the aspect, sentence constructions and participles.

The present tense can be expressed in imperfective verbs only.

===Present tense===

The present tense is formed by special endings:

{|class=wikitable
|-
!Person
!Singular
!Plural
|-
!1.
| -u/-i/-m
| -eme/-íme/-áme
|-
!2.
| -eš/-íš/-áš
| -ete/-íte/-áte
|-
!3.
| -e/-í/-á
| -ejí/-ějí/-í/-ou/-ají
|}

Verbs are divided into 5 classes according to the way of forming the present tense. They are described in more detail below.

===Past tense===

The past tense is formed by the '''past participle''' (in a proper gender form) and present forms of the verb '''být''' (to be) which are omitted in the 3rd person. The following example is for the male gender (animate in plural):

{|class=wikitable
|-
!Person
!Singular
!Plural
|-
!1.
| dělal '''jsem'''
| dělali '''jsme'''
|-
!2.
| dělal '''jsi'''
| dělali '''jste'''
|-
!3.
| dělal
| dělali
|}

''Dělat'' - to do

For the choice of past tense form when the number or gender of the subject may not be clear, see {{slink|Czech declension|Gender and number of compound phrases}}.

===Future tense===

In '''imperfective verbs''', it is formed by the future forms of the verb '''být''' (to be) and the '''infinitive''':

{|class=wikitable
|-
!Person
!Singular
!Plural
|-
!1.
| '''budu''' dělat
| '''budeme''' dělat
|-
!2.
| '''budeš''' dělat
| '''budete''' dělat
|-
!3.
| '''bude''' dělat
| '''budou''' dělat
|}

''Dělat'' – to do

''Budu, budeš, ...'' with infinitive has the same meaning as “(I, you, ...) will” in English. If not followed by an infinitive, it means “(I, you, ...) will be” (i.e. I will be = ''budu'', not ''budu být'').

In some verbs of motion, the future tense is formed by adding the prefix '''po-'''/'''pů-''' to the present form:
:'''''pů'''jdu'' – I will go, '''''po'''nesu'' – I will carry, '''''po'''vezu'' – I will transport (in a vehicle)

In '''perfective verbs''', the present form expresses the future. Compare:
:''budu dělat'' – I will be doing
:''udělám'' – I will do, I will have done

=== Tenses in subordinate clauses ===
There is no [[sequence of tenses]] in Czech. The types of clauses like in the [[indirect speech]] use tenses that express the time which is spoken about. The tense of the subordinate clause is not shifted to the past even though there is the past tense in the main clause:
:Říká, že '''nemá''' dost peněz. (present tense) – He says he doesn′t have enough money.
:Říkal, že '''nemá''' dost peněz. (present tense) – He said he didn′t have enough money.
:Říkal, že Petr '''přišel''' v pět hodin. (past tense) – He said Peter had come at five o′clock.
:Říkal, že to '''udělá''' v pátek. (future tense) – He said he would do it on Friday.

==Imperative==

The [[imperative mood]] is formed for the 2nd person singular and plural and the 1st person plural.

In the '''2nd person singular''', it takes either '''null ending''' or '''-i/-ej''' ending, according to the verb class.

The '''2nd person plural''' takes the ending '''-te/-ete/-ejte''' and the '''1st person plural''' takes '''-me/-eme/-ejme'''.

Examples:
:''buď! buďte!'' (be!) ''buďme!'' (let's be!)
:''spi! spěte!'' (sleep!) ''spěme!'' (let's sleep!)
:''dělej! dělejte!'' (do!) ''dělejme!'' (let's do!)

==Conditionals==

The [[Conditional mood|conditionals]] are formed by the '''past participle''' and special forms of the verb '''být''' (to be). Following example of the '''present conditional''' is for the male gender (animate in plural):

{|class=wikitable
|-
!Person
!Singular
!Plural
|-
!1.
| dělal '''bych'''
| dělali '''bychom'''
|-
!2.
| dělal '''bys'''
| dělali '''byste'''
|-
!3.
| dělal '''by'''
| dělali '''by'''
|}

''dělal bych'' - I would do

There is also the '''past conditional''' in Czech but it is usually replaced by the present conditional.

{|class=wikitable
|-
!Person
!Singular
!Plural
|-
!1.
| '''byl bych''' dělal 
| '''byli bychom''' dělali
|-
!2.
| '''byl bys''' dělal 
| '''byli byste''' dělali 
|-
!3.
| '''byl by''' dělal 
| '''byli by''' dělali 
|}

''byl bych dělal'' - I would have done

''By'' also becomes a part of conjugations ''aby'' (so that) and ''kdyby'' (if). Therefore, these conjunctions take the same endings:
:''Kdy'''bych''' nepracoval, nedostal bych výplatu.'' If I didn't work, I would get no wages.

==Passive voice==

There are two ways to form the [[passive voice]] in Czech:

1. By the verb '''být''' (to be) and the '''passive participle''' (as in English):
:''Město '''bylo založeno''' ve 14. století.'' The town was founded in the 14th century.

2. By adding the [[reflexive pronoun]] '''se''':
:''Ono '''se''' to neudělalo.'' It has not been done.
:''To '''se''' vyrábí v Číně.'' It is produced in China.

However, the use of ''se'' is not exclusive to the passive voice.

==Reflexive verbs==

[[Reflexive pronoun]]s '''se''' and '''si''' are components of [[reflexive verb]]s (''se/si'' is not usually translated into English):
:''posadit se'' - to sit down
:''myslet si'' - to think, to suppose

==Negation==

[[Negation]] is formed by the prefix '''ne-'''. In the future tense and the passive voice it is added to the auxiliary verb ''být'' (to be).
:'''''ne'''dělat'' - not to do
:'''''ne'''dělám'' - I do not do
:'''''ne'''dělej!'' do not do!
:'''''ne'''dělal jsem'' - I did not do
:'''''ne'''budu dělat'' - I will not do
:'''''ne'''dělal bych'' - I would not do
:''byl bych '''ne'''udělal'' or '''''ne'''byl bych udělal'' - I would not have done
:'''''ne'''ní děláno'' - it is not done

Unlike [[English language|English]], a negative pronoun must be used with a negative verb (using a positive verb is ungrammatical):
:'''''Nic ne'''mám.'' - I have nothing. (literally ''I do not have nothing.'')
:'''''Ni'''kdy to '''ni'''komu '''ne'''říkej.'' - Never say it to anybody. (literally ''Do not never say it to nobody.'')

[[Image:Deadeye-sans-lanyard.jpg|thumb|left|A triple deadeye without a lanyard]]
A '''deadeye''' is an item used in the [[standing rigging|standing]] and [[running rigging|running]] [[rigging]] of traditional [[sailing ships]]. It is a smallish round thick [[wood]]en (usually [[lignum vitae]]) disc with one or more holes through it, perpendicular to the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of the disc. Single and triple-hole deadeyes are most commonly seen. The three-holed blocks were called deadeyes because the position of the three holes resemble the eye and nose sockets of a sheep's skull.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jobé ed. ''The Great Age of Sail'', EDITA LAUSANNE, Michael Kelly trans.(Switzerland 1967) p. 95, Library of Congress No. LC 67-27010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:JungferSee.jpg|thumb|right|A single deadeye (or bull's eye) used to change the direction of a line, in this case a [[clewlines and buntlines|buntline]] on ''[[Prince William (ship)|Prince William]]'' 's fore-[[topgallant sail|topgallant]].]]
Single deadeyes (or '''bull's eyes''') are used to guide and control a [[rope|line]] and, particularly in older vessels, to change its direction. More modern systems would use a [[block (sailing)|block]] for this purpose but in traditional rigs with many lines to deal with, designed when blocks were relatively expensive to make, a deadeye provided an acceptable compromise.  When blocks came into common use for adjusting running rigging, deadeyes continued to be used for tensioning standing rigging.

[[Image:TripleDeadeyes.jpg|thumb|left|Triple deadeyes and lanyards used to tension the shrouds on the [[Lowestoft]] trawler ''[[Excelsior (ketch)|Excelsior]]''.]]
Triple deadeyes are used in pairs; a [[rope|line]] called a [[lanyard]] is run back and forth between them, through the holes, so that they function again much as a [[block and tackle]] would.&lt;ref name="ashley534"&gt;Clifford W. Ashley, ''[[The Ashley Book of Knots]]'' (New York: Doubleday, 1944), 534–537.&lt;/ref&gt; This provides a [[mechanical advantage]], pulling harder on whatever the deadeyes are attached to. Pairs of deadeyes are placed in the [[shroud (sailing)|shrouds]] (the lines that hold up the [[mast (sailing)|mast]]), where they are used to create greater [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] in the shrouds. To set up the lanyards used with dead-eyes, a suitable grease such as tallow is first applied to the holes. After reeving the lanyard through the deadeyes, the end is hooked to a handy purchase in the rig above, such as the throat halyard. By hauling on the halyard the lanyard in the deadeyes is drawn up taut. A small wooden wedge is knocked into the last hole, to prevent the lanyard sliding back, and the end is unhooked from the purchase and made up on the shroud above the upper deadeye. The wedge can then be removed ready for the next shroud.     As an alternative the tackle on the lanyard can be made fast to the shroud well above the upper deadeye so that it compresses the deadeyes.    The last part of the lanyard can then be seized to an adjacent part between the deadeyes.  When this is finished the tackle is cast off and the lanyard made off. 

In recent decades, as steel [[wire]] became the prevalent material for [[sailboat]] rigging, deadeyes and laynards gave way to metal [[turnbuckle]]s for tensioning the wires. More recently, however, with the advent of high-strength and low-stretch synthetic fibres, some sailboats are using synthetic rope for standing rigging, and deadeyes and lanyards are coming back into use as tensioning devices.&lt;ref name="moonblink"&gt;{{cite web

'''Deepa Nisanth''' is an Indian author and social activist who writes in [[Malayalam]]. She is assistant professor at [[Sree Kerala Varma College|Sree Kerala Varma college, Thrissur]] and has published four books which are based on her memories.&lt;ref name=keralavarma&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://keralavarma.ac.in/content/deepa-t-s|title=DEEPA T S {{!}} Sree Kerala Varma College|website=keralavarma.ac.in|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://122.165.117.71/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=127626&amp;shelfbrowse_itemnumber=127557|title=PRANAYA VYATHAYUDE MANIFESTO|last=Deepa Nisanth|date=2011|publisher=Green Books|isbn=|edition=1|language=Malayalam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14740617.Deepa_Nisanth|title=Deepa Nisanth|website=www.goodreads.com|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism and controversies ==
Nisanth has voiced her opinion publicly on different issues. In a 2015 Facebook post she supported a "beef festival" held at her college by members of the [[Students' Federation of India]] in protest against the murder of a man in Uttar Pradesh allegedly for eating beef. She claimed her post was in reaction to "the on-going issue of beef ban and related controversies in the country, in general."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/deepa-defends-symbolic-protest/article7736983.ece|title=Kerala college professor targeted for supporting beef protest|last=Muringatheri|first=Mini|date=2015-10-08|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018 she refused to share the stage with [[Urmila Unni]] after he supported the move to reintegrate actor [[Dileep#Actress Molestation Case|Dileep]] back into the [[Association of Malayalam Movie Artists]] despite still being under investigation for conspiracy of kidnapping and attempted rape of an Indian film actress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/deepa-nishanth-says-no-event-urmila-unni-actor-who-wanted-dileep-back-amma-83898|title=Deepa Nisanth says no to event with Urmila Unni, actor who wanted Dileep back in AMMA|date=2018-06-29|work=The News Minute|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of her book, Ottamarappeythu is allegedly taken from the title of a 2016 Book by author Ajith Kumar R OttathulliPeythu. &lt;ref&gt;https://malayalam.news18.com/news/kerala/malayalam-writer-ajith-kumar-against-deepa-nishanth-61845.html&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been accused of plagiarism by Malayalam poet Kalesh. Facts emerged that a poem published under her name in a journal had in fact been penned by Mr. Kalesh years earlier, thus making it a theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|urlhttps://english.mathrubhumi.com/mobile/books/books-news/young-poet-s-kalesh-raises-plagiarism-allegations-against-deepa-nisanth--1.3354005&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Express mail''' is an accelerated [[mail]] delivery service for which the customer pays a [[fee|surcharge]] and receives faster delivery. Express mail is a service for domestic and international mail, and is in most nations governed by the country's own [[postal administration]]. Since 1998, the international accelerated delivery services are governed by the EMS Cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ems.post/ |website=ems.post|title=Express Mail Service (EMS) Cooperative }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Express Mail Service and the EMS Cooperative==
[[File:EMS-Logo.png|thumb|right|Express Mail Service (EMS) service logo]]
Express Mail Service (EMS) is an international express postal service offered by postal-administration members of the [[Universal Postal Union]] (UPU).  These administrators created the EMS Cooperative in 1998, within the framework of the UPU, to promote the harmonization and development of postal services worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ems.post/information-about-ems-cooperative|website=ems.pot|title= About EMS Cooperative|access-date= January 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|January 2015}}, EMS was offered by more than 190 countries and territories worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ems.post/ems |website=ems.post|title=EMS Homepage|access-date=January 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent [[auditor]] measures the express delivery performance of all international EMS operators, and EMS Performance Awards are based on postal operators' performance, including service performance and tracking: gold, silver, or bronze certificate are awarded to EMS Cooperative members depending on their yearly performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ems.post/2013-ems-performance-award-winners |website=ems.post|title=2013 EMS Performance Award Winners}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These EMS award winners are recorded in the EMS Cooperative's Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ems.post/hall-fame-2007-2011 |website=ems.post|title= EMS Hall of Fame 2007-2011|access-date= January 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EMS Cooperative members==
[[File:SpeedPostEMS.JPG|thumb|right|EMS SpeedPost from India]]
{{main|List of EMS Cooperative members}}
Since its creation, 182 postal administrations have joined the EMS Cooperative, representing over 85% of EMS operators worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ems.post/members-ems-cooperative|website=ems.post|title= Members of the EMS Cooperative|access-date= 10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other express mail providers==
Many transportation logistics firms offer similar accelerated services. [[DHL Express|DHL Express ("DHL")]], Federal Express ("[[FedEx]]"), and [[United Parcel Service]] ("UPS")  are the most popular alternatives. However, in many countries such alternative carriers' shipments have different status for several legal purposes. For example, in Russia, shipments from abroad to individuals for private needs are exempt from customs duties if valued less than €1000 and sent via post or EMS, while when sent by other means the exemption applies to values below €250 only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.customs.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=72:ab-the-ord&amp;catid=37:moving-of-the-goods-by-physical-persons-for-a-private-use-through-customs-border-of-the-customs-union-and-fulfillment-of-the-customs-operations-connected-with-their-release&amp;Itemid=1849&amp;Itemid=1910 |website=customs.ru|publisher= Federal Customs Service of Russia|title=Moving-of-the-goods-by-physical-persons-for-a-private-use-through-customs-border-of-the-customs-union-and-fulfillment-of-the-customs-operations-connected-with-their-release}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries legal notification sent by post and EMS are deemed made on the date of dispatch, while for other couriers on the date of delivery only.&lt;ref name="russian-civil-code.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russian-civil-code.com/PartI/SectionI/Subsection5/Chapter11.html |website=Russian-civil-code.com|title= Civil Code of the Russian Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gabriel Aresti Segurola''' (October 14, 1933 – June 5, 1975) was one of the most important writers and poets in [[Basque language]] in the 20th century.

He grew up in [[Bilbao]], which was a Spanish-speaking environment. Although his father talked to his parents in Basque language, the child Gabriel did not have Basque as mother language. He was a self-taught student of the language, at the age of 21 he collaborated in some magazines. His literary career began with a work influenced by the symbolism, [[Maldan Behera]] (Downhill). His most important works are, however, [[Harri eta Herri]] (Stone and Country, 1964), Euskal Harria (The Basque Stone, 1968) and [[Harrizko Herri Hau]] (This Country of Stone, 1971), related to the social realism. He also cultivated other genres, like the novel, the short story and theatre. He was an excellent translator of Basque; he translated authors like [[Federico García Lorca]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]].

Very critical and controversial, he published many articles, which brought him problems not only with [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s regime but also with some of the mainstream Basque nationalism tendencies, because of his leftist social ideas. Gabriel Aresti was one of the greatest inspirers of the modern culture in Basque language (though he always found the sources in the popular culture and the daily talking, opposing to the purists of the language), and as a Member of the  [[Euskaltzaindia|Academy of the Basque language]], he defended the unified Basque language, which he also used before it was adopted by the Academy in 1968. He founded the publishing house Lur, allowing new authors in the Basque language like [[Ramon Saizarbitoria]], [[Arantxa Urretavizcaya|Arantxa Urretabizkaia]] or [[Xabier Lete]] to publish their first works.

'''Gladvertising''' (n) is [[outdoor advertising]] that uses cameras and [[facial recognition software]] to read a consumer's [[mood (psychology)|mood]], then pushes products relevant to the target [[emotional state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Keats, Jonathan|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/06/st_jw_gladvertising/|title=Jargon Watch|work=Wired Magazine|date=July 2011|page= 48}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses [[emotion recognition]] software to tailor outdoor adverts to consumers' mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://jazarah.net/the-real-minority-report-gladvertising-kick-starts-revolution-in-outdoor-advertising/|title=The real Minority Report: "Gladvertising" kick starts revolution in outdoor advertising|work=jazarah.net|date=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms was coined in a July 2011 report by the Centre of Future Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.3mgtg.com/PDF/3MGTG_Up_Front_and_Personal_Report.pdf | title=Up Front and Personal Digital Out-Of-Home Communications | publisher=Centre of Future Studies | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409070651/http://www.3mgtg.com/PDF/3MGTG_Up_Front_and_Personal_Report.pdf | archivedate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.futurestudies.co.uk/home.htm|title=Futurist Think Tank &amp; Strategic Futures Consultants: The centre for future studies|publisher=futurestudies.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that advertisements like the ones in the film ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' may be well on the way, and indeed, that some already exist. Their report – commissioned by 3MGTG, which specialises in digital advertising – foresees the first step to be advertisements that adapt to our moods.

The technology has been dubbed 'Gladverts' by the report's authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://technologyinf.com/electronics/minority-report-like-adverts/|title=Minority Report-like adverts|work=www.technologyinf.com|date=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4012">'''Ioseb Iremashvili''' ({{lang-ka|იოსებ ირემაშვილი}}, {{lang-de|Iosseb Iremaschwili}}) (1878–1944) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] politician and author. A boyhood friend, and later political adversary, of [[Joseph Stalin]], he is primarily known for his book ''Stalin und die Tragödie Georgiens'' ("Stalin and the Tragedy of Georgia', [[Berlin]], 1932), the first [[memoir]] of Stalin's childhood.

== Biography ==
Both Stalin and Iremashvili grew up in [[Gori, Georgia]] (then part of the [[Tiflis Governorate]], [[Imperial Russia]]), where they attended a local church school. Later, they studied together at [[Tiflis Theological Seminary]]. A member of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], Iremashvili was involved in the revolutionary activities in [[Transcaucasia]] and joined the [[Menshevik]] faction which quickly became a dominant political force in Georgia. After 1917, he worked as a teacher at [[Tiflis]] and was elected to the [[Constituent Assembly of Georgia]] in 1919. In February 1921, the [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russian]] [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Red Army invaded]] Georgia and put an end to its [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|three-year independence]]. Iremashvili, like several other Georgian Mensheviks, was placed in the [[Metekhi]] prison, but was then released through the efforts of his sister who negotiated with Stalin during his visit to Tiflis in July 1921. In October 1921, sixty-two arrested Mensheviks, including Iremashvili, were deported to [[Germany]] where he was granted a [[political asylum]]. Having settled in Berlin, he engaged in Georgian émigré activities aimed at enlisting [[Europe]]’s support to the Georgian independence cause.

== Memoirs ==
In 1932, he published, in German, his memoirs, ''Stalin und die Tragödie Georgiens'' ("Stalin and the Tragedy of Georgia"). Published in emigration and immune to Soviet censure, the book, although hostile to Stalin, is considered the only independent contemporary account of Stalin's youth and his early years in Georgia, and has proven a vital source for Stalin biographers. In his memoirs, Iremashvili relates many details of the Gori life of Soso (Stalin's childhood name), with particular emphasis of his brutal treatment at the hands of his father, [[Vissarion Dzhugashvili]]. The primary deduction made by Iremashvili based upon his account was followed by several [[psychobiography|psychobiographers]], most notably by [[Gustav Bychowski]] and [[Daniel Rancour-Lafferiere]], which consider beatings the key psychological determination of the future dictator.&lt;ref&gt;Suny, Ronald Grigor (Spring, 1991), Beyond Psychohistory: The Young Stalin in Georgia. ''[[Slavic Review]]'', Vol. 50, No. 1, pp. 48-58.&lt;/ref&gt; Iremashvili also reports that the young Stalin voluntarily terminated his studies at the Seminary, and was not expelled for his revolutionary activity as stated in the Soviet leader’s official biography. In addition, he claims that Soso’s parents were ethnic [[Ossetians]], thus explaining Stalin’s particularly hard-line policy towards independent Georgia and his excessive harshness in suppressing [[August Uprising|anti-Soviet opposition]] in the [[Georgian SSR]] in the 1920s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5365">{{for|the American politician|James P. Covey}}

'''James Benjamin Covey''' (''né'' '''Kaweli'''; c. 1825 – 12 October 1850) was a sailor, remembered today chiefly for his role as [[Language interpretation|interpreter]] during the legal proceedings in the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|United States federal courts]] that followed the 1839 revolt aboard the Spanish slave ship ''[[La Amistad]]''.  Covey, who spoke [[Mende language|Mende]] and possibly other African languages as well as [[English language|English]], allowed the African passengers of the ''Amistad'' to communicate with the court and to defend themselves successfully against the charges of mutiny and murder.

== Early life ==
Covey was born ''circa'' 1825 or 1826 in the southwestern highlands of what is now [[Sierra Leone]], in [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name="Lawrance"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lawrance |first= Benjamin N. |date= 2013 |title= "Your Poor Boy No Father No Mother": 'Orphans,' Alienation, and Perils of Atlantic Child Slave Biography |url= https://muse.jhu.edu/article/546333 |journal= Biography |volume= 36 |issue= 4 |pages= 672 – 703 |doi= 10.1353/bio.2013.0045 |access-date= 20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His African name, Kaweli, means "war road" in Mende.  At the age of five or six he was kidnapped and sold to the wife of a chief of the Bulom tribe.  Three years later he was sold to a European slaver and probably taken to the [[Lomboko]] slave camp.  At a time when the [[Atlantic slave trade]] had already been officially outlawed, Covey was illegally shipped to [[Cuba]] on board the Spanish ship ''Segundo Socorro''.  That ship was intercepted by the British fleet and the captives, including Covey, were freed.&lt;ref name="Lawrance" /&gt;

Covey was then put into the care of the Rev. John William Weeks, of the [[Freetown]] branch of the [[Church Mission Society|Church Missionary Society]].  He spent five years at school in Freetown before joining the British [[Royal Navy]] and embarking on the [[HMS Buzzard (1834)|HMS ''Buzzard'']] in 1838, where he served under Captain [[Charles Fitzgerald]].  Covey arrived to [[New York City]] on board the ''Buzzard'' in June 1839.&lt;ref name="Lawrance" /&gt;

== Involvement with the ''Amistad'' case ==
[[Josiah Willard Gibbs, Sr.|Josiah Gibbs]], a professor of linguistics at [[Yale University]] who was personally committed to the [[Abolitionism|abolition of slavery]], sought to assist the legal defense of the Africans who had come into the custody of the U.S. federal courts after their uprising on board ''La Amistad''.  To that end, Prof. Gibbs learned to count to ten in the language spoken by most of the Africans, which turned out to be Mende, and then paced the harbor in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and later in New York, until he was approached by sailors who recognized the words.  In this way, Gibbs came into contact with Covey and fellow British sailor Charles Pratt in New York, in October 1839.&lt;ref name="Lawrance" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibbs"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gibbs |first= Josiah W. |date= 1840 |title= A Mendi Vocabulary |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vmIWAAAAYAAJ |journal= American Journal of Science and Arts |volume= 38 |issue= 1 |pages= 44 - 48 |doi= |access-date= 20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibbs took both Covey and Pratt to New Haven, where they were housed under the protection of [[Lewis Tappan]] and the committee for the defense of the captives of the ''Amistad''.&lt;ref name="Lawrance" /&gt;  Covey stayed in New Haven for four months, until he had translated the testimonies of three Mende-speaking captives in the Amistad civil trial in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], in 1841. Because of his own experience, Covey was instrumental in interpreting and communicating the details of the kidnapping, terror, and eventual rebellion. The case was appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], which ruled in ''[[United States v. The Amistad]]'' that the captives were not slaves, but freeborn men.

== Later life ==
Two years after the trials, in November 1841, Covey, along with the 35 surviving Africans of the ''Amistad,'' boarded the ship ''Gentleman'' and returned to Africa.  The Africans were accompanied by an American missionary, William Raymond.  Covey then drifted in and out of the Christian missionary communities in Sierra Leone.  There is some evidence that he became involved with a local warlord and may even have participated in a slaving expedition in 1845.&lt;ref name="Lawrance" /&gt;  After falling ill, he was shuffled back and forth between the village of Kaw-Mendi and the main mission compound, "America".  Covey died on 12 October, 1850 and was given a Christian burial.&lt;ref name="Lawrance" /&gt;

== In popular culture ==
In [[Steven Spielberg]]'s film ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', Covey is played by actor [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4138">'''Joel ben Samuel Sirkis''' (יואל בן שמואל סירקיש) also known as the '''Bach -''' בית חדש) '''ב"ח''')—an abbreviation of his magnum opus, ''Bayit Chadash''—was a prominent Jewish [[posek]] and [[Halakha|halakhist]]. He lived in [[central Europe]] and held rabbinical positions in [[Belz]], [[Brest-Litovsk]] and [[Kraków]]. He lived from 1561 to 1640.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

==Biography==
Sirkis was born in [[Lublin]] in 1561. At age fourteen he went to the ''[[yeshiva]]'' of R. [[Naftali Zvi Hirsch Schor]], a leading student of R. [[Moses Isserles]]. After remaining there some time he went to [[Brest-Litovsk]], where he attended the [[yeshiva]] of [[Rabbi Phoebus]]. While still a youth he was invited to the rabbinate of [[Pruzhany]], near [[Slonim]]. Later he occupied the rabbinates of [[Lukow]], [[Lublin]], [[Medzhybizh|Medzyboz]], [[Belz]], [[Szydlowka]], and finally Brest-Litovsk and [[Kraków]], succeeding in each of the two last-mentioned places his teacher R. Phoebus.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

"The Bach" was an adherent of the [[Kabbalah]] and an opponent of [[pilpul]]. He was also critical of those who relied solely on the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' for [[halachic]] decisions, rather than on the [[Talmud]] and the [[Geonim]]. He was the father-in-law of Rabbi [[David HaLevi Segal]], who frequently refers to him in ''[[Turei Zahav]]'', his [[Shulchan Aruch#Major commentaries|commentary]] on the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''. Rabbi Sirkis died in Kraków in 1640.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;&lt;ref name=jh/&gt;

==Writing==
[[File:WITH M MUKUNDAN -kakkanadan-.JPG|thumb|350|left|Kakkanadan with [[M. Mukundan]]]]
Though he had started writing much before the railway stint and even wrote the novel ''Vasoori'', it was his second novel ''Sakshi'' that brought him laurels. The book had a great impact on the younger generation of Malayalam readers and was credited with breaking new grounds in [[Malayalam literature]]. In early 1960s, he shot into prominence as one of the most promising writers in Malayalam and was among the pioneers of the [[Modernist literature|modernist]] trend in Malayalam literature. Kakkanadan's early works broke new ground in Malayalam fiction on account of their earnest exploration of deeper realities of life by employing a new diction and narrative methods. Though vast majority of readers initially found it hard to accept the modern trends ushered in by Kakkanadan and some of his contemporaries, their works soon created a new sensibility marking a radical break from the past.

He was one of the harbingers of modernism in the genres of Malayalam novel and short story. Though labelled by his readers as a formidable ultramodern Malayalam writer, Kakkanadan himself was of the view that modernism in literature has no convincing rationale. Several of his works are considered landmarks in the history of literary modernism in Malayalam. Moving with ease from apocalyptic visions to tantric imagery, he made his works representative of an important strand in the larger modernist trends in arts, literature and culture in India.

Kakkanadan was a rebel, both in life and literature. His rebellion extended from his selection of themes and use of subversive language to his careful crafting of the philosophy of angst into the writing. He often traversed the sweat zones of life and spoke of the valleys of the unknowing. With a stunningly violent style, he shook the very roots of the progressive literary sensibilities of the 1960s and 1970s and its innocent certainties. His was a world of dark tones and darker people, many of them social rejects. He often spoke of the seamy side, the world of puss and blood. Each of his works was an act of rebellion against accepted elitist social mores and codes. Sex, like violence, was a leitmotif in many of his works; at times as a resonant chant, at others as an explosive outpouring of raw human power that transcends both the demonic and the divine. Kakkanadan's major novels are ''Sakshi'' (1967), ''Ezham Mudra'' (1968), ''Vasoori'' (1968), ''Ushnamekhala'' (1969), ''Kozhi'' (1971), ''Parankimala'' (1971), ''Ajnathayude Thaazhvara'' (1972), ''Innaleyude Nizhal'' (1974), ''Adiyaravu'' (1975), ''Orotha'' (1982), ''Ee Naaykkalute Lokam'' (1983) and ''Barsaathi'' (1986).  His most noted short story collections are ''Yuddhaavasaanam'' (1969), ''Purathekkulla Vazhi'' (1970), ''Aswathamaavinte Chiri'' (1979), ''Sreechakram'' (1981), ''Alwar Thirunagarile Pannikal'' (1989), ''Uchayillaatha Oru Divasam'' (1989) and ''Jaappaana Pukayila'' (2005). He has other novels, short story collections, travelogues and essay collections to his credit. Director [[Bharathan]] adapted the novels ''Parankimala'' and ''Adiyaravu'' for the films ''Parankiala'' (1981) and ''Parvathi'' (1981). [[K. G. George]]'s ''Onappudava'' (1978) was based on Kakkanadan's novel of the same name. Kakkanadan's short story ''Chithalukal'' was made into a film by [[Kamal (director)|Kamal]], titled ''[[Unnikrishnante Adyathe Christmas]]'' (1988).

He won the [[Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award]] for his short-story collection ''Aswathamavinte Chiri'' in 1980 and for his novel ''Orotha'' in 1984. In 2005 he won the [[Kendra Sahitya Akademi Award]] for ''Jappana Pukayila'' and in 2008 he was bestowed with the [[Kerala Sahitya Akademi]] Fellowship. Kakkanadan was a craze among the younger generation of Kerala during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|work = [[The Hindu]]|title = Novelist Kakkanadan passes away|url = http://www.thehindu.com/arts/article2550870.ece|date = 19 October 2011|accessdate = 19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1871">'''Lamido''' (plural '''Lamibe''') is the [[Anglicisation]] of a term from the [[Fula language]] or Fulfulde, used to refer to a ruler.  In the language it is properly '''''laamiiɗo''''' (pl. laamiiɓe), derived from the verbal root "''laam-''" meaning "to rule or to lead", and hence may be translated more specifically as "leader".  It is commonly used to translate the concept of the Arabic title [[Emir]], into Fulfulde.  The title "Lamido" has been used by the traditional leaders of certain Islamic communities in West Africa, originally as head of (often vassal) states, nowadays persisting within post-colonial republics.

==States where the title lamido as such was used==
''(list incomplete)''
[[Fula jihads#Fulani jihad states|Fulani Jihad state]]s:
*[[Bauchi Emirate]], since its foundation in 1805

Other:
*[[Bibemi]], since its 1770 foundation, until the higher Muslim title [[Sultan]] was assumed

==Compound title==
*'''Laamiiɗo juulɓe''' 'Emir of the Muslims (lit. ''those who pray'')' was a title, alongside the proper Arabic ''[[Amir al-Mu´minin]]'' (which was maintained), of the [[Imam]] [[`Usuman dan Muhammad Fodio]], the original leader of the largest of the [[Fula jihads]] (conquests by the Fula people in the name of spreading [[Islam]]) in [[Sokoto]], the home state of the leader of the [[Fulbe jihad]], whose heirs (since 1817) adopted the title [[Sarkin Musulmi]] and became known as [[Sultan of Sokoto]], still considered the paramount ruler of traditional Islamic people in (northern) Nigeria
*'''Baban-Lamido''' in [[Adamawa Emirate|Adamawa]] (now partially in [[Cameroon]]), since its foundation in 1809

'''Lidia Zamenhof''' ({{lang-eo|Lidja}}; 29 January 1904&amp;ndash;1942) was a [[Poles|Polish]] writer, publisher, translator and the youngest daughter of [[L. L. Zamenhof]], the creator of [[Esperanto]]. She was born on 29 January 1904 in [[Warsaw]], then in [[partitioned Poland]]. She was an active promoter of Esperanto as well as of [[Homaranismo]], a form of [[religious humanism]] first defined by her father.

Around 1925 she became a member of the [[Bahá'í Faith]].&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Zamenhof, Lidia |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 368}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1937 she went to the [[United States]] to teach that religion as well as Esperanto.  In December 1938 she returned to Poland, where she continued to teach and translated many [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í writings]].&lt;ref name="adherents"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.adherents.com/largecom/fam_bahai.html | title = Famous Baha'is | publisher = adherents.com | accessdate = 2008-03-16 | date = 2005-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date on which she was murdered is unclear. In [http://db.yadvashem.org/names/search.html?language=en The Central Database of Shoah Victims' Names], three conflicting testimonies are given for her date of her death: July 5, October, and September 5 in 1942. Hence, her murder date was in the latter part of 1942. She was murdered at the [[Treblinka extermination camp]] during [[the Holocaust in Poland]].

==Life==
Lidia Zamenhof learned Esperanto as a nine-year-old girl.  At the age of fourteen she had already done translations from [[Polish literature]]; her first publications appeared several years thereafter.  Having completed her university studies in [[law]] in 1925, she dedicated herself totally to working for Esperanto.   In the same year during the 17th [[World Congress of Esperanto|World Congress]] in 1925 in [[Geneva]] she became acquainted with the [[Bahá'í Faith]].  Lidia Zamenhof became secretary of the [[homaranismo|homaranistic]] Esperanto-Society Concord in [[Warsaw]] and often made arrangements for speakers and courses.  Starting at the [[Vienna]] World Congress of Esperanto in 1924 she attended every [[World Congress of Esperanto|World Congress]].  (She did not attend the 1938 Universala Kongreso in England, as she was in the United States at the time.)  As an instructor of the [[Andreo Cseh|Cseh method]] of teaching Esperanto she made many promotional trips and taught many courses in various countries.

She actively coordinated her work with the student Esperanto movement &amp;mdash; in the International Student League, in the [[World Esperanto Association|UEA]], in the [[International Cseh Institute of Esperanto|Cseh Institute]], and in the Bahá'í Faith. Additionally, Lidia wrote for the journal ''[[Literatura Mondo]]'' (mainly studies on Polish Literature), and also contributed to ''[[Pola Esperantisto]]'', ''[[La Praktiko]]'', ''[[Heroldo de Esperanto]]'', and ''[[Enciklopedio de Esperanto]]''.  Her translation of ''[[Quo Vadis (novel)|Quo Vadis]]'' by [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]] was published in 1933 and is very well known.

In 1937 she went to the United States for a long stay.  In December 1938 she had to leave the United States because that country's [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|Immigration Service]] declined to extend her tourist visitor's visa because of her allegedly illegal "paid labor" of teaching Esperanto.  She refused offers of marriage that could have permitted her to remain or eventually to naturalize.  After returning to Poland, her homeland, she travelled around the country teaching Esperanto and the Bahá'í Faith.

Under the German occupation regime of 1939, her home in Warsaw became part of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]].  She was arrested under the charge of having gone to the United States to spread anti-Nazi propaganda,&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Wendy ''Lidia, The Life of Lidia Zamenhof Daughter of Esperanto'', 1985, pp. 234-235&lt;/ref&gt; but after a few months, she was released and returned to her home city where she and the rest of her family remained confined.  There she endeavored to help others get medicine and food. She was offered help and escape several times by Polish Esperantists but refused in each case.  To one [[Poles|Pole]], well-known Esperantist [[Józef Arszennik]], who had offered her refuge on several occasions, she explained, "you and your family could lose your lives, because whoever hides a Jew perishes along with the Jew who is discovered." &lt;ref&gt;[[Joanna Iwaszkiewicz]], Wtedy Kwitły Forsycje, 1993, pp.113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.getto.pl/index.php?mod=view_record&amp;rid=07091998002105000001&amp;tid=osoby&lt;/ref&gt;  To another, her explanation was contained in her last known letter: "Do not think of putting yourself in danger; I know that I must die but I feel it is my duty to stay with my people.  God grant that out of our sufferings a better world may emerge.  I believe in God.  I am a Bahá'í and will die a Bahá'í.  Everything is in His hands." &lt;ref&gt;Heller, Wendy ''Lidia, The Life of Lidia Zamenhof Daughter of Esperanto'', 1985, pg. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually in the end she was swept up in the mass transport heading to the extermination camp in [[Treblinka]] in the course of the [[Grossaktion Warsaw (1942)|Grossaktion Warsaw]]. She was killed there sometime after the summer of 1942.

==Memorial==
In her memory and honor, a meeting was held in 1995 at the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]  The meeting called attention to Esperantists' efforts to save persecuted Jews during [[World War II]].

In [[telephone]] systems nomenclature, a '''long line''' is a transmission line in a long-distance [[communications network]] such as [[carrier system]]s, [[microwave radio relay]] links, geosynchronous [[satellite]] links, underground cables, [[aerial cable]]s and open wire, and [[Submarine communications cable]]s.   In the [[Communications in the United States|United States]], some of this technology was spun off into the corporate entity known as ''AT&amp;T Long Distance'' with the [[Bell System divestiture|breakup of AT&amp;T]] in 1984.  Prior to then, the [[AT&amp;T Long Lines]] division of the [[Bell System]], which was what AT&amp;T called itself when it was responsible for providing both long distance and local telephone service before the [[Bell System divestiture|1984 breakup]], provided maintenance and installation of long line facilities for the Bell System's long distance service.

'''Luhu''' is an [[Austronesian language|Austronesian]] spoken in the west of [[Seram Island]] in eastern [[Indonesia]]. It is spoken in Luhu village on Hoamoal Peninsula at the western end of Seram, and in [[Boano]] and [[Kelang]] islands, off the western tip of Seram Island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.ethnologue.com/15/show_country.asp?name=IDM Ethnologue 15 report for Indonesia (Maluku)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The northernmost dialect, Piru, was separated from the rest of the language through colonial depopulation, and was influenced by neighboring languages as it became [[Endangered language|moribund]].

'''Macorix''' (also rendered '''Macorís''' and '''Mazorij''') was the language of the northern coast of what is today the Dominican Republic. Spanish accounts only refer to three languages on the island: Taino, Macorix, and neighboring [[Ciguayo language|Ciguayo]]. The [[Macorix people]] appear to have been semi-sedentary and their presence seems to have predated the agricultural [[Taino]] who came to occupy much of the island.  For the early European writers, they shared similarities with the nearby [[Ciguayos]].&lt;ref name="Bidó"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://es.calameo.com/read/000345214d171d7bd2cee | title=Voces de bohío Vocabulario de la cultura taína | publisher=Archivo General de la Nación | author=García Bidó, Rafael | year=2010 | location=Santo Domingo, DR | pages=7, 25, 32 | isbn=978-9945-020-95-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their language appears to have been moribund at the time of the [[Spanish Conquest]], and within a century it was extinct.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~swilson/wilson_iaca99.html | title=Cultural Pluralism and the Emergence of Complex Society in the Greater Antilles | publisher=University of Texas, Department of Anthropology | accessdate=January 31, 2016 | author=Wilson, Samuel M. | year=1999 | conference=XVIII International Congress for Caribbean Archaeology | location=St. George's, Grenada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known of Macorix apart from it being a distinct language from Taino and neighboring Ciguayo. A negative form, ''baeza'' {{IPA|[baˈesa]}}, is the only element of the language that is directly attested. ''Baeza'' could be Arawakan (though not Taino or [[Iñeri language|Iñeri]]), analyzable as ''ba-ésa'' 'no-thing' = 'nothing'. (Cf. [[Manao language|Manao]] ''ma-esa'' 'no, not', [[Paresis language|Paresis]] ''ma-isa'' 'not'. The negative prefix is ''ba-'' in [[Amarakaeri language|Amarakaeri]] which, even if it is related to the Arawakan languages, is not close enough to be relevant here.)

There are also some non-Taino toponyms from the area that Granberry &amp; Vescelius (2004) suggest may be [[Warao language|Waroid]]:

'''Maid''' is a title granted to the eldest daughter of a [[Laird]]. The title is not often used today but can still be used. The title is customary and not automatically given.

The eldest daughter of a Laird is entitled to place the title at the end of her name along with the Lairdship therefore becoming "Miss [Firstname] [Lastname], Maid of [Lairdship]." Only placing the word "Maid" at the end of the name is incorrect as the Lairdship must be included.

As the title is customary and not automatic, it means that the eldest daughter can choose if they wish to take on this title, if they choose not to they are simply addressed as "Miss [Firstname] [Lastname] of [Lairdship]"

If the eldest daughter is the [[heir apparent]] to a Lairdship, she has the choice to either take on the title "Younger" (see. [[Younger (title)]]) or to remain titled as "Maid of [x]". Once they take on the Lairdship in their own right they will then become styled as "Lady" and the title of "Maid of [x]" will pass onto their eldest daughter if any.

The title "maid of [x]" is held for life unless the eldest daughter becomes a "Lady" in her own right and so no one else can be given this title during the lifetime of another Maid. If a Laird has a son who is the [[heir apparent]] but still has an elder daughter she is still entitled to become styled as Maid

==Forms of address==

If the eldest daughter of a Laird chooses to accept the title it would be styled as "Miss [Forename] [Surname], Maid of [Lairdship]" (e.g. Miss Jane Smith, Maid of Edinburgh). If the eldest daughter should marry she will still hold the title.

If a Laird has any younger daughters they are styled as "Miss [Forename] [Surname] of [Lairdship]"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1821">'''''Michaelis''''' is a brand of [[dictionary|dictionaries]] of the [[portuguese language]] published in [[Brasil]] by [[Melhoramentos publishing company]]. There are also under this brand books about the grammar of a variety of foreign languages. The first Michaelis dictionary was created by the end of the 19th century by the German lexicographer [[Henriette Michaelis]], in a partnership with her sister [[Carolina Michaelis de Vasconcelos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://michaelis.uol.com.br/|title=Sobre o dicionário {{!}} Michaelis On-Line|website=Michaelis On-Line|language=pt-br|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dictionary has versions in the following languages:
* Portuguese
* [[English (language)|English]]
* [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]]
* [[Italian (language)|Italian]]
* [[French (language)|French]]
* [[German (language)|German]]
* [[Japanese (language)|Japanese]]

== Controversy ==
In July 2015, an online petition was created on Change.org demanding the dictionary to review the definition of "marriage". The definition was, among others, a "legitimate union between man and woman". The petition requested that the word "people" were used instead of "man" and "woman". The petition got more than three thousand endorsements. The director of Melhoramentos abided by and made the requested changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://g1.globo.com/tecnologia/noticia/2015/07/dicionario-michaelis-muda-verbete-de-casamento-apos-pressao-online.html|title=Dicionário Michaelis muda verbete de casamento após pressão online|date=2015-07-02|work=Tecnologia e Games|access-date=2017-11-08|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mobile cell sites''' are [[infrastructures]] transportable on trucks, allowing fast and easy installation in restricted spaces. Their use is strategic for the rapid expansion of [[cellular network]]s putting into service point-to-point radio connections, as well as supporting sudden increases of mobile traffic in case of extraordinary events (trade fairs, sports events and concerts, emergencies, catastrophic events, etc.). Mobile cell sites are also used by law enforcement organizations to gather intelligence.
Mobile cell sites require neither civil works nor foundations, just minimal requirements like commercial power and grounding. The mobile units have been designed to be a temporary solution, but if requested, they can be transformed into a permanent station.

== Different kinds of mobile cell sites ==

There are several different kinds of mobile cell sites, every one of which has different usage characteristics.

=== Rapid-deployment units (RDU) ===

RDUs are mobile radio base stations transportable on trucks. Their use is strategic for the rapid expansion of cellular networks.
 
A rapid deployment flanged pole is a mobile radio base station infrastructure transportable on truck, allowing fast and easy installation in restricted spaces. The antenna supporting pole, with climbing ladder up to the summit, is fixed to the main base frame and is composed of cylindrical flanged sections integrated by two or three sets of guys with a standard height of up to 30 meters. 
The flanged pole mobile station, installable in eight hours, does not require civil works or foundations, and is complete, including lateral ballast concrete weights and a working platform in checkered plate.

[[File:MFUC Palo flangiato.jpg|thumb|MFUC: Flanged pole with telescopic stabilizers]]

A radio station kit is an integrated radio base station RDU in which the equipment housing is a special 20” container equipped to contain, during transportation, all the station infrastructures, assembly accessories, radiant systems, storage batteries, electrical and radio equipment. It is a structure which can be quickly and easily transported and assembled on site, without the need of civil works or foundations and suitable for any environment.

[[File:KIST.jpg|thumb|left|KIST: an integrated radio base station (RDU) which can be quickly and easily transported and assembled on site]]

A rapid deployment compact kitstat is a flanged pole RDU which allows easy and fast erection in narrow sites, without any need of foundation or civil works. The antenna supporting structure supplied complete with climbing ladder and anchored to the steelwork base frame, is a flanged pole composed by tubular flanged sections with a height up to 30 m and two or three steel guys series.

[[File:KICO.jpg|thumb|KICO: a compact kitstat with flanged pole]]

A quickrawland with polygonal pole is an RDU which allows an easy and fast erection in narrow sites, without any need of foundation or civil works. It is provided with a polygonal pole with a height up to 30 m; it has a climbing ladder with rigid anchor line (EN353-1) and vertical fixing system for feeders and service cables.

[[File:Qkrl.jpg|thumb|left|QKRL: a mobile cell site with a polygonal pole with a height up to 30 m]]

=== Cell on wheels ===
[[Image:CellularPCScom1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|COW in parking lot of the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]], Pasadena, California for the [[2005 Rose Bowl]] game, with its own power generator]]
Cells on wheels (COW), or site on wheels,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.techopedia.com/definition/26001/cell-on-wheels-cow Definition of Cell on Wheels (COW)&lt;/ref&gt; are telecom infrastructures, placed on trailer approved for road use, towed by heavy goods vehicles for loads of up to 3500&amp;nbsp;kg. These mobile radio base stations guarantee full operation in just one day and in restricted spaces. COWs provide fully functional service, via vehicles such as trailers, vans and trucks, to areas affected by natural disaster or areas with large user volume, such as major events.  The [[backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul]] to the [[PSTN|network]] can be via terrestrial [[microwave]], [[communication satellite]], or existing wired [[infrastructure]].

Mobile radio base stations with flanged pole are mobile support structures composed of a special trailer with retracting stabilizers approved for road use. The antenna supporting pole, with climbing ladder up to the summit, is fixed to the main base frame and it is composed of cylindrical flanged sections integrated by two or three sets of guys with a standard height of up to 20 meters. The flanged pole mobile station, installable in eight hours, does not require civil works or foundations, and is complete of lateral ballast concrete weights and a working platform in checkered plate.

[[File:Mftr mobiflanged.jpg|thumb|MFTR: Cell on wheel with flanged pole, placed on trailer approved for road use]]

A rapid deployment self-mounting pole is a mobile supporting structure corresponds to a special two-axle trailer with telescopic stabilizers approved for road traffic.
The antenna supporting pole, with standard height of up to 20 m, is made of aluminium and consists of three telescopic tubular elements. Installation is easy and fast, and is carried out with manual winches.

[[File:CoW.jpg|thumb|left|MTUC: Compact self-mounting pole]]

Another RDU is a mobile cell site with self-mounting pole; that can be towed by heavy goods vehicles for loads of up to 7500&amp;nbsp;kg. The antenna supporting pole, with a standard height of up to 20 m, is made of aluminium and consists of three telescopic tubular elements. Installation is easy, fast and is carried out by means of manual winches.

[[File:Mtco.jpg|thumb|MTCO: mobile cell site with self-mounting pole]]

Mobile station on trailer is a mobile stations with telescopic mast are portable structures, towed by heavy goods vehicles for loads of up to 12000&amp;nbsp;kg. The antenna supporting pole, with a standard height of up to 30 m, is made of steel and consists of three telescopic tubular elements. Installation is easy, fast and is carried out with manual or electric winches.

[[File:Srta.jpg|thumb|left|SRTA: mobile cell site with telescopic mast up to 30 m]]

====Expanded or emergency service====
COWs are used to provide expanded cellular network coverage and/or capacity for short-term demands, such as at special events such as major sporting events ([[Super Bowl]], [[World Series]], [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]]), major [[convention (meeting)|convention]]s, or in [[disaster]] areas where cellular coverage either was minimal, never present (e.g., in a [[wilderness]] area where [[firefighters]] have set up a [[command center]] during a major [[forest fire]]) or was compromised by the disaster (e.g., in the [[Gulf Coast]] after [[Hurricane Katrina]]).

Following the [[September 11 attacks]] on New York City in 2001, 36 cellular COWs were deployed by September 14, 2001 in [[Lower Manhattan]] to support the U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) and provide critical phone service to rescue and recovery workers.

COWs provided cellular service in [[Southwest Florida]] in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Charley]] in 2004 when most of the area's stationary cell towers were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.operationgadget.com/2004/08/mobile_carriers.html&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, 26 cell-on-wheels units were put in place in [[Washington, D.C.]] for the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inauguration of Barack Obama]] to handle the [[mass call event|millions of extra people and their calls]] in the city, especially on and near the [[National Mall]]. In January 2017 additional COWs, both temporary, and permanent, have been installed at the National Mall for the [[inauguration of Donald Trump]] as well as for future inaugurations and other events due to the steady rise in [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]-based [[Smartphone|smartphones]] and other devices in the later half of the [[2010s]].    

Many telecommunications companies also use COWs for long-term placement when financing or infrastructure considerations prevent building a permanent site at the location. For instance, a carrier may have approved the placement of a [[cell site]] for coverage reasons, but the remaining budget is inadequate to fund the construction for a [[fiscal quarter]] or even longer.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} An engineering team may be able to place a COW on location to provide immediate coverage with few costs other than [[leasing]], [[electricity]], and [[backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul]]. The decision to use a COW for an extended period of time may also be driven by the property owner. Installations on government or military facilities may be granted only on a temporary basis and may require the use of non-permanent facilities.

=== Cell on truck ===

A '''cell on truck''' is a particular kind of mobile cell site that is composed of mobile trucks with container and with self-mounting telescopic mast. They are portable structures that guarantee full operation in three hours and in restricted spaces.
The steel interface frame is made of galvanized steel beams and is provided with four retracting stabilizers that can be retracted under the container for transport. The equipment and power container, which has a reinforced special 20' box container with two access doors, divided by an intermediate partition to create two separate rooms (E and A). Room A is used for housing the electrical and radio equipment. Room E is used as a power room for housing the generating set; and also, during transport, to contain the radiant systems and accessory components.
The antenna supporting pole, with standard height of up to 20 m, is made of aluminium and consists of three telescopic tubular elements. Installation is easy, fast and is carried out with manual winches.

== Phonology ==
Nambya is a [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]] language. It has a simple 5 vowel system and a typical Bantu consonant-vowel (CV) [[syllable]] structure. The language has onsetless syllables, but these are restricted to the word-initial position, making Nambya typical of the [[Southern Bantu languages]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{For|the album by Gwenno|Y Dydd Olaf (album)}}.

'''Owain Owain''' (11 December 1929 – 19 December 1993)&lt;ref&gt;Births and Deaths Register, Owen Owen, born December 1929, Mother's maiden name before marriage: Williams; Area of Registration: Caernarfon, Volume Number: 11b, Page: 542; area [[Caernarfon]] - December 1993 area [[Caernarfon]] England and Wales Register of Deaths, Owain Owain, December 1993, Born: 11 December 1929, Registration Area: Caernarfon, Number on Register: 40, Reference number: 46.&lt;/ref&gt; was a Welsh novelist, short-story writer and poet. He also founded ''[[Tafod y Ddraig]]'' (The Dragon's Tongue), which became the [[Welsh Language Society]]'s main voice from its birth in the 1960s to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;'' 'Trwy Ddulliau Chwyldro...?'', Dylan Phyllips, Gwasg Gomer Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having worked as a nuclear scientist in [[Windscale]] for a few years, he returned home to Wales in 1956 with his wife Eira, and settled down in [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] to raise a family of four children, one of whom was [[Robin Llwyd ab Owain]]. He was a member of [[Mensa International]], and created new protests for the [[Welsh Language Society]] as the secretary of the first branch, at [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wyt Ti'n Cofio?'' by Gwilym Tudur (Gwasg y Lolfa Press, 1989). "The only branch at the time was set up by Owain Owain in Bangor; and to all intent and purpose, he was the society at that time (early 1960s)!"&lt;/ref&gt; Owain also sketched the society's logo (a red dragon's tongue) which continues to be their badge and logo. This early sketch can be seen at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth and on his official website (see below). Leading politician [[Dafydd Iwan]] says on his website, "He inspired my generation and laid down strong foundations on which the [[Welsh Language Society]] was built."

His science fiction book entitled ''Y Dydd Olaf'' ("The Last Day") was described by the [[Welsh-language literature|Welsh literary]] critic [[Pennar Davies]] in the book's preface: "Nothing like this book has been seen before either in our language or in any other language. We should rejoice that such brilliance exists  in Welsh writing."&lt;ref&gt;''Y Dydd Olaf'' by Owain Owain published by Christopher Davies Publishers, Swansea, 1976. {{oclc|40166195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

Suryanarayana Sastri was born at Vilacheri near [[Thirupparankundram]] in a [[Brahmin]] family.&lt;ref name="tamil_nadu_endowments_department"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tntdpc.com/government/tdc.pdf |format=PDF |title=TAMIL DEVELOPMENT – CULTURE AND RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS DEPARTMENT, POLICY NOTE 2006 – 2007, Demand No. 46 |accessdate=9 September 2008 |publisher=Tamil Nadu Government |year=2006–2007 |author=M.

In 1895, Suryanarayana Sastri rose to become the Head of Department for Tamil at the Madras Christian College.&lt;ref name="contributions_recalled" /&gt;

== Campaign for recognition of Tamil as classical language ==

Suryanarayana Sastri had immense love for Tamil and wrote plenty of books.&lt;ref name="parithimar_kalaignar_memorial1"/&gt; He even changed his Sanskrit name to its Tamil translation.&lt;ref name="tamil_culture"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Tamils and Their Culture| last=Sastri| first=K. S. Ramaswami| year=1967| pages=47| publisher=Annamalai University| location=Chennai | isbn=81-7755-405-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Madras University]] proposed to exclude Tamil from its syllabus, Parithimar Kalaignar vehemently protested against the proposal forcing the authorities to drop the move.&lt;ref name="contributions_recalled" /&gt; In 1902, he proposed that Tamil be designated as a "classical language" thereby becoming the first person to make such a petition.&lt;ref name="parithimar_kalaignar_memorial1" /&gt; Parithimar Kalignar is also known as '''Dravida Sastri'''.&lt;ref name="parithimar_kalaignar_memorial2"&gt;{{cite news | last= | first=  | title= Parithimar Kalaignar’ memorial opened    | date=1 November 2007 | url = http://www.hindu.com/2007/11/01/stories/2007110161471000.htm | work = The Hindu: Tamil Nadu | accessdate = 9 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parithimar Kalaignar was also the first to use the Tamil name ''Kumarinadu'' for the mythical lost-land of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]].&lt;ref name="lemuria"&gt;{{cite book | title=Fabulous Geographies Catastropic Histories: The Lost Land of Lemuria| last=Ramaswamy| first=Sumathi| year=2005| pages=104| publisher=Orient Longman| isbn=978-81-7824-110-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==

Paritihimar Kalaignar died in 1903 due to [[tuberculosis]]&lt;ref name="parithimar_kalaignar_memorial1" /&gt; at the age of 33.&lt;ref name="parithimar_kalaignar_memorial2" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
[[File:Parithimar Kalaignar 2007 stamp of India.jpg|thumb|Kalaignar on a 2007 stamp of India]]
Parithimar Kalaignar is regarded as an inspiration for Tamil enthusiasts as [[Maraimalai Adigal]] and the [[Tanittamil Iyakkam]].

In 2006, the Government of Tamil Nadu declared Parithimar Kalaignar's house in his native village of Vilacheri as a memorial and sanctioned a sum of rupees 15 lakh towards nationalizing his books.&lt;ref name="parithimar_kalaignar_memorial1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nationalization"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tn.gov.in/budget/archives/budsp07_08_3.htm |title=Budget Speech 2007–2008 |accessdate=9 September 2008 |publisher=Government of Tamil Nadu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924210632/http://www.tn.gov.in/budget/archives/budsp07_08_3.htm |archivedate=24 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 August 2007, postage stamps were issued in memory of Saint Vallalar, Parithimar Kalaignar and Maraimalai Adigal.&lt;ref name="contributions_recalled" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stamp_journal"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Madhukar Jhingan, Savita Jhingan| title=The News, Views, &amp; Features on Philately &amp; Postal Services of India| journal=Stamps of India Collectors Companion| year=2007| issue=303| page=2| url=http://www.stampsofindia.com/newssite/Download/303.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Persistence''' in [[linguistics]] refers to one of the five principles by which [[grammaticalisation]] can be detected while it is taking place. The other four are: [[Layering (linguistics)|layering]], [[Divergence (linguistics)|divergence]], [[specialization (linguistics)|specialisation]], and [[de-categorialisation]].

"When a form undergoes grammaticalization from a [[lexicon|lexical]] to a [[grammatical function]], as long as it is grammatically viable some traces of its original lexical meanings tend to adhere to it, and details of its lexical history may be reflected in constraints on its grammatical distribution." ([[Paul Hopper|Hopper]] 1991: 22)

"The principle of persistence relates the meaning and function of a grammatical form to its history as a [[lexicon|lexical]] [[morpheme]]. This relationship is often completely opaque by the stage of [[morphologisation]], but during intermediate stages it may be expected that a form will be polysemous, and that one or more of its meaning will reflect a dominant earlier meaning." (Hopper 1991: 28) In other words, grammaticalisation can be a 'diachronic' explanatory parameter for certain otherwise hard-to-explain 'synchronic' ([[semantics|semantic]] and distributional) properties of grammatical signs.
&lt;br /&gt;
The lexical roots of a grammaticalised feature may remain visible in its grammatical function and may influence its grammatical distribution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7307">[[File:Gwalior-adinath1.jpg|thumb|The Adinatha statue at the Gwalior fort was consecrated by Raidhu]]
'''Raidhu''' ([[IAST]]: Raidhū, 1393-1489) was an [[Apabhramsha]] poet from [[Gwalior]], and an important figure in the [[Digambara]] [[Jain]] community. He supervised the [[pratishtha]] consecration ceremony of many—perhaps most—of the [[Jain]] idols carved on the hill side in the [[Gwalior Fort]] during the rule of [[Tomaras of Gwalior|Tomara]] rulers Dungarasimha and Kirtisimha.{{sfn|Phyllis Granoff|2006|p=31}}

== Biography ==

Raidhu was born in the Padmavati Purval Jain community,&lt;ref&gt;Padmavati Purval Digambar Jain Jati ka Udbhav aur Vikas, Ramjit Jain, Pragatishil Padmavati Purval Digambar Jain Sangathan Panjikrut, 2005, p. 77-79&lt;/ref&gt; as he himself acknowledged. His birth place is uncertain, but he appears to have spent most of his life in or around Gwalior.{{sfn|Phyllis Granoff|2006|p=32}} He was a lay disciple of the Jain leader Bramha Shripal, who was a disciple of [[Bhattaraka]] Yashahkiriti of [[Kashtha Sangha]].

Raidhu was an important figure in the Gwalior court, where he stayed at the invitation of the Tomara king Dungarasimha.{{sfn|Phyllis Granoff|2006|p=34}} He was also a close associate of the Digambara ascetics ([[Bhattaraka]]s) who were influential in the Tomara court.{{sfn|Phyllis Granoff|2006|p=32}} Besides, Raidhu was patronized by several wealthy Jain merchants. Raidhu played a central role in connecting these different groups together: he authored religious books for the wealthy merchants, and encouraged them to donate money towards religious causes.{{sfn|Phyllis Granoff|2006|p=34}}

Raidhu's powerful and wealthy sponsors helped disseminate his literary works, some of which are lavishly illustrated (e.g. ''Jasodharacariu'').{{sfn|Phyllis Granoff|2006|p=34}} These patrons included Kamalasimha, Yashahkirti, Khelha Brahmachari, Sanghadhipati Nemadasa and Asapati. Kamalasimha started the development of Gwalior as a Jain holy place, with support from the Tomara rulers Dungarasimha and Kirtisimha. The Digambara monk Yashahkirti and Khelha Brahmachari encouraged Raidhu to write ''Sammaijiṇacariu'', a biography of [[Mahavira]]. Khelha also commissioned the colossal image of Chandraprabha. Sanghadhipati Nemadasa was a patron of Raidhu's poem ''Puṇṇāsavakahākosa'', and also built a Jain shrine on his recommendation. Asapati was a minister of the Tomara king Dungarasimha.{{sfn|Phyllis Granoff|2006|p=33}}

== Jain images ==

Raidhu was also responsible for consecrating many of the Jain rock carvings inside the fort, as attested by multiple inscriptions.{{sfn|Phyllis Granoff|2006|p=31}} These include the two colossal images of [[Rishabhanatha|Adinatha]] (57 feet) and [[Chandraprabha]].{{sfn|Phyllis Granoff|2006|p=32}} Medieval Jain texts state that certain sacred mountains covered with images of [[Arihant (Jainism)|Jinas]] would survive the destruction of the world. Raidhu's poems often mention the [[end time]]s (''[[kaliyuga]]''), and several near-contemporary poets also allude to the end times amid the [[Muslim conquests of the Indian subcontinent|Muslim conquests]]. Therefore, it appears that the colossal Jain images were intended to ensure the survival of Gopalagiri (the Gwalior fort hill) in the end times.{{sfn|Phyllis Granoff|2006|p=31, 41-44}}

Raidhu composed several poems in [[Apabhramsha]], many of which have survived. He composed many of these poems while living in the Jain temples of Gopalagiri.{{sfn|Phyllis Granoff|2006|p=32}} Raja Ram Jain translated Raidhu's poems into [[Hindi]] language.{{sfn|Phyllis Granoff|2006|p=32}}

Nevertheless, Russian is a widely used language in Ukraine in pop culture and informal and business communications.&lt;ref name=RiUHR1/&gt;

==History of Russian language in Ukraine==
{{Main|History of the Russian language in Ukraine}}
The East Slavic languages originated in the language spoken in [[Rus (region)|Rus]]. Significant differences in spoken language in different regions began to be noticed{{by whom|date=September 2014}} after the division of the Rus lands between the [[Golden Horde]] (from about 1240) and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Lithuania eventually allied with the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Muscovites under the Golden Horde developed the modern Russian language, people in the northern Lithuanian sector developed Belorussian, and in the southern Polish sector Ukrainian.

It is worth noting that the ethnonym ''Ukrainian'' for the people was not well established until the 19th century, although their land was known as ''Ukraine'' in English since before the 18th century. The land was known in the West as [[Ruthenia]], and the people as Ruthenians.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} (The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] traces the word "Ukrainian" in English back as far as 1804.) The Russian imperial centre, however, preferred the names "Little" and "White" Russias for the Ukrainian and [[Belarus]]ian lands respectively, as compared to [[Great Russia]].

No definitive geographical border separated people speaking Russian and those speaking Ukrainian - rather gradual shifts in vocabulary and pronunciation marked the areas between the historical cores of the languages. Since the 20th century, however, people have started to identify themselves with their spoken vernacular and to conform to the literary norms set by academics.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Although the ancestors of a small ethnic group of Russians - [[Goriuns]] resided in [[Putyvl]] region (what is modern northern Ukraine)
in the times of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] or perhaps even earlier,&lt;ref name="conf"&gt;F.D. Klimchuk, About ethnolinguistic history of [[Pridnestrovie|Left Bank of Dnieper]] (in connection to the ethnogenesis of Goriuns). Published in "Goriuns: history, language, culture" Proceedings of International Scientific Conference, (Institute of Linguistics, Russian Academy of Sciences, February 13, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kongr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kngu.org/KongrUkr/Communit/ObzhRuss.htm|title=Russians in Ukraine|publisher=|accessdate=December 28, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519054819/http://www.kngu.org/KongrUkr/Communit/ObzhRuss.htm|archivedate=May 19, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Russian language in Ukraine has primarily come to exist in that country through two channels: through the migration of ethnic [[Russians]] into Ukraine and through the adoption of the Russian language by [[Ukrainians]].

===Russian settlers===
The first new waves of Russian settlers onto what is now Ukrainian territory came in the late 16th century to the empty lands of [[Slobozhanshchyna]] that [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]] gained from the [[Golden Horde|Tatars]],&lt;ref name="kongr" /&gt; although Ukrainian peasants from the west escaping harsh exploitative conditions outnumbered them.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages%5CS%5CL%5CSlobidskaUkraine.htm|title=Slobidska Ukraine|website=www.encyclopediaofukraine.com|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More [[Russian speakers]] appeared in the northern, central and eastern territories of modern Ukraine during the late 17th century, following the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|Cossack Rebellion]] (1648–1657) which [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] led against Poland. The Khmelnytsky Uprising led to a massive movement of Ukrainian settlers to the Slobozhanshchyna region, which converted it from a sparsely inhabited frontier area to one of the major populated regions of the [[Tsardom of Russia]]. Following the [[Pereyaslav Rada]] of 1654 the modern northern and eastern parts of Ukraine entered into the Russian Tsardom. This brought the first significant, but still small, wave of Russian settlers into central Ukraine (primarily several thousand soldiers stationed in garrisons,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; out of a population of approximately 1.2 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HNIs9O3EmtQC&amp;pg=PA149|title=Ukraine: A History|first=Orest|last=Subtelny|date=December 28, 2017|publisher=University of Toronto Press|accessdate=December 28, 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; non-Russians). Although the number of Russian settlers in Ukraine prior to the 18th century remained small, the local upper classes within the part of Ukraine acquired by Russia came to use the Russian language widely.

Beginning in the late 18th century, large numbers of Russians settled in newly acquired lands in what is now southern Ukraine, a region then known as [[Novorossiya]] ("New Russia"). These lands had been largely empty prior to the 18th century due to the threat of [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean Tatar]] raids, but once St Petersburg had eliminated the Tatar state as a threat, Russian nobles were granted large tracts of fertile land that was worked by newly arrived peasants, most of whom were ethnic Ukrainians but many of whom were Russians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30071/Ukraine#404474.hook|title=Ukraine - History, Geography, People, &amp; Language|author=|date=|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dramatic increase of Russian settlers===
[[File:Dialektologicheskaia Karta 1914 goda.jpeg|thumbnail|right|Linguistic map. [[Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences|Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences]], 1914. {{legend|#b3ff80|[[Little Russia|Smallrussian]] (Ukrainian)}}{{legend|#fec82c|[[Great Russia|Greatrussian]] (Russian)}}{{legend|#e6ccb3|[[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]}}]]
The 19th century saw a dramatic increase in the urban Russian population in what is now Ukraine, as ethnic Russian settlers moved into and populated the newly industrialised and growing towns.  At the beginning of the 20th century the Russians were the largest ethnic group in almost all large cities within Ukraine's modern borders, including the following: [[Kiev]] (54.2%), Kharkiv (63.1%), [[Odessa]] (49.09%), [[Mykolaiv]] (66.33%), [[Mariupol]] (63.22%), [[Luhansk]], (68.16%), [[Kherson]] (47.21%), [[Melitopol]] (42.8%), [[Dnipro]], (41.78%), [[Kropyvnytskyi]] (34.64%), [[Simferopol]] (45.64%), [[Yalta]] (66.17%), [[Kerch]] (57.8%), [[Sevastopol]] (63.46%).&lt;ref name="dnistr 342"&gt;Дністрянський М.С.

Лівів Літопис, видавництво ЛНУ імені Івана Франка, 2006, page 342 {{ISBN|966-7007-60-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ukrainian migrants who settled in these cities entered a Russian-speaking milieu (particularly with Russian-speaking administration) and needed to adopt the Russian language.

===Suppression of the Ukrainian language===
{{main|Russification of Ukraine}} 
The [[Russian Empire]] promoted the [[Russification|spread of the Russian language]] among the native Ukrainian population by actively refusing to acknowledge the existence of the Ukrainian language.

Alarmed by the threat of Ukrainian separatism (in its turn influenced by 1863 [[January Uprising|demands of Polish nationalists]]), the Russian Minister of Internal Affairs [[Pyotr Valuev]] in 1863 issued a [[Valuev Circular|secret decree]] that banned the publication of religious texts and educational texts written in the Ukrainian language&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite book| author=Miller, Alexei | title=''The Ukrainian Question. The Russian Empire and Nationalism in the Nineteenth Century| location= Budapest-New York | publisher= Central European University Press| year = 203 | ISBN =963-9241-60-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as non-grammatical, but allowed all other texts, including fiction.  The Emperor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] expanded this ban by issuing the [[Ems Ukaz]] in 1876 (which lapsed in 1905).  The Ukaz banned all Ukrainian language books and song lyrics, as well as the importation of such works.  Furthermore, Ukrainian-language public performances, plays, and lectures were forbidden.&lt;ref name=Magosci&gt;{{cite book| author=Magoscy, R. | title=A History of Ukraine| location= Toronto | publisher= University of Toronto Press | year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1881, the decree was amended to allow the publishing of lyrics and dictionaries, and the performances of some plays in the Ukrainian language with local officials' approval.  Ukrainian-only troupes were, however, forbidden. Approximately 9% of population spoke Russian at the time of the [[Russian Empire Census]] of 1897.

The Soviet Union in 1918, decreed that all nationalities in the Soviet Union had the right to education in their own language. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Thus Ukrainians since that time were entitled to study and learn in the Ukrainian language. During the Soviet times, the attitude to Ukrainian language and culture went through periods of promotion (policy of "[[korenization]]"), suppression (during the period of [[Stalinism]]), and Ukrainization (with the epoch of [[Khrushchev]]). Ukrainian cultural organizations, such as theatres or the Writers' Union, were funded by the central administration. While officially there was no state language in the Soviet Union until 1990, Russian in practice had an implicitly privileged position as the only language widely spoken across the country. In 1990 Russian became legally the official all-Union language of the [[Soviet Union]], with constituent republics having rights to declare their own official languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nn3xDTiL0PQC&amp;pg=PA1|title=Language Policy in the Soviet Union|first=L.

===Ukrainization in modern Ukraine===
{{main|Ukrainization}}
Since the [[Euromaidan]], Ukrainian government issued several laws aimed at enforced Ukrainization in media, education and other spheres.

In February 2017 the Ukrainian government banned the commercial importation of books from Russia, which had accounted for up to 60% of all titles sold.&lt;ref name=guardian-20170214/&gt;

On May 23, 2017, [[Ukrainization#Mass media|Ukrainian parliament approved the law]] that most of the broadcast content should be in Ukrainian (75% of national carriers and 50% of local carriers).

[[Ukrainization#2017 law "On Education"|The new 2017 law on education]]  says that Ukrainian language is the language of education at all levels except for one or more subjects that are allowed to be taught in two or more languages, namely [[English language|English]] or one of the other [[official languages of the European Union]] (i.e., excluding Russian).&lt;ref name=law&gt;[http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/2145-19/page Про освіту] | від 05.09.2017 № 2145-VIII (Сторінка 1 з 7)&lt;/ref&gt; The law does state that "persons belonging to [[indigenous peoples of Ukraine]] are guaranteed the right to study in public facilities of preschool and primary education in the language of instruction of the respective indigenous people, along with the state language of instruction" in separate classes or groups.&lt;ref name=law/&gt; PACE describes this as a significant curtailing of the rights of indigenous peoples carried out without consultations with their representatives.&lt;ref name=PACE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-XML2HTML-EN.asp?fileid=24218&amp;lang=en|title=PACE - Resolution 2189 (2017) - The new Ukrainian law on education: a major impediment to the teaching of national minorities' mother tongues|website=assembly.coe.int|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. On July 2018 The [[Mykolaiv]] [[Okrug]] Administrative Court liquidated the status of the Russian language as a regional one, on the suit (bringing to the norms of the national legislation due to the recognition of the law [[Language policy in Ukraine|"On the principles of the state language policy"]] by the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine]] as unconstitutional) of the First Deputy Prosecutor of the [[Mykolaiv Oblast]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date= |title=31.07.2018 |language=Ukrainian |url=https://myk.gp.gov.ua/ua/news.html?_m=publications&amp;_c=view&amp;_t=rec&amp;id=234068 |accessdate=2018-07-31 |department=Prosecutor's Office of [[Mykolaiv Oblast|Mykolaiv Region]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Current usage statistics==
[[File:UkraineNativeLanguagesCensus2001detailed-en.png|thumb|300px|Linguistical map of Ukraine according to [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 census]]]]
There is a large difference between the numbers of people whose native language is Russian and people who adopted Russian as their everyday [[lingua franca|communication language]]. Another thing to keep in mind is that the percentage of Russian-speaking citizens is significantly higher in cities than in rural areas across the whole country.

===2001 Census===
[[File:Ukraine census 2001 Russian.svg|thumb|right|280px|Percentage of people with Russian as their native language according to 2001 census (in regions).]]

According to official data from the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian census]], the Russian language is native for 29.6% of Ukraine's population (about 14.3 million people).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/|title=Results / General results of the census| accessdate=March 15, 2017|work=[[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian Census]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic [[Russians]] form 56% of the total Russian-native-language population, while the remainder are people of other ethnic background: 5,545,000 [[Ukrainians]], 172,000 [[Belarusians]], 86,000 [[Jews]], 81,000 [[Greeks]], 62,000 [[Bulgarians]], 46,000 [[Moldovans]], 43,000 [[Tatars]], 43,000 [[Armenians]], 22,000 [[Poles]], 21,000 [[Germans]], 15,000 [[Crimean Tatars]].

Therefore, the Russian-speaking population in Ukraine forms the largest linguistic group in modern Europe with its language being non-official in the state.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} The Russian-speaking population of Ukraine constitutes the largest [[Russophone]] community outside the [[Russian Federation]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Polls===
According to July 2012 polling by [[Sociological group "RATING"|RATING]] 50% of the surveyed adult residents over 18 years of age considered their native language to be Ukrainian, 29% said Russian, 20% identified both Russian and Ukrainian as their native language, 1% gave another language.&lt;ref name=RatingJuly12/&gt; 5% could not decide which language is their native one.&lt;ref name=RatingJuly12&gt;[http://ratinggroup.com.ua/en/products/politic/data/entry/14004/ The language question, the results of recent research in 2012], [[Sociological group "RATING"|RATING]] (25 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 80% of respondents stated they did not have any problems using their native language in 2011.&lt;ref name=RatingJuly12/&gt; 8% stated they had experienced difficulty in the execution (understanding) of official documents; mostly middle-aged and elderly people in [[South Ukraine]] and the [[Donets Basin]].&lt;ref name=RatingJuly12/&gt;

==Russian language in Ukrainian politics==

The Russian language in Ukraine is recognized as the language of a national minority but not as a state language. It is explicitly mentioned in the [[Constitution of Ukraine]] adopted by the parliament in 1996. Article 10 of the Constitution reads: ''"In Ukraine, the free development, use and protection of Russian, and other languages of national minorities of Ukraine, is guaranteed''".&lt;ref name=Constitution&gt;[http://www.rada.gov.ua/const/conengl.htm#r1 Article 10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521190059/http://www.rada.gov.ua/const/conengl.htm |date=May 21, 2011 }} of the Constitution says: "The state language of Ukraine is the Ukrainian language. The State ensures the comprehensive development and functioning of the Ukrainian language in all spheres of social life throughout the entire territory of Ukraine. In Ukraine, the free development, use and protection of Russian, and other languages of national minorities of Ukraine, is guaranteed."&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution declares Ukrainian language as the state language of the country, while other languages spoken in Ukraine are guaranteed constitutional protection. The Ukrainian language was adopted as the state language by the Law on Languages adopted in [[Ukrainian SSR]] in 1989; Russian was specified as the language of communication with the other republics of [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=LoL&gt;[http://www.minelres.lv/NationalLegislation/Ukraine/Ukraine_Language_English.htm On Languages in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.

{{main|Legislation on languages in Ukraine}}
The issue of Russian receiving the status of second official language has been the subject of extended controversial discussion ever since Ukraine became independent in 1991. In every Ukrainian election, many politicians, such as former president [[Leonid Kuchma]], used their promise of making Russian a second state language to win support. The recent [[President of Ukraine]], [[Viktor Yanukovych]] continued this practice when he was opposition leader. But in an interview with [[Kommersant]] during the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2010|2010 Ukrainian presidential election]]-campaign he stated that the status of Russian in Ukraine "is too politicized" and said that if elected President in 2010 he would "have a real opportunity to adopt a law on languages, which implements the requirements of the [[European Charter of regional languages]]". He implied these law would need 226 votes in the [[Ukrainian parliament]] (50% of the votes instead of the 75% of the votes needed to change the [[constitution of Ukraine]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.kommersant.ua/doc.html?docId=1289144 "Доверия к Тимошенко у меня нет и быть не может"], [[Kommersant]] (December 9, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; After his early 2010 election as President Yanukovych stated (on March 9, 2010) "Ukraine will continue to promote the Ukrainian language as its only state language".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/61283/ Yanukovych: Ukraine will not have second state language], [[Kyiv Post]] (March 9, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time he stressed that it also necessary to develop other regional languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://podrobnosti.ua/power/2010/03/09/670765.html Янукович: Русский язык не будет вторым государственным ], [[Подробности]] (March 9, 2010 13:10)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 a referendum took place in the [[Donetsk Oblast]] and the [[Luhansk Oblast]], with around 90% supporting the Russian language gaining status of an official language alongside [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], and for the Russian language to be an official language on a regional level; however, the referendum was annulled by the (central) [[Ukrainian government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thekievtimes.ua/society/372400-donbass-zabytyj-referendum-1994.html|title=Донбасс: забытый референдум-1994|date=May 12, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nakanune.ru/articles/18807/|title=Киев уже 20 лет обманывает Донбасс: Донецкая и Луганская области еще в 1994 году проголосовали за федерализацию, русский язык и евразийскую интеграцию|publisher=|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former president [[Viktor Yushchenko]], during his [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential campaign]], also claimed a willingness to introduce more equality for Russian speakers.

In 2006, the Kharkiv City Rada was the first to declare Russian to be a regional language.&lt;ref&gt;http://pravopys.vlada.kiev.ua/index.php?id=487&lt;/ref&gt; Following that, almost all southern and eastern oblasts ([[Luhansk Oblast|Luhansk]], Donetsk, [[Mykolaiv Oblast|Mykolaiv]], [[Kharkiv Oblast|Kharkiv]], [[Zaporizhia Oblast|Zaporizhia]], and [[Kherson Oblast|Kherson]] oblasts), and many major southern and eastern cities ([[Sevastopol]], [[Dnipropetrovsk]], [[Donetsk]], [[Yalta]], [[Luhansk]], [[Zaporizhia]], [[Kryvyi Rih]], [[Odessa]]) followed suit. Several courts overturned the decision to change the status of the Russian language in the cities of Kryvyi Rih, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhia and Mykolaiv while in Donetsk, Mykolaiv and Kharkiv oblasts it was retained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/world/06apr2007/katsapskamovavodesse.html|title=Russian language in Odessa is acknowledged as the second official government language ... |accessdate=March 7, 2007 |work=Newsru.com |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016 the importation "anti-Ukrainian" books from Russia was restricted. In February 2017 the Ukrainian government completely banned the commercial importation of books from Russia, which had accounted for up to 60% of all titles sold.&lt;ref name=guardian-20170214&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/14/ukraine-publishers-speak-out-against-ban-on-russian-books |title=Ukraine publishers speak out against ban on Russian books |first=Danuta |last=Kean |newspaper=The Guardian |date=14 February 2017 |accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a survey by the Research and Branding Group (June 2006), the majority of respondents supported the decisions of local authorities: 52% largely supported (including 69% of population of eastern oblasts and 56% of southern regions), 34% largely did not support the decisions, 9% - answered "partially support and partially not", 5% had no opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ura-inform.com/ru/print/politics/2006/07/17/resultati_oproso|title=Русскому языку — да, НАТО — нет, — говорят результаты социсследований - Новости|website=www.ura-inform.com|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an all-Ukrainian poll carried out in February 2008 by "Ukrainian Democratic Circle" 15% of those polled said that the language issue should be immediately solved,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-302319.html 80% of Ukrainians do not consider language issue a top-priority], [[UNIAN]] (23 February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; in November 2009 this was 14.7%; in the November 2009 poll 35.8% wanted both the Russian and Ukrainian language to be state languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/53566/ Poll: more than half of Ukrainians do not consider language issue pressing], [[Kyiv Post]] (November 25, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to polling by [[Sociological group "RATING"|RATING]] the level of support for granting Russian the status of a state language decreased (from 54% to 46%) and the number of opponents increased (from 40% to 45%) between 2009 and May 2012;&lt;ref name="RatingJuly12"/&gt; in July 2012 41% of respondents supported granting Russian the status of a state language and 51% opposed it.&lt;ref name=RatingJuly12/&gt; (In July 2012) among the biggest supporters of bilingualism were residents of the Donets Basin (85%), [[South Ukraine]] (72%) and [[East Ukraine]] (50%).&lt;ref name=RatingJuly12/&gt; A further poll conducted by RATING in September–October 2012 found 51% opposed granting official status to the Russian language, whereas 41% supported it.

===Other surveys===
Although officially Russian speakers comprise about 30% (2001 census), 39% of Ukrainians interviewed in a 2006 survey believed that the rights of Russophones were violated&lt;ref&gt;According to parliamentary deputy [[Vadym Kolesnichenko]], the official policies of the Ukrainian state are discriminatory towards the Russian-speaking population. The Russian speaking population received 12 times less state funding than the tiny Romanian-speaking population in 2005-2006. Education in Russian is nearly nonexistent in all central and western oblasts and Kiev. The Russian language is no longer in higher education in all Ukraine, including areas with a Russian-speaking majority. The broadcasting in Russian averaged 11.6% (TV) and 3.5% (radio) in 2005{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}. Kolesnichenko is a member of [[Party of Regions]] with majority of electorate in eastern and south Russian-speaking regions.&lt;/ref&gt; because the Russian language is not official in the country, whereas 38% had the opposite position.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.podrobnosti.ua/society/2006/12/04/373924.html|title=Большинство украинцев говорят на русском языке|date=December 4, 2006|publisher=|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regnum.ru/news/749712.html|title=Украинцы лучше владеют русским языком, чем украинским: соцопрос|publisher=|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cross-national survey found that 0.5% of respondents felt they were discriminated against because of their language.&lt;ref name="EU-Ukraine"&gt;Evhen Golovakha, Andriy Gorbachyk, Natalia Panina, "Ukraine and Europe: Outcomes of International Comparative Sociological Survey", Kiev, Institute of Sociology of NAS of Ukraine, 2007, {{ISBN|978-966-02-4352-1}}, pp. 133-135 in Section: "9.

==Use of Russian in specific spheres==

===Russian literature in Ukraine===
[[File:H. L. Oldie.jpg|thumbnail|270px|[[H. L. Oldie|Oleg Ladyzhensky and Dmitry Gromov]], two Russophone Ukrainian co-authors, were named Europe's best science fiction writers in 2006 by [[European Science Fiction Society|ESFS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esfs.info/esfs-awards/2000-2009/|title=2000 – 2009|date=May 26, 2013|publisher=|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
Historically, many famous writers of Russian literature were born and lived in Ukraine. [[Nikolai Gogol]] is probably the most famous example of shared Russo-Ukrainian heritage: Ukrainian by descent, he wrote in Russian, and significantly contributed to culture of both nations. Russian author [[Mikhail Bulgakov]] was born in [[Kiev]], as well as poet [[Ilya Erenburg]]. A number of notable Russian writers and poets hailed from [[Odessa]], including [[Ilya Ilf and Yevgeny Petrov]], [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[Isaak Babel]]. Russian child poet [[Nika Turbina]] was born in [[Yalta]], Crimea.

A significant number of contemporary authors from Ukraine write in Russian.&lt;ref name="pentacle"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oldie |first1=H.L. |last2=Dyachenko |first2=Marina and Sergey |last3=Valentinov |first3=Andrey|year=2005 |script-title=ru:Пять авторов в поисках ответа (послесловие к роману "Пентакль") |trans-title=Five authors in search for answers (an afterword to Pentacle) |language= Russian|location=Moscow |publisher=Eksmo |isbn=5-699-09313-3 |quote=Украиноязычная фантастика переживает сейчас не лучшие дни. ... Если же говорить о фантастике, написанной гражданами Украины в целом, независимо от языка (в основном, естественно, на русском), — то здесь картина куда более радужная. В Украине сейчас работают более тридцати активно издающихся писателей-фантастов, у кого регулярно выходят книги (в основном, в России), кто пользуется заслуженной любовью читателей; многие из них являются лауреатами ряда престижных литературных премий, в том числе и международных. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Speculative fiction in Ukrainian is living through a hard time today... Speaking of fiction written by Ukrainian citizens, regardless of language (primarily Russian, of course), there's a brighter picture. More than 30 fantasy and science fiction writers are active here, their books are regularly published (in Russia, mostly), they enjoy the readers' love they deserve; many are recipients of prestigious literary awards, including international.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially notable within [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] genres.&lt;ref name="pentacle"/&gt; Kharkiv is considered the "capital city" of Ukrainian sci-fi and fantasy, it is home to several popular Russophone Ukrainian writers, such as [[H. L. Oldie]] (pen name for Oleg Ladyzhensky and Dmitry Gromov),&lt;ref&gt;[http://oldie.ru/ru/authors/2009-09-22-04-28-24.html H. L. Oldie official website: biography] (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Zorich]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zorich.ru/author/ealexander_zorich_biography.htm Alexander Zorich biography] (English)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrei Valentinov]], and [[Yuri Nikitin (author)|Yuri Nikitin]]. [[Science fiction convention]] ''Zvezdny Most'' (Rus. for "Star Bridge") is held in Kharkiv annually. Russophone Ukrainian writers also hail from Kiev, those include [[Marina and Sergey Dyachenko]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dyachenko-writers.com/about/ Marina and Sergey Dyachenko: Writers About Themselves] (English)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vladimir Arenev]]. [[Max Frei]] hails from Odessa, and [[Vera Kamsha]] was born in [[Lviv]]. Other Russophone Ukrainian writers of sci-fi and fantasy include [[Vladimir Vasilyev (writer)|Vladimir Vasilyev]], [[Vladislav Rusanov]], [[Alexander Mazin]] and [[Fyodor Berezin]]. ''[[RBG-Azimuth]]'', Ukraine's largest sci-fi and fantasy magazine, is published in Russian, as well as now defunct ''Realnost Fantastiki''.&lt;ref name="first_issue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivsf.narod.ru/2006/rbg_azimut/index.htm |title=Архив фантастики |publisher=Archivsf.narod.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside science fiction and fantasy, there is also a number of Russophone realist writers and poets. Ukrainian literary magazine ''Sho'' listed [[Alexander Kabanov (writer)|Alexander Kabanov]], [[Boris Khersonsky]], [[Andrey Polyakov]], [[Andrey Kurkov]] and [[Vladimir Rafeyenko]] as best Russophone Ukrainian writers of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sho.kiev.ua/news/59901|title=Писатель, знай свое место - Журнал "Шо"|website=www.sho.kiev.ua|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to H. L. Oldie, writing in Russian is an easier way for Ukrainian authors to be published and reach a broader audience. The authors say that it is because of Ukraine's ineffective book publishing policy: while Russian publishers are interested in popular literature, Ukrainian publishers rely mostly on [[grant (money)|grant]] givers.&lt;ref name="pentacle"/&gt; Many Ukrainian publishers agree and complain about low demand and low profitability for books in Ukrainian, compared to books in Russian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.kontrakty.ua/gc/2006/25/3-zaplati-za-kapitalizaciyu.html  Книгоиздание в Украине: мнения экспертов] - «Контракты» №25 Июнь 2006г.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the media===
A 2012 study showed that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://life.pravda.com.ua/society/2012/11/9/115486/|title=Українська мова втрачає позиції в освіті та книговиданні, але тримається в кінопрокаті|publisher=|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* on the radio, 3.4% of songs were in Ukrainian while 60% were in Russian
* over 60% of newspapers, 83% of journals and 87% of books were in Russian
* 28% of TV programs were in Ukrainian, even on state-owned channels

Russian-language programming is sometimes subtitled in Ukrainian, and commercials during Russian-language programs are in Ukrainian on Ukraine-based media.

On March 11, 2014, amidst [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine]], the Ukrainian National Council on Television and Radio Broadcasting shut down the broadcast of [[Russia]]n television channels [[Rossiya 24]], [[Channel One Russia]], [[RTR Planeta]], and [[NTV (Russia)|NTV Mir]] in Ukraine.&lt;ref name="BRTiU11314"&gt;http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/half-of-ukraines-providers-stop-broadcasting-russian-television-channels-339047.html&lt;br/&gt;http://en.ria.ru/world/20140311/188326369/Russia-Slams-Violation-of-Media-Freedoms-in-Ukraine.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26546083 Ukraine hits back at Russian TV onslaught], [[BBC News]] (12 March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Since 19 August 2014 Ukraine has blocked 14 Russian television channels "to protect its media space from aggression from Russia, which has been deliberately inciting hatred and discord among Ukrainian citizens".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/19/us-ukraine-crisis-television-idUSKBN0GJ1QM20140819 Ukraine bans Russian TV channels for airing war 'propaganda'], [[Reuters]] (19 August 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In early June 2015 162 Russian movies and TV series were banned in Ukraine because they were seen to contains popularization, agitation and/or propaganda for the [[2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine]] (this military intervention is denied by Russia).&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2015/06/4/7070188/ Released list of 162 banned Russian movies and TV series], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (4 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/moscow-stifles-dissent-as-russian-soldiers-return-from-ukraine-in-coffins/506979.html | title=Moscow Stifles Dissent as Soldiers Return From Ukraine in Coffins | work= [[The Moscow Times]] | date=12 September 2014 | agency=Reuters | accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All movies that feature "unwanted" Russian or Russia-supporting actors were also banned.&lt;ref&gt;The Star.[https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2015/08/09/ukraine-bans-films-featuring-blacklisted-russian-actors-including-gerard-depardieu.html Ukraine bans films featuring blacklisted Russian actors, including Gerard Depardieu].

====On the Internet====
Russian is by far the preferred language on websites in Ukraine (80.1%), followed by English (10.1%), then Ukrainian (9.5%). The Russian language version of [[Wikipedia]] is five times more popular within Ukraine than the Ukrainian one, with these numbers matching those for the 2008 Gallup poll cited above (in which 83% of Ukrainians preferred to take the survey in Russian and 17% in Ukrainian.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/13758/ukraine-s-ongoing-struggle-with-its-russian-identity|title=Ukraine's Ongoing Struggle With Its Russian Identity|website=www.worldpoliticsreview.com|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While government organizations are required to have their websites in Ukrainian, Ukrainian usage of the Internet is mostly in the Russian language.

===In education===
Among private secondary schools, each individual institution decides whether to study Russian or not.&lt;ref name="ostriv.in.ua"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ostriv.in.ua/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1519&amp;Itemid=1335&amp;ft=1|title=Співпраця України і Російської Федерації у сфері освіти і науки - Острів знань|website=ostriv.in.ua|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Russian-language schools teach the [[Ukrainian language]] as a required course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2008-11/2008-11-13-voa43.cfm Ukraine Seeks Nationwide Linguistic Revival], [[Voice of America]] (November 13, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarala Dasa'''  or '''Sarala Das''' was a 15th-century poet and scholar of [[Odia language|Odia]] literature. Best known for three Odia books — ''[[Mahabharata]]'', ''[[Vilanka Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Chandi Purana]]'' — he was the first scholar to write in Odia. As an originator of Odia literature, his work has formed an enduring source of information for succeeding generations.

==Life==
The life of Sarala Dasa is obscure. He was born at ''Kanakavati Patana'',  known as Kanakapura, one of the ''Sidhikshetras'' in [[Jagatsinghpur]] District. Though the date of his birth cannot be accurately determined, he can safely be placed to the 15th century AD.

Sarala Dasa had no systematic early education, and what he achieved through self-education was attributed to the grace of Sarala, goddess of devotion and inspiration. Though his early name was '''Siddheswar Parida''', he was later known as ''Sarala Dasa'', or 'by the boon of Sarala'. (The title ''Dasa'' means a slave or a servant of a particular god or goddess: a long list of poets, preceding and succeeding Sarala Dasa, have names ending this way: for example, Vatra Dasa, Markanda Dasa, Sarala Dasa, Jagannatha Dasa, Balarama Dasa, and Yasovanta Dasa.) A story - similar to those told of other Indian poets, such as [[Kali Dasa]], supposedly illiterate in early life until helped by the goddess [[Saraswati]] - tells that Siddheswar as a boy was once ploughing his father's field and singing so melodiously that the goddess Sarala stopped and listened to his song and endowed him with her power of composing beautiful poems.

There are several indications in his ''Mahabharata'' that he served as a soldier in the army of the Gajapati King of Odisha.

Sarala Dasa spent his last time at ''Bila Sarala'' but the native place ''Kanakavati Patana'' known as ''Kanakapura'' at ''Tentuliapada'' with a religious establishment known as ''Munigoswain'', which marks as the traditional spot, where he composed his works. This period of his lifetime was known as the medieval period.

==Works==
As well as the three books for which he is best known - ''[[Mahabharata]]'', ''[[Vilanka Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Chandi Purana]]'' - Sarala Dasa also wrote the book ''[[Laxmi Narayana Vachanika]]''. The ''Adi Parva Mahabharata'' opens with a long invocation addressed to the Lord [[Jagannatha]] of [[Puri]], from which it is known that Sarala Dasa started writing his ''Mahabharata'' in the reign of Kapileswar, otherwise known as [[Kapilendra]], the famous Gajapati king of Odisha (AD 1435–67). He tells us that Maharaja Kapilesvara with innumerable offerings and many a salute was serving this great deity and hereby destroying the sins of the Kali age.

Though Sarala Dasa followed the main outline of the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'' in writing the Odia ''Mahabharata'', he made numerous deviations and added to it copiously the stories of his own creation and various other matters known to him. In the final form Sarala Dasa's ''Mahabharata'' is a new creation analogous to ''Kalidasa's Raghuvamsa'' based on the Ramayana.&lt;ref&gt;This contribution is a nearly verbatim reproduction of "Sarala Dasa, the Originator of the Oriya Literature" by Debendra Nath Bhoi and Priyadarshini Bakshi in the [http://orissagov.nic.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/oct2004/englishPdf/saraladasa.pdf ''Orissa Review''] of October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahabharata brought to light about the eighteen ''parvas'' like:
* Adiparva
* Sabhaparva
* Vanaparva
* Virata Parva
* Udaya Parva
* Vishma Parva
* Drona Parva
* Kanna Parva
* Slaya Parva
* Surtika Parva
* Stri Parva
* Shanti Parva
* Anusasanika Parva
* Asramavasika Prava
* Mahaprasthanika Parva
* Asvamedha Parva
* Mausala Parva
* Swargarohana Parva

The ''Chandi Purana'' was based on the well-known story of [[Durga]] killing ''[[Mahishasura]]'' (the buffalo headed demon) given in Sanskrit literature but here also the Odia poet chose to deviate from the original at several points. His earliest work, ''Vilanka Ramayana'', was a story of the fight between [[Rama]] and [[Shahasrasira Ravana]] (thousand headed Ravana).

The verse of Sarala Dasa is simple, forceful and musical, without artificiality. Applying colloquial words for his poetical purpose, his writing was free from Sanskritisation. His work can be seen as adapting the popular oral conventions of earlier Odia folk songs which were used in folk dances such as the ''Ghoda-nacha'' (Horse Dance), ''Dandanacha'' and ''Sakhinacha'' (Puppet Dance). One metrical peculiarity of these songs is that both the lines of a verse do not contain an equal number of letters though the last letters of both the lines produce the same sound. All Sarala Dasa's wors were composed with this metrical peculiarity, and so the metre used by him can be regarded as a direct descendant of that used in the folk songs. By the fifteenth century the Odia language had assumed almost its modern form and had become ripe for literary compositions.

The predominant sentiment in Sarala Dasa's poem is not love but war. He was also motivated by a strong religious zeal to compose religious books in a language intelligible to all and to make them available to the general public in Odisha. He tells in no uncertain words that he composed his poems for the benefit of "human beings". There are several indications in his Mahabharata that he served as a soldier in the army of the Gajapati King of Odisha and his association with the army brought to him a variety of experiences. The stories he heard the battle scenes which he witnessed, the places that he visited with the company of the army the historical incidents and names that he could know all remained stored up in his mind to be utilized in his writings.

'''Shrinking cities''' or '''urban depopulation''' are dense cities that have experienced notable population loss. Emigration (migration from a place) is a common reason for city shrinkage. Since the infrastructure of such cities was built to support a larger population, its maintenance can become a serious concern. A related phenomenon is [[counter urbanization]].

==Definition==
{{further|Urban flight|Urban decay}}

===Origins===
The phenomenon of shrinking cities generally refers to a metropolitan area that experiences significant population loss in a short period of time.&lt;ref name="Pallagst"/&gt; The theory is also known as counterurbanization, metropolitan deconcentration, and metropolitan turnaround.&lt;ref name=Frey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frey|first=William|title=Migration and Depopulation of the Metropolis: Regional Restructuring or Rural Renaissance|journal=American Sociological Review|year=1987|volume=52|issue=2|pages=240–287|doi=10.2307/2095452}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularized in reference to [[Eastern Europe]] post-[[socialism]], when old industrial regions came under Western [[privatization]] and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name=Pallagst&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pallagst|first=K.|title=Shrinking cities in the United States of America: Three cases, three planning stories|journal=The Future of Shrinking Cities|year=2009|volume=1|pages=81–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bontje&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=M.|title=Facing the challenge of shrinking cities in East Germany: The case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2005|volume=61|issue=1|pages=13–21|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shrinking cities in the United States]], on the other hand, has been forming since 2006 in dense urban centers while external suburban areas continue to grow.&lt;ref name="Hollander et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollander|first=J.|author2=J. Németh |title=The bounds of smart decline: a foundational theory for planning shrinking cities|journal=Housing and Policy Debate|year=2011|volume=21|issue=3|pages=349–367|doi=10.1080/10511482.2011.585164}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suburbanization]] in tandem with [[deindustrialization]], [[human migration]], and the 2008 [[Great Recession]] all contribute to origins of shrinking cities in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Pallagst/&gt; Scholars estimate that one in six to one in four cities worldwide are shrinking in countries with expanding economies and those with deindustrialization.&lt;ref name=Pallagst/&gt; However, there are some issues with the concept of shrinking cities, as it seeks to group together areas that undergo depopulation for a variety of complex reasons. These may include an aging population, shifting industries, intentional shrinkage to improve quality of life, or a transitional phase, all of which require different responses and plans.&lt;ref name=Maheshwari&gt;{{cite web|last=Maheshwari|first=Tanvi|title=Redefining Shrinking Cities. The Urban Fringe, Berkeley Planning Journal|url=http://ced.berkeley.edu/bpj/2013/12/redefining-shrinking-cities/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes===
There are various theoretical explanations for the shrinking city phenomenon. Hollander et al.&lt;ref name="Hollander"/&gt; and Glazer&lt;ref name=Glazer/&gt; cite railroads in port cities, the depreciation of national infrastructure (i.e., highways), and suburbanization as possible causes of de-urbanization. Pallagst&lt;ref name="Pallagst"/&gt; also suggests that shrinkage is a response to deindustrialization, as jobs move from the city core to cheaper land on the periphery. This case has been observed in [[Detroit]], where employment opportunities in the automobile industry were moved to the suburbs because of room for expansion and cheaper acreage.&lt;ref name="Martelle"/&gt; Bontje&lt;ref name="Bontje"/&gt; proposes three factors contributing to urban shrinkage, followed by one suggested by Hollander:

#'''Urban development model''': Based on the Fordist model of [[industrialization]], it suggests that [[urbanization]] is a cyclical process and that urban and regional decline will eventually allow for increased growth&lt;ref name=Bontje/&gt;
#'''One company town/monostructure model''': Cities that focus too much on one branch of economic growth make themselves vulnerable to rapid declines, such as the case with the automobile industry in Flint.&lt;ref name=Bontje/&gt;
#'''Shock therapy model''': Especially in Eastern Europe post-socialism, state-owned companies did not survive privatization, leading to plant closures and massive unemployment.&lt;ref name=Bontje/&gt;
#'''Smart decline''': City planners have utilized this term and inadvertently encouraged decline by "planning for less&amp;mdash;fewer people, fewer buildings, fewer land uses.".&lt;ref name=Hollander/&gt; It is a development method focused on improving the quality of life for current residents without taking those residents' needs into account, thus pushing more people out of the city core.&lt;ref name=Hollander /&gt;

===Effects===

====Economic====
The shrinking of urban populations indicates a changing of economic and planning conditions of a city. Cities begin to 'shrink' from economic decline, usually resulting from war, debt, or lack of production and work force.&lt;ref name="Schteke 485"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schteke|first=Sophie|author2=Dagmar Haase |title=Multi-Criteria Assessment of Socio-Environmental Aspects in Shrinking Cities. Experiences from Eastern Germany|journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review|date=September 2007|volume=28|page=485}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Population decline]] affects a large number of communities, both communities that are far removed from and deep within large urban centers.&lt;ref name="Schteke 485"/&gt; These communities usually consist of native people and long-term residents, so the initial population is not large. The outflow of people is then detrimental to the production potential and quality of life in these regions, and a decline in employment and productivity ensues.&lt;ref name="Schteke 485"/&gt;

====Social and infrastructural====
Shrinking cities experience dramatic social changes due to fertility decline, changes in life expectancy, population aging, and household structure. Another reason for this shift is job-driven migration.&lt;ref name="Schteke 485"/&gt; This causes different household demands, posing a challenge to the urban housing market and the development of new land or urban planning. A decline in population does not inspire confidence in a city, and often deteriorates municipal morale. Coupled with a weak economy, the city and its infrastructure begin to deteriorate from lack of upkeep from citizens.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

====Political====
Historically, shrinking cities have been a taboo topic in politics. Representatives ignored the problem and refused to deal with it, leading many to believe it was not a real problem. Today, urban shrinkage is an acknowledged issue, with many urban planning firms working together to strategize how to combat the implications that affect all dimensions of daily life.&lt;ref name="Schteke 485"/&gt;

===International perspectives===
[[File:Partizánska Ľupča 3TN1.jpg|thumb|[[Partizánska Ľupča]] in [[Slovakia]]. Now a [[village]] with 1300 [[inhabitant]]s but in 14th-19th centuries an important [[mining town]] with more than 4000. Several houses still have an [[Urban area|urban]] character.]]
Former Socialist regions in Europe and Central Asia have historically suffered the most from population decline and [[deindustrialization]]. East German cities, as well as former Yugoslavian and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] territories, were significantly affected by the weak economic situation they were left in after the fall of [[socialism]]. The reunification of European countries yielded both benefits and drawbacks. German cities like [[Leipzig]] and [[Dresden]], for example, experienced a drastic population decline as many people emigrated to western cities like [[Berlin]]. [[Hamburg]] in particular experienced a population boom with record production yields in 1991, after the unification of Germany. Conversely, Leipzig and Dresden suffered from a failing economy and a neglected infrastructure. These cities were built to support a much larger population. However, both Dresden and Leipzig are now growing again, largely at the expense of smaller cities and rural areas. [[Shrinking cities in the United States]] face different issues, with much of the population migrating out of cities to other states for better economic opportunities and safer conditions. Advanced capitalist countries generally have a larger population, so this shift is not as dangerous as it is to post-socialist countries. The United States also has more firms willing to rehabilitate shrinking cities and invest in revitalization efforts. For example, after the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]] in San Francisco in 1989, the dynamics between the city and its residents provoked change and plans achieved visible improvements in the city. By contrast, cities in Germany have not gotten the same attention. Urban planning projects take a long time to be approved and established. As of now, Leipzig is taking steps toward making the city more nature-oriented and 'green' so that the population can be first stabilized, and then the country can focus on drawing the population back into the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harms|first=Hans|title=Changes on the Waterfront-Transforming Harbor Areas|url=http://metrostudies.berkeley.edu/pubs/proceedings/Shrinking/7Harms_PA_final%5B2%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories  ==

The observable demographic out-migration and [[disinvestment]] of capital from many industrial cities across the globe following [[World War II]] prompted an academic investigation into the causes of shrinking cities or, urban decline. Serious issues of [[justice]], [[racism]], economic and [[health disparity]], as well as inequitable power relations,  are consequences of the shrinking cities phenomenon. The question is, what causes urban decline and why? While theories do vary, three main categories of influence are widely attributed to urban decline: deindustrialization, [[globalization]], and [[suburbanization]].

=== Deindustrialization ===

[[File:Sectors of US Economy as Percent of GDP 1947-2009.png|thumb|350px|Sectors of the US Economy as percent of GDP 1947-2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Makes It?|url=http://www.63alfred.com/whomakesit/|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

One theory of shrinking cities is [[deindustrialization]] or, the process of disinvestment from industrial urban centers.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;Clark, David. Urban Decline (Routledge Revivals). Hoboken: Taylor and Francis, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  This theory of shrinking cities is mainly focused on post-World War II Europe. Following World War II, global economic power shifted from [[Western Europe]] to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Couch&gt;Couch, Chris, Jay Karecha, Henning Nuissl, and Dieter Rink. "Decline and sprawl: an evolving type of urban development – observed in Liverpool and Leipzig." European Planning Studies 13.1 (2007): 117-136.&lt;/ref&gt; At this moment, manufacturing declined in Western Europe as it increased within the United States.&lt;ref name=Couch /&gt;  The result was a shift away from Western European [[industrialization]] and a movement towards alternative industries.&lt;ref name=Couch /&gt; This economic shift is clearly seen through the [[United Kingdom]]'s rise of a service sector economy.&lt;ref name=Lang /&gt; With a shift in industry, however, many jobs were lost or [[outsource]]d.&lt;ref name=Lang /&gt; The result was urban decline and the massive demographic movement from former industrial urban centers into suburban and rural locals.&lt;ref name=Lang /&gt;

==== Post-World War II politics ====

Rapid [[privatization]] incentives encouraged under the United States sponsored post-World War II [[economic aid]] policies such as the [[Marshall Plan]] and [[Lend-Lease]] program, motivated [[free-market]], [[capitalist]] approaches to governance across the Western European economic landscape.&lt;ref name=Clark /&gt;  The result of these privatization schemes was a movement of capital into American manufacturing and financial markets and out of Western European industrial centers.&lt;ref name=Lang&gt;Lang, Thilo. "Insights in the British Debate about Urban Decline and Urban Regeneration." Leibniz-Institute for Regional Development and Structural Planning (2005): 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  American loans were also used as political currency contingent upon global investment schemes meant to stifle [[economic development]] within the Soviet-allied [[Eastern Bloc]].&lt;ref name=Friedrichs&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Friedrichs | first1 = Jurgen | year = 1993 | title = A Theory of Urban Decline: Economy, Demography and Political Elites | url = | journal = Urban Studies | volume = 30 | issue = 6| pages = 907–917 | doi=10.1080/00420989320080851}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With extensive debt tying capitalist Europe to the United States and financial blockades inhibiting full [[Development economics|development]] of the communist Eastern half, this [[Cold War]] economic power structure greatly contributed to European urban decline.

==== The case of Great Britain ====

[[File:Marshall's flax-mill, Holbeck, Leeds - interior - c.1800.jpg|thumb|19th century [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] became the first global economic superpower, because of superior manufacturing technology and improved global communications such as steamships and railways.]]

[[Great Britain]], widely considered the first nation to fully industrialize, is often used as a case study in support of the theory of [[deindustrialization]] and urban decline.&lt;ref name=Lang /&gt;  Political economists often point to the [[Cold War]] era as the moment when a monumental shift in global economic power structures occurred.&lt;ref name=Lang /&gt;  The former "Great Empire" of the [[United Kingdom]] was built from industry, trade and financial dominion. This control was, however, effectively lost to the United States under such programs as the [[Lend-Lease]] and [[Marshall Plan]].&lt;ref name=Lang /&gt; As the global financial market moved from [[London]] to [[New York City]], so too did the influence of capital and investment.

With the initial decades following World War II dedicated to rebuilding or, readjusting the economic, political and cultural role of Britain within the new [[New world order (politics)|world order]], it wasn't until the 1960s and 1970s that major concerns over urban decline emerged.&lt;ref name=Lang /&gt;  With industry moving out of Western Europe and into the United States, rapid depopulation of cities and movement into rural areas occurred in Great Britain.&lt;ref name=Lang /&gt; Deindustrialization was advanced further under the [[Thatcherism|Thatcherite]] privatization policies of the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Lang /&gt; Privatization of industry took away all remaining state protection of manufacturing. With industry now under [[private ownership]], "free-market" incentives (along with a strong [[pound sterling|pound]] resulting from [[North Sea Oil]]) pushed further movement of manufacturing out of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=Lang /&gt;

Under Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], the United Kingdom effectively tried to revamp depopulated and unemployed cities through the enlargement of service sector industry.&lt;ref name=Lang /&gt; This shift from manufacturing to services did not, however, reverse the trend of urban decline observed beginning in 1966, with the exception of London.&lt;ref name=Lang /&gt;

==== The case of Leipzig ====

[[File:Fotothek df roe-neg 0002629 002 Trümmerbeseitigung.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Leipzig after bombing in World War II]]

[[Leipzig]] serves as an example of urban decline on the Eastern half of post-World War II Europe. Leipzig, an [[East German]] city under Soviet domain during the Cold War era, suffered to receive adequate government investment as well as market outlets for industrial goods.&lt;ref name=Couch /&gt;  With the stagnation of demand for production, Leipzig began to deindustrialize as the investment in manufacturing stifled.&lt;ref name=Rall&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rall | first1 = Emily Lorance | last2 = Haase | first2 = Dagmar | year = 2011 | title = Creative intervention in a dynamic city: A sustainability assessment of an interim use strategy for brownfields in Leipzig, Germany | url = | journal = Landscape and Urban Planning | volume = 100 | issue = 3| pages = 189–201 | doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2010.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[deindustrialization]], demographers theorize, prompted populations to [[Human migration|migrate]] from the city center and into the country and growing suburbs in order to find work elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Couch /&gt; Since the 2000s, Leipzig reindustrializes and turned back into a growing urban realm.

==== The case of Detroit ====

Although most major research on deindustrialization focuses on post-World War II Europe, many theorists also turn to the case of [[Detroit]], Michigan as further evidence of the correlation between deindustrialization and shrinking cities.&lt;ref name=Sugrue/&gt;  Detroit, nicknamed [[Motor City]] because of its expansive [[automobile manufacturing]] sector, reached its population peak during the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Rappaport&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rappaport | first1 = Jordan | year = | title = U.S. Urban Decline and Growth, 1950 to 2000 | url = | journal = Economic Review | volume = 2003 | issue = | pages = 15–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As European and [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] industry recovered from the destruction of World War II, the American automobile industry no longer had a monopoly advantage. With new global [[market competition]], Detroit began to lose its unrivaled position as "Motor City".&lt;ref name=Rappaport /&gt;  With this falling demand, investment shifted to other locations outside of Detroit. Deindustrialization followed as production rates began to drop.

=== Globalization ===

As evident from the theory of deindustrialization, political economists and demographers both place huge importance on the global flows of capital and investment in relation to population stability.&lt;ref name=Vernon&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vernon | first1 = Raymond | year = 1979 | title = The Product Cycle Hypothesis In A New International Environment | url = | journal = Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics | volume = 41 | issue = 4| pages = 255–267 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many theorists point to the [[Bretton Woods Conference]] as setting the stage for a new globalized age of trade and investment.&lt;ref name=Vernon /&gt;  With the creation of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and [[World Bank]] in addition to the United States' [[economic aid]] programs (i.e., Marshall Plan and Lend-Lease), many academics highlight [[Bretton Woods Conference|Bretton Woods]] as a turning point in world economic relations. Under a new academic stratification of developed and developing nations, trends in capital investment flows and urban population densities were theorized following post-World War II global financial reorganization.&lt;ref name=Martinez-Fernandez&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martinez-Fernandez | first1 = Cristina | last2 = Audirac | first2 = Ivonne | last3 = Fol | first3 = Sylvie | last4 = Cunningham-Sabot | first4 = Emmanuèle | year = 2012 | title = Shrinking Cities: Urban Challenges of Globalization | url = | journal = International Journal of Urban and Regional Research | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 213–225 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2011.01092.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Product life-cycle theory ====

The [[product life-cycle theory]] was originally developed by Raymond Vernon to help improve the theoretical understanding of modern patterns of [[international trade]].&lt;ref name=Vernon /&gt;  In a widely cited study by Jurgen Friedrichs, "A Theory of Urban Decline: Economy, Demography and Political Elites," Friedrichs aims to clarify and build upon the existing theory of product life-cycle in relation to urban decline.&lt;ref name=Friedrichs /&gt; Accepting the premise of shrinking cities as result of economic decline and urban [[out-migration]], Friedrichs discusses how and why this initial economic decline occurs.&lt;ref name=Friedrichs /&gt;  Through a dissection of the theory of product life-cycle and its suggestion of urban decline from disinvestment of outdated industry, Friedrichs attributes the root cause of shrinking cities as the lack of industrial [[Diversification (finance)|diversification]] within specific urban areas.&lt;ref name=Friedrichs /&gt;  This lack of diversification, Friedrichs suggests, magnifies the political and economic power of the few major companies and weakens the workers' ability to insulate against disinvestment and subsequent deindustrialization of cities.&lt;ref name=Friedrichs /&gt; Friedrichs suggests that lack of urban economic [[Diversity (business)|diversity]] prevents a thriving industrial center and disempowers workers.&lt;ref name=Friedrichs /&gt;  This, in turn, allows a few economic elites in old-industrial cities such as [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and Detroit in the United States, to reinvest in cheaper and less-regulated [[third world]] manufacturing sites.&lt;ref name=Rieniets&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rieniets | first1 = Tim | year = 2009 | title = Shrinking Cities: Causes and Effects of Urban Population Losses in the Twentieth Century | url = | journal = Nature &amp; Culture | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 231–254 | doi=10.3167/nc.2009.040302}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The result of this economic decline in old-industrial cities is the subsequent out-migration of unemployed populations.

==== Neoliberal critique ====

[[File:Shanghai - Nanjing Road.jpeg|thumb|[[Nanjing Road (Shanghai)|Nanjing Road]], a major shopping street in Shanghai]]

Recent studies have further built upon the product life-cycle theory of shrinking cities. Many of these studies, however, focus specifically on the effects of [[globalization]] on urban decline through a critique of [[neoliberalism]]. This contextualization is used to highlight globalization and the [[internationalization]] of production processes as a major driver causing both shrinking cities and destructive [[Development economics|development]] policies.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Taylor, M. "The product-cycle model: a critique." Environment and Planning 18.6 (1986): 751-761.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these articles draw upon case studies looking at the economic relationship between the United States and [[China]] to clarify and support the main argument presented. The neoliberal critique of globalization argues that a major driver of shrinking cities in developed countries is through the outflow of capital into developing countries.&lt;ref name=Martinez-Fernandez /&gt; This outflow, according to theorists, is caused by an inability for cities in richer nations to find a productive [[Niche market|niche]] in the increasingly international economic system.&lt;ref name=Martinez-Fernandez /&gt;  In terms of disinvestment and manufacturer movement, the rise of China's manufacturing industry from United States [[outsourcing]] of cheap labor is often cited as the most applicable current example of the product life-cycle theory.&lt;ref name=Martinez-Fernandez /&gt;

=== Suburbanization ===

The migration of wealthier individuals and families from industrial city centers into surrounding suburban areas is an observable trend seen primarily within the United States during the mid to late 20th century.&lt;ref name=Voith&gt;Voith, Richard. "City and suburban growth: substitutes or complements?" Business Review (1992): 21-33.&lt;/ref&gt;  Specific theories for this flight vary across disciplines. The two prevalent cultural phenomenons of white flight and [[car culture]] are, however, consensus trends across academic disciplines.&lt;ref name=Mitchell&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = Clare J.A. | year = 2004 | title = Making sense of counterurbanization | url = | journal = Journal of Rural Studies | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 15–34 | doi=10.1016/s0743-0167(03)00031-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== White flight ====

[[White flight]] generally refers to the movement of large percentages of [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] Americans out of racially mixed United States city centers and into largely homogenous suburban areas during the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Rappaport /&gt;  The result of this migration, according to theorists studying shrinking cities, was the loss of money and infrastructure from urban centers.&lt;ref name=Rappaport /&gt;  As the wealthier and more politically powerful populations fled from cities, so too did funding and government interest. The result, according to many academics, was the fundamental decline of urban health across United States cities beginning in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Rappaport /&gt;

[[Image:Home Owners' Loan Corporation Philadelphia redlining map.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]] 1936 security map of [[Philadelphia]] showing redlining of lower income neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;The HOLC maps are part of the records of the FHLBB (RG195) at the [https://www.archives.gov/index.html National Archives II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011145816/http://www.archives.gov/index.html |date=2016-10-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Households and businesses in the red zones could not get mortgages or business loans.]]

The product of white flight was a stratification of wealth with the poorest (and mostly minority) groups in the center of cities and the richest (and mostly white) outside the city in suburban locations.&lt;ref name=Sugrue /&gt; As suburbanization began to increase through to the late 20th century, urban health and infrastructure precipitously dropped. In other words, United States urban areas began to decline.&lt;ref name=Sugrue /&gt;

Mid-20th-century political policies greatly contributed to urban disinvestment and decline. Both the product and intent of these policies were highly racial oriented.&lt;ref name=Sugrue /&gt;  Although discrimination and [[racial segregation]] already existed prior to the passage of the [[National Housing Act of 1934|National Housing Act]] in 1934, the structural process of discrimination was federally established with the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA).&lt;ref name=Rappaport /&gt;  The result of the establishment of the FHA was [[redlining]]. Redlining refers to the demarcation of certain districts of poor, minority urban populations where government and private investment were discouraged.&lt;ref name=Sugrue /&gt;  The decline of minority [[inner city]] neighborhoods was worsened under the FHA and its policies.&lt;ref name=Sugrue /&gt;  Redlined districts could not improve or maintain a thriving population under conditions of withheld mortgage capital.&lt;ref name=Sugrue /&gt;

==== Car culture and urban sprawl ====

In combination with the racial drivers of white flight, the development of a uniquely American [[car culture]] also led to further development of suburbanization and later, [[urban sprawl]].&lt;ref name=Fulton&gt;Fulton, William B. Who sprawls most? How growth patterns differ across the U.S.. Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  As car culture made driving "cool" and a key cultural aspect of "American-ness," suburban locations proliferated in the imaginations of Americans as the ideal landscape to live during the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Fulton /&gt; Urban decline, under these conditions, only worsened.&lt;ref name=Fulton /&gt;

[[File:Scottsdale cityscape4.jpg|thumb|right|View of suburban development in the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]] ]]

The more recent phenomenon of urban sprawl across American cities such as [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Los Angeles]], were only made possible under the conditions of a car culture.&lt;ref name=Fulton /&gt;   The impact of this car culture and resulting urban sprawl is, according to academics, threefold. First, although urban sprawl in both shrinking and growing cities have many similar characteristics, sprawl in relation to declining cities may be more rapid with an increasing desire to move out of the poor, inner-city locations.&lt;ref name=Couch /&gt;  Second, there are many similarities in the characteristics and features of suburban areas around growing and declining cities.&lt;ref name=Couch /&gt;  Third, urban sprawl in declining cities can be contained by improving land use within inner city areas such as implementing micro-parks and implementing [[urban renewal]] projects.&lt;ref name=Couch /&gt; There are many similarities between urban sprawl in relation to both declining and growing cities. This, therefore, provides similar intervention strategies for controlling sprawl from a [[city planning]] point of view.

==Interventions==
Different interventions are adopted by different city governments to deal with the problem of city shrinkage based on their context and development. Governments of shrinking cities such as [[Detroit]] and [[Youngstown]] have used new approaches of adapting to populations well below their peak, rather than seeking economic incentives to boost populations to previous levels before shrinkage and embracing growth models.

===Green retirement city===
Research from Europe proposes "retirement migration" as one strategy to deal with city shrinkage. The idea is that abandoned properties or vacant lots can be converted into green spaces for retiring seniors migrating from other places. As older individuals migrate into cities they can bring their knowledge and savings to the city for revitalization.&lt;ref name="retirement"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nefs | first1 = M | last2 = Alves | first2 = S | last3 = Zasada | first3 = I | last4 = Haase | first4 = D | year = 2013 | title = Shrinking cities as retirement cities? Opportunities for shrinking cities as green living environments for older individuals | url = | journal = Environment and Planning A | volume = 45 | issue = 6| pages = 1455–1473 | doi=10.1068/a45302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retiring seniors are often ignored by the communities if they are not actively participating in community activities. The green retirement city approach could also have benefits on social inclusion of seniors, such as urban gardening.&lt;ref name="retirement" /&gt; The approach could also act as a "catalyst in urban renewal for shrinking cities".&lt;ref name="retirement" /&gt; Accommodations, in the meanwhile, have to be provided including accessibility to community facilities and health care.

Establishing a green retirement city would be a good approach to avoid tragedies like the [[1995 Chicago heat wave]]. During the heat wave, hundreds of deaths occurred in the city, particularly in the inner neighborhood of the city. Victims were predominantly poor, elderly, African American populations living in the heart of the city.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roper | first1 = R. E. | year = 2003 | title = "Book Review of "Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago | url = | journal = Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management | volume = 1 | issue = 1| page = 7 | doi=10.2202/1547-7355.1008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later research pointed out that these victims were socially isolated and had a lack of contact with friends and families.&lt;ref name="review" /&gt; People who were already very ill in these isolated, inner neighborhoods were also affected and might have died sooner than otherwise.&lt;ref name="review" /&gt;  The high crime rate in the inner decaying city also accounted for the high rate of deaths as they were afraid to open their windows. Therefore, a green retirement city with sufficient community facilities and support would accommodate needs for elderly population isolated in the poor, inner city communities.

===Right-sizing===
The idea of "right-sizing" is defined as "stabilizing dysfunctional markets and distressed neighborhoods by more closely aligning a city's built environment with the needs of existing and foreseeable future populations by adjusting the amount of land available for development." &lt;ref name="RightSize"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schilling | first1 = Joseph | last2 = Logan | first2 = Jonathan | year = 2008 | title = Greening the rust belt: A green infrastructure model for right sizing America's shrinking cities | url = | journal = Journal of the American Planning Association | volume = 74 | issue = 4| pages = 451–466 | doi=10.1080/01944360802354956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than revitalize the entire city, residents are relocated into concentrated or denser neighborhoods. Such reorganization encourages residents and businesses in more sparsely populated areas to move into more densely populated areas.&lt;ref name="io"&gt;Davis, Lauren. "Detroit plans to shrink by leaving half the city in the dark" We Come from Future. May 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Public amenities are emphasized for improvement in these denser neighborhoods. Abandoned buildings in these less populated areas are demolished and vacant lots are reserved for future green infrastructure.&lt;ref name="RightSize" /&gt;

The city of Detroit has adopted right-sizing approaches in its "Detroit Work Project" plan. Many neighborhoods are only 10–15% occupied.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;McGreal, Chris. "Detroit mayor plans to shrink city by cutting services to some areas" ''The Guardian'' December 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the plan encourages people to concentrate in nine of the densest neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; Under the plan, the city performs several tasks including: prioritizing [[public safety]], providing reliable transportation and demolition plans for vacant structures.&lt;ref name="DetroitWork"&gt;"Transforming Detroit Handbook" City of Detroit. Web. 5 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the "right-sizing" approach may seem attractive to deal with vast vacant lots and abandoned houses with isolated residents, it can be problematic for people who are incapable of moving into these denser neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="io" /&gt; In the case of Detroit, although residents in decaying neighborhoods are not forced to move into concentrated areas, if they live outside designated neighborhoods they may not get public services they require.&lt;ref name="io" /&gt; This is because communities in shrinking cities often are low-income communities where they are racially segregated.&lt;ref name="reading"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morello-Frosch | first1 = Rachel | last2 = Zuk | first2 = Miriam | last3 = Jerrett | first3 = Michael | last4 = Shamasunder | first4 = Bhavna | last5 = Kyle | first5 = Amy D. | year = 2011 | title = Understanding the Cumulative Impacts of Inequality in Environmental Health: Implications for Policy | url = | journal = Health Affairs | volume = 30 | issue = 5| pages = 879–887 | doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and exclusion may "contribute to psychosocial stress level" as well and further add burden to the quality of living environments in these communities.&lt;ref name="reading" /&gt;

===Smart shrinkage===
The idea of "smart shrinkage", in some regards, is similar to dominant growth-based models that offer incentives encouraging investment to spur economic and population growth, and reverse shrinkage. However, rather than believing the city can return to previous population levels, the governments embrace shrinkage and accept having a significantly smaller population.&lt;ref name="SmartShrink"&gt;Rhodes, James and Russo, John. Shrinking 'Smart'?: Urban Redevelopment and Shrinkage in Youngstown, Ohio, Urban Geography, 34:3, 305-326&lt;/ref&gt; With this model, governments emphasize diversifying their economy and prioritizing funds over relocating people and neighborhoods.

[[File:Youngstown Sheet&amp;Tube Abandoned.jpg|thumb|left|Abandoned [[Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company]] facility in [[Youngstown]]]]
[[Youngstown 2010]] is an example of such an approach for the city of [[Youngstown]], Ohio. The plan seeks to diversify the city's economy, "which used to be almost entirely based on manufacturing".&lt;ref name="ceos"&gt;Lawson, Ethan. "Youngstown: A Shrinking City with Big Ideas" CEOs for Cities. July 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tax incentive]] programs like Youngstown Initiative have also "assisted in bringing in and retaining investment throughout the city."&lt;ref name="SmartNews"&gt;Parris, Terry. "Youngstown 2010: What shrinkage looks like, what Detroit could learn." Model D. Model D, May 4, 2010. Web. 6 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; These practices help attract and preserve investment throughout the city. Since the plan was introduced, many major investments have been made in the city. The downtown Youngstown has been also transformed from a high crime rate area into a vibrant destination.&lt;ref name="ceos" /&gt;

Nevertheless, there are concerns that the smart shrinkage approach may worsen existing isolation of residents who cannot relocate to more vibrant neighborhoods. [[Environmental justice]] issues may surface from this approach if city governments ignore the types of industries planning investment and neighborhoods that are segregated.

===Land bank===
[[Land banking|Land banks]] are often quasi-governmental counties or municipal authorities that manage the inventory of surplus vacant lands. They "allow local jurisdictions to sell, demolish and rehabilitate large numbers of abandoned and tax-delinquent properties."&lt;ref name="FlintReport"&gt;Fredenburg, Julia. Land Banks to Revive Shrinking Cities: Genesee County, Michigan, Housing Policy &amp; Equitable Development, PUAF U8237, May 10, 2011. Web. 4 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, the state works directly with local governments to allow abandoned properties to have easier and faster resale and to discourage speculative buying.&lt;ref name="FlintReport" /&gt;

One of the most famous examples of land banks is the [[Genesee County, Michigan|Genesee County]] Land Bank in the city of [[Flint, Michigan]]. As an industrial city with General Motors as the largest producer, declining car sales with the availability of cheap labor in other cities led to reduction in the labor force of the city. The main reason of the property or land abandonment problem in Flint was the state's tax foreclosure system.&lt;ref name="gk"&gt;Gillotti, Teresa and Kildee, Daniel. "Land Banks as Revitalization Tools: The Example of Genesee County and the City of Flint, Michigan."&lt;/ref&gt; Abandoned properties were either transferred to private speculators or became state-owned property through foreclosure, which encouraged low-end reuse of tax-reverted land due to the length of time between abandonment and reuse.&lt;ref name="gk" /&gt;

The Land Bank provides a series of programs to revitalize shrinking cities. In the case of Flint, Brownfield Redevelopment for previous polluted lands is controlled by the land bank to allow financing of demolition, redevelopment projects and clean up through [[tax increment financing]].&lt;ref name="gk" /&gt; A "Greening" strategy is also promoted by using abandonment as an opportunity for isolated communities to engage in maintenance and improvement of vacant lots.&lt;ref name="gk" /&gt; In the city, there is significant reduction in abandoned properties. Vacant lots are maintained by the banks or sold to adjacent land owners as well.&lt;ref name="FlintReport" /&gt;

Establishment of land banks could increase land values and tax revenues for further innovation of the shrinking cities. Nevertheless, The process of acquiring foreclosures can be troublesome as "it may require involvement on the part of several jurisdictions to obtain clear title," which is necessary for redevelopment.&lt;ref name="doc"&gt;"Revitalizing Foreclosed Properties with Land Banks" Sage Computing, Inc. August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Economic problems that local residents have, including income disparities between local residents, cannot be solved by the land bank, with the addition of increasing rents and land values led by the revitalization of vacant land. Local leaders also lack the authority to interrupt works that Land Banks do.&lt;ref name="gk" /&gt; Environmental justice problems that are from previous polluting industry may not be fully addressed through shrinking city intervention and without opinions from local people. Therefore, a new approach of dealing with these vacant lots will be to work with non-profit local community groups to construct more green open spaces among the declining neighborhoods to reduce vacant lots and create strong community commitments.&lt;ref name="FlintReport" /&gt;

===Other approaches===
There are several other miscellaneous interventions that some cities have used to deal with city shrinkage. One of the interventions would be the series of policies adopted in the city of [[Leipzig]] in East Germany. They include construction of town houses in urban areas and guardian houses with temporary rental-free leases.&lt;ref name="PostSocial"&gt;Wiechmann, Thorsten and Volkmann, Anne and Schmitz, Sandra. "Making Place in Increasingly Empty Spaces-Dealing with Shrinkage in Post-Socialist Cities-The Example of East Germany" Shrinking Cities-International Perspectives and Policy Implications, Routledge, New York, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Temporary use of private property as public spaces is also encouraged.&lt;ref name="PostSocial" /&gt; Another intervention would be the revitalization of vacant lots or abandoned properties for artistic development and artists interactions such as [[the Village of Arts and Humanities]] in [[North Philadelphia]], where vacant lots and empty buildings are renovated with mosaics, gardens and murals.

===History of Detroit's changing demographics===
{{main article|Demographic history of Detroit}}
[[File:AbandonedHouseDelray.jpg|thumb|Abandoned houses in [[Detroit]] - a representation of urban shrinkage.]]

Economic changes, the [[Automotive industry in the United States]], societal shifts, and political restructuring each affected demographic change and shrinkage in Detroit.&lt;ref name="Binelli"&gt;Detroit City is the Place to Be, Henry Holt and Company, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The city's demographic history plays a key role in the present situation of depopulation in Detroit, and how it has become an issue of [[economic inequality]] and environmental justice.&lt;ref name="Briller and Sankar"&gt;Engaging Opportunities in Urban Revitalization: Practicing Detroit Anthropology, American Anthropological Association, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These political, economic, and societal shifts are outlined below.

====From village to city====
Though it began as a small village in 1701, Detroit was not an incorporated city until 1815.&lt;ref name=Glazer&gt;{{cite book|last=Glazer|first=Sidney|title=Detroit: A Study in Urban Development|year=1965|publisher=Bookman Associates, Inc.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Detroit History"&gt;{{cite web|last=Duggan|first=Mike|title=Detroit History|url=https://www.detroitmi.gov/Residents/AboutDetroit/DetroitHistory.aspx|publisher=City of Detroit|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508062413/https://www.detroitmi.gov/Residents/AboutDetroit/DetroitHistory.aspx|archivedate=2014-05-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1820 the city had around 1,400 inhabitants, which increased to 2,200 by 1830.&lt;ref name="Glazer" /&gt; By 1850 the city's population of predominantly immigrants had reached 21,000, and by 1860 had surpassed 45,600 total inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Glazer" /&gt; This is in part because Detroit was the final stop on the [[Underground Railroad]], which diversified the city and brought many former African American slaves north, up until the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Detroit History"/&gt; Even though much of Detroit's African American community was free, racial tensions ran deep among white landowners, and free African Americans often had to deal with slave hunters.&lt;ref name=Martelle&gt;{{cite book|last=Martelle|first=Scott|title=Detroit: A Biography|year=2012|publisher=Chicago Review Press|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th Century, roughly half of Detroit's population was foreign-born.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; Demographically, the city was home to numerous Austrians, Belgians, Canadians, Germans, English, Scottish, Polish, and Irish groups.&lt;ref name="Glazer" /&gt; Detroit's residents also lived in clearly defined ethnic and economic neighborhoods from the beginning, segregating English and non-English speakers from Jewish and Catholic, for example.&lt;ref name="Glazer" /&gt; In 1825, the Erie Canal and a network of highways, including the Chicago Road, also brought in additional settlers while the city developed.&lt;ref name="Glazer" /&gt; Throughout this time, Detroit was slowly becoming a commercial center in the Midwest.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; The market for manufactured goods slowly grew, as the construction of railroads connected industrial leaders to other prosperous counties in the state, allowing the population to grow further.&lt;ref name="Glazer" /&gt; By 1854, the railroad connected Detroit to New York City, permanently opening the city's commercial capacity.&lt;ref name="Glazer" /&gt; To support these opportunities, the city also modernized quickly, laying 242 miles of water pipe by 1883 to service the growing population, and contributing to suburbanization.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt;

====The Motor City====
Industries native to Detroit, such as manufacturing cigars and kitchen ranges, were quickly overshadowed by the success of Detroit's automobile industry, which allowed the city to explode via population growth. Other cars had been built already in other cities, but Ford's concept of the moving [[assembly line]] "put the world on wheels".&lt;ref name="Detroit History"/&gt; The materialization of the automobile industry put Detroit on the map as a global industrial center, allowing dozens of companies to emerge and offer jobs in the automobile industry.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; This had significant implications for population. In 1900, the US Census reported the city's population at 286,000, with over 115,000 of them working.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; By 1910, this number had grown to a total population of 466,000 with 215,000 working.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; During World War I, Detroit was a recipient of thousands of rural African Americans flowing into the city from the South, many of them taking jobs in burgeoning car factories.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; By 1920 over half of the population were [[immigrant generations]], as Detroit was the nexus for many migrating populations.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt;

Road engineers and industry workers flocked to Detroit with the passage of the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act)]].&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; The creation of interstate highways and well-maintained roads made it easier to build homes away from the urban city center, increasing [[urban sprawl]] and [[suburbanization]] that would later characterize the region.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; Just as the highways allowed for suburban sprawl, they also allowed for segregation between suburbanites (typically white) and working class city-dwellers (immigrants and African Americans) as workers could not afford to move away from the city center.&lt;ref name=Martelle/&gt; As population boomed, close living quarters instigated racially charged conflicts, through "everyday expressions of white supremacy, and segregation".&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; As thousands of workers moved into the city, many lived near the factories to be close to work and fellow union members, creating concentrated neighborhoods of working class citizens.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; These neighborhoods were often class- and race-based, perpetuating social stigmas surrounding race and ethnic group.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; Much of this racial and class-based segregation continues today.&lt;ref name=Martelle/&gt; Debates over the trade union of the automobile industry also sparked conflict, turning the working class against many wealthy industry owners and cementing the class system that would come to characterize the population.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; Ford's next conception of the automated assembly line changed city demographics, allowing unskilled labor to dominate the automobile industry and pushing skilled craftsmen out, usually further into the suburbs.&lt;ref name="Glazer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; The city developed at a rapid pace, with [[General Motors]] building offices adjacent to poor working class ghettoes, and developing the [[Detroit River]] to serve the needs of the auto industry.&lt;ref name="Glazer" /&gt;

====The Great Depression====
{{main article|Great Depression}}

With the Great Depression, consumers quickly lost faith in the economic boom in Detroit, which was augmented by the eventual market collapse in October 1929.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; The huge population of Detroit began to deplete as people lost their homes, savings, and jobs.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; Few cities were hit as hard by the Depression as Detroit, and by July 1930, a third of the automobile jobs were lost.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; The decline in job availability increased homelessness, unemployment, foreclosures, and out-migration from the city. As working and living conditions declined, particular groups were often targeted for evictions.&lt;ref name="Martelle"/&gt; One of the many examples of homelessness and shrinkage that plagued Detroit came in 1935, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt championed razing slum housing in Black Bottom, a low income, predominantly African American neighborhood in Detroit.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; More than 100 families were evicted with the promise of new public housing called the Brewster Homes.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; However, the housing program did not break ground for months, and was not fully replaced until the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; In 1933, success was won by the working class through the enactment of the [[United Automobile Workers]] (UAW) union in car companies across Detroit.&lt;ref name="Martelle"/&gt; Unionization and the UAW's push for social welfare programs helped to build a solid middle class in spite of the Depression.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; Unions could negotiate wages and benefits packages, setting the stage for other working class communities across the nation.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt;

====World War II and postwar era====
{{main article|United States home front during World War II}}
{{see also|Detroit#Postwar Era}}

The attack on Pearl Harbor shifted Detroit out of this first major economic slump.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; Along with other cities in the U.S., Detroit immediately became part of an all-out total war effort.&lt;ref name="Glazer" /&gt; Out-migration increased as men and women left to serve in World War II, while industry grew again in Detroit by using automobile factories to produce war items.&lt;ref name="Glazer" /&gt; Suddenly the problem was not unemployment, but housing shortages and overcrowding as men and women flooded into Detroit for work.&lt;ref name="Glazer" /&gt; Detroit's second wind and prolific growth attracted more immigrants and newcomers from everywhere.&lt;ref name="Glazer" /&gt; The city's physical growth was beginning to cause problems, and in 1927 the city limits were stretched to include 129 square miles.&lt;ref name="Glazer" /&gt; Housing was not built fast enough to accommodate the influx of new residents.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; Detroit's director-secretary of the Detroit Housing Commission claimed, "There just isn't such a thing as a place to rent in Detroit".&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; Government services were too limited to keep up with the rapid growth. Those who could moved to the more affluent neighborhoods of Indian Village, North Woodward, and Grosse Point on the outskirts of the city.&lt;ref name="Glazer" /&gt; Political restructuring and the introduction of new housing commissioners allowed for more public housing to be built.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt;

After World War II, Detroit experienced another economic boom that was accompanied by increased social pressures.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; Automakers profited $1.1 billion between 1945 and 1950,&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; a significant sum as the U.S. became a world superpower in the second half of the century. The ubiquity of cars and highways in Detroit encouraged further sprawl, and created segregated suburbs outside of the city limits.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; Martelle argues, "While Detroit was the region's population base, the majority of the new housing was being built outside the city limits...which were also where the new factories were being built".&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; Detroit's automobile industry had inevitably driven immigration away from the congested city to cheaper land in the suburbs, taking much of the innovation with it.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; A degree of [[white flight]] was occurring, in which the white population moved to surrounding counties, leaving low income individuals (predominantly African American) in Detroit's city center.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt;

====Decline====
{{main article|Decline of Detroit}}
{{see also|Public housing in Detroit}}

In the 1950 mayoral elections, the city passed numerous policy decisions against urban infrastructure development, as [[Albert Cobo]] threatened to raze a [[slum]] to "offer the land for sale to private individuals for redevelopment".&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; Cobo won the election, which had dramatic effects on [[public housing]] across the city.&lt;ref name="Martelle"/&gt; Cobo vetoed many of the proposed project plans, shifted the city's focus to "urban renewal projects that would eradicate slums", and replaced the Detroit Housing Commission with private developers.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; None of these plans included new housing for low income residents. In the 1950s, Mayor Cobo also refused federal funds that would have aided in public housing projects, further discriminating against low income communities.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; This decade concretized racial segregation and depopulation in Detroit.&lt;ref name=Sugrue&gt;{{cite book|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas|title=The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit|year=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Housing remained segregated across the city, and more and more whites began to leave for the suburbs.&lt;ref name="Sugrue" /&gt; The engineering of [[Interstate 94 in Michigan]] required many buildings in the city to be removed, including businesses and homes.&lt;ref name="Sugrue" /&gt; The [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three automobile manufacturers]] and other industries also implemented plans to build factories closer to consumer bases and reduce labor costs, causing a severe loss of employment opportunities within the city.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; In the 1970s, Detroit's economic base was exported overseas, with some 28% of equipment and plant investment done in foreign countries.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; Industry's move in away from Detroit "set the course for Detroit's economic collapse".&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; As jobs were lost, economic inequality also increased, such that in 1959 the median income of a white family was $7,050, but for an African-American family was $4,370.&lt;ref name="Martelle" /&gt; In 1960, Detroit's population was around 1.5 million, 29% African-American and 70% white.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Walter|title=Detroit's Tragic Decline is Largely Due to its Own Race-Based Policies|url=http://news.investors.com/ibd-editorials-perspective/121812-637538-detroit-collapse-was-due-to-race-based-politics.htm?p=full|publisher=Investor's Business Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, that number diminished to 701,475, with 82.7% African-American and 10.6% white residents&lt;ref name=Census&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Census Bureau|title=Detroit (city), Michigan|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/26/2622000.html|publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715161518/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/26/2622000.html|archivedate=2006-07-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes of shrinkage===
{{main article|Depopulation}}
{{see also|Decline of Detroit}}

====Initial causes====
Detroit's depopulation did not occur overnight, but slowly over a series of decades. Shrinkage is also not a new phenomenon, and is often the converse side of growth.&lt;ref name=Rieniets/&gt; However, shrinkage in Detroit today occurs in stark contrast to the accelerated expansion of other large cities in America.&lt;ref name="Rieniets"/&gt; Jianping and Yasushi argue that an initial cause of depopulation can be due to out-migration, lower [[fertility]] rates, and changes in residential preferences or accessibility that lead to [[suburbanization]].&lt;ref name="Jianping and Yasushi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jianping|first=Gu|author2=Asami Yasushi |title=Monitoring and modeling for city shrinkage in Japan: phenomena, managing and reviving strategies|journal=AGILE International Conference on Geographic Information Science|year=2012|pages=216–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decline of employment as auto makers moved to cheaper property also caused depopulation, as residents moved away from the city or even state to seek jobs.

====Ongoing causes====
While issues such as out-migration and unemployment spurred shrinkage initially, many factors of shrinkage are ongoing and remain prevalent in Detroit. In the suburbs, increased residential development in "undesirable" land-use patterns occurs rapidly, such as land utilization for sprawl and the lack of high-rises.&lt;ref name=Ewing/&gt; This threatens local ecosystems and land conservation and influencing further suburbanization.&lt;ref name=Ewing&gt;{{cite book|last=al.]|first=edited by John M. Marzluff ... [et|title=Urban ecology : an international perspective on the interaction between humans and nature|year=2008|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-73411-8|pages=519–535}}&lt;/ref&gt; These suburbs are also indicative of racial segregation between suburb and city. In 2010 the city of Detroit's white population was only 10.61% of total residents, whereas African Americans made up 82.69% (see [[Demographic history of Detroit]]). This racial disparity implies a further cause to Detroit's shrinkage and the lack of opportunities for its remaining residents.

Another ongoing cause of shrinkage specific to Detroit is deindustrialization,&lt;ref name="Rieniets"/&gt; primarily from Detroit's automobile industry moving to cheaper locations or overseas to Brazil and China. Other industries that supplied car parts to automakers also retreated, resulting in the loss of employment opportunities and financial crises for the entire city.&lt;ref name="Pallagst"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernt"/&gt; With the [[Great Recession]] of 2008, the Big Three automakers – [[General Motors]], [[Chrysler]], and [[Ford Motor Company]] – were forced to apply for loans from the federal government in the [[Effects of the 2008–10 automotive industry crisis on the United States]]. The subsequent bankruptcy of the automobile industry in cities across Michigan lent themselves to dramatic unemployment and lack of financial investment in the Detroit, further contributing to depopulation.&lt;ref name=Klepper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klepper|first=S.|title=The evolution of the U.S. automobile industry and Detroit as its capital|journal=9th Congress of the International Joseph A. Schumpeter Society|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; With white flight, waning industry left in Detroit, and a lack of [[social mobility]] for remaining residents, the effects of shrinkage were dire.&lt;ref name="Pallagst"/&gt; From 2000 to 2004, Detroit lost 5.1% of its overall population, a dramatic decline in such a short period of time.&lt;ref name="Pallagst"/&gt;

===Effects of shrinkage===
Both the initial and ongoing causes of shrinkage hold dramatic effects on the city and its remaining residents. Divisions between urban and suburban residences imply continued dramatic segregation that is self-perpetuating, resulting in a cycle where African American residents cannot afford to leave because property in the suburbs is too high. Simultaneously, because real estate in predominantly black neighborhoods often has a lower market value than white neighborhoods, white residents can sell their homes and leave for the suburbs, whereas home owners in black neighborhoods have a harder time selling their homes (see [[white flight]]). This depreciates African Americans' sense of [[socioeconomic status]], as inner-city residents struggle to maintain their livelihoods without economic opportunities.&lt;ref name=Hollander/&gt; Another issue that perpetuates this cycle is that many Detroit policy makers and municipal government workers refuse to see shrinkage as a problem, and avoid using the term altogether. Criticisms of the term run the gamut from shrinkage as a natural process, to using population decline as a money-making scheme through "smart decline".&lt;ref name="Hollander"/&gt; This is problematic because cities rely most heavily on their municipal governments, despite the cities' lack of political might in state legislatures. Changes to institutions, demographics, and the economy have made non-government coalitions less reliable, which is a large problem faced by shrinking cities today. Many politicians also do not see depopulation as an environmental justice issue, such that the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has not yet gotten involved in shrinkage issues in Detroit.&lt;ref name="EPA"/&gt;

In inner city Detroit, problems also arise when fewer residents inhabit buildings that cannot be maintained. Instead, these once-beautiful buildings and centers of commerce are slowly falling into disrepair, a sign of inadequate revitalization efforts.&lt;ref name="Jianping and Yasushi" /&gt; Revitalization has stalled due to municipal politicians' framing of the problem as suburban growth, rather than city shrinkage.&lt;ref name=Hollander/&gt; Building vacancy, demolition of condemned buildings, and underuse of infrastructure are rampant in Detroit, each the effect of decreased population.&lt;ref name="Jianping and Yasushi"/&gt; Lower population density in cities like Detroit can also lead to [[brownfield land]] and land wastage, two phenomena that occur after an industry abandons its facilities and leaves behind potential contaminants or [[pollutants]].&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;{{cite web|last=EPA|title=Brownfields Definition|url=http://www.epa.gov/brownfields/overview/glossary.htm|publisher=U.S. EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jianping and Yasushi include these as two main effects of city shrinkage in large metropolises:

# [[Brownfield land]] wastage is left in the city core, while expansion of suburbs consumes arable land and endangered ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Jianping and Yasushi" /&gt;
# Negative effects on residents' quality of life may occur due to lack of infrastructure, resources, community loss, and social segregation.&lt;ref name="Jianping and Yasushi" /&gt;

Increased suburbanization negatively impacts city residents due to lack of infrastructure and money devoted to the city.&lt;ref name=Ewing/&gt; Other effects include loss of city services, loss of access to public goods due to a shrinking tax base, and loss of money flowing into the city to rebuild infrastructure.&lt;ref name=Pallagst/&gt; Each of these elements further affects the continued inequity between suburban and city residents, as well as the level of opportunity and quality of life available to each Detroit resident.

====Social equity and environmental justice issues====
{{main article|Environmental justice}}
{{see also|Environmental racism}}

The causes and effects above lend insight into shrinkage as an environmental justice issue resulting from uneven development and investment disparities in [[urban planning]]. Economic development has been disproportionately skewed toward the suburbs instead of the city's core, in part because of political [[agency (philosophy)|agency]] held by predominantly white suburbs.&lt;ref name="Martelle"/&gt; Many minority residents in the city's urban center lack the resources and political influence to achieve increased economic development.&lt;ref name= "Martelle"/&gt; In cities like Detroit, there is no strong response to the deterioration of the city's core, primarily due to city planners' and politician's failure to prioritize the disadvantaged people and spaces.&lt;ref name= "Hollander"/&gt; Policy makers are instead trying to limit urban sprawl and [[gentrify]] abandoned neighborhoods to make them more appealing to the predominantly white people that have moved away from the city.&lt;ref name="Hollander"/&gt; This has broader ripple effects in driving up rents and pushing original residents out of these neighborhoods. For example, the [[Detroit International Riverfront]] district near downtown has been historically used as a site for subsistence fishing, typically by resident African Americans.&lt;ref name="Kalkirtz et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kalkirtz|first=V. |author2=M. Martinez |author3=A. Teague|title=Environmental Justice and Fish Consumption Advisories on Detroit River Area of Concern|journal=Doctoral Dissertation, University of Michigan|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Redevelopment of this district in response to shrinkage through casinos, shopping, and expensive condos has led the city to restrict fishing on the riverfront, raising questions of environmental justice inequity.&lt;ref name="Kalkirtz et al."/&gt; Traditional black communities that used this region for subsistence fishing are no longer able to do so, pushing them to seek other forms of subsistence in grocery stores or corner stores.&lt;ref name="Kalkirtz et al."/&gt;

Another component of shrinkage in cities like Detroit is politicians who refuse to recognize and prioritize shrinkage as a problem, instead focusing on growth in other regions away from the city center.&lt;ref name=Bernt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernt|first=M.|title=Partnerships for Demolition: The governance of urban renewal in East Germany's shrinking cities|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=754–769|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2009.00856.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schilling&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schilling|first=J.|title=Blueprint Buffalo&amp;mdash;Using Green Infrastructure to Reclaim America's Shrinking Cities|journal=The Future of Shrinking Cities|year=2009|volume=1|pages=149–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding is often redirected from the city center to the suburbs, encouraging further sprawl. This is due to a continued political thrust of [[Manifest Destiny]], a concept that regional planners utilize in expanding suburban housing.&lt;ref name="Schilling" /&gt; According to this theory, if a city is not expanding, it is not considered successful.&lt;ref name="Schilling" /&gt; Without a plan to address shrinkage, it is likely that the surplus of vacant infrastructure and buildings would persist, along with housing problems.&lt;ref name="Schilling"/&gt; Some theorize that if left unchecked, this trend of vacancy would continue outside of city limits, affecting the suburbs as well.&lt;ref name="Schilling"/&gt; However, this perspective turns shrinkage into a sort of disease with its host as low income communities and [[Person of color|communities of color]], rather than addressing the social and racial segregation that catalyzes it.&lt;ref name="Schilling"/&gt; An attempted response to shrinkage and misallocated funding was made by the city through Detroit's Neighborhood Stabilization Plan (NSP). The NSP was designed to address abandoned and condemned housing structures and received federal grant funding, but has not had much effect, failing to distribute funds evenly to historically poor neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Cockrel et al."&gt;{{cite web|last=Cockrel|first=Kenneth V.|title=Neighborhood Stabilization Program Plan|url=http://www.detroitmi.gov/Portals/0/docs/planning/pdf/NSP_Approved/detroitNSP_R31_29_09_2.pdf|publisher=City of Detroit|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715145614/https://www.detroitmi.gov/Portals/0/docs/planning/pdf/NSP_Approved/detroitNSP_R31_29_09_2.pdf|archivedate=2010-07-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSP's distribution requirements include income status, but no data on race or gender, which are both important factors of shrinkage.&lt;ref name="Cockrel et al."/&gt; The plan has had little effect on remediating vacancies and depopulation in the city's core.

Other problems include the presence of [[brownfields]] near residential areas within the city. Historically, industries placed their facilities near working-class neighborhoods to ensure a broad labor base. However, as Detroit's automobile industry outsourced and moved outside the city limits,&lt;ref name="Martelle"/&gt; these decrepit and polluting facilities remained adjacent to low-income communities of color. The City of Detroit attempted to ameliorate these brownfields by creating the Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority, "an authority providing incentives for the city to revitalize underdeveloped or under-utilized properties due to abandonment or environmental contamination"&lt;ref name=DBRA&gt;{{cite web|last=Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority|title=What is the DBRA?|url=http://michigan.gov/documents/deq/deq-rrd-BRA-DetroitBrownfieldRedevelopmentAuthority_297365_7.pdf|publisher=City of Detroit}}&lt;/ref&gt;(see also [[Planning and development in Detroit]]). The city outlined three tenets in facilitating the project: brownfield tables and templates, in-house meetings, and coordination with the community.&lt;ref name="DBRA"/&gt; Some of the clean-up programs include turning abandoned lots and buildings into spaces for performances and art, as well as new business, retail, and apartment buildings.&lt;ref name="DBRA"/&gt; Many of the future building projects are expected to bring thousands of new jobs and billions of dollars to the city, helping revitalize depressed areas and assist original residents.&lt;ref name="DBRA"/&gt;  Programs created by the DBRA are intended to create up to 10,000 new housing units in neighborhoods near brownfields, as well as preserve "greenfields" from development.&lt;ref name=Poindexter&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poindexter|first=G.|title=Separate and Unequal: A comment on the urban development aspect of brownfields programs|journal=Fordham Urban Law Journal|year=1997|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, much criticism has been raised about the effectiveness of this organization in serving the interests of surrounding neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Poindexter"/&gt; The DBRA could also be using this brownfield program as a means to gentrify areas of the city to attract new residents instead of providing support for long-term residents.&lt;ref name="Poindexter"/&gt;

===Mitigating shrinkage===

Early efforts to mitigate shrinkage included the Detroit Vacant Land Survey of 1990. This included at attempt at de-densification, in which city residents and development were ushered into and concentrated into some neighborhoods while vacating others.&lt;ref name="Hollander et al."/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorensen&gt;{{cite web|last=Sorensen|first=Deborah|title=Looking Back, Looking Forward: Notes on Detroit|url=http://www.nbm.org/about-us/national-building-museum-online/looking-back-looking-forward.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, residents would be moved into more densely populated areas that were already owned by the city.&lt;ref name=Sorensen/&gt; The Survey and resulting city planning were met by retaliation by residents, and failed.&lt;ref name=Sorensen/&gt; Hollander et al. suggest another model of de-densification includes dispersed vacancy, in which property owners are encouraged by the city to take title to surrounding vacant lots.&lt;ref name=Hollander/&gt;

Today, city planners offer little guidance on how to shrink a city, even when granted funding to help mitigate shrinkage.&lt;ref name="Schilling"/&gt; City planning policies are usually directed toward growth and new development, using tools such as comprehensive planning, zoning, subdivision regulations, and urban growth boundaries.&lt;ref name="Schilling"/&gt; Since the beginning of the 2008 [[Great Recession]], there have been some policies and financial investment in Detroit's infrastructure. The Neighborhood Stabilization Plan (NSP) was proposed by the Planning and Development Department of the City of Detroit,&lt;ref name=NSP&gt;{{cite web|last=Planning and Development Department|title=NSP I|url=http://www.detroitmi.gov/DepartmentsandAgencies/PlanningDevelopmentDepartment/NeighborhoodStabilizationPlan(NSP)/NSPI.aspx|publisher=City of Detroit}}&lt;/ref&gt; and builds off of Congress' [[Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008]].&lt;ref name="Cockrel et al."/&gt; The NSP aimed to address the impacts of foreclosure in communities that were detrimentally affected by the economic crisis, and hopes to support market recovery and stabilize neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=Hollander/&gt; However, this policy has been largely ineffective due to city government delays, poor infrastructural planning, and misallocation of funds.&lt;ref name="Cockrel et al."/&gt;

Other efforts to mitigate shrinkage include using occupied-housing-unit density as a metric "to analyze changes in physical land use associated with population decline in urban neighborhoods".&lt;ref name=Hollander&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollander|first=J.|title=Moving Toward a Shrinking Cities Metric: Analyzing Land Use Changes Associated with Depopulation in Flint, Michigan|journal=Cityscape|year=2010|volume=12|issue=1|pages=133–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a response to government proposed "smart decline", a method aimed at gentrification and consolidating abandoned neighborhoods rather than addressing root causes of shrinkage.&lt;ref name=Hollander/&gt; Smart decline has been met with strong opposition in Detroit, especially when city planners were told by outside observers how to shrink "gracefully".&lt;ref name=Hollander/&gt; Many smart decline plans are inherently top-down, assume a blank slate at project sites, and require an uninvolved and quiet public opinion.&lt;ref name=Hollander/&gt; This concept's exclusion of community opinion is largely why it has been met by so much opposition. However, Hollander and Németh have proposed a version of smart decline that is founded instead on ethics, equity, and social justice, including town hall meetings, public hearings, and the merits of potential solutions.&lt;ref name=Hollander/&gt;

Another attempt to remedy the shrinkage problem has been to capitalize on the population decline in Detroit's urban core for the benefit of remaining residents. Setting aside abandoned lots and green space for "recreation, agriculture, green infrastructure, and other non-traditional land uses will benefit existing residents and attract future development, and enable shrinking cities to reinvent themselves as more productive, sustainable, and ecologically sound places".&lt;ref name="Hollander, Pallagst, Schwarz, and Popper"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollander|first=J.|author2=K.

Popper |title=Planning Shrinking Cities|journal=Progress in Planning|year=2009|volume=72|issue=4|pages=223–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; While developing these lots into green space would benefit the community, many residents fear that it could result in increased development of high rises and office buildings, rather than community resources.&lt;ref name=Ryan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ryan|first=B.|journal=48th ISOCARP Congress|year=2012|title=Shrinking-city urban form as a determinant of urban policy: The case of Flint, Michigan, USA|volume=Urban Form and Urban Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The future planning decisions for Detroit, as well as the future for environmental justice in relation to city planning and depopulation, are slowly improving. Much more research has been done on shrinking cities in the U.S., as well as in Detroit in particular. In order for more work to be done by the city government and non-government organizations, shrinkage must be seen as more than an issue of income, but an issue of race, gender, and household size.&lt;ref name="Cockrel et al."/&gt; Problems of unemployment and racial discrimination exist as functions of environmental injustice, requiring policy makers to address inequality in funding distribution and housing availability for people of color.&lt;ref name=Audirac&gt;{{cite journal|last=Audirac|first=I|title=4 Shrinking Cities in the Fourth Urban Revolution?|journal=Shrinking Cities: International Perspectives and Policy Implications|year=2013|volume=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations like Detroit Future City have begun work on carbon buffering, a "best practices" demolition program, and tree remediation.&lt;ref name="Detroit Future City"&gt;{{cite web|last=Detroit Future City|title=Projects|url=http://detroitfuturecity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case study: New Orleans, Louisiana==

===History of New Orleans' changing demographics===
French colonists founded the city of [[New Orleans]] in 1718, traveling from [[Mobile, Alabama]] to the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref name="Bullard 2009"&gt;Bullard, Rover and Wright, Beverly. 2009.

Driven by the 1791 slave insurgency of Saint Domingue&lt;ref name="Campanella 2007" /&gt; and threat of war with England, the French sold 530,000,000 acres west of the Mississippi including New Orleans to the United States Government.&lt;ref name="Milestones"&gt;{{Citation
| publisher = Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, United States Department of State
| title = Milestones:1801-1829
}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the purchase, over 10,000 refugees from Saint Domingue doubled the size of the city, changing the population to "1/3 white, 1/3 free people of color and 1/3 African slaves" by 1810.&lt;ref name="Fussell 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's population expanded even more and experienced shifts between 1830 and 1860 when the city's population grew three times as large, as a result of an influx of European immigrants whose population overtook the slave population. As a result of the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1865, the emancipated African American population in the city doubled to 50,000 by 1870.&lt;ref name="Campanella 2007" /&gt; The subsequent [[Jim Crow]] laws segregated blacks to more low-lying and marginalized areas of the city, including black Creoles who previously resided in the [[French Quarter]].&lt;ref name="Bullard 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Campanella 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fussell 2007" /&gt;  However, by 1900 migration to New Orleans slowed, lowering it from the 5th to 12th largest among all American cities, placing it below the growth rate of Chicago, Detroit, and Milwaukee. This change took place largely because of New Orleans' reliance on agricultural exports that did not require urban laborers. This decline was somewhat lessened by the railway that passed through the city and connected to ocean freighters.

Before the 20th century, New Orleans' neighborhoods were of mixed race, but a combination of [[Jim Crow]] laws, racially segregated public housing, unequal educational opportunities, white flight, and unequal employment opportunities led to a racially segregated city. During this time, the city shifted from being tripartite to a biracial, meaning individuals were considered to be black or white. PhD Elizabeth Fussell explains how unequal opportunities based on race contributed to economic and geographic disparities in New Orleans over the years:&lt;blockquote&gt; explicitly unequal treatment of those racial groups has been reproduced through an interlocking system of unequal educational opportunities, residential segregation, and blacks were consistently far less likely than whites to complete secondary school, even to present. The effect of racial educational inequity during the "human capital century" has been to diminish the labor-market opportunities and life changes of the individuals that lag behind.&lt;ref name="Fussell 2007"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Beginning in 1960, New Orleans began to see population loss, and just before [[Hurricane Katrina]] hit, New Orleans had almost twice as many people living below the poverty level than the national average and a 30% lower average income. The storm worsened population loss and changed the demographics of the city, resulting in an increased proportion of whites population and decreased proportion of black individuals in the years following.&lt;ref name="Fussell 2007"/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1970 to 2000, the population shrank by 18%, and the region's employment rate fell from 66% to 42%.&lt;ref name="Katz 2006" /&gt; This resulted partially from the decline of key economic enterprises in the area. New Orleans relied on tourism, a part, and oil, while elsewhere in the United States cities experienced technologically driven growth.&lt;ref name="Fussell 2007" /&gt; The oil boom that had once economically supported the city collapsed in 1979 and 1980, leading to job loss and the proliferation of depopulation.&lt;ref name="Bullard 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Katz 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal

Many other changes in the area incentivized [[suburbanization]], or movement from the city area to surrounding suburbs, including the development of interstate 10 in 1955,&lt;ref name="Bullard 2009" /&gt; the draining of [[backswamp]]s that were formerly uninhabitable, and federal tax incentives.&lt;ref name="Gyourko 1997"&gt;{{Cite journal

Board of Education|school integration]] and [[Hurricane Betsy]] drove many whites from New Orleans neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Landphair 2007" /&gt; Racially segregated public housing, racial discrimination from lenders and realtors contributed to the racialized emigration of New Orleans residens.&lt;ref name="Fussell 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spain 1979" /&gt;

====After Hurricane Katrina====
Compounded with years of poor economic growth, the largest contributor to the worsening population decline of New Orleans was [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita]], which resulted in the flooding of over 80% of the city.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2007" /&gt; The storm displaced 800,000 people, which is the greatest displacement in the United States since the [[Dust Bowl]].&lt;ref name="Morse 2008" /&gt; In 2010, the population of New Orleans was only at 76% of what it was in 2005.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Effects of shrinkage===

====Before Hurricane Katrina====
Before Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans faced racial segregation and poverty levels above the national average. In 1960 it had the fifth highest level of poverty of all US cities, as well as some of the worst substandard housing.&lt;ref name="Spain 1979" /&gt; Poverty levels were at 24.5% in 2005, which were almost double the national level, and average income levels were at $30,711, which was about $16,000 less than the national average. Over the years, the city dealt with an aging infrastructure and gradual sinking of the city until portions were below sea level &lt;ref name="Comfort 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that in inner city neighborhoods over 50% of children had levels of lead in their blood above federal guidelines.&lt;ref name="Bullard 2009" /&gt;

From the beginning of the 20th century to 1980, New Orleans faced increasing residential segregation.&lt;ref name="Fussell 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spain 1979"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment of blacks was as much as 10 times that of whites, and blacks paid a greater proportion of their income for housing than whites. In the 1970s, four times as many blacks had incomes placing them below the poverty level than whites, and by 1980 there was a belt along the undesirable backswamp of majority black residents.&lt;ref name="Spain 1979" /&gt; 
In addition to facilitating the growth of suburbs and advancing depopulation,&lt;ref name="Bullard 2009" /&gt; the creation of [[Interstate 10]] displaced many historically black neighborhoods &lt;ref name="Spain 1979" /&gt; including Tulane/Gravier, Tremé/Lafitte and the 7th Ward.&lt;ref name="Freeways 2012"&gt;{{Citation

====After Hurricane Katrina====
Hurricane Katrina and shrinkage of New Orleans had significant effects on various groups in the city. African Americans, renters, the elderly, and people with low income were disproportionately impacted by Hurricane Katrina compared to affluent and white residents.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morse 2008" /&gt; First, African Americans are less likely to have rental and homeowner's insurance and to have insurance with major companies as compared to whites, which is related to practices of racially based insurance redlining.&lt;ref name="Bullard 2009" /&gt; Since people of color were more likely to rely on public transportation, the dependence of the evacuation on personal transportation impacted these individuals more than those with personal means to leave the area.&lt;ref name="Morse 2008" /&gt; Some academics highlight this disparity as an issue of [[climate justice|climate injustice]],&lt;ref name="Canadian 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal

The number of homeless people in the city was at double the pre-Katrina rate by 2008, and African Americans faced discrimination in housing transactions, finding inferior treatment based on race. The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) gave some evacuees from Katrina and Rita trailers that were contaminated with [[formaldehyde]], a mistake that took over two years to fix.&lt;ref name="Bullard 2009" /&gt; The National Fair Housing alliance &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalfairhousing.org/|title=National Fair Housing Alliance|website=National Fair Housing Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed in a report that information about units was withheld from or differentially given to African Americans compared to whites, and pointed out examples of racist practices of landlords and online advertisements.&lt;ref name="National 2006"&gt;{{Cite conference

Even after federal and state governments spent $4 billion on revitalization efforts to repair levees, black New Orleans is disproportionately endangered by future flooding.&lt;ref name="Bullard 2009" /&gt;  In the first four months after the storm, the city's white population rose while the black population declined.&lt;ref name="Morse 2008" /&gt; As of 2006, evacuees that were African American were 5 times more likely to be unemployed when compared to evacuees that were white.&lt;ref name="Hope 2007"&gt;{{Cite conference

Of additional concern are the effects on children, who face four times the risk of having serious symptoms of emotional disturbance than comparable children. Moreover, while many parents feel that their children need professional help, the majority of them did not get it or have access to it.&lt;ref name="Children's 2010"&gt;{{Cite conference

===Planning in response to shrinkage===

====Before Hurricane Katrina====
There is little evidence that New Orleans was planned and developed with a specific focus on shrinkage as a phenomenon. This is problematic, because even though the metropolitan area as a whole was growing, there was simultaneously an increase in suburbanization.&lt;ref name="Campanella 2007" /&gt; Many long-time residents and their needs were left out of planning decisions due to race and socioeconomic status.

====After Hurricane Katrina====
Planning for shrinkage as a result of Hurricane Katrina focuses most of its attention on reconstructing the city after the damage of the storm. There are a variety of methods proposed by academics, communities and governing bodies to develop New Orleans in the aftermath of shrinkage as well as Hurricane Katrina. A large part of the dominant planning narrative seeks to make New Orleans "bigger and better" while still decreasing the overall size of the city.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011" /&gt; Through the creation of various commissions, many ideas have been proposed and have incited controversy.&lt;ref name="Olshansky 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differed from BNOB as it mainly drew from the community and "was based on the assumption that all areas of the city would be rebuilt," and planned to recover every neighborhood. One of their proposals was a "lot next door" policy, in which property owners were given first priority in purchasing adjacent homes.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2007" /&gt;

====Office of Recovery Management====
Beginning in January 2007, the Office of Recovery Management was funded by the city and by foundations. It was created to develop a strategy for recovery. It was headed by Edward Blakely, who promoted strategies such as "trigger projects" in 17 target areas &lt;ref name="Olshansky 2008" /&gt; to drive development, and the creation of target areas determined to be renew, redevelop or rebuild zones.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2007" /&gt; As of 2007, the project was encountering problems with allocating funds assured by the [[Louisiana Recovery Authority]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lra.louisiana.gov/splash/|title=Louisiana Recovery Authority|website=lra.louisiana.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and FEMA.&lt;ref name="Olshansky 2008" /&gt;

==Case study: Leipzig, Germany==

===History===
{{Main|Leipzig}}
Leipzig was on its way to becoming a [[metropolis]] that attracted people from all over Europe due to its centralized location. It was one of the major European centers of learning and culture in music and publishing. After [[World War II]], it became the major urban and trade center within East Germany. Because Leipzig played a large role in the decline of [[Communism]] in [[East Germany]], the city itself also suffered economic drawbacks and declines resulting in a change in landscape, infrastructure and geography. Today, Leipzig is considered a 'shrinking city' because of its rapid population decline and infrastructure devastation. While Leipzig is one of the most livable cities in East Germany and is a prominent cultural center, it is still suffering the repercussions of the last World War, economically, politically and socially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|pages=13–14|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes of shrinkage===
{{See also|East Germany}}
After World War II, the local economy in Leipzig was deflated and the regional economy desperately needed to be revitalized. The fall of socialist East Germany led to a mass emigration to other areas of the country. The housing vacancy had risen to 20%, and renovations in the older neighborhoods were needed. The post socialist conditions are partly to blame for the state in which many east German cities find themselves in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schetke|first=Sophie|author2=Dagmar, Haase |title=Multi-Criteria Assessment of Socio-Economic Aspects in Shrinking Cities. Experiences from Eastern Germany|journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review|date=September 2007|volume=28|issue=7|pages=483–503|doi=10.1016/j.eiar.2007.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because east Germany was a socialist country merging with a west-European capitalist country, it has a unique situation. Lingering socialist ideals competed with very democratic western philosophy, causing issues for old and new generations. Integrating east Germany into West Germany has been problematic because of regional variations due to differences in economic performance in the recent years. The whole area suffers from problems like joblessness, population loss, and a lack of renovation. In the case of Leipzig specifically, a dramatic loss of manufacturing jobs and mass out-migration has accelerated the shrinking process. Loss of stock in commercial real estate and housing stock produced a problematic picture to the whole of Germany and Europe in general. The transition from 40 years of socialist rule to a democratic-capitalist economy was not as smooth as expected. The loss of economic and socio-cultural importance did not fare well for Leipzig, or Germany as a whole. Becoming apart of the German Democratic Republic lead to the loss of several national functions of the former unitary state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|pages=15–16|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of shrinkage===
In 1949, when Leipzig was a part of the German Democratic Republic, the city underwent many infrastructure changes. National and regional industries, like banks and the publishing media, left Leipzig for the capitalist western Germany. The German Democratic Republic prioritized pre-war traditions rather than investing in innovations; the city of Leipzig was to become the industrial center with large-scale mining, which caused pollution in the air and the national and cultural landscape of the city was drastically changed. Villages were torn down to make room for the new machinery and coalfields. This caused inhabitants to leave the area, and at the end of GDR era in 1989, the population shrunk down to 530,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|page=16|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some neighborhoods were neglected because of their past-socialist nature. These infrastructures then began to disintegrate and there were no initiatives established to upkeep them. Nobody wanted to be reminded of communist times. 75% of the local industry was closed down within the years after the reunification of Germany. Small companies took over parts of the state, but it was not noticeable due to the large outflux of industry years earlier. There was huge environmental damage and social costs. The city had turned into a coal producing state, but the energy value of coal was poor, so continuation of coal mining was not economical. The city was destroyed by landscape devastation and air pollution, and the industry was not thriving and would not be continuing in the area. The physical infrastructure of roads, buildings and [[public transportation]] was designed for much larger population than is present, they are too large to represent the current population. The population is now stagnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schetke|first=Sophie|author2=Dagmar Haase |title=Multi-Criteria Assessment of Socio-Environmental Aspects in Shrinking Cities. Experiences from Eastern Germany|journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review|date=September 2007|volume=28|pages=484–489|doi=10.1016/j.eiar.2007.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policies and investment decisions===
[[Urbanization]] is a cyclical process and urban and regional decline will make way for new growth. The Fordist model of [[industrialization]] was employed, which was characterized by mass standardized production and mass employment in large complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|page=13|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mass production technology created increases in output due to specialization of jobs based on individual workers' skills and top-down management. While the output was unprecedented, this put added pressure on wages causing stagnation. There was an unbalanced relationship between consumption and production in that there was not enough payoff for the working class to incentivize working hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amsden|first=Alice|title=Third World Industrialization: 'Global Fordism' Or a New Model?|journal=New Left Review|date=July–August 1990|volume=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
[[Image:Suburbia by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|200px|A suburban [[land use planning|land use]] pattern]]Suburbanization is the growth of areas on the fringes of cities. It is one of the many causes of the increase in [[urban sprawl]].
[[Human capital]], creativity and competitiveness are key to successfully industrializing the city. Neglected areas of the city were ignored because of their connection to former socialist memories. Instead of renovating, large city centers were built away from the center of the city. These large buildings fell victim to the effects of neglect like decay. Large construction and renovation projects were meant to strengthen the optimistic view on the future of Germany. [[Suburb]]an housing projects were constructed around the city so the houses could be offered to those who left the city earlier. The goal was to offer housing opportunities so that the population would come back and the regional population would not decline too drastically.&lt;ref name="Bontje 2004 20"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|page=20|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a policy of 'restitution before financial compensation' which had an adverse effect on inner city renovation projects. This was an accelerated out-migration to the suburbs and countryside which resulted in many empty houses in the city despite their perfect state of condition after renovation. Stimulating [[suburbanization]] increased the already too large housing stock in the region and failed to mitigate the inner city vacancy problems. The city would do best if the development policy was aimed at modest economic growth and employment was created to stabilize the urban population and prevent a new exodus to the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|page=18|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Census trends===
{{See also|East Germany#Population}}
After the fall of East Germany, the population of the German Democratic Republic suffered a decline. After the Second World War, there was an out-migration of 3.8 million people from East Germany to West Germany. This was so drastic that East Germany would eventually cease to exist. The rest of Germany felt the only option was to cut off ties completely with Eastern Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laar|first=Matt|title=The Power of Freedom: Central and Eastern Europe after 1945|date=April 2010|publisher=Unitas|isbn=994918858X|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the shift from communist to capitalist gave new employment opportunities in retail, transportation and communication, but this only accounted for a small amount of the economy that was lost. There were not enough people living in the city to make use of these opportunities. Unemployment was not too high at 20%, but still higher than other cities in West Germany and other EU countries. The working-class neighborhoods fell victim to the large-scale vacancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|page=17|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Efforts to mitigate shrinkage===
The new policies are shifting their focus toward stabilizing the current population and adjusting the housing stock to the population size. The city has developed a strategy to adapt housing stock and infrastructure according to a 'shrinking city' model. There will be demolition of housing that were neglected or there is too little demand for living.&lt;ref name="Bontje 2004 19"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bontje|first=Marco|title=Facing the Challenge of Shrinking Cities in East Germany: The Case of Leipzig|journal=GeoJournal|year=2004|volume=61|series=1|page=19|doi=10.1007/sgejo-004-0843-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These neglected areas are then replaced with parks or squares. The goal is to turn the area into a more attractive and greener, nature-oriented environment (See also [[gentrification]]). This in turn encourages a more spacious livelihood and leads to a higher quality of life, which could potentially attract urban dwellers to these remodeled neighborhoods, as well as land developers.&lt;ref name="Schetke 498"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schetke|first=Sophie|author2=Dagmar Haase |title=Multi-Criteria Assessment of Socio-Environmental Aspects in Shrinking Cities. Experiences from Eastern Germany|journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review|date=September 2007|volume=28|page=498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stimulating owner-occupancy is another important strategy that strengthens the ties between the city and its inhabitants. There is a lack of clients and purchasing power for retailers, which causes problems especially for working-class neighborhoods. There is a public hearing that is held to brainstorm strategies for solving this problem, like focusing exclusively on physical solutions like improvements of housing stock and public space.&lt;ref name="Bontje 2004 19"/&gt; Long-term monitoring of sustainable urban open space development at the city district level will also be helpful in the long run. Concrete socio-economic evidence of the benefits that green spaces bring to shrinking cities would be a valuable contribution to the rehabilitation of a shrinking city like Leipzig.&lt;ref name="Schetke 498"/&gt;

===Plans===
A coherent urban development strategy is hard to find because there are many policy plans, each dealing with different parts of the problem. The government is not to blame completely for the state Leipzig is in as there are many facets of the shrinking city problem that need to be addressed. The government has not failed to find the right solutions, or been too optimistic in their judgements. Leipzig has a bad reputation in other parts of West Germany, which is where most investors come from. Leipzig can claim that they have branches of large office of West German companies like BMW and Porsche, but this does not result in enough jobs or opportunities to push the unemployment rate back to an acceptable level. The politicians and investors should not see the shrinking of the city as negative or a problem that cannot be solved; but that it offers things that other cities do not have like space for innovation, creative subcultures, cheap start-up rents, and an increase of green space for making the city more attractive. The attempt to get the [[2012 Olympics]] to take place in Leipzig brought renewed recognition for the discussion of more building projects. For now, the city needs to focus on stabilizing the current population and lowering the [[unemployment]] rate by increasing opportunities within the city.&lt;ref name="Bontje 2004 20"/&gt;

== Environmental justice ==
A rapidly contracting population is often viewed holistically, as a citywide and sometimes even regional struggle. However, shrinking cities, by their nature and how local officials respond to the phenomena, can have a disproportionate social and environmental impact on the less fortunate, resulting in the emergence of issues relating to environmental injustices. This paradigm was established almost immediately after cities started shrinking in significance during the mid-20th century and persists today in varying forms.

=== Historical precedent ===
Although the concept of [[environmental justice]] and the movement it sparked was formally introduced and popularized starting in the late 1980s, its historical precedent in the context of shrinking cities is rooted in mid-20th century trends that took place in the United States.

In an American context, historical [[suburbanization]] and subsequent ill-fated [[urban renewal]] efforts are largely why the very poor and people of color are concentrated in otherwise emptied cities, where they are adversely plagued by conditions which are today identified as environmental injustices or [[environmental racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Urban Communities in the 21st Century: From Industrialization to Sustainability|publisher=Cognella|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=978-1-609279-83-7|page=36|author=Robert Beuregard|edition=1|editor=Malo André Hutson}}&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions, although created and exacerbated through mid-20th century actions, still persist today in many cases and include: living in close proximity to freeways; living without convenient access, if any, to healthy foods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Urban Communities in the 21st Century: From Industrialization to Sustainability|publisher=Cognella|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=978-1-609279-83-7|page=526|author=Lisa Feldstein|edition=1|editor=Malo André Hutson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and green space. Unlike white people, people of color were socially and legally barred from taking advantage of federal government policy encouraging suburban flight. For example, the early construction of freeways&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sevilla|first=Charles Martin|title=Asphalt Through the Model City: A Study of Highways and the Urban Poor|journal=Journal of Urban Law|year=1971|volume=49|issue=297|page=298|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/udetmr49&amp;div=18&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals#309|accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; coupled with practices such as [[redlining]] and racially restrictive [[Covenant (law)|covenants]], physically prevented people of color from participating in the mass migration to the suburbs, leaving them in – what would become – hollowed and blighted city cores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Kenneth T.|title=Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States|year=1985|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-503610-7|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because income and race are deeply embedded in understanding the formation of suburbs and shrinking cities, any interventions responding to the shrinking city phenomenon will almost invariably confront issues of social and environmental justice. It is not the case in Europe, where suburbanization has been less extreme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shrinking Cities Volume 1: International Research|year=2005|publisher=Hatje Cantz Verlag|location=Ostfildern-Ruit, Germany|isbn=3-7757-1682-3|page=71|author=Robert Fishman|edition=1|editor=Philipp Oswalt|chapter=Global Processes of Shrinkage}}&lt;/ref&gt; and drivers of shrinking cities are also more closely linked to aging demographics, and deindustrialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Future of Shrinking Cities: Problems, Patterns, and Strategies of Urban Transformation in a Global Context|journal=Institute of Urban and Regional Development Berkeley|date=May 2009|series=IURD Monograph Series|page=69|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/7zz6s7bm|accessdate=20 April 2014|author=Ivonne Audirac|editor1-first=Karina|editor1-last=Pallagst|publisher=Center for Global Metropolitan Studies, Institute of Urban and Regional Development, and the Shrinking Cities International Research Network|format=.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Case studies ===
In addition to discriminatory policy-driven decisions of the past, which caused cities to contract in population and created inhospitable living conditions for the poor and people of color in urban cores, environmental justices concerns also arise in present initiatives that seek solutions for cities struggling with considerable population losses.

==== New Orleans ====
[[New Orleans]], like many major American cities, saw its population decrease considerably over the latter half of the 20th century, losing almost 50% of the population from its peak in 1960. In large part because of [[white flight]] and suburbanization, the population loss perpetuated existing racial segregation and left people of color (mostly African Americans) in the city center.&lt;ref name=Wright2007&gt;{{cite book|title=The Black Metropolis In The Twenty-First Century: Race, Power, and Politics of Place|year=2007|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=978-0-7425-4329-4|pages=175–176|author=Beverly H.

[[Image:wilton-warrington 07.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The corner of Wilton &amp; Warrington streets, March, 2007, almost two years after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans]]
Responding to Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans Mayor [[C. Ray Nagin]] formed the [[Bring New Orleans Back Commission]] in September 2005.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeucht2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehrenfeucht|first=Renia|author2=Marla Nelson |title=Planning, Population Loss and Equity in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina|journal=Planning Practice &amp; Research|date=11 May 2011|volume=26|issue=2|pages=134–136|doi=10.1080/02697459.2011.560457|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02697459.2011.560457|accessdate=20 April 2014|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the commission was to assist in redevelopment decision-making for the city. The commission shared its proposal for redevelopment in January 2006, however it faced some criticism related to environmental justice concerns. The commission's proposal was presented prior to many residents having returned to the city and their homes.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeucht2011/&gt; The process was not very inclusive, particularly with locals of impacted areas, who were predominantly from disadvantaged communities. While the proposal addressed future potential flooding by incorporating new parks in low-laying areas to manage storm water, the locations of the proposed greenspaces required the elimination of some of the low-income neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeucht2011/&gt; Residents largely viewed the proposal as forced displacement and as benefitting primarily more affluent residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Marla|author2=Renia Ehrenfeucht |author3=Shirley Laska |title=Planning, Plans, and People: Professional Expertise, Local Knowledge, and Governmental Action in Post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans|journal=Cityscape: A Journal of Policy Development and Research|year=2007|volume=9|issue=3|page=136|ssrn=1090161|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was roundly rejected by residents and advocates for residents.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeucht2013/&gt;

A later intervention to alleviate the mounting abandonment and blight (which existed prior to Katrina but was exacerbated by the disaster) was Ordinance No. 22605, enacted by the New Orleans city council in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Willard-Lewis|first=Cynthia|title=NO. 22605 MAYOR COUNCIL SERIES|url=http://www.noraworks.org/public/files/general-uploads/LND_Ordinance1.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2014|format=.pdf|date=April 5, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126145537/http://www.noraworks.org/public/files/general-uploads/LND_Ordinance1.pdf|archivedate=26 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for the ordinance was to allow the city to establish a "Lot Next Door" program, which seeks to "assist in the elimination of abandoned or blighted properties; to spur neighborhood reinvestment, enhance stability in the rental housing market, and maintain and build wealth within neighborhoods." The program intended to give owner occupants the opportunity to purchase abutting properties (city acquired properties formerly state-owned or owned by the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority) as a means of returning properties to neighborhood residents.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeucht2013/&gt; It later expanded to allow any individual to purchase a property if that person or a family member would live there. The impact of the program, however, was unevenly distributed throughout the city. Although black neighborhoods in the low-laying topographical regions were hit the hardest by Katrina, affluent neighborhoods with high rates of owner occupancy better absorbed vacant and abandoned properties than areas with more rental units.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeucht2013/&gt;

==== Detroit ====
Perhaps the city most commonly associated with the concept of shrinking cities, [[Detroit]] too has grappled with issues of environmental justice. Detroit's current circumstances, as it struggles to deal with a population less than half of that from its peak in 1950, are [[Decline of Detroit|partially the direct result]] of the same racist process, which left only the poor and people of color in urban city centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=June Manning|title=Redevelopment and Race: Planning A Finer City in Postwar Detroit|year=2013|publisher=Wayne State University|location=Detroit, Michigan|isbn=978-0-8143-3907-7|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city presently faces economic strain since only six percent of the taxable value of real estate in the [[Metro Detroit|tri-county Detroit area]] is in the city of Detroit itself while the remaining ninety-four percent is in the suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallagher|first=John|title=Revolution Detroit: Strategies for Urban Reinvention|year=2013|publisher=Wayne State University|location=Detroit, Michigan|isbn=978-0-8143-3871-1|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the city has made attempts, out of necessity, to address both its economic and population decline.

Nichols}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of right-sizing and repurposing Detroit, however, is a contentious issue.&lt;ref name=Ewing2012&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Ewing, Heidi and Rachel Grady (Directors)|title=Detropia|medium=motion picture|publisher=ITVS|location=United States|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some locals are determined to stay put in their homes&lt;ref name=Grey2010/&gt; while others compare the efforts to past segregation and forced relocation.&lt;ref name=Ewing2012/&gt; Mayor Bing clarified that people would not be forced to move, but residents in certain parts of the city "need to understand they're not going to get the kind of services they require."&lt;ref name=McGreal2010&gt;{{cite news|last=McGreal|first=Chris|title=Detroit mayor plans to shrink city by cutting services to some areas: Services such as sewage and policing may be cut off to force people out of desolate areas where houses cost as little as £100|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/17/detroit-shrinking|accessdate=23 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to right-sizing Detroit as a means to deal with a massively decreased city population and economic shortfall, Mayor Bing also undertook budget cuts.&lt;ref name=McGreal2010/&gt;  
Although often necessary and painful, certain cuts, such as those to the city's bus services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sands|first=David|title=Detroit Bus Cuts Reveal Depths Of National Public Transit Crisis|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/16/detroit-bus-cuts-a-thousand-cuts_n_1647867.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=23 April 2014|date=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; can produce harms in an environmental justice framework. In Detroit, despite the city's massive size and sprawl, roughly 26% of households have no automobile access, compared to 9.2% nationally.&lt;ref name=Dolan2014&gt;{{cite news|last=Dolan|first=Matthew|title=Detroit's Broken Buses Vex a Broke City: Bankruptcy Means Cold Waits, Hot Tempers for Residents in Need of a Ride|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303546204579439283523949194|accessdate=24 April 2014|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an environmental justice perspective this is significant because a lack of automobile access, coupled with poor transit and historic decentralization, perpetuates what is often referred to as a [[spatial mismatch]]. While wealth and jobs are on the outskirts of the metropolitan region, disadvantaged communities are concentrated in the inner-city, physically far from employment without a means of getting there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stoll|first=Michael|title=Job Sprawl and the Spatial Mismatch between Blacks and Jobs|journal=The Brookings Institution – Survey Series|date=February 2005|pages=1–8|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, almost 62% of workers are employed outside the city limit, and many depend on public transit.&lt;ref name=Dolan2014/&gt; Some contend that for Detroit this situation should more specifically be termed a "modal mismatch" because the poor of the inner-city are disadvantaged because they lack automobile access in a region designed for automobiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grengs|first=Joe|title=Job accessibility and the modal mismatch in Detroit|journal=Journal of Transport Geography|year=2010|volume=10|pages=42–54|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222172865_Job_accessibility_and_the_modal_mismatch_in_Detroit|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of name, the situation is little different and still embedded in historic racial and environmental injustices; the poor are clustered in an inner-city from past policies, which were often racially discriminatory, and cuts to public transportation reduce job accessibility for the many households in Detroit that lack automobile access.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16080">The  Story Factory is a not-for-profit organisation designed to help indigenous and disadvantaged children aged between 7 and 17 years develop their writing and storytelling skills. The programs run by the Story Factory aim to help young people, particularly those most at risk of losing confidence and then losing interest in schooling. The Story Factory conducts programs at it two creative writing centres, as short and long term residencies at primary and secondary schools, and as one off visits.

The Story Factory began in 2012 as the Sydney Story Factory in [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]], in inner city [[Sydney]]. The organisation changed its name to The Story Factory at the opening of their second site in [[Parramatta|Paramatta]] to the west of Sydney in October 2018.

[[file:SF redfern workshop.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Redfern Creative Writing Centre]]&lt;br&gt;

== Beginnings ==
In 2010 the co-founders of the Story Factory, Catherine Keenan and Tim Dick, heard [[Dave Eggers]] give a [[TED (conference)|TED talk]] about [[826 Valencia]] and were inspired to set up something similar in Sydney. They  flew to San Francisco and visited 826 Valencia to learn as much as they could about its model. Unlike 826 Valencia, The Story Factory does not provide homework help, but focuses on Creative writing.&lt;ref name=medibank&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medibank.com.au/livebetter/be-magazine/wellbeing/sydney-story-factory-2/|title=Sydney Story Factory {{!}} Live Better|work=Live Better|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dusseldorp.org.au/partner/sydney-story-factory-3/#|title=Sydney Story Factory - Dusseldorp Forum|work=Dusseldorp Forum|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a not-for-profit organisation that relies on volunteers and donations for support it took approximately 18 months to get the first site of The Story Factory operational. The initial volunteers meeting drew a crowd of 200 people.&lt;ref name=medibank/&gt;

Since it opened in 2012 approximately 16,000 students have participated in the programs.&lt;ref name=abcopening&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-20/story-factory-creative-writing-program-expands-to-parramatta/10393478|title='They've got stories in their head': Creative writing program expands to western Sydney|date=2018-10-20|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 they had 1050 active volunteer writing tutors and see approximately 800 children per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.storyfactory.org.au/|title=Home|website=Sydney Story Factory|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy and Operation ==
The Story Factory focuses on creative writing rather than the homework help provided in the original [[826 Valencia]] program. This philosophy is based on discussion with local teachers who said that there is much less space for creativity in the Australian curriculum now.&lt;ref name=medibank/&gt;

The [[University of Sydney]] conducted an evaluation of the student involvement in the Story Factory from 2014 to 2016. The study was looking at the development of writing skills, self-confidence, engagement in learning and enthusiasm for creative writing. The study used case study methodology and also pre- and post-program surveys. A total of 88 students were surveyed and from these 10 were the subject of detailed case studies. The evaluation showed that students felt positive about the program and believed it helped with school work. It showed the students gained empowerment and grew in self-knowledge and self-awareness. Students who participated in several workshops grew their creative writing skills often to a higher level than would be expected of their grade or stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aare.edu.au/publications-database.php/9509/creativity-and-creative-writing-the-sydney-story-factory-experience|title=Creativity and creative writing: The sydney story factory experience  ·  Australian Association for Research in Education - article abstract|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aare.edu.au|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315687593_Sydney_Story_Factory_Workshop_Program_Evaluation_Summary|title=(PDF) Sydney Story Factory: Workshop Program Evaluation Summary|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teaching Writing in Today's Classrooms: Looking Back to Look Forward|last=Ewing|first=R|last2=Manuel|first2=J|last3=Mortimer|first3=A|date=2015|publisher=Norwood, South Australia:Australian Literacy Educators' Association|year=|isbn=978-0-977-5468-5-5|editor-last=Turbill|editor-first=Jan|location=|pages=107-122|chapter=Chapter 8: Imaginative children's literature, educational drama and creative writing|editor-last2=Barton|editor-first2=Georgina|editor-last3=Brock|editor-first3=Cynthia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An evaluation of the in-schools residency programs run by the factory found a "notable shift in writing confidence and enjoyment" in all five schools involved and this was particularly strong among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/552da8bae4b07cc792521ef3/t/5aa72b6d53450af0dcfacd2b/1520905074968/Mid-way+report+Crown+Residency+Program+Feb+2018+%281%29.pdf|title=Evaluation of Creative Writing In-School Residency Programs; 2017 Primary School Mid-point findings|last=Wilson|first=Pete|last2=Fisher|first2=Natalie|publisher=NSF Consulting|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Former board member of The Story Factory, Professor Robyn Ewing,  believes that "education is possibly the most critical factor in alleviating disadvantage, and the Story Factory strives to change the lives of young people, especially those from marginalised backgrounds, through creative writing and storytelling."&lt;ref name="SydUni"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2016/09/26/story-factory-tells-a-strong-tale.html|title=Story Factory tells a strong tale|website=The University of Sydney|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Story Factory is supported by a variety of people. This includes 3 former [[Australian Prime Ministers]]: [[Julia Gillard]] and [[Tony Abbott|Tony Abbot]] who appeared is a video for the Story Factory in 2011&lt;ref name=prime_ministers&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/how-a-10yearold-boy-got-the-pm-and-mr-abbott-together-20111014-1lp7z.html|title=How a 10-year-old boy got the PM and Mr Abbott together|last=Molitorisz|first=Sacha|date=2011-10-14|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Malcolm Turnbull|Malcolm Turnbul]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l through the Turnbull Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.storyfactory.org.au/partners/|title=Partners|website=Sydney Story Factory|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also conducted four art auctions in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/cover-versions-a-tribute-to-strong-stories-20111129-1o51d.html|title=Cover versions a tribute to strong stories|date=2011-11-29|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/city-east/redfern-story-factory-launches-childrens-book-comp/news-story/6f49a72085869ad70bb2d1bae506daa6?sv=37ad829d285f99c843df063659f81f1b|title=Redfern Story Factory launches childrens' book comp|last=|first=|date=6 November 2018|website=www.dailytelegraph.com.au|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whatson.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/events/fine-lines|title=Fine Lines {{!}} What's On - City of Sydney|website=What's On - City of Sydney|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The auctions have received donations from six [[Archibald Prize]] winners: Kathryn Del Barton, [[Fiona Lowry]], [[Nigel Milsom]], Mitch Cairns, [[Euan Macleod]] and [[Wendy Sharpe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.32auctions.com/organizations/33983/auctions/41070?t=all|title=If you can tell a story.....|website=32auctions|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.32auctions.com/finelines|title=Fine Lines|website=32auctions|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.32auctions.com/ssf|title=Sydney Story Factory - Judge a Book Buy its Cover|website=32auctions|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;n 2017 the auction also included 2016 Archilbald Prize finalist, Abdul Abdullah, and another 45 artists.&lt;ref name= sbs&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/sydney-story-factory-multicultural-heartland-set-to-benefit-from-writing-group|title=Sydney Story Factory: Multicultural heartland set to benefit from writing group|work=SBS News|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Story Spaces ==

=== Redfern ===  
[[file:SF redfern exterior.jpg|thumb|200px|Martian Embassy, Redfern]]
The Story Factory, opened first in 2012 in Redfern. The Story Factory is accessed through the Martian Embassy. The idea is a spinoff from 826 Valencia that has a Pirate Supply Shop as its front.&lt;ref name=prime_ministers/&gt; Keenan stated that the kids and the volunteers loved the design and the staff liked the idea of going to another world. The Martian Embassy is the retail arm of the  Story Factory and sells Martian growing kits, alien bacteria fighters and cans of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://martianembassy.com.au/|title=Gift Shop for Sydney Story Factory|website=martianembassy.com.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=timeout&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeout.com/sydney/things-to-do/sydney-story-factory|title=Sydney Story Factory {{!}} Things to do in Redfern, Sydney|work=Time Out Sydney|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shop then opens into the creative space.

'''Thai numerals''' ({{lang-th|เลขไทย}}, {{RTGS|''lek thai''}}, {{IPA-th|lêːk tʰāj|pron}}) are a set of numerals traditionally used in Thailand, although the [[Arabic numerals]] are more common due to pervasive [[westernization]] of Thailand in the modern [[Rattanakosin|Rattanakosin Era]]. Thai numerals follow the [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]] commonly used in the rest of the world. In Thai language, numerals often follow the modified noun and precede a measure word, although variations to this pattern occur.

==Usage==
The [[Thai language#Nouns|Thai language]] lacks [[grammatical number]]. A [[counting|count]] is usually expressed in the form of an [[inflection|uninflected]] noun followed by a number and a classifier.  "Five teachers" is expressed as "teacher five person" {{lang|th-Latn|khru ha khon}} ({{lang-th|ครูห้าคน}} or with the numeral included {{lang-th|ครู ๕ คน}}.) {{lang|th-Latn|Khon}} "person" is a type of [[referent]] noun that is also used as the Thai [[part of speech]] called in English a [[Classifier (linguistics)|linguistic classifier]], or [[measure word]]. In Thai, counting is ''kannap'' ({{lang|th|การนับ}}, [[literal translation|lit.]] 'occasion of respect'); the classifier, ''laksananam'' ({{lang|th|ลักษณนาม}}  from ''laksana'' characteristic, form, attribute, quality, pattern, style; and ''nam'' name, designation, appellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thai-language.com/id/207260|title= ลักษณนาม

|accessdate=  May 21, 2013|quote= [grammar] a classifier, a numerative noun}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Variations to this pattern do occur, and there really is no [[Hierarchical classifier|hierarchy]] among Thai classifiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Paper/4812546 Constructing Taxonomy of Numerative Classifiers for Asian Languages]&lt;/ref&gt;
A partial list of Thai words that also classify nouns can be found in Wiktionary category:  [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Thai_classifiers Thai classifiers].

==Main numbers==

===Zero to ten===
Thai [[wikt:ศูนย์|sūn]] is written as oval [[0 (number)]] when using Arabic numerals, but a small circle {{lang|th|๐}} when using traditional numerals, and also means ''[[wikt:centre|centre]]'' in other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english-thai-dictionary.com/index.php?cx=partner-pub-8360351822208958%3Azew6y8qyzco&amp;cof=FORID%3A10&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%E0%B8%A8%E0%B8%B9%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%8C&amp;sa=Dictionary-search&amp;fields%5B%5D=related&amp;siteurl=english-thai-dictionary.com%2F#911 English-Thai reverse lookup and synonyms]&lt;/ref&gt; It is from [[Sanskrit]] ''[[śūnya]]'', as are the (context-driven) [[#Alternate numbers|alternate names for numbers]] one to four given below; but not the counting [[1 (number)]]. 

Thai names for ''N'' +1 and the regular digits 2 through 9 as shown in the table, below, resemble those in [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] (e.g., [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] and [[Min Nan]]) as spoken in [[Southern China]], the homeland of the overseas chinese living in South East Asia . In fact, the etymology of Thai numerals 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 is [[Middle Chinese]], while the etymology of Thai numeral 5 is [[Old Chinese]], as illustrated in the table below&lt;ref name="suthiwan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Suthiwan|first=Titima|author2=Uri Tadmor |title=Loanwords in the World's Languages: A Comparative Handbook|editor=Martin Haspelmath|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|date=2009|pages=606|isbn=9783110218442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Numerical digit]] characters, however, are almost identical to [[Khmer numerals]]. Thai and Lao words for numerals are almost identical, however, the numerical digits vary somewhat in shape. Shown above is a comparison between three languages using [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]] and [[Southern Min|Minnan]] [[Hanzi|characters]] and pronunciations. Shown below is a comparison between three languages using [[Khmer numerals]]. Thai and Lao. The Thai [[transliteration]] uses the [[Royal Thai General System of Transcription]] (RTGS).

===Ten to a million===
Sanskrit [[lakh]] designates the [[Positional notation|place value]] of a digit (''tamnaeng khong tua lek'', ตําแหน่งของตัวเลข), which are named for the powers of ten: the unit's place is ''lak nuai'' (หลักหน่วย); ten's place, ''lak sip'' (หลักสิบ); hundred's place, ''lak roi'' (หลักร้อย), and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rirs3.royin.go.th/dictionary.asp Online Royal Institute Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303000030/http://rirs3.royin.go.th/dictionary.asp |date=2009-03-03 }}, 1999 edition: select "ห" and enter หลัก&lt;/ref&gt;  The number one following any multiple of ''sip'' becomes ''et'' (Cantonese: 一, yat&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; Minnan: 一, it&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;). The number ten (''sip'') is the same as Minnan 十 (sip&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;, lit.). Numbers from twenty to twenty nine begin with ''yi sip'' (Cantonese: 二十, yi&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;sap&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;; Minnan: 二十, lit. ji&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;sip&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;). Names of the ''lak sip'' for 30 to 90, and for the ''lak'' of 100, 1000, 10,000, 100,000 and million, are almost identical to those of the like [[Khmer numerals]].

For the numbers twenty-one through twenty-nine, the part signifying twenty: ''yi sip'' (ยี่สิบ), may be colloquially [[Contraction (grammar)|shortened]] to ''yip'' (ยีบ, ยิบ). See the alternate numbers section below.

The hundreds are formed by combining ''roi'' with the tens and ones values. For example, two hundred and thirty-two is ''song roi sam sip song''. The words ''roi'', ''phan'', ''muen'', and ''saen'' should occur with a preceding numeral (''nueng'' is optional), so two hundred ten, for example, is ''song roi sip'', and one hundred is either ''roi'' or ''nueng roi''. ''Nueng'' never precedes ''sip'', so ''song roi nueng sip'' is incorrect. Native speakers will sometimes use ''roi nueng'' (or ''phan nueng'', etc.) with different tones on ''nueng'' to distinguish one hundred from one hundred and one. However, such distinction is often not made, and ambiguity may follow. To resolve this problem, if the number 101 (or 1001, 10001, etc.) is intended, one should say ''roi et'' (or ''phan et'', ''muen et'', etc.).

===Numbers above a million===
Numbers above a million are constructed by prefixing ''lan'' with a multiplier. For example, ten million is ''sip lan'', and a trillion (10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;, a long scale [[billion]]) is ''lan lan''.

===Decimal and fractional numbers===
Colloquially, decimal numbers are formed by saying ''chut'' (จุด, dot) where the [[decimal mark|decimal separator]] is located. For example, 1.01 is ''nueng chut sun nueng'' (หนึ่งจุดศูนย์หนึ่ง).

[[Fraction (mathematics)|Fractional numbers]] are formed by placing ''nai'' (ใน, in, of) between the numerator and denominator or using ''[set] x suan y'' ([เศษ] x ส่วน y, x parts of the whole y) to clearly indicate. For example, {{1/3}} is ''nueng nai sam'' (หนึ่งในสาม) or ''[set] nueng suan sam'' ([เศษ]หนึ่งส่วนสาม). The word ''set'' (เศษ) can be omitted.

The word ''khrueng'' (ครึ่ง) is used for "half". It precedes the measure word if used alone, but it follows the measure word when used with another number. For example, ''kradat khrueng phaen'' (กระดาษครึ่งแผ่น) means "half sheet of paper", but ''kradat nueng phaen khrueng'' (กระดาษหนึ่งแผ่นครึ่ง) means "one and a half sheets of paper".

===Negative numbers===
Negative numbers are formed by placing ''lop'' (ลบ, minus) in front of the number. For example, −11 is ''lop sip et'' (ลบสิบเอ็ด).

===Ordinal numbers===
[[ordinal number (linguistics)|Ordinal number]]s are formed by placing ''thi'' (ที่, place) in front of the number. They are not considered a special class of numbers, since the numeral still follows a modified noun, which is ''thi'' in this case.

'''Visual literacy''' is the ability to [[Interpreting|interpret]], negotiate, and make meaning from information presented in the form of an [[image]], extending the meaning of [[literacy]], which commonly signifies interpretation of a written or printed [[Written language|text]].  Visual literacy is based on the idea that [[pictures]] can be "read" and that meaning can be through a process of reading.

==Historical Background==
The notion of visual literacy has been around for quite some time.  Classical and Medieval theories of memory and learning, for instance, placed a strong emphases on how the visual format of words and lines affected the ordering of information in the mind.  During the Enlightenment new emphasis was placed on training the senses through print and manuscript technologies in a way that benefitted the rising middle class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Shape of Knowledge: Children and the Visual Culture of Literacy and Numeracy|journal=Science in Context|year=2013|volume=26|pages=215–245|url=https://www.academia.edu/1817033/The_Shape_of_Knowledge_Children_and_the_Visual_Culture_of_Literacy_and_Numeracy_Science_in_Context_26_2013_215-245|doi=10.1017/s0269889713000045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Mathew Daniel|title=The Child Writer: Graphic Literacy and the Scottish Educational System, 1700–1820|journal=History of Education|date=2016|volume=45|pages=695–718|url=https://www.academia.edu/23569976/The_Child_Writer_Graphic_Literacy_and_the_Scottish_Educational_System_1700_1820_History_of_Education_45_2016_695-718}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to learning to read visual material like tables and figures, many schoolchildren learned how to write and draw in graphic patterns that made their notes more accessible and easier to access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Nature of Notebooks: How Enlightenment Schoolchildren Transformed the Tabula Rasa|journal=Journal of British Studies|date=2018|volume=57|page=275-307|url=https://www.academia.edu/34448924/The_Nature_of_Notebooks_How_Enlightenment_Schoolchildren_Transformed_the_Tabula_Rasa_Journal_of_British_Studies_57_2018_275-307}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the nineteenth century visual literacy was a core component of the national educations systems that were emerging in Europe and North America, with educational reformers like Sir John Lubbock arguing for visual tools like diagrams and models to be used in the classroom.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Modern Visual Literacy==
The term "visual literacy" is credited to John Debes, co-founder of the [[International Visual Literacy Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031204235851/http://ivla.org/org_what_vis_lit.htm What is visual literacy?], [http://www.ivla.org/ International Visual Literacy Association]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969 Debes offered a tentative definition of the concept: "Visual literacy refers to a group of vision-competencies a human being can develop by seeing and at the same time having and integrating other sensory experiences."&lt;ref&gt;Avgerinou, M. &amp; Ericson, J. (1997). "[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119145211/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 A review of the concept of visual literacy]", ''British Journal of Educational Technology'', 28(4), 280-291.&lt;/ref&gt;  A white paper drawn up in January 2004, defines visual literacy as "understanding how people perceive objects, interpret what they see, and what they learn from them".&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James 2010. The concept of visual literacy, and its limitations, In: Visual Literacy, ed. James Elkins.  Routledge, New York. pgs 217.&lt;/ref&gt; However, because multiple disciplines such as [[visual literacy in education]], [[art history]] and [[criticism]], [[rhetoric]], [[semiotics]], [[philosophy]], [[information design]], and [[graphic design]] make use of the term visual literacy, arriving at a common definition of visual literacy has been contested since its first appearance in professional publications.

Since technological advances continue to develop at an unprecedented rate, educators are increasingly promoting the learning of visual literacies as indispensable to life in the [[Information Age|information age]].  Similar to [[Literacy|linguistic literacy]] ([[meaning-making]] derived from written or oral human language) commonly taught in schools, most educators would agree that literacy in the 21st Century has a wider scope.&lt;ref&gt;Riddle, J. (2009). ''Engaging the Eye Generation: Visual Literacy Strategies for the K-5 Classroom''. Stenhouse Publishers page 3.  {{ISBN|978-1-57110-749-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educators are recognizing the importance of helping students develop visual literacies in order to survive and communicate in a highly complex world.

[[File:Lascaux painting.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.7|Lascaux Cave painting]]

Many [[Academia|scholars]] from the New London Group&lt;ref name=NewLondon&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090708022433/http://www.informationhabitat.org/mw/index.php/The_New_London_School The New London School], Information Habitat wiki, [[Michigan State University]]&lt;/ref&gt; such as Courtney Cazden, [[James Paul Gee|James Gee]], [[Gunther Kress]], and [[Allan Luke]] advocate against the dichotomy of visual literacy versus linguistic literacy.  Instead, they stress the necessity of accepting the co-presence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kress|first =Gunther R.|authorlink=Gunther Kress|title=Literacy in the New Media Age |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-415-25356-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2vaNeafOoiYC&amp;dq=inauthor:Gunther+inauthor:Kress&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=0&amp;output=html&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  of linguistic literacies and visual literacies as interacting and interlacing modalities which complement one another in the meaning making process.

Visual literacy is not limited to modern [[mass media]] and new [[Technology|technologies]].  The graphic novel ''[[Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art|Understanding Comics]]'' by [[Scott McCloud]] discusses the history of narrative in visual media.  Also, animal drawings in ancient caves, such as the one in [[Lascaux]], [[France]], are early forms of visual literacy.  Hence, even though the name visual literacy itself as a label dates to the 1960s, the concept of reading signs and symbols is [[Prehistory|prehistoric]].

Visual literacy is the ability to evaluate, apply, or create conceptual visual representations. Skills include the evaluation of advantages and disadvantages of visual representations, to improve shortcomings, to use them to create and communicate knowledge, or to devise new ways of representing insights.  The didactic approach consists of rooting visualization in its application contexts, i.e. giving the necessary critical attitude, principles, tools and feedback to develop their own high-quality visualization formats for specific problems (problem-based learning). The commonalities of good visualization in diverse areas, and exploration of the specificities of visualization in the field of specialization (through real-life case studies).

Visual Literacy Standards for teaching in higher education were adopted by the [[Association of College &amp; Research Libraries]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/visualliteracy ACRL Visual Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education]&lt;/ref&gt; They were "developed over a period of 19 months, informed by current literature, shaped by input from multiple communities and organizations, reviewed by individuals from over 50 institutions, and approved by 3 ACRL committees and the ACRL Board of Directors".&lt;ref&gt;[http://acrlvislitstandards.wordpress.com/ ACRL Visual Literacy Standards&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

== Education ==
There are many different formats of visual literacy and also many different ways of teaching students how to interpret visual literacy. Questions to be asked when looking at visuals can be "What is going on in this photograph?" and "What comes to mind when you first look at this photograph?". This allows students to begin the analyzing process. When looking at visuals, students should be able to see, understand, think, create and communicate graphically. In order to do all, the student must always carefully observe.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Film director [[Martin Scorsese]] emphasizes how children should begin developing visual literacy skills at an early age. This involves exploring how ideas and emotions are expressed and the use of lighting to create an emotional or physiological point. He explains how there is a need for children to understand these concepts. Visual literacy is taught in many schools and is becoming a more popular subject throughout the years. With technology, images and visual presentations are flourishing more than ever.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7952">The word '''''womyn''''' is one of several [[alternative political spelling|alternative spellings]] of the [[English language|English]] word ''[[women]]'' used by some [[feminists]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Hatton. [http://eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/14/9c/da.pdf "Womyn and the 'L': A Study of the Relationship between Communication Apprehension, Gender, and Bulletin Boards"] &lt;sup&gt;([http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED397454&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED397454 abstract])&lt;/sup&gt;, ''[[Education Resources Information Center]]'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; There are other spellings, including '''''womban''''' (a reference to the [[womb]]) or '''''womon''''' (singular), and '''''wimmin''''' (plural). Some writers who use such alternative spellings, avoiding the [[suffix]] {{nobr|"-man"}} or {{nobr|"-men"}}, see them as an expression of female independence and a repudiation of traditions that define women by reference to [[male as norm|a male norm]].&lt;ref name="neeru"&gt;Neeru Tandon (2008). ''Feminism: A Paradigm Shift''&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, "womyn" and other spelling variants were associated with [[regional dialect]]s (e.g. [[Scottish English|Scots]]) and [[eye dialect]] (e.g. [[African American Vernacular English]]).

==Old English==
{{main|Woman#Etymology}}
[[Old English]] had a system of [[grammatical gender]], whereby every [[noun]] was treated as either masculine, feminine or neuter, similar to modern German. In Old English sources, the word ''man'' was neuter. One of its meanings was similar to the [[modern English]] usage of "[[One (pronoun)|one]]" as a gender-neutral [[indefinite pronoun]] (compare with ''mankind'' (''man''&amp;nbsp;+ ''kind''), which means the human race).&lt;ref&gt;In Latin similarly, there is "''homo''" or "''hominis''" then "''vir''" or "''viris''" and "''mulier''" or "''mulieris''"; respectively meaning "man" (gender-neutral) then "adult male" and "adult female".&lt;/ref&gt; The words ''wer'' and ''wyf'' were used, when necessary, to specify a man or woman, respectively. Combining them into ''wer-man'' or ''wyf-man'' expressed the concept of "any man" or "any woman".&lt;ref&gt;[[Dale Spender|Spender, Dale]]. ''Man-Made Language''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Casey, and Kate Swift. ''The Handbook of Non-Sexist Language''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some feminist writers have suggested that this more symmetrical usage reflected more egalitarian notions of gender at the time.&lt;ref name="neeru"/&gt;

==18th, 19th, and early 20th century uses==
The term ''wimmin'' was considered by [[George Philip Krapp|George P. Krapp]] (1872–1934), an American scholar of English, to be [[eye dialect]], the literary technique of using nonstandard spelling that implies a pronunciation of the given word that is actually standard. The spelling indicates that the character's speech overall is [[dialect]]al, foreign, or uneducated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Walpole|1974|pp=193, 195}}{{incomplete short citation|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rickford|Rickford|2000|p=23}}{{incomplete short citation|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of nonstandard spelling differs from others in that a difference in spelling does not indicate a difference in pronunciation of a word.  That is, it is dialect to the eye rather than to the ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://homepage.ntlworld.com/vivian.c/SpellingNovel/EyeDialect.htm |title= Eye Dialect by Vivian Cook |work= Homepage.ntlworld.com |date=  |accessdate= 2012-06-13 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121023154323/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/vivian.c/SpellingNovel/EyeDialect.htm |archivedate= 2012-10-23 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It suggests that a character "would use a vulgar pronunciation if there were one" and "is at the level of ignorance where one misspells in this fashion, hence mispronounces as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bolinger|1946|p=337}}{{incomplete short citation|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''womyn'' appeared as an [[Older Scots]] spelling of ''woman''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?dtext=dboth&amp;query=Woman DOST: Woman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511161408/http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?dtext=dboth&amp;query=Woman |date=2013-05-11 }}&lt;!--webarchive:0;archiveis:1@VDoKC--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Scots language|Scots]] poetry of [[James Hogg]]. The word ''wimmin'' appeared in 19th-century renderings of [[Black American English]], without any feminist significance.

==Current usage in the United States==
The usage of "womyn" as a feminist spelling of ''women'' (with ''womon'' as the singular form) first appeared in print in 1976 referring to the first [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;"Womyn". ''Oxford English Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; This is just after the founding of the [[Mountain Moving Coffeehouse for Womyn and Children]], a [[lesbian feminist]] social event centred around [[women's music]]. Both the annual "MichFest" and the weekly [[coffeehouse (event)|coffeehouse]] operated a [[womyn-born womyn]] policy.&lt;ref name="advocate1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Molloy|first=Parker Marie|title=Equality Michigan Petitions Michfest to End Exclusionary Policy|url=https://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2014/07/29/equality-michigan-petitions-michfest-end-exclusionary-policy|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|date=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Womyn's land]] was another usage of the term, associated with [[separatist feminism]].

[[Z. Budapest]] promoted the use of word ''wimmin'' (singular ''womon'') in the 1970s as part of her [[Dianic Wicca]] movement, which claims that present-day [[patriarchy]] represents a fall from a matriarchal [[golden age]].&lt;ref&gt;Eugene V. Gallagher, W. Michael Ashcraft (2006). ''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

These re-spellings existed alongside the use of [[herstory]], a feminist re-examination and re-telling of history. Later, another wave of female-produced music was known as the [[riot grrrl]] movement.

The word "womyn" has been criticized by [[Transgender rights movement|trans activists]]&lt;ref name="advocate1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What They Call "Womyn-Only" Space is Really Cisgender-Only Space|url=http://transadvocate.com/what-they-call-womyn-only-space-is-really-cisgender-only-space_n_6289.htm|publisher=The TransAdvocate|date=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its usage in [[Feminist views on transgender topics#Feminist exclusion of trans women|trans-exclusionary radical feminist]] circles which exclude [[trans women]] from identifying into the category of "woman" and consequently prevent them from accessing spaces and resources for women.&lt;ref name="advocate1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vasquez|first=Tina|title=It's Time to End the Long History of Feminism Failing Transgender Women|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/its-time-end-long-history-feminism-failing-transgender-women|publisher=[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]]|date=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current usage in the United Kingdom==
[[Millie Tant]], a fictional character in the British satirical comic ''[[Viz (comic)|Viz]]'', often used the term ''wimmin'' when discussing women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;Maconie, Stuart. ''Pies and Prejudice: In search of the North''. Edbuty, 2008. p. 132. {{ISBN|978-0-09-191023-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
