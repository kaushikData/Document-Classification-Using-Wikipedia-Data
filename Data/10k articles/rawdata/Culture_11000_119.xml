The {{nihongo|'''100 Landscapes of Japan'''|日本百景}} is a list of famous scenic sites in [[Japan]]. The 100 Landscapes or Views were selected alongside further sets of 8 Views and 25 Winning Sites in 1927, a year after [[Hirohito]] became [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]]. The selection was intended to "reflect the [[Taste (sociology)|new taste]] of the [[Shōwa period|new era]]". The nomination and voting process was sponsored by the [[Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun]] and [[Mainichi Shimbun#History|Osaka Mainichi Shimbun]].&lt;ref name="EM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/nature/ari_kata/shiryou/031208-4-3.pdf |title=日本八景(昭和2年)の選定内容 |publisher=[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] |accessdate=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landscapes or views are divided into eight classes (1) Coastlines (2) Lakes (3) Mountains (4) Rivers (5) Gorges (6) Waterfalls (7) Onsen (8) Plains. Many of these landscapes are now included among Japan's [[List of national parks of Japan|National Parks]].&lt;ref name="EM"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4320">'''Aesthetic distance''' refers to the gap between a viewer's conscious reality and the fictional reality presented in a work of art.  When a reader becomes fully engrossed in the illusory narrative world of a book, the author has achieved a close aesthetic distance.  If the author then jars the reader from the reality of the story, essentially reminding the reader they are reading a book, the author is said to have "violated the aesthetic distance." &lt;ref&gt;[http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/lit_term.html Literary terms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aesthetic+distance Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept originates from [[Immanuel_Kant|Immanuel Kant's]] [[Critique of Judgement]], where he establishes the notion of ''disinterested delight'' which does not depend on the subject's having a desire for the object itself, he writes, "delight in beautiful art does not, in the pure judgement of taste, involve an immediate interest. [...] it is not the object that is of immediate interest, but rather the inherent character of the beauty qualifying it for such a partnership-a character, therefore, that belongs to the very essence of beauty."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel (1790). 'Critique of Pure Judgement.' trans. Meredith, James Creed. Blacksburg: Virginia Tech. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term aesthetic distance itself derives from an article by Edward Bullough published in 1912. In that article, he begins with the image of a passenger on a ship observing fog at sea. If the passenger thinks of the fog in terms of danger to the ship, the experience is not aesthetic, but to regard the beautiful scene in detached wonder is to take legitimate aesthetic attitude. One must feel, but not too much. Bullough writes, "Distance … is obtained by separating the object and its appeal from one's own self, by putting it out of gear with practical needs and ends. Thereby the 'contemplation' of the object becomes alone possible."&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, Edward (1912/1989). '"Psychical Distance" as a Factor in Art and as an Aesthetic Principle.' Dickie, G., Sclafani, R., Roblin, R. ''Aesthetics: A Critical Anthology.'' 2nd ed. New York: St. Martin's. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors of film, fiction, drama, and poetry evoke different levels of aesthetic distance.  For instance, [[William Faulkner]] tends to invoke a close aesthetic distance by using [[first-person narrative]] and [[Stream_of_consciousness_(narrative_mode)|stream of consciousness]], while [[Ernest Hemingway]] tends to invoke a greater aesthetic distance from the reader through use of [[Narrative_mode#Third-person_view|third person narrative]].

==Violating the aesthetic distance==

Anything that pulls a viewer out of the reality of a work of fiction is said to be a violation of aesthetic distance.  An easy example in theater or film is "breaking the fourth wall," when characters suspend the progress of the story to speak directly to the audience.  When the aesthetic distance is deliberately violated in theater, it is known as the [[distancing effect]], or ''Verfremdungseffekt'', a concept coined by playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]].

Many examples of violating the aesthetic distance may also be found in [[meta-fiction]].  [[William Goldman]], in ''[[The Princess Bride]]'', repeatedly interrupts his own fairy tale to speak directly to the reader. In the musical, ''[[Stop the World I Want to Get Off]]'', the [[protagonist]], ''Littlechap'', periodically stops the progress of the play to address the audience directly.

In film, the aesthetic distance is often violated unintentionally.  Examples might include a director's cameo, poor special effects, or perhaps blatant [[product placement]] - any can be enough to pull a viewer out of the reality of the film.  [[David Mamet]] in ''[[On Directing Film]]'' asserts that any direct depiction of graphic sex or violence in film is an inherent violation of aesthetic distance, as audience members will instinctively make judgments as to whether or not what they just saw was real, and thus be pulled out of the story-telling.

'''''Angel of the Resurrection''''' is a massive [[stained glass]] window by the American [[Art Nouveau]] glass manufacturer [[Tiffany Studios]], now in the collection of the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]. It was commissioned by former-[[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] Mary Lord Harrison as a memorial to her husband, President [[Benjamin Harrison]]. Completed in 1904, the window depicts the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] calling for the dead to rise at the [[Second Coming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Solga |first=Kim |title=Louis Tiffany Angel of the Resurrection - 1904 |url=http://www.kidsart.com/IS/429.html |publisher=KidsArt |accessdate=27 November 2012 |year=1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312103956/http://www.kidsart.com/IS/429.html |archivedate=12 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Although his trumpet often leads to the assumption that the angel here is [[Gabriel]], he is in fact Michael, using the trumpet to signal the dead to rise again.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dressed in [[chainmail]] like a crusading knight from the books of [[Sir Walter Scott]], Michael cuts a dashing figure in keeping with the era's romanticism. Although [[Louis Comfort Tiffany|Tiffany]] was absorbed in numerous other projects at the time, he gave his team of gifted designers input before bestowing his approval upon the final composition. Several of his brilliant innovations in glass manufacturing are visible in this piece, including the swirling opalescence of his trademark mottled glass, drapery glass in Michael's robes, and the ruffling on the wings to resemble feathers. The assembly was equally innovative, with lead not merely holding the glass in place but defining the image and creating linear effects. Furthermore, his layering of glass creates dazzling depths and color effects. "Awake Thou That Sleepest. Arise from the Dead and Christ Shall Give Thee Light" from Ephesians 5:14 is inscribed on the window.&lt;ref name=ima/&gt;

==Historical information==
''Angel of the Resurrection'' was commissioned in 1901 for the First Meridian Heights Presbyterian Church in Indianapolis, by Mary Lord Harrison in memory of her husband, President [[Benjamin Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glorious Color|url=http://speedwaydailyphoto.blogspot.com/2012/04/glorious-color.html|publisher=Speedway Daily Photo|accessdate=27 November 2012|date=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church had particular importance for Harrison, who had been a church [[Presbyterian polity#Elder|elder]] for over forty years.&lt;ref name=day&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Holliday T.|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art Collections Handbook|year=1988|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|isbn=0936260203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total cost, including installation and external glass protection, was $1500.&lt;ref name=harrison/&gt;

{{Anti-nuclear movement sidebar}}

The '''anti-nuclear movement in Germany''' has a long history dating back to the early 1970s when large demonstrations prevented the construction of a [[nuclear plant]] at [[Wyhl]]. The Wyhl protests were an example of a local community challenging the nuclear industry through a strategy of direct action and civil disobedience. Police were accused of using unnecessarily violent means. [[Anti-nuclear]] success at Wyhl inspired nuclear opposition throughout [[Germany]], in other parts of [[Europe]], and in [[North America]]. A few years later protests raised against the [[NATO Double-Track Decision]] in Germany and were followed by the foundation of the [[Green party]].

In 1986, large parts of Germany were covered with [[radioactive contamination]] from the [[Chernobyl disaster]] and Germans went to great lengths to deal with the contamination. Germany's anti-nuclear stance was strengthened. From the mid-1990s onwards, anti-nuclear protests were primarily directed against transports of [[High-level radioactive waste management|radioactive waste]] in [[dry cask storage|"CASTOR" containers]].

In September 2010, German government policy shifted back toward nuclear energy, and this generated some new anti-nuclear sentiment in Berlin and beyond. On 18 September 2010, tens of thousands of Germans surrounded Chancellor Angela Merkel's office. In October 2010, tens of thousands of people protested in Munich. In November 2010, there were violent protests against a train carrying reprocessed nuclear waste.

Within days of the March 2011 [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], large anti-nuclear protests occurred in Germany. Chancellor Angela Merkel promptly "imposed a three-month moratorium on previously announced extensions for Germany's existing nuclear power plants, while shutting seven of the 17 reactors that had been operating since 1981". Protests continued and, on 29 May 2011, Merkel's government announced that it would close all of its nuclear power plants by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/14.abstract |title=The implications of Fukushima: The European perspective |author=Caroline Jorant |date=July 2011 |volume=67 |issue=4  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dw31511/&gt; Galvanised by the Fukushima nuclear disaster, first anniversary anti-nuclear demonstrations were held in Germany in March 2012. Organisers say more than 50,000 people in six regions took part.&lt;ref name="euronews.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euronews.com/2012/03/11/anti-nuclear-demos-across-europe-on-fukushima-anniversary/ |title=Anti-nuclear demos across Europe on Fukushima anniversary |author= |date=11 March 2011 |work=Euronews }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
German publications of the 1950s and 1960s contained criticism of some features of nuclear power including its safety. Nuclear waste disposal was widely recognized as a major problem, with concern publicly expressed as early as 1954. In 1964, one author went so far as to state "that the dangers and costs of the necessary final disposal of nuclear waste could possibly make it necessary to forego the development of nuclear energy".&lt;ref name=wolf&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s there was a proposal to build a nuclear power station in West Berlin, but the project was dropped in 1962. Another attempt to site a reactor in a major city was made in 1967, when BASF planned to build a nuclear power station on its ground at Ludwigshafen, to supply process steam. Eventually the project was withdrawn by BASF.&lt;ref name=wolf/&gt;

The tiny hamlet of Wyhl, located just outside the [[Kaiserstuhl (Baden-Württemberg)|Kaiserstuhl]] wine-growing area in the southwestern corner of Germany, was first mentioned in 1971 as a possible site for a [[nuclear power]] station. In the years that followed, local opposition steadily mounted, but this had little impact on politicians and planners. Official permission for the plant was granted and earthworks began on 17 February 1975.&lt;ref name=nuc&gt;Walter C Patterson (1986). [http://www.waltpatterson.org/nppenguin.pdf Nuclear Power] Penguin Books, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 February, local people spontaneously occupied the site and police removed them forcibly two days later.  Television coverage of police dragging away farmers and their wives through the mud helped to turn nuclear power into a major national issue.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The rough treatment was widely condemned and made the wine-growers, clergy, and others all the more determined. Some local police refused to take part in the action.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Falk]] (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent support came from the nearby university town of Freiburg.  On 23 February about 30,000 people re-occupied the Wyhl site and plans to remove them were abandoned by the state government in view of the large number involved and potential for more adverse publicity.  On 21 March 1975, an administrative court withdrew the construction licence for the plant.&lt;ref name=pub&gt;Mills, Stephen and Williams, Roger (1986).

''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, pp. 130-135.&lt;/ref&gt;  The plant was never built and the land eventually became a nature reserve.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;

The Wyhl occupation generated extensive national debate.  This initially centred on the state government's handling of the affair and associated police behaviour, but interest in nuclear issues was also stimulated.  The Wyhl experience encouraged the formation of citizen action groups near other planned nuclear sites.&lt;ref name=pub/&gt;&lt;ref name=wrudig/&gt; Many other anti-nuclear groups formed elsewhere, in support of these local struggles, and some existing citizens' action groups widened their aims to include the nuclear issue.  This is how the German anti-nuclear movement evolved.&lt;ref name=pub/&gt;&lt;ref name=wrudig/&gt;  Anti-nuclear success at Wyhl also inspired nuclear opposition in the rest of Europe and North America.&lt;ref name=nuc/&gt;&lt;ref name=got/&gt;&lt;ref name=wrudig/&gt;

==Other protests==
[[File:ANTIAKW.jpg|thumb|right|120,000 people attended an anti-nuclear protest in [[Bonn]], Germany, on 14 October 1979, following the [[Three Mile Island accident]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert P. Kitschelt.

]]
In 1976 and 1977, mass demonstrations took place at [[Kalkar]], the site of Germany's first [[fast breeder reactor]], and at [[Brokdorf]], north of Hamburg.&lt;ref name=pub/&gt; Some of these demonstrations, which always started peacefully, were organized by the [[World Union for Protection of Life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-40941633.html Report in the German magazine DER SPIEGEL 14/1977]&lt;/ref&gt; The circumstances at Brokdorf were similar to those at Wyhl, in that the behaviour of the police was again crucial:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The authorities had rushed through the licensing process, and police occupied the site hours before the first construction license was granted, in order to prevent a repetition of Wyhl.  Demonstrators trying to enter the site a few days later got harsh treatment, and all this helped consolidate the population in opposition.&lt;ref name=pub/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In February 1977 the [[Minister-President of Lower Saxony]], [[Ernst Albrecht (politician)|Ernst Albrecht]] of the Christian Democratic Union, announced that the salt mines in [[Gorleben]] would be utilised to store [[radioactive waste]]. New protests by the local population and opponents of nuclear power broke out and approximately 20,000 people attended the first large demonstration in Gorleben on 12 March 1977. Protests about Gorleben continued for several years&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2001/jun2001/grns-j26.shtml The German Greens and the nuclear industry]&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1979, the prime minister declared that plans for a nuclear waste plant in Gorleben were “impossible to enforce for political reasons".&lt;ref name=thomas&gt;Lutz Mez, [[Mycle Schneider]] and [[Stephen Thomas (professor)|Steve Thomas]] (Eds.) (2009). ''International Perspectives of Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power'', Multi-Science Publishing Co. Ltd, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 an Enquete Commission of the Bundestag proposed "a paradigmatic
change in energy policy away from nuclear power". This contributed to a broad shift in German public opinion, the formation of the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]], and its election to the [[German Bundestag]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=MST/&gt;

In the early 1980s plans to build a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in the Bavarian town of [[Nuclear reprocessing plant Wackersdorf|Wackersdorf]] lead to major protests. In 1986, West German police were confronted by demonstrators armed with slingshots, crowbars and [[Molotov cocktail]]s at the site of a nuclear reprocessing plant in [[Wackersdorf]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961509-2,00.html Energy and Now, the Political Fallout], ''Time'', June 2, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/09/world/around-the-world-germans-arrest-300-in-antinuclear-protests.html Germans Arrest 300 In Antinuclear Protests]&lt;/ref&gt; The plans for the plant were abandoned in 1988. It still isn't clear whether protests or plant economics led to the decision.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;

In 1981, Germany's largest anti-nuclear demonstration took place to protest against the construction of the [[Brokdorf Nuclear Power Plant]] on the North Sea coast west of Hamburg. Some 100,000 people came face to face with 10,000 police officers. Twenty-one policemen were injured by demonstrators armed with gasoline bombs, sticks, stones and high-powered slingshots.&lt;ref name="chron"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0F16FA3F5D0C728CDDAA0894D9484D81 West Germans Clash at Site of A-Plant] ''New York Times'', March 1, 1981 p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/01/world/violence-mars-west-german-nuclear-protest-demonstrators-brokdorf-near-hamburg.html Violence Mars West German Protest] ''New York Times'', March 1, 1981 p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The plant began operations in October 1986 and is scheduled to close in 2018.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;

==Chernobyl disaster==
The [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986 was a pivotal event for Germany's anti-nuclear movement. After the radioactive fallout cloud covered large parts of the country, Germans went to great lengths to deal with the contamination.  Contaminated crops were destroyed, firemen dressed in protective gear cleaned cars as they crossed the border from other countries, and sand in playground sandboxes was replaced.&lt;ref&gt;Hanneke Brooymans. France, Germany: A tale of two nuclear nations, ''The Edmonton Journal'', May 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Chernobyl, the Green Party strived "for the immediate shut-down of all nuclear facilities". The SPD pushed for a nuclear phase-out within ten years. Länder governments, municipalities, parties and trade unions explored the question of "whether the use of nuclear power technology was reasonable and sensible for the future".&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;

In May 1986 clashes between anti-nuclear protesters and West German police became common. More than 400 people were injured in mid-May at the site of a nuclear-waste reprocessing plant being built near Wackersdorf. Police "used water cannons and dropped tear-gas grenades from helicopters to subdue protesters armed with slingshots, crowbars and Molotov cocktails".&lt;ref&gt;John Greenwald. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961509-2,00.html#ixzz0ceyKaRdI Energy and Now, the Political Fallout], ''TIME'', June 2, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

==More recent developments==
[[File:Gorleben0001.JPG|thumb|Riots at anti-nuclear demonstrations near Gorleben, Lower Saxony, Germany, 8 May 1996.]]

Several advanced reactor designs in Germany were unsuccessful. Two [[fast breeder reactor]]s were built, but both were closed in 1991 without the
larger ever having achieved criticality. The High Temperature Reactor [[THTR-300]] at Hamm-Uentrop, under construction since 1970, was started in 1983, but was shut down in September 1989.&lt;ref name=MST&gt;Lutz Mez, Mycle Schneider and Steve Thomas (Eds.) (2009). ''International Perspectives of Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power'', Multi-Science Publishing Co. Ltd, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-nuclear protests were also a driving force of the green movement in Germany, from which the party The Greens evolved. When they first came to power in the [[Gerhard Schröder|Schröder administration]] of 1998 they achieved their major political goal for which they had fought for 20 years: [[Nuclear power in Germany#Phase-out|abandoning nuclear energy in Germany]].

From the mid-1990s onwards, anti-nuclear protests were primarily directed against transports of [[High-level radioactive waste management|radioactive waste]] called "castor" containers. In 1996 there were sit-ins against the second castor consignment bringing nuclear waste from La Hague in France to Gorleben. In 1997 the third castor transport reached Gorleben despite the efforts of several thousand protesters.&lt;ref name=so/&gt;

In 2002, the "Act on the structured phase-out of the utilization of nuclear energy for the commercial generation of electricity" took effect, following a drawn-out political debate and lengthy negotiations with nuclear power plant operators. The act legislated for the shut-down of all German nuclear plants by 2021. The [[Stade Nuclear Power Plant]] was the first one to go offline in November 2003, followed by the [[Obrigheim Nuclear Power Plant]] in 2005. Block-A of the [[Biblis Nuclear Power Plant]] is still provisionally scheduled to be shut down in 2008.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UIC. [http://www.uic.com.au/nip46.htm Nuclear power in Germany].&lt;/ref&gt; Block-B is going back online after a year-long shutdown on 13 or 14 December 2007{{When|date=December 2017}}{{Update inline|date=December 2017}} and is scheduled to keep operating until 2009 or 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters. [https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssIndustryMaterialsUtilitiesNews/idUSL3087639620071130 UPDATE 1-Germany's RWE says Biblis B reactor is restarting].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, amid concerns that Russian energy supplies to western Europe may not be reliable, conservative politicians, including Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] and Economics Minister [[Michael Glos]], continued to question the decision to phase out nuclear power in Germany.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt; [[World Information Service on Energy|WISE]] along with other anti-nuclear movement groups contend that the climate problem can only be solved by the use of [[renewable energy commercialization|renewable forms of energy]] along with [[Efficient energy use|efficient and economical energy technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facts-on-nuclear-energy.info/6_climate_race.php?size=s&amp;l=en&amp;f= Nuclear Power Cannot Save the Climate]&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2008, a cover of the German magazine [[Der Spiegel]] read ''Atomkraft - Das unheimliche Comeback ''(Nuclear Power - Its eerie comeback). As a consequence the Germans anti-nuclear organisation ''[[:de:.ausgestrahlt|.ausgestrahlt]]'' decided to coordinate the various anti-nuclear movements on their website leading to a more powerful protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ausgestrahlt.de/ueber-uns.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316215557/http://www.ausgestrahlt.de/ueber-uns.html |archivedate=2011-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-nuclear Monday evening walks become popular in various German cities.

In November 2008, a shipment of radioactive waste from German nuclear plants arrived at a storage site near Gorleben after being delayed by large protests from nuclear activists. More than 15,000 people took part in the protests which involved blocking trucks with sit-down demonstrations and blocking the route with tractors. The demonstrations were partly a response to conservative calls for a rethink of the planned phaseout of nuclear power stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,589782,00.html Nuclear Waste Reaches German Storage Site Amid Fierce Protests]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.theage.com.au/world/police-break-up-german-nuclear-protest-20081111-5lw7.html Police break up German nuclear protest]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,589456,00.html The Renaissance of the Anti-Nuclear Movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, activists blocked the entrance to controversial [[Neckarwestheim Nuclear Power Plant]] with an 8-metre wall. Their protest coincided with the annual meeting of the company that runs the plant, [[EnBW Energie Baden-Württemberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.de/national/20090423-18823.html Protestors block nuclear power plant entrance]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in April 2009 about 1,000 people demonstrated against nuclear power generation in the north-western city of Münster. Located southwest of Hamburg, Münster is surrounded by a nuclear waste dump at Ahaus, Germany's only uranium enrichment plant at Gronau and another such plant at Almelo in neighbouring Holland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sydney.indymedia.org.au/story/1-000-demonstrated-against-nuclear-power-german-student-town 1,000 demonstrated against nuclear power in German student town] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429232230/http://sydney.indymedia.org.au/story/1-000-demonstrated-against-nuclear-power-german-student-town |date=April 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 April 2010, about 120,000 people built a human chain (''KETTENreAKTION!'') between the nuclear plants [[Krümmel Nuclear Power Plant|Krümmel]] and [[Brunsbüttel Nuclear Power Plant|Brunsbüttel]]. This way they were demonstrating against the plans of the German government to extend the period of producing nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE63N13Q20100424|title=German nuclear protesters form 75-mile human chain|work=Reuters|date=2010-04-25|accessdate=2010-04-25| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100427092449/http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE63N13Q20100424| archivedate= 27 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations were also held in other German cities "where public opinion is mainly opposed to nuclear energy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/germans-form-chain-in-nuclear-protest-20100425-tktv.html Germans form chain in nuclear protest] ''Sydney Morning Herald'', April 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, German government policy shifted back toward nuclear energy, and this generated some new anti-nuclear sentiment in Berlin and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;James Norman and Dave Sweeney.

In November 2010, police wielding batons clashed with protesters who disrupted the passage of a train carrying reprocessed nuclear waste from France to Germany. The train carrying the nuclear waste was heading for Dannenberg where the 123 tonnes of waste was loaded onto trucks and taken to the nearby storage facility of Gorleben, in central Germany. Tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Dannenberg to signal their opposition to the cargo. Organisers said 50,000 people had turned out but police said the figure was closer to 20,000. Around 16,000 police were mobilised to deal with the protests.&lt;ref&gt;Rachael Brown.

In March 2011, more than 200,000 people took part in anti-nuclear protests in four large German cities, on the eve of state elections. Organisers called it the biggest anti-nuclear demonstration the country has seen, with police estimating that 100,000 people turned out in Berlin alone. Hamburg, Munich and Cologne also saw big demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/03/26/germany-nuclear-idUKLDE72P0FG20110326 |title=Anti-nuclear Germans protest on eve of state vote |date=March 26, 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Times'' reported that "most Germans have a deep-seated aversion to nuclear power, and the damage at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan has galvanized opposition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/28/world/europe/28germany.html?_r=1  |title=Merkel Loses Key German State on Nuclear Fears |author=Judy Dempsey |date=March 27, 2011  |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Germans demanding an end to the use of nuclear power took part in nationwide demonstrations on 2 April 2011. About 7,000 people took part in anti-nuclear protests in Bremen. About 3,000 people protested outside of [[RWE]]'s headquarters in Essen. Other smaller rallies were held elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9MBL8981.htm |title=Thousands of Germans protest against nuclear power |date=April 2, 2011 |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508123412/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9MBL8981.htm |archivedate=2011-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition announced on 30 May 2011, that Germany’s 17 nuclear power stations will be shut down by 2022, in a policy reversal following Japan's [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]]. Seven of the German power stations were closed temporarily in March, and they will remain off-line and be permanently decommissioned. An eighth was already off line, and will stay so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/30/us-germany-nuclear-idUKTRE74Q2P120110530 |title=German government wants nuclear exit by 2022 at latest |author=Annika Breidthardt |date=May 30, 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2011 and 2014 Germany burned more coal, an additional 9.5 million tonnes of oil equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/pdf/Energy-economics/statistical-review-2015/bp-statistical-review-of-world-energy-2015-coal-section.pdf pg5&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, thousands of anti-nuclear protesters delayed a train carrying radioactive waste from France to Germany. Many clashes and obstructions made the journey the slowest one since the annual shipments of radioactive waste began in 1995. The shipment, the first since Japan's Fukishima nuclear disaster, faced large protests in France where activists damaged the train tracks.&lt;ref name=spieg11/&gt; Thousands of people in Germany also interrupted the train's journey, forcing it to proceed at a snail's pace, covering 1,200 kilometers (746 miles) in 109 hours. More than 200 people were reported injured in the protests and several arrests were made.&lt;ref name=spieg11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,800319,00.html |title=Thousands of Protesters Obstruct Nuclear Waste Transport |author= |date=2011-11-28 |work=Spiegel Online }}&lt;/ref&gt; Galvanised by the Fukushima nuclear disaster, first anniversary anti-nuclear demonstrations were held in Germany in March 2012. Organisers say more than 50,000 people in six regions took part.&lt;ref name="euronews.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8060">'''''Seyyid'' Battal Ghazi''' is a mythical [[Islam|Muslim]] [[Turkish people|Turkish]], [[saint]]ly figure and warrior based in [[Anatolia]] (associated primarily with [[Malatya]], where his father, Hüseyin Gazi, was the ruler &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web.uni-frankfurt.de/irenik/relkultur69.htm | title = Beliefs and traditions in the shrine of Hüseyin Gazi|author=Hüseyin Türk|publisher=Journal of Religious Culture, [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main]] | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), based on the real-life exploits of the 8th-century [[Umayyad]] military leader [[Abdallah al-Battal]]. His attributed legends, which also form the bulk of the information available on the historic personality, later became an important part in [[Turkish folk literature]].

His title [[Sayyid|Seyyid]], as well as being an [[Arabic]] [[honorific]], may refer, in the form "Seyyid", to family ties to [[Muhammad]]. The title of "Seyyid" or "Sayyid", and it is said that Battal Ghazi was an [[sunni]] Muslim.

==The legends==
Sources available on the historical personality of [[Abdallah al-Battal]] consist of legends often written in the [[Masnavi (poetic form)|mesnevi]] style, and which may comport historically correct elements or points that support each other, as well as contradictions. For example, he is cited as having participated in his twenties to the [[Second Arab Siege of Constantinople]] in 718, and the legends name his [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] enemy as ''Leon'', which could be no other than [[Leo III the Isaurian]], the [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Emperor]] during the siege. On the basis of this information, his date of birth is reckoned to be around 690-695 and there is a consensus among historians for accepting 740 as the year of his death, at the [[Battle of Akroinon]]. On the other hand, in one story Battal Gazi raids the [[Maiden's Tower, Istanbul|Maiden's Tower]] and rides away from [[Üsküdar]], on the city's Asian side, with the Emperor's treasures and daughter, an event that is not confirmed by any historical record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://culturecityistanbul.blogspot.com/2017/05/kiz-kulesi-lighthouse.html |title=KIZ KULESİ LIGHTHOUSE |date=May 1, 2017 |accessdate=2017-12-30}} Whence the Turkish expression, "Atı alan Üsküdar'ı geçti"; (''He who takes the horse is already past [[Üsküdar]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Battal Gazi was revindicated as an ancestor of [[Danishmend Gazi]] in the romanced epic on the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[Bey]], ''Danishmendnâme'', in which stories relating to the two figures are blended, possibly with a view to stress the presence of Islam in Anatolia even before the main Turkish advance following the [[Battle of Manzikert]] (modern [[Malazgirt]]). The verses that compose Danishmendnâme were compiled from Turkish folk literature for a first time by order of the [[Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate|Anatolian Seljuk Sultan]] [[Kayqubad I|Alâeddin Keykubad]], a century after Danishmend's death, and the final form that reached our day is a [[compendium]] that was put together under the instructions of the early 15th century [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan [[Murad II]].

Battal Gazi remains a spirited figure in Turkey's modern day [[urban culture]]. This is partly due to a series of films in which Battal Gazi was incarnated by and immortalised anew under the chiselled features of the Turkish [[film star]] [[Cüneyt Arkın]]. These modern references sometimes involve touches of indirect humour.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube| id=xGpLwXoyh-w| title=Battal Gazi kahpe uzaylılara karşı (''Battal Gazi versus perfidious space aliens'')}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The tombs==
Battal Gazi is buried in [[Seyitgazi]], a town named after him and where he is believed to have been martyred (possibly during a siege of the nearby [[Amorium]]), in [[Eskişehir Province]], [[Turkey]]. Upon the initiative as of 1207 of Ümmühan Hatun, wife of the [[Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate|Anatolian Seljuk Sultan]] [[Kaykhusraw I|Gıyaseddin Keyhüsrev I]] and mother of [[Kayqubad I|Alâeddin Keykubad I]], Battal Gazi's tomb was extended into a [[Seyyid Battal Gazi Complex|complex]] containing a [[mosque]], a [[medrese]], cells and ceremonial rooms for [[dervish]]es as well as charitable services for the community such as kitchens and a bakery, and it was later renovated extensively under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan [[Bayezid II]]'s reign. As such, Seyyid Battal Gazi Complex in Seyitgazi remains a much visited [[shrine]].

On the other hand, many other localities across Turkey also put forth claims as burial places either for Battal Gazi, or for his father Hüseyin Gazi. A tomb in [[Divriği]] and another one in [[Ankara]] on top of a hill named after Hüseyin Gazi are the most famous among the shrines thought to contain the father's remains.

The district centre of [[Battalgazi]] in Turkey's [[Malatya Province]], formerly [[Eskimalatya]] (''Old Malatya'') and the previous location of [[Malatya]] city, at a distance of 20&amp;nbsp;km from the modern day urban centre, was renamed in honour of Battal Gazi. Battal Gazi's wife and two children are buried in the town.

[[File:Jakob Jordaens 016.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Jacob Jordaens]], ''The Bean King''. Oil on canvas, ca. 1640- 1645.]]

A '''bean-feast''' was an informal term for a celebratory meal or party, especially an annual summer dinner given by an employer to his or her employees, probably derived from a tradition in the [[Low Countries]] at [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Bean-Feast |volume=3 |page=573}}&lt;/ref&gt; By extension, colloquially, it describes any festive occasion with a meal and perhaps an outing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/beanfeast From Merriam Webster Unabridged Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; The word, and its shorter form "beano," are fairly common in Britain, less known in the United States. An alternative derivation refers the name to the eating of a dish of beans and bacon, and seems to trace to 1725, when Daniel Day of [[Wapping]], London began to entertain friends near his estate at [[Fairlop]] in [[Essex]] on the first Friday in July.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qlJEAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA146 ''Beauties of England and Wales''], Volume 10, Issue 3, Part 1, By Britton, pub. T. Maiden, 1815&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the beanfeast often took the form of a trip to some beauty spot, where the meal was provided. (e.g. ..''I want a feast, I want a bean feast. Cream buns and doughnuts and fruitcake with no nuts, so good you could go nuts. '' - Veruca Salt, [[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]])

It is derived from the [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]] feast, at which a [[king cake]] or pie with a special object or "favour" buried in it was a great feature. This remains a common custom in much of Europe and former European colonies; in the US mainly in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tI0eemYCDFgC&amp;pg=PA48 ''Mardi Gras, Gumbo, and Zydeco: Readings in Louisiana Culture''], eds Marcia G. Gaudet, James C. McDonald, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  Elsewhere the favour took various forms, including metal tokens and small pottery figures.  In the Low Countries a bean was usual.  The '''bean king''' for the rest of the night was the person who had the slice of cake containing the bean.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;  The king (or queen) was given a paper crown to wear, and appointed various court officials.  When the king took a drink, all the party shouted "the king drinks". The subject was often painted by [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painters]], especially [[Jacob Jordaens]] and [[Jan Steen]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/digital-collection/01.+Paintings/48341/?lng= Hermitage Museum]; [https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-feast-of-the-bean-king/MwEBgGg74T1f2g]; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hTBv607RId8C&amp;pg=PT45 ''Beans: A History''], Ken Albala, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:BellyDancerMarrakech.jpg|thumb|A common bedlah costume]]

The '''bedlah''' is an [[Arab]]ian costume normally worn by women. The word bedlah is [[Arabic]] for "[[suit (clothing)|suit]]".

In the world of [[belly dance]] the term bedlah refers simply to the costume that a dancer wears. Most commonly it is used to refer to the matched set of bra and belt that cabaret dancers use, but technically it encompasses all parts of the dancer's costume as well, such as the jewelry, headband, skirt, pants and veil.  This is often referred to as a ''Complete Bedlah''. Occasionally it also refers to just one piece of the costume such as the highly ornate belt that tribal dancers wear which may or may not have a matching bra. The term ''Bedlah hardwear'' refers to the more sturdy portions of the dancer's costume, the bra, belt and jewelry and the term ''Bedlah softwear'' includes the flowing fabric portions of the costume, the skirt, pants, vest, choli and/or veil. Bedlah originated in the Western imagination of Victorian painters and was adopted by dancers who catered to foreign audiences who expected the look. Many dancers also adopted the look simply because they liked it, and it has survived to become the most popular costume for oriental dancers across the globe.

[[File:Cerveza Escudo.jpg|thumb|beer in Chile]]
The primary [[beer]] brewed and consumed in [[Chile]] is [[pale lager]], though the country also has a tradition of brewing corn beer, known as [[chicha]]. Chile’s beer history has a strong [[beer in Germany|German influence]] – some of the bigger beer producers are from the country’s southern [[Chilean lake district|lake district]], a region populated by a great number of [[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|German immigrants during the 19th century]]. Chile also produces English ale-style craft beers while also developing its own craft beer identity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130819153931/http://www.beerandbrewer.com/_blog/Magazine/post/Craft_Beer_in_Chile/#sthash.r5TDaM0L.dpuf Craft Beer in Chile] www.beerandbrewer.com retrieved August 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There is long tradition of brewing a drink called [[chicha]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3942507.stm ''Ancient Peru's ritual beer binges],'' BBC, July 31, 2004, sec. Americas. Retrieved 31 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; that might be classified as corn beer by modern standards, though is not considered as such in South America. Chicha was originally brewed with corn, influenced by the Andean cultures of northern Chile and Peru, but during colonial times apple and grape chicha started to be brewed across the country as a cheaper alternative to wine. There were at least four major alcoholic drinks during colonial times in Chile: [[wine]], [[pisco]]-[[aguardiente]], apple chicha and grape chicha.

Modern beer (Spanish, ''cerveza chilena'') history in [[Chile]] began in the 19th century when European [[beer]] was first introduced in the years after Chile gained [[Chilean War of Independence|independence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/historia/v37n2/art02.pdf La cerveza en Chile en el sigrlo XIX]&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|arrival of German immigrants]] around 1850, massive beer production began. By the end of the 19th century, beer was consumed all over the country. Beer consumption and culture then spread across the country from cities with high immigrant populations such as [[Valdivia, Chile|Valdivia]] and [[Valparaíso]]. In 1907, 20 million litres of beer were produced in Valdivia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mingaonline.uach.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0718-64281998000200006&amp;lng=es&amp;nrm=iso Investigación aplicada sobre Geografía Urbana: Un caso práctico en la ciudad de Valdivia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025010536/http://mingaonline.uach.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0718-64281998000200006&amp;lng=es&amp;nrm=iso |date=2014-10-25 }} Víctor Figueroa, Jorge Gayoso, Edgardo Oyarzun, Lenia Planas[[Gestion Turistica]], [[UACh]].&lt;/ref&gt; By 1997, Chilean beer consumption reached 28 liters per year per capita.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euroamericacorredores.cl/bases/phpCEHoNm.pdf]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 2013 this had increased to 40 litres per year per capita.

==Economy==
[[Pisco]], [[Chilean Wine|wine]] and [[rum]] are popular alcoholic drinks in Chile but there has been a slow increase in the sales of [[lager]], [[pale ale]] from local microbreweries and imported [[pale lager]]. Although Chilean beer consumption is low compared to the rest of the South American region, beer is still the most consumed alcoholic beverage and takes 60% of the total market share for alcoholic drinks. Premium beers alone hold an 18% share of the total market, the highest share seen among the countries of the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economiaynegocios.cl/noticias/noticias.asp?id=109436 Chile lidera consumo per cápita de cervezas premium] Economía y Negocios, Constanza Rodríguez, June 05, 2013 retrieved August 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Cía Cervecerías Unidas SA, a local company, is the leading Chilean beer company, producing mainly lager beers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euromonitor.com/Alcoholic_Drinks_in_Chile euromonitor.com] Retrieved 31 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Plastic comb, 2015-06-07.jpg|thumb|A modern plastic comb]]

A '''comb''' is a tool consisting of a shaft, usually wider than it is long, that holds a row of teeth for pulling through  the [[hair]] to clean, untangle, or style it.  Combs have been used since [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] times, having been discovered in very refined forms from settlements dating back to 5,000 years ago in [[Iran|Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0IIOAAAAQAAJ|title=Nineveh and Persepolis: An Historical Sketch of Ancient Assyria and Persia, with an Account of the Recent Researches in Those Countries|last=Vaux|first=William Sandys Wright|date=1850-01-01|publisher=A.

==Description==
[[File:Local artisan cutting and filing animal horn to make combs.webm|thumb|Local artisan cutting and filing animal horn to make combs in [[Alappuzha]], [[Kerala]]]]

Combs consist of a shaft and teeth that are placed at a perpendicular angle to the shaft.  Combs can be made out of a number of materials, most commonly [[plastic]], metal or [[wood]]. Combs made from [[ivory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4DaHyIC3DeEC|title = Archaeology and Environment in the Scoresby Sund Fjord|last = Sandell|first = Hanne Tuborg|last2 = Sandell|first2 = Birger|date = 1991-01-01|publisher = Museum Tusculanum Press|isbn = 9788763512084|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tortoiseshell&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=-rHmq8CXIMwC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=comb+tortoise&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3o4Gkta_LAhWkxIMKHdopBhcQ6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=comb%2520tortoise&amp;f=false|title = American Artifacts of Personal Adornment, 1680-1820: A Guide to Identification and Interpretation|last = White|first = Carolyn L.|date = 2005-01-01|publisher = Rowman Altamira|isbn = 9780759105898|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; were once common but concerns for the animals that produce them have reduced their usage.  When made from wood, combs are largely made of [[boxwood (genus)|boxwood]], cherry wood or other fine-grained wood. Good quality wooden combs are usually handmade and polished.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9Z6vCGbf66YC|title = Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History|last = Sherrow|first = Victoria|date = 2006-01-01|publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn = 9780313331459|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combs come in various [[shapes]] and sizes depending on what they are used for. A hairdressing comb may have a thin, tapered handle for parting hair and close teeth. Common hair combs usually have wider teeth halfway and finer teeth for the rest of the comb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AcDmHwcv4jMC|title = The Archaeology of Celtic Britain and Ireland: C.AD 400 - 1200|last = Laing|first = Lloyd Robert|date = 2006-06-29|publisher = Cambridge University Press|isbn = 9780521838627|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hot combs were used solely for straightening hair during the colonial era in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IFKNL65TwcEC|title = Interpreting Archaeology: Finding Meaning in the Past|last = Hodder|first = Ian|date = 1997-01-01|publisher = Psychology Press|isbn = 9780415157445|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[hairbrush]] comes in both manual and electric models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YygDAAAAMBAJ|title = Popular Science|last = Corporation|first = Bonnier|date = 1937-09-01|publisher = Bonnier Corporation|page = 39|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is larger than a comb, and is also commonly used for shaping, styling and cleaning hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ve9NAAAAYAAJ|title = The Toilet and Cosmetic Arts in Ancient and Modern Times|last = Cooley|first = Arnold James|date = 1866-01-01|publisher = R.

== Uses and types ==
[[File:Schurig Woman combing her hair.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Woman combing her hair'' by [[Felix Schurig]], 1870]]

Combs can be used for many purposes. Historically, their main purpose was securing long hair in place, decorating the hair, matting sections of hair for [[dreadlocks]], or keeping a [[kippah]] or skullcap in place. In Spain, a ''[[Peineta (comb)|peineta]]'' is a large decorative comb used to keep a [[mantilla]] in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UxxwAwAAQBAJ|title = A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the Spanish Language with Families of Words based on Indo-European Roots: Volume II (H - Z and Appendix)|last = Roberts|first = Edward A.|date = 2014-04-10|publisher = Xlibris Corporation|isbn = 9781493191116|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In industry and craft, combs are used in separating cotton fibres from seeds and other debris (the [[cotton gin]], a mechanized version of the comb, is one of the machines that ushered in the [[Industrial Revolution]]). A comb is used to distribute colors in [[paper marbling]] to make the swirling colour patterns in comb-marbled paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kY92BMFNFjUC|title = Marbled Paper: Its History, Techniques, and Patterns : with Special Reference to the Relationship of Marbling to Bookbinding in Europe and the Western World|last = Wolfe|first = Richard J.|date = 1990-01-01|publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn = 0812281888|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combs are also a favorite tool for [[police]] investigators to collect hair and dandruff samples that can be used in ascertaining dead or living persons' identities, as well as their state of health, toxicological profiles, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZY0AAAAIAAJ|title = Practical Instruction in Police Work and Detective Science: A Course of Instruction ...

===Making music===
Stringing a plant's leaf or a piece of paper over one side of the comb and humming with cropped lips on the opposite side dramatically increases the high-frequency harmonic content of the hum produced by the human voice box, and the resulting spread sound spectrum can be modulated by changing the resonating frequency of the oral cavity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fVrIoX5kQt8C|title = The Everything Lawn Care Book: From Seed to Soil, Mowing to Fertilizing--hundreds of Tips for Growing a Beautiful Lawn|last = Green|first = Douglas|date = 2001-01-01|publisher = Adams Media|isbn = 1580624871|page = 23|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the inspiration for the [[kazoo]], a [[membranophone]].  Moreover, the comb is also a [[lamellophone]]. Comb teeth have [[harmonic]] qualities of their own, determined by their shape, length, and material. A comb with teeth of unequal length, capable of producing different notes when picked, eventually evolved into the [[thumb piano]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4CeFAC5MdxwC|title = The Cambridge History of American Music|last = Nicholls|first = David|date = 1998-11-19|publisher = Cambridge University Press|isbn = 9780521454292|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[musical box]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ckw5AQAAIAAJ|title = Cylinder musical box technology: including makers, types, dating, and music|last = Bulleid|first = Henry Anthony Vaughan|date = 1994-09-25|publisher = Almar Press|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afro pick===
[[File:Handmade African 'Afro' Combs.png|thumb|Afro picks]]
This type of comb has loose, thick teeth and is usually used on kinky or [[Afro-textured hair]]. It is longer and thinner than the typical comb, and it is sometimes worn in the hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GDoVCwAAQBAJ|title = Fashion Fads Through American History: Fitting Clothes into Context: Fitting Clothes into Context|last = Moore|first = Jennifer Grayer|date = 2015-12-14|publisher = ABC-CLIO|isbn = 9781610699020|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xFsDAAAAMBAJ|title = Jet|last = Company|first = Johnson Publishing|date = 1972-02-17|publisher = Johnson Publishing Company|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afro picks were common in many melanesian and polynesian societies but were usually an adornment and worn on ceremonial occasions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.new-guinea-tribal-arts.com/tribal-comb/|title=Tribal Comb {{!}} Tribal hair Comb {{!}} Pacific Island Tribal Comb|date=2018-04-17|work=new guinea tribal arts|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Nit comb===
[[File:HMB Läusekamm Jungsteinzeit.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Stone Age]] [[Head louse|nit]] comb]]
Specialized combs such as "[[flea]] combs" or "[[head louse|nit]] combs" can be used to remove [[macroscopic]] [[parasite]]s and cause them damage by combing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=8-lJ0tQazlcC&amp;pg=PT33&amp;dq=nit+comb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFwviWsq_LAhUCmoMKHRyLBLkQ6AEINDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=nit%2520comb&amp;f=false|title = The Lice-Buster Book: What to Do When Your Child Comes Home with Head Lice|last = Copeland|first = Lennie|date = 2001-10-01|publisher = Grand Central Publishing|isbn = 9780759526297|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comb with teeth fine enough to remove nits is sometimes called a "fine-toothed comb", as in the [[metaphor]]ic usage "go over [something] with a fine-toothed comb", meaning  to search closely and in detail. Sometimes in this meaning, "fine-toothed comb" has been reanalysed as "fine toothcomb" and then shortened to "toothcomb", or changed into forms such as "the finest of toothcombs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wsu.edu/~brians/errors/toothcomb.html |title=WSU.edu |publisher=WSU.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Morewitz, H.|date=2008|title=A Brief History of Lice Combs|url=http://nuvoforheadlice.com/lice_combs.htm |website=Nuvoforheadlice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hygiene===
Sharing combs is a common cause of [[parasite|parasitic]] infections much like sharing a hat, as one user can leave a comb with eggs or live parasites, facilitating the transmission of [[Louse|lice]], [[flea]]s, [[mite]]s, [[fungi]], and other undesirables. Siblings are also more likely to pass on nits to each other if they share a comb, so it is advisable to buy each child their own comb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Y5Y_sA6A83wC|title = All You Wanted To Know About Hair Care|last = Sinha|first = Meenakshi|last2 = Rajgopal|first2 = Reena|last3 = Banerjee|first3 = Suchismita|date = 2012-06-01|publisher = Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd|isbn = 9788120791022|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unbreakable plastic comb===

An unbreakable plastic comb is a comb that, despite being made of plastic rather than (more expensive) metal, does not shatter into multiple pieces if dropped on a hard surface such as bathroom tiles, a hardwood floor, or pavement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yO3HbKLNx5EC|title = A Likely Story|last = Adams|first = Glenn Arthur|date = 2000-06-09|publisher = iUniverse|isbn = 9780595004294|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such combs were introduced in the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=-2UhAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=unbreakable+plastic+comb&amp;dq=unbreakable+plastic+comb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl8IPtsq_LAhWrm4MKHSENA-wQ6AEIQzAF|title = Home Affairs Survey|last = Division|first = Great Britain Central Office of Information Reference|date = 1951-01-01|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today most plastic combs are unbreakable as technology has reached a point of understanding the causation of brittleness in these products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RJWiilJLdxYC|title = Characterization and Failure Analysis of Plastics|last = International|first = A. S. M.|last2 = Lampman|first2 = Steve|date = 2003-01-01|publisher = ASM International|isbn = 9781615030736|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern artisan combs ===
Modern artisan combs crafted from a wide variety of new and recycled materials have become popular over recent years. Used skateboard decks, vinyl records,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/tame-your-hipster-beard-with-a-comb-made-from-what/|title=Tame your hipster beard with a comb made from what?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[brass]], titanium alloy, acrylic and exotic wood are a few of the materials being used.

'''Guinea-Bissauan cuisine''' is the food culture of [[Guinea-Bissau]], a nation on [[Africa]]'s west coast along the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Rice is a staple in the diet of residents near the coast and millet a staple in the interior. Much of the rice is imported and food insecurity is a problem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfp.org/countries/guinea-bissau|title=Guinea - World Food Programme|website=Wfp.org|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in large part due to [[coup]]s, corruption and inflation.&lt;ref name=irin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/96106/guinea-bissau-falling-cashew-exports-raise-hardship|title=Falling cashew exports raise hardship|date=15 August 2012|website=Irinnews.org|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cashew]]s are grown for export.

Fish, shellfish, fruits and vegetables are commonly eaten along with [[cereal grain]]s, milk, [[curd]] and [[whey]]. The Portuguese encouraged [[peanut]] production. [[Vigna subterranea]] (Bambara groundnut) and [[Macrotyloma geocarpum]] (Hausa groundnut) are also grown. [[Black-eyed pea]]s are also part of the diet. [[Palm oil]] is harvested.

Common dishes include [[soup]]s and [[stew]]s. Common ingredients include [[yam (vegetable)|yam]]s, [[sweet potato]], [[cassava]], onion, tomato and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]. Spices, peppers and chilis are used in cooking, including [[Aframomum melegueta]] seeds (Guinea pepper).

==Celebrations==
September 12 is [[Amilcar Cabral]]'s birthday, a celebration that includes the eating of [[yassa]], chicken prepared with [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]], [[citrus]] and onion. Other holidays and festivals include Carnival in February, Colonization Martyr's Day on August 3, Readjustment Movement Day in November, Independence Day on September 24th, Mocidade Day on December 1 and New Year Day.

Family ceremonies to mark birth, [[circumcision]], marriage, and death are celebrated with [[palm wine]] or [[rum]]. [[Animal sacrifice]] is also performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Ge-It/Guinea-Bissau.html|title=Culture of Guinea-Bissau - history, people, women, beliefs, food, customs, family, social, marriage|website=Everyculture.com|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lands of Afghanistan have a long history of [[art]], with the world's earliest known usage of [[oil painting]] found in cave murals in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=First-ever oil paintings found in Afghanistan |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/04/24/afghanistan.painting/ |date=April 24, 2008 |accessdate=2012-12-03 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World's Oldest Oil Paintings Found in Afghanistan |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352342,00.html |date=April 24, 2008 |accessdate=2012-12-03 |publisher=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable art style that developed in Afghanistan and eastern Pakistan is [[Gandhara Art|Gandhara art]], produced by a fusion of [[Greco-Roman]] art and [[Buddhist art]] between the 1st and 7th centuries CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Gandhara-art |title=Gandhara art |publisher=Britannica |access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later eras saw increased use of the [[Persian miniature]] style, with [[Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād|Kamaleddin Behzad]] of [[Herat]] being one of the most notable miniature artists of the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] and early [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] periods. Since the 1900s, the nation began to use Western techniques in art. [[Abdul Ghafoor Breshna]] was a prominent Afghan painter and sketch artist from Kabul during the 20th century.

Afghanistan's art was originally almost entirely done by men, but recently women are entering the arts programs at [[Kabul University]]. Art is largely centered at the National Museum of Afghanistan, the National Gallery of Afghanistan and the National Archives of Afghanistan in [[Kabul]]. There are a number of art schools in the country. The Center for Contemporary Arts Afghanistan (CCAA) in Kabul provides young people to learn contemporary paintings.

Traditionally, only women have been involved in theater acting. Recently, in theater arts, women have begun to take center stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1126/p01s04-almp.html The Christian Science Monitor: Risky revival of Afghan theater puts women center stage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other known forms of art in the country are [[Music of Afghanistan|music]], [[Poetry of Afghanistan|poetry]], and several [[Sport in Afghanistan|sports]]. The art of making [[carpets]] has been prominent for centuries. Afghanistan is known for making beautiful oriental rugs. The [[Afghan carpet]] has certain prints that make them unique to Afghanistan.

Since the 1980s, the nation has witnessed several wars so music has been suppressed and recording for outsiders minimal. During the 1990s, the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban government]] banned instrumental music and much public music-making. Many musicians and singers continued to play their trade in the cities of other countries. Pakistani cities such as [[Peshawar]], [[Karachi]] and [[Islamabad]] are important centers for the distribution of Afghan music. Kabul has long been the regional cultural capital, but outsiders have tended to focus on the cities of [[Herat]] and [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] with its ''[[Qataghan Province|Qataghani]]'' style. [[Lyrics]] across the country are typically in both [[Dari-Persian]] and [[Pashto]]. [[Hindi]] songs from [[Bollywood]] films are also very popular in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Hindi Songs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2005/05/09/stories/2005050900561400.htm |title=It's Bollywood all the way in Afghanistan |publisher=The Hindu |accessdate=2007-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016053105/http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2005/05/09/stories/2005050900561400.htm |archive-date=2009-10-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Afghan musicians.jpg|thumb|Afghan men performing at the new Afghan Cultural Center on [[Camp Leatherneck]] in [[Helmand Province]].]]

Afghans enjoy music by playing many types of instruments. They also enjoy performing the [[Attan]], which is considered the national dance of Afghanistan. What is typically heard in the country are folk songs or [[ballads]]. Many of the songs are known by almost everyone and have been around for many years. The main traditional Afghan music instruments include:

* Mini [[Pump organ|Harmonium]]
* [[Santur]]
* [[Chang (instrument)|Chang]] - like a harmonica
* [[Rubab (instrument)|Rubab]] - 6 stringed instrument
* [[Tabla]] - Small drums
* [[Sitar]]
* [[Zurna]]
* [[Flute]]
* [[Dayereh]]
* [[Tanbur]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afghanistan-culture.com/afghanistan-music.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poetry ==
{{Main|Poetry of Afghanistan}}
[[Poetry of Afghanistan|Poetry in Afghanistan]] has long been a cultural tradition and passion. It is mainly in Persian/Dari and Pashto languages, although in modern times it is also becoming more recognized in Afghanistan's other languages. Classic [[Persian literature|Persian]] and [[Pashto literature and poetry|Pashto poetry]] plays an important role in the Afghan culture. Poetry has always been one of the major educational pillars in the region, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture. Some notable poets include [[Khushal Khan Khattak]], [[Rahman Baba]], [[Massoud Nawabi]], [[Nazo Tokhi]], [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], and [[Ghulam Muhammad Tarzi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afghan-web.com/culture/poetry/cpoets.html Classical Dari and Pashto Poets]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the famous [[List of Persian poets and authors|Persian poets and authors]] from the 10th to 15th centuries are [[Rumi]], [[Rabi'a Balkhi]], [[Khwaja Abdullah Ansari]], [[Jami]], [[Alisher Navoi]], [[Sanai]], [[Abu Mansur Daqiqi]], [[Farrukhi Sistani]], [[Unsuri]], and [[Anvari]]. Contemporary Persian language poets and writers include [[Khalilullah Khalili]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afghanmagazine.com/arts/khalili/khalili.html Afghanmagazine.com – Ustad Khalilullah Khalili – 1997].&lt;/ref&gt; and Sufi Ashqari.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afghanmagazine.com/jan2000/music/kharaabat/ Afghanmagazine.com – Kharaabat – by Yousef Kohzad – 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Afghan proverbs ==
Afghans universally prize wit and cleverness in speech.  They use [[proverb]]s in their daily conversations far more often than Westerners do, and with far greater effect. An appropriate Afghan proverb inserted at the right time can carry the weight of an entire explanation or discussion. An [[Afghan proverbs|Afghan proverb]] used well, especially by a foreigner, leads most Afghans either to laugh in genuine surprise and delight, or to nod thoughtfully while considering its full meaning and nuance.

"Zarbul Masalha" (pronounced zar-bull mah-sal-HAA) means "Proverbs" in [[Dari (Persian dialect)|Dari]], and these ''zarbul masalha'' deeply reflect Afghan culture.  Although often humble in origin, Afghan proverbs can rival the great words of famous philosophers and writers throughout world history in their richness, meaning and color. A good Dari [[proverb]], properly used, can match the wisdom of Confucius, the depth of Zen Koan, the whimsy of Lewis Carroll, the homespun words of Mark Twain, and the lyricism of Shakespeare - all in one short, meaningful phrase.

Above all, the proper use of Afghan proverbs demonstrates respect and understanding of Afghan culture at a very high level. Their use can lead to deeper personal connections that in turn help bridge very different religions, ethnicities, customs and traditions. Regardless of their many differences, people all over the world share many common feelings, opinions and hopes. Afghan proverbs highlight these similarities, and show our common humanity. U.S. Navy Captain [[Edward Zellem]] pioneered the use of Afghan proverbs as a positive relationship-building tool during the war in Afghanistan, and in 2012 he published two bilingual collections of Afghan proverbs in Dari and English.&lt;ref&gt;Zellem, Edward. 2012. {{cite web|url=http://www.afghanproverbs.com|title=Zarbul Masalha: 151 Afghan Dari Proverbs|publisher=Charleston: CreateSpace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zellem, Edward. 2012. {{cite web|url=http://www.afghanproverbs.com|title=Afghan Proverbs Illustrated|publisher=Charleston: CreateSpace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
[[File:View of Herat Citadel from atop the premises.jpg|thumb|[[Herat Citadel]] in the western Afghan city of [[Herat]]]]
The region has made major contributions to the world's [[architecture]]. [[UNESCO]] has acknowledged Afghanistan's role by declaring the [[Minaret of Jam]] and the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan|Valley of Bamiyan]], home of the famous [[Buddharupa|Buddhas]] destroyed by the [[Taliban]], [[World Heritage List|World Heritage Sites]].

Other examples of important contributions to architecture may be found in [[Herat]], [[Mazar-I-Sharif]], [[Ghazni]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://spach.info SPACH: Society for the Preservation of Afghanistan's Cultural Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kandahar]], and [[Chaghcharan|Firuzkoh]] in [[Ghor Province]].

== Cuisine ==
{{Main|Afghan cuisine}}
Afghanistan has a wide varying landscape allowing for many different crops. Afghan food is largely based upon cereals like [[wheat]], [[maize]], [[barley]] and [[rice]], which are the nation's chief crops. Fresh and dried fruits is the most important part of Afghan diet. Afghanistan is well known for its fine fruits, especially [[Pomegranate production in Afghanistan|pomegranates]], [[grapes]], and its extra-sweet jumbo-size [[melon]]s.

Cricket and football are the most popular sports in Afghanistan. The [[Afghanistan national cricket team]], which was formed in 2001, has held matches against all other international cricket teams. The Afghan team rapidly rose through the [[World Cricket League]] since early 2008. It participated in the [[2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier]], [[2010 ICC World Cricket League Division One]], and [[2010 ICC World Twenty20]] where they played India and South Africa. The team won four times in a row, the [[ACC Twenty20 Cup]] in 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013. It played against top ranking teams in the [[2012 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup]] and the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20]]. In the national level, cricket matches are played between provinces, mainly between the south and eastern provinces of the country. In the other sports, Afghans usually play with challengers of neighboring states and sometimes with other Asian countries.

The [[Afghanistan national football team]] was founded in 1922, joined [[FIFA]] in 1948 and the [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC) in 1954. Although it did not play in any international games from 1984 to 2003 due to the war, it is now striving and hoping to make it to FIFA. The [[Afghanistan women's national football team]] was formed in 2007. The [[Ghazi Stadium]], which was built during the reign of [[List of monarchs of Afghanistan|King]] [[Amanullah Khan]], was once used for a venue for public executions by the Taliban government. The stadium is currently used mostly for football matches between teams from different provinces of the country as well as neighboring countries. [[Basketball]] has existed in Afghanistan since at least the 1970s, and is slowly becoming popular again. It is played by both Afghan men and women. Additionally, Afghans in the north of the country enjoy the sport of [[buzkashi]].

Since the country has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world, the United States began establishing a number of Lincoln learning centers to help with this problem and promote American culture in Afghanistan. They are set up to serve as programming platforms offering English language classes, library facilities, programming venues, Internet connectivity, educational and other counseling services. A goal of the program is to reach at least 4,000 Afghan citizens per month per location.&lt;ref&gt;https://photos.state.gov/libraries/afghanistan/231771/PDFs/RFP-Lincoln-Learning-Centers.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

== Languages ==
{{Main|Languages of Afghanistan}}
[[Pashto language|Pashto]] and [[Persian/Dari language|Dari]] are both the official [[languages of Afghanistan]],&lt;ref name=AO/&gt; although Dari (Afghan Persian) serves as the lingua franca for the majority. People in the northern and central areas of the country usually speak Persian/Dari, while those living in the south and east speak Pashto. Afghans living in the western regions of Afghanistan speak both Dari and Pashto. Most citizens are fluent in both languages, especially those living in major cities where the population is multi-ethnic. Several other languages are spoken in their own regions, which includes [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and [[Balochi language|Balochi]].&lt;ref name=AO&gt;{{cite web|title=Article Sixteen of the Constitution of Afghanistan|url=http://www.afghan-web.com/politics/current_constitution.html#preamble |quote=From among the languages of Pashto, Dari, Uzbeki, Turkmani, Baluchi, Pashai, Nuristani, Pamiri (alsana), Arab and other languages spoken in the country, '''Pashto and Dari are the official languages of the state.'''|year=2004 |accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; English is gradually becoming popular among the young generation.

[[Islam]] is the main religion of Afghanistan and over 99% of Afghans are [[Muslims]]. An estimated 84.7–90% of the population adhere to [[Sunni Islam]], while an estimated 7–15% practice [[Shia Islam in Afghanistan|Shia Islam]], and approximately 1% are followers of other religions.&lt;ref name="Factbook"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/af.html |title=Afghanistan |work=The World Factbook |publisher=www.cia.gov |accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-1-religious-affiliation/#identity|title=Chapter 1: Religious Affiliation|date=August 9, 2012|work=The World's Muslims: Unity and Diversity|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]'s Religion &amp; Public Life Project|accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to Muslims, there are thousands of Afghan [[Sikhism in Afghanistan|Sikhs]] and [[Hinduism in Afghanistan|Hindus]] living in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/1994/4/1994-4-02.shtml Hinduism Today: Hindus Abandon Afghanistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111080626/http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/1994/4/1994-4-02.shtml |date=2007-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3138282.stm BBC South Asia: Sikhs struggle in Afghanistan]&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually found in the major cities such as [[Kabul]], [[Kandahar]], [[Herat]], [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], [[Jalalabad]], and [[Lashkar Gah]].

== Housing ==
[[Houses]] in rural Afghanistan are traditionally made out of [[mud]], and have a series of rooms located around a private rectangular courtyard where women and children play, cook and socialize. Married sons share the same house as their parents in most cases, although they have separate quarters. Afghan houses contain a special room where men socialize with each other known as a ''hujra''. In the cities, many Afghans live in modern style houses or [[apartments]]. There are many new housing schemes being built in all the major cities of the country. Some of these include the {{nowrap|$35 bn}} ''New Kabul City'' next to the capital, the ''Ghazi Amanullah Khan City'' near Jalalabad, and the ''Aino Mina'' in Kandahar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcda.gov.af/ DCDA - the Kabul New City Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.najeebzarab.af/town_main.php |title=Ghazi Amanullah Khan City |year=2009 |publisher=najeebzarab.af |accessdate=2011-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429180506/http://www.najeebzarab.af/town_main.php |archive-date=2013-04-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designmena.com/portfolio/aino-mina Case study: Aino Mina]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[nomad]]ic [[kuchi people]] live in large tents because they are constantly on the move from one part of the country to another.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070324105541/http://cp.settlement.org/english/afghanistan/family.html Cultural Profiles Project: Afghanistan Family Life]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious===
{{See also|Islamic Holiday|Public holidays in Afghanistan}}

Afghanistan's religious holidays are nearly the same as [[Islamic holidays]]. Some of the most important include [[Eid al-Fitr]] (end of [[Ramadan]]), [[Eid al-Adha]], [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]], and [[Mawlid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.afghan-web.com/culture/holidays.html |title=Afghanistan Online: Culture - Important holidays/occasions/festivities celebrated in Afghanistan |access-date=2005-05-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307202755/http://www.afghan-web.com/culture/holidays.html |archive-date=2005-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious minorities of Afghanistan, such as the [[Hindus]], [[Sikhs]], [[Zoroastrians]], and others celebrate holidays unique to their respective religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afghanhindu.info/ Afghan Hindus and Sikhs]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional===
Farmer's Day, also known as [[Nauruz in Afghanistan|Nauruz]] (Nowruz), is an ancient annual Afghan festival which celebrates both the beginning of spring and the [[New Year]]. The observances usually last two weeks, culminating on the first day of the Afghan New Year, March 21, and corresponds to the first day of the [[Persian Calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Key Afghan, US leadership plant trees for Farmer’s Day |author=Lt. j.g. Keith Goodsell |url=http://www.centcom.mil/news/key-afghan-us-leadership-plant-trees-for-farmer-s-day |publisher=[[United States Central Command]] |date=March 7, 2011 |accessdate=2012-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nauruz is related to a religion called [[Zoroastrianism]] which was in practice in ancient [[Iran|Persia]] before the emergence of Islam. This festival is to celebrate the arrival of spring as plants, trees, and flowers start to bloom making the weather pleasant. On the day of Nauruz, families usually celebrate the festival by cooking food and going out for a picnic. Families cook various kinds of meals, Samanak, and Haft-mewah or dry fruits that start with the letter (س) or (S) which represents the arrival of spring season. Haft-mewah contains seven dry fruits which families place in warm water two to three days before Nauruz. Samanak is another type of dessert made from wheat and sugar. Women usually get together days before Nauruz to prepare Samanak. They pour the ingredients into a big pot placed on an open fire and take turns to stir the wheat and sugar in the pot before it turns into a thick paste. Once prepared, the dessert is then served on the day of Nauruz.&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to Afghanistan Culture. http://eafghanag.ucdavis.edu/country-info/culture-and-working-locally/Man_Afghan_Culture_CWTI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''digital dark age''' is a lack of historical information in the digital age as a direct result of outdated file formats, software, or hardware that becomes corrupt, scarce, or inaccessible as technologies evolve and data decays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://apps.sciencefriday.com/data/reawakening.html|title=Data Reawakening|work=Science Friday|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Future generations may find it difficult or impossible to retrieve [[Electronic document|electronic documents]] and [[multimedia]], because they have been recorded in an [[Obsolescence|obsolete]] and obscure [[file format]]. The name derives from the term [[Dark Ages (historiography)|''Dark Ages'']] in the sense that there could be a relative lack of records in the digital age, as documents are transferred to digital formats and original copies are lost. An early mention of the term was at a conference of the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA) in 1997.[[Digital dark age#cite note-Kuny-1|&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] The term was also mentioned in 1998 at the Time and Bits conference,[[Digital dark age#cite note-MacLean-2|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]][[Digital dark age#cite note-Brand-3|&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] which was co-sponsored by the [[Long Now Foundation]] and the [[Getty Conservation Institute]].

== Proprietary and obsolete file formats ==
The problem is not limited to text documents, but applies equally to photos, video, audio and other kinds of electronic documents.[[Digital dark age#cite note-4|&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]] One concern leading to the use of the term is that documents are stored on physical [[Digital media|media]] which require special [[Computer hardware|hardware]] in order to be read and that this hardware will not be available in a few decades from the time the document was created. For example, it is already the case that disk drives capable of reading 5¼-inch [[Floppy disk|floppy disks]] are not readily available.[[Digital dark age#cite note-5|&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

The digital dark age also applies to the problems which arise due to [[Digital preservation#Migration|obsolete file formats]]. In such a case, it is the lack of necessary [[software]] which causes problems when retrieving stored documents. This is especially problematic when [[Proprietary format|proprietary formats]] are used, in which case it might be impossible to write appropriate software to read the file.

== Magnetic tape data storage ==
[[Magnetic tape data storage|Magnetic tape data]] storage is a method of storing data on [[magnetic tape]]. It is used as a backup method of storage for [[Digital Storage|digital storage]] and is one way of mitigating a possible digital dark age. For example, in 2011 hundreds of thousands of Google accounts were reset and the data in those accounts went missing. Google was able to restore the data to the email accounts from the data stored on magnetic tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/304135|title=Thousands of Gmail users find emails missing|date=2011-02-28|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Magnetic data storage is also used by financial institutions, hospitals, movie studios, and manufacturing companies to backup content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://apps.sciencefriday.com/data/ghosts.html|title=Ghosts In The Reels|work=Science Friday|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnetic tape can hold hundreds of terabytes of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-01-01/scientists-warn-we-may-be-creating-digital-dark-age|title=Scientists warn we may be creating a 'digital dark age'|work=Public Radio International|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archiving the internet ==
The [[Internet Archive]] has stated that one of their goals is to prevent the digital dark age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/about/|title=About the Internet Archive|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002231304/https://archive.org/about/|archivedate=2 October 2013|deadurl=no|accessdate=5 October 2013|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even [[Vinton Cerf]], Vice President of Google, showed his concerns about data preservation in the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science: "As the way that we store information about ourselves develops, memories stored in files that use older technology are becoming harder to access. That could mean that historians of the future are unable to learn about our lives". His suggested solution consists of preserving a sample of every piece of software and hardware that has ever existed so that it never becomes obsolete. He proposed taking an X-ray snapshot of the content, the application and the operating system along with a description of the machine. This information should be then stored, instead of in a museum, in servers in the cloud. &lt;ref&gt;Pallab, Ghosh. 2015. [https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-31450389 "Google's Vint Cerf warns of 'digital Dark Age'"]. BBC News, Science &amp; Environment.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical examples ==
A famous example is [[NASA]], whose early space records have suffered from a dark age issue more than once. For over a decade, magnetic tapes from the 1976 [[Viking program|Viking]] [[Mars landing]] were unprocessed. When later analyzed, the data was unreadable as it was in an unknown format and the original programmers had either died or left NASA. The images were eventually extracted following many months of puzzling through the data and examining how the recording machines functioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Another example is the [[BBC Domesday Project]] in which a survey of the nation was compiled 900 years after the [[Domesday Book]] was published. While the original Domesday Book is still readable today, there were great fears that the discs of the Domesday Project would become unreadable as software and disk drives capable of reading the format became rarer and rarer. However, in 2002 the [[CAMiLEON]] project [[PC migration|migrated]] the information to a system called DomesEm, allowing it to be accessed on modern computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Encryption and data preservation ==
[[Encryption]] may exacerbate the problem of preserving data, since decoding adds complexity even when the relevant software is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |archivedate = 29 July 2012
|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, encrypted data is quite rare, but even the very simple means available throughout history have provided many examples of documents that can only be read with great effort. For example, it took the capacity of a distributed computing project to break the mechanically generated code of a single brief World War II submarine tactical message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern encryption is being used in many more documents and media due to publishers wanting the promised protections of [[Digital rights management|DRM]].

==Open source file formats==
As more records are stored in digital form, there have been several measures to standardize electronic file formats so software to read them is widely available and can be re-implemented on new platforms if necessary.

[[PDF/A]] is an [[open standard]] based on [[Adobe Systems]] [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://acroeng.adobe.com/wp/?page_id=303|title = Adobe Acrobat Engineering:PDF Standards|accessdate = 7 July 2013|date = 12 March 2013|publisher = Adobe|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130707172612/http://acroeng.adobe.com/wp/?page_id=303|archivedate = 7 July 2013|deadurl = yes|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been widely adopted by governments and archives around the world, such as the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viewing government documents|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/viewing-government-documents|publisher=Cabinet Office|website=GOV.UK|date=6 August 2015|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[OpenDocument|The Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument)]] has been standardized by [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] in 2005, and by ISO in 2006. Since then, support for OpenDocument has been implemented in [[OpenDocument software|a large number of open source and proprietary software]]. Therefore, using OpenDocument is one option for archiving editable documents from office applications. More broadly, the use of [[open source software]] is a prevention measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cassia |first=Fernando |title=Open Source, the only weapon against 'planned obsolescence' |date=March 28, 2007 |publisher=[[The Inquirer]] |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1001739/open-source-weapon-planned-obsolescence |accessdate=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[source code]] for reading and writing a file format is open, the code can be used as a base for future implementations. In 2007, the chief information officer of the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|UK's National Archives]] stated "We welcome open-source software because it makes our lives easier".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Data storage standardization ==
In 2007, [[Microsoft]] created a partnership with the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|UK's National Archives]] to prevent the digital dark age and "unlock millions of unreadable stored computer files".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1400">'''Dionysius Exiguus's Easter table''' was constructed in the year 525 by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] for the years 532–626. He obtained it from an Easter table attributed to Patriarch [[Cyril of Alexandria]] for the years 437–531. The latter was constructed around the year 440 by means of extrapolation from an Alexandrian Easter table constructed around the year 390 by Patriarch [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus of Alexandria]]. The great historical importance of Dionysius' Easter table is twofold: 

# From this Easter table [[Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle|Bede's Easter cycle]] would ultimately be developed by means of which all future [[Julian calendar]] dates of [[Easter Sunday]] were determined (as in column G of Dionysius' table); 
# With his Easter table Dionysius introduced in passing the [[Christian era]] (see column A of Dionysius' table) which would be developed into a full system for dating historical events by [[Bede]] two centuries later.

The '''Dozo''' (also '''Donzo''', [[Bambara language|Bambara]] for ''hunter'', pl. '''donzow''') are traditional hunters in northern [[Côte d'Ivoire]], southeast [[Mali]], and [[Burkina Faso]], and members of a co-fraternity containing initiated hunters and sons of Dozo, called a ''Donzo Ton''. Not an ethnic group, the Dozo are drawn mostly from [[Mande languages|Mandé]]-speaking groups, but are also found among [[Dioula language|Dyula]]-speaking communities and most other ethnic groups in Côte d'Ivoire. Dozo societies increased in the last decades of the twentieth century, and Dozo groups came into political prominence during the [[First Ivorian Civil War|Ivorian Civil War]].

== Donzo Ton ==
The Donzo Ton (''Ton'' is a Mandé word for age-group, religious, or vocational associations) are but one of a number of hunter fraternities common in Mandé-speaking areas of West Africa.  Similar, and in the case of West Africa closely related groups, exist as the [[Kamajor]] in [[Sierra Leone]], [[Poro]] in [[Liberia]], the [[Mayi-Mayi]] in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and the [[Karamojong people|Karamojong]] in [[Uganda]]. Sons of Dozos, as well as new adherents, are able to be initiated into the Ton, and undergo a series of secret rituals. There has been a long history of these hunter collectives (the [[Ségou|Segu]] [[Bambara empire]] is said to have grown from such a ''Ton'') and hunters were often viewed by farming or pastoralist neighbours as possessing special power, wisdom and strength.  Collective organisations, as with many vocations in West Africa, existed in part to train and pass on needed skills.  Hunters, though, are found in every community, and are not a strictly inherited role.&lt;ref&gt;Diallo and Sántha stress this "openness" and lack of inherited identity as crucial to  replication of the Donzo Ton.  pp.67-69&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It is believed that the [[amulet]]s (''gris-gris'') worn by Dozos possess [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] properties protecting them from harm, and amplifying their [[Visual perception|vision]] and [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. Such amulets, inherited brown hunting clothing, as well as special hats, are said to make them [[bulletproof]]. Each local Donzo Ton is led by an elder hunter, the ''donzokuntigi''.  Along with ritual and initiation, local Donzo Ton will meet to discuss their work, organise hunts, or settle internal grievances, often in the all-night ''tonsigi'' gathering.  In this way, the Donzo Ton operates much like a western [[guild]].

Part of the cultural and ritual tradition of the Donzow surrounds sacrifice and protection of the community.  In traditional belief, wild animals killed by hunters released a [[nyama]], a destructive spirit which afflicted the community benefiting from the kill.  Donzo Ton trained to perform rituals, cleansing the nyama and enabling them to both share their bounty with the community of non-hunters, and act as spiritual guardians of settled communities from malevolent forces of the forest or bush.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph  Hellweg, especially ''Encompassing the State.'' (2006).  Hellweg, who was actually inducted into a Donzo Ton, argues their later role as security guards grows from this same role as community guardians who stand at the threshold of society.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Ivorian society and politics ==
While there are records of hunter ''Ton''s going back to the [[Mali Empire]], since the 1990s there has been a particular growth of local collectives of Donzo Ton in [[Côte d'Ivoire]].  It is believed that this growth first originated along the border with Mali, and spread into forested regions of Côte d'Ivoire. In Mali, hunter associations were organised into a national union (''l`Association Nationale des Chasseurs'').  This is seen as the birth of the ''Benkadi'', a network of Donzo Ton. By the year 2000 there were over 22,000 official members.&lt;ref&gt;Number cited in Caspary. See Bassett (2004) and Caspary (2000).  Hagberg traces the growth of ''Benkadi'' in Burkina.&lt;/ref&gt;

One explanation for the huge growth in the Benkadi network in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;Bassett (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; is the rapid increase in deforestation (and thus more scarce hunting land) in the north, economic hardship in other vocations, along with the growing insecurity across the country fed by fears of civil war spreading from [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. [[World Bank]]-mandated structural adjustment and a currency devaluation in 1994 helped spread an unprecedented crime wave.  These hunter groups, then, were simultaneously respected (even feared) for their power by neighbours while growing in numbers and organisation while the government slid into ethnic conflict and civil war.  In many places the Benkadi were hired or simply stepped in to fill this vacuum.

At the beginning of the 1990s, President [[Houphouët-Boigny]] had called on public-minded citizens to aid the police, and as crime increased, local officials drafted in hunters in [[Korhogo]] and [[Ferkessédougou]].  Not only were the hunter militias successful, but their fame spread far beyond the north.  Donzow became a common sight in towns and on the roads.  They were hired by locals and both sides in the [[First Ivorian Civil War|Ivorian Civil War]] as soldiers, to guard vehicles, direct traffic, or patrol religious sites.  This success fed into the growth of Benkadi groups in all parts of Côte d'Ivoire, as the civil war and fragile peace made local organisation of security much sought after.  In [[Abidjan]] and [[Bouaké]]. Donzo Ton leaders opened security offices, trading not only on their northern successes, but on a public perception of special (even magical) abilities of Donzow.  Unemployed men from around the country came to [[Korhogo]] and [[Odienné]], home of Benkadi leadership, to be initiated into a Donzo Ton, and thus have access to work as well-paid security guards.&lt;ref&gt;for this paragraph, see Bassett, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil War ===

While Donzow became guards for hire in the unstable years before the 2002&amp;ndash;2005 [[First Ivorian Civil War|Ivorian Civil War]], their network became associated with northern groups who led the rebel forces. The Donzo Ton, viewed as saviours by some in the south, were also seen as unsophisticated throwbacks to a pre-modern era by many in cosmopolitan [[Abidjan]].&lt;ref&gt;Hellweg, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  The transnational and northern source of the Donzo Ton were seen to conflict with the ethnic nationalism of [[Ivoirité]] which feared the presence of [[Demographics of Burkina Faso|Burkinabé]] labourers and immigrants from Mali as not being "true" Ivorians.  Politically, it was [[Rally of the Republicans|Rassemblement des Républicains (RDR)]] politicians from the north who first entrusted the Donzow with policing duties, and the Donzo Ton leadership became associated with the RDR.  Nationalist Presidents [[Henri Konan Bédié]], and later [[Laurent Gbagbo]], condemned these armed Benkadi groups as regressive, divisive and dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;Bassett 2004&lt;/ref&gt; It was not surprising, then, when the September 2002 coup began the civil war, northern forces included many identifiable Donzow. One rebel group, the [[Ivorian Popular Movement of the Great West|Mouvement populaire ivoirien du Grand Ouest (MPIGO)]] was thought to be one-fifth Donzow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/ACOS-64BT68?OpenDocument&amp;query=dozo&amp;emid=ACOS-635PLK  Western Ivorian rebels arrive in Togo to sign truce, raising peace hopes]. Agence France-Presse (AFP), 12 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  This participation, while earning the enmity of many in the south, has made leaders of the Donzo Ton Benkadi network powerful figures whose support has been sought by Prime Minister (and former rebel leader) [[Guillaume Soro]]'s  [[Patriotic Movement of Côte d'Ivoire]]. Kuruma Lansine, public head of the Benkadi has become a political leader for standing by and speaking for "the dozos".&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200712310788.html Côte d'Ivoire: American Embassy's National Daily Press Review], 28 December 2007, quotes the RDR paper ''Le Patriote'' reporting Soro's meetings with "Dozos"  and their leaders re-affirming their support.&lt;/ref&gt;

While most studies stress the stabilising nature the Donzo Ton had on the country both before and after the civil war, human rights organisations have documented a pattern of lawlessness, intimidation, and extrajudicial killings by Donzow groups beginning from at least 1997, through [[1999 Ivorian coup d'état|the 1999 coup]] (in which Donzo Ton set up checkpoints on roads across the north),  and the 2002&amp;ndash;2005 war.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Amnesty International]] (below) and [https://www.hrw.org/English/docs/2004/12/15/cotedi9880.htm Human Rights Watch. 2005. World Report. New York: HRW]. pp. 107-114. For one such incident blamed on Dozo militia, see: [http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/EVIU-6CZH3Z?OpenDocument&amp;query=dozo&amp;emid=ACOS-635PLK Christophe Koffi: In mourning, southwest Ivory Coast seeks revenge and those responsible]. Agence France-Presse (AFP), 3 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Mali society ==
In 2017 local civilians accused the Malian government of arming groups of Dozo, who have allegedly carried out a spate of killings of nomadic [[Fula people|Fula]] populations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_stabilising_mali_why_europe_must_look_beyond_7293 Stabilising Mali - why Europe must look beyond technicalities]&lt;/ref&gt;.

In June 2018 Dozo surrounded a village in the [[Mopti Region]], separated members of the Fula ethnic group from the other villagers and killed at least 32 of them. The Fula complain that they are being regularly targeted by the traditional hunters in the name of the fight against [[jihadists]]. They accuse the Malian military of supporting such incidents&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-44594595 Mali Fula villagers were killed 'in cold blood']&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Music==
The Dozo are also known for their praise singers (see [[Griot]]) and rituals, often accompanied by the dozo [[Ngoni (instrument)|n’goni]], a variant of n'goni West African lute said to have originated among the [[Senufo people|Senufo]] hunters of [[Burkina Faso]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Instruments/Anglais/dpbf_c_txt07_en.html ''dozo n’goni'', Staying in Tune: Traditions and Musical Instruments of the Francophonie, Canadian Heritage Information Network / virtualmuseum.ca].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Early Modern Japanese'''|近世日本語|kinsei nihongo}} is a stage of the [[Japanese language]] following [[Late Middle Japanese|Middle Japanese]] and preceding [[Modern Japanese]].&lt;ref&gt;Shibatani (1990: 119)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a period of transition in which the language sheds many of its medieval characteristics and becomes closer to its modern form.

The period spanned roughly 250 years extending from the 17th century through half of the 19th century. Politically, this generally corresponds with the [[Edo period]].

==Background==

At the beginning of the 17th century, the center of government moved to [[Edo]] from [[Kamigata]] under the control of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. Until the early Edo period, the Kamigata dialect, the ancestor of the modern [[Kansai dialect]], was the most influential dialect. However, since the late Edo period, the Edo dialect, the ancestor of the modern [[Tokyo dialect]], became the most influential dialect, during the time in which the country [[Sakoku|closed]] its borders to foreigners. Compared to the previous centuries, the Tokugawa rule brought about much stability. The newfound stability made the importance of the [[Samurai|warrior]] class gradually fall, to be replaced by the [[Chōnin|merchant]] class. There was much economic growth, and new forms of artistic developments appeared such as [[Ukiyo-e]], [[Kabuki]], and [[Bunraku]]. This included new literary genres such as [[Ukiyozōshi]], [[Sharebon]] (pleasure districts), [[Kokkeibon]] (commoners), and [[Ninjōbon]] developed. Major authors included [[Ihara Saikaku]], [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]], [[Matsuo Bashō]], [[Shikitei Sanba]], and [[Santō Kyōden]].

==Phonology==

===Vowels===

There were five [[vowel]]s: /i, e, a, o, u/.

* /i/: {{IPA|[i]}}
* /e/: {{IPA|[e]}}
* /a/: {{IPA|[a]}}
* /o/: {{IPA|[o]}}
* /u/: {{IPA|[ɯ]}}

During Middle Japanese, word-initial /e/ and /o/ were realized with the [[semivowel]]s {{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} preceding the vowel, respectively {{dubious|date=October 2012}}. Both were realized as simple vowels by the middle of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nakata (1972: 238-239)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Close vowel|high vowels]] /i, u/ become voiceless {{IPA|[i̥, ɯ̥]}} between voiceless consonants or the end of the word. This is noted in a number of foreign texts:&lt;ref&gt;Nakata (1972: 239-241)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Diego Collado]] ''[[Diego Collado's Grammar of the Japanese Language|Ars Grammaticae Iaponicae Lingvae]]'' (1632) gives word final examples: ''gozàru'' &gt; ''gozàr'', ''fitòtçu'' &gt; ''fitòtç'', and ''àxi no fàra'' &gt; ''àx no fàra''.
*E. Kaempfer's ''Geschichte und Beschreibung von Japan'' (1777–1779) and C. P. Thunberg's ''Resa uti Europa, Africa, Asia'' (1788–1793) list word-medial examples: ''kurosaki'' &gt; ''krosaki'', ''atsuka'' &gt; ''atska''.

====Long vowels====

Middle Japanese had two types of long ''o'': {{IPA|[ɔː]}} and {{IPA|[oː]}}. During this period, both of these merged into {{IPA|[oː]}} by first half of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nakata (1972: 256)&lt;/ref&gt; During the transition, instances of {{IPA|ɔː}} temporarily had a tendency to become short in the Kamigata dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Nakata (1972: 262-263)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yamaguchi (1997:116-117)&lt;/ref&gt;
* nomɔː &gt; nomo "drink"
* hayɔː &gt; hayo "quickly"

In addition, each of the other vowels could be lengthened because of various contractions in Edo dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Nakata (1972: 260-262)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yamaguchi (1997: 150-151)&lt;/ref&gt; Most continue to be used in [[Modern Japanese]] of both Tokyo and the rest of the Kanto region but are not part of [[Standard Japanese]].
*/ai/ &gt; [eː]: sekai &gt; sekeː "world", saigo &gt; seːgo "last"
*/ae/ &gt; [eː]: kaeru &gt; keːru "frog", namae &gt; nameː "name"
*/oi/ &gt; [eː]: omoɕiroi &gt; omoɕireː
*/ie/ &gt; [eː]: oɕieru &gt; oɕeːru "teach"
*/ui/ &gt; [iː]: warui &gt; wariː
*/i wa/ &gt; [jaː]: kiki wa &gt; kikjaː "listening"
*/o wa/ &gt; [aː]: nanzo wa &gt; nanzaː (grammar)

The long /uː/ was developed during Middle Japanese and remains unchanged.

===Consonants===

Middle Japanese had the following [[consonant]] inventory:

{| class="IPA wikitable"
!
![[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]
![[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]
![[Postalveolar consonant|Postalveolar]]
![[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]
![[Velar consonant|Velar]]
![[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]
![[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]
|-
!'''[[Stop consonant|Stop]]'''

| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| align=center | [[Voiceless velar plosive|{{IPA|k}}]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[Voiced velar plosive|{{IPA|ɡ}}]]
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
|-
!'''[[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]'''
| &amp;nbsp;

| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
|-
!'''[[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]'''
| align=center | [[Bilabial nasal|{{IPA|m}}]]
| align=center | [[Alveolar nasal|{{IPA|n}}]]
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| align=center | [[Uvular nasal|{{IPA|ɴ}}]]
| &amp;nbsp;
|-
!'''[[fricative consonant|Fricative]]'''
| align=center | [[Voiceless bilabial fricative|{{IPA|ɸ}}]]
| align=center | [[Voiceless alveolar fricative|{{IPA|s}}]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[Voiced alveolar fricative|{{IPA|z}}]]
| align=center | [[Voiceless alveolo-palatal fricative|{{IPA|ɕ}}]]
| align=center | [[Voiceless palatal fricative|{{IPA|ç}}]]
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| align=center | [[Voiceless glottal fricative|{{IPA|h}}]]
|-
!'''[[Liquid consonant|Liquid]]'''
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| align=center | {{IPA|r}}&lt;!-- It is inappropriate to link this to the article on any particular sound because the realization is not clear. --&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
|-
!'''[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]'''
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
| align=center | [[Palatal approximant|{{IPA|j}}]]
| align=center | [[Velar approximant|{{IPA|ɰ}}]]
| &amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

/t, s, z, h/ each have a number of [[allophone]]s found before the [[Close vowel|high vowels]] [i, ɯ]:
*t → {{IPA| t͡ʃ}} / __i
*t → {{IPA| t͡s}} / __ɯ
*z → {{IPA| d͡ʒ}} / __i
*z → {{IPA| d͡z}} / __ɯ
*h → {{IPA|ç}} / __i
*h → {{IPA|ɸ}} / __ɯ

Several major developments occurred:
*/zi, di/ and /zu, du/, respectively, no longer contrast
*/h/ partially develops from [ɸ] into [h, ç]
*/se/ loses its palatalization and becomes {{IPA|[se]}}

Middle Japanese had a syllable final -t. This is gradually replaced with the open syllable /tu/.

===Labialization===

The labial /kwa, gwa/ merge with their non-labial counterparts into [ka, ga].&lt;ref&gt;Yamamoto (1997: 147-148)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palatalization===

The consonants /s, z/, /t/, /n/, /h, b/, /p/, /m/, and /r/ could be palatalized.

Depalatalization may also be seen in the Edo dialect:
*[[Hyakunin Isshu|hyakunin issyu]] &gt; hyakunisi
*/teisyu/ &gt; /teisi/ "lord"
*/zyumyoː/ &gt; /zimyoː/ "life"

===Prenasalization===

Middle Japanese had a series of [[Prenasalized consonant|prenasalized]] [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] [[Stop consonant|plosives]] and [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]]: {{IPA|[&lt;sup&gt;ŋ&lt;/sup&gt;ɡ, &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;z, &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;d, &lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;b]}}. During this stage they lose their prenasalization resulting in {{IPA|ɡ, z, d, b}}.

==Grammar==

===Verbs===

Early Modern Japanese has five [[verb]]al conjugations:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Verb Class
! Irrealis&lt;br /&gt;未然形
! Adverbial&lt;br /&gt;連用形
! Conclusive&lt;br /&gt;終止形
! Attributive&lt;br /&gt;連体形
! Hypothetical&lt;br /&gt;仮定形
! Imperative&lt;br /&gt;命令形
|-
! Quadrigrade (四段)
| align=center | -a
| align=center | -i
| align=center | -u
| align=center | -u
| align=center | -e
| align=center | -e
|-
! Upper Monograde(上一段)
| align=center | -i
| align=center | -i
| align=center | -iru
| align=center | -iru
| align=center | -ire
| align=center | -i(yo, ro)
|-
! Lower Monograde (下一段)
| align=center | -e
| align=center | -e
| align=center | -eru
| align=center | -eru
| align=center | -ere
| align=center | -e(yo, ro)
|-
! K-irregular (カ変)
| align=center | -o
| align=center | -i
| align=center | -uru
| align=center | -uru
| align=center | -ure
| align=center | -oi
|-
! S-irregular (サ変)
| align=center | -e, -a, -i
| align=center | -i
| align=center | -uru
| align=center | -uru
| align=center | -ure
| align=center | -ei, -iro
|-
|}

As already had already begun during Middle Japanese, the verbal morphology system continues to evolve. The total number of verb classes is reduced from nine to five. Specifically, the r-irregular and n-irregular regularize as quadrigrade, and the upper and lower bigrade classes merge with their respective monograde. This leaves the quadrigrade, upper monograde, lower monograde, k-irregular, s-irregular.&lt;ref&gt;Yamaguchi (1997:129)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adjectives===

There were two types of adjectives: regular [[adjective]]s and [[adjectival noun (Japanese)|adjectival noun]]s.

Historically the adjective was sub-classified into two types: those where the adverbial form ends in -ku and those that end in –siku. That distinction is lost during this stage.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Irrealis&lt;br /&gt;未然形
! Adverbial&lt;br /&gt;連用形
! Conclusive&lt;br /&gt;終止形
! Attributive&lt;br /&gt;連体形
! Hypothetical&lt;br /&gt;仮定形
! Imperative&lt;br /&gt;命令形
|-
| align=center | -kara
| align=center | -ku
| align=center | -i
| align=center | -i
| align=center | -kere
| align=center | -kare
|}

Historically the adjectival noun was sub-classified into two categories: -nar and -tar. During this stage, -tar vanishes leaving only -na.

{| class="wikitable"

'''''Fanfare''''' is an American bimonthly magazine devoted to reviewing recorded music in all playback formats. It mainly covers [[classical music]], but since inception, has also featured a [[jazz]] column in every issue.

==History and profile==
''Fanfare'' was founded on 1 September 1977 "as a labor of love"&lt;ref name=Rockwell/&gt; by an elementary-school teacher turned editor named Joel Bruce Flegler (born 1941).  After {{age|1977|09|01}} years, he is still the publisher.&lt;ref name=Rockwell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laffler, William D. (31 August 1980). "Born on a Shoestring". ''[[The Times (Trenton)|The Trenton Evening Times]]'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine now runs to over 600 pages in a 6" x 9" format with about 80% of the editorial copy devoted to record reviews, and a front section with a substantial number of interviews and feature articles.&lt;ref&gt;''Fanfare''. January/February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It avoids [[Audio equipment testing|equipment]] and [[pop music]] coverage and manages to include reviews of many more classical releases than is typical for other magazines in this genre.&lt;ref name=Rockwell&gt;Rockwell, John (29 June 1980). [https://www.nytimes.com/1980/06/29/archives/the-new-crop-of-music-magazines.html?sq=fanfare%2520magazine&amp;scp=1&amp;st=cse "The New Crop of Music Magazines"]. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kimmelman, Michael (20 December 1987). [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/20/arts/the-tempo-is-changing-for-music-magazines.html?pagewanted=print&amp;src=pm "The Tempo is Changing for Music Magazines"]. ''The New York Times''. "The most prolific at [reviewing classical records] now is Fanfare magazine…."&lt;/ref&gt; Subscriptions include online access to current content and archives of past issues.&lt;ref name=FanfareOnline&gt;[http://www.fanfaremag.com/ ''Fanfare'' website]. Retrieved 15 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fanfare'''s editorial contributors have a range of expertise from the medieval to contemporary work.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Describing itself as "the magazine for serious record collectors", its reviews cover not only the quality of live performance, but also that of sound and recording.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The [[national flag|national]] '''flag of Mali''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Drapeau du Mali'') is a [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]] with three equal vertical stripes. From the hoist (the place where the flagpole meets the flag) the colours are [[green]], [[gold (colour)|gold]], and [[red]], the [[pan-African colours]].  The flag of [[Mali]] is almost identical to the [[flag of Guinea]], with the exception that the colours are in reverse order.
== Symbolism ==
The green stands for fertility of the land, gold stands for purity and mineral wealth and the red symbolizes the blood shed for independence from the French. {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

== History ==
The current flag was adopted on March 1, 1961. The original flag was adopted on April 4, 1959, when Mali joined the [[Mali Federation]]. This flag was the same, except the golden stripe had a human stick figure, a ''kanaga'', in black, with arms raised to the sky. The figure was removed due to the opposition,  in a country whose population is [[Demographics of Mali|90% Muslim]],  of [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalists]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1355376/Mali-flag-of&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Aniconism in Islam]], the belief against making pictures of the human figure).&lt;ref&gt;''Guide to the Flags of the World'' by Mauro Talocci, revised and updated by Whitney Smith ({{ISBN|0-688-01141-1}}), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gente de razón''''' ({{IPA-es|ˈxente ðe raˈθon}}, "people of reason" or "rational people") is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term used in colonial [[Spanish America]] and modern [[Hispanic America]] to refer to people who were culturally [[Hispanicized]]. It was a social distinction that existed alongside the racial categories of the ''[[Casta|sistema de castas]]''. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous peoples]] (''indios'' or "Indians"), who maintained their culture and lived in their legally recognized communities (the ''repúblicas de indios''), and [[mixed-race]] people (the ''[[casta]]s''), especially the poor in urban centers, were generally considered not to be ''gente de razón''.

==Etymology==
The term is ultimately derived from [[Politics (Aristotle)|Aristotelian]] and [[Status in Roman legal system|Roman legal]] ideas about the use of reason in persons and the status of [[Minor (law)|minority]] before the law. Under Roman law many adults (women, grown men who were not heads of household) were deemed legal minors under the protection of a tutor (usually the [[pater familias]]).

Additionally, in the early establishment of New Spain, indigenous peoples who converted and were baptized into the Catholic religion often adopted Christian first names and Spanish last names as signs of outward transformation. Colonial leaders used the term "gente de razón" ("people of reason") to distinguish these converted natives from unconverted ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miranda|first=Gloria E.|date=1988|title=Racial and Cultural Dimensions of "Gente de Razón" Status in Spanish and Mexican California|jstor=41171310|journal=Southern California Quarterly|volume=70|issue=3|pages=265–278|doi=10.2307/41171310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Spanish America==
Since the sixteenth century the [[Laws of the Indies]] categorized Indians as minors under the protection of the Crown (cf. [[Dhimmi]] status in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] legal system). [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|Slaves]], and by extension all [[Black people|Blacks]], were also legally deemed not to belong to the ''gente de razón''. These groups were also excluded from the [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] for most of the colonial period.

In frontier regions such as [[Chile]], [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Río de la Plata]] or the [[Commandancy General of the Provincias Internas|Provincias Internas]], the category of ''gente de razón'' gained additional importance and it was interpreted differently than in the areas with a longer Spanish presence.  Since the term was used to distinguish between acculturated people who lived in Spanish settlements (the ''repúblicas de españoles'') from the ''gente sin razón'' ("people without reason"), or Natives who had not accepted Spanish rule or who lived on [[List of Spanish missions|missions]], it often included acculturated people who normally might not have been included. These areas were settled by Hispanized Indians from the older areas of Spanish settlement, [[Mulatto]]s, Blacks and [[Mestizo]]s, all who usually became ''gente de razón''. Because of this, in the frontier areas mixed-race people had a greater chance of social mobility, and their descendants often became the elites of the region.

'''''In An Antique Land''''' is an [[ethnography]] written in [[Narrative|narrative form]] by the Indian writer [[Amitav Ghosh]].

==Summary==
The book contains two narratives. The first, an anthropological narrative, revolves around two visits made by Ghosh to two villages in the [[Nile Delta]], while he was writing his doctoral dissertation (1980–81) and again a few years later (1988). In the second narrative, presented parallel to the first one in the book, Ghosh reconstructs the history of a 12th-century Jewish merchant, Abraham Ben Yiju, and his slaves Ashu and Bomma, using documents from  the [[Cairo Geniza]].&lt;ref name=desai&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Old World Orders: Amitav Ghosh and the Writing of Nostalgia|last=Desai|first=Gaurav|journal=Representations|volume=85|issue=Winter 2004|publisher=California University Press|pages=125–148|jstor=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary==
''In an Antique Land'' is considered to be a stylistically curious book. Written after the success of Ghosh's first two books, ''[[The Circle of Reason (novel)|The Circle of Reason]]'' and ''[[The Shadow Lines]]'', and written more than a decade after the dissertation on which the book is based, In an Antique Land defies easy description and has been called "generically indefinable" and could be labelled as "narrative, travel book, autobiographical piece, historical account".&lt;ref name=srivastava&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Amitav Ghosh’s Ethnographic Fictions: Intertextual Links between In An Antique Land and His Doctoral Thesis|last=Srivastava|first=Neelam|volume=36|issue=June 2001|publisher=Sage Publications|journal=The Journal of Commonwealth Literature|accessdate=11 April 2011|pages=45–64|url=http://jcl.sagepub.com/content/36/2/45.full.pdf|doi=10.1177/002198940103600205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{PIE notice}}
{{Sound change}}
In [[linguistics]], the '''Indo-European ablaut''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|b|l|aʊ|t}}) is a system of [[apophony]] (regular [[vowel]] variations) in the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. All modern [[Indo-European languages]] have inherited the feature, though its prevalence and productivity strongly varies.

An example of ablaut in English is the [[Germanic strong verb|strong verb]] ''s'''i'''ng, s'''a'''ng, s'''u'''ng'' and its related noun ''s'''o'''ng'', a paradigm inherited directly from the Proto-Indo-European stage of the language.

== History of the concept ==
The term ''[[wikt:ablaut|ablaut]]'' (from German ''ab-'' in the sense "down, reducing, gradated" + ''Laut'' "sound", thus literally meaning "sound gradation") was coined in the early nineteenth century by linguist [[Jacob Grimm]]. However, the phenomenon of the Indo-European ablaut itself was first recorded more than 2000 years earlier by the [[Sanskrit grammar]]ians and was codified by [[Pāṇini]] in his [[Ashtadhyayi]], where the terms ''[[guṇa|{{IAST|guṇa}}]]'' and ''[[vṛddhi|{{IAST|vṛddhi}}]]'' were used to describe the phenomena now known respectively as the ''full grade'' and ''lengthened grade''.

In the context of European languages, the phenomenon was first described in the early 18th century by the Dutch linguist [[Lambert ten Kate]], in his book ''Gemeenschap tussen de Gottische spraeke en de Nederduytsche'' ("Commonality between the [[Gothic language]] and [[Dutch language|Low German [Dutch]]]", 1710).

==Overview of Proto-Indo-European==
Since ablaut was a regular system in Proto-Indo-European (PIE) but survives only as irregular or partially regular variations in the recorded languages, any explanation of ablaut has to begin with an overview of PIE.

Proto-Indo-European (PIE) is the hypothetical parent language from which most of the modern and ancient European languages evolved. By comparing the recorded forms from PIE's [[daughter language]]s, linguists can infer the forms of the parent language. However, it is not possible to be certain how the reconstructed forms were pronounced, and the reconstructions are to be understood as an encoding of the deduced phonemes, rather than a reliable indication of the actual pronunciations.

==Ablaut and vowel gradation==
{{more|Apophony}}
Vowel gradation is any vowel difference between two related words (such as ''ph'''o'''tograph'' [ˈf'''əʊ'''təgrɑːf] and ''ph'''o'''tography'' [f'''ə'''ˈtɒgrəfi]) or two forms of the same word (such as ''m'''a'''n'' and ''m'''e'''n''). The difference need not be indicated in the spelling. There are many kinds of vowel gradation in English and other languages, which are discussed generally in the article [[apophony]]. Some involve a variation in vowel length, others in vowel coloring (qualitative gradation: ''m'''a'''n''/''m'''e'''n'') and others the complete disappearance of a vowel (reduction to zero: ''could n'''o'''t'' → ''couldn't'').

For the study of European languages, one of the most important instances of vowel gradation is the Indo-European ablaut, remnants of which can be seen in the English verbs ''r'''i'''de'', ''r'''o'''de'', ''r'''i'''dden'', or ''fl'''y''''', ''fl'''ew''''', ''fl'''ow'''n''. For simply learning English grammar, it is enough to note that these verbs are [[irregular verb|irregular]], but understanding why they have unusual forms that seem irregular (and indeed why they are actually perfectly regular within their own terms) requires an understanding of the grammar of the [[Reconstructed language|reconstructed proto-language]], where they were regular.

Ablaut is the oldest and most extensive single source of vowel gradation in the Indo-European languages and must be distinguished clearly from other forms of gradation, which developed later, such as Germanic [[Germanic Umlaut|umlaut]] (''m'''a'''n''/''m'''e'''n'', ''g'''oo'''se''/''g'''ee'''se'', ''l'''o'''ng''/''l'''e'''ngth'') or the results of modern English word-stress patterns (''m'''a'''n''/''wom'''a'''n'', ''ph'''o'''tograph''/''phot'''o'''graphy''). Confusingly, in some contexts, the terms 'ablaut', 'vowel gradation', 'apophony' and 'vowel alternation' are used synonymously, especially in [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] comparisons, but [[historical linguistics|historical linguists]] prefer to keep 'ablaut' for the specific Indo-European phenomenon, which is the meaning intended by the linguists who first coined the word.

==Ablaut grades==
In Proto-Indo-European, the basic, inherent vowel of most syllables was a short ''e''. ''Ablaut'' is the name of the process whereby this short ''e'' changed, becoming short ''o'', long ''ē'', long ''ō'' or sometimes disappearing entirely to leave no vowel at all.

Thus, ablaut turned short ''e'' into the following sounds:

{| class="wikitable"
| zero
| short
| long
|-
| rowspan=2 | ∅
| e
| ē
|-
| o
| ō
|}

If a syllable had a short ''e'', it is said to be in the "e-grade" or "full grade". When it had no vowel, it is said to be in the "zero grade". Syllables with long vowels are said to be in "lengthened grade". (When the ''e''-grade or the ''o''-grade is referred to, the short vowel forms are meant.)

A classic example of the five grades of ablaut in a single root is provided by the different case forms of two closely related Greek words. In the following table, an acute accent (´) marks the syllable carrying the word stress; a macron (¯) marks long vowels and the syllable in '''bold''' is the one illustrating the different vowel gradations.

::{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Ablaut grade
| PIE (reconstruction)
| Greek
| (Greek transliterated)

|-
| e-grade or full grade
| *ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-'''tér'''-m̥
| {{lang|grc|πα-'''τέρ'''-α}}
| pa-'''tér'''-a
| "father" (noun, accusative)
|-
| lengthened e-grade
| *ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-'''tḗr'''
| {{lang|grc|πα-'''τήρ'''}}
| pa-'''tḗr'''
| "father" (noun, nominative)
|-
| zero-grade
| *ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-'''tr'''-és
| {{lang|grc|πα-'''τρ'''-ός}}
| pa-'''tr'''-ós
| "father's" (noun, genitive)
|-
| o-grade
| *n̥-péh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-'''tor'''-m̥
| {{lang|grc|ἀ-πά-'''τορ'''-α}}
| a-pá-'''tor'''-a
| "fatherless" (adjective, accusative)
|-
| lengthened o-grade
| *n̥-péh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-'''tōr'''
| {{lang|grc|ἀ-πά-'''τωρ'''}}
| a-pá-'''tōr'''
| "fatherless" (adjective, nominative)
|-
|}

In this unusually neat example, the following can be seen:
*A switch to the zero-grade when the word stress moves to the following syllable.
*A switch to the o-grade when the word stress moves to the preceding syllable.
*A lengthening of the vowel when the syllable is in word-final position.

As with most reconstructions, however, scholars differ about the details of this example.

One way to think of this system is that Proto-Indo-European originally had only one vowel, short ''e'', and over time, it changed according to phonetic context, so the language started to develop a more complex vowel system. Thus, it has often been speculated that an original e-grade underwent two changes in some phonetic environments: under certain circumstances, it changed to ''o'' (the o-grade) and in others, it disappeared entirely (the zero-grade).

However, that is not certain: the phonetic conditions that controlled ablaut have never been determined, and the position of the word stress may not have been a key factor at all.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} There are many counterexamples to the proposed rules: ''*deywós'' and its nominative plural ''*deywóes'' show pretonic and posttonic e-grade, respectively, and  ''*wĺ̥kʷos'' has an accented zero grade.

===Lengthened grades===
Many examples of lengthened grades, including those listed above, are not directly conditioned by ablaut. Instead, they are a result of sound changes like [[Szemerényi's law]] and [[Stang's law]], which caused [[compensatory lengthening]] of originally-short vowels. In the examples above, Szemerényi's law affected the older sequences *ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-tér-s and *n̥-péh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-tor-s, changing them to *ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-tḗr and *n̥-péh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-tōr. Thus, these forms were originally in the regular, unlengthened e-grade and o-grade. Such lengthened vowels were, however, later [[grammaticalization|grammaticalised]] and spread to other words in which the change did not occur.

Nevertheless, there are examples of true lengthened grades, in which short ''e'' alternates with long ''ē''. Examples are the verbs with [[Narten present|"Narten" inflection]], and nouns like ''*mḗh₁-n̥s'' "moon", genitive ''*méh₁-n̥s-os''. Alternations of this type were rare, however, and the ''e'' ~ ''o'' ~ ''∅'' alternation was the most common by far. The long ''ō'' grade was rarer still and may not have actually been a part of the ablaut system at all.

===Zero grade===
The zero grade of ''ablaut'' may appear difficult for speakers of English. However, there are several languages who show fricatives and even plosives in syllable nuclei. In the case of *ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;trés, which may already have been pronounced something like {{IPA|[pɐtrés]}}, it is not difficult to imagine it as a contraction of an older *ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;terés, pronounced perhaps {{IPA|[pɐterés]}}, as this combination of consonants and vowels would be possible in English as well. In other cases, however, the absence of a vowel strikes the speaker of a modern western European language as unpronounceable.

To understand, one must be aware that there were a number of sounds that were consonants in principle but could operate in ways analogous to vowels: the four syllabic sonorants, the three [[laryngeal theory|laryngeals]] and the two semi-vowels:

*The [[syllabic consonant|syllabic sonorants]] are ''m'', ''n'', ''r'' and ''l'', which could be consonants much as they are in English, but they could also be held on as continuants and carry a full syllable stress and then are transcribed with a small circle beneath them.
*The laryngeals could be pronounced as consonants, in which case they were probably variations on the ''h'' sound and so normally transcribed as h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and h&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. However, they could also carry a syllable stress, in which case they were more like vowels. Thus, some linguists prefer to transcribe them ə&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ə&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ə&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The vocalic pronunciation may have originally involved the consonantal sounds with a very slight schwa before and/or after the consonant.
*In pre-vocalic positions, the phonemes ''u'' and ''i'' were semi-vowels, probably pronounced like English ''w'' and ''y'', but they could also become pure vowels when the following ablaut vowel reduced to zero.

When ''u'' and ''i'' came in postvocalic positions, the result was a diphthong. Ablaut is nevertheless regular and looks like this:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| e-grade
| o-grade
| zero-grade
|-
| ey
| oy
| i
|-
| ew
| ow
| u
|}

Thus, any of these could replace the ablaut vowel when it was reduced to the zero-grade: the pattern CVrC (for example, ''*bʰergʰ-'') could become CrC (''*bʰr̥gʰ-'').

However, not every PIE syllable was capable of forming a zero grade; some consonant structures inhibited it in particular cases, or completely. Thus, for example, although the [[preterite]] plural of a Germanic strong verb (see below) is derived from the zero grade, classes 4 and 5 have instead vowels representing the lengthened e-grade, as the stems of these verbs could not have sustained a zero grade in this position.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Zero grade is said to be from pre-PIE [[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]] in unaccented syllables,{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} but in some cases the lack of accent does not cause zero grade: ''*deywó-'', nominative plural ''*-es'' "god". There does not seem to be a rule governing the unaccented syllables that take zero grade and the ones that take stronger grades.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Nowadays a few Indo-Europeanists reject the syncope hypothesis, and instead understand early PIE as a [[Polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]] and [[Nonconcatenative morphology|templatic]] type language with discontinuous consonant roots and vowel transfixes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===a-grade===
It is still a matter of debate whether PIE had an original a-vowel at all. In later PIE, the disappearance of the laryngeal h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; could leave an a-colouring and this may explain all occurrences of ''a'' in later PIE. However, some argue controversially that the e-grade could sometimes be replaced by an a-grade without the influence of a laryngeal, which might help to explain the vowels in class 6 [[Germanic strong verb|Germanic verbs]], for example.

==Subsequent development==
Although PIE had only this one, basically regular, ablaut sequence, the development in the daughter languages is frequently far more complicated, and few reflect the original system as neatly as Greek. Various factors, such as [[vowel harmony]], assimilation with nasals, or the effect of the presence of laryngeals in the Indo-European (IE) roots as well as their subsequent loss in most daughter languages, mean that a language may have several different vowels representing a single vowel in the parent language.

In particular, the zero grade was often subject to modification from changes in the pronunciation of syllabic sonorants. For example, in Germanic, syllabic sonorants acquired an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] ''-u-'', thus converting the original zero grade to a new "u-grade" in many words. Thus, while ablaut survives in some form in all Indo-European languages, it became progressively less systematic over time.

Ablaut explains vowel differences between related words of the same language. For example:
* English ''strike'' and ''stroke'' both come from the same IE root ''*streyg-''. The former comes from the e-grade, the latter from the o-grade.
* German ''Berg'' (hill) and ''Burg'' (castle) both come from the root ''*bʰergʰ-'', which presumably meant "high". The former comes from the e-grade, the latter from the zero-grade. (Zero-grade followed by ''r'' becomes ''ur'' in Germanic.)
Ablaut also explains vowel differences between cognates in different languages.
*English ''tooth'' comes from Germanic ''*tanþ-s'' (e.g. Old English ''tōþ'', Old High German ''zand''), genitive ''*tund-iz'' (Gothic ''tunþus'', but also ''aiƕa-tundi'' "thornbush", literally "horse-tooth"). This form is related to Latin ''dens, dentis'' and Greek ''{{lang|grc|ὀδούς}}, {{lang|grc|ὀδόντος}}'', with the same meaning, and is reflected in the English words ''dentist'' and ''orthodontic''. One reconstructed IE form is ''*dónts'', genitive ''*dn̥tés''. The consonant differences can be explained by regular sound shifts in primitive Germanic but not the vowel differences: by the regular laws of sound changes, Germanic ''a'' can originate from PIE ''o'', but ''un'' usually goes back to a syllabic ''n̥''.

:The explanation is that the Germanic and Greek nominative forms developed from the o-grade, the Latin word and the Germanic genitive from the zero-grade (in which syllabic ''n̥'' developed into ''en'' much in the same way as it became ''un'' in Germanic). Going a step further back, some scholars reconstruct ''*h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;dónts'', from the zero grade of the root ''*h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;ed-'' 'to eat' and the participal ''-ont-'' and explain it as 'the eating one'.
*English ''foot'' comes from the lengthened o-grade of ''*ped-''. Greek ''{{lang|grc|πούς}}, {{lang|grc|ποδός}}'' and Latin ''pes, pedis'' (compare English ''octopus'' and ''pedestrian''), come from the (short) o-grade and the e-grade respectively.

For the English-speaking non-specialist, a good reference work for quick information on IE roots, including the difference of ''ablaut'' grade behind related lexemes, is [[Calvert Watkins]], ''The American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots'', 2nd edition, Boston &amp; New York 2000.

(Note that in discussions of lexis, Indo-European roots are normally cited in the e-grade, without any inflections.)

==Grammatical function==
In PIE, there were already ablaut differences within the paradigms of verbs and nouns. These were not the main markers of grammatical form, since the inflection system served this purpose, but they must have been significant secondary markers.

An example of ablaut in the paradigm of the noun in PIE can be found in ''*pértus'', from which the English words ''ford'' and (via Latin) ''port'' are derived (both via the zero-grade stem ''*pr̥t-'').

::{| class="wikitable"

| suffix (t-u)
|-
| Nominative

| Genitive
| *pr̥-téw-s
| zero-grade
| e-grade
|-
| Dative
| *pr̥-téw-ey
| zero-grade

|}

An example in a verb is *bʰeydʰ- "to wait" (cf. "bide").

::{| class="wikitable"

|
|

|
|-
| Perfect (third-person singular)

| (note [[reduplication|reduplicating]] prefix)
|-
| Perfect (third plural)
| *bʰe-bʰidʰ-ḗr
| zero-grade
| (note reduplicating prefix)
|}

In the daughter languages, these came to be important markers of grammatical distinctions. The vowel change in the Germanic strong verb, for example, is the direct descendant of that seen in the Indo-European verb paradigm. Examples in modern English are the following:

::{| class="wikitable"
|-
| [[Infinitive]]
| [[Preterite]]
| [[Past participle]]
|-
| ''sing''
| ''sang''
| ''sung''
|-
| ''give''
| ''gave''
| ''given''
|-
| ''strive''
| ''strove''
| ''striven''
|-
| ''break''
| ''broke''
| ''broken''
|-
|}

It was in this context of Germanic verbs that ''ablaut'' was first described, and this is still what most people primarily associate with the phenomenon. A fuller description of ''ablaut'' operating in English, German and Dutch verbs and of the historical factors governing these can be found at the article [[Germanic strong verb]].

The same phenomenon is displayed in the verb tables of [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] and [[Sanskrit]]. Examples of ''ablaut'' as a grammatical marker in Latin are the vowel changes in the perfect stem of verbs.

::{| class="wikitable"

|
|-

| ''sēdī''
| "to sit"
| (vowel lengthening)
|-
| ''cadō''
| ''cecidī''
| "to fall"
| (note reduplicating prefix)
|-
|}

Ablaut can often explain apparently random irregularities. For example, the verb "to be" in Latin has the forms ''est'' (he is) and ''sunt'' (they are). The equivalent forms in German are very similar: ''ist'' and ''sind''. The same forms are present in Slavic languages: ''est'' and ''sut''.

The difference between singular and plural in these languages is easily explained: the PIE root is ''*h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;es-''. In the singular, the stem is stressed, so it remains in the e-grade, and it takes the inflection ''-ti''. In the plural, however, the inflection ''-énti'' was stressed, causing the stem to reduce to the zero grade: ''*h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;es-énti'' → ''*h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;s-énti''. See main article: [[Indo-European copula]].

Some of the morphological functions of the various grades are as follows:

e-grade:
* Present tense of thematic verbs; root stress.
* Present singular of athematic verbs; root stress.
* Accusative and vocative singular, nominative, accusative and vocative dual, nominative plural of nouns.

o-grade:
* Verbal nouns
# stem-stressed masculine action nouns (Greek ''gónos'' "offspring", Sanskrit ''jánas'' "creature, person"; Greek ''trókhos'' "circular course" &lt; "*act of running");
# ending-stressed feminine, originally collective, action nouns (Greek ''gonḗ'' "offspring", Sanskrit ''janā́'' "birth");
# ending-stressed masculine agent nouns (Greek ''trokhós'' "wheel" &lt; "*runner").
* Nominative, vocative and accusative singular of certain nouns ([[Proto-Indo-European nominals#Athematic and thematic nominals|acrostatic]] root nouns such as ''dṓm'', plural ''dómes'' "house"; [[Proto-Indo-European nominals#Athematic and thematic nominals|proterokinetic]] neuter nouns such as ''*wódr̥'' "water" or ''dóru'' "tree").
* Present tense of causative verbs; stem (not root) stress.
* Perfect singular tense.

zero-grade:
* Present dual and plural tense of athematic verbs; ending stress.
* Perfect dual and plural tense; ending stress.
* Past participles; ending stress.
* Some verbs in the aorist (the Greek thematic "second aorist").
* Oblique singular/dual/plural, accusative plural of nouns.

lengthened grade:
* Nominative singular of many nouns.
* Present singular of certain athematic verbs (so-called ''Narten-stem verbs'').
* Some verbs in the aorist.
* Some derived verbal nouns (so-called ''proto-vrddhi'').

Many examples of lengthened-grade roots in the daughter languages are actually caused by the effect of [[laryngeal theory|laryngeals]] and of [[Szemerényi's law]] and [[Stang's law]], which operated within Indo-European times.

==Novels==

===''InterWorld''===
{{main article|InterWorld}}

Joey Harker was a very average kid who discovered that his world was only one of an infinite alternate earths. Some of these earths were ruled by magic. Some were ruled by science. All were at war.
 
Joey teams up with alternate versions of himself from an array of these worlds. Together, the army of Joeys battled evil magicians Lord Dogknife and Lady Indigo from HEX and 01101 from Binary to keep the balance of power between all the earths stable.

===''The Silver Dream''===
{{main article|The Silver Dream}}

In this novel, Joey continues to struggle to find his place within the InterWorld organization, as he is still blamed for the death of a popular team member.  As the team begins to lose more and more ground to Hex and Binary, Joey encounters a mysterious young woman named Acacia Jones, whose powers to jump between dimensions seem to rival or even exceed his own—and who may not be working for the same ends that he is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaiman |first=Neil |url=http://www.harperteen.com/books/Silver-Dream/?isbn=9780062067968 |title=The Silver Dream: An InterWorld Novel by Neil Gaiman, Michael Reaves, Mallory Reaves |publisher=Harperteen.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Eternity's Wheel''===
{{main article|Eternity's Wheel}}

In his final adventure, Joey Harker is forced to be a leader as he had to step up to face the ultimate enemy who was the mastermind behind HEX and Binary if he has any hope of saving InterWorld, the multiverse, and everything in between.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.harpercollins.com/9780062067999/eternitys-wheel&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==

===Altiverse===
The novels are set in the ''Altiverse'', a 'portion' in the [[multiverse]] composed of a trillion alternate Earths. Whenever consciousness, not to be mixed with ego, has to make an important decision, the universe branches off in two directions.

The Altiverse is conceptualized as an arc. At one end science reigns, while at the other magic reigns. Our reality lies near the center a bit to the science side. The Altiverse has 3 factions fighting an eternal war. Science's region is mostly dominated by Binary ('01101'b). HEX is the magical cabal that controls the Magical regions. And InterWorld is a little guerrilla-like organization that fights to keep the other two groups in balance.

Besides parallel worlds the Altiverse has bizarre zones named ''Nowhere-at-all'', ''Static'' and ''In-Between''. They serve as the inter-plane bridge. The ''Nowhere-at-all'' is filled with Magic, while the ''Static'' has Science. Traveling from world to world takes weeks or days, except through the ''In-Between''. However, only Walkers can go there. The In-Between is also the place where strange multidimensional beings dwell. In any case, these zones aren't really understood.

===Walkers===
Walkers are special people with that possesses the gift of "walk" through realities. So far, the only known Walkers are Joseph Harker and all of his alternate counterparts.

==Characters==

===InterWorld===
{{expand list|date=September 2015}}

* Joseph "Joey" Harker: The main hero of the series. He is a 16-years old student who discovered the ability to "walk" between realities/dimensions.
* Hue: A "mudluff" (MDLF, short for "Multi-Dimendional Life-Form") that resembles a [[soap bubble]]. It becomes attached to Joey after he frees him from HEX.
* Jay Harker: A very professional agent of InterWorld who was killed trying to protect Joey from a giant Mudluff.
* Joe Harker / The Old Man: The oldest Joey in InterWorld, possibly the first. He has an artificial eye, which is a Binary construct of metal and glass. It may have many powers the reader is unaware of.

==In other media==
The idea of ''InterWorld'' surged on 1995, when Reeves was developing an animated series for [[DreamWorks]] while Gaiman was in London, working in the television series ''[[Neverwhere]]''. Originally being an idea for a possible television series, ''InterWorld'' ended up being a novel that was not shown until 2007.

On June 16, 2007, [[Neil Gaiman]] reported in his journal that [[DreamWorks Animation]] optioned the book to make it into an animated feature film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gaiman|first=Neil|url=http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2007/06/news-and-musing.html|title=News and musing|publisher=neilgaiman.com|date=2007-06-16|accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 21, 2016, the previous plans to make ''InterWorld'' a television series have become active once again by [[Universal Cable Productions]], in association with ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'' producer [[Jeffrey Seller]] and his partner Flody Suarez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Amato|first=Allan|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/20/interworld-tv-neil-gaiman-hamilton-producer|title=''Hamilton'' producer to develop TV adaption of Neil Gaiman's ''Interworld''|publisher=neilgaiman.com|date=2016-07-21|accessdate=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4830">'''Key Stage 2''' is the legal term for the four years of schooling in maintained schools in England and Wales normally known as Year 3, Year 4, Year 5 and Year 6, when the pupils are aged between 7 and 11 years.

==England and Wales==

===Legal definition===
The term is defined in the [[Education Act 2002]] as the period beginning at the same time as the school year in which the majority of pupils in a class attain the age of eight and ending at the same time as the school year in which the majority of pupils in a class attain the age of eleven.&lt;ref name=educationact&gt;Defined in section 82 of the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/32/section/82 Education Act 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;
This [[Key Stage]] normally covers pupils during [[junior school]]s, although in some cases part or all of this stage may fall in a [[Middle school|middle]], or a through [[primary school]].

===Purpose===
The term is used to define the group of pupils who must follow the relevant programmes of study from the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]]. All pupils in this Key Stage must follow a programme of education in these 12 areas:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum/key-stage-1-and-2&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[English language|English]]
*[[Mathematics]]
*[[Science]]
*[[Design technology|Design Technology]]
*[[History]]
*[[Geography]]
*[[Graphic design|Art and Design]]
*[[Music]]
*[[Physical education|Physical Education (PE) including swimming]]
*[[Computing]]
*[[Language education|Ancient and Modern Foreign Languages]]
*[[Religious Education]]*

Schools must provide Religious Education but *parents can ask for their children to be taken out of the whole lesson or part of it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum/key-stage-1-and-2&lt;/ref&gt; Optionally at this Key Stage, schools often teach [[PSHE|Personal, Social and Health education (PSHE)]] and/or citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum/key-stage-1-and-2&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of this stage, pupils aged 11 – in Year 6 – are tested as part of the national programme of [[National Curriculum assessment|National Curriculum Tests]], colloquially known as SATs. These tests cover English and Mathematics. The tests are externally marked, with results for each school being published in [[Department for Education|DfE]] performance tables.

==Northern Ireland==

===Legal definition===
The term is defined in The Education (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 as "the period beginning at the same time as the next school year after the end of key stage 1 and ending at the same time as the school year in which the majority of pupils in his class complete three school years in that key stage".&lt;ref name=NIact&gt;Defined in paragraph 3 of the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si2006/20061915.htm#3 Education (Northern Ireland) Order 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the foundation stage and [[Key Stage 1]] are defined as lasting for four years in total from the start of [[compulsory education]].  The Key Stage 2 is applied differently in [[Northern Ireland]] where it refers to pupils in P5, P6 and P7 (pupils aged 8 to 11). This is also the case in [[Education in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/FileManager/EN/Content_4943/chapter%204_1.pdf |title=Chapter 4: Contents of the Curriculum |publisher=Education Bureau of Hong Kong |accessdate=2009-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824072227/http://www.edb.gov.hk/FileManager/EN/Content_4943/chapter%204_1.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purpose===
The term is used to define the group of pupils who must follow the relevant programmes of study from the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]]. All pupils in this Key Stage must follow a programme of education in the six areas of learning in the curriculum.:&lt;ref name=ninc&gt;Set out on the [http://www.nicurriculum.org.uk/ Northern Ireland National Curriculum website]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21017">'''Land art''', variously known as '''Earth art''', '''environmental art''', and '''Earthworks''', is an [[art movement]] that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/l/land-art Tate, Art Terms, Land Art]&lt;/ref&gt; largely associated with Great Britain and the United States,&lt;ref name="Kastner"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=9rolepDS3dMC&amp;q=%22land+art%22&amp;dq=%22land+art%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtk6fb7tPUAhVJb1AKHVLMAswQ6AEIUDAJ Jeffrey Kastner, Brian Wallis: ''Land and Environmental Art''.

As a trend "Land art" expanded boundaries of art by the materials used and the siting of the works. The materials used were often the materials of the Earth including for instance the soil and rocks and vegetation and water found on-site, and the siting of the works were often distant from population centers. Though sometimes fairly inaccessible, photo documentation was commonly brought back to the urban art gallery.&lt;ref name="Dempsey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mymodernmet.com/andy-goldsworthy-land-art/ http://mymodernmet.com] Unexpected Land Art Beautifully Formed in Nature.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="la"&gt;[http://www.land-arts.com/Land_art.html http://www.land-arts.com] Land art.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns of the art movement centered around rejection of the commercialization of art-making and enthusiasm with an emergent ecological movement. The art movement coincided with the popularity of the rejection of urban living and its counterpart, an enthusiasm for that which is rural. Included in these inclinations were spiritual yearnings concerning the planet [[Earth]] as home to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;ArtSpeak, A Guide to Contemporary Ideas, Movements, and Buzzwords, 1945 to the Present, By Robert Atkins, Abbeville Press, 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-78921-150-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Micucci"&gt;[http://www.artandantiquesmag.com/2012/04/land-art-earthworks-postwar-american-art/ Dana Micucci, ''Land Art: Earthworks that Defined Postwar American Art'', Art &amp; Antiques]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s land art protested "ruthless commercialization" of art in [[United States|America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Natural Art|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XAn5hztDTggC|publisher = PediaPress}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, exponents of land art rejected the [[museum]] or [[Art museum|gallery]] as the setting of artistic activity and developed monumental landscape projects which were beyond the reach of traditional transportable [[sculpture]] and the commercial art market, although photographic documentation was often presented in normal gallery spaces. Land art was inspired by [[Minimalism (visual arts)|minimal art]] and [[conceptual art]] but also by modern movements such as [[De Stijl]], [[Cubism]], [[minimalism]] and the work of [[Constantin Brâncuși]] and [[Joseph Beuys]]. Many of the artists associated with land art had been involved with minimal art and [[conceptual art]]. [[Isamu Noguchi]]'s 1941 design for ''Contoured Playground'' in New York is sometimes interpreted as an important early piece of land art even though the artist himself never called his work "land art" but simply "sculpture". His influence on contemporary land art, [[landscape architecture]] and [[environmental sculpture]] is evident in many works today.&lt;ref name="Weilacher"&gt;Udo Weilacher, ''Between Landscape Architecture and Land Art''. Birkhäuser, 1999, Basel Berlin Boston 1999 {{ISBN|3-7643-6119-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Sonfist]] used an alternative approach to working with [[nature]] and [[culture]] by bringing historical nature and [[sustainable art]] back into New York City. His most inspirational work is ''Time Landscape'', an indigenous forest he planted in New York City.&lt;ref name="Weilacher" /&gt; He also created several other ''Time Landscapes'' around the world such as ''Circles of Time'' in Florence Italy documenting the historical usage of the land, and recently at the deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum outside Boston. According to critic [[Barbara Rose]], writing in ''[[Artforum]]'' in 1969, he had become disillusioned with the commodification and insularity of gallery bound art. In 1967, the [[art critic]] Grace Glueck writing in the ''[[New York Times]]'' declared the first earthwork was done by Douglas Leichter and Richard Saba at the [[Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture]]. The sudden appearance of land art in 1968 can be located as a response by a generation of artists mostly in their late twenties to the heightened political activism of the year and the emerging [[Natural environment|environmental]] and [[women's liberation]] [[Social movement|movement]]s.

One example of land art in the 20th century was a group exhibition created in 1968 at the Dwan Gallery &lt;!--"Dwan" is not a typo--&gt; in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leftmatrix.com/earthworks.html|title=Leftmatrix|publisher=leftmatrix.com|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1969, [[Willoughby Sharp]] curated the "Earth Art" exhibition at the [[Andrew Dickson White House|Andrew Dickson White Museum of Art]] at [[Cornell University]], Ithaca, New York. The artists included were [[Walter De Maria]], [[Jan Dibbets]], [[Hans Haacke]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[Neil Jenney]], [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]], [[David Medalla]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Robert Smithson]], and [[Gunther Uecker]]. The exhibition was directed by Thomas W. Leavitt. Gordon Matta-Clark, who lived in Ithaca at the time, was invited by Sharp to help the artists in "Earth Art" with the on-site execution of their works for the exhibition.

Perhaps the best known artist who worked in this genre was the [[United States|American]] [[Robert Smithson]] whose 1968 essay "The Sedimentation of the Mind: Earth Projects" provided a critical framework for the movement as a reaction to the disengagement of [[Modernism]] from social issues as represented by the critic [[Clement Greenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=QTq8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=%22land+art%22,+%22Clement+Greenberg%22,+smithson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP-sP09dPUAhXFKFAKHdrfB9oQ6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22land%20art%22%2C%20%22Clement%20Greenberg%22%2C%20smithson&amp;f=false Francis Frascina, ''Art, Politics and Dissent: Aspects of the Art Left in Sixties America''], Manchester University Press, 1999, p. 142, {{ISBN|0719044693}}&lt;/ref&gt; His best known piece, and probably the most famous piece of all land art, is the ''[[Spiral Jetty]]'' (1970), for which Smithson arranged rock, earth and [[algae]] so as to form a long (1500&amp;nbsp;ft) spiral-shape [[jetty]] protruding into [[Great Salt Lake]] in northern [[Utah]], [[United States|U.S.]]. How much of the work, if any, is visible is dependent on the fluctuating water levels. Since its creation, the work has been completely covered, and then uncovered again, by water. A steward of the artwork in conjunction with the Dia Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umfa.utah.edu/land_art_jetty_partnership|title=UMFA: Utah Museum of Fine Arts|first=Utah Museum of Fine|last=Arts|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018010058/http://umfa.utah.edu/land_art_jetty_partnership|archive-date=2016-10-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Utah Museum of Fine Arts]] regularly curates programming around the Spiral Jetty, including a "Family Backpacks" program.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://umfa.utah.edu/backpacks Family Backpacks] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018010115/http://umfa.utah.edu/backpacks |date=2016-10-18 }}". Utah Museum of Fine Arts. umfa.utah.org. July&amp;nbsp;30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Smithson's ''Gravel Mirror with Cracks and Dust'' (1968) is an example of land art existing in a [[art gallery|gallery]] space rather than in the natural environment. It consists of a pile of gravel by the side of a partially mirrored gallery wall. In its simplicity of form and concentration on the materials themselves, this and other pieces of land art have an affinity with [[minimalism]]. There is also a relationship to [[Arte Povera]] in the use of materials traditionally considered "unartistic" or "worthless". The Italian Germano Celant, founder of Arte Povera, was one of the first curator to promote Land Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obsart.blogspot.fr/2012/05/conceptual-art-arte-povera-land-art-it.html|title=Observatoire du Land Art|publisher=obsart.blogspot.fr|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Land Artists' have tended to be American,&lt;ref name="Kastner" /&gt; with other prominent artists in this field including, [[Carl Andre]], [[Alice Aycock]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[Hans Haacke]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[Nancy Holt]], [[Ana Mendieta]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Andrew Rogers (sculptor)|Andrew Rogers]], [[Charles Ross (artist)|Charles Ross]], [[Alan Sonfist]], and [[James Turrell]]. Turrell began work in 1972 on possibly the largest piece of land art thus far, reshaping the earth surrounding the extinct [[Roden Crater]] [[volcano]] in [[Arizona]]. Perhaps the most prominent non-American land artists are the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Chris Drury (artist)|Chris Drury]], [[Andy Goldsworthy]], [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]] and the Australian [[Andrew Rogers (sculptor)|Andrew Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daringdesigns.com/earthworks.htm|title=Monumental Land Art of the United States|publisher=daringdesigns.com|accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1973 [[Jacek Tylicki]] begins to lay out blank canvases or paper sheets in the natural environment for the nature to create art.

Some projects by the artists [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]] (who are famous for wrapping monuments, buildings and landscapes in [[textile|fabric]]) have also been considered land art by some, though the artists themselves consider this incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christojeanneclaude.net/errors.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030208060629/http://christojeanneclaude.net/errors.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2003-02-08|title=Common Errors|authors=Christo and Jeanne-Claude|publisher=Christojeanneclaude.net|accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joseph Beuys]]' concept of '[[social sculpture]]' influenced 'Land art' and his '[[7000 Eichen]]' project of 1982 to plant 7000 Oak trees has many similarities to 'Land art' processes. [[Andrew Rogers (sculptor)|Rogers]]' “Rhythms of Life” project is the largest contemporary land-art undertaking in the world, forming a chain of stone sculptures, or geoglyphs, around the globe – 12 sites – in disparate exotic locations (from below sea level and up to altitudes of 4,300 m/14,107&amp;nbsp;ft). Up to three geoglyphs (ranging in size up to 40,000 sq m/430,560 sq ft) are located in each site.

Eduardo Sanguinetti, the Latino-American philosopher and land-artist, presented in 1979 his "Sculptures in Earth". They were placed in natural spaces, they became functional as plants and animals made their homes in that particular topos installed in the La Pampa desert. Later, they acquired the noise of codes capable of classifying smells and colours, and will complete the original idea of our artist, who was at that time absorbed by the countryside and its specular radiation...in his Land-Art Performance "Solum" (1987), in the zoomorphy of that horse that greatly seduce the audience of the [[Centro Cultural Recoleta]] (ex Centro Cultural Ciudad de Buenos Aires). "Amarillo Total" the name of the horse, not only stopped the ecologic blow but also paraded the models who had been completely painted by our artist, their naked painted bodies put another body to painting, with artesan colours prepared with earth and plants pigments.&lt;ref&gt;Espartaco Carlos 1989, "Eduardo Sanguinetti: The Experience of Limits" pp. 86, 87 (Ediciones de Arte Gaglianone, first published 1989) {{ISBN|950-9004-98-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Sanguinetti's Essay "Alter Ego" (1986), he said: "Spontaneous Activity in Nature...In nature, there is a type of spontaneous activity. This concept does not exist in cultured man, and if it does remain in children, it is like a faint reminiscence of the primitive mind...Consequently I think that the survival of an awareness of the supernatural in nature, should, in all works of Land-Art, be the thing which "animates Everything".&lt;ref&gt;Sanguinetti Eduardo 1984, "Alter Ego" pag. 53, 54 (Pentland, Edinburgh, First Published in 1986 in the English languaje translated from the Spanish in 1986) {{ISBN|9780946270170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=prTwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=eduardo+sanguinetti&amp;dq=eduardo+sanguinetti&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5FbBUNXSI-610AGY44DoCQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw |title=Alter ego - Eduardo Sanguinetti - Google Libros |publisher=Books.google.com.ar |date=2011-11-29 |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Land artists in America relied mostly on wealthy [[patron]]s and [[private foundation]]s to fund their often costly projects. With the sudden economic down turn of the mid-1970s funds from these sources largely stopped. With the death of Robert Smithson in a plane crash in 1973 the movement lost one of its most important figureheads and faded out. Charles Ross continues to work on the Star Axis project, which he began in 1971. Michael Heizer continues his work on [[City (artwork)|City]], and James Turrell continues to work on the [[Roden Crater]] project. In most respects, "land art" has become part of mainstream [[public art]] and in many cases the term "land art" is misused to label any kind of art in nature even though conceptually not related to the [[avant-garde]] works by the pioneers of land art.

The Earth art of the 1960s were sometimes reminiscent the much older land works, [[Stonehenge]], the [[Pyramids]], [[Mound Builders|Native American mounds]], the [[Nazca Lines|Nazca Lines in Peru]], [[Carnac stones]] and [[List of burial mounds in the United States|Native American burial grounds]], and often evoked the spirituality of such archeological sites.&lt;ref name="Micucci" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dempsey" /&gt;

In recent years,{{when|date=September 2018}} celebrities have signed contracts with [[perfume]] houses to '''associate their name with a signature scent''', as a self-promotion campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mimifroufrou.com/scentedsalamander/celebrity_perfumes/ List of recent and historical celebrity perfume launches at The Scented Salamander]&lt;/ref&gt; The scents are then marketed; the association with the celebrity's name usually being the selling point of the campaign. Such products generally do not have the longevity of classic perfumes. A notable exception is "[[Curious (fragrance)|Curious]]", endorsed by [[Britney Spears]] and made and marketed by [[Elizabeth Arden]]. It was released in 2004 and has gone on to sell over 500 million bottles worldwide,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} "[[Fantasy (fragrance)|Fantasy]]" also being endorsed by Spears has had various remakes and have all sold substantial amounts{{clarify|date=May 2018}} internationally. Most notable would be "White Diamonds", endorsed by [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and made and marketed by [[Elizabeth Arden]]. It was still the best-selling celebrity-endorsed perfume 20 years after its introduction in 1991.{{cn|date=September 2018}}
&lt;!-- Please keep this list alphabetical and only add celebrities who have their own fragrances, not just people who have been the model for a particular scent.--&gt;

'''''Logan's Run''''' is a novel by [[William F. Nolan]] and [[George Clayton Johnson]]. Published in 1967, the novel depicts a [[Dystopia|dystopic]] [[Ageism|ageist]] future society in which both population and the consumption of resources are maintained in equilibrium by requiring the death of everyone reaching the age of 21.  The story follows the actions of Logan, a ''Sandman'' charged with enforcing the rule, as he tracks down and kills citizens who "run" from society's lethal demand—only to end up "running" himself.

==Plot summary==

The introduction to the book states:

{{Quote|&lt;poem&gt;The seeds of the Little War were planted in a restless summer during the mid-1960s, with [[sit-in]]s and student demonstrations as youth tested its strength. By the early 1970s over 75 percent of the people living on Earth were under 21 years of age. The population continued to climb—and with it the youth percentage.
In the 1980s the figure was 79.7 percent.
In the 1990s, 82.4 percent.
In the year 2000—[[Critical mass (sociodynamics)|critical mass]].&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In the world of 2116, a person's maximum age is strictly legislated: 21 years, to the day. When people reach this ''Lastday'' they report to a ''Sleepshop'' in which they are willingly executed via a pleasure-inducing toxic gas. A person's age is revealed by their ''palm flower'' crystal embedded in the palm of their right hand that changes color every seven years, yellow (age 0–6), then blue (age 7–13), then red (age 14–20), then blinks red and black on Lastday, and finally turns black at 21.

''Runners'' are those who refuse to report to a Sleepshop and attempt to avoid their fate by escaping to Sanctuary.  Logan 3 is a ''Deep Sleep Operative'' (also called ''Sandman'') whose job is to terminate Runners using a special weapon called simply, the 'gun', a handgun with selectable ordnance keyed to self-destruct if touched by an individual who is not the proper owner.

Runners are most terrified of a weapon called the 'Homer', which homes in on body heat, and deliberately ignites every pain nerve in the body, killing the target.

Sandmen practice Omnite, a hybrid type of [[martial arts]]. On his own Lastday, Logan becomes a Runner himself, in an attempt to infiltrate an apparent [[underground railroad]] for runners seeking Sanctuary—a place where they can live freely in defiance of society's dictates.

For most of the book, Logan is an [[antihero]]; however, his character develops a sympathy towards Runners, and he becomes more of a traditional hero figure.

Jessica 6, a contact Logan made after he chased her Runner brother, Doyle 10, into Cathedral, where he was killed by the vicious preteen "Cubs", helps him, despite her initial distrust of him.

Francis, another Sandman, and friend of Logan, catches up with Logan and Jessica after they've managed to make it to the final staging area before Sanctuary. He reveals he is actually the legendary Ballard, who's been helping arrange their escape. Francis tells them  he is actually 42,  but due to his faulty palm flower, which does not change colour and by use of plastic surgery shops, he has been able to disguise his true age and appearance.  He is working from within the system, as he believes the computer controlling the global infrastructure, buried beneath [[Crazy Horse Memorial|Crazy Horse]] Mountain, is beginning to malfunction, and the society will die with it.

Sanctuary turns out to be Argos, a previously abandoned [[Space habitat|space colony]] near [[Mars]].

Logan and Jessica escape to the colony on a rocket, which departs from a former space program launch site in Florida, as Ballard remains to help others escape.

==Sequels and spin-offs==
Nolan wrote two sequels, ''[[Logan's World]]'' and ''Logan's Search'', published after the film's release. There is also a novelette, ''Logan's Return'', that has been published as an [[e-book]].  Two other novels, ''Logan's Journey'' (written with Paul McComas) and ''Logan Falls'' (written with [[Jason V Brock]]), have been written, but not published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theworldoflogansrun.com/nolan08262010.htm|title=The World of Logan's Run|author=William F. Nolan|year=2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717043558/http://www.theworldoflogansrun.com/nolan08262010.htm|archivedate=July 17, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Logan's World'' deals with events following Logan's returning to Earth, amidst the survivors and ruins of the system he escaped in the first novel, while ''Logan's Search'' deals with Logan going to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] (with the assistance of [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]]) to once again stop the government system he escaped in the first novel, albeit with some minor changes.

George Clayton Johnson's long rumored personal sequel to ''Logan's Run'' titled ''Jessica's Run: A New Sequel for the Logan's Run Universe'' was said be "in development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbmtagency.com/about-us/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150204091256/http://www.wbmtagency.com/about-us/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-02-04|title=Jessica's Run}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was still in development at the time of George Clayton Johnson's death on [[Christmas day]] 2015.

==Reception==
[[David Pringle]] gave ''Logan's Run'' two stars out of four and praised the novel as "a good SF thriller"; he also stated it was superior to the film version.&lt;ref&gt;David Pringle,''The Ultimate Guide To Science Fiction''.New York: Pharos Books: St.Martins Press, 1990.{{ISBN|0886875374}} (p.185-6).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}

===Film===
{{Main|Logan's Run (film)}}
The novel was adapted in 1976 as a [[Logan's Run (1976 film)|film]], directed by [[Michael Joseph Anderson|Michael Anderson]] and starring [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]] as Logan 5 (not 3), [[Jenny Agutter]] as Jessica 6, and [[Richard Jordan]] as Francis 7. The film was produced by Saul David, a former MGM Executive and well-known science fiction supporter (having produced and developed ''Fantastic Voyage'' in 1966 at Fox, and developed ''Westworld'' at MGM). The film only uses the basic premise from the novel (everyone must die at a specific age, Logan runs with Jessica as his companion while being chased by Francis).

The film's world is a post apocalyptic, [[dystopian]] one, in which people now live inside a huge domed city and are unaware of the world outside, believing it to be a barren, poisonous environment. The motivations of the characters are also quite different; in the film, the age of death is 30, and instead of reporting to a Sleepshop, citizens must take part in a ritual called {{sic|"Carro|usel"}}&lt;!--please do not change "Carrousel" to "Carousel"; it is spelled as such on screen--&gt; in which they are incinerated &lt;!--"incinerated" is the correct term, as this is seen happening onscreen--&gt; with the chance of being "renewed". Logan is a 26-year-old Sandman, sent by the computer to find and destroy Sanctuary. The computer alters his palm flower (here called a "life clock") to show him as approaching Lastday, and he becomes a runner and escapes from the city.

Sanctuary turns out not to exist (it is revealed that Runners have actually been murdered by a malfunctioning food processing robot just outside the city), and the only other person that Logan and Jessica encounter outside the city is an old man ([[Peter Ustinov]]) who lives with a large number of cats in the Senate Chamber of the largely intact ruins of Washington, DC. Logan kills Francis, who is simply a Sandman in the movie and not a rebel leader, and leads the old man back to just outside the domed city, returning to try to lead a revolt against the culling. No one believes or listens to him or Jessica, and instead he is captured by Sandmen. In his interrogation by the computer, his information of there being no Sanctuary causes the computer to malfunction and self-destruct.

As the young population leave the confines of the burning and exploding domed city, they meet the old man outside — the first time they have seen anybody of that age.

====Remake====
Though a remake has not been produced as of May 2018, plans and updates regarding a remake have been discussed almost continuously from the mid-1990s until as recently as 2015.

In the mid-1990s, [[Warner Bros.]] began development of a [[remake]] of the movie.&lt;ref name="universe"&gt;{{cite news | author=Michael McCarty | url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue260/interview.html | title=''Logan's Run'' creator William F.

Singer had begun working with production designer Guy Dyas from his previous film ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]''.  Screenwriters Ethan Gross and Paul Todisco were hired to write the script with the director, with the film being slated for a 2005 release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Michael Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117901259.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 | title=Warners on the 'Run' | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=March 4, 2004 | accessdate=April 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October, the director said he had begun [[previsualization]] of ''Logan's Run'', which would be completed by the time he finished production of his project at the time, ''[[Superman Returns]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Capone | url=http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=18610 | title=Capone interviews Bryan Singer – Talk of SUPERMAN, X3, LOGAN'S RUN &amp; Fox's TV show HOUSE... &amp; Hugh Laurie talks too!!! | publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]] | date=October 12, 2004 | accessdate=April 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following December, screenwriter [[Dan Harris (screenwriter)|Dan Harris]] said that he and the director had turned in a first draft for ''Logan's Run''.  Harris said that further development of the project would take place in Sydney after production for ''Superman Returns'', for which he also collaborated, was finalized.  The screenwriter said that the remake would contain more action than the original film, describing the premise to be "a remake of the concept of the movie plus the book".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Jeff Otto | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/570/570528p1.html | title=Dan Harris Talks ''Superman'' | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=December 2, 2004 | accessdate=April 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2006, production offices for ''Logan's Run'' were taken over by the production for the 2008 [[box office bomb]] ''[[Speed Racer (film)|Speed Racer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15897 | title=Wachowski's Speed Racer Awaits Green Light  | publisher=ComingSoon.net | date=August 6, 2006 | accessdate=April 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2007, producer Joel Silver reiterated his plan to remake the original film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070403/ennew_afp/entertainmentusfilm_070403202832 | title='Matrix' producer plans remake of sci-fi classic | publisher=[[Yahoo!

Sexton.  Kosinski had made a presentation to Warner Bros. including graphic art and animated previsualization that illustrated his plan for the film, whose low budget appealed to the studio. No progress was made, and Kosinski moved on to make ''[[Tron: Legacy]]'' (2010).

In May and June 2010, Carl Erik Rinsch was hired to direct and screenwriter [[Alex Garland]] was hired to write the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Jeff Leins | url=http://www.newsinfilm.com/2010/06/17/alex-garland-to-write-rinschs-logans-run/ | title=Alex Garland to Write Rinsch's 'Logan's Run' | publisher=News in Film | date=June 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rinsch ultimately pulled out of the project due to scheduling conflicts.&lt;ref name=Rinsch&gt;{{cite news|title=Carl Rinsch No Longer Directing 'Logan's Run'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/heat-vision/carl-rinsch-no-longer-directing-44947|accessdate=July 6, 2012|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=November 12, 2010|author=Borys Kit}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2011, [[Denmark|Danish]] filmmaker [[Nicolas Winding Refn]] was attached to direct the remake starring actor [[Ryan Gosling]] and [[Rose Byrne]] with screenwriter Andrew Baldwin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blastr.com/2011/08/want-a-wonder-woman-movie.php Blastr.com ([[Syfy]]) - ''"Want a Wonder Woman movie?

The '''Martín Fierro Awards'''  ({{lang-es|Premios Martín Fierro}}) is the name of the most prominent awards for [[Argentine]] radio and television, granted by APTRA, the Association of Argentine Television and Radio Journalists. The awards were first given in 1959, limited to television. The next year, the awards adopted its current name, after [[José Hernández (writer)|José Hernández']] [[epic poem]] ''[[Martín Fierro]]'' (considered by some as the [[national epic]] of Argentina). It was embodied on a statuette of a [[gaucho]], by sculptor Luis Perlotti, weighing over {{convert|2|kg|lb|0}}.&lt;ref name="APTRA history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historia de la institución|url=http://www.aptra.org.ar/a/historia|website=APTRA|publisher=Asociación de Periodistas de la Televisión y Radiofonía Argentina|accessdate=14 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412170125/http://www.aptra.org.ar/a/historia|archivedate=25 October 2012|location=Buenos Aires, Argenting|language=Spanish|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the award began, the sole television station in the country was Channel 7. As the media outlets grew, the awards expanded to incorporate media from throughout the country.&lt;ref name="years and awards"&gt;{{cite news|title=Premios Martín Fierro|url=http://www.isaproduccion.com.ar/sociedad/12413-premios-martin-fierro.html|accessdate=14 June 2015|publisher=ISA Produccion|date=2 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614023248/http://www.isaproduccion.com.ar/sociedad/12413-premios-martin-fierro.html|archivedate=14 Jun 2015|location=Argentina|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, radio productions were included in the awards for the first time.&lt;ref name="La Nacion"&gt;{{cite news|title=Un premio con una extensa historia|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1607230-un-premio-con-una-extensa-historia|accessdate=14 June 2015|publisher=La Nacion|date=4 August 2013|location=Buenos Aires, Argentina|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowaday there is a special rotating venue, honoring the winners from all the [[Provinces of Argentina|Provinces]].&lt;ref name="years and awards" /&gt;

Because of the censorship and persecution of artists carried over during the 1976-83 [[Proceso de Reorganización Nacional|military dictatorship]], the membership of APTRA dwindled and the awards were suspended. It was not until 1988 that the award was revived. Since 1990, it has also included special productions for [[cable television|cable networks]] and -in 1992- the Golden ''Martín Fierro'' was added to honor the "best of the best". In 2004, the voting became computerized to make it both more secure and simpler, as well as allowing voting to take place immediately before broadcasting.&lt;ref name="APTRA history" /&gt;

==Inaugural awards==
The first year the awards were given, 1959, the ceremony took place at the Cervantes National Theater and the inductees included:&lt;ref name="years and awards" /&gt;

==Special awards==
{{see also|List of Golden Martín Fierro Award winners}}
In 1991 [[APTRA]] created a special award, the Golden Martín Fierro award. It is given to a single person or production in the annual ceremony, and it is intended as a prize to trajectory or to outstanding quality. The first winner was the host show "Fax", and the most recent one the TV series ''[[Farsantes]]''. A second main prize, the Platinum Martín Fierro Award, was added in 2009, per the 50th anniversary of APTRA. The first winner of it was [[Mirtha Legrand]].

== About ==
The Medical Heritage Library (MHL) is a [[digital curation]] collaborative among several medical libraries which promotes  free and open access to quality historical resources in medicine. The MHL is currently digitizing books and journals and is working to expand to the digitization of archival materials and still images. In 2010, the MHL began digitizing titles, mainly monographs, in a variety of medical history and related fields including [[chemistry]], nursing, dentistry, audiology, [[physiology]], psychology, psychiatry, biological science, hydrotherapy, weather, [[veterinary medicine]], gardening, physical culture, and [[alternative medicine]] chosen for their scholarly, educational, and research value. Since the inception of the project, materials in audio and video formats have been added to the collection.

== Goals ==
'''The MHL works to:'''
# Develop an organizational structure that will ensure sustainability of MHL activities 
# Increase institutional membership to ensure rich content contributions and international coverage
# Seek and exploit collaborative opportunities with users, creators, contributors, and peer digital libraries that further the MHL’s work
# Develop methodologies and projects that measure the impact and evaluate the benefits of the Medical Heritage Library to the communities it serves
# Develop and promote tools to enhance discovery and use of content by exposing linkages among the content across partner repositories and across formats 
# Develop means to match archaic medical terminology to current terminology in order to expose the relevance of medical historical content to current medical practice, teaching, and research
# Develop access and content management strategies that align with one or more existing large-scale digital projects such as HathiTrust, the Digital Public Library of America and the Biodiversity Heritage Library
# Incorporate preservation as a requirement for future content development
# Continue to improve access to the collection
# Provide leadership regarding access and privacy issues unique to medical content in order to enable access in compliance with applicable ethical, legal, and regulatory codes

== Library Scope and History ==
The MHL maintains a [http://www.medicalheritage.org/ blog], Twitter [https://twitter.com/MedicalHeritage account], and Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/medicalheritagelibrary page] to interact with researchers, librarians, archivists, students, and the interested general public about the MHL collections, the history of medicine, digital humanities, and related topics.

The MHL began digitization of monographs in 2010 with an [https://web.archive.org/web/20140808045833/http://www.medicalheritage.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Watermark-2010.pdf initial grant] from the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation|Sloan Foundation]]. Work on the MHL project has continued with funding support from collaborating institutions, the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20131023055811/http://www.medicalheritage.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/NEH-announcement.pdf announcement]), and the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation|Mellon Foundation]] via a program administered by the Council on Library and Information Resources ([https://web.archive.org/web/20131023055136/http://www.medicalheritage.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Countway-and-Hopkins-Receive-Mellon-Foundation-Grant.pdf announcement]). All digitized works are located at the [https://archive.org/details/medicalheritagelibrary Internet Archive].

The collection includes books, pamphlets, journals, and video and audio recordings in the history of medicine and related fields. A working list of [https://archive.org/browse.php?field=subject&amp;mediatype=texts&amp;collection=medicalheritagelibrary subject headings] is available here. Titles have been chosen for their scholarly, educational, and research value. The MHL consults with a volunteer group of scholars in the history of medicine and related fields and surveys its users regularly. As of August 2014, the collection consists of nearly 60,000 items including monographs, journals, audio and video on topics including [[surgery]], public health, [[infectious diseases]], [[gynecology]], psychology, [[anatomy]], [[neuroscience]], tobacco, and homeopathy.

The MHL has created a full-text search tool for use by researchers.&lt;ref&gt;http://mhl.countway.harvard.edu/search&lt;/ref&gt; The tool allows users to search the full-text of one or more items simultaneously. The tool is in an extended beta release and comments or questions are welcome!

The [http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2014/WTP056966.htm UK Medical Heritage Library] started in 2014 with nine digitisation partners in England and Scotland, including [UCL] (University College London), the [University of Leeds], the [University of Glasgow], the [London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine], [King's College London], and the [University of Bristol] - along with the libraries of the [Royal College of Physicians of London], the [Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh], and the [Royal College of Surgeons of England]. The original partnership is between the [Wellcome Library] and [Jisc]. Material digitized by the UK MHL project is also available through the MHL portal at the Internet Archive and searchable through the full-text search tool described above.

Towards the end of the second season, Hannah used Indiegogo to raise $25,000 within a month in order to kick-start her roadshow, "Hello, Harto!". She successfully raised $36,000 in four hours and made plans to continue filming "My Drunk Kitchen" on the road. While the roadshow featured Hannah's comedy skits, the show was also used to attract viewers to help volunteer in local food operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunn |first=Gaby |url=http://www.dailydot.com/news/hannah-harto-hart-my-drunk-kitchen-indiegogo/ |title=Hannah Hart crowdfunds "My Drunk Kitchen" tour |publisher=The Daily Dot |date=January 3, 2013 |accessdate=November 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1919">The '''Ntoro''' is the spiritual-genetic aspect of the father which the [[Akan people]] believe is passed on to his children. These 12 Ntoro are considered inherited deities (spirits) who govern guide and protect their 12 clans patrilineally. The Akan believe that the Ntoro does not die with the father. Instead, it is passed down to the man’s children, or if the children are not alive, to his nephews and nieces. The father's Ntoro represents the being of the child until the child [[Coming of age|comes of age]]. At this point the Ntoro along with the [[Sunsum]] and [[Kra (Mythology)|Kra]] explains how one interacts in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Gyekye Kwame; An essay on African philosophical thought: the Akan conceptual scheme 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ntoro is thus explained by Akans to be the father's characteristics and spiritual traits which can be inherited. Thus, it is the cooperation of the father's Ntoro with the mother's blood (Mogya) [[Abusua]] which is believed to form the child and mold into the Human being.&lt;ref&gt;Asante Molefi; African Intellectual Heritage 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the upper bottom of the lamp holder was engraved with the inscription"长信尚浴，容一升少半升，重六斤，百八十九，今内者卧" (some Chinese characters). The handwriting of the inscription is too illegible, it may have been carved later, so the "长信尚浴" does not seem to be the first owner of the lamp. The original owner should be first carved, and the handwriting is neatly, so the six parts of the lamp body which was carved with "阳信家" illustrated that the lamp is originally belongs to the "阳信家".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4571">'''Ponding''' is the (typically) unwanted pooling of water, typically on a [[flat roof]] or roadway. Ponding water accelerates the deterioration of many materials, including seam adhesives in single-ply roof systems, steel equipment supports, and particularly roofing asphalt. On low-slope asphalt roofs, ponding water allows the oil solvent components of the asphalt to leach out and evaporate, leaving the roof membrane brittle and susceptible to cracking and leaking in the ponding location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbdg.org/design/env_roofing.php|title=Building Envelope Design Guide - Roofing Systems {{!}} Whole Building Design Guide|website=www.wbdg.org|access-date=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Most flat roof systems (properly called "low-slope roof systems") are designed with a slight pitch to shed water off the sides, usually into gutters, [[scuppers]], internal drains, or a combination of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33244913|title=Manual of low-slope roof systems|last=1925-|first=Griffin, C. W. (Charles William),|date=1996|publisher=McGraw-Hill|others=Fricklas, R. L., Griffin, C. W. (Charles William), 1925-|year=|isbn=9780070247840|edition= 3rd|location=New York|pages=Chapter 3: Draining the Roof|oclc=33244913}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a scupper or drain is clogged or fails for other reasons, storm water tends to pool around that low area.  Over time, with each passing storm, the weight of the storm water will deflect the structural system beyond the structure's [[bending]] point, thus allowing a bigger puddle to form.  As a bigger puddle forms more weight is applied to the structural system causing more bending, allowing an even bigger puddle, then more weight, until the structure fails.&lt;ref&gt;"Investigation, analysis and design of an experiment to test ponding loads on flexible roof systems" by Duncan Stark, published by Oregon State University, June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction codes==
In the construction industry, the [[National Roofing Contractors Association]] (NRCA) defines roof ponding as "water that remains on a roof surface longer than 48 hours after the termination of the most recent rain event".&lt;ref&gt;"The Evils of Ponding Water" October 31, 2009, by Paul Graham&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sheltonroofing.com|title=Extensive Range of Single Ply Roofing and Waterproofing Systems|publisher=William Carey|access-date=2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2009 [[International Building Code]] Chapter 15 "Roof Assemblies and Roof Top Structures" &amp; Chapter 16 "Structural Design"; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When scuppers are used for secondary (emergency overflow) roof drainage, the quantity, size, location and inlet elevation of the scuppers shall be sized to prevent the depth of '''ponding water''' from exceeding that for which the roof was designed&amp;nbsp;... '''Ponding instability.''' For roofs with a slope less than 1/4 inch per foot [1.19 degrees (0.0208 rad)], the design calculations shall include verification of adequate stiffness to preclude progressive deflection in accordance with Section 8.4 of ASCE 7."&lt;ref&gt;2009 international building code, by International Code Council in Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Ponding on land==
When water is diverted into a lower area that has no outlet or is not suitable for drainage, water will begin to pool, and over time the weight of the water will create a deeper pool, allowing more water to sit, eventually creating a permanent water feature.  Some municipalities recognize this as an issue on private land, such as the City of [[Indianapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indy.gov/eGov/City/DPW/Residential/Drainage/Pages/ponding.aspx indy.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other municipalities see this as a great concern, such as the [[Kapiti Coast District]], [[New Zealand]] where, "groundwater ponding is a chronic problem, that results in damp housing and waterlogged sections. The damage that it causes is less apparent than the damaging events associated with floods, but the duration of groundwater ponding, which can last for several months, makes it a serious issue for those affected".&lt;ref&gt;Urban planning - managing surface water and groundwater ponding" by Michelle Malcolm, Craig Martell, and Brydon Hughes, Sinclair Knight Merz Ltd. Kapiti Coast District Council 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Ponding that forms on paved surfaces, like streets or parking lots that are not properly pitched, will cause issues such as deep puddles and [[crocodile cracking]].

'''''Portal Stories: Mel''''' is a single-player [[mod (video gaming)|mod]] of ''[[Portal 2]]'' developed by [[Prism Studios]]. The mod was released on June 25, 2015, for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]] and [[Linux]] systems, available freely to users who own ''Portal 2'' on [[Steam (software)|Steam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2015/01/31/fan-made-portal-2-mod-looks-good-enough-to-be-from-valve.aspx | title = Fan Made Portal 2 Mod Looks Good Enough To Be From Valve | first =Kyle | last =Hillard | date = 2015-01-31 | accessdate =  2015-05-10 | work = [[Game Informer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
{{main|Portal (video game series)#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay in the Portal series}}
Like ''Portal 2'', ''Portal Stories: Mel'' is a [[Platform game#Puzzle platformers|puzzle-platform]] game played from the first-person perspective as the player-character Mel. Shortly into the game's story, the player acquires a prototype version of a portal gun, which allows the player to create a connected opening on two different flat surfaces. This allows for accessing out-of-reach areas, passing objects, light, laser beams, and other matter through the portals, and using the portals as a means of "flinging" Mel or other objects across a level. These lead the player to various puzzle chambers that are required to be solved in order to access the exit point and proceed forward. The player-character can die by being shot repeatedly by automated turrets, falling into contaminated water, and other similar environmental hazards, but this will simply return the player-character to a previous checkpoint. ''Portal Stories: Mel'' adds a few new features such as water putting out fire, electrified water and a deadly version of the emancipation grill as well as using familiar puzzle elements from previous games in new ways, such as tractor beams, light bridges, and paint gels. There are a total of 22 levels in the game which the developers expect would take players from 6 to 10 hours to complete.&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/06/portal-stories-mel-is-a-free-prologue-mod-to-portal-2 | title = Portal Stories: Mel is a  Free Prologue Mod to Portal 2 | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = July 6, 2015 | accessdate = July 30, 2015 | first = Cassidee | last = Moser }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
The mod starts when Mel, an Olympian from the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] (said to have taken place in [[Nuremberg]] rather than [[Berlin]]), arrives by tram at the Aperture: Science Innovators headquarters in Michigan. She then enters the massive underground complex as a volunteer test subject on October 14, 1952. Aperture's CEO, [[Cave Johnson (Portal)|Cave Johnson]], speaks to Mel through prerecorded messages via intercom, informing her that she will take part in one of their smaller tests, the Aperture Innovators Short Term Relaxation Vault.

After the test goes wrong and she is put in suspension for decades, Mel is woken up and finds much of the facility in disrepair. She encounters a Cave Johnson impersonator telling her nothing is wrong and that she is still in 1952. Later on, it is revealed that the voice talking to her is a maintenance core named Virgil, who offers to help her escape from the facility if she helps him get back on a management rail he fell off of. After helping her to obtain the portal gun, Virgil guides Mel through the remnants of the old facility, explaining that the destruction of [[GLaDOS]] (from the events of ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'') has caused most of the control systems in the facility to falter.

They continue upwards but learn that due to the reserve power coming on, a prototype security system, '''AEGIS''' ('''A'''perture '''E'''mployee '''G'''uardian and '''I'''ntrusion '''S'''ystem), has become active in the absence of GLaDOS and is tracking them through the facility, trying to eliminate them after mistaking them first as unregistered life forms then as potential threats to the long dead scientists. Virgil realizes the only way for Mel to escape is to disable AEGIS.

After traveling through some old and overgrown test chambers, the duo eventually arrive at AEGIS's central core. After a battle with the AI, Mel enters the code to shut down AEGIS, but not before finding out that AEGIS was attempting to destroy GLaDOS as well. Virgil leads Mel to the elevator, has her destroy the portal gun, and says his goodbyes as she ascends to the surface. Mel opens a door leading to the outside world to find the same town she walked through decades ago to get to Aperture both modernized and in ruins.

In a post-credits scene, AEGIS has enough power left to initiate one final fail-safe: waking up the test subject Chell, the main protagonist of the Portal games, by draining the reserve power so she can escape, setting up the events of ''Portal 2''.

==Development==
''Portal Stories: Mel'' was developed over the course of four years by a small independent team of fans under the name [[Prism Studios]].&lt;ref name="wapost"/&gt; Development for the mod started in May 2011, and the mod was originally intended to launch early 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Portal Stories: Mel : Coming soon! news|url = http://www.moddb.com/mods/portalstories/news/portal-stories-mel-coming-soon|website = Mod DB|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several delays, on March 21, 2013, it was announced that the focus would be changed primarily to quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Progress! news - Portal Stories : Mel mod for Portal 2|url = http://www.moddb.com/mods/portalstories/news/progress167|website = Mod DB|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, the development team had completely changed.

{{Postmodernism}}{{History of Western art music}}
'''Postmodern music''' is either simply music of the [[Postmodernity|postmodern era]], or music that follows aesthetical and philosophical trends of [[postmodernism]]. As the name suggests, the postmodernist movement formed partly in reaction to [[modernism]]. Even so, postmodern music still does not primarily define itself in opposition to [[Modernism (music)|modernist music]]; this label is applied instead by critics and theorists.

Postmodern music is not a distinct musical style, but rather refers to music of the postmodern era. The terms "postmodern", "postmodernism", "postmodernist", and "postmodernity" are exasperating terms {{harv|Bertens|1995|loc=3}}. Indeed, postmodernists question the tight definitions and categories of academic disciplines, which they regard simply as the remnants of modernity {{harv|Rosenau|1992|loc=6–7}}.

==The postmodernist musical attitude==
Postmodernism in music is not a distinct musical style, but rather refers to music of the [[Postmodernity|postmodern era]]. Postmodernist music, on the other hand, shares characteristics with [[postmodern art|postmodernist art]]—that is, art that comes after and reacts against [[modernism]] (see [[Modernism (music)|Modernism in Music]]).

[[Fredric Jameson]], a major figure in the thinking on [[postmodernism]] and culture, calls postmodernism "the cultural dominant of the logic of late capitalism" {{harv|Jameson|1991|loc=46}}, meaning that, through globalization, postmodern culture is tied inextricably with capitalism (Mark Fisher, writing 20 years later, goes further, essentially calling it the sole cultural possibility {{harv|Fisher|2009|loc=4}}). Drawing from Jameson and other theorists, David Beard and Kenneth Gloag argue that, in music, postmodernism is not just an attitude but also an inevitability in the current cultural climate of fragmentation {{harv|Beard and Gloag|2005|loc=141–45}}. As early as 1938, [[Theodor W. Adorno|Theodor Adorno]] had already identified a trend toward the dissolution of "a culturally dominant set of values" {{harv|Beard and Gloag|2005|loc=141}}, citing the commodification of all genres as beginning of the end of genre or value distinctions in music {{harv|Adorno|2002|loc=293–95}}.

In some respects, Postmodern music could be categorized as simply the music of the postmodern era, or music that follows aesthetic and philosophical trends of postmodernism, but with Jameson in mind, it is clear these definitions are inadequate. As the name suggests, the postmodernist movement formed partly in reaction to the ideals of [[modernism]], but in fact postmodern music is more to do with functionality and the effect of globalization than it is with a specific reaction, movement, or attitude {{harv|Beard and Gloag|2005|loc=142}}. In the face of capitalism, Jameson says, "It is safest to grasp the concept of the postmodern as an attempt to think the present historically in an age that has forgotten how to think historically in the first place" {{harv|Jameson|1991|loc=ix}}.

[[Jonathan Kramer]] posits the idea (following [[Umberto Eco]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]]) that postmodernism (including ''musical'' postmodernism) is less a surface style or historical period (i.e., condition) than an ''attitude''. Kramer enumerates 16 (arguably subjective) "characteristics of postmodern music, by which I mean music that is understood in a postmodern manner, or that calls forth postmodern listening strategies, or that provides postmodern listening experiences, or that exhibits postmodern compositional practices." According to {{harvtxt|Kramer|2002|loc=16–17}}, postmodern music:

# is not simply a repudiation of modernism or its continuation, but has aspects of both a break and an extension
# is, on some level and in some way, ironic
# does not respect boundaries between sonorities and procedures of the past and of the present
# challenges barriers between 'high' and 'low' styles
# shows disdain for the often unquestioned value of structural unity
# questions the mutual exclusivity of elitist and populist values
# avoids totalizing forms (e.g., does not want entire pieces to be tonal or serial or cast in a prescribed formal mold)
# considers music not as autonomous but as relevant to cultural, social, and political contexts
# includes quotations of or references to music of many traditions and cultures
# considers technology not only as a way to preserve and transmit music but also as deeply implicated in the production and essence of music
# embraces contradictions
# distrusts binary oppositions
# includes fragmentations and discontinuities
# encompasses pluralism and eclecticism
# presents multiple meanings and multiple temporalities
# locates meaning and even structure in listeners, more than in scores, performances, or composers

[[Daniel Albright]] summarizes the main tendencies of musical postmodernism as {{harv|Albright|2004|loc=12}}:
#[[Bricolage#Music|Bricolage]]
#[[Polystylism]]
#[[Aleatoric music|Randomness]]

==Timescale==
One author has suggested that the emergence of postmodern music in popular music occurred in the late 1960s, influenced in part by [[psychedelic rock]] and one or more of the later [[The Beatles|Beatles]] albums {{harv|Sullivan|1995|loc=217}}. Beard and Gloag support this position, citing Jameson's theory that "the radical changes of musical styles and languages throughout the 1960s [are] now seen as a reflection of postmodernism" ({{harvnb|Beard and Gloag|2005|loc=142}}; see also {{harvnb|Harvey|1990}}). Others have placed the beginnings of postmodernism in the arts, with particular reference to music, at around 1930 ({{harvnb|Karolyi|1994|loc=135}}; {{harvnb|Meyer|1994|loc=331–32}}).

==History==
The application was developed by two former [[GMW Architects|GMW Computers]] employees who had been involved with  Sonata. After Sonata had "disappeared in a mysterious, corporate black hole, somewhere in eastern Canada in 1992,"&lt;ref name=Crotty71&gt;Crotty, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Ingram and colleague Gerard Gartside then went on to develop Reflex, bought for $30 million by Parametric Technology Corporation ([[PTC (software company)|PTC]]) in July 1996.&lt;ref name=Crotty71 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Parametric+Technology+Corporation+acquires+object-oriented+software...-a018490068 Parametric Technology Corporation acquires object-oriented software technology for project modeling and management] PTC news release dated 11 July 1996 (archived at FreeLibrary.com). Retrieved: 17 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

PTC had identified the architecture, engineering and construction market as a target for its parametric modelling solutions, and bought Reflex to expand into the sector. However, the fit between Reflex and PTC's existing solutions was poor, and PTC's Pro/Reflex gained little market traction; PTC then sold the product to another US company, [[The Beck Group|Beck Construction]], in 1997,&lt;ref name=Crotty72&gt;Crotty, p.72&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Some accounts of the date of this transaction vary: Beck Technology, originally an internal group within Beck Construction, says it acquired the intellectual property rights to Reflex from PTC in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beck-technology.com/about_us.html Beck Technology: About us], Beck Technology. Accessed: 17 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;}} where it formed the kernel of a parametric estimating package called DESTINI.&lt;ref name=Weisberg /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobilitytechzone.com/news/2006/12/19/2179097.htm BIM software integrates RSMeans for project costing], ''Mobility Techzone'', December 19, 2006. Retrieved: 17 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, several people from PTC set up a new company, Charles River Software (renamed [[Autodesk Revit|Revit]] Technology Corporation in 2000, later (2002) bought by [[Autodesk]]).&lt;ref name=Crotty72 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weisberg&gt;Weisberg, David (2008), ''The Engineering Design Revolution: The People, Companies and Computer Systems That Changed Forever the Practice of Engineering''. Chapter 16. Available [http://cadhistory.net/ online]. Retrieved: 17 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonid Raiz]] and [[Irwin Jungreis]] obtained from PTC a non-exclusive, source code development license for Reflex as part of their severance package. In the words of Jerry Laiserin: "While Autodesk Revit may not contain genomic snippets of Reflex code, Revit clearly is spiritual heir to a lineage of BIM 'begats' — RUCAPS begat Sonata, Sonata begat Reflex, and Reflex begat Revit."&lt;ref&gt;Laiserin, J. (2003) "[http://laiserin.com/features/issue17/feature02.php LaiserinLetterLetters]" (see Laiserin's comment to letter from John Mullan), ''The Laiserin Letter'', January 06 2003.{{unreliable source?|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 letter to ''AEC Magazine,'' Jungreis said:
:"After receiving several hours of instruction in the software architecture of Reflex from Reflex developers, we decided not to use it as our starting point because of several important differences at the very foundations of the software. At that point, we put it aside and never looked at it again. ... Revit was not based on Reflex. No code from Reflex was used...."&lt;ref name="AECM-25May2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Celebrating the history of BIM (In response to this article, Dr. Irwin Jungreis, one of the founders of Revit, submitted a letter to AEC Magazine, reproduced in full.)|url=http://aecmag.com/59-features/1352-celebrating-the-history-of-bim|accessdate=21 August 2017|work=AEC Magazine|date=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Vardar Macedonia==
[[File:Serbia after Balkan Wars.jpg|thumb|Territorial expansion of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] after the 1913.]]
The region of present-day Republic of Macedonia until 1912 was part of the Ottoman Empire. According to [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica 1911 Edition]], at the beginning of the 20th century the Slavs constituted the majority of the population in Macedonia. Per Britannica itself the bulk of the Slavs there was regarded by almost all independent sources as "[[Bulgarians]]". Immediately after [[annexation]] of [[Vardar Macedonia]] to the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], the [[Macedonian Slavs]] were faced with the policy of forced serbianisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=ZMyZdvTympMC |page=123 |title=Dejan Djokić, Yugoslavism: histories of a failed idea, 1918–1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=SGnKpNf2RbAC |page=20 |title=R. J. Crampton, Eastern Europe in the twentieth century—and after }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|We find here, as everywhere else, the ordinary measures of "Serbization" — the closing of schools, disarmament, invitations to schoolmasters to become Servian officials, nomination of "[[Serbomans]]", "[[Grecomans]]" and Vlachs, as village headmen, orders to the clergy of obedience to the Servian Archbishop, acts of violence against influential individuals, prohibition of transit, multiplication of requisitions, forged signatures to declarations and patriotic telegrams, the organization of special bands, military executions in the villages and so forth.&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/reportofinternat00inteuoft |title=Report of the International Commission to Inquire into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan War |publisher=archive.org|accessdate=2015-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;''|[[Report of the International Commission on the Balkan Wars]].}}

Those who declare as the [[Bulgarians]] were, harassed or deported to Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;[[Report of the International Commission to Inquire into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars]] (p. 52)&lt;/ref&gt; The high clergymen of [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] were also deported.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Report of the International Commission to Inquire into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars]] (p. 165)&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgarian schools were closed and teachers expelled. The population of Macedonia was forced to declare as Serbs. Those who refused were beaten and tortured.&lt;ref&gt;[[Report of the International Commission to Inquire into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars]] (p. 53)&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent people and teachers from [[Skopje]] who refused to declare as Serbs were deported to Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; International Commission concluded that the Serbian state started in Macedonia wide sociological experiment of "[[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] through [[terror]]."&lt;ref name=ReferenceA/&gt; All Bulgarian books gave way to Serbian. The government Serbianized personal names and surnames for all official uses.

[[File:Map of Serbian colonization in Vardar Macedonia 20 century.jpg|thumb|Serbian colonization in Vardar Macedonia between 1920 and 1930.]]
During the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], the government of the Kingdom pursued a linguistic Serbisation policy towards population of the [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; then called "Southern Serbia" (unofficially) or "Vardar Banovina" (officially). The [[dialect]]s spoken in this region were referred to as dialects of [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=V. |year=1985 |title=The Sociolinguistics of Literary Macedonian |journal=International Journal of the Sociology of Language |volume=52 |issue= |pages=31–57 |doi=10.1515/ijsl.1985.52.31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Either way, those southern dialects were suppressed with regards education, military and other national activities, and their usage was punishable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Kingdom, was also interested to change the ethnic composition of the population in Vardar Macedonia. In 1919 there were announced the orders for preparing for colonization of Southern Serbia. The Serbian colonization was maintained through "agricultural" and "administrative" actions. In the [[Interbellum]], the Kingdom has settled 3,670 families (18,384 persons). The colonists were given properties. Also, in the same time almost all clerks in the area were Serbs. This means that in the period between the two World wars the Kingdom succeeded through the agricultural and the administrative colonizations to create  significant Serbian ethnic minority in Vardar Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;Стојан Киселиновски, Етничките промени во Македонија: 1913-1995, Институт, 2000, {{ISBN|9989624518}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a counteraction the paramilitary [[IMRO]] began sending armed bands into Yugoslav Macedonia to assassinate officials and stir up the spirit of the locals. After 1923 the IMRO had ''de facto'' full control of [[Bulgarian Macedonia]] and acted as a "state within a state". It  used Bulgaria as a base for terrorist attacks against Yugoslavia with the unofficial agreement of the right-wing governments. Because of this, contemporary observers described the Yugoslav-Bulgarian border as the most fortified in Europe. In 1930s a more homogeneous generation was growing up in Vardar Macedonia, which resisted Serbianisation and increasingly identified itself as ''Macedonian'', but which also made it clear that Bulgarian idea was no more the only option for them. 

After WWII [[Marshal Tito]] formed out [[SR Macedonia]] of a part of 1929–1941 [[Vardar Banovina]], and encouraged the development of Macedonian identity and Macedonian as a separate [[South Slavic language]].&lt;ref name=WOW&gt;{{Google books |id=IGeJzd6BLU4C |page=43 |title=War of words: Washington tackles the Yugoslav conflict }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Macedonian national feelings were already ripe, but some researchers argue that even then, it was questionable whether the Macedonian Slavs considered themselves to be a nationality separate from the Bulgarians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmesOn_HhfEC&amp;pg=PA66 ''The Macedonian conflict: ethnic nationalism in a transnational world''], Loring M. Danforth, Princeton University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0-691-04356-6}}, pp. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt; However persons declaring Bulgarian identity were again imprisoned or went into exile, and in this way Vardar Macedonia was finally de-Bulgarised.&lt;ref&gt;Europe Since 1945: An Encyclopedia by Bernard Anthony Cook {{ISBN|0-8153-4058-3}} [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=hafLHZgZtt4C |page=808.}}]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Atentat u Marseju.jpg|thumb|right|King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] assassination in Marseille. The killing was carried out by the Bulgarian  [[VMRO]]-assassin [[Vlado Chernozemski]] in 1934.]]

Today some researchers have described the process of codifying the Macedonian language during 1945 - 1950 as 'Serbianization'.  Within the period of Macedonian language codification two tendencies emerged: one language majority, that was pro-Macedonian, with some pro-Bulgarian biases, and one language minority openly pro-Serbian. The language minority, with the help of the Yugoslav political establishment defeated the language majority.&lt;ref&gt;Stojan Kiselinovski, Historical Roots of the Macedonian Language Codification, Polish Academy of Sciences, 2016, Studia Srodkowoeuropejskie i Bałkanistyczne, pp. 133-146.  DOI: 10.4467/2543733XSSB.16.009.6251 &lt;/ref&gt; The irreversible turning point of Serbianisation of the Macedonian standard took place in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Voss C., The Macedonian Standard Language: Tito—Yugoslav Experiment or Symbol of ‘Great Macedonian’ Ethnic Inclusion? in C. Mar-Molinero, P. Stevenson as ed. Language Ideologies, Policies and Practices: Language and the Future of Europe, Springer, 2016, {{ISBN|0230523889}}, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand during the time of federation in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Socialist Yugoslavia]], Yugoslav citizens learned Serbo-Croatian at school. This [[bilingualism]] was stimulated by the subordinated pro-Serbian elites in Yugoslav Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;Language ideologies, policies and practices by Clare Mar-Molinero, Patrick Stevenson (Editor) - The Macedonian standard language: Tito-Yugoslav experiment or symbol for “Great Macedonian” ethnic inclusion? Christian Voss, {{ISBN|9780230580084}}, Palgrave Macmillan, 2009, pp. 120-122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.bg"&gt;[https://books.google.bg/books?id=vi_VCm51kpkC&amp;pg=PA515&amp;lpg=PA515&amp;dq=macedonian++language+closer+serbian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6SYeoHJjyk&amp;sig=7wi63Og0BVw71VYpe83qPv9esHs&amp;hl=bg#v=snippet&amp;q=macedonian%20%20&amp;f=false The languages and linguistics of Europe: A comprehensive guide, Hans Henrich,  Bernd Kortmann, Johan van der Auwera, Walter de Gruyter, 2011, {{ISBN|3110220261}}, p. 420.]&lt;/ref&gt; In this way the influence of [[Serbo-Croatian]]  arrose so much, that the colloquial speech of the capital [[Skopje]] has been described as a "[[creole language|creolized form]] of Serbian".&lt;ref name="books.google.bg"/&gt;

After Republic of Macedonia gained independence in 1991 this process still continues. In 2015 the former prime minister and leader of the [[VMRO-NP]], [[Ljubco Georgievski]] has claimed in an interview to [[Radio Free Europe]] that then Macedonian authorities have a clear goal, to keep the country closer to Serbia, and at some future stage to join the northern neighbor. According to him a classical pro-Yugoslav policy has being conducted, where confrontation with all the other neighbors was taking place, but the border between Macedonian and Serbian national identity has been erased.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.slobodnaevropa.mk/a/26809481.html Радио Слободна Европа, јануари 23, 2015, Марија Митевска, Србизација на Македонија?]&lt;/ref&gt; "Stop the Serbian assimilation of the Macedonian nation" was the motto of the billboards that were placed then on Skopje streets, through which the Party launched a campaign for preserving the Macedonian national identity.

==De-Serbianisation==

===Croatia===

====In the Military Frontier (1500–1800)====

[[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs]] in the Roman Catholic [[Croatian Military Frontier]] were out of the jurisdiction of the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Peć]] and in 1611, after demands from the community, the Pope establishes the [[Eparchy of Marča]] (''Vratanija'') with seat at the Serbian-built [[Marča Monastery]] and instates a [[Byzantine Rite]] [[vicar]] bishop as sub-ordinate to the Roman Catholic [[bishop of Zagreb]], working to bring Serbian Orthodox Christians into communion with Rome which caused struggle of power between the Catholics and the Serbs over the region. In 1695 Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of ''[[Lika]]-[[Krbava]] and [[Zrinopolje]]'' is established by metropolitan [[Atanasije Ljubojevic]] and certified by Emperor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Josef I]] in 1707. In 1735 the Serbian Orthodox protested in the Marča Monastery and it became a part of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] until 1753 when the Pope restored the Roman Catholic clergy at it. On June 17, 1777 the [[Eparchy of Križevci]] is permanently established by [[Pope Pius VI]] with see at [[Križevci, Croatia|Križevci]], near [[Zagreb]], thus forming the [[Croatian Greek Catholic Church]] which would after the World War I include other people; Rusyns and Ukrainians of [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="ER"&gt;{{Google books |id=ovCVDLYN_JgC |page= |title=Encyclopedia of Rusyn History and Culture }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GEO"&gt;{{Google books |id=0pmkrY29qkIC |page= |title=Geopolitics of European Union Enlargement: The Fortress Empire }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kosovo===
The term ''Arnauti'' or ''Arnautaši'' was coined by Serbian ethnographers for allegedly "''Albanized Serbs''"; [[Serbs]] who were thought to have converted to [[Islam]] and supposedly went through a process of [[Albanisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Dietmar Müller, ''Staatsbürger aus Widerruf: Juden und Muslime als Alteritätspartner im rumänischen und serbischen Nationscode: ethnonationale Staatsbürgerschaftskonzepte 1878–1941'', [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=0UckOb6n71cC |page=183 }} p. 183–208]. {{ISBN|3-447-05248-1}}, {{ISBN|978-3-447-05248-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RK&gt;''Religion and the politics of identity in Kosovo'', [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=aJRYkzl5YC4C |page= |title= }} p. 73]: see footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;

====In Orahovac====
At the end of the 19th century, writer [[Branislav Nušić]] recorded that the [[Serb]] ''poturice'' (converts to Islam) of [[Orahovac]] began speaking in Albanian and marrying Albanian women.&lt;ref name=RK/&gt;

When Dr [[Jovan Hadži Vasiljević]] (l. 1866–1948) visited Orahovac in [[World War I]], he could not distinguish [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] from [[Islamisation|Islamicized]] and Albanized Serbs.&lt;ref name=RK/&gt; They spoke [[Serbian language|Serbian]], wore the same costumes, but claimed [[Serbs|Serbian]], [[Albanians|Albanian]] or [[Turkish people|Turk]] ethnicity.&lt;ref name=RK/&gt; The Albanian ''starosedeoci'' (old urban families) were [[Slavic languages|Slavophone]]; they did not speak Albanian but a Slavic dialect (naš govor, ''Our language'') at home.&lt;ref name=RK/&gt;

In the 1921 census the majority of Muslim Albanians of Orahovac were registered under the category "Serbs and Croats".&lt;ref name=RK/&gt; This is contrary to the belief that Islamisation led to Albanisation. This suggests that claims of Islamisation has led to Albanisation of Serbs are difficult to prove. Also, there has been a continuous and considerable presence of a Slavic Muslim population in Kosovo.

[[Mark Krasniqi]], the Kosovo Albanian [[ethnographer]], recalled in 1957:&lt;ref name=RK/&gt; ''"During my own research, some of them told me that their tongue is similar to [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] rather than Serbian (it is clear that they want to dissociate themselves from everything Serbian&lt;ref name=RK/&gt;). It is likely they are the last remnants of what is now known in Serbian sources as 'Arnautaši', Islamicised and half-way Albanianised Slavs."''&lt;ref name=RK/&gt;

A "'''shotgun house'''" is a narrow rectangular domestic residence, usually no more than about 12&amp;nbsp;feet (3.5&amp;nbsp;m) wide, with rooms arranged one behind the other and doors at each end of the house. It was the most popular style of house in the [[Southern United States]] from the end of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–65) through the 1920s.&lt;!--supported in History--&gt;  Alternate names include "shotgun shack", "shotgun hut", "shotgun cottage", and in the case of a multihome dwelling, "shotgun apartment"; the design is similar to that of [[railroad apartment|railroad apartments]].

A longstanding theory is that the style can be traced from Africa to [[Haiti]]an influences on house design in [[New Orleans]],&lt;ref name="mcalester"/&gt; but the houses can be found as far away as [[Chicago]], [[Key West, Florida]], [[Ybor City, Tampa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gist|first1=Karen Taylor|title=New Orleans has a love affair with shotgun houses|url=http://www.nola.com/homegarden/index.ssf/2010/03/new_orleans_has_a_love_affair.html|accessdate=4 July 2014|publisher=The Times-Picayune|date=March 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Texas]]. Though initially as popular with the middle class as with the poor, the shotgun house became a symbol of poverty in the mid-20th century.  [[Urban renewal]] has led to the destruction of many shotgun houses; however, in areas affected by [[gentrification]], [[historic preservation]] efforts have led to the renovation of such houses.&lt;!-- supported later in article. --&gt;

Several variations of shotgun houses allow for additional features and space, and many have been updated to the needs of later generations of owners. The oldest shotgun houses were built without [[domestic water system|indoor plumbing]], but this was often added later, often on the back of the house (sometimes crudely). "Double-barrel" or "double" shotgun houses consist of two houses sharing a central wall, allowing more houses to be fit into an area. "Camelback" shotgun houses include a second floor at the rear of the house. In some cases the entire [[floor plan]] is changed during remodeling to create hallways.&lt;ref name= "pres"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Shotgun house: urban housing opportunities|publisher= Preservation Alliance of Louisville and Jefferson Co.|year= 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shotgun houses – slight cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Shotgun houses spaced tightly together in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. In cities, shotguns were built close together for a variety of reasons.]]

New Orleans architectural historian Samuel Wilson, Jr. influentially&lt;ref name="Edwards" /&gt; suggested that shotgun-style houses originated in the Creole suburbs (''[[Faubourg#New Orleans|faubourgs]]'') of New Orleans in the early 1800s. He also stated that the term "[[shotgun]]" is a reference to the idea that if all the doors are opened, a shotgun blast fired into the house from the front doorway will fly cleanly to the other end and out at the back.&lt;ref name=Wilson1974&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson, Jr.|first1=Samuel|title=New Orleans Architecture, Volume IV: The Creole Faubourgs|date=1974|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=978-1-56554-130-6|page=71|url=http://www.books.go.ogle.com/books?id=DwYhzS32sfUC&amp;q=projectile#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 July 2014|quote=A projectile discharged from a gun aimed through the front door would presumably travel unimpeded through the house, and emerge from the rear; thus the derivation of the name.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, folklorist and professor John Michael Vlach has suggested that the origin of the building style and the name itself may trace back to [[Haiti]] and [[Africa]] during the 18th century and earlier. Vlach claimed the name may have originated from a [[Dahomey]] [[Fon people|Fon]] area term 'to-gun', which means "place of assembly". The description, probably used in New Orleans by [[Afro-Haitian]] slaves, may have been misunderstood and reinterpreted as "shotgun".&lt;ref name="nh"&gt;Vlach, J: "Shotgun houses", pages 51–57. ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' 86, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Citing Vlach, [[James Deetz]] claimed archaeological support for an African origin in his dig at [[Parting Ways (Plymouth, Massachusetts)|Parting Ways]], a 1790s community of freed black slaves in Plymouth, Massachusetts; his shotgun interpretation of the extremely limited evidence – two rooms that "may or may not have been unified" – has been challenged as "premature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deetz|first1=James|authorlink1=James Deetz|title=In Small Things Forgotten: An Archaeology of Early American Life|year=1996|origyear=1977|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=978-0385483995|pages=222–223|edition=expanded and revised|url=http://www.histarch.illinois.edu/plymouth/parting.html|accessdate=14 November 2014}}.

Vlach's theory behind the earlier African origin is tied to the [[history of New Orleans]]. In 1803 there were 1,355 free blacks in the city. By 1810 blacks outnumbered whites 10,500 to 4,500. This caused a housing boom. As many of both the builders and inhabitants were Africans by way of Haiti, Vlach maintained it was only natural they modeled the new homes after ones they left behind in their homeland. Many surviving Haitian dwellings of the period, including about 15 percent of the housing stock of [[Port-au-Prince]], resemble the single shotgun houses of New Orleans.&lt;ref name="nh" /&gt;

The shotgun house was popularized in New Orleans, and, as Fred Kniffen documented in a statewide survey of Louisiana house types in the 1930s, the greatest number are  found dispersed from there in a manner that supports the diffusion theory.&lt;ref name="Campanella-2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Campanella|first1=Richard|title=Shotgun geography: the history behind the famous New Orleans elongated house|url=http://www.nola.com/homegarden/index.ssf/2014/02/shotgun_geography_new_orleans.html|accessdate=30 April 2016|publisher=The Times-Picayune|date=February 12, 2014|quote=The distribution of shotgun houses throughout Louisiana gives indirect support to the diffusion argument. Kniffen showed in the 1930s that shotguns generally occurred along waterways in areas that tended to be more Francophone in their culture, higher in their proportions of people of African and Creole ancestry, and older in their historical development.  Beyond state boundaries, shotguns occur throughout the lower Mississippi Valley, correlated with antebellum plantation regions and with areas that host large black populations. They also appear in interior Southern cities, most notably Louisville, Ky., which comes a distant second to New Orleans in terms of numbers and stylistic variety.  If in fact the shotgun diffused from Africa to Haiti through New Orleans and up the Mississippi and Ohio valleys, this is the distribution we would expect to see.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kniffen-1936"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kniffen, Fred B.|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=26|issue=4|pages=179–193|title=Louisiana House Types|doi=10.2307/2569532|year=1936|publisher=Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Vol. 26, No. 4|jstor=2569532}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style was definitely built there by 1832, though there is evidence that houses sold in the 1830s were built 15 to 20 years earlier.&lt;ref name="nh" /&gt;

A simpler theory is that they are the typical one-room-deep floor plan popular in the rural south, rotated to accommodate narrow city lots.&lt;ref name="mcalester"&gt;{{cite book|last=McAlester|first=Virginia &amp; Lee|title=A Field Guide to American Houses|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|year=1997|page=90|isbn=0-394-73969-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such houses were built throughout hot [[urban area]]s in the [[Southern United States|South]], since the style's length allowed for excellent airflow, while its narrow frontage increased the number of lots that could be fitted along a street. It was used so frequently that some southern cities estimate that, even today, 10% or more of their housing stock is composed of shotgun houses.&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;Burns, Richard Allen. ''The Shotgun Houses of Trumann, Arkansas'', Arkansas Review, (April 2002), Vol. 33, Issue 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known use of "shotgun house" as a name for these dwellings is in a classified advertisement in the ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', August 30, 1903: "Two 3-room houses near the railroad yards at Simpson st. crossing, rent $12 a month to good tenants who pay in advance; price $1,200 on terms or $100 cash, balance $15 a month; a combination of investment and savings bank: these are not shacks, but good shot-gun houses in good repair." While this advertisement seems to present shotgun houses as a desirable [[Working class|working-class]] housing alternative, by 1929 a Tennessee court noted that shotgun houses could not be rented to any other than a very poor class of tenants.&lt;ref&gt;''Moore v. Minnis'', 11 Tenn.App. 88 (Tenn. App. 1929).&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[Great Depression]] few shotgun houses were built, and existing ones went into decline. By the late 20th century shotgun houses in some areas were being restored as housing and for other uses.&lt;ref name="pres" /&gt;

Shotgun houses were often initially built as rental properties, located near manufacturing centers or railroad hubs, to provide housing for workers. Owners of factories frequently built the houses to rent specifically to employees, usually for a few dollars a month.&lt;ref name="pres" /&gt; However, by the late 20th century shotguns were often owner-occupied. For example, 85% of the houses (many of them shotgun) in New Orleans' [[Lower Ninth Ward]] were owner-occupied.&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;Starr, S. Frederick. [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/22/garden/22shotgun.html ''The New Orleans Shotgun: Down but Not Out'']. [[The New York Times|New York Times]]. September 22, 2005. pg. F.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shotgun houses were most popular before widespread ownership of the automobile allowed people to live farther from businesses and other destinations. Building lots were small, 30&amp;nbsp;feet (9&amp;nbsp;m) wide at most. An influx of people to cities, both from rural areas in America and from foreign countries, all looking to fill emerging manufacturing jobs, created the high demand for housing in cities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Shotgun houses were built to fulfill the same need as [[rowhouse]]s in [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] cities. Several were often built at a time by a single builder, contributing to their similar appearance.&lt;ref name="pres" /&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:Shotgun house plan.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Floor plan of a typical single shotgun with bathroom]]
The rooms of a shotgun house are lined up one behind the other, typically a living room is first, then one or two bedrooms, and finally a kitchen in back. Early shotgun houses were not built with bathrooms, but in later years a bathroom with a small hall was built before the last room of the house, or a side addition was built off the kitchen.&lt;ref name="pres" /&gt; Some shotguns have only two rooms.&lt;ref name="Marling-Gr-archive"&gt;{{cite book

Chimneys tended to be built in the interior, allowing the front and middle rooms to share a chimney with a fireplace opening in each room. The kitchen usually has its own chimney.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Other than the basic floor layout, shotgun houses have many standard features in common. The house is almost always close to the street, sometimes with a very short front yard. In some cases, the house has no [[Setback (land use)|setback]] and is actually flush with the [[sidewalk]]. The original steps were wood, but were often replaced with permanent concrete steps.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

[[File:Sketch of shotgun house, Louisville Kentucky.gif|left|thumb|Sketch of a typical camelback, or 1½-story, shotgun house, with a detailed sketch of a typical decorative wooden door bracket]]

A sign of its New Orleans heritage, the house is usually raised two to three feet off the ground. There is a single door and window in the front of the house, and often a side door leading into the back room, which is slightly wider than the rest of the house. The front door and window often were originally covered by decorative shutters. Side walls may or may not have windows; rooms not adjoining the front nor back door will generally have at least one window even when the houses are built very close together.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Typically, shotgun houses have a wood-frame structure and wood siding, although some examples exist in brick and even stone. Many shotguns, especially older or less expensive ones, have flat roofs that end at the front wall of the house. In houses built after 1880, the roof usually overhangs the front wall, and there is usually a [[gable]] above the overhang. The overhang is usually supported by decorative wooden brackets, and sometimes contains [[cast iron]] ventilators.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The rooms are well-sized, and have relatively high ceilings for cooling purposes, as when warm air can rise higher, the lower part of a room tends to be cooler. The lack of hallways allows for efficient cross-ventilation in every room. 
Rooms usually have some decoration such as [[molding (decorative)|moldings]], ceiling medallions, and elaborate woodwork. In cities like New Orleans, local industries supplied elaborate but mass-produced brackets and other ornaments for shotgun houses that were accessible even to homeowners of modest means.&lt;ref name="Starr" /&gt;

==Variations==
[[File:Project Row house studios.JPG|thumb|Project Row Houses in Third Ward Houston, Texas]]
[[File:UptownCornerDoubleHouse.jpg|thumb|A double shotgun structure in the [[Uptown New Orleans|Uptown]] section of New Orleans. Double shotgun houses were a form of multiple-family housing, where essentially two conventional shotgun houses shared a central wall.]]
[[File:UptownShotgunCamelbackGarage.jpg|thumb|A classic camelback shotgun house in [[Uptown New Orleans]]]]
A conventional one-story freestanding shotgun house is often called a single shotgun. Many common variations exist in high quantity, and are often actually more common than the single shotgun in cities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

A double shotgun, also called double-barrel shotgun, is essentially two shotgun houses connected to each other and sharing a central wall. They are a form of [[semi-detached]] housing.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The double shotgun requires less land per household than the traditional shotgun and was used extensively in poorer areas because it could be built with fewer materials and use less land per occupant. It was first seen in New Orleans in 1854.&lt;ref name="nh" /&gt;

A camelback house, also called humpback, is a variation of the shotgun that has a partial second floor over the rear of the house. Camelback houses were built in the later period of shotgun houses. The floor plan and construction is very similar to the traditional shotgun house, except there are stairs in the back room leading up to the second floor. The second floor, or "hump", contains one to four rooms. Because it was only a partial second story, most cities only taxed it as a single-story house – this was a key reason for their construction.&lt;ref name="holl"&gt;{{cite book |author=Holl, Steven |title=Pamphlet Architecture 9: Rural and Urban House Types |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |date=November 1, 1995 |pages=34–39 |accessdate=2010-07-01 |isbn=978-0-910413-15-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=oAWkvAW4p_cC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Rural%20and%20Urban%20House%20Types%20in%20North%20America&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The double-width shotgun is an extra-large and -wide shotgun house, built on two lots instead of one. These were typically built one-to-a-block in locations where a single person would first buy the entire [[city block]] during development, then build themselves a double-sized home and subdivide the rest of the block with single-lot homes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

A combination, the Double Camelback shotgun, also exists. A minor variation is a side door allowing access to the kitchen, or a porch along the side extending almost the length of the house.&lt;ref name="pres" /&gt;

"North shore" houses are shotgun houses with wide [[veranda]]s on three sides. They were so named because most were built on the north shore of New Orleans' [[Lake Pontchartrain]] as summer homes for wealthy whites.&lt;ref name="nh" /&gt;

The term may also refer to a different structure, common in [[rural]] areas and small towns, which takes the form of a small, long, free-standing house, generally made of wood, with no [[hallway]]s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Unlike the larger terraced version, this is generally a single-storied dwelling, but it was still associated with [[poverty]] and popular partially because of its ability to make hot weather more comfortable.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} This building style can also be seen in a double shotgun style, made for use by one or two households. Both styles were commonly used in sawmill towns where examples still exist.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Decline and legacy==
The construction of shotgun houses slowed and eventually stopped during the early 20th century. The increased affordability of two technological innovations, the car and consumer [[air conditioning]] units, made the key advantages of the shotgun house obsolete to home buyers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} After World War II, shotgun houses had very little appeal to those building or buying new houses, as car-oriented modern suburbs were built ''en masse''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Few shotgun houses have been built in America since the war, although the concept of a simple, single-level floor plan lived on in [[ranch-style house]]s.&lt;ref name="pres" /&gt;

The surviving urban shotgun houses suffered problems related to those typically facing the [[inner city]] neighborhoods in which they were located. The [[white flight|flight]] of affluent residents to the suburbs, absentee owners, and a shortage of mortgage lenders for inner-city residents led to the deterioration of shotgun houses in the mid- and late 20th century. Confusing ownership, passed down within a family over several generations, also contributed to many houses sitting vacant for years.&lt;ref name="pres" /&gt;

Though shotguns are sometimes perceived as being prevalent in poor [[African American]] neighborhoods, many originally constituted much of the housing stock of segregated white neighborhoods.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Many of these neighborhoods became predominantly black during the 1950s and 1960s, but many others did not and remain predominantly white.&lt;ref name="Starr" /&gt;

[[File:Seventh Street West 904, Bloomington West Side HD.jpg|thumb|A single shotgun house in [[Bloomington, Indiana]]]]
Regardless of who was living in them, from World War II until the 1980s shotguns came to be widely viewed as substandard housing and a symbol of poverty, and they were demolished by many [[urban renewal]] projects. This thinking is no longer so prevalent, with cities such as [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] establishing "Shotgun Historic Districts". Shotgun houses have even been praised as quality and cost-effective cultural assets that promote a distinctive urban life.&lt;ref name="Starr" /&gt; Other cities such as [[Macon, Georgia]] experimented with renovating shotgun houses for low-income residents and, though there was indecision on whether it would be cheaper to tear them down and build new housing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Duncan, S. Heather |title=Shotgun houses, rehabilitate or replace? |publisher=[[The Telegraph (Macon)|The Macon Telegraph]]| date=6 March 2006 |page=8 |quote= Some city planners and even residents themselves debate the value of preserving shotgun houses.

There are many large neighborhoods in older American cities of the south which still contain a high concentration of shotgun houses today. Examples include [[Third Ward, Houston|Third Ward]] in [[Houston]]; [[Bywater, New Orleans|Bywater]] in [[New Orleans]]; [[The Hill, St. Louis|The Hill]] in [[St. Louis]]; [[Portland, Louisville|Portland]], [[Butchertown, Louisville|Butchertown]] and [[Germantown, Louisville|Germantown]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]];&lt;ref name=Elson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2011306210033 |title=Louisville's endangered shotgun houses targeted for preservation |first=Martha |last=Elson |work=[[The Courier-Journal]] |date=June 20, 2011 |accessdate=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cabbagetown (Atlanta)|Cabbagetown]] in Atlanta.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Their role in the history of the south has become recognized; for example, in October 2001 [[Rice University]] sponsored an exhibition called "Shotguns 2001".{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} This three-day event featured lectures on and artistic paintings of the houses, as well as presentations and panel discussions in a neighborhood of restored shotguns.

In some shotgun-dominated neighborhoods, property value has become quite high, leading to [[gentrification]]. Sometimes, a new owner will buy both homes of a double-barreled shotgun structure and combine them, to form a relatively large single house. Shotguns are also often combined to renovate them into office or storage space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Marty|last=Roney|publisher=Montgomery Advertiser|title=Old shotgun homes given new purpose|date=July 2, 2005|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A limited revival==
Elements of the shotgun style have recently been seen in a number of the compact, low-occupancy structures employed in the [[Solar Decathlon]] contests held periodically in Washington, DC. While some are erected from panels brought to the site, many such structures consist of enclosed single or multiple units designed specifically for road transports, with multiple modules connected on site, and compact linear structures often employ multiple-use "zones" rather than specifically private areas, while retaining a linear progression of spaces.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In 2011 Louisville's daily newspaper, ''[[The Courier-Journal]]'', reported that a local nonprofit agency devoted to building and renovating affordable housing was building new shotgun houses in a development in southwest Louisville.&lt;ref name=Elson/&gt;

The shotgun house plays a large role in the folklore and culture of the south. Superstition holds that [[ghost]]s and [[spirit]]s are attracted to shotgun houses because they may pass straight through them, and that some houses were built with doors intentionally misaligned to deter these spirits.&lt;ref name="holl" /&gt; They also often serve as a convenient symbol of life in the south.

One of the more widely known references to a shotgun house is in the 1980 [[Talking Heads]] song "[[Once in a Lifetime (Talking Heads song)|Once In A Lifetime]]". The first line of the song is "And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Talking Heads: once in a lifetime : the stories behind every song |first= Ian |last=Gittins |pages=68–69 |publisher=Hal Leonard |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-634-08033-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZvhoZyTzspYC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[John Mellencamp]] song "[[Pink Houses]]" was inspired when he was driving along an overpass on the way home to [[Bloomington, Indiana]] from the [[Indianapolis International Airport|Indianapolis airport]]. There was an old black man sitting outside his little pink shotgun house with his cat in his arms, completely unperturbed by the traffic speeding along the highway in his front yard. “He waved, and I waved back,” Mellencamp said in an interview with Rolling Stone. “That's how 'Pink Houses' started.”.&lt;ref name="rollingstone.com"&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/johnmellencamp/articles/story/6596284/pink_houses Pink Houses: John Mellencamp : Rolling Stone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mixonline.com/recording/interviews/audio_john_cougar_mellencamps/ Classic Tracks: John Cougar Mellencamp's “Pink Houses”&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719235839/http://mixonline.com/recording/interviews/audio_john_cougar_mellencamps/ |date=2008-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bruce Springsteen's song "[[We Take Care of Our Own]]", from the album ''[[Wrecking Ball (Bruce Springsteen album)|Wrecking Ball]]'', he refers to shotgun houses, singing "We take care of our own, from the shotgun shack to the Super Dome".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1866">'''"Song of the Falklands"''' is the unofficial anthem of the [[Falkland Islands]] ("[[God Save the Queen]]" being official). It was written in the 1930s by Christopher Lanham, a [[Hampshire]] schoolteacher, while working on [[West Falkland]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalanthems.info/fk.htm |title="Song of the Falklands" |author= nationalanthems.info|date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lyrics ==
First Verse

In my heart there’s a call for [[Falkland Islands#Geography and ecology|the isles]] far away&lt;br&gt;
Where the wind from [[Cape Horn|the Horn]] often wanders at play.&lt;br&gt;
Where the [[kelp]] moves and swells to the wind and the tide&lt;br&gt;
And [[penguin]]s troop down from the lonely hillside.&lt;br&gt;

CHORUS:&lt;br&gt;
:Those isles of the sea are calling to me&lt;br&gt;
:The smell of the camp fire a dear memory.&lt;br&gt;
:Though far I may roam, some day I’ll come home&lt;br&gt;
:To the islands, the [[Falklands]], the isles of the sea.&lt;br&gt;

Second Verse

There’s a camp house down yonder I’m longing to see,&lt;br&gt;
Though it’s no gilded palace it’s there I would be.&lt;br&gt;
Just to be there again I would race o’er the foam,&lt;br&gt;
For that lone house so far is my own home sweet home.&lt;br&gt;

Chorus&lt;br&gt;

Third Verse

Now we’re off to the Falklands, so wild and so free,&lt;br&gt;
Where there’s [[tussock (grass)|tussock]] and [[kelp]] and the red [[diddle-dee]],&lt;br&gt;
And the wild rugged beauty that thrills more than me&lt;br&gt;
Is bred in the bones on the isles of the sea.&lt;br&gt;

Chorus

The '''Teaching and Learning Research Programme (TLRP)''' was the [[United Kingdom]]'s largest investment in education research. It was initiated in 2000, ended in 2011 and was managed on behalf of the Higher Education Funding Councils by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] .  The programme engaged 700 researchers in some 70 major projects.  These covered all education sectors - from Early Years to Higher Education and Workplace Learning. The TLRP researchers work closely in partnership with practitioners to ensure the relevance and application of findings to policy and practice. Thematic work across the diverse range of projects enabled analysis of themes and the identification of 'ten principles for effective teaching and learning'.

During the project an interest emerged in [[Technology-Enhanced Learning]] (TEL). It began with a call for proposals in 2006, additional funding having been made available by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. 

From 1995 to 2011, the Teaching and Learning Research programme was based at the [[Institute of Education]], [[University of London]].  Prior to this, it was managed from the University of Exeter and University of Cambridge.

==Teaching and Learning Research Programme generic phase: 2000 - 2009==

===Objectives===

The programme acknowledges the important contributions provided by research on teaching and learning. [https://web.archive.org/web/20021014023934/http://www.tlrp.org/aims/index.html The TLRP's aims, according to its website] include :

* Learning - The TLRP conducts research with the potential to improve outcomes for learners in a very wide range of UK contexts across the lifecourse. The Programme explores synergies between different research approaches and aims to build UK capacity in conducting high quality educational research.
* Outcomes - TLRP studies a broad range of learning outcomes. These include both the acquisition of skill, understanding, knowledge and qualifications and the development of attitudes, values and identities relevant to a learning society.
* Lifecourse - TLRP supports research projects on many ages and stages in education, training and lifelong learning. The Programme is concerned with patterns of success and difference, inclusion and exclusion through the lifecourse.
* Enrichment - The TLRP is committed to engaging users in its work. It works in all disciplines and sectors of education and uses a wide range of appropriate methodology. We cooperate with other researchers within and beyond the UK whenever it is appropriate.
* Expertise - TLRP works to enhance capacity for all forms of research on teaching and learning, and for research-informed policy and practice.
* Improvement - The TLRP works to develop the UK knowledge base on teaching and learning and to make sure that the knowledge it develops is applied in practice and policy.

====Strategy====
There were six strategic commitments underpinning the programme's overall development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Case study of TLRP|publisher=Teaching &amp; Learning Research Programme |year=2005 |url=http://www.tlrp-archive.org/tlrp/upload/assets/1176821531_OECD_EbPR_case_study_of_TLRP.pdf |accessdate = 2007-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* User engagement for relevance and quality
* Knowledge generation by project teams
* Knowledge synthesis through thematic activities
* Knowledge transformation for impact
* Capacity building for professional development
* Partnerships for sustainability

===Projects===
TLRP's projects covered a broad range of topics within the following areas of the lifecourse:

* Early Years
* Primary Education
* Secondary Education
* Across School Phases
* Further and Post-16 Education
* Higher Education
* Workplace Learning
* Professional Learning
* Lifelong Learning
* Technology Enhanced Learning

===Management===

Strategic management of the programme was conducted via a steering committee. This comprised academics, practitioners and other users and was chaired by Professor [[Robert Burgess (professor)|Robert Burgess]], Vice-Chancellor of the [[University of Leicester]].  The steering committee was accountable to the [[ESRC]] Council.

====Director's Team====

The Directors’ Team possessed expert knowledge of all the key sectors in which research is currently being conducted.  The final team was:

*Professor [[Andrew Pollard]], Programme Director
*Professor [[Mary James (educator)]], Deputy Director
*Professor [[Miriam David]], Associate Director
*Professor Alan Brown, Associate Director

==TLRP Technology Enhanced Learning phase: 2006 - 2011==

===Objectives===

[https://web.archive.org/web/20111020022152/http://www.tel.ac.uk/ According to its website], the Technology Enhanced Learning research has specific concern with:

* Productivity – Achieving higher quality and more effective learning in affordable and acceptable ways
* Personalisation – Transforming the quality of learning, by matching technology with learners' needs
* Inclusion – Improving the reach of education and lifelong learning to groups and individuals
* Flexibility – Enabling more open, variable, and accessible learning

===Projects===

Under the first phase of the TLRP-TEL programme, seven development projects were funded during 2006-2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TLRP-TEL Development Projects|publisher=Teaching &amp; Learning Research Programme |year=2009 |url=http://www.tlrp.org/proj/teldev.html |accessdate = 2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme funded eight large, interdisciplinary projects under its second phase:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6276">'''Bhutanese textiles''' represent a rich and complex repository of a unique art form. They are recognised for their abundance of colour, sophistication and variation of patterns, and the intricate dyeing and weaving techniques. The weavers, who are mostly women, must not be seen merely as creator of wealth but also as the innovators and owners of artistic skills developed and nurtured over centuries of time.

==History==
[[File:Kushuthara.jpg|thumb|Kushuthara]]
The history of [[Bhutan]]ese textiles becomes more evident in the last century. As textile production moved beyond the confines of clothing to artistic expression of individuals and communities, patronage from the royal household was vital.
Although the founders of the [[House of Wangchuck|Wangchuck dynasty]] are from [[Bumthang District|Bumthang]], their ancestral home is in [[Lhuntse District]], which was historically recognised as the home of the most celebrated weavers in the country.
The role and influence of royal women in sustaining and furthering the weaving tradition must be acknowledged. The 10th [[Penlop of Trongsa|Trongsa Penlop]] [[Jigme Namgyal (Bhutan)|Jigme Namgyal]] built the [[Wangducholing Palace]] in 1857 the [[loom]] houses (thagchem) accommodating 30 to 40 weavers, were built around the same time near the palace and existed until the mid 1900s.
[[File:Various Bhutanese Textiles.jpg|thumb|An assortment of textiles from Bhutan]]
The youngest sister of the second king, Princess ''Ashi'' Kunchog Wangmo Wangchuck (later a nun), is credited to have introduced the horizontal loom from [[Tibet]] in the 1930s.
Her Majesty the Queen Mother ''Ashi'' [[Sangay Choden|Sangay Choden Wangchuck]] continuous to extend royal patronage to the textile industry. Her Majesty's interest and intervention have revitalised Bhutanese textiles, given the industry and impetus within the country and brought world attention to Bhutanese textiles. She is the Royal Patron of the [[Bhutan Textile Museum]] and the Chairman of the [[Royal Textile Academy of Bhutan]] (RTAB).
[[File:Bhutanese Textile.jpg|thumb|A Bhutanese textile]]
Today Bhutanese textiles have reached new heights of dynamism and respect; they are valued not only for their economic viability, but also as a symbol of Bhutan's artistic heritage that commands world attention and appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Choeden|first=Kunzang|title=BHUTAN, A constitution to Strengthen the Nation Kingship and Wisdom-engineering.|year=2008|publisher=Tourism Council of Bhutan.|location=Thimphu, Bhutan|isbn=99936-624-6-1|pages=69–73|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/bhutan-a-constitution-to-strengthen-the-nation-kingship-and-wisdom-engineering-centenary-issue/oclc/319155361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women weavers==

Ordinary weavers produced fabrics for general use that were of standard quality. The farmers wove only when they were free from agricultural work.It was the royal weavers, ''thama'', in the royal loom houses who were the professionals. Some of the aristocratic and landed households also professional weavers.
The all-encompassing use of textiles took it beyond the realm of clothing to the realms of rituals and symbolism, as a form of wealth and commodities for trade and taxation.  A well-established system of production, use and exchange linked the communities, extended the threads of interdependence, and wove the very fabric of Bhutanese society.

==Types of Patterns==

===Plain weaves===
Plain weave textiles are usually woven in patterns with stripes and plaids.
*'''Martha''': Plaid weave usually with red or maroon as the dominant color.
*'''Sertha''': Plaid weave usually with yellow or orange as the dominate color.
*'''Thara''': Woven only for production of horizontal striped Kira with white as the dominate color.
*'''Kamtham Jardrima''': Striped weave incorporating the colors of the rainbow.

===Warp Pattern Weaves===
Warp is the yarn that runs lengthwise on the loom. The warp pattern designs are characterized by their supplementary warp floating technique that forms bands of repeated [[Motif (textile arts)|motifs]] on ground. The different warp pattern designs are differentiated with their color schemes.  The number of legs or cross hatches in each supplementary warp pattern band is one indicator of the superiority of the textile. The textile is even more priced when the weaver includes weft pattern designs.
*'''Mentsi Martha''': Alternate yellow warp bands with plain weave red ground. [[File:Mensti Martha.jpg|thumb|Mentsi Martha]][[File:Sertha (top) Martha (bottom).jpg|thumb|Sertha (top) Martha (bottom)]]
*'''Lungserma''': Alternate green red on yellow ground.
*'''Dromchuchem''': Literally means 'with little boxes' pattern bands are woven in threes.
*'''Mentha''': Narrow white warp bands on black ground. It is the one pattern which is worn solely by women.
*'''Weft''': Yarn that is passed back and forth through each shed across the loom and is interwoven with the wrap.

===Weft Pattern Weaves===
Weft patterns are popularly referred to as '''Sapma''' continuous weft patterns and '''Tigma''' discontinuous weft patterns in Bhutan.
The continuous weft patterns are very similar to those featured in other textile throughout South and [[Southeast Asia]]. The weft yarn is inserted between intervals of the warp yarn to create continuous weft patterns.
The discontinuous weft patterns motifs resemble embroidery are indigenous to Bhutan. Colored pattern yarns are knotted individually to the weft yarns to create geometric motifs which are usually combination of multiple pattern motifs.
*'''Sapma''': Continuous weft pattern designs.
*'''Tingma''': Discontinuous weft pattern designs. Textile experts often mistake the supplementary weft pattern designs for [[embroidery]] as they say it is impossible to weave the brocade patterning on a common back-strap loom.
The ''sapma'' and ''Tingma'' weft pattern designs are usually used as pattern designs for :
*'''Ngoshom''': [[Kira (Bhutan)|Kira]] with the dark ground usually blue or black.
*'''Kushuthara''':  Kira with a white ground.
*'''Shilochem''': Woven both for [[Gho]] and Kira, usually woven with alternate rows of wrap pattern bands.

The '''ticking time bomb scenario''' is a [[thought experiment]] that has been used in the [[ethics]] debate over whether [[torture]] can ever be justified. As a thought experiment, there is no need that the scenario be plausible; it need only serve to highlight ethical considerations. The scenario can be formulated as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose that a person with knowledge of an imminent [[terrorism|terrorist attack]], that will kill many people, is in the hands of the authorities and that he will disclose the information needed to prevent the attack only if he is tortured. Should he be tortured?&lt;ref name="APT"&gt;[http://www.apt.ch/content/files_res/tickingbombscenario.pdf Defusing the Ticking Bomb Scenario: Why we must say No to torture, Always], [[Association for the Prevention of Torture]], September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The scenario can be better understood through the arguments of those who respond to it; the [[consequentialist]] argument is that nations, even those that legally disallow torture, can justify its use if they have a terrorist in custody who possesses critical knowledge, such as the location of a [[time bomb]] or a [[weapon of mass destruction]] that will soon explode and cause great loss of life. Opponents to the argument usually begin by exposing certain assumptions that tend to be hidden by initial presentations of the scenario and tend to obscure the true costs of permitting torture in "real-life" scenarios—e.g., the assumption that the person is in fact a terrorist, whereas in real life there usually remains uncertainty about whether the person is in fact a terrorist and that he has useful information&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spino|first1=	Joseph|last2=Dellarosa Cummins|first2=Denise|title=The Ticking Time Bomb: When the Use of Torture Is and Is Not Endorsed|journal=Review of Philosophy and Psychology|date=August 2014|volume=5|pages=543–563|doi=10.1007/s13164-014-0199-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and rely on legal, philosophical/moral, and empirical grounds to reaffirm the need for the absolute prohibition of torture.  There is also uncertainty about the [[effectiveness of torture]], and much opposition to torture is based on the fact it is not effective rather than any moral issue.

==Background==

Philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] has been regarded as the "father" of the ticking time bomb argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.19.bbk.ac.uk/articles/10.16995/ntn.643/|title=The Fire-Raisers: Bentham and Torture|first=Jeremy|last=Davies|date=1 December 2012|publisher=|doi=10.16995/ntn.643}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in his 1804 essay ''Means of extraction for extraordinary occasions'':

{{quote|Suppose an occasion to arise, in which a suspicion is entertained, as strong as that which would be received as a sufficient ground for arrest and commitment as for felony — a suspicion that at this very time a considerable number of individuals are actually suffering, by illegal violence inflictions equal in intensity to those which if inflicted by the hand of justice, would universally be spoken of under the name of torture. For the purpose of rescuing from torture these hundred innocents, should any scruple be made of applying equal or superior torture, to extract the requisite information from the mouth of one criminal, who having it in his power to make known the place where at this time the enormity was practicing or about to be practiced, should refuse to do so?}}

The concept was popularized in the 1960s in the novel ''[[Les Centurions]]'' by [[Jean Lartéguy]] which is set during the [[Algerian war]]. The version in the novel has the following conditions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Twining|first1=WL|last2=Twining|first2=PE|title=Bentham on torture|journal=N. Ir. LQ|date=1973|volume=24|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The evidence in support of the contention that he has the relevant information would satisfy the requirements of evidence for convicting him of an offence.
# There are reasonable grounds for believing that he is likely to tell the truth if severe torture is threatened, and, if necessary, applied to him.
# There are reasonable grounds for believing that no other means would have the effect of compelling him to tell the truth.
# There are grounds for believing that if the information is obtained quickly, there is a good chance of defusing the bomb before it goes off.
# There are reasonable grounds for believing that the likely damage to be caused by the bomb will include death of many citizens, the maiming of others, including the infliction of much more severe pain on others with much more lasting effect than will be the effect of the infliction of torture on the person who has been captured;
# There are reasonable grounds for believing that the torturing will not have consequences which would be worse than the damage likely to result from the bomb going off.
According to [[Darius Rejali]], a professor of political science at [[Reed College]], the possibility of sudden, massive destruction of innocent life provided French liberals with a more acceptable justification for committing torture.&lt;ref name="Mayer"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/070219fa_fact_mayer | title=Whatever it takes.

==Views in favor of accepting torture in emergencies==
[[Alan Dershowitz]], a prominent American defense attorney, surprised some observers by giving limited support to the idea that torture could be justified. He argued that human nature can lead to unregulated abuse "off the books". Therefore, it would be better if there were a regulated procedure through which an interrogator could request a "torture warrant" and that requiring a warrant would establish a paper trail of accountability. Torturers, and those who authorize torture, could be held to account for excesses. Dershowitz's suggested torture warrants, similar to search warrants, arrest warrants and phone tap warrants, would spell out the limits on the techniques that interrogators may use, and the extent to which they may abridge a suspect's rights.

In September 2002, when reviewing Alan Dershowitz's book, ''Why Terrorism Works: Understanding the Threat, Responding to the Challenge'', [[Richard Posner]], legal scholar and judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, wrote in ''[[The New Republic]]'', "If torture is the only means of obtaining the information necessary to prevent the detonation of a [[nuclear bomb]] in [[Times Square]], torture should be used--and will be used--to obtain the information.... No one who doubts that this is the case should be in a position of responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/review/2002_09_05.html|title=Review-a-Day - Why Terrorism Works Understanding The by  Alan M Dershowitz, reviewed by The New Republic Online - Powell's Books|work=powells.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023012718/http://www.powells.com/review/2002_09_05.html|archivedate=2012-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views in favor of torturing the relatives of suspects===
In February 2010 [[Bruce Anderson (columnist)|Bruce Anderson]] wrote a column for ''[[The Independent]]'', arguing that the British government would have not just the right, but the duty, to torture if there was a ticking bomb, and that they should torture the relatives of suspects if they believed that doing so would yield information that would avert a terrorist attack: "It came, in the form of a devilish intellectual challenge. 'Let's take your hypothesis a bit further. We have captured a terrorist, but he is a hardened character. We cannot be certain that he will crack in time. We have also captured his wife and children'. After much agonising, I have come to the conclusion that there is only one answer to [[Sydney Kentridge]]'s question. [[collective punishment|Torture the wife and children]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/bruce-anderson/bruce-anderson-we-not-only-have-a-right-to-use-torture-we-have-a-duty-1899555.html We not only have a right to use torture. We have a duty], Bruce Anderson, ''[[The Independent]]'', 16 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views rejecting torture under all circumstances==
Some human rights organizations, professional and academic experts, and military and intelligence leaders have absolutely rejected the idea that torture is ever legal or acceptable, even in a so-called ticking bomb situation.&lt;ref name="APT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt; They have expressed grave concern about the way the dramatic force and artificially simple moral answers the ticking bomb thought-experiment seems to offer, have manipulated and distorted the legal and moral perceptions, reasoning and judgment of both the general population and military and law enforcement officials. They reject the proposition, implicit or explicit, that certain acts of torture are justifiable, even desirable. They believe that simplistic responses to the scenario may lead well-intentioned societies down a slippery slope to legalized and systematic torture. They point out that no evidence of any real-life situation meeting all the criteria to constitute a pure ticking bomb scenario has ever been presented to the public, and that such a situation is highly unlikely.{{efn|Interviewed on ''Face the Nation'' in May 2009, former [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] cited [[CIA]] memos that gave two examples supporting the use of [[enhanced interrogation techniques]] in a ticking bomb scenario, claiming that the interrogation of [[Abu Zubaydah]] prevented a plot to detonate a ''[[dirty bomb]]'' in [[Washington DC]] and similarly that information forced from [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] prevented an attack on [[Los Angeles]]. These claims were later repeated in August 2009 during a FOX news interview and are still cited as valid examples. However, in 2008, the claims made in the 2007 CIA memos were investigated by the [[U.S. Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]'s Office of Professional Responsibility and heavily criticized. The Department of Justice report, released in February 2009, stated that Zubaydah had supplied the information before he was tortured and that no further credible information had been obtained from the torture itself. In the case of Mohammed, the attack on Los Angeles had already been exposed before his capture and his admissions under torture were little more than white noise given to end it.}}

As well, torture can be criticized as a poor vehicle for discovering truth, as people experiencing torture, once broken, are liable to make anything up in order to stop the pain and can become unable to tell the difference between fact and fiction under intense psychological pressure. Additionally, since the terrorist presumably knows that the timer is ticking, he has an excellent reason to lie and give false information under torture in order to misdirect his interrogators; merely giving a convincing answer which the investigators will waste time checking out makes it more likely that the bomb will go off, and of course once the bomb has gone off, not only has the terrorist won, but there is also no further point in torturing him, except perhaps as revenge.

Others point out that the ticking-bomb torture proponents adopt an extremely short-term view, which impoverishes their [[consequentialism]]. Using torture—or even declaring that one is prepared to accept its use—makes other groups of people much more likely to use torture themselves in the long run. The consequence is likely to be a long-term increase in violence. This long-term effect is so serious that the person making the torture decision cannot possibly (according to this argument) make a reasonable estimate of its results. Thus the decision-maker has no grounds for certainty that the value of the lives saved from the ticking bomb will outweigh the value of the lives lost because of the subsequent disorder. He or she cannot arrive at a successful accounting of consequences.

This anti-torture argument, in fact, works by positing that human knowledge has intrinsic limits. An analogous argument holds that human decision-makers are fundamentally prone in certain situations to believe that their judgment is better than it is, and that, to be ethical, they must pre-commit themselves to a particular course of action in those situations. Knowing that, under stress, they will never be able to accurately assess the likely success of torture in obtaining information needed to prevent an attack, humans thus pre-commit to not torture. In general, this family of arguments faults the "ticking-bomb" scenario for implicitly including an incorrect presumption that the decision-maker can know in advance the outcome of torture, either in the short run (likelihood that it will prevent an attack) or the long run (likelihood that it will not set off a general increase in human violence).

[[Joe Navarro]], one of the [[FBI]]’s top experts in questioning techniques, told [[The New Yorker]]:

{{quote|Only a [[psychopath]] can torture and be unaffected. You don’t want people like that in your organization. They are untrustworthy, and tend to have grotesque other problems.&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/the-politics-of-torture-scenes-on-24-shame-on-you-for-your-lies-joel-surnow "The Politics Of TV Torture Shown On '24' - Shame On You For Your Lies, Joel Surnow"] by Nikki Finke, ''[[LA Weekly]]'', February 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-military-tells-jack-bauer-cut-out-the-torture-scenes--or-else-436143.html "US Military Tells Jack Bauer: Cut Out the Torture Scenes ... or Else!"] by Andrew Buncombe, ''[[The Independent]]'', February 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]], which was adopted on December 10, 1984, and entered into force on June 26, 1987, explicitly states in Article 2.2 that:

{{quote|No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of [[war]] or a threat of war, internal [[failed state|political instability]] or any other [[state of emergency|public emergency]], may be invoked as a justification of torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/39/a39r046.htm|title=A/RES/39/46.  Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|work=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Implausibility===
Critics of the thought experiment scenario maintain that it is essentially implausible, based on simultaneous presence of numerous unlikely factors. This is particularly acute in fictional exploration of the scenario.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

For example, in perhaps the most common variants on the scenario, one must assume that torturers know, with a reasonable degree of certainty that some form of deadly attack is imminent, but lack a crucial component of that plan, such as its precise location.  They must also have in their custody someone who they are reasonably certain has said information and would talk under torture or threat of torture.  They must then be able to accurately distinguish between true and false information which the subject may supply under torture.  They must then be able to use this information to form a plan of response which is effective at stopping the planned attack.  All of this must occur within a limited time frame allowed by the "ticking bomb".

==Effect of fiction==
Works of fiction, such as the television series ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', often rely on ticking time bomb scenarios for dramatic effect. According to the [[Parents Television Council]], given that each season represents a 24-hour period, [[Jack Bauer]] encounters someone who needs [[Critical reaction to 24 (TV series)#Torture|torturing]] to reveal a ticking bomb on average 12 times per day.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{cite web | last = Lithwick | first = Dahlia | date = July 26, 2008 | title = The Fiction Behind Torture Policy | work = [[Newsweek]] | url = http://www.newsweek.com/id/149009 | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Chertoff]], the [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] under the [[George W. Bush administration]], declared that ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' "reflects real life", [[John Yoo]], the former [[U.S. Justice Department|Justice Department]] lawyer who produced the [[torture memos]] cited Bauer in support while [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Antonin Scalia]] went further, "Jack Bauer saved [[Los Angeles]]... He saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Are you going to convict Jack Bauer?".&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt; One of the shows' creators stated:

{{quote|Most terrorism experts will tell you that the ‘ticking time bomb’ situation never occurs in real life, or very rarely. But on our show it happens every week.&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt;}}

The show uses the same [[enhanced interrogation|techniques]] that are used by the U.S. against terrorist suspects during the [[War on Terror]]. [[U.S. Army]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] Patrick Finnegan, the dean of the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]], and others, objected to the central theme of the show—that the letter of American law must be sacrificed for the country’s security—as it had an adverse effect on the training of actual American soldiers by advocating unethical and illegal behavior. As Finnegan said:

{{quote|The kids see it, and say, 'If torture is wrong, what about "24"?'}}

He continued,

{{quote|The disturbing thing is that although torture may cause [[Jack Bauer]] some angst, it is always the patriotic thing to do.&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt;}}

The "ticking time bomb scenario" is subject of the drama ''The Dershowitz Protocol'' by Canadian author Robert Fothergill. In that play, the American government has established a protocol of "intensified interrogation" for terrorist suspects which requires participation of the [[FBI]], [[CIA]] and the Department of Justice. The drama deals with the psychological pressure and the tense triangle of competences under the overriding importance that each participant has to negotiate the actions with his conscience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7452">A '''wardrobe malfunction''' is accidental exposure of a person's [[intimate part]]s due to a temporary failure of clothing to do its job. It is different from [[indecent exposure]] or [[Exhibitionism|flashing]], as the latter are deliberate, although some "malfunctions" are alleged to have been planned. There has been a long history of such incidents, though the term itself was only coined in the mid-2000s and has become one of the most common [[fashion faux pas]].&lt;ref&gt;Elaine's inadvertently exposed nipple in her photo Christmas card forms a plotline in the ''Seinfeld'' episode "[[The Pick]]", 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justin Timberlake]] first used the term referring to the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime-show controversy]], issuing a scripted apology at the [[2004 Grammy Awards]]. The phrase "wardrobe malfunction" has since been used by the media to refer to the incident and has entered [[pop culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Puente |first=Maria |title=Will 'Wardrobe Malfunction' Live On? |work=[[USA Today]] |date=February 4, 2004|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2004-02-03-wardrobe-malfunction-main_x.htm |access-date=October 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://archive.is/RM5N |archive-date=December 9, 2012 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is credited as having been coined by singers [[Justin Timberlake]] and [[Janet Jackson]], on February 1, 2004, to explain the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime-show controversy]]; the controversy is in reference to Jackson's right breast having been bared. Timberlake apologized for the incident, stating he was "sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=CNN |title=Apologetic Jackson says costume reveal went awry |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/02/02/superbowl.jackson |accessdate=April 22, 2008 |date=February 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''wardrobe malfunction'' appeared in numerous stories in major US consumer and business publications, newspapers, and major TV and radio broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;Rich Eisen, ''Total Access'', page 36, Macmillan, 2007, {{ISBN|0-312-36978-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Eric Alterman]] described the incident as "the most famous 'wardrobe malfunction' since [[Lady Godiva]]."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Alterman, ''Why We're Liberals: A Political Handbook for Post-Bush America'', page 186, Penguin USA, 2008, {{ISBN|0-670-01860-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[American Dialect Society]] had a number of related terms for [[word of the year]] nominations in 2004, including ''Janet moment'' ("unplanned bodily exposure at a public function"), ''boobgate'' ("scandal over Janet Jackson's exposed breast"), ''nipplegate'' (like boobgate, "but used earlier in squawk over Jackson's possible nipple ring") and ''wardrobe malfunction'' ("overexposure in a mammary way").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Glowka |first=Wayne |author2=[[American Dialect Society]] |title=2004 Words of the Year Nominations |url=http://www.americandialect.org/Glowka_ADS_2004_Words_of_the_Year.pdf |access-date=October 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819130159/http://www.americandialect.org/Glowka_ADS_2004_Words_of_the_Year.pdf |archive-date=August 19, 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been translated into other languages to describe similar incidents, including ''garderobedefect'' ([[Dutch (language)|Dutch]]),{{citation needed|reason=seems to appear frequently only in automatically translated texts|date=December 2012}} ''incident de garde-robe'' (French), ''disfunzione del guardaroba'' or ''incidente del guardaroba'' (Italian){{citation needed|reason=I am a native speaker and this doesn't even sound like Italian|date=October 2016}}, and ''mal funcionamiento de vestuario'' (Spanish).{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

An early reported instance of wardrobe malfunction occurred on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' in 1977 involving contestant Yolanda Bowersley, though such incidents were not called by that name at the time.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Social phenomenon==
In ''DJing for Dummies'', John Steventon describes a range of wardrobe malfunctions from a revelation of [[buttock cleavage]] to visible [[panty line]]s.&lt;ref&gt;John Steventon, ''DJing for Dummies'', page 352, For Dummies, 2007, {{ISBN|0-470-03275-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bikini]]s also present celebrity wardrobe malfunction opportunities to the [[paparazzi]] in the form of [[wedgie]]s or bikini-top malfunctions.&lt;ref&gt;Lorna Edwards, [http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/06/02/1148956539436.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 You've still got it, babe], ''[[The Age]]'', June 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Wedding Planning and Management: Consultancy for Diverse Clients'', Maggie Daniels warns, "With so many people involved in the wedding party, a wardrobe malfunction is guaranteed to happen."&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Daniels, Margaret J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6976">The success of [[World Book and Copyright Day]], launched in 1996, encouraged [[UNESCO]] to develop the concept of '''World Book Capital''' City, selecting [[Madrid]] as the Capital for 2001. This was again a success, and so UNESCO's General Conference resolved to make the designation of a World Book Capital City an annual event.

UNESCO invited the [[International Publishers Association]], the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] and the [[International Booksellers Federation]] to participate in the nomination process, to ensure the three major branches of the book industry can participate in the decision.

The nomination does not include any financial prize; it rather acknowledges the best programmes dedicated to books and reading.

==Nomination criteria==
The nominating committee welcomes programmes &amp;mdash; presented by or endorsed by the mayor of the city making the application — that promote and foster reading. The programmes are to run from one World Book and Copyright Day and the next. The nomination committee will turn its attention to certain criteria:
* the degree of participation of all levels (from the municipal to the international level)
* the programme's potential impact
* the scope and quality of the activities proposed by the candidates, and the extent to which they involve writers, publishers, booksellers and libraries
* any other projects promoting books and reading
* the extent to which the programme respects the principles of freedom of expression, as stated by the UNESCO Constitution as well as by Articles 19 and 27 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and by the [[Agreement on the Importation of Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials]]

[[File:0066-Shield-in-the-Meyrick-Collection-q75-492x500.jpg|thumb|right]]
[[File:0067-Circular-British-Shield-q75-496x500.jpg|thumb|right]]

The '''Yetholm-type shield''' is a distinctive type of shield dating from 1200-800 BC ([[Bronze Age]]). The known [[shield]]s come from Britain and Ireland, excepting one from [[Denmark]]. Their modern name comes from [[Yetholm]] in southern [[Scotland]] where a [[peat bog]] yielded three examples. Twenty two examples are known, although some of these are fragmentary, and a further seven or eight are known from written sources but are lost today.{{sfn|Uckelmann|2011a}} The shields vary significantly in size, but are otherwise similar.

Rock carvings from this period made in Southern Scandinavia include depictions of shields decorated with concentric rings or rings of dots. The artist could not hope to show the fine detail of a Yetholm-type shield, but the similarity is striking.

The impressive shields would have indicated high social status.{{sfn|Uckelmann|2011a}}

==Construction==
The shields are made of a copper alloy sheet about 0.6&amp;nbsp;mm thick. The alloy is a high-tin [[bronze]]: [[copper]] with 11-14% [[tin]]. They are round with a central domed [[shield boss|boss]] created by hammering out from the back. The shield face is covered in raised ridges in concentric rings, each a couple of millimetres high. Between the ridges are rings of small hemispherical bosses about 4&amp;nbsp;mm across. Decoration was formed by hammering from the reverse ([[Repoussé]]).

The outer edge of the shield has been folded back and hammered down to form a strong rim. A handle is riveted across the open bowl of the boss, made from a thicker piece of sheet bronze folded over; also attached are a pair of metal tabs for a carrying strap. [[Rivet]] heads are on the front for fitting attachments, but are similar to the decorative raised bosses and difficult to identify.

Probably a flanged punch created the bosses to a uniform size and depth, although no contemporary tool has been found to accomplish this. The [[Repoussé and chasing|embossing]] would probably require the work piece to be supported, conceivably by a bed of [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] or [[lead]]. Some eye-judgement was required, which is revealed in the detail of the spacing of the bosses. As the craftsman came to complete a ring, the spacing would be changed slightly so as to ensure an even design and make the starting place inconspicuous. The shields show a high degree of accomplishment and, given the degree of similarity, it is likely that all were made in the same workshop by a few craftsmen.

==Variations==
[[File:Yetholm type shield, South Cadbury 01.JPG|thumb|right|Yetholm-type shield from [[Cadbury Castle, Somerset|South Cadbury]]. Displayed at [[Museum of Somerset]], [[Taunton]].]]

The shields vary in size and in the number of embossed rings, but the size of the embossed features is consistent. The largest shield (found at [[Ayrshire]]) has twenty nine circular ridges and twenty nine rings of bosses; the smallest (originally thought to have been from [[County Antrim]] but actually from The River Thames) has eleven ridges and rings.{{sfn|Uckelmann|2011a}}

The overall design, and especially the tabs, indicate that the shield did not have a wooden backing or other reinforcement, though one shield from Lough Gur is believed to have been backed with leather (which was initially written off as dried peat). The embossed design and folded rim impart some stiffness, but some have suggested that the shields were too flimsy for combat. In a 1952 [[experimental archaeology|archaeology experiment]] by John Coles, a reconstruction was made from copper hardened to match a Yetholm-type shield, and it was hit with a replica bronze sword. The shield was cut in two by a single stroke. However, experiments by Barry Molloy and Kate Anderson{{sfn|Northover in Needham et al. 2012, 482-3}} have pointed out that bronze, the original material used, is substantially harder than even the hardened copper used by Coles, and that he appears to have used a much thinner sheet of copper than in the original designs.{{sfn|Uckelmann|2011b|p=195}} Additional design features such as small handles with only about 110&amp;nbsp;mm for the fingers to grip, have also been cited as evidence that the shields were not used for combat.{{sfn|Uckelmann|2011b|p=195}}

Some shields have damage likely to have occurred as a part of a sacrificial ceremony. The South Cadbury specimen was laid in a ditch and stabbed three times with a wooden stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba46/ba46feat.html| work=British Archeology | title=Britain in the age of warrior heroes.| author=Richard Osgood | accessdate=1 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its discovery prompted metallurgical analysis of this and other examples by Peter Northover, strongly suggesting that, rather than the accepted range of 1000 to 800 BC, these shields were manufactured in the 12th century BC. Carbon dating implied that the South Cadbury example was deposited in the mid 10th century BC.&lt;ref name="Tabor 2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tabor |first=Richard |authorlink= |title=Cadbury Castle: A hillfort and landscapes |year=2008 |publisher=The History Press |location=Stroud |pages=84–92|isbn=978-0-7524-4715-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wittenham shield.jpg|thumb|right|The Wittenham shield, showing perforations that may have been caused by a spearhead]]
However, one shield from [[Long Wittenham]] in [[Oxfordshire]] has two lozenge-shaped perforations, interpreted as piercings caused by a spearhead, and other piercings hammered flat to close the gap, suggesting that the shield was a veteran of several combat encounters.

With the exception of the specimen found at [[Cadbury Castle, Somerset|South Cadbury]] (by [[archaeologist]] Josh Williams&lt;ref&gt;Tabor 2008, 86&lt;/ref&gt;), all were found in wet contexts. They formed part of a widespread practice of placing valuable objects in wet places.{{sfn|Uckelmann|2011a}} Presumably, this practice was motivated by religious beliefs, the details of which are unknown - although other ancient societies such as the [[Celts]] had similar practices.
