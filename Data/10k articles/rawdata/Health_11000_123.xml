      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11214">'''Abortion in Israel''' is permitted when determined by a termination committee under various circumstances, with the vast majority of cases being approved {{as of|2014|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.cbs.gov.il/reader/newhodaot/hodaa_template.html?hodaa=201605367 Applications for Pregnancy Termination in 2014 ]&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of abortion in Israel has steadily declined since 1988.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Compared to the world, abortion rates in Israel are moderate. According to government data, in Israel, abortion rates in 2014 are 9.7 per 1,000 women of childbearing age, lower than England (16.2) and the United States (13.2).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Abortion in Israel had been illegal prior to 1977. It became legal subject to termination committee approval under the penal code of 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nevo.co.il/law_html/Law01/073_022.htm The Penal Regulations (Termination of Pregnancy), 5738-1978 ]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 2014, however, approval for an [[abortion]] in [[Israel]] by a termination committee was given under more limited circumstances, such as if the woman is unmarried, because of age (if the woman is under the age of 18 - the legal marriage age in Israel - or over the age of 40), the pregnancy was conceived under illegal circumstances (rape, statutory rape, etc.) or an incestuous relationship, [[birth defects]], risk of health to the mother, and life of the mother.&lt;ref name=israelabortion&gt;Update: Israel's abortion law now among world's most liberal -- Free abortions for all women http://www.timesofisrael.com/israels-abortion-law-now-among-worlds-most-liberal/&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to 2014, abortion up to the age of 33 can be provided for under the nationally funded health basket.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4471052,00.html סל התרופות 2014: הפלות חינם גם ללא סיבה רפואית]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics report from 2004, in 2003, most abortion requests were granted, with 19,500 legal abortions performed and 200 requests for abortion denied. Reasons for termination went as follows: The woman was unmarried (42%), because of illegal circumstances (11%), health risks to the woman (about 20%), age of the woman (11%), and fetal birth defects (about 17%).&lt;ref name="cbs.gov.il"&gt;{{He icon}} Central Bureau of Statistics. (August 30, 2005). {{DOClink|[http://www.cbs.gov.il/hodaot2005n/01_05_191b.doc Patterns of Fertility in Israel in 2004]}}. Retrieved February 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Women who would not qualify for an abortion under the statutory scheme may seek an abortion at a private clinic.

It was reported in 2012 that about half of all abortions in Israel were performed in private clinics, i. e., without committee approval. Women who undergo such an abortion do not face criminal penalties, but physicians who perform them face a fine or up to five years' imprisonment; however, there have been no known prosecutions of physicians for performing non-committee-approved abortions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.loc.gov/law/help/israel_2012-007460_IL_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was also reported in 2007 and 2011 that about 40,000 abortions take place in Israel every year, about half of them committee approved.&lt;ref name="cbs.gov.il"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.israeltoday.co.il/NewsItem/tabid/178/nid/22647/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal position==
Clauses 312-321 of the 1977 [[Criminal code|penal code]] limit the circumstances when an abortion is legal in Israel. Abortions must be approved by a termination committee. Abortions can only be performed by licensed [[gynecology|gynecologists]] in recognized medical facilities that are specifically and publicly recognized as a provider of abortions.&lt;ref name="penal"&gt;[[wikisource:he:חוק העונשין|Israeli penal code]] at the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Israeli Cabinet updated the 1977 law in 2014 to allow [[abortion on demand]] for nearly every woman in the country seeking an abortion.&lt;ref name=israelabortion /&gt;

===Circumstances under which abortion is approved===
Under a 1977 abortion law, a termination committee can approve an abortion, under sub-section 316a,&lt;ref name="penal" /&gt; in the following circumstances:

# The woman is younger than the legal marriage age in Israel (which currently is 18, raised from 17 in April 2013),&lt;ref&gt;Ynetnews.com, 11.4.13: [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4449522,00.html Knesset raises marriage age to 18].&lt;/ref&gt; or older than forty. (This was later amended to also include women under the age of twenty.)&lt;ref name=israelabortion /&gt;
# The pregnancy was conceived under illegal circumstances ([[rape]], [[statutory rape]], etc.), in an [[incest]]uous relationship, or outside of marriage.
# The [[fetus]] may have a physical or mental [[birth defect]].
# Continued pregnancy may put the woman's life in risk, or damage her physically or mentally.

Previously, cases where the woman is between the ages of 20-33, and/or was granted an abortion due to the baby having been conceived under illegal circumstances or incest, the fetus had a serious physical or mental defect, the mother was unmarried, or the mother's health was in danger, the state pays for the abortion. However, the law was modified in 2014 to allow a free state-funded "health basket" for any woman seeking an abortion.&lt;ref name=israelabortion /&gt; Women who get pregnant while serving in the IDF are entitled to free, state-funded abortion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jta.org/news/article/2012/07/09/3100216/op-ed-dont-set-back-reproductive-rights-for-israeli-women&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/israels-abortion-law-now-among-worlds-most-liberal/ Israel’s abortion law now among world's most liberal]&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, most requests for abortion that qualify for the above are granted, and leniency is shown especially under the clause for emotional or psychological damage to the pregnant woman. The committees approve 98% of requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israels-abortion-law-now-among-worlds-most-liberal/#ixzz2pfY4gXn0|title=Israel's abortion law now among world’s most liberal|author=Debra Kamin|publisher=The Times of Israel|date=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure of the committee===
There are 41 termination committees operating in public or private hospitals across Israel. These committees consist of three members, two of which are licensed [[physician]]s, and one a [[social work]]er.&lt;ref name="penal" /&gt; Of the two physicians, one must be an expert on [[obstetrics and gynaecology]], and the other one either OB/GYN, [[internal medicine]], [[psychiatry]], [[general practitioner|family medicine]], or [[public health]]. At least one member must be a woman. Six separate committees consider abortion requests when the fetus is beyond 24 weeks old.

==Abortion debate in Israel==
There is an [[abortion debate]] in Israel, although it is sidelined by more publicized and controversial issues. The debate as to the morality of abortion is antecedent to the debate about [[separation of church and state|separation of religion and state]] in the context of Israel as a [[Jewish State]] and a [[democracy|democratic]].

[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] organizations, including political parties, strongly oppose abortion because [[Halakhah|Jewish law]] views abortion as a (lesser) form of murder. Political parties that champion this view include [[Shas]], a [[Sephardic]] Haredi party; [[United Torah Judaism]], an [[Ashkenazi]] Haredi party; and HaBayit HaYehudi ([[Jewish Home]]), a [[Religious Zionist]] party. A study published in 2001 found that opposition to abortion among Israelis was correlated to strong religious beliefs - particularly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] beliefs - below-average income, larger family size, and identification with [[right-wing politics]].&lt;ref&gt;Remennick, Larissa I., &amp; Hetsron, Amir. (2001). [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0038-4941.00033?cookieSet=1&amp;journalCode=ssqu Public Attitudes toward Abortion in Israel: A Research Note]. ''Social Science Quarterly, 82 (2),'' 420–431. Retrieved February 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The left-wing party [[Meretz]] argues in favor of legalized abortion for reasons of [[personal liberty]]. In 2006, [[Knesset|MK]] Zehava Gal-On of [[Meretz]] proposed a bill that would eliminate the termination committees, effectively [[decriminalization|decriminalizing]] unrestricted abortion. Gal-On argued that women with financial means can have abortions in private [[clinic]]s, bypassing the committee and therefore gaining rights based on their wealth. The bill was rejected by a wide margin.

When the relevant section of the penal code was originally written, it contained a "social clause" permitting women to seek abortions for social reasons, such as economic distress.&lt;ref name="penal" /&gt; The clause was withdrawn in 1980 under the initiative of the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] parties (see [[Shas]], [[United Torah Judaism]], and [[National Religious Party]]).

This clause is still under debate in Israel. In 2004, [[Knesset|MK]] Reshef Chen of [[Shinui]] submitted an addendum to reinstate the clause, arguing that under present circumstances, women with financial problems must lie to the termination committee to obtain approval under the emotional or psychological damage clause, and that "no advanced country compels its citizens to lie in order to preserve [[religion|religious]], [[male chauvinism|chauvinistic]], patronizing archaic values". Women's organizations such as [[Naamat]] supported the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{He icon}} Ruti, Sinai. (June 8, 2004). "[http://news.walla.co.il/?w=//553906 Proposal: Women in poor financial condition will be able to get an abortion]." ''[[Walla!]].'' Retrieved February 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's organizations such as Naamat&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naamat.org/ Naamat official site]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shdulat HaNashim]] (women's lobby)&lt;ref&gt;{{He icon}} [http://www.iwn.org.il/inner.asp?newsid=53 IWN official site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819171104/http://www.iwn.org.il/inner.asp?newsid=53 |date=August 19, 2007 }}, legal pregnancy termination in Israel&lt;/ref&gt; argue in favor for [[feminist]], [[pro-choice]] reasons, such as [[reproductive rights]].

[[Efrat (organization)|Efrat]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efrat.org.il/en/ Efrat official site]&lt;/ref&gt; is a religious organization that lobbies against abortions, as well as offering financial support to women who are considering abortion for economic reasons. Efrat's campaign includes stickers with the slogan, "Don't abort me" ({{lang-he|אל תפילו אותי}}). Be'ad Chaim&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beadchaim.com/ Be'ad Chaim Official site]&lt;/ref&gt; is a Messianic Christian anti-abortion non-profit association. Another organization which provides financial support and counseling to women considering abortion is Just One Life (J.O.L.) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justonelife.org/ Just One Life - Official site]&lt;/ref&gt; - which in Hebrew is known as Nefesh Achat B'Yisrael.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1586">An '''anxiotropic''' agent is one that modifies [[anxiety]], a human emotion that has [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] processes in animals. In [[psychopharmacology]] anxiotropic agents consist of two categories of [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] drugs: [[anxiolytic]]s that reduce anxiety and may be used therapeutically, and [[anxiogenic]] compounds that increase anxiety.

Most anxiolytic agents are [[minor tranquilizers]], the founding compound of which was [[meprobamate]], marketed in the United States as Miltown. Meprobamate was eventually eclipsed by the [[benzodiazepines]]. The target of both categories of anxiotropic compounds is the [[GABAA receptor]].

Globally, the two most widely used [[psychoactive]] drugs are anxiotropic agents: [[ethanol]], an anxiolytic, and [[caffeine]], an anxiogenic. While intake of both ethanol and caffeine has been shown to exert an anxiolytic  effect, their withdrawal is associated with anxiogenic effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The anxiolytic and anxiogenic actions of ethanol in a mouse model|date=2013-03-25 |pmid=2899150 | volume=40 |journal=J Pharm Pharmacol |pages=197-202 | last1 = Costall | first1 = B | last2 = Kelly | first2 = ME | last3 = Naylor | first3 = RJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Anxiety-like behaviors following chronic ethanol exposure|date=2013-03-25 |pmid=15642625 | doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2004.11.001 |volume=28 |journal=Neurosci Biobehav Rev |pages=837-50 | last1 = Kliethermes | first1 = CL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Children's Oncology Group logo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Children's Oncology Group]]
The '''Children’s Oncology Group''' ('''COG'''), a clinical trials group supported by the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI), is the world’s largest organization devoted exclusively to pediatric cancer research.&lt;ref name="NCI Cancer Bulletin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pediatric Oncology Partnerships Are Models for Success|url=http://www.cancer.gov/aboutnci/ncicancerbulletin/archive/2008/031808/page1|work=NCI Cancer Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The COG conducts a spectrum of [[clinical research]] and [[translational research]] trials for infants, children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer.

Almost all centers that treat children with cancer in the US and Canada are part of the COG, with more than 200 centers in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand. The member institutions have multidisciplinary teams consisting of physicians, research scientists, nurses, psychologists, pharmacists and other specialists.&lt;ref name="O'Leary"&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Leary|first=M|author2=Krailo M|author3=Anderson JR|author4=Reaman GH|title=Progress in Childhood Cancer: 50 Years of Research Collaboration, a Report from the Children's Oncology Group|journal=Seminars in Oncology|year=2008|volume=35|pages=484–493|doi=10.1053/j.seminoncol.2008.07.008|pmc=2702720|pmid=18929147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group, with more than 7,500 experts worldwide, has nearly 100 active clinical-translational trials open at any given time. These trials include  treatment for many types of childhood cancers, studies aimed at determining the underlying biology of these diseases, and trials involving new and emerging treatments, supportive care, and survivorship. More than 90% of 13,500 children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer each year in the United States are cared for at [http://applications.childrensoncologygroup.org/coglist/resources/cog.aspx Children’s Oncology Group member institutions].&lt;ref name="O'Leary" /&gt;

== History ==
The cooperative group system for clinical research began in 1955 with a consortium focused on childhood cancer research.&lt;ref name="O'Leary" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bleyer|first=WA|year=1997|title=The U.S. pediatric cancer clinical trials programmes: international implications and the way forward|journal=Eur J Cancer|volume=33|issue=9|pages=1439–1447|doi=10.1016/S0959-8049(97)00249-9|pmid=9337687}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schilsky"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=A concise history of the cancer and leukemia group B|journal=Clin Cancer Res|volume=12|issue=11 Pt 2|pages=3553s-3555s|doi=10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-9000|pmid=16740784|vauthors=Schilsky RL, McIntyre OR, Holland JF, Frei E}}&lt;/ref&gt;   By the mid-1990s, there were nine groups funded by the NCI to conduct research in adults with cancer, and four  focused on childhood cancer research. Two groups, the [[Children's Cancer Study Group]] (CCG) and the [[Pediatric Oncology Group]] (POG) studied a diverse array of childhood cancers, while two others, the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group (IRSG) and the [[National Wilms Tumor Study Group]] (NWTS) were specific for particular cancers. In 2000, the four pediatric groups  merged to create the Children's Oncology Group.&lt;ref name="O'Leary" /&gt;  Since then, its researchers have published well over one thousand research manuscripts in peer-reviewed scientific journals&lt;ref name="O'Leary" /&gt;  COG has enrolled more children with cancer on clinical trials than any other organization in the world.

== Research studies ==
The group's research studies encompass hematologic malignancies, solid tumors, central nervous system tumors, and rare cancers. [[Hematologic malignancies]] include the most common childhood cancer, [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]], as well as [[acute myeloid leukemia]], [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], and [[Hodgkin lymphoma]]. Pediatric [[solid tumors]] studied include [[neuroblastoma]], tumors of bone ([[Ewing sarcoma]], [[osteosarcoma]]), tumors of the kidney ([[Wilms' tumor]]), [[rhabdomyosarcoma]] and other [[soft tissue sarcomas]]. [[Brain tumors|Central nervous system (brain) tumors]] are the second most common form of childhood cancer. COG conducts research in children with [[medulloblastoma]], [[ependymoma]], [[brainstem gliomas]], low and high-grade [[gliomas]], and [[germ cell tumors]]. The large multi-site structure of COG also allows it to conduct research into very rare childhood cancer including [[retinoblastoma]], [[hepatoblastoma]], and other tumors.&lt;ref name="O'Leary" /&gt; 

In addition to disease specific research, COG conducts studies in developmental therapeutics (new cancer [[drug development]]), supportive care, [[epidemiology]], [[stem cell transplantation]], [[behavioral sciences]] and survivorship.&lt;ref name=Reaman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reaman|first=GH|title=Pediatric cancer research from past successes through collaboration to future transdisciplinary research|journal=J Pediatr Oncol Nurs|year=2004|volume=21|pages=123–127|pmid=15296038|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The COG is primarily funded by the NCI,  the primary or Chair’s grant supports research operations and funds personnel at member institutions conducting research, and the statistics and data center grant supports these essential research functions.&lt;ref name="Nass"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nass|first=SJ|author2=Balogh E|author3=Mendelsohn J|year=2011|title=A National Cancer Clinical Trials Network: recommendations from the Institute of Medicine|journal=Am J Ther|volume=18|issue=5|pages=382–391|doi=10.1097/MJT.0b013e3181ff7e23|pmid=21326081|pmc=3135766}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other key grants include the COG Phase 1 Consortium grant, supporting 21 COG institutions charged with early phase clinical trials,&lt;ref name="CTEP Major Initiatives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctep.cancer.gov/MajorInitiatives/Childrens_Oncology_Group.htm|title=Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Major Initiatives|work=National Cancer Institute|publisher=NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20111014233313/http://dcp.cancer.gov/programs-resources/programs/ccop Community Cancer Oncology Program (CCOP)] grant.&lt;ref name="Community Clinical Oncology program Research Base"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fundedresearch.cancer.gov/search/details?action=abstract&amp;grantNum=5U10CA095861-09&amp;grantID=7844913&amp;grtSCDC=FY%202010&amp;absID=7844913&amp;absSCDC=CURRENT|title=Community Clinical Oncology program Research Base|work=NCI Funded Research Portfolio}}&lt;/ref&gt; These is additional funding from other granting agencies and from philanthropic sources (cog-foundation.org).

'''Cigarette packets in Australia''' have undergone significant changes. Since 1 December 2012 all forms of branding [[logo]]s, colours, and promotional texts are banned from [[cigarette]] pack designs.

==History==
In 1973, Australia's first [[Warning label|health warning]] on cigarette packages appeared with the simple message 'Warning—Smoking is a health hazard'.&lt;ref&gt;Scollo, Michelle &amp; Haslam, Indra (2008). [http://www.tobaccoinaustralia.org.au/chapter-12-tobacco-products/attachment-12-1-health-warnings "Attachment 12.1 Health warnings"]. Tobacco in Australia. Cancer Council Victoria. Retrieved 30 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1 March 2006, graphic images depicting the effects of smoking cigarettes have been required to be displayed on cigarette packets.

Since 1 December 2012 all forms of branding logos, colours, and promotional texts are banned from cigarette pack designs. The requirement is for [[plain cigarette packaging]] showing only brand name and health warning messages.

==Development around the world==
{{Main article|Plain tobacco packaging}}

Following Australia's lead a number of other countries also require standardized packaging including [[France]] (applies to cigarettes sold after 1 January 2017), [[United Kingdom]] (21 May 2017), New Zealand (6 June 2018), [[Norway]] (1 July 2018),  [[Ireland]] (30 September 2018) and [[Hungary]] (20 May 2019).

As a result of the enactment of the December 2015 plain tobacco packaging bill, on 1 January 2017 [[France]] became the second country in the world, after Australia, and the first in the [[European Union]] to require tobacco products to be sold in [[plain tobacco packaging|plain packaging]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.fctc.org/fca-news/opinion-pieces/1413-france-and-uk-join-australia-as-plain-packing-leaders France and the UK join Australia as plain packing leaders]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] voted 367–113 in favour of plain cigarette packaging in the [[United Kingdom]]. The sale of plain packs is compulsory since 21 May 2017.

==Warnings==
{{main|Tobacco packaging warning messages}}
For cigarette packets, warnings include:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
* Smoking causes peripheral vascular disease
* Smoking causes emphysema
* Smoking causes mouth and throat cancer
* Smoking clogs your arteries
* Don't let children breathe your smoke
{{col-break}}
* Smoking – A leading cause of death
* Quitting will improve your health
* Smoking harms unborn babies
* Smoking causes blindness
* Smoking causes lung cancer
{{col-break}}
* Smoking causes heart disease
* Smoking doubles your risk of stroke
* Smoking is addictive
* Tobacco smoke is toxic
{{col-end}}
With each warning is an accompanying graphic, and detailed information on the back of the packet. In addition, [[cigar]] and [[Shag (tobacco)|loose tobacco]] packets show other, slightly altered warnings. These warnings target the misconception that alternative, non-cigarette tobacco products are less harmful.

There have been calls to expand the range of warnings to reflect current research into the effects of smoking, such as impacts on fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Tegan |title=Everyone knows smoking causes lung cancer, but what about infertility and arthritis? |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2018-07-09/smoking-graphic-warning-label-refresh-to-improve-risk-knowledge/9947728 |accessdate=9 July 2018 |work=ABC News |date=9 July 2018 |language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian cigarette packaging laws also prohibit the use of terms such as 'light', 'mild', 'extra mild', etc. The three major Australian tobacco manufacturers agreed to stop using these terms, after investigation of complaints of misleading and deceptive terms were made to the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] (ACCC) in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Liberman, Jonathan (2008). [http://www.tobaccoinaustralia.org.au/chapter-16-litigation/16-2-other-litigation-involving-the-tobacco-indust "16.2.1 ACCC action on 'light' and 'mild' cigarettes"]. Tobacco in Australia. Cancer Council of Victoria. Retrieved 30 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This has assisted in counteracting the belief that some cigarette varieties are less harmful than others. To the same effect, while the carbon monoxide, nicotine and tar content of particular brands of cigarettes used to be mandated, the display and/or advertisement these figures is now prohibited under the government's "All Cigarettes are Toxic" campaign.

Although there has been no concrete proof as of 2014 that plain packaging has affected cigarette purchases in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, S., &amp; de Silva, A. (2014).

The Medical Journal of Australia, 200(1), 29-32. {{doi|10.5694/mja13.11070}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been a significant increase of calls to [http://www.quitnow.gov.au/ quitline] in some states&lt;ref&gt;Young, J., Stacey, I., Dobbins, T., Dunlop, S., Dessaix, A., &amp; Currow, D.

The Medical Journal of Australia, 200(1), 29-32. {{doi|10.5694/mja13.11070}}&lt;/ref&gt; that would suggest plain packaging might encourage smokers to attempt or at least seek help with quitting smoking.

==Religious and cultural conflicts==

===Ancient Near East===
[[Image:Isaac's circumcision, Regensburg c1300.jpg|thumb|250px|Circumcision of Abraham's son Isaac. Regensburg Pentateuch, Israel Museum, Jerusalem (c. 1300).]]

The [[Book of Genesis]] explains circumcision as a [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with God given to [[Abraham]],{{bibleref2c|Gen|17:10}} but some scholars reject the historicity of these accounts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thompson, Thomas |title=The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives: The Quest for the Historical Abraham |publisher=Trinity Press International |location=Valley Forge, Pa |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lwrzapZYqFAC&amp;dq |quote=It must be concluded that any such historicity ... about the patriarchs of Genesis is hardly possible and totally improbable. (p. 328) |isbn=978-1-56338-389-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and look elsewhere for the origin of Jewish circumcision. One explanation, dating from [[Herodotus]], is that the custom was acquired from the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], possibly during the period of enslavement.&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt; A competing hypothesis, based on linguistic/ethnographic work begun in the 19th century,&lt;ref name="Barton"/&gt; suggests circumcision was a common tribal custom among [[Semitic people|Semitic tribes]] ([[Jews]], [[Arabs]], and [[Phoenicians]]).

The Jewish and Islamic traditions both see circumcision as a way to distinguish a group from its neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;See the story of [[Dinah|Dina &amp; Shechem]] in Genesis.  Also the mass circumcision during the [[exodus from Egypt]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bible]] records "uncircumcised" being used as a derogatory reference for opponents{{bibleref2c|1Sam|17:26}} and Jewish victory in battle that culminated in mass post-mortem circumcision, to provide an account of the number of enemy casualties{{bibleref2c|1Sam|18:27}}. Jews were also required to circumcise all household members, including slaves{{bibleref2c|Gen|17:12-14}}&amp;nbsp;– a practice that would later put them into collision with Roman and Christian law (see below).

===Classical civilization===
In 167 BCE [[Judea]] was part of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Its ruler, [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] (175–165 BCE), smarting from a defeat in a war against [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], [[Anti-Judaism|banned traditional Jewish religious practices]], and attempted to forcibly let the Jews accept [[Hellenistic culture]]. Throughout the country Jews were ordered, with the threat of [[execution]], to sacrifice [[pigs]] to [[Greek gods]] (the normal practice in the [[Ancient Greek religion]]), desecrate the [[Shabbat]], eat unkosher animals (especially [[pork]]), and relinquish their Jewish scriptures. Antiochus' decree also outlawed Jewish circumcision, and parents who violated his order were hanged along with their infants.&lt;ref name= "Remondino1891"/&gt;{{bibleref2c|1Mac|1:46-67}} According to [[Tacitus]], as quoted by Hodges, Antiochus "endeavoured to abolish Jewish [[Superstitio|superstition]] and to [[Hellenization|introduce Greek civilization]]."&lt;ref name="Hodges JE"/&gt; According to [[Rabbinical literature|rabbinical accounts]], he desecrated the [[Second Temple]] of

[[Classical antiquity|Classical]], [[Hellenistic culture|Hellenistic]], and [[Roman culture]] found circumcision to be cruel and repulsive.&lt;ref name="Hodges JE"&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=514&amp;letter=C&amp;search=circumcision#2 Jewish Encyclopedia: Circumcision: In Apocryphal and Rabbinical Literature]: "Contact with Grecian life, especially at the games of the arena [which involved [[nudity]]], made this distinction obnoxious to the Hellenists, or antinationalists; and the consequence was their attempt to appear like the Greeks by [[epispasm]] ("making themselves foreskins"; I Macc. i. 15; Josephus, "Ant." xii. 5, § 1; Assumptio Mosis, viii.; I Cor. vii. 18; Tosef., Shab. xv. 9; Yeb. 72a, b; Yer.

As for the anti-circumcision law passed by [[Hadrian]], it is considered by many to be, together with his decision to build a Roman temple upon the ruins of the [[Second Temple]] and dedicate it to [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], one of the main causes of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] (132-135 CE), which was brutally crushed;&lt;ref name="Cassius Dio"&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''[[Cassius Dio#Roman History|Roman History]]'', book 69, 12.1-14.3.

Around 140, his successor [[Antoninus Pius]] (138-161 CE) exempted Jews who circumcised their sons, though not their servants or slaves, from the decree against circumcision.&lt;ref name="Hodges JE"/&gt; Jewish nationalists' ([[Pharisees]] and [[Zealots]]) response to the decrees also took a more moderate form: circumcisions were secretly performed, even on dead Jews.&lt;ref name="Remondino1891"/&gt;

However, there were also many Jews, known as "[[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenizers]]", that viewed Hellenization and [[social integration]] of the Jewish people in the [[Greco-Roman world]] favourably,&lt;ref name="Slate"/&gt; and pursued a completely different approach: accepting the Emperor's decrees and even making efforts to [[Foreskin restoration|restore their foreskins]] to better assimilate into [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic society]].&lt;ref name="Kennedy2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodges JE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt; The latter approach was common during the reign of Antiochus, and again under Roman rule. The foreskin was restored by one of two methods, that were later revived in the late 20th century; both were described in detail by the Greek physician [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] in his comprehensive encyclopedic work ''[[De Medicina]]'', written during the reign of [[Tiberius]] (14-37 CE).&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="restore"/&gt; The surgical method involved freeing the skin covering the penis by dissection, and then pulling it forward over the glans; he also described a simpler surgical technique used on men whose [[Aposthia|prepuce is naturally insufficient]] to cover their glans.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="restore"/&gt; The second approach, known as ''[[epispasm]]'',&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="restore"/&gt; was nonsurgical: a [[restoration device]] called ''Pondus Judaeus'' ("Jewish burden"),&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="restore"/&gt; a special weight made of bronze, copper, or leather, was affixed to the [[penis]], pulling its skin downward. Overtime, a new foreskin was generated, or a short prepuce was lengthened, by means of [[tissue expansion]].&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="restore"/&gt; [[Martial]] also mentioned the instrument in ''Epigrammaton'' (book 7:35).&lt;ref name="restore"/&gt;

The [[Apostle Paul]] referred to these practices in his [[Pauline epistles|letters]],&lt;ref name="restore"/&gt; saying: "Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised."{{bibleref2c|1Cor|7:18}} But he also explicitly denounced the [[Forced circumcision|forcing of circumcision upon non-Jews]], rejecting and condemning those [[Judaizers]] who stipulated the ritual to [[Gentile]] [[Christianity in the 1st century|Christians]], labelling such advocates as "false brothers"{{bibleref2c|Gal|2:4}} ([[Circumcision controversies#Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|see below]]). In the mid-2nd century [[Tannaim|Rabbinical Jewish leaders]] introduced a radical method of circumcision, the ''periah'', that left the glans totally uncovered, making it almost impossible to restore the foreskin.&lt;ref name="restore"/&gt;

Under the first Christian emperor, [[Constantine I|Constantine]], the two rescripts of Antoninus on circumcision were re-enacted and again in the 6th century under [[Justinian]]. These restrictions on circumcision made their way into both secular and [[Canon law]] and "at least through the [[Middle Ages]], preserved and enhanced laws banning Hebrews from circumcising non-Hebrews and banning Christians or slaves of any religious affiliation from undergoing circumcision for any reason."&lt;ref name="Hodges2001"/&gt;

===Early Christianity===
There was debate in the early Church on whether [[Gentiles]] needed to be circumcised in order to join the communities; some [[Jewish Christians]] insisted that it was necessary. The [[Council of Jerusalem]] (50 CE) decreed that [[Circumcision in the Bible|circumcision]] was not a requirement for Gentiles, which became known as the "[[Council of Jerusalem#Issues and outcome|Apostolic Decree]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bechtel |first1=Florentine |title=Catholic Encyclopedia |date=1910 |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |chapter-url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08537a.htm |chapter=Judaizers}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the first acts [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|differentiating Early Christianity from Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kohler |first1=Kaufmann |last2=Krauss |first2=Samuel |title=Jewish Encyclopedia |date=1906 |publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls Co |location=New York |chapter-url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2456-baptism |chapter=Baptism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 140 CE, the [[Tannaim]] made [[Brit milah|circumcision requirements]] stricter, in order to make the procedure irreversible.&lt;ref name=gollaher_2001_ch1&gt;{{cite book |last=Gollaher|first=David|author-link=David Gollaher|title=Circumcision: A History Of The World's Most Controversial Surgery |chapter=1, ''The Jewish Tradition'' |pages=1–30 |date=February 2001 |publisher=Basic Books|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-465-02653-1 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usEzSffvPBMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
In the early 7th century, Muhammad welded together many Semitic tribes of the Arabian peninsula into the kernel of a rapidly expanding Muslim movement. The one thing that can be said with some certainty is that male and female circumcision was already well established among these tribes, and probably had been for more than a thousand years, most likely as a fertility rite. Herodotus had noticed the practice among various Semite nations in the 5th century BCE, and [[Josephus]] had specifically mentioned circumcision as a tradition among Arabs in the 1st century CE.&lt;ref name="Barton"&gt;{{cite book |author=George Barton |title=A sketch of Semitic origins, social and religious |year=1902 |publisher=Macmillan |oclc=1850150 |pages=98–100 |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924029872938 |isbn=978-1-4286-1575-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some narrations attributed to Muhammad in which he approves of female circumcision; however, many scholars believe that these narrations are weak and lack authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Female Circumcision and Islam; Sheikh (Dr.) `Abd al-Rahmân b.

The practice of circumcision is sometimes characterized as a part of ''[[fitrah]]'' as mentioned in the [[hadith|''hadith'']] (Prophetic narrations).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Male circumcision in the United States: The History, an analysis of the discourse, and a philosophical interpretation|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|date=June 2011|publisher=College of Liberal Arts &amp; Social Sciences Theses and Dissertations|page=29|quote=Unlike the Bible, there is not a lot of mention of circumcision in the Qur'an, but male circumcision is also deeply rooted in the Muslim tradition. Gollaher explains how “Muhammad is reported to have prescribed cutting the foreskin as a fitrah, a measure of personal cleanliness” (Gollaher, p. 45). Also, just as within the Jewish tradition, modern Muslims see this religious practice as not only morally but medically beneficial. A conference of Islamic scholars in 1987 stated that current pro-circumcision medical studies “[reflect] the wisdom of the Islamic statements” (Gollaher, p. 47).|df=|citeseerx = 10.1.1.854.2776}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|bukhari|7|72|777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{See also|Brit milah#The anti-circumcision movement and Brit shalom}}

During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries many [[Haskalah|Jewish reformers]], doctors, and [[physician]]s in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] proposed to replace circumcision with a symbolic ceremony, while others sought to ban or abolish circumcision entirely,&lt;ref name="Yivo"&gt;{{Cquote|In the first half of the nineteenth century, various European governments considered regulating, if not banning, ''berit milah'' on the grounds that it posed potential medical dangers. In the 1840s, radical Jewish reformers in [[Frankfurt]] asserted that circumcision should no longer be compulsory. This controversy reached [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in the 1880s. Russian Jewish physicians expressed concern over two central issues: the competence of those carrying out the procedure and the method used for ''metsitsah''. Many Jewish physicians supported the idea of procedural and hygienic reforms in the practice, and they debated the question of physician supervision during the ceremony. Most significantly, many advocated carrying out ''metsitsah'' by pipette, not by mouth. In 1889, a committee on circumcision convened by the Russian Society for the Protection of Health, which included leading Jewish figures, recommended educating the Jewish public about the concerns connected with circumcision, in particular, the possible transmission of diseases such as [[tuberculosis]] and [[syphilis]] through the custom of ''metsitsah'' by mouth.

Veniamin Portugalov, who—alone among Russian Jewish physicians—called for the abolition of circumcision, set off these discussions. Portugalov not only denied all medical claims regarding the sanitary advantages of circumcision but disparaged the practice as barbaric, likening it to pagan ritual mutilation. Ritual circumcision, he claimed, stood as a self-imposed obstacle to the Jews’ [[Jewish emancipation|attainment of true equality with the other peoples of Europe]].|author=Epstein, Lisa|source=[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Circumcision "Circumcision"], ''[[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]]'', [[Yale University Press]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it was perceived as a dangerous, barbaric and pagan ritual of [[genital mutilation]]&lt;ref name="Yivo" /&gt; that could [[Infectious disease#Transmission|transmit infectious diseases]] to newborns.&lt;ref name="Yivo" /&gt; The [[Religious male circumcision#Criticism and opposition to circumcision|first formal objection to circumcision within Judaism]] occurred in 1843 in [[Frankfurt]].&lt;ref name="Yivo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gollaher_2001_ch1"/&gt; The Society for the Friends of Reform, a group that criticized traditional Jewish practices, said that [[brit milah]] was not a [[mitzvah]] but an outworn legacy from [[Israelites|Israel]]'s earlier phases, an obsolete throwback to primitive religion.&lt;ref name="gollaher_2001_ch1"/&gt; With the expanding role of medicine came further opposition; certain aspects of Jewish circumcision such as ''periah'' and ''metzitzah'' (drawing the blood from the circumcision wound through sucking or a cloth) were deemed unhygienic and dangerous for the newborns.&lt;ref name="Yivo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gollaher_2001_ch1"/&gt; Later evidence that [[syphilis]] and [[tuberculosis]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; two of the most feared infectious diseases in the 19th century&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; were spread by mohels,&lt;ref name="Yivo" /&gt; caused various [[rabbis]] to advocate ''metzitzah'' to be done using a sponge or a tube.&lt;ref name="gollaher_2001_ch1"/&gt; Among the secular, non-observant Jews that chose to not circumcise their sons and keep them intact there was also [[Theodor Herzl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishcircumcision.org/spectator.htm|title=Circumcision: A Source of Jewish Pain|accessdate=2018-07-28|last=Goldman|first=Ronald|date=1997|website=Jewish Circumcision Resource Center|publisher=Jewish Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ephron reports that non-Jews and also some Jewish reformers in early 19th-century Germany had criticized ritual circumcision as "barbaric" and that Jewish doctors responded to these criticisms with defences of the ritual or proposals for modification or reform. By the late 19th century some German Jewish doctors defended circumcision by claiming it had health advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Medicine and the German Jews |author=John M.

===Middle Ages to the 19th century===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' questioned why, if under Jewish doctrine circumcision removed [[original sin]], [[Jesus]] was circumcised&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; as Jesus had no original sin. Steve Jones suggests there is a theological tradition that Jesus regained his foreskin at the Ascension. "Had he failed to do so, the Saved would themselves have to be operated upon in Paradise so as not to be more perfect than their Saviour."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Steve Jones |title=Y: the descent of men, Chapter 5 |year=2005 |publisher=Mariner Books |isbn=978-0-618-13930-9 |url=http://www.circumstitions.com/y.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jews were expelled from England by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in 1290, ostensibly over social tensions concerning [[usury]]. But the public imagination had been gripped by [[blood libel]] since at least the 12th century: "So pervasive was the belief that Jews circumcised their victims ... that Menasseh ben Israil, the Dutch Rabbi who sought from Cromwell the readmission of the Jews in 1656, had to dwell at considerable length in his ''Vindiciae Judaeorum'' at refuting the claim."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=James Shapiro |title= Shakespeare and the Jews |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BR4BxGfBqrIC&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=england%20expulsion%20jews%20circumcision&amp;pg=PR5#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-312-21689-4 |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1521, [[Hernán Cortés|Cortés]] defeated the [[Aztecs|Aztec empire]] in Mesoamerica, which was followed by a large influx of Spanish clergy, whose writings provide most of information about pre-conquest Aztec life and customs largely assembled from interviews with those who survived the invasion and subsequent epidemics, and their descendents. [[Diego Durán]], a Dominican friar, was convinced that the Aztecs were one of the [[lost tribes of Israel]], with a crucial piece of supporting evidence being that they had practised circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=193tKPdM-ykC&amp;pg=PR29&amp;lpg=PR29&amp;dq=%22diego+duran%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5sUnkVzJaC&amp;sig=O9N2_izOs4W0Hg39molb6-eyIUY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AzFHS6SiIsyHkQXxsdyDAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAcQ6AEwADgy#v=onepage&amp;q=%22diego%20duran%22&amp;f=false  ''The History of the Indies of New Spain''], Chapter 1 concerns the Jewish origins of the Aztecs, a very common idea at the time.

So influential was this notion that 300 years later [[Hubert Howe Bancroft|Bancroft]] in his monumental ''Native Races''&lt;ref name="Bancroft"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; began his discussion of circumcision by writing: "Whether the custom of circumcision, which has been the great prop of argument in favor of the Jewish origin of the Aztecs, really obtained among these people, has been doubted by numerous authors," concluding that it probably existed in a "certain form among some tribes" (p278). The key being "a certain form", since Bancroft makes clear in a footnote that the majority of his sources, including [[Clavigero]], Ternaux-Compans, Carbajal Espinosa, Oviedo y Herrera, and especially [[José de Acosta|Acosta]], believed Durán and others "confounded the custom of drawing blood from the secret organs with circumcision", and "the incision on the prepuce and ear to have been mistaken for circumcision", adding that this [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|blood-letting rite]]&lt;ref&gt;It is now thought this ubiquitous Mesoamerican ritual dates back to the Olmecs. See [http://www.mesoweb.com/pari/publications/RT08/Bloodletting.pdf Olmec Bloodletting: An Iconographic Study]&lt;/ref&gt; was "chiefly performed upon sons of great men" (p279). The case was not helped by the fact no reports of seeing a circumcised adult Aztec existed in the literature. Remondino says it is "a matter of controversy" whether the foreskin had actually been removed (p46).&lt;ref name= "Remondino1891"/&gt;

In regard to the Mayans, Bancroft says that in 1858 [[Brasseur de Bourbourg]] reported finding "traces"
&lt;ref&gt;In fact the term used is ''"restes déformés des rites antiques"'' or "deformed remnants of ancient rites" p35 [https://archive.org/stream/histoiredesnatio03bras/histoiredesnatio03bras_djvu.txt Histoire des nations civilisées du Mexique et de l'Amérique Centrale (1857-9)]&lt;/ref&gt; of circumcision in the sources, despite [[Diego López de Cogolludo|Cogolludo]] having reported that "circumcision was unknown to the Indians of Yucatan" (pp279, 679).&lt;ref name="Bancroft"/&gt; But in 1864 Brasseur published his French translation of [[Diego de Landa]]'s recently recovered 1556 ethnographic manuscript, which decisively rejected the notion of Mayan circumcision, and in a footnote he acknowledged there had probably been a "mistake", an admission that never found its way into the English-language literature&lt;ref&gt;

In 1650, English physician [[John Bulwer]] in his study of body modification, ''Anthropometamorphosis: Man Transform'd, or the Artificial Changeling'', wrote of the loss in sexual pleasure resulting from circumcision: "the part which hangeth over the end of the foreskin, is moved up and down in coition, that in this attrition it might gather more heat, and increase the pleasure of the other sexe; a contentation of which they [the circumcised] are defrauded by this injurious invention. For, the shortnesse of the prepuce is reckoned among the organical defects of the yard, … yet circumcision detracts somewhat from the delight of women, by lessening their titillation."  The English historian [[Edward Gibbon]], author of ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', referred to the practice as "a painful and often dangerous rite", and a "singular mutilation" practiced only by Jews and [[Turkish people|Turks]].

===Ethics===

{{Main|Ethics of circumcision|Forced circumcision}}

The ethical view of circumcision varies by country. In the United States, with a high circumcision rate, the [[American Medical Association]] stated in 2011 that they "'will oppose any attempts to intrude into legitimate medical practice and the informed choices of patients".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.thebody.com/content/64805/ama-opposes-legal-restrictions-on-infant-circumcis.html | title=AMA Opposes Legal Restrictions on Infant Circumcision}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such statements have drawn criticism from international doctors; a group of European doctors accused the 2012 [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] technical report of cultural bias.&lt;ref&gt;http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2013/03/12/peds.2012-2896.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the American Medical Association ''Journal of Ethics'' published two separate articles challenging the morality of performing non-therapeutic infant circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal | author=Svoboda JS | title=Nontherapeutic circumcision of minors as an ethically problematic form of iatrogenic injury | journal=American Medical Association Journal of Ethics | date=2017 | volume=19 | issue=8 | pages=815–24 | url=http://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/2017/08/msoc2-1708.html | doi= 10.1001/journalofethics.2017.19.8.msoc2-1708| pmid= | pmc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal | author=Reis-Dennis S, Reis E | title=Are physicians blameworthy for iatrogenic harm resulting from unnecessary genital surgeries? | journal=American Medical Association Journal of Ethics | date=2017 | volume=19 | issue=8 | pages=825–33 | url=http://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/2017/08/msoc3-1708.html | doi= 10.1001/journalofethics.2017.19.8.msoc3-1708| pmid= | pmc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Circumcision spread in several English-speaking nations from the late 19th century, with the introduction of anesthesia and antisepsis rapidly expanding surgical practice.&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{cite journal

Dr. [[John Harvey Kellogg]] recommended circumcision of boys caught masturbating, writing: "A remedy for masturbation which is almost always successful in small boys is circumcision, especially when there is any degree of [[phimosis]]. The operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering anaesthetic, as the pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind, especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment." But he was opposed to routine circumcision of infants: "It is doubtful, however, whether as much harm as good does not result from circumcision, since it has been shown by extensive observation among the Jews that very great contraction of the meatus, or external orifice of the urethra, is exceedingly common among them, being undoubtedly the result of the prolonged irritation and subsequent cicatricial contraction resulting from circumcision in infancy." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Harvey Kellogg |title=Plain Facts for Young and Old |publisher=F.

An early British opponent of circumcision was Herbert Snow, who wrote a short book called ''The barbarity of circumcision as a remedy for congenital abnormality'' in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=45#dow |title=The barbarity of circumcision, 1890.

E. Holt, an author of pediatric textbooks, advocated male and female circumcision as a treatment for masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Ritual of Circumcision |author=Paige KE |journal=Human Nature |pages=40–48 |date=May 1978 |url=http://www.noharmm.org/paige.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first serious questioning of the practice did not occur until late 1949 when [[Douglas Gairdner|Gairdner]] published ''The Fate of the Foreskin''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |

&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[British Medical Journal]]; according to Wallerstein this began to affect the practice of circumcision in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref name = "Wallerstein1985"/&gt;

According to Darby and Cox, the persistence of circumcision in the US has led to more vigorous protest movements.&lt;ref name="Fearfulsymmetries"/&gt; A 1980 protest march at the [[California State Capitol]] was reported in an [[Associated Press]] article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Protest Against Circumcision |author=Associated Press in San Francisco Examiner with UPI Photograph |newspaper=San Francisco Examiner |page=B4 |date=29 September 1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Organization of Circumcision Information Resource Centers ([[NOCIRC]]), was formed by [[Marilyn Milos]], R.N., in 1985.&lt;ref name="milos1992"/&gt;  The organization's stated objective is to secure the birthright of male, female, and intersex children and babies to keep their sex organs intact. Protest rallies have been held in the US and other areas. NOCIRC have consistently criticised the American medical community's circumcision guidelines.&lt;ref name="milos1992"/&gt; According to Milos and Donna Macris, "The need to defend the baby's right to a peaceful beginning was brought to light by Dr. Frederick Leboyer in his landmark work, ''Birth Without Violence''".&lt;ref name="milos1992"&gt;{{cite journal

This period also saw the formation of anti-circumcision organizations in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and South Africa. Activists began creating websites in the mid-1990s, and this process has continued. One such organization distributed questionnaires to circumcised men. The complaints included prominent [[Circumcision scar|scarring]] (33%), insufficient penile skin for comfortable erection (27%), erectile curvature from uneven skin loss (16%), and pain and bleeding upon erection/manipulation (17%).  Psychological complaints included feelings of mutilation (60%), low self-esteem/inferiority to "intact" men (50%), genital dysmorphia (55%), rage (52%), resentment/depression (59%), violation (46%), or parental betrayal (30%). Many respondents reported that their physical/emotional suffering impeded emotional intimacy with their partner(s), resulting in [[sexual dysfunction]].&lt;ref name="hammond1999"/&gt; Prominent men known to be unhappy about being circumcised include [[Sigmund Freud]],&lt;ref&gt;Michel Hervé Bertaux-Navoiseau, Freud and circumcision, chronicle of an unconscious trauma [https://www.academia.edu/2629456/Freud_and_circumcision_chronicle_of_an_unconscious_trauma_updated_03.26.2014_]&lt;/ref&gt; [[A E Housman]], [[W.H.

=== Medical controversies===

In the United States, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] (AAFP), and the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG), which collaborated to produce the 2012 statements issued by the AAP, position paper as of 2012 stated ""In cases such as the decision to perform a circumcision in the newborn period (where there is reasonable disagreement about the balance between medical benefits and harms, where there are nonmedical benefits and harms that can result from a decision on whether to perform the procedure, and where the procedure is not essential to the child’s immediate well-being), the parents should determine what is in the best interest of the child. In the pluralistic society of the United States, where parents are afforded wide authority for determining what constitutes appropriate child-rearing and child welfare, it is legitimate for the parents to take into account their own cultural, religious, and ethnic traditions, in addition to medical factors, when making this choice."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal | author=American Academy of Pediatrics Task Force on Circumcision | title=Circumcision policy statement | journal=Pediatrics | date=2012 | volume=130 | issue= | pages=585–586 | url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/3/585 | doi=10.1542/peds.2012-1989 | pmid= 22926180 | pmc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal | author=American Academy of Pediatrics | title=Male circumcision | journal=Pediatrics | date=2012 | volume=130 | issue=3 | pages=e756 | url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/3/e756 | doi=10.1542/peds.2012-1990 | pmid=22926175  | pmc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====HIV in southern and eastern Africa====
Starting in 2008 and following a framework established in 2007, the WHO and UNAIDS recommended voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) as a means of reducing the rate of HIV infection in eastern and southern Africa, and between 2008 and 2016 11 million adolescent boys and men in the region were circumcised, and the 2016 goal was to reach 90% of males aged 10–29-years by 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voluntary medical male circumcision: a core campaign to reach the Fast-Track Targets|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2016/october/20161017_VMMC|publisher=UNAIDS|date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A framework for voluntary medical male circumcision: effective HIV prevention and a gateway to improved adolescent boys' &amp; men's health in Eastern and Southern Africa by 2021|date=2016|location=World Health Organization|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/246234/1/WHO-HIV-2016.17-eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the UK [[National Health Service]] posted a commentary on a 2009 paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine about clinical trial outcomes of VMCC in African men and boys on sexually-transmitted [[herpes simplex virus]] type 2 and [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV).&lt;ref name=NHS2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tobian|first1=AA|last2=Serwadda|first2=D|last3=Quinn|first3=TC|last4=Kigozi|first4=G|last5=Gravitt|first5=PE|last6=Laeyendecker|first6=O|last7=Charvat|first7=B|last8=Ssempijja|first8=V|last9=Riedesel|first9=M|last10=Oliver|first10=AE|last11=Nowak|first11=RG|last12=Moulton|first12=LH|last13=Chen|first13=MZ|last14=Reynolds|first14=SJ|last15=Wawer|first15=MJ|last16=Gray|first16=RH|title=Male circumcision for the prevention of HSV-2 and HPV infections and syphilis.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=26 March 2009|volume=360|issue=13|pages=1298–309|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0802556|pmid=19321868|pmc=2676895}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NHS noted that the study was applicable to African, not UK, populations, that commentators in the US reacted more positively than those in the UK, and that UK commentators questioned some of the analysis.&lt;ref name=NHS2009/&gt;  The NHS also noted that [[condom]] use is the best way to prevent sexually-transmitted disease.&lt;ref name=NHS2009&gt;{{cite web|title=Circumcision and STIs|url=https://www.nhs.uk/news/lifestyle-and-exercise/circumcision-and-stis/|publisher=NHS|date=26 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews published in 2016 found the evidence from those trials to be solid, and found that additional high quality clinical trials had shown that VMMC also could reduce HPV transmission in that region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=B|last2=Khoury|first2=J|last3=Petersiel|first3=N|last4=Yahalomi|first4=T|last5=Paul|first5=M|last6=Neuberger|first6=A|title=Pros and cons of circumcision: an evidence-based overview.|journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection|date=September 2016|volume=22|issue=9|pages=768–774|doi=10.1016/j.cmi.2016.07.030|pmid=27497811}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaufman|first1=MR|last2=Smelyanskaya|first2=M|last3=Van Lith|first3=LM|last4=Mallalieu|first4=EC|last5=Waxman|first5=A|last6=Hatzhold|first6=K|last7=Marcell|first7=AV|last8=Kasedde|first8=S|last9=Lija|first9=G|last10=Hasen|first10=N|last11=Ncube|first11=G|last12=Samuelson|first12=JL|last13=Bonnecwe|first13=C|last14=Seifert-Ahanda|first14=K|last15=Njeuhmeli|first15=E|last16=Tobian|first16=AA|title=Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health Services and Implications for the Provision of Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision: Results of a Systematic Literature Review.|journal=PLoS One|date=2016|volume=11|issue=3|pages=e0149892|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0149892|pmid=26938639|pmc=4777442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammond (1999) asserts that every person has a right to a whole and intact body and that, where minors are concerned, "the unnecessary removal of a functioning body organ in the name of tradition, custom or any other non-disease related cause should never be acceptable to the health profession." He says that such interventions are violations of individual bodily rights and "a breach of fundamental medical ethics principles".&lt;ref name="hammond1999"&gt;{{vcite journal

Current laws in many countries, and United States Federal Law as well as laws in several U.S. states, prohibit the genital modification and mutilation of female minors, with some exceptions based on medical need. Opponents of male circumcision assert that laws against genital modification and mutilation of minors should apply equally to males and females.

However, linking [[male circumcision]] to [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM) is itself highly controversial. Organizations actually involved in combating FGM have been at considerable pains to distinguish the two, as this [[UNICEF]] document explains: "When the practice first came to be known beyond the societies in which it was traditionally carried out, it was generally referred to as 'female circumcision'. This term, however, draws a direct parallel with male circumcision and, as a result, creates confusion between these two distinct practices."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/fgm_eng.pdf Changing a harmful social convention, UNICEF]&lt;/ref&gt; This stance has been largely echoed by Western medical and political authorities.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} A [[Royal Dutch Medical Association]] viewpoint says that the form of female genital mutilation that resembles non-therapeutic circumcision the most is rejected unanimously throughout literature. The viewpoint also says "FGM takes many forms. There is the most severe form, infibulation, in which the inner and outer labia are stitched together and the clitoris is removed. However, there are also much milder forms of FGM, in which only the foreskin of the clitoris is removed."&lt;ref name="The KNMG Viewpoint of Non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kruseman|first1=Arie Nieuwenhuijzen|title=Prof. Dr. Chairman of KNMG|url=http://www.knmg.nl/Publicaties/KNMGpublicatie/77942/Nontherapeutic-circumcision-of-male-minors-2010.htm|website=knmg|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the United States, the organization MGMbill.org has been sending a proposed bill to the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] and 15 state legislatures every year since 2004 in order to extend the prohibition on [[genital modification and mutilation]] of minors to include [[male]] and [[intersex]] children.&lt;ref name="usmgmbill" /&gt; Although Rep.

According to the Nordic Association of Clinical Sexology (2013), "the decision to alter the appearance, sensitivity, and functionality of the penis should be left to its owner, thus upholding his fundamental rights to protection and bodily integrity. Every person's right to bodily integrity goes hand in hand with his or her [[Outline of sexual ethics|sexual autonomy]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web | author= | home=Nordic Association of Clinical Sexology | title= Statement on non-therapeutic circumcision of boys | url= http://nacs.eu/data/press_release001.pdf | date=10 October 2013 | accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other contemporary controversies===
====Controversy in India====
While circumcision debates are often dominated by the concerns of Anglophone countries, very different controversies over the procedure regularly erupt in other cultural contexts. In South Asia, [[Pakistan]] has long used circumcision status as a definitive marker of Indian covert involvement in its internal affairs. But this assumption was thrown into confusion when it was discovered that large segments of its own [[Muslim]] male population, specifically from western tribal areas, were themselves uncircumcised.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news | author=Omer Farooq Khan | title=Circumcision no longer acid test to identify Indian spies | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World/Pakistan/Circumcision-no-longer-acid-test-to-identify-Indian-spies/articleshow/4387116.cms  | work=The Times of India | date=11 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy in Israel====
Opposition to circumcision &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKRFiC5grxw |title=Explanation of opposing circumcision in Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; exists among [[Jews]] in [[Israel]]. Protests for children's rights have occurred there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Comedy Central|title=The Anti-Circumcision Movement in Israel - The Jim Jefferies Show|date=2018-08-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQkKJBKGAwA&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though there is often pressure from family on parents to circumcise their sons, "more and more families" are preferring to abstain from circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cirp.org/news/jerusalempost11-21-02/ |title=A cut above the rest |accessdate=2008-09-26 |last=Krieger |first= Hilary|date= 21 November 2002 | website= |publisher= Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====Controversy in South Africa====
In the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] areas of [[South Africa]], the large death toll from traditional circumcision provide a constant source of friction between traditional leaders, who oppose medicalised procedures, and health authorities. In 2009 in [[Eastern Cape Province]] alone, 80 boys died and hundreds were hospitalized after attending initiation schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=368362 Summer circumcision season deaths reach 23]&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy looks set to spread to the [[Zulu people|Zulu]], whose present-day [[king Goodwill Zwelithini]] has called for the reintroduction of customary circumcision after it was banned by Zulu king [[Shaka]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news | author=Alex Duval Smith | title=Thousands face agony or death after Zulu king's circumcision decree | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/17/circumcision-zulu-south-africa-hiv | work=The Guardian | date=16 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar issues, though on a smaller scale, have arisen with traditional circumcision of [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigines]] in remote areas of central [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news | author=Statham L | title=Ceremonial circumcisions botched in NT | url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/ceremonial-circumcisions-botched-in-nt-20100111-m2kf.html | work=Sydney Morning Herald | date=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy in Germany====
On June 26, 2012, a court in [[Cologne, Germany]] ruled that circumcision was "inflicting bodily harm on boys too young to consent", deciding that the practice contravenes the "interests of the child to decide later in life on his religious beliefs".&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{vcite news | author= | title=German court rules circumcision is 'bodily harm' | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18604664 | work=BBC News | date=26 June 2012 | accessdate= 16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision based on the article "Criminal Relevance of Circumcising Boys.

On 12 December 2012, following a series of hearings and consultations, the [[Bundestag]] adopted a law explicitly permitting non-therapeutic circumcision to be performed under certain conditions by a vote of 434-100, with 46 abstentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Beschneidung von Jungen jetzt gesetzlich geregelt |url=http://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2012/42042381_kw50_de_beschneidung/index.html |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, on the encouragement of sexologist [[Betty Dodson]], the San Francisco-based sex shop chain [[Good Vibrations (sex shop)|Good Vibrations]] pledged financial support to Clitoraid including asking customers to make donations; the company rescinded the offer after protests that the effort was misplaced, especially from [[Wanjiru Kamau-Rutenberg]], a professor of politics at the [[University of San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=Appeal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Millner |first=Caille |url=http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Wrong-approach-to-ending-genital-mutilation-3267623.php |title=Wrong approach to ending genital mutilation |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=14 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Clitoraid designated the week of 6–12 May as "International Clitoris Awareness Week".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/02/international-clitoris-we_n_3202780.html|title='International Clitoris Awareness Week' Takes Place May 6-12 (NSFW)|last=Moye|first=David|date=5 February 2013|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, in response to a dispute over the circumcision of a 4-year-old boy in the US, Clitoraid issued a press release supporting the mother who did not want the circumcision.  They also called on the [[United Nations]] to ban the practice: "Bodily harm is against the [[fundamental rights]] of all children, and we can’t understand when a so-called civilized country such as the United States would allow its male babies to be so readily mutilated legally!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press release: "Clitoraid supports Florida mother who faces prison for refusing to have her little boy Genitally Mutilated.

In [[agriculture]] and [[gardening]], a '''cloche''' (from French, ''cloche'' for "bell") is a covering for protecting plants from cold temperatures. The original form of a cloche is a bell-shaped glass cover that is placed over an individual plant; modern cloches are usually made from [[plastic]]. The use of cloches is traced back to [[market garden]]s in 19th century [[France]], where entire fields of plants would be protected with cloches. In commercial growing, cloches have largely been replaced by [[row cover]], and nowadays are mainly found in smaller gardens.&lt;ref name="cloches"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.garden.org/subchannels/edibles/veggies?q=show&amp;id=546 | title=All About Cloches | publisher=National Gardening Association | accessdate=19 March 2015 | author=Reich, Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyclospasm  may also exert tensions on the [[trabecular meshwork]], opening the pores and facilitating outflow of the [[aqueous humour]] into the [[Schlemm's canal|canal of Schlemm]]. The increase in aqueous humour outflow is desirable for patients with [[glaucoma]].

== Symptoms ==
Symptoms are the same as in the case of [[Myopia]]. Some of the most common symptoms are: tiredness of the eyes while looking at close objects, eye ache, headache.

== Reasons == 
Primary reasons is eye fatigue as a result of excessive pressure on the eyes because of reading, watching TV, computer, poor lighting, etc. Some other reasons are poor posture, poor diet, lack of sleep, etc.

== Treatment ==
There are different ways to treat cyclospasm. Some doctors recommend special eye drops and taking care of your hygiene. Eye exercises and healthy diet is also vital for good eyesight. There are no surgical treatment.

If cyclospasm is not treated at its early stages, it may lead to myopia.

'''Damodar Kund''' '''({{lang-gu|દામોદર કુંડ}})''' is one of the sacred lakes as per [[Hindu]] beliefs, which is located at the foothills of [[Girnar]] hills, near [[Junagadh]] in [[Gujarat]], India.

It is considered holy, as per Hindu mythology and many Hindus prefer to bathe and immerse the ashes and the bones left after [[cremation]] of dead bodies, here at Damodar Kund due to a belief that the departed souls would get [[moksha]] here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Folklore Notes - 2 Vols.

The water of the lake has properties of dissolving the bones.&lt;ref name=g/&gt; The lake is 257&amp;nbsp;ft long and 50&amp;nbsp;ft broad and only 5 feet deep. It is surrounded by a well built ghat.&lt;ref name=g/&gt; The steps for going up the Girnar hills start near Damodar Kund.

At the foothills of [[Ashwatthama]] Hill in Girnar mountain range base, southerly to Damodara Kund is the Damodar Hari Temple. The idols here are supposed to have been installed by Vajranabha, the grandson of Lord Shri Krishna, the one who also is credited with [[Dwarkadhish Temple]] and many other. Historically, these temples are supposed to have been built or renovated by a Suryavanshi ruler named Chandraketpur, who is also accredited to have built the temples of Shiva at [[Bhavnath]], a testament to his tolerance for all belief systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gir Forest and the Saga of the Asiatic Lion By Sudipta Mitra|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0rME6RjC1sC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=damodar+kund+girnar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rf0mUc7XD4jIrQfGpoCoAQ&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=chandraketpur&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The place underwent renovation during the regime of King Skand Gupta of Gupta dynasty in the year 462 AD. Lord Damodar here is considered by vaishnavaits as Adhipati of Girnar Kshetra. 

Covering an area of 32 acres, the temple is constructed using pink sand stone and consists of an inner Nij Mandir and an outer Solaha Mandapa, each topped with a Shikar, supported by an array of around 84 exquisitely carved pillars. Nij mandir's shikhar is 65 feet tall and the sabhha Mandap's shikhar is 30 feet tall. The statue of [[Krishna|Damodar]]ji is found in the form of Chaturbhuj, each arm holding a conch, discus, mace and lotus, along with Sri [[Radha]] Rani. Both the idols are sculpted from black stone and are heavily decorated with gold and silk. There are other sub shrines dedicated to Lord [[Balarama]], Sri [[Revati]] and Lord [[Ganesha]]. There are several other ancient temples nearby with on and outside temple complex.

Devotees are seen taking a holy dip in the sacred bathing tank, Damodar Kund, before offering prayers at the temple. 

The sewa of Shri Damodarji is being performed here in the Samprant-Yug by Vaishnav tradition. Shri Damodarji is the Ishtdev of the Giri Narayan Brahmin community and several other local communities. As per the traditional belief, Giri Narayan community is living here since around 12000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shreeradhadamodarji.org&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Damodar Kund is closely attached to the life of [[Narsinh Mehta]], the famous 15th century [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] poet and devotee of [[Krishna]], who used to come to bathe at Damodar Kund and is said to have written many of his ''prabhatiyas'' (morning prayers), in the natural surrounding here at the Damodar lake, at picturesque foothills of Girnar.&lt;ref name=f/&gt;  At present, there is also a temple of [[Narsinh Mehta]], which is built near temple of Damodar, to commemorate the association of this great saint-poet with Damodar Kund and ancient temple of Damodar here. This temple was built in decade of 1890 during reign of [[Nawab of Junagarh|Nawab Sir Muhammad Bahadur Khan III]] at behest of his [[Diwan (title)|Diwan]] [[Haridas Viharidas Desai]], who used to public money by organizing [[lottery]] to build the temple and foot steps leading up the mount Girnar.&lt;ref name=c&gt;Census of India, 1961: Gujarat published by India. Office of the Registrar General, 1965, pp 818.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narsinh Mehta in one of his verses mentions this fact as quoting self as under :- 
{{quote|([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]:|‘ગિરિ તળેટી ને કુંડ દામોદર ત્યાં મહેતાજી ના’વા જાય.’)}}

{{quote|..at the foot hills of Girnar, there is Kund (lake) Damodar, where [[Narsinh Mehta|Mehtaji]] goes for bathe...}}

Close to Damodara Kund, on the westerly to the Damodarji temple is '''Revati Kund'''. The kund is 52 ft long, 52 feet broad and 37 feet deep. Because of the depth dip here is not safe for all. [[Revati]], who was the daughter of King Raiwat, took form from the fires of pruthesthi yagna. It is said that Raivata Kakudmin or simply [[Kakudmi]] left Dwarka and moved to Girnar Hill after Revati was married to Lord Balarama. Hence, mount Girnar was also known as Raivatachal, Raivatgiri, Revatak Parvat or simply Raivata. And Junagadh was also referred to similarly. '''Baithakji of MahaPrabhuji''' is located close to Revati Kund. The founder of Pushti Sampradaya Shrimad Vallabhacharayaji (MahaPrabhuji) once visited Damodar pilgrim, where he remitted the shrimad Bhagwat. This is 64th seat of Shri Mahaprabhuji. Close to Revati kund is another mythological place, '''cave of [[Muchukunda]]'''. The cave has a temple of Lord Krishna, and a Shiv Linga established either by Lord Krishna himself or by Muchkundh. This is the place where [[Kalayavan]], the great Yavana or Greek warrior king, who was chasing Lord [[Krishna]] was killed by Muchukunda's gaze in the Indian epic Mahābhārata.

There is another holy lake, [[Mrigi Kund]] located nearby in [[Bhavnath]] temple premises. Hindus prefer to bathe in all these lakes to get rid of their sins.&lt;ref name=f&gt;Fairs and Festivals of India: Chhattisgarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Goa, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra by Madan Prasad Bezbaruah, Dr. Krishna Gopal, Phal S. Girota - 2003 - Page 157&lt;/ref&gt; 

Damodar Kund is one of the [[List of State Protected Monuments in Gujarat|monuments protected by the state government of Gujarat]]. It is a temporary [[Check dam|check-dam]] reservoir, which are being made and shifted regularly, in order to maintain water levels throughout the year at Damodar Kund. There are changing rooms, public toilet and other basic amenities provided by government, who have built permanent structure at Damodar Kund for facility of pilgrims.

'''Earlham Institute''' (EI, formerly '''The Genome Analysis Centre''' (TGAC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earlham Institute – Decoding living systems for a better world|url=http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/news/people-skills-training/2016/160627-n-earlham-institute-decoding-living-systems/|website=www.bbsrc.ac.uk|publisher=BBSRC|accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a life science research institute located at the [[Norwich Research Park]] (NRP), [[Norwich]], [[England]]. EI's research is focused on exploring living systems by applying computational science and biotechnology to answer ambitious biological questions and generate enabling resources.

== History ==

The institute was established by the [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]] in partnership with [[East of England Development Agency]] (EEDA), [[Norfolk County Council]], [[Norwich City Council]], [[South Norfolk|South Norfolk Council]] and the Greater Norwich Development Partnership. It cost £13.5 million, and was built by [[Morgan Sindall]]. It was officially opened on 3 July 2009&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; by [[John Sulston]], winner of the 2002 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], and former Director of the [[Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute]], another genomics research institution.

In early June 2011, it unveiled a supercomputer on its site that has the most powerful processor in the world that runs [[Red Hat Linux]], with six terabytes of [[Random-access memory|RAM]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} It was installed to crack the structure of the [[wheat]] genome, which is five times larger than the human genome.

In June 2016, Earlham Institute completed a rebranding project which saw the name transition from The Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC) to Earlham Institute (EI).

== Structure ==

It is situated on the [[Norwich Research Park]], to the west of Norwich on the former A47 ([https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1995444 B1108]), and adjacent to the west of the [[University of East Anglia]], next to the [[River Yare]].

== Function ==

The goal of this institute is to be at the forefront of data intensive science in biology, to be a leader in bioinformatics innovation and the application of genome technology and to enable bioscience through dissemination of the data and technology produced in the institute and in collaboration with external scientists worldwide. Project specialisms include wheat and [[ryegrass]], but the wider research carried out includes vertebrate, evolutionary, environment, and regulatory genomics as well as data infrastructure and software development to support the international bioscience community. EI makes its research [[open access]] where possible.

==Directors==
Earlham Institute has been directed by:
* Prof Jane Rogers from July 2009 to December 2012; 
* Prof Mario Caccamo from January 2013 to July 2015;
* Prof Dylan Edwards from August 2015 (Interim Director)
* Prof Neil Hall from April 2016 (Current Director)

== Communicating Science ==

One of the responsibilities of EI is to communicate the science it undertakes to a range of audiences, such as the international scientific community, the general public, school children, and students. It runs various programmes throughout the year to deliver this responsibility, as well as producing editorial features to explain the research it carries out.

== Facilities==

EI has a state-of-the-art scientific training facility which helps support the delivery of workshops and training courses to support the international bioscience community.

===Sequencing Platforms===
EI is equipped with next-generation sequencing and genomics platforms for high-throughput data generation for research projects.

An '''emergent virus''' is a virus that has adapted and emerged as a new disease/pathogenic strain, with attributes facilitating pathogenicity in a field not normally associated with that virus. This includes viruses that are the cause of a [[disease]] which has notably increased in incidence; this is often a result of a wide variety of causes from both the influence of [[Human|man]] and [[nature]]. Most emergent viruses can be categorized as [[zoonotic]] (an animal disease that can be transmitted to humans), this has the advantage of possibly having several natural reservoirs for the [[disease]].

==Overview==
The most important factor in the development of an emergent disease, to [[humans]], is the ability to pass from animal host to humans. There is little to no occurrence of spontaneous new virus species development, although the possible exception commonly cited is [[Ebola virus]]. Most often the virus, due to selection pressure for an animal version of the strain of disease to [[mutate]] and therefore adapt to the infection of human hosts.

==Emergent virus infection factors==
* Population movements
* Deforestation
* Irrigation
* Urbanization
* Increased long distance air travel
* Increased long distance air travel for livestock
* Migration

==Examples of emergent diseases==
===Poliomyelitis===
Known to have existed for centuries with little [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]]. During the 19th century [[poliovirus]] became more prominent in populations across the world. Dense urban populations allowed the disease to propagate via close [[human]] to human contact. In addition to this, technological advances meant that traveling became more common throughout the population essentially leading to increased transmission of the [[virus]]. The situation became worse year upon year with increasing incidence of the [[disease]] worldwide. The issue was not resolved until the introduction of a poliovirus [[vaccine]] brought the situation under control. This example demonstrates how a disease can emerge in a population as a result of human influence. This examples also illustrates how an emergent virus can emerge and disappear by tackling the root cause. Poliovirus has been targeted for [[poliomyelitis eradication|eradication]] by the [[WHO]].

New emergent viruses are continually being discovered. Examples include: [[SARS]], [[Avian influenza]], [[H5N1]], and [[Ebola]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6288">'''Enamel microabrasion''' is a procedure in [[cosmetic dentistry]] used to improve the appearance of the teeth. Like [[tooth whitening]] it is used to remove [[tooth discoloration|discolorations of the tooth surface]] but microabrasion is a mechanical, rather than chemical, procedure.

== History ==
In the past, teeth with stains or other color changes were made to look better through the use of restorative materials, such as [[dental porcelain]].  These materials would create a thin [[veneer (dentistry)|veneer]] over the outer surface of the tooth. Although veneers looked better, these materials did not match the structure or characteristics of the [[tooth enamel]] and replacement was frequently needed.  As far back as 1916, some researchers were advocating instead removing a thin layer of the outermost enamel to expose the (presumably) undamaged layer underneath.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCloskey RJ|first=|date=1984|title=A technique for removal of fluorosis stains.|url=|journal=J Am Dent Assoc|volume=109:63-64.|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first practical application of enamel microabrasion was developed by Theodore Croll and Richard Cavanaugh in 1986, who used a combination of weak [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[pumice]] to remove a few tenths of millimeters of the enamel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Croll|first1=TP|last2=Cavanaugh|first2=RR|title=Enamel color modification by controlled hydrochloric acid-pumice abrasion. I. technique and examples|journal=Quintessence Int.|date=Feb 1986| volume=17|issue=2|pages=81–7|pmid=3457401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Croll|first1=TP|last2=Cavanaugh|first2=RR|title=Enamel color modification by controlled hydrochloric acid-pumice abrasion. II. Further examples.|journal=Quintessence Int.|date=Mar 1986|volume=17|issue=3|pages=157–64|pmid=3458266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Contemporary enamel microabrasion uses a combination of mechanical and chemical means to remove of a small amount of tooth enamel (not more than a few tenths of a millimeter) to eliminate superficial discoloration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PRĒMA Enamel Microabrasion Compound|url=http://www.premusa.com/product/cosmetic-whitening/prema/|website=Premier Dental|publisher=Premier Dental|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These discolorations [[Tooth discoloration#Cause|can result from]] either from extrinsic factors (such as tobacco, dental plaque, certain foods, etc.) or intrinsic ones (most commonly [[dental fluorosis]]).

== Indications ==
* Dental fluorosis is the most common indication where it ranges in severity from mild to severe, microabrasion should be considered the first option in treating mild and moderate cases of fluorosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Celik EU, Yildiz G, Yazkan B.|first=|date=2013|title=clinical evaluation of enamel microabrasion for the aesthetic management of mild-to-severe dental fluorosis.|pmid=24320061|journal=J Esthet Restor Dent|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Removal of intrinsic enamel stains, correction of surface irregularities and defects in enamel caused either after removal of orthodontic appliances or during tooth formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Killian CM, Croll TP|first=|date=1990|title=Enamel microabrasion to improve enamel surface texture|url=|journal=J Esthet Dent|volume=2:125-128.|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Croll TP|first=|date=1990|title=Enamel microabrasion for removal of superficial dysmineralization and decalcification defects|url=|journal=J Am Dent Assoc|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contraindications ==
* The patients' age is not a limiting factor for the enamel microabrasion technique but in cases of not fully erupted teeth, it may be difficult to place [[Rubber dams|rubber dam]] for the microabrasion process&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sundfeld RH1, Rahal V, de Alexandre RS, Briso AL, Sundfeld Neto D.|first=|date=2011|title=Smile restoration through use of enamel microabrasion associated with tooth bleaching|pmid=23738859|journal=Compend Contin Educ Dent|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Microabrasion is not indicated when discoloration is located in dentin such as in [[dentigenous imperfecta]] or [[Tetracycline antibiotics|tetracycline discoloration.]]
* Should be delayed or not used in patients with deficient labial seal because enamel surfaces are extremely dry which makes stains more obvious.so, ''Sundfeld, et al'' in 2007, found that orthodontic lip repositioning should be done first to make removal of these stains more effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sundfeld RH, Croll TP, Briso AL, Alexandre RS, Sundfeld D.|first=|date=2007|title=Considerations about enamel microabrasion after 18 years|pmid=17542197|journal=Am J Dent|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==
Patients can benefit from combined microabrasion/ bleaching techniques as microabrasion causes reduction in the enamel surface and sometimes the tooth surface appear yellowish or darker due to exposure of dentin surface and thinning of enamel layer over it.In this condition, correction of this yellow color can be achieved by using tooth whitening technique to mask the color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sundfeld RH1, Rahal V, de Alexandre RS, Briso AL, Sundfeld Neto D.|first=|date=2011|title=Smile restoration through use of enamel microabrasion associated with tooth bleaching|pmid=23738859|journal=Compend Contin Educ Dent|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fragoso, et al.'' (2011) found that applying [[Fluoride varnish|fluoride paste]] on enamel surface after microabrasion process provides higher hardness &amp; more enamel smoothness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fragoso LS, Lima DA, Alexandre RS, Bertoldo CE, Aguiar FH, Lovadino JR.|first=|date=2011|title=Evaluation of physical properties of enamel after microabrasion, polishing, and storage in artificial saliva.|pmid=21487176|journal=Biomed Mater.|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition, ''Segura et al'' found that  the treated enamel  surface become more resistant to [[Demineralization (physiology)|demineralisation]] than untreated enamel and less colonisation of bacteria occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Segura A, Donly KJ, Wefel JS, Drake D.|first=|date=1997|title=Effect of enamel microabrasion on bacterial colonization|pmid=9590914|journal=Am J Dent.|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the developed world, syphilis infections were in decline until the 1980s and 1990s due to widespread use of antibiotics. Since the year 2000, rates of syphilis have been increasing in the US, UK, Australia, and Europe primarily among [[men who have sex with men]].&lt;ref name=ST10/&gt; This is attributed to unsafe sexual practices.&lt;ref name=ST10/&gt; A STD Surveillance study done by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] in 2016 showed that men who have sex with men only account for over half (52%) of the 27,814 cases during that year. Nationally, the highest rates of primary and secondary syphilis in 2016 were observed among men aged 20–34 years, among men in the West, and among Black men. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats16/syphilis.htm|title=Syphilis - 2016 STD Surveillance Report|date=2017-10-17|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Increased rates among heterosexuals have occurred in China and Russia since the 1990s.&lt;ref name=ST10/&gt; Syphilis increases the risk of [[HIV]] transmission by two to five times and co-infection is common (30–60% in a number of urban centers).&lt;ref name=ST10/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kent08&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kent ME, Romanelli F | title = Reexamining syphilis: an update on epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and management | journal = The Annals of Pharmacotherapy | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 226–36 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18212261 | doi = 10.1345/aph.1K086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Untreated, it has a mortality rate of 8% to 58%, with a greater death rate in males.&lt;ref name=Kent08/&gt;{{why|date=November 2018}} The symptoms of syphilis have become less severe over the 19th and 20th&amp;nbsp;century in part due to widespread availability of effective treatment and partly due to [[optimal virulence|decreasing virulence]] of the spirochete.&lt;ref name=Sec2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mullooly C, Higgins SP | title = Secondary syphilis: the classical triad of skin rash, mucosal ulceration and lymphadenopathy | journal = International Journal of STD &amp; AIDS | volume = 21 | issue = 8 | pages = 537–45 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20975084 | doi = 10.1258/ijsa.2010.010243 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With early treatment few complications result.&lt;ref name=Pri2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eccleston K, Collins L, Higgins SP | title = Primary syphilis | journal = International Journal of STD &amp; AIDS | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 145–51 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18397550 | doi = 10.1258/ijsa.2007.007258 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
In China rates of syphilis have increased from the 1990s to the 2010s.&lt;ref name=China11&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tucker JD, Cohen MS | title = China's syphilis epidemic: epidemiology, proximate determinants of spread, and control responses | journal = Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 50–5 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21150594 | pmc = 3103765 | doi = 10.1097/QCO.0b013e32834204bf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred after a successful campaign to reduce rates was carried out in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=China11/&gt; Rates of diagnosis are higher in urban coastal areas.&lt;ref name=China11/&gt; This may be due to sexual practices or better diagnosis in these areas.&lt;ref name=China11/&gt;

Rates of syphilis in 2000–2005 among low-risk groups such as women without children and unmarried people were about 0.3–0.6% while rates among high-risk groups such as drug users and [[men who have sex with men|MSM]] were about 7–15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin CC, Gao X, Chen XS, Chen Q, Cohen MS | title = China's syphilis epidemic: a systematic review of seroprevalence studies | journal = Sexually Transmitted Diseases | volume = 33 | issue = 12 | pages = 726–36 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 16755273 | doi = 10.1097/01.olq.0000222703.12018.58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates are greatest among [[men who have sex with men]] and [[sex worker]]s.&lt;ref name=China11/&gt;

The increase has been attributed to a number of factors including: migration from rural communities to urban environments, increased numbers of unmarried men, limited screening for disease, partners not always getting notification, and the fact that high-risk groups frequently do not seek health care.&lt;ref name=China11/&gt;

Co-infection of HIV and syphilis is probably a major reason behind resurgence in syphilis prevalence among [[men who have sex with men]] in China. It is hypothesized that the association observed between syphilis and HIV among MSM is probably due to similar risks associated with both infections. Analysis of data from a survey among MSM in seven Chinese cities reveal that the factors significantly associated with co-infection are older age, education up to senior high school, unprotected anal intercourse, recent STD symptoms, and incorrect knowledge about routes of transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Das A, Li J, Zhong F, Ouyang L, Mahapatra T, Tang W, Fu G, Zhao J, Detels R | title = Factors associated with HIV and syphilis co-infection among men who have sex with men in seven Chinese cities | journal = International Journal of STD &amp; AIDS | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 145–55 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 24737881 | doi = 10.1177/0956462414531560 | url = http://std.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/04/15/0956462414531560.abstract | pmc = 4198509 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One reason for increasing syphilis infection rates in China is suboptimal testing uptake among key populations. [[SESH]], a research partnership dedicated to developing creative, equitable, and effective solutions to sexual health dilemmas, has looked extensively into ways to improve syphilis detection among MSM. Research suggests that testing can be optimized by offering rapid STD testing at MSM-focused centers, improving confidentiality, and ensuring test accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bien|first1=Cedric H|last2=et al|title=HIV and syphilis testing preferences among men who have sex with men in South China: a qualitative analysis to inform sexual health services|date=13 April 2015|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124161|access-date=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Europe==
In Europe rates of syphilis are higher in eastern and southern countries than in western ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uusküla A, Puur A, Toompere K, DeHovitz J | title = Trends in the epidemiology of bacterial sexually transmitted infections in eastern Europe, 1995-2005 | journal = Sexually Transmitted Infections | volume = 86 | issue = 1 | pages = 6–14 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20157177 | doi = 10.1136/sti.2009.037044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates overall in Europe are 6.0 per 100,000 population. Syphilis infection was eight times higher in men than women. The majority of cases were reported in people 25 and older, while younger people, aged 15 to 24 represented 13% of the cases. Almost two-thirds (62%) of the cases in which the sexual partner was accounted for were reported in men who have sex with men (MSM), echoing a phenomena in other parts of the world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/syphilis-annual-epidemiological-report-2015|title=Syphilis - Annual Epidemiological Report for 2015|website=European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; An annual epidemiological report from 2015 done by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control found that there is a high proportion of HIV co-infections. These co-infections tend to appear most in men who have sex with men, who are already the most affected group overall. 

Rates of infection vary throughout the European continent and the trends are different for men and women. The rate of syphilis infection in men has gone up dramatically since 2010. The rate for women in slowly decreasing in the same timeframe. Countries in Western Europe saws some of the sharpest increases. Countries like Belgium, Germany, France and many others saw increases of over 50%. The reported rates of syphilis in European countries vary overall. The lowest reported rate was from Croatia, where 1 per 100,000 people have been infected. The highest rate reported was Denmark with 13.7 per 100,000 people infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/syphilis-annual-epidemiological-report-2015|title=Syphilis - Annual Epidemiological Report for 2015|website=European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
Rates of congenital syphilis have decreased between the 1980 and 2000s due to better access to [[prenatal care]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dhawan J, Gupta S, Kumar B | title = Sexually transmitted diseases in children in India | journal = Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology | volume = 76 | issue = 5 | pages = 489–93 | date = Sep–Oct 2010 | pmid = 20826987 | doi = 10.4103/0378-6323.69056 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This study was conducted at a tertiary care center so the results may not reflect the true prevalence of syphilis in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sethi S, Mewara A, Hallur V, Prasad A, Sharma K, Raj A | title = Rising trends of syphilis in a tertiary care center in North India | journal = Indian Journal of Sexually Transmitted Diseases | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 140–3 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26692604 | pmc = 4660552 | doi = 10.4103/0253-7184.167137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
[[File:SyphilisUS2009.gif|thumb|350px|Syphilis—Reported Cases by Stage of Infection, United States, 1941–2009.]]
[[File:Trends-syphilis-780.gif|thumb|350px|Rates of syphilis by gender in the United States.]]
In the United States rates of syphilis have increased among men between 2000 and 2007.&lt;ref name=USA10&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Celum CL | title = Sexually transmitted infections and HIV: epidemiology and interventions | journal = Topics in HIV Medicine | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 138–42 | date = Oct–Nov 2010 | pmid = 21107013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates are six times greater in men than women and seven times greater in African Americans than Caucasians.&lt;ref name=USA10/&gt; More than 60% of cases are in [[men who have sex with men]].&lt;ref name=USA10/&gt; It occurs most commonly in those between 15–40 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats06/tables/table32.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, rates of syphilis as of 2007 were six times greater in men than women while they were nearly equal in 1997.&lt;ref name=CDC07&gt;{{cite web |title=Trends in Reportable Sexually Transmitted Diseases in the United States, 2007|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats07/trends.htm|work=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates are also greater in African Americans and Hispanics than in Caucasians.&lt;ref name=CDC07/&gt;

According to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2000-2016, the rising rates of primary and secondary syphilis were attributed to men, mostly who have sex with men, no matter how they identify. However, since 2013, according to the same report, rates among men and women have increased. These increases were in every region within the United States and across racial identities as well. The groups with the highest rates in 2016 were men aged 20-34, men from the western region of the United States, and black men. In 2016, there were 27,814 reported cases of syphilis, primary and secondary, in the United States, a 17.6% increase from the previous year and a 74% increase from the reported cases in 2012.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats16/syphilis.htm|title=Syphilis - 2016 STD Surveillance Report|date=2017-10-17|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Primary and secondary syphilis have a high correlation to an HIV-coinfection, particularly in [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM). In 2016, in cases with a known HIV-status, 47% of men who had sex with men were HIV-positive along with their syphilis infections. The rates among men who have sex with women (MSW) and women were much lower at 10.7% (MSW) and 41.% (women).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Reemergence==
[[China]] had a great deal of syphilis during the first part of the 20th century and basically eliminated it from 1960-1980.&lt;ref name="Chen 2007 dicks132–138"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chen|first=Zhang|title=Syphilis in China: Results of a national surveillance programme|journal=The Lancet|year=2007|volume=369|pages=132–138|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673607600749|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60074-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s China was believed to have one of the worst cases of syphilis in human history. Different surveillance programs determined that 84% of Chinese prostitutes had the infection and as many as 5% of citizens had the disease in large cities.&lt;ref name="Chen 2007 dicks132–138"/&gt;

The communist government under [[Mao Zedong]], in response to the syphilis epidemic, issued free treatment for all those infected and increased screening for the disease.&lt;ref name="Chen 2007 dicks132–138"/&gt; In the 1960s it was found that syphilis was almost completely eradicated in China.

Recent studies show evidence that the disease has seen a resurgence. In a study entitled "Syphilis in China: Results of a National Surveillance Program", researchers found that during 1993 the number of cases of reported syphilis was 0-2 per 100,000. During a national surveillance program in 2005 there were found to be 5-7 cases per 100,000 throughout the country.&lt;ref name="Chen 2007 dicks132–138"/&gt; In that same study it showed that the city with the most prevalence of syphilis was [[Shanghai]], with an estimated 55 patients with syphilis per 100,000 citizens. The second highest was [[Zhejiang]], which had approximately 35 people with syphilis per 100,000; the third was [[Fujian]], which had 28 patients per 100,000.&lt;ref name="Chen 2007 dicks132–138"/&gt;

All of these cities are on the southeastern edge of the country, facing the ocean. The greatest increase in syphilis is in female [[sex worker]]s, drug users, and gay men.&lt;ref name="Chen 2007 dicks132–138"/&gt; According to an article published in [[The Lancet]] titled "Syphilis Resurgent in China", the main cause of syphilis being more prevalent in China is due to the recent economic growth of China and increased globalization, which has caused an increase of the sex trade, internal and external migration, and a bigger economic inequality among its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fisman|first=D.|title=Syphilis Resurgent in China|journal=The Lancet|year=2007|volume=369|pages=84–85|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673607600440|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60044-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Something else that is credited is that China's earlier efforts to control the disease helped increase the susceptibility of citizens to the disease.{{vague|date=June 2018}}{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} China's increase in syphilis is not self-contained; [[Russia]], the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the United States have all seen a great increase in patients with syphilis recently.

Russia is one of the main areas around the world that has been affected by the syphilis epidemic. An article titled "Epidemics of syphilis in the Russian Federation: trends, origins, and priorities for control", published in ''[[The Lancet]]'', discussed syphilis trends in Russia. Like China, Russia basically eliminated the disease during the 1960s, though there was a slight increase during 1978 and 1979 with an estimated 28 cases per 100,000. The rate dropped slightly only to rise between 1988, where there were four patients per 100,000 citizens, to 263 patients per 100,000 in 1996, which is 62 times more than it had been.&lt;ref name="Tichonova 1997 210–213"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tichonova L, Borisenko K, Ward H, Meheus A, Gromyko A, Renton A | title = Epidemics of syphilis in the Russian Federation: trends, origins, and priorities for control | journal = Lancet | volume = 350 | issue = 9072 | pages = 210–3 | date = July 1997 | pmid = 9250199 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(97)01382-2 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673697013822 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most commonly affected individuals are found to be young men and women. It is also reported that the estimated number of patients in Russia with syphilis who do not report their disease rose from around 0% in 1989 to 30% in 1993.&lt;ref name="Tichonova 1997 210–213"/&gt;

Many of the reasons for this increase in syphilis within Russia stem from [[political restructuring]] and a declining economy, causing many people's standard of living to decline. The [[gross national income]] of the country dropped about 12% between 1990 and 1994.&lt;ref name="Tichonova 1997 210–213"/&gt; The government funding of health services and social institutions went down and in turn caused fewer people to receive treatment for syphilis. This broad decline in the economy within Russia also led to an increase in the crossing of the country's borders, causing a mixing of surrounding area and more migration within and outside of Russia.&lt;ref name="Tichonova 1997 210–213"/&gt;

In [[Moscow]] especially, a lot of travel has been done between other large cities. This increase in travel is similar to China's recent{{when|date=November 2018}} increase in travel. Both have increased the number of sexual encounters with prostitutes and varied ideas of sexual ideology.

Russia's increased contact with the western world has brought more ideas on sexual orientation and an increase in pornography.&lt;ref name="Tichonova 1997 210–213"/&gt; Russia right now is focused on making an increase in prevention and treatment programs throughout the country, making sure that the lower class of people have access to medical services and many health promotions are being made.&lt;ref name="Tichonova 1997 210–213"/&gt;

The [[United Kingdom]] and other parts of Western Europe have also seen a major increase in syphilis in recent times. A study called "Are trends in HIV, gonorrhea, and syphilis worsening in western Europe?" in a journal of medicine called BMJ outlines the data collected from 1995 to 2000 on sexually transmitted diseases throughout western Europe. As with Russia and China there was a big decline in syphilis before 1980 but a big resurgence during the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Nicoll 2002 1324–1327"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nicoll A, Hamers FF | title = Are trends in HIV, gonorrhoea, and syphilis worsening in western Europe? | journal = BMJ | volume = 324 | issue = 7349 | pages = 1324–7 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12039830 | pmc = 1123279 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.324.7349.1324 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common form of how the disease was spread was from sex between two men, 37%, and the second highest was from sex between a man and a woman, 35%.

Another major way of spreading the disease is the sharing of needles between drug users.&lt;ref name="Nicoll 2002 1324–1327"/&gt; The Netherlands, Norway Ireland and France reported that most transmissions of syphilis were local and mainly between two men having sex.

England and Wales saw a slight drop and then increase of syphilis cases between 1995 and 2000 and a drastic increase in syphilis contraction through homosexual men in 2000.&lt;ref name="Nicoll 2002 1324–1327"/&gt; The increase in Western Europe can be attributed to the declining sexual morals of Western Europe with less safe sex practicing and young people are having more sex than they have had in the past. Due to a lack of modern [[surveillance programs]] and various governments in Europe there is not definitive data to show how prevalent the spread of syphilis is throughout every country in Western Europe.&lt;ref name="Nicoll 2002 1324–1327"/&gt;

The United States mirrored the global trend with a sharp increase in syphilis during the 1990s up till the present. The United States saw a big decrease in the number of cases in the 1950s, with only around 6500 cases were reported per year, which was statistically about what other countries were seeing at the time. This continued with a varying increase around the 1960s and 1970s with around 19,000 and 26,000 cases per year up until the beginning of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hook EW, Marra CM | title = Acquired syphilis in adults | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 326 | issue = 16 | pages = 1060–9 | date = April 1992 | pmid = 1549153 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199204163261606 | url = http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM199204163261606 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) published their findings in 2013 with 19,738,800 almost 15% of those were from syphilis. It has been found that men and women are equally as likely to have syphilis in the United States. It is thought that the number of new cases of syphilis along with the current amount is around 117,000 people have syphilis in the United States.&lt;ref name="Sexually Transmitted Diseases"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sexually Transmitted Diseases|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats/|publisher=Center for Disease Control}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat the increase in syphilis and other various sexually transmitted diseases, the United States focuses on prevention programs where the focus is on practicing safe sex and being aware of whether ones partner has syphilis. Pregnant women, which have a high risk of infecting their children, are required to take syphilis screening and given treatment if they are found to be carrying the disease.&lt;ref name="Sexually Transmitted Diseases"/&gt;

All of these countries have in common a theme of travel in between countries which increases how prevalent and far reaching the disease can reach. Not only is travel linked to the reemergence of syphilis but also the [[Internet]] has been a major factor in syphilis being transferred from person to person.
A study done in 2000 titled "Tracing a Syphilis Outbreak Through Cyberspace" published in [[The Journal of American Medical Association]] shows that Internet chat rooms increase the frequency of sexual contact between people, especially those of gay men.&lt;ref name="Klausner 2000 447–449"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klausner|first=J|title=Tracing a Syphilis Outbreak Through Cyberspace.|journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association|year=2000|volume=284|pages=447–449|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=192920|doi=10.1001/jama.284.4.447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a specific outbreak in [[San Francisco]] gay men with syphilis were found to be a lot more probable to have met their significant other through the Internet. The ratio was found to be that 67% of the men met their partner through an Internet chat room and only 19% of those with reported syphilis were not linked to the Internet.&lt;ref name="Klausner 2000 447–449"/&gt;

The Internet is a global force that facilitates sexual encounters among people which spreads the disease to many people who otherwise would not be in contact with syphilis.
This global re-emergence of syphilis is a major problem for every country affected. According to a study titled "Global Prevalence and Incidence Estimates of Selectable Curable STD's" in a journal named Sex Transm Inf the amount of syphilis cases reported within the 9 main UN territories in 1995 was roughly around 12 million cases.&lt;ref name="Gerbase 1998 12–16"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gerbase|first=A|title=Global prevalence and incidence estimates of selected curable stds.|journal=Sex Transm Infect|year=1998|volume=74|pages=12–16|url=http://cedoc.cies.edu.ni/general/2nd_Generation%20%28D%29/Methods%20for%20estimation/STI%201998%20paper.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main population that was reported to have the disease was the people who were lower in the economy and younger people are reported to have more of the disease than older people.

Out of the nine UN regions that were surveyed the region that syphilis was the most prevalent was south and south eastern Asia. The second highest was found to be in the sub Saharan parts of Africa and the third highest was [[Latin America]] and the Caribbean areas.&lt;ref name="Gerbase 1998 12–16"/&gt; This study in 1995 was one of the first big attempts by the World Health Organization to find a good estimate of the total population of people with syphilis and other STDs.

Studies by the World Health Organization pinpoint how prevalent syphilis is globally. An article called "Congenital syphilis re-emerging" in a medical journal titled JDDG outlines the World Health Organizations findings as recently as 2008. It is estimated that globally 12 million people acquire the disease every year and of these 12 million patients 2 million are pregnant women.&lt;ref name="Simms 2008 269–272"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Simms I, Broutet N | title = Congenital syphilis re-emerging | journal = Journal Der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft = Journal of the German Society of Dermatology | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 269–72 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18266865 | doi = 10.1111/j.1610-0387.2008.06490.x | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1610-0387.2008.06490.x/full }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This high amount of pregnant women with the disease estimates that it will cause about 50% of the pregnancies to result in [[stillbirth]] or prenatal death. The World Health Organization estimates that syphilis in within the mother can cause syphilis in the baby between 713,600 cases and 1,575,000 cases.&lt;ref name="Simms 2008 269–272"/&gt;

Because of the increased numbers of patients globally there have been many initiatives to prevent the spread of the disease and there has been a global effort to eradicate the disease. An article titled "A Road Map for the Global Elimination of Congenital Syphilis" within a medical journal called [[Obstetrics and Gynecology International]] outlines the global efforts to combat congenital syphilis mostly dealing with the World Health Organization. Many of the efforts are focused on screening women who are pregnant for the disease and treating them.&lt;ref name="Kamb 2010 1–6"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kamb|first=M|title=A Road Map for the Global Elimination of Congenital Syphilis.|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology International|year=2010|pages=1–6|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ogi/2010/312798/abs/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Of the two million pregnancies each year that test positive for syphilis they make up 1.5% of every pregnancy throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Kamb 2010 1–6"/&gt; During 2007 the World Health Organization estimated in 2007 that in the countries that are affected most by congenital syphilis it would cost roughly 3 to 4 million dollars to start a program that could potentially eliminate most of the threat of congenital syphilis by focusing a lot more on screening and treatment.&lt;ref name="Kamb 2010 1–6"/&gt;

Countries in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] find it difficult to implement these kinds of treatment due to a lack of health services for their citizens which in turn makes this area a big breeding ground for congenital syphilis and the spread of syphilis through sexual contact.
The World Health Organization outlines a four-pillar plan that could help countries eliminate or at least decrease the numbers of cases of congenital syphilis. The four pillars are "ensure advocacy and sustained political commitment for a successful health initiative, increase access to, and quality of, maternal and newborn health services, screen and treat pregnant women and partners, and establish surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation systems.".&lt;ref name="Kamb 2010 1–6"/&gt;
The [[United Nations]] has also added goals related to the lowering of syphilis which they call the Millennium Development Goals. These goals include reducing infant death from syphilis and increasing the health of mothers with syphilis.&lt;ref name="Simms 2008 269–272"/&gt; The United Nations have taken steps to include on site screening and testing for syphilis among other sexually transmitted diseases along with an increase in partner notification.

The '''Food Safety Modernization Act''' ('''FSMA''') was signed into law by President Barack Obama on January 4, 2011. The FSMA has given the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) new authorities to regulate the way foods are grown, harvested and processed. The law grants the FDA a number of new powers, including mandatory recall authority, which the agency has sought for many years. The FSMA requires the FDA to undertake more than a dozen rulemakings and issue at least 10 guidance documents, as well as a host of reports, plans, strategies, standards, notices, and other tasks.

The law was prompted after many reported incidents of [[foodborne illness]]es during the first decade of the 2000s and was largely crafted by members of the [[Grocery Manufacturers Association]]. Tainted food has cost the food industry billions of dollars in recalls, lost sales and legal expenses.

This bill is similar to the Food Safety Enhancement Act which passed the House in 2009. It is considered the first major piece of federal legislation addressing food safety since 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/30/AR2009073003271.html?hpid=topnews |title=House Approves Food-Safety Bill; Law Would Expand FDA's Power |work=The Washington Post |date= July 31, 2009|accessdate=January 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the first piece of legislation to address intentional adulteration and [[Food Defense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/FSMA/ucm378628.htm|title=FSMA Proposed Rule for Focused Mitigation Strategies to Protect Food Against Intentional Adulteration|work=FDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Bias-section|date=July 2018}}
The [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) estimated in 2011 that each year 48 million people (1 in 6 Americans) get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die of foodborne diseases.&lt;ref name="CDC Estimates of Foodborne Illness in the United States"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/foodborneburden/2011-foodborne-estimates.html |title=CDC Estimates of Foodborne Illness in the United States |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=December 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fda.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Background on the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FSMA/ucm239907.htm|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 31 pathogens are notorious for causing foodborne illness.&lt;ref name="CDC Estimates of Foodborne Illness in the United States"/&gt; Unspecified agents have insufficient data to estimate with certainty the agent-specific burden. Known agents that have not been identified as causing foodborne illness include microbes, chemicals, or other substance known to be in food. The ability for these known agents to cause illness has not been proven so they remain unidentified. 
Considering the fact that, about 30% of the population is at risk for food borne sicknesses, over 14% of food supply to the United States is imported from other countries, and also new and more food items are becoming more complex or intricate, the FSMA was indeed needed.
&lt;ref name="FDA Food Safety Modernization Act Overview"&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA Food Safety Modernization Act Overview|url=http://fda.yorkcast.com/webcast/Viewer/?peid=886494cb24a741299e6a4578f40624721d|accessdate=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), enables [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] to better protect public health by strengthening the food safety system. It enables the FDA to focus more on preventing food safety problems rather than relying primarily on reacting to problems after they occur.&lt;ref name="fda.gov"/&gt;

In 1998, the FDA announced a publication entitled "Guidance for Industry: Guide to Minimize Microbial Food Safety Hazards for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables" in response to President Clinton's 1997 "Initiative to Ensure the Safety of Imported and Domestic Fruits and Vegetables".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/produceplantproducts/ucm064574.htm Guidance for Industry: Guide to Minimize Microbial Food Safety Hazards for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables]", [[Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition]], October 26, 1998. {{FedReg|63|58055}} (October 29, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; They resulted in Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and Good Handling Practices (GHP) certifications that became ''de facto'' industry requirements, but were not enforceable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In Food We Trust: The Politics of Purity in American Food Regulation|pages=131–134|last=Thomas|first=Courtney I. P.|year=2014|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=9780803276420|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6rBaBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past few years, high-profile outbreaks related to various foods, from spinach and peanut products to eggs, have underscored the need to make continuous improvements in food safety.&lt;ref name="Food Bill Aims to Improve"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm237758.htm |title=Food Bill Aims to Improve |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=November 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under this law the FDA will be allowed to mandate a system that is based on science and addresses the hazards from farm to table. This means that the FDA has the power to oversee how foods are produced and how they are maintained in food markets. This puts greater emphasis on preventing food-borne illness. The reasoning is simple: The better the system handles producing, processing, transporting, and preparing foods, the safer our food supply will be.&lt;ref name="Food Bill Aims to Improve"/&gt;
 
Under the new law, the FDA will now have new prevention-focused tools and a clear regulatory framework to help make substantial improvements in their approach to food safety.&lt;ref name="fda.gov"/&gt; For example, for the first time, the FDA has a legislative mandate to require comprehensive, preventive-based controls across the food supply chain. Preventive controls include steps that a food facility would take to prevent or significantly minimize the likelihood of problems occurring. The new law also significantly enhances the FDA’s ability to achieve greater oversight of the millions of food products coming into the United States from other countries each year.

==Legislative history==

The events of Sep 11, 2001 reinforced the need to enhance the security of the United States. Congress responded by passing the [[Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness Response Act]], 'the Bioterrorism Act', which President Bush signed into law June 12, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/legislation/ucm148797.htm |title=Bioterrorism Act of 2002 |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Bioterrorism Act of 2002 granted the FDA administrative detention authority over food items if there is credible evidence or information that indicates the food presents a threat of serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.&lt;ref name="willimanticfood"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://willimanticfood.coop/wp-content/uploads/Food-Safety-Final-2.pdf |title= The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. What do the new laws mean for small farms and producers? |publisher=New England Farmers Union |accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new (FSMA) law broadens that authority, allowing for administrative detention based on ‘reason to believe’ that the food item has been misbranded or adulterated’ and thus violates a legal standard for the product.&lt;ref name="willimanticfood"/&gt;

[[File:Obama signs FSMA into Law.jpg|thumb|300px|right|President Obama signs FSMA into law.]]

The first version of the law, the [[Food Safety Enhancement Act]], passed the House on June 9, 2009. However, negotiations with the Senate led to the final product, the 'Food Safety and Modernization Act.' The bill was passed by the Senate in November 2010 by a vote of 73–25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00257 |title=Roll Call Votes 111th Congress - 2nd Session |publisher=United States Senate |accessdate=January 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of a tax provision added to the bill, (which is constitutionally required to begin in the House), the vote did not count. There was concern that with the short time left in the lame-duck session, the bill would not get the time needed to be voted on and passed.&lt;ref name="politico1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1210/46598.html |title=Senate OKs food safety measure – Meredith Shiner |publisher=Politico.Com |accessdate=January 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to add the bill to the continuing resolution for government funding were scrapped over the objection of Senator [[Tom Coburn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Falkenstein |first=Drew |url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2010/12/in-lame-duck-flux-food-safety-bill-all-but-dead/ |title=In Lame Duck Flux, Food Safety Bill All But Dead |publisher=Foodsafetynews.com |accessdate=January 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, however, the Senate moved on December 19, 2010 to pass the fixed bill by unanimous consent by a voice vote.&lt;ref name="politico1"/&gt; The House went on to approve the bill by a vote of 215 to 144 on December 21, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2010/roll661.xml |title=Final Vote Results for Roll Call 661 |publisher=Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives |date=December 21, 2013 |accessdate=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/111/house/2/661 | work=The New York Times | title=House Vote 661 – Passes Food Safety Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Barack Obama]] signed the bill into law on Tuesday, January 4, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iuf.unitedfresh.org/newsletters/2011/01/06.php#1 |title=Inside United Fresh |publisher=United Fresh |date=6 January 2011 |accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this bill is meant to address food safety, there are, according to food safety advocate [[William Marler|Bill Marler]], some issues with its effectiveness. Many facilities, such as farms, restaurants, and nonprofit food establishments in which food is prepared for or served directly to the consumer are exempt from the requirements of the bill. Also exempt are facilities that produce food solely for non-human animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marlerblog.com/2009/08/articles/lawyer-oped/a-friday-and-saturday-night-read-hr-2749-food-safety-enhancement-act-2009-so-whats-really-in-it/ A Friday and Saturday night read - H.R. 2749 - Food Safety Enhancement Act 2009 - So, what's really in it?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tester-Hagan Amendment===

Senators [[Jon Tester]] and [[Kay Hagan]] sponsored two amendments that removed farmers, ranchers and local processors from federal oversight, leaving them—as they currently are—within the existing regulatory framework of state and local health and sanitation laws and rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worc.org/userfiles/file/Local%20Foods/QA_Tester_Amendment.pdf |title=S. 510 Food Safety Modernization Act Healthy Local Foods Amendment |publisher=Western Organization of Resource Councils |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendment will offer protections for operations (a.k.a. “qualified facilities”) that sell less than $500,000 a year and sell most (greater than 50%) of their products directly to consumers in the same state and within a 400-mile radius.&lt;ref name="Tester - Hagen Amendment" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marlerblog.com/lawyer-oped/the-tester---hagen-amendment-to-s-510-protects-food-safety-and-small-farmers/ |title=The Tester – Hagen Amendment to S. 510 protects food safety and small farmers |publisher=Marler Blog |accessdate=November 25, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment also applies to all operations that the FDA classified as a "very small business." Small, local farmers would not necessarily need to comply with some of the requirements and produce safety regulations implemented under S. 510.&lt;ref name="Tester - Hagen Amendment" /&gt; Instead, these small-scale producers (like those who sell their goods at farmers' markets or roadside stands) would continue to be regulated by local and state entities. In addition, consumers would know whom they are buying from either by direct sales or clear labeling.&lt;ref name="Tester - Hagen Amendment" /&gt;

Farmers who qualify must provide documentation that the farm is in compliance with state regulations. Documentation may include licenses, inspection reports, or other evidence that the farm is in compliance with State, local, county, or other applicable non-Federal food safety law.&lt;ref name="Food Safety"/&gt; The farm must also prominently and conspicuously display the name and address of farm/facility on its label. For foods without a label then by poster, sign, or placard, at the point of purchase or, in the case of Internet sales, in an electronic notice, or in the case of sales to stores and restaurants, on the invoice.&lt;ref name="Food Safety"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marlerblog.com/lawyer-oped/the-tester---hagen-amendment-to-s-510-protects-food-safety-and-small-farmers/ |title= Food Safety Actction Alert |publisher=National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition |accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==

===Impact and fees===
The legislation affects every aspect of the U.S. food system, from farmers to manufacturers to importers.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/30/AR2009073003271.html?hpid=topnews |title=House Approves Food-Safety Bill; Law Would Expand FDA's Power |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=November 20, 2011 |first=Lyndsey |last=Layton |date=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It places significant responsibilities on farmers and food processors to prevent contamination—a departure from the country's reactive tradition, which has relied on government inspectors to catch tainted food after the fact&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt; The legislation requires food producers and importers to pay an annual $500 registration fee, which would help fund stepped-up FDA inspections, enforcement and related activities such as food-safety research&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt;
About 360,000 facilities in the United States and abroad would be subject to the fees. The Congressional Budget Office reported that the fees would not cover the cost of the new system, leaving the FDA to incur a net cost of $2.2 billion over five years.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt;

===Prevention===
{{Main|Hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls}}
For the first time, the FDA will have a legislative mandate to require comprehensive, science-based preventive controls across the food supply, including pet food and animal feed.
* Mandatory preventive controls for food facilities
:Food facilities are required to implement a written Hazard Analysis and Risk-based Preventive Controls (HARPC) plan. This involves: (1) evaluating the hazards that could affect food safety, (2) specifying what preventive steps, or controls, will be put in place to significantly minimize or prevent the hazards, (3) specifying how the facility will monitor these controls to ensure they are working, (4) maintaining routine records of the monitoring, and (5) specifying what actions the facility will take to correct problems that arise. Animal food manufacturers must implement [[current Good Manufacturing Practices]] and [[Preventive Controls]].(Final rule published September 17, 2015)&lt;ref name="Food Safety Legislation Key Facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Safety Legislation Key Facts|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FSMA/ucm237934.htm|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mandatory produce safety standards
:The FDA must establish science-based, minimum standards for the safe production and harvesting of fruits and vegetables. Those standards must consider naturally occurring hazards, as well as those that may be introduced either unintentionally or intentionally, and must address soil amendments (materials added to the soil such as compost), hygiene, packaging, temperature controls, animals in the growing area and water. (Final regulation due about 2 years following enactment)&lt;ref name="Food Safety Legislation Key Facts"/&gt;
* Radiological hazards
:For the first time, firms must explicitly consider [[radioactive contamination]] as part of their hazard analysis, under chemical safety. The FDA does not anticipate that this will be a hazard that requires continuous monitoring with a Geiger counter. Rather, as an example, a firm that uses spring water in its products should consider having the water tested regularly for the presence of dissolved radon, tritium and heavy metal contaminants. 
* Authority to prevent intentional contamination
:The FDA must issue regulations to protect against the intentional adulteration of food, including the establishment of science-based mitigation strategies to prepare and protect the food supply chain at specific vulnerable points. (Final rule due 18 months following enactment)&lt;ref name="Food Safety Legislation Key Facts"/&gt; This is the first time language involving [[Food Defense]] has been incorporated into law.

===Inspection and compliance===
The FSMA recognizes that preventive control standards improve food safety only to the extent that producers and processors comply with them. FSMA provides the FDA with new authority to conduct inspections and ensure compliance.

[[File:2011 Fiscal year Foreign Food Inspection chart by FDA.png|thumb|500px|The 2011 fiscal year report on foreign food inspections by the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/FDATrack/track?program=ora&amp;id=ORA-ORO-Inspections-Performed-by-Foreign-Inspection-Cadres |title=About FDA |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=April 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

* Mandated inspection frequency 
:The FSMA establishes a mandated inspection frequency, based on risk, for food facilities and requires the frequency of inspection to increase immediately. All high-risk domestic facilities must be inspected within five years of enactment and no less than every three years thereafter. Within one year of enactment, the law directs the FDA to inspect at least 600 foreign facilities and double those inspections every year for the next five years.&lt;ref name="Food Safety Legislation Key Facts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Food Safety Legislation Key Facts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Food Safety Legislation Key Facts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Food Safety Legislation Key Facts"/&gt; To accomplish this projected goal, the USFDA and other agencies in the United States will work in partnership or collaborate with foreign governing bodies for help, due to lack of resources to meet the demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qualityassurancemag.com/qa0811-food-safety-modernization-act-legislative-update.aspx |title=The Food Safety Modernization Act: A New Paradigm for Importers and Global Partnerships |publisher=Quality Assurance &amp; Food Safety Magazine |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Records access
: FDA will have access to records, including industry food safety plans and the records firms will be required to keep documenting implementation of their plans.

* Testing by accredited laboratories
: The FSMA requires certain food testing to be carried out by accredited laboratories and directs the FDA to establish a program for laboratory accreditation to ensure that U.S. food testing laboratories meet high- quality standards. (Establishment of accreditation program due 2 years after enactment)

*Visual inspection
: During an unannounced inspection by the FDA, a visual inspection will be conducted.  During the inspection they will look at the building and equipment to see if there is any possibility of food contamination.  The will probe into poor welds, condensation leaks especially over open product lines.

* Swabbing of environment
: During their cursory walk, the agent will also look for any areas and niches that they feel may be a harborage point for bacteria.  The agents can and will take anywhere form 150- 200 swabs depending on how big the facility is.  The agent will also take raw material samples as well as finished product.  It is advised that the company does not take companion samples because this can double the chances of a lab error, and does not look good if the FDA's samples come up negative and the facilities positive and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Mushrush, Laura. "Three things to expect during unannounced FDA inspections." Food Safety News. N.p., 23 Mar. 2017. Web. 19 Apr. 2017.  http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2017/03/three-things-to-expect-during-unannounced-fda-inspections/#.WPexjfnythE &lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to contaminants/violations===
The bill gives the FDA the authority to recall food in the case of contamination or illness. In addition, it requires farms to track their food and implement plans to deal with recalls or outbreaks of disease. FDA officials will also be given access to food growers records in the case of an outbreak. The bill also requires food importers to verify that they meet US food safety standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/19/AR2010121904032.html |title=Food-safety measure passes Senate in Sunday surprise |work=The Washington Post |date=December 19, 2010 |accessdate=January 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small farms that sell locally or sell less than $500,000 a year are exempt from these new rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|2751}} §103, quoted paragraph (l), to be enacted as {{citation |title={{uscsub|21|418|l}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
New authorities include:
*Mandatory recall
:The FSMA provides the FDA with authority to issue a mandatory recall when a company fails to voluntarily recall unsafe food after being asked to by the FDA.
*Expanded administrative detention
: The FSMA provides the FDA with a more flexible standard for administratively detaining products that are potentially in violation of the law (administrative detention is the procedure the FDA uses to keep suspect food from being moved).
*Suspension of registration
: The FDA can suspend registration of a facility if it determines that the food poses a reasonable probability of serious adverse health consequences or death. A facility that is under suspension is prohibited from distributing food. (Effective 6 months after enactment)
*Enhanced product tracing abilities
: The FDA is directed to establish a system that will enhance its ability to track and trace both domestic and imported foods. In addition, FDA is directed to establish pilot projects to explore and evaluate methods to rapidly and effectively identify recipients of food to prevent or control a food borne illness outbreak. (Implementation of pilots due 9 months after enactment)
* Additional Record keeping for High Risk Foods
: The FDA is directed to issue proposed rule making to establish record keeping requirements for facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold foods that the Secretary designates as high-risk foods. (Implementation due 2 years after enactment).

===Additional information on imported goods===
The FSMA gives the FDA authority to better ensure that imported products meet U.S. standards and are safe for U.S. consumers, with the vision that imported foods should be held to the same standards as domestic foods. These standards will be met by implementing the following components:
*Importer accountability
: For the first time, importers have an explicit responsibility to verify that their foreign suppliers have adequate preventive controls in place to ensure that the food they produce is safe. (Final regulation and guidance due 1 year following enactment)
*Third Party Certification
: The FSMA establishes a program through which qualified third parties can certify that foreign food facilities comply with U.S. food safety standards. This certification may be used to facilitate the entry of imports. (Establishment of a system for the FDA to recognize accreditation bodies is due 2 years after enactment)
*Certification for high risk foods
: The FDA has the authority to require that high-risk imported foods be accompanied by a credible third party certification or other assurance of compliance as a condition of entry into the U.S.
*Voluntary qualified importer program
: The FDA must establish a voluntary program for importers that provides for expedited review and entry of foods from participating importers. Eligibility is limited to, among other things, importers offering food from certified facilities. (Implementation due 18 months after enactment)
*Authority to deny entry
: The FDA can refuse entry into the U.S. of food from a foreign facility if the FDA is denied access by the facility or the country in which the facility is located.

===Enhanced partnerships===
The FSMA builds a formal system of collaboration with other government agencies, both domestic and foreign. In doing so, the statute explicitly recognizes that all food safety agencies need to work together in an integrated way to achieve our public health goals. The following are examples of enhanced collaboration:
* State and local capacity building
: The FDA must develop and implement strategies to leverage and enhance the food safety and defense capacities of State and local agencies. The FSMA provides the FDA with a new multi-year grant mechanism to facilitate investment in State capacity to more efficiently achieve national food safety goals.
*Foreign capacity building
: The law directs the FDA to develop a comprehensive plan to expand the capacity of foreign governments and their industries. One component of the plan is to address training of foreign governments and food producers on U.S. food safety requirements.
*Reliance on inspections by other agencies
: The FDA is explicitly authorized to rely on inspections of other Federal, State and local agencies to meet its increased inspection mandate for domestic facilities. The FSMA also allows the FDA to enter into inter-agency agreements to leverage resources with respect to the inspection of seafood facilities, both domestic and foreign, as well as seafood imports.

=== Employee protections ===
The FSMA also includes provisions that protect employees who try to prevent food safety problems. Section 402 of the FSMA prohibits employers engaged in the manufacture, processing, packing, transporting, distribution, reception, holding or importation of food from retaliating against employees who disclose violations of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]. This particular portion of the FSMA is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/home/gpoxmlc111/h2751_enr.xml |title=H.R. 2751 - Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Amendment With Respect To The Safety Of The Food Supply |publisher=Library of Congress THOMAS |date=January 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
Now that the Act is in place, the FDA must begin the rulemaking process to codify how they intend to enforce the new laws.&lt;ref name="willimanticfood"/&gt;

Effective June 12, 2011, many food companies will be required to develop food safety plans based on an evaluation of hazards related to food manufactured, processed, packed or held in all registered facilities.&lt;ref name="fsm"/&gt; Following a hazard analysis, firms must identify and implement preventive controls to significantly minimize or prevent the occurrence of such hazards. Examples of preventive controls include sanitation procedures for food contact surfaces; employee hygiene training; environmental monitoring to verify pathogen controls; a recall plan; supplier verification activities; and a food allergen control program.&lt;ref name="fsm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodsafetymagazine.com/article.asp?id=4005&amp;sub=sub2 |title= FDA Food Safety Modernization Act: Marking a New Era in U.S. Food Safety |publisher= Food Safety Magazine |accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after the rulemaking process is complete, it will likely be some time before the FDA is fully equipped to enforce the new laws. The agency estimates that it will need at least 1,000 more inspectors
and $1.4 billion over the next five years, and it is certainly not a sure thing that Congress will appropriate such funds given the current economic climate and calls for spending cuts and smaller government.&lt;ref name="willimanticfood"/&gt;

=== Rules ===
The first public comment period occurred in 2013, and the agency received tens of thousands of comments in that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallfarms.oregonstate.edu/node/175900|title=New Food Safety Rules: Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) {{!}} Small Farms Programs|website=smallfarms.oregonstate.edu|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA previously submitted their proposed regulations to the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) for review, and in that process the OMB weakened the regulations in a variety of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2013/03/documents-show-omb-weakened-fdas-food-safety-rules/#.V97aaZMrKRs|title=Documents Show OMB Weakened FDA's Food Safety Rules {{!}} Food Safety News|date=2013-03-25|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the FDA was sued by consumer groups the [[Center for Food Safety]] (CFS) and the [[Center for Environmental Health]] for its failure to meet deadlines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2014/02/fsma-gets-new-deadlines-for-final-rules/#.V97bhpMrKRs|title=FSMA Gets New Deadlines for Final Rules {{!}} Food Safety News|date=2014-02-21|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In settling the litigation, the agency agreed to deadlines in 2015 and 2016 for certain rules.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===FSMA progress report ===

Now, the FDA has planned to make available to the general public and to Congress significant progress they have made towards implementing the FSMA.&lt;ref name="FDAFoodSafetyModernizationAct"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodSafety/FSMA/UCM298188.pdf|title=FDA Progress Report on Implementing the Food Safety Modernization Act: January – March 2012 |publisher=FDA FSMA |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, the FDA’s Senior Advisor, Coordinated Outbreak Response and Evaluation Network, Sherri McGarry, on a blog reported the types of foods to be used in the pilot project on tracing products to prevent illnesses.&lt;ref name="FDAtransparencyblog"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://fdatransparencyblog.fda.gov/2012/03/15/rapid-tracing-of-food-products-prevents-illness/|title=Rapid Tracing of Food Products Prevents illness |publisher=FDA Transparency Blog|accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list includes tomatoes, frozen Kung Pao-style dishes, jarred peanut butter, and dry, packaged peanut/spice.&lt;ref name="FDAtransparencyblog"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://fdatransparencyblog.fda.gov/2012/03/15/rapid-tracing-of-food-products-prevents-illness/|title=Rapid Tracing of Food Products Prevents illness |publisher=FDA Transparency Blog|accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tomatoes both sliced and whole was chosen because of the significant number of outbreaks recorded; it mirrors a multifaceted food supply chain and it was recognized by majority of the food industry associations as the number one food product to be used in the pilot program.&lt;ref name="FDAtransparencyblog"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://fdatransparencyblog.fda.gov/2012/03/15/rapid-tracing-of-food-products-prevents-illness/|title=Rapid Tracing of Food Products Prevents illness |publisher=FDA Transparency Blog|accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Frozen Kung Pao-style dishes have ingredients such as chicken, red pepper spice and peanut products which are foods that are involved in outbreaks, for this reason they are in the pilot project.&lt;ref name="FDAtransparencyblog"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://fdatransparencyblog.fda.gov/2012/03/15/rapid-tracing-of-food-products-prevents-illness/|title=Rapid Tracing of Food Products Prevents illness |publisher=FDA Transparency Blog|accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is supplied to diverse food chain distribution channels which could be involved in imported and domestic products.&lt;ref name="FDAtransparencyblog"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://fdatransparencyblog.fda.gov/2012/03/15/rapid-tracing-of-food-products-prevents-illness/|title=Rapid Tracing of Food Products Prevents illness |publisher=FDA Transparency Blog|accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To increase the intricacy of the pilot project, the jarred peanut butter and dry, packaged spice peanut were included.&lt;ref name="FDAtransparencyblog"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://fdatransparencyblog.fda.gov/2012/03/15/rapid-tracing-of-food-products-prevents-illness/|title=Rapid Tracing of Food Products Prevents illness |publisher=FDA Transparency Blog|accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This summer, the pilot projects results will be accomplished with hopes of developing a complete product tracing system with the information received.&lt;ref name="FDAtransparencyblog"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://fdatransparencyblog.fda.gov/2012/03/15/rapid-tracing-of-food-products-prevents-illness/|title=Rapid Tracing of Food Products Prevents illness |publisher=FDA Transparency Blog|accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
The Safety Act was signed into law along with the [[Government Performance and Results Act|Government Performance and Results Modernization Act]] of 2010. The cost for the first five years is projected to be $1.4 billion and is not yet fully funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreffectivegov.org/node/11441 |title=President Obama Signs Landmark Food Safety Bill |publisher=Center for Effective Government |date=January 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food facility registration ===

Since October 22, 2012, the updated food facility registration system by the US FDA is available. This update requires all facilities previously registered prior to October 1, 2012 to renew registration. Failure to do so is a prohibited act and will lead to refusal of entry for foreign products and illegal trade for domestic facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FSMA/ucm314178.htm 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1.241] Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Retrieved November 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Every 2 years in even numbered years, every registered facility needs to renew its registration between October 1 and December 31. Registration is accepted by fax, mail and electronics means on the FDA food facility registration website.

As of January 22, 2014 there were 195,518 food facilities registered with the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.registrarcorp.com/fda-food/registration/data-2014.jsp "2014 U.S. FDA Food Facility Registration Data"]. Registrar Corp. Retrieved June 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction and controversy ==
Large trade organizations have joined public health advocates in supporting the bill, while groups aligned with individuals and small farms have generally opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maplight.org/us-congress/bill/111-s-510/360488 |title=FDA Food Safety Modernization Act - Senate Vote: On Passage &amp;#124; Total Campaign Contributions |publisher=MapLight |date=December 31, 2010 |accessdate=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after [[United States Senate|Senate]] adoption of [[Jon Tester]]'s amendment, which allows for the possible exemption of producers that sell less than $500,000 a year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://missoulanews.bigskypress.com/IndyBlog/archives/2010/11/30/senate-passes-food-safety-act-with-testers-amendment |title=Senate passes Food Safety Act with Tester's amendment &amp;#124; Indy Blog |publisher=Missoulanews.bigskypress.com |date=November 30, 2010 |accessdate=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; many large food companies objected, arguing that the exemption puts consumers at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Salahi |first=Lara |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/senate-votes-food-safety-overhaul/story?id=12283655&amp;page=2 |title=Senate Votes for Food Safety Overhaul |publisher=ABC News |date=December 1, 2010 |accessdate=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after enactment the agency has fallen behind on expected progress. It has yet to implement "a specific timetable for issuing" a process to create rule for science-based produce standards, has not completed rules for foreign supplier verification, and must still create a guidance that will help schools and childcare programs lessen allergy risks for school-age children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2012/01/the-food-safety-modernization-act---one-year-later/|author=Bottemiller, Helena |title=The Food Safety Modernization Act - One Year Later |work=[[Food Safety News]] |date=January 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar set of New Zealand rules, the Food Bill 160-2, is moving towards passage since 2010. The primary effects expected are to tie New Zealand to [[Codex Alimentarius]] and the [[World Trade Organization]] permanently, although those international agreements will be constantly adjusted. Despite its 366 pages, Food Bill 160-2 cannot directly resolve many threats to food safety, as there is no added [[Produce traceability]] nor methods to control [[Antibiotic resistance]]. Controversy has been intense in NZ regarding introduction of genetic engineered plants and animals (GE); concern is that WTO and Codex will require opening up NZ to GE.

There has been criticism that the FDA's proposed rule&lt;ref&gt;{{USFR|78|64735}} (October 29, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; would be prohibitively expensive on the practice of alcoholic beverage facilities selling spent grain to farmers for animal food.&lt;ref name=beer&gt;{{Cite news|title=Beer prices could go up under FDA rule that angers farmers, brewers|first=Lynne|last=Terry|date=April 18, 2014|work=[[The Oregonian]]|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2014/04/fda_rule_would_increase_cost_o.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under current law, alcoholic beverages, such as beer, wine, cider and spirits, are exempt from the FDA's normal oversight of food products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=After outcry, FDA to revise proposed rules on brewery grain as feed|first=Sean|last=Scully|work=[[The Press Democrat]]|url=http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20140403/articles/140409816}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA will open up the rule to comments again this summer{{When|date=June 2017}} and then revise the proposal, which is due to be finalized by August 2015.&lt;ref name=beer/&gt;

The proposed rules regulate the "good manufacturing practice in manufacturing, processing, packing or holding of animal food" and "require that certain facilities establish and implement [[hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls]] for food for animals", but animal food at alcoholic beverage facilities would not be exempt pursuant to section 116 of FSMA&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|21|2206}}&lt;/ref&gt; since "those spent grains are not alcoholic beverages themselves, and they are not in a prepackaged form that prevents any direct human contact with the food".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=FDA's Proposed Rules May Affect Breweries and Distilleries|first=Jeffrey|last=Klein|date=November 8, 2013|publisher=LaszloLaw|url=http://www.laszlolaw.com/colorado-beverage-lawyer-new-fda-rules-affect-breweries-distilleries/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cranial nerves short}}

The '''facial nerve''' is the '''seventh [[Cranial nerves|cranial nerve]]''', or simply '''CN VII'''. It emerges from the [[pons]] of the [[brainstem]], controls the muscles of facial expression, and functions in the conveyance of [[taste]] sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the [[tongue]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://teachmeanatomy.info/head/cranial-nerves/facial-nerve/|title=The Facial Nerve (CN VII)|date=2013-09-04|work=TeachMeAnatomy|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nerves typically travels from the [[pons]] through the facial canal in the temporal bone and exits the skull at the [[stylomastoid foramen]]. It arises from the brainstem from an area posterior to the [[Abducens nerve|cranial nerve VI]] (abducens nerve) and anterior to [[cranial nerve 8|cranial nerve VIII]] (vestibulocochlear nerve).

The facial nerve also supplies preganglionic [[parasympathetic]] fibers to several head and neck [[ganglia]].

The facial and [[intermediate nerve]]s can be collectively referred to as the '''nervus intermediofacialis.'''

==Structure==
The path of the facial nerve can be divided into six segments.
# intracranial (cisternal) segment
# meatal segment (brainstem to internal auditory canal)
# labyrinthine segment (internal auditory canal to geniculate ganglion)
# tympanic segment (from [[geniculate ganglion]] to pyramidal eminence)
# mastoid segment (from pyramidal eminence to stylomastoid foramen)
# extratemporal segment (from stylomastoid foramen to post parotid branches)

# The motor part of the facial nerve arises from the [[facial nerve nucleus]] in the [[pons]] while the sensory and parasympathetic parts of the facial nerve arise from the [[intermediate nerve]].   
# From the brain stem, the motor and sensory parts of the facial nerve join together and traverse the [[posterior cranial fossa]] before entering the [[petrous temporal bone]] via the [[internal auditory meatus]].  Upon exiting the internal auditory meatus, the nerve then runs a tortuous course through the [[facial canal]], which is divided into the labyrinthine, tympanic, and mastoid segments.  
#The labyrinthine segment is very short, and ends where the facial nerve forms a bend known as the geniculum of the facial nerve ("genu" meaning knee), which contains the [[geniculate ganglion]] for sensory nerve bodies.  The first branch of the facial nerve, the [[greater petrosal nerve|greater superficial petrosal nerve]], arises here from the geniculate ganglion. The greater petrosal nerve runs through the pterygoid canal and synapses at the pterygopalatine ganglion.  Post synaptic fibers of the greater petrosal nerve innervate the lacrimal gland. 
#In the tympanic segment, the facial nerve runs through the [[tympanic cavity]], medial to the [[incus]]. 
#The pyramidal eminence is the second bend in the facial nerve, where the nerve runs downward as the mastoid segment.  In the temporal part of the facial canal, the nerve gives rise to the stapedius and [[chorda tympani]]. The chorda tympani supplies taste fibers to the anterior two thirds of the tongue, and also synapses with the [[submandibular ganglion]]. Postsynaptic fibers from the submandibular ganglion supply the sublingual and submandibular glands.
#Upon emerging from the [[stylomastoid foramen]], the facial nerve gives rise to the posterior auricular branch.  The facial nerve then passes through the [[parotid gland]], which it does not innervate, to form the parotid plexus, which splits into five branches innervating the muscles of facial expression (temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular, cervical).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1155/2013/248039 | issn = 2090-1941 | volume = 2013

===Intracranial branches===
*[[Greater petrosal nerve]] – It arises at the geniculate ganglion and provides parasympathetic innervation to several glands, including the [[nasal glands]], the [[palatine glands]], the [[lacrimal gland]], and the [[pharyngeal gland]]. It also provides parasympathetic innervation to the [[sphenoid sinus]], [[frontal sinus]], [[maxillary sinus]], [[ethmoid sinus]] and [[nasal cavity]]. This nerve also includes taste fibers for [[palate]] via [[lesser palatine nerve]] and [[greater palatine nerve]].
*Communicating branch to the [[otic ganglion]] – It arises at the [[geniculate ganglion]] and joins the [[lesser petrosal nerve]] to reach the otic ganglion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Textbook of Clinical Neuroanatomy |edition=2nd |first1=Vishram |last1=Singh |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Nerve to stapedius]] – provides motor innervation for [[stapedius]] muscle in middle ear 
* [[Chorda tympani]]
** Parasympathetic innervation to [[submandibular gland]]
** Parasympathetic innervation to [[sublingual gland]] 
** Special sensory taste fibers for the anterior 2/3 of the tongue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Extracranial branches===
Distal to [[stylomastoid foramen]], the following nerves branch off the facial nerve: 
* [[Posterior auricular nerve]] – controls movements of some of the scalp muscles around the ear
* Branch to Posterior belly of [[Digastric muscle]] as well as the [[Stylohyoid muscle]]
* Five major facial branches (in parotid gland) – from top to bottom:
** [[Temporal branch of the facial nerve|Temporal branch]]
** [[Zygomatic branch of the facial nerve|Zygomatic branch]]
** [[Buccal branch of the facial nerve|Buccal branch]]
** [[Marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve|Marginal mandibular branch]]
** [[Cervical branch of the facial nerve|Cervical branch]]

# By locating the posterior facial vein at the inferior aspect of the gland where the marginal branch would be seen crossing it.|date=January 2011}}
#lateral semicircular canal
# foot of incus

===Nucleus===
The cell bodies for the facial nerve are grouped in anatomical areas called [[nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nuclei]] or [[ganglion|ganglia]]. The cell bodies for the afferent nerves are found in the [[geniculate ganglion]] for taste sensation.  The cell bodies for muscular efferent nerves are found in the [[facial motor nucleus]] whereas the cell bodies for the parasympathetic efferent nerves are found in the [[superior salivatory nucleus]].

===Development===
The facial nerve is developmentally derived from the second [[pharyngeal arch]], or branchial arch.  The second arch is called the hyoid arch because it contributes to the formation of the lesser horn and upper body of the [[hyoid bone]] (the rest of the hyoid is formed by the third arch).  The facial nerve supplies motor and sensory innervation to the muscles formed by the second pharyngeal arch, including the [[facial muscles|muscles of facial expression]], the posterior belly of the digastric, stylohyoid and stapedius.  The motor division of the facial nerve is derived from the [[Basal plate (neural tube)|basal plate]] of the [[embryo]]nic [[pons]], while the sensory division originates from the [[cranial neural crest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | edition = Sixth | publisher = LWW | isbn = 9781451190380 | last = Dudek | first = Ronald W. 
| title = BRS Embryology | date = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the anterior two thirds of the tongue are derived from the [[first pharyngeal arch]], which gives rise to cranial nerve V, not all innervation of the tongue is supplied by CN V.  The lingual branch of the mandibular division (V3) of CN V supplies non-taste sensation (pressure, heat, texture) from the anterior part of the tongue via [[general visceral afferent fibers]].  Nerve fibers for taste are supplied by the chorda tympani branch of cranial nerve VII via [[special visceral afferent]] fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | edition = 9th | publisher = Saunders | isbn = 9781437720020 | last = Moore | first = Keith L. |author2=T. V. N. Persaud |author3=Mark G. Torchia  | title = The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology with Student Consult Online Access, 9th Edition | location = Philadelphia, PA | date = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==

===Facial expression===
The main function of the facial nerve is motor control of all of the [[facial muscles|muscles of facial expression]]. It also innervates the posterior belly of the [[digastric]] muscle, the [[stylohyoid]] muscle, and the [[stapedius]] muscle of the [[middle ear]]. All of these muscles are striated muscles of [[special visceral efferent|branchiomeric]] origin developing from the 2nd pharyngeal arch.

===Facial sensation===
In addition, the facial nerve receives [[taste]] sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the [[tongue]] via the [[chorda tympani]]. Taste sensation is sent to the gustatory portion (superior part) of the [[solitary nucleus]]. General sensation from the anterior two-thirds of tongue are supplied by afferent fibers of the third division of the fifth cranial nerve (V-3).  These sensory (V-3) and taste (VII) fibers travel together as the lingual nerve briefly before the chorda tympani leaves the lingual nerve to enter the tympanic cavity (middle ear) via the petrotympanic fissure. It joins the rest of the facial nerve via the canaliculus for chorda tympani. The facial nerve then forms the [[geniculate ganglion]], which contains the cell bodies of the taste fibers of chorda tympani and other taste and sensory pathways. From the geniculate ganglion, the taste fibers continue as the intermediate nerve which goes to the upper anterior quadrant of the fundus of the [[internal acoustic meatus]] along with the motor root of the facial nerve. The intermediate nerve reaches the posterior cranial fossa via the internal acoustic meatus before synapsing in the [[solitary nucleus]].

The facial nerve also supplies a small amount of afferent innervation to the [[oropharynx]] below the [[palatine tonsil]]. There is also a small amount of cutaneous sensation carried by the [[nervus intermedius]] from the skin in and around the [[Pinna (anatomy)|auricle]] (outer ear).

===Other===

The facial nerve also supplies [[parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic]] fibers to the [[submandibular gland]] and [[sublingual gland]]s via [[chorda tympani]]. Parasympathetic innervation serves to increase the flow of saliva from these glands. It also supplies parasympathetic innervation to the nasal mucosa and the [[lacrimal gland]] via the [[pterygopalatine ganglion]]. The parasympathetic fibers that travel in the facial nerve originate in the [[superior salivatory nucleus]].

The facial nerve also functions as the efferent limb of the [[corneal reflex]].

===Functional components===
The facial nerve carries axons of type GSA, [[general somatic afferent]], to skin of the posterior ear.

The facial nerve also carries axons of type GVE, [[general visceral efferent]], which innervate the sublingual, submandibular, and lacrimal glands, also mucosa of nasal cavity.

Axons of type SVE, [[special visceral efferent]], innervate muscles of facial expression, stapedius, the posterior belly of digastric, and the stylohyoid.

The axons of type SVA, [[special visceral afferent]], provide taste to the anterior two-thirds of tongue via chorda tympani.

==Clinical significance==

===Palsy===
{{See also|Bell's palsy|acute facial nerve paralysis}}
People may suffer from [[acute facial nerve paralysis]], which is usually manifested by facial paralysis.
[[Bell's palsy]] is one type of [[idiopathic]] acute facial nerve paralysis, which is more accurately described as a multiple cranial nerve ganglionitis that involves the facial nerve, and most likely results from viral infection and also sometimes as a result of [[Lyme disease]]. Iatrogenic Bell's Palsy may also be as a result of an incorrectly placed dental local-anesthetic ([[Inferior alveolar nerve anaesthesia|Inferior alveolar nerve block]]). Although giving the appearance of a hemi-plegic stroke, effects dissipate with the drug. When the facial nerve is permanently damaged due to a birth defect, trauma, or other disorder, surgery including a cross facial nerve graft or masseteric facial nerve transfer may be performed to help regain facial movement.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} [[Facial nerve decompression]] surgery is also sometimes carried out in certain cases of facial nerve compression.

===Examination===
Voluntary facial movements, such as wrinkling the brow, showing teeth, frowning, closing the eyes tightly (inability to do so is called [[lagophthalmos]])&lt;ref name=Lindgren&gt;Kliniska Färdigheter: Informationsutbytet Mellan Patient Och Läkare, LINDGREN, STEFAN, {{ISBN|91-44-37271-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
, pursing the lips and puffing out the cheeks, all test the facial nerve. There should be no noticeable asymmetry.

In an [[upper motor neuron|UMN]] lesion, called [[central seven]], only the lower part of the face on the contralateral side will be affected, due to the bilateral control to the upper facial muscles (frontalis and orbicularis oculi).

[[Lower motor neuron]] lesions can result in a CNVII palsy ([[Bell's palsy]] is the idiopathic form of facial nerve palsy), manifested as both upper and lower facial weakness on the same side of the lesion.

Taste can be tested on the anterior 2/3 of the tongue. This can be tested with a swab dipped in a flavoured solution, or with electronic stimulation (similar to putting your tongue on a battery).

[[Corneal reflex]]. The afferent arc is mediated by the General Sensory afferents of the [[Trigeminal Nerve]].  The efferent arc occurs via the Facial Nerve. The reflex involves consensual blinking of both eyes in response to stimulation of one eye. This is due to the Facial Nerve's innervation of the muscles of facial expression, namely [[Orbicularis oculi]], responsible for blinking. Thus, the corneal reflex effectively tests the proper functioning of both Cranial Nerves V and VII.

'''Golyam Beglik''' is a reservoir near the central parts of the [[Rhodope Mountains]], [[Bulgaria]]. It was formerly officially called the '''Vasil Kolarov reservoir''' in honour of [[Vasil Kolarov]], a communist political leader of the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]].

The reservoir [[Batak Dam|Batak]], [[Beglika]], [[Shiroka Polyana]] and Golyam Beglik are the main tourist places in the region of [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]]. The lakes are located to the north and to the south at high sea level.

There is a large diversity of game near the reservoir territory. There are [[bear]], [[deer]], [[fox]]es, [[wolf|wol]]ves, as well as smaller animals such as [[rabbit]]s, [[hedgehog]]s, [[squirrel]]s. There are also many wild [[duck]]s and geese near its water areas. The place is well suited for developing hunting tourism that is traditional in the region.

'''Hamchoon Women's Clinic''' (함춘여성산부인과) is a specialized clinic for [[infertility]], [[genetic testing]], and general Medical and health organizations in South Korea care. It also started to provide a childbirth service in 2008 by opening a branch in [[Apgujeong-dong]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hamchoon.co.kr/?c=01/012&lt;/ref&gt; Hamchoon is especially renowned for genetic testing for disorders such as [[Down Syndrome]]. The clinic also has a separate laboratory dedicated to infertility and genetics and a subsidiary for developing healthcare technology.

The current chairman of Hamchoon Women's Clinic is Dr. Kichul Kim.

==History==
Hamchoon Women's Clinic was founded in 1992 as a partnership hospital. The initial partners were Kichul Kim, Sohyun Park, and Eungi Min. In 1993, Doyoung Hwang joined the team. Hamchoon soon started to practice "Triple Marker", which was a genetic test for fetus. In 1997, Hamchoon established a laboratory dedicated to infertility, genetics, and medical technology. After a year from the establishment, the Hamchoon Laboratory announced the development of "HIT", a prenatal diagnosis package. Hamchoon Women's Clinic and its laboratory moved to a new building in Seocho, Seoul. In 2005, the clinic was recognized from Ministry of Health and Welfare as a legal embryo research institution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hamchoon.co.kr/?c=01/012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
As of 2008, the partnership consists of Kichul Kim and Doyoung Hwang. Two of the initial partners, Sohyun Park and Eungi Min, left the partnership.

Hamchoon Women's Clinic currently have 10 doctors&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hamchoon.co.kr/?c=01/012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://도곡산부인과.한국/&lt;/ref&gt; specialized in OB/GYN and infertility. In addition, the clinic has specialists for anesthetic and radiology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6831">'''Health Score''' is a scoring system used by several mobile health companies in various ways to track an individual's health via [[Quantified Self]]  and the help of mobile applications, [[social networking]] and elements of [[gamification]]. According to them when tracked over time, it offers a good directional indicator of how the users health and well-being is evolving over time. The scoring engine varies considerably from one company to another, and in some cases, the scoring engine is trademarked and/or patented,&lt;ref name="Reuters: dacadoo Obtains US Patent for Health Score"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reuters: dacadoo Obtains US Patent for Health Score|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/06/24/bc-dacadoo-idUKnPn6R1Fd8+94+PRN20140624|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141202151927/http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/06/24/bc-dacadoo-idUKnPn6R1Fd8+94+PRN20140624|archivedate=2014-12-02|work=dacadoo Obtains US Patent for its Health Score and Launches New Website|accessdate=June 24, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as in the case of [[Dacadoo]]. Health is invisible and therefore, all health scores in use have one thing in common: they want to capture and measure health and wellness and make it visible.

==Overview==
Health is invisible and intangible. The basic premise of a health scoring concept is that what you can measure, you can manage. If you can measure health and wellness good enough as an indicator, then you can start working with it. None of the available health scores is in medical diagnosis, they're all lifestyle-products where the health score in use is to be understood as an indicator, a number that helps you to work with it.
The score typically moves up or down indicating improvement, when it moves up, and vice versa. The simpler health scores available are more static in nature and provide a number based on some inputs provided.  The more sophisticated health scores are dynamic and function in real-time, moving (such as exercise, nutrition, stress and sleep) change.
Most health scores claim they are based on scientific data. The simpler models use one or a few models, the more sophisticated health scores claim to include a vast amount of models and person-years of clinical data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://research2guidance.com/health-scores-the-business-of-apps-that-aggregates-health-and-fitness-data-into-one-score-interview-with-peter-ohnemus-ceo-and-founder-of-dacadoo/|title=Health scores: The business of apps that aggregates health and fitness data into one score. Interview with Peter Ohnemus, CEO and founder of Dacadoo|author=Ralf-Gordon Jahns|publisher=Research 2 Guidance|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some health scores use in addition to static questionnaires also dynamic and ongoing data, such as captured and tracked by fitness or activity trackers or applications for smartphones, For instance, exercise can be tracked automatically by using a mobile app for smartphones to track the activity, or by using fitness tracking apps or devices from the supplier of the health score solution, or by connecting popular fitness tracking apps such as RunKeeper and activity tracking devices such as Fitbit or UP Jawbone step counters, etc.
In the past, available information was limited and lifestyle adjustments were largely made only once a health problem was detected, and then under the guidance of healthcare professionals. Today due partly to the availability of electronic mass media there is a trend among the population to maintain their health on their own terms. This seems to be precipitating a shift away from the reactive model of health to a more proactive approach where the individual works towards the maintenance of their wellness before problems arise. This shift in attitudes is said to have broad implications for both public health and individual companies. Improved health would logically lead to reduced healthcare costs and increase workplace productivity.

A wide array of technologies are now available that allow data to be collected on various components of wellness many of them using a variant of the Health Scoring system. Devices for measuring physical attributes, such as blood pressure, blood glucose, and total cholesterol are also commonly used by patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes or hypertension. Furthermore, devices that can be used by healthy individuals to monitor exercise and energy expenditure are increasingly popular, and range from simple heart rate monitors or step counters to more elaborate computerized exercise machines. These tools provide data on the user’s performance and many can upload the data to further systems to be processed. Undoubtedly, the largest growth area has been in apps, facilitated by the widespread use of tablets and smartphones. Although some of these apps may be gimmicks, many are said to be validated genuine tools to assist in improving health and wellness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.dacadoo.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2012/06/TheTruthToldAboutHealthScoringMcCannHealth.pdf|title=The Truth Told About Health Scoring|year=2014|publisher=McCann|series=White Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the Health Score using companies such as [[Fitocracy]] have grown to over one million users or more by focusing progress based on what's known as [[gamification]] as well as by celebrity exposure with the likes of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] promoting their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/26/fitocracys-1m-users-including-arnold-schwarzenegger-are-more-engaged-than-any-other-social-network-besides-facebook/android-2-4/|author=Jordan Crook|title=Fitocracy’s 1M Users, Including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Are More Engaged Than Any Other Social Network Besides Facebook|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|date=March 26, 2013|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism==
The large majority of offerings with health scores is in the lifestyle segment and not in medical diagnosis, therefore prospective clinical trials to scientifically prove whether a score is accurate or not, are often missing.

A single integer measuring wellness and health outcomes is subject to many unknown variables and incomplete data.

Chopin sits in bed, in presence of ''(from left)'' Aleksander Jełowicki, Chopin's sister [[Ludwika Jędrzejewicz|Ludwika]], [[Marcelina Czartoryska]], [[Wojciech Grzymała]], [[Teofil Kwiatkowski|Kwiatkowski]].]]
'''[[Frédéric Chopin]]'s disease''' and the reason for his premature death at age 39 were frequently debated for over 150 years.  Although he was diagnosed with and treated for [[tuberculosis]] throughout his lifetime, a number of alternative diagnoses had been suggested since his death in 1849. A comprehensive review of the possible causes of Chopin's illness was published in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Lagerberg, Steven. "Chopin's Heart - The Quest to Identify the Mysterious Illness of the World's Most Beloved Composer." Lagerberg, 2011, {{ISBN|1-4564-0296-X}}.{{page needed|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An autopsy on Chopin's heart, for which permission was finally given in 2017, indicated the likely cause of death as [[pericarditis]], caused by tuberculosis.

==Case history==

}}
From childhood, Frédéric Chopin was sickly and under medical care. He showed intolerance to fatty foods, especially pork &amp;ndash; these caused [[stomach ache]]s, [[diarrhea]] and weight loss. Later he endeavored to avoid such symptoms with diet; he obtained substantial improvement with ingredients such as [[honey]] and [[oat bran]]. Chopin attained a height of {{convert|170|cm|ftin}} — the 25th [[percentile]]; and as an adult weighed under {{convert|45|kg|lb}} — below the 3rd percentile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Shea JG |title=Was Frédéric Chopin's illness actually cystic fibrosis? |journal=The Medical Journal of Australia |volume=147 |issue=11-12 |pages=586–9 |year=1987 |pmid=3320707 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chopin is known to have had no [[facial hair]] at the age of 22; as he wrote in the winter of 1832, he grew [[sideburns]] on only one side of his face.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kuzemko |first1=JA |title=Chopin's illnesses |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=87 |issue=12 |pages=769–72 |year=1994 |pmid=7853308 |pmc=1294992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1826 he was sick for six months, suffering from enlarged [[cervical lymph nodes]] and severe [[headache]]s. In 1830, a chronic cold caused nasal [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] which prompted him to cancel planned concerts in Vienna.

In 1831, while in Paris, the 21-year-old Chopin had his first episode of [[hemoptysis]] (coughing up of blood). In 1835, he suffered a severe two-month bout of [[laryngitis]] and [[bronchitis]], and the resulting interruption in his correspondence with Warsaw gave rise to gossip that he had died.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Shea: Music &amp; Medicine: Medical Profiles of Great Composers. London: Dent, 1990, p. 144. {{ISBN|0-460-86106-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early youth, he treated himself with [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]]. In the final decade of his life, he treated the coughing fits from which he had suffered his entire life with a blend of sugar and [[opium]]. Chopin coughed up an abundant amount of [[mucus]], particularly around 10 a.m.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Shea: Music &amp; Medicine: Medical Profiles of Great Composers. London: Dent, 1990, p. 143. {{ISBN|0-460-86106-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He occasionally drank alcohol, sometimes smoked and &amp;ndash; as some authors noted &amp;ndash; suffered the consequences of inhaling others' smoke while enjoying the company of his Parisian friends.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; In the last year of his life, he endured diarrheas, caused either by [[cor pulmonale]] or by [[exocrine pancreatic insufficiency]] (see below).

On 17 October 1849, at 2 a.m., after a sudden coughing fit, Chopin died at the age of 39. His physician, [[Jean Cruveilhier]], confirmed his death by holding a mirror to Chopin's mouth and by illuminating his pupils with light from a candle. Pursuant to Chopin's will, Dr. Cruveilhier, a renowned professor of [[pathology]], carried out an [[autopsy]]. The postmortem findings were also communicated to Chopin's sister [[Ludwika Jędrzejewicz|Ludwika]], [[Adolphe Gutmann]] and [[Jane Stirling]]. The postmortem report was destroyed either in the Paris fire of 1871 or during World War II. The [[death certificate]] stated the cause of Chopin's death as tuberculosis of the lungs and larynx. However, [[Wojciech Grzymała]], in a letter to [[Auguste Leo]] dated October 1849, wrote that the autopsy had not confirmed tubercular pulmonary changes and that his actual disease was unknown to contemporary medicine.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Shea: Music &amp; Medicine: Medical Profiles of Great Composers. London: Dent, 1990, p. 149. {{ISBN|0-460-86106-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physicians==
It is uncertain how many physicians Chopin had; various authors have given the number as 14,&lt;ref&gt;K. Barry, "Chopin and His Fourteen Doctors", Sydney Austral. Med. Publish. Co., 1934, cited from Sielużycki, 1976.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 31&lt;ref name="sieluzycki"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sielużycki C | year = 1976 | title = Lekarze Chopina | url = | journal = Archiwum Historii Medycyny | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 305–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "nearly 50".&lt;ref&gt;E. Stocki (1956), ''"Zapomniani lekarze-przyjaciele Fryderyka Chopina"'', ''Polski Tygodnik Lekarski'', 24, pp. 1102-4 (1956). Cited from Sielużycki, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the composer had friendly relations with other physicians, who may also have occasionally provided him with assistance.&lt;ref name="sieluzycki" /&gt;

In [[Warsaw]], Chopin's physicians were Jan Fryderyk Wilhelm Malcz, Franciszek Girardot and Fryderyk Adolf Roemer. In [[Vienna]], Chopin was provided medical care by Johann Malfatti. Chopin's physicians in [[Paris]] included Aleksander Hofman, Jean-Jacques Molin, André François Cauviere, [[Jan Matuszyński]], Adam Raciborski, Pierre Gaubert, Gustave Papet and Coste. During his 1848 stay in [[London]] &amp;ndash; Mallan and James Clark. In Paris, in 1848–49, he was treated by Léon Simon, Fraenkel, David Koreff, Louis and Roth.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; Chopin's last physician was [[Jean Cruveilhier]].

==Family history==
Little is known about the health of Frédéric’s father, [[Nicolas Chopin]], who lived to the age of 73 and suffered several times from [[respiratory infection]]s. The composer's mother had no chronic illness and reached the age of 87.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Of Frédéric’s three sisters, Izabela died at age 70 and had no illnesses; [[Ludwika Jędrzejewicz|Ludwika]] suffered from recurrent respiratory infections and died at 47; the youngest, [[Emilia Chopin|Emilia]], was of frail health from earliest childhood. Emilia suffered from recurrent coughs and [[dyspnea]]; at 11 she began having [[hemorrhage]]s from the [[upper gastrointestinal tract]], and she died of a massive hemorrhage at 14.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Tuberculosis==
Chopin was diagnosed with tuberculosis and treated for it in accordance with contemporary practice, including [[bloodletting]] and [[Colon cleansing|purging]]. Tuberculosis figured in his death certificate, despite the alleged absence of typical organ changes. Critics of  alternative hypotheses about Chopin's disease point out the abundant evidence for tuberculosis.&lt;ref name=pmid9726766&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cheng TO |title=Chopin's illness |journal=Chest |volume=114 |issue=2 |pages=654–5 |year=1998 |pmid=9726766 |doi=10.1378/chest.114.2.654-a }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1378/chest.114.2.655 |last1=Margolis |first1=ML |title=The long suffering of Frederic Chopin, revisited |journal=Chest |volume=114 |issue=2 |pages=655 |year=1998 |pmid=9726767}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carter ER |title=Chopin's malady |journal=Chest |volume=114 |issue=2 |pages=655–6 |year=1998 |pmid=9726768 |doi=10.1378/chest.114.2.655-a }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic coughs and hemoptysis are common symptoms of tuberculosis; complications may include both [[pericarditis]], causing right-heart insufficiency, and [[bronchiectasis]], manifesting in productive cough and respiratory failure.

A 20-year history of [[hemoptysis]] is rare in tuberculosis but not impossible.  Similarly, cavernous tuberculosis is rare in childhood, but it cannot be excluded in the case of Emilia Chopin. Frédéric could have contracted tuberculosis from his younger sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=John M. |last1=O'Shea |title=Music &amp; medicine: medical profiles of great composers |publisher=Dent |location=London |year=1990 |pages=142–3 |isbn=0-460-86106-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A monograph on historic methods of treating tuberculosis has discussed individual treatments on the example of Chopin, since his history well illustrates views on treating tuberculosis in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Esmond R. |last1=Long |year=1956 |title=A History of the Therapy of Tuberculosis and the Case of Frederic Chopin |publisher=[[University Press of Kansas]] |location=[[Lawrence, Kansas]] |pages= |oclc=14617261}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autopsy and results==
Attempts were made to gain permission to extract a small amount of tissue from Chopin's heart in order to test it for a range of specific conditions.  Dr. Michael Witt of Warsaw's Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology made such a request in 2008, but permission was denied by the Polish government.&lt;ref&gt;Robin McKie, "Row over plan to DNA test Chopin's heart". [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/27/classicalmusicandopera.genetics ''The Guardian'', 27 July 2008]. Retrieved 3 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, an autopsy was at last performed on Chopin's alcohol-preserved heart, under the direction of Professor Witt of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]].  It revealed that a rare case of [[pericarditis]], caused by complications from chronic [[tuberculosis]], was the likely cause of Chopin's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKie|first1=Robin|title=Examination of Chopin’s pickled heart solves riddle of his early death|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/05/frederic-chopin-pickled-heart-solves-riddle-of-early-death|website=The Guardian|accessdate=5 November 2017|date=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other hypotheses==
[[File:Cast of Chopin's hand.JPG|thumb|upright|Cast of Chopin's left hand]]

A number of alternative hypotheses about the cause of Chopin's death flourished over the years.

The hypothesis that Chopin suffered from [[cystic fibrosis]] was first presented by O’Shea in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=O'Shea |first1=JG |title=Was Frédéric Chopin's illness actually cystic fibrosis? |journal=The Medical Journal of Australia |volume=147 |issue=11-12 |pages=586–9 |year=1987 |pmid=3320707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chopin possibly was sexually active from early adulthood, but left no descendants. Some authors considered this evidence for [[infertility]], which favoured the [[cystic fibrosis]] hypothesis.&lt;ref name="majka"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Majka |first1=L |last2=Goździk |first2=J |last3=Witt |first3=M |title=Cystic fibrosis--a probable cause of Frédéric Chopin's suffering and death |journal=Journal of applied genetics |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=77–84 |year=2003 |pmid=12590184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hypothesis of [[alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency]] was proposed by Kuzemko in 1994.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; 

[[Mitral stenosis]] was a possible, if unlikely, cause for the artist’s complaints and was discussed by Kubba and Young in 1998.&lt;ref name="kubba"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1378/chest.113.1.210 |last1=Kubba |first1=AK |last2=Young |first2=M |title=The long suffering of Frederic Chopin |journal=Chest |volume=113 |issue=1 |pages=210–6 |year=1998 |pmid=9440592}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important argument against this hypothesis is the absence of evidence that Chopin suffered from [[rheumatic fever]] in childhood, which is the most common cause of [[mitral valve stenosis]].

Kubba and Young pointed out a number of other conceivable, if unlikely, diagnoses, besides cystic fibrosis and alpha 1-antitripsin deficiency: [[eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis]], [[allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis]], [[hypogammaglobulinemia]], [[idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis]], [[lung abscess]]es, and [[pulmonary]] [[arteriovenous malformation]]s.&lt;ref name="kubba" /&gt;

==Mental health==
Chopin's biographers have often touched on the subject of depression, but the topic has rarely been broached by psychiatrists. One of the few studies of Chopin’s mental condition is a 1920 work by [[Bronislaw Onuf-Onufrowicz]]. The author cited biographers concerning Chopin's character and psyche and pointed out some symptoms that might indicate a [[manic-depressive disorder]] or [[dementia praecox]] (now termed [[schizophrenia]]), but he emphasized the absence of evidence for severe [[psychosis]] and the fact that single symptoms may only suggest a predisposition to such mental illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Bronislaw |last1=Onuf-Onufrowicz |authorlink1=Bronislaw Onuf-Onufrowicz |year=1920 |title=Frederick Chopin’s Mental Makeup |journal=Dementia Praecox Studies |volume=3 |issue=1–2 |pages=199–204 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O4tXAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8452">The '''Healthcare Services Specification Project''' (HSSP) is a standards development effort to create health industry [[service-oriented architecture]] (SOA) standards supportive of the health care market sector.  HSSP is a jointly sponsored activity operating within the [[Health Level Seven]] (HL7) and the [[Object Management Group]] (OMG) standards group.  Formally beginning as a collaboration between the HL7 Service-oriented Architecture Special Interest Group and the OMG Healthcare Domain Task Force, HSSP is developing healthcare middleware standards addressing interoperability challenges.

The activity is an effort to create common “service interface specifications” that ultimately can be tractable within a Health IT context.  The stated objective of the HSSP project is to create useful, usable healthcare standards that define the functions, semantics, and technology bindings supportive of system-level interoperability.  To the extent possible, HSSP specifications complement existing work and standards.

A key tenet to the HSSP approach is to focus on practical needs, capitalizing on open industry participation and maximizing contributions from industry talent interested in engaging.

== Context ==

By design, HSSP specifications are applicable for use in multiple use contexts, including inter-enterprise, intra-enterprise, intra-product, and intra-implementation.  In other words, nothing inherent in the standard work deliberately precludes their use in any targeted system setting.

== Mission ==

The following is the stated Mission and Charter of the HSSP project, used with permission.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''
Recognizing the need for specifications for services to support healthcare IT as part of national infrastructures (such as US NHII, Australia’s HealthConnect and Finland's Terveyshanke), Health Level Seven and the Object Management Group have forged this agreement to collaborate to the advantage of the health domain sector.  This charter outlines high-level distribution of responsibilities and separation of concerns specifically related to this services effort.  Note that this joint effort between HL7 and OMG is not exclusive.  Either organization may engage in independent efforts or similar joint efforts with others.
This project is a collaborative effort between HL7 and OMG to identify and document service specifications, functionality, and conformance supportive and relevant to healthcare IT stakeholders and resulting in real-world implementations.  

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As part of this collaborative effort:
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
HL7 and OMG shall jointly identify the service candidates for specification and prioritize and select candidate services for specification and implementation, and jointly allocate functions to services.  OMG members shall provide expertise in distributed architecture and implementation to HL7 activities to positively impact the selection of services and allocation of functions.  HL7 members shall engage in the OMG RFP process to ensure consistency with the functional requirements.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	HL7 shall elaborate the business functional needs, allocate functions to services, and develop conformance criteria for the services specified.  HL7 shall also have responsibility for providing the information modeling and content in support of these services.  All of the computationally independent work shall occur within HL7, as well as the functional conformance criteria assuring that service implementations meet their specified capability.  In general, information models and content will be managed by other HL7 domain committees, and HSSP will work with those committees to define any additions or changes.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
	OMG shall refine the HL7 developed computationally independent specifications [functional, semantics, information model, terminology, etc.] resulting in computationally dependent standards and user, vendor, and reference implementations.  OMG shall provide technical expertise such as [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) and [[Model-driven architecture]] (MDA), as well as leveraging multi-industry solutions.  OMG shall leverage the strength of its adoption process to promote rapid standards development and marketplace product support given that submitters are required to produce implementations of the standards they specify.  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As a project and through its presence in other organizations, the HSSP will provide an umbrella structure under which various subgroups will be chartered to carry out specific tasks in conjunction and under the auspices of these organizations, such as definition of methodology, architecture and specific services. The HSSP additionally will facilitate between organizations to provide the tools, knowledge, methodologies, or viewpoints deemed necessary for them to fulfill their purpose. The responsibilities of the main HSSP will be to manage the subgroups and verify their charters, as well as provide cohesive vision and any appropriate administrative tasks. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

== Philosophy ==

HSSP specification work is divided into two foundational components:  functional specifications (manifested as Service Functional Models) and technical specifications (resulting in technology adoptions).  The functional specification work is being originated within health industry standards communities, such as HL7 and CEN.  The functional models enumerate ''what'' capabilities are to be supported but not ''how'' they are supported.  The technical specification work details exactly how those functions are manifested and ultimately realized in a technology platform.

The intention behind splitting the standard into two work products is to facilitate and improve involvement from different communities, leveraging each to their strengths.  To date, HL7 has been leading in identifying standardization priorities, elaborating the functions desired into Service Functional Models, and in defining conformance criteria that would be used to assess compliance.  The OMG has been leading the technical specification process as part of their Technology Adoption Process.

The OMG process requires participants to make commitments to implement standards as working software, ensuring that the technical specifications are used and available.  During implementation of these technical specifications, errors and shortcomings of adopted Service Functional Models are captured, logged, and ultimately incorporated into subsequent versions of the Service Functional Models as part of a continuous process improvement approach.

== History ==

Prior to establishing HSSP as a moniker, the activity began informally as an informal group to discuss issues pertaining to SOA and interoperability in a health context.  Meeting concurrently with regularly scheduled HL7 Working Group meetings, HSSP operated in this form for several years until June 2005.  In June a meeting was hosted in Salt Lake City by the U.S. Veterans Health Administration to establish a formal direction for the group and to initiate steps to formalize its activities.  

In January 2006, Health Level Seven accepted the charter of the Service-oriented Architecture Special Interest Group (SOA SIG), which was to become the hosting body for HSSP within the HL7 organization.  The OMG Healthcare Domain Task Force had already agreed to sponsor the activity.   The HSSP project was formally chartered in January, 2006, operating under a board-level agreement forged between Health Level Seven and the Object Management Group.

[[File:Hospital-italiano-buenos-aires.jpg|thumbnail|[[Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires]] originally served the [[Italian Argentine]] community.]]
[[Argentina]]'s [[health care systems|health care system]] is composed of a [[universal health care]] system and a private system. The government maintains a system of public medical facilities that are universally accessible to everyone in the country, but formal sector workers are also obligated to participate in one of about 300 labor union-run health insurance schemes, which offer differing levels of coverage. Private medical facilities and health insurance also exist in the country. The Ministry of Health (MSAL), oversees all three subsectors of the health care system and is responsible for setting of regulation, evaluation and collecting statistics.

== Spending ==
In 2015, Argentina spent 8% of its GDP on health care expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/health_financing/documents/argentina_cavagnero.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=June 2013}}

== Health care ==
In January 2013, the Federal Registry of Health Establishments (Registro Federal de Establecimientos de Salud - REFES) indicated there were 5,012 health establishments operating in Argentina, including hospitals, clinics, and hospices, amongst others. The majority of the establishments (70% or 3,494 establishments) pertain to the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;Global Health Intelligence, [http://www.globalhealthintelligence.com "Global Health Intelligence"]. Retrieved 16 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social Obras===
The Social Security Sector is funded and managed by ''Obras Sociales'' (Insurance Plans), umbrella organizations for Argentine worker's unions. There are over 300 Obras Sociales in Argentina, each chapter being organized according to the occupation of the beneficiary. These organizations vary greatly in quality and effectiveness. The top 30 chapters hold 73% of the beneficiaries and 75% of resources Health Care in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-35159-201-1-DO_ThtshshOPIC.html.&lt;/ref&gt; MSAS has established a Solidarity Redistribution Fund (FSR) to try to address these beneficiary inequities. Only workers employed in the formal sector are covered under Obras Sociales insurance schemes and after [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|Argentina’s economic crisis of 2001]], the number of people covered by these fell slightly (as unemployment increased and employment in the [[informal sector]] rose). In 1999, there were 8.9 million beneficiaries covered by ''Obras Sociales''.&lt;ref name="Barrientos"&gt;Armando Barrientos "Reforming Health Insurance in Argentina and Chile" ''Health Policy and Planning'' 15(4): 420&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=June 2013}}

There is a body within the social security sector in Argentina called "The Superintendence of Health Services" ''[[La Superintendencia de Servicios de Salud]]'', which is in charge of setting the minimum coverage package that is included in the health insurance of every single health-care institution. This allows for a more transparent set of criteria for decision-making process within a sector of the Argentinean health-care system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Prior to 2000, workers did not have the freedom of choosing which ''Obra Social'' they contributed to and were covered by. This situation gave rise to some problems; e. g. a teacher living in a city where the [[gastronomy]] workers' ''Obra Social'' provided better care than the teachers union's ''Obra Social'' could not freely switch plans even when it would have been in their best interest. This was mended in the year 2000 when National Decree 446/2000 was signed into law which established changes to the regulation of ''Obras Sociales,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = texactdto446-2000|url = http://infoleg.mecon.gov.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/60000-64999/63228/texact.htm|website = infoleg.mecon.gov.ar|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for workers to choose freely between ''Obras Sociales'' administered by different workers unions (although they are still obligated to adhere to one of the ''Obras'' and make regular payments).

===Private sector===
The private health care sector in Argentina is characterized by great heterogeneity and is made up of a great number of fragmented entities and small networks; it consists of over 200 organizations and covers approximately 2 million Argentines.&lt;ref name ="idrc"&gt;IDRC ''Reshaping Health Care in Latin America''http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/Pages/IDRCBookDetails.aspx?PublicationID=265.&lt;/ref&gt; Private insurance often overlaps with other forms of health care coverage, making it difficult to estimate the degree to which beneficiaries are dependent on the public and private sectors. According to a 2000 report by the IRBC, foreign [[Competition (economics)|competition]] has increased in Argentina’s private sector, with [[Switzerland|Swiss]], American and other [[Latin America]]n [[health care provider]]s entering the [[Market (economics)|market]] in recent years. This has been accompanied by little formal regulation.&lt;ref name ="idrc"/&gt;

===Public system===
A system of public medical facilities is maintained by the government. The public system is highly decentralized, as it is administered at the provincial level; often [[primary care]] will be regulated autonomously by each city. Since 2001, the number of Argentines relying on public services has seen an increase. According to 2000 figures, 37.4% of Argentines had no health insurance, 48.8% were covered by ''Obras Sociales'', 8.6% had private insurance plans, and 3.8% were covered by both ''Obras Sociales'' and private insurance schemes. Currently, about half of the population uses the public system.&lt;ref name=angloinfo&gt;https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/argentina/healthcare/health-system/health-insurance&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barrientos"/&gt;

== Health Policies ==
Patients need to apply for free care at public institutions and undergo a lengthy test in which they may be rejected at some hospitals. The rejection rate is usually 30-40%.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iriart, Merhy and Waitzkin|first=Celia, Emerson and Howard|date=2001|title=Managed care in Latin America: the new common sense in healthy policy reform|url=|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=52|pages=1243-1253|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public hospitals in Argentina who have not converted to managed care principles are facing an influx of patients covered by privatized social security funds. Public hospitals in the city of Buenos Aires reported about 1.25 million outpatient visits by patients covered by the privately administered social security fund for retired person.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Provincial and Municipal Health Secretariats and Social works through the Superintendence of Health Services are in charge of allocation of resources and setting priorities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iglesias et al.|first=Cynthia|date=2005|title=Health-care decision-making Processes in Latin America: Problems and prospects for the use of economic evaluation|url=|journal=International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care|volume=21|pages=1-14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Health through its Sub-secretariat of Promotion and Prevention are in charge of Public Health Interventions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Local Health Secretariats in the provinces and municipalities through the department of purchases in the public sub-sector and individual social works are in charge of the reimbursement of new drugs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Elderly people face barriers due to copayments, private practitioners' refusal to see them and also because of nonpayment by the social security fund.

{{About|biological waste products of the human body|other kinds of waste produced by humans|waste}}

{{Refimprove|date=February 2013}}
'''Human waste''' (or '''human excreta''') refers to the waste products of the [[human digestive system]] and the human [[metabolism]], namely [[feces]] and [[urine]]. As part of a [[sanitation]] system that is in place, human waste is collected, transported, treated and disposed of or reused by one method or another, depending on the type of [[toilets|toilet]] being used, ability by the users to pay for services and other factors. 

The sanitation systems in place differ vastly across the world, with many people in [[Developing country|developing countries]] having to resort to [[open defecation]] where human waste is deposited in the environment, for lack of other options. People in [[Developed country|developed countries]] tend to use [[Flush toilet|flush toilets]] where the human waste is mixed with water and  transported to [[sewage treatment plants]]. 

Children's excreta can be disposed of in [[diaper]]s and mixed with [[municipal solid waste]]. Diapers are also sometimes dumped directly into the environment, leading to [[public health]] risks.

==Terminology==
The term "human waste" is used in the general media to mean several things, such as [[sewage]], [[sewage sludge]], [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] - in fact anything that may contain some [[human feces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Waste May Be Flush With Gold, Silver, And Other Valuable Metals|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/25/poop-gold-human-waste-metals_n_6936262.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=8 June 2015|date=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the stricter sense of the term, human waste is in fact human excreta, i.e. [[urine]] and [[human feces|feces]], with or without water being mixed in. For example, [[dry toilet|dry toilets]] collect human waste without the addition of water.

==Health aspects==
Human waste is considered a [[Biomedical waste|biowaste]], as it is a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] for both [[Virus disease|viral]] and [[Pathogenic bacteria|bacterial]] diseases.  It can be a serious health hazard if it gets into sources of drinking water.  The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) reports that nearly 2.2 million people die annually from diseases caused by contaminated water.  A major accomplishment of human civilization has been the reduction of [[Transmission_(medicine)|disease transmission]] via human waste through the practice of [[hygiene]] and [[sanitation]], which can employ a variety of different technologies.

== Environmental aspects ==
Even high-mountains are not free from human waste. Each year, millions of mountaineers visit high-mountain areas. They generate tonnes of feces and urine annually which cause environmental pollution. The authorities of mountain regions, especially in the [[Global South]] countries do not pay enough attention to the problem of excreta from mountaineers. Human feces pose a greater threat to the mountain environment than uncontrolled deposit of urine, due to the higher pathogen content of feces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Apollo|first=Michal|date=2017-01-02|title=The good, the bad and the ugly – three approaches to management of human waste in a high-mountain environment|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207233.2016.1227225|journal=International Journal of Environmental Studies|volume=74|issue=1|pages=129–158|doi=10.1080/00207233.2016.1227225|issn=0020-7233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of processing==

Methods of processing depend on the type of human waste: 
* Sewage is treated via [[sewage treatment]] 
* Sewage sludge is treated by [[sewage sludge treatment]] 
* Fecal matter from [[dry toilet|dry toilets]] may undergo [[composting]]
* Fecal sludge from pit latrines is treated and managed with an approach called [[fecal sludge management]]
The amount of water mixed with human waste can be reduced by the use of waterless [[urinal (restroom)|urinal]]s and [[composting toilet]]s and by recycling [[greywater]]. The most common method of human waste treatment in rural areas where municipal sewage systems are unavailable is the use of [[septic tank]] systems. In remote rural places without sewage or septic systems, small populations allow for the continued use of [[Bucket toilet|honey bucket]]s and sewage lagoons (see [[anaerobic lagoon]]) without the threat of disease presented by places with denser populations. [[Bucket toilet|Bucket toilets]] are used by rural villages in [[Alaska]] where, due to [[permafrost]], conventional waste treatment systems cannot be utilized.

==Uses==
{{Main|Reuse of excreta}}
Human waste in the form of wastewater (sewage) is used to irrigate and fertilize fields in many parts of the developing world where fresh water is unavailable. There is great potential for wastewater agriculture to produce more food for consumers in urban areas, as long as there is sufficient education about the dangers of eating such food uncooked.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/08/080821-human-waste.html Human Waste Used by 200 Million Farmers, Study Says]'', National Geographic News, August 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hypogammaglobulinemia''' is a problem with the immune system in which not enough [[gamma globulin]]s are produced in the blood (thus ''[[wikt:hypo-#Prefix_2|hypo-]]'' + ''gamma'' + ''[[globulin]]'' + ''[[wikt:-aemia#Suffix|-emia]]''). This results in a lower antibody count, which impairs the [[immune system]], increasing risk of infection. Hypogammaglobulinemia may result from a variety of primary genetic immune system defects, such as [[common variable immunodeficiency]],&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|four/000052585|common variable immunodeficiency}}&lt;/ref&gt; or it may be caused by secondary effects such as medication, blood cancer, or poor nutrition, or  loss of gamma globulins in urine, as in nonselective glomerular proteinuria. &lt;ref name="seven"&gt;Watson, Stephanie “Hypogammaglobulinemia.” Healthline, 20 Feb. 2018, https://www.healthline.com/health/hypogammaglobulinemia.&lt;/ref&gt;  Patients with hypogammaglobulinemia have reduced immune function; important considerations include avoiding use of live vaccines, and take precautionary measures when traveling to regions with endemic disease or poor sanitation such as receiving immunizations, taking antibiotics abroad, drinking only safe or boiled water, arranging appropriate medical cover in advance of travel, and ensuring continuation of any immunoglobulin infusions needed. &lt;ref name="eight"&gt;"Hypogammaglobulinemia." (2018). Retrieved from https://online.epocrates.com/diseases/105851/Hypogammaglobulinemia/Prognosis&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
The presenting feature of hypogammaglobulinemia is usually a clinical history of recurrent, chronic, or atypical infections.  These infections include but are not limited to: bronchitis, ear infections, meningitis, pneumonia, sinus infections, and skin infections.  Such infections can potentially damage organs, leading to severe complications.  Other symptoms pf hypogammaglobulinemia include chronic diarrhea and complications from receiving live vaccines.  Certain symptoms of chronic damage may be related to recurrent infection.  For example, shortness of breath, chronic cough, and sputum production may indicate the presence of [[bronchiectasis]].  Sinus pain, nasal discharge, and postnasal drip may indicate the presence of chronic sinusitis.  Diarrhea and steatorrhea may indicate malabsorption. &lt;ref name="eight" /&gt;

Babies with transient hypogammaglobulinemia (THI) usually become symptomatic 6 to 12 months after birth, with the symptoms usually consisting of frequent ear, sinus, and lung infections.  Other symptoms include respiratory tract infections, food allergies, eczema, urinary tract infections, and intestinal infections. &lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;

Hypogammaglobulinemia can be caused by either a primary or secondary immunodeficiency.  Primary immunodeficiencies are caused by a mutation or series of mutations to the genome. &lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;  For example, a study from 2012 found that a compound heterozygous deleterious mutation in the CD21 gene is associated with hypogammaglobulinemia.  Genetic analysis revealed the patient was heterozygous for CD21, with the paternally inherited allele (also shared with one sister) having a disrupted splicing donor site at exon 6, while the maternally inherited allele had a mutation resulting in a premature stop codon in exon 13.  Neither mutation was found in 100 healthy control subjects, showing the rarity of the mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2011.09.027 |pmid=22035880 |title=Genetic CD21 deficiency is associated with hypogammaglobulinemia |journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=801–810.e6 |year=2012 |last1=Thiel |first1=Jens |last2=Kimmig |first2=Lucas |last3=Salzer |first3=Ulrich |last4=Grudzien |first4=Magdalena |last5=Lebrecht |first5=Dirk |last6=Hagena |first6=Tina |last7=Draeger |first7=Ruth |last8=Völxen |first8=Nadine |last9=Bergbreiter |first9=Astrid |last10=Jennings |first10=Stephanie |last11=Gutenberger |first11=Sylvia |last12=Aichem |first12=Annette |last13=Illges |first13=Harald |last14=Hannan |first14=Jonathan P. |last15=Kienzler |first15=Anne-Kathrin |last16=Rizzi |first16=Marta |last17=Eibel |first17=Hermann |last18=Peter |first18=Hans-Hartmut |last19=Warnatz |first19=Klaus |last20=Grimbacher |first20=Bodo |last21=Rump |first21=Jörg-Andres |last22=Schlesier |first22=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 300 different genes in total have been identified which account for different forms of primary immunodeficiency (PID).  These different forms can affect different parts of the immune system, including immunoglobulin production.  Primary immunodeficiencies usually have a delay of several years between initial clinical presentation and diagnosis.  Some primary immune deficiencies include ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), autosomal recessive agammaglobulinemia (ARA), common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), hyper-IgM syndromes, IgG subclass deficiency, isolated non-IgG immunoglobulin deficiencies, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), specific antibody deficiency (SAD), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, or x-linked agammaglobulinemia.  CVID is the most common form of primary immunodeficiency.  SCID is considered a medical emergency and suspected cases require immediate specialist center referral for diagnosis and treatment.  It is more often that hypogammaglobulinemia develops as a result of another condition, which are called secondary or acquired immune deficiencies.  These include blood cancers such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), lymphoma, or myeloma, HIV, nephrotic syndrome, poor nutrition, protein-losing enteropathy, getting an organ transplant, or radiation therapy.  This also includes medications which can cause hypogammaglobulinemia such as corticosteroids, chemotherapy drugs, or antiseizure medication.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;      
 
==Treatment and Prevention==
Protocols for different forms of primary immunodeficiency vary significantly.  The aim of treatments implemented by specialist centers is usually to reduce the risk of complications.  One method of treatment is by parenteral administration of gamma globulins, either monthly intravenously,subcutaneously, or more recently, by weekly self-administered hypodermoclysis. In either case, mild allergic reactions are common, and are usually manageable with oral diphenhydramine.  Evidence comparing immunoglobulin replacement with no treatment is limited, and guidelines for treatment are therefore mainly derived from observational studies.  Antibiotics are also frequently used as treatment.  Other standard forms of treatment include a form of enzyme replacement therapy called PEG-ADA,  and antibiotic treatment given for the prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt;   

One emerging therapy is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which has been considered standard treatment for many combined primary immunodeficiencies including SCID, CD40 deficiency, CD40 ligand deficiency, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, but has been extended to secondary immunodeficiencies over the last two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/fimmu.2014.00626 |pmid=25538710 |pmc=4259107 |title=Immunoglobulin Replacement Therapy in Secondary Hypogammaglobulinemia |journal=Frontiers in Immunology |volume=5 |pages=626 |year=2014 |last1=Compagno |first1=Nicolã² |last2=Malipiero |first2=Giacomo |last3=Cinetto |first3=Francesco |last4=Agostini |first4=Carlo }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another emerging therapy is gene therapy, which has been used to treat X-linked SCID, SCID due to adenosine deaminase deficiency, and chronic granulomatous disease.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt;      

Screening of immunoglobulin levels in relatives of CVID and IgA patients finds a familial inheritance rate of 10% to 20%.  In cases where a carrier of such a mutation would like to have children, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) has been offered. &lt;ref name="eight" /&gt;  PGD is defined as the testing of pre-implantation stage embryos or oocytes for genetic defects.  It requires in vitro fertilization, embryo biopsy, and either fluorescent in situ hybridization or polymerase chain reaction on a singular cell, making it a complex procedure.  While some question the ethicality of such artificial selection, it is generally seen as an important alternative to pre-natal diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1399-0004.2009.01273.x |pmid=19793305 |title=Preimplantation genetic diagnosis |journal=Clinical Genetics |volume=76 |issue=4 |pages=315–325 |year=2009 |last1=Geraedts |first1=JPM |last2=De Wert |first2=Gmwr }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prevention of secondary immunodeficiency involves monitoring patients carefully with high risk of developing hypogammaglobulinemia.  This entails measuring immunoglobulin levels in patients with hematologic malignancy, or those receiving chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy such as rituximab.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt;

==Effect on Viral Evolution==
One study of the genomic variation in the Hepatitis C virus in patients with and without hypogammaglobulinemia found that patients with hypogammaglobulinemia had fewer nucleotide substitutions per year than the control patients, suggesting that in the absence of selective pressure caused by the immune system, the frequency of the occurrence of genetic variation in the major viral species is reduced.  They used five control patients and four patients with CVID, a particularly severe form of hypogammaglobulinemia.  The control patients had a mean nucleotide rate-of-change of 6.954 nucleotide substitutions per year while the patients with CVID had 0.415 nucleotide substitutions per year.  While the mutations still occur in the patients with CVID, they tend to remain as a minor species in the absence of immune selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/hep.510270134 |pmid=9425941 |title=Comparison of the rate of sequence variation in the hypervariable region of E2/NS1 region of hepatitis C virus in normal and hypogammaglobulinemic patients |journal=Hepatology |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=223–227 |year=1998 |last1=Booth |first1=Jonathan C. |last2=Kumar |first2=Umesh |last3=Webster |first3=David |last4=Monjardino |first4=John |last5=Thomas |first5=Howard C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Somatic Cell Evolution and Primary Immunodeficiency==
In 2015, a journal article by McDermott et. al reported on a case in which chromothripsis, normally a catastrophic event in which chromosomes undergo massive deletion and rearrangement within a single stem cell’s DNA, cured a patient with WHIM syndrome, a primary immunodeficiency disease.  WHIM is autosomal dominant and is caused by a gain-of-function mutation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4.  The mutation in CXCR4 increases signaling because it disrupts negative regulatory elements usually present, creating exaggerated functions of the receptor.  The term “WHIM” is an acronym for the main manifestations of the disease: warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent infections, and [[myelokathexis]].  Myelokathexis is impaired escape of mature neutrophils from bone marrow, causing neutropenia.  Patients with WHIM syndrome have severely reduced peripheral blood B cells and some reduction in peripheral blood T cells and monocytes. (McDermott).  The cured patient, designated WHIM-09, is a white female presented at age 58.  She also presented with her two daughters, WHIM-10 (age 21) and WHIM-11 (age 23).  Both daughters fulfilled all of the clinical criteria for WHIM syndrome, while WHIM-09 did not.  She reported that she had had many serious infections from childhood until age 38 but had had none in the past 20 years.  She has fulfilled none of the criteria for WHIM syndrome except for mild hypogammaglobulinemia since then.  WHIM-09 was the first patient ever described with myelokathexis, the “M” in WHIM syndrome, and her parents and siblings showed no sign of the syndrome.  Therefore, the evidence is compatible with a WHIM mutation occurring de novo in patient WHIM-09, an autosomal dominant transition to two of her three daughters, and a spontaneous and complete remission in WHIM-09.  This provides the first evidence that chromothripsis may result in clinical benefit, in particular, the cure of a genetic disease.  If a cell with chromothripsis dies, it is clinically undetectable, making the true frequency of its occurrence hard to determine.  Therefore, it is only detected if it acquires a strong selective advantage creating a clinically apparent clonal population harboring the same pattern of deletions and arrangements.  This results in either cancer, or if the location is fortuitous, the cure of a genetic condition as occurred in patient WHIM-09.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2015.01.014 |pmid=25662009 |pmc=4329071 |title=Chromothriptic Cure of WHIM Syndrome |journal=Cell |volume=160 |issue=4 |pages=686–699 |year=2015 |last1=McDermott |first1=David H. |last2=Gao |first2=Ji-Liang |last3=Liu |first3=Qian |last4=Siwicki |first4=Marie |last5=Martens |first5=Craig |last6=Jacobs |first6=Paejonette |last7=Velez |first7=Daniel |last8=Yim |first8=Erin |last9=Bryke |first9=Christine R. |last10=Hsu |first10=Nancy |last11=Dai |first11=Zunyan |last12=Marquesen |first12=Martha M. |last13=Stregevsky |first13=Elina |last14=Kwatemaa |first14=Nana |last15=Theobald |first15=Narda |last16=Long Priel |first16=Debra A. |last17=Pittaluga |first17=Stefania |last18=Raffeld |first18=Mark A. |last19=Calvo |first19=Katherine R. |last20=Maric |first20=Irina |last21=Desmond |first21=Ronan |last22=Holmes |first22=Kevin L. |last23=Kuhns |first23=Douglas B. |last24=Balabanian |first24=Karl |last25=Bachelerie |first25=Françoise |last26=Porcella |first26=Stephen F. |last27=Malech |first27=Harry L. |last28=Murphy |first28=Philip M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Etymology==
"Hypogammaglobulinemia" is largely synonymous with "agammaglobulinemia". When the latter term is used (as in "[[X-linked agammaglobulinemia]]") it implies that gamma globulins are not merely reduced, but completely absent. Modern assays have allowed most agammaglobulinemias to be more precisely defined as hypogammaglobulinemias,&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|one/000002160|agammaglobulinemia}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the distinction is not usually clinically relevant.

"Hypogammaglobulinemia" is distinguished from [[dysgammaglobulinemia]], which is a reduction in some types of [[gamma globulin]]s, but not others.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|three/000033050|Dysgammaglobulinemia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
Early detection and treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia is known to reduce rates of morbidity and the chance of long-term pulmonary complications. Evidence shows that there is an association between achieving higher IgG levels and reduced infection frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1567-5769(03)00134-6 |title=Comparison of the efficacy of IGIV-C, 10% (caprylate/chromatography) and IGIV-SD, 10% as replacement therapy in primary immune deficiency |journal=International Immunopharmacology |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=1325–1333 |year=2003 |last1=Roifman |first1=Chaim M. |last2=Schroeder |first2=Harry |last3=Berger |first3=Melvin |last4=Sorensen |first4=Ricardo |last5=Ballow |first5=Mark |last6=Buckley |first6=Rebecca H. |last7=Gewurz |first7=Anita |last8=Korenblat |first8=Phillip |last9=Sussman |first9=Gordon |last10=Lemm |first10=Georg }}&lt;/ref&gt; If hypogammaglobulinemia remains undetected and untreated, outcomes are generally poor, especially if chronic lung damage or bronchiectasis has occurred. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of hypogammaglobulinemia is often significantly delayed.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt;

[[Social epidemiology]] focuses on the patterns in morbidity and mortality rates that emerge as a result of social characteristics. While an individual's lifestyle choices or family history may place him or her at an increased risk for developing certain illnesses, there are social inequalities in health that cannot be explained by individual factors.&lt;ref name="Freund_1999" /&gt; Variations in health outcomes in the United States are attributed to several social characteristics, such as [[gender]], [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|race]], [[socioeconomic status]], [[Neighborhoods|the environment]], and [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]]. Inequalities in any or all of these social categories can contribute to health disparities, with some groups placed at an increased risk for acquiring chronic diseases than others.

For example, [[cardiovascular disease]] is the leading cause of death in the United States, followed closely by [[cancer]], with the fifth most deadly being [[diabetes]]. The general [[risk factors]] associated with these diseases include [[obesity]] and poor [[nutrition|diet]], [[tobacco]] and [[alcohol]] use, [[physical inactivity]], and access to medical care and health information.&lt;ref name=women&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4786|title= Women, heart disease and stroke|access-date= April 7, 2008|publisher=American Heart Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it may seem that many these risk factors arise solely from individual health choices, such a view neglects the structural patterns in the choices that individuals make. Consequently, a person's likelihood for developing heart disease, cancer, or diabetes is in part correlated with social factors. Among all racial groups, individuals who are [[poverty|impoverished]] or [[low income]], have lower levels of educational attainment, and/or live in lower-income neighborhoods are all more likely to develop chronic diseases, such as heart disease,&lt;ref name="cort"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://clearinghouse.missouriwestern.edu/manuscripts/175.asp | title  =Heart disease: the hidden killer of rural black women | last1 = Cort | first1 = Natalie A. | last2 = Stewart-Fahs | first2 = Pamela | access-date = April 5, 2008 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; cancer,&lt;ref name=hispanics&gt;{{cite web | url  = http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/CAFF2006HispPWSecured.pdf | title = Cancer facts &amp; figures for Hispanics 2006-2008|access-date=April 13, 2008|publisher= American Cancer Society, Inc.|year=2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080602161653/http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/CAFF2006HispPWSecured.pdf | archive-date = June 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and diabetes.&lt;ref name=cort /&gt;&lt;ref name=social&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://www.wsws.org/articles/2006/jan2006/diab-j30.shtml | title = Diabetes in the US: a social epidemic | access-date = April 13, 2008| last = Daniels | first = Peter | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2006-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender ==
{{main|Gender disparities in health}}

In the United States and Europe, up until the 19th century, women tended to die at an earlier age than men. This was largely due to the risks involved in [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]]. However, in the late 19th century there was a shift in life expectancy and women started to live longer than men. Notably, this is partly explained by biological factors. For instance, there is a cross-cultural trend that male fetal mortality rates are higher than female fetal mortality rates.&lt;ref name = "Freund_1999"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Freund | first1 = Peter | last2 = McGuire | first2 = Meredith | name-list-format = vanc | title = Health, illness, and the social body: a critical sociology | date = 1999 | publisher = Prentice-Hall | location = Upper Saddle River, N.J. | isbn = 978-0-13-897075-8 | edition = 3rd }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, estrogen decreases the risk of females acquiring heart disease by lowering the amount of cholesterol in the blood, while testosterone suppresses the immune system in males and puts them at risk for acquiring serious illnesses. However, biological differences do not fully account for the large gender gap in the health outcomes of men and women. Social factors play a large role in gender disparities in health.&lt;ref name = "Read_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Read | first1 = Jen'nan Ghazal | last2 = Gorman | first2 = Bridget K. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Gender and Health Inequality | journal = Annual Review of Sociology | date = June 2010 | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 371–386 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102535 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main factors that contributes to the decreased life expectancy of males is their propensity to engage in risk-taking behaviors. Some commonly cited examples include heavy drinking, illicit drug use, violence, drunk driving, not wearing helmets, and smoking.&lt;ref name="Read_2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Freund_1999" /&gt; These behaviors contribute to injuries that may lead to premature death in males. In particular, the effect of risk-taking behavior on health is especially visible in the case of smoking. As smoking rates have fallen in the United States overall, less men engage in this behavior and the life expectancy gap between men and women has slightly decreased as a result.&lt;ref name="Read_2010" /&gt;

The behaviors of men and women also vary in regards to diet and exercise, leading to differential health outcomes . On average, men exercise more than women, but their diet is less nutritious. Consequently, men are more likely to be overweight, while women are at greater risk for obesity.&lt;ref name="Read_2010" /&gt; Exposure to violence is another social factor that has an influence on health. In general, women have a higher likelihood of experiencing sexual and intimate partner violence, while men are twice as likely to die from suicide or homicide.&lt;ref name="Read_2010" /&gt;

Markedly, the impact of gender on health becomes especially salient in different socioeconomic contexts. In the United States, there is a large economic gender inequality with many economically disadvantaged women occupying much fewer positions of power than men. According to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, "among adults with the strongest attachment to the labor force, only 9.6% of women earned more than $50,000 annually, compared with 44.5% of men." &lt;ref name="Read_2010" /&gt; This gendered economic inequality is partly responsible for the gender-health paradox: the general trend that women live longer than men, but experience a greater degree of non-life-threatening chronic illnesses over the course of a lifetime.&lt;ref name="Erving_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Erving CL | title = Gender and physical health: a study of African American and Caribbean black adults | journal = Journal of Health and Social Behavior | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 383–99 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21896688 | doi = 10.1177/0022146511415857 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A low socioeconomic status in women contributes to feelings of a lack of personal control over the events in their lives, increased stress, and low self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Read_2010" /&gt; Perpetual states of stress inflict damage on the bodies and minds of women, placing them at risk for physical ailments, such as heart disease and arthritis, as well mental health disorders, such as depression.&lt;ref name="Read_2010" /&gt;

Another significant social factor is that men and women deal with their illnesses in different ways. Women generally have strong support networks and are able to rely on others for emotional support, with the potential to improve their states of health. In contrast, men are less likely to have strong support networks, they have fewer doctor visits, and often cope with their illnesses on their own.&lt;ref name="Read_2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Freund_1999" /&gt; Also, men and women express pain in different ways. Researchers have observed that women openly express feelings of pain, while men are more reserved in this regard and prefer to appear tough even when they experience severe mental or physical suffering.&lt;ref name="Read_2010" /&gt; This finding suggests that this is due to [[socialization]] processes. Women are taught to be submissive and emotional, while men are taught to be strong, powerful figures that do not show their emotions. The social stigma associated with expressions of pain prevents men from admitting their suffering to others, making it more difficult to overcome the pain.&lt;ref name="Read_2010" /&gt;

Moreover, [[Neighbourhood effect|neighborhood effects]] have a greater influence on women than men. For instance, research findings suggest that women living in impoverished neighborhoods are more likely to experience obesity, while this effect is not as strong for men.&lt;ref name="Read_2010" /&gt; The physical environment also generally impacts a woman's self-rated health. This effect can be explained by the fact that women spend more time at home than their male counterparts, as a result of higher unemployment rates, and therefore may be more exposed to negative environmental characteristics that take a toll on their health.&lt;ref name="Read_2010" /&gt;

Finally, gender effects also vary with race, ethnicity, and nativity status. Notably, Christy Erving conducted a study in which she examined the gender differences in the health profiles of African Americans and Caribbean blacks (immigrants and U.S. born). One of the findings from this research is that on average, African American women report lower self-rated measures of health, worse physical health, and were more likely to experience severe chronic illnesses than men. This finding contradicts the gender-health paradox in the sense that researchers would expect morbidity rates to be higher for women, but less of the illnesses that they acquire should be debilitating.&lt;ref name="Erving_2011" /&gt; In contrast, the opposite trend is observed for U.S. born Caribbean blacks, with men more likely to experience chronic, life-threatening illnesses than women.&lt;ref name="Erving_2011" /&gt; The health outcomes of Caribbean black immigrants are somewhere in-between the health outcomes of U.S. born Caribbean blacks and African Americans, wherein the females have a lower value of self-reported health but experience equal rates of life-threatening, chronic disease as men.&lt;ref name="Erving_2011" /&gt; This data illustrates that even within one racial category, there can be stark gender differences in health on the basis of social differences within the groups that compose the race.

== Race ==
Studies have shown that individuals that are racially and ethnically stigmatized, not just in the U.S., but globally as well, experience health issues such as mental and physical illness, and in some cases even death, in higher rates than the average individual.&lt;ref name="Williams_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams DR, Priest N, Anderson NB | title = Understanding associations among race, socioeconomic status, and health: Patterns and prospects | journal = Health Psychology | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 407–11 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27018733 | pmc = 4817358 | doi = 10.1037/hea0000242 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some controversy around "race" being a determinant of disease and health issues, since there are unmeasured forms of background history that are potential factors in this research. Geographical origins and the types of environments individual races were exposed to are huge contributes to the health of a certain race, especially when the environment that they are in now is not the same as the one their race originates from geographically.

Along with these factors, physical, psychological, social, and chemical environments are all included and accounted for. Including exposure over the course of one's life and through generations,and biological adaptation to these environmental exposures, including gene expression.&lt;ref name="Williams_2016" /&gt; An example of this is a study of hypertension between black people and whites. West Africans and people of West African descent levels of hypertension increased when they moved from Africa to the United States. Their levels of hypertension were twice as high as the levels of black people that were in Africa.&lt;ref name="Williams_2016" /&gt; While whites in the United States even had higher rates of hypertension than Black people in Africa, the black people in the United States rates of hypertension were higher than some predominately white populations in Europe.&lt;ref name="Williams_2016" /&gt; Again, this proves that when a race is taken out of their original geographic environment, they are more prone to disease and illness, because their genetic make-up was made for a specific type of environment.

Transitioning from the environmental aspect of race and disease, there is a direct correlation between race and socioeconomic status which contributes to [[racial disparities in health]]. When it comes to death rates from heart disease, the rate is about twice as high for black men vs. white men. Now, death rates from heart disease are lower for both black and white women compared to their male counterparts, but the patterns of racial disparities and education disparities for women are similar to that of the men. Death from heart disease is about three times as higher for black women than white women. For both black men and women, racial differences in deaths from heart disease at every level of education is evident, with the racial gap being larger at the higher levels of education than at the lowest levels.&lt;ref name="Williams_2016" /&gt; There are a number of reasons why race matters in terms of health after socioeconomic status has been accounted for. For one, health is affected by adversity early on in one's life, such as traumatic stress, poverty, and abuse. These factors affect the physical and mental health of an individual. As we know, most of the people living in poverty in the United States are minorities, specifically African Americans, so unfortunately there is no surprise that they are the individuals with so many health issues.&lt;ref name="Williams_2016" /&gt;

Continuously, race is relevant to health issues, because of the non-equivalence of socioeconomic status indicators across racial groups. At the same level of education, minorities (black people and non-white Hispanic people) receive less income than their Anglo-white counterparts, as well as have less wealth and purchasing power.&lt;ref name="Williams_2016" /&gt; Namely, one of the biggest reasons that race matters in terms of health is due to racism. Both personal and institutionalized racism are very prominent in today's society, maybe not as blunt and easy to notice in comparison to the past, but it still exists. Certain residential segregation by race, such as redlining, has created very distinct racial differences in terms of education, employment, and opportunities. Opportunities such as access to good healthcare/medical care.&lt;ref name="Williams_2016" /&gt; Institutional and cultural racism can even harm minorities health through stereotypes and prejudices, which contributes to socioeconomic mobility and can reduce and limit resources and opportunities required for a healthy lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Williams_2016" /&gt;

Socioeconomic status is only one part of racial disparities in health that reflect larger social inequalities in society. Racism is a system that combines with, and sometimes changes, socioeconomic status to influence health, and race still matters for health when socioeconomic status is considered.

== Socioeconomic status ==
Socioeconomic status is a multidimensional classification, often defined using an individual's income and level of education.&lt;ref&gt;Pfeffer, Fabian. "Occupations." Lecture, University of Michigan, January 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Other related metrics can round out this definition; for example, in a 2006 study by authors Cox, McKevitt, Rudd and Wolfe, further categories included "occupation, home and goods ownership, and area-based deprivation indices"&lt;ref name="Cox_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cox AM, McKevitt C, Rudd AG, Wolfe CD | title = Socioeconomic status and stroke | journal = The Lancet. Neurology | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 181–8 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16426994 | doi = 10.1016/S1474-4422(06)70351-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in their determination of status.

Income inequality has risen rapidly in the United States, pushing greater amounts of the population into positions of lower socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;Pfeffer, Fabian. "Wealth Inequality." Lecture, University of Michigan, January 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} A study published in 1993 examined Americans who had passed away between May and August 1960, and paired the mortality information with income, education and occupation data for each person.&lt;ref name="Pappas_1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pappas G, Queen S, Hadden W, Fisher G | title = The increasing disparity in mortality between socioeconomic groups in the United States, 1960 and 1986 | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 329 | issue = 2 | pages = 103–9 | date = July 1993 | pmid = 8510686 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199307083290207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work found an inverse correlation between socioeconomic status and mortality rate, as well as an increasing strength of this pattern and its reflection of the growth of income inequality in the United States.&lt;ref name="Pappas_1993" /&gt;

These findings, although concerned with total mortality of any cause, reflect a similar relationship between socioeconomic status and disease incidence or death in the United States. Disease composes a very significant portion of U.S. mortality; as of May 2017, 6 out of 7 of the leading causes of death in America are non-communicable diseases, including heart disease, cancer, lower respiratory diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases (stroke).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Indeed, these diseases have been seen to disproportionately affect the socioeconomically disadvantaged, albeit to different degrees and with differing magnitude.&lt;ref name="Massing_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Massing MW, Rosamond WD, Wing SB, Suchindran CM, Kaplan BH, Tyroler HA | title = Income, income inequality, and cardiovascular disease mortality: relations among county populations of the United States, 1985 to 1994 | journal = Southern Medical Journal | volume = 97 | issue = 5 | pages = 475–84 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15180024 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortality rates associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, were assessed for individuals across areas of differing income and income inequality.&lt;ref name="Massing_2004" /&gt; The authors found that the mortality rates for each of the three respective diseases were greater by a factor of 1.36, 1.26, and 1.60, in areas of higher inequality compared to lower inequality areas of similar income.&lt;ref name="Massing_2004" /&gt; Across areas of differing income and constant income inequality, the rate of death due to CVD, CHD and stroke was increased by a factor of 1.27, 1.15, and 1.33 in the lower income areas.&lt;ref name="Massing_2004" /&gt; These trends across two measures of variation in socioeconomic status reflect the complexity and depth of the relationship between disease and economic standing. The authors are careful to state that while these patterns exist, they are not sufficiently described as related by cause and effect. While correlating, health and status have arisen in the U.S. from interrelated forces that may intricately accumulate or negate one another due to specific historical contexts.&lt;ref name="Massing_2004" /&gt;

As this lack of cause and effect simplicity indicates, exactly where disease-related health inequality arises is murky, and multiple factors likely contribute. Important to an examination of disease and health in the context of a complicated classification like socioeconomic status is the degree to which these measures are tied up with mechanisms that are dependent upon the individual, and those that are regionally variant.&lt;ref name="Cox_2006" /&gt; In the aforementioned 2006 study, the authors define individualized factors within three categories, "material (eg, income, possessions, environment), behavioural (eg, diet, smoking, exercise) and psychosocial (eg, perceived inequality, stress)",&lt;ref name="Cox_2006" /&gt; and provide two categories for external, regionally varying factors, "environmental influences (such as provision of and access to services) and psychosocial influences (such as social support)."&lt;ref name="Cox_2006" /&gt; The interactive and compounding nature of these forces can shape and be shaped by socioeconomic status, presenting a challenge to researchers to tease apart the intersecting factors of health and status. In the 2006 study, authors examined the specific drivers of the correlation between stroke occurrence and socioeconomic status. Identifying more nuanced and interlocking factors, they cited risk behaviors, early life influences, and access to care as tied to socioeconomic status and thus health inequality.&lt;ref name="Cox_2006" /&gt;

Inequality in disease is intricately tangled up with stratification of social class and economic status in the United States. Correlations, often disease-dependent,&lt;ref name="Massing_2004" /&gt; between health and socioeconomic attainment have been demonstrated in numerous studies for numerous diseases.&lt;ref name="Pappas_1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox_2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Massing_2004" /&gt; The causes of these correlations are interlocking and often related to factors varying between regions and individuals, and design of future studies concerning inequality in disease require careful thought to the multifaceted driving mechanisms of social inequality.

== Environment ==
The neighborhoods and areas people live in, as well as their occupation, make up the environment in which they exist. People living in poverty stricken neighborhoods are at a greater risk for heart disease, possibly because the supermarkets in their area do not sell healthy foods and there is increased availability of stores selling alcohol and tobacco than in more affluent parts of town.&lt;ref name=cort /&gt;{{Clarify|date=January 2012|reason=Umm... people who live in more affluent sections are perfectly able to get alcohol and tobacco - they also have better transportation! And alcohol isn't always a bad thing...}} People living in rural areas are also more susceptible to heart disease, as well. An agriculturally based diet rich in fat and cholesterol, combined with an isolated environment in which there is limited access to health care and ways to distribute information probably creates a pattern in which people living in rural environments have higher levels of heart disease.&lt;ref name=cort /&gt; Occupational cancer is one way in which the environment one works in can increase their rate of disease. Employees exposed to smoke, asbestos, diesel fumes, paint, and chemicals in factories can develop cancer from their workplace.&lt;ref name=occupation&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/occupational-exposures-and-cancer?cat=healthM |title= Occupation exposures and cancer|access-date= April 6, 2008| last1 = Rastegari | first1 = Esther C.| last2 = Odle | first2 = Teresa G. | name-list-format = vanc |year= 2006| publisher= The Gale Group, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these jobs tend to be low-paying and typically held by low income individuals. The decreased amount of healthy food in stores located in low-income areas also contributes to the increased rates of diabetes for persons living in those neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=social /&gt; One of the best examples of this can be seen by observing the city of Jacksonville, Florida.

=== Food deserts in urban Jacksonville ===
In Jacksonville, Florida it is hard to find groceries stores around the area because it is surrounded by fats, sugar, and high in cholesterol markets. In Duval County, there are 177,000 food insecure individuals such as children, families,senior citizens, and veterans that do not know when they will have a chance to have another meal again.&lt;ref name ="FNWF"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.feedingnefl.org/the-food-desert-impact-on-northeast-florida/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2abT39aS2gIVnbXACh0DZQX0EAAYBCAAEgJPavD_BwE | title = The Food Desert Impact on Northeast Florida | date = 2017-07-18 | work = Feeding Northeast Florida | access-date = 2018-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 60 percent of the food that is consumed in Duval County is processed.&lt;ref name ="FNWF" /&gt; To combat this, agencies helped distribute food and they averaged 12.3 million meals over eight counties in Northern Florida. In Duval alone, 3.5 million meals were handed out to families. The image below shows  all of the hunger-relief partner agencies located within Jacksonville's food deserts that get food from Feeding Northeast Florida. In all Feeding Northeast Florida provided 4.2 million pounds of food to agencies in food deserts. These numbers were stats recorded in 2016.

=== Water pollution ===
Just like Flint Jacksonville had a water crisis and found 23 different chemicals in their water supply.&lt;ref name = "Smith_2014"&gt;{{cite news | first = Richard David | last = Smith | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://folioweekly.com/H2OH-NO-THE-RESULTS-ARE-IN-JACKSONVILLES-WATER-IS-PRETTY-BAD,11315 | title = H2OH-NO! The Results are in: Jacksonville's Water is Pretty Bad | work = Folio Weekly Magazine | date = 27 October 2014 | access-date = 1 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was so bad that Jacksonville was labeled top 10 in worst water in the nation. They stood at number 10 because of the 23 different chemicals. The chemicals that were most found in the water in high volumes were trihalomethanes, which is made up of four different cleaning by products such as chloroform. Trihalomethanes are confirmed to be carcinogenic.&lt;ref name = "Smith_2014" /&gt; Throughout the five year testing period, unsafe levels of trihalomethanes were found during the 32 months of testing, and levels that are considered illegal by the EPA were found in 12 of those months.&lt;ref name = "Smith_2014" /&gt; In one of the testing periods the trihalomethanes were found at twice the EPA legal limit. Other chemicals such as lead and arsenic that can cause health problems to people, were also found in the drinking water.&lt;ref name = "Smith_2014" /&gt;

Another way that water pollution is damaged is from nutrient overload. Nutrient overload is caused by manure and fertilizers, storm water runoff, and wastewater treatment plants. This occurs in a lot of Florida rivers and the rivers are contained with blue green algae that feed on all those nutrients. All the waste that is dumped into the rivers gets fed on by other plants and animals that release toxins in the area, which makes everything surrounded by it a deadly toxin as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.wjct.org/post/professor-floridas-no-flint-state-water-policy-could-invite-pollution|title=Professor: Florida's No Flint, But State Water Policy Could Invite Pollution|last=Florida|first=Ryan Benk, Melissa Ross, Jim Turner - News Service of|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The toxins that are dumped into the rivers can cause discoloration in the rivers to make a dark blue and green color. By looking at the river most people can tell how dangerous and harmful it is to be around it. If the water were to somehow get into water companies people can receive serious harm from drinking and bathing with this water.

== Education ==
Education level is a great predictor of socioeconomic status. On average, individuals with a bachelors, associates, and high school degrees will annually earn 64.5, 50, and 41 thousand dollars respectively. This means that the average bachelor's degree earner will receive approximately $1,000,000 more over their working life than an individual with only a high school degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Pfeffer, Fabian. "Income Inequality." Lecture, University of Michigan, January 30, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|sure=y|reason=Not independently verifiable|date=March 2018}} Furthermore, as authors Montez, Hummer, and Hayward explained, "In 2012, unemployment was 12.4 percent among adults who did not graduate high school, compared to 8.3 percent among adults with a high school diploma and 4.5 percent among college graduates."&lt;ref name = "Montez_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Montez JK, Hummer RA, Hayward MD | title = Educational attainment and adult mortality in the United States: a systematic analysis of functional form | journal = Demography | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 315–36 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22246797 | pmc = 3290920 | doi = 10.1007/s13524-011-0082-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the relationship between socioeconomic status and the prevalence of disease has already been well established, education is indirectly responsible for an increased prevalence of disease among the impoverished.

More directly, educational attainment is a great predictor of how likely an individual is to engage in risky, possibly disease causing, behaviors. In terms of smoking, which directly correlates to an increased risk for diseases like lung cancer, education is an important determining factor in the likelihood of an individual to smoke. As of 2009-10, 35 percent of adults who did not graduate high school were smokers, compared to 30 percent of high school graduates and just 13 percent of college graduates.&lt;ref name="Gilman_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilman SE, Martin LT, Abrams DB, Kawachi I, Kubzansky L, Loucks EB, Rende R, Rudd R, Buka SL | title = Educational attainment and cigarette smoking: a causal association? | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 615–24 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18180240 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dym250 | pmc = 4939617 }}&lt;/ref&gt; High school graduates also smoked more packs, on average, each year than smokers who had graduated from college.&lt;ref name="Gilman_2008" /&gt; Furthermore, individuals with a high school degree or less were 30% less likely to abstain from smoking for at least 3 months during their time as a regular smoker&lt;ref name="Gilman_2008" /&gt; Other studies have found that binge drinking is higher among those with college degrees, implying that binge drinking is a habitat developed by many during the college years.&lt;ref name = "Chambial_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chambial S, Dwivedi S, Shukla KK, John PJ, Sharma P | title = Vitamin C in disease prevention and cure: an overview | journal = Indian Journal of Clinical Biochemistry | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 314–28 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24426232 | pmc = 3783921 | doi = 10.1007/s12291-013-0375-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unhealthy dietary habits can also directly lead to diseases such as heart disease, hypertension, and type-2 diabetes. One of the leading causes of unhealthy eating habits is a lack of access to grocery stores, creating so called "food deserts." Studies have found that immediate access to a grocery store (within 1.5 mile radius) was 1.4 times less likely in areas where only 27%, or less, of the population was college graduates.&lt;ref name = "Montez_2012" /&gt; The negative effects of these food deserts are exacerbated by the fact that impoverished neighborhoods also had an oversupply of liquor store, fast food restaurants, and convenience stores.&lt;ref name = "Montez_2012" /&gt;

One significant risk for sexually active individuals is that of sexually transmitted diseases and infections. While studies have found that the correlation between education and carrying these is relatively low on average (and even less so for certain subsets such as Black women), there is a strong correlation between education and other risky sexual behaviors.&lt;ref name = "Annang_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Annang L, Walsemann KM, Maitra D, Kerr JC | title = Does education matter? Examining racial differences in the association between education and STI diagnosis among black and white young adult females in the U.S | journal = Public Health Reports | volume = 125 Suppl 4 | issue = Suppl 4 | pages = 110–21 | date = 2010 | pmid = 20629254 | pmc = 2882981 | doi = 10.1177/00333549101250S415 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with only a high school degree or less were significantly more likely to engage in risky practices such as early sexual initiation, sexual activity with those who use "shooting" street drugs such as heroin, and even prostitution. In addition, those with less education were also less likely to practice some safe sex practices such as condom use.&lt;ref name = "Annang_2010" /&gt;

Studies have also found that adults with higher educational achievement were more likely to lead healthier lives. Intake of key nutrients such as Vitamins A and C, potassium, and calcium was positively correlated with education level.&lt;ref name = "Chambial_2013" /&gt; This is a critical statistic because those nutrients, such as Vitamin C, are critical in helping the body fight diseases and infections.&lt;ref name = "Chambial_2013" /&gt; There was also a correlation between education and exercise habits. A 2010 study found that while 85% of college graduates stated they exercised in the last month, only 68% of high school graduates and 61% of non-high school graduates said the same.&lt;ref name = "www.ahrq.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/education/curriculum-tools/population-health/zimmerman.html|title=Understanding the Relationship Between Education and Health: A Review of the Evidence and an Examination of Community Perspectives | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research &amp; Quality | access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because exercise is so crucial to preventing diseases like hypertension and type 2 diabetes, this stark distinction between exercise habitats can have significant effects. By 2011, 15% of high school (or less) graduates had diabetes, compared to just 7% of college graduates.&lt;ref name = "www.ahrq.gov" /&gt;

Arguably the best way of seeing the true effects of education in the inequality of disease is to examine mortality levels, as Heart Disease, Cancer, and Lower Respiratory Diseases are the top three killers, respectively, of Americans every year.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm|title=FastStats|date=2018-03-05|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; By age 25, if an individual does not have at least a high school degree, they will die an average of 9 years earlier than an otherwise similar college graduate.&lt;ref name = "Montez_2012" /&gt;  A different national study found that individuals with only bachelor's degrees were 26% more likely to die in the next 5 years than individuals of the same age with professional degrees such as a master's. Even more stark, Americans without a high school degree were almost twice as likely to die than those with a professional degree in the study's 5 year follow-up period.&lt;ref name = "www.ahrq.gov" /&gt;

'''Internet-mediated research''' ('''IMR''') is the practice of gathering [[biomedical research|medical, biomedical or health related research]] data via the [[internet]] directly from research subjects. The subject, uses a [[web browser]] to view and respond to questionnaires that are included in an approved medical research protocol.

In a traditional medical research study, the [[principal investigator]], Research Coordinator, or other study staff conducts an interview with the research subject and records the information on a paper or electronic [[case report form]]. Using IMR, the research subject instead responds to a questionnaire without the guidance of a research staff member, often performing the action at a time and place disassociated with the research clinic, using only a computer connected to the internet and a standard browser.

Recently, the medical community has begun to study whether there are differences between IMR data and traditionally collected data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Methodological and ethical issues in Internet-mediated research in the field of health: an integrated review of the literature | author=Whitehead LC | journal=Soc Sci Med | year=2007 | volume=65 | issue=4 | pages=782–91 | doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.03.005 | pmid=17512105 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953607001189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eduard von Grützner Falstaff mit Handschuhen.jpg|thumb|[[Eduard von Grützner]]'s depiction of [[Falstaff]], a literary character well known for his ''joie de vivre'']]

'''''Joie de vivre''''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒwa də vivʁ}}, ''joy of living'') is a [[List of French words and phrases used by English speakers|French phrase]] often used in English to express a cheerful enjoyment of life; an exultation of spirit.

It "can be a joy of conversation, joy of eating, joy of anything one might do… And ''joie de vivre'' may be seen as a joy of everything, a comprehensive joy, a philosophy of life, a ''[[Weltanschauung]]''. Robert's ''Dictionnaire'' says joie is ''sentiment exaltant ressenti par toute la conscience'', that is, involves one's whole being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shibles |first=Warren |year=1997 |title=Humor Reference Guide: A Comprehensive Classification and Analysis |location=Carbondale |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |isbn=0-8093-2097-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and development ==
Casual use of the phrase in French can be dated back at least as far as [[Fénelon]] in the late 17th century, but it was only brought into literary prominence in the 19th century, first by [[Jules Michelet|Michelet]] (1857) in his [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] work ''Insecte'', to contrast the passive life of plants with animal ''joie de vivre'',&lt;ref name="Harrow"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrow |first1=Susan |last2=Unwin |first2=Timothy A |last3=Freeman |first3=Michael |year=2009 |title=Joie de vivre in French literature and culture : essays in honour of Michael Freeman |location=Amsterdam, NTH &amp; New York, NY |publisher=[[Rodopi (publisher)|Rodopi Publishers]] |isbn=9789042028968 |oclc=430229593}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|300}} and then by [[Émile Zola]] in his [[La Joie de vivre|book of that name]] from 1883–84.&lt;ref name="Harrow"/&gt;{{rp|305}}

Thereafter, it took on increasing weight as a mode of life, evolving at times almost into a [[secular religion]]&lt;ref name="Harrow"/&gt;{{rp|306}} in the early 20th century; and subsequently fed into [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] emphasis on "a ''jouissance'' beyond the pleasure principle"&lt;ref name="Lacan"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lacan |first1=Jacques |author1-link=Jacques Lacan |last2=Miller |first2=Jacques-Alain |author2-link=Jacques-Alain Miller |last3=Sheridan |first3=Alan |author-link3=Alan Sheridan |year=1994 |title=The four fundamental concepts of psycho-analysis |location=London, UK |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=9780140242782 |oclc=33725110 |page=184}}&lt;br/&gt;Later online version of {{cite book |title=The four fundamental concepts of psycho-analysis |year=2004 |location=London, UK &amp; New York, NY |publisher=Karnac |id={{OCLC|733841387|729166946}} |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the latter half of the century – a time when its emphasis on enthusiasm, energy and spontaneity gave it a global prominence with the rise of [[hippie]] culture.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Andrews |first1=Cecile |year=2006 |title=Slow is beautiful : new visions of community, leisure and joie de vivre |location=Gabriola Island, BC, Canada |publisher=[[Douglas &amp; McIntyre|New Society Publishers]] |page=96 |isbn=9781550924145 |id={{OCLC|471124890|810539385}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychology ==
20th-century proponents of [[self-actualization]] such as [[Abraham Maslow]] or [[Carl Rogers]] saw, as one of the by-products, the rediscovery of what the latter called "the quiet joy in being one's self...a spontaneous relaxed enjoyment, a primitive ''joie de vivre''".&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rogers |first1=Carl R |author1-link=Carl R Rogers |year=1961 |title=On becoming a person : a therapist's view of psychotherapy |location=Boston, MA, USA |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Company]] |pages=87–88 |isbn=9780395084090 |oclc=172718}}&lt;br/&gt;Later online versions of {{cite book |title=On becoming a person : a therapist's view of psychotherapy. |id={{OCLC|782873749|783585017|856932797|858970706}} |subscription=yes}}&lt;br/&gt;{{Google books|FTEPV9IYQ5EC|On Becoming a Person: A Therapist's View of Psychotherapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Joie de vivre'' has also been linked to [[D. W. Winnicott]]'s concept of a sense of play, and of access to the [[true self]].&lt;ref name="Lamb"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lamb |first1=Charles |author1-link=Charles Lamb |year=1985 |editor1-last=Phillips |editor1-first=Adam |editor1-link=Adam Phillips (psychologist) |title=Selected prose |location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex, UK &amp; New York, NY |publisher=[[Penguin classics]] |page=446 |isbn=9780140432381 |oclc=680112630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adaptations ==
It is usually referenced in its standard French form, but various corruptions are observed such as ''joie de vie'', which would translate to "joy of life".&lt;ref name="Wayfair"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wayfair.com/Art-4-Kids-Joie-de-Vie-Poodle-Dog-Wall-Art-21408-AFK1292.html  |title=Joie de Vie Poodle Dog Wall Art |accessdate=2013-11-16 |website=wayfair.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Matisse]] painting ''[[Le bonheur de vivre]]'' translates as, "The Happiness of Life".

Schellenberg was born in the village of Tiegerweide, at the time in South Russia, today in [[Ukraine]]; it is part of the [[Molotschna]] Mennonite colony. Her parents were Abraham and Katharina Lohrenz Schellenberg, with whom she immigrated to the [[United States]] in 1879, settling in Kansas.&lt;ref name="LindleyStebner2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Susan Hill Lindley|author2=Eleanor J.

Early in her career she worked in various locations, from Hughestown as far south as the [[Tungabhadra River]]; the mission built a hospital at [[Nagarkurnool]] in 1912.&lt;ref name="Anderson1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerald H.

Many of her patients were [[Islam|Muslim]] women who could not be seen by a male doctor. Schellenberg died suddenly in India, and is buried in the St. George Cemetery in [[Hyderabad]].&lt;ref name="mbhistory.org"/&gt; An archive of photographs related to her career in India is held at the Mennonite Library &amp; Archives at [[Fresno Pacific University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archives.mhsc.ca/katharina-schellenberg-collection|title=Katharina Schellenberg Collection - Mennonite Archival Image Database|website=archives.mhsc.ca|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of people who have walked across the United States''' from the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] to the [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]] or vice versa. Walking or running across the [[United States]] has long been pursued as a way to bring publicity to social causes.

==Richard Llew Evans==
[[Richard Llew Evans]] departed [[Tybee Island]], Georgia, at 8:30 AM, November 24, 2017, and arrived at Imperial beach, [[San Diego]], on January 31, 2018, at 12:45 PM.&lt;ref&gt;http://walk4parkinsons.org&lt;/ref&gt; Evans appears to have set the record for walking coast to coast (67 days). Evans has Parkinson's disease and walked an average of 1.5 marathons per day, every day without a break. Evans was real-time trackable throughout his walk via Google location sharing and had different people walking with him in each state. Evans raised over $120,000 for the Michael J. Fox foundation and is writing a book about the connections he made along the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/video/meet-the-man-who-s-walking-2-500-miles-to-fight-parkinson-s-disease-1111453251932|title=Meet the man who’s walking 2,500 miles to fight Parkinson’s disease|website=TODAY.com|access-date=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2018/02/05/wilmette-man-completes-walk-across-us-parkinson-s-disease|title=Wilmette Man Completes Walk Across US for Parkinson’s Disease|website=wttw.com|access-date=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/communities/south-county/sd-se-parkinsons-walk-20180131-story.html|title=Man with Parkinson's disease finishes cross-country walk in Imperial Beach|first=David|last=Hernandez|website=sandiegouniontribune.com|access-date=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kusi.com/uncorked-adventures-walk-across-america/|title=Uncorked Adventures: Walk Across America|date=January 31, 2018|website=kusi.com|access-date=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecwsandiego.com/story/37399074/walking-forparkingsonsfrom-sea-to-shining-sea|title=Walking for Parkinson's from sea to shining sea|website=thecwsandiego.com|access-date=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yumasun.com/bill-bucklew/image_591068a8-0320-11e8-9822-0799944b66df.html|title=Bill Bucklew|first=Photo by Randy Hoeft/Yuma|last=Sun|website=yumasun.com|access-date=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/2018/01/12/bill-bucklew-wont-let-parkinsons-diagnosis-stop-him-walking-across-country/1030675001/|title=Bill Bucklew won't let Parkinson's diagnosis stop him from walking across the country|website=lcsun-news.com|access-date=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.news-journal.com/videos/2017/dec/18/1245/|title=Bill Bucklew - Walk for Parkinson's - Longview News-Journal|website=www.news-journal.com|access-date=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bradford Lyttle]], an organizer with the [[Committee for Non-Violent Action]], and several others walked from [[San Francisco]] to [[New York City]], and then through parts of Europe to [[Moscow]], Russia, from December 1960 until late 1961. The action was called the [[San Francisco to Moscow March]] for Peace. Several participants, including Lyttle, walked the entire distance. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1961/10/04/archives/peace-marchers-reach-red-square-but-soviet-prohibits-speeches-peace.html|title=Peace Marchers Reach Red Square But Soviet Prohibits Speeches - UPI/The New York Times|website=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40109166?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|title=Lifting the Iron Curtain: The Peace March to Moscow of 1960-1961 - The International History Review|website=www.jstor.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/anti-war-activists-march-moscow-peace-1960-1961|title=Anti-war activists march to Moscow for peace, 1960-1961 - Global Nonviolent Action Database, Swarthmore College|website=nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These participants of A [[Walk of the People – A Pilgrimage for Life]] walked across the United States in 1984 as part of the action that called for global nuclear disarmament and better relations between the U.S. and former [[Soviet Union]]. The march started at [[Point Conception]], Calif., and went through Texas and the Deep South to [[New York City]]. Several others, including Andy Rector, walked significant portions across the U.S. and continued in Europe to [[Moscow]], Russia, in 1985. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apnews.com/7ba3f8625c2931f93edb4a112db1c95e|title=U.S. Peace Activists Denied East German Visas - Associated Press, Sept. 13, 1985|website=www.apnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/peacewebsite/scpcWebsite/Documents/NewBooks2011-2012.html|title=New Books, Periodicals, and Electronic Media in the Swarthmore College Peace Collection - Swarthmore College|website=www.swarthmore.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Michael Ross &amp; George Crawford==
Michael Ross, 18, from Manchester, CT, walked from Danbury, CT to Huntington Beach, CA. This walk took 297 days and was in an effort to raise funds and awareness for the Livestrong Foundation. Over $13,000 was raised. Michael was accompanied by his childhood friend, George Crawford. Most days both Michael and George were welcomed into the homes of kind people who would make dinner and give them a place to sleep. They could not believe the amount of hospitality they received. The walk started April 2013 and ended February 2014. &lt;ref&gt;https://triblive.com/neighborhoods/yourallekiskivalley/yourallekiskivalleymore/5506334-74/ross-crawford-livestrong&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/walkingforacure2013/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philip Cihiwsky==
Phil Cihiwsky, 59, from Loveland, Colorado, walked from San Diego, California, to York Harbor, Maine, starting his walk on March 4 and completing it on October 4, 2013. He walked 3300 miles, crossing 15 states in 7 months while raising awareness about food insecurity issues among older adults for [[Meals On Wheels]] and encouraging the people he met along the way to support home-delivered meal programs in their own communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20131005-NEWS-310050318 |work=Seacoastonline |title=Man walks across country for Meals on Wheels |author=Susan Morse |date=October 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2013/mar/04/volunteer-will-walk-and-wheel-3200-miles-support-m/ |work=KPBS News |title=Volunteer Will Walk And Wheel 3,200 Miles To Support Meals On Wheels |author=Dwane Brown |date=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elliott Lannen and Graeme Lithgow==
Elliott Lannen and Graeme Jeffrey Lithgow walked from [[San Francisco]], California, to St. Augustine, Florida, from 2013 to 2014. The party began with three members, but Julio Lopez abandoned the project after traversing the California coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staugustine.com/news/local-news/2014-06-08/sea-shining-sea|title=Video: From sea to shining sea|first=BOB|last=TIS|website=staugustine.com|access-date=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Helga and Clara Estby==
[[Helga Estby]], a 36-year-old from [[Spokane, Washington]], and her 18-year-old daughter Clara walked from Spokane to [[New York City]] in 1896, setting off on May 5, 1896, passing through 14 states along the way, and arriving at the latter on [[Christmas Eve]]. She did so in response to a $10,000 challenge from a sponsor given to any woman who would walk across the United States. She brought with her a compass, red-pepper spray, a revolver, and a curling iron. She wanted the money in order to save her family's {{convert|160|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm. She did not receive it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Book Honors Pair's Courageous, Forgotten Walk Across America |date=June 1, 2003 |author=Christy Karras|work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|pages=D6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Get on the road with a good book |author=Margo Hammond|date=June 23, 2006 |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |url=http://sptimes.com./2006/07/23/Books/Get_on_the_road_with_.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Nation: Women Get No Mileage From Cross-Country Trek|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Chris Rodkey|date=July 13, 2003 |pages=A.27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Louis Michael Figueroa==
In 1982, Louis Michael Figueroa, age 16, became the fastest and youngest person (according to some sources)&lt;ref name="ContraCosta" /&gt; to run across the United States, covering the route from [[New Brunswick, NJ]] to [[San Francisco]] in 60 days to fulfill a promise to a friend who was dying of bone cancer.&lt;ref name="Figueroa1982" /&gt;

In 1996–1997 he walked from [[Bangor, ME]] to [[San Diego, CA]] for local AIDS networks in memory of his brother Jimmy, who died of the disease. The walk was plagued by delays due to Figueroa's battle with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia.&lt;ref name="Figueroa1982" /&gt;

'''Maximilian Oskar Bircher-Benner''', [[M.D.]] (August 22, 1867 – January 24, 1939) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[physician]] and a pioneer [[nutritionist]] credited for popularizing [[muesli]].

==Biography==
Maximilian Oskar Bircher-Benner was born on August 22, 1867 in [[Aarau]], Switzerland, to Heinrich Bircher and Berta Krüsi.&lt;ref name="Maximilian Oskar Bircher-Benner"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Maximilian Oskar Bircher-Benner|url = http://www.cooksinfo.com/maximilian-oskar-bircher-benner|website = CooksInfo.com|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[University of Zurich]] to study medicine, and later opened his own general clinic. During the first year the clinic was open, Bircher-Benner came down with jaundice, and he claimed he became well again by eating raw apples. From this observation, he experimented with the health effects raw foods have on the body, and from this he promoted muesli, a dish based on raw oats, fruits, and nuts.&lt;ref name ="Zurich Development Center"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Biography of Max Bircher-Benner – Zurich Development Center|url = http://www.zurichdevelopmentcenter.com/aboutzurichdevelopmentcenter/locationhistory/biographybircher.htm|website = www.zurichdevelopmentcenter.com|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bircher-Benner expanded on his nutritional research and opened a sanatorium called "Vital Force" in 1897. He believed raw fruits and vegetables held the most nutritional value, cooked and commercially processed foods held even less, and meat held the least nutritional value. Eventually, Bircher-Benner gave up meat entirely. Other scientists of the time did not respond well to what Bircher-Benner referred to as his "new food science," but the general public caught on to his ideas to the point where he had to expand his sanatorium practice.&lt;ref name="Maximilian Oskar Bircher-Benner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Notes on Books|last = |first = |publisher = The British Medical Journal|date = 1925-01-26|isbn = |location = |pages = 157}}&lt;/ref&gt; His nutritional habits and eating patterns steadily grew in popularity until he died on January 24, 1939 in Switzerland at the age of 71.&lt;ref name="Dr. M. Bircher-Benner"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dr. M. Bircher-Benner|last = |first = |date = 1939-02-11|journal = The British Medical Journal|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bircher Benner authored a book titled "''Food Science for All''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jainism and World Problems |author= Champat Rai Jain |author-link= Champat Rai Jain |p=192 |url=https://archive.org/details/WorldProblems |year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrition==
At his [[sanatorium]] in [[Zürich]], a balanced [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] of raw [[vegetable]]s and [[fruit]] was used as a means to heal [[patient]]s, contrary to the beliefs commonly held at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name ="Zurich Development Center"/&gt; Bircher-Benner believed raw foods were more nutritious because they contain direct energy from the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Books Abroad|last = Thuringer|first = Joseph M.|publisher = Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma|date = 1927-09-01|isbn = |location = |pages = 44}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was among the first scientists in Europe to believe food could be used to keep the body healthy rather than simply satisfy hunger. He encouraged people of good health to eat approximately 50% raw foods on a daily basis, and for those with poor health to eat 100% raw foods. Bircher-Benner's sisters, Alice Bircher and Berta Brupbacher-Bircher, created many recipes using raw foods to help a diet of raw foods seem more appealing. Because of this help from his sisters, his sanatorium gained enormous popularity and he expanded the size of his clinic.&lt;ref name="Maximilian Oskar Bircher-Benner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dr. M. Bircher-Benner"/&gt;

Bircher-Benner changed the eating habits of the late 19th century. Instead of much [[meat]] and [[white bread]], he postulated eating fruit, vegetables and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]]. His ideas included not only controlled nutrition, but also spartan physical discipline. At his Zürich [[sanatorium]] off Bircher-Benner-Platz, the patients had to follow a somewhat [[monastic]] daily schedule including early bedtime (21:00, or 9:00pm), physical training and active gardening work. Each meal began with a small dish of muesli, developed by Dr. Bircher-Benner, followed by mostly raw vegetables and a dessert. Patients were not allowed to consume alcohol, coffee, chocolate, or tobacco while they were being treated. Bircher-Benner also recommended his patients to sun bathe, take cold showers, and use a medicinal bath developed by American physician [[John Harvey Kellogg]].&lt;ref name="Maximilian Oskar Bircher-Benner"/&gt; His theory of life was based on harmony between people and nature, a key component of a German lifestyle reform movement, and the reason he named his clinic "Vital Force."&lt;ref name ="Zurich Development Center"/&gt; Some of his ideas originate from observing the daily life of [[shepherds]] in the [[Swiss Alps]], who lived a simple and healthy life.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

== Criticism ==
Bircher-Benner's ideas for nutrition were in opposition to the existing ideas of the time. Many of his ideas were backed up with observations rather than experiments and analysis. Because of this, Bircher-Benner was heavily critiqued and seldom respected as a nutritionist.&lt;ref name="Zurich Development Center"/&gt; A review for one of his cookbooks states that the number of people capable of eating solely raw fruits and vegetables as Bircher-Benner encouraged is limited because humans are not meant to be herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Notes on Books|last = |first = |date = 1935-01-26|journal = The British Medical Journal|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Mann]], a well-known novelist, visited the sanatorium and described it as a "health jail."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Maximilian Oskar Bircher-Benner|url = http://www.cooksinfo.com/maximilian-oskar-bircher-benner|website = CooksInfo.com|accessdate = 2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite disapproval from others, Bircher-Benner's ideas caught the public's eye and his sanatorium stayed in business.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Legacy==
Bircher-Benner's work was not recognized by other scientists until the discovery of vitamins in fruits and vegetables in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Maximilian Oskar Bircher-Benner"/&gt; Shortly after his death, a second sanatorium was opened and named "People's Sanatorium for a Lifestyle Based on Nature," and was run according to Bircher-Benner's ideas. In 1939, the Vital Force clinic was renamed the "Bircher-Benner Clinic" in his memory.&lt;ref name="Zurich Development Center"/&gt; In the late 20th century, after closure of the sanatorium, it was briefly a student [[hostel]]. It has since been purchased by [[Zürich Financial Services]], and is named the Zürich Development Center. It is used for executive training, and also houses an extensive private art collection.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

'''Natural childbirth''' is [[childbirth]] without routine medical interventions, particularly [[anesthesia]]. Natural childbirth arose in opposition to the techno-medical model of childbirth that has recently gained popularity in industrialized societies. Natural childbirth attempts to minimize medical intervention, particularly the use of anesthetic medications and surgical interventions such as [[episiotomies]], forceps and [[ventouse]] deliveries and [[caesarean section]]s. Natural childbirth may occur during a physician or midwife attended [[hospital birth]], a midwife attended homebirth, or an unassisted birth. The term "natural childbirth" was coined by obstetrician [[Grantly Dick-Read]] upon publication of his book ''Natural Childbirth'' in the 1930s, which was followed by the 1942 ''Childbirth Without Fear''.

==History==
Historically, most women gave birth at home without emergency medical care available. The "natural" rate of maternal mortality—meaning without surgical or pharmaceutical intervention—has been estimated at 1,500 per 100,000 births. In the United States circa 1900, before the introduction and improvement of modern medical technologies, there were about 700 maternal deaths per 100,000 births (.7%).&lt;ref name="vanlerberghe"&gt;Van Lerberghe W, De Brouwere V. ''Of blind alleys and things that have worked: history’s lessons on reducing maternal mortality.'' In: De Brouwere V, Van Lerberghe W, eds. ''Safe motherhood strategies: a review of the evidence''. Antwerp, ITG Press, 2001 (Studies in Health Services Organisation and Policy, 17:7–33).  "Where nothing effective is done to avert maternal death, “natural” mortality is probably of the order of magnitude of 1,500/100,000...In the USA of 1900, for example, there were about 700 maternal deaths for 100,000 births"&lt;/ref&gt;

At the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], giving birth at home became more difficult due to congested living spaces and dirty living conditions. This drove urban and lower class women to newly available hospitals, while wealthy and middle-class women continued to labor at home.&lt;ref name=Cassidy&gt;{{cite book|last = Cassidy|first = Tina|title =  Birth|publisher= Atlantic Monthly Press|location= New York|year= 2006|pages = 54–55 |isbn = 0-87113-938-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1900s there was an increasing availability of hospitals, and more women began going into the hospital for labor and delivery. In the United States, the middle classes were especially receptive to the medicalization of childbirth, which promised a safer and less painful labor.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite journal |year = 2005 |title =  Consumer Risk Perceptions in a Community of Reflexive Doubt |journal = Journal of Consumer Research|volume = 32|pages = 235–248 |doi =  10.1086/432233 |author =  Thompson, Craig J. |authormask = Thompson, C.J. |issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to birth without pain was part of the early feminist movement.{{ref|Cassidy}} The use of childbirth drugs began in 1847 when Scottish obstetrician [[James Young Simpson]] introduced chloroform as an anesthetic during labor, but only the most rich and powerful women (such as [[Queen Victoria]]) had access. In the late 1800s, feminists in the United States and United Kingdom began to demand drugs for pain relief during childbirth.&lt;ref name="Downe2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Downe|title=Normal Childbirth: Evidence and Debate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G1F0tPKzgSAC&amp;pg=PA37|date=30 May 2008|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0-7020-3792-3|pages=37–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "natural childbirth" was coined by obstetrician [[Grantly Dick-Read]] upon publication of his book ''Natural Childbirth'' in the 1930s. In 1942 [[Grantly Dick-Read]] published ''Revelation of Childbirth'' (which was later retitled ''Childbirth without Fear''), advocating natural childbirth, which became an international bestseller. The [[Lamaze method]] of natural childbirth gained popularity in the United States after Marjorie Karmel wrote about her experiences in her 1959 book ''Thank You, Dr. Lamaze'', and with the formation of the American Society for Psychoprophylaxis in Obstetrics (currently [[Lamaze International]]) by Marjorie Karmel and [[Elisabeth Bing]]. Later, physicians [[Michel Odent]] and [[Frederick Leboyer]] and midwives such as [[Ina May Gaskin]] promoted [[birthing center]]s, [[water birth]], and [[homebirth]] as alternatives to the hospital model. The [[Bradley method of natural childbirth]] (also known as "husband-coached childbirth"), a method of natural childbirth developed in 1947 by Robert A. Bradley, M.D., was popularized by his book ''Husband-Coached Childbirth'', first published in 1965.

==Psychological aspects==
Many women consider natural birth empowering.&lt;ref&gt;''Having a Great Birth in Australia'', [[David Vernon (writer)|David Vernon]], Australian College of Midwives, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that skin-to-skin contact between a mother and her newborn immediately after birth is beneficial for both mother and baby.  A review done by the [[World Health Organization]] found that skin-to-skin contact between mothers and babies after birth reduces crying, improves mother-infant interaction, and helps mothers to breastfeed successfully. They recommend that [[neonates]] be allowed to bond with the mother during their first two hours after birth, the period that they tend to be more alert than in the following hours of early life.&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.who.int/rhl/newborn/gpcom/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives to intervention==
Instead of medical interventions, a variety of non-invasive methods are employed during natural childbirth to ease the mother's pain. Many of these techniques stress the importance of "a mind-body connection," which the techno-medical model of birth does not. These techniques include [[hydrotherapy]], [[massage]], [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]] therapy, [[hypnosis]], [[breath]]ing exercises, acupressure for labor, [[transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]] (TENS), [[Speech production|vocalization]], [[Mental image|visualization]], [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] and [[water birth]]. Other approaches include movement, walking, and different positions (for example, using a [[birthing ball]]), hot and cold therapy (for example, using hot compresses and/or cold packs), and receiving one-on-one labor support like that provided by a [[midwife]] or [[doula]]. However, natural childbirth proponents maintain that pain is a natural and necessary part of the labor process, and should not automatically be regarded as entirely negative. In contrast to the pain of injury and disease, they believe that the pain of childbirth is a sign that the female body is functioning as it is meant to.

Birth positions favored in natural childbirth—including [[Squatting position|squatting]], hands and knees, or suspension in water—contrast with the [[lithotomy position]] (woman in hospital bed on her back with legs in stirrups), which has consistently been shown to slow and complicate labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis-Floyd|first=Robbie|title=Birth as an American Rite of Passage|year=2004|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-22932-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods to reduce tearing during natural childbirth (instead of an [[episiotomy]]) include managing the [[perineum]] with counter-pressure,&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite web |author = World Health Organization|year =1997 |title = Care in normal birth: A practical guide|url = http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/MSM_96_24/MSM_96_24_chapter4.en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; hot compresses, and pushing the baby out slowly.

==Preparation==
Some women take birth education classes such as [[Lamaze]] or the [[Bradley method of natural childbirth|Bradley Method]] to prepare for a natural childbirth. Several books are also available with information to help women prepare. A midwife or [[doula]] may include preparation for a natural birth as part of the prenatal care services. However, a  study published in 2009 suggests that preparation alone is not enough to ensure an intervention-free outcome.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/122394587/HTMLSTART?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence of medical intervention in the U.S.==
In the U.S in 2007: 93% of mothers used [[cardiotocography|electronic fetal monitoring]]; 63% used
[[epidural]]s; 55% had their [[rupture of membranes|membranes ruptured]]; 53% received [[oxytocin]] to stimulate labor progress; and 52% received [[episiotomy|episiotomies]].&lt;ref name=Gissespie&gt;{{cite web |author=Gissespie, M., Strauss, M |year = 2007 |title = What Women Aren’t Told about Childbirth |url = http://www.alternet.org/story/65608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

Some studies argue that the push towards 'natural childbirth' in [[Developed countries|Western countries]] is exaggerated, and can harm women.&lt;ref&gt;''Articles'':

==History==
In 2013 co-founder Ridhi Tariyal was part of the first class of the Blavatnik Fellowship at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =SARAH | first =ZHANG | title =Hey Silicon Valley, Let’s Talk About Periods | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''wired.com''| date =4 July 2016 | url =https://www.wired.com/2016/04/hey-silicon-valley-lets-talk-periods/ | accessdate =10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the fellowship is to place recent MBA graduates in labs across Harvard with the goal to commercialize life science-based enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Shepherd | first =Laughlin | title =Ridhi Tariyal, cofounder, NextGen Jane| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''jwtintelligence.com''| date =27 July 2017 | url =https://www.jwtintelligence.com/2017/07/ridhi-tariyal-cofounder-nextgen-jane/ | accessdate =10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming out of the fellowship Tariyal and co-founder Stephen Gire developed intellectual property for a Smart Tampon System to gather genomic information about a woman’s health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Alec | first = O| title =3D printed tampon accessory by NextGen Jane enables self-testing for STDs | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''3ders.org''| date = | url =http://www.3ders.org/articles/20160617-3d-printed-tampon-accessory-by-nextgen-jane-enables-self-testing-for-stds.html | accessdate =10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Charles | first =Moore | title =Harvard-mentored Researchers Developing At-Home Product to Detect Endrometriosis and ‘Silent Infections’ in Women | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''endometriosisnews.com''| date =12 April 2016 | url =https://endometriosisnews.com/2016/04/12/researchers-developing-diagnostic-technology-to-help-women-monitor-their-own-health-and-fertility/ | accessdate =10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NextGen Jane was founded in 2014 with this IP as its core [[patent]] technology and its headquarters are located in [[Oakland, California]], [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Tanaya | first =Singh | title =Indian American Entrepreneur Co-Develops Smart Tampons to Help Women Detect Cervical Cancer &amp; More | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''thebetterindia.com''| date = | url =https://www.thebetterindia.com/57009/smart-tampons-reproductive-health-indian-american-entrepreneur/ | accessdate =10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the company had nothing to do with tampon.

'''Press Ganey Associates''' is a [[South Bend]], [[Indiana]]-based [[health care]] company known for developing and distributing [[patient satisfaction]] [[survey (human research)|survey]]s. As of January 2017, its Medical Practice Survey was the most widely used [[outpatient]] satisfaction survey in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Presson |first=Angela P. |last2=Zhang |first2=Chong |last3=Abtahi |first3=Amir M. |last4=Kean |first4=Jacob |last5=Hung |first5=Man |last6=Tyser |first6=Andrew R. |date=January 2017 |title=Psychometric properties of the Press Ganey® Outpatient Medical Practice Survey |journal=Health and Quality of Life Outcomes |language=En |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=32 |doi=10.1186/s12955-017-0610-3 |issn=1477-7525 |pmc=5301343 |pmid=28183312}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==History==
Press Ganey Associates was founded in 1985 by medical anthropologist Irwin Press and sociologist-statistician Rod Ganey, both of whom were then professors at the [[University of Notre Dame]]. Over the next fifteen years, the company's client base, which initially consisted of only a few hospitals, grew steadily in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jr. |first=Richard Bolton Siegrist, |date=2013-11-02 |title=Patient Satisfaction: History, Myths, and Misperceptions |url=https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/patient-satisfaction-history-myths-and-misperceptions/2013-11 |journal=AMA Journal of Ethics |volume=15 |issue=11 |pages=982–987 |access-date=2018-10-25|doi=10.1001/virtualmentor.2013.15.11.mhst1-1311 |pmid=24257092 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, [[Mel Hall (politician)|Mel Hall]] began working at Press Ganey, and in 2001, he became its [[CEO]]. He remained the company's CEO until stepping down in 2012 to found the [[Nashville]]-based medical staffing firm SpecialtyCare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/politics/former-ceo-mel-hall-announces-bid-to-unseat-jackie-walorski/article_fb22ee6a-addd-11e7-bce5-972748578eda.html |title=Former CEO Mel Hall announces bid to unseat Jackie Walorski |last=writer |first=Jeff Parrott Staff |work=South Bend Tribune |access-date=2018-10-25 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] previously used Press Ganey's survey to measure patient satisfaction, but in 2012, after the survey was widely criticized, they replaced it with the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zusman |first=Edie E. |date=August 2012 |title=HCAHPS Replaces Press Ganey Survey as Quality Measure for Patient Hospital Experience |url=https://academic.oup.com/neurosurgery/article/71/2/N21/2595747 |journal=Neurosurgery |language=en |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=N21–N24 |doi=10.1227/01.neu.0000417536.07871.ed |pmid=22811203 |issn=0148-396X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2016, Press Ganey's surveys are in use at more than 10,000 medical institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Etier |first=Brian E. |last2=Orr |first2=Scott P. |last3=Antonetti |first3=Jonathan |last4=Thomas |first4=Scott B. |last5=Theiss |first5=Steven M. |date=November 2016 |title=Factors impacting Press Ganey patient satisfaction scores in orthopedic surgery spine clinic |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1529943016300353 |journal=The Spine Journal |volume=16 |issue=11 |pages=1285–1289 |doi=10.1016/j.spinee.2016.04.007 |pmid=27084192 |issn=1529-9430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Porter''' is a neurosurgeon in California. Porter was a founding member of the Brain Research Institute. He became Professor of Neurological Surgery at the [[University of California, Irvine]], College of Medicine in 1969, and is currently Professor Emeritus there.

== Education ==
Porter studied at [[Northwestern University]], taking a B.S. in 1946, a M.S. in 1948, and a M.D. in 1950. He did an internship at the [[Los Angeles County General Hospital]]. Next he had a fellowship in neuroscience at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. In 1952, he earned a Ph.D. from [[Northwestern University]]. That was followed by residency training in neurological surgery at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Long Beach.

== Career ==
For two years Porter was in the [[U.S. Army]], performing neurosurgical investigations at the [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]]. 
In 1958 he became Chief of the Neurosurgical Service and Director of Research at the VA Hospital. He joined the faculty of the [[UCLA School of Medicine]], having appointments in both anatomy and neurological surgery. In 1963 he was a lecturer and visiting neurosurgeon in the Department of Surgical Neurology at the [[University of Edinburgh]], developing clinical and research techniques in stereotactic neurosurgery.

Porter’s research has concerned the integration of central autonomic function and the interrelationships between the brain stem and abnormal visceral function. His clinical neurosurgical interests have been in spinal cord injury and functional stereotaxy.

Porter has 120 publications in his bibliography.

== Accomplishments and awards  ==
Porter is a member of the [[American Medical Association]], [[American College of Surgeons]], [[American Association of Neurological Surgeons]], American Academy of Neurological Surgery, Research Society of Neurological Surgeons, Western Neurosurgical Society (President, 1971), California Association of Neurological Surgeons, Southern California Neurosurgical Society (President, 1967), American Physiological Society and the American Association of Anatomists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.societyns.org/society/bio.aspx?MemberID=11205 |title=The Society of Neurological Surgeons |access-date=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Huffington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the claim was rejected when communication could not be repeated with a different facilitator and by hiding the object to be identified from the view of the [[Facilitated communication|facilitator]].&lt;ref name=hoax&gt;{{Cite news|author=Scott Hensley |title=Book-writing man in coma fails communication test |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2010/02/bookwriting_man_in_coma_flunks.html |quote=But further tests show the man, Rom Houben, was unable to correctly identify simple words and objects presented to him by researchers, his neurologist Steven Laureys tells NPR's Jon Hamilton. |work=[[National Public Radio]] |date=17 February 2010 |accessdate=2010-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Houben was diagnosed with total [[locked-in syndrome]] by Belgian [[neurologist]] [[Steven Laureys]] in 2006 with the help of modern brain imaging techniques and equipment.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;Kate Connolly (23 November 2009). "[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/23/man-trapped-coma-23-years Car crash victim trapped in 'coma' for 23 years was conscious]". guardian.co.uk.&lt;/ref&gt; He now apparently communicates by typing into a keyboard with his right hand supported by a [[Facilitated communication|communication facilitator]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Memmott (23 November 2009). "[https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2009/11/for_23_years_man_thought_to_be.html For 23 years man thought to be in coma tried to 'scream', and no one heard]".

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the claims that Houben is able to communicate by typing have been widely disputed.&lt;ref name=Caplan1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Appel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Randi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Novella/&gt;

Houben's case is used to question the current methods of diagnosing vegetative state and to arguments against withholding care from such patients.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BMC"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Diagnostic accuracy of the vegetative and minimally conscious state: Clinical consensus versus standardized neurobehavioral assessment | author = Caroline Schnakers, Audrey Vanhaudenhuyse, Joseph Giacino, Manfredi Ventura, Melanie Boly, Steve Majerus, Gustave Moonen, [[Steven Laureys]] | journal = [[BMC Neurology]] | year = 2009 | volume = 9 | pages = 35 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2377-9-35 | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2377/9/35/ | pmid=19622138 | pmc=2718857}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some [[bioethicists]] believe that the case, if confirmed, may provide ''stronger'' arguments for withdrawing or withholding from vegetative patients.&lt;ref name=Appel/&gt;

While Houben was diagnosed in 2006, his case, first reported in a ''[[BMC Neurology]]'' paper in July 2009 without him being named,&lt;ref name="BMC"/&gt; was only brought to wider public attention after German weekly magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' ran a story on it in November 2009 which was subsequently picked up by media outlets around the world, receiving extensive coverage.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{Cite news|author=[[Brandon Keim]] |coauthors= |title=Reborn coma man's words may be bogus |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/11/houben-communication/ |quote= |work=[[Wired Science]] |date=24 November 2009 |accessdate=2010-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=han|title=Komapatient war 23 Jahre bei Bewusstsein|language=German|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/medizin/0,1518,662627,00.html |work=[[Spiegel Online]]|date=21 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Dworschak (23 November 2009). "[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,662625,00.html „Meine zweite Geburt"]". ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' 48/2009, pp. 134-137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Bioethicist [[Jacob M. Appel]] of [[New York University]] has suggested that the case may be either "a matter of wishful thinking", or "a cruel and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] hoax" that will be used by political conservatives in their public relations campaign against the [[right to die]].&lt;ref name=Appel&gt;[[Jacob M. Appel]] (24 November 2009).  [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/the-rom-houben-tragedy-an_b_370032.html The Rom Houben Tragedy and the Case for Active Euthanasia]. ''[[The Huffington Post]]''. Retrieved on 29 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The method used to allegedly communicate with Houben is known as "[[facilitated communication]]",&lt;ref name="MSNBC_video"/&gt; which the [[Association for Behavior Analysis International]], the [[American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]] and the [[American Association on Mental Retardation]] have called a "discredited technique", the use of which is "unwarranted and unethical".&lt;ref name=Caplan1&gt;[[Arthur Caplan]] (24 November 2009). [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34132340 Coherent after coma? Not so sure]. msnbc.com.  Retrieved on 29 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics, including [[PZ Myers]] and [[James Randi]], contend that facilitated communication does not involve actual communication with the disabled, but rather with the people playing the role of the "facilitator".&lt;ref&gt;PZ Myers (24 November 2009). "[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/really_this_guy_is_conscious.php Really? This guy is conscious?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127052139/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/11/really_this_guy_is_conscious.php |date=27 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Randi writes that claims of Houben's facilitated communication amount to a "cruel farce."&lt;ref name=Randi&gt;James Randi (25 November 2009). "[http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/783-this-cruel-farce-has-to-stop.html This cruel farce has to stop!]". James Randi Educational Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; Video footage shows the "facilitator", Linda Wouters, holding Houben's hand as his finger is being used to type at a rapid pace, even though the subject appears to be slumped over with his eyes closed.&lt;ref name='blind_typing'&gt;"[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/world/975121/belgian-coma-man-was-just-awake-for-23-years Belgian coma man was awake for 23 years]". ''ninemsn''. 24 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Neurologist]] [[Steven Novella]] argued that there was "little doubt" that Houben's typing is the result of bogus facilitated communication.&lt;ref name=Novella&gt;[[Steven Novella]] (25 November 2009). [http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2838 Man in Coma 23 Years – Is He Really Conscious?]. Retrieved on 29 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[Arthur Caplan]], a bioethics professor at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], has claimed that the statements Houben allegedly made through his facilitator seem unnatural for someone disabled and unable to speak for decades.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;&lt;ref name="msnbc1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34109227/ns/health-more_health_news/?GT1=43001|title=Man says emergence from ‘coma’ like rebirth|last=Associated Press|date=24 November 2009|accessdate=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Wouters, Houben is quoted as saying "Now I can communicate and talk via facilitated communication. Not everyone believes in this form of communication. It is a controversial method but, for me, it is vital to life. At last, my views can be heard and my feelings expressed."&lt;ref name='tol'&gt;David Charter (25 November 2009). "[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article6930608.ece Mystery as coma survivor Rom Houben finds voice at his fingertips]". ''Times Online''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Laureys said that he had verified that the facilitated communication was genuine, by showing Houben objects when the facilitator was not present in the room, and later asking Houben to recall those objects.&lt;ref name='tol'/&gt; Novella suggested that Laureys had not used proper controls.&lt;ref name=Novella/&gt;

In an interview with the Belgian newspaper ''[[De Standaard]]'', Laureys stated that he was not involved in the choice of communication method and refused to comment on its validity. He even claimed to be "a skeptic [himself]" and acknowledged that "the bad reputation of some forms [of facilitated communication] is justified". He also claimed that Houben's case was only made public because ''Der Spiegel'' wanted to report on his study and was looking for a "human element" to the story: "I knew that Rom and his family were willing to collaborate because they had done so before [for a Flemish TV channel]." However, he also criticized some of the negative feedback for "judging the evidence only on the basis of some video footage" and declared that "given time, we will look scientifically into the different ways of communication. For us, this seems to be the proper way."&lt;ref&gt;Filip Salmon (28 November 2009). "[http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=H12IVKE5 Rom is geen circusnummer (Rom is no circus act)]". ''De Standaard''. (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disproof==
Laureys later concluded that messages attributed to Houben through Wouters' facilitation were not, in fact, coming from Houben after all. After the early tests, further testing met with resistance. Using a different facilitator, subsequent testing under properly controlled conditions in which fifteen objects which were shown to Houben over a period of weeks was performed, Houben was unable to communicate knowledge of any of the objects which had been shown to him during the facilitator's absence.&lt;ref name=hoax/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Dworschak (13 February 2010). "[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,677537,00.html Communicating with those trapped within their brains]". ''Der Spiegel''.&lt;/ref&gt; Novella attributed Laureys' prior error to likely insufficient experience with facilitated communication.&lt;ref name=hoax /&gt;

'''''Seeds of Hope: HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia''''' is a set of five [[documentary]] films about individuals and organizations working to break the silence, lift the stigma and prevent the spread of [[HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia]].   The films focus on activists, family members, humanitarian groups, and health care professionals, all acting as advocates for awareness.  The films were directed by filmmaker, [[Dorothy Fadiman]]. The films are in [[Amharic]] with English subtitles.

The five films in the series are:  "From Risk to Action: Women &amp; HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia (2006)," "Breaking the Silence: Lifting the Stigma of HIV/AIDS (2006),"
"Stepping Forward: Men Teaching and Learning about HIV/AIDS (2006)," "HIV/AIDS Awareness: Approaches to Prevention (2006)," and "Whose Children Are They Now?: AIDS Orphans in Ethiopia (2006)."

==From Risk to Action: Women &amp; HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia (2006)==
This film examines the gender bias and the biology of transmission in Ethiopia which makes women more vulnerable than men to become infected.  This film profiles the connection between gender and HIV/AIDS, as well as the work of leaders in education and policy change to improve the status of women.

==Breaking the Silence: Lifting the Stigma of HIV/AIDS (2006)==
This film documents [[HIV-positive people]], who speak out despite the risk of social stigma and become active in their communities, working to reduce discrimination and secure better services. This film details their stories and profiles groups that provide counseling, income support, and prevention education.

==Stepping Forward: Men Teaching and Learning about HIV/AIDS (2006)==
This film examines certain populations of men, such as truck drivers and soldiers, who suffer high rates of infection.  The film details the intensive education programs in Ethiopia to reach such individuals to heighten their awareness of safer sex practices.

==HIV/AIDS Awareness: Approaches to Prevention (2006)==
This film follows Ethiopians who are working to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS through education, communication through radio, television, and print media. The film also chronicles preventive education through street theater, coffee ceremonies, and funeral gatherings. The film features a home video of the wedding of [[Alebachew Teka]], who included many HIV-positive children as honored guests.

==Whose Children Are They Now?: AIDS Orphans in Ethiopia (2006)==
The AIDS epidemic has left more than one million children without parents in Ethiopia. This film explores the stories of compassionate caregivers and the young people for whom they care.

Also included in this database are links to relevant databases containing information about target function, sequence, 3D structure, ligand binding properties, [[enzyme]] nomenclature and drug structure, therapeutic class, clinical development status.&lt;ref name="pmid19933260" /&gt;

==Content==
This database currently contains 2,025 targets, including 364 successful, 286 clinical trial, 44 discontinued and 1,331 research targets, 17,816 drugs, including 1,540 approved, 1,423 clinical trial, 14,853 experimental drugs and 3,681 multi-target agents (14,170 small molecules and 652 antisense drugs with available structure or oligonucleotide sequence). Targets and drugs in this database cover 61 protein biochemical class and 140 drug therapeutic classes respectively.&lt;ref name="pmid11752352"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen X, Ji ZL, Chen YZ | title = TTD: Therapeutic Target Database. | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 412–5 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11752352 | doi = 10.1093/nar/30.1.412 | pmc = 99057 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Target validation data==
In the 2011 version of TTD, target validation information has been integrated. Target validation normally requires the determination that the target is expressed in the disease-relevant cells/tissues, it can be directly modulated by a drug or drug-like molecule with adequate potency in biochemical assay, and that target modulation in cell and/or animal models ameliorates the relevant disease phenotype.&lt;ref name="pmid14526386"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lindsay MA. | title = Target discovery. | journal = Nature Reviews Drug Discovery | volume = 2 | issue = 10 | pages = 831–8 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14526386 | doi = 10.1038/nrd1202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19646923"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vidalin O, Muslmani M, Estienne C, Echchakir H, Abina AM | title = In vivo target validation using gene invalidation, RNA interference and protein functional knockout models: it is the time to combine. | journal = Current Opinion in Pharmacology | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 669–76 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19646923 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2009.06.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, TTD collects three types of target validation data: experimentally determined potency of drugs against their primary target or targets, observed potency or effects of drugs against disease models (cell-lines, ex-vivo, in-vivo models) linked to their primary target or targets, and the observed effects of target knockout, knockdown, RNA interference, transgenetic, antibody or antisense treated in-vivo models. Currently, TTD provides complete or partial validation information for 932 targets (351 successful, 252 clinical trial, 34 discontinued and 295 research targets). All validation information can be retrieved from Target Validation Page.

==Quantitative structure-activity relationship models against specific target==
Knowledge of developed QSAR models for different molecular scaffolds active against different targets is highly useful for facilitating further drug development and lead optimisation efforts.&lt;ref name="pmid20337590"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sprous DG, Palmer RK, Swanson JT, Lawless M | title = QSAR in the pharmaceutical research setting: QSAR models for broad, large problems. | journal = Curr Top Med Chem | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 619–37 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20337590 | doi=10.2174/156802610791111506}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19569715"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mittal RR, McKinnon RA, Sorich MJ | title = Comparison data sets for benchmarking QSAR methodologies in lead optimization. | journal = J.

These QSAR models can be accessed in Target-based QSAR Models Page.

==Multi-target agents==
Multi-target agents directed at selected multiple targets have been increasingly explored for enhanced therapeutic efficacies, improved safety profiles, and reduced resistance activities by simultaneously modulating the activity of a primary target and the counteractive elements.&lt;ref name="pmid15688074"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keith CT, Borisy AA, Stockwell BR | title = Multicomponent therapeutics for networked systems. | journal = Nature Reviews Drug Discovery | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 71–8 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15688074 | doi=10.1038/nrd1609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16731745"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smalley KS, Haass NK, Brafford PA, Lioni M, Flaherty KT, Herlyn M | title = Multiple signaling pathways must be targeted to overcome drug resistance in cell lines derived from melanoma metastases. | journal = Mol.

Wisdom teeth commonly affect other teeth as they develop, [[impacted wisdom teeth|becoming impacted]]. They are often [[Dental extraction|extracted]] when or even before this occurs.

===Variation===
[[Agenesis]] of wisdom teeth differs by population, ranging from practically zero in [[Aboriginal Tasmanians]] to nearly 100% in [[Indigenous peoples in Mexico|indigenous Mexicans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11220165 |year=1999 |last1=Rozkovcová |first1=E. |last2=Marková |first2=M. |last3=Dolejší |first3=J. |title=Studies on agenesis of third molars amongst populations of different origin |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=71–84 |journal=Sborník lékařský}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0162070 research paper] with world map showing prevalence).

==Function==
{{See also|Human vestigiality}}

Wisdom teeth are [[vestigial]] third molars that helped human ancestors to grind plant tissue. It is thought that the skulls of human ancestors had larger jaws with more teeth, which possibly helped to chew foliage to compensate for a lack of ability to efficiently digest the [[cellulose]] that makes up a plant cell wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cooper|first1=Rachele|title=Why Do We Have Wisdom Teeth?|url=http://scienceline.org/2007/02/ask-cooper-wisdomteeth/|website=Scienceline.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503040129/http://scienceline.org/2007/02/ask-cooper-wisdomteeth/|archivedate=2016-05-03|date=February 5, 2007|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the advent of agriculture over 10,000 years ago, soft human diets became the norm, including carbohydrate and high energy foods. Such diets typically result in jaws growing with less forward growth than our paleolithic ancestors and not enough room for the wisdom teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=von Cramon-Taubadel|first=Noreen|date=2011-12-06|title=Global human mandibular variation reflects differences in agricultural and hunter-gatherer subsistence strategies|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=108|issue=49|pages=19546–19551|doi=10.1073/pnas.1113050108|issn=0027-8424|pmc=3241821|pmid=22106280|bibcode=2011PNAS..10819546V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wisdom teeth (often notated clinically as '''M3''' for third molar) have long been identified as a source of problems and continue to be the most commonly impacted teeth in the human mouth. The oldest known impacted wisdom tooth belonged to a European woman of the [[Magdalenian]] period (18,000–10,000 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Magdalenian Girl is a woman and therefore has oldest recorded case of impacted wisdom teeth |publisher=[[Field Museum of Natural History]] |date=March 7, 2006 |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-03/fm-mgi030206.php |accessdate=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lack of room to allow the teeth to erupt results in a risk of periodontal disease and [[dental caries|dental cavities]] that increases with age.&lt;ref name="Gintaras"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=3886113 | title=Mandibular Third Molar Impaction: Review of Literature and a Proposal of a Classification (review)| journal=J Oral Maxillofac Res |date=Apr–Jun 2013 | volume=4 | issue=2 | pages=e1 |doi=10.5037/jomr.2013.4201| pmid=24422029| last1=Juodzbalys| first1=Gintaras| last2=Daugela| first2=Povilas}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Less than 2% of adults age 65 years or older maintain the teeth without cavities or periodontal disease and 13% maintain unimpacted wisdom teeth without cavities or periodontal disease.&lt;ref name="Marciani"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Is there pathology associated with asymptomatic third molars (review) | author=Marciani RD | journal=J Oral Maxillofac Surg | year=2012 | volume=70 | issue=Suppl 1 |pages=15–19 | doi=10.1016/j.joms.2012.04.025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although formally known as third molars, the common name is wisdom teeth because they appear so late – much later than the other teeth, at an age where people are presumably "wiser" than as a child, when the other teeth erupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year= 1989|title = Wisdom tooth|encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-861186-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term probably came as a translation of the [[Latin]] ''dens sapientiae''. Their eruption has been known to cause dental issues for millennia; it was noted at least as far back as Aristotle:

{{Quote |text=The last teeth to come in man are molars called 'wisdom-teeth', which come at the age of twenty years, in the case of both sexes. Cases have been known in women upwards of eighty years old where at the very close of life the wisdom-teeth have come up, causing great pain in their coming; and cases have been known of the like phenomenon in men too. This happens, when it does happen, in the case of people where the wisdom-teeth have not come up in early years. |author=Aristotle |title=The History of Animals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Aeterna Press |page=49  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P-h5CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT49 |author=Aristotle |others=Translated by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson |year=2015 |title=The History of Animals}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nonetheless, molar impaction was relatively rare prior to the modern era. With the [[Industrial Revolution]], the affliction became ten times more common, owing to the new prevalence of soft, [[Convenience food|processed, and sugary foods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.osu.edu/what-teeth-reveal-about-the-lives-of-modern-humans/|title=What teeth reveal about the lives of modern humans|work=What teeth reveal about the lives of modern humans|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;
