      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3453">The '''6-15-99 Club''' was an organization dedicated to assisting the plight of the poor in [[New York City]] in the 1890s. The group formed branch clubs in stores, factories, and banks, expanding at a rapid rate. Employed members were expected to contribute between a penny and two and a half cents to the club daily.&lt;ref name=eight/&gt; William De Hertburn (W. d'H.) Washington, of 145 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], and prominent [[Manhattan]] businessmen envisioned raising around $13,000 daily. [[Isidor Straus]], [[Oswald Ottendorfer]], and former New York City mayor [[Franklin Edson]] were proponents of the 6-15-99 Club.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. (January 10, 1894) "New Scheme To Raise Money", ''[[The New York Times]]'', p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In February 1894 plans were being made to open a 6-15-99 store at [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]] near [[5th Avenue (Manhattan)|5th Avenue]]. This site was to be used as an office intended to find employment for persons who desired to work. Tasks assigned to job seekers included furniture repair and basic carpentry work. The 6-15-99 Club asked that persons who needed such services, make their requests either at the 14th Street store or at 145 Broadway. An additional store was anticipated to open at [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th Street]]. By April 1894 there were 270 branches of the 6-15-99 Club.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. (April 8, 1894) "To Make More Money For The Poor", ''[[The New York Times]]'', p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 1894 the 6-15-99 Club had secured employment for a number of women who worked making quality garments for children. Sizable
retail stores accepted the items manufactured by the women, so that a portion of the work performed by the 6-15-99 Club was self-supporting.&lt;ref name=eight&gt;Staff. (February 1, 1894) "6-15-99 Club Is Growing" ''[[The New York Times]]'', p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The free labor bureau of the 6-15-99 Club obtained work for 105 applicants in one week.&lt;ref&gt;"The Unemployed In American Cities", ''[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]'' (1894) Volume 8, p.467&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a periodical from 1894, the 6-15-99 Club was one of seven contemporary and highly advertised funds for the temporary relief of the destitute. The others were those organized by [[Tammany Hall]], New York City officials and employees, the World's Bread Fund, the ''[[New York Herald]]'''s Free Clothing Fund, the Christian Herald Fund, and the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' Coal and Food Fund.

In 1894, the ''Journal of Social Science'' questioned the sincerity of the funds, stating that they were "managed at the caprice of their projectors", and stated that the City of New York made no increase in its appropriations to its Board of Charities and Correction in 1894, except for a small amount for coal. However, it reported that the city possessed funds totaling $2,414,283 which could have been provided to needy persons in most years. If distributed among the 50,000 people who qualified for relief, this would have averaged out to $48.30 per person. The  totals took into account half of the migrant and homeless people which the journal described as ''exceptional excess'' for 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Kellogg,  Charles D. (1894) "The Situation In New York City The Winter Of 1893-1894" ''Journal of Social Science'', volume 32, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Albanian sworn virgins''' ({{lang-sq|burrnesha}}) are [[Albanians|Albanian]] women who take a vow of [[chastity]] and wear male clothing in order to live as men in the [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] northern Albanian society. National Geographic's ''[[Taboo (2002 TV series)|Taboo]]'' estimated that there are fewer than 102 [[celibacy|sworn virgins]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/taboo/0330/Overview |title=National Geographic's Taboo |publisher=natgeo.com |accessdate=2009-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117232432/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/taboo/0330/Overview |archivedate=2010-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other terms for the sworn virgin include ''vajzë e betuar'' (most common today, and used in situations in which the parents make the decision when the girl is a baby or child), ''mashkull'' (present-day, used around Shkodra), ''virgjineshë'', ''virgjereshë'', ''verginesa'', ''virgjin'', ''vergjinesha'', ''Albanian virgin'', ''avowed virgin'', ''sadik'' (Turkish: honest, just).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Antonia|title="Sworn Virgins": Cases of Socially Accepted Gender Change|journal=Anthropology of East Europe Review|date=December 2010|url=http://scholarworks.dlib.indiana.edu/journals/index.php/aeer/article/viewFile/687/780|pages=59–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The tradition of sworn virgins in Albania developed out of the [[Kanun (Albania)|''Kanuni i Lekë Dukagjinit'']] ({{lang-en|The Code of Lekë Dukagjini}}, or simply the ''Kanun''),&lt;ref&gt;From [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''Kanun'', which means law. It is originally derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] kanôn / κανών as in [[Canon law|Canon Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; a set of codes and laws developed by [[Lekë Dukagjini]] and used mostly in northern [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]] from the 15th century until the 20th century. The ''Kanun'' is not a religious document&amp;nbsp;– many groups follow it, including [[Albanian Orthodox]], [[Catholics]] and [[Muslim]]s.&lt;ref name="Associated_Press_2008"&gt;{{cite web |date=October 6, 2008 |url =https://www.welt.de/english-news/article2536539/Tradition-of-sworn-virgins-dying-out-in-Albania.html|title = Tradition of sworn virgins' dying out in Albania|publisher = [[Die Welt]]| accessdate = 2008-10-22 | last=Becatoros |first=Elena | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081026144717/http://www.welt.de/english-news/article2536539/Tradition-of-sworn-virgins-dying-out-in-Albania.html| archivedate= October 26, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Kanun'' dictates that families must be patrilineal (meaning wealth is inherited through a family's men) and patrilocal (upon marriage, a woman moves into the household of her husband's family).&lt;ref name="jolique"&gt;{{cite web |year=2008 |url = http://www.jolique.com/gender/crossing_boundaries.htm|title = Crossing Boundaries:Albania's sworn virgins|publisher = jolique| accessdate = 2008-10-07 | last= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081018221818/http://www.jolique.com/gender/crossing_boundaries.htm| archivedate= 18 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women are treated like property of the family. Under the ''Kanun'' women are stripped of many rights. They cannot smoke, wear a watch, or vote in their local elections. They cannot buy land, and there are many jobs they are not permitted to hold. There are also establishments that they cannot enter.&lt;ref name="Associated_Press_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington_Post_2007"&gt;{{cite news |date=August 11, 2007|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/10/AR2007081002158.html|title = The Sacrifices of Albania's 'Sworn Virgins'|work = [[The Washington Post]]| accessdate = 2008-10-07 | last=Zumbrun |first=Joshua}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of sworn virginhood was first reported by missionaries, travelers, geographers and anthropologists who visited the mountains of northern Albania in the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="Elsie 2010 435"&gt;{{cite book|last=Elsie|first=Robert|title=Historical Dictionary of Albania|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham|isbn=0810861887|page=435|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
A woman becomes a sworn virgin by swearing an irrevocable oath, in front of twelve village or tribal elders, to practice celibacy. Then she is allowed to live as a man and may dress in male clothes, use a male name, carry a gun, smoke, drink alcohol, take on male work, act as the head of a household (for example, living with a sister or mother), play music and sing, and sit and talk socially with men.&lt;ref name="Washington_Post_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsie 2010 435"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray 1997 198"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Stephen O.|title=Islamic Homosexualities: Culture, History, and Literature|year=1997|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0814774687|page=198|author2=Roscoe, Will |author3=Allyn, Eric }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A woman can become a sworn virgin at any age, either to satisfy her parents or herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Magrini|editor-first=Tullia|title=Music and Gender: Perspectives from the Mediterranean|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226501655|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sworn virgin is believed to be the only formal, socially defined [[trans man|trans masculine]] [[transgender]] and [[cross-dressing]] role in Europe. Similar practices occurred in some societies of  [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]].&lt;ref name="Elsie 2010 435"/&gt;

Breaking the vow was once punishable by death, but it is doubtful that this punishment is still carried out.&lt;ref name="Washington_Post_2007"/&gt; Many sworn virgins today still refuse to go back on their oath because their community would reject them for breaking the vows.&lt;ref name="Washington_Post_2007"/&gt; However, it is sometimes possible to take back the vows if the sworn virgin has finished her obligations to the family and the reasons or motivations which lead her to take the vow no longer exist.

== Motivations ==
There are many reasons why a woman would have wanted to take this vow, and observers have recorded a variety of motivations. One woman said she became a sworn virgin in order to not be separated from her father, and another in order to live and work with her sister. Some hoped to avoid a specific unwanted marriage, and others hoped to avoid marriage in general.

Becoming a sworn virgin was the only way for women whose families had committed them as children to an [[arranged marriage]] to refuse to fulfil it, without dishonouring the groom's family and risking ''[[gjakmarrja]]'' (blood feud). It was the only way a woman could inherit her family's wealth, which was particularly important in a society in which blood feuds resulted in the deaths of many male Albanians, leaving many families without male heirs. (However, [[anthropologist]] [[Mildred Dickemann]] suggests this motive may be "over-pat", pointing out that a non-child-bearing woman would have no heirs to inherit after her, and also that in some families not one but several daughters became sworn virgins, and in others the later birth of a brother did not end the sworn virgin's masculine role.&lt;ref name="Murray 1997 198"/&gt;) It is also likely that many women chose to become sworn virgins simply because it afforded them much more freedom than would otherwise have been available in a patrilineal culture in which women were secluded, sex-segregated, required to be virgins before marriage and faithful afterwards, betrothed as children and married by sale without their consent, continually bearing and raising children, constantly physically labouring, and always required to defer to men, particularly their husbands and fathers, and submit to being beaten.&lt;ref name="Associated_Press_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsie 2010 435"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray 1997 198"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marriage"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3137518.ece | title = 'Sworn virgins' dying out as Albanian girls reject manly role | author = [[David Wolman|Wolman, David]] | publisher = TimesOnline | date = January 6, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-10-08 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080906104957/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3137518.ece| archivedate= 6 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sworn virgins could also participate in blood feuds. If a sworn virgin was killed in a blood feud her death counted as a full life for the purposes of calculating [[blood money (restitution)|blood money]], rather than the half a life ordinarily accorded for a female death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last2=Swenson|editor-first1=Sarah M. |editor-last1=Anderson |editor-first2= Karen|title=Cold Counsel: Women in Old Norse Literature and Mythology: A collection of essays|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0815319665|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dickemann suggests their mothers may have played an important role in persuading women to become sworn virgins. A widow without sons has traditionally had few options in Albania: she could return to her birth family, stay on as a servant in the family of her deceased husband, or remarry. With a son or surrogate son, she could live out her life in the home of her adulthood, in the company of her child. Murray quotes testimony recorded by [[René Gremaux]]: "Because if you get married I'll be left alone, but if you stay with me, I'll have a son." On hearing those words Djurdja [the daughter] "threw down her embroidery" and became a man.&lt;ref name="Murray 1997 198"/&gt;

== Prevalence ==

The practice has died out in Dalmatia and Bosnia, but is still carried out in northern Albania and to a lesser extent in Macedonia.&lt;ref name="Elsie 2010 435"/&gt;

The [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania]] did not encourage women to become sworn virgins. Women started gaining legal rights and came closer to having equal social status, especially in the central and southern regions. It is only in the northern region that many families are still traditionally patriarchal.&lt;ref name="smh_June_27_2008"&gt;{{cite web |date=June 27, 2008|url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/women-have-to-swap-genders-to-survive/2008/06/26/1214472673664.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1|title = At home with Albania's last sworn virgins|work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]| accessdate = 2008-10-07 | last= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently there are between forty and several hundred sworn virgins left in Albania, and a few in neighboring countries. Most are over fifty years old.&lt;ref name="Associated_Press_2008"/&gt; It used to be believed that the sworn virgins had all but died out after 50 years of communism in Albania, but recent research suggests that may not be the case;&lt;ref name="Elsie 2010 435"/&gt; instead, the increase in feuding following the collapse of the communist regime could encourage a resurgence of the practice.&lt;ref name="Murray 1997 198"/&gt;

==In popular culture ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17371">'''Alejandro''' "'''Alex'''" '''Guerrero''' (born 1965)&lt;ref name=GlobeWhoAG/&gt; is an American [[alternative medicine]] practitioner and [[alkaline diet]] advocate. He is best known for his [[infomercials]] that contained false health claims and his work with [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional football]] players including [[Tom Brady]] and other members of the [[New England Patriots]].

==Education and early career ==

Guerrero received a [[master's degree]] in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] from Samra University in [[Los Angeles, California]], an institution that closed in 2010 after the state of California dissolved the Bureau of Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education board in 2007, which had provided the school's accreditation.&lt;ref name=BostonMag/&gt;&lt;ref name=Balance&gt;{{cite book |title=In Balance for Life: Understanding &amp; Maximizing Your Body's pH Factor |first=Alex |last=Guerrero |publisher=[[Square One Publishers|Square One]] |date=November 15, 2004 |isbn=978-0757002649}} (Aspects sourced to Introduction and About the Author sections).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://samra.edu/ |title=Previously Samra University of Oriental Medicine |website=Former Samra University of Oriental Medicine ''official website'' |access-date=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating, Guerrero opened his own health treatment practice in 1996, and soon began working with individual professional athletes.&lt;ref name=Stripped/&gt;

==2004 book==

In 2004, Guerrero wrote a book called ''In Balance for Life: Understanding &amp; Maximizing Your Body's pH Factor''. The book promoted what he called a "nutritional supplement program that will take your health to the next level", with a "14-Day Diet Plan to quick-start your journey to vibrant vitality".&lt;ref name=Balance/&gt; In the book, he said the principles of the program were "easy to understand, and even easier to implement", and said "In fact, the principles that support it have been scientifically verified time and time again by researchers throughout the world. For the most part, however, they remain all but ignored by conventional and alternative health-care providers alike. As a result, our society is increasingly burdened with health-care problems."&lt;ref name=Balance/&gt; The book referred to "the important role that the pH Factor plays in health and overall balance of the body" and said that "unhealthy pH levels―a disruption of proper acid-alkaline balance―are at the root of all disease conditions".&lt;ref name=Balance/&gt;

==Infomercials and sanctioning by the FTC==

In 2005, Guerrero was sanctioned by the [[U.S. Federal Trade Commission]] for falsely presenting himself as a doctor and claiming to be able to cure cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, and Parkinson's disease using a [[dietary supplement]] called "Supreme Greens".&lt;ref name=BostonMag&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Boston Magazine]] |url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2015/10/09/tom-brady-alex-guerrero-neurosafe/ |title=Tom Brady's Personal Guru Is a Glorified Snake-Oil Salesman |first=Chris |last=Sweeney |date=October 9, 2015 |access-date=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had made these claims in [[infomercials]] on [[Spike TV]] and the [[Women's Entertainment]] channel.&lt;ref name=BostonMag/&gt; He claimed to have conducted extensive scientific studies of the benefits of his program with 200 patients that had been diagnosed as terminally ill before his treatments, but he later admitted that no such studies existed.&lt;ref name=BostonMag/&gt; The FTC fined him and barred him for life from ever again presenting himself as a doctor or from ever again marketing Supreme Greens or any substantially similar product as an effective treatment for any disease.&lt;ref name=BostonMag/&gt; [[Barrie Cassileth|Barrie Cassileth, Ph.D.]], the founder of the Integrative Medicine Service at the [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center]], who helped in the FTC investigation, referred to his practices as "just out and out quackery".&lt;ref name=BostonMag/&gt; She said that a major danger of such useless treatments is that they may delay patients from seeking proper [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based medical care]], and that "this is fatal for many patients".&lt;ref name=BostonMag/&gt; She said "The organizations and people who make these claims and produce these false treatments really are doing something horrific."&lt;ref name=BostonMag/&gt;

He later founded a new company called 6 Degree Nutrition, which marketed various nutritional supplements including a product called Neurosafe. Neurosafe was called "a seatbelt for your brain", and was claimed to protect its users "from the consequences of sports-related traumatic brain injury". The product was advertised as being endorsed by prominent professional football players that had experienced concussions, with a claim that "When used consistently, NeuroSafe helps to dramatically improve recovery from head trauma by providing the brain the nutrients it needs to repair itself."&lt;ref name=BostonMag/&gt; [[Wes Welker]], a [[wide receiver]] who had suffered repeated concussions, was quoted as saying "NeuroSafe is essential. It keeps me safe. I've seen what concussions do to people. With NeuroSafe I know it's protecting what my helmet can't."&lt;ref name=BostonMag/&gt; Champion quarterback [[Tom Brady]] was quoted saying "NeuroSafe makes me feel comfortable that if I get a concussion I can recover faster and more fully. There is no other solution on the market today that can do what NeuroSafe does. It's that extra level of protection that gives me comfort when I'm out on the field."&lt;ref name=BostonMag/&gt; The FTC intervened again in 2012, reaching a settlement with Guerrero that resulted in closure of the company and the cessation of the marketing of the product.&lt;ref name=BostonMag/&gt;&lt;ref name=Investigated&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2015/12/19/tb12-investigated/ |title=Tom Brady's TB12 Center Was Investigated by State Agencies |first=Chris |last=Sweeney |work=Boston Magazine |date=December 19, 2015 |access-date=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reported that Guerrero also had "a long history of financial troubles, bankruptcies, and legal entanglements".&lt;ref name=GlobeWhoAG/&gt; He was sued twice for allegedly defrauding investors in his health product business enterprises of hundreds of thousands of dollars in investment funds, and resolved the cases with settlements under undisclosed terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2015/10/23/tom-brady-alex-guerrero-fraud/ |title=Tom Brady's Guru Was Twice Sued for Fraud |first=Chris |last=Sweeney |website=Boston Magazine |date=October 23, 2015 |access-date=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work with football players==

Guerrero has treated a number of [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional football]] players, and is especially closely associated with [[Tom Brady]], a [[quarterback]] for the [[New England Patriots]]. Brady refers to Guerrero as his "body coach" and "body engineer", and has said Guerrero "has been a huge part of what I do" and is a "huge, huge reason why I'm still playing".&lt;ref name=GlobeWhoAG/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stripped/&gt; In addition to Brady, Guerrero has worked with nearly every player for the Patriots, particularly including [[Danny Amendola]], [[Jacoby Brissett]], [[Julian Edelman]], [[Jimmy Garoppolo]], [[Rob Gronkowski]], [[Duron Harmon]], [[Chris Hogan (American football)|Chris Hogan]], [[Ty Law]], and [[Willie McGinest]].&lt;ref name=Balance/&gt;&lt;ref name=BradyEnds&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/tom-brady-ends-press-conference-early-after-question-about-julian-edelman-and-alex-guerrero/ar-BBLbfiF |title=Tom Brady ends press conference early after question about Julian Edelman and Alex Guerrero |via=[[MSN]] |work=[[USA Today]] |date=July 28, 2018 |access-date=July 30, 2018 |first=Lorenzo |last=Reyes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2017/07/31/rob-gronkowski-has-reportedly-been-following-the-tb12-method |title=Rob Gronkowski has reportedly been following the TB12 method |first=Nicole |last=Yang |work=Boston.com |date=July 31, 2017 |access-date=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/patriots/2017/07/guregian_rob_gronkowski_adopting_training_program_of_tom_brady_and_his_guru |title=Rob Gronkowski adopting training program of Tom Brady and his guru |first=Karen |last=Guregian |work=[[The Boston Herald]] |date=July 31, 2017 |access-date=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AroundNFL&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/patriots/2017/08/17/around-nfl-qbs-are-training-and-eating-tom-brady-way/2hpOwhcZZmIBPYLXtArfkN/story.html |title=Around the NFL, QBs are training and eating the Tom Brady way |first=Ben |last=Volin |work=The Boston Globe |date=August 17, 2017 |access-date=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In December 2017, it was estimated that Guerrero was treating about 20 of the current Patriots players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonsportsjournal.com/2017/12/20/much-concern-alex-guerrerobill-belichick-rift-patriots/ |work=Boston Sports Journal |first=Greg A. |last=Bedard |date=December 20, 2017 |title=How much of a concern is this Alex Guerrero/Bill Belichick rift for the Patriots? |access-date=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dietary and training techniques espoused by Guerrero and Brady have also been influential with other NFL players outside of the Patriots.&lt;ref name=AroundNFL/&gt;
As in Guerrero's 2004 book, aspects of Guerrero's dietary guidelines are phrased in terms of [[pH balance]], with Brady saying he has a primarily [[alkaline diet]] that is 80 percent [[alkaline]] and 20 percent [[acidic]].&lt;ref name=BostonMag/&gt;&lt;ref name=AroundNFL/&gt; The diet is mostly [[vegan]] while avoiding foods that are claimed to cause inflammation, including tomatoes, peppers, mushrooms, and eggplants.&lt;ref name=AroundNFL/&gt;

Earlier in his career, Guerrero also worked with [[LaDainian Tomlinson]] and [[Keenan McCardell]] of the [[San Diego Chargers]].&lt;ref name=Balance/&gt;

Guerrero and Brady have become collaborators and business partners in various ventures branded as "TB12" (with "TB" being the initials for Tom Brady, and 12 his jersey number as a player for the Patriots). Together they created a peak performance website TB12Sports.com and opened a facility in 2013 called the TB12 Sports Therapy Center next to [[Gillette Stadium]], the home of the New England Patriots.&lt;ref name=BostonMag/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stripped/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2017/07/26/tom-brady-new-england-patriots-tb12-method |title=Living Like Tom: One Sports Illustrated Writer Takes On the TB12 Method |first=Greg |last=Bishop |date=July 26, 2017 |access-date=July 30, 2018 |work=[[Sports Illustrated]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guerrero helped Brady develop a health program that Brady wrote about in a 2017 book, ''[[TB12|The TB12 Method]]''. Guerrero and Brady also developed "The TB12 Nutrition Manual", a line of TB12-branded snacks, protein bars, and prepared meals, and a line of TB12 workout gear and clothing (including "recovery pajamas" that are said to help the wearer recover from physical exertion and trauma).&lt;ref name=GlobeWhoAG/&gt;&lt;ref name=AroundNFL/&gt; The practices of Guerrero and the TB12 Center were investigated by several Massachusetts state agencies in 2013, but the agencies took no enforcement action, partly due to regulatory exceptions granted for work that was considered [[massage therapy]].&lt;ref name=Investigated/&gt; In 2014, after an allegation that he was practicing [[physical therapy]] without a license, he was sent a letter instructing him to abide by state regulations when supervising the work of licensed therapists.&lt;ref name=GlobeWhoAG/&gt;

Although Guerrero has treated many members of the New England Patriots, there has been substantial friction with the Patriots' management and training staff over his involvement, and in December 2017, the head coach [[Bill Belichick]] and the Patriots staff stripped Guerrero of many of his team privileges.&lt;ref name=GlobeWhoAG&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/12/20/who-tom-brady-friend-alex-guerrero/x45YjTMVuEiiEdH3tsX7ZO/story.html |title=Who is Tom Brady's friend Alex Guerrero? |first1=Martin |last1=Finucane |first2=Bob |last2=Hohler |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=December 20, 2017 |access-date=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stripped&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2017/12/21/bill-belichick-alex-guerrero-tom-brady-patriots |title=A closer look at Alex Guerrero’s involvement with the Patriots |work=[[Boston.com]] |date=December 21, 2017 |access-date=July 30, 2018 |first=Nicole |last=Yang}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2017/10/31/10-things-we-learned-from-espns-timely-tom-brady-story-on-nfl-longevity |title=10 things we learned from ESPN's timely story on Tom Brady's longevity |date=October 31, 2017 |access-date=July 30, 2018 |work=Boston.com |first=Hayden |last=Bird}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Jessica Flynn, a specialist in [[sports medicine]] at the [[Lahey Hospital &amp; Medical Center]], criticized Guerrero's practices in 2017, saying that although she truly believes "there is a lot of good going on at TB12", she is troubled that Guerrero has implied that doctors don't really care about the functional outcomes for their athletic patients.&lt;ref name=DoctorAim/&gt; In an otherwise-positive account of one writer's experience, Guerrero had reportedly told his patient that "your surgeon's number one goal is to protect his surgery site. He doesn't care if you ever run again. He doesn't care if you want to climb Mount Everest."&lt;ref name=DoctorAim/&gt; Moreover, Flynn said she is concerned that at TB12 "they continue to profit from non-proven treatments, supplements, and other therapies and none of those profits seem to be invested in studying their efficacy."&lt;ref name=DoctorAim&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/health/2017/05/08/jessica-flynn-alex-guerrero/ |first=Jamie |last=Ducharme |work=Boston Magazine |date=May 8, 2017 |access-date=July 30, 2018 |title=Boston Doctor Takes Aim at Tom Brady's Health Guru}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said "Guerrero functions in a different world than doctors. He doesn't have to prove his therapies work, or even that they are safe."&lt;ref name=DoctorAim/&gt;

In an article on the sports website ''[[Deadspin]]'', the sports writer Tom Ley used even more harsh language. He called Guerrero a "dangerous quack guru" and said "In a just world, Guerrero would be shunned from public life and quickly identified as a scam artist who has preyed on desperate and even dying people when making any attempt to present himself as a credible fitness guru."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://deadspin.com/sports-illustrated-nakedly-shills-for-tom-bradys-danger-1797276280 |first=Tom |last=Ley |title=''Sports Illustrated'' Nakedly Shills For Tom Brady's Dangerous Quack Guru |date=July 26, 2017 |website=[[Deadspin]] |access-date=July 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Guerrero became the subject of inquiries about his association with the receiver [[Julian Edelman]], and Edelman's suspension for using [[performance-enhancing drugs]]. Guerrero issued a statement saying "Here at our facility, we take a natural, holistic, appropriate and, above all, legal approach to training and recovery for all of our clients. And anyone who would suggest otherwise is irresponsible, and just plain wrong."&lt;ref name=BradyEnds/&gt; When a reporter said to Brady that a lot of people thought Edelman's violation might be connected to Guerrero, Brady said "It's just ridiculous. I'm out. See you guys," and abruptly ended the press conference.&lt;ref name=BradyEnds/&gt; Brady reacted similarly a month later when asked about Guerrero in late August. During a weekly interview segment that Brady regularly held with [[WEEI-FM|WEEI]] radio, Brady was asked about whether Guerrero was traveling with the team and about the relationship between Guerrero and team management. Brady said he didn't want to talk in detail about the topic, and when the reporter asked follow-up questions, he said "Yeah. Alright, guys. Have a great day. I'll talk to you later," and hung up the phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/patriots/2018/08/27/tom-brady-radio-interview-alex-guerrero-questions/1108341002/ |title=Tom Brady abruptly ends radio interview after repeated questions about trainer Alex Guerrero |first=Tom |last=Schad |work=[[USA Today]] |date=August 27, 2018 |access-date=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/martin-rogers/2018/08/27/why-does-tom-brady-refuse-answer-questions-alex-guerrero/1113943002/ |title=Why does Tom Brady refuse to answer questions about Alex Guerrero? |first=Martin |last=Rogers |work=[[USA Today]] |date=August 27, 2018 |access-date=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-tom-brady-guerrero-20180827-story.html |title=Tom Brady cuts another interview short after questions about personal trainer Alex Guerrero |first=Chuck |last=Schilken |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=August 27, 2018 |access-date=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that analyses sets of records identified on [[PubMed]], the [[bibliographic database]] of articles from over 5,500 biomedical journals worldwide. While PubMed has its own wide range of search options to identify sets of records relevant to a researchers query it lacks the ability to analyse these sets of records further, a process for which the terms [[text mining]] and  [[drill down]] have been used. Anne O'Tate is able to perform such analysis and can process sets of up to 25,000 PubMed records.&lt;ref name="cite pmid| 18279519"/&gt;

==Description==

Once a set of articles has been identified using Anne O’Tate with its PubMed-like interface and search syntax, the set can be analysed and words and concepts mentioned in specific 'fields' (sections) of PubMed records can be displayed in order of frequency.&lt;ref name="cite pmid| 20333611 "&gt;{{Cite journal

| pmc = 2990277
}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Fields’ which Anne O’Tate can display in this manner are:

===Topics (MeSH)===
This option may help to identify possible [[Medical Subject Headings]]  (known as MeSH terms, but called ‘Topics’ by Anne O’Tate) for a subject for which no corresponding subject heading or ‘entry term’ (cross-references to preferred MeSH term) exists or where PubMed’s automatic mapping process (identifying a MeSH term and including it in a search formulation) fails.

Searching for instance for articles on ‘“Knowledge Transfer”’ (for which no correspending MeSH or entry term exists) will retrieve a set of some 530 studies in PubMed (as of August 2011); Anne O’Tate’s analysis suggests that MeSH terms like "Diffusion of Innovation" or "Information Dissemination" may be suitable additional concepts to retrieve a more ‘sensitive’ (comprehensive) set of references. This method of identifying possible MeSH terms is not available on PubMed.

===Authors===
This option may help with identifying authors who have written frequently about a given subject, or may help with identifying possible experts or peer reviewers

===Journals===

'''Autism Sunday''', also known as the '''International Day of Prayer for [[autism spectrum disorder]]s''', is an event observed annually on the second Sunday of February.

==History==
Autism Sunday was first held in 2002 during Autism Awareness Year in the [[United Kingdom]]. It was initiated by parents and carers [[Ivan Corea (Autism Campaign and Journalist)|Ivan Corea]] and Charika Corea, founders of the [[Autism Awareness Campaign UK]]. Parents of Charin, a teenager with [[autism spectrum disorder]] and a [[communication disorder]], they urged leaders of religious organisations, churches, community groups and world leaders around the globe to speak up for people with autism spectrum disorders.&lt;ref name="Speak Up for Autism"&gt;{{cite web |title= Autism Sunday - Church Leaders Urged to Speak Out (BBC) |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A31933415 |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:London St. Paul's Cathedral.jpg#file|thumb|150px|The first-ever service for Autism Sunday was held at [[St.Paul's Cathedral]], [[London]] in 2002 Autism Awareness Year, UK, initiated by parents and carers [[Ivan Corea (Autism Campaign and Journalist)|Ivan Corea]] and Charika Corea.]]
The first service for autism was held in February 2002 at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in London. Former Education Ministers, peers from the [[House of Lords]], celebrities, writers, broadcasters, and the media joined children and people at St Paul's Cathedral to pray for children and adults with autism spectrum disorders, as well as their parents and caregivers.

In 2008, the first [[Early Day Motion]] on Autism Sunday was tabled in the House of Commons, in the [[Palace of Westminster]]. The motion, EDM 874, was sponsored by [[David Drew (MP)|David Drew]] MP and signed by 71 members of Parliament. It calls on the Government to work with all faith communities in order to reach out to parents, caregivers and people with autism spectrum disorders in local communities, and urges church leaders and community groups of all denominations to engage with people with autism spectrum disorders.&lt;ref name="EDM 874 on Autism Sunday"&gt;{{cite web |title= Autism Sunday - Early Day Motion 874 in the House of Commons (UK Parliament) |url=http://edmi.parliament.uk/edmi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=35050&amp;SESSION=891|year=2008 |accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Prime Minister, [[David Cameron]] extended his personal support for Autism Sunday.&lt;ref name=British&gt;{{cite web |title=Prime Minister David Cameron on Autism Sunday|url=http://autismsunday.blog.co.uk/2011/01/13/prime-minister-david-cameron-on-autism-sunday-10360767/|year=2011 |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate in the House of Commons==
Autism Sunday was mentioned in a debate in the House of Commons in the British Parliament. [[David Taylor (Labour politician)|David Taylor]] MP mentioned the day and called for action stating that the "Churches and other religious organisations will be supporting an international day of prayer for those with autism and Asperger's syndrome. Will the Leader of the House take this as a bid as a topical debate on the issue, which affects hundreds of thousands of people throughout the country? The conditions are under-recognised and under-resourced and they badly need a national strategy, a national task force and a well resourced plan for the future." &lt;ref name="David Taylor MP  on Autism Sunday"&gt;{{cite web |title= David Taylor MP on Autism Sunday in a debate in the House of Commons (UK Parliament) |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080207/debtext/80207-0006.htm|year=2008 |accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In reply, the Leader of the Commons,(at the time) [[Harriet Harman]] MP said: "For many years, families have struggled to support and care for children with autism, often to a great extent on their own and without the proper back-up of integrated services. There is now a great deal more awareness of the difficulties of autism and Asperger’s syndrome, and a recognition of the importance of early diagnosis and integrated services. I congratulate the Churches on picking this for an international day of prayer, and we would like to work with the Churches, local government and the [[voluntary sector]] to ensure that families with a family member who develops autism or Asperger’s have the backing that they need in future." &lt;ref name="Harriet Harman MP on Autism Sunday"&gt;{{cite web |title= Harriet Harman MP, Leader of the Commons on Autism Sunday in a debate in the House of Commons (UK Parliament) |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080207/debtext/80207-0006.htm|year=2008 |accessdate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Churches of all denominations around the world now honor the millions of people with autism on Autism Sunday, the International Day of Prayer for autism spectrum disorders.&lt;ref name=AutismSunday&gt;{{cite web |title= Autism Sunday |url=http://autismsunday.tripod.com/ |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisers estimate there are 60 million people with autism around the world.&lt;ref name=AutismSunday/&gt; Campaigners have said that many suffer without proper public services in education, health, specialist speech therapy and respite care in several parts of the world, particularly in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]. The credit crunch and the global recession which hit many countries in 2008-2009 also affected the Autism Community. In the UK, people were concerned about the cuts to disability benefits and cuts to public services. Homes were re-possessed during the economic downturn and some families below the poverty line had to choose between heating and eating.&lt;ref name=heating&gt;{{cite web |title= MPs call for urgent action on Autism and Winter Fuel Poverty|url=http://www.bloggernews.net/119059 |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-01-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090103191243/http://www.bloggernews.net/119059| archivedate= 3 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

World church leaders have been supporting Autism Sunday. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] told the organisers that he would be praying for the autism community on Autism Sunday.&lt;ref name=Pope&gt;{{cite web |title=Pope to Pray for People with Autism on Autism Sunday 2009 |url=http://autismsunday.blog.co.uk/2009/01/26/pope-to-pray-for-people-with-autism-on-autism-sunday-5453068/|year=2009 |accessdate=2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the largest churches in the United States, including [[Rick Warren]]'s [[Saddleback Church]], have pledged to pray for over 60 million people with autism spectrum disorders on Autism Sunday. Support came from the [[Bishop of London]] in the United Kingdom, Rt.Rev.[[Richard Chartres]].&lt;ref name= World&gt;{{cite web |title=Autism Sunday: World Church Leaders send messages of support|url=http://www.bloggernews.net/119578|year=2009 |accessdate=2009-01-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090202051235/http://www.bloggernews.net/119578| archivedate= 2 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organizers have urged parents, carers and the worldwide Autism Community to use  no Autism Sunday as a platform to lobby and campaign on the serious issues.&lt;ref name= platform&gt;{{cite web |title=Autism Sunday 2011|url=http://autismsunday.blog.co.uk/2011/01/13/autism-sunday-10360182/|year=2011 |accessdate=2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for Autism Sunday 2011 came from the Chilean Miner, Jose Henriquez, the 24th miner to be rescued from the San Jose mine. Henriquez was invited by US President [[Barack Obama]] to address the Presidential Prayer Breakfast in February 2011.

==History==
In the mid-20th century, Jordan (then [[Emirate of Transjordan|Trans-Jordan]]) was noted as a smuggling route, carrying hashish from Turkey, Iran, Lebanon, and Syria into Egypt.&lt;ref name="Plascov2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Avi Plascov|title=The Palestinian Refugees in Jordan 1948-1957|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lzgkDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT117|date=18 May 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-66747-0|pages=117–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FletcherFletcher2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert Fletcher|author2=Robert S.

The '''Chicago Tylenol murders''' were a series of poisoning deaths resulting from [[Tampering (crime)|drug tampering]] in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]] in 1982. The victims had all taken [[Tylenol (brand)|Tylenol-branded]] [[acetaminophen]] capsules that had been laced with [[potassium cyanide]].&lt;ref name="douglas"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of seven people died in the original poisonings, with several more deaths in subsequent [[copycat crime]]s.

These incidents led to reforms in the packaging of [[over-the-counter substance]]s and to federal anti-tampering laws. The actions of [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] to reduce deaths and warn the public of poisoning risks have been widely praised as an exemplary public relations response to such a crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missionmode.com/5-crisis-management-truths-from-the-tylenol-murders/|title=5 Crisis Management Truths from the Tylenol Murders |date=4 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No suspect was ever charged or convicted of the poisonings. New York City resident James William Lewis was considered the prime suspect, and was convicted of [[extortion]] for sending a letter to Johnson &amp; Johnson that took credit for the deaths and demanded $1 million to stop them.

==Incidents==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
On September 29, 1982, twelve-year-old Mary Kellerman of [[Elk Grove Village, Illinois]], died after taking a capsule of Extra-Strength Tylenol.&lt;ref name="PBSNewsHour"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Markel|first1=Howard|title=How the Tylenol murders of 1982 changed the way we consume medication|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/tylenol-murders-1982|website=PBS NewsHour|accessdate=December 6, 2017|date=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adam Janus of [[Arlington Heights, Illinois]], died in the hospital later that day after ingesting Tylenol; his brother Stanley and sister-in-law Theresa, of [[Lisle, Illinois]], later also died after taking Tylenol from the same bottle.&lt;ref name="PBSNewsHour" /&gt; Within the next few days, Mary McFarland of [[Elmhurst, Illinois]], Paula Prince of Chicago, and Mary Reiner of [[Winfield, Illinois|Winfield]] all died in similar incidents.&lt;ref name="douglas2"&gt;Douglas, 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bell"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once it was realized that all these people had recently taken Tylenol, tests were carried out which showed cyanide present in the bottles from which the victims had taken the Tylenol.  Warnings were issued via the media, and patrols using loudspeakers warned residents throughout the Chicago metropolitan area to discontinue use of Tylenol products.

Police, knowing that various sources of Tylenol were tampered with, ruled out manufacturers, as the tampered-with bottles came from different pharmaceutical companies—and the seven deaths had all occurred in the Chicago area, so sabotage during production was ruled out.  Instead, police concluded that they were likely looking for a culprit who was believed to have acquired bottles of Tylenol from various retail outlets.&lt;ref name="PBSNewsHour" /&gt;  Furthermore, they concluded the source was most likely supermarkets and drug stores, over a period of several weeks, with the culprit likely adding the cyanide to the capsules, then methodically returning to the stores to place the bottles back on the shelves.  In addition to the five bottles that led to the victims' deaths, three other tampered-with bottles were later discovered.

In a concerted effort to reassure the public, [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] distributed warnings to hospitals and distributors and halted Tylenol production and advertising. On October 5, 1982, it issued a nationwide [[Product recall|recall]] of Tylenol products; an estimated 31 million bottles were in circulation, with a retail value of over US $100 million ($267 million in 2018).&lt;ref&gt;Emsley, John. ''Molecules of Murder: Criminal Molecular and Classic Cases.'' Cambridge: Royal Society of Chemistry, 2008, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; The company also advertised in the national media for individuals not to consume any of its products that contained [[acetaminophen]] after it was determined that only these capsules had been tampered with. Johnson &amp; Johnson offered to exchange all Tylenol capsules already purchased by the public for solid tablets.

==Investigations==
===Suspects===
During the initial investigations, a man named James William Lewis sent a letter to Johnson &amp; Johnson demanding $1 million to stop the cyanide-induced murders. Police were unable to link him with the crimes, as he and his wife were living in New York City at the time. He was convicted of [[extortion]], served 13 years of a 20-year sentence, and was released in 1995 on parole. [[WCVB]] Channel 5 of Boston reported that court documents, released in early 2009, "show [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] investigators concluded Lewis was responsible for the poisonings, despite the fact that they did not have enough evidence to charge him".  Lewis has consistently denied all responsibility for the poisonings for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |date  = February 12, 2009  |accessdate  = May 12, 2009  |title  = Feds Convinced Lewis Was Tylenol Killer  |publisher  = WCVB-TV  |url  = http://www.thebostonchannel.com/news/18703672/detail.html  |deadurl  = yes  |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20111030094338/http://www.thebostonchannel.com/news/18703672/detail.html  |archivedate  = October 30, 2011  |df  =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ap908"&gt;{{cite news|date  = January 11, 2010| author = Lavoie, Denise

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second man, Roger Arnold, was investigated and cleared of the killings.  He had a [[nervous breakdown]] due to the media attention, which he blamed on Marty Sinclair, a bar owner.  In the summer of 1983, Arnold shot and killed John Stanisha, whom he mistook for Sinclair.  Stanisha was an unrelated man who did not know Arnold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Tylenol Figure Is Convicted| publisher = Associated Press (via ''[[The New York Times]]'')|date= January 15, 1984|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/15/us/tylenol-figure-is-convicted.html?sec=health}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold was convicted in January 1984 and served 15 years of a 30-year sentence for [[second-degree murder]]. He died in June 2008.

In early 1983, at the FBI's request, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' columnist [[Bob Greene]] published the address and grave location of the first and youngest victim, Mary Kellerman. The story, written with the Kellerman family's consent, was proposed by FBI criminal analyst John Douglas on the theory that the perpetrator might visit the house or gravesite if he were made aware of their locations. Both sites were kept under 24-hour surveillance for several months, but the killer did not surface.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, B. ''American Beat''. Penguin Books (1984), pp. 344–50. {{ISBN|0140073205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laurie Dann]], who poisoned and shot people in a May 1988 rampage in and around [[Winnetka, Illinois]], was briefly considered as a suspect, but no direct connection was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mNkVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8RIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3227,6319355&amp;dq=tylenol+laurie+dann&amp;hl=en|title=Tragedy in Winnetka: The Answers Are Few|date= May 25, 1988|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|Milwaukee Sentinel]]|accessdate=December 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ongoing investigations===
In early January 2009, Illinois authorities renewed the investigation. Federal agents searched the home of Lewis in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and seized a number of items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In a written statement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Law Enforcement To Review Tylenol Murders | publisher = CNN |author= Fifis, Fran|date= February 5, 2009|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/02/04/tylenol.murders/index.html|accessdate= March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the FBI explained,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This review was prompted, in part, by the recent 25th anniversary of this crime and the resulting publicity.  Further, given the many recent advances in forensic technology, it was only natural that a second look be taken at the case and recovered evidence.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 2010, both Lewis and his wife submitted DNA samples and fingerprints to authorities.&lt;ref name="ap908" /&gt; Lewis stated "if the FBI plays it fair, I have nothing to worry about".&lt;ref name="ap908" /&gt;

On May 19, 2011, the FBI requested DNA samples from "Unabomber" [[Ted Kaczynski]] in connection to the Tylenol murders. Kaczynski denied having ever possessed potassium cyanide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-19/unabomber-says-fbi-suspects-him-in-1982-tylenol-poisonings.html |title=FBI Wants Unabomber’s DNA for 1982 Tylenol Poisoning Probe | author = Woolner, Ann |date= May 19, 2011 | publisher = [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg News]] | accessdate = May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first four Unabomber crimes happened in Chicago and its suburbs from 1978 to 1980, and Kaczynski's parents had a suburban Chicago home in Lombard, Illinois, in 1982, where he stayed occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20110519/news/705199967/|title=FBI wants to test Unabomber DNA in Tylenol killings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
===Copycats===
Hundreds of [[Copycat crime|copycat attacks]] involving Tylenol, other over-the-counter medications, and other products also took place around the United States immediately following the Chicago deaths.&lt;ref name="PBSNewsHour" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Time2009&gt;{{cite news | url = http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1878063,00.html | title = A Brief History of the Tylenol Poisonings | first = Dan | last = Fletcher | date = February 9, 2009 | work = TIME | access-date = January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Three more deaths occurred in 1986 from tampered gelatin capsules.&lt;ref name=FDA1998&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/98fr/110498a.txt | author = Food and Drug Administration, United States Department of Health and Human Services | title = Tamper-Evident Packaging Requirements for Over-the-Counter Human Drug Products (Final Rule) | journal = Federal Register | date = November 4, 1998 | volume = 63 | issue = 213 | pages = 59463–59471 | access-date = January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A woman died in Yonkers, New York, after ingesting "Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules laced with cyanide".&lt;ref name=NYTimes1986&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/14/nyregion/2d-tainted-bottle-of-tylenol-found-by-investigators.html | title = 2D TAINTED BOTTLE OF TYLENOL FOUND BY INVESTIGATORS | first = Michael | last = Norman

===Johnson &amp; Johnson response===
Johnson &amp; Johnson received positive coverage for its handling of the crisis; for example, an article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said, "Johnson &amp; Johnson has effectively demonstrated how a major business ought to handle a disaster". The article further stated that "this is no [[Three Mile Island accident]] in which the company's response did more damage than the original incident", and applauded the company for being honest with the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = The Washington Post  | author = Jerry Knight | date = October 11, 1982 | title = Tylenol's Maker Shows How to Respond to Crisis | page = WB1 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1982/10/11/tylenols-maker-shows-how-to-respond-to-crisis/bc8df898-3fcf-443f-bc2f-e6fbd639a5a3/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to issuing the recall, the company established relations with the [[Chicago Police Department]], the FBI, and the [[Food and Drug Administration]]. This way it could have a part in searching for the person who laced the capsules and they could help prevent further tamperings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While at the time of the scare the company's market share collapsed from thirty-five percent to eight percent, it rebounded in less than a year, a move credited to the company's prompt and aggressive reaction. In November, it reintroduced capsules but in a new, triple-sealed package, coupled with heavy price promotions and within several years, Tylenol had the highest market share for the over-the-counter [[analgesic]] in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url       = https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/17/business/tylenol-s-rapid-comeback.html

===Pharmaceutical changes===
The 1982 incident inspired the pharmaceutical, food, and consumer product industries to develop [[tamper-resistant packaging]], such as [[induction seal]]s and improved [[quality control]] methods. Moreover, product tampering was made a federal crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url       = http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title18/pdf/USCODE-2010-title18-partI-chap65-sec1365.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new laws resulted in Stella Nickell's conviction in the Excedrin tampering case, for which she was sentenced to ninety years in prison.&lt;ref name="BosGlobe"/&gt;

Additionally, the incident prompted the pharmaceutical industry to move away from capsules, which were easy to contaminate as a foreign substance could be placed inside without obvious signs of tampering. Within the year, the FDA introduced more stringent regulations to avoid product tampering. This led to the eventual replacement of the capsule with the solid "caplet", a tablet made in the shape of a capsule, as a drug delivery form and with the addition of [[tamper-evident]] safety-seals to bottles of many sorts.&lt;ref name="PBSNewsHour"/&gt;

'''Dactylitis''' or '''sausage digit''' is inflammation of an entire digit (a finger or toe),&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|two/000027334|dactylitis}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be painful.

The word dactyl comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word "daktylos" meaning "finger".  In its medical term, it refers to both the fingers and the toes.

==Associated conditions==
Dactylitis can occur in [[spondyloarthropathy|seronegative arthropathies]], such as [[psoriatic arthritis]] and [[ankylosing spondylitis]], and in [[sickle-cell disease]] as result of a vasoocclusive crisis with bone infarcts, and in infectious conditions including [[tuberculosis]], [[syphilis]], and [[leprosy]]. In [[reactive arthritis]], sausage fingers occur due to synovitis.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Stanley Leonard; Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abdul K.; Cotran, Ramzi S.; Fausto, Nelson (2010). "Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease". In Vinay Kumar, Abul K. Abbas, Nelson Fausto. Robbins Pathology Series (Elsevier). p. 205. {{ISBN|978-1-4160-3121-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dactylitis may also be seen with [[sarcoidosis]].

In sickle-cell disease it is manifested for the first time between 6-9 month old infants (as their protective [[fetal hemoglobin]], HbF, is replaced with adult hemoglobin and the disease manifests) and is very often the presenting sign of the disorder.

'''Princess Diana''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing regularly in stories published by [[DC Comics]], as the [[secret identity]] of the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazonian]] [[superhero]] '''[[Wonder Woman]]''', who bought the credentials and identity from a United States Army nurse named Diana Prince who went to South America and married her fiancé to become Diana White. The character debuted in ''[[Sensation Comics]]'' #1 (January 1942) and was created by [[William Moulton Marston|Charles Moulton]] and [[H. G. Peter]].

The fictional career of Diana Prince evolved over the years, from the original Army nurse to becoming a military intelligence officer (promoted to higher ranks), then later a civilian employee, businesswoman, astronaut, or staff member at the United Nations, etc. In the TV series ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'' she was a [[WAVES]] yeoman in the 1940s. Although originally possessing the powers of Wonder Woman at all times, Diana Prince later lost the powers when in her secret identity, and during the 1960s, Wonder Woman lost her powers and functioned only as a non-powered Diana Prince in other adventures.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Overview==
Through the popularity of her [[Wonder Woman]] secret identity, the personality, concept, and name of Diana Prince have become ingrained in popular culture, becoming synonymous with secret identities and innocuous fronts for ulterior motives and activities.

First written in the earliest ''Wonder Woman'' comics, Diana Prince's role was multifaceted. Unlike the [[Superman]] [[secret identity]] of [[Clark Kent]], who was originally little more than a front for Superman's activities, and who adopted a passive "mild-mannered" persona to conceal his underlying strength, Prince's identity functioned both to position Wonder Woman so that she could learn of situations requiring her intervention and to allow the character to embody feminist and other ideals espoused by Charles Moulton. For example, Diana Prince was originally a nurse and then an officer in [[military intelligence]], starting in the typical woman's role of secretary but gradually earning more autonomy, including the authority to interrogate espionage suspects, eventually becoming an intelligence officer in her own right and, over the years, rising from Lieutenant to Major. Although Diana Prince was frequently told not to accompany Trevor at pivotal moments of adventures because it was "no place for a woman", Diana was actually the most competent person to tackle a crisis, whether by exercising her knowledge as Diana Prince or her power as Wonder Woman, riding with an all-girl cavalry of [[Etta Candy]] and the Beeta Lambda sorority. During the 1960s, Wonder Woman lost her powers and functioned exclusively as a non-powered Diana Prince who nonetheless experienced high adventure as a [[Modesty Blaise]]-type character.

==Fictional character biography==

===Golden Age===
Diana Prince was originally the name of a [[United States Army Nurse Corps#World War II|U.S. Army nurse during World War II]] who provided the primary alias for Princess Diana (Wonder Woman) of the Amazons. In January 1942, Princess Diana met Diana Prince, who was sobbing. When Wonder Woman asked her what was wrong, Prince explained that her fiancé, Dan White, was in South America and she lacked the funds to go to him. Noticing how similar they were in appearance, Wonder Woman gave Prince a large amount of money she had just earned from Al Kale's promotion of her bullets and bracelets routine; in exchange, Prince gave Wonder Woman her credentials and name. She later saved Steve from Axis forces.&lt;ref&gt;''Sensation Comics'' #1 (January 1942)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:DrPoisonSen02.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Wonder Woman encounters Dr. Poison while caring for Maj. Steve Trevor as Nurse Diana Prince.]]
When Steve Trevor had fully recovered from injuries sustained in his crash landing on Paradise Island and returned to duty at the [[Office of Strategic Services]], Wonder Woman followed him, pursuing a job as secretary. Maj. Trevor already had a secretary of his own, Lila Brown, but Diana Prince successfully obtained a job as Col. Phil Darnell's secretary. Darnell noted that Diana, as an Army nurse, had the rank of 2nd Lieutenant. For a while, Lila was suspicious of Lt. Diana Prince, who did not seem to use any known system of [[shorthand]] when taking dictation (because Diana was actually relying on her own superior Amazon-trained [[eidetic memory]]) and did not seem to operate as a normal secretary would. Diana learned, to her dismay, that although she was now working alongside Steve Trevor, he only had eyes for Wonder Woman.

The real Diana Prince returned in September 1942, seeking out Wonder Woman. She asked for her identity back so that she could find work to help out her inventor husband Daniel White and their infant child. Wonder Woman agreed, and even impersonated her, so her husband would not know she was getting a job, but soon after, Nazi spies kidnapped Diana and planned to ransom her for one of her husband's inventions, an Anti-Aircraft Disintegrator Shell. Wonder Woman discovered the mastermind behind it was Dr Cue, a developer of diseases and gases. Wonder Woman was tied up and placed in an oven, but escaped after pretending to be knocked out by gas. Diana Prince was taken to where the shells were being tested and fell from the plane bound hand and foot while Cue used a parachute as the shell had disintegrated the plane. Wonder Woman rescued Diana and unmasked Cue, revealing him as Colonel Togo Ku, Chief of Japanese spies in America. Wonder Woman rescued Dan White and apprehended the spies. When the invention proved successful, Diana Prince relinquished her legal name and began referring to herself by her married name Diana White, and Wonder Woman resumed using the Diana Prince identity.&lt;ref&gt;''Sensation Comics'' #9 (September 1942)&lt;/ref&gt;

Diana Prince continued to work in military intelligence, eventually rising to the rank of Major.&lt;ref name="The Hollywood Reporter"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/history-wonder-womans-secret-comic-875364|title=The History of Wonder Woman's Secret Comic Book Identity|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was forced later into the difficult situation of working alongside her true love, Steve Trevor, while Darnell fell for Diana Prince.

When the DC Universe adopted the convention that the Golden Age adventures took place on the parallel world of [[Earth-Two]], it was learned that Wonder Woman eventually gave up her secret identity, married Steve Trevor, and became the mother of Hippolyta "Lyta" Trevor, who became the superheroine [[Fury (DC Comics)|Fury]]. Although she had given up her immortality by marrying Trevor, this Wonder Woman was still aging at a much slower rate than her husband and sometimes met the Earth-1 Wonder Woman.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' #300 (February 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Golden Age redux====
When the Wonder Woman television series debuted, with its first season set in World War II, the comics followed suit, shifting adventures back to that time. Although the DCU multiverse conventions had been set, the parallel world in which the comic adventures took place deviated significantly from the Golden Age stories that had been retroactively set on Earth-Two, following instead the setting of the TV show. The Diana Prince identity, notably, was not an Army nurse-lieutenant but, instead, a [[WAVES]] yeoman, who was secretary for Maj. Trevor and not the commanding officer (Gen. Blankenship, replacing Col. Darnell).

===Silver and Bronze Ages===
Later retellings of the origins of Wonder Woman, of dubious continuity for the [[Earth-One]] Wonder Woman, excluded the story of Wonder Woman purchasing credentials from a real Diana Prince and, instead, showed her creating the identity from scratch. In some versions, the Diana Prince identity was created to become a military intelligence officer, winning the opportunity after competing against several women in a contest of skills, but in others Diana Prince was first a nurse who then followed Steve to military intelligence. In one version, the identity just appears without explanation.

====Diana Prince, the New Wonder Woman====
[[Image:WW179.gif|thumb|upright=1.20|Powerless Diana Prince trains with her mentor I Ching.]]
The change coincided with the switch from longtime editor [[Robert Kanigher]] (who had taken over writing for the character following the death of creator [[William Moulton Marston]] in 1947), to new editor [[Dennis O'Neil]] in ''Wonder Woman'' #178 (dated October 1968). According to the new writer/artist [[Mike Sekowsky]], the reason for the change was: "[T]he sales on the old WW were so bad that the book was going to be dropped. The new Wonder Woman was given a chance -- (a last chance for the book) and it worked!" Diana Prince gave herself a "mod" makeover in order to go undercover when Trevor was accused of being a double-agent. The following issue, the Amazons claimed they needed to leave this world for another dimension in order to "renew their magic", and Diana renounced her powers and Wonder Woman identity in order to remain with Steve. Meanwhile, Steve Trevor was kidnapped by the evil [[Doctor Cyber]], international terrorist. During this adventure, Diana Prince met and befriended blind martial arts expert [[I Ching (comics)|I Ching]], who trained her in Asian martial arts, which Diana as a trained Amazon quickly mastered. When one of Cyber's henchwomen killed Trevor (in issue 180), Diana transitioned into working with Ching to bring down Cyber. Other adventures included sword-and-sorcery missions, supernatural villains, fighting militia sects, and helping people in trouble.

Diana left the military, opening a "mod" boutique in New York City. After rescuing runaway Cathy Perkins, who had been captured by a weird dominatrix gang, she hired Cathy to be her assistant and run the boutique when Diana was called away for adventures. One such adventure saw her being forced back into military service for one case.

The non-powered Diana Prince era ended as abruptly as it had started when Kanigher returned as editor in ''Wonder Woman'' #204 (dated February 1973). A sniper terrorized New York City. He shot and killed a motorist, whose car crashed into a restaurant in which Diana and Ching were enjoying lunch. Ching was killed, and an enraged Diana set off to stop the sniper. Along the way, she suffered a head injury, and the dazed Diana started operating on subconscious urges that compelled her to steal a military aircraft and head for the Bermuda Triangle, where she crashed. When she woke up, she was suffering from amnesia, and she found herself on Paradise Island, where the Amazons restored as many of her memories as possible, although her time as a non-powered adventurer could not be restored completely.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' #209 (January/February 1973)&lt;/ref&gt; The restoration of the superpowered Wonder Woman was inspired, at least in part, by complaints from feminist advocate [[Gloria Steinem]] about the de-powering of the character.&lt;ref&gt;Carol A. Strickland, [http://www.fanzing.com/mag/fanzing37/feature7.shtml "Truly, Modly, Deeply: The Diana Prince Era"], Fanzing, issue 37&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modernizing the classic concepts====
Wonder Woman returned to man's world, adopting the Diana Prince identity again and finding work at the United Nations, first as a translator and guide&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' #204 (January/February 1973)&lt;/ref&gt; and then as an agent for the UN Crisis Bureau, under Morgan Tracy.&lt;ref name="Wonder Woman' 1974"&gt;''Wonder Woman'' #212 (June–July 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; When Steve Trevor was restored to life mystically&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' #223 (April–May 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; (later revealed to be the infusion of the hardy life force of Eros, the love god), he found work at the UN-related Spy-on-Spy service under the alias Steve Howard.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' #225 (August–September 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; Steve and Diana lived and worked together until Steve was kidnapped&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' #247 (September 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; and slain&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' #248 (October 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; by a man obsessed with reviving a demon.

In ''Wonder Woman'' #250, Diana lost the title of Wonder Woman to an amazon rival named Orana.  In spite of her loss, Diana rebelled against the Gods of Olympus and left Paradise Island determined to live her life in her alter ego.  However her super heroine retirement was short lived.  In the following issue, ''Wonder Woman'' #251, Orana, called herself the "New Wonder Woman" and tried to pick up Diana's responsibilities as a heroine.  In Orana's first major battle, the red-haired Wonder Woman was shot and killed by a terrorist named Warhead.  Orana's death allowed Diana to reclaim her role as Wonder Woman once again.  Diana eventually left the UN Crisis Bureau and briefly served as a NASA astronaut in Houston,&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' #251-256&lt;/ref&gt; where she dated fellow astronaut Mike Bailey (later revealed to be operating as Ace of the [[Royal Flush Gang]],&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' #256 (June 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;) before returning to a different UN program.

Still grieving the second death of Steve Trevor, Diana returned to Paradise Island, where her memories of Steve Trevor were erased in a misguided attempt to heal her emotional distress.&lt;ref name=ww270&gt;''Wonder Woman'' #270 (August 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; When a Steve Trevor from a parallel world crashlanded off Paradise Island,&lt;ref name=ww270 /&gt; Aphrodite altered the memories of all the world to allow him to be accepted as the Steve Trevor of this world.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' #271 (September 1980)&lt;/ref&gt; Wonder Woman erased all traces of her previous life as Diana Prince and established a new Diana Prince identity, becoming an Air Force captain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Wonder-Woman-Apparently-Has-An-Official-Job-Batman-V-Superman-115867.html Wonder Woman Apparently Has An Official Job In Batman V Superman]&lt;/ref&gt; (eventually major),&lt;ref name="The Hollywood Reporter"/&gt; serving in the Pentagon as adjutant to Col. Trevor in the Special Assignments Bureau, a special military intelligence program designed to interdict global crises before they develop.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' #272 (October 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

For a while, Diana found herself torn between Steve and Maj. Keith Griggs, who was in love with Diana Prince.

This Diana Prince identity was ended during the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], when an office meeting was interrupted by Hermes, demanding Diana's service to save Paradise Island and Olympus itself. Diana and Steve were married by Zeus himself, before all of history was rewritten by the events of the Crisis on Infinite Earths.

===Post-Crisis===
[[Image:DianaPrinceID.jpg|thumb|left|Diana creates the persona Diane Prince. Art by [[Jill Thompson]].]][[Image:DianaPrinceReveal.jpg|thumb|right|Diana reveals to reporters that she uses the civilian identity of Diana Prince while working at a museum.&lt;br&gt;Art by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].]] After the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' storyline, the history of all DC Comics' characters were erased and restarted anew. When the Wonder Woman comic book was rebooted "Post-Crisis", the Diana Prince identity was not revived, although references to it were occasionally made as a possible name to use for legal purposes.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #7 (August 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Instead Wonder Woman was simply referred to as "Diana of Themyscira" when not in costume. Thus, she had no secret identity and lived openly as an Amazon in everyday life. There were a few times where Wonder Woman did adopt a secret identity but only for undercover operations, such as when she worked beside the assassin [[Deathstroke]]. During that adventure in the Balkan country of Pan Balgravia Diana created the false persona of Diane Prince to hide herself from the country's government spies while trying to rescue an abducted [[Cheetah (comics)|Barbara Minerva]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman Special'' #1 and ''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #63 (June 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Later when Diana worked at the Gateway City Museum with Helena Sandsmark she did publicly use her well-known alias during an on-camera interview with a reporter.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #118 (February 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

When Hippolyta assumed the role of Wonder Woman and traveled back to World War II, she stayed in the home of a Nurse Diana Prince.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #185 (November 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

in 2005, during the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' storyline, Diana as Wonder Woman was forced to kill an unarmed civilian for the first time ever when deranged businessman/spymaster [[Maxwell Lord]] murdered [[Ted Kord]] (Blue Beetle II) and seized mental control of Superman, forcing him to brutally attack Batman. Under the influence of her lasso, Lord told her that the only way to stop him was to kill him; seeing no other alternative, she snapped his neck. The Brother Eye sentient computer satellite transmitted live video of Diana killing Lord to screens all over the world, destroying her reputation and even turning Superman and Batman against her. In the wake of the global hostility this act caused toward her, the Amazon went into a year's exile. This exile ended the viability of her initially intended mission of being an ambassador and teacher of Amazon principles. Once she returned to public life, Diana realized that her life as a full-time celebrity superhero and ambassador had kept her removed from humanity. Because of this she again donned the persona of Diana Prince and became an agent at the Department of Metahuman Affairs, where she was ordered to help capture Wonder Woman. During a later battle with [[Circe (comics)|Circe]], the witch placed a spell on Diana leaving Wonder Woman powerless when in the role of Diana Prince.

===In other media===
[[Image:WhosAfraidOfDianaPrince.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Stills from the pilot presentation 1967]]
The Diana Prince identity has been a feature of almost all significant appearances of Wonder Woman in other media.

The first effort at a [[Wonder Woman (TV series)#Who.27s Afraid of Diana Prince.3F|pilot presentation]] for a television series was based on a comedic conceit that the homely Diana Prince saw herself as a gorgeous Amazon whenever she becomes Wonder Woman—although no one else sees such a change in her looks.

[[Image:Wonder Woman - Crosby.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cathy Lee Crosby as Diana Prince in the pilot movie 1974]]
The [[Wonder Woman (TV series)#Wonder Woman .281974.29|first TV pilot movie]], starring [[Cathy Lee Crosby]], was modeled primarily on the mod Diana Prince era and featured Crosby as Diana Prince, secretary to [[Office of Strategic Services]] (O.S.S) Major Steve Trevor, but secretly operating on her own as an agent known to some as "Wonder Woman".

The ''[[Super Friends]]'' animated series included at least one episode featuring Diana Prince spinning to become Wonder Woman.

The most significant appearance to date has been the [[Wonder Woman (TV series)|''Wonder Woman'' television series]], starring [[Lynda Carter]]. Diana Prince was in the first season the bespectacled Yeoman Prince, WAVES secretary to Maj. Steve Trevor in the O.S.S. headquarters in Washington, DC. In the second and third seasons, set in the modern day, Diana Prince was an agent of the Inter-Agency Defense Command (IADC), operating at first from Washington and, in the final episode, from the Los Angeles field office.

The Lynda Carter TV series had a significant impact on the comic book. During the first season, DC Comics decided to set the comic book in World War II to match the series, using the parallel worlds conceit to explain that the Wonder Woman of Earth-One accidentally travelled both back in time and to a parallel world, where she encountered her multiversal counterpart. When the Earth-One Wonder Woman returned to the present day, the comic book remained behind in World War II to follow the adventures of that Wonder Woman.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #228 (February 1977)&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment lasted a year, until the May 1978 issue returned to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 1) #243 (May 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Once the comic returned to the present day, the comic art by [[José Delbo]] continued to reflect aspects of the TV series, notably the fashion-forward Diana Prince with a long ponytail, but mostly without the Clark Kent-esque glasses which became a feature of the TV series starting in the middle of the second season. From that point on, Diana would wear her glasses if she is either in her office or driving a car. Other aspects of the TV series, most notably the "Wonder spin" transformation and the convention that Diana Prince is powerless until she transforms into Wonder Woman, became incorporated in the 2005 restart of the comic book.

This character is portrayed by [[Gal Gadot]] in the 2016 film ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''. It marks the first theatrical appearance of Diana as well as the first live action theatrical appearance of her Amazonian superhero counterpart, with a new image. She later received [[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|her own film]] in 2017, which depicts the Diana Prince identity as a [[curator]] of [[antiquities]] at the [[Louvre|Louvre Museum]] in Paris. The name is referenced in the film as Steve Trevor forms it to cut off Diana from fully saying "Diana, Princess of Themyscira" in an effort to form a secret identity for her.

Comic books based on the SuperFriends cartoon continuity had the original Diana Prince and her husband Dan White as the parents of original kid sidekick Marvin, with his connection being the reason he was considered for the role. This was never brought up in the cartoon. His partner Wendy was the niece of one of Batman's earliest mentors as well.

==Secret identity transformation==
In the Golden Age, Diana eventually learned the benefits of keeping her Wonder Woman costume under her military uniform, instead of leaving it at her apartment or in a desk drawer. Her transformation often involved her running out of a room, changing clothes at superspeed, and returning to a room as Wonder Woman. Occasionally, panels would show her in mid-transformation, pulling off stockings and revealing her Wonder Woman costume under the uniform.

A Bronze Age tweak gave her a new method of transformation using the magic lasso. The explanation was that Amazon scientists treated Wonder Woman's clothes with a special chemical that would respond to the vibrations of the magic lasso; whenever Diana stepped into the lasso loop and brought it up and down, her Diana Prince clothes would transform into the Wonder Woman armor.&lt;ref name="Wonder Woman' 1974"/&gt;

The best known transformation sequence was created by Lynda Carter in behind-the-scenes decisions for the Wonder Woman television show: a twirling transformation, which was based on a dance maneuver. As the twirl was refined, it involved Diana Prince stretching her arms out and making a counter-clockwise quarter turn and then a series of clockwise turns, with a mystical explosion of light, leaving her as Wonder Woman. Eventually, it was revealed that Diana Prince was powerless, until she executed the twirl and became Wonder Woman. A couple of episodes would have Diana Prince attempting the twirl, only to be interrupted by [[Robbery|muggers]] or having to stop the process due to fear of exposing her secret identity; in which she would not have turned herself into Wonder Woman, implying the process must be completed for her to do so. Also implied is that the process must be precise; the less experienced [[Wonder Girl]] attempted the twirl only to find herself still an ordinary woman. Only when she thought back to her training in a flashback with Hippolyta did she realize she must mentally focus and think of the transformation while twirling with ballet-like grace to be effective.

The twirl was featured infrequently on ''[[Super Friends]]'', whenever Diana Prince needed to leave her civilian job and attend to the various crises which she and JLA teammates faced throughout the show.

The "Wonder twirl" was copied briefly into the pre-Crisis comics during the period in which the comic book returned to World War II in order to correspond with the first season of the TV series, but Wonder Woman never lost her strength as Diana Prince. The twirl returned a few times in the post-''Crisis'' comic book, before the post-''Infinite Crisis'' reboot of the series, which brought the twirl back as a primary feature, along with the TV show convention that Wonder Woman loses her powers in the Diana Prince identity.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 3), Annual #1 (November 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Wonder twirl" was also shown in the "To Another Shore" episode of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.

===Diana as successful businesswoman===
{{main|Wonder Woman (2011 TV pilot)}}
In 2011, [[David E. Kelley]] wrote a Wonder Woman pilot for NBC that was never picked up to be on the air. The story takes place in modern-day Los Angeles, and the character, played by [[Adrianne Palicki]], would have three identities: Wonder Woman (a superhero who fights crime), Diana Themyscira (Wonder Woman's public persona outside of costume, who is a successful businesswoman and owner of Themyscira Industries) and Diana Prince (an ordinary shy woman, the other assistant of Diana Themyscira).  The Diana Prince identity would have been used to allow Diana some escape from her more recognized role as Diana Themyscira and Wonder Woman.

The '''Dirty Money Project''' is a scientific research project of [[New York University]], a comprehensive study of the [[DNA]] on [[banknotes]] which aims to understand the role of banknotes in spreading [[diseases]] among [[humans]], especially on those who live in an [[urban area|urban]] region.

NYU's Dirty Money Project is part of a larger project looking into [[New York City]]'s "MetaGenome", which seeks to examine the "[[microbes]] all around us".  According to experts, the project may be able to identify potential health threats, fight [[flu]] epidemics, and even chart the environmental impact of major [[storms]]. The studies conducted so far have revealed that a banknote is a medium of exchange for hundreds of different kinds of [[bacteria]] as banknotes pass from hand to hand.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lee Hotz (April 18, 2014). [https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303456104579489510784385696 Why You Shouldn't Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is]. ''Wall Street Journal''. Retrieved November 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists have also found that each banknote carries about 3,000 types of [[bacteria]] on its surface as well as DNA from [[drug-resistant]] microbes.&lt;ref&gt;Michaeleen Doucleff (April 23, 2014). [https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/04/23/305890574/dirty-money-a-microbial-jungle-thrives-in-your-wallet Dirty Money: A Microbial Jungle Thrives In Your Wallet]. ''Shots'': Health news from npr.

[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dirty-money-your-cash-is-home-to-thousands-of-bacteria/ Dirty money: Your cash is home to thousands of bacteria]. ''CBS News''. Retrieved November 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; And, since a banknote is home to thousands of [[microbes]] – [[bacteria]], [[fungi]] and [[pathogens]], this situation can cause such illnesses as [[skin infections]], [[stomach ulcers]] and [[food poisoning]] etc., scientists believe.

One of the goals of the study is to provide information that could help [[health workers]] to prevent disease outbreaks in urban environments like New York City before they spread very far through mediums like banknotes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7426">People with disabilities in Sri Lanka typically face significant stigma and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-55224-8_16|title=Inclusion, Disability and Culture|last=Liyanage|first=Chandani|date=2017|publisher=Springer, Cham|pages=251–265|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-55224-8_16/fulltext.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main causes for disability in Sri Lanka are poor hygiene, lack of medical care, the prevalence of 30 years of war, the aftereffects of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 tsunami]], and an increase in accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic-social/meetings/2016/bangkok--disability-measurement-and-statistics/Session-6/Sri%2520Lanka.pdf|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 1.6 million Sri Lankans, 8% of the population, were regarded as disabled in 2012. Sri Lanka has been a signatory of the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] since 2007.&lt;ref name="APCD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apcdfoundation.org/?q=content/sri-lanka|title=Sri Lanka &amp;#124; Asia-Pacific Development Center on Disability|author=Asia-Pacific Development Center on Disability|date=|publisher=Apcdfoundation.org|accessdate=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kdu.ac.lk/proceedings/irc2015/2015/law-029.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of disability in Sri Lanka is: "Any person who as a result of any deficiency in his physical or mental capabilities whether congenital or not is unable by himself to ensure for himself, wholly or partly the necessities of life".

== Demographics ==
''See:[[Demographics of Sri Lanka]]''

In Sri Lanka about 8.7% of the total population above the age of 5 live with some form of disability, and it is estimated that about 300,000 people in the 18-60 age group have some form of disability.

About 57% of disabled people are male, and 43% are female, as of 2012.

== Politics ==

=== Legislation ===
Chapter III, article 12, paragraph 4 of the [[Constitution of Sri Lanka]] permits legislation and executive action that creates advantages for disabled persons.&lt;ref name="APCD" /&gt; According to the Manthri.lk parliamentary monitoring website, [[disability rights]] legislation and policies are generally not properly implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manthri.lk/en/blog/posts/are-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities-being-adequately-protected-in-sri-lanka|title=Are The Rights Of Persons With Disabilities Being Adequately Protected in Sri Lanka?|date=|publisher=Manthri.lk|accessdate=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sri Lanka ratified by the CRPD on 8 February 2016.

The following acts are taken in consideration related to disability in Sri Lanka. They are:

1. '''1996, Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities'''
* Implementation of Act no 28 for promotion,advancement and protection of rights of persons with disabilities
* This act is one of the key pieces of legislation related to disability. The act provides secure protection for people with disabilities against discrimination with regarding employment, education and access to the built environment. This also gives a legal framework for activities of the National Council for Persons who have disabilities.
2. '''Ranaviru Seva Act''' 
* This was enacted by the [[Parliament of Sri Lanka]] by which Ranaviru Seva Authority was set up to provide for the after care and rehabilitation of members of armed forces and police who are disabled 
3. '''Visually Handicapped Trust Fund Act'''
* This act is involved with providing educational and vocational training opportunities for poverty reduction, provide financial assistance and guidance for self-employment of the visually impaired people.

== Advocacy ==
Some organisations have voluntarily come forward to help the disabled people in Sri Lanka. They include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socialemwelfare.gov.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=117&amp;lang=en|title=National Secretariat for Persons with Disabilities (NSPD)|last=Webadmin|website=socialemwelfare.gov.lk|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Brighter Life Foundation is a Swiss group founded in 2004, aiming to assist disability charities in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brighterlife.ch/en/|title=Bright Life Foundation helps the disabled people in Sri Lanka|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Sri Lanka Council for Mental Health was established for disabled people who have mental illness. It serves as skills training centre and a shelter workplace.
* Sri Lanka Foundation for Rehabilitation of the Disabled manages "Rehab Lanka", a workshop giving employment to people with disabilities and earning some income for the organization.

== Employment ==
Generally in Sri Lanka, most disabled people are unemployed as they face discrimination and limitations to access safe working environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.manthri.lk/en/blog/posts/are-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities-being-adequately-protected-in-sri-lanka|title=Are The Rights Of Persons With Disabilities Being – Manthri.lk|website=www.manthri.lk|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-employment is the only option available to disabled people instead of expecting an open safe working environment.

== Education ==
In Sri Lanka, about 96% of the total disabled population with functional difficulties didn't engage in educational activities. Only about 54,311 disabled students attend school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hope-for-children.org/projects/support-for-disabled-children-in-sri-lanka/|title=Support for disabled children in Sri Lanka - Hope for Children|work=Hope for Children|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sport ==
{{Main|Sri Lanka at the Paralympics}}

Sri Lanka made its [[Paralympic Games|Paralympics]] debut in [[1996 Summer Paralympics|1996 Paralympics Games]] in [[Atlanta]]. Since then, the [[Sri Lanka at the Paralympics|Sri Lankan Paralympic team]] has participated in every edition of the Paralympics Games. So far, Sri Lanka has won two medals in the Paralympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/115781/Dinesh-Priyantha-wins-Javelin-bronze-at-Rio-Paralympics|title=Dinesh Priyantha wins Javelin bronze at Rio Paralympics|access-date=2017-08-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pradeep Sanjaya]] and [[Dinesh Priyantha]] are the only Sri Lankan Paralympians to win Paralympic medals for Sri Lanka. Both of these athletes are army personnel.

'''Everest &amp; Jennings''' was a manufacturer of mobility and adaptive equipment. Everest &amp; Jennings was the first company to mass-produce [[wheelchairs]].

==Origins==
Herbert A. Everest and Harry C. Jennings Sr. were friends, and both were  engineers. Herbert Everest was also physically disabled after surviving a mining accident in 1918. Everest complained to Jennings about the bulk of chairs available in the early 1930s, and in 1933, the pair designed and built a lightweight, collapsible model in Jennings' garage.&lt;ref&gt;N. R. Kleinfield, [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3116280/everest_jennings_1981/ "Wheelchair Manufacturer Target of Complaints"] ''The Index-Journal'' (April 22, 1981): 12. via [[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design was patented in October 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond V. Smith and John H. Leslie Jr. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-bmv4x6IN4C&amp;lpg=PA196 ''Rehabilitation Engineering''] (CRC Press 1990): 195-196. {{ISBN|9780849369513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pair soon went into business to manufacture their improved design. In the 1940s, they supplied disabled veterans of [[World War II]] through government contracts that established the company as a recognized name in rehabilitation equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Richard I. Bourgeois-Doyle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=F1xHwJLeGMAC&amp;lpg=PA167 ''George J.

The Everest family sold its interest in the company in 1943,&lt;ref&gt;[https://casetext.com/case/everest-jennings-inc-v-e-j-mfg-co Everest Jennings Inc. vs. E. J. Manufacturing Co.] United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit.·263 F.2d 254 (9th Cir. 1959).&lt;/ref&gt; but Gerald Jennings, son of Harry Sr., was chief executive from 1952 until he retired in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/08/obituaries/gerald-m-jennings-70-wheelchair-maker.html "Gerald M.

The resulting settlement required Everest &amp; Jennings to make annual compliance reports to the Justice Department; the settlement was called "little more than a slap on the wrist" by consumer advocate [[Ralph Nader]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3116173/everest_jennings_antitrust/ "Wheelchair Manufacturer Deal Blasted by Nader"] ''The Pantagraph'' (May 29, 1978): 5. via [[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nader was also involved with protests about the quality, safety, and price of Everest &amp; Jennings chairs, by a disability rights group.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3116444/disability_rights_center_and_everest/ "Wheelchair Builders Rip Off the Disabled, Nader Group Says"] ''The Independent Record'' (December 24, 1976): 15. via [[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; A class action suit was brought by equipment dealers, but dismissed in court in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3116527/class_action_suit_against_everest/ "Wheelchair Maker Claim"] ''Santa Cruz Sentinel'' (March 22, 1984): 20. via [[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EyeBlack.jpg|thumb|200px|American Football players wearing eye black.]]

'''Eye black''' is a grease or strip applied under the [[human eye|eyes]] to reduce [[light pollution#Glare|glare]]. It is often used by [[American football]], [[baseball]], and [[lacrosse]] players to mitigate the effects of bright sunlight or stadium floodlights.

It is a form of functional [[theatrical makeup|makeup]].

==Varieties==

* Traditional grease consists of [[beeswax]], [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]], and [[carbon]].
* Anti-glare face strips that emulate the grease are also commonly used.

==History==
One of the earliest known instances of a player wearing eye black is baseball legend [[Babe Ruth]], who, in or around the 1930s, used the grease in an attempt to reduce sun glare. According to Paul Lukas of ''[[ESPN.com]]'', eye black caught on with [[American football]] player [[Andy Farkas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Lukas |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The evolution of eye black. It has also been manufactured, sometimes with a sports team logo printed on them |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/061127 |work=ESPN Page 2 |publisher= |date=2006-11-21 |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003031950/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas%2F061127 |archivedate=2008-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also states that the original eye black was made from the ashes of burned cork.

===2003 study===
A 2003 study by Brian DeBroff and Patricia Pahk tested whether black eye grease actually had anti-glare properties.  The subjects of the study were divided into three groups: wearers of eye black, wearers of anti-glare stickers, and wearers of [[petroleum jelly]]. The subjects' vision was tested using an [[eye chart]] while being exposed to natural sunlight.

The study concluded that eye black reduced glare of the sun and improved [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] sensitivity, whereas commercial anti-glare stickers and petroleum jelly (the control substance) were found to be ineffective.&lt;ref name="DeBroff-Pahk"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Brian M. DeBroff and Patricia J. Pahk | title=The Ability of Periorbitally Applied Antiglare Products to Improve Contrast Sensitivity in Conditions of Sunlight Exposure | journal=Archives of Ophthalmology |date=July 2003 | volume=121 | issue=7 | pages=997–1001 | url=http://archopht.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/121/7/997 | pmid=12860804 | doi=10.1001/archopht.121.7.997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the study was subject to unavoidable [[Demand characteristics|demand bias]], wherein the test subjects could have unconsciously changed their responses during testing based on the fact that they knew which substance they were wearing. Also, the petroleum jelly could have introduced glare that would not occur on natural skin and the study did not test a control condition of natural skin. [[Learning bias]] is also a factor in the results due to chart repetition.&lt;ref name="DeBroff-Pahk"/&gt;

===New Hampshire study===
A study by Benjamin R. Powers at [[University of New Hampshire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Benjamin R. Powers | title=Why Do Athletes Use Eye Black? | journal=University of New Hampshire Inquiry | year=2005 | url=http://www.unh.edu/inquiryjournal/05/articles/powers.htm | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908114749/http://www.unh.edu/inquiryjournal/05/articles/powers.htm | archivedate=2007-09-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which improved on DeBroff's methodology, found eye black to reduce glare from the sun in females and in those whose eye-color was not blue. The study also tested males and blue-eyed subjects. However, the results were not statistically significant (probably due to a smaller sample size of those test subjects). Some testing was also performed indoors under artificial lighting (when inclement weather prohibited outdoor testing). However, those results showed little difference and were not statistically significant. The Powers study was not a [[double-blind]] study because those in contact with the test subjects knew which substance was applied. Also, the eye tests were performed at a distance of only {{convert|1.15|metre}}.

===MythBusters test===
On an episode of ''[[MythBusters]]'', [[Adam Savage]] and [[Jamie Hyneman]] tested whether eye black reduces glare. They determined that, while eye black does not eliminate glare, it does improve an athlete's ability to differentiate between light and dark, enhancing a player's ability to track moving objects in a sunny environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/mythbusters-database/baseball-eye-black-cuts-out-glare/ |title=''MythBusters'' episode summary "Baseball Player's Eye Black Cuts Out Glare" |accessdate=2015-03-26}}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Messages in eye black==

Some athletes, particularly at the college level, began a practice of writing short messages on their adhesive eye black stickers. The trend gained traction among football players in the mid-2000s, popularized by [[Reggie Bush]], who featured homages to his [[Area code 619|hometown]]; other popular messages included [[Bible]] verses, memorial tributes, and licensed university logos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Lukas |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The evolution of eye black |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/061127 |work=[[ESPN]] Page 2 |publisher= |date=2006-11-21 |accessdate=2014-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003031950/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas%2F061127 |archivedate=2008-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The displays began to garner widespread media attention surrounding [[Tim Tebow]], who used Bible verse references. This practice was banned on April 14, 2010, when the [[NCAA]] Playing Rules Oversight Panel (PROP) approved a proposal effecting "that players are not allowed to have any symbols or messages on their eye black starting in the 2010 season."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Greg |last=Johnson |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=PROP approves wedge-blocking proposal |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/ncaa/ncaa/ncaa+news/ncaa+news+online/2010/association-wide/prop+approves+wedge-blocking+proposal_04_15_10_ncaa_news |work=The NCAA News |publisher= |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FAT TOM''' is a [[mnemonic device]] used in the [[food service]] industry to describe the six favorable conditions required for the growth of [[foodborne pathogens]]. It is an [[acronym]] for '''food, acidity, time, temperature, oxygen''' and '''moisture'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Servsafe Essentials Fifth Edition|year=2008|isbn=978-1-58280-224-4|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''family nurse practitioner''' (FNP) provides continuing and comprehensive healthcare for the individual and family across all ages, genders, diseases, and body systems.  [[Primary care]] emphasises the holistic nature of health and it is based on knowledge of the patient in the context of the family and the community, emphasizing [[disease prevention]] and [[health promotion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nurse Practitioner Primary Care Competencies in Specialty Areas |url=http://www.aacn.nche.edu/education-resources/npcompetencies.pdf |publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services |date=April 2002 |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and board certification==
Following educational preparation at the [[Master of Science in Nursing|master's]] or [[Doctor of Nursing Practice|doctoral]] level, FNPs must become board certified by an approved certification body.  Board certification must be maintained by obtaining [[continuing nursing education]] credits.  In the US, board certification is provided either through the [[American Nurses Credentialing Center]] (awards the FNP-BC credential) or through the [[American Association of Nurse Practitioners]] certification program (awards the NP-C credential).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NP Certifying Bodies|url=http://www.nonpf.org/?18|publisher=National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties|accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of practice==
FNPs deliver a range of acute, chronic and [[preventive healthcare]] services. In addition to diagnosing and treating illness, they also provide preventive care, including routine checkups, health-risk assessments, immunization and screening tests, and personalized counseling on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. FNPs also manage chronic illness, often coordinating care provided by specialty physicians.

'''Feodor Vassilyev''' ({{lang-ru|Фёдор Васильев}}, older spelling: Ѳеодоръ Васильевъ) (c. 1707&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt;{{snd}} 1782) was a peasant from [[Shuya, Ivanovo Oblast|Shuya]], [[Russia]]. His first wife lived to be 76 and, between 1725 and 1765, had 69 children (16 pairs of twins, 7 sets of triplets and 4 sets of quadruplets); 67 of them survived infancy with the loss of one set of twins. Vassilyev's first wife, Valentina, set the record for most children born to a single woman; however, few other details are known of her life, such as her date of birth or death. Vassilyev also had 18 children with his second wife, who had 6 pairs of twins and 2 sets of triplets, making him a father of 87 children in total. Of his 87 children, at least 82 are said to have survived infancy.&lt;ref name="clay"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Marie M. |last=Clay|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xix2VLb4vGQC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=wife+of+Feodor+Vassilyev |title=Quadruplets and Higher Multiple Births|publisher=Mac Keith Press|location= London|year= 1989| isbn= 0-521-41223-4|chapter= Feodor Vassilyev: a case of remarkable fecundity|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="g"&gt;{{cite book|first=Mark C. |last=Young|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZSyswNFqTycC&amp;q=wife+of+Feodor+Vassilyev&amp;dq=wife+of+Feodor+Vassilyev |title=The Guinness Book of World Records |year=1998|publisher=Bantam Books|isbn =0-553-57895-2| page =357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published account about Feodor Vassilyev's children appeared in a 1783 issue of ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' (Vol. 53 p.&amp;nbsp;753, London, 1783) and states that the information "however astonishing, may be depended upon, as it came directly from an English merchant in St Petersburg to his relatives in England, who added that the peasant was to be introduced to the Empress".&lt;ref name="GM"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oaFJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA753&amp;dq=%22The+Gentleman's+Magazine+and+Historical+Chronicle%22+Waffilief&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &lt;!-- Comment out "Letters" here as in wrong place, should maybe be "Letter" or not appear at all?--&gt;|journal=The Gentleman's Magazine|volume= 53 |year=1783|page= 753|title=The gentleman's magazine, and historical chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="clay"/&gt; The same numbers were given in [[:ru:Болтин, Иван Никитич|Ivan Nikitich Boltin]]'s 1788 commentary on Russian history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ivan Nikitich|last=Boltin|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=4fIJAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA324  |title=Primechaniia na istoriiu derevniia I nyneshniia Rossii g. Leklerka ('Notes on the History of Ancient and Modern Russia of Mr Leclerc') vol. 2|language=Russian|location= St Petersburg|year=1788|page=324-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in an 1834 book by [[:ru:Башуцкий, Александр Павлович|Alexander Pavlovich Bashutskiy]], ''Saint Petersburg Panorama''.&lt;ref name="clay"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=A. P.|last= Bashutskiy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zA4LAAAAIAAJ  |title=Saint Petersburg Panorama vol. 2|language=Russian|location= St Petersburg|year=1834|page= 75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several published sources raised doubts as to the veracity of these claims. According to a 1933 article by Julia Bell&lt;ref name="bell"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Julia|last= Bell|title=Plural birth with a new pedigree| journal=Biometrika|volume= 25 |year=1933|issue=1–2|pages= 110–120|jstor=2332266|doi=10.1093/biomet/25.1-2.110}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Biometrika]]'', a 1790 book of B. F. J. Hermann ''Statistische Schilderung von Rußland'' did provide the claims about Feodor Vassilyev's children but "with a caution".  Bell also notes that the case was reported by ''[[The Lancet]]'' in an 1878 article about the study of twins.&lt;ref name="lancet"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Twins|journal=The Lancet|  volume= 111 |year=1878| issue= 2843|pages= 289–290|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)42845-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Lancet'' article states that the [[French Academy of Sciences]] attempted to verify the claims about Vassilyev's children and contacted "M. Khanikoff of the Imperial Academy of St Petersburg for advice as to the means they should pursue, but were told by him that all investigation was superfluous, that members of the family still lived in Moscow and that they had been the object of favors from the Government".&lt;ref name="bell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lancet"/&gt;  Bell concludes that Vassilyev's case "must be regarded as under suspicion".&lt;ref name="bell"/&gt; Similarly, Marie Clay in a 1998 book notes: "Sadly, this evasion of proper investigation seems, in retrospect, to have dealt a terminal blow to our chances of ever establishing the true detail of this extraordinary case".&lt;ref name="clay"/&gt; 
 
The data about Vassilyev's children are included in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]''.&lt;ref name="g"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1067">The '''Glenfiddich Food and Drink Awards''' were intended to recognize achievements in writing, publishing and broadcasting on the subjects of food and drink. The awards had been sponsored since 1972 by [[William Grant &amp; Sons]], a family-owned [[Scotland|Scottish]] distiller that produces [[Glenfiddich]], a [[Speyside Single Malts|Speyside]] [[single malt Scotch|single malt]] [[Scotch whisky|Scotch]] [[whisky]].

In total 12 awards were made annually.

In 2008, Glenfiddich decided to discontinue distributing Food and Drink Awards, reviewing their "strategy, scope and potential application in some of Glenfiddich’s key markets outside the UK."

[[File:Teletherapy Capsule2.svg|thumb|A teletherapy radiation capsule composed of the following: &lt;br&gt;A.) an [[international standard source holder]] (usually lead), &lt;br&gt;B.) a retaining ring, and &lt;br&gt;C.) a teletherapy "source" composed of &lt;br&gt;D.) two nested stainless steel canisters welded to &lt;br&gt;E.) two stainless steel lids surrounding &lt;br&gt;F.) a protective internal shield (usually uranium metal or a tungsten alloy) and &lt;br&gt;G.) a cylinder of radioactive source material, often but not always [[cobalt-60]]. In the Goiânia incident it was [[caesium-137]]. The diameter of the "source" is 30&amp;nbsp;mm.]]

The '''Goiânia accident''' {{IPA-pt|ɡojˈjɐniɐ|}} was a [[radioactive contamination]] accident that occurred on September 13, 1987, at [[Goiânia]], in the Brazilian state of [[Goiás]], after a forgotten [[radiotherapy]] source was taken from an abandoned hospital site in the city. It was subsequently handled by many people, resulting in four deaths. About 112,000 people were examined for radioactive contamination and 249 were found to have significant levels of radioactive material in or on their bodies.&lt;ref name=MTCDPub&gt;{{cite book | title = The Radiological accident in Goiânia | publisher = International Atomic Energy Agency  |location = Vienna| year = 1988 | isbn = 92-0-129088-8 |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub815_web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foderaro|first= Lisa|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/nyregion/09dirty.html|title=Columbia Scientists Prepare for a Threat: A Dirty Bomb|journal=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the cleanup operation, [[topsoil]] had to be removed from several sites, and several houses were demolished. All the objects from within those houses were removed and examined. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine has identified the accident as one of the world's "worst [[nuclear disaster]]s" and the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] called it "one of the world's worst radiological incidents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1887705,00.html|title=The Worst Nuclear Disasters - Photo Essays|website=TIME.com|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/time-to-better-secure-radioactive-materials/2012/03/23/gIQAn5deaS_story.html |title=Time to better secure radioactive materials |author=[[Yukiya Amano]] |date=March 26, 2012  |work=Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description of the source ==

The radiation source in the Goiânia accident was a small capsule containing about {{convert|93|g}} of highly [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[caesium chloride]] (a caesium salt made with a [[radioactive isotope|radioisotope]], [[caesium-137]]) encased in a shielding canister made of [[lead]] and [[steel]]. The source was positioned in a container of the wheel type, where the wheel turns inside the casing to move the source between the storage and irradiation positions.&lt;ref name=MTCDPub/&gt;

The activity of the source was 74 [[Becquerel|terabecquerels]] (TBq) in 1971. The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) describes the container as an "international standard capsule". It was 51 millimeters (2 inches) in diameter and 48&amp;nbsp;mm (1.8 inches) long. The specific activity of the active solid was about 814&amp;nbsp;[[Becquerel|TBq]]·kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of [[caesium-137]] ([[half life]] of 30 years). The dose rate at one meter from the source was 4.56 [[Gray (unit)|grays]] per hour (456&amp;nbsp;rad·h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). While the serial number of the device was unknown, thus hindering definitive identification, the device was thought to have been made in the United States at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] and was used as a radiation source for [[radiation therapy]] at the Goiânia hospital.&lt;ref name=MTCDPub/&gt;

The IAEA states that the source contained {{convert|50.9|TBq|Ci|abbr=on}} when it was taken and that about 44&amp;nbsp;TBq (1200&amp;nbsp;Ci, 87%) of contamination had been recovered during the cleanup operation. This means that {{convert|7|TBq|Ci|abbr=on}} remained in the environment; it would have decayed to about {{convert|3.5|TBq|Ci|abbr=on}} by 2016.{{CN|date=June 2018}}

== Events ==

=== Hospital abandonment ===

The Instituto Goiano de Radioterapia (IGR), a private radiotherapy institute in Goiânia,&lt;ref name=MTCDPub/&gt; was just {{convert|1|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} northwest of Praça Cívica, the administrative center of the city. It moved to its new premises in 1985, leaving behind a caesium-137-based [[teletherapy]] unit that had been purchased in 1977.&lt;ref name=puig /&gt; The fate of the abandoned site was disputed in court between IGR and the [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul]], then owner of the premises.&lt;ref name="God"&gt;{{pt icon}} Godinho, Iúri. [http://www.jornalopcao.com.br/index.asp "Os médicos e o acidente radioativo"].  ''Jornal Opção''. February 8, 2004. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918235305/http://www.jornalopcao.com.br/index.asp |date=September 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 11, 1986, the Court of Goiás stated it had knowledge of the abandoned radioactive material in the building.&lt;ref name="God"/&gt;

Four months before the theft, on May 4, 1987, Saura Taniguti, then director of Ipasgo, the institute of insurance for civil servants, used police force to prevent one of the owners of IGR, Carlos Figueiredo Bezerril, from removing the objects that were left behind.&lt;ref name="God"/&gt; Figueiredo then warned the president of Ipasgo, Lício Teixeira Borges, that he should take responsibility "for what would happen with the caesium bomb".&lt;ref name="God"/&gt;

The court posted a security guard to protect the hazardous abandoned equipment.&lt;ref name="Web"&gt;{{pt icon}} Borges, Weber.  [http://www.jornalopcao.com.br/index.asp?secao=Entrevistas&amp;idjornal=239 "O jornalista que foi vítima do césio"]. ''Jornal Opção''. May 27, 2007.{{dead link|date=December 2013}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the owners of IGR wrote several letters to the [[National Nuclear Energy Commission]], warning them about the danger of keeping a teletherapy unit at an abandoned site, but they could not remove the equipment by themselves once a court order prevented them from doing so.&lt;ref name="God"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Web"/&gt;

=== Theft of the source ===

On September 13, 1987, taking advantage of the absence of the guard,&lt;ref name="Web" /&gt; Roberto dos Santos Alves and Wagner Mota Pereira illegally entered the partially demolished facility. They partially disassembled the teletherapy unit, and placed the source assembly – which they thought might have some scrap value – in a wheelbarrow, taking it to Alves's home.&lt;ref name=MTCDPub /&gt; There, they began dismantling the equipment. That same evening, they both began to vomit.  Nevertheless, they continued in their efforts. The following day, Pereira began to experience diarrhea and dizziness and his left hand began to swell.  He soon developed a burn on this hand in the same size and shape as the aperture – he eventually underwent partial [[amputation]] of several fingers.&lt;ref name="Daily Planet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carlalacerda.blogspot.co.uk/2010_07_01_archive.html|title=Planeta Diário|website=carlalacerda.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 15, Pereira visited a local clinic where his symptoms were diagnosed as the result of something he had eaten, and he was told to return home and rest.&lt;ref name="MTCDPub"/&gt; Alves, however, continued with his efforts to dismantle the equipment. In the course of this effort, he eventually freed the caesium capsule from its protective rotating head. His prolonged exposure to the radioactive material led to his right forearm becoming ulcerated, requiring amputation.&lt;ref name="Aint No Way to Go: All That Glitters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintnowaytogo.com/glitter.htm|title=Aint No Way to Go: All That Glitters|website=www.aintnowaytogo.com|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Source is partially broken ===

On September 16, Alves succeeded in puncturing the capsule's aperture window with a screwdriver, allowing him to see a deep blue light coming from the tiny opening he had created.&lt;ref name=MTCDPub /&gt; He inserted the screwdriver and successfully scooped out some of the glowing substance.  Thinking it was perhaps a type of [[gunpowder]], he tried to light it, but the powder would not ignite.  The exact mechanism by which the light was generated was not known at the time the IAEA report was written, though it was thought to be either [[ionized air glow]], [[fluorescence]] or [[Cherenkov radiation]] associated with the absorption of moisture by the source; similar blue light was observed in 1988 at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] during the disencapsulation of a &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs source.&lt;ref name=MTCDPub /&gt;

=== Source is sold and dismantled ===

On September 18, Alves sold the items to a nearby [[Wrecking yard|scrapyard]]. That night, Devair Alves Ferreira (the owner of the scrapyard) noticed the blue glow from the punctured capsule. Thinking the capsule's contents were valuable or even supernatural, he immediately brought it into his house. Over the next three days, he invited friends and family to view the strange glowing substance.

On September 21 at the scrapyard, one of Ferreira's friends (given as EF1 in the IAEA report) succeeded in freeing several rice-sized grains of the glowing material from the capsule using a screwdriver. Alves Ferreira began to share some of them with various friends and family members. That same day, his wife, 37-year-old Gabriela Maria Ferreira, began to fall ill. On September 25, 1987, Devair Alves Ferreira sold the scrap metal to a second scrapyard.

=== Ivo and his daughter ===

The day before the sale to the second scrapyard, on September 24, Ivo, Devair's brother, successfully scraped some additional dust out of the source and took it to his house a short distance away. There he spread some of it on the concrete floor. His six-year-old daughter, Leide das Neves Ferreira, later ate a sandwich while sitting on this floor. She was also fascinated by the blue glow of the powder, applying it to her body and showing it off to her mother.  Dust from the powder fell on the sandwich she was consuming; she eventually absorbed 1.0&amp;nbsp;[[GBq]] and received a total dose of 6.0&amp;nbsp;[[gray (unit)|Gy]], more than a fatal dose even with treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= | work=Time | title=Brazil Deadly Glitter | date=October 19, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gabriela Maria Ferreira notifies authorities ===

Gabriela Maria Ferreira had been the first to notice that many people around her had become severely ill at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-24/news/mn-4108_1_radiation-poisoning | work=Los Angeles Times | title=2 Die of Radiation Poisoning in Brazil | date=October 24, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, 1987 - 15 days after the item was found - she reclaimed the materials from the rival scrapyard and transported them to a hospital. Because the remains of the source were kept in a plastic bag, the level of contamination at the hospital was low.

=== Source's radioactivity is detected ===

In the morning of September 29, 1987 a visiting medical physicist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcti.gov.br/index.php/content/view/342399/Pais_esta_preparado_para_atuar_em_acidente_radioativo.html|title=País está preparado para atuar em acidente radioativo|publisher=Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI)|date={{date|2012-09-13}}|accessdate={{date|2013-11-10}}|language=Portuguese|trans-title=Country is prepared to act in radioactive incident|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131110222502/http://www.mcti.gov.br/index.php/content/view/342399/Pais_esta_preparado_para_atuar_em_acidente_radioativo.html|archivedate=2013-11-10|df=}} Note: person named only as "WF" in the IAEA report.&lt;/ref&gt; used a [[scintillation counter]] to confirm the presence of radioactivity and persuaded the authorities to take immediate action. The city, state, and national governments were all aware of the incident by the end of the day.

== Health outcomes ==
News of the radiation incident was broadcast on local, national, and international media.  Within days, nearly 130,000 people swarmed local hospitals concerned that they might have been exposed.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Of those, 250 were indeed found to be contaminated— some with radioactive residue still on their skin— through the use of [[Geiger counters]].&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Eventually, 20 people showed signs of [[radiation sickness]] and required treatment.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

=== Fatalities ===

Ages in years are given, with dosages listed in [[Gray (unit)|grays]] (Gy).

* '''Leide das Neves Ferreira''', age 6 (6.0&amp;nbsp;Gy), was the daughter of Ivo Ferreira. When an international team arrived to treat her, she was discovered confined to an isolated room in the hospital because the hospital staff were afraid to go near her. She gradually experienced swelling in the upper body, hair loss, kidney and lung damage, and internal bleeding. She died on October 23, 1987, of "[[septicemia]] and generalized infection" at the Marcilio Dias Navy Hospital, in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref name=verde&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lZtEAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Leide+das+Neves+Ferreira+septicemia&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Leide+das+Neves+Ferreira.+de+seis+anos+y+Mana+Gabriala+Ferraira%2C+de+37+arios%2C+fallecieron+victimas+de+%22septicemia+a+infacci%C3%B3n+genaralizada |title=Vida Verde |volume=1 |year=1987 |page=15 |language=Portuguese }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried in a common cemetery in Goiânia, in a special fiberglass coffin lined with lead to prevent the spread of radiation. Despite these measures, news of her impending burial caused a riot of more than 2,000 people in the cemetery on the day of her burial, all fearing that her corpse would poison the surrounding land. Rioters tried to prevent her burial by using stones and bricks to block the cemetery roadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorial Césio 137 |publisher=Greenpeace| url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080126080434/https://www.greenpeace.org.br/nuclear/cesio/flash_cesio.html |language=Portuguese }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was buried despite this interference. 
* '''Gabriela Maria Ferreira''', aged 37 (5.7&amp;nbsp;Gy), wife of scrapyard owner Devair Ferreira, became sick about three days after coming into contact with the substance. Her condition worsened, and she developed internal bleeding, especially in the limbs, eyes, and digestive tract, and hair loss. She suffered mental confusion, diarrhea, and acute [[Human kidney|renal]] insufficiency before also dying on October 23, 1987, of "septicemia and generalized infection",&lt;ref name=verde/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Tania |last=Malheiros |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KtpjAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Leide+das+Neves+Ferreira+Maria+23&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Ambas+morreram |title=Histórias secretas do Brasil nuclear |language=Portuguese |location=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=WVA |year=1996 |isbn=9788585644086 |page=122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; about a month after exposure.
* '''Israel Baptista dos Santos''', aged 22 (4.5&amp;nbsp;Gy), was an employee of Devair Ferreira who worked on the radioactive source primarily to extract the lead. He developed serious respiratory and lymphatic complications, was eventually admitted to hospital, and died six days later on October 27, 1987.
* '''Admilson Alves de Souza''', aged 18 (5.3&amp;nbsp;Gy), was also an employee of Devair Ferreira who worked on the radioactive source. He developed lung damage, internal bleeding, and heart damage, and died October 18, 1987.

Devair Ferreira himself survived despite receiving 7&amp;nbsp;Gy of radiation. He died in 1994 of [[cirrhosis]] aggravated by depression and [[binge drinking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Irene|first=Mirelle|title=Goiânia, 25 anos depois: 'perguntam até se brilhamos', diz vítima|url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/goiania-25-anos-depois-39perguntam-ate-se-brilhamos39-diz-vitima,bb12dc840f0da310VgnCLD200000bbcceb0aRCRD.html|accessdate=5 December 2013|newspaper=Terra|date=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivo Ferreira died of [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|emphysema]] in 2003, after also being afflicted by depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k09b2aktGao|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other individuals ===

The outcomes for the 46 most contaminated people are shown in the bar chart below. Several people survived high doses of radiation. This is thought in some cases to be because the [[Dose fractionation|dose was fractionated]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Given time, the body's repair mechanisms will reverse cell damage caused by radiation. If the dose is spread over a long time period, these mechanisms can mitigate the effects of radiation poisoning.

[[File:Goiânia accident - Health outcomes.svg|center|600px|This is a barchart showing the outcome for the 46 most contaminated people for whom a dose estimate has been made. The people are divided into seven groups according to dose.]]

=== Other affected people ===

Afterwards, about 112,000 people were examined for radioactive contamination; 249 were found to have significant levels of radioactive material in or on their body.&lt;ref name=MTCDPub /&gt; Of this group, 129 people had internal contamination. The majority of the internally contaminated people only suffered small doses ({{nowrap|&lt; 50 [[Sievert|mSv]]}}, less than a 1 in 400 risk of getting cancer as a result).

A thousand people were identified as having suffered a dose which was greater than one year of [[background radiation]]; it is thought that 97% of these people had a dose of between 10 and 200&amp;nbsp;mSv (between 1 in 2,000 and 1 in 100 risk of developing cancer as a result).

In 2007, the [[Oswaldo Cruz Foundation]] determined that the rate of caesium-137 related diseases are the same in Goiânia accident survivors as they are in the population at large. Nevertheless, compensation is still distributed to survivors, who suffer radiation-related prejudices in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;UOL.

September 25, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal matters ==

In light of the deaths caused, the three doctors who had owned and run IGR were charged with [[criminal negligence]].  Because the accidents occurred before the promulgation of the Federal Constitution of 1988 and because the substance was acquired by the clinic and not by the individual owners, the court could not declare the owners of IGR liable. One of the medical doctors owning IGR and the clinic's physicist were ordered to pay R$100,000 for the derelict condition of the building. The two thieves were not included as defendants in the public civil suit.

In 2000, CNEN, the National Nuclear Energy Commission, was ordered by the 8th Federal Court of Goiás to pay compensation of [[Brazilian real|R$]] 1.3 million (near US$750,000) and to guarantee medical and psychological treatment for the direct and indirect victims of the accident and their descendants down to the third generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |format=[[PDF]] |url=http://www.oecd-nea.org/law/nlb/Nlb-66/023-032.pdf |title=Case Law and Administrative Decisions, Judgement of the Federal Court in the Public Civil Action concerning the Goiânia Accident |year=2000 |publisher=OECD |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Let9iyBp?url=http://www.oecd-nea.org/law/nlb/Nlb-66/023-032.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-06 |df= }}. ()&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cleanup ==
{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2017}}&lt;!--first three sub-sections have no references--&gt;

=== Objects and places ===

[[Topsoil]] had to be removed from several sites, and several houses were demolished. All the objects from within those houses were removed and examined. Those that were found to be free of radioactivity were wrapped in plastic bags, while those that were contaminated were either decontaminated or disposed of as waste. In industry, the choice between decontaminating or disposing objects is based on only the [[Value (economics)|economic value]] of the object and the ease of [[decontamination]]. In this case, the IAEA recognized that to reduce the [[Psychological trauma|psychological impact]] of the event, greater effort should have been taken to clean up items of personal value, such as [[jewelry]] and [[photograph]]s.  It is not clear from the IAEA report to what degree this was practiced.

=== Means and methods ===

After the houses were emptied, vacuum cleaners were used to remove dust, and plumbing was examined for radioactivity. Painted surfaces could be scraped, while floors were treated with acid and [[Prussian blue]] mixtures. Roofs were vacuumed and hosed, but two houses had to have their roofs removed. The waste from the cleanup was moved out of the city to a remote place for storage.

[[Potassium alum]] dissolved in [[hydrochloric acid]] was used on clay, concrete, soil, and roofs. Caesium has a high affinity for many clays.

[[Organic solvent]]s, followed by potassium alum dissolved in hydrochloric acid, were used to treat waxed/greased floors and tables. [[Sodium hydroxide]] solutions, also followed by dissolved potassium alum, were used to treat synthetic floors, machines and typewriters.

Prussian blue was used to internally decontaminate many people, although by the time it was applied, much of the radioactive material had already migrated from the bloodstream to the muscle tissue, greatly hampering its effectiveness. Urine from victims was treated with [[ion exchange resin]] to compact the waste for ease of storage.

=== Recovery considerations ===

The cleanup operation was much harder for this event than it could have been because the source was opened and the active material was [[water]] [[soluble]]. A sealed source need only be picked up, placed in a [[lead]] container, and transported to the [[radioactive waste]] storage. In the recovery of lost sources, the [[IAEA]] recommends careful planning and using a [[crane (machine)|crane]] or other device to place shielding (such as a pallet of [[brick]]s or a [[concrete]] block) near the source to protect recovery workers.

=== Contamination locations ===

The Goiânia accident spread significant radioactive contamination throughout the Aeroporto, Central, and Ferroviários districts. Even after the cleanup, 7&amp;nbsp;TBq of radioactivity remained unaccounted for.

Some of the key contamination sites:
{{GeoGroupTemplate}}
* '''Goiânia’s Instituto Goiano de Radioterapia (IGR)''' ({{Coord|-16.6746|-49.2641 |format=dms |display= inline|type:event_region:BR|name= Instituto Goiano de Radioterapia}})&lt;ref name="MTCDPub"/&gt; suffered no actual exposure or breach of radioactive contents, but the site is noteworthy as the source of deadly, unsecured material. The IGR clinic moved to another location in the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igr.com.br/paciente/instituto|title=IGR - Instituto Goiano de Radiologia|website=www.igr.com.br|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the previous site having been replaced around 2000 with the modernized Centro de Convenções de Goiânia (Goiânia Convention Center).
* '''Roberto dos Santos' house''' ({{Coord|-16.66848|-49.26341 |format=dms |display=inline|type:event_region:BR|name=Roberto dos Santos' house}})&lt;ref name="MTCDPub"/&gt; on Rua 57. The radioactive source was here for about six days, and it was partially broken into.
* '''Devair Ferreira's scrapyard''' ({{Coord |-16.66713|-49.26652 |format= dms |display= inline|type:event_region:BR|name= Devair Ferreira's scrapyard}}),&lt;ref name="MTCDPub"/&gt; on Rua 15A ("Junkyard I") in the Aeroporto section of the city, had possession of the items for 7 days.  The caesium container was entirely dismantled, spreading significant contamination. Extreme radiation levels of up to 1.5&amp;nbsp;Sv·h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; were found by investigators in the middle of the scrapyard.
* '''Ivo Ferreira's house''' ({{Coord|-16.66401|-49.26911 |format=dms |display= inline|type:event_region:BR|name= Ivo Ferreira's house/Junkyard II}})&lt;ref name="MTCDPub"/&gt; ("Junkyard II"), at 1F Rua 6. Some of the contamination was spread about the house, causing the fatalities of Leide das Neves Ferreira and Gabriela Maria Ferreira. The adjacent junkyard scavenged the remainder of parts from the IGR facility. The premises were heavily contaminated, with radiation dose rates up to 2&amp;nbsp;Sv·h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.
* '''Junkyard III''' ({{Coord|-16.66915|-49.28003 |format= dms |type:event_region:BR|name= Junkyard III}}).&lt;ref name="MTCDPub"/&gt; This junkyard had possession of the items for 3 days until they were sent away.
* '''Vigilância Sanitária''' ({{Coord|-16.675|-49.273 |format=dms |type:event_region:BR|name=Vigilancia Sanitaria}}&lt;!-- I was unable to determine exactly within the city block this clinic location is; maybe someone else knows--&gt;).&lt;ref name="MTCDPub"/&gt; Here, the substance was quarantined, and an official cleanup response began.

Other contamination was also found in or on:&lt;ref name="Steinhausler"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steinhauser|first= Friedrich|url=http://users.physics.harvard.edu/~wilson/pmpmta/Goiana.doc|title=Countering Radiological Terrorism: Consequences of the Radiation Exposure Incident in Goiania (Brazil)|journal="Volume 29 NATO Science for Peace and Security Series: Human and Societal Dynamics"|date=November 2007|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Three buses
* 42 houses
* 14 cars
* five pigs
* 50,000 rolls of toilet paper

== Legacy ==

===Disposal of the capsule===

The original teletherapy capsule was seized by the Brazilian military as soon as it was discovered, and since then the empty capsule has been on display at the ''Escola de Instrução Especializada'' ("School of Specialized Instruction") in Rio de Janeiro as a memento to those who participated in the cleanup of the contaminated area.

=== Research ===

In 1991, a group of researchers collected blood samples from highly exposed survivors of the incident. Subsequent analysis resulted in the publication of numerous scientific articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=8625952|year=1996|last1= Da Cruz|first1= AD|last2= Curry|first2= J|last3= Curado|first3= MP|last4= Glickman|first4= BW|title= Monitoring hprt mutant frequency over time in T-lymphocytes of people accidentally exposed to high doses of ionizing radiation |volume = 27|issue = 3|pages = 165–75| doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2280(1996)27:3&lt;165::AID-EM1&gt;3.0.CO;2-E | journal = Environmental and molecular mutagenesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid= 8908186| year= 1996| last1= Saddi| first1= V| last2= Curry| first2 = J|last3= Nohturfft|first3= A|last4= Kusser| first4 = W | last5 = Glickman|first5=BW|title=Increased hprt mutant frequencies in Brazilian children accidentally exposed to ionizing radiation| volume = 28| issue= 3| pages= 267–75|doi= 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2280(1996)28:3&lt;267::AID-EM11&gt;3.0.CO;2-D | journal= Environmental and molecular mutagenesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9042402| year= 1997| last1= Da Cruz| first1 = AD | last2= Volpe| first2= JP|last3= Saddi|first3= V|last4= Curry|first4= J|last5= Curadoc|first5= MP|last6= Glickman|first6= BW |title= Radiation risk estimation in human populations: lessons from the radiological accident in Brazil | volume = 373| issue = 2| pages = 207–14| journal = Mutation Research | doi = 10.1016/S0027-5107(96)00199-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9118962 | year = 1997 | last1 = Skandalis | first1 = A | last2 = Da Cruz | first2 = AD | last3 = Curry | first3 = J | last4 = Nohturfft | first4 = A | last5 = Curado | first5 = MP | last6 = Glickman | first6 = BW | title = Molecular analysis of T-lymphocyte HPRT– mutations in individuals exposed to ionizing radiation in Goiânia, Brazil|volume= 29| issue= 2| pages= 107–16| doi= 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2280(1997)29:2&lt;107::AID-EM1&gt;3.0.CO;2-B |journal=Environmental and molecular mutagenesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media depictions ===

A 1990 film ''Césio 137 – O Pesadelo de Goiânia'' ("Caesium-137 – The Nightmare of Goiânia"), a dramatisation of the incident, was made by [[Roberto Pires]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0259956|Césio 137 - O Pesadelo de Goiânia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won several awards at the 1990 [[Festival de Brasília]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uraniumfilmfestival.org/index.php/en/programme/directors-statements/257-roberto-pires UraniumFilmFestival.org: Roberto Pires] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813061419/http://www.uraniumfilmfestival.org/index.php/en/programme/directors-statements/257-roberto-pires |date=2012-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Thine Own Self]]", a 1994 episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', was partially inspired by the Goiânia accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emaisgoias.com.br/cesio-137-seis-referencias-ao-acidente-radiologico-na-cultura-pop/|title=Césio 137: seis referências ao acidente radiológico na cultura pop - Portal Mais Goiás|date=13 September 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foundation ===

The state government of Goiás established the Fundação Leide das Neves Ferreira in February 1988, both to study the extent of contamination of the population as a result of the incident and to render aid to those affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=T. |last=Camargo Da Silva |title=Biomedical Discourses and Health Care Experiences: The Goiâna Radiological Disaster |editor-first=Annette |editor-last=Leibing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gc8WAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Leide+das+Neves+Ferreira++foundation+1988&amp;dq=Leide+das+Neves+Ferreira++foundation+1988&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwvtPyquzKAhUK02MKHfeKA7kQ6AEIHDAA |work=The Medical Anthropologies in Brazil |series=''Curare'' Sonderband |volume=12 |location=Berlin |publisher=Verlag für Wissenschaft Und Bildung |year=1997 |isbn=9783861355687 |pages=72–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gynaecology''' or '''gynecology''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling differences]]) is the medical practice dealing with the health of the [[female reproductive system]]s ([[vagina]], [[uterus]], and [[ovaries]]) and the [[breasts]]. Outside medicine, the term means "the science of [[woman|women]]".  Its counterpart is [[andrology]], which deals with medical issues specific to the male reproductive system.

Almost all modern gynaecologists are also [[obstetrics|obstetricians]] (see ''[[obstetrics and gynaecology]]'').  In many areas, the specialities of gynaecology and obstetrics overlap.

==Etymology==
The word "gynaecology" comes from the oblique stem (γυναικ-) of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] γυνή (''gyne)'', "woman", and ''-logia'', "study".

==History==
The [[Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus]], dated to about 1800 BC, deals with women's health
—gynaecological diseases, fertility, pregnancy, contraception, etc. The text is divided into thirty-four sections, each section dealing with a specific problem and containing  diagnosis and treatment; no [[prognosis]] is suggested. Treatments are non surgical, comprising applying medicines to the affected body part or swallowing them. The womb is at times seen as the source of complaints manifesting themselves in other body parts.&lt;ref&gt;Laurinda S. Dixon. ''Perilous Chastity: Women and Illness in Pre-Enlightenment Art and Medicine'', Cornell University Press 1995, pp.15f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hippocratic Corpus]] contains several gynaecological treatises dating to the 5th/4th centuries BC.  Aristotle is another strong source for medical texts from the 4th century BC with his descriptions of biology primarily found in ''History of Animals, Parts of Animals, Generation of Animals.'' &lt;ref&gt;Lesley Dean-Jones, "The Cultural Construct of the Female Body" In Women’s History and Ancient History, ed. Susan B. Pomeroy (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1991), 113.&lt;/ref&gt; The gynaecological treatise ''Gynaikeia'' by [[Soranus of Ephesus]] (1st/2nd century AD) is extant (together with a 6th-century [[Latin]] paraphrase by [[Muscio]], a physician of the same school). He was the chief representative of the school of physicians known as the "[[Methodic school|Methodists]]".

[[J. Marion Sims]] is widely considered the father of modern gynaecology.&lt;ref name="Semple1923"&gt;{{cite book|last=Semple|first=Henry Churchill|title=J. Marion Sims, the Father of Modern Gynecology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c5WomgEACAAJ|accessdate=11 October 2013|date=1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now criticized for his practices, Sims developed some of his techniques by operating on slaves, many of whom were not given anaesthesia.&lt;ref name="Daly1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Daly|first=Mary|title=Gyn/ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Vhe2AgQYckC&amp;pg=PA225|accessdate=11 October 2013|date=1990|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=9780807014134|pages=225–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AdekunleWilliams2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adekunle|first1=Julius O.|last2=Williams|first2=Hettie V.|title=Color Struck: Essays on Race and Ethnicity in Global Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nktS8CObPYQC&amp;pg=PA397|accessdate=11 October 2013|date=2010-02-24|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=9780761850922|pages=397–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sims performed surgeries on 12 enslaved women in his homemade backyard hospital for four years. While performing these surgeries he invited men physicians and students to watch invasive and painful procedures while the women were exposed. On one of the women, named [[Anarcha Westcott|Anarcha]], he performed 13 surgeries without anesthesia.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Due to having so many enslaved women, he would rotate from one to another, continuously trying to perfect the repair of their fistulas. Physicians and students lost interest in assisting Sims over the course of his backyard practice, and he recruited other enslaved women, who were healing from their own surgeries, to assist him. In 1855 Sims went on to found the Woman's Hospital in New York, the first hospital specifically for female disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wallace-Sanders|first1=Kimberly|title=Skin Deep, Spirit Strong|date=2002|location=Mastering the Female Pelvis|url=https://as.vanderbilt.edu/archived/gfc/sitemason.vanderbilt.edu/files/dG8FJS/Kapsalis%202002.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examination==
[[File:Gynaecology-1822.jpg|thumb|The historic taboo associated with the examination of [[Female reproductive system (human)|female genitalia]] has long inhibited the science of gynaecology. This 1822 drawing by Jacques-Pierre Maygrier shows a "compromise" procedure, in which the [[physician]] is kneeling before the woman but cannot see her genitalia. Modern gynaecology no longer uses such a position.]]

In some countries, women must first see a [[general practitioner]] (GP; also known as a family practitioner (FP)) prior to seeing a gynaecologist. If their condition requires training, knowledge, surgical procedure, or equipment unavailable to the GP, the patient is then referred to a gynaecologist. In the [[United States]], however, law and many [[health insurance]] plans allow gynaecologists to provide [[primary care]] in addition to aspects of their own specialty. With this option available, some women opt to see a gynaecological surgeon for non-gynaecological problems without another physician's referral.

As in all of medicine, the main tools of diagnosis are clinical history and examination. Gynaecological examination is quite intimate, more so than a routine physical exam. It also requires unique instrumentation such as the [[speculum (medical)|speculum]]. The speculum consists of two hinged blades of concave metal or plastic which are used to retract the tissues of the vagina and permit examination of the [[cervix]], the lower part of the uterus located within the upper portion of the vagina. Gynaecologists typically do a bimanual examination (one hand on the abdomen and one or two fingers in the vagina) to palpate the cervix, uterus, ovaries and bony [[human pelvis|pelvis]]. It is not uncommon to do a [[rectovaginal examination]] for complete evaluation of the pelvis, particularly if any suspicious masses are appreciated. Male gynaecologists may have a female [[chaperone (clinical)|chaperone]] for their examination. An abdominal or vaginal [[obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasound]] can be used to confirm any abnormalities appreciated with the bimanual examination or when indicated by the patient's history.

==Diseases==
Examples of conditions dealt with by a gynaecologist are:
* [[Cancer]] and pre-cancerous diseases of the reproductive organs including ovaries, [[fallopian tube]]s, uterus, cervix, vagina, and vulva
* [[Urinary incontinence|Incontinence]] of urine
* [[Amenorrhoea]] (absent [[Menstrual cycle|menstrual periods]])
* [[dysmenorrhea|Dysmenorrhoea]] (painful menstrual periods)
* [[Infertility]]
* [[Menorrhagia]] (heavy menstrual periods); a common indication for [[hysterectomy]]
* [[Prolapse]] of pelvic organs
* [[Infections]] of the vagina ([[vaginitis]]), cervix and uterus (including [[fungus|fungal]], [[bacteria]]l, [[virus|viral]], and [[protozoa]]l)
* UTI and Pelvic Inflammatory Disease 
* Premenstrual Syndrome 
*Other [[vaginal disease]]s
There is some crossover in these areas. For example, a woman with urinary incontinence may be referred to a [[urology|urologist]].

==Therapies==
As with all surgical specialties, gynaecologists may employ medical or surgical therapies (or many times, both), depending on the exact nature of the problem that they are treating. Pre- and post-operative medical management will often employ many standard drug therapies, such as [[antibiotics]], [[diuretics]], [[antihypertensives]], and [[antiemetics]]. Additionally, gynaecologists make frequent use of specialized [[hormone]]-modulating therapies (such as [[Clomifene]] citrate and [[hormonal contraception]]) to treat disorders of the female genital tract that are responsive to [[pituitary]] or [[gonad]]al signals.

Surgery, however, is the mainstay of gynaecological therapy. For historical and political reasons, gynaecologists were previously not considered "surgeons", although this point has always been the source of some controversy. Modern advancements in both general surgery and gynaecology, however, have blurred many of the once rigid lines of distinction. The rise of sub-specialties within gynaecology which are primarily surgical in nature (for example urogynaecology and gynaecological oncology) have strengthened the reputations of gynaecologists as surgical practitioners, and many surgeons and surgical societies have come to view gynaecologists as comrades of sorts. As proof of this changing attitude, gynaecologists are now eligible for fellowship in both the [[American College of Surgeons]] and [[Royal College of Surgeons|Royal Colleges of Surgeons]], and many newer surgical textbooks include chapters on (at least basic) gynaecological surgery.

Some of the more common operations that gynaecologists perform include:
# [[Dilation and curettage]] (removal of the uterine contents  for various reasons, including completing a partial miscarriage and diagnostic sampling for dysfunctional uterine bleeding refractive to medical therapy)
# [[Hysterectomy]] (removal of the uterus)
# [[Oophorectomy]] (removal of the ovaries)
# [[Tubal ligation]] (a type of permanent sterilization)
# [[Hysteroscopy]] (inspection of the uterine cavity)
# Diagnostic [[laparoscopy]]&amp;nbsp;– used to diagnose and treat sources of pelvic and abdominal pain; perhaps most famously used to provide a definitive diagnosis of [[endometriosis]].
# Exploratory [[laparotomy]]&amp;nbsp;– may be used to investigate the level of progression of benign or malignant disease, or to assess and repair damage to the pelvic organs.
# Various surgical treatments for [[urinary incontinence]], including [[cystoscopy]] and sub-[[urethra]]l slings.
# Surgical treatment of pelvic organ [[prolapse]], including correction of [[cystocele]] and [[rectocele]].
# [[Appendectomy]]&amp;nbsp;– often performed to remove site of painful [[endometriosis]] implantation or prophylactically (against future acute [[appendicitis]]) at the time of [[hysterectomy]] or [[Caesarean section]]. May also be performed as part of a [[Cancer staging|staging]] operation for [[ovarian cancer]].
# Cervical Excision Procedures (including [[cryosurgery]])&amp;nbsp;– removal of the surface of the cervix containing pre-cancerous cells which have been previously identified on [[Pap smear]].

In the UK the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]], based in London, encourages the study and advancement of both the science and practice of obstetrics and gynaecology. This is done through postgraduate medical education and training development, and the publication of clinical guidelines and reports on aspects of the specialty and service provision. The RCOG International Office works with other international organisations to help lower maternal morbidity and mortality in under-resourced countries.

[[Gynecologic oncology|Gynaecologic oncology]] is a subspecialty of gynaecology, dealing with gynaecology-related [[cancer]].

==Gender of physicians==
Despite the patients being predominantly female, like all specialist areas of health, historically gynaecology has been dominated by male doctors. However, in recent times as many of the barriers to access the education and training required to successfully practice gynaecology were removed, women have started to outnumber men in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aao.org/yo/newsletter/200806/article04.cfm |title=From Past to Present: The Changing Demographics of Women in Medicine |date=2008-02-01 |accessdate=2014-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703164809/http://www.aao.org/yo/newsletter/200806/article04.cfm |archivedate=2014-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of reasons for this, ranging from women being motivated to become gynaecologists after having bad experiences with male doctors{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} to men choosing to specialize in different fields{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}.

Possible reasons reported for the decrease in male gynaecologists range from there being a perception of a lack of respect from other doctors towards them, distrust about their motivations for wanting to work exclusively with female sexual organs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thoughtcatalog.com/alexis-caputo/2013/12/why-are-men-gynaecologists/ |title=Why Are Men Gynaecologists? |date=2013-12-04 |accessdate=2014-06-24 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and questions about their overall character,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/witw/articles/2013/12/09/are-male-gynecologists-creepy.html|title= Are Male Gynecologists Creepy? |date=2013-12-09 |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a concern about being associated with other male gynaecologists who have been arrested for sex offences{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} and limited future employment opportunities{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}.

Surveys have also shown a large and consistent majority of women are uncomfortable being forced to have intimate exams done by a male doctor. They are also less likely to be embarrassed, so as a result talk more openly and in greater details, when discussing their sexual history with another woman rather than a man, leading to questions about the ability of male gynaecologists to offer quality care to patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073839910200174X

In the [[United States]], it has been reported that 4 in 5 students choosing a residency in gynaecology are now female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There have been a number of legal challenges in the US against healthcare providers who have started hiring based on gender of physicians. Dr Mircea Veleanu argued, in part, that his former employers discriminated against him by accommodating the wishes of female patients who had requested female doctors for intimate exams.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/07/us/women-s-health-is-no-longer-a-man-s-world.html |title= Women's Health Is No Longer a Man's World |date=2001-02-07 | accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A male nurse complained about an advert for an all-female obstetrics and gynaecology practice in [[Columbia, Maryland]] claiming this was a form of sexual discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-hs-women-doctors-20140202,0,3198562.story |title= Nurse questions all female OB-GYN practice |date=2014-02-02 | accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr David Garfinkel, a New Jersey-based ob-gyn sued his former employer after being fired due to, as he claimed, "because I was male, I wasn't drawing as many patients as they'd expected".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

So far, all legal challenges by male gynaecologists to remove patient choice have failed due to there being protection in law for 'bona fide occupational qualification' which in previous cases involving wash-room attendants and male nurses have recognized a justification for gender-based requirements for certain jobs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40004">{{About|the type of medical/psychological care}}
'''Hospice''' care is a type of care and philosophy of care that focuses on the [[palliative care|palliation]] of a [[Chronic (medicine)|chronically ill]], [[Terminal illness|terminally ill]] or seriously ill patient's pain and symptoms, and attending to their emotional and spiritual needs. In Western society, the concept of hospice has been evolving in Europe since the 11th century. Then, and for centuries thereafter in [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] tradition, hospices were places of hospitality for the sick, wounded, or dying, as well as those for travelers and pilgrims. The modern concept of hospice includes palliative care for the incurably ill given in such institutions as [[hospital]]s or [[nursing home]]s, but also care provided to those who would rather spend their last months and days of life in their own homes. The first modern hospice care was created by [[Cicely Saunders]] in 1967.

[[Hospice care in the United States|In the United States]] the term is largely defined by the practices of the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] system and other [[health insurance]] providers, which make hospice care available, either in an inpatient facility or at the patient's home, to patients with a terminal prognosis who are medically certified at hospice onset to have less than six months to live.  According to the NHPCO [National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization] 2012 report on facts and figures of Hospice care, 66.4% received care in their place of residence and 26.1% in a Hospice inpatient facility.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nhpco.org/sites/default/files/public/Statistics_Research/2012_Facts_Figures.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Rossi |first = Peggy |title= Case Management in Health Care: A Practical Guide |edition = 2 |publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences |year = 2003 |isbn = 0-7216-9558-2 |page = 123}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1970s the U.S. government began to view hospice care as a humane care option for the terminally ill. In 1982 Congress initiated the creation of the Medicare Hospice Benefit which became permanent in 1986. In 1993, President Clinton installed hospice as a guaranteed benefit and an accepted component of health care provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rnceus.com/course_frame.asp?exam_id=98&amp;directory=hospice|title=Interactive Online Continuing Education for Nurse Professionals|website=www.rnceus.com|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Outside the United States, the term ''hospice'' tends to be primarily associated with the particular buildings or institutions that specialize in such care (although so-called "hospice at home" services may also be available).{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Outside the United States such institutions may similarly provide care mostly in an end-of-life setting, but they may also be available for patients with other specific palliative care needs. Hospice care also involves assistance for patients’ families to help them cope with what is happening and provide care and support to keep the patient at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.n2information.com/article/ |title=End Of Life Care |publisher=N2Information |author=Suzanne Myers |accessdate=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the movement has met with some resistance, hospice has rapidly expanded through the [[United Kingdom]], the United States and elsewhere.

==History==

===Early development===
[[etymology|Etymologically]], the word "hospice" derives from the [[Latin]] ''hospes'', a word which served double duty in referring both to guests and hosts.&lt;ref name=Robbins&gt;{{cite book | last = Robbins | first = Joy | title = Caring for the Dying Patient and the Family | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | year = 1983 | page = 138 | isbn = 0-06-318249-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians believe the first hospices originated{{Where|date=February 2014}} in the 11th century, around 1065. The rise of the Crusading movement{{Where|date=February 2014}} in the 1090s saw the incurably ill permitted into places dedicated to treatment by [[Crusades|Crusaders]].&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Connor |first = Stephen R. |  title = Hospice: Practice, Pitfalls, and Promise | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | year = 1998 | isbn = 1-56032-513-5 | page = 4}}

Meanwhile, hospices also developed in other areas. In the [[United Kingdom]], attention was drawn to the needs of the terminally ill in the middle of the 19th century, with ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]'' and the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' publishing articles pointing to the need of the impoverished terminally ill for good care and sanitary conditions.&lt;ref name=L21&gt;Lewis, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Steps were taken to remedy inadequate facilities with the opening of the Friedenheim in London, which by 1892 offered 35 beds to patients dying of tuberculosis.&lt;ref name=L21/&gt; Four more hospices were established in London by 1905.&lt;ref name=L21/&gt; [[Australia]], too, saw active hospice development, with notable hospices including the [[Julia Farr Centre|Home for Incurables]] in [[Adelaide]] (1879), the Home of Peace (1902) and the Anglican House of Peace for the Dying in [[Sydney]] (1907).&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, 23-25.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, [[New York City]] saw the opening of St. Rose's Hospice by the Servants for Relief of Incurable Cancer, who soon expanded with six locations in other cities.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;

The more influential early developers of Hospice included the Irish [[Religious Sisters of Charity]], who opened [[Our Lady's Hospice]] in [[Harold's Cross]], [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]] in 1879.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt; It became very busy, with as many as 20,000 people—primarily suffering [[tuberculosis]] and [[cancer]]—coming to the hospice to die between 1845 and 1945.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt; The Sisters of Charity expanded internationally, opening the Sacred Heart Hospice for the Dying in Sydney in 1890, with hospices in [[Melbourne]] and [[New South Wales]] following in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, they opened [[St Joseph's Hospice]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name=C5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Foley | first = Kathleen M. |author2=Herbert Hendin | title = The Case Against Assisted Suicide: For the Right to End-of-life Care | publisher = JHU Press | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-8018-6792-4 | page = 281}}&lt;/ref&gt; There in the 1950s [[Cicely Saunders]] developed many of the foundational principles of modern hospice care.&lt;ref name=C5/&gt; Over the years these centers became more prompt and in the 1970s till now this is where they place people to live out their final day (DeSpelder, 2014).

[[Dame]] Cicely Saunders was a British [[registered nurse]] whose chronic health problems had forced her to pursue a career in [[medical social work]]. The relationship she developed with a dying [[Poland|Polish]] refugee helped solidify her ideas that terminally ill patients needed compassionate care to help address their fears and concerns as well as [[palliative]] comfort for physical symptoms.&lt;ref name=Poor&gt;{{cite book | last = Poor | first = Belinda |author2=Gail P.

When she achieved her degree in 1957, she took a position there.&lt;ref name=Poor/&gt;

Saunders emphasized focusing on the patient rather than the disease and introduced the notion of 'total pain',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Total Pain: The Work of Cicely Saunders and the Hospice Movement|author=David Clark|url=http://www.ampainsoc.org/pub/bulletin/jul00/hist1.htm|journal=APS Bulletin| volume = 10 |issue =  4|date=July–August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included psychological and spiritual as well as the physical aspects. She experimented with a wide range of [[opioid]]s for controlling physical pain but included also the needs of the patient's family.

She disseminated her philosophy internationally in a series of tours of the United States that began in 1963.&lt;ref name=Spratt&gt;{{cite book | last = Spratt | first = John Stricklin |author2=Rhonda L.

[[Florence Wald]], the dean of [[Yale School of Nursing]] who had heard Saunders speak in America, spent a month working with Saunders there in 1969 before bringing the principles of modern hospice care back to the United States, establishing Hospice, Inc. in 1971.&lt;ref name="C5"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WashPostObit&gt;Sullivan, Patricia.

At about the same time that Saunders was disseminating her theories and developing her hospice, in 1965, Swiss [[psychiatrist]] [[Elisabeth Kübler Ross]] also began to consider the social responses to terminal illness, which she found inadequate at the Chicago hospital where her American physician husband was employed.&lt;ref name=Reed&gt;{{cite news | last = Reed | first = Christopher | title = Elisabeth Kubler-Ross: Psychiatrist who identified five stages of dying - denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance | work = The Guardian | date = 2004-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her 1969 best-seller, ''[[On Death and Dying]]'', was influential on how the medical profession responded to the terminally ill,&lt;ref name=Reed/&gt; and along with Saunders and other [[thanatology]] pioneers helped to focus attention on the types of care available to them.&lt;ref name=Spratt/&gt;

Hospice has faced resistance springing from various factors, including professional or cultural [[taboo]]s against open communication about death among physicians or the wider population, discomfort with unfamiliar medical techniques, and professional callousness towards the terminally ill.&lt;ref name = Kirn&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kirn | first = Marie | title = Book review | journal = Journal of Palliative Medicine | date = June 1, 1998 | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 201–202 | doi = 10.1089/jpm.1998.1.201 | url = http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/jpm.1998.1.201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the movement has, with national differences in focus and application, spread throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bernat | first = James L. | title = Ethical Issues in Neurology | edition = 3, revised | publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7817-9060-3 | page = 154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Dr. [[Josefina Magno]], who had been instrumental in forming the [[American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine]] and sat as first executive director of the US [[National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization|National Hospice Organization]], founded the International Hospice Institute, which in 1996 became the International Hospice Institute and College and later the [[International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care]] (IAHPC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Saunders, Cicely M. |author2=David Clark | title= Cicely Saunders: Founder of the Hospice Movement : Selected Letters 1959-1999 | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-19-856969-6 | page = 283}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BMJ&gt;{{cite journal | last = Newman | first = Laura | title = Josefina Bautista Magno | date = 2009-09-27 | issue = 327 (7417) | page = 753 | quote = That vision, fuelled by her drive and gritty determination, led to the International Hospice Institute, soon to metamorphose into the International Hospice Institute and College as the need for education and training became recognised, and finally into today's International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care. | pmc=200824}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAHPC, with a board of directors as of 2008 from such diverse countries as [[Scotland]], [[Argentina]], [[China]] and [[Uganda]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hospicecare.com/Organisation/#directors | title = IAHPC Board of Directors | publisher = International Association for Hospice &amp; Palliative Care | accessdate = 2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; works from the philosophy that each country should develop a palliative care model based on its own resources and conditions, evaluating hospice experiences in other countries but adapting to their own needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hospicecare.com/History/history.htm | title = IAHPC History | publisher = International Association for Hospice &amp; Palliative Care | accessdate = 2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Derek Doyle, who was a founding member of IAHPC, told the ''British Medical Journal'' in 2003 that through her work the [[Philippine]]-born Magno had seen "more than 8000 hospice and palliative services established in more than 100 countries."&lt;ref name=BMJ/&gt; Standards for Palliative and Hospice Care have been developed in a number of countries around the world, including Australia, [[Canada]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Moldova]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hospicecare.com/standards/ | title = Standards for Palliative Care Provision | publisher = International Association for Hospice &amp; Palliative Care | accessdate = 2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the United States-based [[National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization]] (NHPCO) and the United Kingdom's [[Help the Hospices]] jointly commissioned an independent, international study of worldwide palliative care practices. Their survey found that 15% of the world's countries offered widespread palliative care services with integration into major health care institutions, while an additional 35% offered some form of palliative care services, though these might be localized or very limited.&lt;ref name=Connor&gt;{{cite book | last = Connor | first = Stephen | title = Hospice and Palliative Care: The Essential Guide | edition = 2nd | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2009 | isbn = 0-415-99356-3 | page = 202}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, there were an estimated 10,000 programs internationally intended to provide palliative care, although the term hospice is not always employed to describe such services.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

In hospice care the main guardians are the family care giver and a hospice nurse who makes periodic stops.  Hospice can be administered in a nursing home, hospice building, or sometimes a hospital; however, it is most commonly practiced in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Villet-Lagomarsino|first=A|title=Hospice and Palliative Care: A Comparison|publisher=PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/onourownterms/articles/versus.html|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to be considered for hospice care, one has to be terminally ill or expected to die within six months.

Since the foundation of hospice in Kenya in the early 1990s, palliative care has spread through the country.

In South Africa, hospice services are widespread, focusing on diverse communities (including orphans and homeless) and offered in diverse settings (including in-patient, day care and home care).&lt;ref name=Mapping/&gt; Over half of hospice patients in South Africa in the 2003–2004 year were diagnosed with [[AIDS]], with the majority of the remaining having been diagnosed with [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=Mapping/&gt; Palliative care in South Africa is supported by the Hospice Palliative Care Association of South Africa and by national programmes partly funded by the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]].&lt;ref name=Mapping/&gt;

[[Hospice Africa Uganda]] (HAU) founded by [[Anne Merriman]], began offering services in 1993 in a two-bedroom house loaned for the purpose by [[Nsambya Hospital]].&lt;ref name=Mapping/&gt; HAU has since expanded to a base of operations at [[Makindye]], [[Kampala]], with hospice services also offered at roadside clinics by Mobile Hospice [[Mbarara]] since January 1998. That same year saw the opening of Little Hospice Hoima in June. Hospice care in Uganda is supported by community volunteers and professionals, as [[Makerere University]] offers a distance diploma in palliative care.&lt;ref name=M15&gt;Wright et al, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Uganda has a strategic plan for palliative care and permits nurses and clinical officers from HAU to prescribe morphine.

Canadian physician [[Balfour Mount]], who first coined the term "palliative care", was a pioneer in the Canadian hospice movement, which focuses primarily on palliative care in a hospital setting.&lt;ref name=Forman&gt;{{cite book | last = Forman  | first = Walter B. |author2=Denice Kopchak Sheehan |author3=Judith A.

Given differences in medical funding in Canada, he determined that a hospital-based approach would be more affordable, creating a specialized ward at Royal Victoria in January, 1975.&lt;ref name=Feldberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=OttawaCitizen/&gt; For Canada, whose official languages include English and French, Mount felt the term "palliative care ward" would be more appropriate, as the word ''hospice'' was already used in France to refer to [[nursing home]]s.&lt;ref name=Feldberg/&gt;&lt;ref name=OttawaCitizen/&gt; Hundreds of palliative care programs followed throughout Canada through the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Feldberg et al., 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as of 2004, according to the Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association (CHPCA), hospice palliative care was only available to 5-15% of Canadians, with available services having decreased with reduced government funding.&lt;ref name=CHPCA&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chpca.net/public_policy_advocacy/january_2006_policy_alerts/Factsheet-HospicePalliativeCareinCanada-December+2+2004.pdf | title = Fact Sheet: Hospice Palliative Care in Canada  | date = December 2004 | publisher = Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association | accessdate = 2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Canadians were increasingly expressing a desire to die at home, but only two of Canada's ten provinces were provided medication cost coverage for care provided at home.&lt;ref name=CHPCA/&gt; Only four of the ten identified palliative care as a core health service.&lt;ref name=CHPCA/&gt; At that time, palliative care was not widely taught at nursing schools or universally certified at medical colleges; there were only 175 specialized palliative care physicians in all of Canada.&lt;ref name=CHPCA/&gt;

{{main|Hospice care in the United States}}

Hospice in the United States has grown from a volunteer-led movement to improve care for people dying alone, isolated, or in hospitals, to a significant part of the health care system. In 2010, an estimated 1.581 million patients received services from hospice. Hospice is the only Medicare benefit that includes pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, twenty-four-hour/seven-day-a-week access to care, and support for loved ones following a death. Hospice care is also covered by Medicaid and most private insurance plans.  Most hospice care is delivered at home. Hospice care is also available to people in home-like hospice residences, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, veterans' facilities, hospitals, and prisons. The first hospice in the US was the [[Connecticut Hospice]], located in [[Branford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/hospice/a4.html|title=The Hospice Experiment - American RadioWorks|author=American Public Media|work=publicradio.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first United States hospital-based palliative care programs began in the late 1980s by committed volunteers across the country.  The first hospital-based palliative care consult service developed in the United States was the [[Wayne State University School of Medicine]] in 1985 at [[Detroit Receiving Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Carlson |first= Richard |last2= Devich |first2= Lynn |last3= Frank |first3= Robert |date= 1988 |title= Development of a Comprehensive Supportive Care Team for the Hopelessly Ill on a University Hospital Medical Service |url= http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=370287 |journal= JAMA |publisher= |volume= 259 |issue= 3 |pages= 378–383 |doi= 10.1001/jama.1988.03720030038030 |access-date=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first United States-based palliative medicine and hospice service program was started in 1987 by Declan Walsh, MD at the [[Cleveland Clinic]] Cancer Center in Cleveland, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Walsh |first= Declan |date= 2000 |title= The Harry R.

Horvitz Center for Palliative Medicine which was designated as a World Health Organization international demonstration project and accredited by the European Society of Medical Oncology as an Integrated Center of Oncology and Palliative Care.   Other programs followed: most notable the Palliative Care Program at the Medical College of Wisconsin (1993); Pain and Palliative Care Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (1996); and The Lilian and Benjamin Hertzberg Palliative Care Institute, Mount Sinai School of Medicine (1997).

Hospice plays an important role in reducing Medicare costs. Over the past 20–30 years 27-30% of Medicare's total budget was spent on individuals in their last year of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hogan C. |author2=Lunney J.

Hospice care may involve not treating illnesses. Patients and family members should understand the care or lack of care that is planned. If one has pneumonia, it may (or may not) be treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hospicepatients.org/clinging-to-hospice-standards-infection.html|title=Clinging to the Original Hospice Mission - Part One:  Infections in the Terminally Ill|work=hospicepatients.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; If not treated, this might actually increase suffering.  If the illness of the patient is not related to the terminal illness covered under the clinical determination of eligibility, the patient may seek standard treatment to address the cause of the suffering if they request such treatment.  Any Medicare services received by a hospice patient are covered under original Medicare including those hospice patients who have a Medicare Advantage plan and also services provided by a primary care physician for unrelated hospice treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicare.gov/what-medicare-covers/part-a/how-hospice-works.html|title=How hospice works|work=medicare.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hospice movement has grown dramatically in the United Kingdom since Dame [[Cicely Saunders]] opened [[St Christopher's Hospice]] in 1967, widely considered the first modern hospice. According to the UK's Help the Hospices, in 2011 UK hospice services consisted of 220 inpatient units for adults with 3,175 beds, 42 inpatient units for children with 334 beds, 288 home care services, 127 hospice at home services, 272 day care services, and 343 hospital support services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.helpthehospices.org.uk/about-hospice-care/facts-figures/ | title = Facts and figures | publisher = Help the Hospices | accessdate = 2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; These services together helped over 250,000 patients in 2003 and 2004. Funding varies from 100% funding by the [[National Health Service]] to almost 100% funding by charities, but the service is always free to patients. The UK's palliative care has been ranked as the best in the world "due to comprehensive national policies, the extensive integration of palliative care into the National Health Service, a strong hospice movement, and deep community engagement on the issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Quality of Death Index 2015: Ranking palliative care across the world |url=http://www.economistinsights.com/healthcare/analysis/quality-death-index-2015 |accessdate=8 October 2015 |work=The Economist Intelligence Unit |date=6 October 2015 |postscript=none |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009031039/http://www.economistinsights.com/healthcare/analysis/quality-death-index-2015 |archivedate=9 October 2015 |df= }}; {{cite news|title=UK end-of-life care 'best in world' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34415362 |accessdate=8 October 2015 |work=BBC |date=6 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2006 about 4% of all deaths in England and Wales occurred in a hospice setting (about 20,000 patients);&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmpubacc/99/9905.htm End of life care: 1. The current place and quality of end of life care], [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]], 30 March 2009, paragraphs 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt; a further number of patients spent time in a hospice, or were helped by hospice-based support services, but died elsewhere.

Hospices also provide volunteering opportunities for over 100,000 people in the UK, whose economic value to the hospice movement has been estimated at over £112 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helpthehospices.org.uk/about-hospice-care/facts-figures/ Help The Hospices]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Joseph Doyle earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Cornell University]] in 1996, after which he worked as an assistant economist at the [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York]] (1996–98) while studying at the [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]] (1997–98). Thereafter, Doyle obtained a [[Ph.D.]] in economics with a focus on [[econometrics]] and the [[economics of the public sector]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 2002. After completing his studies, he began his career at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] as an assistant professor (2002–05). In 2005, Doyle became the Jon D. Gruber Career Development Assistant Professor (2005–08), then associate professor (2008–09), the Alfred Henry and Jean Morrison Hayes Career Development Associate Professor (2009-2013), and has been the Erwin H. Schell Professor of Management since 2013. In parallel, Doyle has held visiting appointments at the [[Paris School of Economics]] (2010) and the [[European University Institute]] (2017-18). Doyle is co-director of the MIT Sloan Initiative for Health Systems Innovation and maintains professional affiliations with the [[Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab]] (J-PAL) as co-chair of its Health Sector, with the [[National Bureau of Economic Research|NBER]] as research associate, and with the Danish National Centre for Social Research as a research fellow. Moreover, he performs editorial duties at the ''[[Journal of Human Resources]]'', served as co-editor of the ''[[Journal of Public Economics]]'' (2012–16) and is a member of the [[American Economic Association]] as well as of the [[American Society of Health Economists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mit.edu/~jjdoyle/doylecv.pdf Curriculum vitae of Joseph Doyle.

== Research ==

Joseph Doyle's research interests include [[public economics]], [[health economics]], and [[labour economics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mit.edu/~jjdoyle/doylecv.pdf Curriculum vitae of Joseph Doyle. Retrieved February 19th, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; Key findings of his research include the following:
* Children in the U.S. on the margin of being placed in [[foster care]] (e.g. in cases where the recommendations of child protection investigators disagree) are on average better off if they remain at home, especially for older children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mit.edu/~jjdoyle/doyle_fosterlt_march07_aer.pdf Doyle, J.J. Jr. (2007). Child protection and child outcomes: Measuring the effects of foster care. ''American Economic Review'',  97(5), pp. 1583-1610.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Juvenile incarceration in the U.S. decreases the likelihood of incarcerated individuals completing high school and increases the likelihood of adult (re-)incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1093/qje/qjv003| title=Juvenile Incarceration, Human Capital, and Future Crime: Evidence from Randomly Assigned Judges| journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics| volume=130| issue=2| pages=759–803| year=2015| last1=Aizer| first1=Anna| last2=Doyle| first2=Joseph J.|hdl = 1721.1/97380}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Children in the U.S. on the margin of placement in foster care are two to three times more likely to enter the criminal justice system as adults if they were placed in foster care, a situation that is disproportionately common for [[African Americans]], girls and young adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1086/590216|title = Child Protection and Adult Crime: Using Investigator Assignment to Estimate Causal Effects of Foster Care| journal=Journal of Political Economy| volume=116| issue=4| pages=746–770|year = 2008|last1 = Doyle Jr|first1 = Joseph J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, Doyle's research with [[Douglas Almond]], [[Heidi Williams]] and Amanda E. Kowalski on the marginal returns of medical care for at-risk [[newborn]]s was awarded the Garfield Economic Impact Award by Research!America in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchamerica.org/news-events/awards/other-award-programs/garfield-award-2011 Research!America (December 8th, 2011). Authors of Landmark Study on Economic Benefits of Advanced Medical Care for At-Risk Newborns Receive Garfield Economic Impact Award. Retrieved on February 19th, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; The study showed that medical care prescribed as a result of newborns being slightly below the critical birthweight threshold of 1,500 grams was effective in substantially decreasing the mortality of these newborns relative to newborns slightly above the threshold. The authors then use the cost of the decrease in mortality rates for these newborns to estimate the cost for saving a newborn's statistical life to be about $550,000 in 2006 US$, i.e. well below common estimates of the value of a full statistical life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc = 2903901|year = 2010|last1 = Almond|first1 = D.|title = Estimating Marginal Returns to Medical Care: Evidence from At-Risk Newborns|journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume = 125|issue = 2|pages = 591–634|last2 = Doyle Jr|first2 = J.

The U.S. '''Kefauver Harris Amendment''' or "Drug Efficacy Amendment" is a 1962 amendment to the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]].

It introduced a requirement for drug manufacturers to provide proof of the effectiveness and safety of their drugs before approval,&lt;ref name="Peltzman, Sam 1051"&gt;Peltzman, Sam. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1830639  An Evaluation of Consumer Protection Legislation: The 1962 Drug Amendments]. The Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 81, No. 5. (Sep. - Oct., 1973), pp. 1051.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/CentennialofFDA/CentennialEditionofFDAConsumer/ucm093787.htm |title=Promoting Safe and Effective Drugs for 100 Years |work=The Kefauver-Harris Drug Amendments |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration }}&lt;/ref&gt; required drug advertising to disclose accurate information about side effects, and stopped cheap generic drugs being marketed as expensive drugs under new trade names as new "breakthrough" medications.

==Background==
The amendment was a response to the [[Thalidomide]] tragedy, in which thousands of children were born with birth defects as a result of their mothers taking thalidomide for morning sickness during pregnancy. The bill by [[U.S. Senator]] [[Estes Kefauver]], of [[Tennessee]], and [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Oren Harris]], of [[Arkansas]], required drug manufacturers to provide proof of the effectiveness and safety of their drugs before approval. It should be noted that Thalidomide had not been approved for use in the United States and that the tragic birth defects that occurred were in other countries. [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]] was the FDA reviewer who refused to approve Thalidomide for use.

It introduced a "proof-of-efficacy" requirement for the first time.&lt;ref name="Peltzman, Sam 1051"/&gt; In addition, the Amendment required drug advertising to disclose accurate information about side effects and efficacy of treatments. Finally, cheap generic drugs could no longer be marketed as expensive drugs under new trade names as new "breakthrough" medications.

The law was signed by President [[John F. Kennedy]] on October 10, 1962.

==Effect==
The Kefauver Harris Amendment strengthened the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]'s control of [[Human experimentation|experimentation on humans]] and changed the way new [[drugs]] are approved and regulated. Before the Thalidomide scandal in Europe, and Canada,&lt;ref name=pmid14076167&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Webb JF | title = Canadian Thalidomide Experience | journal = Can Med Assoc J | volume = 89 | issue =  | pages = 987–92 | date = November 1963 | pmid = 14076167 | pmc = 1921912 }}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. drug companies only had to show their new products were safe. After the passage of the Amendment, an FDA [[New Drug Application]] (NDA) would have to show that a new drug was both safe and effective (previously the 1938 [[Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act]] was the main law that regulated drug safety). [[Informed consent]] was required of patients participating in clinical trials, and [[adverse drug reaction]]s were required to be reported to the FDA.

The [[Drug Efficacy Study Implementation]] was begun to classify all pre-1962 drugs that were already on the market as either effective, ineffective, or needing further study.

[[Estes Kefauver]] considered the Amendment his "finest achievement" in consumer protection{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}.

[[Louis Lasagna]], then a prominent clinical pharmacologist at the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], advised Congress about the proper conduct of clinical research during the 1962 hearings leading up to passage of the Amendment.

The law also exempted from the "[[Delaney clause]]" (a 1958 amendment to the Food, Drugs, and Cosmetic Act of 1938) certain animal drugs and animal feed additives shown to induce cancer, but which left no detectable levels of residue in the human food supply.

:*  [[American cuisine]] (USA) – is a style of food preparation derived from the United States. The cuisine has a history dating back before the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial period]] when the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] had a rich and diverse cooking style for an equally diverse amount of ingredients. With [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]], the style of cookery changed vastly, with numerous ingredients introduced from Europe, as well as cooking styles and modern [[cookbook]]s. The style of cookery continued to expand into the 19th and 20th centuries with the influx of immigrants from various nations across the world. This influx has created a rich diversity and a unique regional character throughout the country. In addition to cookery, [[cheese]] and wine play an important role in the cuisine. The wine industry is regulated by [[American Viticultural Area]]s (AVA) (regulated appellation), similar to those laws found in countries such as France and Italy.

:::*  [[California cuisine]] is a style of cuisine marked by an interest in [[Fusion cuisine|fusion]] (integrating disparate cooking styles and ingredients) and in the use of freshly prepared local ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;"The birth of California cuisine is generally traced back to Alice Waters in the 1970s and her restaurant Chez Panisse. Waters introduced the idea of using natural, locally grown fresh ingredients to produce her dishes. California cuisine is... local, based like most traditional regional cooking on available ingredients including abundant seafood. Fresh vegetables, lightly cooked, and fresh fruits, berries, and herbs characterize the cuisine generally, but California cooking is also in fact a fusion of cooking from around the world."

::::More recently, [[Baja Med]] cuisine has developed in [[Tijuana]] and elsewhere in [[Baja California]], combining Mexican with Mediterranean flavors.

::::Recently other cuisines of the world have acquired popularity in Mexico, thus adopting a Mexican fusion. For example, sushi in Mexico is often made with a variety of sauces based on [[mango]] or [[tamarind]], and very often served with [[Serrano pepper|serrano]]-chili-blended soy sauce, or complimented with [[Habanero chili|habanero]] and [[chipotle]] peppers.

* [[South American cuisine]] – Some of the richest food products of [[South America]] come from the middle of the continent, the [[Amazon basin]]. For example, the Amazon region provides a plethora of fresh fish and [[tropical fruit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brazil-travel-guide.com/Amazon-Fish.html "Amazonian Cuisine."] [http://www.brazil-travel-guide.com Brazil-travel-guide.com]. Accessed July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In countries like [[Peru]] there is a strong influence of the [[Inca empire]] and their [[Inca cuisine|cuisine]]. [[Potato]]es are frequently grown as a result of this, and also plants such as [[quinoa]]. On the Southern tip of South America lies the [[Pacific Ocean]], which provides a large array of [[seafood]]. Many plains also are on this continent, which are rich for growing food in abundance. In the [[Patagonia]] south of [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]], many people produce [[Domestic sheep|lamb]] and [[venison]]. [[King crab]] is typically caught at the southern end of the continent. [[Antarctic krill]] has just recently been discovered and is now another food source. [[Tuna]] and tropical fish are caught all around the continent; [[Easter Island]] is one place where they are found in abundance. [[Lobster]] is also caught in great quantities from [[Juan Fernández Islands|Juan Fernández]]. In [[Brazil]] the most traditional dish is the [[feijoada]].

:* [[Brazilian cuisine]], like [[Brazil]] itself, varies greatly by [[Regions of Brazil|region]]. The natural crops available in each region add to their singularity. Some typical dishes are [[Caruru (food)|caruru]], which consists of okra, onion, dried shrimp and toasted nuts (peanuts or cashews) cooked with [[palm oil]] until a spread-like consistency is reached and [[moqueca]] capixaba, consisting of slow-cooked fish, tomato, onion and garlic topped with [[cilantro]].
:*  [[Chilean cuisine]] stems mainly from the combination of Spanish cuisine with traditional [[Chile]]an ingredients, with later influences from other [[Europe]]an cuisines, particularly from [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Croatia]], [[France]] and the [[Middle East]]. The food tradition and recipes in Chile stand out due to the varieties in flavors and colors. The country's long coastline and the Chilean peoples' relationship with the [[Pacific Ocean|sea]] adds an immense array of ocean products to the variety of the food in Chile. The country's waters are home to unique species of fish and shellfish such as the [[Patagonian toothfish|Chilean sea bass]], [[concholepas concholepas|loco]] and [[picoroco]].

* As there is no one homogeneous Caribbean, there is also no one Caribbean cuisine, but one based on European historical grouping and colonization. There are two broad based or types of cuisines in the Caribbean area. One is based around Western European colonized groupings such as British, French, Dutch and the other Spanish-based like in Central America and most of South America, or Latin based. Both incorporate a European influence (s) together with an Indigenous (Mayan, Aztec or [[Amerindian cuisine|Amerindian]]), and a [[West African cuisine|West African]] influence as a base. 
The dishes made in the previously [[British cuisine|British]] and French Islands and territories in the Caribbean are much more diverse than the islands colonized by [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] due to a history of changing colonial administration or ownership (between British, French, Dutch and Spanish), and the migration of diverse groups brought to work on plantations including Indians from Indian, Chinese and Portuguese (Madeira and Azores).

There is even much diversity within each previous colonial groupings. While both Trinidad and Jamaica were both British colonies and share similar cooking styles, the scope of dishes in Trinidad are different and more diverse due to a very different population make up. 
The similarities in the larger region lie mostly in the fruits and vegetables consumed and the ingredients used in cooking, with the use of root vegetables, plantains, beans, and rice, fish and seafood being a common denominator. In the post independence and post colonial era, and with globalization in the 1990s cultural and food similarities between the previous British, still French and Dutch Island and territories were magnified.

== Latin American cuisine ==
* [[Latin American cuisine]] – incorporates influences from all over the world. Most came due to colonization and the resulting mixtures among the Native Americans, European immigrants, and African slaves. Different waves of immigration (Some resulting from wars, such as [[World War II]]) have also had a hand in this mixture, mainly in the form of immigrants from central and eastern Europe and from east Asia (mainly [[China]] and [[Japan]]).

These bacteria may be detected as transients or are marginally discernable with PCR techniques. They are also opportunistic pathogens and their overgrowth is considered an infection though symptoms and signs may be absent.

While the vaginal microbiota is populated predominantly by ''Lactobacillus'' spp. in 71% of women, 29% of asymptomatic, healthy women possess a microbiota essentially lacking in ''Lactobacillus'' and instead the following groups have been isolated from this population.  This microbiota is affiliated with ethnicity:

==Microbiota changes==
Pre-pubescent girls, women in menarch, and postmenopausal women have lower populations of ''Lactobacillus'' spp. in proportion to the other species. [[Hormone replacement therapy]] in [[postmenopausal]] women restores the microbiota to that of a reproductive-aged woman. The microbiota populations change in response to the menstrual cycle. Pregnancy alters the microbiota, with a reduction in species/genus diversity.&lt;ref name="ClarkTal2014"/&gt;
Overgrowth of ''Candida albicans'' or other ''Candida'' ([[yeast infections]]) sometimes occurs after antibiotic therapy.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012"/&gt; [[Bacterial vaginosis]] results in altered populations and ratios of the normal microbiota.&lt;ref name="ClarkTal2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brotman2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brotman|first1=Rebecca M.|title=Vaginal microbiome and sexually transmitted infections: an epidemiologic perspective|journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation|volume=121|issue=12|year=2011|pages=4610–4617|issn=0021-9738|doi=10.1172/JCI57172|pmid=22133886|pmc=3225992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melarsoprol has a high number of side effects.&lt;ref name=WHO2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Trypanosomiasis, human African (sleeping sickness)|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs259/en/|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=7 December 2016|date=February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204153318/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs259/en/|archivedate=4 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common side effects include [[encephalopathy|brain dysfunction]], numbness, rashes, and kidney and liver problems.&lt;ref name=Drugs1994/&gt; About 1-5% of people die during treatment.&lt;ref name=WHO1995&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Jh2922e/2.10.3.html#Jh2922e.2.10.3|title=WHO Model Prescribing Information: Drugs Used in Parasitic Diseases - Second Edition: Protozoa: African trypanosomiasis: Melarsoprol|website=WHO|date=1995|access-date=2016-11-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110044003/http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Jh2922e/2.10.3.html#Jh2922e.2.10.3|archivedate=2016-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency|glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency]], [[hemolysis|red blood cell breakdown]] may occur.&lt;ref name=Drugs1994/&gt; It has not been studied in [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=Drugs1994/&gt; It works by blocking [[pyruvate kinase]], an enzyme required for the parasite to make [[adenosine triphosphate]].&lt;ref name=Drugs1994/&gt;

&lt;!-- History and culture --&gt;
Melarsoprol has been used medically since 1949.&lt;ref name=CDC2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Formulary Infectious Diseases Laboratories CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/laboratory/drugservice/formulary.html#tmelarsoprol|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=7 December 2016|date=22 September 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216173833/https://www.cdc.gov/laboratory/drugservice/formulary.html#tmelarsoprol|archivedate=16 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]], the most effective and safe medicines needed in a [[health system]].&lt;ref name=WHO19th&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (19th List)|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EML_2015_FINAL_amended_NOV2015.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=8 December 2016|date=April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213052708/http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EML_2015_FINAL_amended_NOV2015.pdf?ua=1|archivedate=13 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regions of the world where the disease is common, melarsoprol is provided for free by the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name=WHO2016/&gt; It is not commercially available in Canada or the United States.&lt;ref name=Drugs1994/&gt; In the United States, it may be obtained from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], while in Canada it is available from [[Health Canada]].&lt;ref name=CDC2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Drugs1994/&gt;

==Medical uses==
People diagnosed with trypanosome-caused disease should be treated with an anti-trypanosomal. Treatment is based on stage, 1 or 2, and parasite,''T. b. rhodesiense'' or ''T. b. gambiense''. In stage 1 disease, trypanosomes are present only in the peripheral circulation. In stage 2 disease, trypanosomes have crossed the blood brain barrier and are present in the central nervous system.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt;

The following are considerable treatment options:&lt;ref name="CDC2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author=CDC |title=Disease Control and Prevention: Parasites – African Trypanosomiasis |year=2013 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/sleepingsickness/health_professionals/index.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619152551/https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/sleepingsickness/health_professionals/index.html |archivedate=2017-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melarsoprol is a treatment used during the second stage of the disease. So far, it is the only treatment available for late-stage ''T. b. rhodesiense''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.antimicrobe.org/b54.asp|title=Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (African Trypanosomiasis) - Infectious Disease and Antimicrobial Agents|website=www.antimicrobe.org|access-date=2016-11-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128184244/http://www.antimicrobe.org/b54.asp|archivedate=2016-11-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to high toxicity, melarsoprol is reserved only for the most dangerous cases. Other agents associated with lower [[toxicity]] levels are used during stage 1 of the disease.&lt;ref name="“Ref 1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bisser S |title=Equivalence trial of melarsoprol and nifurtimox monotherapy and combination therapy for the treatment of second-stage Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense sleeping sickness |journal=J.

Failure rates of 27% in certain African countries have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=March 2004|title=Human African trypanosomiasis|url=|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|volume=2|pages=186–187|via=|doi=10.1038/nrmicro848}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was caused by both [[drug resistance]] and additional mechanisms that have not yet been elucidated. Resistance is likely due to transport problems associated with the P2 transporter, an adenine-adenosine transporter. Resistance can occur with point mutations within this [[Membrane transport protein|transporter]].&lt;ref name="“Ref 3"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2011|title=Goodman &amp; Gillman’s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics|publisher=McGraw Hill Medical|pages=1427–28|author=Brunton L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance has been present since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=November 2001|title=The phenomenon of treatment failures in Human African Trypanosomiasis|url=|journal=Tropical Medicine and International Health|volume=6|pages=906–914|via=|doi=10.1046/j.1365-3156.2001.00775.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side effects==
Although melarsoprol cures about 96% of people with late stage disease, its toxicity limits its use.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; About 1-5% of people die during treatment.&lt;ref name=WHO1995 /&gt; As a toxic organic compound of [[arsenic]], melarsoprol is a dangerous treatment that is typically only administered by injection under the supervision of a licensed physician. Notable side effects are similar to arsenic poisoning. Among clinicians, it is colloquially referred to as "arsenic in antifreeze".&lt;ref name="Ref 10"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hollingham R | title = Curing diseases modern medicine has left behind | journal = New Scientist | year = 2005 | volume = 2005 | issue = 2482 | pages = 40–41 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18524821.800-curing-diseases-modern-medicine-has-left-behind.html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150511085448/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18524821.800-curing-diseases-modern-medicine-has-left-behind.html | archivedate = 2015-05-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Severe and life-threatening adverse reactions are associated with melarsoprol. It is known to cause a range of side effects including convulsions, fever, loss of consciousness, rashes, bloody stools, nausea and vomiting. In approximately 5-10% of cases, it causes [[encephalopathy]]. Of those, about 50% die due to encephalopathy-related adverse reactions.&lt;ref name=CDC2013/&gt; Additional potentially serious side effects of melarsoprol include damage to the heart, presence of albumin in the urine that could be associated with kidney damage, and an increase in blood pressure.&lt;ref name=WHO1995/&gt;

===Cautions===
Numerous warnings must be examined before melarsoprol treatment can be initiated. Prior to initiation, the following must be noted: [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], kidney or liver disease, cardiac problems (high blood pressure, irregular beating of the heart or [[Cardiac arrhythmia|arrhythmias,]] any damage to the heart muscles and potential signs of [[heart failure]]), preexisting nervous system disorders, and any signs of leprosy.

Routine laboratory testing is needed before and after melarsoprol initiation. Laboratory parameters for both therapeutic effects and toxic effects need to be evaluated.

Blood analysis is used to detect the presence of trypanosomes. An evaluation of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] via a [[lumbar puncture]] is also used to determine an individual's white blood count and level of protein. These are diagnostic criteria such that the presence of trypanosomes, an elevated white blood count greater than five per microliter, or a protein content greater than 40&amp;nbsp;mg are considered abnormal and initiation should be considered. Continuous cerebrospinal fluid evaluation should be repeated every six months for at least three years in individuals that have undergone melarsoprol treatment.

To assess potential concerns related to toxicity, the following should be completed: a complete blood count, an assessment of [[electrolyte]] levels, liver and kidney function tests, and a [[Clinical urine tests|urinalysis]] to detect the appearance, concentration and content of the urine.

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
Currently, melarsoprol is not recommended for use in pregnant women. The World Health Organization suggests that treatment be deferred until immediately after delivery since the effects of the medication on the developing fetus have not yet been established.&lt;ref name=WHO1995 /&gt;

Lactation guidelines associated with melarsoprol have not yet been established.

==Mechanism of action==
Melarsoprol is a prodrug, which is metabolized to melarsen oxide (Mel Ox) as its active form. Mel Ox is an arsen-oxide that irreversibly binds to vicinal [[sulfhydryl]] groups on [[pyruvate kinase]], which disrupts energy production in the parasite. The inability to distinguish between host and parasites renders this drug highly toxic with many side effects.

Mel Ox reacts with [[trypanothione]] (a spermidine-glutathione adduct that replaces glutathione in trypanosomes). By binding to this adduct, it forms a melarsen oxide-trypanothione adduct (Mel T) that competitively inhibits trypanothione reductase, effectively killing the parasitic cell.&lt;ref name="“Ref 3"/&gt;

==Dosage==
Two arsenic-containing [[stereoisomers]] exist in a 3:1 molar ratio. Since melarsarprol is insoluble in water, dosage occurs via a 3.6% [[propylene glycol]] intravenous injection.&lt;ref name="“Ref 3"/&gt; To avoid the risk of injection site reactions, melarsoprol must be given slowly.

Melarsoprol used for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis with CNS involvement is given under a complicated dosing schedule. The dosing schedule for children and adults is 2-3.6&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day intravenously for three days, then repeated every seven days for a total of three series.&lt;ref name=CDC2013/&gt; To monitor for relapse, follow-up is recommended every 6 months for at least 2 years.&lt;ref name=WHO1995 /&gt;

==Pharmacokinetics==
The [[half-life]] of melarsoprol is less than one hour, but bioassays indicate a 35-hour half-life. This is commonly associated with pharmacologic agents that have active metabolites. One such metabolite, Mel Ox, reaches maximum plasma levels about 15 minutes after melarsoprol injection. Melarsoprol clearance is 21.5 ml/min/kg and the Mel Ox half-life is approximately 3.9 hours.&lt;ref name="“Ref 8"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keiser J. |title=Investigations of the metabolites of the trypanocidal drug melarsoprol |journal=Clinical Pharmacology |volume=67 |pages=478–88 |year=2000 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Ericsson O |author3=Burri C |doi=10.1067/mcp.2000.105990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
Melarsoprol is produced by [[sanofi-aventis|Sanofi-Aventis]] and under an agreement with WHO, they donate melarsoprol to countries where the disease is common.

[[File:Methamphetamine.png|thumb|345x345px|Chemical compound make up of Methamphetamine]]
[[Methamphetamine]] is an [[Illegal substances|illegal substance]] sought after by many in [[Australia]] to give oneself a ‘high’ or a ‘rush’ in their body.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=9781922084583}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methamphetamine has many names not only in Australia, but also around the world. These include Chalk, Crypto, Getgo, Tweak, and Cristy, although the two most common ones in Australia today are [[Amphetamine|Speed]] and Ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugfreeworld.org/drugfacts/crystalmeth/what-does-methamphetamine-look-like.html|title=Watch Truth About Drugs Documentary Video &amp; Learn About Substance Addiction. Get The Facts About Painkillers, Marijuana, Cocaine, Meth &amp; Other Illegal Drugs.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users of this drug often feel senses of exhilaration and arousal as the [[brain]] is flooded with [[Monoamine neurotransmitter|monoamines]] which kill [[Amino acid|receptors]] and leaves them wanting more as it is the only way they can have these sensations following use of the drug, and kills the remaining receptors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Methamphetamine was synthesized in [[Japan]] during 1893 from a drug called [[ephedrine]];&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3189445 | pmid=21991491 | doi=10.5402/2011/974768 | volume=2011 | title=The pH Levels of Different Methamphetamine Drug Samples on the Street Market in Cape Town | year=2011 | journal=ISRN Dent | pages=974768 | last1 = Grobler | first1 = SR | last2 = Chikte | first2 = U | last3 = Westraat | first3 = J}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since then has changed into a variety of different forms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Australia has a drug scene which is increasing with the demand for drugs like methamphetamine since the start of 2000. As of April 2017, Australia has the highest methamphetamine addiction rate in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australia is flailing in the face of a meth epidemic|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21720595-addiction-rate-worlds-highest-australia-flailing-face-meth-epidemic|accessdate=14 April 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Methamphetamine]] was first synthesized in [[Japan]] by a chemist named Nagai;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; however, it did not come into prominent public view until the early 1990s when the [[Australian Federal Police]] (AFP) was warned of a new drug called "Ice" coming from overseas. During 1991, [[Hong Kong]], [[Japan]] and [[Australia]] pooled their resources together to seize 80 kilograms of the methamphetamine drug which was believed to be manufactured in China.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2006/20060320_ice/chronology.htm|title=Four Corners - 20/03/2006: Chronology: The Emergence of Methamphetamine in Australia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, methamphetamine has been readily made available in many forms to have a spike in 2001 to 2003 where the [[Australian Customs and Border Protection Service|Australian Customs]] detected increasingly large quantities crossing the [[Australia|Australia Border]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/publications.nsf/0/c4f93886027fd310ca25723c001355a4/$FILE/CrystalMeth%20and%20Index.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This is portrayed with the statistics of seizures from 1996 to 1997 being 156 kilograms increasing over tenfold to 1.8 tonnes during 2001 to 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/resource/methamphetamine-situation-australia-review-routine-data-sources|title=The methamphetamine situation in Australia: A review of routine data sources -  Resource - NDARC - National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend has been continuing to the present day. Today, the drug is in high demand all across [[Australia]], and with this the [[Australian Federal Police|authorities]] have been seizing large quantities on a regular basis.

During November 2014, the [[Australian Federal Police|AFP]] successfully intercepted and seized Australia’s second largest drug bust which weighed in at 2.8 Tonnes, which included 1.917 tonnes of MDMA and 849 kilograms of methamphetamine.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-29/six-charged-over-enormous-15b-drug-bust/5927904|title=Police seize 2.8 tonnes of drugs in Australia's second largest bust|date=29 November 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made the bust be the largest methamphetamine seizure and the second largest [[MDMA]] bust by the AFP&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; since the first seizure in 1997.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

[[File:Homemade Crystal Meth Bong.jpg|thumb|296x296px|Homemade meth bong, another way which drug users get a 'high'.]]
Between 2009 and 2010 there were 41,087 illicit drug offenses in Australia. Between 2013 and 2014 this number increased by over 25 percent to 50,854 drug offenses;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4513.0/&lt;/ref&gt; furthermore, drug use increased from 22,842 to 28,409 over the same period of time.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This portrays an increasing trend in the amount of drug use in [[Australia]] and drug offenses. However, since [[methamphetamine]] has become more available in the drug scene in [[Australia]], it has developed and stronger forms of [[methamphetamine]] such as [[Crystal methamphetamine|Crystal Methamphetamine]] has in turn increased in the usages over the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=18368605|year=2008|author1=Degenhardt|first1=L|title=The epidemiology of methamphetamine use and harm in Australia|journal=Drug and Alcohol Review|volume=27|issue=3|pages=243–52|last2=Roxburgh|first2=A|last3=Black|first3=E|last4=Bruno|first4=R|last5=Campbell|first5=G|last6=Kinner|first6=S|last7=Fetherston|first7=J|doi=10.1080/09595230801950572}}&lt;/ref&gt; In studies conducted by the [[Australian Government]], between 1998 and 2010 there has been a slight decrease in the [[methamphetamine]] drug use in [[Australia]];&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;http://www.aihw.gov.au/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=10737421314&lt;/ref&gt; furthermore, between 2007 and 2010 methamphetamine use in males decreased from 9.8% to 6.8%.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Since 2007, the trend has decreased in association to drug use with methamphetamine; however, after 2010 the trend according to the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] indicate an increase in drug use and drug offenses occurring in Australia.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Risk groups ==

Methamphetamine use is an increasing problem in [[Australia]], as it becomes more readily available. In a study of [[injecting drug users]], 53% of a group of 914 candidates reported that methamphetamine was their first drug injected into their bodies; however, the study continued to convey the point that it is a young adults' drug.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Drug use and risk among regular injecting drug users in Australia: does age make a difference?|first1=Louisa|last1=Degenhardt|first2=Stuart A.|last2=Kinner|first3=Amanda|last3=Roxburgh|first4=Emma|last4=Black|first5=Raimondo|last5=Bruno|first6=James|last6=Fetherston|first7=Craig L.|last7=Fry|date=1 July 2008|publisher=|journal=Drug Alcohol Rev|volume=27|issue=4|pages=357–360|via=|doi=10.1080/09595230701750643|pmid=18584384}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the last six months, 87% of injecting drug users under the age of 25 were reported to have used [[methamphetamine]] in the last 6 months, with 25 to 35-year-olds at 80% and 35 years and above at 74%.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The [[Australian Institute of Health and Welfare]] reported that males were more likely than females to use [[methamphetamine]] (8.2% to 5.9% respectively) and 20- to 29-year-olds were most likely to have used methamphetamine recently.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The study also found, for people aged 14 years or older, the highest level of recent methamphetamine use was found among those who stated they were [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]/[[Bisexuality|bisexual]] (7.1%).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Methamphetamine use was also high among unemployed people (4.8%), those who had never been married (3.8%) and single people without children (3.4%).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

'''The Millennium Foundation for Innovative Finance for Health''' is an independent, non-profit Swiss organization, established in November 2008 in order to create new ways to finance health systems in low- and middle-income countries. Based in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, the Millennium Foundation aims to ensure that international commitments on improving health care are met through the development of [[innovative financing]] projects. Its first such project – called [[#MassiveGood|MassiveGood]] – was launched on 4 March, and will give travelers the possibility to add a $2, £2 or €2 micro-contribution to the purchase of a travel reservation, with all proceeds going to the fight against [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Strom |first=Stephanie |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/world/23surcharge.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=unitaid&amp;st=cse |title=Fee on Airline Tickets Will Help Fight Life-Threatening Diseases |work=The New York Times  |date=22 September 2009 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and Activities==
In 2000 the United Nations agreed to achieve eight international development goals by the year 2015, called the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals |title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of these goals are health related – to treat and fight life-threatening diseases, including [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]]; to reduce childhood mortality; and to improve [[maternal health]]. Despite repeated commitments to the three health-related [[MDG]]s and increased funding available for [[Research and development|development]], [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]] still have appalling human and economic consequences in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.unaids.org:80/pub/Report/2009/JC1700_Epi_Update_2009_en.pdf |title=AIDS epidemic update |publisher=UNAIDS |date=November 2009 |accessdate=2013-10-01 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2009/en/index.html |title=WHO &amp;#124; World Malaria Report 2009 |publisher=Who.int |date=15 December 2009 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/6941077/One-third-of-worlds-population-has-tuberculosis-bacterium.html |title=One third of world's population has tuberculosis bacterium |publisher=Telegraph |accessdate=21 October 2011 |location=London |date=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official Development Assistance has been increasing in the past few years but cannot keep up with the damage done by the economic crisis on low- and middle-income countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/35/0,3343,en_2649_34447_42458595_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=Development aid at its highest level ever in 2008 |publisher=Oecd.org |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to bridge this financing gap, the international community has looked into new funding mechanisms. The Taskforce on Innovative International Funding for Health Systems issued in June 2009 a report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/pdf/IHP%20Update%2013/Taskforce/Johansbourg/Final%20Taskforce%20Report.pdf |accessdate=7 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723155656/http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/pdf/IHP%20Update%2013/Taskforce/Johansbourg/Final%20Taskforce%20Report.pdf |title=Final Taskforce Report|archivedate=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledging the potential of innovative sources of funding: Innovative Financing projects that have sprouted up in the past decade include [[Product Red]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joinred.com |title=Tweet @ Whitehouse |publisher=JoinRed |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Finance Facility]] for Immunization,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iff-immunisation.org |title=International Finance Facility for Immunisation |publisher=Iff-immunisation.org |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Global Fund]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalfund.org/en |title=Home - The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria |publisher=Theglobalfund.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[GAVI]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gavialliance.org |title=GAVI Alliance |publisher=GAVI Alliance |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[UNITAID]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitaid.eu |title=Unitaid |publisher=Unitaid.eu |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitaid.eu/en/How-innovative-financing-works.html |accessdate=7 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923215444/http://www.unitaid.eu/en/How-innovative-financing-works.html |title=How innovative financing works|archivedate=23 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNITAID]] is funded by a small tax on airlines tickets levied in 12 countries and budgetary contributions from 17 countries.

==MassiveGood==
MassiveGood, the Millennium Foundation’s first innovative finance project, was unveiled at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 23 September 2009 during a meeting of the Task Force for Innovative Finance for Health, spearheaded by UK Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] and World Bank President [[Robert Zoellick]]. The original idea was conceived by Jean-François Rial, the head of a French travel agency, after officials from George W. Bush's administration rejected the idea of a tax on airline tickets in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Philippe | last1=Douste-Blazy | first2=Daniel | last2=Altman |title=Power in Numbers: UNITAID, Innovative Financing, and the Quest for Massive Good}}&lt;/ref&gt; MassiveGood gave travelers the option to make a $2, €2 or £2 micro-contribution towards major global health causes when they bought an airline ticket, reserved a hotel room, rented a car, or travel product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1924470,00.html |title=New Airline-Ticket Tax to Aid the Developing World |author=Gumbel, Peter |date=18 September 2009 |work=www.time.com |accessdate=6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funds were used to provide drugs to reduce child mortality, improve maternal health and combat [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2009-09-23-un-health-fund-airline-ticket_N.htm|title=Buy an airline ticket, donate to UN health fund |author=Joshua Freed |date=23 September 2009 |work= www.usatoday.com |accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/InsidePage.php?id=1144026640&amp;cid=4 |title=Experts seek new options to fund health services |author=Peter Orengo |work=www.standardmedia.co.ke |date=19 October 2010 |accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These contributions went to the Spanish Red Cross and [[UNITAID]],&lt;ref name="mf_update"/&gt; which has a wide range of partners in developing countries including the [[Clinton Foundation]], [[UNICEF]], the [[World Health Organization]], [[UNAIDS]], the [[Global Fund]], the [[Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Partnership]], [[Stop TB Partnership]] and the [[Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitaid.eu/en/PARTNERS-working-towards-the-common-goal-of-expanding-access-to-health.html |accessdate=7 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530145422/http://www.unitaid.eu/en/PARTNERS-working-towards-the-common-goal-of-expanding-access-to-health.html |title=PARTNERS: working towards the common goal of expanding access to health|archivedate=30 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional funding was aimed towards improving maternal and child health in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/world/23surcharge.html?_r=2&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=unitaid&amp;st=cse |title=Travelers’ Fee Can Help Fight Diseases |author=Stephanie Strom |date= 22 September 2009 |work=www.nytimes.com |accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the project included [[Bill Clinton]], [[will.i.am]], [[Samuel L.

MassiveGood was launched on 4 March 2010 in the USA, and successfully rolled out in Spain in June 2010.&lt;ref name="mf_update"/&gt; It was discontinued by the Board of the Millennium Foundation on 4 November 2011, citing insufficient returns "for such a micro-philanthropy initiative in today’s economic climate".&lt;ref name="mf_update"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millenium-foundation.org/wordpress/?page_id=16 |title=MASSIVEGOOD update, November 2011 |publisher=MassiveGood |date=24 November 2011 |accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.massivegood.org/en_US/news-feed/432-new-direction-for-massivegood | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128114204/http://www.massivegood.org/en_US/news-feed/432-new-direction-for-massivegood | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2011-11-28 | title=New direction for MassiveGood }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The Millennium Foundation is a public-private initiative governed by a Board composed of representatives of participating Governments, such as the United Kingdom, France, [[Norway]], Brazil, [[Chile]], the [[Republic of Korea]] and a representative of the [[African Union]]; representatives of NGOs working on [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis]] or [[HIV/AIDS]] and of communities living with diseases;  and representatives of the [[Gates Foundation]] and of the private sector. The UN [[World Health Organization]] serves on the board as an observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millennium-foundation.org/article/governance/the-millennium-foundation-governance |title=Innovative finance for health |publisher=Millennium Foundation |date=25 November 2008 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Board of the Millennium Foundation is chaired by Dr. [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]], who currently serves as Special Adviser on Innovative Financing for Development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Douste |first=Philippe |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/65898/philippe-douste-blazy-and-daniel-altman/a-few-dollars-at-a-time |title=A Few Dollars at a Time |publisher=Foreign Affairs |date=1 January 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the United Nations Secretary-General [[Ban Ki Moon]], and also acts as Chairman of the Board of [[UNITAID]]. Mr. Henk Mulder is the Managing Director and leads the strategic vision for the Foundation.

The survey is conducted by researchers at the [[University of Michigan]]'s [[University of Michigan Institute for Social Research|Institute for Social Research]], funded by [[research grant]]s from the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]], one of the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref name=MTF2010&gt;Johnston, L.

Ann Arbor: Institute for Social Research, The University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Survey design ==
The survey began in 1975 and only focused on that year's senior class. [[Questionnaires]] are sent out yearly by mail. Beginning in 1976, a proportion of survey participants were also chosen for [[wikt:biennial|biennial]] reevaluations. In 1991, the survey was expanded to include 8th and 10th grade students.&lt;ref name=P&amp;D /&gt; The questionnaire is [[Anonymity|anonymous]] for 8th- and 10th-grade students while the questionnaire for 12th-grade students is confidential—name and address information is collected for [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] follow-up surveys.&lt;ref name=MTF2010 /&gt;

Nationally representative samples of 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-grade students (The 2010 MTF survey encompassed about 46,500 students from almost 400 schools nationwide&lt;ref name=MTF2010 /&gt;) receive a questionnaire investigating [[substance abuse|substance use]] patterns, attitudes and beliefs about drugs, perceived availability of drugs, and norms among peer and role model groups. Currently, approximately 50,000 8th, 10th and 12th-grade students complete the survey annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monitoringthefuture.org/|title=Welcome to the MTF Website|date=2015-12-16|website=Monitoringthefuture.org|accessdate=2016-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The survey also evaluates a variety of topics beyond drug use. Questionnaire questions also explore subjects' occupational and educational plans and experiences, attitudes about [[gender role]]s, attitudes and experiences with people of a different race/ethnicity, trust in government and other institutions, concerns about [[the environment]], [[media consumption]], victimization and delinquency, among other things. Follow-up studies into adulthood also cover [[marriage]] and family formation, college attendance, military service, civilian employment, [[unemployment]], and other topics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The '''Orlík Dam''' ({{lang-cs|Vodní nádrž Orlík}}) is the largest hydroelectric [[dam]] in the [[Czech Republic]]. It dams the [[Vltava River]] near the village of [[Solenice]], which is near the town of [[Příbram]]. The structure is named after [[Orlík Castle]], which is situated a few kilometers above the dam. The dam has four turbines with a nominal capacity of 91&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]] each&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebrdrenewables.com/sites/renew/Lists/Projects/DispForm.aspx?ID=535&amp;Source=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eebrdrenewables%2Ecom%2Fsites%2Frenew%2Fcountries%2FCzech%2520Republic%2Fdefault%2Easpx Orlik Hydro Power Plant]&lt;/ref&gt; having a total capacity of 364&amp;nbsp;MW.

== Summary of types of disease associated with types of dipteran flies. ==
Disease caused by the feeding activity of dipteran flies is described here under '''Parasitic disease'''. Disease caused by small [[pathogenic]] organisms that pass from the flies to domestic animals is described here under '''Transmitted organisms'''; these organisms are often of numerous species thus only prominent examples are provided. Feeding by adult flies may cause irritation through to acute stress from painful bites, resulting in loss of grazing time and reduced gain in weight.&lt;ref&gt;Byford, R.L.

== Nematocera (sub-Order). ==
=== General characteristics. ===

Antennae are usually long, with many similar and symmetric segments. These are small to very small flies, usually of delicate morphology with relatively long legs and wings. Body and wings are often covered in fine scales. Thorax is distinctly humped, abdomen is elongated. All species of veterinary and medical importance are blood feeders, with various types of mouthparts (these variations do not relate clearly to dipteran taxonomy).&lt;ref&gt;Smart, J. (1948) ''A Handbook for the Identification of Insects of Medical Importance''. London, British Museum (Natural History).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aedes_aegypti_biting_human.jpg|thumb|''Aedes aegypti'' female mosquito engorging with blood.]]

Life-cycle is a complete [[metamorphosis]] with larvae that are non-parasitic, living in environments such as pools of water, soil, streams. A complete metamorphosis is illustrated by the photograph of ''Stomoxys'' eggs, larvae and adult (''Stomoxys'' are in sub-order [[Brachycera]]). Only females feed on blood, taking a large meal to support production of several hundred eggs, followed by several more cycles of blood meal followed by egg laying.&lt;ref&gt;Lehane, M.J. (1991) ''The Biology of Blood-sucking Insects''. London, Harper Collins, {{ISBN|0-04-445409-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edman, J.D.

Journal of Medical Entomology, 8: 687-695. doi: 10.1093/jmedent/8.6.687.&lt;/ref&gt; Males feed on plant nectar and similar sources of sugars.

[[File:Stomoxys-stable-fly-life-cycle-2.jpg|thumb|Life cycle of ''Stomoxys'' showing a typical complete metamorphosis from eggs at top left, to three larval stages, followed by transformation as the pupal stage into an adult female or male.]]

=== Disease relations. ===

Nematocerans are very important as transmitters of viruses, protozoa, and [[nematode]] worms. Also they are often important for biting stress when in large numbers, and may cause allergic reactions at their feeding sites. A typical pathway of transmission of organisms by blood feeding flies is shown below as a virus transmitted by an adult fly that feeds repeatedly on several hosts (see diagram for Biological transmission, and photograph of ''[[Culicoides]]''). Insects that transmit pathogenic organisms are commonly known as vectors. The diagram shows what is known as biological transmission (= developmental transmission) because it is necessary for the transmitted organism to develop in the fly to the state where the organism is at an infective stage of its life cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, P.S. (1995) The transmission and geographical spread of African horse sickness and bluetongue viruses ''Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology''  '''89''': 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The repeated cycles of egg laying and feeding of the female fly (= gonotrophic cycle) provides the opportunity for the transmitted organisms to develop, multiply and be exposed to further vertebrate hosts where they can complete their life cycle. Only the adult flies are involved in this biological transmission, in contrast to biological transmission by other arthropods such as lice or ticks in which all active stages of the life-cycle feed on blood.

=== Mosquitoes (Family Culicidae). ===
Typical genera are ''[[Culex]]'', ''[[Aedes]]'', and ''[[Anopheles]]''.

==== Morphology, life-cycle, hosts and feeding. ====
The basic structure of dipteran flies is illustrated in the diagram. Veterinary parasitology also covers arthropods in the Class [[Acari]], the [[ticks of domestic animals]] and [[mites of livestock]] which have distinctly different structure from arthropods in the Class [[Insecta]]. However, flies in the Order Diptera show clear division of the body into head, thorax and abdomen with distinct segmentation of the thorax and abdomen. The thorax contains large blocks of muscle that power the single pair of wings. Digestive and reproductive organs fill the abdomen. Also unique to the Diptera is a pair of [[halteres]] (derived from wings during evolution) that aid agile flight by these flies.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, K.R. (1990) ''Mosquitoes''. Slough, Richmond Publishing Co. Ltd. {{ISBN|0-85546-276-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lane, R.P. &amp; Crosskey, R.W. (1993) ''Medical Insects and Arachnids''. Chapman &amp; Hall, London. {{ISBN|0-412-40000-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosquitoes have veined and scaled wings, long legs, long hypodermic mouthparts sheathed in a protective labium (see photograph of ''Aedes'' female engorged with blood). Adult females lay eggs in batches on surface of stagnant water. Larvae feed on microorganisms and organic detritus in water. Pupation occurs at the surface of the water. Feeding by females is on a wide variety of mammals and birds, whilst males feed on plant sugars.

Biting stress can be severe in varied climatic regions (cold northern or tropics) or conditions of much surface water available for breeding where populations of mosquitoes can become dense.&lt;ref name="lancaster"&gt;Lancaster, J.L. &amp; Meisch, M.V. (1986) ''Arthropods in Livestock and Poultry Production''. Chichester: Ellis Horwood Ltd. {{ISBN|0-85312-790-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Species of ''Aedes'', ''Anopheles'' and ''Psorophora'' genera transmit equine encephalitis viruses to horses. ''Culex'', ''Aedes'' and ''Anopheles'' species of mosquito transmit ''[[Plasmodium]]'' protozoa that cause types of malaria in birds. ''Culex'' mosquitoes transmit West Nile virus between birds and horses; they transmit [[Rift Valley fever]] virus to livestock species and humans.&lt;ref name="russell"/&gt; The nematode worm ''Dirofilaria immitis'' that causes [[heartworm]] disease in dogs is transmitted by species of ''Culex'' and ''Aedes''.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, F. (2009). What is new about animal and human dirofilariosis?

(Mosquitoes are of major importance as transmitters of many types of pathogenic microorganisms to humans causing diseases such as [[Malaria]] and [[Yellow fever]]. ''Plasmodium'' species causing malaria in humans are exclusively transmitted by ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquitoes.)

[[File:Phlebotomus_pappatasi_bloodmeal_finished.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|''Phlebotomus pappatasi'' sandfly engorged with blood.]]

=== Biting midges (Family Ceratopogonidae) ===
Typical genera are ''[[Culicoides]]'' and ''[[Leptoconops]]'' (the term "midge" is also used for dipteran flies that are harmless to domestic animals such as those also known as lake-flies ([[Chironomidae]]).

==== Morphology, life-cycle, hosts and feeding. ====
These are small to minute flies (a typical vernacular name is "no-see-ums"). Wings are veined, short and rounded, usually with distinctive patterns of dark brown on clear background. Mouthparts are relatively short and complex with three pairs of cutting / slashing elements that create a superficial wound from which blood is imbibed. Life-cycle is similar to that of mosquitoes: female feeds on blood, matures and lays batch of eggs repeatedly. Males are not blood feeders. The site for larval development is within wet soil and bogs. Hosts of biting midges are wide variety of mammals and birds.

==== Parasitic diseases and transmitted organisms. ====
Severe biting stress to cattle, sheep and horses is caused. Horses suffer from a cutaneous [[hypersensitivity]] reaction called sweet-itch, or Queensland-itch that is caused by antigenic components of saliva of biting midges.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffartzik, A. (2012). Equine insect bite hypersensitivity: What do we know? ''Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology'' '''147''': 113-126. {{doi|10.1016/j.vetimm.2012.03.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, G.S., et al. (1991) ''Culicoides obsoletus'' as a causal agent of ''Culicoides'' hypersensitivity (sweet itch) in British Columbia. Journal of Medical Entomology, 28: 685-693. doi.10.1093/jmedent/28.5.685.&lt;/ref&gt; Poultry may be severely afflicted with biting stress. Species such as ''Culicoides imicola'' and ''[[Culicoides variipennis]]'' transmit [[bluetongue virus]] between sheep and cattle (see diagram and photograph above), and they transmit [[African horse sickness virus]] between horses and other equids. ''Culicoides'' midges transmit ''[[Leucocytozoon]]'' protozoa to poultry birds.&lt;ref&gt;Du Toit, R.M. (1944) The transmission of Blue-tongue and Horse-sickness by ''Culicoides''. Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Science and Agricultural Industry. 19: 7-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sandflies (Family Psychodidae). ===
The important genera are ''[[Phlebotomus]]'' (distributed in Africa and Eurasia) and ''[[Lutzomyia]]'' (distributed in the Americas).&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, P. &amp; De Meillon, B. (1953) ''Simuliidae of the Ethiopian Region''. London, British Museum (Natural History).&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the term "sandfly" is often used to refer to various other types of fly.

==== Morphology, life-cycle, hosts and feeding. ====
[[Sandflies]] are like small versions of mosquitoes but also with overall furry appearance from many long setae (like hairs) on body and wings (see photograph of ''Phlebotomus pappatasi''). Mouthparts are medium length. Life-cycle is similar to midges: site for egg laying and larval development is surface of relatively dry soil. Many species of mammals and birds are used as hosts. Females suck blood using medium length complex mouthparts, whilst males feed on plant sugars.

==== Transmitted organisms. ====
Species of ''Phlebotomus'' and ''Lutzomyia'' sandflies are notorious as transmitters of species of ''[[Leishmania]]'' protozoa that cause visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis in domestic animals and also humans.&lt;ref&gt;Svobodova, M., et al. (2009) Cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by ''Leishmania infantum'' transmitted by ''Phlebotomus tobbi''. International Journal for Parasitology, 39: 251-256. doi:10.1016/j.ijpara.2008.06.016.&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs become infected with ''Leishmania infantum'' and ''L.tropica''; the infection can slowly develop into a multi-organ stage with fatal consequences. 
[[File:Simulium.latipes.-.lindsey.jpg|thumb|''Simulium latipes'' blackfly.]]

=== Black-flies (Family Simuliidae). ===
The typical genus is ''[[Simulium]]'', but also ''Cnephia'' and ''Austrosimulium'' are locally important.

==== Morphology, life-cycle, hosts, and feeding. ====
These are medium nematocerans, halfway in size between mosquitoes and midges.&lt;ref name="kettle"/&gt; The body is compact, wings are clear except for veins close to leading edge, and antennae are short with compact segments appearing like rings. Thorax is dorsally humped and dark brown or black (see photograph of ''Simulium''). Life-cycle is similar to mosquitoes: females lay eggs on plants at surface of streams and rivers; larvae settle onto solid substrate in water and feed on suspended organic detritus; pupation occurs at water surface. Hosts are most livestock species, horses and poultry and many wild animals. Humans also may be severely distressed by blackflies. Feeding is through skin with short complex slashing mouthparts.

==== Parasitic diseases and transmitted organisms. ====
Severe biting stress when they seasonally swarm near running water. Severe [[anaphylaxis]] may develop rapidly in previously sensitized hosts, potentially leading to death of cattle. ''Simulium'' black-flies transmit to ''Leucocytozoon'' protozoa poultry birds. They also transmit ''[[Onchocerca]]'' nematode worms to cattle causing bovine onchocerciasis.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, P., et al. (1993) Parasitological and clinical characterization of ''Simulium neavei'' transmitted onchocerciasis in western Uganda. Tropical Medicine and Parasitology. 44: 311-321.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brachycera (sub-Order). ==
'''NOTE''' that the former sub-Order [[Cyclorrhapha]] is now usually classified as part of the [[Brachycera]].

=== General characteristics. ===
[[File:Tabanus-horsefly-mouthparts-2.jpg|thumb|Mouthparts of ''Tabanus'' horse-fly: sensory palp at left, sponging labella at center, skin-piercing elements at right.]]
[[File:Haematopota-pluvialis-06-VII-2007-03.jpg|thumb|''Haematopota pluvialis'' tabanid fly showing distinct patterns on eyes and wings.]]
Antennae consist of three relatively short segments with asymmetric shapes. Brachyceran flies are of medium to large size and compact shape. They have large compound eyes, well developed wings, and generally fly during daytime seeking food and mates. Life-cycle is a complete metamorphosis, as for Nematocera.&lt;ref name="kettle"/&gt; However, in contrast to nematoceran flies which have larvae always non-parasitic and living in the general habitat, some species of brachyceran flies are parasitic in their larval stage  whilst the adults that develop from these larvae are non-parasitic. This parasitism by brachyceran larvae causes the disease [[myiasis]].

Some of the brachyceran flies are important transmitters of pathogenic organisms through a route known as mechanical (or contaminative) transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Scoles,G.A., (2008) Comparison of the efficiency of biological transmission of Anaplasma marginale (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae) by Dermacentor andersoni Stiles (Acari: Ixodidae) with mechanical transmission by the horse fly, Tabanus fuscicostatus Hine (Diptera: Muscidae). ''Journal of Medical Entomology'' '''45''':109-114. 
{{doi|10.1603/0022-2585(2008)45[109:COTEOB]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desquesnes, M &amp; Dia, M.L. (2004) Mechanical transmission of Trypanosoma vivax in cattle by the African tabanid Atylotus fuscipes. Veterinary Parasitology, 119: 9-19. [http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/45813412/j.vetpar.2003.10.01520160520-10317-4bjuul.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1491563758&amp;Signature=KYGJpgeCsTOwSraoXiOe0zufv9w%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DMechanical_transmission_of_Trypanosoma_v.pdf]{{dead link|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These flies have complex cutting mouthparts that make a superficial wound in skin. Blood flowing into the wound is sponged up by the labella organ of the mouthparts (see photograph of ''Tabanus'' mouthparts). The flies tend to take small meals from many hosts at short intervals, to avoid the defensive actions of their hosts. Fresh blood on the labella may contaminate other hosts with pathogenic organisms. Many species of brachyceran flies such as the house-flies and blow-flies that do not feed on blood are also mechanical transmitters of pathogenic organisms by a contaminative route on their mouthparts used for sponging up wet nutritious secretions on skin of vertebrate animals. Usually the mechanical transmission of microbes by flies does not involve any developmental stage of the microorganism in the fly. However, some brachyceran flies, such as a group of species of ''[[Glossina]]'' genus are important biological transmitters, not mechanical.

=== Horse-flies (Family Tabanidae). ===
Typical genera are ''[[Tabanus]]'', ''[[Haematopota]]'', ''[[Chrysops]]'' and ''Hybromitra'', also many other genera of importance to domestic animals in some regions of world, tropical and subtropical South America especially.&lt;ref&gt;Oldroyd, H. (1952) ''The Horse-flies of the Ethiopian Region, Vol 1. Haematopota and Hippocentrum''. London, British Museum (Natural History).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oldroyd, H. (1954) ''The Horse-flies of the Ethiopian Region, Vol 2. Tabanus and related genera''. London, British Museum (Natural History).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Morphology, life-cycle, hosts and feeding. ====
These are large robust flies with massive eyes that often show colored patterns. Antennae are characteristic with three dissimilar segments projecting forward from head. Wings are large and strong with complex venation, and often with complex patterns of brown on clear background.&lt;ref&gt;Austen, E.E. (1909) ''Illustrations of African Blood-sucking Flies other than Mosquitoes and Tsetse-flies''. London, British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, F.W., et al. (1939)  ''British Blood-sucking Flies''. London, British Museum (Natural History).&lt;/ref&gt; These flies are adapted to hunt widely for their hosts during daytime. Females take repeated small blood meals from their hosts to support development of a large batch of eggs. Eggs are laid on wet soil where larvae develop, sometimes over one or two years by feeding on soil organisms. Males do not feed on blood. Hosts of females include all species of mammalian livestock animals and horses. Tabanid flies have large mouthparts comprising three pairs of cutting / slashing elements that pierce skin in a superficial wound. Blood flowing from this is imbibed through a sponge-like element of the mouthparts, the labella (similar to that shown in photograph of ''Calliphora'').&lt;ref&gt;Dickerson, G. &amp; Lavoipierre, M.M.J. (1959) Studies on the methods of feeding of blood-sucking arthropods: III.—The method by which ''Haematopota pluvialis'' obtains its blood-meal from the mammalian host. Annals of Tropical Medicine &amp; Parasitology. 53: 465-472.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Parasitic diseases and transmitted organisms. ====
Bites of tabanid flies are painful. Dense populations of these flies cause severe biting stress to livestock and horses leading to reduction of gain in liveweight. These hosts may additionally suffer loss of grazing time by clustering in tight defensive packs, a situation known as fly-syndrome. Many genera of tabanid flies transmit the protozoan ''[[Trypanosoma evansi]]'' that causes in camels and horses the disease called [[surra]].&lt;ref&gt;Reid, S.A. (2002) ''Trypanosoma evansi'' control and containment in Australasia. Trends in Parasitology, 18: 219-224.&lt;/ref&gt; These flies also transmit the protozoan ''T.vivax'' that causes in cattle the disease called [[nagana]]. Tabanid flies are also transmitters the bacteria ''Anaplasma marginale'' and ''A.centrale'' to cattle, sheep and goats, causing [[anaplasmosis]].&lt;ref name="taylor"/&gt;

=== House-flies, Stable-flies and similar (Family Muscidae). ===
Typical genera are ''[[Musca]]'', ''[[Hydrotaea]]'', ''[[Stomoxys]]'' and ''[[Haematobia]]''.
[[File:Calliphora-sponging-mouth-parts.jpg|thumb|Mouthparts of ''Calliphora'' blowfly showing sponge structure of labella at lower right.]]

==== Morphology, life-cycle, hosts and feeding. ====
These are medium to large flies of compact structure, with clear wings of complex venation. Antennae are highly characteristic with antennae consisting of several compact segments that lie in a deep groove between the eyes; the outermost segment of each antenna bears a feather like structure, the arista, which projects forwards. Species within ''Musca'', ''Hydrotaea'', and similar genera have mouthparts adapted for sponging nutritious liquids with their labellar lobes (see photograph of ''Calliphora'' mouthparts which also have this sponge structure).&lt;ref name="kettle"/&gt; Some species of this type, such as ''Musca vestustissima'' (Australian bush-fly) also have, as part of this sponge structure, small teeth that can scrape at host's skin down to superficial capillaries to feed on blood.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, R. D., et al. (1972) A synopsis of observations on the biology of the Australian bushfly (''Musca vetustissima'' Walker). Australian Journal of Entomology. 11: 311-331.&lt;/ref&gt; Cattle are a typical host for ''Musca'' and similar species of house-flies that are attracted to protein containing liquids at the eyes and nostrils of their hosts.

Species within the genera ''Stomoxys'' stable-flies, and ''Haematobia'' horn-flies are highly adapted for blood feeding, having mouthparts consisting of a strong projecting labium with cutting elements at its point.&lt;ref&gt;Zumpt, F. (1973) ''The Stomoxyine Biting Flies of the World''. Stuttgart, Gustav Fischer Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; This is used to pierce deeply into skin of host to access blood (see photograph of ''Stomoxys'' in the Gallery below. Females of these flies typically take repeated small meals from their hosts to support production of their batches of eggs. Both females and males feed only on blood. Cattle and domestic buffalo are also the main hosts of ''Stomoxys'' and ''Haematobia''  flies.&lt;ref&gt;Guglielmone, A.A., et al. (1999) Skin lesions and cattle hide damage from ''Haematobia irritans'' infestations. Medical and Veterinary Entomology, 13: 324-329.  doi:10.1046/j.1365-2915.1999.00167.x.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Parasitic diseases and transmitted organisms. ====
Irritation is caused by large numbers of ''Musca'' house-flies, through to severe biting stress from dense populations of ''Stomoxys'' or ''Haematobia'' flies. ''Musca'' house-flies, face-flies, and similar types transmit a variety of bacteria involved in [[mastitis]] of cattle.&lt;ref&gt;Hillerton, J. E., et al. (1983) ''Hydrotaea irritans'' and summer mastitis in calves. Veterinary Record 113: 88-88.  doi:10.1136/vr.113.4.88.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[conjunctivitis]] of cattle known as pink-eye is caused by ''[[Moraxella bovis]]'' bacteria transmitted by ''[[Musca autumnalis]]'' face-flies.&lt;ref&gt;Glass, H.W. &amp;  Gerhardt R.R. (1984) Transmission of ''Moraxella bovis'' by regurgitation from the crop of the face fly (Diptera: Muscidae). Journal of Economic Entomology ,77: 399-401.&lt;/ref&gt; The feeding of various ''Musca'' species of fly permits the contaminative transmission of nematode worms, for example ''[[Parafilaria bovicola]]'', causing a nodular [[filariasis]] in cattle. ''Stomoxys'' species transmit several species of ''[[Trypanosoma]]'' protozoa to cattle, sheep and goats causing various types of trypanosomiasis.  ''Haematobia'' horn-flies transmit nematode worms in the genus ''Stephanofilaria'' to the skin of cattle, causing stephanofilariasis, a suppurating dermatitis known as hump sore. ''Stomoxys'' flies transmit the bacterium ''Eperythrozoon ovis'' to sheep and this infection may lead to fever and anemia.

=== Tsetse-flies (Family Glossinidae). ===
[[File:Tsetse-BKF-2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Glossina'' adult tsetse fly; piercing mouthparts conspicuous.]]
There is one genus in this Family: ''[[Glossina]]'', known as tsetse-flies or simply tsetse.&lt;ref name="leak"&gt;Leak, S.G.A. (1999) ''Tsetse Biology and Ecology: their Role in the Epidemiology and Control of Trypanosomiasis''. Wallingford, CABI Publishing, {{ISBN|0-85199-300-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Flies of this family are similar to ''Stomoxys'' flies within the Muscidae, but have a life cycle and veterinary and medical importance justifying a separate Family designation. Tsetse-flies are found only in sub-Saharan Africa.

==== Morphology, life-cycle, hosts and feeding. ====
These flies are closely similar to ''Stomoxys'' and ''Haematobia'', but are larger and of a paler brown color. Tsetse-flies of both sexes are robust fliers adapted for hunting their hosts during daytime. Male adults support their mating activity with repeated meals of blood from cattle and similar wild bovid hosts, also wild pigs and warthogs are favored. Life-cycle of tsetse-fly is highly specialized. Females take repeated small meals of blood to support the development within their abdomen of a single larvae over one period. This will be repeated for as many times as the female is able to survive, depending mostly on availability of hosts. The single larva emerges fully grown from the female, weighing more than the female. Then the larva immediately burrows into dry sandy soil to pupate within a protective puparium. A new adult emerges from the puparium after a complete metamorphosis. This is known as [[larviparous]] reproduction, with the advantage of high survival rate of offspring, but few offspring are produced by each female.&lt;ref&gt;Coetzer, J.A.W. (1994) ''Infectious Diseases of Livestock with Special Reference to Southern Africa'', Vol 1. Cape Town: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-570506-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Parasitic diseases and transmitted organisms. ====
Bites from tsetse flies are painful but these flies are not generally associated with direct causes of lost production in cattle. ''Glossina morsitans'' and ''G.pallidipes'' tsetse-flies are transmitters of various species of ''Trypanosoma'' protozoa causing [[animal trypanosomiasis]] (= nagana) in cattle, and other forms of [[trypanosomiasis]] in sheep, goats, pigs, camels and horses.&lt;ref&gt;Maudlin, I. (2004) ''The Trypanosomiases''. Wallingford, CABI Publishing, {{ISBN|0-85199-475-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harley, J.M.B. &amp; Wilson. A.J. (1968) Comparison between ''Glossina morsitans, G. pallidipes'' and ''G. fuscipes'' as vectors of trypanosomes of the ''Trypanosoma congolense'' group: the proportions infected experimentally and the numbers of infective organisms extruded during feeding. Annals of Tropical Medicine &amp; Parasitology 62: 178-187.  doi:10.1080/00034983.1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Tsetse-flies are also notorious as transmitters of the ''Trypanosoma'' species causing [[African trypanosomiasis]] (= sleeping sickness) in humans.

=== Blow-flies (Family Calliphoridae). ===
Important genera include ''[[Calliphora]]'', ''[[Lucilia (fly)|Lucilia]]'', ''[[Chrysomya]]'', ''[[Cochliomyia]]'' and ''Wohlfahrtia''.
[[File:Chrysomya_adult_larva.jpg|thumb|''Chrysomia bezziana'', Old World screw-worm, adult fly and third stage larva of type causing myiasis (see header photograph of ''C.megacephala'' for colors of live fly).]]

==== Morphology, life-cycle, hosts and feeding. ====
All calliphorid flies are all large, robust, strong day-time fliers. Their antennae are as described above for house-flies and others in the Family Muscidae. Adult flies in family Calliphoridae feed as adults of both sexes mostly on proteinaceous liquids found on surface of decaying animal carcasses and similar material. These liquids are taken in using sponging mouthparts (see photograph of ''Calliphora'').  In genera such as ''Calliphora'' and ''Lucilia'' the females lay their eggs on the same dead animal material and the larvae feed their by rasping at the muscle and other tissues with their mouthparts. However, species of ''Lucilia'' and some other genera may opportunistically invade the tissues of live hosts, such as sheep or cattle and feed there parasitically. Other genera such as ''Chrysomya'', ''Cochliomyia'' and ''Wohlfahrtia'' are specifically adapted for this type of feeding by the larvae.&lt;ref&gt;Erzinçlioğlu, Z. (1996) ''Blowflies''. Slough, England, The Richmond Publishing Company. {{ISBN|0-85546-303-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Parasitic diseases and transmitted organisms. ====
When larvae of ''Lucilia'' feed parasitically they cause the disease facultative myiasis (facultative = opportunistic or optional). When this occurs on sheep it is often known as blow-fly strike. This causes severe distress to the host and may be fatal due to toxemia from ammonia excreted by masses of infesting larvae.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, A.C.G., &amp; Bishop, D.M. (1995) Flystrike in New Zealand. Surveillance (Wellington), 22:, 11-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, D. F. (1947) The relative importance of live sheep and of carrion as breeding grounds for the Australian sheep blowfly ''Lucilia cuprina''. Bulletin of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Australia, No.217 pgs 1-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Females of ''Chrysomya'', ''Cochliomyia'' and ''Wohlfahrtia'' and similar genera always seek out their host such as cattle, sheep, dogs, to lay their eggs at vulnerable sites such as a small wound. The larvae hatch and rapidly invade the superficial layers of skin to continue feeding there until ready to pupate. This form of parasitism is essential for these types of fly, and causes obligate myiasis (obligate = necessary or essential). This infestation develops into severe disease and can be fatal if the infestation is at a vulnerable site such as ear or navel of the host.&lt;ref&gt;Farkas, R., et al. (2009) Traumatic myiasis in dogs caused by ''Wohlfahrtia magnifica'' and its importance in the epidemiology of wohlfahrtiosis of livestock. Medical and Veterinary Entomology, 23: 80-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Adult blow-flies such as those in the ''Calliphora'' genus can be significant as transmitters of various bacteria involved in mastitis of cattle. The conjunctivitis of cattle known as pink-eye is caused by ''[[Moraxella bovis]]'' bacteria and may be transmitted by blow-flies.&lt;ref name="taylor"/&gt;
{{Main | Myiasis}}

=== Bot-flies and warble-flies (Family Oestridae). ===
[[File:Dermatobia_larvae.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Larvae of ''Dermatobia hominis'', Torsalo bot-fly; third stage larva top, first stage larva bottom.]]
[[File:Dermatobia-hominis-infestation-cattle-2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Furuncular myiasis at shoulder and neck of cow caused by infestation of ''Dermatobia hominis'' larvae.]]
Typical genera are ''[[Hypoderma (fly)|Hypoderma]]'', ''[[Gasterophilus]]'', ''[[Dermatobia]]'' and ''[[Oestrus (fly)]]''. Oestrid flies at their larval stage tend to be adapted to feed on a few closely related species of host animal and the adult females fly actively to seek out only these hosts on which to lay their eggs.
[[File:Warble_Fly._Oestridae._Hypoderma_iparece_-_Flickr_-_gailhampshire.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Adult warble fly, ''Hypoderma iparece'', showing furry appearance and lack of mouthparts.]]

==== Morphology, life-cycle, hosts and feeding. ====
Adults are large flies, and unusual amongst brachyceran flies because they have a dense covering of fine setae (like hairs) and colored patterns that make them appear like bumble-bees (Hymenoptera). All species of the Oestridae are so highly adapted to the myiasis type of parasitism that the adults do not feed and have only residual mouthparts (see photograph of ''Hypoderma iparece'').&lt;ref&gt;Otranto, D. (2001) The immunology of myiasis: parasite survival and host defense strategies. Trends in Parasitology, 17: 176-182.&lt;/ref&gt; All these flies have an obligate myiasis life-cycle, with a complete metamorphosis.&lt;ref name="wall" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scholl, P.J. (1993). Biology and control of cattle grubs. ''Annual Review of Entomology''  '''38''': 53-70. {{doi|10.1146/annurev.en.38.010193.000413}}
[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2057&amp;context=usdaarsfacpub]
&lt;/ref&gt; The females lay eggs with high selectivity on their special hosts and at specific sites there. For example, eggs laid on the legs of horses in the case of species of ''Gasterophilus''.&lt;ref&gt;Waddell, A.H. (1972) The pathogenicity of Gasterophilus intestinalis larvae in the stomach of the horse. Australian Veterinary Journal, 48: 332-335.&lt;/ref&gt; The horse licks at the irritated skin and the larvae transfer to the mouth of horse. The larvae penetrate tissues in the oral cavity, feed parasitically whilst migrating through tissue of the esophagus to finally reach the stomach. The final larval stage is completed with the larvae attached to the mucosa of the horse's stomach. When ready to pupate the larvae detach and are voided in the horse's feces. Another example is ''[[Dermatobia hominis]]'', torsalo-fly, which is an important parasite of cattle, and sometimes humans, in tropical regions of South America.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, R.P. et al. (1987) Human cutaneous myiasis - a review and report of three cases due to ''Dermatobia hominis''. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology, 12: 40-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jelinek, T., et al. (1995) Cutaneous myiasis: review of 13 cases in travelers returning from tropical countries. International Journal of Dermatology, 34: 624-626.&lt;/ref&gt; The larvae cause a localized, furuncular (= like a boil) myiasis in the skin of their hosts. The larvae infest these sites when transported there accidentally by blood feeding mosquitoes; the adult female ''Dermatobia'' flies lay their eggs on the legs of mosquitoes, a dispersal mechanism called phoresy.

==== Parasitic diseases and transmitted organisms. ====
Obligate myiasis of various forms are typical of the oestrid genera. Larval ''Dermatobia'' torsalo-flies infest the skin and underlying tissues of cattle causing distress, reduced gain in weight and damage to skins used for leather. Larval ''Gasterophilus'' stomach-bots infest the upper gastric tract and stomach of horses and other equids.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, G.T. (1982) The prevalence of ''Gasterophilus intestinalis'' in horses in northern England and Wales. Veterinary Parasitology, 11: 215-222.&lt;/ref&gt; Larval ''Hypoderma'' warble-flies infest the skin and muscles of cattle. Larval ''Oestrus'' nasal-bots infest the nasal cavities of sheep and goats.&lt;ref&gt;Yilma, J.M.; &amp; Dorchies, P. (1991) Epidemiology of ''Oestrus ovis'' in southwest France. Veterinary Parasitology, 40: 315-323.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of stomach-bots it is often uncertain how much clinical disease or loss of production small levels of infestation causes the host. With infestations of warble-flies and nasal-bots severe distress to the hosts may be caused and there are production losses from reduction of value of cattle hides, and reduced grazing time by sheep. Harm to cattle may be caused through panic (known as gadding) at the approach of the flies if that leads to traumatic injury. There are no organisms of known importance transmitted by oestrid flies.

=== Louse-flies (Family Hippoboscidae). ===
[[File:Melophagus-male-female-puparium.jpg|thumb|''Melophagus ovinus'' sheep-ked: male at left, female center, puparium right.]]
Genera of importance are ''[[Melophagus]]'' and ''[[Hippobosca]]''. This is a Family of specialized blood feeding flies with a reproductive cycle similar that described for tsetse-flies. They are often known as louse-flies because some species either shed their wings when as adults they find a host after active flying (in genus ''[[Lipoptena]]''). Alternatively flies of genus ''Melophagus'' are so adapted to parasitism that the adults never develop wings. Louse-flies without wings may appear like ticks, but the only stage of tick seen with three pairs of legs will be larvae these are much smaller than louse-flies. 

==== Morphology, life-cycle, hosts and feeding. ====
Adults of the genus ''Hippobosca'' are large, robust flies that retain their wings to fly for repeated blood meals, between hosts such as cattle, camels or horses in a herd. Stout piercing mouthparts project downward from the head (see ''Hippobosca'' in Gallery). The abdomen bulges largely, especially when containing a developing larva. The life-cycle is the [[larviparous]] type, similar to that of tsetse-flies, few offspring are produced per female but their survival rate is high.&lt;ref&gt;Hafez, M., &amp; Hilali, M. (1978) Biology of ''Hippobosca longipennis'' (Fabricus, 1805) in Egypt (Dipteria: Hippoboscidae). Veterinary Parasitology, 4: 275-288.&lt;/ref&gt; In species that never develop wings as adults, such as ''Melophagus ovinus'', the sheep-ked, the fully developed larvae are deposited by the female on the hair coat of the host. There pupation occurs rapidly followed by complete metamorphosis into an adult (see photograph of ''Melophagus'').&lt;ref&gt;Small, R. W. (2005) A review of ''Melophagus ovinus'' (L.), the sheep ked. Veterinary Parasitology, 130: 141-155.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Parasitic diseases and transmitted organisms. ====
Irritation and biting-stress is caused. Damage to skin results in poor quality of leather when hides are processed, a condition known as cockle. Sheep-keds transmit the bacterium ''Eperythrozoon ovis'' to sheep and this infection may cause fever and anemia. They also transmit ''Trypanosoma melophagium'', but this protozoan seems non-pathogenic.

== Prevention of infestation and infection. ==
=== Physical barriers and hygiene. ===
These usually consist of netting made of synthetic fibers or fine metal mesh that is fitted to the ventilation slats / windows of housing for livestock animals. The fiber netting can be impregnated with insecticides such as the synthetic pyrethroid [[deltamethrin]] that acts rapidly when flies such as ''Stomoxys'' or ''Glossina'' species land on it.&lt;ref&gt;N'Guessana, R. &amp; Asidia, A.  (2010) An experimental hut evaluation of PermaNet® 3.0, a deltamethrin–piperonyl butoxide combination net, against pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes in southern Benin. Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 104: 758-765. [http://doi.org/10.1016/j.trstmh.2010.08.008]&lt;/ref&gt; Valuable horses in areas infested with ''Culicoides'' midges or ''Simulium'' black-flies can be protected with commercially available shields made of cloth that fit over head, neck and back. Flies such as the ''Musca'', ''Stomoxys'' and ''Haematobia'' species have larval habitats amongst livestock dung and soiled bedding found around livestock farms. There is scope for reducing fly infestation by clearing these wastes to composting containers or areas. However, for many types of dipteran fly the larvae inhabit areas such as bogs (''Culicoides''), swamps (mosquitoes), or rivers (''Simulium'') that are impractical to treat under typical commercial constraints within agriculture.

=== Chemical repellents and insecticides, and botanical preparations. ===
[[File:TsetseTrap.jpg|thumb|Target to control ''Glossina'' tsetse-flies; colors of cloth attract flies and cloth is treated with insecticide, brown bottle at top right of target contains an odor attractant.]]
Synthetic chemicals such as [[diethyltoluamide]] (often called DEET) dissolved in an oily carrier are sometimes used.&lt;ref name="lancaster"/&gt; Also there are various organic, botanical repellents such as [[citronella oil]] and [[neem oil]]. Typically various types of synthetic pyrethroids such as deltamethrin, [[cypermethrin]], and [[permethrin]] are formulated in an oil or watery suspension suitable for application direct to the skin of animals at risk.&lt;ref&gt;C. F. Curtis, C.F. &amp; Davies, C.R. (2001) Present use of pesticides for vector and allergen control and future requirements. Medical and Veterinary Entomology, 15: 231-235. DOI: 10.1046/j.1365-2915.2001.00293.x&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually done with a pour-on applicator along the back line of the host from where the insecticide spreads downwards through the hair coat.&lt;ref&gt;Wardhaugh, K.G. (2005)  Insecticidal activity of synthetic pyrethroids, organophosphates, insect growth regulators, and other livestock parasiticides: An Australian perspective. Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, 24: 789-796. DOI: 10.1897/03-588.1 s [http://lib.gig.ac.cn/local/ejournal/ETC/ETC2005/2404/ETC-2005-24(4)-789-796.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, to protect against flies such as ''Stomoxys'' and ''Glossina'' species that feed on legs and belly the insecticide can be sprayed selectively to those regions. Also cattle can be treated using self-applicators such as back-rubbers made of large bundles of fiber impregnated with the insecticide, or in automatic walk-through sprayers. The same types of insecticides are also formulated into the plastic sheet of ear-tags for protecting cattle against ''Musca'' and similar flies feeding around the head of cattle.&lt;ref&gt;Drummond, R.O. (1988) ''Control of arthropod pests of livestock: a review of technology''. Boca Raton, CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Insect growth regulators (juvenile hormones, chitin synthesis inhibitors, etc.) are available. For example, the insect growth regulator [[cyromazine]] is effective for the prevention or treatment of infestations with blowfly larvae. Botanical extracts such as [[azadirachtin]] from the neem tree can be formulated as repellents and insecticides, with the potential advantage of more rapid degradation to harmless forms in the environment, lower toxicity and potentially lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;Geden, C.J. (2012) Status of biopesticides for control of house flies. Journal of Biopesticides, 5:  1-11.[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christopher_Geden2/publication/265026238_Status_of_biopesticides_for_control_of_house_flies/links/54c124f20cf2dd3cb9580648.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traps and targets. ===
These can contribute to control of blowflies and tsetse-flies for example.&lt;ref name="leak"/&gt; The blowfly traps contain a liquid that smells like the rotting flesh of a carcass and the structure of the trap is designed to prevent the flies from escaping once attracted in.&lt;ref name="wall"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, J.R. &amp; Wall, R. (1994) Responses of the sheep blowflies Lucilia sericata and L.cuprina to odour and the development of semiochemical baits. Medical and Veterinary Entomology, 8: 303-309. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Wall6/publication/15356709_Responses_of_the_sheep_blowflies_Lucilia_sericata_and_L_cuprina_to_odour_and_the_development_of_semiochemical_baits/links/57261e7f08aee491cb3f08ed.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Horse-flies can be controlled by '''traps''' that attract the flies to a suspended black ball that mimics a potential host; flies attracted become trapped in a cone above. For area wide control of tsetse-flies '''targets''' (these do not trap the flies) that combine a rectangle of dark blue or black cloth and often an attractant chemical act as simple mimics of the fly's host.&lt;ref&gt;Hargrove, J.W. et al. (1995) Catches of tsetse (''Glossina'' spp.) (Diptera: Glossinidae) from traps and targets baited with large doses of natural and synthetic host odour, Bulletin of Entomological Research, 85: 215-227.

=== Sterile insect technique. ===
{{Main | Sterile insect technique}}
This technique was used to eradicate ''Cochliomyia hominivorax'' [[screw-worm fly]] from the USA where the flies were endemic, and from Libya where there had been an accidental importation from South America. Although this species of blowfly under natural conditions has larvae of the obligate myiasis type, it is possible to colonize the entire life-cycle in large factory conditions. Massive numbers pupae are sterilized by irradiation. When released these flies mate with the wild flies and the matings produce no offspring. The reproductive rate of the wild flies can be reduced to the level of eradication. Eradication schemes are being extended in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, G. L., &amp; Neck, R. W.

=== Pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines. ===
Infections with ''Trypanosoma'' species are treated, either prophylactically or to treat acute cases with synthetic chemical drugs such as [[diminazine]].&lt;ref&gt;Tuntasuvana, D. et al.

The '''Pasteur Institute of India''' produces [[DPT vaccine]] and [[rabies vaccine]] for the [[Expanded Program on Immunization]] in India. It is located in [[Coonoor]], [[Nilgiris]], [[Tamil Nadu]]. The institute was initially called the Pasteur Institute of Southern India. In 1907 it changed its name to the Pasteur Institute of India. In 1977 it became an autonomous body under the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]]. The institute is named after the [[French people|French]] scientist, [[Louis Pasteur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pasteur Institute of India, Coonoor, Nilgiris|url=http://pasteurinstituteindia.com/|publisher=Pasteur Institute of India|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Personal Responsibility in a Desirable Environment (PRIDE)''' is a [[non-profit organization]] that links citizens with the resources of local, state, and federal agencies to improve the region's water quality, clean up solid waste problems, and advance environmental education. It was originally launched by [[Hal Rogers|Congressman Hal Rogers]] and General James Bickford in 1997 and is a statewide non-profit organization in [[Kentucky]].&lt;ref name="Progress Report" /&gt;

==Mission==
The PRIDE mission is to improve the native region by encouraging citizens to contribute and take responsibility for protecting the environment and to help provide the education and resources needed to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://kypride.org/about/|work=kypride.org|publisher=Personal Responsibility in a Desirable Environment|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outings==
The annual P.R.I.D.E. Spring Cleanup is held the entire month of April and PRIDE works with communities during the month of April to create a clean and healthy environment in time for the upcoming recreation and tourism season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Noble|first=Jeff|title=Kickin' Off a Cleanup with PRIDE|url=http://thetimestribune.com/local/x1690522476/Kickin-Off-a-Cleanup-with-PRIDE|accessdate=7 April 2013|newspaper=Times- Tribune|date=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and local P.R.I.D.E.

The Kentucky P.R.I.D.E. reported online that nearly 10,600 volunteers have picked up nearly 62,000 bags of trash and eliminated 416 illegal dumps in Pike County, more than 4,000 volunteers have picked up 5,318 bags of trash and eliminated 11 illegal dumps in Letcher County and nearly 8,700 volunteers have picked up nearly 24,000 bags of trash and eliminated 29 dumps in Floyd County&lt;ref name="Meadows" /&gt; and fourteen volunteers cleaned along Rts. 2566, 2565 and 3 in Lawrence County, collecting 44 bags of trash and two tires along 5.4 miles of roadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawrence County volunteers take part in PRIDE Spring Cleanup, April 16|url=http://www.bigsandynews.com/1editorialbody.lasso?-token.folder=2005-05-04&amp;-token.story=124105.112112&amp;-token.subpub=|accessdate=12 May 2013|newspaper=The Big Sandy News|date=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also more than 150 people gathered recently in Corbin to discuss expanding recycling in southern and Eastern Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PRIDE kicks off recycling campaign|url=http://news-expressky.com/news/non_profit/article_1a03d82a-b3e5-11e0-abbe-001cc4c03286.html?_dc=63460034318.268295|accessdate=7 April 2013|newspaper=Appalachian News-Express|date=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only volunteers contribute to this cleanup, families from communities contribute without even realizing it because of their own spring cleanup habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taking PRIDE in their community|url=http://news-expressky.com/everyday_living/article_e8604e47-7609-51d2-b1b4-0cf9b5b9eece.html|accessdate=7 April 2013|newspaper=Appalachian News- Express|date=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Take PRIDE|url=http://news-expressky.com/article_fe0461dc-c3d6-53eb-a0f0-2c8bc8956f9a.html|accessdate=7 April 2013|newspaper=Appalachian News- Express|date=April 28, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pike County Clean Community Board who cooperate with the PRIDE organization helps in educational outreach program. The program, also sponsored by the Pike County Board of Education and funded through Litter Abatement funds, sends a representative to local schools to educate children about becoming litter free.The board will also emphasize recycling efforts in the county. 
Pike County Solid Waste officials reported that the county's recycling program diverted more than 450 tons of garbage from the landfill last year. More than half of the diverted material—254 tons—was cardboard. Approximately 158 tons of newspaper, 23 tons of mixed paper, 14 tons of plastic, three tons of phone books and one ton of white paper were also recycled instead of filling up the landfill.&lt;ref name="Meadows" /&gt;

A '''phlebologist''' is a medical specialist in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of [[venous]] origin. The specialty of [[phlebology]] has developed to enable physicians sharing an interest in venous disease and health to share knowledge and experience despite being trained in a variety of backgrounds such as [[dermatology]], [[vascular surgery]], [[haematology]], interventional radiology or general medicine. Diagnostic techniques used include the patient's history and physical examination, venous imaging techniques in particular vascular ultrasound and laboratory evaluation related to venous [[Thrombosis|thromboembolism]]. The [[American Medical Association]] and the [[American Osteopathic Association]] has added phlebology to their list of self-designated practice specialties.

A significant part of a phlebologist's work is involved with the treatment of superficial venous disease, frequently of the leg. Conditions often treated include venous stasis ulcers, [[varicose veins]] and spider veins ([[telangiectasia]]). Other conditions managed by phlebologists include deep venous thrombosis ([[DVT]]), superficial [[thrombophlebitis]], and venous [[malformations]].

Regulatory requirements for phlebology certification are different in Europe and the USA. In the USA, licensed physicians with documented experience in treating veins  and adequate vascular ultrasound experience can receive certification by passing a test created by the American Board of Venous and Lymphatic Medicine a privately owned corporation committed to maintaining a high standard of care for venous disease. The test addresses knowledge of venous disease, clotting disorders, imaging modalities, pharmacokinetics, vascular malformations, lymphatics disorders and venous embryology. The American Board of Venous and Lymphatic Medicine results in certification as a "Diplomate of the American Board of Venous and Lymphatic Medicine" which is based on standards set by the American Board of Medical Specialities.  Providers with this designation have completed rigorous criteria to sit for the exam and comprehension of vein care principles to pass the exam according to the Board.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1086">'''Recruitment''',  in medicine, is a physical condition of the [[inner ear]] that leads to reduced [[sensory tolerance|tolerance]]{{dubious|reason = does this confound tolerance and sensitivity?|date=May 2018}} of [[Auditory sensation|loudness]]. It commonly occurs in individuals who suffer [[hearing loss]] due to [[cochlea]]r damage. While low-magnitude sounds cannot be heard in the affected ear(s), the perceived loudness increases over-proportionally with sound volume once the [[auditory threshold]] has been overcome. This can result in a (seemingly paradoxical) reduced tolerance to loudness, as loud sounds may be perceived louder than normal.

In those with hearing impairment, the presence of a recruitment phenomenon points towards a cochlear dysfunction, while its absence (also referred to as negative recruitment) indicates a source outside the cochlea (e.g. [[cochlear nerve]] injury, [[tympanic membrane]] rupture).&lt;ref&gt;http://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/Recruitment; retrieved 2018-06-10&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ridged band''' is a band of highly innervated wrinkly [[skin]] toward the end of the [[foreskin]]. The term ''ridged'' is used to describe the area instead of the more commonly used term ''wrinkled''. It has, especially in regard to [[phimosis]] (and [[preputioplasty]]), been called '''preputial ring''' or '''phimotic ring''', ''[[Ring (geometric)|ring]]'' being analogous to ''band'', referring to the shape, and ''preputial'' meaning ''pertaining to the [[Foreskin|prepuce]]''. More particularly, it refers to the transitional area from the external to the internal surface of the prepuce, or foreskin.&lt;ref name = "sorrells"&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Sorrells ML, Snyder JL, Reiss MD, ''et al'' |date= 2007 | title = Fine-touch pressure thresholds in the adult penis | journal = BJU Int | volume = 99 | issue = 4 | pages = 864–869 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06685.x/full | pmid = 17378847 | doi = 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06685.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

John R. Taylor, MB, a Canadian [[Pathology|pathologist]] and [[Biomedical research|medical researcher]], first used the term "ridged band" instead of "wrinkly skin" and described the ridged band at the ''Second International Symposium on Circumcision'', organized by [http://www.nocirc.org NOCIRC] in San Francisco, 1991, after examining the foreskins of 22 adults obtained at autopsy.&lt;ref name="Taylor1996" /&gt; The mean age was 37 years, range 22–58.&lt;ref name="Taylor1996" /&gt; The prepuces were studied grossly and histologically.&lt;ref name="Taylor1996" /&gt;

The term ''ridged band'' was subsequently used by Taylor in an anatomical and histological study of the foreskin published in the ''British Journal of Urology'' in 1996.&lt;ref name="Taylor1996"&gt;{{vcite journal

| doi=10.1046/j.1464-410X.1996.85023.x}} (Reprint: cirp.org)&lt;/ref&gt;  Most or all of the ridged band is removed by [[male circumcision]].&lt;ref name="Taylor1996" /&gt;

==Structure==
[[Image:Ridged band magnified10x.jpeg|thumb|right|271px|Part of a ridged band under 10&amp;times; magnification. The delicate and highly innervated mucosa features many ridges which increase sensitivity through increased surface area.]]
Taylor described the ridged band as a transversely ridged band of [[mucosal tissue]], located just inside the tip of the foreskin near the [[mucocutaneous boundary]], also known as the ''preputial sphincter''. He characterized the ridged band as [[blood vessels|intensely vascular]] and [[nerve|richly innervated]], stating that it "contains more [[Meissner's corpuscles]] than does the smooth mucosa", and noted that these tactile corpuscles were found only in the crests of ridges.

==Function==

 }}

The prepuce, including the ridged band, is a specific erogenous zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Winkelmann RK | year = 1959 | title = The erogenous zones: their nerve supply and significance | url = http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/winkelmann/ | journal = Mayo Clin Proc | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 39–47 | pmid = 13645790 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor (1996) postulates that "the ridged band with its unique structure, tactile corpuscles and other nerves, is primarily sensory tissue".&lt;ref name="Taylor1996" /&gt; He hypothesizes (2007) that Meissner's corpuscles in the ridged band are adapted to detect stretch:
:Work in progress indicates that retraction and stretching of this accordion-like structure triggers reflex contraction of [[bulbospongiosus muscle|bulbocavernosus]] and [[bulbospongiosus]].&lt;ref name="Taylor2007Sep"&gt;{{vcite journal

 | doi = 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00588.x
 | pmid = 17727357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor theorizes that the main function of the ridged band is to trigger sexual reflexes. In a letter to the editor of ''BJU International'', 2007, Taylor writes:
:Initial study (J.R.T. unpublished) indicates that the real importance of the ridged band to sexual intercourse lies in an ability to trigger a reflex contraction of muscles responsible for ejaculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal
 | author = Taylor, JR
 | title = Fine-touch pressure thresholds in the adult penis (letter)

 | doi = 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2007.07026_4.x
 | pmid = 17552969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Journal of Sexual Medicine'', 2007, Taylor states:

:Both glans and prepuce contribute to the single [[Mucocutaneous zone|mucocutaneous junctional zone]] of the penis and it is possible that these apparently dissimilar structures in fact share similar functions related more to sexual reflexes than to touch perception.&lt;ref name="Taylor2007Sep" /&gt;

The effect of circumcision on sexual function is the subject of intense debate. Taylor's view is that "almost certainly, removal of the prepuce and its ridged band distorts penile reflexogenic functions but exactly how and to what extent still remains to be seen".&lt;ref name="Taylor2007Sep" /&gt; More recent research has demonstrated that the clinically important [[bulbocavernosus reflex]] is absent in 73% of circumcised men ostensibly due to the removal of fine-touch nerve endings in the ridged band.&lt;ref name=Podnar_2012&gt;

==Background==

Before the 1992 implementation of the [[Medicare fee schedule]], physician payments were made under the "[[usual, customary and reasonable]]" payment model (a "charge-based" payment system). Physician services were largely considered to be misvalued under this system, with evaluation and management services being undervalued and procedures overvalued.&lt;ref name="MPP"&gt;{{cite web |title=Report to the Congress: Medicare Payment Policy |url=http://www.medpac.gov/documents/Mar06_EntireReport.pdf |work=[[Medicare Payment Advisory Commission]] |page=137 |date=March 2006 |accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-party payers (public and private health insurance) advocated an improved model to replace the UCR fees, which had been associated with stark examples of [[Specialty (medicine)|specialist]]s making significantly higher sums of money than [[primary care physician]]s.&lt;ref name="Better"&gt;{{cite book |title=Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance |last=Gawande |first=Atul |authorlink=Atul Gawande |year=2007 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |isbn=0-312-42765-4 |page=115 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-EUba-LKZ04C&amp;pg=PT83&amp;dq=in+the+mid-eighties,+doctors+who+spent+an+hour+making+a+complex+and+lifesaving+diagnosis+were+paid+forty+dollars&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=M047TsqOF-fk0QHzxo2zCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=in%20the%20mid-eighties%2C%20doctors%20who%20spent%20an%20hour%20making%20a%20complex%20and%20lifesaving%20diagnosis%20were%20paid%20forty%20dollars&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With reference to the research of [[William Hsiao]] and colleagues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[William Hsiao|Hsiao WC]], Braun P, Yntema D, Becker ER |title=Estimating physicians' work for a resource-based relative-value scale |journal=[[N. Engl. J. Med.]] |volume=319 |issue=13 |pages=835–41 |date=September 1988 |pmid=3412414 |doi=10.1056/NEJM198809293191305}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989]] was passed with the legislative intent of reducing the payment disparity between primary care and other specialties through use of the [[resource-based relative value scale]] (RBRVS). Beginning in 2000, all three components of the Medicare RBRVS, physician work, practice expense and malpractice expense are resource-based as required by Section 1848(c) of the Social Security Act.

RUC was established in 1991 by the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) and [[medical specialist]] groups.&lt;ref name="PrescribesFees"&gt;{{cite news |title=Physician Panel Prescribes the Fees Paid by Medicare |author1=Anna Wilde Mathews |author2=Tom McGinty |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=October 26, 2010 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704657304575540440173772102 |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AMA sponsors RUC "both as an exercise of 'its First Amendment rights to petition the Federal Government' and for 'monitoring economic trends ... related to the CPT [Current Procedures and Terminology] development process".&lt;ref name="Unintended"/&gt;

RUC is highly influential because it ''de facto'' sets Medicare valuations of physician work [[relative value units]] (RVUs)&lt;ref name="LittleKnown"/&gt; of [[Current Procedural Terminology]] (CPT) codes.&lt;ref name="Every"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Moore KJ, Felger TA, Larimore WL, Mills TL | title=What every physician should know about the RUC | journal=[[Fam Pract Manag]] |date=February 2008 | volume= 15 | issue= 2 | pages= 36–9 | pmid=18303653 | doi= | pmc= | url=http://www.aafp.org/fpm/2008/0200/p36.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) is the ''de jure'' work RVU determining body.) On average, physician work RVUs make up slightly more than half of the value in a Medicare payment.&lt;ref name="Unintended"/&gt; Historically, CMS has accepted RUC recommendations more than 90% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;see http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/31/5/965&lt;/ref&gt; Health economist [[Uwe Reinhardt]] characterized the CMS as slavishly accepting RUC recommendations.&lt;ref name="LittleKnown"/&gt; The physician work RVU values accepted by CMS also influence private [[Health insurance in the United States|health insurance]] reimbursement.&lt;ref name="Unintended"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Goodson JD| title=Unintended consequences of resource-based relative value scale reimbursement | journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] | date= November 21, 2007 | volume= 298 | issue= 19 | pages= 2308–10 | pmid=18029836 | doi=10.1001/jama.298.19.2308 | url = https://www.sgim.org/userfiles/file/RVU%20article%20from%20JAMA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a RUC update of values raised concerns that the process, which was initiated by medical speciality groups, unfairly cut [[primary care physician]] pay.&lt;ref name="Rapidly"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Ginsburg PB| title=Rapidly evolving physician-payment policy — more than the SGR | journal=[[N Engl J Med]] | year= 2011 | volume= 364 | issue= 2 | pages= 172–6 | pmid=21142529 | doi=10.1056/NEJMhpr1004028 | url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMhpr1004028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 ''[[Archives of Internal Medicine]]'' publication written before the major health care reform legislation passed Congress—the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA)—Federman ''et al''. wrote:

{{quote|Physician dissatisfaction with Medicare reimbursements and concerns about equity of reimbursements suggest that the role of the RUC in advising Medicare should be carefully evaluated. The Obama administration and health policy experts have called for the creation of an independent Medicare advisory committee ... Without an independent arbiter, physicians and physician groups are likely to continue having complaints about the equitability of reimbursements under Medicare.&lt;ref name="PhysOpin"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Federman AD, Woodward M, Keyhani S | title=Physicians' opinions about reforming reimbursement: results of a national survey | journal=[[Arch Intern Med]] | year= 2010 | volume= 170 | issue= 19 | pages= 1735–42 | pmid=20975020 | doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2010.369}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Critics have pointed out that many RUC members may have significant conflicts of interest because of their financial relationships.&lt;ref name="careandcost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careandcost.com/2011/04/28/conflicts-of-interests-among-the-rucs-members/|title=Conflicts of Interests Among The RUC's Members|date=28 April 2011|website=careandcost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 a report in the Washington ''Post'' highlighted how time seemed to bend in the system of time values assigned to various procedures. A Florida practice performing an average twelve colonoscopies and four other procedures a day in 2012 would be considered to take the physically impossible 26 hours in a nine- to 10-hour day. In other examples: In Florida and Pennsylvania surgery centers in some specialties, "more than one in five doctors would have to have been working more than 12 hours on average on a single day — much longer than the 10 hours or so a typical surgery center is open"; and "Florida records show 78 doctors — gastroenterologists, ophthalmologists, orthopedic surgeons and others — who performed at least 24 hours worth of procedures on an average workday". RUC chairperson Levy said in the report, "None of us believe the numbers are fine-tuned.... We do believe we get them right with respect to each other" while emphasizing that the "voting people around that table can be really harsh". Researcher Hsiao of the original Harvard study said the "current set of values 'seems to be distorted.... The AMA fought very hard to take over this updating process. I said this had to be done by an impartial group of people. This is highly political'". Looking at the time between 2003 and 2013, "the AMA and Medicare have increased the work values for 68 percent of the 5,700 codes analyzed by The Post, while decreasing them for only 10 percent" and while technology is argued, again with colonoscopies as an example, to be reducing actual time spent. Looked at another way, "Medicare spending on physician fees per patient grew 58 percent between 2001 and 2011, mostly because doctors increased the number of procedures performed but also because the price of those procedures rose". Finally, there was an indication in the report that the acceptance rate of the AMA's values by Medicare "has fallen in recent years from 90 percent [or higher] to about 70 percent" but the federal agency has far fewer people &amp;ndash; "six to eight" &amp;ndash; monitoring the process than the AMA has operating it.&lt;ref&gt;Whoriskey, Peter, and Dan Keating, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/how-a-secretive-panel-uses-data-that-distorts-doctors-pay/2013/07/20/ee134e3a-eda8-11e2-9008-61e94a7ea20d_story.html?tid=pm_pop "2How a secretive panel uses data that distort doctors’ pay"], Washington ''Post'', July 20, 2013. Retrieved 2013-07-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The RUC bears the brunt of the inherent problems with regulation and government price-setting. In a follow-up to The Washington Post report, Bloomberg notes: "There is no system of payment-setting that will not ultimately rely on information from self-interested parties, just as there is no system of financial regulation that can be designed without talking to bankers, or a system of education reform that can be put in place without asking teachers and principals how things work now." &lt;ref&gt;McArdle, Meagan, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-29/who-should-set-medicare-prices-.html] "Who Should Set Medicare Prices?" Bloomberg, July 29, 2013. Retrieved 2013-07-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Independent Payment Advisory Board]] passed in the PPACA. It could bypass RUC to cut payments to relatively highly compensated specialists, such as [[dermatologist]]s.&lt;ref name="LittleKnown"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Most health industry players would win under overhaul |author=Phil Galewitz |newspaper=[[Kaiser Health News]] |publisher=[[McClatchy Washington DC News Bureau]] |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2009/08/16/73802/most-health-industry-players-would.html |date=August 16, 2009 |accessdate=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ilya Petrou |date=March 2010 |title=Examining healthcare reform |journal=[[Dermatology Times]] |publisher= |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=3–5 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=John Jesitus |date=April 2010 |title=Battling back |journal=Dermatology Times |publisher= |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=1, 26 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=John Jesitus |year=2010 |title=Weighing the impact |journal=Dermatology Times |publisher= |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=1, 22, 25–6 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Thing-Fish''''' is an album by [[Frank Zappa]], originally released as a [[Double album#Triple album|triple album]] [[box set]] on [[Barking Pumpkin Records]] in 1984. It was billed as a [[cast recording]] for a proposed musical of the same name, which was ultimately not produced by Zappa, but later performed in 2003, ten years after his death.

The album's storyline is inspired by [[Broadway theatre]], [[AIDS]], [[eugenics]], [[conspiracy theories]], [[feminism]], [[homosexuality]] and [[African American culture]]. It involves an evil, racist prince/theater critic who creates a disease intended to eradicate African Americans and homosexuals. The disease is tested on prisoners who are turned into "Mammy Nuns" led by the story's narrator, Thing-Fish. The [[story within a story]] is a [[satire]] of a [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] couple, Harry and Rhonda (actually played by Italian-Americans), who attend a play performed by the "Mammy Nuns", and find themselves confronted with their pasts: Harry presented as a homosexual boy, Rhonda presented as a [[sex doll]] brought to life.

The story was constructed during the recording sessions, which included producing new [[overdub]]s for recordings which previously appeared on Zappa's albums ''[[Zoot Allures]]'', ''[[Tinseltown Rebellion]]'', ''[[You Are What You Is]]'' and ''[[Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch]]''.  The release of the album was delayed when [[Barking Pumpkin Records]]' previous distributor, [[MCA Records|MCA]], refused to distribute the album. It was instead released by [[Capitol Records]] in the United States, accompanied by a "[[Warning label|Warning/Guarantee]]" written by Zappa himself. ''Thing-Fish'' was initially received poorly by critics, who criticized the use of previously recorded material, but has since been reappraised for its highly satirical content.

== Background ==
Before leaving for London to record with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], [[Frank Zappa]] was home during Christmas season in 1982, and kept busy by writing, producing treatments for three films and a Broadway musical called ''Thing-Fish''.&lt;ref name="Miles"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barry Miles|title=Zappa: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BW1Jom4nswwC&amp;pg=PA317|accessdate=July 22, 2013|date=September 2005|publisher=GROVE/ATLANTIC Incorporated|isbn=978-0-8021-4215-3|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1981 and 1982, [[Broadway theatre]] had shifted from conservative musicals to experimental plays that were viewed as either being pretentious or vulgar.&lt;ref name="Lowe"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kelly Fisher Lowe|title=The Words and Music of Frank Zappa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAYfqgGf4yYC&amp;pg=PA188|accessdate=July 22, 2013|year=2007|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-6005-4|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thing-Fish'' satirized statements made by theater critics at the time, as well as arguing against the "[[dumbing down]]" of American culture.&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; Previously, Zappa unsuccessfully attempted to stage two musicals on Broadway, ''Hunchentoot'', which formed the basis for the [[compact disc]] reissue of ''[[Sleep Dirt]]'', and a musical adaptation of [[William S. Burroughs]]' ''[[The Naked Lunch]]''.&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; ''Thing-Fish'' also drew conceptual themes from [[AIDS]], [[feminism]], gay chic, conspiracy theories and issues of class, greed and race.&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt;

The script was developed by recording songs beforehand; much of the songs in the play were previously recorded for other albums, including ''[[Zoot Allures]]'', ''[[Tinseltown Rebellion]]'', ''[[You Are What You Is]]'' and ''[[Ship Arriving Too Late To Save A Drowning Witch]]''.&lt;ref name=Slaven/&gt; New vocals were combined with previously released tracks and new [[Synclavier]] music. In addition to the new songs, the previously recorded songs include new overdubs moving this storyline forward.&lt;ref name=Couture/&gt; As the recording process continued, Zappa brought in revised scripts and improved the work by editing or changing aspects with which he was dissatisfied.&lt;ref name=Slaven/&gt;

Zappa attempted to produce ''Thing-Fish'' as a Broadway production.&lt;ref name=Miles/&gt; In promotion of the planned musical, a photo sequence based upon the "Briefcase Boogie" scene was shot for the pornographic magazine ''[[Hustler]]'', accompanied by plot excerpts from the scene.&lt;ref name="Buckley2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Buckley|title=The Rough Guide to Rock|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fie47qSuTsoC&amp;pg=PA2244|accessdate=July 22, 2013|year=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-85828-457-6|page=2244}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence was 28 pages long.&lt;ref name="MacDonell2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Allan MacDonell|title=Prisoner of X: 20 Years in the Hole at Hustler Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3QJsiE8qZQkC&amp;pg=PA79|accessdate=July 22, 2013|year=2006|publisher=Feral House|isbn=978-1-932595-13-0|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the album was released, Zappa was unable to raise the $5 million budget in order to produce the play, and shelved the project.&lt;ref name=Miles/&gt; Subsequently, ''Thing-Fish'' dialogue appeared on the album ''Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention'', during the piece "Porn Wars".&lt;ref name="LLC1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=SPIN Media LLC|title=SPIN|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8JuDPDsl1gC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=July 22, 2013|date=January  1986|publisher=SPIN Media LLC|page=11|issn=0886-3032}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was adapted for a limited stage production that took place in England in 2003.

=== Lyrics and story themes ===
{{quote box|quote="The simple thought behind ''Thing-Fish'' is that somebody manufactured a disease called AIDS and they tested it. They were developing it as a weapon and they tested it on convicts, the same way as they used to do experiments on black inmates, using syphilis. That's documented. They used to do these experiments with syphilis on black inmates in US prisons. That's fact. So we take it one step further and they're concocting the special disease which is genetically specific to get rid of 'all highly rhythmic individuals and sissy boys.' So I postulate that they do this test in a prison and part of the test backfires and these mutants are created."&lt;ref name=Slaven/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Frank Zappa|width=365px}}
The Thing-Fish characterization was performed by [[Ike Willis]], who helped shape the dialogue himself using [[African American Vernacular English]]&lt;ref name="Slaven"&gt;{{cite book|author=Niel Slaven|title=Electric Don Quixote: The Definitive Story Of Frank Zappa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0lyCSdW78-sC&amp;pg=PA338|accessdate=July 22, 2013|publisher=Music Sales Group|isbn=978-0-85712-043-4|page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Willis, "in my family, we sort of joke around with dialects, and what it sounded like to me was [the poet] [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]]. [...] I asked Frank if he had ever heard of this guy, and he said, 'No,' so I started giving him examples of Dunbar's work, and eventually, that ended up being a big influence on the Thing-Fish dialect."&lt;ref name=Slaven/&gt;

[[Minstrel shows]] served as a source of satire within the storyline.&lt;ref name=Couture-MammyNuns/&gt; The Thing-Fish characterization is also seen as satirizing ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'', a successful radio series and controversial television series which drew protests from the [[NAACP]], who perceived the dialect spoken by the main characters and supporting character Kingfish as being portrayed as being "too dumb to speak English."&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; Additionally, Zappa satirized the [[Mammy archetype]]; the AIDS-like disease in the storyline turns prisoners into "Mammy Nuns" which are round and dress like [[Aunt Jemima]].&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; The Mammy archetype derives from the fictional character Mammy, as portrayed by [[Hattie McDaniel]] in the film ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With The Wind]]''.&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt;

''Thing-Fish'' is delivered as a [[story within a story]], focusing on a spoiled [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] couple, Harry and Rhonda, who attend a play that initially begins as being about and starring the Mammy Nuns. The story ultimately ends up following these characters through a series of ideological fads.&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; It is revealed that Harry had become a [[homosexual]] as a result of the [[women's liberation movement]], which caused him to lose all sexual desire for women; the younger versions of the characters are portrayed in the characters "Harry-As-A-Boy" and "Artificial Rhonda", with the young Rhonda being portrayed as a rubber [[sex doll]], while her older counterpart becomes increasingly fascistic and feminist towards the end of the story.&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt;

== Release ==

The ''Thing-Fish'' album was identified as an "original cast recording". [[Barking Pumpkin Records]] prepared to release the album with distribution by [[MCA Records]].&lt;ref name=Miles/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zappa&gt;{{cite book| title = The Real Frank Zappa Book| first = Frank with Occhiogrosso, Peter| last = Zappa| year = 1989| publisher=Poseidon Press| location = New York| isbn = 0-671-63870-X |pages=278–279}}&lt;/ref&gt; MCA produced a test pressing of the triple LP set, but withdrew their distribution after a woman in their quality control department became offended and upset by the album's content.&lt;ref name=Miles/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zappa/&gt;

A deal was quickly made with [[EMI Records]], which would allow ''[[Them Or Us]]'' and ''Thing-Fish'' to be distributed by [[Capitol Records]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=Miles/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zappa/&gt; Zappa wrote a "[[Warning label|warning]]" which appeared on the inner sleeves of these albums, as well as ''[[Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention]]'', which stated that the albums contained content "which a truly free society would neither fear nor suppress", and a "guarantee" which stated that the lyrics would not "cause eternal torment in [[Hell|the place]] where [[The Devil|the guy with the horns and pointed stick]] conducts his business."&lt;ref name=Miles/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zappa/&gt; 

The original vinyl mix of ''Thing-Fish'' was only briefly available on [[compact disc|CD]] via a 1987 EMI release in the United Kingdom. All other CD releases contain modifications, edits, re-equalization, and some minor remixing (the most significant difference—Johnny "Guitar" Watson's spoken vocals during "He's So Gay"—was not implemented immediately). This new version was initially released on CD by [[Rykodisc]], and along with most of Zappa's catalogue was reissued in 1995, also by Rykodisc. 

In 2012, after the Zappa Family Trust had regained the rights to Zappa's catalogue, [[Zappa Records]], along with [[Universal Music]] reissued the album (still in revised form) on CD.

''Thing-Fish'' was poorly received by critics upon initial release; a common thread of criticism was that many of the songs on this album derived from previously released recordings, and some detractors considered it to be nothing more than a [[compilation album]].&lt;ref name=Couture/&gt; [[Barry Miles]] found it to be one of his "least substantive" works.&lt;ref name=Miles/&gt;

More recently the album has been reappraised, described by Kevin Courrier in ''Dangerous kitchen: the subversive world of Zappa'' as "a compendium of Zappa's most explicit attacks on political and sexual hypocrisy in American culture collected together in one huge volley."&lt;ref name="Courrier"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Courrier|title=Dangerous kitchen: the subversive world of Zappa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjkUAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=July 22, 2013|date=June 1, 2002|publisher=ECW Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Frank Zappa and musical theatre: ugly ugly o'phan Annie and really deep, intense, thought-provoking Broadway symbolism'', ''Thing-Fish'' is described as "an extraordinary example of [[bricolage]]".&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4885">In [[psychology]] and [[sociology]], the '''Thurstone scale''' was the first formal technique to measure an [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. It was developed by [[Louis Leon Thurstone]] in 1928, as a means of measuring attitudes towards [[religion]]. It is made up of statements about a particular issue, and each statement has a numerical value indicating how favorable or unfavorable it is judged to be. People check each of the statements to which they agree, and a [[mean]] score is computed, indicating their attitude.

==Thurstone scale==
Thurstone's method of pair comparisons can be considered a prototype of a [[normal distribution]]-based method for scaling-dominance matrices. Even though the theory behind this method is quite complex (Thurstone, 1927a), the algorithm itself is straightforward. For the basic Case V, the frequency dominance matrix is translated into proportions and interfaced with the standard scores. The scale is then obtained as a left-adjusted column marginal average of this standard score matrix (Thurstone, 1927b). The underlying rationale for the method and basis for the measurement of the "psychological scale separation between any two stimuli" derives from Thurstone's [[Law of comparative judgment]] (Thurstone, 1928).

The principal difficulty with this algorithm is its indeterminacy with respect to one-zero proportions, which return z values as plus or minus infinity, respectively. The inability of the pair comparisons algorithm to handle these cases imposes considerable limits on the applicability of the method.

The most frequent recourse when the 1.00-0.00 frequencies are encountered is their omission. Thus, e.g., Guilford (1954, p.&amp;nbsp;163) has recommended not using proportions more extreme than .977 or .023, and Edwards (1957, pp.&amp;nbsp;41–42) has suggested that '' “if the number of judges is large, say 200 or more, then we might use pij values of .99 and .01, but with less than 200 judges, it is probably better to disregard all comparative judgments for which pij is greater than .98 or less than .02."’ '' Since the omission of such extreme values leaves empty cells in the Z matrix, the averaging procedure for arriving at the scale values cannot be applied, and an elaborate procedure for the estimation of unknown parameters is usually employed (Edwards, 1957, pp.&amp;nbsp;42–46). An alternative solution of this problem was suggested by Krus and Kennedy (1977).

With later developments in psychometric theory, it has become possible to employ direct methods of scaling such as application of the [[Rasch model]] or unfolding models such as the Hyperbolic Cosine Model (HCM) (Andrich &amp; Luo, 1993).  The Rasch model has a close conceptual relationship to Thurstone's law of comparative judgment (Andrich, 1978), the principal difference being that it directly incorporates a person parameter.  Also, the Rasch model takes the form of a logistic function rather than a cumulative normal function.

== Intention ==
An intended pregnancy is one that is consciously desired at the time of conception.&lt;ref name=BestIntent /&gt;&lt;!-- page 3 --&gt; Pregnancy is intended if either partner intended or desired a pregnancy to occur, though the other [[Sexual partner|partner]] may not want a pregnancy either at all or at that time, or he/she may be ambivalent to a pregnancy.&lt;ref name=BestIntent /&gt;

Feelings towards a pregnancy can change during the course of a pregnancy. For instance, a change of circumstances might lead to the continued pregnancy being unwanted and perhaps a desire to terminate an initially intended pregnancy. On the other hand, an initially unintended pregnancy might later be welcomed.

Couples often desire to control not just the number of children, but also the timing.&lt;ref name=AGI1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=USAIDHTSP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esdproj.org/site/PageServer?pagename=Themes_Spacing_KeyMessages |

== Causes ==
* Not using [[contraception]] or [[family planning]] services.&lt;ref name=speidel /&gt;
* Using contraception inconsistently or incorrectly.&lt;ref name=speidel /&gt;
* Contraceptive failure (the method was used correctly, but did not work.)&lt;ref name=speidel /&gt;  Contraceptive failure accounts for a relatively small fraction of unintended pregnancies when modern highly effective contraceptives are used.&lt;ref name="Hatcher20th"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hatcher, Robert D.|title=Contraceptive Technology|publisher=Ardent Media, Inc.|year=2011|edition=20th|isbn=978-1-59708-004-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- page 514 --&gt;  A condom breaking during intercourse or using a condom with a hole in it can lead to malfunctioning contraceptives.

Reasons contraceptives might not have been used or been used incorrectly include:
* Coercion. [[Rape]], or even [[forced pregnancy]], which sometimes happens in the context of [[domestic violence]]. Unintended pregnancies are more likely to be associated with abuse than intended pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hathaway J.E. |author2=Mucci L.A. |author3=Silverman J.G. | year = 2000 | title = , Health status and health care use of Massachusetts women reporting partner abuse | url = | journal = Am J Prev Med | volume = 19 | issue = 4| pages = 302–307 | doi=10.1016/s0749-3797(00)00236-1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may also include [[birth control sabotage]], which is the manipulation of someone's use of birth control to undermine efforts to prevent pregnancy.
* Lack of knowledge about sex and reproduction, including erroneous beliefs.
* Lack of knowledge or experience with the contraceptive or lack of motivation to use it correctly.
* Lack of planning or ambivalence about whether to have a child.
* Lack of over-the-counter availability of contraceptives.
* Inability or unwillingness to attend healthcare appointments to obtain contraceptives.
* A mistaken belief that the woman is infertile, e.g. post-menopausal, previous diagnosis of infertility
* Being under the influence of alcohol

== Facts ==
According to one study, over one-third of living people in the US under 31 years of age (born since 1982) were the result of unintended pregnancies, a rate that has remained largely unchanged to date.&lt;ref name="Oopsie babies2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Oopsie babies?

Pregnancy has risks and [[complications of pregnancy|potential complications]]. On average, unintended pregnancies result in poorer outcomes for the mother and for the child, if birth occurs. Unintended pregnancy usually precludes [[pre-conception counseling]] and pre-conception care, and sometimes delays initiation of [[prenatal care]].&lt;ref name=HP2020FP /&gt; The great majority of abortions result from unintended pregnancies.

=== Adoption ===
{{main| Adoption}}
 
Unintended pregnancies often result in an adoption of the infant, where the biological parents (or birth parents) transfer their privileges and responsibilities to the adoptive parents.  There are two forms of adoptions: open adoptions and closed adoptions.  Open adoption allows birth parents to know and have contact with the adoptive parents and the adopted child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/openadoption.pdf|website=Child Welfare}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a closed adoption, there is no contact between the birth parents and adoptive parents. Information identifying the adoptive parents and the birth parents is not shared. However, non-identifying information (i.e. background and medical information) about the birth parents, will be shared with the adoptive parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/openadoption.pdf|website=Child Welfare}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Birth parents choose adoption when parenting is not possible and they don’t want to endure an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unplanned Pregnancy Options|url=https://adoptionnetwork.com/abortion-adoption-parenting|website=Adoption Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States alone, 135,000 children are adopted each year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet|url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/offandrunning/fact-sheet/|website=PBS|date=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which represents about [[Adoption|3% of all live births]].  According to the 2010 census, there were 1,527,020 adopted children in the United States, representing 2.5 percent of all U.S. children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adopted Children and Stepchildren: 2010|website=US Census|publisher=https://www.census.gov/prod/2014pubs/p20-572.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maternal deaths ===
{{main| Maternal death}}

Over the six years between 1995 and 2000 there were an estimated 338 million pregnancies that were unintended and unwanted worldwide (28% of the total 1.2 billion pregnancies during that period).&lt;ref name="promises"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Promises to Keep: The Toll of Unintended Pregnancies on Women's Lives in the Developing World | url = http://www.globalhealth.org/news/article/2319 | accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These unwanted pregnancies resulted in nearly 700,000 maternal deaths (approximately one-fifth of maternal deaths during that period). More than one-third of the deaths were from problems associated with pregnancy or childbirth, but the majority (64%) were from complications from [[unsafe abortion|unsafe or unsanitary abortion]].&lt;ref name=promises/&gt;  Most of the deaths occurred in less developed parts of the world, where [[family planning]] and [[reproductive health]] services were less available.&lt;ref name=promises/&gt;

In cultures that practice [[honor killing]], unintended pregnancy may increase the woman's chance of being killed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

== Prevention ==
{{main|Family planning}}

Prevention includes comprehensive [[sexual education]], availability of [[family planning]] services, abstinence and increased access to a range of effective [[birth control]] methods.  Most unintended pregnancies result from not using contraception, and many result from using contraceptives inconsistently or incorrectly. Though, increased rates of sexual activity are also a factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lifenews.com/2013/05/06/unintended-pregnancy-rates-rise-despite-increased-contraception-use/ |title=Unintended Pregnancy Rates Rise Despite Increased Contraception Use |first=Michael |last=New |date=May 6, 2013 |work=LifeNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing use of [[long-acting reversible contraceptive]]s (LARCs) (such as [[IUD]] and [[contraceptive implant]]s) decreases the chance of unintended pregnancy by decreasing the chance of incorrect use. Method failure is relatively rare with modern, highly effective contraceptives, and is much more of an issue when such methods are unavailable or not used.

In the United States, women who have an unintended pregnancy are more likely to have subsequent unplanned pregnancies.&lt;ref name="ahrq2011" /&gt; Providing family planning and contraceptive services as part of prenatal, postpartum and post abortion care can help reduce recurrence of unintended pregnancy.

Providing contraceptives and family planning services at low or no cost to the user helps prevent unintended pregnancies.  Many of those at risk of unintended pregnancy have little income, so even though contraceptives are highly cost-effective,&lt;ref name=Trussell2009&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Contraception|year = 2009| volume=79|issue = 1| pmid=19041435| pages = 5–14| title = Cost effectiveness of contraceptives in the United States |author1=James Trussell |author2=Anjana Lalla |author3=Quan Doan |author4=Eileen Reyes |author5=Lionel Pinto |author6=Joseph Gricar | doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2008.08.003| pmc=3638200}}&lt;/ref&gt; up front cost can be a barrier.

==== History ====
US birth rates declined in the 1970s.  Factors that are likely to have led to this decline include: The introduction of the [[combined oral contraceptive|birth control pill]] in 1960, and its subsequent rapid increase in popularity; the completion of legalization of contraceptives in the 1960s and early 1970s; the introduction of federal funding for family planning in the 1960s and [[Title X]] in 1970; increased career and educational gains for women and its consequence of increased opportunity costs; and the legalization of abortion, which was completed in 1973.  The decline in the birth rate was associated with reductions in the number of children put up for [[adoption]] and reduction in the rate of neonaticide.

* It is unclear to what extent legalization of abortion may have increased the availability of the procedure.&lt;ref name=BestIntent /&gt;&lt;!-- page 51 --&gt;  It is estimated that before legalization about 1 million abortions were performed annually.&lt;ref name=BestIntent /&gt;&lt;!-- page 51 --&gt;  Before legalization, abortion was probably one of the most common criminal activities.&lt;ref name=BestIntent /&gt;&lt;!-- page 51 --&gt;  Before legalization, an estimated 1,000 to 10,000 women died each year from complications of poorly performed abortions.&lt;ref name=BestIntent /&gt;  Legalization was followed by a decrease in pregnancy related deaths in young women, as well as decrease in hospital admissions for incomplete or septic abortions, conditions more common than induced abortion.&lt;ref name=BestIntent /&gt;&lt;!-- page 51 --&gt;
* The infanticide rate during the first hour of life dropped from 1.41 per 100,000 during 1963 to 1972 to 0.44 per 100,000 for 1974 to 1983; the rate during the first month of life also declined, whereas the rate for older infants rose during this time.&lt;ref name=Paul&gt;{{cite book| title = Management of unintended and abnormal pregnancy: comprehensive abortion care | author = Maureen Paul | page = 34 | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | isbn = 978-1-4051-7696-5 | date = 2009-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proportion of births that were unintended at the time of conception decreased during the 1970s and early 1980s.  Between 1982 and 1988 the proportion of births that were unintended began increasing.&lt;ref name=BestIntent /&gt;&lt;!-- page 2 --&gt;  In 1990 about 44% of births were unintended at time of conception.&lt;ref name=BestIntent /&gt;&lt;!-- page 2 --&gt;  The fraction of births that were unintended at the time of conception was even higher among lower class women (almost 60%), never-married women (73%) and unmarried teens (86%).&lt;ref name=BestIntent /&gt;&lt;!-- page 2 --&gt;

Among lower-class women, the rate of unintended pregnancy and unintended birth rose from 1994 to 2001, while it declined for the more affluent women (those more than 200% of federal poverty level).&lt;ref name=Finer2006 /&gt;  (Unintended pregnancy rose almost 30% and unintended births rose 50% for those below federal poverty level.)  Contraceptive use had been increasing for years, but stopped in the 1990s, and began to decline among lower class women.&lt;ref name=Kaufman&gt;{{cite news| title =  Unplanned Pregnancy Increases among Poor | author = Marc Kaufman | url = http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/0505-07.htm | publisher = San Francisco Chronicle | accessdate = 2011-08-23 | date = May 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cuts in federal and state family planning programs may account for the decreased use of contraceptives and increase in unintended pregnancies.&lt;ref name=Kaufman/&gt;

==== Costs and potential savings ====
The public cost of unintended pregnancy is estimated to be about 11 billion dollars per year in short-term medical costs.&lt;ref name=Monea2011 /&gt;  This includes costs of births, one year of infant medical care and costs of fetal loss.&lt;ref name=Monea2011 /&gt;  Preventing unintended pregnancy would save the public over 5 billion dollars per year in short-term medical costs.&lt;ref name=Monea2011 /&gt;  Savings in long-term costs and in other areas would be much larger.&lt;ref name=Monea2011&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health |date=June 2011 | volume = 43 |vauthors=Monea J, Thomas A | title = Unintended pregnancy and taxpayer spending | pages = 88–93 | doi = 10.1363/4308811 | pmid=21651707 | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By another estimate, the direct medical costs of unintended pregnancies, not including infant medical care, was $5 billion in 2002.&lt;ref name="Trussell07"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Trussell J|title=The cost of unintended pregnancy in the United States|journal=Contraception|volume=75|issue=3|pages=168–70|date=March 2007|pmid=17303484|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2006.11.009|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010-7824(06)00447-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Brookings Institution conducted a research and their results show that taxpayers spend more than $12 billion each year on unintended pregnancies. They also find that, if all unintended pregnancies were prevented, the resulting savings on medical spending alone would equal more than three-quarters of the federal FY 2010 appropriation for the Head Start and Early Head Start programs and would be roughly equivalent to the amount that the federal government spends each year on the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The High Cost of Unintended Pregnancy|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2011/07/unintended-pregnancy-thomas-monea|publisher=The Brookings Institution|date=2001-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a total of 329,797 babies were born to women aged 15–19 years, for a live birth rate of 31.3 per 1,000 women in this age group.1 This is a record low for U.S. teens in this age group and a drop of 8% from 2010. Birth rates fell 11% for women aged 15–17 years, and 7% for women aged 18–19 years. While reasons for the declines are not clear, teens seem to be less sexually active, and more of those who are sexually active seem to be using birth control than in previous years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teen Pregnancy|url=https://www.cdc.gov/teenpregnancy/|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prevention ====

In the US it is estimated that 52% of unintended pregnancies result from couples not using [[birth control|contraception]] in the month the woman got pregnant, and 43% result from inconsistent or incorrect contraceptive use; only 5% result from contraceptive failure, according to a report from the [[Guttmacher Institute]].&lt;ref name=speidel&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Contraception |date=September 2008 | title = The Potential of Long-acting Reversible Contraception to Decrease Unintended Pregnancy |author1=J.

In 2006, publicly funded family planning services ([[Title X]], Medicaid, and state funds) helped women avoid 1.94 million unintended pregnancies, thus preventing about 860,000 unintended births and 810,000 abortions.&lt;ref name=guttmacherPubBC /&gt; Without publicly funded family planning services, the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in the United States would be nearly two-thirds higher among women overall and among teens; the number of unintended pregnancies among lower class women would nearly double&lt;ref name=guttmacherPubBC&gt;{{cite web|date=February 2011|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_contraceptive_serv.html|title=Facts on Publicly Funded Contraceptive Services in the United States|publisher=[[Guttmacher Institute]]|accessdate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The services provided at publicly funded clinics saved the federal and state governments an estimated $5.1 billion in 2008 in short term medical costs.&lt;ref name=guttmacherPubBC /&gt; Nationally, every $1.00 invested in helping women avoid unintended pregnancy saved $3.74 in Medicaid expenditures that otherwise would have been needed.&lt;ref name=guttmacherPubBC /&gt;

Reducing unintended pregnancy in the United States would be particularly desirable since abortion is such a politically divisive issue.&lt;ref name=BestIntent /&gt;&lt;!-- page 54 --&gt;

The CDC encourages men and women to formulate a [[reproductive life plan]], to help them in avoiding unintended pregnancies and to improve the health of women and reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. | title=Recommendations to improve preconception health and health care&amp;nbsp;— United States: a report of the CDC/ATSDR Preconception Care Work Group and the Select Panel on Preconception Care.| journal=MMWR|year=2006|volume=55|issue= RR-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period from 2001 to 2008, there were notable increases in the use of long-acting methods among younger women, while the pill and condom are most common, the more effective methods, such as intrauterine devices and implants, are recommended for young women and women without children.&lt;ref name=Finer2014/&gt;

==== Rape ====
{{main|Pregnancy from rape}}

Rape is defined as sexual intercourse that is forced on a person without his or her permission. It may involve physical force, the threat of force, or it may be done against someone who is unable to give consent.
Sexual intercourse may be vaginal, anal, or oral, and may involve the use of a body part or an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rape (sexual assault) - overview|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001955.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A longitudinal study in 1996 of over 4000 women in the United States followed for 3 years found that the [[Effects and aftermath of rape|rape-related pregnancy]] rate was 5.0% among victims aged 12–45 years. Applying that rate to rapes committed in the United States would indicate that there are over 32,000 pregnancies in the United States as a result of rape each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9378(96)70141-2 | last1 = Holmes | first1 = MM | last2 = Resnick | year = 1996 | first2 = HS | last3 = Kilpatrick | first3 = DG | last4 = Best | first4 = CL | title = Rape-related pregnancy: estimates and descriptive characteristics from a national sample of women | url = | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 175 | issue = 2| pages = 320–324 | pmid = 8765248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

{{see also|History of abortion|History of condoms|Timeline of reproductive rights legislation|}}

Early ways of preventing unwanted pregnancy included [[Coitus interruptus|withdrawal]] and various alternatives to intercourse; they are difficult to use correctly and, while much better than no method, have high failure rates compared to modern methods.&lt;ref name=AGI1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Potts2009&gt;{{cite journal | author = Potts, M, Campbell, M | journal = Glob. Libr. Women's Med. | issn = 1756-2228 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.3843/GLOWM.10376|title = History of contraception| url = http://www.glowm.com/?p=glowm.cml/section_view&amp;articleid=375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various devices and medications thought to have [[spermicides|spermicidal]], contraceptive, abortifacient or similar properties were also used.

Abortions have been induced to prevent unwanted births since antiquity,&lt;ref name=BestIntent /&gt;&lt;!-- page 51 --&gt; abortion methods are described in some of the earliest medical texts.&lt;ref name=Potts2009/&gt;  The degree of safety of early methods relative to the risks of child birth is unclear.&lt;ref name=Potts2009/&gt;

[[Infanticide]] (‘customary [[neonaticide]]’) or [[child abandonment|abandonment]] (sometimes in the form of exposure) are other traditional ways of dealing with babies that were not wanted or that a family could not support.&lt;ref name=Potts2009 /&gt;  Opinions on the morality or desirability of the practices have changed through history.

Where modern contraceptives are not available, abortion has sometimes been used as a major way of preventing birth.  For instance in much of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics in the 1980s, desired family size was small, but modern contraceptive methods were not readily available, so many couples relied on abortion, which was legal, safe, and readily accessible, to regulate births.&lt;ref name=AGI1999 /&gt;  In many cases, as contraceptives became more available the rate of unintended pregnancy and abortion dropped rapidly during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=AGI1999 /&gt;

In the 19th and 20th centuries, the desired number of pregnancies has declined as reductions in infant and childhood mortality have increased the probability that children will reach adulthood.  Other factors, such as level of education and economic opportunities for women, have also led to reductions in the desired number of children.&lt;ref name=AGI1999 &gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/ib_0599.html | title = Abortion in Context: United States and Worldwide | publisher = Alan Guttmacher Institute | date = May 1999 | accessdate = 2011-08-28 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006143558/https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/ib_0599.html|archive-date=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the desired number of children decreases, couples spend more of their reproductive lives trying to avoid unintended pregnancies.&lt;ref name=AGI1999 /&gt;

[[Water resources]] in many parts of [[Mexico]] are under stress, especially in the arid northwest and central regions where most of the population lives and most of the economic activities are located. The country has put in place a system of water resources management that includes both central (federal) and decentralized (basin and local) institutions.

Despite many achievements, the water resources sector in Mexico still faces some challenges, including: (i) increasing water scarcity, (ii) [[over-exploitation]] of freshwater resources, especially groundwater, (ii) deteriorating water quality, (iii) lack of financial sustainability of the water sector, (iv) modernizing water supply and sanitation services, (v) improving competitiveness and efficiency of irrigation, (vi) strengthening water institutions, (vii) adapting to climate change impacts, especially droughts and floods.

== History and recent developments ==

Mexico has a long and well-established tradition on water resources management (WRM) which started in the 1930s when the country began investing heavily in water storage facilities and groundwater development to expand irrigation and supply water to the rapidly expanding population.

The 1934 Código Agrario, promulgated during the [[Lázaro Cárdenas|Cárdenas]] administration (1934-1940), granted the federal government sweeping powers to define the "public interest" to which water could be harnessed. By virtue of such legislation, between the 1930s and 1970s, the [[ejido]] sector and rural communities were subject to direct federal control over water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
 | author=Sanderson, S.E.
 | title=Agrarian Populism and the Mexican State:The Struggle for Land in Sonora
 | journal=University of California Press
 | year=1981
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private landowners, on the other hand, enjoyed the benefits of federally subsidized irrigation infrastructure and guaranteed market prices. Over time, large landowners became highly capitalized, while small farmers, by the 1970s, were suffering from the effects of water monopolies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
 | author=Hewitt de Alcántara, C.
 | title=La modernización de la agricultura mexicana, 1940-1970
 | journal=Siglo Veintiuno Editores
 | year=1988
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the Mexican government entered into a tripartite agreement with the [[The World Bank Group|World Bank]], and the [[United Nations Development Program]] to prepare the 1975 National Water Plan (NWP) which identified the need to enact a National Water Law (NWL) and a National Water Authority as well as decentralize responsibilities and promote water user participation in operational and maintenance (O&amp;M).

The NWP spurred a significant institutional development and infrastructural achievements. In 1983 the federal government transferred the responsibility for water supply and sanitation to municipalities and states. The Mexican Institute of Water Technology (IMTA) was established in 1986, and the National Water Commission (CONAGUA, sometimes also called CNA in 1989). Also in 1989 the first Basin Council in [[Lerma River|Lerma]]&amp;ndash;[[Chapala, Mexico|Chapala]] was created, incorporating water users from multiple sectors.

During the 1990s, Mexico's [[groundwater]] boom took place with rapid development and pumping of aquifers for combined agricultural, urban, and industrial demand. Also the federal government (CNA) decentralized responsibility for large irrigation infrastructure to autonomous agencies (irrigation districts).
 
In 1992, Mexico adopted a National Water Law, which contained specific provisions for the role of the CNA, the structure and functioning of river basin councils, public participation in water management, etc.

In 1993, the Cutzamala system was completed, becoming one of the largest pumping schemes in the world, pumping 19 cubic meters of water per second into the [[Mexico City|Mexico City Metropolitan area]], over a difference of altitude of 940m and a distance of 162&amp;nbsp;km.

In 1997 the first technical groundwater committee was created to manage an overexploited aquifer in the state of [[Guanajuato]].

With the 2004 Revision of the National Water Law, the thirteen decentralized CNA regions would become basin organizations serving as the technical arm of more broad-based basin councils that incorporate civil society interests including the private sector and citizens’ groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Availability ==

Total internal renewable water resources are 457 billion cubic meters (BCM)/year, plus 49 BCM/year inflows from neighboring countries (average 1977-2001).&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthtrends.wri.org/pdf_library/country_profiles/wat_cou_484.pdf World Resources Institute Mexico] and [http://earthtrends.wri.org/pdf_library/data_tables/wat2_2005.pdf World Resources Institute Water]&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest river on the Pacific coast is the [[Balsas River]] (24 BCM/year) and the largest river on the Atlantic Coast is the [[Grijalva River|Grijalva]]&amp;ndash;[[Usumacinta]] flowing from Guatemala to Mexico (115 BCM.year). The longest river (2018&amp;nbsp;km) and also the river with the largest basin (226,000&amp;nbsp;km²) is the [[Río Bravo del Norte|Rio Bravo]], called [[Rio Grande]] in the United States.

Water is abundant in the relatively sparsely populated South and scarce in the more densely populated Center and North of the country. The Center and the North of the country where 77% of Mexico's population lives and 85% of its [[GDP]] is generated dispose of only 32% of the country's renewable water resources.&lt;ref&gt;CNA 2006, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainfall is highly variable and droughts are frequent. The states most affected by drought, as measured by the agricultural area affected by drought, are [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Mexico State|Mexico]] and [[Zacatecas]].&lt;ref&gt;CNA 2006, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==

Total water withdrawals for consumptive use are 78 BCM/year. The largest consumptive water user is agriculture (78%), followed by domestic use (17%) and industry (5%).

There are no estimates on the [[Minimum Environmental Flow]] Requirements in Mexico. Environmental demand thus is de facto absent from the official water balances in Mexico.

[[Hydropower]] is a major source of electricity generation in Mexico with an installed capacity of 10.3 [[Gigawatt]] or 22% of the installed capacity in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;CNA 2006, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Electricity sector in Mexico}}

== Storage ==

There are seven major lakes in Mexico. By far the largest and most important is the [[Chapala Lake]] in Central Mexico with an area of 1,116&amp;nbsp;km² and a storage capacity of more than 8 BCM. Actual storage volume varies between 1 and 10 BCM since measurements began in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;CNA 2006, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; The lake is only 4 to 6 m deep.

There are 667 large dams with a storage capacity of 150 BCM and an actual storage of 70 BCM in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;CNA 2006, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The largest dam by storage volume is the [[Angostura Dam (Mexico)|La Angostura Dam]] on the [[Grijalva River]] in the state of [[Chiapas]] with a storage volume of more than 10 BCM.

== Water balance ==

Overall, only 18% of water resources in Mexico are withdrawn for consumptive use. However, there is water stress in several regions of the country. The highest pressure on water resources is encountered around Mexico City (120% of resources), in [[Baja California]] (86% of resources) and in [[Sonora]] in the Northeast (79% of resources).

CNA has defined 653 "[[aquifer]]s" out of which 104 were categorized as overexploited in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;CNA 2006, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Total groundwater use was 27.5 BCM/year, while recharge is estimated at 77BCM/year. Out of the country's 13 administrative hydrological regions, in 4 regions abstraction exceeds recharge: Baja California, Northeast, North-Center and the Valley of Mexico.

== Water balance and climate change ==

In the context of the US National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change ([[National Assessment on Climate Change]]) published in 2000, which was part of the US Global Change Research Program ([[Global Change Research Act]]), the National Ecology Institute of the National University of Mexico (UNAM) carried out a study on Impacts of Climate Change and Climate Variability in Mexico for the Mexican Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. According to the study Mexico will experience less or normal summer precipitation and increased precipitation during winter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usgcrp.gov/usgcrp/Library/nationalassessment/newsletter/1999.10/Mexico.html INE 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; The report also details predicted impact by regions. For example, in the Lerma-Chapala basin the predicted increase in temperature coupled with a decrease in rainfall could result in severe water supply shortages, exacerbated by growth in population and industries. In northern areas and regions with large populations, especially in Central Mexico erosion and drought severity will increase with higher temperatures and rainfall variations in these arid and semi arid regions. Agricultural practices may also have to change, with a severe drought in Chihuahua in 2012, which some scientists attribute to climate change, leading to 350,000 head of cattle starving to death due to a shortage of pasture caused by a lack of rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tegel|first=Simeon|title=Chihuahua: Where the Rain Doesn't Fall Anymore|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/mexico-chihuahua-drought-water-cattle-poverty-climate-change|accessdate=13 August 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have also predicted that tensions between Mexico and the US over shared water resources could increase as climate change increases water scarcity in both countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.iu.edu/tips/page/normal/4921.html Jones and Auer]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Water quality and pollution ==

Information on the water quality of Mexico's rivers published by the National Water Commission is limited to only two parameters, [[Biological Oxygen Demand]] (BOD) and [[Chemical Oxygen Demand]] (COD). No other water quality indicators are used to classify water bodies and no water quality data using other pollutants as parameters are readily available.

Surface water bodies in Mexico are classified in five different ambient water quality classes, using BOD and COD as indicators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cna.gob.mx/eCNA/Espaniol/Programas/Subdirecciones/SGTCA/DBO.pdf CNA Pollution Classification]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 surface water quality was measured in 509 sites using these parameters.

Using BOD as an indicator, in 2005 5% of water bodies were classified as highly contaminated (BOC &gt; 120&amp;nbsp;mg/l) and 10% as contaminated.(BOD &gt; 30&amp;nbsp;mg/l). If COD is used as an indicator, the respective shares increase to 12% for highly contaminated (COD &gt; 200) and 26% for contaminated (COD &gt; 40) waterbodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cna.gob.mx/eCNA/Espaniol/Programas/Subdirecciones/SGTCA/DBO-NACIONAL.htm CNA Pollution Map]&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest levels of contamination are found in the hydrological regions of the Northeast, Balsas, Valley of Mexico and Lerma-Chapala.&lt;ref&gt;CNA 2006, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal and institutional framework ==

===Legal framework===
The main law governing water resources management in Mexico is the National Water Law of 1992, revised on April 29, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cna.gob.mx/eCNA/Espaniol/MarcoNormativo/Leyes/Ley%20de%20Aguas%20Nacionales.pdf National Water Law]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Law, key functions in the sector are the responsibility of the federal government, through the National Water Commission (CNA or Conagua). CNA's mission is to "manage and preserve national water resources, with the participation of the society, to reach a sustainable use of the resource."  CNA has a staff of 16,000 and an annual budget of 18.6bn Pesos in 2005 (more than US$1.5bn) and is considered to be one of the most powerful federal agencies in Mexico. CNA administrates major federal programs to support investments in water supply and sanitation as well as in irrigation. It also directly manages certain key hydraulic facilities such as the [[Cutzamala Pipeline|Cutzamala]] Pipeline that supplies a large share of the water used in the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City. CNA also owns and operates most dams in Mexico and operates the country's water monitoring network.

Through the 2004 revision of the National Water Law two new entities were formally created: Basin Councils (Consejos de Cuenca) and Basin Agencies (Organismos de Cuenca). The basin councils consist of representatives of the federal government, state and municipal governments, as well as at least 50% representatives of water users and NGOs. The basin councils are not decision-making bodies, but are consultative bodies. There are 26 basin councils. The basin agencies, on the other hand, are the regional administrative branches of the CNA, which retains the ultimate decision-making power.

Obviously other entities such as the Ministry of Finance, the Federal Congress, State Governments and State Congresses, as well as the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources are important decision-makers in the sector.

===Institutional framework===

Three groups of institutions have been assigned with the main responsibilities for WRM: (i) the National Water Commission (Comision Nacional del Agua –CONAGUA), at the federal level; (ii) Water Commissions (Comisiones Estatales del Agua – CEAs), at the State level; and (iii) basin authorities and basin councils.

CONAGUA is the highest institution for water resource management in Mexico, including water policy, water rights, planning, irrigation and drainage development, water supply and sanitation, and emergency and disaster management (with an emphasis on flooding). CONAGUA is formally under the authority of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (Secretaria del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales – SEMARNAT) but it enjoys considerable de facto autonomy. It employs 17,000 professionals and has 13 regional offices and 32 state offices.

The CEAs are autonomous entities that usually are under the authority of the State Ministry of Public Works. Their attributions are different among states and can include water resources management, irrigation and the provision of water supply and sanitation services.

The recently created Basin Authorities (BAs) will develop from the 13 existing Regional Offices of CONAGUA and are expected to be responsible for formulating regional policy, designing programs to implement such policies, conducting studies to estimate the value of the financial resources generated within their boundaries (water user fees and service fees), recommending specific rates for water user fees and collecting them.

Basin Councils (BCs) are expected to guide, together with CONAGUA, BAs work. There are a total of 25 BCs that have been established with the same basin boundaries as the BAs, but in some cases with two or more BCs within the area of one BA. Some states are located entirely within the area of one BC. In other cases, one state is divided between two or more BCs. In the latter case, the state participates in all of the BCs within its territory.

===Government strategy===

The 2004 amended National Water Law (NWL) aims to restructure CONAGUA key functions through the transfer of responsibilities from the central level to subnational entities: the basin agencies (Organismos de Cuenca – BA) and Basin Councils (Consejos de Cuenca – BC). BA and BCs are expected to play an increasing role in the sector limiting CONAGUA's role to the administration of the NWL, the conduct of national water policy, and planning, supervision, support and regulatory activities.

The NWL also introduced  a Water Financing System (Sistema Finaciero del Agua – SFA). CONAGUA will create together with the Ministry of Finance appropriate instruments to determine funding sources, spending guidelines, cost recovery, settling of accounts and management indicators.

=== Instruments: Permits and pricing ===

Two key instruments of water resources management at the disposal of the CNA are permits and abstraction charges. However, the effectiveness of permits is reduced by the fact that the total volume of water for which permits have been granted exceeds total water availability in some regions. A total of  344,473 permits were registered in 2005 in the public register of water rights established in 1992. The total volume of water for which permits were granted is 76 BCM/year, excluding permits for hydropower, which is a non-consumptive use of water.

Water resource pricing through abstraction charges is carried out on the basis of the Federal Rights Law, which classifies the country in nine water scarcity zones. In zones with the highest water scarcity, generally in the North, abstraction charges are highest. However agriculture as the major water user is exempt from the abstraction charge and the charge only paid by industry and municipal users. This considerably limits the effectiveness of the charge as a tool for water demand management, although it has been very effective at mobilizing financial resources. Total revenues from abstraction charges were 6.5bn Pesos in 2005, accounting for 80% of CNA revenues.

== International treaties ==

The sharing of the waters of the [[Colorado River]], the [[Tijuana River]] and the [[Río Bravo del Norte|Rio Bravo]]/[[Rio Grande]] is defined in the [[Treaty of Washington (1944)|Treaty of Washington]] between the USA and Mexico signed on February 3, 1944.
