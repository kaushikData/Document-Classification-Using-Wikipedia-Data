'''''A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform''''' is the 1983 report of [[President of the United States|American President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[National Commission on Excellence in Education]]. Its publication is considered a landmark event in modern American educational history. Among other things, the report contributed to the ever-growing assertion that American schools were failing,&lt;ref name="Failing 1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sinquefield|first=Rex|title=Public Schools Are Failing, And That's A Healthy Sign For Good Teachers|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rexsinquefield/2013/09/20/public-schools-are-failing-and-thats-a-healthy-sign-for-good-teachers/|accessdate=2013-12-16|newspaper=Forbes|date=2013-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Failing 2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Klein|first=Joel|title=The Failure of American Schools|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/06/the-failure-of-american-schools/308497/|accessdate=2013-12-16|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=2011-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it touched off a wave of local, state, and federal reform efforts.

==Formation and motivation==
The commission consisted of 18 members, drawn from the private sector, government, and education. The chair of the commission was [[David Pierpont Gardner]].&lt;ref name="Nation At Risk"&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/pubs/NatAtRisk/index.html Full report of A Nation at Risk]&lt;/ref&gt;  Secretary of Education [[Terrel Bell|T. H. Bell]] sought to have the commission be presidentially appointed. Reagan did not concur, and Bell used his own authority as Secretary to establish the commission and appoint its members.&lt;ref&gt;Kosar, Kevin R. [http://federaleducationpolicy.wordpress.com/229-2/ Ronald Reagan and Education Policy] (Studies in Governance and Politics, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

As implied by the title of the report, the commission's charter responds to [[Terrel Bell|Terrel Bell's]] observation that the United States' educational system was failing to meet the national need for a competitive workforce. Among other things, the charter required the commission to assess the "quality of teaching and learning" at the primary, secondary, and postsecondary levels, in both the public and private spheres and to compare "American schools and colleges with those of other advanced nations." The report was primarily authored by James J. Harvey, who synthesized the feedback from the commission members and the memorable language in the opening pages: "the educational foundations of our society are presently being eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity that threatens our very future as a Nation and a people" and "If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today, we might well have viewed it as an act of war."&lt;ref name="Nation At Risk"/&gt;

Presidential commissions on education have been relatively common since [[Higher Education for American Democracy|The Truman Report]] in 1947. Other notable groups include [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s "Committee on Education Beyond the High School" (1956), [[John F. Kennedy]]'s Task Force on Education (1960), and [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Commission on the Future of Higher Education]], also known as the Spellings Commission, which produced "A Test of Leadership" (2006).

==The published report==
The report surveys various studies which point to academic underachievement on national and international scales. For example, the report notes that average [[SAT]] scores dropped "over 50 points" in the verbal section and "nearly 40 points" in the mathematics section during the period 1963-1980. Nearly forty percent of 17-year-olds tested could not successfully "draw inferences from written material," and "only one-fifth can write a persuasive essay; and only one-third can solve a mathematics problem requiring several steps."  Referencing tests conducted in the 1970s, the study points to unfavorable comparisons with students outside the United States: on "19 academic tests American students were never first or second and, in comparison with other industrialized nations, were last seven times".&lt;ref name="Nation At Risk"/&gt;

In response to these and similar problems, the commission made 38 recommendations, divided across 5 major categories: Content, Standards and Expectations, Time, Teaching, Leadership and Fiscal Support:

* '''Content''': "4 years of English; (b) 3 years of mathematics; (c) 3 years of science; (d) 3 years of social studies; and (e) one-half year of computer science" for high school students." The commission also recommends that students work toward proficiency in a foreign language starting in the elementary grades.
* '''Standards and Expectations''': the commission cautioned against [[grade inflation]] and recommends that four-year colleges raise admissions standards and standardized tests of achievement at "major transition points from one level of schooling to another and particularly from high school to college or work."
* '''Time''': the commission recommended that "school districts and State legislatures should strongly consider 7-hour school days, as well as a 200- to 220-day school year."
* '''Teaching''': the commission recommended that salaries for teachers be "professionally competitive, market-sensitive, and performance-based," and that teachers demonstrate "competence in an academic discipline."
* '''Leadership and Fiscal Support''': the commission noted that the Federal government plays an essential role in helping "meet the needs of key groups of students such as the [[Intellectual giftedness|gifted and talented]], the socioeconomically disadvantaged, minority and language minority students, and the handicapped."  The commission also noted that the Federal government also must help ensure compliance with "constitutional and civil rights," and "provide student financial assistance and research and graduate training."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/pubs/NatAtRisk/recomm.html Archived: Recommendations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Nation at Risk'' was at odds with several of [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan's]] stated policy initiatives for education: "voluntary prayer under school auspices, tax credits for tuition payments and abolition of the department of education".&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, Edward. "Top Objectives Elude Reagan As Education Policy Evolves." ''New York Times'' 27 Dec 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
In 1990, [[James D. Watkins|Admiral James Watkins]], the [[United States Secretary of Energy|Secretary of Energy]], commissioned the Sandia Laboratories in New Mexico to document the decline in the Nation at Risk report with actual data.&lt;ref&gt;Ansary, Tamim.  [http://www.edutopia.org/landmark-education-report-nation-risk Education at Risk: Fallout from a Flawed Report].&lt;/ref&gt; When the systems scientists broke down the SAT test scores into subgroups they discovered contradictory data. While the overall average scores declined, the subgroups of students increased. In statistics this is known as [[Simpson's paradox]]. The three authors presented their report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ482502&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ482502 The Sandia Report and U.S. Achievement: An Assessment]. [http://www.heldref.org/jer.php The Journal of Educational Research JER] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216043528/http://www.heldref.org/jer.php |date=December 16, 2008 }}, v87 n3 p133-47 Jan-Feb 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  David Kearns, Deputy Secretary of Education allegedly told the authors of the report, "You bury this or I'll bury you"&lt;ref&gt;Bracey, Gerald. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gerald-bracey/righting-wrongs_b_75189.html Righting Wrongs].  December 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Diane Ravitch]] disputes this quote.&lt;ref&gt;Ravitch, Diane. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/diane-ravitch/is-us-education-better-_b_75441.html Is U.S. Education Better Than Ever?]. December 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Education Week'' published an article on the Sandia report in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Julie A.  [http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1991/10/09/06crisis.h11.html "Report Questioning 'Crisis' in Education Triggers an Uproar]," [http://www.edweek.org/ Education Week]. October 9, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the ''Nation at Risk'' report, the Sandia Report critique received almost no attention.

On the 25th anniversary of the release of ''A Nation at Risk'', the organization [[Strong American Schools]] released a report card showing progress since the initial report.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080828192156/http://www.edin08.com/uploadedFiles/Issues/A%20Stagnant%20Nation.pdf "ED IN 08 UNVEILS NEW ANALYSIS AND REPORT CARD SURROUNDING 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF A NATION AT RISK"]&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's analysis said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
While the national conversation about education would never be the same, stunningly few of the Commission’s recommendations actually have been enacted. 
Now is not the time for more educational research or reports or commissions. We have enough commonsense
ideas, backed by decades of research, to significantly improve American schools. The missing ingredient isn’t even educational at all. It’s political. Too often, state and local leaders have tried to enact reforms of the kind recommended in A Nation at Risk only to be stymied by organized special interests and political inertia. Without vigorous national leadership to improve education, states and local school systems simply cannot overcome the obstacles to making the big changes necessary to significantly improve our nation’s K-12 schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edin08.com/anationatrisk/ ED in 08 | Strong American Schools: Making Education a Priority - Issues&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501170657/http://www.edin08.com/anationatrisk/ |date=May 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Salvatore Babones]] has criticized the composition and competences of the committee:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The commission included 12 administrators, 1 businessperson, 1 chemist, 1 physicist, 1 politician, 1 conservative activist, and 1 teacher. ...  Just one practicing teacher and not a single academic expert on education. It should come as no surprise that a commission dominated by administrators found that the problems of U.S. schools were mainly caused by lazy students and unaccountable teachers. Administrative incompetence was not on the agenda. Nor were poverty, inequality, and racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Salvatore|last1=Babones|title=Education "reform’s" big lie: The real reason the right has declared war on our public schools|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/05/09/education_reforms_big_lie_the_real_reason_the_right_has_declared_war_on_our_public_schools/|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}{{italic title|all=yes|noerror}}'''''Adler v Ontario (AG)''''', [1996] 3 S.C.R. 609 is a leading decision of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] on the nature of the provincial education power and whether there was a constitutional obligation to fund private denominational education. The Court found that Ontario's  ''Education Act'' did not violate [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|sections 2(a)]] or [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|15(1)]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' or section 93 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]''.

==Issues==

The guarantees provided for religious freedom under sections 2(a) and religious equality under section 15(1) of the ''Charter'' were used to argue that lack of government funding for [[Jewish Canadian]] schools and certain Christian schools in [[Ontario]] was unconstitutional, since by contrast Catholic schools received government funding in accordance with section 93 of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''. The court was asked to address two specific constitutional issues:

{{quote|
# whether the definitions of "board" and "school" in s. 1(1) of the ''Education Act'', together with the annual general legislative grants, infringe or deny the appellants' freedom of religion under s. 2(a) of the ''Charter'' or their s. 15(1) equality rights by not providing funding to dissentient religion‑based schools, and if so, is this non‑funding justified under s. 1, and
# whether s. 14 of Regulation 552, R.R.O. 1990, which prescribed school health support services as insured services to an insured person who is placed in a special education program in a "school" as defined in s. 1(1) of the ''Education Act'', but not to an insured person in a dissentient religion‑based school, infringes or denies the appellants' freedom of religion under s. 2(a) of the ''Charter'' or their s. 15(1) equality rights by not providing these services to dissentient religion‑based independent schools, and if so, was this withholding of services justified under s. 1.
|}}

==Ruling of the Supreme Court==

The ruled 7-1 on the first question, and 6-2 on the second, that the provisions in question were constitutional. L’Heureux‑Dubé J. dissented on both questions, and McLachlin J. dissented in part on the first question, and in full on the second.

===Funded education===

The majority of the Court held that the provincial education power under section 93 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' is [[plenary power|plenary]], and is not subject to ''Charter'' attack. As Iacobucci J. noted, it is the product of a historical compromise crucial to Confederation and forms a comprehensive code with respect to denominational school rights which cannot be enlarged through the operation of s. 2(a) of the ''Charter''. It does not represent a guarantee of fundamental freedoms.  The appellants, given that they cannot bring themselves within the terms of s. 93's guarantees, have no claim to public funding for their schools.  To decide otherwise by accepting the appellants' claim that s. 2(a) requires public funding of their dissentient religion‑based schools would be to hold one section of the Constitution violative of another.

The claim that the government's choice to fund Roman Catholic separate schools but not other religious schools contravened the equality provisions of s. 15(1) of the ''Charter'' should be rejected for two reasons:

* First, the decision falls "fairly and squarely" within s. 29 of the ''Charter'' which explicitly exempts from ''Charter'' challenge all rights and privileges "guaranteed" under the Constitution in respect of denominational, separate or dissentient schools.
*Second, the decision is nonetheless "immune" from ''Charter'' review because it was made pursuant to the plenary power in relation to education granted to the provincial legislatures as part of the Confederation compromise.  One part of the Constitution cannot be used to interfere with rights protected by a different part of that same document.

There was a difference in interpretation as to how far the education power can extend towards the establishment of other education systems. The majority believed that legislation in respect of education could be subject to Charter scrutiny whenever the government decides to go beyond the confines of this special mandate to fund Roman Catholic separate schools and public schools. Sopinka J., on the other hand, observed that nothing in s. 93(3) restricts extending funding to others. However, when the province exercises its plenary power outside of the areas specified in s. 93(1) and (3), any distinctions violating the ''Charter'' are not "expressly permitted" or even contemplated.  Legislation in such cases is no different from legislation under any of the heads of s. 92.  Giving effect to the ''Charter'' will not invalidate any power conferred by s. 93.

McLachlin J. stated that Section 93 is not a code ousting the operation of the ''Charter'' and was not intended to do more than guarantee school support for the Roman Catholic or Protestant minorities in Ontario and Quebec respectively.  Provinces exercising their plenary powers to provide education services must, subject to this restriction, comply with the ''Charter''. Otherwise, she considered the provisions in question to be constitutional.

L’Heureux‑Dubé J. declared that the only school support guaranteed by s. 93 is that required of Ontario and Quebec to their respective Roman Catholic and Protestant minorities.  Provinces exercising their plenary powers to provide education must, subject to this requirement, comply with the Charter. The provisions survived a challenge under Section 2, but ought to fail under Section 15.

===School health support services===

Both Iacobucci J. and Sopinka J. held that the School Health Support Services Program in question is immune from Charter scrutiny, as it is properly characterized as an "education service", as opposed to a "health service", and thus falls within the plenary education power.

In dissent, both McLachlin J. and L’Heureux‑Dubé J. felt that the Program should not survive a Section 15 ''Charter'' challenge, as the denial of the health support program to the independent schools is not rationally connected to the objectives of providing universal education without discrimination, and is not justifiable under Section 1.

Dr. '''B. Jill Carroll''' is a freelance writer, speaker, scholar and organizational consultant whose first career was as a university professor specializing in world religions and philosophy of religion.  She was the Executive Director of the Boniuk Center for the Study and Advancement of Religious Tolerance at [[Rice University]] and an adjunct professor of Religious Studies at the university.  She resigned from the directorship in June 2009 stating her intentions to continue writing a blog for the Houston Chronicle entitled "[http://blog.chron.com/talkingtolerance/ Talking Tolerance]" and staying involved in the leadership of the Amazing Faiths Project&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs034/1101932703209/archive/1102616844250.html&lt;/ref&gt; which she had founded and directed since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazingfaithsproject.org/index.cfm?fa=contentGeneric.bnqxlfjrthezhkzv |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725002007/http://www.amazingfaithsproject.org/index.cfm?fa=contentGeneric.bnqxlfjrthezhkzv |archivedate=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her research interests are issues in [[comparative religion]], religion and world politics, and [[natural theology]]. For two years she co-hosted with Kym King a regular radio program called "Peaceful Coexistence" on [[Pacifica Radio|Pacifica]] 90.1FM [[KPFT]] in [[Houston]]. Podcasts of the show are available at the Boniuk Center website.

In fall 2011, she published a lifestyle/self-help book called Stop the Crap: Six Lessons to Get Your Life Back.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Stop-the-Crap-ebook/dp/B005V0XH2C&lt;/ref&gt;  Her first novel, Quail Fried Rice, was published in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Quail-Fried-Rice-ebook/dp/B008MXQUDS/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363894284&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Quail+Fried+rice&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, she began working as a program consultant for the Houston/Gulf Coast chapter of American Leadership Forum.  

She was president and founder of Religiosites, Inc., a company that provided religious diversity training to corporations, groups and individuals.

In the late 90s she wrote "The Adjunct Track", a regular column for the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]''. She founded Adjunct Solutions, a consulting service for part-time faculty in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cohesion.rice.edu/humanities/reli/faculty.cfm?doc_id=3862 |title=Religious Studies at Rice University: B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3440">'''CUSPEA''' (China-U.S. Physics Examination and Application) was an examination and admission system used by the [[physics]] departments of some [[United States of America|American]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] universities for [[graduate school]] admission from [[People's Republic of China]] between 1979 and 1989.  

It was created by the [[Chinese-American]] physicist [[Tsung-Dao Lee]] and Chinese physics community as an alternative graduate school admission procedure.  At that time in China, [[higher education]] was still recovering from the [[Cultural Revolution]]; [[Transcript (education)|school transcripts]] and [[recommendation letter]]s were difficult to evaluate.  Furthermore, [[standardized tests]] such as the [[Graduate Record Examination]] were unavailable in China.

==Details==

The CUSPEA exam is in English and has a similar scope to that of Ph.D. written qualifying exams in major American universities.  The questions were prepared by physics professors from participating North American universities -- starting with [[Columbia University]] where Lee worked, and eventually expanded to 97 universities.  Committees of physicists in China administer and grade the exams.  The examinees are usually senior physics majors from top-ranking Chinese universities.  Those who passed the exam are followed up by an interview by a small American delegation.  The final admission depends on mutual agreement between the applicant and participating physics departments.

About 100 Chinese students went to the US every year through the CUSPEA exams, and the total number is 915. Over the years, the three universities with the most students passed the exam  are (numbers in the parentheses indicate the numbers of students) [[University of Science and Technology of China]] (218), [[Peking University]] (206) and [[Fudan University]] (127).

==Similar Exams==

CUSPEA was so successful that other similar exams soon were created, such as CUSBEA for [[biochemistry]] and "[[Shiing-Shen Chern]] Project" (陈省身项目) for [[mathematics]].  All were stopped in the late 80s in favor of more standard exams.

==Continuation as Mini-CUSPEA and Re-Expansion==

In the early years in 1990s, after several years of suspension of the CUSPEA exam, a new program called Mini-CUSPEA is created. It is called "mini" in the sense that the Chinese university involved is shrunk to one -- Fudan University, and on the side of the U.S., the target is shrunk to three universities: Columbia University, New York University, and the City University of New York. 

Every year, about 6-10 students are selected through the written exams and the interviews similar to the ones used in the time of CUSPEA, and they are admitted by the above three U.S. universities. Once admitted, the usual requirements for TOEFL and GRE for Chinese students are waived for the Mini-CUSPEA participants.

Since 2007, the Mini-CUSPEA has started to expand. The Chinese universities involved are not only Fudan, but also including Peking University, Tsinghua University, and some other top universities. In the US side, the expansion is also planned.

The '''Centre for the Talented Youth of Ireland''' ('''CTYI''') is a youth programme for students between the ages of six and seventeen of high academic ability in Ireland, run by Dr. Colm O'Reilly.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dcu.ie/ctyi/secondary.shtml|title=The Centre for Talented Youth, Ireland  - Secondary School Students {{!}} DCU|website=www.dcu.ie|language=en|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are sibling projects around the world, most notably the [[Center for Talented Youth|CTY]] programme at [[Johns Hopkins University]], the original model for CTYI. CTY students are eligible to participate in CTYI's summer sessions for older students. CTYI was founded in 1992 and is based at [[Dublin City University]] in [[Glasnevin]], [[Dublin 9]]. The centre offers various courses for gifted students as well as conducting research and promoting the needs of the talented in Ireland. 

Currently, it caters for 5,000 students a year &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://giftedireland.ie/ctyi/|title=CTYI|date=2014-03-02|work=Gifted Ireland|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eligibility ==
Eligibility for CTYI's programmes is based on scores in the [[School and College Ability Test]]. Students who score within the top 5th percentile are eligible for the CTY programmes, and those who score within the top 15th percentile are eligible for the CAT programmes. 

CTYI also allows for bright and motivated students to partake in courses such as the correspondence course, and scholarships can be attained for EUE or the secondary school summer programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://giftedireland.ie/ctyi/|title=CTYI|date=2014-03-02|work=Gifted Ireland|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students can also attend on a psychologist's recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dcu.ie/ctyi/talent.shtml|title=Talent Search {{!}} Centre for Talented Youth, Ireland {{!}} DCU|website=www.dcu.ie|language=en|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primary School Programmes ==
Saturday courses are offered for Primary School students at various colleges and institutes of technology around Ireland throughout the year. There are courses for both the 6–7 age group and the 8–13 group. DCU also run classes on Wednesday afternoons.

==Secondary School Programmes==
A summer programme for 12-17 year-olds (1st - 5th Year) as part of CAT or CTY runs only at DCU. These courses give students the opportunity to study college-style and college levelled courses intensively for three weeks in the summer in one of two sessions, each of which lasts three weeks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Because of the Irish financial situation up until recently, fewer people were been able to afford the steep cost of the programme, especially since the Government cut CTYI's funding in 2009&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/education/2008/1111/1225925640957.html|title=The cuts that target the talented|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716231654/http://www.thecollegeview.com/2008/11/20/ctyi-a-cut-too-far-in-this-years-budget-website-exclusive/|title=The College View » CTYI: A cut too far in this year’s budget? - website exclusive|date=2011-07-16|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since, students can now attend both sessions of the course, and the age bracket has been increased to include up to age seventeen. 

Some of the students at the summer programme come from overseas, mostly from continental countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Italy. Owing to the intensive nature of the programme, most of the 190–250 students who attend each session are residential, living in student accommodation for the duration of the course. However, students can also commute, attending the course as the residential students do but going home at the end of the day and returning in the morning.

In 2018, the following courses were offered;

* Biomedical Engineering
* Clinical Psychology
* Child Psychology
* Computer Gaming
* Game Theory
* International Relations
* Japanese Language and Culture
* Law
* Medicine
* Neuroscience
* Novel Writing
* Robotics
* Theoretical Physics
* Maths Experience
* Computer Animation
* Criminology
* Film Studies
* Genetics &amp; Cell Biology
* Marine Biology
* Philosophy
* Sci-Fi &amp; Fantasy Writing
* Sports Science
* Radio, TV, &amp; Digital Communications

Note that the CAT (85th to 95th percentile) version of the program ends after two weeks and so has a slightly different course matter.

Weekdays in the summer programme are highly structured. Classes run from 9am to 3pm, with an hour's break for lunch. Activities take place from 3.15pm to 5pm, supervised by the residential assistants (RAs). Between 5pm and 6:30pm students have dinner and are required to attend a meeting with their RA group. 6:30pm to 8:30pm is taken up by the study period, which is supervised by the teaching assistant. Social time takes place between 8:30pm and 10pm, with lights-out at 10.30pm.

On weekends, social activities such as discos, shopping trips, visits to the cinema, excursions to various interesting sights in Ireland, talent shows, mock casino nights and so on are organised.

==Early University Entrance==
EUE is a programme for [[Transition Year]] students in secondary school. Like the summer programme, it runs on DCU's campus, with students covering two modules (equivalent to what a first year college student in DCU would study) over a school semester, one day a week each week (usually Fridays). In 2018 subjects included Law &amp; Politics, Business, Engineering, and Psychology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; EUE is open to CAT and CTY qualifying students.

==Other courses==
The centre runs correspondence courses throughout the year for 12- to 16-year-olds and also for [[Transition Year]] students who do not have to fulfil any aptitude test requirements. Courses include or have included Writing By Mail, Journalism, Psychology, Philosophy, Legal Studies, and Science of Tomorrow. There are also correspondence courses for younger students (8–13) in computing-related subjects and Writing By Mail.

==Permanent staff==
Dr. Colm O'Reilly – Director

Eleanor Healion – Academic Coordinator

Catriona Fitzgerald – Academic Coordinator/Residential Coordinator

==Other staff==

As the on-site programmes available for students are part-time and/or short-term, most of the staff associated with these programmes are contracted for a set period of time. Residential staff are hired for either 3 or 6 weeks (summer programme only) while academic staff are hired for 3 weeks, 6 weeks, or on a part-time basis during the year (e.g. an eight-week Saturday course).

;Assistant Residential Coordinators (ARCs)
These staff (usually 2, 1 male and 1 female) are responsible for the care of the students at CTYI during the 12–17 summer courses. They live in the residences with the students and are the highest-ranking staff members when Catriona and Colm are absent (e.g., at night). They are in charge of the RAs also. ARCs are often ex-RAs, who return to hold a higher point of authority. An ARC may hold the position for a number of years running, one of the current ARCs named Mary Heslin has held the position for 4 years running.

;Residential Assistants (RAs)
RAs are responsible for the care their RA group (normally a group of 18–22 students) and they report to the ARCs. Any residential students will bring up issues with their RAs. They may also act as mentors to the students if they are having problems settling in. Typically there is a mix between former CTYI students and those who have not attended the programme.

;Instructors
Instructors are generally professionals who are willing to give up 3 weeks of a year to work with CTYI's students. They are hired on the basis of specialist knowledge in a particular field and a rapport with young people. Some are former CTYI students and/or have worked on the programme as RAs or TAs.

;Teaching Assistant (TA)
A TA's primary function is to assist the instructor during class time and supervision and assisting students during study period.

;Coordinator
On the part-time programmes during the year, additional administrative staff are hired to co-ordinate Saturday programmes.

==2009 Cut in Funding==
It was announced in the [[Stock market crash#Crash of 2008–2009|post-crash]] [[Fallout of the 2009 Irish government budget|2009 Irish Government Budget]] that the government would not continue funding CTYI. Up to 2008 the Department of Education had been providing the course with €97,000. The move was criticised by CTYI staff. However a spokesperson for the Department of Education said that "the resources available for next year meant that difficult choices had to be made and the abolition of the grant to the Centre for Talented Youth was one of those tough decisions." The government had planned to allow CTYI to become a national mandate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
One of the earliest attempts was advertised in 1728. This was in the ''[[Boston Gazette]]'' for "Caleb Philipps, Teacher of the new method of [[Short Hand]]", who sought students who wanted to learn through weekly mailed lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holmberg |first1=Börje |title=The evolution, principles and practices of distance education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTtdNQAACAAJ | accessdate=2011-01-23 |series=Studien und Berichte der Arbeitsstelle Fernstudienforschung der Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg [ASF] |volume= 11 |year=2005 |publisher= Bibliotheks-und Informationssystem der Universitat Oldenburg |language=German |isbn=3-8142-0933-8 | page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first distance education course in the modern sense was provided by Sir [[Isaac Pitman]] in the 1840s, who taught a system of shorthand by mailing texts transcribed into shorthand on [[postcard]]s and receiving transcriptions from his students in return for correction. The element of student feedback was a crucial innovation of Pitman's system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/134/214|author=Alan Tait|publisher=The International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning|title=Reflections on Student Support in Open and Distance Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scheme was made possible by the introduction of [[Uniform Penny Post|uniform postage rates]] across [[England]] in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MEax6VBfRscC|title=distance learning... a magazine for leaders volume 2 number 6|author=IAP|page=18|isbn=9787774554229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This early beginning proved extremely successful, and the Phonographic Correspondence Society was founded three years later to establish these courses on a more formal basis. The Society paved the way for the later formation of Sir Isaac Pitman Colleges across the country.&lt;ref name=MooreKearsley&gt;{{cite book | last= Moore | first= Michael G. |author2=Greg Kearsley | year= 2005 | title= Distance Education: A Systems View | edition= 2nd | location= Belmont, CA | publisher= Wadsworth | isbn= 0-534-50688-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first correspondence school in the United States was the [[Society to Encourage Studies at Home]], which was founded in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Cole, Elizabeth|date=2012-00-00|title=The Invisible Woman and the Silent University.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED548106|journal=ProQuest LLC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== University correspondence courses ===
The [[University of London]] was the first university to offer distance learning degrees, establishing its [[University of London External Programme|External Programme]] in 1858. The background to this innovation lay in the fact that the institution (later known as [[University College London]]) was [[non-denominational]] and, given the intense religious rivalries at the time, there was an outcry against the "godless" university. The issue soon boiled down to which institutions had [[Academic degree|degree]]-granting powers and which institutions did not.&lt;ref name="Rothblatt Article"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/368852 |jstor=368852 |title=Supply and Demand: The "Two Histories" of English Education |journal=History of Education Quarterly |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=627–44 |year=1988 |last1=Rothblatt |first1=Sheldon |last2=Muller |first2=Detlef K. |last3=Ringer |first3=Fritz |last4=Simon |first4=Brian |last5=Bryant |first5=Margaret |last6=Roach |first6=John |last7=Harte |first7=Negley |last8=Smith |first8=Barbara |last9=Symonds |first9=Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The compromise solution that emerged in 1836 was that the sole authority to conduct the examinations leading to degrees would be given to a new officially recognized entity called the "[[University of London]]", which would act as examining body for the [[University of London]] colleges, originally [[University College London]] and [[King's College London]], and award their students [[University of London]] degrees. As [[Sheldon Rothblatt]] states: "Thus arose in nearly archetypal form the famous English distinction between [[teaching]] and [[exam]]ining, here embodied in separate institutions."&lt;ref name="Rothblatt Article" /&gt;

With the state giving examining powers to a separate entity, the groundwork was laid for the creation of a programme within the new university which would both administer examinations and award qualifications to students taking instruction at another institution or pursuing a course of self-directed study.

Referred to as "People's University" by [[Charles Dickens]] because it provided access to [[higher education]] to students from less affluent backgrounds, the External Programme was chartered by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1858, making the University of London the first university to offer distance learning degrees to students.&lt;ref name="External Programme History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.londonexternal.ac.uk/about_us/history.shtml |title="History", University of London External Programme Website |publisher=Londonexternal.ac.uk |date=15 July 2009 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Key Facts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.londonexternal.ac.uk/about_us/facts.shtml |title="Key Facts", University of London External Programme Website |publisher=Londonexternal.ac.uk |date=15 July 2009 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enrollment increased steadily during the late 19th century, and its example was widely copied elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Guardian Article"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardianabroad.co.uk/education/article/283 |author=Tatum Anderson |title=History lessons at the people's university |date=16 May 2007 |publisher=Guardianabroad.co.uk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524102204/http://www.guardianabroad.co.uk/education/article/283 |archivedate=24 May 2007 |accessdate=20 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This program is now known as the University of London International Programme and includes Postgraduate, Undergraduate and Diploma degrees created by colleges such as the London School of Economics, Royal Holloway and Goldsmiths.&lt;ref name="Key Facts" /&gt;

[[File:Portrait of William Rainey Harper.jpg|thumb|200x200px|[[William Rainey Harper]], encouraged the development of external university courses at the new University of Chicago in the 1890s.]]
In the United States, [[William Rainey Harper]], first president of the [[University of Chicago]], celebrated the concept of extended education, whereby the research university had satellite colleges in the wider community.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In 1892, Harper encouraged correspondence courses to further promote education, an idea that was put into practice by Chicago, Wisconsin, Columbia, and several dozen other universities by the 1920s [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Levinson |first1=David L |title=Community colleges: a reference handbook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xrnPJcb7c54C |year= 2005 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn= 1-57607-766-7 |page=69 |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von V. Pittman, ''Correspondence Study in the American University: A Second Historiographical Perspective,'' in Michael Grahame Moore, William G. Anderson, eds. ''Handbook of Distance Education'' pp 21-36&lt;/ref&gt; Enrollment in the largest private for-profit school based in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], the [[International Correspondence Schools]] grew explosively in the 1890s. Founded in 1888 to provide training for immigrant coal miners aiming to become state mine inspectors or foremen, it enrolled 2500 new students in 1894 and matriculated 72,000 new students in 1895. By 1906 total enrollments reached 900,000. The growth was due to sending out complete textbooks instead of single lessons, and the use of 1200 aggressive in-person salesmen.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph F. Kett, ''Pursuit of Knowledge Under Difficulties: From Self-Improvement to Adult Education in America'' (1996) pp 236-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Clark, "The Correspondence School—Its Relation to Technical Education and Some of Its Results," ''Science'' (1906) 24#611 pp 327-8, 332, 333. Clark was manager of the school's text-book department.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a stark contrast in pedagogy:

{{blockquote|The regular technical school or college aims to educate a man broadly; our aim, on the contrary, is to educate him only along some particular line. The college demands that a student shall have certain educational qualifications to enter it and that all students study for approximately the same length of time; when they have finished their courses they are supposed to be qualified to enter any one of a number of branches in some particular profession. We, on the contrary, are aiming to make our courses fit the particular needs of the student who takes them.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, "The Correspondence School" (1906) p 329&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Education was a high priority in the [[Progressive Era]], as American high schools and colleges expanded greatly. For men who were older or were too busy with family responsibilities, night schools were opened, such as the [[YMCA]] school in Boston that became [[Northeastern University]]. Outside the big cities, private correspondence schools offered a flexible, narrowly focused solution.&lt;ref&gt;Kett, ''Pursuit of Knowledge Under Difficulties,'' p 240&lt;/ref&gt; Large corporations systematized their training programs for new employees. The National Association of Corporation Schools grew from 37 in 1913 to 146 in 1920. Starting in the 1880s, private schools opened across the country which offered specialized technical training to anyone who enrolled, not just the employees of one company. Starting in Milwaukee in 1907, public schools began opening free vocational programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Millikan|title=A Union Against Unions: The Minneapolis Citizens Alliance and Its Fight Against Organized Labor, 1903–1947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GseChEHIysAC&amp;pg=PA60|year=2003|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society Press|pages=60–61|isbn=978-0-87351-499-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a third of the American population lived in cities of 100,000 or more population In 1920; to reach the rest, correspondence techniques had to be adopted. Australia, with its vast distances, was especially active; the [[University of Queensland]] established its Department of Correspondence Studies in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/0158791820030207 |title=Distance education in Australian higher education — a history |journal=Distance Education |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=255–78 |year=2009 |last1=White |first1=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, the [[University of South Africa]], formerly an examining and certification body, started to present distance education tuition in 1946.

=== Open universities ===
[[File:Walton Hall Pen&amp;Ink.jpg|thumb|[[Walton Hall, Milton Keynes|Walton Hall]], renovated in 1970 to act as the headquarters of the newly established [[Open University]]. ''(Artist: Hilary French)'']]
The [[Open University]] in the United Kingdom was founded by the-then [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government led by Prime Minister, [[Harold Wilson]], based on the vision of [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]]. Planning commenced in 1965 under the [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Minister of State for Education]], [[Jennie Lee, Baroness Lee of Asheridge|Jennie Lee]], who established a model for the Open University (OU) as one of widening access to the highest standards of scholarship in higher education, and set up a planning committee consisting of university vice-chancellors, educationalists and television broadcasters, chaired by Sir Peter Venables. The British Broadcasting Corporation ([[BBC]]) Assistant Director of Engineering at the time, [[James Redmond (broadcaster)|James Redmond]], had obtained most of his qualifications at [[wikt:night school|night school]], and his natural enthusiasm for the project did much to overcome the technical difficulties of using television to broadcast teaching programmes.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Open University revolutionised the scope of the correspondence program and helped to create a respectable learning alternative to the traditional form of education. It has been at the forefront of developing new technologies to improve the distance learning service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Distance Education|author=Bizhan Nasseh|url=http://www.seniornet.org/edu/art/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as undertaking research in other disciplines. [[Walter Perry]] was appointed the OU's first vice-chancellor in January 1969, and its foundation secretary was [[Anastasios Christodoulou]]. The election of the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government under the leadership of [[Edward Heath]], in 1970; led to budget cuts under [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Iain Macleod]] (who had earlier called the idea of an Open University "blithering nonsense").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/about/ou/p3.shtml|title=The OU story|first=|last=admin|date=12 March 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the OU accepted its first 25,000 students in 1971, adopting a radical open admissions policy. At the time, the total student population of conventional universities in the United Kingdom was around 130,000.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

[[Athabasca University]], Canada's Open University, was created in 1970 and followed a similar, though independently developed, pattern.&lt;ref name="byrne"&gt;{{cite book | last =Byrne | first =T.

Most [[open universities]] use distance education technologies as delivery methods, though some require attendance at local study centres or at regional "summer schools". Some open universities have grown to become ''mega-universities'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Daniel | first1 = Sir John S |title= Mega-Universities and Knowledge Media: Technology Strategies for Higher Education | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Sy3nDKphDAkC | accessdate=2011-01-23 |year=1998 | publisher= Routledge | isbn= 0-7494-2634-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term coined to denote institutions with more than 100,000 students.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Technologies ==
Internet technology has enabled many forms of distance learning through [[open educational resources]] and facilities such as [[Educational technology|e-learning]] and [[Massive open online course|MOOC]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. Although the expansion of the Internet blurs the boundaries, distance education technologies are divided into two modes of delivery: [[synchronous learning]] and [[asynchronous learning]].

In synchronous learning, all participants are "present" at the same time. In this regard, it resembles traditional classroom teaching methods despite the participants being located remotely. It requires a timetable to be organized. [[Web conferencing]], [[videoconferencing]], [[educational television]], [[instructional television]] are examples of synchronous technology, as are [[direct-broadcast satellite]] (DBS), [[internet radio]], [[live streaming]], [[telephone]], and [[web-based VoIP]].&lt;ref name="lever-duffy"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lever-Duffy |first1=Judy |last2= McDonald |first2= Jean B |others= Ana A.

Mizell | title= Teaching and Learning with Technology | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9wxKAAAAYAAJ | accessdate = 23 January 2011 | edition = 3rd |date=March 2007 | publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon | isbn=0-205-51191-0 | page=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Web conferencing software helps to facilitate meetings in distance learning courses and usually contain additional interaction tools such as text chat, polls, hand raising, emoticons etc. These tools also support asynchronous participation by students being able to listen to recordings of synchronous sessions. Immersive environments (notably SecondLife) have also been used to enhance participant presence in distance education courses. Another form of synchronous learning that has been entering the classroom over the last couple of years is the use of robot proxies&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Robbie. (2013). A Swiveling Proxy That Will Even Wear a Tutu. ''New York Times.'' Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/08/education/for-homebound-students-a-robot-proxy-in-the-classroom.html&lt;/ref&gt; including those that allow sick students to attend classes.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Regan. (2015). "Robot brings classroom to sick students'' Retrieved from http://www.norwichbulletin.com/article/20141109/NEWS/141109566?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0&lt;nowiki/&gt;''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some universities have been starting to use robot proxies to enable more engaging synchronous hybrid classes where both remote and in person students can be present and interact using [[telerobotics]] devices such as the Kubi Telepresence robot stand that looks around and the Double Robot that roams around. With these telepresence robots, the remote students have a seat at the table or desk instead of being on a screen on the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://designstudio.educ.msu.edu/from-a-spot-on-the-wall-to-a-seat-at-the-table/|title=From a Spot on the Wall to a Seat at the Table  – CEPSE/COE Design Studio|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leila Meyer. (2015). "Michigan State Tests Telepresence Robots for Online Students" Retrieved from https://campustechnology.com/articles/2015/02/24/michigan-state-tests-telepresence-robots-for-online-students.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

In asynchronous learning, participants access course materials flexibly on their own schedules. Students are not required to be together at the same time. Mail correspondence, which is the oldest form of distance education, is an asynchronous delivery technology, as are [[message board]] forums, [[e-mail]], [[video]] and [[audio recording]]s, print materials, [[voicemail]], and [[fax]].&lt;ref name="lever-duffy" /&gt;

The two methods can be combined. Many courses offered by both open universities and an increasing number of campus based institutions use periodic sessions of residential or day teaching to supplement the sessions delivered at a distance.&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burns |first1=Mary | title= Distance Education for Teacher Training: Modes, Models and Methods | url= http://go.edc.org/07xd | accessdate = 10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of mixed distance and campus based education has recently come to be called "[[blended learning]]" or less often "hybrid learning". Many open universities uses a blend of technologies and a blend of learning modalities (face-to-face, distance, and hybrid) all under the rubric of "distance learning".

Distance learning can also use interactive radio instruction (IRI), interactive audio instruction (IAI), online [[virtual world]]s, digital games, webinars, and webcasts, all of which are referred to as e-Learning.&lt;ref name="Burns" /&gt;

The rapid spread of film in the 1920s and radio in the 1930s led to proposals to use it for distance education.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Cuban. (1986). ''Teachers and Machines: The Classroom Use of Technology Since 1920'', pp&amp;nbsp;11–18 [https://books.google.com/books?id=uQeEn1vEUSQC online]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1938, at least 200 city school systems, 25 state boards of education, and many colleges and universities broadcast educational programs for the public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tyson | first1 = Levering | year = 1936 | title = Ten Years of Educational Broadcasting | url = | journal = School and Society | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 225–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One line of thought was to use radio as a master teacher.
{{quote|Experts in given fields broadcast lessons for pupils within the many schoolrooms of the public school system, asking questions, suggesting readings, making assignments, and conducting tests.

''Community Backgrounds of Education: A Textbook and Educational Sociology'', pp&amp;nbsp;249–250&lt;/ref&gt;}}
A typical setup came in Kentucky in 1948 when [[John Wilkinson Taylor (educator)|John Wilkinson Taylor]], president of the [[University of Louisville]], teamed up with [[National Broadcasting Corporation|NBC]] to use radio as a medium for distance education, The chairman of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] endorsed the project and predicted that the "college-by-radio" would put "American education 25&amp;nbsp;years ahead". The University was owned by the city, and local residents would pay the low tuition rates, receive their study materials in the mail, and listen by radio to live classroom discussions that were held on campus.&lt;ref&gt;Dwayne D. Cox and William J. Morison. (1999). ''The University of Louisville'', pp&amp;nbsp;115–117&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist [[Daniel Q. Posin]] also was a pioneer in the field of distance education when he hosted a televised course through [[DePaul University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vyse|first1=Stuart|title=Before Carl Sagan and Neil deGrasse Tyson, There Was Dan Q.

[[Charles Wedemeyer]] of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] also promoted new methods. From 1964 to 1968, the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] funded Wedemeyer's ''Articulated Instructional Media Project'' (AIM) which brought in a variety of communications technologies aimed at providing learning to an off-campus population. The radio courses faded away in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Cuban. (1986). ''Teachers and Machines: The Classroom Use of Technology Since 1920'', pp&amp;nbsp;19–26&lt;/ref&gt; Many efforts to use television along the same lines proved unsuccessful, despite heavy funding by the [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christopher H.

From 1970 to 1972 the Coordinating Commission for Higher Education in California funded Project Outreach to study the potential of telecourses. The study included the [[University of California]], [[California State University]] and the community colleges. This study led to coordinated instructional systems legislation allowing the use of public funds for non-classroom instruction and paved the way for the emergence of telecourses as the precursor to the online courses and programs of today. The [[Coastline Community College]]s, The [[Dallas County Community College District]], and [[Miami Dade Community College]] led the way. The ''Adult Learning Service'' of the US [[Public Broadcasting Service]] came into being and the “wrapped” series, and individually produced telecourse for credit became a significant part of the history of distance education and online learning.

However, many of the techniques developed and lessons learned with earlier media are used in Internet delivery.

The first completely online courses for graduate credit were offered by [[Connected Education]], starting in the Fall of 1985, leading to the MA in Media Studies from [[The New School]].&lt;ref name="Netweaver"&gt;{{cite  web | url=http://cgi.gjhost.com/~cgi/mt/netweaverarchive/000144.html | title=Connected Education, Inc. | author=Gail S.

The first new and fully online university was founded in 1994 as the [[Open University of Catalonia]], headquartered in Barcelona, Spain. In 1999 [[Jones International University]] was launched as the first fully online university [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by a regional accrediting association in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Accreditation|url = http://www.jiu.edu/about-jiu/accreditation|publisher = Jones International University|location = US|accessdate = 23 January 2011|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130421085153/http://www.jiu.edu/about-jiu/accreditation|archivedate = 21 April 2013|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jiu.edu/about-jiu/our-history}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Between 2000 and 2008, enrollment in distance education courses increased rapidly in almost every country in both developed and developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Walton Radford, MPR Associates |first=Alexandria |format=PDF |title=Learning at a Distance: Undergraduate Enrollment in Distance Education Courses and Degree Programs |url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2012/2012154.pdf |publisher=National Center for Education Statistics |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many private, public, [[non-profit]] and for-profit institutions worldwide now offer distance education courses from the most basic instruction through to the highest levels of degree and doctoral programs. [[New York University]], [https://iuc-edu.ca/ International University Canada], for example, offers [[online degree]]s in engineering and management-related fields through [[NYU Tandon Online]]. Levels of accreditation vary: widely respected universities such as Stanford University and Harvard now deliver online courses—but other online schools receive little outside oversight, and some are actually fraudulent, i.e., [[diploma mill]]s. In the US, the [[Distance Education Accrediting Commission]] (DEAC) specializes in the accreditation of distance education institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.deac.org/accred.html |title=Accreditation |publisher=DEAC |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States in 2011, it was found that a third of all the students enrolled in postsecondary education had taken an accredited online course in a postsecondary institution.&lt;ref name="Lederman2"&gt;{{cite news|last = Lederman|first = Doug|title = Growth for Online Learning|url = http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/01/08/survey-finds-online-enrollments-slow-continue-grow|accessdate = 30 March 2013|newspaper = InsideHigherEd|date = 8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though growth rates are slowing, enrollment for online courses has been seen to increase with the advance in technology.

Distance education has a long history, but its popularity and use has grown exponentially as more advanced technology has become available. By 2008, online learning programs were available in the United States in 44 states at the K-12 level.&lt;ref&gt;Olszewski-Kubilius, Paula; Corwith, Susan. "Distance Education: Where It Started and Where It Stands for Gifted Children and Their Educators." Gifted Child Today, v. 34 issue 3, 2011, p. 16-24,.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Internet forum]]s, online [[discussion group]] and [[online learning community]] can contribute to an efficacious distance education experience. Research shows that [[socialization]] plays an important role in some forms of distance education.&lt;ref name="SRE4(13)2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.09.199 |title=Alleviating the Senses of Isolation and Alienation in the Virtual World: Socialization in Distance Education |journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences |volume=93 |pages=332–7 |year=2013 |last1=Sazmandasfaranjan |first1=Yasha |last2=Shirzad |first2=Farzad |last3=Baradari |first3=Fatemeh |last4=Salimi |first4=Meysam |last5=Salehi |first5=Mehrdad }}&lt;/ref&gt;

E-courses are also a viable option for distance learning.  There are many available that cover a broad range of topics.

== Paced and self paced models ==
Distance education can be delivered in a paced format similar to traditional campus based models in which learners commence and complete a course at the same time. Paced delivery is currently the most common mode of distance education delivery. Alternatively, some institutions offer self-paced programs that allow for continuous enrollment and the length of time to complete the course is set by the learner's time, skill and commitment levels. Paced courses may be offered in either synchronus mode, but self-paced courses are almost always offered asynchronously. Each delivery model offers both advantages and disadvantages for students, teachers and institutions.

[[Andreas Kaplan|Kaplan]] and Haenlein classify distance education into four groups along the dimensions Time dependency and Number of participants: 1) [[MOOCs]] (Massive Open Online Courses): Open-access online course (i.e., without specific participation restrictions) that allows for unlimited (massive) participation; 2) [[Small private online course|SPOCs]] (Small Private Online Courses): Online course that only offers a limited number of places and therefore requires some form of formal enrollment; 3) SMOCs (Synchronous Massive Online Courses): Open-access online course that allows for unlimited participation but requires students to be "present" at the same time (synchronously); 4) SSOCs (Synchronous Private Online Courses): Online course that only offers a limited number of places and requires students to be "present" at the same time (synchronously).&lt;ref name="Kaplan Haenlein 2016"/&gt;

Paced models are a familiar mode as they are used almost exclusively in campus based schools. Institutes that offer both distance and campus programs usually use paced models as teacher workload, student semester planning, tuition deadlines, exam schedules and other administrative details can be synchronized with campus delivery. Student familiarity and the pressure of deadlines encourages students to readily adapt to and usually succeed in paced models. However, student freedom is sacrificed as a common pace is often too fast for some students and too slow for others. In addition life events, professional or family responsibilities can interfere with a students capability to complete tasks to an external schedule. Finally, paced models allows students to readily form communities of inquiry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://coi.athabascau.ca|title = Community of Inquiry site|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Athabasca University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to engage in collaborative work.

Self-paced courses maximize student freedom, as not only can students commence studies on any date, but they can complete a course in as little time as a few weeks or up to a year or longer. Students often enroll in self-paced study when they are under pressure to complete programs, have not been able to complete a scheduled course, need additional courses or have pressure which precludes regular study for any length of time. The self-paced nature of the programming, though is an unfamiliar model for many students and can lead to excessive procrastination resulting in course incompletion. Assessment of learning can also be challenging as exams can be written on any day, making it possible for students to share examination questions with resulting loss of academic integrity. Finally, it is extremely challenging to organize collaborative work activities, though some schools&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Teaching Crowds: Learning and Social Media|last = Dron|first = Jon|publisher = AU Press|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Anderson|first2 = Terry}}&lt;/ref&gt; are developing cooperative models based upon networked and connectivist pedagogies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.19173/irrodl.v12i3.890 |title=Three generations of distance education pedagogy	|journal=The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=80–97 |year=2011 |last1=Anderson |first1=Terry |last2=Dron |first2=Jon }}&lt;/ref&gt; for use in self-paced programs.

== Benefits ==
Distance learning can expand access to education and training for both general populace and businesses since its flexible scheduling structure lessens the effects of the many time-constraints imposed by personal responsibilities and commitments.&lt;ref name=Oblinger&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oblinger |first=Diana G. |year=2000 |title=The Nature and Purpose of Distance Education |journal=The Technology Source |volume= |series=|issue=March/April |page= |pages= |publisher=Michigan Virtual University |location=Michigan |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode=|oclc=|id=|url=http://technologysource.org/article/nature_and_purpose_of_distance_education/ |language= |format=|accessdate=23 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Devolving some activities off-site alleviates institutional capacity constraints arising from the traditional demand on institutional buildings and infrastructure.&lt;ref name=Oblinger /&gt; Furthermore, there is the potential for increased access to more experts in the field and to other students from diverse geographical, social, cultural, economic, and experiential backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Maggio, L. M. 20012" /&gt;
As the population at large becomes more involved in [[lifelong learning]] beyond the normal schooling age, institutions can benefit financially, and adult learning business courses may be particularly lucrative.&lt;ref name=Oblinger /&gt; Distance education programs can act as a catalyst for institutional innovation&lt;ref name=Oblinger /&gt; and are at least as effective as face-to-face learning programs,&lt;ref name="Blackmore, C. 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jedlicka, J. S. 20022" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nguyen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nguyen|first1=Tuan|title=The Effectiveness of Online Learning: Beyond No Significant Difference and Future Horizons|journal=MERLOT Journal of Online Learning and Teaching|date=June 2015|volume=11|issue=2|pages=309–319|url=http://jolt.merlot.org/Vol11no2/Nguyen_0615.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially if the instructor is knowledgeable and skilled.&lt;ref name="Orr, P. 20102" /&gt;

Distance education can also provide a broader method of communication within the realm of education. With the many tools and programs that technological advancements have to offer, communication appears to increase in distance education amongst students and their professors, as well as students and their classmates. The distance educational increase in communication, particularly communication amongst students and their classmates, is an improvement that has been made to provide distance education students with as many of the opportunities as possible as they would receive in in-person education. The improvement being made in distance education is growing in tandem with the constant technological advancements. Present-day online communication allows students to associate with accredited schools and programs throughout the world that are out of reach for in-person learning. By having the opportunity to be involved in global institutions via distance education, a diverse array of thought is presented to students through communication with their classmates. This is beneficial because students have the opportunity to "combine new opinions with their own, and develop a solid foundation for learning".&lt;ref name="calpoly1"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Educational Benefits of Online Learning|pages=1–6|year=1998|url=http://blackboardsupport.calpoly.edu/content/faculty/handouts/Ben_Online.pdf|publisher=CalPoly.edu |accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown through research that "as learners become aware of the variations in interpretation and construction of meaning among a range of people [they] construct an individual meaning", which can help students become knowledgeable of a wide array of viewpoints in education.&lt;ref name="calpoly1" /&gt; To increase the likelihood that students will build effective ties with one another during the course, instructors should use similar assignments for students across different locations to overcome the influence of co-location on relationship building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00308.x |title=Homophily of Network Ties and Bonding and Bridging Social Capital in Computer-Mediated Distributed Teams |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=1062–84 |year=2006 |last1=Yuan |first1=Y. Connie |last2=Gay |first2=Geri }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high cost of education affects students in higher education, to which distance education may be an alternative in order to provide some relief.&lt;ref name=Nguyen /&gt; Distance education has been a more cost-effective form of learning, and can sometimes save students a significant amount of money as opposed to traditional education. Distance education may be able to help to save students a considerable amount financially by removing the cost of transportation.&lt;ref name="worldwidelearn2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidelearn.com/education-articles/benefits-of-online-learning.htm |title=Benefits of Online Education |publisher=Worldwidelearn.com |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, distance education may be able to save students from the economic burden of high-priced course textbooks. Many textbooks are now available as electronic textbooks, known as e-textbooks, which can offer digital textbooks for a reduced price in comparison to traditional textbooks. Also, the increasing improvements in technology have resulted in many school libraries having a partnership with digital publishers that offer course materials for free, which can help students significantly with educational costs.&lt;ref name="worldwidelearn2013" /&gt;

Within the class, students are able to learn in ways that traditional classrooms would not be able to provide. It is able to promote good learning experiences and therefore, allow students to obtain higher satisfaction with their online learning.&lt;ref name=Kirtman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirtman|first=Lisa|title=Online Versus In-Class Courses: An Examination of Differences in Learning Outcomes|journal=Issues in Teacher Education|date=Fall 2009|volume=18|issue=2|pages=103–115|url=http://www1.chapman.edu/ITE/public_html/ITEFall09/12kirtman.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, students can review their lessons more than once according to their need. Students can then manipulate the coursework to fit their learning by focusing more on their weaker topics while breezing through concepts that they already have or can easily grasp.&lt;ref name=Kirtman /&gt; When course design and the [[learning environment]] are at their optimal conditions, distance education can lead students to higher satisfaction with their learning experiences.&lt;ref name=Nguyen /&gt; Studies have shown that high satisfaction correlates to increased learning. For those in a healthcare or mental health distance learning program, online-based interactions have the potential to foster deeper reflections and discussions of client issues&lt;ref name="Stanton, S. 20012" /&gt; as well as a quicker response to client issues, since supervision happens on a regular basis and is not limited to a weekly supervision meeting.&lt;ref name="Stebnicki, M. A. 20012" /&gt; This also may contribute to the students feeling a greater sense of support, since they have ongoing and regular access to their instructors and other students.&lt;ref name="Stanton, S. 20012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stebnicki, M. A. 20012" /&gt;

Distance learning may enable students who are unable to attend a traditional school setting, due to [[disability]] or illness such as decreased mobility and immune system suppression, to get a good education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Exploration of the Representation of Students with Disabilities in Distance Education|url=http://www.westga.edu/~distance/ojdla/winter144/woods_maiden_brandes144.html|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children who are sick or are unable to attend classes are able to attend them in "person" through the use of [[robot]] proxies. This helps the students have experiences of the classroom and social interaction that they are unable to receive at home or the hospital, while still keeping them in a safe learning environment. Over the last few years{{When|date=July 2016}} more students are entering safely back into the classroom thanks to the help of robots. An article from the ''New York Times'', "A Swiveling Proxy Will Even Wear a Tutu", explains the positive impact of virtual learning in the classroom,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Robbie. (2013).

(2014). Robot brings classroom to sick students. ''Norwich Bulletin.''http://www.norwichbulletin.com/article/20141109/NEWS/141109566&lt;/ref&gt;
Distance education may provide equal access regardless of socioeconomic status or income, area of residence, gender, race, age, or cost per student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://madamenoire.com/105928/cyber-charter-schools-the-end-of-public-education-or-a-new-beginning |title=Cyber-charter Schools: The end of Public Education or a New Beginning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applying [[universal design]] strategies to distance learning courses as they are being developed (rather than instituting accommodations for specific students on an as-needed basis) can increase the [[accessibility]] of such courses to students with a range of abilities, disabilities, learning styles, and native languages.&lt;ref&gt;Burgstahler, S.,{{cite web |url=http://www.washington.edu/doit/Brochures/Technology/equal_access_uddl.html |title=Equal Access: Universal Design of Distance Learning |accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Distance education graduates, who would never have been associated with the school under a traditional system, may donate money to the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/01930826.2010.488597 |title=Untapped Potential: Seeking Library Donors among Alumni of Distance Learning Programs |journal=Journal of Library Administration |volume=50 |issue=5–6 |pages=515–29 |year=2010 |last1=Casey |first1=Anne Marie |last2=Lorenzen |first2=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distance learning may also offer a final opportunity for adolescents that are no longer permitted in the general education population due to behavior disorders. Instead of these students having no other academic opportunities, they may continue their education from their homes and earn their diplomas, offering them another chance to be an integral part of society.

Distance Learning offers individuals a unique opportunity to benefit from the expertise and resources of the best Universities currently available. Students have the ability to collaborate, share, question, infer and suggest new methods and techniques for continuous improvement of the content. The ability to complete a course at a t pace that is appropriate for each individual is the most effective manner to learn given the personal demands on time and schedule. Self-paced distance learning on a mobile device such is a smartphone provides maximum flexibility and capability.

== Criticism ==
Barriers to effective distance education include obstacles such as domestic distractions and unreliable technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Östlund|first=Berit|title=Stress, disruption and community&amp;nbsp;— Adult learners' experiences of obstacles and opportunities in distance education|url=http://www.eurodl.org/index.php?p=&amp;sp=full&amp;article=179|publisher=Department of Child and Youth Education, Special Education and Counselling, Umeå University|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as students' program costs, adequate contact with teachers and support services, and a need for more experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jill M. |last=Galusha |title=Barriers to Learning in Distance Education |url=http://www.infrastruction.com/barriers.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000229041104/http://www.infrastruction.com/barriers.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 February 2000 |accessdate=10 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some students attempt to participate in distance education without proper training with the tools needed to be successful in the program. Students must be provided with training opportunities (if needed) on each tool that is used throughout the program. The lack of advanced technology skills can lead to an unsuccessful experience. Schools have a responsibility to adopt a proactive policy for managing technology barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stephens |first=D. |date=July 2007 |title=Quality issues in distance learning |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/whitepapers/quality-issues-distance-learning.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601203911/http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/whitepapers/quality-issues-distance-learning.pdf |archivedate=1 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Time management skills and self-discipline in distance education is just as important as complete knowledge of the software and tools being used for learning.

The results of a study of Washington state community college students showed that distance learning students tended to drop out more often than their traditional counterparts due to difficulties in language, time management, and study skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/publications/online-hybrid-courses-washington.html?UID=872|title=Online and Hybrid Course Enrollment and Performance in Washington State Community and Technical Colleges|first=|last=Gabriel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Pankaj Singhm, director of [[NIMS University|Nims University]], "distance learning benefits may outweigh the disadvantages for students in such a technology-driven society; however before indulging into use of [[educational technology]] a few more disadvantages should be considered." He describes that over multiple years, "all of the obstacles have been overcome and the world environment for distance education continues to improve." Dr. Pankaj Singhm also claims there is a debate to distance education stating, "due to a lack of direct face-to-face social interaction. However, as more people become used to personal and social interaction online (for example dating, chat rooms, shopping, or blogging), it is becoming easier for learners to both project themselves and socialize with others. This is an obstacle that has dissipated."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scdl.net/InternationalConference/PDFS/DigitalProceeding/Full%20paper%20Pankaj%20Singh.pdf|title=Unleashing the potential of ODL - "Reaching the unreached"|last=|first=|date=24 January 2018|website=Symbiosis Center for Distance Learning|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all courses required to complete a degree may be offered online. Health care profession programs in particular, require some sort of patient interaction through field work before a student may graduate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.distancelearningnet.com/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-distance-learning/&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also shown that students pursuing a medical professional graduate degree who are participating in distance education courses, favor face to face communication over professor-mediated chat rooms and/or independent studies. However, this is little correlation between student performance when comparing the previous different distance learning strategies.&lt;ref name="Jedlicka, J. S. 20022" /&gt;

There is a theoretical problem about the application of traditional teaching methods to online courses because online courses may have no upper size limit. [[Daniel Barwick]] noted that there is no evidence that large class size is always worse or that small class size is always better, although a negative link has been established between certain types of instruction in large classes and learning outcomes; he argued that higher education has not made a sufficient effort to experiment with a variety of instructional methods to determine whether large class size is always negatively correlated with a reduction in learning outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barwick |first=Daniel W.|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2007/12/06/barwick |title=Views: Does Class Size Matter? |publisher=Inside Higher Ed |accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early proponents of Massive Open Online Courses ([[MOOC]])s saw them as just the type of experiment that Barwick had pointed out was lacking in higher education, although Barwick himself has never advocated for [[Massive open online course|MOOCs]].

There may also be institutional challenges. Distance learning is new enough that it may be a challenge to gain support for these programs in a traditional brick-and-mortar academic learning environment.&lt;ref name="Stanton, S. 20012" /&gt; Furthermore, it may be more difficult for the instructor to organize and plan a distance learning program,&lt;ref name="Stebnicki, M. A. 20012" /&gt; especially since many are new programs and their organizational needs are different from a traditional learning program.

Additionally, though distance education offers industrial countries the opportunity to become globally informed, there are still negative sides to it. Hellman states that "These include its cost and capital intensiveness, time constraints and other pressures on instructors, the isolation of students from instructors and their peers, instructors’ enormous difficulty in adequately evaluating students they never meet face-to-face, and drop-out rates far higher than in classroom-based courses."&lt;ref name="Hellman, Judith Adler 2003"&gt;Hellman, Judith Adler. "The Riddle of Distance Education." Geneva. 1 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more complex challenge of distance education relates to cultural differences between student and teachers and among students. Distance programmes tend to be more diverse as they could go beyond the geographical borders of regions, countries, and continents, and cross the cultural borders that may exist with respect to race, gender, and religion. That requires a proper understanding and awareness of the norms, differences, preconceptions and potential conflicting issues.&lt;ref name="Nasiri et Mafakheri"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/03075079.2014.914906 |title=Postgraduate research supervision at a distance: A review of challenges and strategies |journal=Studies in Higher Education |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1962–9 |year=2014 |last1=Nasiri |first1=Fuzhan |last2=Mafakheri |first2=Fereshteh }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Educational technology ==
The modern use of electronic [[educational technology]] (also called e-learning) facilitates distance learning and independent learning by the extensive use of [[information and communications technology]] (ICT), replacing traditional content delivery by postal correspondence. Instruction can be synchronous and asynchronous online communication in an interactive learning environment or virtual communities, in lieu of a physical classroom. "The focus is shifted to the education transaction in the form of virtual community of learners sustainable across time."&lt;ref&gt;Garrison, D.R. (2011, 20 May).

One of the most significant issues encountered in the mainstream correspondence model of distance education is transactional distance, which results from the lack of appropriate communication between learner and teacher. This gap has been observed to become wider if there is no communication between the learner and teacher and has direct implications over the learning process and future endeavors in distance education. Distance education providers began to introduce various strategies, techniques, and procedures to increase the amount of interaction between learner and teacher. These measures e.g. more frequent face-to-face tutorials, increased use of information and communication technologies including teleconferencing and the Internet, were designed to close the gap in transactional distance.&lt;ref&gt;Soekartawi, Haryono, A. &amp; Librero, F. 2002.

== Credentials ==
{{Main|Online credentials for learning}}

Online credentials for learning&amp;nbsp;are digital credentials that are offered in place of traditional paper credentials for a skill or educational achievement. Directly linked to the accelerated development of internet communication technologies, the development of&amp;nbsp;[[digital badge]]s,&amp;nbsp;[[electronic passport]]s&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[massive open online course]]s&amp;nbsp;(MOOCs) have a very direct bearing on our understanding of learning, recognition and levels as they pose a direct challenge to the status quo. It is useful to distinguish between three forms of online credentials: Test-based credentials, online badges, and online certificates.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002428/242887e.pdf|title=Level-setting and recognition of learning outcomes: The use of level descriptors in the twenty-first century|last=Keevy|first=James|last2=Chakroun|first2=Borhene|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100138-3|location=|pages=129–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Historical records not only from the travels of [[Johann Ludwig Krapf]] and [[Johannes Rebmann]] reveal that Kenyans had access to education as far back as 1728 with a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] manuscript ''[[Utendi wa Tambuka]]'' (Book of Heraclius) attesting to the fact. The CMS missionaries interacted with locals in the coastal town of [[Mombasa]] and set up one of the earliest mission schools in the country at [[Rabai]] in 1846.

With the expansion of the railway from Mombasa to Uganda, the missionaries expanded their work into Kenya's interior. An attempt to set up a school and mission at Yatta in 1894 was resisted by the [[Kamba people|Kamba]] tribe. The missionaries then penetrated into western Kenya and set up schools and missions. The first school in western Kenya was established at Kaimosi in 1902. During the colonial era, the number of Kenyans with exposure to education steadily increased and a good number of them were privileged to proceed abroad for further education.

Among those who furthered their education abroad in the colonial era were [[Jomo Kenyatta]], who attended [[Woodbrooke College]] and [[London School of Economics]], [[Charles Njonjo]], who attended [[Grays Inn]] Law School, [[Peter Mbiyu Koinange]], who attended [[Columbia University]], [[Mwai Kibaki]] who attended London School of Economics, [[R. Mugo Gatheru]] who attended [[Roosevelt University]], [[Tom Mboya]], who attended [[Ruskin College, Oxford]], [[Masinde Muliro]], who attended [[University of Cape Town]], Julius Gikonyo Kiano who attended [[Stanford University]], [[Paul Ngei]] and [[Barack Obama Sr.]], who attended the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]].

Julius Gikonyo Kiano was the first Kenyan to obtain a PhD. He returned to Kenya and was instrumental in establishing a school in Githunguri. The trend steadily rose over the years and by the time of independence in 1963, 840,000 African children were attending elementary school.

=== Pre and post colonial education Systems ===

[[File:Kenya class.jpg|thumb|300px|A classroom in [[Athi River]], Kenya.]]

Kenya began a campaign for free primary education after independence in 1963. Since then, the system of education has undergone transformation twice. Before independence elementary education was based on the colonial system of education.

==== East African Community (7–4–2–3 System) ====
In 1967, Kenya, with Uganda and Tanzania, formed the [[East African Community]]. The three countries adopted a single system of education, the 7–4–2–3, which consisted of 7 years of primary education, 4 years of secondary education, 2 years of high school and 3–5 years of university education. Under the system, which was similar to the British system of education, children began their elementary (primary) education at the age of 7 and completed at the age of 13 after sitting for a regional examination known as the East African Certificate of Primary Education (EACPE).

After primary education those who passed very well proceeded to secondary school which ended four years later with the writing of the East African Certificate of Education examination (EACE). The highest level of education that qualified one to attend university was attained after two years of high school at that time distinct from secondary school with students sitting for the East African Advanced Certificate of Education (EAACE).

==== Kenya 7–4–2–3 System ====
With the collapse of the East African community in 1977, Kenya continued with the same system of education but changed the examination names from their regional identity to a national identity. The East African Certificate of Primary Education became the Certificate of Primary Education (CPE), the first time the C.P.E was marked by a computer system,  the East African Certificate of Education became the Kenya Certificate of Education (KCE) and the East African Advanced Certificate of Education became the Kenya Advanced Certificate of Education (KACE).

==== 8–4–4 Curriculum ====
{{main article|8-4-4 Curriculum}}
In 1985 President [[Daniel arap Moi]], introduced the 8–4–4 system of education, which adopted 8 years of primary education, 4 years of secondary education and 4 years of university education. With the introduction of the 8–4–4 system CPE became KCPE ([[Kenya Certificate of Primary Education]]) while KCE became the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE).

Since 1985, public education in Kenya has been based on an 8–4–4 system,&lt;ref name="ferre"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Ferre | first=Celine |date=February 2009 | title=Age at First Child: Does Education Delay Fertility Timing?

To date, there has been steady growth in the advancement of education in the country. the country boasts of a great number of public and private universities as well as middle-level colleges.

Some private schools, however, offer a system of education similar to the British system of education with ordinary level exams, "O-levels" taken at the end of 4 years of secondary school and advanced levels "A-levels", taken after two years of high school.

=== Transition rates and Overall Performance ===
Out of all children in Kenya about 85 percent attend primary school. 75 percent of those who complete primary education proceed to secondary schools and 60 percent of those who complete secondary school proceed to higher institutions of education which include business and vocational institutions, national polytechnics, public and private universities within the country. Over 950,000 Kenyans have furthered their education abroad with a majority of graduates from India, UK, Canada, the United States, Russia and Uganda.

== Education quality ==

Education quality has recently received a lot of attention in Kenya. The government's main document in this effort, the Kenya Education Sector Support Programme for 2005–2010, established the National Assessment Centre (NAC) to monitor learning achievement. In 2010, the NAC released the results of its first assessment.

In 2009, in collaboration with the NAC, [http://uwezo.net/index.php?c=62 Uwezo Kenya] conducted an assessment of the basic literacy and numeracy skills of children ages 6–16. The Annual Learning Assessment (ALA) reached villages in 70 out of 158 districts in Kenya and assessed nearly 70,000 children in their homes. The ALA was set at a Standard 2 level, which is the level where students are supposed to achieve basic competency in reading English and Kiswahili and complete simple arithmetic problems. The chart below shows the percent of children who could not read a Standard 2 level paragraph or solve Standard 2 level subtraction problems:&lt;ref&gt;http://uwezo.net/index.php?c=67&lt;/ref&gt;

Key findings about education in Kenya, based on the results of the Uwezo 2009 assessment:&lt;ref&gt;http://uwezo.net/index.php?i=68&lt;/ref&gt;

# Literacy levels are low, and are substantially lower in certain regions. Girls tend to perform better in reading English and Kiswahili, while boys tend to perform better in math.
# Literacy levels are lower in public schools than private schools.
# Most children can solve real world, "ethno-mathematics" problems, while fewer can solve similar math problems in an abstract, pencil and paper format.
# 5% of children are not enrolled in school, but the problem is far worse in particular regions.
# About half of children are enrolled in pre-school.
# Many children are older than expected for their class level, including 40% of children in class 2, and 60% of children in class 7.
# North Eastern Province and arid districts in Rift Valley and Eastern Provinces have particularly low performance; and many older children, especially girls, are not attending school.
# Many families pay for extra tuition, which focuses heavily on drilling and exam preparation.
# Schools struggle to plan their budgets because they receive funds at unpredictable times.
# Children whose mothers are educated, particularly beyond primary school, tend to have much higher rates of literacy and numeracy.
# About 15% of students are absent on a given day, with much higher absenteeism in certain districts as a result of increased poverty level.
# There is a severe shortage of teachers, estimated at 4 teachers per school.
# The reluctance of the government to invest in educational institutions in marginalised areas thereby developing schools in cities only which result in inefficient education process in arid and semi-arid areas
# embezzlement of public funds by school administrators and lack of accountability of the use of government grants and high levels of corruption in educational institutions

== Primary education ==

Primary education in Kenya begins at the age of 5 to 7 after completion of a year of kindergarten commonly known as Nursery School or pre-unit. The first class or year of primary school is known as Standard 1, the final year as Standard 8 and primary school children are known as pupils. The school year at both primary and secondary levels, begins in January and ends in November. Students get 3 school vacations in April, August and December.

At the end of the school year students advance to the next grade.Since repetition was banned students still progress to the next grade even though they fail their examinations. Most primary schools are day schools with pupils living at home. Fewer schools at primary level are boarding schools compared to secondary schools. All public primary school pupils sit for the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examination at the end of the school year in Standard eight. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} In primary school, students are taught English, Kiswahili and Indigenous language activities.&lt;ref name="BECF- KICD"&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic Education Curriculum Framework|url=https://www.kicd.ac.ke/images/downloads/CURRICULUMFRAMEWORK.pdf|website=Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development|publisher=Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2003 President [[Mwai Kibaki]] re-introduced free primary education which previously existed before the mid 80s when the government adopted cost sharing measures that led to a minor level of school fees charged by primary schools for text books, PTA, and extra curricular activities. Since 2003, education in public schools became free and compulsory ( Kenya Constitution,Article 53, 2010). On learning that primary education had once again become free in Kenya, [[Kimani Maruge]], an uneducated farmer and the world's oldest person to enroll in primary school joined Kapkenduiywo primary school in [[Eldoret]] at the age of 84. He was elected head boy at the age of 86 in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/1144021620/world-s-oldest-pupil-stephen-maruge-dies| title=World's oldest pupil, Stephen Maruge, dies| author=Kiplang’at Jeremiah| publisher=| date=15 August 2009| accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secondary education ==

Secondary schools in Kenya fall into three categories – government funded, harambee and private. Government funded schools are divided into national, provincial and district levels. Harambee schools do not receive full funding from the government and private schools are run by private organizations or individuals. After taking the primary school leaving exam and successfully passing, government funded schools select students in order of scores.

Students with the highest scores gain admission into national schools while those with average scores are selected into provincial and district schools. Harambee schools accept students with low scores. Students who fail their examinations pursue technical and vocational education. The latter is divided into technical secondary school (lasting 4 years) and apprenticeships solutions. Since 2010, technical secondary schools student can have access to university programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=World+TVET+Database&amp;ct=KEN | title=Vocational Education in Kenya | publisher=UNESCO-UNEVOC | date=November 2012 | accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of students also drop out of school by choice due to poor scores.

Under the current system, students attend secondary school for four years before sitting for the school leaving exam at the end of the fourth year. The first class or year of secondary school is known as form 1 and the final year is form 4. At the end of the fourth year, from October to November students sit for the [[Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education]] examination. In 2008, the government introduced plans to offer free Secondary education to all Kenyans.

Historic prestigious national high schools include [[Mang'u High School]], [[Alliance High School (Kenya)]] and [[Starehe Boys' Centre and School]]. Private secondary schools in Kenya are generally high cost, offering students an alternative system of education with better or more luxurious facilities compared to public schools. They are often favoured for prestige. Most private schools in Kenya offer the British system of education which includes "O-levels" and "A-levels". Very few offer the American system of education and good number of them offer the Kenya system. Some of the oldest private schools in Kenya include Loreto Convent Msongari, Nairobi (1921), [[St. Mary's School, Nairobi]], Braeburn School, Consolata School, [[Strathmore School]], [[Oshwal Academy]], [[Rift Valley Academy]], [[Aga Khan Academy]], Kenton College and [[Brookhouse School]],

The average grade is based on performance in the eight subjects. Where a candidate sits for more than eight subjects, the average grade is based on the best eight subjects. University matriculation is based on the best eight and performance in particular subjects relevant to degree courses.
Example below:

The total number of points is 82.

The average grade is 82 divided by 8, which equals 10.25 (approximately 10.0 points) which is Grade B+ according to the grading system. This student qualifies to join one of the Public Universities for his good score. Training institutions and faculties and departments determine their own minimum entry requirements.

Students who manage a grade of C+ qualify to do a degree course at the university. Owing to competition, and fewer places at the University, those with B and in a few cases B-, and above are taken for degree courses at the [[public university|public]] universities and benefit by paying government-subsidized fees. The rest join [[private university|private]] universities or middle-level colleges.

The number of students admitted to public universities through J.A.B. depends on the total number of beds available in all the public universities. Nonetheless, those who miss out but attained the minimum university entry mark of C+ or C with a relevant diploma certificate are admitted through the parallel degree programmes (module II) if they can afford the full fees for the course.

This has been the subject of much discussion with people questioning the rationale and morality of locking out qualified students from public institutions yet still admitting those who come from financially able families.

== Technical and Vocational Education and Training Institutions ==

These are two- or three-year post secondary school institutions also termed colleges. They award certificates, diplomas and higher national diplomas after successful completion of relevant courses. Courses offered by these institutions include Business Education, Accounting, Secretarial Studies, Nursing, Teacher Training, Computer Studies, Journalism, Media, Design, Culinary Studies, Foreign Languages, Tourism and Technical Skills. In order of credibility or accreditation, national polytechnics rank first, followed by government training institutes, teacher training colleges and private institutions. Although generally termed colleges, these institution do not award degrees. Degrees are only awarded by universities.

From July 2014, all government and private institutions offering Technical and Vocational Education and Training where put under  {{cite web |url=http://kenyalaw.org/kenya_gazette/gazette/volume/MTAyMw--/Vol.%20CXVI-No.%2060 |title=TVETA |access-date=10 October 2016}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvetauthority.go.ke/background-information/&lt;/ref&gt; this act normalized this sector as it had become tainted by unaccredited institutions offering substandard education as revealed by {{cite web |url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/m/story.php?articleID=1144017076&amp;story_title=move-to-weed-out-fake-colleges&amp;pageNo=2/ |title=The Standard }} and {{cite web |url=http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2015/12/02/blacklist-colleges-shut-down_c1252870|title=The Star |date=2 December 2015}} As of October 10, 2016 there were 540 isntitutions accredited by the Authority&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvetauthority.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/TVETA-Register.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government TVET Institutions==

== Factors affecting education in Kenya ==
{{multiple issues|section=yes|
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
{{external links|date=October 2015}}
}}
In 2003 the Kenyan government promised free primary education to its citizens. In the early 70s primary school fees were abolished but in the mid 80s cost-sharing measures between the government and its citizens led to the re-introduction of minor fee charges by primary schools. As the trend continued with schools requiring parents to pay fees such as PTA, harambee, textbooks, uniforms, caution fees, exam fees and extracurricular activity fees, most parents became overburdened and unable to raise such fees. Those who could not afford the money to pay for their children's school fees often had their children drop out of the school. Many children were also forced to drop out of school when teachers would not allow them to take exams. To pressurize parents to pay fees, schools often sent children home during the final exams.

The growth of Kenya's education sector has exceeded expectations. After the first university was established in 1970, six other public universities and 23 private universities have been established. Although Kenya has its own universities, some parents prefer to send their children to universities outside the country. This is largely because Kenyan public universities are not as flexible with admission requirements as some foreign universities. Another factor that has been pointed out is that youth with disabilities are facing major obstacles to progress in higher education, and measures as affirmative action or measures tailored to the needs of particular profiles of students could play a relevant role in this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00450|title=It also helped refine international approaches to the education of the disabled.

''' The Education in Oman''' is provided free of charge up to the end of [[secondary education]], though attendance is not mandatory at any level. In 1970 there were only three formal schools with 900 students in the whole country. [[Oman]]'s national educational program expanded rapidly during the 1970s and the 1980s. In 2006–2007 about 560,000 students attended 1053 public schools. The number of students in private schools is about 65,000. There are also extensive programmes to combat adult [[illiteracy]]. [[Sultan Qaboos University]], the only national university near [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], was founded in 1986, and in 2006 it had 13,500 students. The 2006 [[Human Development Report]] found the literacy rate to be 31.4% in adults, up from 54.7% in 1990.  For the same period, the youth  [[literacy rate]] increased from 85.6 to 97.3%. Public expenditure on education was reported to be 4.6% of [[GDP]] and 26.1% of total government spending.

==Pre-school education==
Pre school education is provided to children less than 10 years old. It is offered by the private sector and some public organizations. Supervision is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Social Affairs. [[Nursery school|Nursery]] enrollment is very limited and estimated to be only 1%. [[Kindergarten]] is available mostly in large cities and enrollment is estimated to be 15%.

Attendance usually extends from 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 12:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., the teacher being free to organize this period as she deems appropriate between school learning and artistic and leisure activities.

The Ministry of Education is in the process of finalizing the advanced curriculum for the kindergarten level, based on self-learning as a method and centered on the Omani child and on his/her environment, cultural heritage and civilization.

==Basic education==
In 1997, the ministry began development work on a Basic Education programme to gradually replace the three level General Education system. The aim of the reform is to create a unified system covering the first ten years of schooling. Basic Education is organized into two cycles: the first cycle covers grades 1 to 4 and the second cycle covers grades 5 to 10. These two cycle are followed by two years of post-Basic Education system (secondary education). The first schools started to introduce the new system in the academic year 1998/1999.

==Secondary education==
Lasts for three years or you can graduate at any time.

Oman retains a number of grammar schools of international renown and a majority of which are private educational establishments offering Classics beyond Latin and Greek to include the ancient literary studies of Sanskrit, Hebrew and Arabic. Notable ones include [[Al Sahwa Schools]], [[The American International School Muscat|The American International School of Muscat]], [[Pakistan School Muscat]], [[Pakistan School Salalah]], [[Indian School Muscat]], [[American British Academy]], the [[British School – Muscat|British School Muscat]], the [[Indian School Al Ghubra]] and [[The Sultan's School]].

==Higher education==
The Omani higher education system is relatively young, as the first public university in Oman, [[Sultan Qaboos University]] was founded in 1986. Prior to the establishment of [[Sultan Qaboos University|SQU]], the government sent some students to pursue higher education studies in neighboring Arab countries like [[UAE]], [[Kuwait]], [[Jordan]] and [[Egypt]]. Also some students were awarded scholarships to study in the [[UK]] and [[United States|America]].

SQU is self-administered and has nine colleges. The colleges of Arts and Social Sciences, Commerce and Economics, Education, Law, and Nursing offer bachelor's and some master's degrees. Starting from September 2008, SQU began introducing [[PhD]] studies in its colleges of Agriculture and Marine Sciences, Medicine and Health Sciences, Engineering, and Science. A bachelor's degree takes about five years, as the first is spent studying English, and the second studying relevant science subjects; the last three years are dedicated to core degree units. A medicine degree takes seven years. The public university is normally visited by Omanis only. Expatriates go - as a general rule - to private universities or study abroad.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20101004020527/http://www.heac.gov.om/heac_en/ Oman's Ministry of Higher Education] administers the six [[Colleges of Applied Sciences, Oman|Colleges of Applied Sciences]]. These were formerly colleges of education, but in 2005 Royal Decree No. 62/2007 was issued to transform them to better cater to the current labor market in fields such as international business administration, communication, design, engineering, and IT. They are located in [[Ibri]], [[Nizwa]], [[Salalah]], [[Sohar]],  [[Sur, Oman|Sur]], and [[Rustaq]]. The College of Applied Sciences in Rustaq is the only one that still offers an education degree. The Ministry also has a department that sanctions private colleges and universities.

[http://www.manpower.gov.om/en/ministry_home.asp Oman's Ministry of Manpower] operates the [[Higher College of Technology]] in [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] and six colleges of technology in [[Al-Mussana]], [[Ibra]], [[Ibri]], [[Nizwa]], [[Salalah]], and [[Shinas]]. The Ministry of Health runs a number of health institutes to prepare assisting medical staff like nurses, paramedics and pharmacists. The Ministry of Awqaf and Religious Affairs sanctions the [http://www.css.edu.om College of Sharia Sciences]. The Central Bank of Oman sanctions the [http://www.cbfs.edu.om College of Banking and Financial Studies].

As the number of students finishing secondary school goes up each year (44,000 were expected to finish in 2008), [[Sultan Qaboos University|SQU]] and other public colleges have become unable to cope with the demand. Since private colleges were very limited in the mid nineties, more and more students sought higher education in countries like the [[UAE]], [[Jordan]] and [[Egypt]]. The government became aware of the trend and decided to encourage the private sector in Oman to form universities and colleges. The first private college was established in 1994. Since this date, a number of private colleges and universities have been started in Oman. Most of them focus on popular studies such as business administration and computer sciences. They are usually affiliated with [[Europe]]an, [[Australia]]n or [[United States|American]] institutions. The language of instruction is mainly English. [http://www.asu.edu.om A’Sharqiya University], in Ibra, opened its doors in the fall of 2010.

In the year 2003, Oman's Ministry of Higher Education approved the merger of five private run colleges in order to form the Muscat University. However, the plan to merge Fire Safety Engineering College, Majan College, Modern College of Business &amp; Science, Middle East College and Mazoon College for Management and Applied Sciences failed (source: Oman Observer 18.7.2005). Currently, there is some talk that the plan to form Muscat University may be revived.

As part of the [[eOman]] initiative, applications for 2006/2007 higher education (public and private) places have been merged under one unified online system (Higher Education Admissions Center). Each higher education institute publishes the minimum entry requirement for each of its degrees and the student selects his or her choices in order of preference. When the Ministry of Education publishes secondary school results in mid July, these results are fed automatically into the system and offers are made in early August. Prior to the new system, the students had to submit their papers to the different institutes by themselves after the publication of results. The process was very inconvenient for the students and the admission departments as there was very little time and students had to travel a lot.

[[File:Vtech socrates.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Vtech]] educational video game.]]
An '''educational video game''' is a [[video game]] that provides learning or training value to the player. [[Edutainment]] describes an intentional merger of video games and educational software into a single product (and could therefore also comprise more serious titles sometimes described under children's learning software). In the narrower sense used here, the term describes educational software which is primarily about entertainment, but tends to educate as well and sells itself partly under the educational umbrella. Normally software of this kind is not structured towards school [[curricula]] and does not involve educational advisors.

Educational video games play a significant role in the school curriculum for teachers who seek to deliver core lessons, reading and new skills. Gamification of education allows learners to take active roles in learning and develop technological skills that are needed for their academic and professional careers. Several recent studies have shown that video games, whether violent or not can help children in the development of intellectual and emotional skills that support their academic achievement (Chang et al., 2009). These findings have made teachers all over the world recognize the numerous benefits of gaming and to include educational video game learning in their curricula.

==Definition==
There can be also defined [[Strategy video game|strategy war games]] that include historical references, like the ''[[Total War (series)|Total War]]'' franchise or the ''[[Age of Empires]]'' trilogy and an in-game encyclopaedia like ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]''. These games often integrate education without being explicitly educational. These are games which were originally developed for adults or older children and which have potential learning implications. For the most part, these games provide [[simulation]]s of different kinds of human activities, allowing players to explore a variety of social, historical and economic processes.

Examples:
* [[City-building game]]s such as the ''[[SimCity]]'' series and ''[[Caesar (video game)|Caesar]]'' (1993–2006) invite players to explore the social, practical and economic processes involved in city management;
* Empire-building games such as the ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' series (1991–2013) and the ''[[Europa Universalis]]'' series (2000–2014) help players to learn about history and its political, economic and military aspects;
* Railroad management games such as ''[[Railroad Tycoon]]'' (1990–2003) and ''[[Rails Across America]]'' (2001) illuminate the history, engineering and economics of railroad management.
* Geography games such as ''[[PlaceSpotting]]'' (2008–2009) help players to find locations on earth according to some hints.
* Physics games such as ''[[Quantum Moves]]'' and ''[[A Slower Speed of Light]]'' aim to impart intuition for complicated physics concepts such as quantum mechanics and special relativity.

The games have been enthusiastically received in some educational circles and are mentioned into academic literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montereyherald.com/mld/montereyherald/living/health/16792666.htm|title=Video games good teachers?|date=February 27, 2007|publisher=Herald.com|work=Chicago Tribune|author=Howard Witt|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304082218/http://www.montereyherald.com/mld/montereyherald/living/health/16792666.htm|archivedate=March 4, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new category was recently started by ''[[Bot Colony]]'' (2013). It can be used to practice English dialogue by conversing with intelligent robots as part of an adventure game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.botcolony.com/doc/BotColony_paper.pdf |title=Bot Colony – a Video Game Featuring Intelligent Language-Based Interaction with the Characters |author=Eugene Joseph |year=2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715015100/http://lang.cs.tut.ac.jp/japtal2012/special_sessions/GAMNLP-12/papers/gamnlp12_submission_3.pdf |archivedate=July 15, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Many titles were developed and released from the mid-1990s onwards, aimed primarily at the home education of young children. Later iterations of these titles often began to link educational content to school curricula such as [[England]]'s [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]]. The design of [[educational game]]s for home use has been influenced by gaming concepts – they are designed to be fun and educational.

Examples of children's learning software which have a structured pedagogical approach, usually orientated towards literacy and numeracy skills.
* [[Disney Interactive]] learning titles based on characters such as [[Winnie-the-Pooh]], [[Aladdin]], [[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]] and [[Mickey Mouse]]
* [[GCompris]], contains numerous activities, from computer discovery to science
* [[Knowledge Adventure]]'s [[JumpStart]] and [[Blaster Learning System]] series
* [[The Learning Company]]'s [[Reader Rabbit]], [[The ClueFinders]] and [[Zoombinis]] series.

==History==
In September 1983 the ''[[Boston Phoenix]]'' reported that "[[edutainment]]" games were a new focus area for companies after end of growth of the [[Atari 2600]] software market.&lt;ref name="mitchell19830906"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gn0hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tYoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5584%2C3561802 | title=A summer-CES report | work=Boston Phoenix | date=1983-09-06 | accessdate=10 January 2015 | author=Mitchell, Peter W. | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the term "edutainment" was used to describe a package of software games for the Oric 1 and Spectrum Microcomputers in the UK. Dubbed "arcade edutainment" an advertisement for the package can be found in various issues of "Your Computer" magazine from 1983. The software package was available from Telford ITEC a government sponsored training program. The originator of the name was Chris Harvey who worked at ITEC at the time.

Since then, many other computer games such as [[Electronic Arts]]'s ''[[The Seven Cities of Gold (video game)|Seven Cities of Gold]]'', released 1984, have also used ''edutainment'' as a descriptive term. Most edutainment games seek to teach players by employing a [[game-based learning]] approach. Criticism as to which video games can be considered educational has led to the creation of "[[serious games]]" whose primary focus is to ''teach'' rather than entertain.

Psychologist [[Simon Egenfeldt-Nielsen]] researched the educational use and potential of computer games and has written many articles on the subject. One paper dealing specifically with edutainment breaks it down into 3 generational categories to separate the cognitive methods most predominantly used to teach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.egenfeldt.eu/papers/sweet_music.pdf|title=Making sweet music: The Educational Use of Computer Games|author=Egenfeldt-Nielsen, S|publisher=Center for Computer Games Research|website=www.egenfeldt.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is critical of the research that has been done on the educational use of computer games, citing their biases and weaknesses in method, which cause their findings to lack scientific validity.

==In education==
Games provide structure to problem-solving. This allows a player to "fail up", meaning that with the combination of challenging and fun and identity-building, the student will want to continue to persist on that problem until it is solved. It is a productive failure. This may take quite a few times before success is reached, but progress is obtained each time and so is knowledge on how to solve that problem. Iteration and discovery become two major aspects to learning through game playing. Many students have a "sweet spot" for gaming, which allows gaming in education to be successful in terms of grasping concepts, while this can be more difficult through the use of a book. Students may not even realize that they are learning through a game. Games need to include novelty. Unexpected occurrences and challenging choices allow the player to want to keep playing. Having a story or narrative in the game is what can really suck a player into the game. It allows for continuous feedback and challenges at the right level of difficulty, while avoiding frustration.

When developing successful learning games for the classroom, it can be a challenging task. In order for the game to show achievement in student learning, the games should hold certain qualities. The development of successful games to promote learning requires attention to opposing factors. Creativity and inventiveness is needed to help the outcome work well and run smoothly. Games should take the opposite approach of drill-and-practice principles, as this simplifies the games and limits the domains of knowledge. The three factors to keep in mind when designing strong and successful games are integration, motivation, and focus. In order for the player to progress in the game, they must master the learning goals and objectives behind the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bavelier|first=Daphne|last2=Green|first2=C. Shawn|last3=Han|first3=Doug Hyun|last4=Renshaw|first4=Perry F.|last5=Merzenich|first5=Michael M.|last6=Gentile|first6=Douglas A.|title=Brains on video games|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|volume=12|issue=12|pages=763–768|doi=10.1038/nrn3135|pmc=4633025|pmid=22095065|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game should be integrated with learning goals. In the content that needs to be taught through the game, it should be made a point that in order to succeed in the game, is to know the information, which creates importance to the player. The game needs to be as motivating as possible and should pose a challenge. The primary activity of the game should be interacting and interesting to the students. Games are about decision making, where you see what the consequences are and what feedback you receive. Games teach students about rewards, but that it takes some work to receive those rewards. The actions within the game need to be relevant to life outside the game, so learning can occur.  Focus can most successfully occur when one is learning by exploring, operating, or interacting.

Teachers are using games more regularly that focus on a wide variety of objectives, while exposing students to more game genres and devices. There is much more structure, which makes it a lot easier for the teacher, and the students enjoy it. Students have become so fluent with the use of online tools. Learning data can be generated from the use of online games, which allow the teacher to have insight on the knowledge the children have obtained, and what needs improvement; this can then help a teacher with their curriculum and teaching.
[[File:USMC-110816-M-7621B-001.jpg|thumb|A student uses a Smart Board in class.]]
A nationwide study of 488 K–12 teachers in the United State found that over half were using digital games in the classroom weekly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gamesandlearning.umich.edu/a-games/key-findings/survey-report/digital-game-use/|title=Digital Game Use: Teachers in the Classroom {{!}}  The A-Games Project|website=gamesandlearning.umich.edu|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most classrooms nowadays have replaced the traditional blackboard for the [[Smart Board]], bringing technology into the classroom. As we move forward into the digital age, most schools provide lessons on computer literacy to ensure students are fluent when it comes to technology. Likewise, the use of well-designed educational video games delivers game based learning that can motivate students to participate more enthusiastically in subjects, including those that are often less popular. It is also noted that educational video games offer more interaction, immediate feedback, to both student and teacher, and more student control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2015/04/gaming.aspx|title=Gaming to learn|website=American Psychology Association|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educational video games that involve aspects of reality, provide students with opportunities to be involved in an interactive environment that they would not ordinarily be allowed to participate in&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamlen|first=Karla R.|date=2013-10-01|title=Trends in Children's Video Game Play: Practical but Not Creative Thinking|url=http://jec.sagepub.com/content/49/3/277|journal=Journal of Educational Computing Research|language=en|volume=49|issue=3|pages=277–291|doi=10.2190/EC.49.3.a|issn=0735-6331}}&lt;/ref&gt; but from the safety of a classroom.&amp;nbsp;

== Special educational needs ==
Children of all kinds thrive during play-based learning. Children with special needs, be it physical or cognitive, often require different materials to aide their education. Many schools strive for the inclusion of special educational needs students within the classroom and now, with the help of technology, schools begin to close the gap and give children with disabilities equal opportunities to learn and communicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brodin|first=Jane|date=2010-03-01|title=Can ICT give children with disabilities equal opportunities in school?|url=http://imp.sagepub.com/content/13/1/99|journal=Improving Schools|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=99–112|doi=10.1177/1365480209353483|issn=1365-4802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many video games created within the past decades that specifically target special needs children, ''Dreamware'' being one. The device uses visual, auditory, temperature, and vibration sensory integration training which have been proven to capture the child's attention, keeping them focused for longer periods, allowing the child to learn more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jin-Hee|last2=Choi|first2=Eikyu|last3=Song|first3=Minseok|last4=Shin|first4=Byeong-Seok|date=2012-04-27|title=Dreamware: edutainment system for children with developmental disability|journal=Multimedia Tools and Applications|language=en|volume=68|issue=2|pages=305–319|doi=10.1007/s11042-012-1089-x|issn=1380-7501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other educational video games targeted towards those with special education needs include virtual reality, as it can provide knowledge building experiences. One study conducted by Professor Standen of [[University of Nottingham]] concluded that adolescent students with severe intellectual disabilities who practiced shopping in a virtual supermarket were both quicker and more precise than those who had not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Standen|first=P. J.|last2=Brown|first2=D. J.|date=2006-09-22|title=Virtual reality and its role in removing the barriers that turn cognitive impairments into intellectual disability|journal=Virtual Reality|language=en|volume=10|issue=3–4|pages=241–252|doi=10.1007/s10055-006-0042-6|issn=1359-4338|url=http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/5899/1/188352_5972%20Brown%20Publisher.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This showed that students could acquire important life skills through a video game and could then transfer that knowledge into the real environment, making them a valuable tool in education.

== Importance to learners ==
Educational video games help learners in the development of reading comprehension and cognitive skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bavelier|first=Daphne|last2=Green|first2=C. Shawn|last3=Han|first3=Doug Hyun|last4=Renshaw|first4=Perry F.|last5=Merzenich|first5=Michael M.|last6=Gentile|first6=Douglas A.|title=Brains on video games|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|volume=12|issue=12|pages=763–768|doi=10.1038/nrn3135|pmc=4633025|pmid=22095065|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For teachers, video games with educational value act as relevant material for engaging their students. Therefore, video games can be used as an immersive learning system that provides for a combination of digital technology, rich narrative, and real world gameplay. Through games students learn to exercise resilience, critical thinking, and problem solving skills by identifying numerous solutions for problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifets.info/journals/12_2/1.pdf|title=Effect of computer-based video games on children: An experimental study.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By introducing them to educational video games, parents and teachers can make children interested in technology and technical skills from an early age.

Educational video games are important for individualized learning. Given that every learner is different, teachers are always looking for adequate resources that will provide every learner with an individualized learning plan. Video games allow students to learn new concepts at their own pace without having a constant overlook from parents and teachers (Chang et al., 2009). The experiences of the players can be tailored based on their preferences and performance. The game is automatically adjusted to present higher-level challenges after solving each problem. If they are having difficulty with a concept, then the game is tailored to present the same concept in a different manner until the student understands it. Video games balance enjoyment with an appropriate challenge level, which keeps players in an optimally engaging and challenging learning zone.

Research shows that children who play educational video games have improved visual-spatial skills. For instance, a simple game session can help learners visualize science topics in a way that helps them learn better. Children who play educational video games have sharpened visual attention skills and improved capacity to visualize 3D objects (Achtman et al. 2008). Furthermore, educational video games as they improve their aim and hand-eye coordination. The video game is a learning sector as activities that sharpen the perceptions of children as well as their responses to the world.

== Limitations ==
One of the major limitations of educational video games is that they leave little room for spontaneous play. A child may be involved and have some degree of control in a game but ultimately cannot control the direction in which the game will go, hindering the notion of self-directed play as a means for learning. It has been noted that educational video games can help students focus; however, once the game has ended many find it hard to adapt back to the slower pace of receiving information in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bavelier|first=Daphne|last2=Green|first2=C. Shawn|last3=Han|first3=Doug Hyun|last4=Renshaw|first4=Perry F.|last5=Merzenich|first5=Michael M.|last6=Gentile|first6=Douglas A.|title=Brains on video games|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|volume=12|issue=12|pages=763–768|doi=10.1038/nrn3135|pmc=4633025|pmid=22095065|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also important for students to be able to ask questions on topics they do not fully understand. A supervising teacher may be able to aid the student whereas the computer cannot provide answers to all questions posed. Using educational computer games also relies on the teacher having prior knowledge of how the game works and be somewhat computer literate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/cortland.edu/researchproject2/disadvantages|title=Disadvantages - Games in Education|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the enthusiasm surrounding video games and learning, very few studies have come to a conclusive answer as to whether educational video games improve academic achievement and classroom performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Michael F.|last2=Slota|first2=Stephen|last3=Cutter|first3=Andrew B.|last4=Jalette|first4=Gerard|last5=Mullin|first5=Greg|last6=Lai|first6=Benedict|last7=Simeoni|first7=Zeus|last8=Tran|first8=Matthew|last9=Yukhymenko|first9=Mariya|date=2012-03-01|title=Our Princess Is in Another Castle A Review of Trends in Serious Gaming for Education|url=http://rer.sagepub.com/content/82/1/61|journal=Review of Educational Research|language=en|volume=82|issue=1|pages=61–89|doi=10.3102/0034654312436980|issn=0034-6543}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although individuals may develop game-specific abilities; these may not transfer into traditional academic skills required for learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duff|first=Simon|date=2015-03-01|editor=Fran C.

The '''Executive DBA Council''' (EDBAC) is a global volunteer organization that focuses on [[Doctor of Business Administration|executive doctoral programs]] and their issues.  The group's posted mission is "...to provide outstanding networking and educational opportunities for professionals who serve and participate in executive doctoral degree programs."  The group states on its website that it is the only global organization of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.executivedba.org/edbac/ |title=The Executive DBA Council |publisher=ExecutiveDBA.org |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The EDBAC was founded in 2011 to promote the DBA degree as a business or executive qualification, rather than an academic qualification, such as a PhD.  The group held its first meeting at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in June 2011.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/2510e0fe-0941-11e0-ada6-00144feabdc0.html |title=Push to have DBA recognised as practitioner degree |publisher=FT.com |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==DBA versus PhD==
The DBA and PhD both focus on developing an individual's research skills, but the PhD is designed to prepare individuals for academic careers.&lt;ref name=CEO&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/ceo-magazine/docs/ceo_15_-_complete_edition/40 |title=Debunking the Doctor of Business Administration |publisher=CEO Magazine |date=2014-07-14|accessdate=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The DBA is intended to prepare students for a research career in business.  An executive qualification such as a DBA is also called a practitioner degree.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt;

==Membership==
The EDBAC offers membership to accredited, not-for-profit public or private institutions of higher learning that offer a doctoral program for executives or are considering doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.executivedba.org/members/apply/ |title=Application for membership |publisher=ExecutiveDBA.org |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of January 2016, there were 48 member schools, including [[University of Maryland University College]],[[Benedictine University]], [[Case Western Reserve University]], [[City University of Hong Kong]], [[Copenhagen Business School]], [[Cranfield University]], [[ESC Rennes School of Business]], [[Georgia State University]], [[Manchester University]], [[Oklahoma State University]], [[Paris Dauphine University]],  [[Rollins College]], [[Temple University]], [[University of Florida]] and [[University of Reading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.executivedba.org/members/|title=Members |publisher=ExecutiveDBA.org |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization structure==
The EDBAC has a board consisting of a chairperson and ten other members, of which two are program alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.executivedba.org/edbac/executive-board/ |title=Executive Board |publisher=ExecutiveDBA.org |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Emma Parry of [[Cranfield University]], is the current chairperson.

==Events==
The Executive DBA Council sponsors and organizes an '''Annual Engaged Management Scholarship (EMS) Conference''' where current students and alumni of member programs present peer-reviewed research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weatherhead.case.edu/events/engaged-management/council |title=EXECUTIVE DOCTORATE in BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION (EDBA) COUNCIL STATEMENT OF STRATEGIC DIRECTION |publisher=Case.edu |date=2010-09-14 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sixth annual conference was held in Paris, France in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edba.dauphine.fr/en/news-videos/news/news-details/article/6e-conference-internationale-engaged-management-scholarship-ems.html |title=Past &amp; Upcoming Conferences |website =dauphie.fr |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2017 conference was scheduled for Tampa, Florida in September 2017 but was cancelled due to Hurricane Irma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.executivedba.org/past-and-upcoming-conferences/ |title=Past &amp; Upcoming Conferences |publisher=executivedba.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2018 conference is scheduled to take place at Temple University September 6-9 2018.

'''Francisco Vallés''' also known as '''''Divino Vallés''''' ([[Covarrubias, Province of Burgos|Covarrubias]], 4 October 1524 – [[Burgos]], 20 September 1592) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] physician, the best example of the medical [[Renaissance]] in Spain.

== Biography == 
He was born at [[Covarrubias, Province of Burgos|Covarrubias]], and studied in several European cities, which brought him into contact with [[Andrea Vesalius]], the personal physician of King [[Philip II of Spain]] and «''Médico de Cámara y Protomédico General de los Reinos y Señoríos de Castilla''» (chief physician Medical and General Chamber of Kingdoms and Dominions of Castile).

He served most of his life in [[Alcalá de Henares]], where he taught medicine, and was the first in Alcalá to teach medicine for the body.

In addition to medicine Vallés was a great humanist and writer. His last years were spent in the apothecary's [[El Escorial|Monastery of ''El Escorial'']] prepared by the distillation of natural plants. He died in [[Burgos]], and is buried in the chapel of ''[[Colegio Mayor de San Ildefonso]]'' in [[Alcalá de Henares]]. He was commemorated by the noted Spanish botanists, [[Hipólito Ruiz López|Ruiz]] and [[José Antonio Pavón Jiménez|Pavón]] when they named a South American shrub, Vallesia in 1794.

'''Hannah Kilham''' (1774–1832) née Spurr was an English [[Methodist]] and [[Quaker]], known as a missionary and linguist active in West Africa. She was also a teacher and philanthropic activist in England and Ireland.&lt;ref name="Yeo1998"&gt;{{cite book|first=Eileen |last=Yeo|title=Radical Femininity: Women's Self-Representation in the Public Sphere|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eB3pAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA27|accessdate=12 April 2012|year=1998|publisher=Manchester University Press ND|isbn=978-0-7190-5244-6|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hannah Kilham.jpg|thumb|Hannah Kilham, silhouette portrait.]]

==Early life==
She was born at [[Sheffield]] on 12 August 1774, the seventh child of Peter and Hannah Spurr, in trade there. Brought up in the [[Church of England]], she was permitted to attend [[John Wesley]]'s early morning services. Her mother's death when she was twelve (1786) had placed her at the head of the household, which consisted of her father and five brothers. Two years later her father died, and she was sent to a boarding-school at [[Chesterfield]].  At the age of 20 she joined the Wesleyans.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Kilham, Hannah|volume=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 April 1798 Hannah Spurr became the second wife of [[Alexander Kilham]], founder of the [[Methodist New Connexion]], who died at [[Nottingham]] eight months later (20 December 1798). Hannah Kilham opened a day-school in Nottingham, spending her vacations at [[Epworth, Lincolnshire|Epworth]], her husband's early home. There she became acquainted with Quakers, and in 1802 joined the [[Society of Friends]].

==Activist and missionary==
In Sheffield, while still teaching, Kilham became involved in philanthropic work. She started a Society for the Bettering of the Condition of the Poor, which was imitated elsewhere.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In 1817 Kilham began work on unwritten languages of West Africa, with the aim of spreading Christianity. She produced an elementary grammar for the children in missionary schools at [[Sierra Leone]]. From two African sailors who were being educated at [[Tottenham]], she acquired a knowledge of the [[Wolof language|Jaloof (Wolof)]] and [[Mandinka language|Mandingo (Mandinka)]] languages, and in 1820 printed anonymously ''First Lessons in Jaloof''.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Kilham induced the Society of Friends to set up an unofficial African Instruction Fund Committee, in existence 1819 to 1825, with female representation.&lt;ref name="Midgley1992"&gt;{{cite book|first=Clare |last=Midgley|title=Women Against Slavery: The British Campaigns, 1780–1870|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bu8NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA221|accessdate=12 April 2012|year=1992|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-06669-3|pages=221–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee, on which [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]] and [[Luke Howard]] sat, as a preliminary sent William Singleton to West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-link=Samuel Greatheed|first=Samuel |last=Greatheed|author2-link=Daniel Parken|first2=Daniel |last2=Parken|author3-link=Theophilus Williams|first3=Theophilus |last3=Williams|author4-link=Thomas Price (editor)|first4=Thomas |last4=Price| author5-link=Josiah Conder (editor and author)|first5=Josiah |last5=Conder|author6-link=William Hendry Stowell|first6=William Hendry|last6=Stowell| author7-link=Jonathan Edwards Ryland|first7=Jonathan Edwards|last7=Ryland| author8-link=Edwin Paxton Hood|first8=Edwin Paxton|last8=Hood|title=The Eclectic Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYdHAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA429|accessdate=12 April 2012|year=1822|publisher=C. Taylor|page=429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First African visit===
In October 1823, under the auspices of the Friends' committee for promoting African instruction, she sailed with three Quaker missionaries and the two African sailors for St. Mary's, in [[the Gambia]]. Here she started a school, using her knowledge of Wolof. She taught also at [[Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Kilham had an Irish assistant in Sierra Leone, Ann Thompson of [[Cooladine]], also a Quaker.&lt;ref name="Midgley1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen1847"&gt;{{cite book|author-link=William Allen (Quaker)|first=William |last=Allen|title=Life of William Allen: with selections from his correspondence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9WBvNFex1ssC&amp;pg=PA151|accessdate=12 April 2012|year=1847|publisher=H. Longstreth|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1824 she returned to England to report to the committee of Friends.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In 1826 she was working in [[Spitalfields]], on education, employment and health issues. She brought in [[Thomas Hodgkin]] to help with widespread disease, though there was little they could do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Amalie M. |last=Kass |first2= Edward H. |last2=Kass|title=Perfecting the World: The life and times of Dr. Thomas Hodgkin, 1798–1866|year=1988|page= 170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kilham then went to Ireland, and spent some months with the British and Irish Ladies' Society for [[famine relief]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;
Noted documentation of Hannah Kilham and other individuals that made heroic attempts to the spread of Christianity in the western sections of Africa can be further researched in the book, "West African Christianity – the religious Impact, by author Lamin Sanneh, pg.66

===Second African visit===
On 11 November 1827 Kilham once more sailed for Sierra Leone, taking with her a number of ''African School Tracts'' (London, 1827), which she had published. She visited [[Free Town]] and the villages around; and in two or three months compiled word lists in 25 languages. For reasons of health she then returned home again.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

===Third African visit and death===
On 17 October 1830 Kilham set out on her third and final voyage to Free Town. Having obtained permission from the governor to take charge of [[recaptive]] children rescued from slave-ships, Kilham, with the aid of a matron, founded a large school at Charlotte, a mountain village near Bathurst (now [[Banjul]]), and spent the rainy season there. She then travelled to [[Liberia]], visited schools in [[Monrovia]], and made arrangements for sending some African children to England for education. About 23 February 1832 she sailed for Sierra Leone. She died at sea, on 31 March 1832.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

==Works==
Besides works already mentioned, Kilham was the author of:

* ''Scripture Selections'', London, 1817;
* ''Lessons on Language'', 1818;
* ''Family Maxims'', 1818;
* ''First Lessons in Spelling'', 1818;
* ''Report on a Recent Visit to Africa'', 1827;
* ''The Claims of West Africa to Christian Instruction'', 1830.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Hannah Kilham's memoirs and diaries were published (1837), edited by her step-daughter, Sarah Biller née Kilham. She ran a school in the tradition of [[Joseph Lancaster]] in St. Petersburg.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sue |last=Morgan|title=Women, Religion, and Feminism in Britain, 1750–1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=STdyZ-D2ZhEC&amp;pg=PA67|accessdate=12 April 2012|date=11 October 2002|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-333-99307-1|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; An edition of some of Hannah Kilham's works was republished as ''Writings on Education in West Africa'' (2010).&lt;ref name="Kilham2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Hannah |last=Kilham|title=Writings on Education in West Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cwOuMruXg2MC|accessdate=12 April 2012|date=21 October 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-01914-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25403">The [[United States Department of Education]]'s measurement of the ''status'' [[dropping out|dropout]] rate is the percentage of 16 to 24-year-olds who are not enrolled in school and have not earned a [[high school]] credential.&lt;ref name="nces"&gt;NCES 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This rate is different from the event dropout rate and related measures of the status completion and average freshman completion rates.&lt;ref name="nces1"&gt;NCES 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The status high school dropout rate in 2009 was 8.1%.&lt;ref name="nces" /&gt; There are many risk factors for high school dropouts. These can be categorized into social and academic risk factors. Members of [[minority groups in the United States|racial and ethnic minority groups]] drop out at higher rates than White students, as do those from low-income families, from single-parent households, mentally disabled students, and from families in which one or both parents also did not complete high school.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;Lee 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  Students at risk for dropout based on academic risk factors are those who often have a history of [[absenteeism]] and grade retention, academic trouble, and more general disengagement from school life.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; High school dropouts in the U.S. are more likely to be [[unemployment|unemployed]], have [[low-paying job]]s, be incarcerated, have children at early ages and/or become single parents.&lt;ref name="Sum"&gt;Sum 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Academic mediation theory===
Research has shown that poor academic achievement is one of the strongest predictors of high school dropout.&lt;ref name="theories"&gt;Battin-Pearson 2000&lt;/ref&gt; This theory examines the [[mediation (statistics)|mediation]] effect of poor academic achievement on other factors, such as deviant affiliation, personal deviance, family socialization and structural strains, associated with school dropout.&lt;ref name="theories" /&gt; Essentially, it looks at how poor academic achievement interacts with and affects the relationship between high school dropout and other factors. The model for this theory was shown to statistically fit at an acceptable degree.&lt;ref name="theories" /&gt;

===General deviance theory===
This theory looks at the relationship between deviant behavior and dropout. Deviant behavior includes delinquency, drug use, and early pregnancy.&lt;ref name="theories" /&gt; There is a very strong relationship as general deviance is a strong direct predictor of dropout beyond the effect mediated by poor academic achievement.&lt;ref name="theories" /&gt;

===Deviant affiliation theory===
The relationship described in this theory is one between an individual bonding with antisocial peers and its effect on dropout rates.&lt;ref name="theories" /&gt; Students receive the classification of antisocial if they are likely to drop out themselves and/or have low school attachment.&lt;ref name="theories" /&gt; If an individual has antisocial friends, he/she is much more likely to drop out of school regardless of how well he/she is doing in school.&lt;ref name="theories" /&gt;

===Poor family socialization theory===
The institution of family appears to very formative for a developing child. As such, this theory examines the relationship between family background and dropout rates.&lt;ref name="theories" /&gt; The relationship is not particularly strong, past academic achievement has much more of an influence than poor family socialization.&lt;ref name="theories" /&gt; Factors of poor family socialization include low parental expectations and a parent's lack of education.&lt;ref name="theories" /&gt;

===Structural strains theory===
This theory focuses on the relationship between demographic factors, such as socioeconomic status, gender and ethnicity, and dropout.&lt;ref name="theories" /&gt; Boys are much more likely to drop out than girls and dropouts are most likely from a family with a low socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name="theories" /&gt; There has been contention over the influence of ethnicity on dropout rates.&lt;ref name="theories" /&gt; However, it is clear that it does have some influence. Low socioeconomic status is a significant predictor of dropout beyond poor academic achievement.&lt;ref name="theories" /&gt; Ethnicity and gender had no significance beyond their influence on academic achievement.&lt;ref name="theories" /&gt;

==Risk factors==

===Social risk factors===
Social risk factors are demographic variables that are associated with a higher likelihood of school difficulties and, consequently, higher dropout rates.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; These demographic factors include [[Race (classification of humans)|race]]/[[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], age, language-minority status, gender, family income (socioeconomic status), parents' level of education and family structure. Research shows that members of racial and ethnicity minority groups drop out at higher rates than white students, as do individuals who have a low socioeconomic status, come from a single-parent household or whose parents did not complete high school.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; In 2010 the dropout rates of 16- through 24-year-olds who are not enrolled in school and have not earned a high school credential were: 5.1% for white students, 8% for black students, 15.1% for Hispanic students, and 4.2% for Asian students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=16|title=Dropout rates|author=National Center for Education Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic risk factors===
Academic risk factors refer to the students' performance in school and are highly related to school level problems. These factors include absenteeism, grade retention, special education placement, low performance and grades, and low educational expectations.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; Poor academic achievement has a very strong relationship with increased likelihood of dropping out.&lt;ref name="theories" /&gt; Grade retention can increase the odds of dropping out by as much as 250 percent above those of similar students who were not retained.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;McNeil 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Students who drop out typically have a history of absenteeism, grade retention and academic trouble and are more disengaged from school life.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt;

School structure, curriculum and size are factors influential to increased likelihood of a student experiencing academic risk factors.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; The school curriculum has been found to affect the likelihood of a student to drop out regardless of which courses the individual was taking. Students who attended schools that offered Calculus or fewer courses below the level of Algebra 1 had a reduced risk of dropping out of school by 56%.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt;

School size has a very strong non-linear correlation with dropout rate. A study done by Werblow found that increases in school size can be "associated with a 12% increase in average student dropout rate".&lt;ref name="warbler"&gt;Werblow 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, once a school becomes very large, its size seems to hardly affect dropout rates except for its effect on other factors.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; Large schools, enrolling between 1,500 and 2,500 students, were found to have the largest proportion of students who dropped out, 12%.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; Small schools have the lowest dropout rate.&lt;ref name="warbler" /&gt;

The type or structure of a school was found to be irrelevant in a study done by Lee once other factors, such as demographics and size, were accounted for.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; The only way school structure affected dropout rates was through teacher-student relationships. Students who attended schools with more positive student-teacher interaction were less likely to drop out.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; The effect of this relationship was largely determined by the type of school. In small or medium-sized public or Catholic schools, 'positive student-teacher relations led to an 86% decrease in the odds of dropping out".&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; However, student-teacher relations did not significantly affect small or medium private schools.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt;

==Role of relationships==
As mentioned above, teacher-student interactions can have a large influence on the likelihood of a student dropping out of high school. The better the relationships between students and teachers, the less likely the student is to drop out of school.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt; However, if a teacher identifies a student as on track and having a positive attitude towards school, but does not necessarily have personal interaction with the student, that student has a higher chance of dropping out.&lt;ref name="englund"&gt;Englund 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationships students have with their peers also play a role in influencing a student's likelihood of dropping out. Building relationships with anti-social peers was found by Battin-Pearson to be a strong and direct predictor of dropout beyond the influence of poor academic achievement.&lt;ref name="theories" /&gt; Students who had deviant friends were more likely to drop out of school early regardless of their achievement in school.&lt;ref name="theories" /&gt;

Parent-child relationships have also been found to be very influential in whether or not a student decides to stay in school. The better the relationship, as demonstrated through positive interaction and parental involvement, the more likely the student will stay in school.&lt;ref name="englund" /&gt; If a student does not have a good relationship with his/her parents, the student is more likely to drop out even if he has good grades and good behavior.&lt;ref name="englund" /&gt; This demonstrates that parental support is crucial, as students with good grades and behavior are typically more likely to stay in school.&lt;ref name="englund" /&gt; However, parental expectations or degree of education are not as influential. A study by Battin-Pearson found that these two factors did not contribute significantly to dropout beyond what was explained by poor academic achievement.&lt;ref name="theories" /&gt;

==Motivation for dropping out==
While the above factors certainly place a student at risk for dropout, they are not always the reason the student identifies as their motivation for dropping out. However, there is not a large body of research describing the students' personal motivation. One study found that the main reasons students reported for dropping out included uninteresting classes (a lack of engagement with school life and classes), unmotivated (students typically said teachers did not demand enough or were not inspirational), personal reasons (had to get a job, became a parent, had to support or care for a family member), and academic challenges (felt like they could not keep up, felt unprepared for high school, had to repeat a grade, or graduation requirements seemed out of reach).&lt;ref name="Bridges"&gt;Bridgeland 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Early parenthood and pregnancy is a motivation to dropout. An article stated that early parenthood was the number one cause for school dropout in teen girls, as thirty percent of teen girls said pregnancy was the reason why they dropped out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shuger|first=Lisa|date=2012|title=Teen Pregnancy and High School Dropout: What Communities are Doing to Address These Issues.|url=http://www.americaspromise.org/sites/default/files/d8/legacy/bodyfiles/teen-pregnancy-and-hs-dropout-print.pdf|journal=The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy and America’s Promise Alliance|volume=|pages=1-17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, social reasons such as bullying, harassment, or an inability to fit into the school community for reasons outside of their control are reasons.

==The effect of standardized tests==
The [[No Child Left Behind Act]] implemented a "standardized, high-stakes, test-based accountability system".&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;  The purpose was to increase accountability of schools for measured improvements of students' knowledge. In order to accomplish this, test scores were disaggregated into subgroups to better evaluate if the historically under-served minorities were receiving a good education.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;  Under this system, a school cannot receive a high rating if the scores of the subgroups do not improve.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;  Based on a study done by researchers from Rice University and University of Texas at Austin, the policy inadvertently encourages students to drop out of high school.  Teachers and administrators utilize grade retention as a strategy to improve test scores and ensure positive ratings.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

==Consequences==

===Individual===
High school dropouts are less likely to be active labor force participants and are more likely to be [[unemployment|unemployed]] than their more educated counterparts.&lt;ref name="Sum" /&gt; The current unemployment rate for high school dropouts is about 56 percent greater than that for high school completers.&lt;ref name="BLS"&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Lifetime earnings for this group are estimated to be $260,000 less than those for high school graduates.&lt;ref name="Rouse"&gt;Rouse 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Female dropouts are much more likely to become [[Single parent|single mothers]] and consequently be more likely to have an income under the poverty threshold or live on [[welfare]].&lt;ref name="Sum" /&gt; High school dropouts make up 68 percent of the nation’s prison population.&lt;ref name="Harlow"&gt;Harlow 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 37% of dropouts live in [[poverty in the United States|poor/near poor]] families.&lt;ref name="Sum" /&gt; Additionally, high school dropouts have a life expectancy that is 3–5 years shorter than high school graduates.&lt;ref name="Levin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-57518135-10391704/life-expectancies-of-u.s-whites-with-low-education-drop-sharply/|title=Life expectancies of U.S. whites with low education drop sharply|author=CBSNews.com | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number high school dropouts however became successful. [[Walt Disney]] was an American [[business magnate]], [[cartoonist]], and [[filmmaking|filmmaker]] who dropped out of high school at the age of sixteen in hopes of joining the army. [[Bobby Fischer]] was an American [[chess prodigy]], grandmaster, and the eleventh [[World Chess Championship|World Chess Champion]] who also dropped out of high school when he turned age sixteen and later explained "You don't learn anything in school". [[Glen L Roberts]] after a career of trying to expose government privacy abuses, left the United States, renounced his citizenship and became one of the few former Americans to voluntarily become [[statelessness|stateless]]. He had dropped out of high school in 10th grade.

===Societal===
The problems created at an individual level due to the lack of a high school diploma or [[GED]] affect society as a whole.  Those who cannot find jobs cannot pay taxes, resulting in a loss of revenue for the government.&lt;ref name="Sum" /&gt;  For each cohort of 18-year-olds who never complete high school, the US loses $192 billion in income and tax revenue. Moretti estimates that by increasing the high school completion rate of males by one percent, the US could save up to $1.4 billion annually in reduced costs from crime.&lt;ref name="moretti"&gt;Moretti 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  A substantial amount of taxpayer money goes toward maintaining the prisons.  And, in 2004, each high school dropout was responsible for nearly $100,000 in health-related losses.&lt;ref name="Levin" /&gt;  Because of these factors, an average high school dropout will cost the government over $292,000.&lt;ref name="Sum" /&gt;

==Measurement of the dropout rate==
The U.S. Department of Education identifies four different rates to measure high school dropout and completion in the United States. Each rate contributes unique information.&lt;ref name="nces1" /&gt; 	
* The event dropout rate estimates the percentage of high school students who left high school between the beginning of one school year and the beginning of the next without earning a high school diploma or its equivalent (e.g., a GED). Event rates can be used to track annual changes in the dropout behavior of students in the U.S. school system.&lt;ref name="nces1" /&gt;
* The status dropout rate reports the percentage of individuals in a given age range who are not in school and have not earned a high school diploma or equivalent credential. This rate focuses on an overall age group as opposed to individuals in the U.S. school system, so it can be used to study general population issues.&lt;ref name="nces1" /&gt;
* The status completion rate indicates the percentage of individuals in a given age range who are not in high school and who have earned a high school diploma or equivalent credential, irrespective of when the credential was earned. The rate focuses on an overall age group as opposed to individuals in the U.S. school system, so it can be used to study general population issues.&lt;ref name="nces1" /&gt;
* The averaged freshman graduation rate estimates the proportion of public high school freshmen who graduate with a regular diploma four years after starting ninth grade. The rate focuses on public high school students as opposed to all high school students or the general population and is designed to provide an estimate of on-time graduation from high school. Thus, it provides a measure of the extent to which public high schools are graduating students within the expected period of four years.&lt;ref name="nces1" /&gt;

'''The International Society of Military Sciences''' ('''ISMS''') is an international organization whose stated aim is to build a strong network for the creation, development, exchange and diffusion of research and knowledge about war, conflict management and peace support efforts. The ISMS was founded in October 2008. The [[Austrian National Defence Academy]], the [[Royal Military College of Canada]], the [[Danish Defence|Royal Danish Defence College]], the [[Finnish National Defence University]], the [[Koninklijke Militaire Academie|Netherlands Defence Academy]], the [[Norwegian Defence University College]], the [[Swedish National Defence College]] and the [[Baltic Defence College]] established this society with the intention to further research and academic education in military arts and sciences in the broadest sense.

==Establishing the ISMS==

In the summer of 2007 the Faculty of Military Sciences, Netherlands Defence Academy, started working on more international collaboration on an institutional level. Canada, Sweden and Austria were the first military institutes and universities which were approached for collaboration. Soon four other institutes joined in. In November 2011, the [[National Defence University of Warsaw]] and the [[Royal Military Academy (Belgium)]] were voted in. The Royal Military Academy of Belgium withdrew their membership before the council meeting in Oslo, May 2017.

==Letter of Intent==

The formal signing of the ''Letter of Intent'' was on October 22, 2008 in Copenhagen. That day the participating academies also decided to formally present the ISMS in November 2009 during its first annual international conference which was to be held in the [[Netherlands]]. The theme of this first conference was “''Security in 2020 in a Multi-Polar World''”.

===Letter of Intent===

1) The undersigned institutions of Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden, and the Baltic Defence College (later referred to as the institutions) agree to establish a society intended to further research and academic education in military arts and sciences in the broadest sense. This association is titled International Society of Military Sciences (hereafter referred to as the Society).  
 
2) The purpose of the Society is to build a network for the creation, development, exchange and diffusion of research and knowledge about war, conflict management and peace support efforts.

3) The Society will establish an annual conference, and one or more workshops per year.  Activities include communications and publications to support a research network within topics such as: war studies; military history; military technology; command and control, leadership and basic competence; law and ethics; security and defence policy and strategy; armed forces and society; and defence economics and management. These are detailed in Annex A.

4) The representatives of the member institutions constitute the Council as the highest authority governing the Society.  The Council elects a Board governing the Society.  The purpose of the Board is to initiate and coordinate the activities of the Society.  The institution hosting the annual conference provides the secretariat for the Society for the period of one year.

5) Society members commit themselves to organise and participate in various workshops, conference or working groups, with the understanding that they will endeavour to lead at least one working group or workshop and participate in at least two others.  A tentative schedule of upcoming events is attached at Annex B.
 
6) The Society will be established for the four-year term in October 2008 upon signing of Letter of Intent by the institutions, and it is announced at the First Annual Conference. 
 
7) The first Annual Conference will be held in November 2009.  Invitations to participate in the Conference and to join the Society will be distributed widely.  The Council will consider applications for new membership by compatible organizations annually. However, participation in conferences and workshops is welcomed at any time.

More so, membership is by invitation only.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isofms.org/cms_uploads/CHARTER%20of%20the%20ISMS%20adopted%20June%202011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The governing body of the ISMS is the '''Council''', which is made up by one representative of each member institution. The '''Chairmanship''' of the Council is assumed by the '''ISMS Presidency'''. The Presidency of the ISMS rotates on an annual bases between the member institutions. It is the role of the Presidency to host the '''annual ISMS conference''' and act as the ''ISMS secretariat'' for the period between the annual conferences.

A '''Kolleg''' (German {{IPA-de|ˈkɔleːɡ|}} from Latin ''collegium'') in Germany is a three-year school of [[adult education]], preparing students for the exams leading to the general university entrance qualification, the ''[[Abitur]] (Allgemeine Hochschulreife)''.

Different from the otherwise similar German evening school, ''[[Abendgymnasium]]'', Kolleg classes are in the daytime. Both are state-run schools and do not charge tuition fees. Kolleg students can be eligible for financial aid as regulated in the German Federal Training Assistance Act, ''[[BAFöG|Berufsausbildungsförderungsgesetz]]''.  
 
As a rule, the minimum entrance requirements for students are: 19 years of age or older, a [[Mittlere Reife]] school leaving certificate, and a formal vocational training completed. However, there are exceptions from that rule, e.g., previous long-term work experience (at least three years) without formal qualification can be recognized as sufficient substitute for vocational training, which also includes raising children and running a household. Kollegs may additionally require applicants to pass an entrance examination.

Schools are in the competence of each federal state ''([[States of Germany|bundesland]])'', so that regulations may vary from bundesland to bundesland.

The German term ''Kolleg'' should not be confused with the English term ''college''.

==Other meanings of ''Kolleg'' in German==

* The word ''Kolleg'' is also used in some names of schools of different types, e.g., [[Aloisiuskolleg]], the [[Kolleg St. Blasien]] and the [[Canisius-Kolleg Berlin]]. These are [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] schools that have been using the word ''Kolleg'' since before the newer type of ''Kolleg'' was established.
* ''Kolleg'' should not be confused with ''Studienkolleg'', a preparatory course at German universities for applicants from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.studienkollegs.de/en/ |title=For infos about ''Studienkollegs'', see web portal of German Studienkollegs. |access-date=2012-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716074123/http://www.studienkollegs.de/en/ |archive-date=2012-07-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Like with ''Kolleg'', there are also other schools which carry the word ''Studienkolleg'' in their name for reasons of tradition.)
* ''Berufskollegs'' are vocational schools that can lead to university entrance qualifications ([[Fachhochschulreife]] or [[Abitur]]), as well as to certain formal vocational qualifications. Berufskollegs can vary from bundesland to bundesland.
* ''Kollegschule'' in Germany was the term for a type of vocational school that existed specifically in the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] until the end of the 20th century. These schools have been replaced by ''Berufskollegs''.

'''Master of Business Systems''' ('''MBS''') is a [[Postgraduate]]/[[Master's degree]] in Business Systems.

Business Systems programs combine [[Information Technology]] (IT) and [[Business]]/[[Management]] courses and are common in [[Australia]]. 

Australian universities, like most in the UK education systems, pay more attention on how IT would help the business and financial process online, rather than how IT would be the product itself in conceptualization to be sold as most institutions do in South Korea, Japan and the US. However, for international students interested to enter IT, it would be a good choice of kick-start.

==Typical areas of study==

*Basic Technology:

Courses may include topics like applied computer science, [[Computer Networks and Internet Technology|computer networks and Internet technology]], website engineering, web designing, programming, or information security.

*Business Informatics Methods:

Courses may focus on information systems development, database management, information systems architectures, business intelligence, or business process modelling.

*Management:

Management oriented topics may be studied in courses on management information systems, information management, management control, database management, risk management, neural networks, project management, knowledge management, management and organization of IT departments, or software engineering management etc.

*Applications:

Important application domains of Business Systems may be investigated in courses like enterprise resource planning, [[E-Commerce]], [[SAP ERP|SAP]] and e-business networking, industrial information systems, or electronic finance/electronic banking, web security, simulation models etc.

The '''mismatch negativity''' ('''MMN''') or '''mismatch field''' ('''MMF''') is a component of the [[event-related potential]] (ERP) to an odd stimulus in a sequence of stimuli. It arises from electrical activity in the [[brain]] and is studied within the field of [[cognitive neuroscience]] and [[psychology]]. It can occur in any [[sensory system]], but has most frequently been studied for [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]] and for [[Visual perception|vision]]. In the case of auditory stimuli, the MMN occurs after an infrequent change in a repetitive sequence of sounds (sometimes the entire sequence is called an ''oddball sequence''.) For example, a rare deviant (d) sound can be interspersed among a series of frequent standard (s) sounds (e.g., ''s s s s s s s s s d s s s s s s d s s s d s s s s''...). The deviant sound can differ from the standards in one or more perceptual features such as [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], duration, or [[loudness]]. The MMN is usually evoked by either a change in frequency, intensity, duration or real or apparent spatial locus of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Näätänen | first1 = R. | last2 = Paavilainen | first2 = P. | last3 = Titinen | first3 = H. | last4 = Jiang | first4 = D. | last5 = Alho | first5 = D. | year = 1993 | title = Attention and Mismatch Negativity | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 30 | issue = 5| pages = 436–450 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.1993.tb02067.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MMN can be elicited regardless of whether the subject is paying attention to the sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brattico |first1=Elvira |last2=Tervaniemi |first2=Mari |last3=Näätänen |first3=Risto |last4=Peretz |first4=Isabelle |date=8 August 2006 |title=Musical Scale Properties are Automatically Processed in the Human Auditory Cortex |url=http://www.brainmusic.org/EducationalActivitiesFolder/Brattico_pitch2006.pdf |journal=Brain Research |publisher=Elsevier B.V. |volume=1117 |issue=1 |pages=162–174 |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2006.08.023 |accessdate=20 June 2014 |pmid=16963000}}&lt;/ref&gt; During auditory sequences, a person can be reading or watching a silent subtitled movie, yet still show a clear MMN. In the case of visual stimuli, the MMN occurs after an infrequent change in a repetitive sequence of images.

MMN refers to the mismatch response in [[electroencephalography]] (EEG); MMF or MMNM refer to the mismatch response in [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG).

==History==

The auditory MMN was discovered in 1978 by [[Risto Näätänen]], A. W. K. Gaillard, and S. Mäntysalo at the Institute for Perception, [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO]] in [[The Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="Näätänen, 1978"/&gt;

The first report of a visual MMN was in 1990 by Rainer Cammer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cammann | first1 = R | year = 1990 | title = Is there no MMN in the visual modality? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 234–234 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00078420}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a history of the development of the visual MMN, see Pazo-Alvarez et al. (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pazo-Alvarez | first1 = P. | last2 = Cadaveira | first2 = F. | last3 = Amenedo | first3 = E. | year = 2003 | title = MMN in the visual modality: A review | url = | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 199–236 | doi=10.1016/s0301-0511(03)00049-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The MMN is a response to a deviant within a sequence of otherwise regular stimuli; thus, in an experimental setting, it is produced when stimuli are presented in a many-to-one ratio; for example, in a sequence of sounds ''s s s s s s s d s s s s d s s s...'', the ''d'' is the deviant or oddball stimulus, and will elicit an MMN response.  The mismatch negativity occurs even if the subject is not consciously paying attention to the stimuli.&lt;ref name="Näätänen, 1978"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Näätänen R, Gaillard AW, Mäntysalo S |title=Early selective-attention effect on evoked potential reinterpreted |journal=Acta Psychol (Amst) |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=313–29 |date=July 1978 |pmid=685709 |doi=10.1016/0001-6918(78)90006-9 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Processing of sensory stimulus features is essential for humans in determining their responses and actions. If behaviourally relevant aspects of the environment are not correctly represented in the brain, then the organism's behaviour cannot be appropriate. Without these representations our ability to understand spoken language, for example, would be seriously impaired. Cognitive neuroscience has consequently emphasised the importance of understanding brain mechanisms of sensory information processing, that is, the sensory prerequisites of cognition. Most of the data obtained, unfortunately, do not allow the objective measurement of the accuracy of these stimulus representations (see Näätänen, 1992).&lt;ref name="Näätänen, 1992"&gt;{{cite book |author=Näätänen, Risto |title=Attention and brain function |publisher=L. Erlbaum |location=Hillsdale, N.J |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=0-8058-0984-8 |oclc=25832590 |url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=14362952 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, recent cognitive neuroscience seems to have succeeded in extracting such a measure, however. This is the mismatch negativity (MMN), a component of the event-related potential (ERP), first reported by Näätänen, Gaillard, and Mäntysalo (1978).&lt;ref name="Näätänen, 1978"/&gt; An in-depth review of MMN research can be found in Näätänen (1992)&lt;ref name="Näätänen, 1992"/&gt; while other recent reviews also provide information on the generator mechanisms of MMN (Alho 1995),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Alho K |title=Cerebral generators of mismatch negativity (MMN) and its magnetic counterpart (MMNm) elicited by sound changes |journal=Ear Hear |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=38–51 |date=February 1995 |pmid=7774768 |doi=10.1097/00003446-199502000-00004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; its magnetic counterpart, MMNm (Näätänen, Ilmoniemi &amp; Alho, 1994),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Näätänen R, Ilmoniemi RJ, Alho K |title=Magnetoencephalography in studies of human cognitive brain function |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=17 |issue=9 |pages=389–95 |date=September 1994 |pmid=7529443 |doi=10.1016/0166-2236(94)90048-5 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its clinical applicability (Näätänen &amp; Alho, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Näätänen R, Alho K |title=Mismatch negativity--a unique measure of sensory processing in audition |journal=Int. J. Neurosci. |volume=80 |issue=1–4 |pages=317–37 |year=1995 |pmid=7775056 |doi=10.3109/00207459508986107 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The auditory MMN can occur in response to deviance in pitch, intensity, or duration. The auditory MMN is a fronto-central negative potential with sources in the primary and non-primary [[auditory cortex]] and a typical latency of 150-250 ms after the onset of the deviant stimulus. Sources could also include one from the right opercular part of the [[inferior frontal gyrus]]. The amplitude and latency of the MMN is related to how different the deviant stimulus is from the standard. Large deviances elicit MMN at earlier latencies. For very large deviances, the MMN can even overlap the [[N100 (neuroscience)|N100]] (e.g., Campbell et al., 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = T.A. | last2 = Winkler | first2 = I. | last3 = Kujala | first3 = T. | year = 2007 | title = N1 and the mismatch negativity are spatiotemporally distinct ERP components: Disruption of immediate memory by auditory distraction can be related to N1 | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 530–540 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8986.2007.00529.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visual MMN can occur in response to deviance in such aspects as color, size, or duration. The visual MMN is an occipital negative potential with sources in the primary [[visual cortex]] and a typical latency of 150-250 ms after the onset of the deviant stimulus.

==Neurolinguistics==

As kindred phenomena have been elicited with speech stimuli, under passive conditions that require very little active attention to the sound, a version of MMN has been frequently used in studies of [[Neurolinguistics|neurolinguistic]] perception, to test whether or not these participants neurologically distinguish between certain kinds of sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Phillips | first1 = C. | last2 = Pellathy | first2 = T. | last3 = Marantz | first3 = A. | last4 = Yellin | first4 = E. | last5 = Wexler | first5 = K. | last6 = McGinnis | first6 = M. | last7 = Poeppel | first7 = D. | last8 = Roberts | first8 = T. | year = 2001 | title = Auditory Cortex Accesses Phonological Category: An MEG Mismatch Study | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 12 | issue = 6| pages = 1038–1055 | doi=10.1162/08989290051137567}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MMN response has been used to study how fetuses and newborns discriminate speech sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/190792301|title=Developmental psychophysiology : theory, systems, and methods|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Schmidt, Louis A., Segalowitz, Sidney J.|isbn=9780511499791|location=Cambridge|oclc=190792301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-11-01|title=Sound frequency change detection in fetuses and newborns, a magnetoencephalographic study|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381190500412X|journal=NeuroImage|language=en|volume=28|issue=2|pages=354–361|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.06.011|issn=1053-8119}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these kinds of studies focusing on [[Phonology|phonological]] processing, some research has implicated the MMN in [[Syntax|syntactic]] processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Automaticity and Control in Language Processing | series=Advances in Behavioural Brain Science | year=2007 | chapter=The mismatch negativity as an objective tool for studying higher language functions | last=Pulvermüller | first=Friedemann |author2=Yury Shtyrov | pages=217&amp;ndash;242 | others=Eds.

Carlyon  | pages=244&amp;ndash;253 | pmid=17624417}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these studies have attempted to directly test the automaticity of the MMN, providing converging evidence for the understanding of the MMN as a task-independent and automatic response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2007.05.002 | title=Syntax as a reflex: Neurophysiological evidence for the early automaticity of syntactic processing | journal=Brain and Language | year=2008 | volume=104 | last=Pulvermüller | issue=3 | first=Friedemann |author2=Yury Shtyrov |author3=Anna S. Hasting |author4=Robert P. Carlyon  | pages=244&amp;ndash;253 | pmid=17624417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==For basic stimulus features==
MMN is evoked by an infrequently presented stimulus ("deviant"), differing from the frequently-occurring stimuli ("standards") in one or several physical parameters like duration, intensity, or frequency (Näätänen, 1992).&lt;ref name="Näätänen, 1992"/&gt; In addition, it is generated by a change in spectrally complex stimuli like phonemes,  in synthesised instrumental tones, or in the spectral component of tone timbre. Also the temporal order reversals elicit an MMN when successive sound elements differ either in frequency, intensity, or duration. The MMN is not elicited by stimuli with deviant stimulus parameters when they are presented without the intervening standards. Thus, the MMN has been suggested to reflect change detection when a memory trace representing the constant standard stimulus and the neural code of the stimulus with deviant parameter(s) are discrepant.

==Vs. auditory sensory memory==
The MMN data can be understood as providing evidence that stimulus features are separately analysed and stored in the vicinity of auditory cortex (for a discussion, please see the theory section below). The close resemblance of the behaviour of the MMN to that of the previously behaviourally observed "echoic" memory system strongly suggests that the MMN provides a non-invasive, objective, task-independently measurable physiological correlate of stimulus-feature representations in auditory sensory memory.

==Relationship to attentional processes==
The experimental evidence suggests that the auditory sensory memory index MMN provides sensory data for attentional processes, and, in essence, governs certain aspects of attentive information processing. This is evident in the finding that the latency of the MMN determines the timing of behavioural responses to changes in the auditory environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tiitinen | first1 = H. | last2 = May | first2 = P. | last3 = Reinikainen | first3 = K. | last4 = Näätänen | first4 = R. | title = Attentive novelty detection in humans is governed by pre-attentive sensory memory | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 372 | issue = 6501| pages = 90–92 | doi = 10.1038/372090a0 | pmid=7969425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, even individual differences in discrimination ability can be probed with the MMN. The MMN is a component of the chain of brain events causing attention switches to changes in the environment. Attentional instructions also affect MMN.&lt;ref&gt;Woldorff, M. G., Hackley, S.

==In clinical research==

The MMN has been documented in a number of studies to disclose neuropathological changes. 
Presently, the accumulated body of evidence suggests that while the MMN offers unique opportunities to basic research of the information processing of a healthy brain, it might be useful in tapping neurodegenerative changes as well.

MMN, which is elicited irrespective of attention, provides an objective means for evaluating possible auditory discrimination and sensory-memory anomalies in such clinical groups as dyslexics and patients with aphasia, who have a multitude of symptoms including attentional problems. Recent results suggest that a major problem underlying the reading deficit in dyslexia might be an inability of the dyslexics' auditory cortex to adequately model complex sound patterns with fast temporal variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kujala|first=Teija|last2=Myllyviita|first2=Katja|last3=Tervaniemi|first3=Mari|last4=Alho|first4=Kimmo|last5=Kallio|first5=Jari|last6=Näätänen|first6=Risto|date=2000/03|title=Basic auditory dysfunction in dyslexia as demonstrated by brain activity measurements|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychophysiology/article/basic-auditory-dysfunction-in-dyslexia-as-demonstrated-by-brain-activity-measurements/6D671B9289C62183C9C4EFDDF3306D22|journal=Psychophysiology|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=262–266|issn=1469-8986}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the results of an ongoing study, MMN might also be used in the evaluation of auditory perception deficits in aphasia.

AD patients demonstrate decreased amplitude of MMN, especially with long inter-stimulus intervals; this is thought to reflect reduced span of auditory sensory memory. Parkinsonian patients do demonstrate a similar deficit pattern, whereas alcoholism would appear to enhance the MMN response. This latter, seemingly contradictory, finding could be explained by hyperexcitability of CNS neurones resulting from neuroadaptive changes taking place during a heavy drinking bout.

While the results obtained thus far seem encouraging, several steps need to be taken before the MMN can be used as a clinical tool in patient treatment. A focus of research in the late 1990s aimed to tackle some of the key signal-analysis problems encountered in development of clinical use of MMN and challenges still remain. Nevertheless, as it stands, clinical research employing the MMN has already produced significant knowledge on the CNS functional changes related to cognitive decline in the aforementioned clinical disorders.

A 2010 study found that MMN durations were reduced in a group of schizophrenia patients who later went on to have psychotic episodes, suggesting that MMN durations may predict future psychosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bodatsch M, Ruhrmann S, Wagner M, etal |title=Prediction of psychosis by mismatch negativity |journal=Biol. Psychiatry |volume=69 |issue=10 |pages=959–66 |date=May 2011 |pmid=21167475 |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.09.057 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

The mainstream "memory trace" interpretation of MMN is that it is elicited in response to violations of simple rules governing the properties of information. It is thought to arise from violation of an automatically formed, short-term neural model or memory trace of physical or abstract environmental regularities (Näätänen &amp; Winkler, 1999; Näätänen, Paavilainen, Rinne, &amp; Alho 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Näätänen R, Paavilainen P, Rinne T, Alho K |title=The mismatch negativity (MMN) in basic research of central auditory processing: a review |journal=Clin Neurophysiol |volume=118 |issue=12 |pages=2544–90 |date=December 2007 |pmid=17931964 |doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2007.04.026 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Näätänen R, Winkler I |title=The concept of auditory stimulus representation in cognitive neuroscience |journal=Psychol Bull |volume=125 |issue=6 |pages=826–59 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10589304 |doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.125.6.826|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other than MMN, there is no other neurophysiological evidence for the formation of the memory representation of those regularities.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Integral to this memory trace view is that there are: 
i) a population of sensory afferent neuronal elements that respond to sound, and; 
ii) a separate population of memory neuronal elements that build a neural model of standard stimulation and respond more vigorously when the incoming stimulation violates that neural model, eliciting an MMN.

An alternative "fresh afferent" interpretation (Näätänen, 1992; Jääskeläinen et al., 2004)&lt;ref name="Näätänen, 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Jääskeläinen IP, Ahveninen J, Bonmassar G, etal |title=Human posterior auditory cortex gates novel sounds to consciousness |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=101 |issue=17 |pages=6809–14 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15096618 |pmc=404127 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0303760101 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that there are no memory neuronal elements, but the sensory afferent neuronal elements that are tuned to properties of the standard stimulation respond less vigorously upon repeated stimulation. Thus when a deviant activates a distinct new population of neuronal elements that is tuned to the different properties of the deviant rather than the standard, these fresh afferents respond more vigorously, eliciting an MMN.

A third view is that the sensory afferents are the memory neurons (Ulanovsky, 2004; Jääskeläinen et al., 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://icnc.huji.ac.il/phd/theses/files/NachumUlanovsky.pdf |title=Neuronal adaptation in cat auditory cortex |format=pdf |author=Ulanovsky, N. |year=2004|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jääskeläinen IP, Ahveninen J, Belliveau JW, Raij T, Sams M |title=Short-term plasticity in auditory cognition |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=30 |issue=12 |pages=653–61 |date=December 2007 |pmid=17981345 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2007.09.003 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pine Mountain Settlement School''' is located on [[Pine Mountain (ridge)|Pine Mountain]] in [[Harlan County, Kentucky|Harlan County]], [[Kentucky]]. The [[settlement school]] focuses on [[Appalachia]]n and [[environmental education]].

==History==

===Founding===
"A National Historic Landmark, Pine Mountain Settlement School was founded in 1913 as a school for children in the commonwealth's remote southeastern mountains and a social center for surrounding communities. The school was the dream of a local man, William Creech Sr., who was troubled by the area's lack of educational opportunities, and the prevalence of social problems and rampant disease. He donated land for the school and recruited two women, [[Katherine Pettit]] of Lexington, Kentucky, and [[Ethel de Long Zande|Ethel de Long]], New Jersey native, to establish and run the new institution. These two women enlisted the help of architect Mary Rockwell Hook of Kansas City to draw up plans for the campus and its buildings."

===Uses===

Pine Mountain Settlement School grew out of the [[settlement movement]], which established institutions such as [[Hull House]].&lt;ref name="women in ky"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.womeninkentucky.com/site/education/K_Pettit.html| title =Educators: Katherine Pettit| publisher =Women in Kentucky | accessdate =2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school has served many purposes in since its founding nearly a century ago.

* From 1913 to 1930, Pine Mountain served as a [[boarding school]] for children of [[elementary school|elementary]] and [[middle school]] age.&lt;ref name="pine history"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.pinemountainsettlementschool.com/history.php| title =History| publisher =Pine Mountain Settlement School| accessdate =2008-03-20| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080703153811/http://pinemountainsettlementschool.com/history.php| archive-date =2008-07-03| dead-url =yes| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1930, Pine Mountain became a boarding [[high school]], encouraging [[Vocational education|vocational]] and artistic development as well as academics.&lt;ref name="pine history"/&gt;
* In 1937, a [[Pack Horse Library Project|pack horse library]] was headquartered at Pine Mountain.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/eras/great-depression/wpa-travelling-libraries/|title=WPA Travelling Libraries - Social Welfare History Project|date=2014-04-12|work=Social Welfare History Project|access-date=2017-09-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13535361/|title=Mrs. M.A. James President of Asheville A.A.U.W.

* In 1949, Pine Mountain and the county educational system began to jointly operate an elementary school.&lt;ref name="pine history"/&gt;
* In the 1970s, Pine Mountain began to focus its efforts on [[environmental education]].&lt;ref name="pine history"/&gt;

In addition to operating as an educational institution, Pine Mountain Settlement School has served its community in other ways. For example, during Pine Mountain's time as a high school, it sponsored Work Experience Training, which gave men job training and helped them find employment. Pine Mountain has also operated as a farm, health clinic, and a supporter of local music and crafts. Today, in addition to cultural and environmental education, Pine Mountain Settlement School offers assistance to local low-performing students.&lt;ref name="ast national"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.alphasigmatau.org/alphasigmatau/?page_id=42| title =Pine Mountain Settlement School| publisher =[[Alpha Sigma Tau]]| accessdate =2008-03-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Alpha Sigma Tau===
[[Alpha Sigma Tau]] [[Fraternities and sororities|Sorority]] adopted Pine Mountain Settlement School as its national [[philanthropy]] in 1945.

Members of [[alumnus|alumnae]] and [[college|collegiate]] [[List of Alpha Sigma Tau chapters and colonies|chapters]] and [[Colony (fraternity or sorority)|colonies]] of Alpha Sigma Tau raise money annually for Pine Mountain Settlement School. The Sorority supports Pine Mountain Settlement School through the [[Alpha Sigma Tau National Foundation, Inc.]]

The '''Reifenstein schools''' ({{lang-de|Reifensteiner Schulen}}) were the various schools of higher education for women associated with the '''Reifensteiner Verband'''.

The concept was initiated by [[Ida von Kortzfleisch]], a Prussian noble woman and early German feminist. Reifenstein&amp;nbsp;refers to [[Reifenstein Castle|Reifenstein]] in [[Eichsfeld (district)|Eichsfeld]], a municipality in [[Thuringia]] and site of the first permanent school. From 1897 to 1990 the Reifensteiner Verband operated about 15 of its own schools and cooperated with further operators. About 40 ''wirtschaftliche Frauenschulen'', rural women economy schools were connected to the Reifenstein concept and movement. The association and its journals served as alumni network, provided a job placement service, strengthened [[Family and consumer science|home economics]]&amp;nbsp;([[Ecotrophology|Ekotrophology]]) as an academic discipline and were important for consumer advice and rural social services over all. About 90,000 women took the higher education courses. Some of the alumni, like [[Käthe Delius]], [[Marie Elisabeth Lüders|Marie-Elisabeth Lüders]] und [[Freya von Moltke]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; had an important role in German higher education and German society overall.

== Background ==
[[File:RSReifenstein1935Wäschepflege.jpg|thumb|Laundry classes in 1935]]
Under the German Empire until the early 20th century,  household services played a central role for the employment of women. Instead of a systematic training as in the dual system of vocational education, the education of women in the countryside happened often along a training on the job principle. Young men at this time often gained skils from winter schools and various professional educational institutions. The rural women's education (or their shortcomings) was being deemed a troubled sector and a main topic of the early women's movement.

Already a 1913 doctorate, Joachim Kramer's thesis about the household education in Germany refers to the ongoing reform aspects. The 1870s saw some progress; the first winter schools had been founded by the Badische Frauenverein, founded by [[Princess Louise of Prussia]] in the state of Baden.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Kramer, p. 30–35&lt;/ref&gt; While the winter schools lost their impact to permanent schools in [[Baden]] already before World War I, they gained importance in [[Bavaria]] in the 1920s. Kramer compared the German situation and the state of household education abroad.  Switzerland, Belgium and Austria had winter schools. The Austrian education for rural women was comparably backward, and Switzerland took a leading position. In France, housekeeping was a topic in primary schools, but not part of higher education. According to Kramer, Iowa and the state of New York in the United States were then leading in the field.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Kramer, 1913, §&amp;nbsp;11: Ländlich-hauswirtschaftliche Unterrichtsvorkehrungen im Auslande, p. 110–115&lt;/ref&gt;

The technical equipment and available technology for households gained importance in the 19th century. According to [[Hans Jürgen Teuteberg]], the household literature then started to address women. Earlier works, like the Hausväterliteratur ([[Lord|Hlaford]] books, a German kind of early economic literature) addressed the ''[[pater familias]]'', male and noble heads of larger rural households. Within the second half of the 19th century, women&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;as house mother or housewives&amp;nbsp;were being perceived and addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Jürgen Teuteberg, «Von der&amp;nbsp;Hausmutter&amp;nbsp;zur Hausfrau. Küchenarbeit im 18./ 19. Jahrhundert in der zeitgenössischen Hauswirtschaftsliteratur», in: Hans Jürgen Teuteberg (Hrsg.) Die Revolution am Esstisch:&amp;nbsp;neue Studien zur Nahrungskultur im 19.-20. Jahrhundert, Franz Steiner Verlag, 2004, u.a. S. 116 -119&lt;/ref&gt; The new role of the housewife as head of the household was being deemed a positive development first and only later as "how housewives were being made" being deemed negatively.&lt;ref&gt;Britta Oehlke, Wo Hausfrauen gemacht werden...Nordwestdeutsche Haushaltungsschulen und deren Einflüsse und Wirkungen vom ausgehenden 19. bis Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts. Dortmund: Wulff (2004), Univ., Diss., 2003. Münster (Westfalen),&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Ida von Kortzfleisch published an article in Tägliche Rundschau, a Berlin newspaper, called ''The Female compulsory service in the economist college for women.'' She responded to a series of articles by the writer [[Otto Leixner]] about the "Female Question" in Germany. Leixner had loathed the [[women's rights]] movement (as ''Weiberrechtlerinnen'') and he had deplored their alleged lack of patriotism. Kortzfleisch asked to establish a female service year, similar to the [[One-year volunteer|''Einjährige'']], a year of military service of male graduates of high schools. Ida von Kortzfleisch explicitly associated her efforts with women's right's as a citizen in the Kaiserreich.&lt;ref&gt;Both titles in Ortrud Wörner-Heil: Adelige Frauen als Pionierinnen der Berufsbildung: die ländliche Hauswirtschaft und der Reifensteiner Verband kassel university press GmbH, 2010, S. 245–246, Wörner-Heil quotes  Leixners Titel Zur Frauenfrage in Deutschland 1893, see [[Tägliche Rundschau]] from Nr. 220&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy distributed to establish higher education for women in the ''wirtschaftliche Frauenschule.''

The first classes started in Ofleiden, but was transferred to Reifenstein soon after. The states of Prussia provided an official acknowledgement in 1909.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Ortrud Wörner-Heil: Frauenschulen auf dem Lande 1997, S. 26–31&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, the Reifenstein association was admitted to the [[Bund Deutscher Frauenvereine]]. The conservative and basically Protestant background did not hinder a cooperation with the Jüdische Frauenbund (Jewish women's association), which established a Jewish Reifenstein school in Wolfratshausen in 1926. [[File:UnterrichtsraumRSBeinrode1930erunbek.jpg|thumb|Beinrode in the 1930s]]

The Reifenstein association and its schools was included in the [[Reichsnährstand]] in 1934. The noble background of various pupils and the close connection to the Protestant church lead to some clashes with the regime.  [[File:RSChattenbühl1960unbLehrküche.jpg|thumb|Chattenbühl in the 1960s]]

Bad Weilbach, Chattenbühl, Obernkirchen, Wittgenstein and Wöltingerode reopened 1946 in the western occupation zones. The eastern parts went into state ownership in 1947. Some of the schools in the far Eastern part of Prussia, e.g. the [[Landfrauenschule Metgethen]] have been destroyed during the end of war. The 1960s saw major changes in the concept, e.g. the end of the compulsory maiden costume. The first male student was admitted 1980. The last two schools closed down in the 1990s and are now part of a Protestant youth organization.

== Trivia ==
[[Marie Elisabeth Lüders|Marie-Elisabeth Lüders]] reported about mocking remarks from Berlin friends about the rural sites and background of the schools. [[:de:Carry Brachvogel|Carry Brachvogel]] provided material for improved household knowledge in Bavaria. She deplored the lack of quality cuisine in the free state of Bavaria and expected some improvements via the training courses provided by teachers trained in Reifenstein schools.&lt;ref name="Kratzer"&gt;Hans Kratzer: ''Sauguad. Das Bayerische Kochbuch gibt es seit 100 Jahren. Es spiegelt Küchen- und Technikgeschichte, Sprache und Zeitgeist wider. Und kochen lernt man damit auch.'', in: [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]], Nr. 244, 23. Oktober 2015, p. R15.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bayerische Kochbuch (Bavarian Cookbook), a still famous household item, is not about specific Bavarian menus, but is based on the experience of the school in Miesbach.&lt;ref name="Kratzer" /&gt;

== List of schools ==
The table contains schools owned by the Reifensteiner Verband. A further 25 schools have been associated with the Reifenstein concept, among them a school in [[Stift Finn]] in [[Estonia]] (1922&amp;ndash;1939) and Lehrfarm (training farm)  '''[[Brakwater]]''', near [[Windhoek|Windhuk]] in the then German colony of Südwestafrika ([[Namibia]]). The name of ''Maid'' (older German for Miss or maiden) refers to the acronym '''M'''ut, '''A'''usdauer, '''I'''dealismus und '''D'''emut (Courage, perseverance, idealism and humility). The symbols worne by the Maiden are valuable collectors items in the meanwhile, some tried to relate them with the ''Arbeitsmaiden'' of the [[Nazi]] ''[[Reichsarbeitsdienst]]'', which are however not connected in any way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4249">'''Sarah A. Gray''' (c. 1847 – January 8, 1893) was an American educator from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Virginia]].

==Biography==
Sarah A. Gray was born in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], [[Virginia]] to parents William and Laura Dundas Gray. As her father was [[Free negro|free]] and her mother was [[Manumission#United States|emancipated]], she was able to attend St. Francis School in [[Baltimore]] (an opportunity which was not afforded to most [[African Americans]] at the time, under [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]).&lt;ref name=vawomen&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/vawomen/2016/honoree.htm?bio=Gray |title=Sarah A.

As the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] progressed, many former slaves fled to Alexandria. To address the educational needs of their children, Gray and colleague Jane A. Crouch founded the St. Rose Institute, which remained open throughout the war.&lt;ref name=vawomen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWrxBwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT271&amp;pg=PT271 |title=Civil Disobedience: An Encyclopedic History of Dissidence in the United States |last=Snodgrass |first=Mary Ellen |publisher=[[Routledge]] |page=271 |isbn=9781317474401 |date=April 8, 2015 |access-date=October 31, 2016 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray established the Excelsior School in 1867, and became a teacher at Alexandria's first public school for black girls, Hallowell School, in 1870.&lt;ref name=alexandriava&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.alexandriava.gov/historic/blackhistory/?id=37214 |title=History of Alexandria's African American Community |publisher=City of [[Alexandria, Virginia]] |date=January 9, 2016 |access-date=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was named Hallowell's principal in 1883. During her tenure, she traveled to Northern states to study new educational methods and added [[high school]] classes to Hallowell's curriculum.&lt;ref name=vawomen/&gt;

She retired in 1892 for health reasons, and died in 1893.&lt;ref name=alexandriava/&gt;

==Honors==
In 1920, Hallowell School for Girls was consolidated with Snowden School for Boys. The combined institution was named Parker-Gray School, in honor of Sarah A. Gray and fellow African American educator John F. Parker.&lt;ref name=vawomen/&gt; After this closed, a new Parker-Gray High School was established in 1950. This remained open until 1965, when all Alexandria schools were [[Racial integration|integrated]]. In 1983, [[T. C. Williams High School]]'s stadium was renamed Parker-Gray Memorial Stadium.&lt;ref name=alexandriava/&gt; The original school also lent its name to [[Uptown–Parker–Gray Historic District|the surrounding neighborhood]].&lt;ref name="parker-gray.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parker-gray.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426155703/http://www.parker-gray.com/ |archivedate=2015-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alexandriava.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alexandriava.gov/planning/info/default.aspx?id=22154|title=Parker-Gray Historic District|work=alexandriava.gov|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''school bus contractor''' is a private company or proprietorship that provides [[student transport]] services to a school district or non-public school. Of the 450,000 school buses operating in the [[United States]], it is estimated that approximately 39% are operated by school bus [[independent contractor|contractor]]s. In [[Canada]] (with some still operated by the school boards) and the [[United Kingdom]], almost all school transportation is performed by contractors. 

A school bus contractor may range in size from an individual driver with a single bus, to a small company serving a single school or district, to a large multi-national company with as many as 60,000 buses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firststudentinc.com/about About First Student - School Bus Transportation Services Company]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Major school bus contractors currently operating in the United States and Canada include [[First Student (United States)|First Student]], [[National Express]], and [[Student Transportation Inc.]]

Shashi Caan is the founding partner of ''THE COLLECTIVE US / THE SC COLLECTIVE UK'' which provides architecture, interior, workplace and product design solutions focusing on supporting people both pragmatically and qualitatively &lt;ref&gt; http://www.sccollective.com/&lt;/ref&gt;.  
In 2013, Shashi Caan also founded ''GloW-DESIGN'' (Globally We Design), a global platform whose purpose is to generate and disseminate new design thinking, practice and processes to tackle the ever more pressing and contemporary problems facing humanity at large &lt;ref&gt; https://www.globallywedesign.com/&lt;/ref&gt;. In Singapore, in 2018, working with an international group of educators convened by the ''GloW-DESIGN'' program ''ReDesignEd, The GloW-DESIGN Educators Forum 2018'' formulated the ''Universal Design Educators Charter''.

'''''Space Odyssey: The Video Game''''' is an upcoming [[sandbox game|sandbox video game]] with [[4X]] elements being developed by Space Media Ventures for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Linux]], [[iOS]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] systems, including [[virtual reality]] devices, anticipated for release in December 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/neil-degrasse-tyson-wants-you-to-explore-deep-spacein-a-video-game/|title=Neil deGrasse Tyson wants you to explore deep space &amp;mdash; in a video game|first=Rhett|last=Allain|publisher=Wired|date=2017-07-27|accessdate=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is being co-developed by astrophysicist [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], and will have some educational aspects as the player designs and grows parts of a virtual galaxy.

==Gameplay==
Players in ''Space Odyssey'' are tasked with creating solar systems and larger stellar bodies in a virtual galaxy. This not only includes defining the planetary bodies within the system, but managing a [[spacefaring]] species as it harvests resources from those stellar bodies to expand its civilization through research, production, and trade to make said civilization successful. The game provides various challenges to players that, if completed successfully, rewards them with items to further help their species. Players will be able to share their creations with others and visit the systems that others have made.&lt;ref name="dt"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/neil-degrasse-tyson-voyages-into-gaming-with-space-odyssey/ | title = Expand Your Universe with Neil deGrasse Tyson's New Video Game | first = John | last = Gaudiosi | date = October 2, 2016 | accessdate = May 26, 2017 | work = [[Digital Trends]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial ideas for the game include a virtual assistant voiced by Tyson and a story that begins on [[Proxima B]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/neil-degrasse-tyson-kickstarter-space-odyssey-video-game-2017-6|title=Neil deGrasse Tyson crowdfunding 'Space Odyssey' video game|first=Kevin|last=Loria|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|date=2017-06-16|accessdate=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
''Space Odyssey'' is being developed by Space Media Ventures, and is a cooperative development including SMV's Creative Director, Mark Murphy and astrophysicist [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]]. According to Murphy, the goal of the game is to provide an experience similar to ''[[Minecraft]]'' and ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'' to encourage players to explore space.&lt;ref name="Mark Murphy - Creative Director"/&gt; While they recognize they wanted to make an educational game, Murphy said that they did not want it to be reduced to a series of quizzes or an open-ended world without any instruction, but instead make for a fun and interesting challenge to players of all ages.&lt;ref name="Mark Murphy - Creative Director"/&gt; Tyson was originally skeptical on the idea when the studio approached him, believing the game was aimed at young players, but they demonstrated their plans to target the game for all-ages, bringing him aboard the project.&lt;ref name="Mark Murphy - Creative Director"/&gt;

Tyson has input in the design of the game's challenges. The game is driven by real science and real physics, aspects which Tyson found crucial to creating a unique and compelling gaming experience. Further, Tyson, along with groups like [[Bigelow Aerospace]] and [[National Space Society]] have been consulted on the game to help provide ideas for realistic future technologies to be employed by the player.&lt;ref name="dt"/&gt; Tyson has worked with several guests from his talk show, ''[[StarTalk (2015 TV series)|StarTalk]]'', to help provide material in game to relate the science and understanding of game elements to the player.&lt;ref name="dt"/&gt; With the ability to share stellar systems among players, the developers have gotten Tyson, [[Len Wein]], [[the Star Talk All-Stars]],and [[Peter Beagle]] to participate in creating their own systems that players can visit and study.&lt;ref name="Mark Murphy - Creative Director"/&gt;

The title was announced in October 2016,&lt;ref name="dt"/&gt; and Space Media Ventures hosted an All-Star Panel featuring Tyson, [[James Gunn]], [[Kiki Wolfkill]], [[Randy Pitchford]] and moderated by [[Chris Hardwick]]  to launch the community build of the game during [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/neil-degrasse-tyson-presents-space-odyssey/space-odyssey-e3-2017 | title = Science man Neil deGrasse Tyson will be showing off his new game at E3 | first = Ben | last = Burns | date = May 26, 2017 | accessdate = May 26, 2017 | work = [[PCGamesN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; To help support development, the team started a [[Kickstarter]] crowd-funding campaign to raise $314,159 in mid-June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/16/neil-degrasse-tyson-space-odyssey/ | title = Neil deGrasse Tyson wants to take you on a 'Space Odyssey' | first=  Rob | last=  LeFebvre | date = June 16, 2017  | accessdate = June 16, 2017 | work = [[Engadget]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now also crowd-funding on Indiegogo.

'''St Edward's Secondary School''' is a public [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] secondary school in [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]]. Since its inception it has remained one of the country's most prestigious schools. While St. Edwards is designed to be an all-male school, female students are permitted to enroll as A Level candidates. It is affiliated with [[St. Edward's Primary School]].

St. Edwards has a long list of distinguished former pupils, including many of Sierra Leone's top ranking statesmen, presidents and prime ministers. The majority of the school's pupils have gone on the attend institutions of higher learning including [[Fourah Bay College]], [[Oxford University]], [[University of Cambridge]] and [[Harvard University]].

== History ==
St. Edward's origins began with [[St. Edward's Primary School]] which was established in 1865 by a French Roman Catholic priest, Rev. Father Edward Blanchet.[http://oldedwardians-ga.org/schoolhistory.asp] In 1921, the board of directors which consisted of a group of priests from [[Italy]], [[France]] and [[Ireland]] decided to start a secondary school for the students. On February 6, 1922, the new secondary school opened its doors to seven St. Edward's Primary School graduates: Anthony Tucker, Sylvester Tucker, James Massallay, Edward Farrah, William Luke, Joseph Luke and [[Albert Margai|Albert M. Margai]] - future prime minister of Sierra Leone. At that time, the secondary school was located at the same address as the primary school at Howe Street in Freetown. St. Edward's is the third oldest secondary school in Sierra Leone.

The first head master of St. Edward's was Father Michael O'Connor, but six months after the school opened, Father O'Connor retired due to illness and was replaced by Father Mulcahy.  Under the stewardship of Father Mulcahy, St. Edward's Secondary School became a first rate academic institution which followed a strict, old-fashioned [[United Kingdom|British]] curriculum and enforced discipline by means of [[corporal punishment]]. The sports programs at St. Edward's became a source of general admiration.

== Present ==
Today, the school continues to be managed by a board of directors and the disciplinary committee remains intact. St. Edward's has maintained its longstanding traditions, which include a Scripture Union, a Literary Society and a Debating Society. The school also has a boy scout troop known as 8th Freetown.

St. Edward's is still widely held to be one of the best schools in the country. On May 1, 2000, headmaster J.P. Kamara and the school's Parent/Teacher Association started a Development Committee to facilitate the expansion of the school.

== Past headmasters ==
Past headmasters include:

*'''Rev. Father Michael O'Connor''' (1922)
*'''Rev. Father Mulcahy''' (1922-1956) - the school's indefatigable and definitive founding father who devoted most of his life to St.Edward's. 
*'''Rev. Father Jeremiah O’Sullivan''' (1956-1979) - who introduced the co-ed sixth Form and founded the school band.
*'''Mr. A.J. Robinson''' (1979) - known affectionately as 'Sir Rob'.
*'''Rev. Father Curran'''
*'''Rev. Father Hamelberg''' - St. Edward's alumnus and Sierra Leone's first indigenous priest and headmaster. 
*'''Mr. M.A.C. Renner'''.
*'''Mr. J.P. Kamara ''' (2000) - Commonly known as 'The great Tizona'.

== House system ==
The house system at St. Edward's was instituted in 1934 by the school's second headmaster, Father Mulcahy, in order to encourage competitive sportsmanship among the pupils. Following the [[Eton College|Eton]] model, St. Edward's employs a system which divides the pupils into five houses. Each house has a House Captain and Games Captain. House Captains are usually selected from the sixth form students. Games Captains are chosen from the school's most talented athletes from Forms 4-6. Initially there were five houses, each with its own color and each named after the most reverend fathers who founded the school. They are: O'Gorman (Red), Browne (Green), Wilson (Dark Blue), Blanchet (Light Blue), and Mulcahy (Yellow). Later a sixth house was founded and named O'Sullivan. Its color is white.

There is inter-house competition during each semester culminating in an annual inter-school track-and-field championship. Houses also compete in extracurricular activities such as academic contests, debate and drama.

== School prefects ==
Members of the student body are elected as school prefects. St. Edward's Disciplinary Committee delegates the execution of various punishments to the school's council of prefects. Prefects are also responsible for the leadership of their fellow students in sport and academics. The House Captains and Games Captains are a part of the council.

== Athletics ==
St. Edward's is nicknamed "The Sports Academy". Throughout the school's history, athletics have been a prominent attribute of St. Edward's. The school is surrounded by sprawling fields where students can play sports and train in their respective disciplines. The land was acquired by former head master, Father Mulcahy, for the sole purpose of executing an ambitious athletics plan for the pupils. This remains a hallmark of St. Edward's even today. The school has produced a number of gifted sportsmen who play at national and international levels. Among them is football star [[Mohamed Kallon]] who began his career with the school team, [[Old Edwardians F.C.|Old Edwardians FC]] and went on to play for [[Inter Milan]]. Kallon is currently the captain of national team, the [[Leone Stars]].

== Performing arts ==
St. Edward's has excellent music and drama programs. The school band was founded by Father Jeremiah O'Sullivan during the middle half of the last century. The school also has an acclaimed dramatic society called St. Edward's Theater.

The school band is the most remarkable in the country’s history of school brass band music. They have won the Balanta Academy of Music Awards three times under the directorship of James Pratt, making them the only premier brass band in the country. They are regarded as the most successful school brass band after creating the first ever school jazz band section supported by the Balanta Academy of Music. The band is sometimes fondly referred to by other school band members as the Renner Brass band for the illustrious support the four sons of the late principal M.A.C Renner; namely Augustine M. Renner (alto saxophone) the current bandmaster, Jerry M. Renner (baritone) the music director, Christie J. Renner (trombone), Raymond D. Renner (trumpet) a former director and ex-member of the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces Regiment Band and the last Edward A. Renner (horn); the four are all-rounder’s in music as they can play just every instrument in the brass and woodwind section of the band.

Under the supervision of Rev. Fr. John Garrick, the band consists of 60 players with multi talents in choral and brass music. A few of them include Emmanuel Beal, a second lieutenant in the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces, Oluwole Compagnie-Coker, Abubakarr Barrie, Derrick Lewis, Joseph Senesi, Daniel Mettle, Abu Amadu, Christopher L.D Pratt (jr), Musa Sam Gandah, Henry Gagba, John Adowale Washington Williams, Victor Gordon, Silvanus Parkinson, Daniel Brown, Allieu Badarr, Joseph Macaulay, Michael Scott, Foday Mansaray, Timothy Bala Kamara, Mohamed Koroma and many others. The Band also has distance members in Europe and America such as Michael Kuwaite, Michael Kanyako, Theophilus Morrison, Augustine Thorpe, Dauda Sannoh, Foday Kanyako, Lyndon Pratt, Fredrick Hudor, Abdulai Turay, Elizabeth Kanja, Michael Faux, Dian Davies and lots more.

== Celebrations ==
St. Edward's celebrates February 6 as Foundation Day and October 13 as the Feast of St. Edward in honor of the school's patron saint, [[Edward the Confessor]].

== School uniform ==
Students of St. Edward's are easily distinguished by their uniform which consists of a white shirt, dark shorts and a matching tie. In a country where there is no free compulsory education, attending secondary school is a rare privilege and the school uniform is a badge of honor.

==School song==
&lt;poem&gt;
''St. Edward Patron of our school'' 
''And protector of our youth'' 
''Guide us in our search for truth'' 
''To the Holy Ghost Faithful'' 
''Instill in us true leadership'' 
''Model of Christian piety'' 
''So may we always honor thee'' 
''For all our lives to see''

''The name Edwardian proudly stands'' 
''In our country's honor roll'' 
''Inspiring us to follow close'' 
''Those who to great heights rose'' 
''With prayers our battle we shall fight'' 
''And all life's struggles win'' 
''We shall be loyal to our school'' 
''To our kith and kin''

''However far in days to come'' 
''Our lives may make us roam'' 
''The closest friends will be those made'' 
''In youth at boyhoods home'' 
''Sing hail to Edward king and saint'' 
''Confessor pure and chaste'' 
''Enjoying now that heavenly bliss'' 
''Which we soon hope to taste.'' 
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Old Edwardians ==
St. Edward's alumni are called Old Edwardians. While the school is open to all students regardless of their economic, social or religious background, it is a favorite of the Sierra Leonean [[oligarchy]] as it has produced an impressive number of statesmen and community leaders.  Some of the most famous Old Edwardians include former Prime Minister of Sierra Leone, [[Albert Margai|Sir Albert Margai]] and [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah|President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]]. The senior generation of Old Edwardians are sometimes criticized for being a [[United Kingdom|British]]-style [[old boy network]]. However, the alumni hold that they are most concerned with supporting their alma mater and contributing to the community. Among the younger generation of Old Edwardians, re-construction of the school is a key issue. The Georgia Chapter of St. Edward's Alumni Association runs a charity that raises funds to refurbish the school which was badly damaged during Sierra Leone's decade-long civil war.

'''Stephen Royce Benatar''' (born 26 March 1937) is an English author from London.&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite book|last=Kay|first=Ernest|title=The international authors and writers who's who|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bCkJuvdMyYC&amp;q=benatar|year=1986|publisher=International Biographical Centre|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first published novel, ''The Man on the Bridge'', was published in 1981. His second novel, ''Wish Her Safe at Home'', was published in 1982 and reissued in 2007 and 2010. He is known for [[self-publishing]] and self-promoting his novels.

==Writing career==
His first novel, written at the age of 19 and titled ''A Beacon In the Mist'', was rejected, as were 11 subsequent novels.&lt;ref name=cosmo/&gt; At the age of 44 his novel ''The Man on the Bridge'' was accepted by Harvester, and edited by Catharine Carver.&lt;ref name=cosmo/&gt; He received a £400 advance for the novel.&lt;ref name=express&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/172085/Stephen-Benatar-My-self-made-masterpiece-/Stephen-Benatar-My-self-made-masterpiece-Stephen-Benatar-My-self-made-masterpiece-Stephen-Benatar-My-self-made-masterpiece-Stephen-Benatar-My-self-made-masterpiece-|title=Stephen Benatar: my self-made 'masterpiece'|last=Edge|first=Simon|date=29 April 2010|work=Daily Express|accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second published novel, ''Wish Her Safe at Home'', was published by [[The Bodley Head]] the following year. The book was inspired by the 1947 film ''[[The Ghost and Mrs Muir]]''.&lt;ref name=cnj/&gt; It was runner-up for the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]].&lt;ref name=cosmo/&gt; He also won an [[Arts Council]] bursary.&lt;ref name=express/&gt; One novel, ''Such  Men Are Dangerous'', was published by [[Scunthorpe Borough Council]].&lt;ref name=cosmo/&gt; However, sales of his published books were poor, and he took to self-publishing subsequent novels, including ''Father Of The Man'', ''Recovery'' and ''The Golden Voyage Of Samson Groves''.

In 2007, he tried to get ''Wish Her Safe at Home'' republished as a Penguin Classic but they turned him down despite an introduction by Professor John Carey hailing it as a masterpiece. He was turned down by 36 other publishers, so after slightly rewriting some of the passages he self-published 4,000 copies under his own Welbeck Classics imprint.&lt;ref name=cosmo/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnj/&gt; He bumped into a man when returning some leftover wine from his book launch, and ask him to look at his book; he was Edwin Franks, the managing editor of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'''s publishing arm. Franks "read the book straight away and was knocked out", and ''The New York Review of Books'' published the novel in January 2010.&lt;ref name=cosmo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/books/imprints/classics/wish-her-safe-at-home/|title=Wish Her Safe At Home by Stephen Benatar, introduction by John Carey|work=NYRB|accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screen rights have been bought by a screenwriter who met Benatar in a bookshop,&lt;ref name=express/&gt; Henry Fitzherbert,{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.

'''''The New Yankee Workshop''''' is an American half-hour [[woodworking]] television series produced by [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] Boston, which aired on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. Created in 1989 by [[Russell Morash]], the program was hosted by [[Norm Abram]], a regular fixture on Morash's television series ''[[This Old House]]''.

==Overview==
''The New Yankee Workshop'' featured the construction of woodworking projects, including workshop accessories, architectural details and furniture projects ranging from simple pieces to complex, high-quality reproductions of antique classic furniture. In the course of 21 seasons, approximately 235 projects were produced. In addition to furniture and cabinets, the show also focused on outdoor projects such as the building of a gazebo, shed, greenhouse, sailing boat, flag pole, mail box, cupola, and fences. He also goes to different places that are related to woodworking.

==Theme song==
''The New Yankee Workshop'' theme song consists of a fast-paced guitar tune with a harmonica sound.

==Set design==
The shop where the show was produced is owned by Morash and is located on his property even though the viewer was given the impression that it was in Abram's backyard.

The shop is {{convert|936|sqft|m2}} in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyankee.com/about.php |title=New Yankee Workshop - About The New Yankee Workshop |publisher=Newyankee.com |date=2000-01-30 |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famous sliding barn door faces west. Along the west wall is the "back bench" and drill press. Along the south wall is the miter bench and storage unit, radial arm saw, and (not seen in episodes) a computer, a TV, and a small office area. The east wall of the shop has a staircase leading to a loft area, jig storage, horizontal edge sander, and dust collector. The north wall houses sheet goods, router table, bar clamps, Timesaver wide belt sander, planer, jointer, band saw, and various mobile tools. The center area of the shop consists of the table saw and associated outfeed tables as well as a large assembly table. In the northeast section of the building is a separate finishing room.

==Cancellation==
On October 16, 2009, WGBH Boston announced that no further episodes of ''New Yankee Workshop'' would be produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Potter |first=Tony |url=http://blogs.courant.com/roger_catlin_tv_eye/2009/10/norm-abram-closes-yankee-works.html |title=Norm Abram Closes 'Yankee Workshop' - Roger Catlin &amp;#124; TV Eye |publisher=Blogs.courant.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In remarking on the end of the show, Abram stated, "We've had a great run, built challenging projects, met wonderful woodworkers and received loyal support from millions of viewers." Abram later claimed that the entire duration of the show was fully funded through underwriting and could have kept going, but he decided he had accomplished everything he wanted to do and wanted to spend more time with his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84vE-2mSqtc |title=Festool Connect 2013 - Norm Abram |publisher=youtube.com |date=2013-03-21 |accessdate=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Episodes continue to be available on The New Yankee Workshop website.

==Award nominations==
* '''[[Daytime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Service Show''', Russell Morash (1997, 1998, 2000)
* '''Daytime Emmy Award for Single Camera Editing''', Gary Stephenson (1999)

==Pop culture reference==
The show was referenced in the second-season episode "[[Clueless (House)|Clueless]]" of ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''. The title character, Dr. [[Gregory House]] is asked why he has a season pass for ''The New Yankee Workshop'' on his [[TiVo]], and responds that "[i]t's a complete moron working with power tools. How much more suspenseful can you get?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/house/clueless.php?page=9 AU, Stop Poisoning Me With Gold] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009154122/http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/house/clueless.php?page=9 |date=2012-10-09 }}, ''[[Television Without Pity]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episodes==

Over the course of its 21 seasons, at least 235 projects were built on ''New Yankee Workshop''.

===Season 1 (1989)===
*The closing credits for the first eight seasons of ''The New Yankee Workshop'' consisted of an exterior shot of the workshop with a sign in it, as we see [[Norm Abram]] closing the workshop door, and gets ready to go home and have dinner with his family.
*On early episodes of this season, with the workshop door already opened, the dog is seen running away while Norm puts his tools away. For the rest of the entire season, after Norm puts his tools away, he moves the table, and the corner cupboard out of the way, and closes the workshop door.

===Season 10 (1998)===

Season 10 introduced a new episode numbering system. Previous seasons had been numbered in three digit format using the season number (1-9) as the first digit, and the episode number making up the last two digits. So, for example, the third episode of the 4th season would be episode number 403. Starting with this season, episode numbers consisted of four digits with the first two digits representing the last two digits of the  year in which the season first aired and the last two digits representing the episode number within that season. So, the fourth episode of the 10th season, having first aired in 1998, would be episode number 9804.

===Season 20 (2008)===

Season 20 varied slightly in format from previous seasons in that the first nine episodes were devoted to a single, larger project. This project involved a kitchen remodeling and focused on cabinet construction. The kitchen being remodeled belongs to Morash. Season 20 also represented the last season in which original projects were constructed for the show.

===Season 21 (2009)===

Season 21 stood out from other seasons in that it had approximately twice the number of episodes of any previous season. The season also varied from previous seasons in that no new projects were built. Instead each episode rebroadcast a project built in a previous season. All of the rebroadcast episodes were from either the ninth or tenth season. Each "new" episode consisted of the original episode prefaced by a newly recorded introduction by Abram.

The plan makes 13 commitments:
* Commitment 1: Beneficial ownership
* Commitment 2: Natural resource transparency
* Commitment 3: Anti-Corruption Strategy
* Commitment 4: Anti-Corruption Innovation Hub
* Commitment 5: [[Open Contracting Data Standard|Open contracting]]
* Commitment 6: Grants data
* Commitment 7: Elections data
* Commitment 8: Enhanced transparency requirements and revised [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] Code of Practice
* Commitment 9: Identifying and publishing core data assets
* Commitment 10: Involving data users in shaping the future of open data
* Commitment 11: Better use of data assets
* Commitment 12: [[GOV.UK]]
* Commitment 13: Ongoing collaborative approach to open government reform

For each commitment, the government has stated an ambition, a lead implementing organization and a timeline.

All countries participating in the [[Open Government Partnership]] are expected to co-create a National Action Plan with their civil society organisations. Open Government Partnership guidance states that "action plans should cover a two-year period and consist of a set of commitments that advance transparency, accountability, participation and/or technological innovation".&lt;ref&gt;Open Government Partnership,

== History ==
The student organization 'Kunsill Studenti Universitarji' (KSU) was founded in 1901.&lt;ref name="esu-online1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="davidcasa1"/&gt;

===Students' contribution===
The organization promotes and recognizes students contributions, given at the [[University of Malta]] and other related education institutions, which represents. KSU is a forum where students may express their opinion not related to their studies. The KSU gives an opportunity to contribute to the University of Malta.&lt;ref name="esu-online1"/&gt;

===Electoral system===

The electoral system is a first past the post one, whereby a block vote winning the majority of votes elects all its candidates, to the executive committee. This brought a system of block-voting between student organisations.

== Aims ==

The KSU is an evolving organization. It finds its roots in a set of simplified objectives.  Over the past century, since its foundation, the KSU has been working to:

*Represent students in whatever issues concern them, whether it is on a national or international level; 
*Serve as an official link between students and the relevant authorities; 
*Achieve the democratisation of education in Malta; 
*Coordinate the activities with other organizations; 
*Cultivate an interest in students in the fields of education, socio-political and cultural issues and 
*Assuring the highest possible quality level in Higher Education.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esu-online1"/&gt;

=== European Students' Union ===

On an international level, KSU is a full member of [[European Students' Union]] (ESU), the international union of students in Europe. The ESU represesnts 45 National Unions of Students in 34 European countries, including KSU. It represents over 10 million students European students. It is regarded by the European Commission, the Council of Europe, UNESCO, the Bologna Follow-up Group, the European University Association (EUA) and various other stakeholders in education as being the leading representative voice of students in Europe.  Throughout the years various Maltese Students have formed part of ESU Committees. KSU is an official founding member of MEDNET (Mediterranean Network of Student Representatives).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.erisee.org/sites/default/files/Report2013%20online.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924001857/http://www.erisee.org/sites/default/files/Report2013%20online.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hospital del Rey, University of Burgos campus.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Hospital del Rey&lt;/center&gt;]]

*'''San Amaro / Hospital del Rey:''' Located west of the city of Burgos exiting on the old road towards [[Portugal]] (N-620th) and [[León, Spain|León]] (N-120). Here are the rector, the central services, library, sports hall, residence and dining hall, the Faculties of Economics and Business, Law, Humanities and Education and the Polytechnic School.
*'''Río Vena / Vigón:''' Located north of the city in the direction of Cantabria N-623. This campus was the original seat of the Polytechnic School (dependent to the University of Valladolid) and the beginning of the current Polytechnic School of Burgos. Here you will also find the School of Business Studies and the School of Education.

===Other facilities===
*'''[[:es:Hospital de la Concepción (Burgos)|Hospital de la Concepción]]:''' Located in the south of the city center, just a few meters from the Burgos Cathedral, its construction dates back to the sixteenth century, though its façade is the seventeenth century. It served as an inn for pilgrims since its inception. In the year 1799 it became home to the Faculty of Medicine, which disappeared by the year 1817. In 2012 rehabilitation work was completed after an investment of more than 7 million euros. The building is now used by the University of Burgos.
*'''Residential and educational complex [http://www.residenciasedano.com/noticias/residencia/ "Miguel Delibes"]''' located in Sedano in the [[Valle de Sedano|Valley of Sedano]] (50&amp;nbsp;km/31&amp;nbsp;mi north of Burgos).

== Hospital del Rey ==

The "Hospital del Rey" now central to the University's campus, is located along the [[Way of St. James|Way of Saint James]] (Camino de Santiago) passing through west Burgos. It was founded by [[Alfonso VIII]] in 1195. Together with the [[Monastery of Santa María la Real de las Huelgas|Monastery of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas]] it was a great shelter for pilgrims. Upon entry is the shrine of French saint San Amaro and the cemetery where they buried the pilgrims who died in the hospital.

The Hospital del Rey was built during the [[Renassance|Renaissance]], and retains some remnants of the early [[medieval]] hospital (such as the pillars of the old church). The entrance is through the [[Romero]]s Gate - now a symbol of the University. It is an arch decorated on both sides, with [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]]-era references, as well as portraits of the founders (Alfonso VIII and Queen Eleanor).

Access to the Patio de los Romeros, is occupied by the Hospital's church which displays a [[Baroque]]-style interior. The atrium of the church opens to a section of the school used for ceremonial events. Here you will find the House of Sacristans - the Dean of the School of Law, access to the cafeteria, and the Rectorate building. Here in the beautiful garden setting is the "chessboard" where in summer there are musical activities to coincide with the summer courses at the university.

Various restorations to the remains of the facility earned it the "[[Europa Nostra]]" award.

==History==
[[File:Doug Girod (cropped).jpg|thumb|150px|[[Douglas Girod]], KU's current chancellor, previously on staff at KU Medical Center]]
{{Main|History of the University of Kansas}}
On February 20, 1863, Kansas Governor [[Thomas Carney]] signed into law a bill creating the state university in Lawrence.&lt;ref name="KHS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kshs.org/p/kansas-historical-quarterly-the-university-of-kansas/13175|title=History of KU - Kansas Historical Society|website=Kshs.org|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was conditioned upon a gift from Lawrence of a $15,000 endowment fund and a site for the university, in or near the town, of not less than forty acres (16 ha) of land.&lt;ref name=Griffin&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffin|first=C.S.|title=The University of Kansas and the Years of Frustration, 1854–64 |url=http://www.kshs.org/publicat/khq/1966/66_1_griffin.htm|accessdate=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Lawrence failed to meet these conditions, [[Emporia, Kansas|Emporia]] instead of Lawrence would get the university.

The site selected for the university was a hill known as Mount Oread, which was privately donated by [[Charles L. Robinson]], Republican governor of the state of Kansas from 1861 to 1863, and one of the original settlers of Lawrence, Kansas. Robinson and his wife Sara bestowed the {{convert|40|acre|ha|adj=on}} site to the State of Kansas in exchange for land elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt; The philanthropist [[Amos Adams Lawrence]] donated $10,000 of the necessary endowment fund, and the citizens of Lawrence raised the remaining money themselves via private donations.&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt; On November 2, 1863, Governor Carney announced Lawrence had met the conditions to get the state university, and the following year the university was officially organized.&lt;ref name=Cyclopedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History|url=http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/1912/u/university_of_kansas.html |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504195727/http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/1912/u/university_of_kansas.html|archivedate=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The school's Board of Regents held its first meeting in March 1865, which is the event that KU dates its founding from.&lt;ref name=Established/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KU150|url=https://ku150.ku.edu/|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on the first college building began later that year.&lt;ref name=Cyclopedia/&gt; The university opened for classes on September 12, 1866, and the first class graduated in 1873.&lt;ref name=Cyclopedia/&gt; According to William L. Burdick, the first degree awarded by the university was a [[Doctor of Divinity]], bestowed upon noted abolitionist preacher [[Richard Cordley]].&lt;ref name=xiii&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burdick|first1=William L. |title=Sermons|date=1912|publisher=Bumford Press|location=[[Concord, NH]]|page=xiii |url=https://archive.org/stream/sermonsbyrichard00cord/sermonsbyrichard00cord_djvu.txt|chapter=An Appreciation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, Kansas was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name="kansas-v-12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ku.edu/~kunrotc/about.shtml|title=History of the Jayhawk Battalion|publisher=[[Lawrence, Kansas]]: University of Kansas|accessdate=September 27, 2011|year=2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6A2aTwVe0?url=http://www2.ku.edu/~kunrotc/about.shtml|archivedate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Review'' typically features the work of many writers, but periodically spotlights one author, as in the case of 2006 Nelson Poetry Book Award-winner ''Voyeur Poems'' by Matthew Porubsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://skyways.lib.ks.us/orgs/kac/2006convention/2006winnerreviews.html|title=2006 Award Winner Reviews ~ Kansas Authors Club|website=Skyways.lib.ks.us|accessdate=October 12, 2014|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110135602/http://skyways.lib.ks.us/orgs/kac/2006convention/2006winnerreviews.html|archivedate=November 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawrence.com/news/2006/dec/02/poet_wellversed_voyeurism/ "Poet well-versed in voyeurism" ~ Lawrence.com], December 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''University Daily Kansan'' operates outside of the university's William Allen White School of Journalism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journalism.ku.edu/welcome-dean|title=Welcome from the Dean|website=Journalism.ku.edu|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reaches at least 30,000 daily readers through its print and online publications&lt;ref&gt;[[University Daily Kansan]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The university houses the following public broadcasting stations: [[KJHK]], a student-run [[campus radio]] station, [[KUJH-LP]], an [[independent station]] that primarily broadcasts public affairs programs, and [[KANU-FM|KANU]], the [[NPR]]-affiliated radio station. Kansas Public Radio station KANU was one of the nation's first [[public broadcasting|public radio]] stations. KJHK, the campus radio has roots back to 1952 and is completely run by students.

'''VideoBook''' is a brand of online, interactive educational videos marketed by Studio 21.

==History==
The name "VideoBook" was first registered and used in the United Kingdom (UK) in 1982 by Barry R. Pyatt, the owner of Yorkshire film producers "Studio 21." VideoBook was the marque, trading title and style for local-interest and sell-through video films. The name VideoBook was in commercial use by Studio 21 in the UK and Spain until 2003. In 2004, Pyatt opened AngelFilms in Spain, which took over the VideoBook marque. In 2005, AngelFilms-UK was established, and in 2008, VideoBook products were re-launched in the UK.

==Marque==
Video Books are identified and registered with the ISBN agencies. The trademark style is as one word, with uppercase V and uppercase B, in a modified Bookman typeface, and is Pyatt's exclusive property.

The name "videobook" (without the two uppercase characters) has become a standard term for a form of [[online training]] that delivers downloadable training videos. Most video books are single website entities that focus on teaching a particular topic.

Video books are similar in content and structure to a "regular" book. The videos are typically recorded by a trained instructor and offered to the viewer on a subscription model. The user visits the video book (the website containing the training videos), purchases a subscription and can then download the videos.

Video Books are different from many [[Computer-based training]] (CBT) models in that they are typically in a shareable and portable format. They also differ in content delivery.

In contrast to printed books and audio books which rely solely on text and audio, respectively, the basic component of a videobook is video. The video book can have on-screen text along with pictures and video clips. The text may be animated along with related audio background commentary.

The student can watch videos in any order. Once downloaded, no Internet connection is necessary. The videos use non-proprietary formats. The target market is usually an individual instead of an organization. Videobook materials may involve presentation software such as [[PowerPoint]], screen-capture software such as [[Camtasia]] and [[text-to-speech software]], such as TextAloudMP3.

Paid Videobook (online, offline) - videobook online(offline) using the private information in the form of thoughts of a person registered on the Internet project has temporal properties: time, date, month, year of writing. Copyrights are registered online on authoritative sources confirmed . Payment for the information contained in the paid videobook takes place in credit, after reading it.

'''Westminster International University in Tashkent (WIUT)''' is [[Uzbekistan]]'s first international university. The university is the first in Central Asia to offer a Western education, with UK qualifications. WIUT was established in 2002 in conjunction with the "UMID" Presidential Foundation, the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Specialised Education and the [[University of Westminster]] in London.

The objective of establishing WIUT was to provide an international standard of Higher Education in Uzbekistan to enable citizens of Uzbekistan and other countries to obtain an internationally recognised [[Bachelor]] education in [[Business Administration]], [[Information technology|Business Information Systems]], Economics and [[Commercial Law]], all validated by the [[University of Westminster]].

The first intake of students began their studies in October 2002 and the new university premises were inaugurated in spring 2003.  WIUT has now an alumni 400 graduates and has established itself as the premier International University in Central Asia.{{Citation needed|reason=Who claims WIUT to be the premier IU in Central Asia, and on what measures?|date=September 2016}} The university has been developed and is managed on UK/International principles and practices.

WIUT's graduates continue their career/education in top companies and other universities.

The WIUT Masters programme explores and enables one to develop an understanding of the global environment, to focus on the key business issues and functions required to work in an international environment and develop skills required of an international manager. This requires WIUT to deliver the programme to the highest international standards and to ensure the highest quality delivery.

It is delivered in English and if one is not a native English speaker or have an international bachelor's degree, taught and assessed in English then you have to demonstrate a high-level English language proficiency ([[IELTS]] 6.5 or [[TOEFL]] 100 (IBT) or [[TOEFL]] 250 (CBT) at least).

* '''Certificate of International Foundation Studies (CIFS)'''
:The Certificate in International Foundation Studies (CIFS) is a one-year course. The aim of the course is to prepare students for successful study at honours degree level. As a [[University of Westminster]] award it is recognized as an entry qualification for degree courses in many universities around the world.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}
:Students who successfully complete the CIFS will automatically qualify for progression onto one of Westminster International University in [[Tashkent]] degree-level programmes. They will also qualify for entry to related courses at the [[University of Westminster]] in London.

'''Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Business Administration (BA Business Administration)'''

:The BA (Hons) in Business Administration is a three-year full time course recognized around the world. It is based upon the BA (Honours) Business course delivered in the UK by the Harrow Business School of the [[University of Westminster]], but has been adapted to suit the local context. The BA (Hons) Business Administration aims to give students an education in the key areas of business, providing an understanding of underpinning theories, tools and techniques.
* '''Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Economics (BSc Economics)'''
:The BSc (Hons) Economics is a three-year full-time course. It is based upon the BSc (Hons) Business Economics course delivered in the UK by the Westminster Business School of the [[University of Westminster]], adapted to suit the local context. The BSc (Hons) in Economics is not intended as a purely theoretical study of economics. The underlying philosophy of the course and its presentation emphasise the application of the relevant theory underpinning the Economics and Business fields.
* '''Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Business Information Systems (BSc Business Information Systems)'''
:The BSc (Hons) Business Information Systems is a three-year full-time course. It is based upon the BSc (Hons) Business Computing course delivered in the UK jointly by the Harrow Business School and the Harrow School of Computer Science of the [[University of Westminster]]. The BSc (Hons) Business Information Systems aims to develop students with skills in the areas of systems analysis and database development as well as finance and marketing with an awareness of a wide range of managerial and organizational issues. The underlying philosophy of the course is to emphasise the close relationship between information technology and business with the application of the relevant theory underpinning IT enabled business practices.
* '''Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Commercial Law (BA Commercial Law)'''

:The BA (Hons)Commercial Law is a three-year full-time course. The BA Commercial Law, programme consists of subject areas found on an English law degree such as that taught at the [[University of Westminster]] in London. However, at WIUT the focus in many modules is primarily Uzbek law with some English (or other legal jurisdiction) content to enable a comparison between two different legal systems. The course balances the need to provide a basic understanding of Uzbek law, with a commercial and international focus, within a broadly liberal legal curriculum. The course has been designed by the Law School of the [[University of Westminster]]; it is currently{{When|date=May 2015}} undergoing further refinements and will be focused on International and Business Law.

The courses are validated by the [[University of Westminster]] (UK), which awards the qualification. The Certificate in Foundation Studies is accepted as an entry qualification for UK degrees. Successful completion will enable the student to progress to a UK degree course.
The Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science are standard UK three-year programmes.
