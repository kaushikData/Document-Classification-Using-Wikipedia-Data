      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1708">'''Abdul Alim''', also transliterated '''Abdul Aleem''', ({{lang-ar| عبد العليم}}) is a male Muslim given name. It is built from the Arabic words ''[[Abd (Arabic)|Abd]]'', ''[[al-]]'' and ''[[wikt:عالم#Arabic|Alim]]''. The name means "servant of the All-knowing", ''Al-'Alīm'' being one of the [[names of God in the Qur'an]], which give rise to the [[List of Arabic theophoric names|Muslim theophoric names]].&lt;ref name=ahmed&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author=Salahuddin Ahmed| publisher = Hurst &amp; Company| location=London| year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rahman&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author= S. A. Rahman| publisher=Goodword Books|  location=New Delhi| year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter ''a'' of the ''al-'' is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by ''u''. So the first part can appear as Abdel, Abdul or Abd-al. The second part can be spelled ''Alim'' or ''Aleem'', or in other ways, with the whole name subject to variable spacing and hyphenation. 

It may refer to:
*[[Abdul Aleem Siddiqi]] (1892–1954), Bangladeshi Sufi teacher
*[[Abdulalim A. Shabazz]] (born 1927), American mathematician
*[[Abdul Alim (folk singer)]] (1931–1974), Bangladeshi folk musician
*[[Abdul Alim Musa]] (born 1945), American Muslim activist
*Issam Abdel-Tawab Abdel Alim, full name of [[Issam Alim]], convicted in Egypt for terrorist offences
*[[Prof. Abdul Aleem]] (former Vice-Chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2803">'''Abdul Sattar''' ({{lang-ar| عبدُالستّار }}) is a male Muslim given name, built on the Arabic words ''[[Abd (Arabic)|Abd]]'', ''[[al-]]'' and ''[[Sattar (disambiguation)|Sattar]]''. The name means "servant of the Veiler (of sins)".&lt;ref name=ahmed&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author=Salahuddin Ahmed| publisher = Hurst &amp; Company| location=London| year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rahman&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author= S. A. Rahman| publisher=Goodword Books|  location=New Delhi| year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the letter s is a [[sun and moon letters|sun letter]], the letter l of the ''al-'' is usually assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written with letters corresponding to ''Abd al-Sattar'', the usual pronunciation corresponds to ''Abd as-Sattar''. Alternative transliterations include ''Abdus Sattar'', ''Abd al-Sattar'' and others, all subject to variant spacing and hyphenation.

'''Allen Bernard West''' (born February 7, 1961)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=W000807|title=WEST, Allen - Biographical Information|website=bioguide.congress.gov|access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American political commentator, retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel, and former member of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], West represented {{ushr|FL|22}} in the House from 2011 to 2013.

West was born in Georgia and joined the [[United States Army]] in 1983. He was deployed to [[Kuwait]] in 1991 and [[Iraq]] in 2003. In 2003, West was charged in an incident that involved the beating and simulated execution of an Iraqi policeman. After an [[Article 32 hearing]] was held, West accepted [[non-judicial punishment]], was fined $5,000, and allowed to retire as a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/12/12/sprj.nirq.west.ruling/|title=CNN.com – U.S. officer fined for harsh interrogation tactics – Dec. 13, 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the military, he and his family moved to Florida, where he taught at a high school for a year and worked for a defense contractor, part of this time spent in Afghanistan as a civilian adviser to the [[Afghan National Army]]. West entered politics in 2008 as the Republican nominee for Florida's 22nd congressional district [[United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2008#District 22|in 2008]], losing to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent [[Ron Klein]]. In a re-match [[United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2010#District 22|in 2010]], he won the seat, coinciding with significant Republican gains in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]].

West took office in January 2011 as the first African-American Republican Congressman from Florida since [[Josiah T. Walls]] left office in 1876 near the end of [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minority candidates rack up poll history|date=November 3, 2010|url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/index.php/news/content/view/full/97219|work=London Morning Star|accessdate=November 3, 2010|quote=In Florida Allen West is the first black Republican to have been elected to Congress from Florida since the 1870s.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105114402/http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/index.php/news/content/view/full/97219|archivedate=November 5, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Congress, West served on the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services]] and [[United States House Committee on Small Business|Small Business Committees]] and was a high-profile member of the [[Tea Party Caucus]] and the [[Tea Party movement]].&lt;ref name="MJones2012"/&gt;

[[Redistricting]] due to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] resulted in West switching to {{ushr|FL|18}} for the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2012|2012 House elections]].

Allen West entered politics in [[United States congressional elections, 2008|2008]] to regain the lost House seat, challenging freshman incumbent Klein. West received the Republican nomination without opposition. However, he lost to Klein by a margin of 9.4% of the votes.

Redistricting made the 22nd, which already had a modest Democratic lean, even more Democratic.  West faced the prospect of running against West Palm Beach mayor [[Lois Frankel]] in the general election.  On February&amp;nbsp;1, 2012, West announced that he would run for reelection in the neighboring 18th District.  That district had previously been the 16th, represented by fellow Republican [[Tom Rooney (politician)|Tom Rooney]].  However, Rooney opted to seek reelection in the newly created 17th District, a move that was considered likely to dramatically improve West's chances of reelection, although it was still a competitive race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57369491-503544/allen-west-to-seek-reelection-in-new-district|title=CBS News Political Hot Sheet for February 1, 2012|publisher=CBS|accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the new district, West received a primary challenge from [[Martin County, Florida|Martin County]] Sheriff Robert Crowder. West did not debate Crowder and said "debating an uninformed opponent would waste voters' time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/allen-west-commentary-debating-uninformed-opponent/nPkPf/|title=Allen West commentary: Debating uninformed opponent would waste voters’ time|author=Allen West|work=Palm Beach Post|date=July 3, 2012|accessdate=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incumbent West defeated Crowder in a landslide, receiving 74.4% of the vote.

His general election opponent was Democrat Patrick Murphy, a political newcomer and a Republican until 2011. The campaign featured several negative ads, including one released by American Sunrise PAC that was extremely critical of West's policies and depicted him in violent cartoon action against several individuals. West issued a statement condemning the ad, stating that it "plays on stereotypes" with the goal of diverting Americans from more pressing matters at hand such as high unemployment. He claimed the ad was released by the family of his opponent. The campaign manager of his opponent, said the ad was from a third party and therefore held no liability for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Campaign Ad Shows Allen West Punching Women In The Face|author=Jennifer Bendery|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/09/allen-west-campaign-ad-punching_n_1762385.html|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=August 9, 2012|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After primary opponent Crowder endorsed Murphy, a spokesman of the West campaign said "Crowder is a Democrat and a sore loser. I'm shocked he waited this long. Perhaps Crowder hopes to continue cozying up to local Democrats so he can be their nominee against Allen West in 2014."

Initial vote counts showed Murphy defeating West by a narrow margin of 2,000&amp;nbsp;votes.

==Stand-up comedy==
From 1985 Le Mar cut her teeth on the comedy circuit, by initially doing open spots and warm-ups at events such as fashion shows and parties within the black community. She later rose to prominence on the emerging black comedy circuit in the 1990s, sharing the stage with established comedians such as [[Felix Dexter]], [[Curtis Walker]], [[Ishmael Thomas]] and [[Leo Chester]] all members of the BBC comedy series ''The Real McCoy''. Her popularity earned her the title "The Queen of Black Comedy".

Her reputation took her to the mainstream circuit where she became a regular act at established comedy clubs including [[Up The Creek]], [[Jongleurs]] and [[The Comedy Store]], culminating in Le Mar performing her sell-out one woman show ''Off The Hook'' at the [[Apollo Theatre]], Shaftesbury Avenue, in 2000.

While working as a radio presenter on Choice FM, Le Mar was moved by a call she received on her phone in show from a distressed young lady who had been abused by her boyfriend.

The play premiered at the Hackney Empires' ''Acorn Theatre'' and ran for eight weeks. It was toured throughout the London Region and the suburbs between 2008 and 2009, and played at the [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]], Gilded Balloon in August 2010.

'''Anthony Perrinott Lysberg Barber, Baron Barber''', [[Territorial Decoration|TD]], [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]], [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]] (4 July 1920 – 16 December 2005) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[politician]] who served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].

After serving in both the [[Territorial Army (UK)|Territorial Army]] and the [[Royal Air Force]] during the Second World War, Barber studied at Oxford and became a barrister. Elected as MP for [[Doncaster (UK Parliament constituency)|Doncaster]] in 1951, Barber held various posts in government under [[Harold Macmillan]], including [[Economic Secretary to the Treasury]], [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]] and [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]]. After losing his seat in 1964, he won the [[Altrincham and Sale by-election, 1965|1965 by-election]] in [[Altrincham and Sale (UK Parliament constituency)|Altrincham and Sale]] and returned to Parliament.

Barber was appointed as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] by [[Edward Heath]] in 1970, and oversaw a major liberalisation of the banking system, replaced [[purchase tax]] and [[Selective Employment Tax]] with [[Value-added tax (United Kingdom)|Value Added Tax]], and also relaxed [[exchange control]]s. During his term the economy suffered due to [[stagflation]] and industrial unrest, including a miners strike which led to the [[Three-Day Week]]. In 1972 he delivered a budget which was designed to return the Conservatives to power in an election expected in 1974 or 1975. This budget led to a period known as "The Barber Boom". The measures in the budget led to high inflation and wage demands from public sector workers. He was forced to introduce anti-inflation measures, along with a [[Prices Commission]] and a [[Pay Board]]. After the Conservatives lost the first election in 1974, he did not stand in the second election of that year. Barber became Chairman of [[Standard Chartered Bank]] until 1987 and died in 2005.

== Birth and early life ==
Barber was the third son of John Barber and his [[Denmark|Danish]] wife, Musse. His birth was registered in [[Sculcoates]], a suburb of [[Kingston upon Hull]]. Barber's unusual middle names arose from his mother, who contributed the "Lysberg", and French grandmother, who contributed the "Perrinott". His father was secretary-director of a [[Doncaster]] [[confectionery]] works. He had two brothers: [[Noel Barber|Noel]], who became a well-known journalist and novelist, and Kenneth, who became secretary of [[Midland Bank]].

Barber was educated at [[Retford Oaks High School|King Edward VI Grammar School]] in [[Retford]], [[Nottinghamshire]]. He became an [[articled clerk]], but joined the [[King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry]] shortly before the [[Second World War]] started. He was commissioned into the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] [[Royal Artillery]] in 1939 and served in France with a unit from [[Doncaster]] as part of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]]. He was evacuated from [[Dunkirk]] in 1940, but later he became a [[Aircraft pilot|pilot]] in the [[No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit RAF|Photographic Reconnaissance Unit]] of the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]. He ran out of fuel on a reconnaissance mission on 25 January 1942 and ditched near Mont St Jean, but was captured by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]].

He was [[mentioned in dispatches]] for helping escapes from the prison camp at [[Stalag Luft III]]; he himself once escaped as far as [[Denmark]]. His PoW experiences were recalled by his friend and fellow RAF pilot PoW [[Thomas D. Calnan]] who met Barber at [[Oflag IX-A/H]] at [[Spangenberg]] in February 1942:

:"Complete uniforms were rare in our party, the one outstanding exception belonging to Tony Barber, who was resplendent in an Army lieutenant's uniform, complete with [[Sam Browne belt|Sam Browne]]."&lt;ref&gt;Calnan (1973), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Barber is a prominent figure throughout Calnan's book:

:"It was natural that Charles Hall, Tony Barber and I should plot escape together. We had known one another at [[RAF Benson|Benson]], before being shot down and we still felt that we all belonged to the same unit."&lt;ref&gt;Calnan (1973), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Barber also wrote a brief foreword to this volume: "What has struck me most forcibly is how, after more than twenty years, he has recounted our adventures with such accuracy. He has managed to make a reality, once again, of the hopes and fears, the depression and the excitement which, for most of us who were there, now seems more like a dream."&lt;ref&gt;Calnan (1973), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

While still a prisoner, Barber took a law degree with first-class honours through the [[International Red Cross]]. On his return to [[England]], he was awarded a state grant to [[Oxford University]], where he took a degree in [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics]] in two years at [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]], and a scholarship to the [[Inner Temple]]. He then practised as a [[barrister]] from 1948, and specialised in [[tax]]ation. From 1967 to 1970 he was chairman of Redfearn National Glass, with which his wife Jean's family was connected.

== House of Commons ==
Anthony Barber stood in [[Doncaster (UK Parliament constituency)|Doncaster]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950 general election]] but lost by 878 votes. He contested the seat again at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|1951 general election]], however, and beat the incumbent [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]], [[Raymond Gunter]] by 384 votes. He held a series of offices: [[Parliamentary private secretary]] to [[George Ward, 1st Viscount Ward of Witley|George Ward]] (Under Secretary for Air) from 1952 to 1958; junior Government [[whip]] from 1955 to 1958; and [[Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister]], [[Harold Macmillan]] from 1958 to 1959. He then served four years as a junior minister in the [[Treasury]], [[Economic Secretary to the Treasury]] from 1959 to 1962, and, following the "[[Night of the Long Knives (1962)|Night of the Long Knives]]" on 13 July 1962, as [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]] from 1962 to 1963 (under the Chancellorships of [[Derick Heathcoat Amory]], [[Selwyn Lloyd]] and [[Reginald Maudling]]). He became a [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] minister, as [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]], in 1963, but lost his seat in the Commons in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 general election]] to Labour's [[Harold Walker, Baron Walker of Doncaster|Harold Walker]].

His absence from Parliament was short-lived, as he won a [[Altrincham and Sale by-election, 1965|1965 by-election]] in [[Altrincham and Sale (UK Parliament constituency)|Altrincham and Sale]] caused by the elevation to the peerage of [[Frederick James Erroll, 1st Baron Erroll of Hale|Frederick Erroll]]. In opposition, he led [[Ted Heath]]'s campaign to become Conservative party leader in 1965, and became party chairman in 1967. The Conservatives won the general election in 1970, and Barber held his seat until the general election of [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974]], when he himself entered the House of Lords.

== Chancellor of the Exchequer ==
After winning the election in 1970, [[Edward Heath]] appointed Barber as [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] and gave him the responsibility for negotiating the entry of the UK into the [[European Economic Community]]. However, following the sudden death of [[Iain Macleod]] on 20 July, only 6 weeks after the election, Barber became the new [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. His appointment prompted Harold Wilson to remark that it was the first time that he had realised that Heath had a sense of humour. In line with the initial liberal instincts of Heath's 1970 government, he oversaw a major liberalisation of the banking system under the title of '[[Competition and Credit Control]]', leading to a high level of lending, much of it to speculative property concerns. In his first [[Budget]], in March 1971, he proposed to replace [[purchase tax]] and [[Selective Employment Tax]] with [[Value Added Tax (United Kingdom)|Value Added Tax]], and also relaxed [[exchange control]]s; both were prerequisites to membership of the EEC. [[Value Added Tax (United Kingdom)|VAT]] came into force in 1973 at a standard rate of 10%. A year later, the rate was cut to 8%.

Barber also reduced [[direct tax]]es. High levels of economic growth followed, but the traditional capacity constraints of the British economy - especially [[currency]] and [[balance of trade]] concerns - quickly choked the economic boom. The banking system fell towards crisis as the bubble burst.

During his term the economy suffered due to [[stagflation]] and industrial unrest. In 1972 he delivered a budget which was designed to return the Conservative Party to power in an election expected in 1974 or 1975. This budget led to a period known as "The Barber Boom". The measures in the budget led to high inflation and wage demands from Public Sector workers. He was forced to introduce anti-inflation measures in September 1972, along with a [[Prices Commission]] and a [[Pay Board]]. The inflation of capital asset values was also followed by the [[1973 oil crisis]] which followed the [[Yom Kippur War]], adding to inflationary pressures in the economy and feeding industrial militancy (already at a high as a result of the struggle over the [[Industrial Relations Act 1971]]).

In 1972, having said a week earlier in the House of Commons that he had "no reason to believe that the pound was overvalued", he floated it (most of the world currencies were floated at that time) "as a temporary measure". The pound immediately plunged on the markets, and it was impossible during his time as Chancellor to impose a new parity. It has remained floating ever since.

After a strike by the miners, and a [[Three-Day Week]], Heath called for a general election on 28 February 1974 with the slogan "Who governs Britain?" The election returned a minority Labour government and [[Harold Wilson]] as Prime Minister.

== Later years ==
Barber did not seek re-election at the general election of October 1974, and left front-line politics. He was made a [[life peer]] on 6 January 1975 as '''Baron Barber''' of [[Wentbridge]] in the County of [[West Yorkshire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=46459 |date=9 January 1975 |page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as Chairman of [[Standard Chartered Bank]] from 1974 to 1987, where future Prime Minister [[John Major]] was his personal assistant. In 1987, he was appointed to be a [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of the County of West Yorkshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=50816 |date=29 January 1987 |page=1185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barber was also a director of [[BP]] from 1979 to 1988. He visited [[Nelson Mandela]] in prison, and was a member of the Franks Committee that investigated the [[Falklands War]]. In 1991, he became chair of the RAF Benevolent Association’s appeal for the 50th anniversary of the [[Battle of Britain]], which raised £26 million.

He suffered from [[Parkinson's disease]] in later years, and died in [[Suffolk]] in 2005. He was married twice, with two daughters from his first marriage.

'''Anukulchandra Chakravarty''' (14 September 1888 – 27 January 1969) popularly known as '''Sree Sree Thakur''', was the founder of Satsang, in [[Deoghar]] &lt;ref name=EB1&gt;{{cite web |title= Deoghar Tourism |url= http://deoghar.nic.in/deoghar_tourism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB2&gt;{{cite web |title= Baba Baidyanath Temple |url=http://www.babadham.org/otherplaces/satsang.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB3&gt;{{cite news |title=Politicians turn devotees at Satsang Vihar event |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/Politicians-turn-devotees-at-Satsang-Vihar-event/articleshow/30418116.cms |newspaper=Times of India |date=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 September 1946 before the [[Partition of India]], Anukulchandra moved to [[Deoghar]] in India from his birthplace Himaitpur, [[Pabna]].&lt;ref name="sree-sree-thakur-rebati-mohon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="benign-lord"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Brace|first1 = Kerry|last2 = Ganguly|first2 = Arun|title = Benign Lord|publisher = Satsang Publishing House|edition = Third}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is where Satsang currently has its main center. Anukulchandra died on 27 January 1969.&lt;ref name="benign-lord" /&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Manomohini Devi Anukulchandra's Mother.jpg|thumb|Manomohini Devi (1870-1938), mother, guru of Anukulchandra and first President of Satsang.|upright]]
Anukulchandra was born on September 14, 1888 in Himaitpur village in the [[Pabna]] district of [[Bangladesh]]. His father was Sivachandra Chakravarty and his mother was Manomohini Devi. He started his formal education at [[Himaitpur]] village elementary school in 1893. In 1898, he was admitted to Pabna Institute and studied there up to the eighth grade.{{Sfn|Dattaroy|2012|p=57}} He attended Raipur High School at Amirabad for a short period and then in Naihati High School in the 24 Parganas of West Bengal until 1905. He did not graduate, having given away his matriculation exam registration fees to a classmate who he found crying as he was not able to afford the registration fees.{{Sfn|Brace|2012|p=29}}{{Sfn|Hauserman|2011|p=48}}  Later, he was admitted to the [[Calcutta National Medical College]], having tested-out of the school's high school diploma requirement.{{Sfn|Brace|1977|p=13}}{{Sfn|Dattaroy|2012|p=71}}

In high school, he wrote several short plays, the first in 1905. He also wrote songs and poems which were later published in a book, ''Debjani-O-Anyanya''.{{Sfn|Anukulchandra|2012}}{{Sfn|Maiti|2013|p=25}}{{Sfn|Dattaroy|2012|p=80}} In 1910, Anukulchandra wrote some guiding instructions for one of his friend Atulchandra Bhattachariya, that was later published in 1918 as booklet called ''Satyanusaran'' (The Pursuit of Truth).&lt;ref name=EB5&gt;{{cite web |title=Satyanusaran |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Satyanusaran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, his parents arranged for him to marry Sorashibala, aged 11, daughter of Ramgopal Bhattacharya&lt;ref name="chhotoder-thakur"&gt;{{cite book | last= Bhora |first=Paresh Chandra |publisher = Tapoban prakashan |title=Chhotoder Sri Sri Thakur Anukulchandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He later also also married Sarbomangala Devi who is popularly known as Choto Ma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/613913/|title=Commissioner Of Income-Tax vs Sarbamangala Devi|last=|first=|date=|website=indiankanoon.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homeopathy practice===

After finishing medical school, Anukulchandra started practicing homeopathy in Himaitpur in 1912. He reportedly paid for his patients' medicine and provided financial help. Anukulchandra did not have a fixed rate for seeing patients and he accepted fruits and vegetables as payment for his services.{{Sfn|Hauserman|2011|p=81}}

===Satsang===
[[File:Sri Sri Thakur under the babla tree in Pabna.jpg|thumb|Sri Sri Thakur under the babla tree in Pabna]] 
As the number of people who started to follow him increased rapidly, an organization came into being. He did not formally establish or lay the foundation of Satsang ceremoniously. Satsang evolved normally, naturally, spontaneously. The philanthropic activities of Satsang multiplied and spread far within a few years. Thakur Anukulchandra’s interest in science seeped into those with a scientific bent of mind and pat came Vishya Bigyan Kendra (World Science Centre) where with a few simple apparatus began researches in various fields. Then came up Satsang Chemical Works where manufacturing of medicines based on Sree Sree Thakur’s formulae began. Then Satsang Press, Satsang Publishing House, and other establishments found the light of the day as the necessity arose. The construction work for these establishments and other rooms for the purpose of habitation were carried out by the ashramites themselves including the women, starting from digging soil to making bricks and doing masonry. &lt;ref name="benign-lord" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ocean-in-a-teacup"&gt;{{cite book | last= Hauserman |first=Ray | year= 2011 |edition= 3rd |publisher = Satsang, Virginia Beach, USA |title=Ocean in a Teacup}}&lt;/ref&gt; And it was the women who ran the works of Satsang Press. Satsang is currently headquartered in [[Deoghar]], India. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://satsang.org.in/index.php?p=satsang|website=Satsang|title=Satsang Deoghar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activities in the satsang ashram ===
After the ashram was rebuilt in Deoghar, numerous institutes were started. Tapovan school was started with a particular focus on building character, self-dependence in addition to regular studies. Satsang ananda bazar, which was initially established by Manmohini Devi, was also resumed, to feed visitors, refugees were fed free of cost. Till date, this institution exists and feeds thousands of people twice a day free of cost. Deoghar being a rain-starved region faces acute scarcity of water in summer. To alleviate these problems, Satsang Water Works department was started which supplies fresh water drawn from the river Dwarka to the ashram. A number of deep wells and water harvesting techniques are used to meet the water requirements of the ashram as well as town-dwellers.

=== Interaction with leaders and eminent personalities ===
Chittaranjan Das, one of the eminent leaders in India’s struggle for independence was a disciple of Anukulchandra. He visited the ashram with his family on a number of occasions. He also had invited [[Mahatma_Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]] to visit the ashram. On visiting the ashram, Mahatma Gandhi was in particular impressed by Anukulchandra’s devotion for his mother and also by the magnificent personality of Manmohini Devi.

[[Subhas_Chandra_Bose|Netaji Subhashchandra Bose]], another eminent leader in Indian independence movement, also visited the ashram in Pabna, Bangladesh on couple of occasions. His parents were followers of Anukulchandra. He commented on the uniqueness of the ashram in that unlike a “sanyasi” who renounced all wordly ties, the ashram was a pioneer in establishing a place where people could live the life of a “sanyasi” along with their families. &lt;ref name="subhash-chandra-bose"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pal |first=Ajitesh |date=2018-03-22 |url=http://www.bartamanpatrika.com/detailNews.php?cID=23&amp;nID=101961&amp;P=1&amp;nPID=20180322|language=Bengali |location=Kolkata | title=নেতাজি সুভাষচন্দ্র ও ঠাকুর অনুকূলচন্দ্রের সম্পর্ক, প্রায় অনালোচিত এক অধ্যায় }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death on 27 January 1969, his oldest son Amarendranath Chakravarty (21 November 1911 – 6 August 1995), known as Sree Sree Borda, led the activities of Satsang &lt;ref name="Indian Postage Stamp of Sree Sree Borda"&gt;{{cite web |title= Indian postage stamp on Sree Sree Borda|url= http://www.istampgallery.com/sri-sri-borda/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the activities are headed by Ashok Chakravarty, grandson of Anukulchandra and son of Amarendranath Chakravarty.

== Philosophy and teachings ==
Anukulchandra wrote "The degeneration of humanity began at that moment when the unseen God was made infinite and, ignoring the seers, the worship of their sayings began. Oh mankind! If you desire to invoke your good, forget sectarian conflict. Be regardful to all the past prophets. Be attached to your living master or God and take only those who love Him as your own. Because all the past prophets are consummated in the divine man of the present."&lt;ref name = "Satyanusaran"&gt;{{citation | title = Satyanusaran |url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Satyanusaran}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anukulchandra did not accept anyone as his disciple if he or she wanted to change his or her faith. According to [[Ramesh Nagaraj Rao]], Anukulchandra advocated that people of all faiths could come together and strengthen communal harmony.&lt;ref name="Convergence, not conversion"&gt;{{citation | title = Convergence, not conversion |url = http://www.religionandspirituality.com/view/post/11685852108600/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray Hauserman, one of his American devotees, wrote a book ''Commitment to a Christian Renewal: Conversations with an Indian Sage'' which describes Anukulchandra's convergence philosophy in the West.&lt;ref name="Commitment to a Christian Renewal: Conversations with an Indian Sage"&gt;{{cite book | last= Hauserman |first=Ray | year= 1989| title = Commitment to a Christian Renewal: Conversations with an Indian Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Latest"&gt;{{citation | title=The Latest| url = http://www.uri.org/the_latest/2015/11/proselytizing__not_in_thakurs_vocabulary_conversion__not_admitted_by_sri_sri_thakur_anukul_chandra
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===
Except a few short plays, poems, and songs published as ''Debojani O Ananya'',{{Sfn|Anukulchandra|2012}} the only book written by Anukulchandra is ''Satyanusaran''. His dictations in the form of [[rhymes]] has been compiled into multiple volumes of books by Satsang Publishing House, which was established by Anukulchandra. Many of his conversations and found new episodes within of which lectures have been recorded by appointed followers and have also been published. He wrote numerous pamphlets in Bengali to promote his organization.

=== Views on Religion ===
According to Sree Sree Thakur, all the past prophets are consummated in the divine man of the present. He said the so-called religions are just views, and each individual may have an independent view of their own. There is absolutely no opposition among the views, rather the same way feeling of the One in many forms.

'''Augustin Joseph Caron''' (1774–1822) was a [[lieutenant colonel]] in the French army during the [[Bourbon Restoration]].

He was accused and acquitted of [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] in 1820. In 1821 he was again implicated in a conspiracy, this time for attempting to free soldiers involved in the [[Belfort Conspiracy]]. To circumvent claims of entrapment, the government brought Caron before a military tribunal. Despite public skepticism, Caron was convicted and executed in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert Alexander| title= Re-Writing the French Revolutionary Tradition: Liberal Opposition and the Fall of the Bourbon Monarchy| year= 2003|isbn=0-521-80122-2 |chapter=Self-defeating opposition: from July 1820 to February 1824|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barry Andrew Hay''' (born 16 August 1948) is an [[India]]n-born [[Netherlands|Dutch]] musician best known as the lead vocalist and frontman for Dutch rock band [[Golden Earring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p85264/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Barry Hay|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Hay was born in [[Faizabad]], [[India]] to a [[Dutch Jewish]]&lt;ref&gt;His grandmother, Vrouwtje Sluijter née Polak, and his uncle, Marcus Sluijter, were murdered in the [[Holocaust]].&lt;/ref&gt; mother, Sofia Maria née Sluijter (b. 1922 in [[Makassar]]), and a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] commissioned officer, Philip Aubrey Hay (1923-1980). He moved to the [[Netherlands]] at the age of eight to live with his mother. He lived in [[Amsterdam]] and later in [[The Hague]], attending an English boarding school. After graduating from [[secondary school]], he took courses at the [[Royal Academy of Art, The Hague]]. In the summer of 1967, he joined the Golden Earrings,&lt;!--earringS is not a typo --&gt; as they were then called, replacing Frans Krassenburg. Hay created the [[album cover|cover]] art for some of [[Golden Earring's album]]s.

He has also made three [[solo (music)|solo]] albums.  ''Only Parrots Frogs and Angels'' (1972) and ''Victory of Bad Taste'' (1987) both met with little success.  ''The Big Band Theory'' (2008) is available as an online stream.

In 1994, he sang lead vocals and played [[alto flute]] on the [[Ayreon]] song "[[Sail Away to Avalon]]," the single from the latter's debut [[album]], ''[[The Final Experiment]]''. 

In 2001, Hay left The Hague and moved back to Amsterdam, although he now divides his time between the Netherlands and [[Curaçao]] where he hosts a radio-show. During the 2000s Hay provided  the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] voice of [[Rock Zilla]], in the [[Gene Simmons]]' cartoon series ''[[My Dad The Rock Star]]'' and appeared in a commercial for prescription sunglasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.framesdirect.com/celebrity-eyewear-sightings-october-2008/|title=FramesDirect.com Blog|website=FramesDirect.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 2016 Hay released an album with side-project Flying V Formation, and his biography.

'''Caroline Elizabeth Sarah Norton''' (22 March 1808 – 15 June 1877) was an English social reformer and author active in the early and mid-nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Perkin26-28"&gt;Perkin pp. 26–28&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline left her husband in 1836, following which he sued her close friend [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], the then [[British Whig Party|Whig]] Prime Minister, for [[criminal conversation]] (i.e. adultery). The jury threw out the claim, but Caroline was unable to obtain a divorce and was denied access to her three sons. Caroline's intense campaigning led to the passing of the [[Custody of Infants Act 1839]], the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857]] and the [[Married Women's Property Act 1870]]. Caroline modelled for the fresco of ''Justice'' in the [[House of Lords]] by [[Daniel Maclise]], who chose her because she was seen by many as a famous victim of injustice.

Caroline was born in London to [[Thomas Sheridan (soldier)|Thomas Sheridan]] and the novelist [[Caroline Henrietta Sheridan|Caroline Henrietta Callander]].&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, pp. 1–2, 5&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was an actor, soldier, and colonial administrator, and the son of the prominent Irish playwright and [[British Whig Party|Whig]] [[politician|statesman]] [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] and his wife [[Elizabeth Ann Linley]].&lt;ref name="Strauss, p. 141"&gt;Strauss, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell219-221"&gt;Mitchell, pp. 219–221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeffares"&gt;{{citation |first=A. Norman |last=Jeffares |title=Sheridan, Thomas (1775–1817) |journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |edition=online, January 2008 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25372 |accessdate=1 August 2017 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline's mother was Scottish, the daughter of a landed gentleman, Col. Sir James Callander of Craigforth and Lady Elizabeth MacDonnell, the sister of an [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish peer]], the 1st [[Earl of Antrim|Marquess of Antrim]].&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cokayne, and others, ''The Complete Peerage,'' volume I, page 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Sheridan authored three short novels described by one of her daughter's biographers as "rather stiff with the style of the eighteenth century, but none without a certain charm and wit..."&lt;ref name="Perkins4"&gt;Perkins, pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1817, her father died in South Africa, where he was serving as the colonial secretary at the [[Cape of Good Hope]].&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; His family was left virtually penniless.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany]], an old friend of her grandfather's, arranged for Caroline's family to live at [[Hampton Court Palace]] in a "[[grace and favour]]" apartment, where they remained for several years.&lt;ref name="Perkins4"/&gt;

The combined beauty and accomplishments of the Sheridan sisters led to their being collectively referred to as the [[Charites|Three "Graces"]].&lt;ref&gt;Kemble, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;  The eldest sister, [[Helen Blackwood, Baroness Dufferin and Claneboye|Helen]], was a songwriter who married Price Blackwood, the 4th [[Baron Dufferin and Claneboye]]. Through her, Caroline became the aunt of [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava]], who later served as the third [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] of Canada and eighth [[Viceroy of India|Viceroy]] of India. Her younger sister, [[Georgiana Seymour, Duchess of Somerset|Georgiana]], considered the prettiest of the three, later became the wife of [[Edward Seymour, 12th Duke of Somerset]].

In 1827, Caroline married [[George Chapple Norton]], barrister, M.P. for [[Guildford (UK Parliament constituency)|Guildford]], and the younger brother of [[Fletcher Norton, 3rd Baron Grantley|Lord Grantley]].&lt;ref name="Perkin26-28"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott-Kilvert, p. 614"&gt;Scott-Kilvert, p. 614&lt;/ref&gt; Norton was a jealous and possessive husband, given to violent fits of drunkenness, and the union quickly proved unhappy due to his mental and physical abuse of Caroline.&lt;ref name="Strauss, p. 141"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caine, p. 67"&gt;Caine, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; To make matters worse, Norton was unsuccessful in his chosen career as a barrister, and the couple fought bitterly over money.&lt;ref name="Woodham220"&gt;Woodham-Smith, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early years of her marriage, Caroline used her beauty, wit, and political connections, to establish herself as a major society hostess.&lt;ref name="Mitchell219-221"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodham220"/&gt; Caroline's unorthodox behaviour and candid conversation raised more than a few eyebrows among 19th-century British high society; she made enemies and admirers in almost equal measure.&lt;ref name="Mitchell219-221"/&gt; Among her friends she counted such literary and political luminaries as [[Samuel Rogers]], [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], [[Edward John Trelawny|Edward Trelawny]], [[Abraham Hayward]], [[Mary Shelley]], [[Fanny Kemble]], [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], the future King [[Leopold I of Belgium]] and [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire]].&lt;ref name="Scott-Kilvert, p. 614"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perkin, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, pp. 19, 26, 48, 84, 178&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of his jealousy and pride, Norton encouraged his wife to use her connections to advance his career. It was entirely due to her influence that in 1831 he was made a Metropolitan Police Magistrate.&lt;ref name="Woodham220-221"&gt;Woodham-Smith, pp. 220–221&lt;/ref&gt; During these years, Caroline turned to prose and poetry as a means of releasing her inner emotions and earning money. Her first book, ''The Sorrows of Rosalie'' (1829), was well received.&lt;ref name="Scott-Kilvert, p. 614"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Undying One'' (1830), a romance founded upon the legend of the [[Wandering Jew]], soon followed.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Separation and Melbourne scandal==
In 1836, Caroline left her husband.&lt;ref name="Perkin26-28"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell221-223"&gt;Mitchell, pp. 221–223&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline managed to subsist on her earnings as an author, but Norton claimed these as his own, arguing successfully in court that, as her husband, Caroline's earnings were legally his.&lt;ref name="Perkin26-28"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yalom186"&gt;Yalom, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; Paid nothing by her husband, her earnings confiscated, Caroline used the law to her own advantage.&lt;ref name="Perkin28-72"&gt;Perkin, pp. 28, 72–73&lt;/ref&gt; Running up bills in her husband's name, Caroline told the creditors when they came to collect, that if they wished to be paid, they could sue her husband.&lt;ref name="Perkin28-72"/&gt;

Not long after their separation, Norton abducted their sons, hiding them with relatives in Scotland and later in [[Yorkshire]], refusing to tell Caroline anything of their whereabouts.&lt;ref name="Caine, p. 67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stone178"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kertzer, pp. 125–126"&gt;Kertzer, pp. 125–126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perkin, pp. 26–28, 96&lt;/ref&gt; Norton accused Caroline of being involved in an ongoing affair with her close friend, [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], the then [[British Whig Party|Whig]] Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="Caine, p. 67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell221-223"/&gt; Initially, Norton demanded £10,000 from Melbourne, but Melbourne refused to be blackmailed, and Norton instead took the Prime Minister to court.&lt;ref name="Perkin26-28"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell219-221"/&gt;

Lord Melbourne wrote in a letter to [[Henry Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland|Lord Holland]] that, "The fact is he (Norton) is a stupid brute, and she had not temper nor dissimulation enough to enable her to manage him."&lt;ref name="Mitchell221-223"&gt;Mitchell, pp. 221–223&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this admission, hoping to avert an even worse scandal, he pleaded with Caroline to return to Norton, insisting that "a woman should never part from her husband whilst she can remain with him."&lt;ref name="Mitchell221-223"/&gt; Lord Melbourne relented a few days later, stating that he understood her decision to leave:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This conduct upon his part seems perfectly unaccountable...You know that I have always counselled you to bear everything and remain to the last. I thought it for the best. I am afraid it is no longer possible. Open breaches of this kind are always to be lamented, but you have the consolation that you have done your utmost to stave this extremity off as long as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, pp. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The trial lasted nine days, and in the end the jury threw out Norton's claim, siding with Lord Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 223–224&lt;/ref&gt; However, the resulting publicity almost brought down the government.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 221–224, 226, 228&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal eventually died away, but not before Caroline's reputation was ruined and her friendship with Lord Melbourne destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 223–224, 226, 228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caine, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Norton continued to prevent Caroline from seeing her three sons, and blocked her from receiving a divorce.&lt;ref name="Perkin26-28"/&gt; According to English law in 1836, children were the legal property of their father, and there was little Caroline could do to regain custody.&lt;ref name="Yalom186"/&gt;

==Political activity==
[[File:Caroline Norton by Frank Stone.jpg|thumb|Caroline Norton, detail of a portrait by [[Frank Stone (painter)|Frank Stone]], circa 1845]]Caroline was soon faced with an additional tragedy; the death of her youngest son, William, in 1842.&lt;ref name="Woodham220-221"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perkins166"&gt;Perkins, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; The child, out riding alone, suffered a fall from his horse and was injured.&lt;ref name="Caine, p. 67"/&gt; According to Caroline, the child’s wounds were minor; however, they were not properly attended and blood-poisoning set in.&lt;ref name="Perkins166"/&gt; Norton, realising that the child was near death, sent for Caroline. Unfortunately, William died before she arrived in Scotland.&lt;ref name="Woodham220-221"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline blamed Norton for the child's death, accusing him of neglect.&lt;ref name="Woodham220-221"/&gt; After William's death, Norton allowed Caroline to visit their sons, but he retained full custody, and all of her visits were supervised.&lt;ref name="Caine, p. 67"/&gt;

Due to her dismal domestic situation, Caroline became passionately involved in the passage of laws promoting social justice, especially those granting rights to married and divorced women.&lt;ref name="Perkin26-28"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strauss, p. 141"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yalom186"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kertzer, pp. 125–126"/&gt; Her poems "A Voice from the Factories" (1836) and "The Child of the Islands" (1845) centred on her political views.

When Parliament debated the subject of divorce reform in 1855, Caroline submitted to the members a detailed account of her own marriage, and described the difficulties faced by women as the result of existing laws.

&lt;blockquote&gt;An English wife may not leave her husband's house. Not only can he sue her for restitution of "conjugal rights," but he has a right to enter the house of any friend or relation with whom she may take refuge...and carry her away by force...

If her husband take proceedings for a divorce, she is not, in the first instance, allowed to defend herself...She is not represented by attorney, nor permitted to be considered a party to the suit between him and her supposed lover, for "damages."

If an English wife be guilty of infidelity, her husband can divorce her so as to marry again; but she cannot divorce the husband, a vinculo, however profligate he may be....

Those dear children, the loss of whose pattering steps and sweet occasional voices made the silence of [my] new home intolerable as the anguish of death...what I suffered respecting those children, God knows ... under the evil law which suffered any man, for vengeance or for interest, to take baby children from the mother.&lt;ref name="Stone178"&gt;Stone, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yalom, pp. 186–187&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Primarily because of Caroline's intense campaigning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wroath|first=John|title=Until They Are Seven, The Origins of Women's Legal Rights|year=1998|publisher=Waterside Press|isbn=1 872 870 57 0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included a letter to Queen Victoria,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/norton_caroline.shtml|title=Caroline Norton (1808–1877)|publisher=BBC|access-date=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament passed the [[Custody of Infants Act 1839]], the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857]] and the [[Married Women's Property Act 1870]].&lt;ref name="Stone178"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kertzer, pp. 125–126"/&gt; Her most recent biographer [[Diane Atkinson]] notes that unlike in 1839 and 1857, Caroline played no part in the campaigning for the 1870 Act.&lt;ref name="Atkinson415"&gt;Atkinson, p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Custody of Children Act legally separated or divorced wives, provided they had not been found guilty of criminal conversation, were granted the right to custody of their children up to the age of seven, and periodic access thereafter. The Act applied in England, Wales and Ireland only. While Caroline could have hoped for custody of her youngest son, and access to her older sons who were seven and ten when the Act was passed into law, her husband insisted that her sons stay in Scotland.

The Act gave married women, for the first time, a right to their children. However, because women needed to petition in the Court of Chancery, in practice few women had the financial means to petition for their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Atkinson|first=Diane|title=The Criminal Conversation of Mrs Norton |year=2012|publisher=Random House| page =274|isbn=9781848093010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Matrimonial Causes Act reformed the law on divorce, amongst others making divorce more affordable, and established a model of marriage based on contract. The Married Women's Property Act 1870 allowed married women to inherit property and take court action on their own behalf. The Act granted married women in the UK, for the first time, a separate legal identity from their husband.&lt;ref name="Yalom186"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perkin, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1849 [[Daniel Maclise]] finished his fresco of ''Justice'' in the [[House of Lords]], for which Norton had modelled. He chose her because she was seen by many as a famous victim of injustice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=33233AF6CD3601B9C6AC345E25D18D0D.journals?fromPage=online&amp;aid=118225 Abstract of: Dolin, K. THE TRANSFIGURATIONS OF CAROLINE NORTON; ''Victorian Literature and Culture'' (2002), 30 : pp 503-527]&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline's old friend, Lord Melbourne, opposed the reforms she fought for.&lt;ref name="Mitchell226"&gt;Mitchell, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; He was scolded for his opposition by [[Queen Victoria]]; the Queen wrote that he defended his actions, stating: "I don't think you should give a woman too much right...there should not be two conflicting powers...a man ought to have the right in a family."&lt;ref name="Mitchell226"/&gt;

While Caroline fought to extend women's legal rights, she wasn't involved in further social activism, and had no interest in the 19th-century women's movement with regard to issues such as [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;Caine, pp. 57, 66, 68&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in an article published in ''[[The Times]]'' in 1838, countering a claim that she was a "radical", Caroline stated: "The natural position of woman is inferiority to man. Amen! That is a thing of God's appointing, not of man's devising. I believe it sincerely, as part of my religion. I never pretended to the wild and ridiculous doctrine of equality."&lt;ref&gt;Stone, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Caroline is said to have had a five-year affair with prominent [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea|Sidney Herbert]] in the early 1840s; however, Herbert married another woman in 1846.&lt;ref name="Woodham221"&gt;Woodham-Smith, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; In middle age, she befriended the author [[George Meredith]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; She served as the inspiration for Diana Warwick, the intelligent, fiery-tempered heroine of Meredith's novel ''[[Diana of the Crossways]]'', published in 1885.&lt;ref name="Woodham221"/&gt; Caroline finally became free with the death of George Norton in 1875. She married an old friend, Scottish historical writer and politician [[William Stirling-Maxwell|Sir W. Stirling Maxwell]] in March 1877. Caroline died in London three months later.&lt;ref name="Barron5"&gt;Barron, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=7NRRIK2XgiFA5pusiDn0TA&amp;scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=March 30, 2014|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and descendants==
Her eldest son, Fletcher Norton, died of [[tuberculosis]] in Paris at the age of thirty. Caroline was devastated by the loss.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, her remaining son, Thomas Brinsley Norton, married a young Italian, Maria Chiara Elisa Federigo, whom he met in [[Naples]].&lt;ref name="Perkins253"&gt;Perkins, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas also suffered from poor health, and spent much of his life as an invalid, reliant upon his mother for financial assistance.&lt;ref name="Perkins253"/&gt; Despite his ill health, he lived long enough to succeed his uncle as 4th Baron Grantley of Markenfield.&lt;ref name="Barron5"/&gt; Lord Grantley also predeceased his mother, dying in 1877.

His son, [[John Norton, 5th Baron Grantley|John]], inherited the title and estates.&lt;ref&gt;MacColl pp. 239 and 342&lt;/ref&gt; The 5th Lord Grantley was a [[numismatist]], and a Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], the [[Royal Numismatic Society]] and the [[British Numismatic Society]]. He assembled a large collection of coins and also grew orchids. Caroline Norton's grandson caused a scandal in 1879, when he ran off with another man's wife, the former Katharine McVickar, daughter of a wealthy American stockbroker.&lt;ref&gt;MacColl, pp. 239–240, 342&lt;/ref&gt; The jilted husband was the 5th Lord Grantley's older cousin, Major Charles Grantley Campbell Norton.&lt;ref&gt;MacColl, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Katharine's marriage to Charles was annulled, and Katharine and John were married that November, five days before the birth of their first child.&lt;ref&gt;MacColl, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her scandalous introduction to British society, Katharine went on to become a successful London hostess.&lt;ref&gt;MacColl, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cassandra''' "'''Cassie'''" '''Turner''' is a fictional character from the Australian [[Seven Network|Channel Seven]] soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]'', played by [[Sharni Vinson]]. She debuted on-screen during an episode that aired on 18 March 2005. Vinson originally auditioned for the role of [[Martha MacKenzie]] ([[Jodi Gordon]]), but later secured the role of Cassie. She admitted it was a challenge to portray a character six years her junior who was still attending school. Cassie's backstory reveals that she was abused as a child by her uncle. However, her characterisation is out of conjunction with the usual victims of such crimes. She is portrayed as "fiercely independent and headstrong" female who has a knack for "winning friends and influencing people". Cassie is popular with the serial's male characters, while her allure also broadened off-screen to male viewers. Cassie is given a foster family when [[Sally Fletcher]] ([[Kate Ritchie]]) and [[Flynn Saunders]] ([[Joel McIlroy]]) take her into their home.

Cassie has featured in various romance storylines; in one she begins a relationship with [[Macca MacKenzie]] (Trent Baines). The serial decided to portray as domestic abuse through the two characters. Cassie was seen pushing those closest to her away, while Macca continued his abuse. Vinson also visited females with the virus as part of the research process. The storyline was well received by carriers of the virus and Vinson said it was a "big moment" in her acting career. Vinson has received one [[Logie Award]] nomination for her portrayal of Cassie. In 2007, Vinson decided to leave ''Home and Away'' because of personal commitments. Cassie departed screens on 2 April 2008, when she left to go travelling.

==Character creation and casting==
Sharni Vinson appeared in ''Home and Away'' in 2001 and 2003, as guest characters named Tonya and Summer respectively. In 2004, Vinson's agent submitted her to audition for the role of [[Martha MacKenzie]]. Vinson received a re-call for the role and was also handed scripts for another character, Cassie Turner.&lt;ref name=sv&gt;{{cite web|title=Sharni Vinson plays Cassie Turner|url=http://seven.com.au/homeandaway/meetthecast_sharni-vinson|work=[[Yahoo!7]]|publisher=([[Yahoo!]] and [[Seven Network]])|accessdate=12 November 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412024822/http://seven.com.au/homeandaway/meetthecast_sharni-vinson|archivedate=12 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, fellow actress [[Jodi Gordon]] went on to secure the role of Martha.&lt;ref name=sharni/&gt; Vinson said she wanted to play Martha because she was characterised as a tomboy, a trait which Vinson attributes to herself. Soon after, Vinson signed up to play Cassie. Vinson was twenty one at the time, while Cassie was portrayed as a fifteen-year-old student. Vinson later described the experience as "such a stretch" because she "well out of school and then I was back into a school uniform, with the pigtails, no makeup, playing this real young character."&lt;ref name=sharni&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Matt|title=Interview: Sharni Vinson for Blue Crush 2|url=http://nine-to-five.whereilive.com.au/news/story/interview-sharni-vinson-for-blue-crush-2/|work=Nine to Five|publisher=(News Community Media)|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her first few months on-screen, producers decided to cast [[Todd Lasance]] as [[Aden Jefferies]].

In 2006, rival channel [[Network Ten]] tried to tempt Vinson into joining pop group [[Girlband (Australian band)|Girlband]], however she decided to stay in ''Home and Away''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vinson 'banned' from Girlband|url=http://www.news.com.au/news/vinson-banned-from-girlband/story-fna7dq6e-1111112407307|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=([[News Limited]])|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=24 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007, media outlets reported that Vinson wanted to quit the serial in order to pursue other projects in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home and Away overseas|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/entertainment/confidential/home-and-away-overseas/story-e6freq7o-1111114003257|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=([[News Limited]])|accessdate=12 November 2011|date=21 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November that year it was confirmed that Vinson had quit ''Home and Away'' so she could move to Los Angeles to be with her boyfriend. However, the serial refused to comment on her departure because Cassie would still be seen on-screen into 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dadds|first=Kimberley|title=Vinson to leave soap for US lover|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a80434/vinson-to-leave-soap-for-us-lover.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=23 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vinson said she was happy that she got to play Cassie, because she enjoyed the work and portraying her storylines.&lt;ref name=sharni/&gt; By the time Vinson left, Cassie had appeared in a total of one hundred and three episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mathieson|first=Craig|title=Summer Bay helps get starlet en pointe|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/summer-bay-helps-get-starlet-en-pointe-20100722-10mex.html|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=([[Fairfax Media]])|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character development==

===Characterisation===
{{cquote|Her monster of an uncle sexually abused her and it took years upon years for her to come to terms with it all. Thankfully, this meek little mouse was chased away ages ago. By a sex kitten. Do not be fooled by her heavenly smile: Cassie is anything but angelic. She may have more energy than a legion of Duracell bunnies and be a natural when it comes to making friends and influencing people, but Cassie has a wild and wanton streak. Sure, it can be lots of fun, but it can also create a whole lot of trouble. Cassie used to be fiercely independent and headstrong, really knowing how to hold her own when it came to the boys of the Bay.|4=''[[Channel 5 (UK)|Five]] on Cassie''.&lt;ref name=five/&gt;}}

Cassie has been described as having a "fiercely independent and headstrong" persona. While she is able to learn from her mistakes and has a knack when it comes to "winning friends and influencing people". Cassie's independence and "strong-will" is attributed to her upbringing. After many problems in her childhood she was forced to live with her grandmother, Joy (Elaine Lee) after her mother abandoned her. She was the only family Cassie had and has been described as "devastated" when she died. Cassie has also been the victim of child abuse; this initially meant she was "deeply troubled". However counseling helped her to "learn how to live without anxiety."&lt;ref name=cassie&gt;{{cite web|title=Cassie Turner played by Sharni Vinson|url=http://seven.com.au/homeandaway/meetthecast_cassie-turner|work=[[Yahoo!7]]|publisher=([[Yahoo!]] and [[Seven Network]])|accessdate=12 November 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409025747/http://seven.com.au/homeandaway/meetthecast_cassie-turner|archivedate=9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vinson told [[Yahoo!7]] that Cassie is "mature" for a fifteen-year-old. As she has had to go through so much in her life, she "is older in the head than she realises". She also said that at the same time she can act "naive because she is young".&lt;ref name=sv/&gt; In 2005, the characters of Cassie, Martha and [[Matilda Hunter]] ([[Indiana Evans]]) were used by the Seven Network to promote their clothing range. The characters were seen on-screen dressed in items from their clothing line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hornery|first=Andrew|title=Fashion vistas|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2005/04/20/1113854261243.html?oneclick=true|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=([[Fairfax Media]])|accessdate=12 November 2011|author2=Cubby, Ben|date=21 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic violence===
[[File:Trent Baines.jpg|thumb|200px|Trent Baines (''pictured'') plays Cassie's violent love interest, Macca.]]In one storyline Cassie begins a relationship with [[Macca MacKenzie]] (Trent Baines), which turns violent when Macca starts to hit her.&lt;ref name=cassie/&gt; Cassie initially leaves Macca, but decides she loves him and dates him in secret. Those closest to Cassie are ashamed of her when they discover the truth. ''Female First'' opined that Cassie "cried her heart out" and "wished the whole world would just swallow her up" because of her dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home and Away - Cassie Cries Her Heart Out|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/tv/soaps/home+and+away-29408.html|work=Female First|publisher=(First Active Media Ltd)|accessdate=12 November 2011|date=24 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication also felt that there was nothing [[Ric Dalby]] ([[Mark Furze]]) could do to help Cassie, because she herself would not admit the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home and Away - Cassie is Hurt|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/tv/soaps/home+and+away-24376.html|work=Female First|publisher=(First Active Media Ltd)|accessdate=12 November 2011|date=6 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being assaulted by Macca, he convinces her to leave her family and friends behind and move away with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Will Cassie leave with Macca? |url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/home-and-away/coming-next/will-cassie-leave-with-macca/507 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120919124325/http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/home-and-away/coming-next/will-cassie-leave-with-macca/507 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 September 2012 |work=[[What's on TV]] |publisher=([[IPC Media]]) |accessdate=12 November 2011 |date=19 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' said that Macca had "hardly been the ideal boyfriend" and said it wasn't hard to see why Cassie had doubts about leaving with him.&lt;ref name=rec/&gt; [[Sally Fletcher]] ([[Kate Ritchie]]) tries to help Cassie, but she proves "stubborn" and decides to leave with Macca. He uncharacteristically warns Sally that she is in danger of losing her foster daughter for good. They said it was the first point in the storyline that Macca did a "mature, sensible thing".&lt;ref name=rec&gt;{{cite web|title=Soap stories: Cassie has her doubts; Home and Away weekdays, BBC1, 5.35pm|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Soap+stories%3A+Cassie+has+her+doubts%3B+HOME+AND+AWAY+WEEKDAYS,+BBC1,...-a0160657265|work=f|publisher=gh|accessdate=12 November 2011|date=17 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five said that Macca would "trash her as soon as he looked at her".

===HIV===
Cassie was later involved in a notable storyline in which she contracts [[HIV]] from Henk Van Patten ([[Damian De Montemas]]). ''Home and Away'' producers first informed Vinson about the HIV storyline in mid-2007. They also asked for her opinion on the development. Vinson was initially worried about the serial's early timeslot on the Seven Network, coupled with the "intense" nature of the storyline. However, she changed her mind upon receiving the scripts because she thought they were well written.&lt;ref name=hi/&gt; When the storyline was screened, Vinson explained that Cassie is "in love, engaged and expecting a baby" so she thinks her life "couldn't be more fantastic". When Cassie discovers she is HIV positive, she feels as though she has hit "the bottom of the barrel" and knows that "her life's changed forever".&lt;ref name=hi&gt;{{cite journal|title=A tragic twist|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=1–7 March 2008|pages=31|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vinson added that after, Cassie finds the situation "incomprehensible" and cannot "understand" what has been told. She goes "numb" and is "overcome with shock". Cassie cannot cope with her "nightmare" and rushes out into the street, "straight into the path of an oncoming car". Cassie is then rushed to hospital following being run over and viewers were kept guessing as to whether her baby would survive.&lt;ref name=hi/&gt;

The storyline was the first that Vinson "actually bothered" to go out and research. Vinson and her drama coach visited hospitals to meet with HIV positive females. Vinson received letters from HIV positive people, praising her portrayal of the issue. The moment that Cassie discovers she has the virus was well received by viewers. Vinson said that the feedback had made her "happy" and that playing the scenario was a "big moment" for herself as an actor.&lt;ref name=sharni/&gt; In early 2008, Cassie's exit storyline reported in the media over two months before she was due to depart. It was revealed that Cassie would leave to travel the world with Sally, before the birth of her daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home and Away Spoilers 2008|url=http://www.throng.com.au/home-and-away/home-and-away-spoilers-2008|work=Throng.com.au|publisher=(Throng Limited)|accessdate=12 November 2011|date=31 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==
Cassie meets Ric while jet-skiing, it soon becomes clear she stole the vehicle and they escape the owner. She meets Ric once again and they go skinny dipping at the beach. Cassie steals his clothes and forces him to go home naked. Cassie attends the "Miss Groper" pageant where her grandmother, Joy is taking part. When she does not win, she gets into an argument with [[Colleen Smart]] ([[Lyn Collingwood]]), collapses and later dies. Cassie's uncle turns up, but she has flashbacks from her childhood where it is revealed he used to abuse her. He is reported to the police and Sally and Flynn decided to take Cassie into their home. Cassie becomes close to Ric, who is also fostered by Sally and Flynn. Their sexual tension becomes too much, but when it came to sleeping together, Cassie has flashbacks of her uncle [[Ben Foxton|Ben]] (Craig Elliot) abuse and subsequently breaks up with Ric. Cassie starts dating Aden and Ric becomes jealous of their relationship. Ric tackles Aden during a football match, so Aden's brother, [[Sean Jefferies|Sean]] (Gabriel Egan) attacks Ric, causing Cassie to dump Aden and later gets back with Ric.

She becomes trapped with Ric when an electricity cable falls on them. Sally and Flynn rescue them, but are electrocuted in doing so. Although they survive, Flynn later dies from his tumor and Cassie finds it hard to cope with his death.

When [[Belle Taylor]] ([[Jessica Tovey]]) arrives in Summer Bay, she feels threatened by her friendship with Ric and dumps him. She then meets Martha's adoptive brother, Macca and starts to date him. Their romance faces problems when she complains about not being able to see him often and the effect his prescription medication has on him. After more arguments Macca hits Cassie and she decides to forgive him, but reconciles with Ric after he dumps Belle. However, Belle still wants Ric so she convinces Cassie to tutor [[Drew Curtis (Home and Away)|Drew Curtis]] ([[Bobby Morley]]), while she unsuccessfully attempted to steal Ric back. Ric attends a mechanical course in the city, while Macca returns claiming to have overcome his anger issues. Cassie realises she still has feelings for Macca and gets back together with him. When Ric finds out she has cheated, Cassie decides to move out of her home despite Sally telling her that she does not want her to go and stay with [[Irene Roberts]] ([[Lynne McGranger]]). Macca later receives a job offer in the city and asks Cassie to move with him. After an argument with Sally, Cassie decides to take up his offer. Macca feels bad and tells Sally that she should fight for Cassie; however she does not listen to Sally's pleas and moves. Cassie visits Summer Bay as much as she can; however her visits annoy Macca who begins to beat her up again. After a few more assaults, Cassie feels she has to move back home, but agrees to continue their relationship. Macca tracks her down and hits her again, before handing himself into the police.

Cassie decides to start at a charity helpline for domestic abuse victims. Brad Armstrong (Chris Sadrinna) helps her set the charity up and Dan Baker ([[Tim Campbell (actor)|Tim Campbell]]) acts as a counsellor. Cassie's first caller for help, Lily Nelson ([[Kathryn Beck]]) intrigues Cassie, who then meets up with her. Cassie wins Lily's trust and discovers she is being domestically abused by her boyfriend Kyle Sanders (Anthony Gee). Cassie uses her own experiences with Macca to convince Lily to leave Kyle. Cassie moves Lily into Summer Bay House, but when Sally finds out the truth she forces Lily to leave. Cassie goes to visit Lily, but Kyle turns violent, prompting Sally and Brad to save them. Lily moves back in with Cassie, but she becomes obsessed with protecting her. When [[Jules Munro]] (Joel Phillips) arrives, she warns Lily off him believing that he is bad. When Lily nearly drowns in the sea, Jules does not help her. This makes Cassie believe she is correct about him, however they soon realise they are attracted to one another. Jules lures Cassie into a driving lesson, but sabotages the car so he can spend time with her. Jules keeps trying to impress Cassie and even undresses for her. However, she seems more interested in [[Alex Poulos]] ([[Danny Raco]]). Jules becomes jealous and steals Alex's bike, which forces him to leave town and before he leaves he tells Cassie that he loves her. Cassie becomes close with Alex but is shocked when she discovers that he is dealing drugs. Jules later turns up again and they become close again. [[Jazz Curtis]] ([[Rachel Gordon]]) ruins their relationship when she lies to Cassie, claiming that she has been sleeping with Jules.

Cassie starts dating Henk which annoys [[Rachel Armstrong]] ([[Amy Mathews]]), who reveals that Henk raped her when she was younger. However, Cassie refuses to believe it and begins a serious relationship with him. Henk later comes bored and dumps Cassie. She later attends a party with [[Matilda Hunter]] ([[Indiana Evans]]) and where Aden is smoking marijuana. Cassie drives them home despite drinking; when Aden distracts her she crashes the car and is arrested for drunk driving. Henk returns to support Cassie, who is let off with her offence. Cassie discovers that she is pregnant and she and Henk decide to get married. Cassie takes a blood test and discovers that she has contracted HIV from Henk. She runs out of the surgery and is run over by an oncoming car. Although she recovers, Henk leaves her once again and Rachel supports her through her troubles. When Henk returns to win Cassie back, she refuses and tells him she needs to be alone. Aden has to take a HIV test after he got Cassie's blood on her in the crash, but the test returns negative but refuses to forgive Cassie. She is heartbroken when [[Alf Stewart]] ([[Ray Meagher]]) tells Cassie he wants nothing to do with her because she has HIV. Colleen also voices her prejudice by implying she may infect Sally's baby. They both later apologize when Cassie raises awareness of the virus and gains everyone's support. Sally suggests that Cassie goes travelling with her, which she accepts. Cassie decides to have one last road trip with her best friend, Matilda and travel by car. Cassie feels her baby kick for the first time and waves goodbye to the town’s residents as she leaves for her new life.

==Reception==
For her portrayal of Cassie, Vinson was nominated in the category of "Most Popular New Female Talent" at the 2006 [[Logie Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who's up for one?|url=http://www.news.com.au/whos-up-for-one/story-e6frfpi9-1111112117070|work=[[News.com.au]]|publisher=([[News Limited]])|accessdate=12 November 2011|date=3 April 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513114154/http://www.news.com.au/whos-up-for-one/story-e6frfpi9-1111112117070|archivedate=13 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soap opera magazine ''[[Inside Soap]]'' said that whenever fictional characters are happy, "disaster lurks around the corner".

==Qin dynasty==

The [[Qin dynasty]] (秦朝) was established in 221 BCE after [[Qin Shi Huang]], King of Qin, conquered his final independent neighbour, the [[Qi (state)|state of Qi]]. It is now recognised as the first Chinese imperial dynasty in the modern sense of the term; in recognition of this, its rulers were for the first time titled "Emperor" (皇帝), a title of which the components are drawn from legend, higher than the previous title "King" (王). The ancestral name of the family was Ying (嬴), although it is anachronistic to regard this as a family name in the modern sense: it would not have been used together with a given name. The titles of the Qin emperors were literally [[regnal number]]s: "Qin Shi Huang" (秦始皇), in full "Qin Shi Huangdi" (秦始皇帝) means literally "the first Emperor of Qin", "Qin Er Shi" (秦二世), in full "Qin Er Shi Huangdi" (秦二世皇帝) means "the second Emperor of Qin", and so forth.

==Han dynasty, Xin dynasty and Shu Han==
{{see also|Shu Han family trees}}

[[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]], the last emperor of the [[Han dynasty]], was a descendant of the first emperor [[Liu Bang]]. Lasting for over 400 years, the Han Dynasty is regarded as one of the golden ages of Chinese history. The Han Dynasty was interrupted by the reign of the usurper [[Wang Mang]], who declared the [[Xin dynasty]] (9–23 AD); on this basis, the Han Dynasty is generally divided into the Western Han (206 BC – 9 AD and 23–25 AD) and the Eastern Han (25–220 AD). The rulers of the [[Shu Han]], one of the three successor states to the Han Dynasty during the [[Three Kingdoms period]], were descended from the Han imperial family, and considered themselves a continuation of the Han Dynasty; they are included below.

==Jin dynasty and Chu==
{{see also|Family tree of Sima Yi}}

The following is a family tree for the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]], which ruled a unified China during the Western Jin Dynasty (265–316 AD). Although greatly weakened by the [[War of the Eight Princes]] during the reign of the developmentally disabled [[Emperor Hui of Jin|Emperor Hui]], when members of the clan fought among themselves for imperial control, and forced Eastwards after the conquest of their capital in 316 AD, the dynasty nonetheless continued in the form of the Eastern Jin Dynasty until 420 AD.

[[Beatification|Blessed]] '''Clotilde Micheli''' (11 September 1849 - 24 March 1911) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Nun|professed religious]] who established the order known as the Sisters of Angels; she assumed the new name of "'''Maria Serafina of the Sacred Heart'''" upon the order's foundation and her profession into it. She had once before been part of a religious order in which she received the name of "'''Maria Annunziata'''" but discarded it when she left their ranks.&lt;ref name=SQPN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catholicsaints.info/blessed-maria-serafina-of-the-sacred-heart/|title=Blessed Maria Serafina of the Sacred Heart|publisher=Saints SQPN|date=15 April 2015|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Micheli was beatified in Benevento in 2011 after [[Pope Benedict XVI]] granted approval for her beatification to take place. Cardinal [[Angelo Amato]] presided over the celebration on the behalf of the pontiff.

==Life==
Clotilde Micheli was born in [[Imer]], [[Austrian Empire]] on 11 September 1849. She received [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|Confirmation]] at the age of three in 1852 from the [[Bishop of Trent]] [[Johann Nepomuk von Tschiderer zu Gleifheim|Blessed Johann Nepomuk von Tschiderer zu Gliefheim]].

During her childhood she had her first apparition in which her [[Guardian Angel]] came to her with an invitation from the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Blessed Mother]] to consecrate herself as a virgin to her.&lt;ref name=VC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vultuschristi.org/index.php/2011/04/maria-serafina-del-sacro-cuore/|title=Maria Serafina del Sacro Cuore|publisher=Vultus Christi|date=11 April 2011|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had her [[First Communion]] in 1858 at the age of nine and after this felt a strong pull to the religious life; she spent her nights in long periods of [[Eucharistic adoration|adoration]] to the [[Eucharist]]. As a child she received her education from her mother who instilled in her a sense of virtue and the fundamental Christian ethics.&lt;ref name=VC/&gt; On the night of 2 August 1867 - in the parish church of her hometown - the Blessed Mother appeared with angels around her and showed her that it was Micheli's mission to found a religious congregation that would have as its crucial aim the adoration of [[God]] and [[Jesus Christ]] as the spirit under her patronage.&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/91738|title=Blessed Maria Serafina of the Sacred Heart (Clotilde Micheli|publisher=Santi e Beati|date=|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Micheli received the consolation of a friend and went to [[Venice]] for the spiritual guidance of Mgr. [[Domenico Agostini]] - future cardinal and [[Patriarch of Venice]] - who advised her to draft a Rule; she was frightened at the prospect of this and believed she had no inspiration so returned in sadness to her hometown having written nothing.&lt;ref name=VC/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; Micheli relocated to [[Padua]] in 1867 close to the [[priest]] Angelo Piacentini whom she confided her doubts to. She remained under his [[spiritual direction]] until his death in 1876; in 1878 she realized that her parents - without her knowledge - was in the process of arranging a marriage for her. Her response to this was to flee to [[Epfendorf]] in the [[German Kingdom]]. Micheli remained there until 1885 where she worked as a [[nurse]] in a clinic that the Elizabethan Sisters ran.&lt;ref name=VC/&gt; However her mother died in 1883 and her father followed in 1885 around the time she left Epfendorf for her hometown and remained there alone until 1887 when she decided to discern her project for a congregation.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

While she was in Epfendorf - on 10 November 1883 - she passed through to find a church for her to reflect in and found a church that she failed to realize was in fact a [[Protestant]] church. Her Guardian Angel came to her and said: Arise for this is a Protestant church. But I want to make you see the place where [[Martin Luther]] was condemned and the pain he suffered as a punishment for his pride"; Micheli saw demons who had forced Luther to his knees and confirmed he was consigned to the fires of [[Hell]].&lt;ref name=VC/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

Alongside her niece Giuditta she - in May 1887 - set out on foot for a pilgrimage to [[Rome]] and made it an objective to stop at all Marian sanctuaries along the route as a means of receiving further inspiration for her project. In August she arrived in Rome and joined the order known as the Suore Immacolatine; she took the habit and received the name of "Maria Annunziata".&lt;ref name=VC/&gt; She remained with that order until 1891 and served as the Mother Superior of a convent in the village of [[Sgurgola]] in the [[Diocese of Anagni]]. She came to know the [[Franciscan]] priest Francesco Fusco da Trani while she was in [[Assisi]] during her pilgrimage and he wrote to her in order to advise her to leave her order and go to [[Piedimonte d'Alife]] where the Bishop Antonio Scotti had plans for an order of his own. However upon meeting Scotti she realized their plans were not at all similar.&lt;ref name=VC/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

Micheli then travelled to [[Caserta]] and - alongside the nun Filomena Scaringi - remained in a household with people who provided her with both material and spiritual support. She set her own house in [[Casolla]] with two women and led to the [[Bishop of Caserta]] Enrico De Rossi authorizing the small congregation Micheli had established as the Sisters of the Angels on 28 June 1891.&lt;ref name=VC/&gt; She discarded her previous religious name and took the name of "Maria Serafina of the Sacred Heart". During her lifetime her order flourished with a total of fifteen houses being established. The order would later spread elsewhere to places such as [[Indonesia]] and [[Benin]].&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt; A house in [[Faicchio]] opened in June 1899 as a place for formation.

She became quite ill in 1895 - almost close to death - and refused herself medical treatment. Instead she was moved elsewhere for a period of rest in order to recover from her illness. On one particular occasion a [[seminarian]] - whom [[Satan]] had possessed - arrived in the garden adjacent to the convent and asked for her. The sisters did not want to fatique Micheli so said she wasn't there; the seminarian knew this was a lie and began to inveigh against the sisters in an inhuman voice. Micheli then approached and demanded he be quiet to which the voice said: "You are damned!"; the sisters inquired about the demons present to which the inhuman voice said: "we are seven". Micheli took the seminarian aside to listen to him and then applied both [[holy water]] and the [[sign of the Cross]] on him - this succeeded in driving the devils out of him and was a successful [[exorcism]].&lt;ref name=VC/&gt;

Micheli died on 24 March 1911. Her remains are interred in Faicchio.

==Beatification==
The beatification process commenced on 9 July 1990 after the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] - under [[Pope John Paul II]] - declared "nihil obstat" (nothing against) to the cause which also granted her the posthumous title of [[Servant of God]]. The diocesan process spanned from 1 October 1990 until 15 March 1992 and saw the thorough investigation of her life as well as the visions that she was prone to. Upon the closure of this process all documentation was submitted to Roman officials for investigation on their end; the so-called "Roman Phase" commenced on 2 July 1993 after the diocesan process was cleared of having done its work according to the set criteria.

The postulation compiled and submitted the [[Positio]] to Rome for further investigation while the large dossier included biographical details as well as attesting to the manner in which she led her life according to Christian values. This also had to face the historical commission on 14 January 2003 who had to determine whether or not there were obstacles to the cause; the historians approved it and thus would allow the cause to continue.

On 3 July 2009 she was conferred the title of [[Venerable]] after [[Pope Benedict XVI]] acknowledged the fact that Micheli had practiced a model Christian life of [[heroic virtue]] - both [[Cardinal virtues|cardinal]] and [[Theological virtues|theological]].

The process for the miracle required for her beatification opened on 28 November 2003 in the diocese of its origin and closed on 25 January 2005; it was then submitted to Roman officials for further investigation and received formal ratification on 20 May 2005. The Rome-based medical board met in order to discuss if the healing was indeed a credible miracle and approved it after meeting on 3 December 2009 while consulting theologians approved it on 26 March 2010; the Congregation for the Causes of Saints followed suit on 8 June 2010 and passed it to Benedict XVI for his approval on 1 July 2010.

Micheli received beatification on 28 May 2011 in Benevento; Cardinal [[Angelo Amato]] presided over the beatification on the behalf of Benedict XVI.

The current [[postulator]] assigned to the cause is Sr. Giuseppina Romano.

'''Amirouche Aït Hamouda''' (31 October 1926 – 29 March 1959), commonly called '''Colonel Amirouche''', was a leader in the [[Algerian War]], organizing the [[Irregular military|maquis]] of the [[Wilayah|Wilaya]] III. He is considered a [[Folk hero|national hero]] in Algeria.

He was killed during combat against French troops on March 29, 1959. This event was much publicized, as Amirouche was considered to be a great threat to the French in Algeria.

'''Duncan McDuffie''' (September 24, 1877 &amp;ndash; 1951) was a [[real estate developer]], [[conservation movement|conservationist]], and [[mountaineering|mountaineer]] based in [[Berkeley, California]], United States.

==Developer==
McDuffie is best known for developing the [[Claremont, Oakland/Berkeley, California|Claremont]] and [[Northbrae]] neighborhoods of [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and [[St. Francis Wood]] district in San Francisco. His upscale developments were laid out as "residential parks," with streets that follow the contours of the hills and power lines that run underground.

McDuffie's developments included covenants to exclude non-whites from home-ownership, and he promoted zoning laws to exclude non-whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lorey|first=Maya Tulip|date=2013|title=A HISTORY OF RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION IN BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA, 1878–1960|url=http://www.schoolinfosystem.org/pdf/2014/06/04SegregationinCA24-2.pdf|journal=The Concord Review, Inc.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservationist==
McDuffie was also a notable conservationist. He was president of the [[Sierra Club]] from 1928 to 1931 and from 1943 to 1946.

===East Bay Regional Park District===
In 1934 McDuffie helped create the [[East Bay Regional Park District]] in the [[Berkeley Hills]].

===California state parks===
Duncan McDuffie helped establish the California state park system with the help of his friend, Governor [[C. C. Young]]. He won the [[Pugsley Medal]] for his service on the [[California Department of Parks and Recreation|California State Parks Commission]].

==Mountaineer==
McDuffie was an accomplished [[mountaineering|mountaineer]] in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. He made first ascents of [[Mount Abbot]] and [[Black Kaweah]].

Along with [[Joseph N. LeConte]] and [[James S. Hutchinson]], he pioneered a high mountain route in 1908 from [[Yosemite National Park]] to [[Kings Canyon National Park|Kings Canyon]], roughly along the route of the modern [[John Muir Trail]].  In 28 days, they completed a trip of 228 miles through the high mountains, including several previously unexplored sections.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, Harriet, edited by David R. Brower, Sierra Club: A Handbook, "Mountaineering", Sierra Club, San Francisco, 1947, page 16&lt;/ref&gt;

McDuffie suffered from [[Parkinson's disease]] for nearly 20 years before his death in 1951.  The Sierra peak [[Mount McDuffie]] is named after him.

'''Ernest John Goodsir-Cullen''' (July 15, 1912 &amp;ndash; December 1993) was an [[India]]n [[field hockey]] player who competed in the [[1936 Summer Olympics]].

In 1936 he was a member of the Indian field hockey team, which won the gold medal in Berlin. He played in all five matches as halfback.

Goodsir-Cullen was born in Kerala, India and educated at [[St. George's College, Mussoorie|St. George's College at Musoorie]], and Madras University where he qualified as a medical doctor. During World War II he served as an officer in the Indian Army Medical Corps where he was attached to several different regiments and was posted to Iraq and Palestine on active service. In 1945 he married Captain Elsie Victoria Spratt, a QA officer in the British Army and their first son, Sean Patrick, was born in March 1946 in Poona. In 1947 the family went to live with Elsie's mother in [[Portstewart]], [[County Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]] and Ernest had to re-qualify as a doctor at [[Queen's University, Belfast]].

Goodsir-Cullen continued playing hockey. At club level he played for Portrush and Queen's University. He also played for Ulster and was asked to play at the 1952 Olympics for Ireland, 16 years after representing India in Berlin. Preparations for the Olympics clashed with Ernest's finals in Belfast, however, so he had to decline the invitation.

After finishing his academic work in Belfast Goodsir-Cullen took his family to London where he completed his training at the Westminster Hospital, which he also represented at hockey and, as by far the oldest player, at seven a side rugby where his pace on the wing was an asset. From London he took his family to Ipswich, Suffolk, where he had obtained a post as an assistant in a general practice. His second son, Niall Jonathan Martin, was born on August 10, 1951.

Goodsir-Cullen was contacted by a fellow graduate of Madras University whose medical practice was looking for another partner. He took his family to Middlesbrough where he worked as a GP in the practice for most of the next 35 years.  His third son, Christopher Dermot, was born on August 10, 1959, coincidentally the birthday of Niall.

In 1980 Elsie died after a short illness. Two years later Goodsir-Cullen married Maud Elizabeth Lowe née Spratt, an elder sister of Elsie. In 1985 they moved to Portstewart where they were both active in golf and bowls until Ernest's death. Maud died in 2009.

His older brother [[William Goodsir-Cullen|William]] won a gold medal at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] as a member of Indian field hockey team.

'''Francisco Sabino Alvares da Rocha Vieira Barroso''' (died 1846) was a revolutionary political leader of 19th-century [[Brazil]]. He was the leader of the [[Sabinada]] rebellion of 1837-38, in which he called for the abolition of slavery and the redistribution of land, but he was defeated.

== Biography ==
Francisco Sabino was a doctor from [[Brazil]], and he later became a revolutionary political leader. He led the [[Sabinada]] separatist uprising in 1837 in the state of [[Bahia]] on the southeastern shore, where he wanted to abolish slavery and redistribute land to the people of Brazil. His rebellion was defeated in 1838, and the provincial landowners organized a court to try him. He was exiled to Beira, dying of malaria in 1846 in [[Mato Grosso]].

'''Gabriel Estêvão Monjane''' (1944 &amp;ndash; 1990) is one of only seventeen individuals in medical history to have reached eight feet or more in height.

Born in [[Manjacaze]], [[Gaza Province]], [[Mozambique]], Monjane's abnormal growth, attributed to an overactive [[pituitary gland]], started soon after birth.  By the time he was 17, Monjane stood 7 feet 10&amp;nbsp;inches. He joined a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[circus]]. When measured officially in 1987, Monjane was 8 feet and three quarters of an inch. He also weighed 348 pounds.

During his lifetime, especially late into his life, Monjane suffered leg problems. The ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'' stated that he was the tallest living man in their 1988 edition.  Monjane died in January 1990 after a fall at his home, after which [[Suleiman Ali Nashnush]], another African, was named the tallest living man.

==Senior==
'''Gaius Scribonius Curio Burbulieus''' (d. 53 BC) was a Roman statesman and orator. He was nicknamed '''Burbulieus''' (after an actor) for the way he moved his body while speaking.  Curio was noted as a public orator and for the purity of his Latin language.

Curio was a [[tribune|tribune of the plebs]] in 90 BC. He later served as a legate under [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] in [[Greece]] and [[Asia]] during the campaign against [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]]. He laid siege to the tyrant [[Aristion]], who had taken position on the [[Acropolis]], during the attack on [[Athens]]. Several years later, in 76 BC, he was elected [[Roman consul|consul]] with Gnaeus Octavius.  After his consulship he went to [[Macedon]]ia as governor. He successfully fought the [[Dardani]] and the [[Moesia]]ns, for which he won a military [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. He was the first Roman general to penetrate to the [[Danube]].

A friend of [[Cicero]], he supported him during the [[Catiline]] Conspiracy. Curio spoke in favor of [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] when he was on trial for violating the rites of [[Bona Dea]]. Cicero spoke out against Clodius and Curio, though this did not interfere with their friendship. He became an opponent to [[Julius Caesar]] and wrote a political dialogue against him. Curio died in 53 BC.

==Junior==
'''Gaius Scribonius Curio''' (d. 49 BC) was the son of Gaius Scribonius Curio. He was a friend to [[Pompey]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cicero]]. He was known as a distinguished orator. Curio's character was very conspicuous and profligate. Despite his faults, Cicero assisted him in every way and evidently wrote several letters to him.

Curio built Rome’s first [[amphitheatre]], with seating built on a pivot that could move the entire audience, in his father’s memory and celebrated games there. About 52 BC, he married [[Fulvia]], a granddaughter of [[Gaius Gracchus]]. He had a stepdaughter, [[Claudia Pulchra (wife of Augustus)|Clodia Pulchra]], but no natural children.

During his term as [[tribune]] in 50 BC, he became a supporter of Caesar. In return for his support, Caesar paid off his debt. According to [[Tacitus]], Caesar bribed him for his oratory.
Before the Civil War, Curio was one of the last politicians to call on Pompey and Caesar to make peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unrv.com/fall-republic/crossing-the-rubicon.php |title=Crossing the Rubicon |publisher=Unrv.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curio was [[praetor]] in 49 BC. While fighting under Caesar, he was sent to Africa to stop King [[Juba I of Numidia]] (a supporter of Pompey). Although he won the [[Battle of Utica (49 BC)]], he was eventually defeated by Juba, along with aid from [[Publius Attius Varus|Attius Varus]], at the [[Battle of the Bagradas River (49 BC)|Second Battle of the Bagradas River]] and fought to his death, along with his army, rather than attempting to flee to his camp.

'''George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville''', [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]] (26 January 1716 &amp;ndash; 26 August 1785), styled '''The Honourable George Sackville''' until 1720, '''Lord George Sackville''' from 1720 to 1770 and '''Lord George Germain''' from 1770 to 1782, was a [[Great Britain|British]] soldier and politician who was [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Secretary of State]] for [[British America|America]] in [[Frederick North|Lord North]]'s cabinet during the [[American War of Independence]].

His ministry received much of the blame for Britain's loss of [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen American colonies]]. His issuance of detailed instructions in military matters, coupled with his failure to understand either the geography of the colonies or the determination of the colonists, may justify this conclusion. He had two careers. His military career had distinction, but ended with a court martial.. Sackville served in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] and the [[Seven Years' War]], including at the decisive [[Battle of Minden]].  His political career ended with the fall of the North government in March 1782.

==Background and education==
Sackville was the third son of [[Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset]], and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Lieutenant-General [[Walter Philip Colyear]]. His [[Godparent|Godfather]] [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] attended his [[baptism]].&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub p.31&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Westminster School]] in [[London]] and graduated from [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] in [[Dublin]] in 1737. Between 1730 and 1737 and again from 1750 to 1755, his father held the post of [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]]. While in Dublin he befriended the celebrated writer [[Jonathan Swift]].&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub p.31&lt;/ref&gt; He also encountered [[John Ligonier, 1st Earl Ligonier|Lord Ligonier]] who would later assist his career in the military.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

He then entered the army. Sackville was elected Grandmaster of the [[Grand Lodge of Ireland]] in 1751, serving in this post for the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Waite | first = Arthur Edward | publisher = Cosimo, Inc. | title = A New Encyclopedia of Freemasonry | volume = vol. I | year = 2007 | ISBN = 1-60206-641-8 | page = 400 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
He married Diana Sambrooke, daughter of John Sambrooke and Elizabeth Forester, on 3 September 1754. They had two sons and three daughters, including:
*Hon. Diana Sackville (8 July 1756 – 29 August 1814).
*[[Charles Sackville-Germain, 5th Duke of Dorset|Hon. Charles Sackville]] (27 August 1767 – 29 July 1843), later changed his name to Charles Sackville-Germain.
*George Sackville (7 December 1770 - 31 May 1836)
*Elizabeth, married [[Henry Arthur Herbert (1756–1821)|Henry Herbert]], MP

==Early military career==
{{further|Great Britain in the Seven Years War}}
Sackville started as a captain in the [[7th Horse]] (later the [[6th Dragoon Guards]]). In 1740, he transferred to the [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] of Foot as a lieutenant colonel. The regiment was sent to [[Germany]] to participate in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. In 1743. Sackville was advanced to [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] colonel.

===Battle of Fontenoy===
{{Main|Battle of Fontenoy}}
[[File:The Battle of Fontenoy 1745.png|thumb|200xpx|left|The [[Battle of Fontenoy]] in 1745 where Sackville first distinguished himself. He was wounded and captured by the French.]]
He saw his first battle, leading the charge of the [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]]'s infantry in the [[Battle of Fontenoy]] in 1745. He led his regiment so deep into the French lines that when he was wounded and captured he was taken to the tent of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]].&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub p.30-31&lt;/ref&gt; When he was released and returned home, it was to duty in [[Scotland]] as the Colonel of the [[Lancashire Fusiliers|20th Foot]] Regiment.

In 1747 and 1748, he again joined the [[Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]]. He became colonel of the [[7th Irish horse]] and served in [[Netherlands|Holland]]. There was a break in his military career between wars (1750-1755) when he served as first secretary to his father.

During the [[Seven Years' War]], Sackville returned to active military service. He had been considered for the post of Commander-in-Chief in North America, which eventually went to [[Edward Braddock]] who led his force to disaster during the [[Braddock Campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub p.32&lt;/ref&gt; In 1755, he was promoted to major general and returned to active service to oversee ordnance. In 1758, he was given a fourth regiment and joined the [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] as a lieutenant general. He was sworn of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in January 1758.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=9760 |date=24 January 1758 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raid on St Malo===
{{Main|Raid on St Malo}}
In June 1758 Sackville was second in command of a British expedition led by Marlborough which attempted an amphibious [[Raid on St Malo]]. While it failed to take the town as instructed, the raid was still considered to have been largely successful as a diversion. Follow-up raids were considered against [[Le Havre]], [[Caen]] and other targets in [[Normandy]] but no further landings were attempted and the force returned home.

Later in 1758 they joined the allied forces of [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick]] in Germany, with the first detachment of British troops sent to the Continent. When Marlborough died, Sackville became Commander of the British contingent of the army, although still under the overall command of the Duke of Brunswick.

==Battle of Minden==
{{Main|Battle of Minden}}
In the [[Battle of Minden]] on 1 August 1759, British and Hanoverian infantry of the centre made an advance on the French cavalry and artillery in that sector. They apparently went in without orders and their attacking line formation even repulsed repeated French cavalry charges, holding until the last moment then firing a massive volley when the charge came within ten yards. As the disrupted French began to fall back on [[Minden]], Ferdinand called for a British cavalry charge to complete the victory, but Sackville withheld permission for their advance. Ferdinand sent his order several times, but Sackville was estranged from [[John Manners, Marquess of Granby|Lord Granby]], the force commander. He continued to withhold permission for Granby to ''gain glory'' through an attack. For this action, he was [[cashiered]] and sent home. Granby replaced him as commander of the British contingent for the remainder of the war.

===Court martial===
Sackville refused to accept responsibility for refusing to obey orders. Back in England, he demanded a [[court martial]], and made it a large enough issue that he obtained his demand in 1760. The court found him guilty, and imposed one of the strangest and strongest verdicts ever rendered against a general officer. The court's verdict not only upheld his discharge, but ruled that he was ''"...unfit to serve his Majesty in any military capacity whatsoever"'', then ordered that their verdict be read to and entered in the orderly book of every regiment in the army. The king had his name struck from the [[Privy Council]] rolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=9994 |date=22 April 1760 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
[[Image:The state tinkers.jpg|thumb|right|In ''The State Tinkers'' (1780), [[James Gillray]] caricatured Germain (second from left) and his political allies as incompetent tinkers of the National Kettle. Posted on the wall behind Germain is the "Plan of Minden".]]
Sackville had been a Member of Parliament at intervals since 1733. He had served terms in both the Dublin and the Westminster bodies, sometimes simultaneously, but had not taken sides in political wrangles.

Between 1750 and 1755 he served as [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], during his father's second term as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

When [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] took the throne in 1760, Sackville began his political rehabilitation. There did not seem to be negative repercussions to the European stalemate of the [[Seven Years' War]]. The victories over the French within the colonial empire provided a chance for events of the war to be forgotten. The difficulty of repaying the debts incurred to fight the war caused a period of unstable ministries and shifting political alliances. In 1765, King George quietly returned him to the rolls of the Privy Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=10584 |date=17 December 1765 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Drayton House, south-east front-geograph.org.uk-2484619.jpg|thumb|Drayton House]]
Initially he was a follower of [[George Grenville]]'s faction but he increasingly lined up as a supporter of [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] and, in 1769, he made this alliance formal. Then, in 1769, Lady [[Elizabeth Germain]] died without natural heirs, and left her estates, including [[Drayton House|Drayton, Northamptonshire]], to him. This not only improved his finances, it also gave him the chance to take that name formally. After 1770, he was known as Lord George Germain.

==Secretary of State==

===Appointment===
On 10 November 1775, Germain was appointed [[Secretary of State for the American Department]] replacing [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth|Lord Dartmouth]] in the post.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub p.26&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, North's cabinet had three secretaries of state; one each for Europe (the [[Secretary of State for the Northern Department|Northern Department]]), America, and the rest of the world (the [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department|Southern Department]]). Besides [[international relations]], these secretaries were responsible for a great deal of Colonial administration and for military operations within their area. This made Germain the primary minister responsible for suppressing the rebellion that had broken out in 1775 in the colonies. He promoted or relieved Generals, took care of provisions and supplies, and became involved with the strategic planning of the war.

===American War of Independence===
{{Main|American War of Independence}}
Sackville and Lord North made three assumptions about the war they were about to face: firstly, the American forces could not withstand the assaults of the British; secondly, the war would be similar to wars they had fought successfully in Europe; and lastly, their victory would bring about their goal of having the colonies' allegiance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} All of their assumptions proved to be false, with the limited and unhelpful exception of the first, in that the American forces usually could not withstand the assaults of the British in open battle but instead adopted other, more successful, tactics.

In 1776 he worked with General [[John Burgoyne|Burgoyne]] to plan, support and issue orders for the [[Saratoga campaign]]. However, his unclear orders to [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|General Howe]] contributed to the campaign's failure. Following the entry of France, Spain and the [[Dutch Republic]] into the conflict, British emphasis shifted to focus increasingly on a [[World war|global war]]. British troops were withdrawn from [[Philadelphia]] and reinforcements were sent to the valuable sugar-producing [[West Indies]]. In 1779 one of Germain's associates, [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]] was sent to [[Madrid]] for talks designed to reach a separate peace settlement with Spain, but this attempt failed.

===Yorktown===
{{Main|Yorktown Campaign}}
In 1781, the confusion involving orders sent to [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Cornwallis]] from [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Clinton]] contributed to the loss at [[siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]].
The news of Yorktown reached London on 25 November 1781 and the messenger went first to Germain's residence at [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]].&lt;ref&gt;Whiteley p.195&lt;/ref&gt; Germain then went to tell other ministers. Together they went to Lord North who reportedly cried out "Oh God - It's all over". It was agreed that Germain, rather than North, should take the news to the King who was at [[Kew Palace|Kew]].&lt;ref&gt;Whiteley p.195-196&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Speech from the throne|King's Speech]] two days later had to be re-written in light of Yorktown. News of the surrender galvanised the Opposition and government majorities began to shrink over the following months with calls for resignations of senior ministers. Germain drew up a plan to continue the war using the existing British bases in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] and Canada to harass the American coastline and frontiers.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub p.308&lt;/ref&gt; He also advocated re-occupying [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] in [[Rhode Island]] to give a foothold in [[New England]].

==={{anchor|Departure from office}}Departure from office===
Germain became a target for the opposition, and was eventually persuaded to step down in exchange for a peerage, and in February 1782 he was made '''Baron Bolebrooke''', in the County of Sussex, and '''Viscount Sackville''', of Drayton in the County of Northampton.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=12268 |date=5 February 1782 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was considered essential if the North government was to survive by bringing in factions of the opposition, to whom Germain was personally objectionable. He was replaced by [[Welbore Ellis, 1st Baron Mendip|Welbore Ellis]]. In spite of Germain's departure, the North government fell shortly afterwards in February 1782 and was followed by a period of political instability. Shortly after the fall of the North government, news arrived of the decisive British naval victory at the [[Battle of the Saintes]] in the Caribbean, which would have boosted the government had it still been in power.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Shelburne Ministry|Shelburne government]] agreed to the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]], bringing an end to the war in 1783 and recognising the independence of the United States.

==Later life==
[[File:Stoneland lodge.jpg|thumb|Stoneland Lodge, Sussex]]
The controversy over Lord Sackville's handling of the war continued. Some members were opposed to his taking a seat in the [[House of Lords]], an almost unprecedented incident. In spite of this he was admitted to the Lords, where he was staunchly defended by [[Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow|Lord Thurlow]], and his declining health soon made the issue irrelevant. He retired to his country home at Stoneland Lodge and died there in 1785. He maintained to his dying day that he had not been a coward at Minden. Following his death, a defence of Sackville's reputation, ''The character of the late Viscount Sackville'', was written by Richard Cumberland.

The Drayton House estate passed to his son Charles, who later became the 5th (and last) Duke of Dorset. The Stoneland estate (or Buckhurst Park as it came to be known) passed via the wife of the late 3rd Duke of Dorset to her daughter [[Elizabeth Sackville-West, Countess De La Warr|Countess de la Warr]] on the Dowager Duchess's death in 1825.

'''Horace Parlan''' (January 19, 1931, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania – February 23, 2017, Korsør, Denmark&lt;ref&gt;[http://sn.dk/Danmark/Jazzlegenden-Horace-Parlan-er-doed/artikel/637111 Jazzlegenden Horace Parlan er død - sn.dk - Forsiden - Midt-Sydsjælland - Slagelse&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;) was an American [[hard bop]] and [[post-bop]] pianist and composer. He was known for his contributions to the [[Charles Mingus]] recordings ''[[Mingus Ah Um]]'' and ''[[Blues &amp; Roots]]''.

==Early life==
In his birth year, Parlan was stricken with polio, resulting in the partial crippling of his right hand. The handicap contributed to his development of a particularly "pungent" left-hand chord voicing style, while comping with highly rhythmic phrases with the right.&lt;ref name="feather"/&gt;

==Later life and career==
Between 1952 and 1957, he worked in Washington DC with [[Sonny Stitt]], then spent two years with Mingus' Jazz Workshop.&lt;ref name="feather"/&gt;  In 1973, Parlan moved to Copenhagen, Denmark. He later settled in the small village of Rude in southern [[Zealand]]. In 1974 he completed a State Department tour of Africa with [[Hal Singer]].&lt;ref name="feather"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ma1BpsFE1WoC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=Jazz+encyclop+AND+%22Victor+Gaskin%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ttqg8XTFbt&amp;sig=PqgjYwIJ7xFG6BHERQzQM4TU7pI&amp;hl=es&amp;ei=yN2JSpWRBZuZjAfBkZmiCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=snippet&amp;q=hal%20singer&amp;f=false Feather, Leonard &amp; Gitler, Ira ''The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz'' Oxford University Press US, 2007] {{ISBN|9780195320008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His later work, such as a series of duos with the tenor saxophonist [[Archie Shepp]] included the album ''[[Goin' Home (Archie Shepp and Horace Parlan album)|Goin' Home]]'', steeped in [[gospel music]].

Parlan received the [[Ben Webster Prize|2000 Ben Webster Prize]] awarded by the [[Ben Webster Foundation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15635">Prof. Dr. '''I Made Bandem''' (also known as "the Joe Papp of Bali") is a [[Bali]]nese dancer, artist, author, and educator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/19/arts/theater-the-joe-papp-of-bali-finds-himself-in-a-cultural-pickle.html|first=Suzanne|last=Charle|title=The Joe Papp of Bali Finds Himself In a Cultural Pickle|journal=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 19, 1990|accessdate=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bandem studied [[Balinese dance]] from a very early age, and was performing [[Baris (dance)|Baris]] and other dances by the age of ten. One of the first Balinese dancers to study in the [[United States]], Bandem earned his master's degree in [[dance]] from [[UCLA]], and his PhD in [[ethnomusicology]] from [[Wesleyan University]]. Bandem's academic career includes sixteen years as the director of the [[Indonesian Institute of the Arts, Denpasar|Indonesian College of the Arts]] in [[Denpasar]], and was also the Rector(President) of Indonesia's oldest cultural institution, the [http://www.isi.ac.id Institut Seni Indonesia - Jogjakarta (Indonesian Institute of The Arts - Jogjakarta)]. Dr. Bandem is succeeded by '''Prof. Soeprapto Soedjono, B.A., M.F.A., Ph.D''' as the current Rector(President) of The Indonesian Institute of the Art - Jogjakarta. Dr. Bandem is currently a professor of Balinese dance and music at The [[College of the Holy Cross]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].

At Holy Cross, Bandem currently teaches both music and dance dealing with the Bali-Gamelan. He is well respected throughout Bali and many other countries as an integral component to the recognition, respect, and continuation of the Balinese culture.

As an artist and as a visiting scholar, Bandem has taught and performed Balinese dance throughout the world.

Bandem’s accomplishment and contribution to arts and culture can be group into four major domains including achievements in [[ethnomusicology]], [[:Category:Educational administration|educational administration]], arts and culture management, and political career.

==Ethnomusicology==
Bandem is the first Indonesian to accomplish the Ph.D title in [[ethnomusicology]] from [[Wesleyan University]], [[Middletown, Connecticut]] (1980). As a scholar in the field of world music, Bandem fathoms and advances a school of thought popularly termed as the “bi-musicality” that was initially promoted by Prof. Dr. [[Mantle Hood]]. Bandem refers bi-musicality as a conception that music is a universal language and every ethnomusicologist must comprehend more than one genre of world music.

During his studies in the USA, Bandem learnt and came to terms with sounds and rhythms from around the world including music genre of [[Japan]], [[Thailand]], [[Korea]], as well as [[China]]. In return, such experience gave Bandem the capabilities and firmness to conduct in-depth research of various Nusantara (Indonesian) music including [[Kalimantan]], [[Sulawesi]], [[Java]], and [[Bali]]. Aside from immersing himself in the studies of world music, Bandem also mastered the integral aspects of dance and theatre – all influencing his scientific approaches.

As an ethnomusicologist, Bandem has published plenty of books and scientific articles pertaining arts and culture, both nationally and internationally. One of his writing that is highly regarded as a classic by artists of music, dance, and theatre is the book ''[[Kaja and Kelod: Balinese Dance in Transition]]'' (1981; reprinted 1995) and distributed by [[Oxford University Press]], [[Kuala Lumpur]]. This book has induced worldwide appreciation upon the arts and culture of Bali. Other theoretical publications about music, dance, and theatre of Indonesia include ''[[Prakempa: A Cosmology in Balinese Music]]'', ''[[Wayang Wong in Contemporary Bali]]'', ''[[Traditional Theatre of Indonesia]]'', and ''[[Encyclopedia of Balinese Dance]]'' – all these books are text books and reference for those studying Indonesian arts. Aside from writings concerning performing arts, Bandem also possess great interest in fine arts, and many of his articles are closely related to historical and aesthetic studies of Indonesian fine arts.
	
Bandem’s commitment in ethnomusicology augmented with the establishment of an Indonesian music association namely Masyarakat Musicology Indonesia (MMI) by him and a group of friends in 1985. MMI hails from [[Surakarta]], Central Java, and Bandem was the first chairman of the non-profit association. Today, MMI has advanced as Masyarakat Seni Pertunjukan Indonesia (MSPI), as a center for research, creation, and development of Indonesian arts, both classic and contemporary. With this organization, Bandem has managed to raise and popularize ethnomusicology as a major discipline in art universities in Indonesia.

In 1986, Bandem initiated The First International Gamelan Festival; an evaluation on the advancement of gamelan in the global milieu that was conducted in conjunction with the [[Expo 86|1986 Vancouver Expo]] in [[Canada]]. During the festival, more than 250 delegates participated and represented gamelan (traditional Indonesian music orchestra) and ethnic music groups from all over the world. The festival is evidence that Indonesian music especially its various sorts of gamelan are integral part of the world music setting.

Bandem played an important role in the progression of Indonesian arts and culture through teachings in many universities including the [[University of Hawaii]], [[University of California, Los Angeles]], [[Wesleyan University]], [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]] and [[Brown University]].

The outstanding response led to the amplification of studies upon the Indonesian arts and culture particularly in the learning of the music and dance.

Consequently, many leading universities in the United States of America, Canada, Japan and Europe sought the inclusion of Indonesian art and culture studies into their curriculum. According to Balungan and Ear Magazine, there are more than 300 active gamelan groups around North America, Europe, Japan and Australia.

In 2006, Bandem was awarded the [[Fumio Koizumi Prize]] for his dedication and long life achievement in the field of ethnomusicology.

==Educational Administration==
After attaining his Ph.D, Bandem returned to Indonesia from the USA and was appointed as the Chancellor of the [[Indonesia Dance Academy]] (ASTI) Denpasar by the [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Indonesia)|Ministry of Education and Culture]] (1982). Since then, Bandem exerted great effort to amplify the institution’s status to become Indonesian Arts College (STSI) Denpasar and now Indonesia Institute of Arts. The efforts to increase the status of the institution to a higher level is not only a matter of political administration, but more a struggle to advocate arts as science, to equally position art in contrast to other field of studies. This struggle becomes imperative as the majority of Indonesia still view art as a profession (vocation), not a substantial field of study.

Bandem’s formulation of art from the perspective of [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], and [[axiology]] became the groundwork for the Ministry Department of National Education Indonesia to permit Indonesian art universities to conduct S-1, S-2 (Master of Art), and S-3 (Ph.D.) programs. Bandem’s effort with the collective support from other art scientists in Indonesia entitled Indonesia Institute of Arts (ISI) Jogjakarta to conduct and award Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) and Doctor of Creative Art (DCA) in the field of art.

As an educational administrator, Bandem was trusted by the Ministry Department of National Education Indonesia to lead ASTI Denpasar (1981-1989), STSI Denpasar (1989-1997) and ISI Jogjakarta (1997-2006). In his 25 years in office, many of his conceptions became the model for the development of art universities in Indonesia.

In 1998, Bandem successfully established [[Badan Kerjasama Perguruan Tinggi Seni]] Indonesia (Indonesia Art University Cooperative Board). This association has initiated and produced the “New Paradigm of Art Universities”, a manual being used as the foundation to conduct higher learning of arts in Indonesia. Bandem truly plays a central role in increasing the quality of art education in Indonesia.

In conjunction to his duties as Rector of art universities over the past 25 years, Bandem was also given responsibility by the National Government as Secretary and Consortium Member of [[Komisi Disiplin Ilmu Seni]] (Commission for Art Discipline) that is an integral aspect of [[Indonesian Academy of Sciences]]. Bandem was also member of [[Badan Pertimbangan Pendidikan Nasional]] (Advisory Board of National Education), an organization pertaining national education under the direct supervision of the President of Republic Indonesia. Bandem dedicated his ideas through this governing body to make education in Indonesia as education for unity in diversity and to influence the government to implement multimedia based education. In response to such policy, currently Bandem is the chancellor of a leading information and computer technology university in Bali.

==Arts and Culture Management==
As an artist, Bandem also learns and performs the dances and music of other cultures. While Bandem is well known for his creative directing in monumental works in Balinese performing arts, he also masters the [[Gagaku]] and [[Bugaku]], the classical Japanese music and dance that he learned from his teacher [[Matsaro Togi]], a national treasure of classical Japanese dance.

Furthermore, Bandem is also a culture engineer. His policy on preservation and development of the traditional Balinese arts and culture is formulated into a strategic development plan termed Sustainable Development with Cultural Orientation. One interesting interpretation of this policy is Continuity in Change, an aspect elaborated and practiced in many occasions including the Bali Arts Festival.

Together with Prof. Dr. [[Ida Bagus Mantra]], the Governor of Bali (1978-1988), Bandem is among the founding fathers and driving force behind the [[Bali Arts Festival]]. This annual event has become a mental model for the preservation and development of the Balinese arts and culture as a whole. Currently, The Bali Arts Festival has entered its 27th year

Bandem has been actively involved in outlining the annual theme of the Bali Arts Festival from 1980 to 1997, as well as being executive producer and creative directors of numerous performances for the festival.

The successful impact of the Bali Arts Festival as means for arts and culture development has influenced the province of [[Yunnan]] in China to implement such festival. Bandem became the consultant for the festival particularly outlining preservation and development strategies for the arts and culture of minority groups within.

Bandem was also the Artistic Director for many Indonesian performances in numerous World Expos and other International Arts Festival. These include [[Expo 86|Expo Vancouver (1986)]], [[Expo '88|Expo Brisbane (1988)]], Indonesian Festival in USA (1990, 1991), [[Seville Expo '92|Expo Sevilla (1992)]], [[Hanover Fair]] (1995) and [[Indonesia Japan Friendship Festival]] (1997).

For his role and influence in increasing quality of output and abundance of art masterpieces receiving great reviews in and abroad, Collin's Guide to Bali refers Bandem as the "Bali Art Czar".

In 1997, Bandem also accomplished the establishment of the [[Museum Gamelan]] (The Museum for Musical Instruments of Indonesia) within the dynamic compounds of the Indonesian Arts College (STSI, now ISI) Denpasar. The museum itself holds the largest collection of musical ensembles native to Indonesia, where all musical ensembles as well as the hundreds of various musical instruments being displayed are intended to become a medium for arts education. The museum is equipped with an archive centre that holds various forms of recordings, all representing documentation of the arts and culture. Other collections on exhibit include dance costumes, masks, shadow puppets, sculpture and paintings.

His devotion to fine arts is profuse and is advanced through active participation within the fine art scene. Together with his diverse network of arts and culture enthusiasts, Bandem established the first ever [[Bali Biennale]]; the biannual visual arts exhibition in 2005.

The holding of both the Pre-Bali Biennale in 5 cities in Java and 9 venues in Bali, as well as the Summit Event Bali Biennale in 9 venues in Bali as well as the Cartoon Pavilion is a reconstruction upon the traditional creative propensities of Balinese visual arts, as creativity is not grouped on the base of its customary aesthetic style, school and movement but is viewed from the perspective of Bali as a geo-culture unity that corresponds to the greater multiculturalism in today’s global society.

Bandem is the current chairman of the Bali Biennale Organizing Committee.

In 1994, [[UNESCO]] awarded the International UNESCO Music Council Award to Bandem as recognition upon his wholehearted attention and dedication upon the world of arts and culture as well as the implementation of his concepts.

==Political career==
Bandem grew interest in the field of practical politics since senior high school and he has been trusted by his colleagues to lead a political organization called GSNI. Bandem not only took charge of the senior high school level organization, but also became the Vice Chairmen of GSNI for Bali.

During his time in the USA particularly in Hawaii and California, Bandem actively lead PERMIAS (Indonesian Student Association in United States of America). Bandem’s extensive network abroad has been constructed since these times.

After completing his doctoral studies in USA, Bandem returned to Bali and continued his enthusiasm in Indonesian politics. Soon after his return, Bandem was appointed as the Vice Chairmen of the major political party [[Golkar|Golongan Karya]] in Bali from 1982-1998. This position permitted Bandem to become a member of the Indonesian House Assembly (MPR-RI) as state representative for the Province of Bali (1988-1998).

During his time as member of the Indonesian House Assembly (MPR-RI), Bandem was elected as the Secretary and Speaker for the Ad Hoc II Committee that is responsible for strategies and decisions of the national politics. Through this committee, Bandem demonstrated his keenness for Indonesian character building from the viewpoint of arts and culture.

Furthermore, although unsuccessful, Bandem was supported by the Balinese public as candidate for the 1998-2003 Governor of Bali during the 1998 election.

Taken as a whole, Bandem’s stance towards the significance of arts and culture as a vibrant counterpart to the pulsating dynamics of socio-culture, political, and technology represents a notion that arts and culture are imperative elements for peace, concord, and the betterment of the world.

His belief for cordial cross-border interconnectedness by the means of arts and culture has bestowed him the Habibie Award in 2003 from the Habibie Center. 
 
His pro-active approach has emphasized the importance of arts and culture as a reflective conscious to attain harmony among nations especially between respective cultures and the global forces.

'''Joachim du Bellay''' (also '''Joachim Du Bellay'''; {{IPA-fr|ʒoaʃɛ̃ dy bɛlɛ|lang}}; c. 1522 &amp;ndash; 1 January 1560)&lt;ref name="Smith1974"/&gt; was a [[France|French]] [[poet]], [[critic]], and a member of the [[La Pléiade|Pléiade]].

==Biography==
Joachim du Bellay was born at the Castle of La Turmelière, not far from [[Liré]], near [[Angers]], being the son of Jean du Bellay, Lord of Gonnor, first cousin of the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] [[Jean du Bellay]] and of [[Guillaume du Bellay]].  His mother was Renée Chabot, daughter of Perceval Chabot and heiress of La Turmelière (''Plus me plaît le séjour qu'ont bâti mes aïeux'').

Both his parents died while he was still a child, and he was left to the guardianship of his elder brother, René du Bellay, who neglected his education, leaving him to run wild at La Turmelière.  When he was twenty-three, however, he received permission to study [[law]] at the [[University of Poitiers]], no doubt with a view to his obtaining preferment through his kinsman the Cardinal Jean du Bellay.  At [[Poitiers]] he came in contact with the [[Humanism|humanist]] [[Marc Antoine Muret]], and with [[Jean Salmon Macrin]] (1490–1557), a [[Latin]] poet famous in his day.  There too he probably met [[Jacques Peletier du Mans]], who had published a translation of the ''Ars Poetica'' of [[Horace]], with a preface in which much of the program advocated later by [[La Pléiade]] is to be found in outline.

It was probably in 1547 that du Bellay met [[Pierre de Ronsard|Ronsard]] in an inn on the way to Poitiers, an event which may justly be regarded as the starting-point of the French school of [[Renaissance]] poetry.  The two had much in common, and became fast friends.  Du Bellay returned with Ronsard to [[Paris]] to join the circle of students of the humanities attached to [[Jean Daurat|Jean Dorat]] at the Collège de Coqueret.

While Ronsard and [[Jean-Antoine de Baïf]] were most influenced by Greek models, du Bellay was more especially a [[Latinist]], and perhaps his preference for a language so nearly connected with his own had some part in determining the more national and familiar note of his [[poetry]].  In 1548 appeared the ''Art poétique'' of [[Thomas Sébillet]], who enunciated many of the ideas that Ronsard and his followers had at heart, though with essential differences in the point of view, since he held up as models [[Clément Marot]] and his disciples.  Ronsard and his friends dissented violently from Sébillet on this and other points, and they doubtless felt a natural resentment at finding their ideas forestalled and, moreover, inadequately presented.

The famous manifesto of the Pléiade, the ''[[La Défense et illustration de la langue française|Défense et illustration de la langue française]]'' (Defense and Illustration of the French Language, 1549), was at once a complement and a refutation of Sébillet's treatise.  This book (inspired in part by [[Sperone Speroni]]'s ''Dialogo delle lingue'', 1542) was the expression of the literary principles of the Pléiade as a whole, but although Ronsard was the chosen leader, its redaction was entrusted to du Bellay.  This work also bolstered French political debate as a means of learned men to reform their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Colin|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of France|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-43294-4|page=133|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To obtain a clear view of the reforms aimed at by the Pléiade, the Defence should be further considered in connection with Ronsard's ''Abrégé d'art poétique'' and his preface to the ''Franciade''.  Du Bellay maintained that the French language as it was then constituted was too poor to serve as a medium for the higher forms of poetry, but he contended that by proper cultivation it might be brought on a level with the classical tongues.  He condemned those who despaired of their [[mother tongue]], and used Latin for their more serious and ambitious work.  For translations from the ancients he would substitute imitations, though he does not in the Defense explain precisely how one is to go about this.  Not only were the forms of classical poetry to be imitated, but a separate poetic language and style, distinct from those employed in prose, were to be used.  The French language was to be enriched by a development of its internal resources and by discreet borrowing from Italian, Latin and Greek.  Both du Bellay and Ronsard laid stress on the necessity of prudence in these borrowings, and both repudiated the charge of wishing to Latinize their mother tongue.  The book was a spirited defence of poetry and of the possibilities of the French language; it was also a declaration of war on those writers who held less heroic views.

The violent attacks made by du Bellay on Marot and his followers, and on Sébillet, did not go unanswered.  Sébillet replied in the preface to his translation of the ''Iphigenia'' of [[Euripides]]; [[Guillaume des Autels]], a [[Lyon]]nese poet, reproached du Bellay with ingratitude to his predecessors, and showed the weakness of his argument for imitation as opposed to translation in a digression in his ''Réplique aux furieuses defenses de Louis Meigret'' (Lyons, 1550); [[Barthélemy Aneau]], regent of the Collège de la Trinité at Lyons, attacked him in his ''[[:fr:Quintil|Quintil]] Horatian'' (Lyons, 1551), the authorship of which was commonly attributed to Charles Fontaine.  Aneau pointed out the obvious inconsistency of inculcating imitation of the ancients and depreciating native poets in a work professing to be a defence of the [[French language]].

Du Bellay replied to his various assailants in a preface to the second edition (1550) of his sonnet sequence ''Olive'', with which he also published two polemical poems, the ''Musagnaeomachie'', and an ode addressed to Ronsard, ''Contre les envieux fioles''.  ''Olive'', a collection of sonnets modeled after the poetry of [[Petrarch]], [[Ariosto]], and contemporary Italians published by [[Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari]], first appeared in 1549.  With it were printed thirteen odes entitled ''Vers lyriques''.  ''Olive'' has been supposed to be an anagram for the name of a ''Mlle Viole'', but there is little evidence of real passion in the poems, and they may perhaps be regarded as a Petrarchan exercise, especially as, in the second edition, the dedication to his lady is exchanged for one to [[Marguerite de Valois]], daughter of [[Henry II of France|Henry II]].  Du Bellay did not actually introduce the sonnet into French poetry, but he acclimatized it; and when the fashion of sonneteering became a mania he was one of the first to ridicule its excesses.

About this time du Bellay had a serious illness of two years' duration, from which dates the beginning of his deafness.  He had further anxieties in the guardianship of his nephew.  The boy died in 1553, and Joachim, who had up to this time borne the title of ''sieur de Liré'', became ''seigneur'' of Gonnor.  In 1549 he had published a ''Recueil de poésies'' dedicated to the Princess Marguerite.  This was followed in 1552 by a version of the fourth book of the ''[[Aeneid]]'', with other translations and some [[occasional poems]].

In the next year he went to [[Rome]] as one of the secretaries of Cardinal du Bellay.  To the beginning of his four and a half years' residence in Italy belong the forty-seven sonnets of his ''Antiquités de Rome'', which were rendered into English by [[Edmund Spenser]] (''[[The Ruins of Rome]]'', 1591).  These sonnets were more personal and less imitative than the Olive sequence, and struck a note which was revived in later French literature by [[Constantin-François de Chassebœuf, Comte de Volney|Volney]] and [[François-René de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]].  His stay in Rome was, however, a real exile.  His duties were those of an attendant.  He had to meet the cardinal's creditors and to find money for the expenses of the household.  Nevertheless, he found many friends among Italian scholars, and formed a close friendship with another exiled poet whose circumstances were similar to his own, Olivier de Magny.

Towards the end of his sojourn in Rome he fell violently in love with a Roman lady called Faustine, who appears in his poetry as Columba and Columbelle.  This passion finds its clearest expression in the Latin poems.  Faustine was guarded by an old and jealous husband, and du Bellay's eventual conquest may have had something to do with his departure for Paris at the end of August 1557.  In the next year he published the poems he had brought back with him from Rome, the Latin Poemata, the ''Antiquités de Rome'', the ''Divers Jeux Rustiques'', and the 191 sonnets of the ''[[Les Regrets|Regrets]]'', the greater number of which were written in Italy.  The ''Regrets'' show that he had moved away from the theories of the ''Défence''.

The simplicity and tenderness specially characteristic of du Bellay appear in the sonnets telling of his unlucky passion for Faustine, and of his nostalgia for the banks of the Loire.  Among them are some satirical sonnets describing Roman manners, and the later ones written after his return to Paris are often appeals for patronage.  His intimate relations with Ronsard were not renewed, but he formed a close friendship with the scholar Jean de Morel, whose house was the centre of a learned society.  In 1559 du Bellay published at Poitiers ''La Nouvelle Manière de faire son profit des lettres'', a satirical epistle translated from the Latin of [[Adrianus Turnebus|Adrien Turnèbe]], and with it ''Le Poète courtisan'', which introduced the formal satire into French poetry.  The Nouvelle Manière is believed to be directed at Pierre de Paschal, who was elected as royal historiographer, and who had promised to write Latin biographies of the great, but who in fact never wrote anything of the sort.  Both works were published under the pseudonym of J Quintil du Troussay, and the courtier-poet was generally supposed to be [[Mellin de Saint-Gelais]], with whom du Bellay had always, however, been on friendly terms.

==Last works and death==
A long and eloquent ''Discours au roi'' (detailing the duties of a prince, and translated from a Latin original written by [[Michel de l'Hôpital]], now lost) was dedicated to Francis II in 1559, and is said to have secured for the poet a tardy pension, although it was not published until 1567, after his death.&lt;ref name="Smith1974"&gt;{{cite book|author=Malcolm Smith|title=Joachim Du Bellay's Veiled Victim: With an Edition of the Xenia, Seu Illustrium Quorundam Nominum Allusiones|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nu9qb-_ZEKYC&amp;pg=PA50|year=1974|publisher=Librairie Droz|isbn=978-2-600-03901-7|pages=50–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Paris he was still in the employ of the cardinal, who delegated to him the lay patronage which he still retained in the diocese.  In the exercise of these functions Joachim quarrelled with [[Eustache du Bellay]], [[bishop of Paris]], who prejudiced his relations with the cardinal, less cordial since the publication of the outspoken ''Regrets''.  His chief patron, Marguerite de Valois, to whom he was sincerely attached, had gone to [[Savoy]].  Du Bellay's health was weak; his deafness seriously hindered his official duties; and on 1 January 1560 he died at the age of 38.  There is no evidence that he was in priest's orders, but he was a clerk, and as such held various preferments.  He had at one time been a canon of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] of Paris, and was accordingly buried in the cathedral.  The statement that he was nominated [[archbishop of Bordeaux]] during the last year of life is unauthenticated by documentary evidence and is in itself extremely improbable.

==Bibliography==
The best edition of his collected works in French is still that produced by Henri Chamard in six volumes.  Also, there are the ''Œuvres francaises'' (2 vols., 1866–1867), edited with introduction and notes by [[C. Marty-Laveaux]] in his ''Pléiade française''.  His ''Œuvres choisies'' were published by [[L. Becq de Fouquières]] in 1876.  The chief source of his biography is his own poetry, especially the Latin elegy addressed to Jean de Morel, "''Elegia ad Janum Morellum Ebredunensem, Pytadem suum''," printed with a volume of [[Xenia (book)|Xenia]] (Paris, 1569).  A study of his life and writings by H. Chamard, forming vol. viii. of the ''Travaux et mémoires de l'université de Lille'' (Lute, 1900), contains all the available information and corrects many common errors.

'''John Napier of Merchiston''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|eɪ|p|ɪər}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/napier "Napier"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 1550&amp;nbsp;– 4 April 1617); also signed as Neper, Nepair; nicknamed '''Marvellous Merchiston''') was a Scottish landowner known as a [[mathematics|mathematician]], [[physicist]], and [[astronomer]]. He was the 8th [[Laird]] of [[Merchiston]]. His [[Latinisation of names|Latinized name]] was '''Ioannes Neper'''.

John Napier is best known as the discoverer of [[logarithm]]s.  He also invented the so-called&lt;!-- nothing to do with slide rule --&gt; "[[Napier's bones]]" and made common the use of the [[decimal point]] in arithmetic and mathematics.

Napier's birthplace, [[Merchiston Castle|Merchiston Tower]] in [[Edinburgh]], is now part of the facilities of [[Edinburgh Napier University]]. Napier died from the effects of [[gout]] at home at [[Merchiston Castle]] and his remains were buried in the [[kirkyard]] of [[High Kirk of St Giles|St Giles]]. Following the loss of the kirkyard there to build [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]], he was memorialised at [[St Cuthbert's Parish Church|St Cuthbert's]] at the west side of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland: The Grampian Society, 1871&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Merchiston Tower, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Merchiston Castle]]
Napier's father was [[Sir Archibald Napier]] of Merchiston Castle, and his mother was Janet Bothwell, daughter of the politician and judge [[Francis Bothwell, Lord of Session]], and a sister of [[Adam Bothwell]] who became the [[Bishop of Orkney]]. Archibald Napier was 16 years old when John Napier was born.
[[File:Merchiston castle.jpg|thumb|Merchiston Castle from an 1834 woodcut]]
As was the common practice for members of the nobility at that time, he was privately tutored and did not have formal education until he was 13, when he was sent to [[St Salvator's College, St Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;Monuments and monumental inscriptions of Scotland: The Grampian Society, 1871&lt;/ref&gt; 

He did not stay in college very long. It is believed that he dropped out of school in Scotland and perhaps travelled in mainland Europe to better continue his studies. Little is known about those years, where, when, or with whom he might have studied, although his uncle Adam Bothwell wrote a letter to John's father on 5 December 1560, saying "I pray you, sir, to send John to the schools either to [[France]] or [[Flanders]], for he can learn no good at home", and it is believed that this advice was followed.

In 1571, Napier, aged 21, returned to Scotland, and bought a castle at [[Gartness, Stirling|Gartness]] in 1574. On the death of his father in 1608, Napier and his family moved into [[Merchiston Castle]] in Edinburgh, where he resided the remainder of his life. He died at the age of 67.

Many mathematicians at the time were acutely aware of the issues of computation and were dedicated to relieving practitioners of the calculation burden. In particular, the Scottish mathematician John Napier was famous for his devices to assist with computation. He invented a well-known mathematical artifact, the ingenious numbering rods more quaintly known as “Napier's bones,” that offered mechanical means for facilitating computation. (For additional information on “Napier's bones,” see the article, “John Napier: His Life, His Logs, and His Bones” (2006).) 

In addition, Napier recognized the potential of the recent developments in mathematics, particularly those of [[prosthaphaeresis]], decimal fractions, and symbolic index arithmetic, to tackle the issue of reducing computation. He appreciated that, for the most part, practitioners who had laborious computations generally did them in the context of trigonometry. Therefore, as well as developing the logarithmic relation, Napier set it in a trigonometric context so it would be even more relevant.

==Advances in mathematics==
{{further|Napier's bones}}

[[File:Napier's calculating tables.JPG|thumb|upright|A set of Napier's calculating tables from around 1680]]
His work, ''Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio'' (1614) contained fifty-seven pages of explanatory matter and ninety pages of tables of numbers related to [[natural logarithm]]s (see [[Napierian logarithm]]). The book also has an excellent discussion of theorems in [[spherical trigonometry]], usually known as Napier's Rules of Circular Parts.

Modern English translations of both Napier's books on logarithms and their description can be found on the web, as well as a discussion of Napier's Bones (see below) and Promptuary (another early calculating device).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.17centurymaths.com |title=17th Century Maths.com |publisher=17centurymaths.com |date=25 March 2011 |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His invention of logarithms was quickly taken up at [[Gresham College]], and prominent English mathematician [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] visited Napier in 1615. Among the matters they discussed were a re-scaling of Napier's logarithms, in which the presence of the [[e (mathematical constant)|mathematical constant now known as ''e'']] (more accurately, ''e'' times a large power of 10 rounded to an integer) was a practical difficulty. Neither Napier nor Briggs actually discovered the constant ''e''; that discovery was made decades later by [[Jacob Bernoulli]].

Napier delegated to Briggs the computation of a revised table. The computational advance available via logarithms, the converse of powered numbers or [[exponential notation]], was such that it made calculations by hand much quicker.&lt;ref name = DNB&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Napier, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way was opened to later scientific advances, in [[astronomy]], [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], and other areas of [[physics]].

Napier made further contributions. He improved [[Simon Stevin]]'s decimal notation. [[Lattice multiplication]], used by [[Fibonacci]], was made more convenient by his introduction of [[Napier's bones]], a multiplication tool using a set of numbered rods.

Napier may have worked largely in isolation, but he had contact with [[Tycho Brahe]] who corresponded with his friend [[John Craig (physician)|John Craig]]. Craig certainly announced the discovery of logarithms to Brahe in the 1590s (the name itself came later); there is a story from [[Anthony à Wood]], perhaps not well substantiated, that Napier had a hint from Craig that [[Longomontanus]], a follower of Brahe, was working in a similar direction. 

It has been shown that Craig had notes on a method of [[Paul Wittich]] that used [[trigonometric identities]] to reduce a multiplication formula for the [[sine function]] to additions.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=19758|title=Napier, John|first=George|last=Molland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
[[File:Logarithms book Napier.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of ''Mirifici logarithmorum canonis descriptio'' (1614)]]
Napier had an interest in the ''[[Book of Revelation]]'', from his student days at [[St Salvator's College, St Andrews]]. Under the influence of the sermons of [[Christopher Goodman]], he developed a strongly anti-papal reading.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; He further used the ''Book of Revelation'' for [[chronography]], to predict the [[Apocalypse]], in ''A Plaine Discovery of the Whole Revelation of St. John'' (1593), which he regarded as his most important work; he also applied the [[Sibylline Oracles]], to calculate the date of the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Crawford Gribben|author2=David George Mullan|title=Literature and the Scottish Reformation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RMZD6zBkzbcC&amp;pg=PA15|accessdate=24 May 2012|date=2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6715-5|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napier believed that would occur in 1688 or 1700. He dated [[the seventh trumpet]] to 1541.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Allan I. MacInnes|author2=Arthur H. Williamson|title=Shaping the Stuart World, 1603-1714: The Atlantic Connection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgdYwvIayvMC&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=23 May 2012|date=2006|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-14711-9|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his dedication of the ''Plaine Discovery'' to [[James VI]], dated 29 Jan 1594,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brittanica.com/EBchecked/topic/462743/Plaine-Discovery-of-the-Whole-Revelation-of-Saint-John] Encyclopædia Britannica online entry for ''Plaine Discovery''&lt;/ref&gt; Napier urged the king to see "that justice be done against the enemies of God's church," and counselled the King "to reform the universal enormities of his country, and first to begin at his own house, family, and court." The volume includes nine pages of Napier's English verse. It met with success at home and abroad. In 1600 [[Michiel Panneel]] produced a Dutch translation, and this reached a second edition in 1607. In 1602 the work appeared at [[La Rochelle]] in a French version, by [[Georges Thomson]], revised by Napier, and that also went through several editions (1603, 1605, and 1607). A new edition of the English original was called for in 1611, when it was revised and corrected by the author, and enlarged by the addition of ''With a resolution of certain doubts, moved by some well affected brethren.'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.ugent.be/en/catalog/rug01:001591742 ''A plaine discovery ...''], Universiteitsbibliotheek Gent&lt;/ref&gt; this appeared simultaneously at Edinburgh and London. The author stated that he still intended to publish a Latin edition, but it never appeared. A German translation, by [[Leo de Dromna]], of the first part of Napier's work appeared at Gera in 1611, and of the whole by [[Wolfgang Meyer]] at [[Frankfurt-am-Main]], in 1615.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt; Among Napier's followers was Matthew Cotterius ([[Matthieu Cottière]]).&lt;ref&gt;Arthur H. Williamson, ''Scottish National Consciousness in the Age of James VI'' (1979), p.&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The occult==
[[Image:St Cuthbert Napier.jpg|upright|thumb|Memorial to John Napier in [[The Parish Church of St Cuthbert|St Cuthbert's Church]]]]
In addition to his mathematical and religious interests, Napier was often perceived as a magician, and is thought to have dabbled in [[alchemy]] and [[necromancy]]. It was said that he would travel about with a black spider in a small box, and that his black [[rooster]] was his [[familiar spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnston |first=Ian |url=http://news.scotsman.com/scitech.cfm?id=523542005 |title=Scots genius who paved way for Newton's discoveries|publisher=[[The Scotsman]]|date= 14 May 2005|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Springer |first=Will |url=http://heritage.scotsman.com/myths.cfm?id=41962005 |title=Napier's wizard roots&amp;nbsp;– article about Napier's interest in the occult |publisher=Scotsman |date= 14 February 2005|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nms.ac.uk/explore-our-collections/stories/science-and-technology/napiers-bones/|title=Napier's bones|publisher=National Museums Scotland|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contract still exists for a [[treasure hunt]], made between Napier and [[Robert Logan of Restalrig]]. Napier was to search [[Fast Castle]] for treasure allegedly hidden there, wherein it is stated that Napier should "do his utmost diligence to search and seek out, and by all craft and ingine to find out the same, or make it sure that no such thing has been there."&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

==Influence==
Among Napier's early followers were the instrument makers [[Edmund Gunter]] and John Speidell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The London encyclopaedia: or Universal dictionary of science, art, literature, and practical mechanics, comprising a popular view of the present state of knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u1IPAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA498|accessdate=23 May 2012|date=1829|page=498}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Florian Cajori|title=A History of Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mGJRjIC9fZgC&amp;pg=PA152|accessdate=23 May 2012|date=1991|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=978-0-8218-2102-2|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]]|title=Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f5FqsDPVQ2MC&amp;pg=PA1129|accessdate=23 May 2012|date=1 August 2003|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-7397-3|page=1129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of logarithms is given credit as the largest single factor in the general adoption of [[decimal arithmetic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Eugene Smith|title=History of Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTytJGnTf1kC&amp;pg=PA244|accessdate=23 May 2012|date=1 June 1958|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-20430-7|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Trissotetras'' (1645) of [[Thomas Urquhart]] builds on Napier's work, in [[trigonometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Garrett A.

==Eponyms==
An alternative unit to the [[decibel]] used in [[electrical engineering]], the [[neper]], is named after Napier, as is [[Edinburgh Napier University]] in Edinburgh, Scotland.

The crater [[Neper (crater)|Neper]] on the Moon is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/jsp/FeatureNameDetail.jsp?feature=64377 Neper] Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature&amp;nbsp;– USGS Astrogeology&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
In 1572, Napier married 16-year-old Elizabeth, daughter of James Stirling, the 4th [[Laird]] of [[Keir House|Keir]] and of [[Cadder]]. They had two children. Elizabeth died in 1579, and Napier then married Agnes Chisholm, with whom he had ten more children. His father-in-law James Chisholm of Cromlix was later mixed up in the [[Spanish blanks plot]], over which Napier with others petitioned the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeff Suzuki|title=Mathematics in Historical Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lew5IC5piCwC&amp;pg=PA218|accessdate=23 May 2012|date=27 August 2009|publisher=MAA|isbn=978-0-88385-570-6|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kenneth Albert Arnold''' (March 29, 1915&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.project1947.com/fig/arnbiog.htm Project 1947], "Some life data on Kenneth Arnold"&lt;/ref&gt; – January 16, 1984&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/44176523 Find a grave], Cremated, and ashes given to his wife&lt;/ref&gt;) was an American aviator and businessman. He is best known for making what is generally considered the first widely reported modern [[unidentified flying object]] sighting in the United States, after claiming to have seen [[Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting|nine unusual objects]] flying in tandem near [[Mount Rainier]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] on June 24, 1947.

==Early life==
Arnold was born in [[Sebeka, Minnesota]], but grew up in [[Scobey, Montana]]. He attended the [[University of Minnesota]],&lt;ref name="kab"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arnold|first1=Kenneth|title=PROJECT 1947 |url= http://www.project1947.com/fig/arnbiog.htm|website=Kenneth Arnold's Biography |publisher=project1947.com |accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was coached in [[American football|football]] by [[Bernie Bierman]]. He was an avid [[swimmer]] and [[diving (sport)|diver]] being good enough at the latter to try out for the [[Diving at the Summer Olympics|U.S. Diving team]].

==Career==
Arnold began Great Western Fire Control Supply in [[Boise, Idaho]] in 1940, a company that sold and installed [[fire suppression systems]], a job that took him around the [[Pacific Northwest]].

Arnold was regarded as a skilled and experienced pilot, with over 9,000 total flying hours, almost half of which were devoted to [[Search and Rescue]] Mercy Flyer efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Palmer Hoyt, "UFOCRITIQUE: UFO's, Social Intelligence and the Condon Committee"; Master's Thesis, [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute]], 2000; [http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-05082000-09580026/unrestricted/UFOCRITIQUE.pdf read it online]&lt;/ref&gt;

He ran unsuccessfully for [[Lieutenant Governor of Idaho]] in 1962.

==UFO sighting==
{{Main|Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting}}
On June 24, 1947, while flying near Mt. Rainier in Washington State, Arnold claimed to have seen [[Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting|nine unusual objects flying in the skies]]. Arnold also claimed to have seen UFOs on several subsequent occasions.

Arnold originally described the objects' shape as "flat like a pie pan", "shaped like a pie plate", "half-moon shaped, oval in front and convex in the rear", "something like a pie plate that was cut in half with a sort of a convex triangle in the rear", or simply "saucer-like" or "like a big flat disk" ([[Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting#Publicity and origins of term "flying saucer"|see quotes]]), and also described their erratic motion being "like a fish flipping in the sun" or a saucer skipped across water. From these, the press quickly coined the new terms "[[flying saucer]]" and "flying disc" to describe such objects, many of which were reported within days after Arnold's sighting.  Later Arnold would add that one of the objects actually resembled a [[crescent]] or [[flying wing]].

The [[U.S. Air Force]] formally listed the Arnold case as a [[mirage]]; this is one of many explanations that have been disputed by critics, and researchers [[Jerome Clark]], author of ''The UFO Book'' (1998)&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome Clark]], ''The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial''. Visible Ink, 1998. {{ISBN|1-57859-029-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ronald Story, editor of ''The Encyclopedia of UFOs'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;Story, Ronald, editor, ''The Encyclopedia of UFOs'', Garden City: Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc, 1980, {{ISBN|0-385-13677-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both argue that there has never been an entirely persuasive conventional explanation of the Arnold sighting.

After his UFO sighting, Arnold became a minor celebrity, and for about a decade thereafter, he was somewhat involved in interviewing other UFO witnesses or contactees. Notably, he investigated the claims of [[Samuel Eaton Thompson]], one of the first [[contactee]]s. Arnold wrote a book and several magazine articles about his UFO sighting and his subsequent research.

By the 1960s, Arnold had tired of his noteriety and UFOs in general, and he eventually declined all interviews. On June 24, 1977, however, he attended the First International UFO Congress in Chicago, curated by ''[[Fate (magazine)|Fate]]'' to mark the 30th anniversary of the "birth" of the modern UFO age. Some of his comments at the event reflected his displeasure at the general ignorance concerning the matter:

{{cquote|… well, right here we’ve seen something, I’ve seen something, hundreds of pilots have seen something … in the skies. We have dutifully reported these things. And we have to have 15 million witnesses before anybody is going to look into the problem … seriously? Well this is utterly fantastic. This is more fantastic than flying saucers or [[Venusians|people from Venus]] or anything as far as I am concerned.}}

==Personal life==
Arnold and his wife Doris had four daughters, Kiska, Karla, Kim (Purvis) and April Katri. He died, aged 68, from colon cancer at [[Overlake Hospital Medical Center|Overlake Hospital]] in [[Bellevue, Washington]] per his bio.&lt;!--or a hospital in [[Boise, Idaho]]??--&gt; Arnold did not practice any organized religion, and he was in the habit of handing out a "philosophy card" which seemed to exalt the virtues of the "unbeliever".&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Collins |first1=Curt |title=UFOs, Kenneth Arnold and the American Bible |url= http://web.archive.org/web/20120120040746/http://www.kennetharnoldufo.com/kenneth-arnold.html |website=blueblurrylines.com |date = 15 March 2017 |accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter Kim would however explain later that this merely implied his belief in questioning dogma and his support for independent decision making. In her view his belief in a divine creator caused him to defend the authenticity of his sighting of June 24, 1947, until his death.&lt;ref name="kim"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Arnold |first1=Kim |title=Statements by Kim Arnold |url= http://web.archive.org/web/20120120040746/http://www.kennetharnoldufo.com/kenneth-arnold.html |website= Saucers Incorporated, 2011 |publisher=kennetharnoldufo.com | accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Kenneth Arnold famous CallAir A-2 Airplane==
The actual [[CallAir Model A|CallAir A-2]] airplane which Kenneth Arnold was piloting when he made his famous UFO sighting back in 1947 still exists. It is currently at the [[North Cascade Vintage Aircraft Museum]] in [[Concrete, Washington]] and is still in excellent flying condition.

'''Kurt Hummel'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deconstructingglee.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/kurtelizabethhummel.jpg|title=Ryan Murphy Q&amp;A|accessdate=November 5, 2012|date=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[fictional character]] and one of the male leads in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] musical comedy-drama series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''. Series creators [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]], [[Brad Falchuk]] and [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] initially conceived of him as a fashionable [[homosexual|gay]] [[countertenor]] who is routinely [[bullying|bullied]] at school. Kurt is portrayed by actor [[Chris Colfer]], and has appeared as a character on the show since its [[Pilot (Glee)|pilot episode]], first broadcast on May 19, 2009. ''Glee'' follows the trials of the New Directions [[glee club]] at the fictional William McKinley High School in the town of [[Lima, Ohio]], of which Kurt is a member. His storylines in the [[Glee (season 1)|first season]] focus on his struggle with his sexual identity as he discloses his homosexuality to his father and friends, and deals with his romantic feelings for [[Finn Hudson]], the heterosexual co-captain of the glee club.

In the show's [[Glee (season 2)|second season]], Kurt is forced to transfer to a private school for his own safety after a [[closeted]] classmate bullies him relentlessly and then threatens to kill him. Kurt joins the Dalton Academy Warblers, the school's glee club, which is a competition rival of New Directions, and is befriended by their openly gay lead singer [[Blaine Anderson]]. Later on, the two become romantically involved. Their relationship has been well received by critics, and they have been named "one of the most beloved TV couples of the millennium" by Jarett Wieselman of the ''[[New York Post]]''.&lt;ref name="NYP"/&gt; Kurt eventually transfers back to McKinley and rejoins New Directions, but continues his relationship with Blaine, who transfers to McKinley in the [[Glee (season 3)|third season]]. In the [[Glee (season 4)|fourth season]], Kurt moves to New York City with his best friend and rival [[Rachel Berry]], where he pursues his musical education while interning for [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue.com]]. For the remainder of the series, ''Glee'' charts Kurt's life in Lima and New York as he grapples with young adulthood and realising his career ambitions.

Colfer describes Kurt as projecting a very confident "I'm better than you" personality, despite being a typically scared and anxious teenager.&lt;ref name="starry"/&gt; Kurt's solos for New Directions tend to be songs—usually [[show tunes]]—traditionally performed by women, which best suit his countertenor voice. His occasionally complex—but always loving—relationship with his father has been a focus for the show. Colfer's portrayal of Kurt has received much critical praise, and he has been the recipient of several awards, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor&amp;nbsp;– Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film]] at the 2011 [[Golden Globe Awards]]. He has also garnered many award nominations, which include the 2010 and 2011 [[Emmy Award]]s for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]]. In April 2011, Colfer was named one of the 2011 [[Time 100]], [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]'s list of the 100 most influential people.

Prior to being cast in ''Glee'', Colfer had no professional acting experience.&lt;ref name="rewrite"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-gleestage26-2009apr26,0,1653470.story | title=Video: 'Glee' team rewrites the school musical | first=Denise |last=Martin | work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]] | date=April 26, 2009 | accessdate=May 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He originally auditioned for the role of [[Artie Abrams]], performing "[[Chicago (musical)#Musical numbers|Mr. Cellophane]]" from the musical ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''. Murphy was so impressed by his performance that the role of Kurt was created for him.&lt;ref name="bs" /&gt; To keep the number of students in the glee club constant, a character named Rajish was cut from the show.&lt;ref name="huluvid"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/77856/glee-up-close-with-chris-colfer| title=Glee: Up Close with Chris Colfer |work=[[Hulu]].com|publisher=[[Fox Entertainment Group|Fox]]| accessdate=March 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt's name is inspired by the character Kurt von Trapp from ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', a role that Colfer once played as a child.&lt;ref name="rewrite"/&gt; The Hummel surname comes from the popular German [[Hummel figurines]]; Colfer explained in an interview that Murphy thought he had their rosy-cheeked complexion.&lt;ref name="huluvid2"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/154679/late-night-with-jimmy-fallon-chris-colfer-part-1| title=Late Night with Jimmy Fallon: Chris Colfer, Part 1 |work=[[Hulu]].com|publisher=[[NBC]]|accessdate=March 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy praised Colfer's abilities despite his lack of formal training, saying, "I just thought he was so talented and gifted and unusual.

Colfer added, "For him to see me in him, I can't even describe it."&lt;ref name="LAtimesblog"/&gt;

After being cast, Colfer said that he was happy "to be a part of something that is so new and different and so needed at this time", and added, "It's good to have something positive, especially for kids in small towns, like myself, who need a little pick-me-up."&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-glee26-2009apr26,0,7366573.story | title= Will TV audiences watch with 'Glee'? | last=Fernandez|first=Maria Elena | work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]| date=April 26, 2009 | accessdate= June 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt has twice been portrayed as a child: in the episode "[[Grilled Cheesus]]", a series of flashback scenes show Kurt at the age of eight, in which the character is played by Adam Kolkin.&lt;ref name="zap2it"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/10/glees-young-kurt-meet-adam-kolkin-chris-colfers-mini-me.html | title={{-'}}Glee's Young Kurt: Meet Adam Kolkin, Chris Colfer's mini-me | first=Carina | last=MacKenzie | work=[[Zap2it]] | publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]] | date=October 5, 2010 | accessdate=February 27, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314095411/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/10/glees-young-kurt-meet-adam-kolkin-chris-colfers-mini-me.html | archivedate=March 14, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kolkin was thirteen at the time of the audition, which called for an eight-year-old, he was chosen in part because his resemblance to Colfer was "so uncanny even the casting directors were taken aback".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/news/kolkin-268628-glee-kurt.html|title=O.C. teen to play younger Kurt on 'Glee{{'-}}|last=Fletcher|first=Jaimee Lynn|work=[[The Orange County Register]]|publisher=[[Freedom Communications]]|date=September 29, 2010|accessdate=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt has also been shown even younger—in the episode "[[The Substitute (Glee)|The Substitute]]", club director [[Will Schuester]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]) comes down with the flu and has a hallucination of the students as preschoolers; all twelve glee club members, including Kurt, are played by very young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20302134_20442631_20877628,00.html|title=Mini-'Glee'! 12 Cast Faves...as Kids!|date=November 16, 2010|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|accessdate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also revealed that some of the original cast would leave as early as 2012: "I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives."&lt;ref name="replaced"/&gt; Murphy stated in July 2011 that Colfer would be one of the actors leaving at the end of the third season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/glee-lea-michele-chris-colfer-210869|title={{-'}}Glee' Exclusive: Lea Michele, Chris Colfer, Cory Monteith Not Returning for Season 4|first=Lesley|last=Goldberg|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=July 12, 2011|date=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Colfer commented on the report, saying, "We had kind of known since the beginning, since we started the show, that these characters were going to grow up and they were going to graduate eventually.

==Storylines==

===Season 1===
In the show's [[Pilot (Glee)|pilot episode]], Kurt auditions for the New Directions glee club by performing "Mr. Cellophane" from ''Chicago''.

His heightened confidence leads him to disclose his homosexuality to his father, who not only responds with love and acceptance, but also surprises Kurt by telling him that he has long been aware that Kurt was gay.&lt;ref name="Preggers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kurt-bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox.com/glee/bios/chris-colfer/ |title=Chris Colfer as Kurt Hummel |work=Fox.com |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]] |accessdate=January 31, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/656DXoF92?url=http://www.fox.com/glee/bios/chris-colfer/ |archivedate=January 31, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt quits the football team in "[[Mash-Up (Glee)|Mash-Up]]", when Coach [[Characters of Glee#Ken Tanaka|Ken Tanaka]] ([[Patrick Gallagher (actor)|Patrick Gallagher]]) forces the glee club members of the team to choose between the club and the team.&lt;ref name="Mash-Up"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Mash-Up |episodelink=Mash-Up (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits= [[Elodie Keene]] (director), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=October 21, 2009 |season=1 |number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurt competes against the glee club's star singer [[Rachel Berry]] (Lea Michele) for a solo on "[[Defying Gravity (song)|Defying Gravity]]" from the musical ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]''.

During the ensuing argument, when Kurt refuses to acknowledge his infatuation, Finn loses his temper and calls the new furnishings "faggy".

After Burt points out that Kurt may be taking advantage of Sam, Kurt terminates the partnership, and performs a "duet" with himself, singing "Le Jazz Hot!" from ''[[Victor Victoria]]''. With unusual empathy, Rachel notices how lonely and unhappy Kurt seems, and realizes how hard it is for him to be the only publicly gay student at school.

When Blaine goes to Dalton to invite the Warblers to see him in ''West Side Story'', he is pursued by a new warbler Sebastian Smythe ([[Grant Gustin]]). Sebastian convinces Kurt and Blaine to go with him to a local gay bar—he supplies the fake IDs—and spends half the night dancing with Blaine. When they leave, a drunk and aroused Blaine urges Kurt to have sex with him in the back seat of the car. Kurt refuses, and Blaine walks home. He later tells Kurt that he was just nervous about the possibility of their first time, and that he cares nothing for Sebastian. They kiss onstage in the empty auditorium, and Kurt proposes that they go over to Blaine's house for the night, where they have sex together for the first time.&lt;ref name="First Time"&gt;{{cite episode |title=The First Time|episodelink=The First Time (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=Bradley Buecker (director), [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=November 8, 2011 |season=3 |number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode "[[Michael (Glee)|Michael]]", New Directions and the Warblers compete for the right to perform Michael Jackson's music at Regionals by singing his song "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]". Sebastian, who has been unsuccessful in his attempts to steal Blaine from Kurt, throws a slushie laced with rock salt at Kurt, but Blaine jumps in front of Kurt and is badly injured by it; the cornea in his right eye is deeply scratched and requires surgery.&lt;ref name="Michael"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Michael|episodelink=Michael (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Alfonso Gomez-Rejon]] (director), [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=January 31, 2012 |season=3 |number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither group ultimately uses Jackson's music at Regionals, and New Directions wins the competition. Later, Kurt succeeds in becoming a finalist for NYADA, as does Rachel.&lt;ref name="On My Way"&gt;{{cite episode |title=On My Way|episodelink=On My Way (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=Bradley Buecker (director), [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=February 21, 2012 |season=3 |number=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Dance with Somebody (Glee)|Dance with Somebody]]", Kurt feels that Blaine has been distant, and confides in a boy named Chandler he meets at the local music store. The two hit it off instantly with their common interest of moving to New York after high school. Kurt begins texting Chandler quite often soon after that. Rachel thinks he's being in the wrong that Kurt is cheating on Blaine instead of talking to Blaine about the rut they are in. Blaine finds out about Chandler and is extremely hurt. Both Kurt and Blaine sing Whitney songs to express how they feel about their situation with Blaine singing [[It's Not Right but It's Okay]] and Kurt singing [[I Have Nothing]] as an apology. Eventually after having a talk in Emma's office, the two make up and are stronger than ever.&lt;ref name="Dance with Somebody"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Dance with Somebody|episodelink=Dance with Somebody (Glee)|series=Glee|serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=Paris Barclay (director), [[Ross Maxwell]](writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=April 24, 2012 |season=3|number=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Goodbye (Glee)|Goodbye]]", Blaine is worried that he and Kurt will not make it as a couple after Kurt graduates and moves off to New York. Kurt reassures him that they will be okay as a couple. After graduation, Kurt, Rachel and Finn's letters from the New York schools they applied to come in. Kurt does not get accepted to NYADA.&lt;ref name="Goodbye"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Goodbye|episodelink=Goodbye (Glee)|series=Glee|serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=Brad Falchuk (director), [[Brad Falchuk]](writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=May 22, 2012 |season=3|number=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 4===
In Season 4, Kurt joins Rachel in New York after she reveals that she is unhappy with her roommate and life at that point. After the encouragement of Blaine and his father, he decides to sell his car and fly to New York, where he finds a loft in Bushwick for him and Rachel to move into. Kurt applies for a job at Vogue.com and his editor, Isabelle Wright, who is also from Ohio, hires him partially based upon his portfolio of outfits and is impressed with his intuition and style. Early on, she leans on his support, and then quickly returns his support when he decides to give Rachel a makeover in the Vogue closet. Instead of being angry, she loves his idea to do a musical makeover for the website and joins in the makeover. Kurt becomes increasingly busy with his job at Vogue, and Blaine cheats on him in Lima. He comes to New York to tell Kurt what happened, and they break up.

Kurt continues working at Vogue throughout the season, and Isabelle encourages him to try to forgive Blaine, and at Thanksgiving, she brings her friends over to their loft and throws him a "kiki." When Kurt reauditions for NYADA, he is initially rejected, because Carmen Tibideaux sees his technical skill and tells him that he can sell a number, but doesn't believe that he is emotional enough to be an artist. Later, when Kurt is at the Winter Showcase to support Rachel, she sees him moved by Rachel's piece, and announces that he will be auditioning after the intermission. Though he initially panics, Rachel convinces him that he doesn't need his bells and whistles to perform, and he chooses to sing "Being Alive" from Company, which impresses the NYADA audience, and he later gets a letter telling him that he has gotten in.

At Christmas, Kurt elects not to go back home, and so his father comes up to New York to set up his Christmas tree and spend some time with him. At this point, he tells Kurt that he has prostate cancer. He also has brought Blaine with him, who tries to win back Kurt's trust, but the trip is uneasy. When Kurt begins at NYADA, he struggles initially to find his place, and meets a student named Adam Crawford, a senior who wants to recruit him for his own show choir, Adam's Apples, and also seems interested in Kurt himself; Kurt eventually asks him out for coffee. While at Will and Emma's wedding, Kurt and Blaine hook up, leaving their relationship in a question, since Kurt is dating Adam, but not exclusive. When Kurt returns to New York, there is a snowstorm, leaving Kurt, Rachel, Santana, and Adam stuck together in the loft watching movies together. Santana strongly hints about Kurt's hook up with Blaine, and after they are back at school, Adam asks Kurt about his feelings for Blaine. Kurt says that he is desperately trying to get over Blaine, and Adam invites him to find their own romantic movie.

When Santana moves in with him and Rachel, Kurt tries to keep Santana from telling Rachel about Brody prostituting himself. But Santana tells Rachel anyway, much to Kurt's dismay. Later, Kurt and Rachel confront Santana for working at a club dancing and try to encourage her to take a dance class from the extension school of NYADA to keep her skills honed. Still working at Vogue, Kurt is put in charge of a ballet gala, and invites Rachel and Santana to help. He and Rachel reveal that they both had experiences with ballet as children, and Kurt started ballet at the age of three years when his mother decided to take him. He bribes Santana to go with a designer dress, and once they are at the gala, she admits she was in ballet as a child too and loved it. When Kurt returns to Lima, it is to be there for his father's doctor's visit, and his anxiety is apparent throughout his interactions with his friends. However, in the doctor's office, Kurt, Burt, and Carole learn that Burt's cancer has gone into remission, and Kurt takes his father to the Glee club to sing "Sunshine of My Life" to him, which Kurt says Burt used to sing to him when he was little.

===Season 5===
In the season premiere, "[[Love, Love, Love (Glee)|Love, Love, Love]]", Kurt, who is still in Lima, agrees to get back together with Blaine. Emboldened, Blaine decides to ask Kurt to marry him, which he does in an extravagant proposal at Dalton Academy, in the spot where the two met. Kurt accepts.&lt;ref name="Love, Love, Love"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Love, Love, Love|episodelink=Love, Love, Love (Glee)|series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=Bradley Buecker (director), [[Brad Falchuk]] (writer)|network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=September 26, 2013 |season=5 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is back in New York in "[[Tina in the Sky with Diamonds]]", and gets a job at the diner where Rachel and Santana are working. He then returns to Lima in "[[The Quarterback (Glee)|The Quarterback]]" for his stepbrother Finn's funeral and subsequent memorial, and he grieves with his parents and friends.&lt;ref name="The Quarterback"&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Quarterback |episodelink=The Quarterback (Glee) |series=Glee |serieslink=Glee (TV series) |credits=[[Brad Falchuk]] (director, writer), [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (writer), [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=October 10, 2013 |season=5 |number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurt was still living in New York, but he was visiting his father in Lima

===Season 6===
During the season, Kurt and Blaine have broken up but eventually reunite in time for Brittany and Santana's wedding. At the two's insistence, Kurt and Blaine get married alongside them. In 2020, they are still married and are a celebrity couple. Rachel is pregnant with their child who is assumed to be a girl.

==Characterization==
[[File:Ryan Murphy by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The scene where Kurt comes out is taken verbatim from the life of ''Glee'' creator [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] (''pictured'').]]
According to Colfer, ''Glee''{{'}}s creators initially "were leaning on [Kurt] being overly flamboyant". However, the actor stated that he did not want to take that approach "because it's so overdone". Instead, he decided to portray the character as "more internal and superior."&lt;ref name="LAtimesblog"/&gt; Colfer has explained that Kurt "puts on a very confident, 'I'm better than you' persona," but that "underneath it all he's the same anxious and scared teen everyone is/was at some point." Colfer also commented, "In later episodes, [Kurt] goes through an identity crisis, accepting and finding acceptance for who he is. He's a tough guy in designer clothes."&lt;ref name="starry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://starrymag.com/content.asp?ID=4321&amp;CATEGORY=INTERVIEWS |title=Chris Colfer&amp;nbsp;— Pure Glee |last=Steinberg|first=Jamie |work=Starry Constellation Magazine|date=May 2009|accessdate=June 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrasting Kurt to his own personality, Colfer stated that Kurt is "very flamboyant and superior and uppity and into fashion", while Colfer had never heard of fashion designer [[Marc Jacobs]] before Kurt referenced him in the pilot episode.&lt;ref name=Colfertvinterview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/chris-colfer,41850/ |title=Chris Colfer |last=VanDerWerff|first=Todd|date=June 7, 2010|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|publisher=[[Onion, Inc.|Onion, Inc]]|accessdate=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second-season episode "Grilled Cheesus" centered around Kurt's [[atheism]], with Murphy explaining that Kurt is "saying to the world, 'Prove [me] wrong: If God is kindness and love, make me believe in God.{{' "}}&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Glee-Grilled-Cheesus-1023969.aspx?rss=news&amp;partnerid=spi&amp;profileid=05|title=Are You There, God?

Kurt reveals himself to be gay early in the show's first season. The scene in which he tells his father was taken verbatim from Murphy's own life. Murphy felt that the scene was "a great thing to put on television", because, while gay characters are often isolated and attacked, audiences have rarely seen an openly gay character who "wins and triumphs".&lt;ref name="Colfer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/09/entertainment/et-colfer9|title={{-'}}Glee's' Chris Colfer fits right in|last=Fernandez|first=Maria Elena|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=September 9, 2009|accessdate=January 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further explained, "The show is about making you feel good in the end. It's about happy endings and optimism and the power of your personal journey and making you feel that the weird thing about me is the great thing about me. I've done other shows with gay characters, and I will say that in many of those cases, the gay characters didn't have a happy ending. And I thought you know what? Enough."&lt;ref name="Colfer"/&gt; Colfer has commented that his biggest challenge was in ensuring the scene felt "honest" and not comical or "used as a punchline". He explained, "I think it's probably the first time a character's sexuality has been respected and almost dignified in a way, and I think that's really important, and there needs to be more of that on TV."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2009/11/chris_colfer_on_playing_kurt_i.html|title=Glee's Chris Colfer on Owning 'Defying Gravity' and Resembling a Hummel Figurine|last=Milzoff|first=Rebecca|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|publisher=New York Media Holdings|date=November 16, 2009|accessdate=January 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurt’s acute sense of fashion is exhibited in his on-screen wardrobe. ''Glee''{{'}}s costume designer [[Lou Eyrich]] said in an interview with the ''[[Seattle Times]]'' that Kurt is one of her favorite characters to dress: "He never, ever repeats and you get to push yourself creatively. He's a perfect doll to dress because he'll try on anything."&lt;ref name="costume design"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/television/2011667814_glee25.html|title=Costume designer Lou Eyrich keeps 'Glee' fashions in step with the times|first=Sarah|last=Glassman|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|publisher=[[The Seattle Times Company]]|date=April 24, 2010|accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eyrich sets out to dress Kurt with tailored pieces that "exude his quietly flashy dapper dandyism",&lt;ref name="cdm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.costumedesignersguild.com/articles/2010-aug-spotlight-on-lou-eyrich/ |title=Spotlight On Lou Eyrich "Glee{{"-}} |first=Anna |last=Wyckoff |work=Costume Designers Guide.com |publisher=[[Costume Designers Guild]] |date=August 2, 2010 |accessdate=March 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216122454/http://www.costumedesignersguild.com/articles/2010-aug-spotlight-on-lou-eyrich/ |archivedate=February 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; mindful that as the son of a car mechanic, "he doesn't have a lot of money".&lt;ref name="fresnobee"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fresnobee.com/2010/08/27/2056263/glee-emmy-nomination-a-team-effort.html|title={{-'}}Glee' Emmy nomination a team effort |first=Rick|last=Bentley|work=Fresnobee.com|publisher=[[The Fresno Bee]]|date=August 30, 2010|accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nypost9"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/go_inside_kurt_closet_4BXS8iUipIQKRur8XLdsIO|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130130045337/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/go_inside_kurt_closet_4BXS8iUipIQKRur8XLdsIO|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 30, 2013|title=Go inside Kurt's closet|first=Jarett|last=Wieselman|work=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=September 15, 2010|accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===
Kurt has a close relationship with his father Burt, who openly accepts his son after Kurt tells him that he is gay in the show's fourth episode, "Preggers". As the series progresses their relationship continues to grow stronger. Colfer has credited his off-screen relationship with O'Malley with improving the quality of their scenes together.&lt;ref name="MastersCC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b178380__i_Glee__i__s_Chris_Colfer__There_s_More_Daddy_Drama_to_Come.html|title=Glee's Chris Colfer: There's More Daddy Drama to Come|last=Masters|first=Megan|work=[[E!

The first occurrence is initially alluded to in the episode "Acafellas", in which Kurt tells his friend Mercedes that he does have feelings for someone. Mercedes mistakenly assumes that Rachel, the glee club's lead singer, is the object of Kurt's affections, and although he later tells Mercedes that he is gay, he does not reveal to her that he is actually in love with the club's male lead, Finn.&lt;ref name="Acafellas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b127287_glees_coming-out_episode_respectful.html|title=Glee's Coming-Out Episode: "Respectful &amp; Touching{{"-}}|last=Borzillo-Vrenna|first=Callie|work=[[E!

The episode in which Burt defends his son against Finn's name-calling prompted a response from Eric Goldman of ''[[IGN]]'', who declared it "one of the heaviest scenes ''Glee'' has ever delved into".&lt;ref name="theatri review"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/109/1093143p1.html |title=Glee: "Theatricality" Review |last=Goldman|first=Eric |work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]] |date=May 26, 2010 |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2009/10/01/glee-season-1-episode-4-tv-recap/|title={{-"}}Glee" Season 1, Episode 4: TV Recap |last=Flandez|first=Raymund|date=October 1, 2009|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]]|accessdate=October 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before production on the second season began, Murphy confirmed that Kurt would be paired with a new romantic interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/01/18/exclusive-glee-spoilers-rachel-puck/|title=Exclusive: 'Glee' boss on Rachel/Puck relationship, Kurt's new BF, and Madonna!|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|authorlink=Michael Ausiello|last2=Malkin|first2=Mark|date=August 31, 2010|accessdate=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chord Overstreet, his character Sam Evans was originally intended to become Kurt's love interest. However, Sam's storyline was later adjusted to pair him with glee club member [[Quinn Fabray]] ([[Dianna Agron]]) after producers observed the chemistry between Overstreet and Agron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/10/audio-glees-chord-overstreet-says-sam-went-gay-straight|title=Audio: Glee's Chord Overstreet Says 'Sam' Went From Gay To Straight|work=[[RadarOnline]]|date=October 13, 2010|accessdate=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurt was subsequently paired with another new character, Blaine Anderson, a member of the rival show choir group the Dalton Academy Warblers, who is initially a mentor for Kurt. Murphy was unsure at first whether their relationship would become a romantic one, and stated that he wished to gauge public response to their friendship before planning future developments. He commented, "Part of me thinks he should be the boyfriend, part of me thinks he should just be the mentor. I didn't want to decide that until we got into sort of the middle of the season."&lt;ref name="AE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterelton.com/people/2010/11/glee-ryan-murphy-darren-criss-kurt-hummel |title=Exclusive!

In a July 2012 interview with ''[[E! News]]'', Colfer elaborated in regard to the progression of the Kurt-Blaine relationship in the show's fourth season. Colfer said, "I would like to do something besides say 'I love you,' and I think Darren [Criss] and I agree on that. We're ready for the next step. They've been together for a while. Let's throw some spice and drama into that."&lt;ref name="enews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/332350/glee-s-chris-colfer-wants-drama-for-kurt-blaine-hopes-to-sing-britney-spears-in-tribute-episode|title=Glee's Chris Colfer Wants "Drama" for Kurt &amp; Blaine, Hopes to Sing Britney Spears in Tribute Episode|last=Maldon|first=Mark|date=July 23, 2012|work=[[E!

To begin the show's fourth season, Kurt moves to New York while Blaine continues to go to high school in Ohio, though he and Blaine remain a couple. However, after Blaine cheats on him, Kurt breaks up with Blaine. The two later agree to remain friends, though Kurt is unwilling to resume their relationship. That winter, Kurt begins to see Adam Crawford, a senior at his new school, NYADA. Despite this, Kurt has sex with Blaine when in Ohio to attend a wedding, putting into question whether Kurt still wants to be with Blaine.

Despite all this, Kurt and Blaine do get back together in a romantic relationship in the first episode of the fifth season, "Love Love Love", which is incidentally the same episode that Blaine proposes marriage. Kurt says yes immediately.

Kurt heads back to New York while Blaine finishes high school back in Lima. Eventually, midway through the fifth season, Blaine graduates and moves in with Kurt. They have difficulties and agree that it would be best for them to continue with their engagement but as Blaine lives somewhere else for now as they both need their space. They will cohabitate in the season five finale.

At the beginning for the sixth season, it seems as though Kurt and Blaine have broken off the engagement due to difficulties living together and Blaine has moved back to Lima. Kurt later regrets this and decides to continue his schooling in Lima, to try to win Blaine back.

When Kurt returns, he finds that Blaine is in a relationship with Karofsky. Despite everything that goes on in the beginning of the sixth season, Kurt and Blaine get back together in the beginning of the episode, "A Wedding". Later in the same episode, Brittany and Sue Sylvester persuade the couple to get married at Brittany and Santana's wedding to make a double gay wedding.

I know I'm definitely not the best singer, but I think the message, the story behind the song about defying limits and borders placed by others, hopefully all that gets across with the performance.

In "Grilled Cheesus", when members of the glee club are singing songs about religion and spirituality, Kurt sings The Beatles' "[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]", dedicating the song to his father, who is in a coma in the hospital.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Kurt has received mainly positive reviews from television critics.

Critics were polarized by Kurt's storyline in the episode "Never Been Kissed". ''[[NPR]]''{{'s}} [[Linda Holmes (writer)|Linda Holmes]] found it "absurd" that a teenager as deeply in denial as Karofsky would transition from bullying to kissing Kurt so quickly and described it as "emotionally and behaviorally unsound".&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2010/11/10/131212955/why-glee-missed-the-mark-with-the-much-hyped-never-been-kissed?ft=1&amp;f=93568166|title=How 'Glee' Missed The Mark With The Much-Hyped 'Never Been Kissed{{'-}}|first=Linda|last=Holmes|work=Monkey See|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=November 11, 2010|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leah Anthony Libresco of the ''[[The Huffington Post|Huffington Post]]'' called the episode "extraordinarily counterproductive", and disapproved of Will treating Kurt's upset as the key problem, rather than the unchecked bullying provoking it. She found Blaine's advice to Kurt "misleading and dangerous", especially the suggestion that targeted children should be held responsible for confronting their attackers and putting themselves at risk of further injury, rather than for protecting themselves.&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leah-anthony-libresco/glees-gay-suicide-psa-it_b_781815.html|title=Glee's Gay Suicide PSA: It Got Worse|first=Leah Anthony|last=Libresco|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=November 10, 2010|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poniewozik noted that the storyline was inherently flawed, as the show had previously treated bullying in a light-hearted rather than serious manner, but said that its saving grace was the focus it placed on Colfer: "probably the strongest actor with the most interesting character among the ''Glee'' kids".&lt;ref name="JP"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tunedin.blogs.time.com/2010/11/10/glee-watch-bully-pulpit/|title=Glee Watch: Bully Pulpit|first=James|last=Poniewozik|authorlink=James Poniewozik|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|date=November 10, 2010|accessdate=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The love story involving Kurt and Blaine was met with critical acclaim, especially the events in the "Original Song" episode where the characters first kissed.

Critics were enthusiastic about Kurt and Blaine's decision to have sex for the first time in "The First Time" episode.

'''Ludo (Ludwig) Moritz Hartmann''' (1865–1924) was an [[Austrian people|Austrian]] historian, [[diplomat]] and [[Social Democrat]] politician.

He advocated an anti-metaphysical and materialist approach to history.&lt;ref name = Dvorak&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dvorak|first1=Johann|editor1-last=Uebel|editor1-first=Thomas|contribution=Otto Neurath and Adult Education: Unity of Science, Materialism and Comprehensive Enlightenment|date=1991|publisher=Kulwer Academic Publishers|title=Rediscovering the Forgotten Vienna Circle: Austrian Studies on Otto Neurath and the Vienna Circle|location=Dordrecht|pages=265-274}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Early life==
He was the son of the poet [[Moritz Hartmann]] and his wife Bertha, daughter of [[Achilles Roediger]], a [[Geneva]]n headmaster and bourgeois liberal educators. From 1872, when Ludwig was seven, his father suffered a long term illness and was often bed-ridden. One consequence of this was that he not only spent a lot of time with his father, but also met a variety of bankers, writers, scientists, doctors, artists and university professors who came to visit his father. These included the politician [[Ludwig Bamberger]], the surgeon [[Theodor Billroth]] , the philosopher of history, [[Theodor Gomperz]], the legal historian [[Adolf Exner]] and the historian [[Heinrich Friedjung]]. After his father's death, his mother prioritised his education with support from Bamberger. He subsequently attended [[Gymnasium Wasagasse]] and went on to study history, legal history and political economy at the Universities of [[University of Vienna|Vienna]] and [[University of Berlin|Berlin]]. His teachers included studied the subjects of history, legal history and political economy at the Universities of Vienna and Berlin. Among his teachers were [[Otto Hirschfeld]], [[Lujo Brentano]] and particularly [[Theodor Mommsen]].

==Popular education==
He was an advocate of [[popular education]], establishing a 'popular university course at the People's College.&lt;ref name = Dvorak/&gt; There is a biennial Ludo Hartmann prize awarded by the ''Verband Österreichischer Volkshochschulen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auszeichnungen/Preise|url=http://www.vhs.or.at/110/|website=Verband Österreichischer Volkshochschulen|publisher=Verband Österreichischer Volkshochschulen|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
During Shkreli's time at Cramer, Berkowitz and Company, he recommended [[short-selling]] the stock of [[Regeneron Pharmaceuticals]], a biotech company testing a weight-loss drug. When its price dropped in accordance with Shkreli's prediction, Cramer's hedge fund profited. Shkreli's prediction drew the attention of the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], which investigated Shkreli's knowledge about the stock but was unable to prove wrongdoing on his part.&lt;ref name="Barrett2014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barrett|first1=Paul|title=Retrophin's Martin Shkreli, the Biotech Short Seller Who Went Long|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-04-17/retrophins-martin-shkreli-the-biotech-short-seller-who-went-long|accessdate=December 17, 2015|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|issn=0007-7135|date=April 17, 2014|quote=Once a Notorious Short Seller, Martin&amp;nbsp;Shkreli Now Sees a Future in Biotech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MSMB Capital Management===
After four years as an associate at Cramer Berkowitz, Shkreli worked as a financial analyst for Intrepid Capital Management and [[UBS]] Wealth Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.thestreet.com/author/1101137/MartinShkreli/all.html |title= Martin Shkreli| website= TheStreet.com| access-date= December 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then started his first hedge fund, Elea Capital Management, in 2006.&lt;ref name="Pollack2015a"/&gt;&lt;ref name= nytindictment&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/business/dealbook/shkreli-indictment-portrays-small-time-fraud.html| title= Shkreli Indictment Portrays Small-Time Fraud|date=December 18, 2015|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[Lehman Brothers]] sued Elea in New York state court for failing to cover a '[[put option]] transaction' in which Shkreli bet the wrong way on a broad market decline. When stocks rose, Shkreli didn't have the funds to make the bank whole. In October 2007, Lehman Brothers won a $2.3 million default judgment against Shkreli and Elea, but [[Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers|Lehman collapsed]] before it could collect on the ruling.&lt;ref name=Barrett2014/&gt;

In September 2009, Shkreli started his own business. He launched MSMB Capital Management,&lt;ref name="Ortiz2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;La Roche, Julia; Jacobs, Peter (December 17, 2015).

On February 1, 2011, in a [[naked short selling|naked short sale]] on an account it held with [[Merrill Lynch]], MSMB Capital sold short 32 million shares of [[Orexigen Therapeutics]] stock at about $2.50 per share the day after its price plunged from $9.09, when the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) declined to approve the drug [[Bupropion/naltrexone|Contrave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/business/02drug.html|title=FDA Declines to Approve Diet Drug|date=February 1, 2011| first= Andrew| last= Pollack| quote=Shares of Orexigen plunged 72.5&amp;nbsp;percent on Tuesday, to&amp;nbsp;$2.50|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "FBI2015"&gt;{{cite press release|quote=In February 2011, MSMB Capital failed to settle a short position of more than 11&amp;nbsp;million shares of Orexigen&amp;nbsp;Therapeutics&amp;nbsp;... that Merrill&amp;nbsp;Lynch ultimately closed at a loss of over $7&amp;nbsp;million |url= https://www.fbi.gov/newyork/press-releases/2015/former-hedge-fund-manager-and-new-york-attorney-indicted-in-multi-million-dollar-fraud-scheme |date=December 17, 2015 |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |title=Former Hedge Fund Manager and New York Attorney Indicted in Multi‑Million‑Dollar Fraud Scheme |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231040349/http://www.fbi.gov/newyork/press-releases/2015/former-hedge-fund-manager-and-new-york-attorney-indicted-in-multi-million-dollar-fraud-scheme |archive-date=December 31, 2015 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stock price rebounded; MSMB could not cover the position, although it had told Merrill Lynch that it could.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-martin-shkreli-was-one-terrible-investor-20151217-column.html| title=Martin Shkreli was one terrible investor, SEC document shows|last1=Hiltzik|first1=Michael|date=December 17, 2015| work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merrill Lynch lost $7 million on the trade and MSMB Capital was virtually wiped out.

In 2011, Shkreli filed requests with the FDA to reject a new cancer diagnostic device from Navidea Biopharmaceuticals and an inhalable [[insulin]] therapy from [[MannKind Corporation]] while publicly short-selling both companies' stocks, the values of which dropped after Shkreli's interventions.

==== Views on Shkreli's leadership ====
Critics argued that Shkreli was intelligent but too immature and unfocused for the job of CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/12897910/1/shkrelis-inability-to-focus-immaturity-cost-him-retrophin-ceo-job.html|title=Shkreli's Inability to Focus, Immaturity Cost Him Retrophin CEO Job|last=Feuerstein|first=Adam|work=TheStreet|accessdate=December 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, at Shkreli's criminal trial, Aselage testified: "He's [Shkreli] a brilliant intellect, visionary."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crime-shkreli-idUSKBN19Y2UI|title=CEO of Martin Shkreli's old company likens him to 'Pied Piper'|date=July 13, 2017|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subsequent organized effort called on Turing to return pricing to pre-September levels and to address several matters relating to the needs of patients, an effort that garnered endorsements from more than 160 medical‑specialty and patient‑related organizations ({{as of|December 2015|lc=y}}, 164 organizations from thirty-one states, the [[District of Columbia]], and [[Puerto Rico]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Tirrell, Meg|date=October 22, 2015|title=Health Groups Appeal to Turing on Drug Price|medium=news video|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|publisher=[[CNBC]]|url=http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000437256|accessdate=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IDSAopenLttr&gt;{{cite web|date=November 3, 2015|title=An Open Appeal to Turing Pharmaceuticals|location=Arlington, Virginia|publisher=Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)|url=https://idsocietyorg.app.box.com/TuringOpenLetter|accessdate=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baum noted, "This is not the first time a sole supply generic drug{{spnd}}especially one that has been approved for use as long as Daraprim{{spnd}}has had its price increased suddenly and to a level that may make it unaffordable". He announced the availability of the compounded replacement for Daraprim as a part of a larger corporate program, "Imprimis Cares", to make "novel and customizable medicines available to physicians and patients at accessible prices".

On December 17, 2015, Shkreli was arrested by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] after a federal [[indictment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smythe|first1=Christie|last2=Geiger|first2=Keri|date=December 17, 2015|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-martin-shkreli-securities-fraud|title=Shkreli, CEO Reviled for Drug Price Gouging, Arrested on Securities Fraud Charges|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|issn=0007-7135}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York]] was filed, charging him with [[securities fraud]]. The charges were filed after an investigation into his tenure at MSMB Capital Management and Retrophin. He was accused of running a [[Ponzi scheme|Ponzi]]-like scheme.&lt;ref name="Matthews2015"/&gt;

Federal prosecutors said that Shkreli "engaged in multiple schemes to ensnare investors through a web of lies and deceit".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/former-hedge-fund-manager-and-new-york-attorney-indicted-multimillion-dollar-fraud Former Hedge Fund Manager and New York Attorney Indicted in Multimillion Dollar Fraud Scheme], [[U.S. Attorney's Office]], Eastern District of New York, [[United States Department of Justice]], December 17, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grim2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grim |first1=Ryan |last2=Young |first2=Jeffrey |orig-year=2015 |date=September 23, 2016 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/martin-shkreli-sec-investigation_us_5601a3c4e4b08820d91a6b6f |title=Drug‑Price Gouging Hedge Fund Guy May Be Even Worse Than You Thought, SEC Documents Show |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220155823/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/martin-shkreli-sec-investigation_5601a3c4e4b08820d91a6b6f |archive-date=December 20, 2015 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''The Wall Street Journal'', Shkreli said that he was targeted by law enforcement for his price hikes of the drug [[Daraprim]] and his flamboyant personality.&lt;ref name="Copeland2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Shkreli Says Drug-Price Hikes Led to Arrest |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/martin-shkreli-says-drug-price-hikes-led-to-arrest-1450671884|first=Rob|last=Copeland|accessdate=December 21, 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, Shkreli retained [[criminal defense attorney]] [[Benjamin Brafman]] to defend him.&lt;ref name="Goldstein2016"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Matthew|last1=Goldstein|first2=Alexandra|last2=Stevenson|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/04/business/martin-shkreli-appears-to-adopt-a-new-legal-strategy-silence.html|title=Martin&amp;nbsp;Shkreli Appears to Adopt a New Legal Strategy:&amp;nbsp;Silence|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|date=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Silverstein2016"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jason|last=Silverstein|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/martin-shkreli-hires-famed-defense-attorney-benjamin-brafman-article-1.2517398|title=Shkreli hires Brafman, high‑profile attorney|location=New York|work=Daily News|date=February 2, 2016|lccn=sn83030450}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his 2017 trial, Shkreli argued that none of his investors actually lost money (some actually turned a profit) and thus his actions did not constitute a crime.&lt;ref name="WashPost defense story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Merle|first=Renae|title=The fascinating legal argument at the heart of the Martin Shkreli 'Pharma Bro' trial|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/the-fascinating-legal-argument-at-the-heart-of-the-martin-shkreli-pharma-bro-trial/2017/07/08/658507|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=July 8, 2017|accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shkreli's frequent criticisms of the federal prosecutors in New York's [[Eastern District of New York|Eastern District]], whom he called "junior varsity" compared to their counterparts in the [[Southern District of New York|Southern District]] across the [[East River]], both on his [[Facebook]] [[streaming video]] feed and in the hallways of the courthouse, led those prosecutors to request that judge [[Kiyo A.

On August 4, 2017, the trial jury found Shkreli guilty on two counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and not guilty on five other counts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/martin-shkreli-trial-verdict-guilty-3-counts-not-guilty-8/|title=Martin Shkreli trial verdict: Guilty on 3 of 8 counts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shkreli said he was delighted with the outcome and described his prosecution as "a witch hunt of epic proportions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/verdict-reached-pharma-bro-martin-shkrelis-securities-fraud/story?id=48945438|title='Pharma Bro' Martin Shkreli 'delighted' by verdict in securities fraud trial|date=2017-08-04|publisher=ABC News|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, 2017, his bail was revoked following a Facebook post offering $5,000 for a strand of Hillary Clinton's hair which the judge perceived as solicitation to assault, which is not protected under the First Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/business/dealbook/martin-shkreli-jail.html|title=Martin Shkreli Is Jailed for Seeking a Hair From Hillary Clinton|first=Stephanie|last=Clifford|date=September 13, 2017|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shkreli's post was preceded by others that suggested he might have plans to clone Hillary Clinton.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2017/09/13/pharma-bro-jailed-after-judge-declares-him-a-danger-to-society/|title=Pharma Bro jailed after judge declares him a 'danger to society'|date=2017-09-13|work=New York Post|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shkreli said that his post was satire, and his lawyer described it as tasteless but not a threat.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Shkreli edited the post to add a disclaimer that it was satire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/06/martin-shkrelis-reward-for-hillary-clintons-hair-wu-tang-clan-sale.html|title=Martin Shkreli posts 'bounty' for Hillary Clinton's hair; puts Wu-Tang Clan album on sale|first=Dan|last=Mangan|date=September 6, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later said he did this minutes after publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2017/09/12/pharma-bro-apologizes-as-judge-weighs-locking-him-up-for-clinton-trolling/|title='Pharma Bro' apologizes as judge weighs locking him up for Clinton trolling|date=September 12, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shkreli apologized for the post.&lt;ref name="Renae"&gt;{{cite web|author=Merle, Renae|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2017/09/13/martin-shkreli-apologizes-for-facebook-post-about-hillary-clinton/|title=Martin Shkreli jailed after Facebook post about Hillary Clinton|newspaper=Washington Post|date=2017-09-13|accessdate=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent to the [[Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn]]&lt;ref name="place_of_imprisonment"/&gt; while awaiting sentencing.&lt;ref name="Renae"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Covucci, David (September 14, 2017)"Martin Shkreli's bail revoked after dumb Facebook threat" https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/martin-shkreli-jail-clinton/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forfeitures ===
On March 5, 2018, Shkreli was ordered to forfeit nearly $7.4 million  in assets.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/05/news/martin-shkreli-wu-tang-forfeiture/index.html|title=Martin Shkreli must forfeit $7.4 million, including infamous Wu Tang album|date=2018-03-05|work=CNN|access-date=2017-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court ordered that if Shkreli had insufficient cash to fulfill the forfeiture order, his assets&amp;mdash;including a piece of art by [[Pablo Picasso]], his unique [[Wu-Tang Clan|Wu-Tang]] album ''[[Once Upon a Time in Shaolin]]'', the unreleased [[Lil Wayne]] album'' [[Tha Carter V]]'', and Shkreli's pharmaceutical company shares&amp;mdash;could be seized.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-05/shkreli-ordered-by-federal-judge-to-forfeit-almost-7-4-million Shkreli Ordered by U.S. Judge to Forfeit Almost $7.4 Million], Bloomberg News (March 5, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; In April he was ordered to pay $388,000 in [[restitution]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/martin-shkreli-ordered-to-pay-388k-in-restitution-to-investor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statements at sentencing ===
During his sentencing, judge Kiyo Matsumoto said Shkreli seemed "genuinely remorseful," regarding his "egregious multitude of lies," but said he had "repeatedly minimized" his misconduct.  Shkreli, who reportedly cried as he gave his statement to the court, stated "I was never motivated by money."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/business/martin-shkreli-sentenced.html|title=Martin Shkreli Sentenced to 7 Years in Prison for Fraud|last=Clifford|first=Stephanie|date=2018-03-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Incarceration ===
On March 9, 2018, Shkreli was sentenced to seven years in federal prison.&lt;ref name="HaysLong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News 9 March 2018"&gt;{{cite web | title= 'Pharma Bro' Martin Shkreli sentenced to seven years| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-43352073| author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= 9 March 2018|publisher=BBC News| access-date= 9 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is federal inmate number 87850-053 and was held at the [[Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn]] prior to being transferred to federal prison.&lt;ref name="place_of_imprisonment2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/martin-shkreli-inmate-facebook-post-2017-9|title=Martin Shkreli is in prison — and could end up facing a longer sentence|last=Abadi|first=Mark|date=2017-09-15|access-date=2017-10-08|website=[[Business Insider]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 27, 2018 it was reported that Judge Kiyo Matsumoto agreed to recommend Shkreli serve his prison sentence at the minimum security federal camp at [[United States Penitentiary, Canaan|USP Canaan]], which he had previously requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-files-notice-of-appeal-of-fraud-conviction.html|title=Pharma bro Martin Shkreli appeals fraud conviction as judge mulls restitution award|last=Mangan|first=Dan|date=2018-03-27|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://article.wn.com/view/2018/03/14/Pharma_bro_fraudster_Martin_Shkreli_I_want_to_serve_prison_i_t/&lt;/ref&gt; On April 18, 2018, Shkreli was transferred from Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn to [[Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Dix|FCI Fort Dix]] after his request to serve at USP Canaan was denied.&lt;ref name="place_of_imprisonment" /&gt;

As of October 25, 2018, with the assistance of a friend, Shkreli is keeping an online blog while incarcerated wherein he posts regularly on his thoughts on investing, the pharmaceutical industry, as well as personal notes on his incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;http://martinshkreli.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil penalties ==
In December 2016, the New York state Department of Taxation and Finance issued a tax warrant for $1.26 million for unpaid taxes owed by Shkreli.   After Shkreli made partial payments, the state recouped another $134,500 from Shkreli by seizing and auctioning off an [[Enigma machine]] for $65,000, a manuscript signed by [[Isaac Newton]], a letter from [[Charles Darwin]], and another letter written by English mathematician and writer [[Augusta Ada King-Noel]], Countess of Lovelace.

On April 23, 2018, it was reported that in court filings New York's attorney general had asked Judge Matsumoto for priority on more than $480,000 in court-ordered forfeitures, to recover additional unpaid taxes and penalties owed to the state, over the federal government's claims for Shkreli's forfeited assets. Prior to Shkreli's conviction, the state of New York had been aggressively attempting to collect the tax debts from Shkreli and had already seized and auctioned off several of items including the rare Nazi Enigma code machine.

At the same time, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] announced that Shkreli had agreed to an order that would bar him from the [[securities industry]] in order to settle a pending SEC administrative action against him, however, Shkreli is eligible to apply for readmission to the industry subject to applicable laws and regulations governing the process.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Net worth ==
In January 2016, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' estimated the 32-year-old Shkreli's net worth as at least $45 million but later updated its profile to reflect that {{nobreak|"[S]ince}} this article was published the value of Shkreli's E*Trade account has dropped by more than $40 million".&lt;ref&gt;[http://fortune.com/2016/01/08/martin-shkreli-net-worth Shkreli net worth estimate], fortune.com, January 8, 2016; accessed April 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Shkreli leveraged a $4 million [[E-Trade]] account for his bail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fortune.com/2016/02/03/martin-shkrelis-etrade-account-has-lost-40-million Shkreli's etrade account has lost $40 million], fortune.com; accessed February 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Reuters reported that Shkreli had reported his net worth at $70 million after being arrested in 2015 and that his attorney Benjamin Brafman, in a hearing before Judge Kiyo Matsumoto, had conceded that his client still owned shares of Turing Pharmaceuticals worth between $30 to $50 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/usa-crime-shkreli-idINL1N1JG1AK|title=U.S. judge wants more details on ex-drug executive Shkreli's finances|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=Reuters India|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
In October 2015, presidential candidate [[Bernie Sanders]] acknowledged having received a $2,700 donation from Shkreli, whom he had previously called a "poster child of greed". Sanders, however, said he would forward the money to [[Whitman-Walker Health]], a D.C. community clinic known for its expertise in [[HIV/AIDS]] healthcare. Shkreli told medicine news portal STAT that among his reasons for donating to Sanders' campaign was that he supports some of Sanders' positions, excluding the ones about drug prices. He claimed he hoped to gain Sanders' attention in order to explain to him in a private meeting the drug companies' price-setting mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Isidore|title=Bernie Sanders rejects donation from most hated drug CEO|publisher=[[CNN Money]]|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/10/16/news/companies/sanders-drug-ceo-shkreli-donation|date=October 19, 2015|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
===Hobbies and interests===
Shkreli has a variety of interests ranging from collecting rare music albums to video gaming. He is an avid ''[[League of Legends]]'' player and in May 2014 he began expressing interest in purchasing an [[eSports]] team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/esports/shkreli-challenger-inori-curryshotgg|title=Millionaire pharmaceutical CEO set to shake up Challenger scene with new team|first=Jacob|last=Wolf|work=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=May 6, 2015|accessdate=August 27, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923224828/http://www.dailydot.com/esports/shkreli-challenger-inori-curryshotgg/#|archive-date=September 23, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enemy eSports]] announced that it had rejected a {{US$|1.2 million}} offer from Shkreli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esportsgo.com/enemy-esports-turned-1-2-million-league-legends-team/esports|title=Enemy Esports Turned Down $1.2&amp;nbsp;Million For Their League of Legends Team|first=Alexandre "Druppet"|last=Weber|work=eSports Go|date=May 4, 2015|accessdate=September 24, 2015}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later founded his own team, Odyssey eSports, and aimed to qualify for the 2015 [[North American League of Legends Challenger Series]]. The team failed to qualify. In August 2015, Odyssey merged with another team to become the organisation Team Imagine, with Shkreli becoming chairman of the team. During the merger, the organization signed the ''[[Dota&amp;nbsp;2]]'' team Leviathan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/esports/imagine-odyssey-merger|title=Imagine and Odyssey merge, add Leviathan Dota&amp;nbsp;2 squad|first=Jacob|last=Wolf|work=The Daily Dot|date=August 7, 2015|accessdate=August 27, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923224803/http://www.dailydot.com/esports/imagine-odyssey-merger/#|archive-date=September 23, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dotablast.com/recently-merged-league-of-legends-organization-adds-team-leviathan-dota-2-squad|title=Recently merged League of Legends organization adds Team Leviathan Dota&amp;nbsp;2 squad|work=DotaBlast|first=Andra|last=Ciubotaru|date=August 18, 2015|accessdate=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Shkreli began [[Streaming media|livestreaming]] on [[YouTube]]. His streams, which last for hours at a time, have shown him working and [[Idle|idly]] passing time in mundane ways, such as playing video games, using social media or taking telephone calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statnews.com/2015/11/12/martin-shkreli-show-reviled-pharma-exec-just-cant-stop-talking|title=Martin Shkreli, widely scorned CEO, livestreams his life|work=STAT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he conducted lessons in market analysis and chemistry, explaining the basics of each subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Pharma Bro' Martin Shkreli's reputation precedes him, affecting jury selection|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-shkreli-trial-20170626-story.html|author=[[Associated Press]]|date=June 26, 2017|publisher=''LA Times''|access-date=September 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously streamed on the website [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]] but switched to YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8gjB1PSXv_oAUSAQ16S0fA|title=Martin Shkreli |publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Shkreli was [[Arraignment|arraigned]] in December and released on bail, he continued streaming from his apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCB6AybM4Cs|title=Martin Shkreli Live Stream|date=November 4, 2015|first=Martin|last=Shkreli|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shkreli was revealed as the winner of an auction for the [[Wu-Tang Clan]] album ''[[Once Upon a Time in Shaolin]]'' after the single copy of the album was sold via [[Paddle8]] on November 24, 2015, for {{US$|2 million}} to what was reported to be a "private American collector".&lt;ref&gt;[[Zack O'Malley Greenburg|Greenburg, Zack O'Malley]] (November 24, 2015).

'''Mary, [[Lady#British and Irish usage|Lady]] Heath'''&lt;ref&gt;She is often incorrectly referred to as "Lady Mary Heath". The title "Lady" before the Christian name is borne by daughters of dukes, marquesses and earls. This lady's title derived from [[Sir James Heath, 1st Baronet|her husband]]'s baronetcy, so she should be called "Lady Heath".&lt;/ref&gt; (10 November 1896 – 9 May 1939)&lt;ref&gt;Connor, Pat. [http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/IRELAND/2003-08/1061488617 "Lady Sophie Mary Heath".] ''RootsWeb'', 21 August 2003. Retrieved: 19 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; was an Irish [[aviator]] and began life as '''Sophie Catherine Theresa Mary Peirce-Evans''' in [[Knockaderry]], [[County Limerick]], near the town of [[Newcastle West]]. She was one of the best known women in the world for a five-year period from the mid-1920s.

==Early life==
When the young Sophie Peirce-Evans was one year old, her father John Peirce-Evans, bludgeoned her mother Kate Theresa Dooling to death with a heavy stick. He was found guilty of murder and declared insane. His daughter was taken to the home of her grandfather in Newcastle West where she was brought up by two maiden aunts, who discouraged her passion for sports.

After schooldays in Rochelle School, [[Cork (city)|Cork]]; Princess Garden Belfast and St Margaret's Hall on Mespil Road in [[City of Dublin|Dublin]], where she played [[hockey]] and [[lawn tennis|tennis]], Sophie enrolled in the Royal College of Science in Ireland (which later became subsumed into [[University College Dublin|UCD]] and is currently home to the [[Taoiseach]]'s office on Merrion Street).

The college was designed to produce the educated farmers which the country then needed. Sophie, one of the few women in the college, duly took a top-class degree in science, specialising in agriculture. She also played with the college hockey team and contributed to a student magazine, copies of which are held in the [[National Library of Ireland]].

==Careers==

===Athletics===
Before becoming a pilot Lady Heath had already made her mark. During the [[First World War]], she spent two years as a dispatch rider, based in England and later France, where she had her portrait painted by Sir [[John Lavery]]. By then, she had married the first of her three husbands and as Sophie Mary Eliott-Lynn, was one of the founders of the [[Women's Amateur Athletic Association]] after her move from her native Ireland to London in 1922, following a brief sojourn in [[Aberdeen, Scotland|Aberdeen]]. She was Britain's first women's [[javelin throw|javelin]] champion and set a disputed world record for the [[high jump]]. She was also a delegate to the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 1925, the same year that she took her first flying lessons. In 1923 she represented the United Kingdom at the [[1923 Women's Olympiad]]&lt;ref name="Markula2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Markula|first=Pirkko|title=Feminist Sport Studies: Sharing Experiences Of Joy And Pain|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=dQ7Q8ChK3TcC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;dq=1923+sports+april+Monte+Carlo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2u5AINh1_R&amp;sig=v9bi_fBZXObF2ZWqQGAOVF2v9Yk&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6qZHQz-7RAhVDMZoKHW5WBeAQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Sophie%20Mary%20Heath&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 January 2017|year=2005|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791465301|pages=178–9|chapter=Sophie.Part Two:The Athlete}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Monte Carlo, during the [[Women's Olympiad|games]] she came third place at the [[high jump]], [[javelin throw]] and the [[Women's pentathlon]], later that year she participated in the [[1923 WAAA Championships|first WAAA Championships]]. In 1924 she participated in the [[1924 Women's Olympiad]] winning the silver medal in the long jump, in 1926 she again represented the United Kingdom at [[javelin throw|javelin]] at the [[1926 Women's World Games]] in Gothenburg, coming fourth&lt;ref name="Markula2005" /&gt; with a throw of 44.63 metres.

===Aviation career===
[[File:StateLibQld 1 114664 Men and women who rival the birds, 1930.jpg|thumb|250 px|Mary Lady Heath (atop centre)]]

The following year, Lady Heath became the first woman to hold a commercial flying licence in Britain and along the way, set records for altitude in a small plane and later a [[Short Brothers|Shorts]] [[seaplane]], was the first woman to parachute from an aeroplane (landing in the middle of a football match). After her great flight from the Cape, she took a mechanic's qualification in the USA, the first woman to do so.

In an era when the world had gone aviation-mad due to the exploits of [[Charles Lindbergh]] and [[Amelia Earhart]], Lady Heath was more than able to hold her own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1939/05/10/page/28/article/famed-aviatrix-dies-after-fall-in-a-street-car/index.html chicago tribune 1939/05/10 page 28 "bracketed with Lindberg, by Int. League of Aviators as 1927 flier of the year"]&lt;/ref&gt; "Britain's Lady Lindy," as she was known in the United States, made front-page news as the first pilot, male or female, to fly a small open-cockpit aircraft from [[Cape Town]] to London ([[Croydon Aerodrome]]). She had thought it would take her three weeks; as it turned out, it took her three months, from January to May 1928.&lt;ref name="Blake2015"&gt;{{citation|last=Blake|first=Debbie|title=Daughters of Ireland: Pioneering Irish Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gekoCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT165|year=2015|publisher=History Press|location=Dublin, Ireland|isbn=978-0-7509-6569-9|pages=165–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A scale model of the plane used by Lady Mary is on display at [[The Little Museum of Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.littlemuseum.ie/]&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote about the experience later in a book ''Woman and Flying'', that she co-wrote with Stella Wolfe Murray.&lt;ref&gt;Heath and Murray 1929 {{Page needed|date=May 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1928 she spent a few weeks volunteering as a [[co-pilot]] with a civil airline, [[KLM|KLM. ]] She was hoping to be appointed to  the newly created Batavia route, which would have made her the first woman pilot with a commercial airline. The world was not ready for female pilots and her hope was not fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Pelletier 2012 {{page needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just when her fame was at its height, with her life a constant whirl of lectures, races and long-distance flights, Lady Heath (she married [[Sir James Heath, 1st Baronet|Sir James Heath]] in October 1927)&lt;ref name=Burke&gt;{{cite book|title=Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 1938|publisher=Burke's Peerage Ltd|page=1275}}&lt;/ref&gt; was badly injured in a crash just before the [[National Air Races]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] in 1929. Before her accident Lady Heath applied for American citizenship, intending to remain in the USA where she had made a good living on the lecture circuit and as an agent for promote Cirrus engines. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Western Daily Press|title=Lady Heath and American|date=30 January 1929|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Heath was never the same after her accident.

After divorce in [[Reno]], [[Nevada]], from Heath in 1930,&lt;ref name=Burke/&gt; she returned to Ireland with her third husband G.A.R. Williams, a horseman and pilot of Caribbean origin, and became involved in private aviation, briefly running her own company at [[Finglas|Kildonan]], near Dublin in the mid-1930s, and helping produce the generation of pilots that would help establish the national airline [[Aer Lingus]].

==Family life==

===Marriages===
Lady Heath first marriage was to Major William Elliot Lynn after which she was well known as Mrs Elliot Lynn.&lt;ref name="times" /&gt; She divorced her husband, alleging cruelty and after he died in London in early 1927, married [[Sir James Heath, 1st Baronet|Sir James Heath]] on 11 October 1927&lt;ref name=Burke&gt;{{cite book|title=Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 1938|publisher=Burke's Peerage Ltd|page=1275}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Christ Church in Mayfair, London. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In January 1930 she filed for a divorce from Heath in [[Reno, Nevada]], United States and was awarded a [[decree nisi]] in May of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Hull Daily Mail|date=3 May 1930|title=Lady Heath - Decree Nisi Expected to be obtained to-day|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Western Morning News|date=21 January 1930|page=7|title=Lady Heath - Well-known Aviatrix Files Divorce Suit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 November 1931, she married G.A.R Williams&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/image/52629499/ The Brooklyn Daily Eagle. Brooklyn, New York. Tuesday, May 9, 1939, Page 1 - Newspapers.com] "George Anthony Reginald"&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Western Morning News|title=Lady Heath married in America|date=13 November 1931|page=7 |url = http://www.genesreunited.co.uk/searchbna/results?memberlastsubclass=none&amp;searchhistorykey=0&amp;keywords=g%20a%20r%20williams&amp;county=devon,%20england&amp;type=article}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genesreunited.co.uk/searchbna/results?memberlastsubclass=none&amp;searchhistorykey=0&amp;keywords=g%20a%20r%20williams&amp;from=1931&amp;to=1939&amp;type=article "G A R Williams" in the British Newspaper Archive - 1931-1939 - genesreunited.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
On 9 May 1939, aged 42, she died in St Leonard's Hospital, [[Shoreditch, London]] following a fall inside a [[double-decker tram]].&lt;ref name="times"&gt;"Mrs. G. A. R. Williams." Times [London, England] 10 May 1939: 18. [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/archive/ The Times Digital Archive].

A pathologist said he found no evidence of [[alcohol]] but detailed evidence of an old blood clot which may have caused the fall; the jury returned a verdict of [[accidental death]].&lt;ref name="inquest" /&gt;  On 15 May 1939, according to newspaper reports,  her ashes were scattered over [[Surrey]] from an aircraft flown by her estranged husband from [[Croydon Airport]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Western Daily Press|title=|date=16 May 1939|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Western Gazette|title=|date=19 May 1939|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  although legend has it that her ashes were returned to Ireland where they were scattered over her native Newcastle West. 

==In popular culture==
In 2013, aviator [[Tracey Curtis-Taylor]] retraced Lady Heath's 1928 South Africa to England flight in a biplane. The flight was the subject of a BBC documentary, which included details and photographs of Lady Heath's original flight.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05n29m7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maurice Clemmons''' (February 6, 1972 &amp;ndash; December 1, 2009) was the shooter in the November 29, 2009 [[2009 shooting of Lakewood, Washington, police officers|murder of four police officers]] in [[Parkland, Washington]].&lt;ref name="Naughton1130"/&gt; After evading police for two days following the shooting, Clemmons was shot and killed by a [[Seattle Police Department|police officer]] in [[Seattle]].

Prior to his involvement in the shooting, Clemmons had at least five felony convictions in [[Arkansas]] and at least eight felony charges in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].&lt;ref name="Buck1130"/&gt; His first incarceration began in 1989, at age 17. Facing sentences totaling 108 years in prison, the burglary sentences were reduced in 2000 by [[Governor of Arkansas]] [[Mike Huckabee]] to 47 years, which made him immediately eligible for parole. The Arkansas Parole Board unanimously moved to release him in 2000. Clemmons was subsequently arrested on other charges and was jailed several times. In the months prior to the Parkland shooting, he was in jail on charges of [[assault]]ing a police officer and [[rape|raping]] a child. One week prior to the Parkland shooting, he was released from jail after posting a $150,000 [[bail bond]]. 

At the time, Clemmons' murder of four police officers represented the largest number of law enforcement officers killed by a lone perpetrator in a single incident in U.S. history. It was surpassed in July 2016 when [[2016 shooting of Dallas police officers|a mass shooting]] occurred in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], resulting in the deaths of five police officers.

Clemmons pretended to have a gun in his pocket and threatened to shoot her if she did not give him her purse. When she responded, "Well, why don't you just shoot?", he punched her in the head and ran off with the purse, which contained $16 and a credit card.&lt;ref name="Brunner1130" /&gt;

Clemmons was accused multiple times of displaying violent behavior during court appearances. In one incident, he dismantled a metal door stop and hid it in his sock to use as a weapon. It was discovered and confiscated by a court bailiff. In another incident, he took a lock from his holding cell and threw it at a bailiff, but missed and accidentally hit his mother instead.&lt;ref name="ST1129" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brunner1130" /&gt; Clemmons was once accused of reaching for a guard's pistol while being transported to court. During one trial, he was shackled in leg irons and seated next to a uniformed officer because the presiding judge ordered extra security, claiming Clemmons had threatened him.&lt;ref name="ST1129" /&gt; At age 16, Clemmons' charges were committed from juvenile court to adult court due to the extremely violent nature of his crimes and demeanor.&lt;ref name="Robinson1201"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Robinson |first=Sean |title=Clemmons deemed "dangerous" by psychologists |work=[[The News Tribune]] |date=2009-12-01 |url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/293/story/975661.html?storylink=omni_popular |accessdate=2009-12-02}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1990, Clemmons was sentenced to 108 years in prison for eight felony charges from his teenage years in Arkansas. The total prison term stemmed from multiple sentences, some of which were concurrent to others and some were consecutive.&lt;ref name="Robinson1201"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brantley1130"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Brantley|first=Max|title=Maurice Clemmons' record UPDATE|date=2009-11-30|work=[[Arkansas Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest sentencing came in 1990, when he was given a 60-year prison term for breaking into an Arkansas state trooper's home and stealing about $6,700-worth of items, including a gun.&lt;ref name="Brunner1130"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Robinson|first=Sean|title=Person of interest in slayings began criminal career as a teen |date=2009-11-29|work=[[The News Tribune]]|url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/topstories/story/973971.html|accessdate=2009-12-01}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During his sentencing on the charges, a circuit judge told Clemmons that he had broken his mother's heart, to which he responded, "I have broken my own heart."&lt;ref name="ST1129"/&gt; Clemmons was sentenced in 1989 to 35 years in prison for robbing the woman in front of the Little Rock hotel bar. Among his other sentences were six years for weapon possession based on his high school arrest;&lt;ref name="Brunner1130"/&gt; and eight years for burglary, theft and probation in Pulaski County on September 9, 1989. He was ineligible for parole until 2015 or later.&lt;ref name="Brunner1130"/&gt; He was originally held at the Tucker Correctional Facility in [[Tucker, Arkansas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|date=June 21, 1999|title=Executive Clemency Appeal|publication-place=[[Little Rock, Arkansas]] |publisher=Arkansas Board of Parole|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was eventually transferred to the [[Cummins Unit]] near [[Grady, Arkansas|Grady]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|date=July 13, 2000|title=Arkansas Post Prison Transfer Board Work Sheet |publication-place=[[Little Rock, Arkansas]]|publisher=Arkansas Board of Parole|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, after having served 10 years of his sentence, Clemmons filed a [[pardon|clemency]] appeal with Arkansas [[Governor of Arkansas|Governor]] [[Mike Huckabee]].&lt;ref name="Robinson1201"/&gt; 

In his petition to Huckabee, Clemmons wrote he came from "a very good [[Christianity|Christian]] family" and was "raised much better than my actions speak".&lt;ref name="Brunner1130"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murphy1201"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Murphy|first=Kim|title=Suspect in Seattle-area police slayings is shot and killed |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=2009-12-01|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-na-police-shooting2-2009dec02,0,7940378.story|accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clemmons claimed he had just moved from [[Seattle]], Washington, to Arkansas as a teenager, and because he had no friends he gave in to peer pressure and "fell in with the wrong crowd" to be accepted by his young peers, which led him to commit his crimes.&lt;ref name="Brunner1130"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson1201"/&gt; Although he apologized for his actions, Clemmons also complained that he received overly harsh sentences. He also claimed to have changed and expressed regret that his mother had recently died without seeing him turn his life around. Clemmons' clemency application was supported by Pulaski County Circuit Court Judge Marion Humphrey, who argued the cumulative sentence was excessive and cited Clemmons' young age at the time he committed the crimes.&lt;ref name="Brunner1130"/&gt;

The decision was made over the objections of some victims and prosecutors involved in Clemmons' previous cases but was supported by the bipartisan parole board and the trial court judge in Clemmons' case.&lt;ref name="ST1129"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brunner1130"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson1201"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Egan1130"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Egan|first=Timothy|author-link=Timothy Egan|date=2009-11-30|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Mike Huckabee's Burden|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/30/mike-huckabees-burden/ |accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Fraiser, an attorney who prosecuted early cases against Clemmons in Pulaski County, argued Clemmons was extremely likely to commit further acts of violence in the future, and said for a teen to receive such a lengthy prison sentence without committing a murder, "you've got to be a bad little dude".&lt;ref name="Brunner1130"/&gt; On May 3, 2000, Huckabee commuted Clemmons' 108-year sentence to 47 years, 5 months and 19 days, which made him eligible for parole that day.&lt;ref name="Brantley1130"/&gt; As a factor in his decision, Huckabee cited the unusually long sentence for Clemmons' age at the time the crimes were committed.&lt;ref name="ST1129"/&gt; The Arkansas Parole Board unanimously approved Clemmons' release on July 13, 2000, and he was set free on August 1, 2000.&lt;ref name="Brantley1130"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brunner1130"/&gt;

==Later crimes==
In March 2001, Clemmons violated parole by committing aggravated robbery and theft again in [[Ouachita County, Arkansas|Ouachita County]]. He was convicted on July 13, 2001 and sentenced to 10 years in prison.&lt;ref name="Brantley1130"/&gt; He faced charges of parole violations, but due to problems with the case, he was not served with the charges until 2004. His attorney argued the parole violation charges should be dropped because so much time had passed, and they were subsequently dismissed.&lt;ref name="Robinson1201"/&gt; Clemmons was granted parole on the robbery charges in 2004. He told the parole board he was "not ready" the first time he was released, but that he "doesn't want to die in prison" and will "try to do the right thing".&lt;ref name="Murphy1201"/&gt; Clemmons moved to Washington in 2004 while still on parole, which was approved by Arkansas authorities.&lt;ref name="Brunner1130"/&gt; That year, he married a woman named Nicole Smith, although ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' later reported the relationship had "been tumultuous".&lt;ref name="ST1129"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brunner1130"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry1201"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Perry |first1=Nick |last2=O'Hagan |first2=Maureen |last3=Armstrong |first3=Ken |title=Four days in May set stage for Sunday's tragedy |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=2009-12-01 |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2010392869_shootingjustice01m.html |accessdate=2009-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204124641/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2010392869_shootingjustice01m.html |archivedate=2009-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was placed under the supervision of the [[Washington State Department of Corrections]] and classified as "high risk to reoffend". His supervision was to continue until October 2015. He lived in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], where he ran a landscaping and power-washing business out of his house.&lt;ref name="ST1129"/&gt; Over the next five years, Clemmons bought six houses, including one in Arkansas and five in Washington.&lt;ref name="Robinson1201"/&gt;

Following his parole in 2004, Clemmons had no arrests or problems with the law until May 2009.&lt;ref name="Robinson1201"/&gt; ''The Seattle Times'' referred to four days in May 2009 as the time when "Maurice Clemmons' behavior and mental state deteriorated".&lt;ref name="Perry1201"/&gt; On May 9, a [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce County]] sheriff's deputy responded to Clemmons' home after reports he was throwing rocks at houses, cars and people. When the deputy tried to enter the house, one of Clemmons' cousins grabbed his wrist. After a struggle, Clemmons emerged from the house and punched the deputy in the face, and assaulted a second deputy who arrived to help. Clemmons was placed under arrest and taken to Pierce County Jail, where he continued to struggle and told jail workers, "I'll kill all you bitches."&lt;ref name="Robinson1201"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry1201"/&gt; He was charged with two felony assault charges and two felony malicious mischief charges, and released from jail the next day after posting a $40,000 bail bond without seeing a judge.&lt;ref name="Perry1201"/&gt;

On May 11, around 1 a.m., Clemmons appeared naked in his living room and ordered two female relatives, ages 11 and 12, to fondle him. The two reportedly complied out of fear, and the 11-year-old fled the house afterward. Clemmons took the 12-year-old into his bedroom along with Clemmons' wife.&lt;ref name="Perry1201"/&gt; Clemmons repeatedly referred to himself as Jesus, and said his wife was [[Eve]].&lt;ref name="Murphy1201"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry1201"/&gt; He released the 12-year-old girl after his wife begged him to let her go. However, around 4 a.m. that same morning, he gathered his family back into the living room and demanded they strip naked together. He later left the house, claiming the world was coming to an end and that he was "going to fly to [[heaven]]". A family member called 911 and police found Clemmons at a nearby second house he was building, but Clemmons fled on foot and escaped. He failed to appear the next day for an arraignment on his May 9 charges. [[Child Protective Services]] investigated and substantiated the [[sexual abuse]] complaint.&lt;ref name="Perry1201"/&gt; Latanya Clemmons, Clemmons's sister, told authorities he had undergone a change and was "not in his right mind".&lt;ref name="Murphy1201"/&gt;

Clemmons was arrested on July 1, 2009, after he appeared in a Pierce County court trying to have his [[bench warrant]] thrown out. He was charged with second-degree rape of a child, as well as being a fugitive from Arkansas.&lt;ref name="Perry1201"/&gt; At the time of his arrest, Clemmons made religiously themed comments and referred to himself as "the beast". He also told a police officer that [[United States president|President]] [[Barack Obama]] and [[LeBron James]] were his brothers, and [[Oprah Winfrey]] was his sister.&lt;ref name="Robinson1201"/&gt; Pierce County prosecutors asserted that Clemmons' recent crimes amounted to a violation of Clemmons' parole in Arkansas, and that he faced years in prison if he was returned to the state. However, the [[List of law enforcement agencies in Arkansas|Arkansas Department of Community Correction]] notified Pierce County on July 22 that they did not intend to ask for his [[extradition]] and that he should be [[adjudication|adjudicated]] on his Washington charges. Stephen Penner, a deputy prosecuting attorney in Pierce County, said of the Arkansas decision, "There's a built-in incentive to not following through. In a way, the more violent they are, the less you want them in your community."&lt;ref name="Perry1201"/&gt;

During a court-ordered mental health evaluation, Clemmons told psychologists he had experienced hallucinations in May 2009 of "people drinking blood and people eating babies, and lawless on the streets, like people were [[cannibalism|cannibals]]".&lt;ref name="Robinson1201"/&gt; He claimed the visions had since passed. He also claimed to have no faith in the American justice system and thought he was being "maliciously persecuted because I'm black and they believe the police".&lt;ref name="Robinson1201"/&gt; The evaluation, completed by two psychologists from the [[Western State Hospital (Washington State)|Western State Hospital]] on October 19, concluded Clemmons was dangerous and presented an increased risk of future criminal acts.&lt;ref name="Robinson1201"/&gt; Pierce County Judge John McCarthy set bail for Clemmons' assault charges at $40,000, considerably below the $100,000 prosecutors sought based on Clemmons' history of violence. Pierce County Judge Thomas Felnagle set bail for the child-rape charges at $150,000, lower than the $200,000 sought by prosecutors,&lt;ref name="Perry1201"/&gt; but higher than usual for the charges.&lt;ref name="Brunner1130"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson1201"/&gt; 

After a mental evaluation, a psychologist concluded Clemmons was competent to stand trial on the charges, which eliminated him as a candidate for involuntary commitment. An attorney for Clemmons notified the court he planned to pursue an [[insanity defense|insanity]] or [[Diminished responsibility|diminished-capacity defense]].&lt;ref name="ST1129"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson1201"/&gt; On November 23, 2009, Clemmons paid $15,000 for a $190,000 bail bond from Jail Sucks Bail Bonds, a [[Chehalis, Washington|Chehalis]]-based company, to secure his release.&lt;ref name="ST1129"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry1201"/&gt; Two other bail bond agencies had rejected Clemmons based on his history of failing to appear in court.&lt;ref name="Perry1201"/&gt;

Darcus Allen, a convicted murderer who previously served in an Arkansas prison with Clemmons, was allegedly present for the conversation.&lt;ref name="Lynn0303"/&gt; Also on Thanksgiving, Clemmons cut off a GPS monitor which Jail Sucks Bail Bonds had secured onto his ankle.&lt;ref name="MartinArmstrong"/&gt; On November 28, Clemmons showed two handguns to friends Eddie and Douglas Davis and told them he planned to shoot police officers with them; the exchange was witnessed by Clemmons' half-brother Rickey Hinton, with whom he shared a house.&lt;ref name="Netter1202"/&gt; During the exchange, Clemmons danced around with the guns in his hands, claiming to be [[Lucifer]]. He told the men he had twice tried to go to a Tacoma police station, where he planned to walk in and start shooting. The first time the station was closed, and the second time he got a flat tire on the way there, Clemmons claimed. He talked about stopping at a crowded intersection or a school and shooting people there.&lt;ref name="MartinArmstrong"/&gt;

On the morning of November 29, Clemmons drove a white pickup truck to Allen's home, and then Allen drove him past the Forza Coffee Co. coffee shop in [[Parkland, Washington]], a suburb of [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]]. After they saw marked police patrol cars in the parking lot, Allen drove back past the coffee shop and parked nearby.

Clemmons went back to his house and told Hinton he had been shot by police, and Hinton allegedly gave Eddie and Douglas Davis a car to "get Clemmons out of here". As they drove, Clemmons told the brothers he "had taken care of his business". The Davis brothers took Clemmons to other friends, who bandaged his wounds.&lt;ref name="Netter1202"/&gt; Later that day, police received a tip that Clemmons was seeking shelter from friends in [[Seattle]]. Police pulled over a white car they believed to have been transporting him, and the female driver admitted Clemmons was a friend and she had brought him to Seattle after he told her "he had killed a police officer or officers".&lt;ref name="Netter1202"/&gt;

Coffee shop employees who witnessed the shooting identified Clemmons as the shooter from a series of photos.&lt;ref name="Netter1202"/&gt; Authorities sought him in what was considered one of the biggest manhunts the Seattle-Tacoma area had ever seen, and Clemmons was considered the most wanted man in the Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref name="Johnson1201"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Johnson|first=Gene |title=Seattle police kill suspect in officer slayings|work=[[Associated Press]]|date=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities also surrounded the homes of Clemmons' friends and family in order to prevent him from finding shelter, and to determine who was helping him.&lt;ref name="Murphy1201"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Netter1202"/&gt; A relative learned that Clemmons was coming to her home in the [[Leschi, Seattle|Leschi]] neighborhood in Seattle, informed the police and fled.

After several attempts to coax or force him out of the house, including use of a robot and flashbang grenades, police entered and discovered Clemmons was not inside.&lt;ref name="Netter1202" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pulkkinen1130"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Karlinsky|first1=Neal|last2=Netter|first2=Sarah|title=Washington Cop Shooting Suspect Maurice Clemmons Not in House Targeted by Police|work=[[ABC News]]|date=2009-11-30|url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/GMA/police-target-lakewood-cop-shooting-suspect-maurice-clemmons/story?id=9202384|accessdate=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, police searched multiple locations in the Seattle and Tacoma areas, including a park where they found a handgun carried by Clemmons and his pickup truck, which had blood stains inside.&lt;ref name="Sullivan1201"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Sullivan |first1=Jennifer |last2=Rahner |first2=Mark |last3=Broom |first3=Jack |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=2009-12-01 |title=Lakewood police shooting suspect killed by Seattle police officer in South Seattle early this morning |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2010393433_webarrest01m.html |accessdate=2009-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204124651/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2010393433_webarrest01m.html |archivedate=2009-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 2:45 a.m., Kelly was on patrol and stopped to investigate a broken-down car on the side of the road, which was idling with its hood up. Kelly recognized the vehicle as having been reported stolen. While sitting in his patrol car and writing a report, Kelly noticed Clemmons approaching him and recognized him as the suspect in the Lakewood shooting. Kelly ordered him to stop and show his hands, but he instead began to flee around the disabled vehicle.&lt;ref name="Murphy1201" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Netter1202" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson1201" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sullivan1201" /&gt; Police claim that Clemmons reached into his waist area for a gun.

Since his death, multiple people have been arrested for helping Clemmons during and after the Lakewood shooting.

==Early life==
Carstairs was born on 18 June 1916 in [[Mussoorie]], [[India]], then part of the [[British Raj]].&lt;ref name="obit - British Journal of Sports Medicine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bio - Anent Scottish Running"&gt;{{cite web|title=GM Carstairs|url=http://www.anentscottishrunning.com/gm-carstairs/|publisher=Anent Scottish Running|date=5 January 2014|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of the Reverend Dr George Carstairs, a [[Church of Scotland]] missionary, and Elizabeth Huntley Carstairs (née Young).&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; He spent his childhood living in India and became fluent in both English and Hindi.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit - British Journal of Sports Medicine" /&gt; At the age of ten, he and his family moved to [[Edinburgh]], Scotland. He was educated at [[George Watson's College]], then an all-boys [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent school]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; He went on to study medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. In 1941, he graduated [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]] (MB ChB).&lt;ref name="obit - British Journal of Sports Medicine" /&gt;

He was an accomplished [[Long-distance running|long-distance runner]] in his youth. He was the Scottish 3 miles champion in 1937, 1938 and 1939.&lt;ref name="obit - British Journal of Sports Medicine" /&gt; He represented Scotland at the [[1937 International University Games]], winning a silver medal in the [[5000 metres]] in a time of 15:24.2. He also represented Scotland at the [[1939 International University Games]], winning a gold medal in the 5000 metres in a time of 15:20.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WORLD STUDENT GAMES (PRE-UNIVERSIADE)|url=http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/wsg.htm|website=GBR Athletics|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He represented Great Britain at the [[1938 European Athletics Championships]], coming sixth in the [[1938 European Athletics Championships – Men's 5000 metres|Men's 5000 metres]] with a time of 14:51.3.&lt;ref name="obit - British Journal of Sports Medicine" /&gt;

==Career==

===Military service===
Having completed medical training, Carstairs was called up for active service during [[World War II]] as a medical officer with the [[Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; He was commissioned into the Medical Branch of the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]] on 15 May 1942 as a [[flying officer]] (emergency).&lt;ref name="LG 16 June 1942"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=35598 |date=16 June 1942 |page=2663 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[flight lieutenant]] ([[war substantive]]) on 15 May 1943.&lt;ref name="LG 27 July 1943"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=36113 |date=27 July 1943 |page=3451 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was demobilised in 1946.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt;

===Medical career===
Following graduation in 1941, Carstairs worked in [[general medicine]]. He was an assistant physician at the [[Royal Edinburgh Hospital]] for a year.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; He served as a medical officer with the [[Royal Air Force]] between 1942 and 1946.&lt;ref name="obit - British Journal of Sports Medicine" /&gt;

In 1953, he began his career in [[psychiatry]] when he was appointed a [[senior registrar]] at the [[Maudsley Hospital]], a [[psychiatric hospital]] in London, England.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; There he worked with chronic psychiatric patients under the supervision of [[Aubrey Lewis|Sir Aubrey Lewis]].&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit - Times" /&gt; During his work, he come to the conclusion that patients with [[schizophrenia]] needed a neutral environment to cope with their condition and returning them to an 'emotionally charged family setting' would only set back their recovery.&lt;ref name="obit - British Journal of Sports Medicine" /&gt; He also discovered that improved motivation in patients helped their rehabilitation.&lt;ref name="letter - Times" /&gt;

In 1960, he was appointed head of a new [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] unit based at [[University College London]]. This unit led the study of [[psychiatric epidemiology]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; When he moved to Edinburgh in 1961, he moved the unit with him and continued its research. He stood down as director in 1971, and was followed by [[Norman Kreitman]].&lt;ref name="obit - British Journal of Sports Medicine" /&gt;

From 1968 to 1972, he was President of the [[World Federation for Mental Health|World Mental Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Presidents|url=http://wfmh.com/about/past-presidents/|publisher=World Federation for Mental Health|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While holding that post, he was involved in the development of psychiatric facilities in under-developed countries.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; In 1978, he left academia and devoted his time to advising the [[World Health Organization]] on developing psychiatric services in India, with emphasis on making them appropriate to Asian needs.&lt;ref name="obit - Times" /&gt;

===Academic career===
In 1961, Carstairs was appointed Professor of Psychological Medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. At the university he created a new working group of academics and practising psychiatrists for research and teaching; it was the first such group created outside London.&lt;ref name="obit - British Journal of Sports Medicine" /&gt; At the university he taught a wide range of course at both undergraduate and graduate level.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt;

He gave the 1962 [[Reith Lectures]], a renowned public lecture series broadcast on [[BBC Radio]], titled ''This Island Now''.&lt;ref name="obit - British Journal of Sports Medicine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC - Reith Lectures"&gt;{{cite web|title=George Carstairs: This Island Now: 1962|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h9l9f|website=The Reith Lectures|publisher=BBC|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one lecture he condoned [[pre-marital sex]], which produced controversy.&lt;ref name="obit - Times" /&gt; His statement of belief was offensive to many British Christians, particularly given that he was the son of a clergyman.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt;

In January 1973, he was appointed Vice-Chancellor of the [[University of York]]. He was only the second person to head the university as it had only been established in 1963.&lt;ref name="bio - York"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr Morris Carstairs|url=https://www.york.ac.uk/records-management/archive/history/vcs/#tab-2|website=Vice-Chancellors|publisher=University of York|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1970s were a difficult time to be involved in university leadership in the United Kingdom. The country was [[Early 1980s recession#Recession in the United Kingdom|in recession]] and [[student protests]] were frequent.&lt;ref name="obit - Times" /&gt; He had plans to expand the university both physically and in the number of subjects it taught, but because of the hostile atmosphere he faced these were not achieved during his vice-chancellorship.&lt;ref name="bio - York" /&gt; This experience meant that he never returned to full-time academia after leaving the post in the summer of 1978.&lt;ref name="obit - Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bio - York" /&gt;

==Later life==
Carstairs suffered from [[senile dementia]] in his later years.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt; He withdrew from professional life, and was cared for by his first wife.&lt;ref name="obit - Times" /&gt; He died at his Edinburgh home on 17 April 1991.&lt;ref name="Oxford DNB" /&gt;

'''Niccolò di Bernardo dei Machiavelli''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|æ|k|i|ə|ˈ|v|ɛ|l|i}}, {{IPA-it|nikkoˈlɔ mmakjaˈvɛlli|lang}}; 3 May 1469 – 21 June 1527) was an [[Italians|Italian]] diplomat, politician, historian, philosopher, [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]], writer, playwright and poet of the [[Renaissance]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Niccolo-Machiavelli|title=Niccolo Machiavelli - Italian statesman and writer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/niccol%C3%B2-machiavelli-9392446|title=Niccolò Machiavelli|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/machiave/|title=Niccolò  Machiavelli|last=Machiavelli|first=Niccolò|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has often been called the father of modern [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;Montesquieu (1689–1755) is a rival for this role. {{cite book|author=Mikko Lahtinen|title=Politics and Philosophy: Niccolò Machiavelli and Louis Althusser's Aleatory Materialism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oSywCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115|year=2009|publisher=BRILL|pages=115–16|isbn=9789047429944}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years he was a senior official in the [[Florentine Republic]], with responsibilities in diplomatic and military affairs. He also wrote comedies, carnival songs, and poetry. His personal correspondence is renowned by Italian scholars. He was secretary to the Second [[wikt:chancery|Chancery]] of the Republic of Florence from 1498 to 1512, when the [[Medici]] were out of power. He wrote his most well-known work ''[[The Prince]]'' (''Il Principe'') in 1513, having been exiled from city affairs.

''[[Machiavellianism]]'' is widely used as a negative term to characterize unscrupulous politicians of the sort Machiavelli described most famously in ''The Prince.'' Machiavelli described immoral behavior, such as dishonesty and the killing of innocents, as being normal and effective in politics. He even seemed to encourage it in some situations. The book gained notoriety due to claims that it teaches "evil recommendations to tyrants to help them maintain their power".&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Giorgini, "Five Hundred Years of Italian Scholarship on Machiavelli's Prince," ''Review of Politics'' (2013) 75#4 pp. 625–40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Giorgini |first1=Giovanni |title=Five Hundred Years of Italian Scholarship on Machiavelli's Prince |journal=Review of Politics |date=2013 |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=625–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Machiavellian'' is often associated with political deceit, deviousness, and [[realpolitik]]. On the other hand, many commentators, such as [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Denis Diderot]], have argued that Machiavelli was actually a [[Republicanism|republican]], even when writing ''The Prince'', and his writings were an inspiration to Enlightenment proponents of modern [[Democracy|democratic]] political philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;B. Spinoza, ''Tractatus theologico politicua'', V, 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Diderot |first1=Denis |title=Encyclopedie|accessdate=12 October 2018 |chapter=Machivellianism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.-J. Rousseau, ''Contratto sociale'', III, 6&lt;/ref&gt; In one place, for example, he noted his admiration for the selfless [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[dictator of Rome|dictator]] [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus|Cincinnatus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Heller |first=Agnes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K_kWCgAAQBAJ |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=K_kWCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT415 415] |title=Renaissance Man |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon |year=2015 |isbn=9781317403302 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
{{See also|Timeline of Niccolò Machiavelli}}
[[File:Niccolo Machiavelli.jpg|thumb|''Niccolò Machiavelli'']]
Machiavelli was born in [[Florence]], Italy, the third child and first son of attorney [[Bernardo di Niccolò Machiavelli]] and his wife, Bartolomea di Stefano Nelli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|de Grazia|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Machiavelli family is believed to be descended from the old [[marquesses of Tuscany]] and to have produced thirteen Florentine [[Gonfaloniere of Justice|Gonfalonieres of Justice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Niccolò Machiavelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the offices of a group of nine citizens selected by drawing lots every two months and who formed the government, or [[Signoria of Florence|Signoria]]; but he was never a full citizen of Florence because of the nature of Florentine citizenship in that time even under the republican regime.  Machiavelli married Marietta Corsini in 1502.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Guarini|1999|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Machiavel Offices Florence.jpg|thumb|left|Statue at the [[Uffizi]]]]

Machiavelli was born in a tumultuous era in which popes waged acquisitive wars against Italian [[city-state]]s, and people and cities often fell from power as France, Spain, and  the [[Holy Roman Empire]] battled for regional influence and control. Political-military alliances continually changed, featuring [[condottieri]] (mercenary leaders), who changed sides without warning, and the rise and fall of many short-lived governments.&lt;ref&gt;Maurizio Viroli, ''Niccolò's Smile: A Biography of Machiavelli'' (2000), ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Machiavelli was taught grammar, rhetoric, and Latin. It is thought that he did not learn Greek even though Florence was at the time one of the centers of Greek scholarship in Europe. In 1494 Florence restored the [[Republic of Florence|republic]], expelling the [[Medici]] family that had ruled Florence for some sixty years. Shortly after the execution of [[Savonarola]], Machiavelli was appointed to an office of the second chancery, a medieval writing office that put Machiavelli in charge of the production of official Florentine government documents. Shortly thereafter, he was also made the secretary of the ''Dieci di Libertà e Pace.''

[[File:Cristofano dell'Altissimo Ritratto di Niccolò Machiavelli .jpg|thumb|Oil painting of Niccolò Machiavelli by Cristofano dell'Altissimo]]

In the first decade of the sixteenth century, he carried out several diplomatic missions: most notably to the Papacy in Rome. Moreover, from 1502 to 1503, he witnessed the brutal reality of the state-building methods of [[Cesare Borgia]] (1475–1507) and his father, [[Pope Alexander VI]], who were then engaged in the process of trying to bring a large part of Central Italy under their possession. The pretext of defending Church interests was used as a partial justification by the Borgias. Other excursions to the court of [[Louis XII]] and the Spanish court influenced his writings such as ''The Prince''.

Between 1503 and 1506, Machiavelli was responsible for the Florentine militia. He distrusted mercenaries (a distrust that he explained in his official reports and then later in his theoretical works for their unpatriotic and uninvested nature in the war that makes their allegiance fickle and often too unreliable when most needed) and instead staffed his army with citizens, a policy that was to be repeatedly successful. Under his command, Florentine citizen-soldiers defeated Pisa in 1509.

However, Machiavelli's success did not last. In August 1512 the Medici, backed by [[Pope Julius II]], used Spanish troops to defeat the Florentines at [[Prato]], but many historians have argued that it was due to [[Piero Soderini]]'s unwillingness to compromise with the Medici, who were holding Prato under siege. In the wake of the siege, Soderini resigned as Florentine head of state and left in exile. The experience would, like Machiavelli's time in foreign courts and with the Borgia, heavily influence his political writings.

[[File:Santa Croce Firenze Apr 2008 (20).JPG|thumb|Machiavelli's [[cenotaph]] in the [[Basilica di Santa Croce di Firenze|Santa Croce Church]] in Florence]]

After the Medici victory, the Florentine city-state and the republic were dissolved, and Machiavelli was deprived of office in 1512. In 1513 the Medici accused him of conspiracy against them and had him imprisoned. Despite having been subjected to torture ("[[strappado|with the rope]]" in which the prisoner is hanged from his bound wrists, from the back, forcing the arms to bear the body's weight and dislocating the shoulders), he denied involvement and was released after three weeks.

Machiavelli then retired to his estate at [[Sant'Andrea in Percussina]], near [[San Casciano in Val di Pesa]], and devoted himself to studying and writing of the political treatises that earned his place in the intellectual development of political philosophy and political conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Donno, Daniel, in the introduction to the Bantam Classic edition of ''The Prince'' (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despairing of the opportunity to remain directly involved in political matters, after a time, he began to participate in intellectual groups in Florence and wrote several plays that (unlike his works on political theory) were both popular and widely known in his lifetime. Still, politics remained his main passion and, to satisfy this interest, he maintained a well-known correspondence with more politically connected friends, attempting to become involved once again in political life.&lt;ref&gt;Machiavelli, Niccolò (1996), Machiavelli and his friends: Their personal correspondence, Northern Illinois University Press. Translated and edited by James B. Atkinson and David Sices.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to [[Francesco Vettori]], he described his exile:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When evening comes, I go back home, and go to my study. On the threshold, I take off my work clothes, covered in mud and filth, and I put on the clothes an ambassador would wear. Decently dressed, I enter the ancient courts of rulers who have long since died. There, I am warmly welcomed, and I feed on the only food I find nourishing and was born to savour. I am not ashamed to talk to them and ask them to explain their actions and they, out of kindness, answer me. Four hours go by without my feeling any anxiety. I forget every worry. I am no longer afraid of poverty or frightened of death. I live entirely through them.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Kaplan, "Political Theory: The Classic Texts and their Continuing Relevance," ''The Modern Scholar'' (14 lectures in the series; lecture #7 / disc 4), 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Machiavelli died in 1527 at 58 after receiving his [[last rites]].&lt;ref&gt;"Even such men as Malatesta and Machiavelli, after spending their lives in estrangement from the Church, sought on their death-beds her assistance and consolations. Both made good confessions and received the Holy Viaticum." - Ludwig von Pastor, ''History of the Popes'', Vol. 5, p. 137, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofthepope05pastuoft#page/136/mode/2up]&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at the [[Basilica di Santa Croce di Firenze|Church of Santa Croce]] in Florence. An epitaph honouring him is inscribed on his monument. The Latin legend reads: &lt;small&gt;TANTO NOMINI NULLUM PAR ELOGIUM&lt;/small&gt; ("So great a name (has) no adequate praise" or "No [[eulogy]] (would be) a match for such a great name").

== Originality ==
[[File:Niccolò-Machiavelli-Amelot-de-La-Houssaie-Il-principe MG 1089.tif|thumb|Engraved portrait of Machiavelli, from the Peace Palace Library's ''Il Principe'', published in 1769]]

Commentators have taken very different approaches to Machiavelli and not always agreed. Major discussion has tended to be about two issues: first, how unified and philosophical his work is, and second, concerning how innovative or traditional it is.&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Fischer|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coherence ===
There is some disagreement concerning how best to describe the unifying themes, if there are any, that can be found in Machiavelli's works, especially in the two major political works, ''The Prince'' and ''Discourses''. Some commentators have described him as inconsistent, and perhaps as not even putting a high priority in consistency.&lt;ref name=Fischer/&gt; Others such as [[Hans Baron]] have argued that his ideas must have changed dramatically over time. Some have argued that his conclusions are best understood as a product of his times, experiences and education. Others, such as Leo Strauss and Harvey Mansfield, have argued strongly that there is a very strong and deliberate consistency and distinctness, even arguing that this extends to all of Machiavelli's works including his comedies and letters.&lt;ref name=Fischer/&gt;

=== Influences ===
Commentators such as Leo Strauss have gone so far as to name Machiavelli as the deliberate originator of [[modernity]] itself. Others have argued that Machiavelli is only a particularly interesting example of trends which were happening around him. In any case Machiavelli presented himself at various times as someone reminding Italians of the old virtues of the Romans and Greeks, and other times as someone promoting a completely new approach to politics.&lt;ref name=Fischer/&gt;

That Machiavelli had a wide range of influences is in itself not controversial. Their relative importance is however a subject of on-going discussion. It is possible to summarize some of the main influences emphasized by different commentators.

'''1. The Mirror of Princes genre.''' {{Harvcoltxt|Gilbert|1938}} summarized the similarities between ''The Prince'' and the genre it obviously imitates, the so-called "[[Mirror of Princes]]" style. This was a classically influenced genre, with models at least as far back as [[Xenophon]] and [[Isocrates]].  While Gilbert emphasized the similarities, however, he agreed with all other commentators that Machiavelli was particularly novel in the way he used this genre, even when compared to his contemporaries such as [[Baldassare Castiglione]] and [[Erasmus]]. One of the major innovations Gilbert noted was that Machiavelli focused upon the "deliberate purpose of dealing with a new ruler who will need to establish himself in defiance of custom". Normally, these types of works were addressed only to hereditary princes. (Xenophon is also an exception in this regard.)

'''2. Classical republicanism.''' Commentators such as [[Quentin Skinner]] and [[J.G.A. Pocock]], in the so-called "Cambridge School" of interpretation, have been able to show that some of the republican themes in Machiavelli's political works, particularly the ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'', can be found in medieval Italian literature which was influenced by classical authors such as [[Sallust]].

[[File:Xenophon.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Xenophon]], author of the ''[[Cyropedia]]'']]

'''3. Classical political philosophy: Xenophon, Plato and Aristotle.''' The Socratic school of classical political philosophy, especially [[Aristotle]], had become a major influence upon European political thinking in the late [[Middle Ages]]. It existed both in the Catholicised form presented by [[Thomas Aquinas]], and in the more controversial "[[Averroism|Averroist]]" form of authors like [[Marsilius of Padua]]. Machiavelli was critical of Catholic political thinking and may have been influenced by Averroism. But he cites Plato and Aristotle very infrequently and apparently did not approve of them. [[Leo Strauss]] argued that the strong influence of [[Xenophon]], a student of Socrates more known as an historian, rhetorician and soldier, was a major source of Socratic ideas for Machiavelli, sometimes not in line with Aristotle. While interest in [[Plato]] was increasing in Florence during Machiavelli's lifetime, Machiavelli does not show particular interest in him, but was indirectly influenced by his readings of authors such as [[Polybius]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Cicero]].

The major difference between Machiavelli and the Socratics, according to Strauss, is Machiavelli's materialism, and therefore his rejection of both a teleological view of nature and of the view that philosophy is higher than politics. With their [[teleological]] understanding of things, Socratics [[teleological argument|argued]] that desirable things tend to happen by nature, as if nature desired them, but Machiavelli claimed that such things happen by blind chance or human action.&lt;ref name=Strauss&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''4. Classical materialism.''' Strauss argued that Machiavelli may have seen himself as influenced by some ideas from classical materialists such as [[Democritus]], [[Epicurus]] and [[Lucretius]]. Strauss however sees this also as a sign of major innovation in Machiavelli, because classical materialists did not share the Socratic regard for political life, while Machiavelli clearly did.&lt;ref name=Strauss/&gt;

'''5. Thucydides.'''
Some scholars note the similarity between Machiavelli and the Greek historian [[Thucydides]], since both emphasized [[power politics]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Anthony Rahe, ''Against throne and altar: Machiavelli and political theory under the English Republic'' (2008) p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Donnelly, ''Realism and International Relations'' (2000) p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss argued that Machiavelli may indeed have been influenced by [[pre-Socratic philosophers]], but he felt it was a new combination:-
&lt;blockquote&gt;...contemporary readers are reminded by Machiavelli's teaching of Thucydides; they find in both authors the same "realism," i.e., the same denial of the power of the gods or of justice and the same sensitivity to harsh necessity and elusive chance. Yet Thucydides never calls in question the intrinsic superiority of nobility to baseness, a superiority that shines forth particularly when the noble is destroyed by the base. Therefore Thucydides' History arouses in the reader a sadness which is never aroused by Machiavelli's books. In Machiavelli we find comedies, parodies, and satires but nothing reminding of tragedy. One half of humanity remains outside of his thought. There is no tragedy in Machiavelli because he has no sense of the sacredness of "the common." — {{Harvtxt|Strauss|1958|p=292}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Beliefs ==
Amongst commentators, there are a few consistently made proposals concerning what was most new in Machiavelli's work.

=== Empiricism and realism versus idealism ===
Machiavelli is sometimes seen as the prototype of a modern empirical scientist, building generalizations from experience and historical facts, and emphasizing the uselessness of theorizing with the imagination.&lt;ref name=Fischer/&gt;

{{quote|He emancipated politics from theology and moral philosophy. He undertook to describe simply what rulers actually did and thus anticipated what was later called the scientific spirit in which questions of good and bad are ignored, and the observer attempts to discover only what really happens.|Joshua Kaplan, 2005&lt;ref name=twsC11r44fzf&gt;{{cite news|author=Joshua Kaplan|title=Political Theory: The Classic Texts and their Continuing Relevance|publisher=The Modern Scholar|quote=14 lectures in the series; (lectures #7) – see disc 4|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Machiavelli felt that his early schooling along the lines of a traditional classical education was essentially useless for the purpose of understanding politics. Nevertheless, he advocated intensive study of the past, particularly regarding the founding of a city, which he felt was a key to understanding its later development.&lt;ref name=twsC11r44fzf/&gt; Moreover, he studied the way people lived and aimed to inform leaders how they should rule and even how they themselves should live. For example, Machiavelli denies that living virtuously necessarily leads to happiness. And Machiavelli viewed misery as ''one of the vices that enables a prince to rule.''&lt;ref&gt;Leo Strauss, Joseph Cropsey, ''History of Political Philosophy'' (1987) p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; Machiavelli stated that ''it would be best to be both loved and feared. But since the two rarely come together, anyone compelled to choose will find greater security in being feared than in being loved.''&lt;ref&gt;Niccolò Machiavelli, ''The Prince'', p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; In much of Machiavelli's work, it seems that the ruler must adopt unsavory policies for the sake of the continuance of his regime.

A related and more controversial proposal often made is that he described how to do things in politics in a way which seemed neutral concerning who used the advice—tyrants or good rulers.&lt;ref name=Fischer/&gt; That Machiavelli strove for realism is not doubted, but for four centuries scholars have debated how best to describe his morality. ''The Prince'' made the word "Machiavellian" a byword for deceit, despotism, and political manipulation. Even if Machiavelli was not himself evil, [[Leo Strauss]] declared himself inclined toward the traditional view that Machiavelli was self-consciously a "teacher of evil," since he counsels the princes to avoid the values of justice, mercy, temperance, wisdom, and love of their people in preference to the use of cruelty, violence, fear, and deception.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Strauss, [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0226777022?v=search-inside&amp;keywords=teacher+of+evil ''Thoughts on Machiavelli'' (1957), p. 9 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Italian anti-fascist philosopher [[Benedetto Croce]] (1925) concludes Machiavelli is simply a "realist" or "pragmatist" who accurately states that moral values in reality do not greatly affect the decisions that political leaders make.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetto Croce, [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1406739774?keywords=Benedetto%20Croce%20machiavelli&amp;p=S02H&amp;checkSum=%252FombMxeAC6hIVUToYvbv9hivFP6U3vxoUdbCmtPQco4%253D ''My Philosophy'' (1949), p. 142 online]&lt;/ref&gt; German philosopher [[Ernst Cassirer]] (1946) held that Machiavelli simply adopts the stance of a political scientist—a [[Galileo]] of politics—in distinguishing between the "facts" of political life and the "values" of moral judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Cassirer, [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0300000367?v=search-inside&amp;keywords=machiavelli+galileo ''The Myth of the State,'' (1946) p. 136, online]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Walter Russell Mead]] has argued that ''The Prince''{{'}}s advice presupposes the importance of ideas like [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] in making changes to the political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.the-american-interest.com/stratblog/2011/05/03/when-isms-go-to-war/|title=When Isms go to War|last=Russell Mead|first=Walter|date=May 3, 2011|work=The American Interest|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fortune ===
Machiavelli is generally seen as being critical of Christianity as it existed in his time, specifically its effect upon politics, and also everyday life. In his opinion, Christianity, along with the [[Teleology|teleological]] [[Aristotelianism]] that the church had come to accept, allowed practical decisions to be guided too much by imaginary [[idealism|ideals]] and encouraged people to lazily leave events up to [[Divine Providence|providence]] or, as he would put it, chance, luck or fortune. While Christianity sees modesty as a virtue and pride as sinful, Machiavelli took a more classical position, seeing ambition, spiritedness, and the pursuit of glory as good and natural things, and part of the virtue and prudence that good princes should have. Therefore, while it was traditional to say that leaders should have virtues, especially prudence, Machiavelli's use of the words ''virtù'' and ''prudenza'' was unusual for his time, implying a spirited and immodest ambition. Famously, Machiavelli argued that virtue and prudence can help a man control more of his future, in the place of allowing fortune to do so.

{{Harvcoltxt|Najemy|1993}} has argued that this same approach can be found in Machiavelli's approach to love and desire, as seen in his comedies and correspondence. Najemy shows how Machiavelli's friend Vettori argued against Machiavelli and cited a more traditional understanding of fortune.

On the other hand, [[humanism]] in Machiavelli's time meant that classical pre-Christian ideas about virtue and prudence, including the possibility of trying to control one's future, were not unique to him. But humanists did not go so far as to promote the extra glory of deliberately aiming to establish a new state, in defiance of traditions and laws.

While Machiavelli's approach had classical precedents, it has been argued that it did more than just bring back old ideas and that Machiavelli was not a typical humanist. {{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958}} argues that the way Machiavelli combines classical ideas is new. While Xenophon and Plato also described realistic politics and were closer to Machiavelli than Aristotle was, they, like Aristotle, also saw Philosophy as something higher than politics. Machiavelli was apparently a [[materialist]] who objected to explanations involving [[four causes|formal and final causation]], or [[teleology]].

Machiavelli's promotion of ambition among leaders while denying any higher standard meant that he encouraged risk-taking, and innovation, most famously the founding of new modes and orders. His advice to princes was therefore certainly not limited to discussing how to maintain a state. It has been argued that Machiavelli's promotion of innovation led directly to the argument for [[Progress (history)|progress]] as an aim of [[politics]] and [[civilisation]]. But while a belief that humanity can control its own future, control nature, and "progress" has been long lasting, Machiavelli's followers, starting with his own friend Guicciardini, have tended to prefer peaceful progress through economic development, and not warlike progress. As Harvey {{Harvtxt|Mansfield|1995|p=74}} wrote: "In attempting other, more regular and scientific modes of overcoming fortune, Machiavelli's successors formalised and emasculated his notion of virtue."

Machiavelli however, along with some of his classical predecessors, saw ambition and spiritedness, and therefore war, as inevitable and part of [[human nature]].

Strauss concludes his 1958 ''Thoughts on Machiavelli'' by proposing that this promotion of progress leads directly to the modern [[arms race]]. Strauss argued that the unavoidable nature of such arms races, which have existed before modern times and led to the collapse of peaceful civilisations, provides us with both an explanation of what is most truly dangerous in Machiavelli's innovations, but also the way in which the aims of his apparently immoral innovation can be understood.

===Religion===
Machiavelli explains repeatedly that he saw religion as man-made, and that the value of religion lies in its contribution to social order and the rules of morality must be dispensed with if security requires it. In ''The Prince,'' the ''Discourses,'' and in the ''[[Life of Castruccio Castracani]],'' he describes "prophets", as he calls them, like [[Moses]], [[Romulus]], [[Cyrus the Great]], and [[Theseus]] (he treated pagan and Christian patriarchs in the same way) as the greatest of new princes, the glorious and brutal founders of the most novel innovations in politics, and men whom Machiavelli assures us have always used a large amount of armed force and murder against their own people. He estimated that these sects last from 1,666 to 3,000 years each time, which, as pointed out by Leo Strauss, would mean that Christianity became due to start finishing about 150 years after Machiavelli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Strauss|1987|p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machiavelli's concern with Christianity as a sect was that it makes men weak and inactive, delivering politics into the hands of cruel and wicked men without a fight.&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{Harvtxt|Strauss|1958|p=206}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While fear of [[God]] can be replaced by fear of the prince, if there is a strong enough prince, Machiavelli felt that having a religion is in any case especially essential to keeping a republic in order. For Machiavelli, a truly great prince can never be conventionally religious himself, but he should make his people religious if he can. According to {{Harvtxt|Strauss|1958|pp=226–27}} he was not the first person to ever explain religion in this way, but his description of religion was novel because of the way he integrated this into his general account of princes.

Machiavelli's judgment that democracies need religion for practical political reasons was widespread among modern proponents of republics until approximately the time of the [[French Revolution]]. This therefore represents a point of disagreement between himself and late modernity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Strauss|1958|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive side to factional and individual vice===
Despite the classical precedents, which Machiavelli was not the only one to promote in his time, Machiavelli's realism and willingness to argue that good ends justify bad things, is seen as a critical stimulus towards some of the most important theories of modern politics.

Firstly, particularly in the ''Discourses on Livy,'' Machiavelli is unusual in the positive side he sometimes seems to describe in factionalism in republics. For example, quite early in the ''Discourses,'' (in Book I, chapter 4), a chapter title announces that ''the disunion'' of the [[plebs]] and [[Roman senate|senate]] in Rome ''"kept Rome free."'' That a community has different components whose interests must be balanced in any good regime is an idea with classical precedents, but Machiavelli's particularly extreme presentation is seen as a critical step towards the later political ideas of both a [[division of powers]] or [[Separation of powers#Checks_and_balances|checks and balances]], ideas which lay behind the [[US constitution]], as well as many other modern state constitutions.

Similarly, the modern economic argument for [[capitalism]], and most modern forms of economics, was often stated in the form of "public virtue from private vices." Also in this case, even though there are classical precedents, Machiavelli's insistence on being both realistic and ambitious, not only admitting that vice exists but being willing to risk encouraging it, is a critical step on the path to this insight.

Mansfield however argues that Machiavelli's own aims have not been shared by those he influenced. Machiavelli argued against seeing mere peace and economic growth as worthy aims on their own, if they would lead to what Mansfield calls the "taming of the prince."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Mansfield|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Machiavellian''===
{{See also|Machiavellianism|Machiavellian intelligence}}
[[File:Cesareborgia.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Cesare Borgia]], used as an example of a successful ruler in ''The Prince'']]

Machiavelli is most famous for a short political treatise, ''[[The Prince]]'', written in 1513 but not published until 1532, five years after his death. Although he privately circulated ''The Prince'' among friends, the only theoretical work to be printed in his lifetime was ''[[The Art of War (Machiavelli)|The Art of War]]'', which was about military science. Since the 16th century, generations of politicians remain attracted and repelled by its apparently neutral acceptance, or even positive encouragement, of the immorality of powerful men, described especially in ''The Prince'' but also in his other works.

His works are sometimes even said to have contributed to the modern negative connotations of the words ''politics'' and ''politician'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bireley|1990|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is sometimes thought that it is because of him that ''Old Nick'' became an English term for the [[Devil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Fischer|2000|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; More obviously, the adjective ''Machiavellian'' became a term describing someone or something that is "marked by cunning, duplicity, or bad faith".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Machiavellian|title=Definition of MACHIAVELLIAN|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Machiavellianism]]'' also remains a popular term used in speeches and journalism; while in psychology, it denotes a [[personality type]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/machiavellians-gulling-the-rubes/201509/meet-the-machiavellians|title=Meet the Machiavellians|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;



While Machiavellianism is notable in the works of Machiavelli, Machiavelli's works are complex and he is generally agreed to have been more than just "Machiavellian" himself. For example, J.G.A. {{Harvtxt|Pocock|1975}} saw him as a major source of the republicanism that spread throughout England and North America in the 17th and 18th centuries and Leo {{Harvtxt|Strauss|1958}}, whose view of Machiavelli is quite different in many ways, agreed about Machiavelli's influence on republicanism and argued that even though Machiavelli was a teacher of evil he had a nobility of spirit that led him to advocate ignoble actions. Whatever his intentions, which are still debated today, he has become associated with any proposal where "[[Consequentialism|the end justifies the means]]". For example, Leo {{Harvtxt|Strauss|1958|p=297}} wrote:{{quote|Machiavelli is the only political thinker whose name has come into common use for designating a kind of politics, which exists and will continue to exist independently of his influence, a politics guided exclusively by considerations of expediency, which uses all means, fair or foul, iron or poison, for achieving its ends—its end being the aggrandizement of one's country or fatherland—but also using the fatherland in the service of the self-aggrandizement of the politician or statesman or one's party.}}

==Influence==
To quote Robert Bireley:&lt;ref&gt;Bireley, Robert (1990), ''The Counter Reformation Prince'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...there were in circulation approximately fifteen editions of the ''Prince'' and nineteen of the ''Discourses'' and French translations of each before they were placed on [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|the Index]] of [[Paul IV]] in 1559, a measure which nearly stopped publication in Catholic areas except in France. Three principal writers took the field against Machiavelli between the publication of his works and their condemnation in 1559 and again by the Tridentine Index in 1564. These were the English cardinal [[Reginald Pole]] and the Portuguese bishop [[Jerónimo Osório|Jeronymo Osorio]], both of whom lived for many years in Italy, and the Italian humanist and later bishop, [[Ambrogio Caterino Politi]].}}

Machiavelli's ideas had a profound impact on political leaders throughout the modern west, helped by the new technology of the printing press. During the first generations after Machiavelli, his main influence was in non-Republican governments. Pole reported that ''The Prince'' was spoken of highly by [[Thomas Cromwell]] in England and had influenced [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in his turn towards Protestantism, and in his tactics, for example during the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]].&lt;ref name=BireleyP15&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy was also possessed by the Catholic king and emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Haitsma Mulier|1999|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, after an initially mixed reaction, Machiavelli came to be associated with [[Catherine de' Medici]] and the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]]. As {{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=17}} reports, in the 16th century, Catholic writers "associated Machiavelli with the Protestants, whereas Protestant authors saw him as Italian and Catholic". In fact, he was apparently influencing both Catholic and Protestant kings.&lt;ref&gt;While Bireley focuses on writers in the Catholic countries, {{Harvcoltxt|Haitsma Mulier|1999}} makes the same observation, writing with more of a focus upon the Protestant [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]].&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important early works dedicated to criticism of Machiavelli, especially ''The Prince'', was that of the [[Huguenot]], [[Innocent Gentillet]], whose work commonly referred to as ''Discourse against Machiavelli'' or ''Anti Machiavel'' was published in [[Geneva]] in 1576.&lt;ref&gt;The first English edition was ''A Discourse upon the meanes of wel governing and maintaining in good peace, a Kingdome, or other principalitie'', translated by Simon Patericke.&lt;/ref&gt; He accused Machiavelli of being an atheist and accused politicians of his time by saying that his works were the "Koran of the courtiers", that "he is of no reputation in the court of France which hath not Machiavel's writings at the fingers ends".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theme of Gentillet was more in the spirit of Machiavelli himself: he questioned the effectiveness of immoral strategies (just as Machiavelli had himself done, despite also explaining how they could sometimes work). This became the theme of much future political discourse in Europe during the 17th century. This includes the Catholic [[Counter Reformation]] writers summarised by Bireley: [[Giovanni Botero]], [[Justus Lipsius]], [[Carlo Scribani]], [[Adam Contzen]], [[Pedro de Ribadeneira]], and [[Diego Saavedra Fajardo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors criticized Machiavelli, but also followed him in many ways. They accepted the need for a prince to be concerned with reputation, and even a need for cunning and deceit, but compared to Machiavelli, and like later modernist writers, they emphasized [[Economic growth|economic progress]] much more than the riskier ventures of war. These authors tended to cite [[Tacitus]] as their source for realist political advice, rather than Machiavelli, and this pretense came to be known as "[[Tacitean studies|Tacitism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|pp=223–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Black tacitism" was in support of princely rule, but "red tacitism" arguing the case for republics, more in the original spirit of Machiavelli himself, became increasingly important.

[[File:Francis Bacon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Francis Bacon]] argued the case for what would become [[modern science]] which would be based more upon real experience and experimentation, free from assumptions about metaphysics, and aimed at increasing control of nature. He named Machiavelli as a predecessor.]]
Modern [[materialism|materialist]] philosophy developed in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, starting in the generations after Machiavelli. This philosophy tended to be republican, more in the original spirit of Machiavellian, but as with the Catholic authors Machiavelli's realism and encouragement of using innovation to try to control one's own fortune were more accepted than his emphasis upon war and politics. Not only was innovative economics and politics a result, but also [[modern science]], leading some commentators to say that the 18th century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] involved a "humanitarian" moderating of Machiavellianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kennington|2004}}, {{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of Machiavelli's influence is notable in many important figures in this endeavor, for example [[Jean Bodin|Bodin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=17}}: "Jean Bodin's first comments, found in his ''Method for the Easy Comprehension of History'', published in 1566, were positive."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Bacon]],&lt;ref&gt;Bacon wrote: "We are much beholden to Machiavelli and other writers of that class who openly and unfeignedly declare or describe what men do, and not what they ought to do." {{Citation|title=Of the Advancement of Learning|chapter=II.21.9}}. See {{Harvtxt|Kennington|2004}} Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Algernon Sidney]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}} chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Harrington (author)|Harrington]], [[John Milton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Worden|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spinoza's Political Philosophy|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-political/#IntBac|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=19 March 2011|publisher= Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|year= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[David Hume|Hume]],&lt;ref&gt;Danford "Getting Our Bearings: Machiavelli and Hume" in {{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Gibbon]], and [[Adam Smith]]. Although he was not always mentioned by name as an inspiration, due to his controversy, he is also thought to have been an influence for other major philosophers, such as [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schaefer|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Descartes|Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kennington|2004}}, chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[John Locke|Locke]]&lt;ref&gt;Barnes Smith "The Philosophy of Liberty: Locke's Machiavellian Teaching" in {{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Montesquieu]].&lt;ref&gt;Carrese "The Machiavellian Spirit of Montesquieu's Liberal Republic" in {{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}. Shklar "Montesquieu and the new republicanism" in {{Harvtxt|Bock|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Jean-Jacques Rousseau is associated with very different political ideas, it is important to view Machiavelli's work from different points of view rather than just the traditional notion. For example, Rousseau viewed Machiavelli's work as a satirical piece in which Machiavelli exposes the faults of a one-man rule rather than exalting amorality.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the seventeenth century it was in England that Machiavelli's ideas were most substantially developed and adapted, and that republicanism came once more to life; and out of seventeenth-century English republicanism there were to emerge in the next century not only a theme of English political and historical reflection—of the writings of the [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Bolingbroke]] circle and of [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] and of early parliamentary radicals—but a stimulus to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Scotland, on the Continent, and in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Worden|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:John Adams, Gilbert Stuart, c1800 1815.jpg|thumb|John Adams admired Machiavelli's rational description of the realities of statecraft. Adams used Machiavelli's works to argue for [[mixed government]].]]
Scholars have argued that Machiavelli was a major indirect and direct influence upon the political thinking of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] due to his overwhelming favoritism of [[republicanism]] and the republic type of government. According to John McCormick, it is still very much debatable whether or not Machiavelli was "an advisor of tyranny or partisan of liberty."&lt;ref&gt;John P. McCormick, ''Machiavellian democracy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2011) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[James Madison]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]] followed Machiavelli's republicanism when they opposed what they saw as the emerging aristocracy that they feared [[Alexander Hamilton]] was creating with the [[Federalist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton learned from Machiavelli about the importance of foreign policy for domestic policy, but may have broken from him regarding how rapacious a republic needed to be in order to survive&lt;ref&gt;Walling "Was Alexander Hamilton a Machiavellian Statesman?" in {{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Harper|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Washington]] was less influenced by Machiavelli.&lt;ref&gt;Spalding "The American Prince? George Washington's Anti-Machiavellian moment" in {{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Founding Father who perhaps most studied and valued Machiavelli as a political philosopher was [[John Adams]], who profusely commented on the Italian's thought in his work, ''A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America''.&lt;ref name=thompson&gt;{{Harvtxt|Thompson|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, John Adams praised Machiavelli, with Algernon Sidney and [[Montesquieu]], as a philosophic defender of mixed government. For Adams, Machiavelli restored empirical reason to politics, while his analysis of factions was commendable. Adams likewise agreed with the Florentine that human nature was immutable and driven by passions. He also accepted Machiavelli's belief that all societies were subject to cyclical periods of growth and decay. For Adams, Machiavelli lacked only a clear understanding of the institutions necessary for good government.&lt;ref name=thompson/&gt;

===20th century===
The 20th-century Italian Communist [[Antonio Gramsci]] drew great inspiration from Machiavelli's writings on ethics, morals, and how they relate to the State and revolution in his writings on [[Passive Revolution]], and how a society can be manipulated by controlling popular notions of morality.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Landy, "Culture and Politics in the work of Antonio Gramsci," 167–88, in ''Antonio Gramsci: Intellectuals, Culture, and the Party'', ed. James Martin (New York: Routledge, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival of interest in the comedies===
In the 20th century there was also renewed interest in Machiavelli's ''[[La Mandragola]]'' (1518), which received numerous stagings, including several in New York, at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] in 1976 and the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]] in 1979, as a musical comedy by [[Peer Raben]] in Munich's antiteater in 1971, and at London's [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in 1984.&lt;ref name="Jann Racquoi 1979"&gt;Review by Jann Racquoi, ''Heights/Inwood Press of North Manhattan'', March 14, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Prince''===
{{Main|The Prince}}

Machiavelli's best-known book ''Il Principe'' contains several maxims concerning politics. Instead of the more traditional target audience of a hereditary prince, it concentrates on the possibility of a "new prince". To retain power, the hereditary prince must carefully balance the interests of a variety of institutions to which the people are accustomed. By contrast, a new prince has the more difficult task in ruling: He must first stabilise his newfound power in order to build an enduring political structure. Machiavelli suggests that the social benefits of stability and security can be achieved in the face of moral corruption. Machiavelli believed that public and private morality had to be understood as two different things in order to rule well. As a result, a ruler must be concerned not only with reputation, but also must be positively willing to act immorally at the right times. Machiavelli believed as a ruler, it was better to be widely feared than to be greatly loved; A loved ruler retains authority by obligation while a feared leader rules by fear of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Prince|last=Machiavelli|first=Niccolò|year=1532|isbn=|location=Italy|pages=120–21|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a political theorist, Machiavelli emphasized the occasional need for the methodical exercise of brute force or deceit including extermination of entire noble families to head off any chance of a challenge to the prince's authority.

Scholars often note that Machiavelli glorifies instrumentality in state building, an approach embodied by the saying "[[The ends justify the means]]." This quote has been disputed and may not come from Niccolò Machiavelli or his writings. Violence may be necessary for the successful stabilisation of power and introduction of new legal institutions. Force may be used to eliminate political rivals, to coerce resistant populations, and to purge the community of other men strong enough of a character to rule, who will inevitably attempt to replace the ruler. Machiavelli has become infamous for such political advice, ensuring that he would be remembered in history through the adjective, "Machiavellian".

[[File:Duke-Lorenzo.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Lorenzo II de' Medici|Lorenzo di Piero de' Medici]] to whom the final version of ''The Prince'' was dedicated]]

Notwithstanding some mitigating themes, the [[Catholic Church]] banned ''The Prince'', putting it on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]''. [[humanism|Humanists]] also viewed the book negatively, including [[Erasmus]] of [[Rotterdam]]. As a treatise, its primary intellectual contribution to the history of political thought is the fundamental break between political [[Realism (international relations)|realism]] and political [[idealism]], due to it being a manual on acquiring and keeping political power. In contrast with [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], Machiavelli insisted that an imaginary ideal society is not a model by which a prince should orient himself.

Concerning the differences and similarities in Machiavelli's advice to ruthless and tyrannical princes in ''The Prince'' and his more republican exhortations in ''Discourses on Livy'', many have concluded that ''The Prince'', although written as advice for a monarchical prince, contains arguments for the superiority of republican regimes, similar to those found in the ''Discourses''. In the 18th century, the work was even called a [[satire]], for example by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;''Discourse on Political Economy'': opening pages.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berlin|first=Isaih|title=The Originality of Machiavelli|url=http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/published_works/ac/machiavelli.pdf|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, commentators such as [[Leo Strauss]] and [[Harvey Mansfield]] have agreed that ''The Prince'' can be read as having a deliberate comical irony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Strauss|1958}}, pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other interpretations include for example that of [[Antonio Gramsci]], who argued that Machiavelli's audience for this work was not even the ruling class but the common people because the rulers already knew these methods through their education.

===''Discourses on Livy''===
{{Main|Discourses on Livy}}

The ''Discourses on the First Ten Books of Titus Livy'', published in 1531, written 1517, often referred to simply as the "Discourses" or ''Discorsi'', is nominally a discussion regarding the classical history of early [[Ancient Rome]] although it strays very far from this subject matter and also uses contemporary political examples to illustrate points. Machiavelli presents it as a series of lessons on how a republic ''should'' be started and structured. It is a larger work than ''The Prince'', and while it more openly explains the advantages of republics, it also contains many similar themes. Commentators disagree about how much the two works agree with each other, frequently referring to leaders of democracies as "princes". It includes early versions of the concept of [[Separation of powers#Checks_and_balances|checks and balances]] and asserts the superiority of a republic over a principality. It became one of the central texts of [[republicanism]], and has often been argued to be a superior work to ''The Prince''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pocock|1975|pp=183–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From ''The Discourses'':
* "In fact, when there is combined under the same constitution a prince, a [[nobility]], and the power of the people, then these three powers will watch and keep each other reciprocally in check." Book I, Chapter II
* "Doubtless these means [of attaining power] are cruel and destructive of all civilised life, and neither Christian, nor even human, and should be avoided by everyone. In fact, the life of a private citizen would be preferable to that of a king at the expense of the ruin of so many human beings." Book I, Chapter XXVI
* "Now, in a well-ordered republic, it should never be necessary to resort to extra-constitutional measures. ..." Book I, Chapter XXXIV
* "... the governments of the people are better than those of princes." Book I, Chapter LVIII
* "... if we compare the faults of a people with those of princes, as well as their respective good qualities, we shall find the people vastly superior in all that is good and glorious". Book I, Chapter LVIII
* "For government consists mainly in so keeping your subjects that they shall be neither able nor disposed to injure you. ..." Book II, Chapter XXIII
* "... no prince is ever benefited by making himself hated." Book III, Chapter XIX
* "Let not princes complain of the faults committed by the people subjected to their authority, for they result entirely from their own negligence or bad example." Book III, Chapter XXIX&lt;ref&gt;The Modern Library, New York, 1950, translated by Christian E. Detmold.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being a statesman and political scientist, Machiavelli also translated classical works, and was a playwright (''Clizia'', ''Mandragola''), a poet (''Sonetti'', ''Canzoni'', ''Ottave'', ''Canti carnascialeschi''), and a novelist (''Belfagor arcidiavolo'').

Some of his other work:
* ''[[The First Decade (poem)|Decennale primo]]'' (1506) – a poem in [[terza rima]].
* ''[[Decennale secondo]]'' (1509) – a poem.

===Other works===
''Della Lingua'' (Italian for "Of the Language") (1514), a dialogue about Italy's language is normally attributed to Machiavelli.

Machiavelli's literary executor, Giuliano de' Ricci, also reported having seen that Machiavelli, his grandfather, made a comedy in the style of [[Aristophanes]] which included living Florentines as characters, and to be titled ''Le Maschere''. It has been suggested that due to such things as this and his style of writing to his superiors generally, there was very likely some animosity to Machiavelli even before the return of the Medici.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Godman|1998|p=240}}.

==In popular culture==
[[Christopher Marlowe]]'s play ''[[The Jew of Malta]]'' (ca. 1589) contains a prologue by a character called Machiavel, a [[Seneca the Younger|Senecan]] ghost based on Machiavelli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Students' Academy |title=Literature Help: The Jew of Malta |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=0lBVCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT5 |publisher=[[Lulu.com]] |date=12 November 2014 |page=5 |isbn=9781312671249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://player.fm/series/jew-of-malta-the-by-marlowe-christopher |title=Jew of Malta, The by MARLOWE, Christopher |work=Player FM |year=2016 |access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machiavel expresses the cynical view that power is amoral, saying "I count religion but a childish toy,/And hold there is no sin but ignorance."

It is a brilliant introduction to the people and events that gave us the word 'Machiavellian.'"&lt;ref name="Maclaine" /&gt; Machiavelli appears as an Immortal adversary of [[Duncan MacLeod]] in [[Nancy Holder]]'s 1997 ''[[Highlander (franchise)|Highlander]]'' novel ''The Measure of a Man'', and is a character in [[Michael Scott (Irish author)|Michael Scott]]'s novel series ''[[The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel]]'' (2007–2012). Machiavelli is also one of the main characters in ''[[The Enchantress of Florence]]'' (2008)  by [[Salman Rushdie]], mostly referred to as "Niccolò 'il Macchia", and the central protagonist in the 2012 novel ''The Malice of Fortune'' by Michael Ennis.

Television dramas centering on the early [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]] have also made use of Machiavelli to underscore his influence in early modern political philosophy. Machiavelli has been featured as a supporting character in ''[[The Tudors (TV series)|The Tudors]]'' (2007–2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theanneboleynfiles.com/resources/the-tudors-episode-guide/the-tudors-season-1/the-tudors-season-1-episode-2-simply-henry/ |title=The Tudors Season 1 Episode 2 – Simply Henry |access-date=February 8, 2018 |work=The Anne Boleyn Files}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Lucinda |title=An epic for our times: How Game of Thrones reached highbrow status |url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/arts-and-books/an-epic-for-our-times-how-game-of-thrones-reached-highbrow-status |date=July 25, 2017 |access-date=February 8, 2018 |journal=[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Borgia (TV series)|Borgia]] (2011–2014) and ''[[The Borgias (2011 TV series)|The Borgias]]'' (2011–2013).&lt;ref name=Ashurst&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ashurst |first=Sam |title=The 7 most wildly inaccurate historical dramas on TV |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/feature/a833561/inaccurate-historical-drama/ |date=July 20, 2017 |access-date=February 8, 2018 |journal=[[Digital Spy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machiavelli appears in the popular historical [[video game]]s ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]'' (2009) and ''[[Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood]]'' (2010), in which he is portrayed as a member of the secret society of Assassins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yelegaonkar |first=Dr. Shrikant |title=Western Thinker's in Political Science |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=nQTECQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT131 |publisher=[[Lulu.com]] |page=131 |year=2009 |isbn=9781329082779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly fictionalised version of Machiavelli appears in the [[BBC]] children's TV series ''[[Leonardo (TV series)|Leonardo]]'' (2011–2012),&lt;ref name=Ashurst/&gt; in which he is "Mac", a black streetwise hustler who is best friends with fellow teenagers [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Mona Lisa]], and [[Lorenzo di Medici]]. In the 2013 episode "Ewings Unite!" of the television series ''[[Dallas (2012 TV series)|Dallas]]'', legendary oil baron [[J.R.

The 1967 ''[[The Time Tunnel]]'' episode "The Death Merchant" stars famed character actor [[Malachi Throne]] as Niccolò Machiavelli, who has been time-displaced to the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. The character's personality and behaviour seem to portray Cesare Borgia rather than Machiavelli himself, suggesting that the writers may have confused the two.

Machiavelli is played by [[Damian Lewis]] in the 2013 BBC radio play ''The Prince'' written by [[Jonathan Myerson]]. Together with his defence attorney [[Lucrezia Borgia]] ([[Helen McCrory]]), he presents examples from history to the devil to support his political theories and appeal his sentence in Hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01slm1l|title=BBC Radio 4 – Saturday Drama, The Prince|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical novel ''The City of Man'' (2009) by author Michael Harrington fully portrays the complex personalities of the two main characters—[[Girolamo Savonarola]] and a formative Niccolò Machiavelli—in opposition during the turbulent last decade of 15th century Florence. The portrayal of Machiavelli draws from his later writings and observations of the chaotic events of his youth before rising from obscurity to be appointed as Second Chancellor of the Florentine Republic at the age of twenty-nine, only one month after Savonarola's execution. Major characters include [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], his son Piero, [[Michelangelo]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Pico della Mirandola]], [[Marsilio Ficino]], [[Pope Alexander VI]] (Rodrigo Borgia), [[Cesare Borgia]] (model for The Prince), Piero and Tommaso Soderini, Il Cronaca and the diarist, Luca Landucci.

The American rapper [[Tupac Shakur]] studied Machiavelli while in prison and became greatly influenced by his work.

In the 1993 crime drama ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'', local mob boss Sonny tells his young protege Calogero that while he was doing a 10-year sentence in jail, he passed the time and stayed out of trouble by reading Machiavelli, whom he describes as "a famous writer from 500 years ago"—and then tells him how Machiavelli's philosophy,  including his famous advice about how it is preferable for a leader to be feared rather than loved if he cannot be both—have made him a successful mob boss.

'''Prince Claus of the Netherlands, Jonkheer van Amsberg''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Klaus-Georg Wilhelm Otto Friedrich Gerd von Amsberg''; 6 September 1926 – 6 October 2002), was the husband of [[Queen Beatrix]], and the [[Prince Consort of the Netherlands]] from Beatrix's ascension in 1980 until his death from [[Parkinson's disease]] and heart and respiratory ailments in 2002.&lt;ref name="WP-Obituary"/&gt;

==Biography==

Claus was born '''Klaus-Georg Wilhelm Otto Friedrich Gerd von Amsberg''', on his family's estate, Schloss Dötzingen, near [[Hitzacker]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] on 6 September 1926.&lt;ref name=marlise&gt;{{cite news|last=Simons|first=Marlise|title=Claus von Amsberg, 76, Popular Dutch Prince|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/07/world/claus-von-amsberg-76-popular-dutch-prince.html|accessdate=27 September 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=7 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were [[Claus Felix von Amsberg]] and [[Baroness Gösta von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen]]. His father, a member of the untitled [[German nobility]], operated a large farm in [[Tanganyika]] (formerly [[German East Africa]]) from 1928 until [[World War II]]. From 1938 Claus and his six sisters grew up on their maternal grandparents' manor in [[Lower Saxony]]; he attended the [[Friderico-Francisceum-Gymnasium]] in [[Bad Doberan]] from 1933 to 1936 and a boarding school in Tanganyika from 1936 to 1938.&lt;ref name="Guardian-Obituary"/&gt;

Claus was a member of such [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[youth organisation]]s as [[Deutsches Jungvolk]] and the [[Hitler Youth]] (membership in both was mandatory for all fit members of his generation).&lt;ref name=marlise/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/hitleryouth/hj-prelude.htm Hitler Youth: Prelude to War 1933–1939]. The History Place. Retrieved on 23 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1938 until 1942, he attended the [[Baltenschule Misdroy]].

In 1944, he was conscripted into the German [[Wehrmacht]], becoming a soldier in the German [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Panzergrenadier Division]] in [[Italy]] in March 1945.&lt;ref name="Guardian-Obituary"/&gt; He was taken [[prisoner of war]] by the [[United States|American forces]] at [[Meran]] before taking part in any fighting.&lt;ref name="Guardian-Obituary"/&gt; After his [[repatriation]], he finished school in [[Lüneburg]] and studied [[law]] in [[Hamburg]]. He then joined the German [[diplomatic corps]] and worked in [[Santo Domingo]] and [[Ivory Coast]]. In the 1960s, he was transferred to [[Bonn]].&lt;ref name="WP-Obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2002/10/07/prince-claus-of-netherlands-dies/f6f4271f-bd92-403d-b321-1bf28e91e023/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.b383bc142f6d|title=Prince Claus of Netherlands Dies|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claus met Princess Beatrix for the first time on New Year's Eve 1962 in [[Bad Driburg]] at a dinner hosted by the count von Oeynhausen-Sierstorpff who was a distant relative of both of them. They met again at the wedding-eve party of [[Princess Tatjana of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg]] and [[Moritz, Landgrave of Hesse]], in the summer of 1964. With memories of German oppression still very strong 20 years after the war, sections of the Dutch population were unhappy that Beatrix's fiancé was a German and former member of the [[Hitler Youth]]. Nonetheless, [[Queen Juliana]] gave the engagement her blessing&lt;ref name="Guardian-Obituary"/&gt; after giving serious thought to canceling it. The engagement was approved by the [[States General of the Netherlands|States-General]]—a necessary step for Beatrix to remain heiress to the throne—in 1965. He was granted Dutch citizenship later that year and changed the spellings of his names to Dutch.

The pair were married on 10 March 1966. Their wedding day saw violent protests, most notably by the anarchist-artist group [[Provo (movement)|Provo]].  They included such memorable slogans as "Claus, 'raus!" (Claus, get out!) and "Mijn fiets terug" (Give me back my bike), a reference to the memory of occupying German soldiers confiscating Dutch bicycles. A smoke bomb was thrown at the wedding carriage by a group of Provos.&lt;ref name=marlise/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian-Obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/oct/08/guardianobituaries1|title=Obituary: Prince Claus of the Netherlands|publisher=The Guardian|first=Malu|last=Halasa|date=7 October 2002|accessdate=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, it was thought that Beatrix would be the last monarch of the Netherlands.

However, over time, Claus became accepted by the public, so much so that during the last part of his life he was considered by some to be the most popular member of the [[Dutch Royal Family|Royal Family]].&lt;ref name="Guardian-Obituary"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.rtl.nl/(/actueel/rtlnieuws/binnenland/)/components/actueel/rtlnieuws/12_december/13/binnenland/maxima.xml Máxima en Claus populairste Oranje-leden]&lt;/ref&gt; This change in Dutch opinion was brought about by Claus's strong motivation to contribute to public causes (especially [[Third World]] development, on which he was considered an expert), his sincere modesty and his candor (within but sometimes on the edge of royal protocol).

The public also sympathised with Claus for his efforts to give meaning to his life beyond the restrictions that Dutch law imposed on the Royal Family's freedom of speech and action. However, these restrictions were gradually loosened; Claus was even appointed as senior staff member at the [[Department of Developing Aid]], albeit in an advisory role.

One example of his attitude toward protocol was the "Declaration of the Tie". In 1998, after presenting the annual [[Prince Claus Awards]] to three [[Africa]]n [[fashion design]]ers, Claus told "workers of all nations to unite and cast away the new shackles they have voluntarily cast upon themselves", meaning the [[necktie]], that "snake around my neck,"&lt;ref name=marlise/&gt; and encouraged the audience to "venture into open-[[collar (clothing)|collar]] [[paradise]]". He then removed his tie and threw it on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://nos.nl/video/47116-prins-claus-wars-van-protocol-2002.html Claus' speech in which he removes his tie, among other video fragments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112084738/http://nos.nl/video/47116-prins-claus-wars-van-protocol-2002.html |date=12 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claus battled depression for a number of years, and underwent a surgery in 1998 to remove his prostate. In 2001, he underwent another surgery to remove one of his kidneys. He eventually died on 6 October 2002 from Parkinson's disease and heart failure.&lt;ref name="WP-Obituary"/&gt;

====Academic awards====
*Honorary Doctor of the [[International Institute of Social Studies]] (1988)

Prince Claus was also appointed Honorary Fellow of the International Institute of Social Studies (ISS) in 1988. Prince Claus was held in very high esteem in the international development cooperation community, partly because of his considerable insight and understanding of the problems involved, and partly because of his exceptional gift for expressing the hopes and anxieties felt by all.

'''Ram Chandra Chatterjee''' ( - 9 August 1892) was an Indian [[Acrobatics|acrobat]], [[Gymnastics|gymnast]], [[balloonist]], [[parachutist]] and [[Patriotism|patriot]]. He was the first Indian to fly in a balloon&lt;ref name="khandurie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Khandurie|first=Vijaya|title=366 Days of Science &amp; Technology|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5qmbAwAAQBAJ|accessdate=5 September 2015|publisher=Rupa Publications|isbn=9788129125811|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhattacherje|first=S.B.|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Events &amp; Dates|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=oGVSvXuCsyUC|accessdate=5 September 2015|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Sterling Publishers|isbn=9788120740747|page=B31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and land in a parachute. He was also the first Indian to take up ballooning as a profession. His daring acts with the balloon and the parachute made him a national hero.

== Early life ==
Ram Chandra Chatterjee was a resident of Kansaripara, in the locality of Shimulia in North Kolkata. He started his career as an acrobat in the National Circus Company of [[Nabagopal Mitra]], the founder of [[Hindu Mela]]. He was a flying [[trapeze]] player. Later he became the director of Great United Indian Circus Company. He also worked as teacher of gymnastics in the Government Normal School.

== Interest in ballooning ==
[[File:Advertisement in the Bengalee.png|thumb|right|Advertisement of Chatterjee's first solo flight in The Bengalee]]
When [[Percival G. Spencer]], a British balloonist arrived in Kolkata for his show, Chatterjee requested him to teach the art of ballooning. Spencer complied and Chatterjee had to pay him five hundred rupees for that.

=== First flight ===
He took the first flight with Percival Spencer on 10 April 1889, in the balloon named 'The Viceroy' from the grounds of the Oriental Gas Company in Narkeldanga.&lt;ref name="khandurie"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ijhs&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ghosh|first=Amitabha|date=10 February 1992|title=The First Indian Aeronaut|url=http://www.new1.dli.ernet.in/data1/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b5a_291.pdf|journal=Indian Journal of History of Science|publisher=Indian National Science Academy|volume=27|issue=3|pages=291–308|access-date=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/3544148|title=The Coats Niven Memorial|date=7 July 2013|work=geograph|publisher=Geograph Project Limited|accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Viceroy was filled with 20,000 cu.ft. of coal gas from a 6-inch gas main under the supervision of D. Coats Niven, the director of the gas company. The balloon took off at 3-30 PM and after an hour's journey they descended at the village of Palpakira-Kazipara, three miles away from [[Barasat]].

The flight was reported in all the local newspapers and he was heralded as the first Indian aeronaut. Chatterjee was sponsored by Gopal Chandra Mukherjee, the maternal grandson of [[Jatindramohan Tagore]], the landlord of [[Pathuriaghata]] and M. Mullick. After the successful flight Chatterjee announced his intention to run a balloon of his own and to make an extensive tour of India.

=== First solo flight ===
Thereafter, Chatterjee purchased 'The Viceroy' from Spencer and christened it 'The City of Calcutta'. He also floated the Calcutta Balloonists Company and announced his intention to make the first solo ascent on 27 April 1889.&lt;ref name=bengalee&gt;{{cite news|work=The Bengalee|date=27 April 1889}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to bad weather the flight was postponed till 4 May. A week later arrived the D-Day. A capacity crowd of 8,000 gathered to witness the spectacular event at the gas works grounds in Narkeldanga. J. Reid, the assistant manager of the gas company supervised the filling of the balloon. Clad in a light suit, with a binocular around his neck Chatterjee waved his cap as the balloon took off at 5-10 PM. After flying for 40 minutes in the northerly direction, he descended at Natagore, a village two miles from [[Sodepur]]. The account of the trip was published in The Bengalee on 11 May.&lt;ref name="Gupta"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gupta|first1=Abhijit|title=First Solo Balloon Flier|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1100808/jsp/calcutta/story_12786160.jsp|accessdate=6 November 2016|newspaper=The Telegraph|issue=Kolkata|date=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional ballooning ==
Very soon, Chatterjee decided to embark upon the career of a professional balloonist and launched the Chatterjee's Ballooning Company for the purpose. He made himself open to engagements at any place where gas was available. He intended to visit Allahabad, Lahore, Jaipur, Lucknow, Dhaka and Kashmir.

=== Second solo flight ===
On 27 June 1889, Chatterjee made his second solo ascent in 'The City of Calcutta' from [[Khusrobagh]] in [[Allahabad]]. A capacity crowd of 10,000 had gathered to witness the spectacular event. But due to insufficient filling or poor quality of the gas, the balloon failed to take off, even when all the ballasts were completely removed from the basket. As a true professional, he decided not to dishearten the crowd. He, therefore, detached the basket and clung to the steel hoof and made the ascent. It was a daring act, as without the basket the descent was extremely treacherous, but with his courage and pluck he was able to land with ease.

=== First parachute descent ===
On 22 March 1890, Chatterjee set off in 'The Empress of India', fitted with a parachute from the Tivoli Gardens, near Minto Park in Kolkata at 5-30PM. And then arrived the moment he made history, when he leaped from an altitude of 3,500&amp;nbsp;ft and landed by parachute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhattacherje|first=S.B.|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Events &amp; Dates|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=oGVSvXuCsyUC|accessdate=5 September 2015|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Sterling Publishers|isbn=9788120740747|page=A160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was attended by His Excellency, the Amban, the Chinese Ambassador, Percival Spencer, [[Abanindranath Tagore]] and Yogindranath Sarkar. After the successful descent in a parachute, Chatterjee was given a public reception.

=== Tour of India ===

The City of Calcutta was not meant for parachuting and Chatterjee therefore procured one for the purpose. He renamed it 'Star of India'.

In November 1890, he made an ascent from Tis Hazari in [[Delhi]] and descended in the parachute, which earned him a prestigious reward from Nawab Jalal-ud-Dowlah Muhammad Mumtiaz Ali Khan. He repeated his feat on 8 March 1891 in [[Lahore]] and then in [[Rawalpindi]]. At his next stop in [[Indore]] he performed his feat on November, 1891 at the request of the Maharaja of Indore in presence of the Viceroy. He followed it up in [[Agra]] in February 1892 and [[Varanasi]] in April 1892.

=== Fatal accident ===

He met with a serious accident while performing the show in a native state, when his balloon collided with a hill. He was rushed to Kolkata, where he died in Gopal Chandra Mukherjee's garden house on 9 August 1892.

== Legacy ==

Chatterjee's remarkable feats inspired his compatriots into embracing the new adventure game. Prabodh Chandra Laha ascended the sky alongside Spencer in 'The City of York' on 15 February 1890 from Kolkata. He followed it up with a solo ascent on 8 March in 'The Viceroy of India' which he subsequently purchased from Spencer. Laha made another successful attempt from Kanpur in March 1892.

The third Indian balloonist happened to be Jogesh Chandra Chaudhuri, the famous barrister, professor at the Metropolitan College and son-in-law of [[Surendranath Banerjee]]. He was the first Indian to make an ascent for scientific purposes.

Major Harry Hobbs, a long-time resident of Kolkata has mentioned in his memoirs that Ram Chandra Chatterjee's daughter was also as plucky as her father and she also flew balloons several times.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

'''Saddam Beach''' is a [[fishing village]] in the [[Malappuram district]] of the [[India]]n state of [[Kerala]]. The village is made up of a two kilometre (1¼&amp;nbsp;mi) coastal belt between Puthenkadapuram and Kettungal in [[Parappanangadi]]. The village is named after former Iraqi president [[Saddam Hussein]], in an act of solidarity during the 1991 [[Gulf War]]. The beach name was suggested by Indian maids working in the gulf, especially Kuwait.

==Etymology==
The village used to be called '''Tipu Sultan Beach''' after the [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] king [[Tippu Sultan]] who took an aggressive stance against the [[British Raj|British]] colonial forces during the late 18th century.&lt;ref name=IBN&gt;[http://www.ibnlive.com/news/saddam-has-his-own-beach-in-kerala/9006-3.html Saddam has his own Beach in Kerala]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Gulf War]] of 1991, the villagers have decided to rename the village to its present name, expressing solidarity with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. The villagers, mostly [[Muslim]], claim to be inspired by "Saddam and his fight against policies of the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="rediff"&gt;[http://in.rediff.com/election/2006/apr/26pkerala.htm Saddam a hero in Kerala village]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==
The coastal hamlet that is now Saddam Beach shot into prominence when it was renamed after the Iraqi leader. The villagers of the region have since been particularly vocal about their admiration of Saddam and his 'anti-imperialist' stance.&lt;ref name="rediff"/&gt; The [[United States]]-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] was received with much condemnation. In 2003, expressing anguish over the renaming of "Saddam International Airport" to "[[Baghdad International Airport]]", some Saddam fans raised a large signpost on the beach with the message "Welcome to Saddam Beach".&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/2003/12/18/stories/2003121804300500.htm | title=Pall of gloom on Saddam Beach | date=18 December 2003 | newspaper=The Hindu | accessdate=3 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2003 Gulf War==
During the course of the [[2003 invasion of Baghdad|invasion of Baghdad]], the village witnessed many anti-American and anti-British demonstrations. Goods made in these countries were generally boycotted and even thrown into the sea. Many of the villagers who had work in Gulf countries were forced to return to Saddam Beach as their jobs were lost due to the aftereffects of the Gulf War, further increasing animosity to the West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabnews.com/?page=4&amp;section=0&amp;article=36533&amp;d=16&amp;m=12&amp;y=2003 ‘Saddam Beach’ in Sour Mood]&lt;/ref&gt; Large cut-outs and posters of Saddam, along with Iraqi flags were erected along the roadside by the locals, marking their protest.&lt;ref name="rediff"/&gt;

In November 2006, villagers reacted to the [[Trial of Saddam Hussein|death sentence]] of Saddam Hussein by staging a protest rally, mouthing slogans against American President [[George W. Bush]]. Around fifty people, including women and children, participated in the march.&lt;ref name="NIE"&gt;[http://www.newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?ID=IER20061105115825&amp;Topic=-471&amp;Title=Kerala&amp;Page=R Saddam Beach’ shocked over death sentence]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saddam supporters==
On 30 December 2006, angry supporters of Saddam Hussein gathered at the  beach, and shouted slogans denouncing US President George W. Bush, describing the [[execution of Saddam Hussein]] as "cruel"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiaenews.com/india/20061230/34158.htm Disappointment, condemnation in India over Saddam hanging]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Saddam Beach village is a predominantly Muslim populated area.  Hindus exist in comparatively smaller numbers.  So the culture of the locality is based upon Muslim traditions.  [[Duff muttu|Duff Muttu]], [[Kolkali]] and [[Aravana]]muttu are common folk arts of this locality.  There are many libraries attached to mosques giving a rich source of Islamic studies.  Most of the books are written in [[Arabi Malayalam|Arabi-Malayalam]] which is a version of the [[Malayalam]] language written in [[Arabic script]].  People gather in mosques for the evening prayer and continue to sit there after the prayers discussing social and cultural issues.  Business and family issues are also sorted out during these evening meetings.  The Hindu minority of this area keeps their rich traditions by celebrating various festivals in their temples.  Hindu rituals are done here with a regular devotion like other parts of Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.malappuram.net/art-and-culture.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401052519/http://malappuram.net/art-and-culture.htm |archivedate=2016-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
Saddam Beach village connects to other parts of India through [[Parappanangadi]] town.  National highway No.66 passes through [[Ramanattukara]] and the northern stretch connects to [[Goa]] and [[Mumbai]].  The southern stretch connects to [[Cochin]] and [[Trivandrum]].

Khan and his siblings grew up in a three-bedroom [[council flat]] on the Henry Prince Estate in [[Earlsfield]].{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=15}} He attended Fircroft Primary School and then [[Ernest Bevin College|Ernest Bevin School]], a local [[comprehensive school|comprehensive]].{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=15}} Khan studied science and mathematics at [[A-level]], in the hope of eventually becoming a dentist. A teacher recommended that he read law instead, as he had an argumentative personality. The teacher's suggestion, along with the American television programme ''[[L.A. Law]]'', inspired Khan to do so. He read Law at the [[University of North London]] (now [[London Metropolitan University]]).&lt;ref name="pugilist"/&gt; His parents later moved out of their council flat and purchased their own home.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=15}} Like his brothers, Khan was a fan of sport, particularly enjoying football, cricket, and boxing.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=15}}

From his earliest years, Khan worked: "I was surrounded by my mum and dad working all the time, so as soon as I could get a job, I got a job. I got a paper round, a Saturday job—some summers I laboured on a building site."&lt;ref name="pugilist"/&gt; The family continues to send money to relatives in Pakistan, "because we're blessed being in this country." He and his family often encountered racism..., which led to him and his brothers taking up boxing at the Earlsfield Amateur Boxing Club.&lt;ref name="pugilist"/&gt; While studying for his degree, between the ages of 18 and 21, he had a Saturday job at the [[Peter Jones (department store)|Peter Jones]] department store in [[Sloane Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cooper |first=Goolistan |title=Sadiq Khan recounts life lessons learned working at Chelsea department store |date=1 February 2016 |website=GetWestLondon |url=http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/news/west-london-news/sadiq-khan-recounts-life-lessons-10811540 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602221552/http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/news/west-london-news/sadiq-khan-recounts-life-lessons-10811540 |archivedate=2 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal career==
Before entering the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in 2005, Khan practised as a solicitor.&lt;ref name=Grauniard31May15/&gt;

==Parliamentary career==
===First term: 2005–2010===

[[File:Sadiq Khan, September 2009 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Sadiq Khan in 2009]]
Before entering Parliament, Khan represented [[Tooting]] as a Councillor for the [[London Borough of Wandsworth]] from 1994 to 2006, and was granted the title of [[Title of honor|Honorary]] [[Alderman]] of [[Wandsworth]] upon his retirement from local politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/sadiq-aman-khan http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/sadiq-aman-khan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604043218/http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/sadiq-aman-khan |date=4 June 2016 }}, politics&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Tooting (UK Parliament constituency)|Tooting]] [[Constituency Labour Party]] decided to open its parliamentary selection to all interested candidates, including the incumbent MP since 1974, [[Tom Cox (politician)|Tom Cox]]. This prompted Cox, then in his mid-70s, to announce his retirement rather than risk de-selection. In the subsequent selection contest, Khan defeated five other local candidates to become Labour's candidate for the seat. He was elected to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]].

Khan was one of the Labour MPs who led the successful opposition to Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]'s proposed introduction of 90 days' detention without charge for those suspected of terrorism offences.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=20}} In recognition of this, ''[[The Spectator]]''—a right-wing magazine then edited by [[Boris Johnson]]—awarded him the "Newcomer of the Year Award" at the 2005 Parliamentarian of the Year Awards.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=20}} The magazine's editorial board stated that he had received the award "for the tough-mindedness and clarity with which he has spoken about the very difficult issues of Islamic terror".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/archive/features/14489/part_2/parliamentarian-of-the-year.thtml?SelectedIssueDate=19%20November%202005 |date=19 November 2005 |title=Parliamentarian of the Year |work=[[The Spectator]] |accessdate=27 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616124012/http://www.spectator.co.uk/archive/features/14489/part_2/parliamentarian-of-the-year.thtml?SelectedIssueDate=19%20November%202005 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=16 June 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006, he was a signatory of an open letter to [[Tony Blair]] that was signed by prominent Muslims and published in ''[[The Guardian]]''. The letter criticised [[Foreign policy of the United Kingdom|UK foreign policy]] and in particular the 2003 invasion of Iraq, stating that Blair's policies had caused great harm to civilians in the Middle East and provided "ammunition to extremists who threaten us all".{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=27}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minister criticises Muslim letter |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4787119.stm |date=12 August 2006 |accessdate=27 March 2009 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |archivedate=8 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108143352/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4787119.stm |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khan had to repay £500 in [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|expenses]] in 2007 in relation to a newsletter sent to constituents featuring a 'Labour rose', which was deemed to be unduly prominent. While the content of the newsletter was not deemed to be party political, the rose logo was found to be unduly prominent which may have had the effect of promoting a political party. There was no suggestion that Khan had deliberately or dishonestly compiled his [[Expense management|expenses claims]], which were not explicitly disallowed under the rules at that time. The rules were retrospectively changed disallowing the claim, which had previously been approved by the House of Commons authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmstnprv/182/182.pdf|title=Microsoft Word – Baker-Bruce-Khan – CRC Rep.doc|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|accessdate=7 June 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013064730/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmstnprv/182/182.pdf|archivedate=13 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7142779.stm |title=Minister's rose emblem broke rule |publisher=BBC News |date=13 December 2007 |accessdate=15 December 2010 |deadurl=no |archivedate=17 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017175350/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7142779.stm |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Home Secretary, [[Jacqui Smith]], then announced a further policy review and said the bugging of discussions between MPs and their constituents should be banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/22/uksecurity.police?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=uknews |title=Bugging of MP on prison visit did not break the rules, inquiry finds |first=Vikram |last=Dodd |date=22 February 2008 |accessdate=4 July 2009 |location=London |newspaper=The Guardian |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831203539/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/feb/22/uksecurity.police?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=uknews |archivedate=31 August 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, Blair stood down as both Prime Minister and Labour Party leader, to be replaced by [[Gordon Brown]]. Brown thought highly of Khan, who moved up the parliamentary ranks under Brown's Premiership.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=27}} Brown made Khan a party whip, who was therefore charged with ensuring that Labour-sponsored legislation successfully made it through the parliamentary process to become law.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=27}} In July 2008, Khan helped push through a government proposal to permit the detention of those suspected of terror offenses for 42 days without charge.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=27}} For his part in this, Khan was criticised by Liberty's [[Shami Chakrabarti]] and others, who claimed that Khan had contravened his principles on civil liberties issues.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=27}}

In 2008, the [[Fabian Society]] published Khan's book, ''Fairness Not Favours''. In this work, Khan argued that the Labour Party had to reconnect with British Muslims, arguing that it had lost the trust of this community as a result of the [[Iraq War]].{{sfn|Hill|2016|pp=27–28}} He also said that British Muslims had their own part to play in reconnecting with politicians, arguing that they needed to rid themselves of a [[victim mentality]] and take greater responsibility for their own community.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=28}} In the House of Commons in January 2009, Khan criticised [[Pope Benedict XVI]] for the rehabilitation of [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Bishop Richard Williamson]] following his remarks about [[the Holocaust]], a move he described as "highly unsavoury" and of "great concern".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prince |first=Rosa |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/4388359/Minister-criticises-Pope-for-pardoning-Holocaust-denial-bishop.html |title=Minister criticises Pope for pardoning Holocaust denial bishop |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=29 January 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114024511/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/4388359/Minister-criticises-Pope-for-pardoning-Holocaust-denial-bishop.html |archivedate=14 November 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Labour's defeat at the 2015 general election, Khan resigned from the Shadow Cabinet.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=35}} He then announced himself as a candidate to be the Labour nominee for the London Mayoral elections of 2016: his rivals in this were [[Diane Abbott]], [[Christian Wolmar]], [[Gareth Thomas (English politician)|Gareth Thomas]], [[David Lammy]], and [[Tessa Jowell]].{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=35}} Jowell, who had been an MP for 23 years and had led London's successful nomination to host the [[2012 Olympic Games]], was widely regarded as the favourite to win by bookmakers and opinion polls.{{sfn|Hill|2016|pp=35–36}} Khan soon gained the support of prominent figures in the party, including former Mayor of London [[Ken Livingstone]], who was on Labour's leftist, socialist wing, and [[Oona King]], who was on its centrist, [[Blairism|Blairite]] wing.{{sfn|Hill|2016|pp=37–39}}  He also received the backing of the Labour-affiliated [[GMB (trade union)|GMB]] and [[Unite the Union|Unite]] unions,{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=40}} and the nomination of 44 of Labour's 73 parliamentary constituent parties in London, leaving him as one of the top two contenders alongside Jowell.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=40}}

Khan's main rival was Conservative candidate [[Zac Goldsmith]]; Khan described him as a spoiled dilettante who "never finishes anything he starts".{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=103}} A [[YouGov]] poll for [[LBC]] suggested that while Jowell would defeat Goldsmith in a Mayoral election, Khan would not.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=62}}
In hustings, Khan placed an emphasis on his working-class origins, which would play against Jowell's wealthier upbringing, and argued for the need for change in London, thereby insinuating that Jowell would represent too much continuity with the outgoing Johnson administration.{{sfn|Hill|2016|pp=42–43}} In September 2015, Khan was announced as the winning nominee.{{sfn|Hill|2016|pp=73–74}} He gained 48,152 votes (58.9%) against Jowell's 35,573 (41.1%).{{sfn|Hill|2016|pp=73–74}}&lt;ref name="Lab elects"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wintour|first1=Patrick|title=Sadiq Khan elected as Labour's candidate for mayor of Londo|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/11/sadiq-khan-elected-as-labours-candidate-for-mayor-of-london|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911222641/http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/11/sadiq-khan-elected-as-labours-candidate-for-mayor-of-london|archivedate=11 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the favourite candidate in all three voting categories; Labour Party members, members of affiliated trade unions and organisations, and registered supporters who had paid £3 in order to vote.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=74}}

Khan vowed that if elected, he would freeze public transport fares in London for four years.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=103}}&lt;ref name="Evening Standard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sadiq Khan pledges four-year freeze of all fares if elected Mayor|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/mayor/sadiq-khan-pledges-fouryear-freeze-of-all-fares-if-elected-mayor-a3111856.html|work=London Evening Standard|accessdate=11 November 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115173321/http://www.standard.co.uk/news/mayor/sadiq-khan-pledges-fouryear-freeze-of-all-fares-if-elected-mayor-a3111856.html|archivedate=15 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that this would deprive [[Transport for London]] (TfL) of £452 million, but TfL stated that it would deprive them of £1.9 billion, taking into account projected population growth over this period.{{sfn|Hill|2016|pp=127–128}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35443206|title=Sadiq Khan's fare freeze would cost £1.9bn, says TfL|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=6 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408090139/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35443206|archivedate=8 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he had previously backed Heathrow expansion, he now opposed it, instead calling for expansion at [[Gatwick Airport]]; he was likely aware that supporting the former was a vote loser in London.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=47}} Aware of the severe housing shortage in London, he also spoke of clamping down on foreign property investors,{{sfn|Hill|2016|pp=52–53}} and proposed the establishment of both a "London living rent" tenure and a not-for-profit lettings agency that could undercut commercial operators in order to ease the high cost of renting in the city.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=53}} He also called for house building on land owned by TfL, insisting that at least 50% of those constructed should be "genuinely affordable".{{sfn|Hill|2016|pp=131–133}}

The YouGov poll had revealed that 31% of Londoners stated that they would not be "comfortable" with a Muslim mayor.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=62}} Aware that many voters were suspicious regarding the loyalties of British Muslims to the British state, Khan emphasised his commitment to liberal social values.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=82}} As part of this, he declared his opposition to [[homophobia]],{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=83}} and said that he would have "zero tolerance for anti-Semitism".{{sfn|Hill|2016|pp=82–83}} He openly condemned Islamic extremism and called on the Muslim community to take a leading role in combating it, although at the same time acknowledged the [[Islamophobia]] that many British Muslims faced.{{sfn|Hill|2016|pp=94–95}} He also distanced himself from Corbyn,{{sfn|Hill|2016|pp=81–82}} rebuking Labour's socialist leader for his links to armed anti-Israel groups,{{sfn|Hill|2016|pp=79–80}} and criticising him for not singing the [[God Save the Queen|national anthem]] at an event commemorating the [[Battle of Britain]].{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=79}} Concerned that Corbyn's socialist platform was alienating many of London's businesses, Khan declared that he would be "the most pro-business mayor ever",{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=84}} and met with groups like the [[Federation of Small Businesses]] and [[City of London Corporation]].{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=109}} He also ensured that his campaign was run entirely separate from Corbyn.{{sfn|Hill|2016|pp=116–117}}

Conversely, Goldsmith's Conservative campaign—which was orchestrated by [[Lynton Crosby]]'s company{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=98}}—emphasised connections between Khan and Corbyn.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=98}} Both the Conservative campaign and several Conservative-aligned newspapers sought to tar Khan as an apologist for, or even sympathiser with, Islamic extremism.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=93}} Goldsmith's campaign material referred to Khan as "radical and divisive",{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=98}} while comments on the Conservatives' [[Facebook]] campaign material often displayed anti-Muslim sentiment.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=101}} Labour accused Goldsmith's campaign of using rhetoric that was a "dog-whistle" to Islamophobia,{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=98}} while the Conservatives responded that it was "utterly predictable that Labour label their opponents as racists", citing the fact that during the 2008 mayoral campaign, the party had also accused Johnson of employing racist rhetoric.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=99}} Goldsmith claimed that his references to Khan's "radical" views referred to connections with Corbyn rather than to any connection with Islamic extremism, adding that Khan was playing "[[Race card|the race card]]".{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=106}}

Although describing him as a "principled Labour man", Khan said that Corbyn had failed to gain popularity with the electorate and that Labour would not win a general election under Corbyn's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Syal |first=Rajeev |title=Jeremy Corbyn supporters dismiss Sadiq Khan's criticisms |work=The Guardian |date=21 August 2016 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/21/jeremy-corbyn-supporters-dismiss-sadiq-khan-criticisms-labour |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161214112850/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/21/jeremy-corbyn-supporters-dismiss-sadiq-khan-criticisms-labour |archivedate=14 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transport and housing policies====
On transport, Khan immediately announced the introduction of a "Hopper" bus ticket which would allow a passenger to take two bus journeys within an hour for the price of one; it was intended to benefit those on low incomes most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Crerar |first=Pippa |title=Sadiq Khan confirms new £1.50 one-hour 'hopper' London bus ticket |website=London Evening Standard |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/sadiq-khan-confirms-150-onehour-hopper-london-bus-ticket-a3244331.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614225833/http://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/sadiq-khan-confirms-150-onehour-hopper-london-bus-ticket-a3244331.html |archivedate=14 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Khan announced that his electoral pledge to prevent transport fare rises would only apply to "single fares" and [[Pay-as-you-go tax|pay as you go]] fares, and not daily, monthly, weekly, or yearly railcards; he was widely criticised for this, including by the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[Caroline Pidgeon]], who accused him of having broken his promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Speed |first=Barbara |date=9 June 2016 |website=New Statesman |title=Has Sadiq Khan already broken his promise of a fares freeze? |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/devolution/2016/06/has-sadiq-khan-already-broken-his-promise-fares-freeze |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701231809/http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/devolution/2016/06/has-sadiq-khan-already-broken-his-promise-fares-freeze |archivedate=1 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cowburn |first=Ashley |title=Sadiq Khan accused of breaking flagstone electoral promise to freeze London transport fares |date=8 June 2016 |website=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/sadiq-khan-accused-of-breaking-election-promise-to-freeze-london-transport-fares-a7070496.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231063433/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/sadiq-khan-accused-of-breaking-election-promise-to-freeze-london-transport-fares-a7070496.html |archivedate=31 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016 he ordered TfL to ban any advertising on its network that was deemed to engage in [[Anti-fat bias|body shaming]] and the demeaning of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Kayleigh |date=13 June 2016 |title=Body-shaming adverts to be banned on London transport by Sadiq Khan |website=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/body-shaming-adverts-banned-london-transport-tube-sadiq-khan-a7079591.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923231647/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/body-shaming-adverts-banned-london-transport-tube-sadiq-khan-a7079591.html |archivedate=23 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July he urged the government to allow TfL to take control of the failing [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]] rail service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnston |first=Chris |date=20 July 2016 |website=The Guardian |title=Sadiq Khan seeks Transport for London takeover of Southern |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/20/sadiq-khan-southern-rail-transport-for-london-takeover |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725181438/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/20/sadiq-khan-southern-rail-transport-for-london-takeover |archivedate=25 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mortimer |first=Caroline |title=Sadiq Khan says Southern Rail should be placed under Tfl control after months of commuter misery |date=20 July 2016 |website=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/sadiq-khan-southern-rail-commuter-train-cancelled-chaos-strike-rmt-gtr-a7147111.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820194707/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/sadiq-khan-southern-rail-commuter-train-cancelled-chaos-strike-rmt-gtr-a7147111.html |archivedate=20 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in August launched the 24-hour Underground service on Fridays and Saturdays, an idea initially proposed by Johnson two years previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Weaver |first=Matthew |title=Sadiq Khan to launch London's night tube service |work=The Guardian |date=19 August 2016 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/19/sadiq-khan-launch-london-night-tube-service |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829124935/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/19/sadiq-khan-launch-london-night-tube-service |archivedate=29 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first weeks as Mayor, Khan criticised foreign investors for treating homes in London as "gold bricks for investment", instead urging them to invest in the construction of "affordable homes" for Londoners through a new agency, Homes for Londoners, which would be funded by both public and private money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Booth |first=Robert |title=Sadiq Khan condemns foreign investors' use of London homes as 'gold bricks' |date=25 May 2016 |website=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/25/sadiq-khan-condemns-foreign-investors-london-homes-gold-bricks-housing-policy |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160622095306/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/25/sadiq-khan-condemns-foreign-investors-london-homes-gold-bricks-housing-policy |archivedate=22 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in contrast to a pre-election statement, he revealed that he no longer supported rent freezes in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Foster |first=Dawn |title=Sadiq Khan attacks empty luxury flats, but his housing policies are also void |date=27 May 2016 |website=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/may/27/sadiq-khan-empty-luxury-flats-housing-policy |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920224616/https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/may/27/sadiq-khan-empty-luxury-flats-housing-policy |archivedate=20 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Insisting that he would "oppose building on the Green Belt, which is now even more important than when it was created", Khan vetoed the construction of a football stadium and two blocks of flats on Green Belt land in [[Chislehurst]], after the plan had already been supported by [[Bromley Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=May |first=Luke |title=Sadiq Khan rejects football stadium plans to protect Bromley's green space |website=Bromley Times |date=22 June 2016 |url=http://www.bromleytimes.co.uk/news/sadiq_khan_rejects_football_stadium_plans_to_protect_bromley_s_green_space_1_4587938 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624192156/http://www.bromleytimes.co.uk/news/sadiq_khan_rejects_football_stadium_plans_to_protect_bromley_s_green_space_1_4587938 |archivedate=24 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposing expansion at [[Heathrow Airport]], he urged Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] to instead support expansion at [[Gatwick Airport]], stating that to do so would bring "substantial economic benefits" to London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Crerar |first=Pippa |title=Sadiq Khan urges Theresa May to back Gatwick Airport expansion with second runway |website=London Evening Standard |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/sadiq-khan-urges-theresa-may-to-back-gatwick-airport-expansion-with-second-runway-a3296501.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725021415/http://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/sadiq-khan-urges-theresa-may-to-back-gatwick-airport-expansion-with-second-runway-a3296501.html |archivedate=25 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Air pollution ====
Khan has called air pollution “the biggest public health emergency of a generation.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/13/londons-most-polluted-schools-to-be-given-air-quality-audits|title=London's most polluted schools to be given air-quality audits|last=Taylor|first=Matthew|date=2017-09-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914045806/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/13/londons-most-polluted-schools-to-be-given-air-quality-audits|archivedate=14 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2017, Khan announced plans to clean up London's air by establishing an "ultra-low emissions zone (Ulez)" across London that would charge owners of the most polluting cars with a fine between £3 or £12.50 per day.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/sadiq-khan-plans-world-s-first-ultralow-emissions-zone-with-new-daily-charges-for-swathes-of-london-a3506561.html|title=Sadiq Khan plans world’s first ultra-low emission zone across huge swathe of London|work=Evening Standard|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914175643/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/sadiq-khan-plans-world-s-first-ultralow-emissions-zone-with-new-daily-charges-for-swathes-of-london-a3506561.html|archivedate=14 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zone is planned to be introduced in 2019.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Khan criticised Great Britain's government in June 2017 for its lack of drive in improving general air quality.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/23/sadiq-khan-michael-gove-life-and-death-air-pollution-crisis|title=Sadiq Khan: Gove must get a grip on 'life and death' air pollution crisis|last=Taylor|first=Matthew|date=2017-06-23|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915023727/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/23/sadiq-khan-michael-gove-life-and-death-air-pollution-crisis|archivedate=15 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the government’s action plan on the issue lacked “serious detail, fails to tackle all emission sources, such as from buildings, construction or the river, and does not utilise the government’s full resources and powers”, reflecting its low prioritisation of the issue in the past.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In September, he announced that the first 50 air quality audits for primary schools in the worst-polluted areas&amp;nbsp;of the city had been launched with the objective to reduce air pollution around public schools.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-41254593|title=Audit to protect 'pupils from toxic air'|date=2017-09-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914192317/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-41254593|archivedate=14 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The audits will continue until the end of 2017, with reports being published in 2018.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Spectator]]'', the political commentator [[Nick Cohen]] described Khan as a centre-left social democrat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nick Cohen |title=Would Jeremy Corbyn prefer George Galloway to be Mayor of London? |website=The Spectator |date=10 February 2016 |url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/02/would-jeremy-corbyn-prefer-george-galloway-to-be-mayor-of-london/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211090622/http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/02/would-jeremy-corbyn-prefer-george-galloway-to-be-mayor-of-london/ |archivedate=11 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the journalist [[Amol Rajan]] termed him "a torch-bearer for the social democratic wing" of the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Amol Rajan |title=After Boris, Mayor Khan for London? |date=15 September 2015 |website=Politico |url=http://www.politico.eu/article/tooting-to-victory-london-sadiq-khan-mayor-corbyn-goldsmith-boris-johnson-bevin/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314141400/http://www.politico.eu/article/tooting-to-victory-london-sadiq-khan-mayor-corbyn-goldsmith-boris-johnson-bevin/ |archivedate=14 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC describe Khan as being located on the party's [[soft left]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=London mayor: The Sadiq Khan story |author=Esther Webber |publisher=BBC News |date=7 May 2016 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-36140479 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507141456/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-36140479 |archivedate=7 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, in an article for [[Al Jazeera]], the [[Marxism|Marxist]] commentator [[Richard Seymour (writer)|Richard Seymour]] described Khan as a [[centrism|centrist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Richard Seymour |title=Sadiq Khan's victory and free Londonistan |publisher=Al Jazeera |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/05/sadiq-khan-victory-free-londonistan-160507174122069.html |date=8 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615015120/http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/05/sadiq-khan-victory-free-londonistan-160507174122069.html |archivedate=15 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Matt Wrack, the General Secretary of the [[Fire Brigades Union]], characterised Khan as belonging to "that part of the Labour Party that was in government under Blair and Brown".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Watts |first=Joe |title=Sadiq Khan faces backlash after saying Jeremy Corbyn election win is 'extremely unlikely' |website=The Independent |date=22 August 2016 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/a-counter-offensive-has-been-launched-against-sadiq-khan-after-the-london-mayor-said-a-jeremy-corbyn-a7202496.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708221128/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/a-counter-offensive-has-been-launched-against-sadiq-khan-after-the-london-mayor-said-a-jeremy-corbyn-a7202496.html |archivedate=8 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all British Muslims have however supported him; some of the supporters of [[Lutfur Rahman (politician)|Lutfur Rahman]]—whom Khan opposed—claimed that Khan was part of an Islamophobic Labour establishment.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=58}}

Journalist Dave Hill has said that Khan was "savvy, streetwise and not averse to a scrap"{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=101}}, whilst also describing him as having a "joshing, livewire off-stage personality" which differed from the formal image he often projected while onstage.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=59}}
Khan used to perform [[stand-up comedy]] before running for Mayor, including a ten-minute money-raising ''Stand Up for Labour'' routine. Comedian [[Arthur Smith (comedian)|Arthur Smith]] stated that Khan could become a "good club-level comedian one day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2016/09/05/25710/sadiq_khan%3A_i_used_to_do_stand-up|title=Sadiq Khan: 'I used to do stand-up'|work=Chortle|year=2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927083831/http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2016/09/05/25710/sadiq_khan%3A_i_used_to_do_stand-up|archivedate=27 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2016 Mayoral campaign, Goldsmith referred to Khan as "a caricature machine politician... the sort of politician who justified peoples' mistrust in politics", as evidence citing Khan's U-turn on supporting Heathrow expansion.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=116}}
Another rival in the 2016 Mayoral campaign, [[George Galloway]] of the [[Respect Party]], referred to Khan as a "flip-flop merchant" and a "product of the Blairite machine".{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=139}}

'''Saleh al-Ali''' or '''Shaykh Saleh Ahmad al-Ali''' ({{lang-ar|الشيخ صالح أحمد العلي}}) (1884 in [[Al-Shaykh Badr]] &amp;ndash; 13 April 1950 in [[Tartus]]) was a prominent [[Syrian people|Syrian]] [[Alawi]] leader who commanded the [[Syrian Revolt of 1919]], one of the first rebellions against the [[French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon|French mandate of Syria]] before the [[Great Syrian Revolt]].&lt;ref name="Moubayed"&gt;{{cite book

==Background==
Saleh al-Ali was born in 1884 to a family of Alawi notables from [[Al-Shaykh Badr]], in the [[Syrian Coastal Mountain Range]] in northwest. He reportedly clashed with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1918 before their withdrawal from Syria,&lt;ref name="Moosa"&gt;{{cite book

==Rebellion against the French==
{{main|Syrian Revolt of 1919}}

===Start of the rebellion===
{{see also|Franco-Syrian War}}
In 1918 the French occupied the Syrian coast and began to move into the interior. On December 15, 1918, Saleh al-Ali called for a meeting of prominent Alawi notables in the town of Sheikh Badr. Al-Ali alerted the attendees that the French had occupied the Syrian coast with the intention of separating the region from the rest of the country, and urged them to revolt and expel the French from Syria. When the French authorities heard of the meeting, they sent a force from [[Al-Qadmus]] to the town of Sheikh Badr in order to arrest Saleh al-Ali. Al-Ali and his men ambushed the force at the village of Niha, west of [[Wadi al-Oyoun]]. The French forces were defeated and suffered more than 35 casualties.&lt;ref name="Moosa"/&gt;

===Organizing the rebellion===
[[File:Syrian nationalists.jpg|thumb|Seated from left to right: [[Shukri al-Quwatli]] (future president), [[Saadallah al-Jabiri]] (future prime minister), [[Rida al-Shurbaji]] (co-founder of the National Bloc), Sheikh Saleh al-Ali, commander of the Syrian Coastal Revolt of 1919. Standing are Hajj [[Adib Kheir]] (left) and [[Ibrahim Hananu]], commander of the [[Aleppo Revolt]]]] 
After the initial victory, al-Ali started to organize his rebels into a disciplined force, with its own general command and military ranks. The army was supported by the local population, and some women supplied water and food and replaced the men at work in the fields.&lt;ref name="Moosa"/&gt; Al-Ali also allied himself with the [[Hananu Revolt|rebellion]] of [[Ibrahim Hananu]] in Aleppo, the uprising in [[Talkalakh]] by the Dandashi tribe and the revolt in [[Antioch]] by [[Subhi Barakat]]. He also received funds and arms from [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Kemal Atatürk]] of [[Turkey]] which was also at [[Franco-Turkish War|war with France]] at the time.&lt;ref name="Moubayed"/&gt;

In July 1919, in retaliation to French attacks against rebel positions, al-Ali attacked and occupied several [[Ismaili]] villages that were allied to the French. A truce was concluded between the two, but the French violated it by occupying and burning the village of Kaf al-Jaz. Al-Ali retaliated by attacking and occupying al-Qadmus from which the French conducted their military operations against him.&lt;ref name="Moosa"/&gt;

===Final stages===
The balance of power began to shift in favor of the French after they conquered [[Damascus]], defeating a makeshift army at the [[Battle of Maysalun]] on 24 July 1920. In November, General [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|Henri Gouraud]] mounted a full-fledged campaign against Saleh al-Ali's forces in the [[An-Nusayriyah Mountains]]. They entered al-Ali's village of Ash-Shaykh Badr and arrested many Alawi notables. Al-Ali fled to the north, but a large French force overran his positions and al-Ali went into hiding.&lt;ref name="Moosa"/&gt; A French [[court-martial]] convened in [[Latakia]] and sentenced him to death [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']].&lt;ref name="Moubayed"/&gt;

===Later years===
[[File:Sheikh Saleh al-Ali.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sheikh]] Saleh al-Ali]] 
Al-Ali remained in hiding until General Gouraud issued a general amnesty in 1922. He returned to his home and abstained from all political activity until his death on 13 April 1950 in [[Tartus]].&lt;ref name="Moubayed"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Saleh Al-Ali became a celebrated figure after the Syria's independence. Al-Ali, in his first public appearance since 1922, was a guest of honor of president [[Shukri al-Quwatli]] at the [[Evacuation Day (Syria)|Evacuation Day]] celebrations on 17 April 1946.&lt;ref name="Moubayed"/&gt;

One who calls himself a Sikh of the Guru, the True Guru, shall rise in the early morning hours and meditate on the Lord's Name. Upon arising early in the morning, he is to bathe, and cleanse himself in the pool of nectar. Following the Instructions of the Guru, he is to chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. All sins, misdeeds and negativity shall be erased. Then, at the rising of the sun, he is to sing Gurbani; whether sitting down or standing up, he is to meditate on the Lord's Name. One who meditates on my Lord, Har, Har, with every breath and every morsel of food - that GurSikh becomes pleasing to the Guru's Mind. That person, unto whom my Lord and Master is kind and compassionate - upon that GurSikh, the Guru's Teachings are bestowed. Servant Nanak begs for the dust of the feet of that GurSikh, who himself chants the Naam, and inspires others to chant it.

* [[Kangha (Sikhism)|Kanga]]: A wooden comb, usually worn under a Dastar
* [[Kachera]]: Cotton undergarments, historically appropriate in battle due to increased mobility when compared to a [[dhoti]]. Worn by both sexes, the kachera is a symbol of chastity.
* [[Kara (Sikhism)|Kara]]: An iron bracelet, a symbol of eternity.
* [[Kirpan]]: An iron dagger in different sizes. In the [[UK]] Sikhs can wear a small dagger, but in the Punjab they might wear a traditional curved sword from one to three feet in length.

[[File:Dilruba woman.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|alt=Woman in yellow scarf bowing an instrument|Woman playing the dilruba]]
{{Main|Sikh music}}
The Sikhs have a number of musical instruments: the [[Seni rebab|rebab]], [[Esraj|dilruba]], [[Taus (instrument)|taus]], jori and [[sarinda]]. Playing the [[sarangi]] was encouraged by [[Guru Hargobind]]. The rebab was played by [[Bhai Mardana]] as he accompanied [[Guru Nanak]] on his journeys. The jori and sarinda were introduced to Sikh devotional music by [[Guru Arjan]]. The [[Taus (instrument)|taus]] was designed by Guru Hargobind, who supposedly heard a peacock singing and wanted to create an instrument mimicking its sounds (''taus'' is the Persian word for peacock). The dilruba was designed by [[Guru Gobind Singh]] at the request of his followers, who wanted a smaller instrument than the taus. After [[Japji Sahib]], all of the [[shabad (hymn)|shabad]] in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] were composed as [[raga|raags]]. This type of singing is known as [[Gurmat Sangeet]].

When they marched into battle, the Sikhs would play a ''Ranjit Nagara'' (victory drum) to boost morale. Nagaras (usually two to three feet in diameter, although some were up to five feet in diameter) are played with two sticks. The beat of the large drums, and the raising of the [[Nishan Sahib]], meant that the ''singhs'' were on their way.

Although the rate of Sikh migration from the [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] has remained high, traditional patterns of Sikh migration favouring English-speaking countries (particularly the [[United Kingdom]]) have changed during the past decade due to stricter immigration laws.

The Sikh Youth Alliance of North America sponsors an annual [[Sikh Youth Symposium]], a public-speaking and debate competition held in gurdwaras throughout the U.S. and Canada. There are a number of Sikh office holders in Canada.

She still actively attends both Sikh and Christian services.

Sikh art and culture are nearly synonymous with that of the Punjab, and Sikhs are easily recognised by their distinctive turban ([[Dastar]]). The Punjab has been called India's melting pot, due to the confluence of invading cultures from the rivers from which the region gets its name. Sikh culture is therefore a synthesis of cultures. [[Sikhism]] has forged a unique [[Sikh architecture|architecture]], which S. S. Bhatti described as "inspired by [[Guru Nanak]]'s creative mysticism" and "is a mute harbinger of holistic humanism based on pragmatic spirituality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Sikh Confederacy was the catalyst for a uniquely Sikh form of expression, with Ranjit Singh commissioning forts, palaces, bungas (residential places) and colleges in a Sikh style. Sikh architecture is characterised by gilded fluted domes, cupolas, kiosks, stone lanterns, ornate [[baluster]]s and square roofs. A pinnacle of Sikh style is [[Harmandir Sahib]] (also known as the Golden Temple) in [[Amritsar]].

Sikh culture is influenced by militaristic motifs (with the [[Khanda (religious symbol)|Khanda]] the most obvious), and most Sikh artifacts—except for the relics of the [[Sikh Gurus|Gurus]]—have a military theme. This theme is evident in the Sikh festivals of [[Hola Mohalla]] and [[Vaisakhi]], which feature marching and displays of valor.

Although the art and culture of the Sikh diaspora have merged with that of other Indo-immigrant groups into categories like "British Asian", "Indo-Canadian" and "Desi-Culture", a minor cultural phenomenon which can be described as "political Sikh" has arisen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate =4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is influenced by their Sikhism and current affairs in the Punjab.

[[Bhangra (dance)|Bhangra]] and [[Giddha]] are two forms of Punjabi folk dancing which have been adapted and pioneered by Sikhs. Punjabi Sikhs have championed these forms of expression worldwide, resulting in Sikh culture becoming linked to Bhangra (although "Bhangra is not a Sikh institution but a Punjabi one").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Painting===
Sikh painting is a direct offshoot of the [[Kangra painting|Kangra school]] of painting. In 1810, Ranjeet Singh (1780–1839) occupied [[Kangra Fort]] and appointed Sardar Desa Singh Majithia his governor of the Punjab hills. In 1813 the Sikh army occupied [[Guler State]], and Raja Bhup Singh became a vassal of the Sikhs. With the Sikh kingdom of Lahore becoming the paramount power, some of the Pahari painters from Guler migrated to Lahore for the patronage of Maharaja Ranjeet Singh and his Sardars.

The Sikh school adapted Kangra painting to Sikh needs and ideals. Its main subjects are the ten Sikh gurus and stories from Guru Nanak's [[Janamsakhi]]s. The tenth Guru, Gobind Singh, left a deep impression on the followers of the new faith because of his courage and sacrifices. Hunting scenes and portraits are also common in Sikh painting.

'''Steve Moxon''' is a British former civil servant who first came to prominence as a [[whistleblower]] in March 2004 while he was employed as a caseworker at the [[Home Office]], which is the ministerial department of the United Kingdom that handles immigration, security, and law and order. Since being dismissed from his job at the Home Office and accepting an out-of-court settlement to an employment tribunal case he brought against his former employer, he has worked as an independent researcher on the relationship between the sexes. He was selected as a [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) candidate for the 2012 local elections in [[Sheffield]], but was forced to stand as an independent candidate after UKIP deselected him following comments that he made on his blog about the Norwegian mass-murderer [[Anders Breivik]]. Moxon has written two books: one on immigration and the other on the science of the relationship between the sexes. The former attracted praise from some critics, but was criticised by others as "highly selective" and [[Islamophobia|Islamophobic]]. The latter has been described as "singularly odd" and "wilfully controversial".

==Home Office==
Moxon came to public prominence as a whistleblower in March 2004, while working at the Home Office.&lt;ref name=Wainwright&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/may/02/ukip-steve-moxon-whistleblower-home-office-beverley-hughes|title=Sheffield UKIP candidate sacked over Breivik comments|first=Martin|last=Wainwright|work=The Guardian|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Moxon was a caseworker in the Home Office's Immigration and Nationality Directorate in Sheffield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Trading Information|first=Nicholas|last=Jones|location=London|publisher=Politico's Publishing|year=2006|isbn=978-1842750902|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that immigration checks had been waived for people from the [[A8 countries|eight countries]] in central and eastern Europe that were due to join the [[European Union]] in May of that year, so as to make migration flows following EU enlargement look less dramatic.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-17911131|title=Sheffield UKIP candidate removed over Breivik blog post|work=BBC News|date=1 May 2012|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3589261.stm|title=Timeline: Immigration row|work=BBC News|date=17 June 2004|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allegations were published in the ''[[Sunday Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/147491|title=Watching brief – Amanda Platell on the agenda-setting Sunday Times|first=Amanda|last=Platell|work=New Statesman|date=15 March 2004|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moxon's revelations, along with those of two other whistleblowers, resulted in the resignation of junior minister [[Beverley Hughes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3589617.stm|title=Whistleblower: 'I am vindicated'|work=BBC News|date=1 April 2004|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/apr/01/immigrationpolicy.immigrationandpublicservices1|title=Explained: the Hughes affair|first=Matthew|last=Tempest|work=The Guardian|date=1 April 2004|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moxon himself was dismissed from his civil service job.&lt;ref name=Fight&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/3943489.stm|title=Whistleblower will fight sacking|work=BBC News|date=1 August 2004|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he was feted by figures from the opposition [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] including [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], but they distanced themselves from him when it was revealed that Moxon had e-mailed the website of the BBC's ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' programme claiming that: "An international alliance of Islamic Year Zeros feverishly exporting death to 'infidel' and non-fundamentalist Muslims alike...eventually will have to be silenced by nuclear weapons".&lt;ref name=Wainwright/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/mar/11/conservatives.immigrationpolicy|title=Howard caught out after championing whistleblower|first=Sarah|last=Hall|work=The Guardian|date=11 March 2004|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moxon subsequently wrote a book, ''The Great Immigration Scandal'',&lt;ref name=Wainwright/&gt; which was published by Imprint Academic in August 2004.&lt;ref name=Scandal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/books/moxon.html|title=The Great Immigration Scandal|publisher=Imprint Academic|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Davis had been scheduled to chair the launch event for the book, but withdrew "amid claims that the book was an Islamophobic rant". A Conservative Party spokesman reported that Davis "had agreed to go provisionally and talk in favour of Steve as a whistleblower. But that was before he saw the contents of the book. He then felt unable to attend". According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', the book "claims the term 'paki' is not racist; predicts immigration leading to Ulster-style civil war; and Asians are more likely to be organised criminals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/sep/07/immigrationandpublicservices.conservatives|title=Tory asylum assault goes awry|first1=Michael|last1=White|first2=Vikram|last2=Dodd|work=The Guardian|date=7 September 2004|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Frank Field (British politician)|Frank Field]] reviewed the book for the ''Sunday Times'', describing it as a "slow-burn Molotov cocktail on immigration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Policy, what policy?|first=Frank|last=Field|work=Sunday Times|date=17 October 2004|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received positive endorsements from commentators including [[Andrew Green, Baron Green of Deddington|Andrew Green]] of [[MigrationWatch UK]] and [[David George Green|David G. Green]] of [[Civitas (think tank)|Civitas]].&lt;ref name=Scandal/&gt; Academic Neil Lunt, reviewing the book in the journal ''Political Studies Review'', gave it one star and wrote that: "Scandals are everywhere and doomsday scenarios litter the text. There is a lack of clear and judicious argument: referencing is highly selective, and there are frequent sweeping and unsupported statements. Moxon fails to convey an understanding of many issues including structural discrimination, the 1951 Refugee Convention and Britain's relationship to Empire. In some places the text is well written; in others it resembles a teenager's diary. Further, alongside the now familiar caricatures of migrant scroungers, there were also inappropriate and offensive references ''vis-à-vis'' women, disability and race".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Great Immigration Scandal by Steve Moxon|first=Neil|last=Lunt|journal=Political Studies Review|volume=3|issue=3|year=2005|pages=407–408|doi=10.1111/j.1478-9299.2005.00030_2.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his sacking, Moxon announced that he would take the Home Office to an [[employment tribunal]] for unfair dismissal.&lt;ref name=Fight/&gt; In July 2005, on the day the tribunal was scheduled for, Moxon and the Home Office reached an out-of-court settlement. Moxon reportedly accepted a settlement of between £40,000 and £50,000, and signed a [[Gag order|gagging clause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.personneltoday.com/hr/home-office-whistleblowing-case-settled-out-of-court/|title=Home Office whistleblowing case settled out of court|first=Mike|last=Berry|work=Personnel Today|date=4 July 2005|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of media coverage of whistleblowing, academics Karin Wahl-Jorgensen and Joanne Hunt use Moxon's case as an example of how, in a sample covering the period 1 January 1997 to 20 March 2009, "whistleblower stories featured prominently in tabloids when they chimed with the political orientation of that particular newspaper". They note "the right-leaning, anti-immigration ''[[Daily Express|Express]]''' coverage" of his whistleblowing. They also note that the ''Express'' compared the whistleblowing of Moxon with that of [[Clare Short]] and [[Katherine Gunn]]. The newspaper described Moxon as "brave" and suggested that he "said what he did to protect his country", and Gunn as "acting on principle", while it claimed Short's revelations about the British government's illegal surveillance at the United Nations "hurt her country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Journalism, accountability and the possibilities for structural critique: A case study of coverage of whistleblowing|first1=Karin|last1=Wahl-Jorgensen|first2=Joanne|last2=Hunt|journal=Journalism|volume=13|issue=4|pages=399–416|year=2012|doi=10.1177/1464884912439135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UK Independence Party==
In 2012, Moxon was due to stand as a UK Independence Party candidate in [[Sheffield City Council election, 2012|local elections in Sheffield]], but he was deselected by the party after endorsing the analysis contained in the "manifesto" of Norwegian mass-murderer Anders Breivik. Moxon had written on his blog that: "That pretty well everyone—myself not excluded—recoiled at his actions, does not belie the accuracy of Breivik's research and analysis in his 'manifesto', which is in line with most scholarship in respect of both Political Correctness and Islam".&lt;ref name=Wainwright/&gt; Moxon and UKIP both noted that he had not said that he condoned Breivik's crimes, but the party noted that "he has made a number of remarks on subjects such as the Breivik manifesto and Islam that are at odds with UKIP policy and perspective".&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; He eventually stood as an independent candidate,&lt;ref name=McSmith/&gt; winning 363 votes in the [[Dore and Totley]] ward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/local/election-results-sheffield-s-ex-council-leader-paul-scriven-loses-his-seat-1-4517468|title=Election Results: Sheffield's ex Council leader Paul Scriven loses his seat|work=The Star|date=4 May 2012|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Moxon's personal website, his politics were originally "centre-Left/'green'". He states that he was "a [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal-Democrat]] activist for the best part of two decades".&lt;ref name=Profile/&gt; According to a 2004 article in the ''[[Sheffield Star]]'', Moxon also "claims to have played a part in the backroom team for the election campaign of [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Hallam]] MP [[Richard Allan]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/what-s-on/out-about/i-ve-no-regrets-about-speaking-out-says-whistle-blower-1-320223|title=I've no regrets about speaking out says whistle blower|work=The Star|date=9 March 2004|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' published in 2007, Moxon stated that he didn't "have a particular interest" in debates about immigration, noting that his passion was instead for psychology, and that he had previously dropped out of a psychology degree course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=I've never regretted blowing the whistle on migrants|first=Keith|last=Dovkants|work=London Evening Standard|date=31 October 2007|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moxon now describes himself as an independent researcher.&lt;ref name=Profile&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stevemoxon.co.uk/profile.php|title=Profile|publisher=Steve Moxon|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated in 2007 that the payout he received from the Home Office as a result of their out-of-court settlement enabled him "to not have to work for a while, so that's when I started writing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/pandora/pandora-home-office-whistleblower-declares-war-on-feminism-764114.html|title=Pandora: Home Office whistle-blower declares war on feminism|first=

He argued that, despite the book's subtitle, "the science presented isn't all that new, nor is much science presented" and that "there are myriad concerns with the details of the science &lt;nowiki&gt;[Moxon]&lt;/nowiki&gt; invokes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review – The Woman Racket|first=George|last=Williamson|journal=Metapsychology|volume=12|issue=19|year=2008|url=http://metapsychology.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=book&amp;id=4221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novelist [[Lionel Shriver]] wrote in the ''Guardian'' that it was a "wilfully controversial book claiming that men are the downtrodden sex, so pretentious and badly written that even the happy prospect of finding it offensive couldn't pull me through".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/14/law|title=Finally, a jury can decide whether a reprobate dared to throw her apple core to the ground|first=Lionel|last=Shriver|work=The Guardian|date=14 February 2008|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Moxon was ranked by an anti-feminist website as one of the ten most powerful people in the [[men's rights movement]].&lt;ref name=Rickman&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/11/21/steve-moxon-women-business_n_2170854.html|title=Women 'Incapable' Of Becoming Bosses at Work, Steve Moxon Tells Parliamentary Committee|first=Dina|last=Rickman|work=HuffPost|date=21 November 2012|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also given evidence to a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Business, Innovation and Skills Committee|Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee]] inquiry into women in the workplace. It was reported that Moxon had suggested to the committee that women were "incapable" of rising to senior management positions. Feminist writer [[Laura Bates]] argued that it was worrying that the select committee "should be seeking out the view of someone who has openly expressed these opinions and demonstrated that he is prejudiced against women as a gender".&lt;ref name=Rickman/&gt; Committee member [[Robin Walker]] noted that Moxon was chosen to ensure "a wide range of views" was represented, but that "He was definitely on the extreme end and he didn't come across as very reasonable at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/world/539545/male-academic-says-women-are-biologically-unfit-to-operate-at-senior-levels-of-business.html#IxVoqSspVJaFMZZj.99|title=
Male academic says women are 'biologically unfit' to operate at senior levels of business|first=Natasha|last=Wynarczyk|work=Marie Claire|date=13 November 2012|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moxon made a complaint to the [[BBC Trust]] about coverage of the select committee's inquiry in an episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme ''[[Woman's Hour]]'', broadcast in December 2012. He complained that he had not in fact claimed that women were incapable of becoming bosses. Moxon's claim that the programme "had over many years displayed unfairness to men generically and had dismissed scientific research on men/women" was dismissed, as were three of Moxon's other complaints, including that about the characterisation of his evidence to the inquiry. His complaint that the presenter misreprestented him as "a man who describes himself as an academic" was, however, upheld. In his complaint, Moxon stated that he describes himself as an "independent cross-disciplinary researcher/writer on the biological roots of human sociality with a particular interest in the sexes", and noted that he did not have a university affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/appeals/esc_bulletins/2013/apr_may.pdf|title=Editorial Standards Findings: Appeals to the Trust and other editorial issues considered by the Editorial Standards Committee|publisher=BBC Trust|pages=13–24|date=June 2013|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/bbc-watchdog-rules-in-favour-of-womans-hour-after-man-complains-of-sexism-8665560.html|title=BBC watchdog rules in favour of Woman's Hour after man complains of sexism|first=Matilda|last=Battersby|work=The Independent|date=19 June 2013|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
