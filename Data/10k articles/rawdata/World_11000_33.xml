'''1605''' (pronounced as sixteen-o-five) is a techno and tech-house record label, founded in 2007 by Slovenian DJ and producer [[DJ Umek|UMEK]]. With 140 releases by more than 250 artists&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discogs.com/label/1605+Music+Therapy&lt;/ref&gt; 1605 is the biggest label UMEK has founded since Recycled Loops and Consumer Recreation. UMEK started the label to promote tracks from talented artists, regardless of their fame and the strength of previous releases.&lt;ref name="resideanacivsor"&gt;{{cite web|title=1605 |url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/promoter.aspx?id=2043 |publisher=Residentadvisor.net |accessdate=Aug 5, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iwKIoyKY?url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/promoter.aspx?id=2043 |archivedate=2009-08-11 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creative concept==
The label's creative concept is based on its sound as well as on its visual appearance.&lt;ref name=VBG&gt;{{cite web|last=VBG.si|title=1605|url=http://www.vbg.si/en/visual/identity/1605|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1605 sound relies on UMEK's creative feeling as he acts as A&amp;R manager and decides personally which tracks are signed by the label. Tracks are usually released digitally and sold online in various outlets such as [[Beatport]], [[iTunes]], Trackitdown, [[Juno Online Services|Juno]] and others. The only project, which was released also on a CD, was UMEK's 2010 album Responding to Dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discogs.com/Umek-Responding-To-Dynamic/release/2225190&lt;/ref&gt;

1605's music can also be heard on the label's podcast&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sixteenofive.com/podcast/&lt;/ref&gt; and on websites such as Soundcloud&lt;ref&gt;https://soundcloud.com/sixteenofive&lt;/ref&gt; and Mixcloud.

The label is also building its recognition by using a distinctive graphic design for artwork (release covers, promo material). Using only artwork in grayscale with occasional yellow tones, all release covers feature parts of vintage pictures from the 1930s [[Great Depression]] in the USA and personal drawings by the label's graphic designer.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

The '''Aru Islands Regency''' (also '''Aroe Islands''', {{lang-id|Kabupaten Kepulauan Aru}}) are a group of about ninety-five low-lying [[island]]s in the [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]] [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]] of eastern [[Indonesia]]. They also form a regency of [[Maluku province]], with a land area of {{convert|8,152.42|km2|abbr=off}}. At the 2011 Census the Regency had a population of 84,138;&lt;ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011"&gt;Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the latest official estimate (as of January 2014) was 93,722.

== Administration ==
The regency is divided into seven [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan''), tabulated below with their areas (in km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and their 2010 Census populations.

==Geography==

The islands are the easternmost in Maluku province, and are located in the [[Arafura Sea]] southwest of [[New Guinea]] and north of [[Australia]]. The total area of the islands is 8,152.42&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (3,147 sq mi). The largest island is [[Tanahbesar]] (also called [[Wokam]]); Dobo, the chief port of the islands, is on Wamar, just off Tanahbesar. Other main islands are Kola, [[Kobroor]], [[Maikoor]], and [[Trangan]]. The main islands rise to low hills, and are separated by meandering channels. Geologically, the group is part of the [[Australia (continent)|Australian continent]], along with [[New Guinea]], [[Tanimbar Islands|Tanimbar]], [[Tasmania]], [[Waigeo]], and [[Raja Ampat]] on the [[Indo-Australian Plate]].

Aru is covered by a mix of [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forests]], [[savanna]], and [[mangroves]]. The Islands lie on the [[Australia-New Guinea]] [[continental shelf]], and were connected to Australia and New Guinea by land when sea levels were lower during the [[ice age]]s. The flora and fauna of Aru are part of the [[Australasia ecozone]], and closely related to that of New Guinea. Aru is part, together with much of western New Guinea, of the [[Vogelkop-Aru lowland rain forests]] [[terrestrial ecoregion]].

As part of the political and administrative decentralization of Indonesia since [[Suharto]] stepped down in 1998, the Aru Islands are now a separate residency (''kabupaten''), headquartered at Dobo, split off from the residency of Central Maluku.

==Economy==

Pearl farming provides a major source of income for the islands. The Aru pearl industry has been criticized in national media for allegedly maintaining exploitive [[debt]] structures that bind the local men who dive for pearls to outside boat owners and traders in an unequal relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Spyer, Patricia (1997). The eroticism of debt: pearl divers, traders, and sea wives in the Aru Islands, Eastern Indonesia. ''American Ethnologist'' 24(3):515-538.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other export products include [[sago]], [[coconut]]s, [[tobacco]], [[mother of pearl]], ''trepang'' (an edible [[sea cucumber (food)|sea cucumber]], which is dried and cured), tortoiseshell, and [[Greater bird-of-paradise|bird-of-paradise]] plumes.{{Citation needed|date = December 2012}}

In November 2011, the Government of Indonesia awarded two oil-and-gas production-sharing contracts (PSC) about {{convert|200|km|mi|spell=in|0}} west of the Aru Islands to [[BP]]. The two adjacent offshore exploration PSCs, West Aru I and II, cover an area of about {{convert|16,400|km2|abbr=off}} with water depths ranging from {{convert|200|to|2500|m|abbr=off}}. BP plans to acquire [[reflection seismology|seismic data]] over the two blocks.&lt;ref name=oet&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia: Government Awards Two Offshore PSCs to BP|url= http://www.offshoreenergytoday.com/indonesia-government-awards-two-offshore-pscs-to-bp/ |newspaper=Offshore Energy Today|date=21 November 2011}}

==History==

The Aru Islands have a long history as a part of extensive trading networks throughout what is now eastern Indonesia. Precolonial links were especially strong to the [[Banda Islands]], and [[Bugis]] and [[Makasar]]ese traders also visited regularly.

The islands were sighted and also possibly visited by some Portuguese navigators, such as Martim Afonso de Melo, in 1522-24, who sighted the islands and wintered on a nearby island or of the Aru archipelago itself, and possibly by [[Gomes de Sequeira]], in 1526, as is pointed out in the cartography of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

''The Pacific Basin: A History of its Geographical Exploration'' The American Geographical Society, New York, 1967, p.121&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands were [[colonialism|colonized]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] beginning 1623, though initially the [[Dutch East India Company]] was one of several trading groups in the area, with limited influence over the islands' internal affairs.
In 1857 the famous naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] visited the islands. His visit later made him realise, that the Aru islands must have been connected by a landbridge to mainland New Guinea during the ice age.
In the nineteenth century, Dobo, Aru's largest town, temporarily became an important regional trading center, serving as a meeting point for Dutch, Makasarese, Chinese, and other traders. The period from the 1880s to 1917 saw a backlash against this outside influence, by a spiritually-based movement among local residents to rid the islands of outsiders.

==Demographics==
[[File:UvA-BC 300.146 - Siboga - Arunezen op het dek van de Siboga.jpg|thumb|Inhabitants of the eastern coast of the Aru Islands, photographed late 1899 during the [[Siboga Expedition]].]]
The islands had a population of 84,138 at the 2010 Census.&lt;ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011"/&gt; Most indigenous islanders are of mixed [[Malay people|Malay]] and [[Papuan peoples|Papuan]] descent. Fourteen languages - [[Barakai]], [[Batuley]], [[Dobel language|Dobel]], [[Karey]], [[Koba language|Koba]], [[Kola language|Kola]], [[Kompane]], [[Lola (language)|Lola]], [[Lorang]], [[Manombai]], [[Mariri language|Mariri]], [[East Tarangan]], [[West Tarangan]], and [[Ujir]] - are indigenous to Aru. They belong to the [[Central Malayo-Polynesian languages]], and are related to the other languages of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], [[Nusa Tenggara]], and [[Timor]]. Ambonese Malay is also spoken on Wamar. All are members of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]].

The population is mostly Christian with a small Muslim minority. Figures cited by Glenn Dolcemascolo for 1993 were approximately 90% Protestant, 6% Catholic, and 4% Muslim.&lt;ref name=Dolcemascolo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dolcemascolo|first=Glenn|title=Foreign Encounters In an Aruese Landscape|journal=[[Cakalele (journal)|Cakalele]]|year=1996|volume=7|pages=79–92|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/4211|publisher=The Center for Southeast Asian Studies|issn=1053-2285}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent report from 2007 suggested that the 4% Muslim figure may only relate to the indigenous population and that the actual percentage of Muslims may be significantly higher.&lt;ref name="O’Connor 2007, p. 5"&gt;O’Connor (2007), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Islam is thought to have been introduced to the islands in the late 15th century.&lt;ref name="O’Connor 2007, p. 5"/&gt; The Dutch brought Christianity in the 17th and 18th centuries but much of the conversion of the population to Christianity did not take place until the 20th century.&lt;ref name="O’Connor 2007, p. 5"/&gt;

'''Presidential elections''' were held in [[Benin]] on 4 March 2001, with a second round run-off on 18 March. They controversially resulted in the re-election of [[Mathieu Kérékou]] for a second term. Kérékou's rival [[Nicéphore Soglo]], who had been president from 1991 to 1996, failed in his bid to reclaim the presidency; although he qualified to participate in the second round of the election against Kérékou, he refused to do so, alleging [[electoral fraud]]. [[Adrien Houngbédji]], the parliament speaker and third-placed candidate, also refused to participate in a second round. As a result, Kérékou faced fourth-place candidate [[Bruno Amoussou]], who was planning minister and had already given his support to Kérékou, in the second round; Kérékou won an easy victory with 84% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1263931.stm "Benin 'day of mourning'"] BBC News, 6 April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/bj.html Elections in Benin] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Caves of Barać''' ({{lang-hr|Baraćeve špilje}}) are located near the village of [[Nova Kršlja]] in the municipality of [[Rakovica, Croatia|Rakovica]], [[Croatia]].  In 1892 the [[cave]]s were opened to visitors but subsequently abandoned and forgotten following [[World War II]]. In July 2004 the Upper Caves of Barać were reopened to visitors.

The caves are named after a certain [[Barać]] who was a fighter against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. According to a legend the caves bear the name of the victory of Barać at the caves. The surname of Barać does not exist anymore in this region.

'''Global Initiative on Psychiatry''' (GIP) is an international foundation for mental health reform which took part in the campaign against the [[political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union|political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donskis|2009|p=314}}; {{harvnb|Leygraf|2010}}; {{harvnb|Narayan|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is of [[NGO]] type.{{sfn|Pallot|Piacentini|Moran|2012|p=234}}

Headquartered in [[Hilversum]], GIP has regional centers in [[Tbilisi]], [[Sofia]], and [[Vilnius]], and a country office in [[Dushanbe]].{{sfn|GIP|2015}}

GIP is a main contributor to improving psychiatric care in countries of the former [[Soviet Union]] as well as Central and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|GIP|2015}}; {{harvnb|Voren|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has expanded its focus and as of 2010 is including projects in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[the Caribbean]].{{sfn|GIP|2015}}

GIP also focuses on the [[political abuse of psychiatry]] throughout the world&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tobin|2013}}; {{harvnb|Voren|2010b}}&lt;/ref&gt; and human rights monitoring.{{sfn|Voren|2009|p=xii}}

== History ==
20 December 1980 saw the formation in [[Paris]] of the International Association on the Political Use of Psychiatry (IAPUP) whose first secretary was Dr Gérard Bles of France.{{sfn|Bloch|Reddaway|1985|p=273}} Since the Congress in [[Honolulu]] in 1978, he has inspired the movement against the use of psychiatry for political ends.{{sfn|Besse|2006}} The organization campaigned against the [[political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union]]{{sfn|Birley|2000}} by leading efforts within national and international psychiatric organizations to eradicate this systematic abuse.{{sfn|Mossialos|Murthy|McDaid|2003}} The IAPUP had no connection with any political group nor with [[antipsychiatry]].{{sfn|Matas|1989}} The organization brought together and coordinated independent groups dedicated to the struggle against political abuse of psychiatry and composed of psychiatrists and human rights activists from [[Canada]], [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]], and [[West Germany]].{{sfn|Matas|1989}} During its first two decades IAPUP, investigated the accusations of oppressive exploitation in a number of countries such as [[Argentina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Chile]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Cuba]], [[Eastern Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[South Africa]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Terell|2014}} The publication of the IAPUP was ''Information Bulletin''.{{sfn|Wiseberg|Sirett|1982|p=119}} The IAPUP included the following participating committees:{{sfn|Wiseberg|Sirett|1982|p=119}}
# Working Group on the Internment of Dissenters in Mental Hospitals;
# Committee of French Psychiatrists Against the Use of Psychiatry for Political Purposes;
# German Association Against the Political Abuse of Psychiatry;
# International Podrabinek Fund;
# Swiss Association Against Psychiatric Abuse for Political Purposes.

In 1986, Robert van Voren became General Secretary of the IAPUP.{{sfn|Voren|2010a|p=111}} After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the financing of the IAPUP headed by Robert van Voren ceased until it adopted program of broad compromises and, correspondingly, the opposite name of The International Association for the Abolition and Prevention of Political Psychiatry, or Geneva Initiative on Psychiatry.{{sfn|Savenko|2009}} In 2005, the organization was renamed Global Initiative on Psychiatry (GIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tobin|2013}}; {{harvnb|Voren|2010b}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1995 to 2000, Chair of the Geneva Initiative on Psychiatry was [[James Birley]].{{sfn|Birley|2004}}

== Leadership ==
The board is composed of professionals from some twenty countries.{{sfn|Adler|Mueller|Ayat|1993}} Chief Executive of the Global Initiative on Psychiatry is [[Robert van Voren]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leygraf|2010}}; {{harvnb|Targum|Chaban|Mykhnyak|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Honorary Fellow of the British [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] and Honorary Member of the [[Ukrainian Psychiatric Association]].{{sfn|Donskis|2009|p=314}} In 2005, he was knighted by [[Queen Beatrix]] of the [[Netherlands]] for his work as a human rights activist.{{sfn|Donskis|2009|p=314}} He is a professor of Soviet and post-Soviet Studies in the [[Ilia State University]] in [[Tbilisi]] ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) and in the [[Vytautas Magnus University]] in [[Kaunas]] ([[Lithuania]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voren|2013}}; {{harvnb|Clark|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approach ==
The Global Initiative on Psychiatry uses a local approach to helping the mentally ill in underprivileged countries around the world. In Robert van Voren's words, their idea is that "mental health services should be locally empowered, locally adapted, community based, user oriented, and focused on keeping people with mental illness in society, instead of taking them out."{{sfn|Levin|2013}} The organization has been involved in deinstitutionalizing mental health services for children in post-Communist countries.{{sfn|McLeigh|Sianko|2011}} The GIP dedicates itself to promoting the necessary reforms to implement "humane, ethical, and effective mental health care throughout the world."{{sfn|Banerjee|2012}} Reports by the Global Initiative on Psychiatry are often comprehensive and consider the treatment options.{{sfn|Buckingham|Schrage|Cournos|2013}} The organization has campaigned with substantial success against poor mental health practices abroad, especially in China and the former communist states.{{sfn|Richmond|2013}} Robert van Voren's contribution to reform of forensic psychiatry in states of the former Soviet Union is widely recognized.{{sfn|Gordon|2006}}

The '''goje''' (the [[Hausa language|Hausa]] name for the instrument) is one of the many names for a variety of one or two-stringed [[fiddles]] from  [[West Africa]], almost exclusively played by ethnic groups inhabiting the [[Sahel]] and [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] sparsely vegetated [[grassland]] belts leading to the [[Sahara]].  [[Snakeskin]] or lizard skin covers a [[gourd]] bowl, and a [[horsehair]] string is suspended on [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]]. The goje is played with a [[bowstring]].

The goje is commonly used to accompany song, and is usually played as a solo instrument, although it also features prominent in ensembles with other West African string, wind or percussion instruments, including the [[Shekere]] or [[Ney]].

The various names by which the goje is known by include '''goge''' ([[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Zarma language|Zarma]]), '''gonjey''' ([[Dagomba language|Dagomba]], [[Gurunsi]]), '''gonje''', ([[Mamprusi]], [[Dagomba language|Dagomba]]), '''njarka''' ([[Songhay languages|Songhay]]), '''n'ko''' ([[Bambara language|Bambara]], [[Mandinka language|Mandinka]] and other [[Mande languages]]), '''riti''' ([[Fula language|Fula]], [[Serer language|Serer]]), and '''nyanyeru''' or '''nyanyero'''.

The '''Hirske coal mine''' ({{lang-uk|Шахта «Гірська»}}) is a large coal mine located in the south-east of [[Ukraine]] in [[Hirske]], [[Luhansk Oblast]]. Hirske represents one of the largest [[coal]] reserves in [[Ukraine]] having estimated reserves of 46.5&amp;nbsp;million tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.epa.gov/cmop/docs/ukraine_handbook.pdf |title=Coal mine methane in Ukraine |date=January 2001 |publisher=epa.gov |accessdate=2010-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408220448/http://www.epa.gov/cmop/docs/ukraine_handbook.pdf |archivedate=2011-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual coal production is around 320,000 tonnes.

In 1980, 66&amp;nbsp;miners and two rescue workers died in an accident at the Hirske mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://amarillo.com/stories/031200/usn_LA0599.shtml|title=Explosion kills 80 Ukrainian miners | first = Sergei | last = Shargorodsky |date=12 March 2000|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Institute of International Relations (IIR)''' is a public research institution that conducts basic and applied scientific research in the field of international relations. Its director is doc. Ing. Mgr. Petr Kratochvil, Ph.D., important elements of self-government organizational structures are also IIR Board and the Supervisory Board.

IIR's predecessor was the '''Institute for International Politics and Economics (IIPE)''', founded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1957.&lt;ref name="The EU Non-Proliferation Consortium"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nonproliferation.eu/thinktanks/thinktanks.php?tid=iir |title=The EU Non-Proliferation Consortium - Think tank : Institute of International Relations Prague |publisher=Nonproliferation.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IIPE was canceled at the beginning of the [[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|normalization]] period in 1970 because of the activities of employees during the [[Prague Spring]]. After the [[Velvet Revolution]] of 1989, the Institute of International Relations underwent radical changes. In 2007, the IIR transformed into a public research institution, since when it had been funded through grants and foundations.

Since 1970 it has been located in 3 Neruda Street in [[Prague]]. The public can also visit the historic building and use the services of specialized libraries, study halls and attend organized events.

==History and present==
In 1957, the Czechoslovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs established the '''Institute of International Politics and Economics (IIPE)'''. In the course of the 1960s, a number of the Institute’s researchers took part in the reform process which peaked during the [[Prague Spring]] of 1968. As a result, the IIPE was reorganized and on 1 March 1970 turned into the '''Institute of International Relations (IIR)''' which employed some of the IIPE’s employees.

The following period of the so-called normalization was characterized, especially in its first years, by strong ideological influence on the Institute’s activities. Nevertheless, the Institute continued maintaining relations with foreign institutions, including the capitalist countries. Its library also played an important role, as its funds comprised resources which were nowhere else to be found in the then [[Czechoslovakia]].

The fall of communism meant important personnel as well as organizational changes also for the Institute of International Relations. In 1993, the scholarly quarterly journal Mezinarodni vztahy, which had been issued already since 1966, was joined by the Perspectives bi-annual published in English. The portfolio of periodicals was also gradually supplemented by the popular Mezinarodni politika monthly, issued – albeit with a 20 year interruption – already since 1957. The IIR also grew bigger, as it acquired two new autonomous units – the '''Diplomatic Academy''' (which became a separate body within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 1 January 2007) and the '''Development Centre'''.

In the year of the 50th anniversary of the Institute - 2007 - the IIR underwent a transformation and turned into an independent public research institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nira.or.jp/past/ice/nwdtt/2005/DAT/1082.html |title=Institute of International Relations Prague (IIR) |publisher=Nira.or.jp |date= |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a change in funding, which has become much more dependent on the results of the Institute's staff: the Institute is supported through a grant scheme for projects in the field of foreign policy by foreign and domestic entities ( e.g. the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic ) and various foundations ( e.g. the German [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]] or the American [[PEW Charitable Trust]] ).&lt;ref name="dokumenty-iir.cz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zpráva o činnosti Ústavu mezinárodních vztahů, v.v.i., za rok 2012|url=http://www.dokumenty-iir.cz/VyrocniZprava/Zprava_2012_web.pdf|publisher=Dokumenty-iir.cz|accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These funds allow the implementation of the research activities of the Institute, also offering scholarships to support young scientists either through permanent research projects, or in the form of various internships.

At present, the Institute of International Relations ranks among the leading institutions in the field of international relations in the Czech Republic and in the European context, for example according to an independent evaluation of the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gotothinktank.com/dev1/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2012_Global_Go_To_Think_Tank_Report_-_FINAL-1.28.13.pdf |title=2012 Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program |publisher=Gotothinktank.com |accessdate=2014-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014173421/http://gotothinktank.com/dev1/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2012_Global_Go_To_Think_Tank_Report_-_FINAL-1.28.13.pdf |archivedate=14 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, however, workers of the IIR abiding by the Code of Ethics and internal rules do not hold one particular opinion or political current. Topics dealt with are free to be chosen and there is an internal or external way of evaluating scientific value and contribution to the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matúš Mišík |url=http://www.ustavmezinarodnichvztahu.cz/list/vyzkumni-pracovnici |title=Výzkumní pracovníci - Ústav mezinárodních vztahů |publisher=Ustavmezinarodnichvztahu.cz |date= |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institute was located  in the Lobkowicz Palace from 1957 to 1970, then it was moved into the building in 3 Neruda Street in Prague in Malá Strana.

==Activity==
In its activities, the IIR follows four basic goals:
* to conduct research in the field of international relations
* to strive for improvements in the quality and prestige of Czech science
* to assist in the formation and conduct of foreign policy of the Czech Republic
* to increase awareness of issues of international relations both among professionals and among the public

The main activity of the Institute is the research carried out by researchers of international relations department. IIR performs basic and applied research, the main concern is the field of [[European integration]] with a specific focus on the interests and actions of the Czech Republic in the [[European Union]], international security, with emphasis on the role of the Czech Republic in international security relations, not least in the area of development of selected strategic regions. More specifically:

===European integration===
The aim is to follow the process of European integration and the role of the Czech Republic in this process, focusing especially on:
* the future of the EU,
* the institutional structure of the EU and reforms,
* the EU enlargement,
* building of the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]],
* economic convergence of the Central and East European countries within the EU,
* trade and monetary policy,
* European policies of small states,
* environmental policy and
* co-operation in the area of justice and home affairs.

IIR is a member of [[TEPSA]] (Trans European Policy Studies Association).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tepsa.eu/category/complementary-information-members-institutes/institute-of-international-relations-prague/ |title=Institute of International Relations, Prague |publisher=Tepsa.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security policy===
The aim is to develop the abilities of Czech Republic to react flexibly vis-a-vis the security challenges of the new era. This comprises mainly issues such as:
* building the Common European Security and Defence Policy,
* contemporary and future transatlantic relations,
* international crime and other non-military dimensions of security,
* broader context of the reform of Czech armed forces, including acquisition issues,
* peacekeeping operations, including complex missions which comprise crisis management, post-conflict stabilization and development,
* relations between the media and state administration in the area of foreign and security policies, and
* the issue of terrorism.

===Developments in particular countries and regions of the world===
The aim is to follow and analyse developments especially in those countries and regions which are topically covered by the IIR researchers. Currently it is mainly:
* France, Germany
* Central Europe and [[Visegrad countries]]
* United States of America
* Russia and the post-soviet region
* Middle East and North Africa
* Southeast Asia and China
* Scandinavia
* the Balkans

The subject of additional activities of IIR is:
* '''Publishing activities''' focused on international relations. The Institute publishes three periodicals focusing on international politics ( Mezinárodní politika - monthly, Mezinárodní vztahy - quarterly, Perspectives - semi-annually, in English) and books (monographs, study books, conference proceedings, files, documents, information materials). IIR is also actively involved in the publication impact factor of the Journal of International Relations and Development. IIR is also a long-term partner of The Europe's World, which brings together over 45 research institutions across Europe and provides a common platform for discussion on international relations to experts and policy makers from all EU member states.
* '''Educational activities''' dedicated to the education and training of new recruits of Czech foreign service and to update skills of civil servants. Institute also cooperate with Metropolitan University Prague in Doctoral Degree Specialisations in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mup.cz/en/study-information.html |title=Study Information - Metropolitní univerzita Praha |publisher=Mup.cz |date= |accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Conference activities''' organized by the Institute for the general public. Number of conferences, round tables, presentations and discussions organized or co-organized by the IIR (for example the [[Prague European Summit]]) continues to grow ( 22 in 2007, 36 in 2008, 43 in 2009, 45 in 2010, 60 in 2012, i.e. more than one per week).&lt;ref name="dokumenty-iir.cz"/&gt;

The '''International Simultaneous Policy Organisation''' (ISPO) is a voluntary organization that promotes the [[Simultaneous policy|Simultaneous Policy]] (Simpol) campaign. It was founded by British businessman,  [[John M Bunzl|John Bunzl]], in 2000.&lt;ref name="About Simpol-UK"&gt;About Simpol-UK: [http://uk.simpol.org/index.php?id=62 uk.simpol.org -  About Simpol-UK]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The ISPO describes itself as "a growing association of [[citizens]] world-wide who aim to use their [[voting|votes]] in a new, co-ordinated and effective way to drive all [[Nation state|nations]] to co-operate in solving our planetary crisis". It believes that transnational citizen action is vital because "[[globalization|global markets]] and [[multinational corporation]]s  so comprehensively overpower individual nations that no politician dares make the first move to solve global problems for fear of competitive disadvantage".&lt;ref name="A New Global Policy for Social Justice"&gt;[http://www.simpol.org/lang_2009/dossiers/dossier-UK/html-UK/news-UK.html ISPO: From Globalization to Sustainability - A New Global Policy for Social Justice]&lt;/ref&gt;

ISPO aims to overcomes this paralysis by bringing all nations to adopt in principle - and then to simultaneously implement - the  [[Simultaneous policy|Simultaneous Policy]] (Simpol), a range of democratically formulated regulations to bring about economic justice, environmental security and peace around the world.&lt;ref name="Event Detail"&gt;[http://www.ted.com/tedx/events/4431 TED.com - TEDxBerlin - Crossing Borders (2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

By supporting Simpol, ISPO's citizen-members pledge to vote in future elections for ANY political party or candidate - within reason - that has signed a pledge to implement Simpol's range of measures only when all or sufficient other governments have also signed. ISPO argues that, as more and more citizens act in this way, politicians will have no choice but to sign the Pledge if they wish to remain in office, or else they risk losing their seats to other politicians who have adopted it.  One of its slogans is "Use Your Vote to Take Back the World!"&lt;ref name="Campaign concept"&gt;[http://www.simpol.org.uk/index.php?id=8 Simpol.org -  Campaign concept]&lt;/ref&gt;

==What is ''Simultaneous Policy''?==
'''Simultaneous policy''' requires governments in all jurisdictions at once, worldwide, to implement a policy shift at once, so that none is disadvantaged or unfairly advantaged.

The idea of the need for simultaneity of sovereign state action is not itself a new idea - it is the basis of [[treaty]] and [[United Nations]] initiatives that nothing can be done on certain problems, such as [[disarmament]], until all major players agree to a common timetable of implementing solutions.

However, according to the process offered by ISPO, what appears to be new is that citizens who "adopt" the Simultaneous Policy (Simpol) take the formulation of global policy into their own hands.  Furthermore, according to ISPO, their adoption of Simpol represents their pledge to vote in future elections, not for a ''particular'' politician or political party, but for ANY politician or party - within reason - that pledges to implement Simpol's package of policies alongside other governments. With more and more parliamentary seats and even entire elections increasingly being won or lost on very small margins, a relatively small number of Simpol adopters have the opportunity, ISPO claims, to make it in the strong interests of all politicians and parties to pledge to implement Simpol's policy package while also making it potentially disastrous for them if they fail to do so. As such, ISPO claims that civil society, through its adoption of Simpol, can for the first time lead governments, rather than governments leading the people.

The [[International Labour Organization]] and [[GlobalGreens]] both recommend certain simultaneous policy initiatives, and closer coordination of their members in many nations.  Such cooperation is seen as a way to work within a competitive [[global market economy]] without disadvantaging the most 'progressive' players who strongly protect ecology and the worker.

Simultaneous initiatives are seen as a way to avoid [[Prisoner's dilemma]] type problems, wherein there is a strong reward for defecting, and a risk for going along with a proposed plan if there is even one defector.

Another example problem of this nature is [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] to domestic farmers.  A nation abolishing such subsidies stands to lose much of its [[family farm]] infrastructure to cheap imports unless a simultaneous initiative in another country, or in [[tax, tariff and trade]] to make up for lost subsidies, takes place.  As this example suggests, the policies that are put in place simultaneously may be more complex than initially realized, and may require the cooperation of multiple branches or levels of government within one country, in addition to global cooperation.

== Diversity of Support ==
Individuals and politicians who have adopted ISPO's simultaneous policy have come from all parts of the political spectrum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2359">'''Křesomysl''' was the fifth of the seven [[Bohemia]]n mythical princes between the (also mythical) founder of the [[Přemyslid dynasty]] [[Přemysl, the Ploughman|Přemysl the Ploughman]] and the first historical prince [[Bořivoj]]. The names of the princes were first recorded in [[Cosmas chronicle]] and then transmitted into most of the historical books of the 19th century including [[František Palacký]]'s ''The History of the Czech Nation in Bohemia and Moravia''.

One theory about the number of the princes is propped on the [[frescoes]] on the walls of the Rotunda in [[Znojmo]], [[Moravia]] but [[Anežka Merhautová]] claimed that the frescoes depict all the members of the Přemyslid dynasty including the Moravian junior princes.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Krzemieńska-Anežka Merhautová-[[Dušan Třeštík]]: "Moravští Přemyslovci ve znojemské rotundě", Praha 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the name ==

Křesomysl's name is thought to be derived from the old Slavonic words ''"křesat"'' meaning ''to strike a light'' and ''"mysl"'' meaning ''mind'' or ''spirit'' thus literally the name should have meant ''"lighting the mind"''. The suffix ''-mysl'' is also in the other mythical names Přemysl and Nezamysl. [[Záviš Kalandra]] thought the names of the seven princes were cryptic names of ancient Slavonic days of the week - Křesomysl being the fifth - Thursday, in Latin ''Iovis Dies'' whereas [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Thor]] were both gods of thunder the word ''"křesat"'' is explained here as ''to strike the lightnings''.&lt;ref&gt;Záviš Kalandra: "České pohanství", Praha 1947&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory says that the names were mistaken from a coherent and partly interrupted old Slavonic text.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimír Karbusický: Báje, mýty, dějiny.  Nejstarší české pověsti v kontextu evropské kultury, p.237, Praha 1995 [http://www.moraviamagna.cz/rodokmeny/r_2myty.htm#p5]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2893">The conference of the six [[Great power|Great Powers]] (which for the first time included [[Italy]]) which met at [[London]] in May, 1867, to settle the political order of northern [[Europe]] after the disruption of the [[German Confederation]] in 1866 is known as the '''London Conference of 1867'''.  It resulted in the [[Treaty of London (1867)|Treaty of London]] of May 11, 1867.  The immediate occasion of the conference was the necessity of settling the status of the [[Luxembourg|Grand Duchy of Luxemburg]], which, after the downfall of the [[Luxembourg Crisis|First Napoleon]], had been added to the dominions of the King of the [[Netherlands]] as a separate and [[Independence|independent state]] and made a member of the [[North German Confederation|German Confederation]].  Notwithstanding the dissolution of the confederation, Luxemburg continued to be occupied by Prussian troops, the [[Second French Empire|French government]] insisting upon the removal of these troops and threatening war to enforce the demand.  

The conference was called to avert the new danger to the peace of Europe, and it solved the problem by the statesmanlike device of placing the Grand Duchy under the collective guarantee of the Great Powers as a permanently neutralized territory.  The conference is notable for its clear recognition of the principle of neutralization and of the rights of a neutralized state, as well as the obligations incurred by the Powers joining in the collective guarantee. 

In an individual guarantee, such as that guaranteeing the neutrality of Belgium, powers which signed the treaty would be bound to individually defend a nation's neutrality regardless of the actions of the other signatories.  In a collective guarantee, such as this treaty with Luxemburg, the major signatories would act in concert or would not be required to act at all.  The distinction between individual and collective guarantee resulted in some confusion when the Germans invaded both Belgium and Luxemburg in August 1914. Since Germany inherited Prussia's 1867 commitment to a collective guarantee, by invading Luxemburg it rendered impossible any joint action in defense of Luxemburg's neutrality.  Britain was therefore not required to intervene to defend Luxemburg.  However, since Belgium was individually guaranteed by the major powers (including Britain), the British government felt obliged to defend its neutrality against German invasion.

'''Naqqar Khana''' ({{lang-hi|नक़्क़ार ख़ाना}}, {{lang-ur|{{nastaliq|نقّار خانہ}}}}) or '''Naubat Khana''' (Hindi: नौबत ख़ाना, Urdu: {{Nastaliq|نوبت خانہ}}) is a term for a drum house or orchestra pit during ceremonies.

==Important locations==

===Red Fort===
The pavilion named ''Naubat Khana'' in [[Red Fort]] in [[Delhi]] is near the entrance on the eastern side of the ten pillars lane, next to a different pavilion where royal palanquins and other paraphernalia were placed. It housed 18 kinds of musical instruments that used to form part of the royal entourage.

It was constructed in 1636 CE by the Mughals. After the end of their patronage, Naubat Khana fell into a state of disrepair and remained in that state for almost a century until a Britisher named George Fisher restored it in 1858 for the new ''Zilla School'' (district school).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Naubhatkana|url=http://www.maduraidirectory.com/palace/naub.php|work=maduraidirectory.com|accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of [[British Raj]], the place became dilapidated. The American Mission declined to take it as a gift due to its poor condition. The government used it as the police headquarters for some time, but currently it serves as a middle school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kedia|first=Lavika|title=Red Fort, the dying heritage|url=http://www.thesundayindian.com/en/story/red-fort-the-dying-heritage-/5/18171/|accessdate=10 March 2014|newspaper=The Sunday Indian|date=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, one of its side was painted white (from the original red) by [[Archaeological Survey of India]] as it is thought to be its original color.&lt;ref name="toi_white_wall"/&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7909">{{Prose|date=September 2009}}
'''Primosphere Limited Partnership''' was one of four companies bidding for Satellite Digital Audio Radio Service, or [[SDARS]], licenses in the [[United States]].  The service would have been an [[advertisement]]-supported [[Digital data|digital]] audio service with an emphasis on serving music [[radio format|genres]] that had lost exposure in the terrestrial radio market during that period, such as classic [[jazz]], "[[beautiful music]]," "[[pop standard]]s," and [[swing music]].  Two dedicated public radio talk channels were also proposed along with traditional [[talk radio]] channels.

==History==

1990: [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], known then as Satellite CD Radio, Inc., proposes the concept of a satellite-delivered digital radio service to the [[Federal Communications Commission]].

1991: [[New Jersey]] radio station WPAT switches [[Radio format|formats]] on both its [[WPAT (AM)|AM]] and [[WPAT-FM|FM]] stations from "beautiful music" to "[[adult contemporary]]" removing a [[high-fidelity]] [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] outlet for these formats in the [[New York metropolitan area]].

1993: Popular music radio station [[WBBR|WNEW]] in New York changes format from pop standards and swing music to business talk radio WBBR-AM.  [[WFME (AM)|WQXR]] changes call letters to WQEW and format to pop standards and unsuccessfully attempts to capture the WNEW and WPAT listener diaspora.

1995 January: The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) sets aside 50&amp;nbsp;MHz (2310&amp;nbsp;MHz through 2360&amp;nbsp;MHz) in the [[S-band]] for Satellite Digital Audio Radio Service, also known as [[SDARS]] and now commonly known as Satellite Radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dev.space.com/spacenews/archive95/sn1995.fff1476.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030606203904/http://dev.space.com/spacenews/archive95/sn1995.fff1476.html |archivedate=2003-06-06 |df= }} FCC sets aside spectrum for SDARS&lt;/ref&gt;

1996: [[WPAT-FM]] switches from music to Spanish language "adult contemporary" format.  Sister AM station WPAT switches to Mexican music format, then to Korean language, and eventually paid ethnic programming.

1996: [[Clifford Burnstein]], resident of New York and a partner in entertainment industry company Q-Prime, along with [[Peter Mensch]] bids $68 million for an SDARS license through holding company Primosphere Limited Partnership with the stated intention of restoring music genres no longer available in major radio markets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.observer.com/node/41262 Article about Primosphere L.P. that refers to its bid and XM/Sirius foreign ownership issues.&lt;/ref&gt;

1997 April: American Mobile Satellite Corporation and Satellite CD Radio, Inc. are each awarded SDARS licenses.  The companies eventually become known [[XM Satellite Radio]] and [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], respectively.  Primosphere and Digital Satellite Broadcasting Corporation are denied licenses by becoming third and fourth lowest bidders, respectively, during the auction.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

1997 October 27: The FCC formally dismisses Primosphere's and Digital Satellite Broadcasting Corporation's applications for an SDARS license.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Digest/1997/dd971028.html FCC Decision on Primosphere&lt;/ref&gt;

1997 November: Primosphere petitions the FCC to adopt foreign ownership restrictions for SDARS licensees in order to overturn both Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio's licenses.  XM at the time had a 20% stake owned by foreign-owned [[WorldSpace Satellite Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/908937/000095011701000648/0000950117-01-000648-0001.txt |title= 10-K405 |accessdate=2018-05-16 }} Primosphere petitions for foreign ownership restrictions on SDARS licensees.&lt;/ref&gt; 

1999 July: American Mobile Satellite buys the 20% share of XM Satellite Radio owned by the foreign-owned WorldSpace, effectively removing foreign ownership issues.

2001 March: Primosphere petitions the [[United States Court of Appeals]] to require the FCC to review its previous petition to require the FCC to adopt foreign ownership restrictions on SDARS licensees, now including just Sirius Satellite Radio.

2001 September 25: [[XM Satellite Radio]] officially launches.

2001 December: The company petitioned the FCC to reconsider its 1997 decision to dismiss the company's SDARS application.  The FCC reaffirmed its decision and sealed the company's fate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rwonline.com/dailynews/show_issue.cgi?year=2001&amp;month=12&amp;week=49 FCC Again Dismisses Primosphere&lt;/ref&gt;

2002 July 1: [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] officially launches after several technical and financial delays.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7796382_ITM Sirius Delays Launch To Conserve Funds&lt;/ref&gt;

2007 August 27: Primosphere files second comment concerning the merger of Sirius and XM Satellite Radio.&lt;ref&gt;http://siriusbuzz.com/primosphere-weighs-in-on-merger-again.php Primosphere weighs in on merger again (Siriusbuzz.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

Primosphere continued petitioning through 2004, when the company "submitted a motion to withdraw the Application for Review". But in February 2007, after the Sirius-XM merger announcement, "Primosphere decided to withdraw its withdrawal" because the FCC had not acted. The FCC had promised to "re-auction the [SDARS] license among the other existing applicants" if for any reason one of the other companies lost its license. Primosphere considered itself to be an applicant and requested half the S-band spectrum if the merger was approved. The company had already paid for launch fees for satellites, which would then be put in orbit, and Primosphere expected to have its service ready in five years, or sooner if Sirius-XM were to lease equipment for sending out their signals. In its FCC filing, Primosphere said, "A better way to avoid the anticompetitive effects of the proposed XM/Sirius merger would be to have a new competitor in the SDARS who could begin operating immediately."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.orbitcast.com/archives/primosphere-the-next-satellite-radio-service.html|title=Primosphere: The next satellite radio service?|publisher=orbitcast.com|date=2007-07-11|accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rwonline.com/article/7066|title=Primosphere Wants Back in Satellite Game|first=Leslie|last=Stimson|work=rwonline.com|date=2007-09-12|accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnstein and Mensch told ''[[Radio &amp; Records]]'' that they wanted the FCC to act as originally planned: making sure the two license holders were separate.  Burnstein believed the FCC was "uncomfortable with a single provider." He also pointed out that each of the four applicants paid $70,000, and Primosphere never had its deposit returned.

Burnstein said studios could be finished in six months. Primosphere would offer about 30 music channels, with advertising. The objective was "to serve the underserved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.orbitcast.com/archives/report-primosphere-wants-siriusxm-spectrum-forecasts-30-music-channels.html|title=Report: Primosphere wants Sirius-XM spectrum; Forecasts 30 music channels|first=Ryan|last=Saghir|publisher=orbitcast.com|date=2008-05-07|accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2009: Sirius/XM is required to lease 8% or 4 channels each to qualified groups as a condition of their merger.  This could open the door to Primophere leasing channels on XM and on Sirius existing radios for free to consumers (supported by commercials).

The '''Progress Party of Equatorial Guinea''' ({{lang-es|Partido del Progreso de Guinea Ecuatorial}}) is a pro-market, pro-democracy political party in [[Equatorial Guinea]].  It was founded shortly after the legalization of political parties in the early 1990s after a long period of highly authoritarian military rule.

The party leadership has declared a "[[government in exile]]" in [[Spain]], with party leader [[Severo Moto]], as "President." PP members who remain in Equatorial Guinea are heavily harassed and prosecuted.

In 2008, seven PPGE members were arrested in [[Malobo]] on charges of weapons possession, including Moto's former secretary [[Gerardo Angüe Mangue]]. The alleged owner of the weapons, Saturnino Ncogo, had died in prison within days of his arrest under suspicious circumstances. Authorities alleged he had thrown himself from the top bunk of his cell to commit suicide, but relatives received his body in an advanced state of decomposition, and no investigation was ever conducted.&lt;ref name="AI1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://report2009.amnesty.org/en/regions/africa/equatorial-guinea|title=Equatorial Guinea|author=|date=|work=|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|accessdate=19 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217101806/http://report2009.amnesty.org/en/regions/africa/equatorial-guinea|archivedate=17 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining six PPGE activists—Mangue, [[Cruz Obiang Ebele]], [[Emiliano Esono Michá]], [[Juan Ecomo Ndong]], [[Gumersindo Ramírez Faustino]], and Bonifacio Nguema Ndong—were tried alongside [[Simon Mann]], a UK national who had helped to organize a [[2004 Equatorial Guinea coup d'état attempt|2004 coup attempt]], despite their charges being wholly unrelated. The party members were given sentences of one to five years' imprisonment apiece.&lt;ref name="AI1" /&gt; Their imprisonment has been protested by the [[US State Department]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/160119.pdf |title=Equatorial Guinea |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[US State Department]] |accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Amnesty International]], the latter of which named the six men [[prisoners of conscience]].&lt;ref name="AI1" /&gt;

Owned by [[AT&amp;T]] and operated by Loral [[Skynet (satellite)|Skynet]] [[Hughes Communications|Hughes]], it was one of three Telstar 3 satellites, Preceded by [[Telstar 301]] in 1983 and Telstar 302 in 1984.

The satellite served as the U.S. west coast and mid-west home [[satellite television|satellite (C band)]] with 48 Transponders for the [[ABC Studios|ABC]] network from 1984 to 1993. The [[CBS]] network used the satellite from 1985 to 1993. It also served as telephone call transfer for remote areas until 1993.

Other entities that used the satellite included Group W, Wold/Keystone Communications (which used the satellite to feed [[Paramount Television Network|Paramount Television's]] syndicated output including Entertainment Tonight, Star Trek: The Next Generation, and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine), Compact Video, Lorimar-Telepictures, and [[Warner Bros]]. Television.

In 1987, Melvin Rosen and Stuart Levin acquired 17 transponders on Telstar 303 satellite for the purpose of creating the first and largest multi-channel pay-per-view satellite TV system to serve the C-band satellite TV market.     ln 1993 as the Satellite was about to retire, a group of business owners including [[Texas Instruments|General Instruments]], TVN Entertainment, Parallex Data Systems, and [http://www.R-T-Enterprises.com|R.T. Enterprises]  put together programs systems and home units to bring affordable IPPV (ImpulsePayPerView) and PPV (PayPerView) entertainment to the home. Acquiring Telstar 303 required moving it from 125 to 104 west and a little changing of internal code to extend battery life and accept its new job parameters.

The satellite was retired in 1999 and replaced by Telstar 401.&lt;ref name="T4"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krebs|first1=Gunter|title=dipl.phys|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/telstar-4.htm|website=Telstar4|accessdate=25 March 2016|ref=Telstar 401 402 403/402R}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three of the Telstar 4 series satellite met with disaster and are still in orbit as space junk.&lt;ref name="J1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDowell|first1=Jonathan|title=PhD|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|accessdate=25 March 2016|work=Quasars|agency=Harvard|date=Oct 2015|ref=Satallite Catalog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola|Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola]] (MPLA) came to power in 1975 the [[National Union of Angolan Workers]] (UNTA) became the sole [[national trade union centre]]. There is now an independent trade union centre as well, the [[General Centre of Independent and Free Unions of Angola]].

Trade union membership in Angola is limited both by the small formal economy, and the high unemployment rate within the sector. The Government of Angola is the largest employer within the country, and wages within the government are set yearly, with consultation from unions, but without direct negotiations.&lt;ref name = "ICTUR"/&gt;

The '''Umbrella for Democratic Change''' (UDC) is a [[political alliance]] in [[Botswana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-10-23-were-on-the-governments-hit-list-botswana-opposition-leader |title=We're on the government's hit list - Botswana opposition leader |last1=Mawarire |first1=Teldah  |last2= |first2= |date=23 October 2014 |website= |publisher=[[Mail and Guardian]] |accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The UDC was founded in November 2012 by members from various opposition parties, including the BDP and BMD. They rallied together in the run-up to the [[Botswana parliamentary election, 2014|2014 elections]] by the [[Botswana National Front]] (BNF), the [[Botswana Movement for Democracy]] and the [[Botswana People's Party]] with the aim of uniting the opposition in the [[Botswana parliamentary election, 2014|2014 elections]]. In February 2017 the [[Botswana Congress Party]], which contested the 2014 elections independently, joined the coalition. The coalition is currently led by [[Duma Boko]] from the BNF and plans to contest the 2019 general election jointly, standing a single opposition candidate in each constituency against the ruling [[Botswana Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-botswana-politics-idUSKBN15I2JN "Botswana opposition groups unite to challenge ruling BDP"], Reuters, 3 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization of the opposition parties presented an unprecedented challenge to the longtime-ruling [[Botswana Democratic Party]], but the BDP was victorious in elections held on October 24, 2014. Their vote share, which garnered 37 seats, allowed them to maintain a majority in the National Assembly, although it won fewer seats than it had in previous elections.

The UDC won 17 seats and the Botswana Congress Party won 3 seats. Khama was easily reelected by the legislative body to another term as president.{{cn|date= October 2017}}
