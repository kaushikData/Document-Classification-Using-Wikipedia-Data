The 2015 Kerala [[Meteoroid#fireball|fireball]] was a midair [[meteor]] blast that occurred during its descent to Earth over [[Kerala]] state in [[India]] on 27 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=‘Fireball in sky’ triggers panic in city| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/fireball-in-sky-triggers-panic-in-city/article6943867.ece |accessdate=28 February 2015| newspaper=The Hindu| format=updated 2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial reports ==
The fireball, reportedly accompanied by a [[sonic boom]], was noticed across the sky in parts of [[Thrissur]], [[Ernakulam]], [[Palakkad]], [[Kozhikode]] and [[Malappuram]] districts of [[Kerala]] at around 22:00 PM [[Indian Standard Time|IST]](local time, UTC +5.30 hours) for about 5 to 6 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Panic among residents as fireballs light up Kerala sky| url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panic-among-residents-as-fireballs-light-up-kerala-sky/article1-1321825.aspx| accessdate=| newspaper=Hindustan Times| date=2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial reports suggested that it may have been a part of a rocket body used to launch the [[Yaogan]] Weixing-26, a Chinese satellite launched in December 2014.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Later, the Meteorology Department and Disaster Management Authority of Kerala refuted the theory stating that if this was the case, it should have been spotted by the meteorology radars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Many Theories as Fireballs Light Up Kerala Sky| url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/Many-Theories-as-Fireballs-Light-Up-Kerala-Sky/2015/02/28/article2690565.ece |accessdate=| newspaper=New Indian Express| date=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact sites==
Meteorites (meteoroid debris) hit multiple places in [[Ernakulam]] district. Small fragments which are believed to be parts of the [[meteoroid]] were recovered from Valamboor, near [[Kolenchery]], and [[Kuruppampady]], near [[Perumbavoor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=It was a meteoroid, experts conclude| url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/it-was-a-meteoroid-experts-conclude/article6947778.ece| date=1 March 2015| newspaper=The Hindu| accessdate=2015-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team of scientists from the State Emergency Operations Centre (SEOC) and [[Geological Survey of India]] visited the impact sites and collected samples for analysis. A preliminary report  indicated that the fragments' chemical composition consist of [[nickel]] and [[iron ore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Scientists Examine ‘Rocks’, Confirm Kerala Meteor Fall| url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/Scientists-Examine-%E2%80%98Rocks%E2%80%99-Confirm-Kerala-Meteor-Fall/2015/03/02/article2693783.ece| accessdate=8 March 2015| newspaper=The New Indian Express| date=2015-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Abarbarea''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Ἀβαρβαρέα) was a [[naiad]] [[nymph]] and one of the three ancestors of the [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyrians]], along with [[Callirrhoe (Oceanid)|Callirrhoe]] and [[Drosera (naiad)|Drosera]]. These nymphs were joined to sons of the soil [[Autochthon (ancient Greece)|(autochthonous]]) by the god [[Eros]] who was angered by their chastity.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;[[Nonnus]]. ''[[Dionysiaca]], [https://topostext.org/work/529#40.510 40.535 ff] {{PD-notice}}''&lt;/ref&gt; She was not to be confused with another [[Abarbarea (wife of Bucolion)|Abarbarea]], the wife of [[Bucolion]]. 

== Mythology ==

In [[Nonnus]]' ''[[Dionysiaca]]''. Abarbarea was mentioned in the following text:

: ''"There, Lord Dionysos, I have told you of the soilbred race of the Earthborn, self born, Olympian, that you might know how the Tyrian breed of your ancestors sprang out of the earth. Now I will speak of the fountains. In the olden days they were chaste maidens primeval, but hot Eros was angered against their maiden girdles, and drawing a shaft of love he spoke thus to the marriage-hating nymphs: ' Naiad Abarbarea, so fond of your maidenhood, you too receive this shaft, which all nature has felt. Here I will build Callirhoe's bridechamber, here I will sing Drosera's wedding hymn ... and from his [i.e. Eros] backbent bow let fly three shots. Then in that watery bower he joined in love sons of the soil to the Naiads, and sowed the divine race of your family.'"''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1795">The '''anacoustic zone''', also known as the zone of silence, is the region of the [[atmosphere of Earth]] above about {{convert|160|km|mi|sp=us}} where the [[air density]] becomes so low that air molecules are not close enough to support transmission of [[sound]] waves within the hearing range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/anacoustic_zone.html | title = Anacoustic zone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dt7ow1Af86YC&amp;pg=PA18 | page = 18 | title = The complete book of spaceflight: from Apollo 1 to zero gravity | isbn = 978-0-471-05649-2 | author1 = Darling, David | author2 = Darling, David J | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As altitude increases through the atmosphere, the first sound waves to disappear are the high pitched, high-frequency (short wavelength) ones. At a certain altitude (roughly {{convert|160|km|mi|sp=us}}) even the lowest frequency tone that can be heard by a human being (around 20&amp;nbsp;Hz) no longer can be transmitted.

With increasing height, the atmosphere becomes more rarefied, which increases the mean time between collisions of molecules (also known as [[Mean free time]]). The maximum frequency a sound wave can have and still be able to propagate in a gas is roughly the inverse of the mean free time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is there an upper frequency limit to ultrasound?|url=http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/23418/is-there-an-upper-frequency-limit-to-ultrasound|publisher=stackexchange.com|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (molecular [[mean free path]] divided by average molecular speed). Hence the more rarefied a gas medium, the lower is the cut-off frequency for sound propagation in that medium.

[[File:Siquijor Anito. (5077313419).jpg|thumb|''Taotao'' carvings sold in a souvenir shop in [[Siquijor Island]]]]
'''''Anito''''', also spelled '''''anitu''''', refers to [[ancestor spirit]]s, [[nature spirit]]s, and deities (''[[diwata]]'') in the indigenous [[Animism|animistic]] religions of [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|precolonial Philippines]]. It can also refer to carved humanoid figures, the '''''taotao''''', made of wood, stone, or ivory, that represent these spirits.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;

'''''Pag-anito''''' refers to a [[séance]], often accompanied by other rituals or celebrations, in which a shaman ([[Visayan languages|Visayan]]: ''[[babaylan]]'', [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''[[katalonan]]'') acts as a [[mediumship|medium]] to communicate directly with the spirits. When a nature spirit or deity is specifically involved, the ritual is called '''''pagdiwata'''''. The act of worship or a religious sacrifice to a spirit is also sometimes simply referred to as ''anito''.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Henry Scott  | authorlink = William Henry Scott (historian)   | url = https://archive.org/details/BarangaySixteenthCenturyPhilippineCultureAndSociety | title = Barangay: Sixteenth Century Philippine Culture and Society  | publisher = Ateneo de Manila University Press  | date = 1994  | location = Quezon City  | isbn = 9715501354 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SoulBook1991"&gt;{{cite book |url= |title=The Soul Book: Introduction to Philippine Pagan Religion | last1 =  Demetrio | first1 = Francisco R. | last2 =  Cordero-Fernando | first2 = Gilda | last3 = Nakpil-Zialcita | first4 = Fernando| last4 =  Feleo | first3 = Roberto B.  |date= 1991 |publisher=  GCF Books, Quezon City |year= |isbn= |editor-last= |editor-first= |edition= |volume= |location= |pages= |authorlink2= Gilda Cordero-Fernando| asin=B007FR4S8G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rosa"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antonio Sánchez de la Rosa|title =Diccionario Hispano-Bisaya para las provincias de Samar y Leyte, Volumes 1-2|publisher =Tipo-Litografia de Chofre y Comp.|year =1895|page=414|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=7EwHAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The belief in ''anito'' is sometimes referred to as '''anitism''' in scholarly literature (Spanish: ''anitismo'' or ''anitería'').&lt;ref name="hislop"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stephen K.

===Ancestor spirits===

The ''ninunò'' (lit. "ancestor") can be the spirits of actual ancestors or generalized guardian spirits of a family. Ancient Filipinos believed that upon death, the [[Astral body|soul]] (Visayan: ''kalag''; Tagalog: ''kaluluwa'')&lt;ref group="note"&gt;It should be noted that among most Filipino ethnic groups, a person is believed to be composed of at least two souls - the breath of life, will, or awareness (''ginhawa'' or ''hininga'', which stays with the living body) and the [[Astral body|astral soul]] (which can travel to the spirit world). ''Kalag'' and ''kaluluwa'' refer to the latter. The concept of [[soul dualism]] is sometimes referred to as "twin souls" or "double souls" and is a common belief in Austronesian cultures and other [[shamanistic]] cultures. Other names for the astral soul include ''kaluha'', ''dungan'' (Visayan); ''kalag'' ([[Bicolano people|Bicol]]); ''linnawa'' ([[Igorot people|Igorot]]), ''kaduwa'' ([[Isneg people|Isneg]]), ''ab-abiik'' ([[Kankanaey people|Kankanaey]]), ''karurua'' ([[Ilocano people|Ilocano]]), ''ikaruruwa'' ([[Ibanag people|Ibanag]]), ''karaduwa'' ([[Mangyan people|Mangyan]]), ''kiyaraluwa'' ([[Tagbanwa people|Tagbanwa]]), ''makatu'' ([[Bukidnon people|Bukidnon]]), and ''kadengan-dengan'' or ''gimokud'' ([[Manobo people|Manobo]]). (Scott, 1994; Tan, 2008; Mercado, 1991) Most of the terms for the astral soul literally translate to "twin" or "double", from PAN *duSa, "two".

There can be multiple locations in the spirit world, varying in different ethnic groups.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Compare with the [[Greek underworld]]&lt;/ref&gt; Which place souls end up in depends on how they died, the age at death, or the conduct of the person when they were alive. There was no concept of heaven or hell prior to the introduction of [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]];&lt;ref group="note"&gt;After Spanish contact, various spirit worlds were syncretized into the Christian concept of heaven and hell in dictionaries and Bible translations. They struggled in determining which terminology to use because of the absence of the [[Black-and-white dualism|heaven and hell dichotomy]] in the Filipino concept of the spirit world. Spanish missionaries and European authors usually equated heaven with ''maca'' and ''calualhatian''; and hell with ''casan'' (also ''casanaan'', ''casauaan'', or ''catanaan''; sometimes misread as ''kasamaan''). However, in the [[Boxer Codex]] ''maca'' and ''casan'' were synonyms for the Visayan and Tagalog [[underworld]]s. The 1754 version of ''[[Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala]]'' used ''casanaan'' for both heaven and hell; with ''casanaan nang hirap'' as hell, and ''casanaan nang tova'' as heaven. ''Calualhatian'' (modern spelling: ''kaluwalhatian'') was simply a region in the Tagalog spirit world that souls can enter by crossing a torrential river on a narrow plank. (Rath, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; rather, the spirit world is usually depicted as an [[otherworld]] that exists alongside the material world. Souls reunite with deceased relatives in the spirit world and lead normal lives in the spirit world as they did in the material world. In some cases, the souls of evil people undergo penance and cleansing before they are granted entrance into a particular spirit realm. Souls would eventually [[Reincarnation|reincarnate]] after a period of time in the spirit world.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="under"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aswangproject.com/how-to-travel-the-underworld-of-philippine-mythology/|title=How to Travel the Underworld of Philippine Mythology|publisher=The Aswang Project|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rath"&gt;{{cite book|author=Imke Rath|editor =Astrid Windus &amp; Eberhard Crailsheim|title =Image - Object - Performance: Mediality and Communication in Cultural Contact Zones of Colonial Latin America and the Philippines|chapter =Depicting Netherworlds, or the Treatment of the Afterlife in a Colonial Contact Zone: The Paete Case|publisher =Waxmann Verlag|series =|year =2013|isbn =9783830979296|url = https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=qWVfAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Souls in the spirit world still retain a degree of influence in the material world, and vice versa. ''Pag-anito'' may be used to invoke good ancestor spirits for protection, intercession (''kalara'' or ''kalda''), or advice. Ancestor spirits that become intercessors with deities are known as ''pintakasi'' or ''pitulon''.

The ''diwata'' are spirits who have never been human. These spirits can range from simple spirits like the ''diwata'' of a particular rock or place,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;e.g. ''[[Nuno sa punso]]'', a dwarf-like ''anito'' that lives in anthills; and [[Maria Makiling|Dayang Masalanta]], the Tagalog ''diwata'' of [[Mount Makiling]]&lt;/ref&gt; to deities who [[Anthropomorphism|personify]] abstract concepts and natural phenomena,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;e.g. [[Mayari]], the Tagalog goddess of the moon; and [[Makapatag]], the Visayan god of vengeance&lt;/ref&gt;  to deities who are part of an actual [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;e.g. [[Bathala]], the chief deity of the Tagalogs; [[Magbabaya]], the supreme creator of the [[Lumad]] people; and [[Pilandok]], [[trickster spirit]] of the [[Maranao people|Maranao]]&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known as ''dewatu'', ''divata'', ''duwata'', ''ruwata'', ''dewa'', ''dwata'', ''diya'', etc., in various Philippine languages; all of which are derived from [[Religious syncretism|syncretization]] with [[Sanskrit]] ''[[devata]]'' or ''[[wiktionary:deva#Etymology|devá]]'', meaning "deity". In some ethnic groups like the [[B'laan people|B'laan]] and the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]]s, ''Diwata'' refers to the [[God|supreme being]] in their pantheon,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Tagalogs differentiated between Diwata, the universal supreme being, and [[Bathala]], the supreme deity exclusive to them (Hislop, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; in which case all the other spirits, whether human or not, are known generically as ''anito''.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt; Like in ancestor spirits, ''diwata'' are referred to in polite [[Kinship terminology|kinship titles]] when addressed directly, like ''apo'' ("elder") or ''nuno'' ("grandparent").&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kroeber"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The most widespread names for these spirits in various Philippine ethnic groups are ''diwata'' or ''anito''. Other names of ''diwata'' or specific types of ''diwata'' include ''fieu awas'', ''kahoynon'' ([[B'laan people|B'laan]]); ''mahomanay'', ''tahamaling'' (Bagobo); ''panya'en'' ([[Batak people (Philippines)|Batak]]); ''tawong lipod'', ''magindara'' ([[Bikol people|Bikol]]); ''magtitima'', ''tawo sa talonan'' ([[Bukidnon people|Bukidnon]]); ''aled'' ([[Gaddang people|Gaddang]]); ''annani'' ([[Ibanag people|Ibanag]]); ''bakayauwan'', ''monduntug'', ''palasekan'', ''pili'', ''pinading'' ([[Ifugao people|Ifugao]]); ''mangmangkit'', ''katataoan''/''katawtaw-an'', ''kibaan'', ''litao'' ([[Ilocano people|Ilocano]]); ''apdel'', ''sasailo'' ([[Itneg people|Itneg]]); ''tumungaw'' ([[Kankana-ey people|Kankana-ey]]); ''laman labuad'', ''manglilili'' ([[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]]); ''kama-kama''/''kamakaon'' ([[Karay-a people|Karay-a]]); ''tuglinsau'', ''tagbusau'', ''mandangum'' ([[Mandaya people|Mandaya]]); ''andagaw'' ([[Mangyan people|Mangyan]]); ''tawagenen'', ''manaog'' ([[Manobo people|Manobo]]); ''karibang'' ([[Maranao people|Maranao]]); ''kaybaan'' ([[Pangasinan people|Pangasinan]]); ''kamanan-daplak'' ([[Sambal people|Sambal]]); ''dayamdam'', ''piritay'' ([[Tagalog people|Tagalog]]); ''tawo sa talonan'' ([[Tagbanwa people|Tagbanwa]]); ''lewenri'', ''bawa'', ''katao''/''kataw'', ''tumawo''/''tamawo'', ''tawong lupa'' (Visayan); and ''guban-on'', ''digkusanon'', ''dalaketnon'' ([[Waray people|Waray]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three general types of non-human spirits. The first are the environmental or nature spirits "bound" to a particular location or natural phenomenon (similar to [[genii loci]]). They "own" places and concepts like agricultural fields, forests, cliffs, seas, winds, lightning, or realms in the spirit world. Some were also "keepers" or [[totem]]s of various animals and plants. They have inhuman and abstract qualities, reflecting their particular dominions. They do not normally appear in human form and are usually gender-less or androgynous. They rarely concern themselves with human affairs. Rituals involving these spirits are almost always conducted outdoors.&lt;ref name="buen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="novellino"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dario Novellino|editor =David G.

The second type of spirits are the "unbound" spirits which have independent existence. They appear in animal (usually as birds) or human-like forms, have gender differentiation, and have personal names. They are most similar to the [[fairies]] of European folklore.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;With strong parallels to human-like beings like [[Elf|elves]] and ''[[aos sí]]'', as well as diminutive human-like beings like [[Brownie (folklore)|brownies]] and [[pixie]]s. (Buenconsejo, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; These are the most common types of spirits to become ''abyan'' ([[spirit guide]]s of ''[[babaylan]]''), as they are the most "sociable" and can take interest in human activities. These spirits are usually referred to as ''engkanto'' (from Spanish ''encanto'') in modern Filipino folklore. Unlike the "bound" spirits, these spirits can be invited into human households, and their rituals can take place both outdoors and indoors.&lt;ref name="buen"/&gt;
[[File:Ato the Fertility God of the Bontoc Tribe.jpg|left|thumb|Ato, a fertility god of the [[Bontoc people]]]]
The last is a class of malevolent spirits or demons, as well as supernatural beings, generally collectively known as ''aswang'', ''yawa'', or ''mangalos'' (also ''mangalok'', ''mangangalek'', or ''magalos'') among Tagalogs and Visayans. There are numerous kinds of ''aswang'' with specific abilities, behavior, or appearance. Examples include ''[[sigbin]]'', ''[[wakwak]]'', ''[[tiyanak]]'', and ''[[manananggal]]''. The first two categories of ''diwata'' can also be malevolent, what sets the third category apart is that they can not be appealed to with offerings and they are utterly pitiless. Most practices associated with them is to ward them off, banish them, or destroy them. They are never addressed nor worshiped in religious rituals.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kroeber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rodell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;

''Diwata'' are rarely spoken about openly for fear of attracting their attention. Instead they are referred to with [[euphemism]]s like "those unlike us" (Visayan: ''dili ingon nato'', Tagalog: ''hindi kagaya natin'') or various names, like ''banwaanon'' or ''taga-banwa'',&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Not to be confused with the [[Tagbanwa people|Tagbanwa]] and [[Mamanwa peope|Mamanwa]] ethnic groups, all derived from [[Proto-Austronesian language|PAN]] ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Austronesian/banua|*banua]]'', "home" or "homeland". In modern Filipino languages, ''banwa'' has been supplanted by Spanish ''[[wikt:lugar|lugar]]'', thus ''taglugar'' is used in place of ''tagabanwa'' (Hislop, 1971; Tan, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; that translate literally to "dweller of a place".&lt;ref name="bis"&gt;{{cite we|url=http://www.binisaya.com/cebuano/dili-ingon-nato|title=Dili-ingon-nato|publisher=Binisaya.com|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gat"&gt;{{cite thesis |type=PhD |author=Augusto Jose B.

''Diwata'' exist in both the material world and the spirit world. They can be formless or have a material body. They can also take over a body through [[spirit possession]] (Visayan: ''hola'', ''hulak'', ''tagdug'', or ''saob''; Tagalog: ''sanib''), an ability essential for the [[séance]]s in ''pag-anito''. They are believed to be capable of [[shapeshifting]] (''baliw'' or ''baylo''), becoming invisible, or creating visions or illusions (''anino'' or ''landung'', lit. "shadow"). Their powers, however, are limited to their particular domain. A ''diwata'' of a forest, for instance, has no dominion over the sea. Most are generally benevolent or capriciously neutral, although they can cause misfortunes and illnesses if angered, disrespected, or mistakenly encountered.&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kroeber"&gt;{{cite journal|author=A.

They are also said to be annoyed by perfume, as well as salt and spices. (Buenconsejo, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Diwata'' who take human form are said to be pale-skinned and could be distinguished from humans by the absence of a [[philtrum]] on the upper lip.&lt;ref name="mccoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buen"/&gt;

''Diwata'' are often depicted as appearing to unsuspecting people in human or animal form, sometimes causing unintentional harm. They can also deliberately play tricks on mortals, like seducing or abducting beautiful men and women into the spirit world.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buen"/&gt; Certain places are believed to be owned by ''diwata'' or are borders to the spirit world.

To avoid inadvertently angering a ''diwata'', Filipinos perform a customary ''pasintabi sa nuno'' ("respectfully apologizing or asking permission from ancestors for passing").&lt;ref group="note"&gt;From ''sintabi'', "to respectfully ask permission" or "to give due respect", cf. "[[wikt:excuse me|excuse me]]"&lt;/ref&gt; This is done by saying the phrases "''tao po''" ("a human [is passing], elder), "''tabi po''" or "''tabi apo''" ("by your permission, elder")&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]], the traditional phrase is "''bari bari, apo''", with the same meaning (Tan, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; when passing by a place believed to  be inhabited by a ''diwata''.&lt;ref name="potet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tan"/&gt;

''Diwata'' are also believed to be able to mate with humans. People born with [[congenital disorder]]s (like [[albinism]] or [[syndactyly]]) or display unusual beauty or behavior are commonly believed by local superstition to be the children of ''diwata'' who seduced (or sometimes raped) their mothers.&lt;ref name="albino"&gt;{{cite news |title=Magkakapatid na albino, anak ng engkanto? |url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/life/06/19/17/magkakapatid-na-albino-anak-ng-engkanto |accessdate=23 November 2018 |work=Patrol.ph |agency=ABS-CBN News |date=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rapalbino"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Santisteban |first1=Bong |title=What it's like to live with albinism |url=https://www.rappler.com/rappler-blogs/204807-living-with-albinism-story |accessdate=23 November 2018 |work=Rappler |date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancestor spirits were usually represented by carved figures. These were known as ''taotao'' ("little human", also ''taotaohan'', ''latawo'', ''tinatao'', or  ''tatao''),&lt;ref group="note"&gt;From Proto-Malayo-Polynesian ''*tau'', ultimately from [[Proto-Austronesian]] ''*Cau'', "human" or "person"&lt;/ref&gt; ''bata-bata'' ("little child"), ''ladaw'' ("image" or "likeness"; also ''laraw'', ''ladawang'', ''lagdong'', or ''larawan''), or ''likha'' ("creation"; also ''likhak'') in most of the Philippines.

''Taotao'' were usually austere roughly-carved figures made from wood, stone, or ivory. Some ''taoatao'' encountered by the Spanish were made from precious metals or ornamented with gold and jewelry, but these were very rare.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="agon"&gt;{{cite book|author=Teodoro A. Agoncillo|title =Introduction to Filipino History|publisher =Radiant Star Pub.|year =1974|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Taotao'' were almost always depicted in the squatting position with the arms crossed over the knees, which is reminiscent of the [[fetal position]], the everyday conversing posture, and the position bodies are arranged during death among Ancient Filipinos.

In very rare cases, ''diwata'' can be depicted as ''taotao'' in [[anthropomorphic]] form, as [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]]s or legendary creatures, or as animals.&lt;ref name="potet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cm"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cordilleranmuseum.weebly.com/gallery-of-exhibits.html|title=Gallery of Exhibits|publisher=Museum of Cordilleran Sculpture|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include a special class of figures called ''hipag'' among the Igorot which depict war deities, as well as ''kinabigat'' (carved houseposts) and ''hogang'' (carved [[tree fern]] posts used as boundary markers and as wards against harm).&lt;ref name="cm"/&gt; As a rule, however, ''diwata'' are not usually depicted as ''taotao'' or by any man-made representations.&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;

''Taotao'' were not intrinsically sacred. They were representations of the spirits, not the actual spirits themselves. They only became sacred during their use in a ''pag-anito'' ritual. Without the spirit they represent, they are treated as mundane carved pieces of wood or sculpted stone. The anonymous author of the 1572 ''Relación de la conquista de la isla de Luzón'' describes ''pag-anito'' rituals of the Tagalog people as such:&lt;ref name="B&amp;R3Anonymous1572"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Relation of the Conquest of the Island of Luzon|work=The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898|publisher=Arthur H. Clark Company|year=1903|isbn=|editor-last=Blair|editor-first=Emma Helen|editor-link=Emma Helen Blair|volume=3|location=Ohio, Cleveland|pages=145|editor-last2=Robertson|editor-first2=James Alexander|editor-link2=James Alexander Robertson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"When any [[datu|chief]] is ill, he invites his kindred and orders a great meal to be prepared, consisting of fish, meat, and wine. When the guests are all assembled and the feast set forth in a few plates on the ground inside the house, they seat themselves also on the ground to eat. In the midst of the feast (called [[babaylan|manganito or baylán]] in their tongue), they put the idol called [[Bathala|Batala]] and certain aged women who are considered as priestesses, and some aged Indians—neither more nor less. They offer the idol some of the food which they are eating, and call upon him in their tongue, praying to him for the health of the sick man for whom the feast is held. The natives of these islands have no altars nor temples whatsoever. This manganito, or drunken revel, to give it a better name, usually lasts seven or eight days; and when it is finished they take the idols and put them in the corners of the house, and keep them there without showing them any reverence."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regardless, very old ''taotao'' handed down through generations are prized as family heirlooms. Among the Igorot, pieces of ''taotao'' may also be chipped off and boiled into a medicinal tea.&lt;ref name="cm"/&gt;

''Taotao'' were commonly kept in corners or small shelves inside houses or granaries. Spanish missionaries recorded that ''taotao'' were present in every Filipino household, no matter how poor.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zaide"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregorio F. Zaide|title =Philippine Political and Cultural History|volume= Volume 1|publisher =Philippine Education Company|series =Philippine Political and Cultural History|year =1975|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blumetritt"/&gt;

When Spanish missionaries arrived in the Philippines, the word "''anito''" came to be associated with these physical representations of spirits that featured prominently in ''pag-anito'' rituals. During the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American rule of the Philippines (1898–1946)]], the meaning of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''idolo'' ("a thing worshiped") was further conflated with the English word "[[Cult image|idol]]". Thus in the [[Filipino language|modern Filipino language]], ''anito'' has come to refer almost exclusively to the carved ''taotao'' figures, instead of the actual spirits themselves.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sawyer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederic H. Sawyer|title =The Inhabitants of the Philippines|publisher =Charles Scribner's Sons|year =1900|url =https://archive.org/details/inhabitantsofphi00sawy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Altars and sacred areas===
[[File:Enchanted Balete Tree in Lazi.JPG|thumb|''[[Diwata]]'' are believed to inhabit this 400-year old [[balete tree|''balete'' tree]] in [[Lazi, Siquijor]] with a [[natural spring]] between its roots]]
Ancient Filipinos did not have temples or permanent buildings of worship.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blumetritt"/&gt; However, they did have semi-permanent [[spirit house]]s. They can range in size from small roofed platforms to structures similar to a small house (but with no walls). These were known as ''magdantang'' in Visayan and ''ulango'' or ''simbahan'' in Tagalog.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Among the [[Itneg people|Itneg]], spirit houses are known ''tangpap'', ''pangkew'', or ''alalot'' (for various small roofed altars); and ''balaua'' or ''kalangan'' (for larger structures). In [[Mindanao]], spirit houses are known among the [[Subanen people|Subanen]] as ''maligai'' ; among the [[Teduray people|Teduray]] as ''tenin''  (only entered by shamans); and among the [[Bagobo people|Bagobo]] as ''buis'' (for those built near roads and villages) and ''parabunnian'' (for those built near rice fields).(Kroeber, 1918)&lt;/ref&gt; They can also be used as places to store ''taotao''. Among Bicolanos, ''taotao'' were also kept inside sacred caves called ''moog''.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kroeber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cole"/&gt;&lt;ref name="storch"/&gt;

During certain ceremonies, ''anito'' are venerated through temporary altars near sacred places. These were called ''latangan'' in Visayan and ''[[dambana]]'' or ''lambana'' in Tagalog.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Also ''saloko'' or ''palaan'' ([[Itneg people|Itneg]]); ''sakolong'' ([[Bontoc people|Bontoc]]); ''salagnat'' (Bicolano); ''sirayangsang'' ([[Tagbanwa people|Tagbanwa]]);  ''ranga'' (Teduray); and ''tambara'', ''tigyama'', or ''balekat'' ([[Bagobo people|Bagobo]])&lt;/ref&gt; These bamboo or [[rattan]] altars are identical in basic construction throughout most of the Philippines. They were either small roof-less platforms or standing poles split at the tip (similar to a [[tiki torch]]). They held halved coconut shells, metal plates, or [[Tapayan#Martaban|''martaban'' jars]] as receptacles for offerings. ''Taotao'' may sometimes also be placed on these platforms.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kroeber"/&gt;

Other types of sacred places or objects of worship of ''diwata'' include the material manifestation of their realms. The most widely venerated were [[balete tree|''balete'' trees]] (also called ''nonok'', ''nunuk'', ''nonoc'', etc.) and [[anthill]]s or [[termite mound]]s (''punso''). Other examples include mountains, waterfalls, tree groves, reefs, and caves.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="potet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="agon2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="demetrio73"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Francisco R.

===Spirit animals===
Some animals like [[crocodile]]s, snakes, [[monitor lizard]]s, [[tokay gecko]]s, and various birds were also venerated as servants or manifestations of ''diwata'', or as powerful spirits themselves. These include legendary creatures like the dragon or serpent [[Bakunawa]], the giant bird [[Minokawa]] of the Bagobo, and the colorful [[Sarimanok]] of the Maranao.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="potet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="agon2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Teodoro A.

[[Omen]] birds were particularly important. The most common omen birds were doves with green or blue iridescent feathers called ''limokon'' (usually the [[common emerald dove]], [[imperial pigeon]]s, or [[brown dove]]s).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Limokon'' in most of Visayas and among the [[Lumad]]; also ''alimúkun'' ([[Cebuano people|Cebuano]]), ''alimúkeng'' (Ilocano); ''limoken'' (Maranao); ''lemuguen'' ([[Teduray people|Teduray]]); and ''limukun'' ([[Subanen people|Subanen]])&lt;/ref&gt; Other omen birds include [[fairy-bluebird]]s (''[[tigmamanukan]]'', ''balan tikis'', ''balatiti'', or ''bathala'' among Tagalogs; and ''batala'' among [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]]s); [[kingfisher]]s (''salaksak'' among the Ilocano, Igorot, and [[Sambal people|Sambal]]); and [[flowerpecker]]s (''pitpit'', ''ichaw'', ''ido'', or ''labeg'' among the Igorot).&lt;ref name="potet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kroeber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forth"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregory Forth|editor =Sonia Tidemann &amp; Andrew Gosler|title =Ethno-ornithology: Birds, Indigenous Peoples, Culture and Society|chapter =What's in a Bird's Name: Relationships among Ethno-ornithological Terms in Nage and Other Malayo-Polynesian Languages|publisher =Earthscan|year =2012|isbn =9781849774758|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=8u2nUWLYx18C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rituals and shamans==
{{Main|Babaylan|Catalonan}}
[[File:A Tinguian making an offering to the guardian stones. Wellcome M0005692.jpg|thumb|A 1922 photograph of an [[Itneg people|Itneg]] shaman making an offering to an ''apdel'', a guardian ''anito'' of her village. ''Apdel'' are believed to reside in the water-worn stones known as ''pinaing''.&lt;ref name="cole"/&gt;]]
Anitism was not a religion about worship. Aside from good ancestor spirits and the few benevolent ''diwata'', most ''anito'' were feared, not venerated. To an ordinary person, ''diwata'' were regarded as dangerous beings to be avoided or appeased. When interaction was necessary, they performed a ritual known as ''pag-anito'' (also ''mag-anito'' or ''anitohan''). These are usually directed at ancestor spirits. When the ''pag-anito'' ceremony is for a ''diwata'', the ritual is known as ''pagdiwata'' (also ''magdiwata'' or ''diwatahan'').&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;

Minor ''pag-anito'' rituals like praying for better weather or banishing minor ill luck can be performed by any householder. However, major ''pag-anito'' rituals required the services of the community [[shaman]] (Visayan ''babaylan'' or ''baylan''; Tagalog ''katalonan'' or ''manganito'').&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Other terms include ''balyana'', ''paraanito'', or ''paradiwata'' (Bicolano); ''balian'', ''balyan'', or ''mabalian'' ([[Lumad]]); ''balian'' or ''tanguilin'' (Subanen); ''bawalyan'' or ''babaylan'' ([[Tagbanwa people|Tagbanwa]]); ''beljan'' ([[Palawan people|Palaw'an]]); ''baglan'', ''mangoodan'', or ''manilao'' (Ilocano);''bahasa'' ([[Yakan people|Yakan]]); ''[[dukun]]'', ''kalamat'', or ''papagan'' (Sama-Bajau); ''mandadawak'', ''dawak'', ''insupak'', ''mon-lapu'', ''tumunoh'', ''alpogan'', or ''mumbaki'' ([[Igorot people|Igorot]]); ''anitu'' ([[Aeta people|Aeta]]); and ''ma-aram'' ([[Karay-a people|Karay-a]])&lt;/ref&gt;

These shamans were believed to have been "chosen" by a specific ''diwata'' who become their [[spirit guide]]s.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Terms for [[spirit guide]]s of shamans include ''bantay'', ''abyan'' (Visayan); ''alagad'', ''gabay'' (Tagalog); ''abyan'', ''umli'', ''sugujen'', or ''inajew'' (Lumad); ''saro'' (Bicolano); and ''jinn'' (Sama-Bajau)&lt;/ref&gt; This was presumed to happen after they pass the initiation rites of an older shaman they were apprenticed to (usually a relative). In some cases, some shamans acquire their status after they recover from a serious illness or a bout of insanity.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cannell"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fenella Cannell|title =Power and Intimacy in the Christian Philippines|publisher =Cambridge University Press|series =Cambridge Studies in Social and Cultural Anthropology, Volume 109|year =1999|isbn =9780521646222|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=ngmnrkfySdUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oceans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sh"/&gt; In most Filipino ethnic groups, shamans were almost always female. The few males who gain shaman status were usually ''asog'' or ''bayok'',&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Asog'' is the term used for transvestite male shamans in most of the Visayas and in the [[Bicol Region]]. In the rest of Luzon, they are known as ''bayok'' (''bayoc''), ''bayog'', or ''bayogin'' (''bayoguin'' or ''bayoquin''). Notably among the [[Sambal people|Sambal]], the highest-ranking shaman was a ''bayok''. They are also known as ''labia'' among the [[Subanen people|Subanen]], though they were not necessarily shamans (Kroeber, 1918). There are also similar male shamans who behave as women among the [[Dayak people]] of Borneo (Baldick, 2013). Also see ''[[Bakla]]''&lt;/ref&gt; men who dressed as women and lived as women (even marrying men).&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kroeber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sh"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aswangproject.com/filipino-shaman/|title=6 Guidelines for Becoming a Filipino Shaman|publisher=The Aswang Project|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Itneg people launching spirit rafts bearing offerings for anito on a river (1922, Philippines).jpg|thumb|left|Itneg people launching spirit boats (''taltalabong'') bearing offerings for ''anito'' (1922)]]
Major ''pag-anito'' rituals are centered around a [[séance]]. Because of their special relationship with their companion spirits, shamans can act as [[mediumship|medium]]s for other ''anito'', allowing spirits to temporarily possess their bodies. This possession happens after the shaman goes into a trance-like state. This allows the spirit to communicate verbally with the participants as well as physically act out events in the spirit world. At the moment of possession, shamans display a change in behavior and voice. They can sometimes go into seizures and become violent enough that restraints are required. The ritual ends when the spirit leaves and the shaman is awakened.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;

Spirits were invited into the ritual through offerings and sacrifices during and after the ceremonies. These depended on what spirit was being summoned, but offerings are usually a small portion of the harvests, cooked food, wine, gold ornaments, and [[Paan|betel nut]]. Blood from an animal was also usually part of the offerings, poured directly on the ''taotao'' or in a bowl before them. These commonly come from chickens or pigs, but can also be from [[carabao]]s or dogs.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt; Salt and spices are usually avoided, as they are believed to be distasteful to ''anito''.&lt;ref name="buen"/&gt; There is no record of [[human sacrifice]]s being offered to ''anito'' during the Spanish period of the Philippines,&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zaide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mccoy"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alfred W.

In the funeral rites for celebrated warriors or nobles among Visayans and Tagalogs, favorite [[alipin|slaves]] may also sometimes be executed and buried (''hogot'') to accompany the deceased into the spirit world (Scott, 1994; Benedict, 1916)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common ''pag-anito'' ritual throughout most of the Philippine ethnic groups involves the use of spirit boats. These were usually miniature boats laden with offerings set adrift from riverbanks and shorelines.&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apostol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cole"/&gt;
[[File:Babaylan Festival in Bago City.jpg|thumb|A performer depicting a [[babaylan|shaman]] in the 2015 [[Babaylan Festival]] of [[Bago, Negros Occidental]]]]
''Pag-anito'' can be conducted on its own or in conjunction with other rituals and celebrations. They can be personal or family rituals or seasonal community events. They can vary considerably between different ethnic groups. The most common ''pag-anito'' were entreaties for bountiful harvests, cures for illnesses, victory in battle, prayers for the dead, or blessings.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kroeber"/&gt;

Different ethnic groups had different ''diwata'' pantheons and rituals associated with them, though sometimes deities are shared in neighboring ethnic groups. Moreover, different communities also each have their own local patron ''diwata.''&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In modern Christianized Filipinos, this practice was transferred unto community patron saints and [[Religious images in Christian theology|religious icons]], which are often celebrated and worshiped in a very similar way (Hislop, 1971), cf. [[Ati-Atihan]], [[Obando Fertility Rites]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Atmospheric circulation''' is the large-scale movement of air, and together with [[ocean circulation]] is the means by which [[thermal energy]] is redistributed on the surface of the [[Earth]].

The Earth's atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the large-scale structure of its circulation remains fairly constant. The smaller scale weather systems – mid-latitude depressions, or tropical convective cells – occur "randomly", and long-range weather predictions of those cannot be made beyond ten days in practice, or a month in theory (see [[Chaos theory]] and [[Butterfly effect]]).

The Earth's [[weather]] is a consequence of its illumination by the [[Sun]], and the laws of [[thermodynamics]]. The atmospheric circulation can be viewed as a heat engine driven by the Sun's energy, and whose [[heat sink|energy sink]], ultimately, is the blackness of space. The work produced by that engine causes the motion of the masses of air and in that process, it redistributes the energy absorbed by the Earth's surface near the tropics to the latitudes nearer the poles, and then to space.

The large-scale atmospheric circulation "cells" shift polewards in warmer periods (for example, [[interglacial]]s compared to [[Glacial period|glacials]]), but remain largely constant as they are, fundamentally, a property of the Earth's size, rotation rate, heating and atmospheric depth, all of which change little. Over very long time periods (hundreds of millions of years), a [[tectonic uplift]] can significantly alter their major elements, such as the [[jet stream]], and [[plate tectonics]] may shift [[ocean current]]s. During the extremely hot climates of the [[Mesozoic]], a third [[desert]] belt may have existed at the [[Equator]].

==Latitudinal circulation features==

The wind belts girdling the planet are organised into three cells in each hemisphere: the [[Hadley cell]], the Ferrel cell, and the Polar cell. Those cells exist in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The vast bulk of the atmospheric motion occurs in the Hadley cell. The high pressure systems acting on the Earth's surface are balanced by the low pressure systems elsewhere. As a result, there is a balance of forces acting on the Earth's surface.

=== Hadley cell ===
{{Main|Hadley cell}}
[[File:IntertropicalConvergenceZone-EO.jpg|thumb|right|The [[ITCZ]]'s band of clouds over the [[Eastern Pacific]] and the [[Americas]] as seen from space]]
The atmospheric circulation pattern that [[George Hadley]] described was an attempt to explain the [[trade wind]]s. The Hadley cell is a closed circulation loop which begins at the equator. There, moist air is warmed by the Earth's surface, decreases in density and rises. A similar air mass rising on the other side of the equator forces those rising air masses to move poleward. The rising air creates a low pressure zone near the equator. As the air moves poleward, it cools, becomes denser, and descends at about the [[30th parallel (disambiguation)|30th parallel]], creating a [[high-pressure area]]. The descended air then travels toward the equator along the surface, replacing the air that rose from the equatorial zone, closing the loop of the Hadley cell. The poleward movement of the air in the upper part of the troposphere deviates toward the east, caused by the [[coriolis acceleration]] (a manifestation of conservation of angular momentum). At the ground level, however, the movement of the air toward the equator in the lower troposphere deviates toward the west, producing a wind from the east. The winds that flow to the west (from the east, easterly wind) at the ground level in the Hadley cell are called the [[trade wind|Trade Winds]].

Though the Hadley cell is described as located at the equator, in the northern hemisphere it shifts to higher latitudes in June and July and toward lower latitudes in December and January, which is the result of the Sun's heating of the surface. The zone where the greatest heating takes place is called the "[[thermal equator]]". As the southern hemisphere summer is December to March, the movement of the thermal equator to higher southern latitudes takes place then.

The Hadley system provides an example of a thermally direct circulation. The power of the Hadley system, considered as a heat engine, is estimated at 200 tera[[watt]]s.&lt;ref name="RERLHadley"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Junling Huang and Michael B. McElroy|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00538.1|title=Contributions of the Hadley and Ferrel Circulations to the Energetics of the Atmosphere over the Past 32 Years|journal=Journal of Climate|issue=7| volume=27 |pages=2656–2666 |year=2014 |doi=10.1175/jcli-d-13-00538.1|bibcode = 2014JCli...27.2656H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ferrel cell ===
Part of the air rising at 60° latitude diverges at high altitude toward the poles and creates the polar cell. The rest moves toward the equator where it collides at 30° latitude with the high-level air of the Hadley cell. There it subsides and strengthens the high pressure ridges beneath. A large part of the energy that drives the Ferrel cell is provided by the polar and Hadley cells circulating on either side and that drag the Ferrel cell with it.&lt;ref name="The Climate System: General Circulation and Climate Zones"&gt;{{cite web | author = Yochanan Kushnir | title = The Climate System: General Circulation and Climate Zones |date=2000 | url = http://eesc.columbia.edu/courses/ees/climate/lectures/gen_circ/index.html | accessdate = 13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Ferrel cell, theorized by [[William Ferrel]] (1817–1891), is, therefore, a secondary circulation feature, whose existence depends upon the Hadley and polar cells on either side of it. It might be thought of as an [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddy]] created by the Hadley and polar cells.  

The air of the Ferrel cell that descends at 30° latitude returns poleward at the ground level, and as it does so it deviates toward the east. In the upper atmosphere of the Ferrel cell, the air moving toward the equator deviates toward the west. Both of those deviations, as in the case of the Hadley and polar cells, are driven by conservation of angular momentum. As a result, just as the easterly Trade Winds are found below the Hadley cell, the [[Westerlies]] are found beneath the Ferrel cell. 

The Ferrel cell is weak, because It has neither a strong source of heat nor a strong sink, so the airflow and temperatures within it are variable. For this reason, the mid-latitudes are sometimes known as the '''"zone of mixing."'''  The Hadley and polar cells are truly closed loops, the Ferrel cell is not, and the telling point is in the Westerlies, which are more formally known as "the Prevailing Westerlies." The easterly Trade Winds and the polar easterlies have nothing over which to prevail, as their parent circulation cells are strong enough and face few obstacles either in the form of massive terrain features or high pressure zones. The weaker Westerlies of the Ferrel cell, however, can be disrupted. The local passage of a cold front may change that in a matter of minutes, and frequently does. As a result, at the surface, winds can vary abruptly in direction. But the winds above the surface, where they are less disrupted by terrain, are essentially westerly. A low pressure zone at 60° latitude that moves toward the equator, or a high pressure zone at 30° latitude that moves poleward, will accelerate the Westerlies of the Ferrel cell. A strong high, moving polewards may bring westerly winds for days.

The Ferrel system acts as a [[heat pump]] with a coefficient of performance of 12.1, consuming kinetic energy from the Hadley and polar systems at an approximate rate of 275 terawatts.&lt;ref name="RERLHadley" /&gt;

=== Polar cell ===
{{Main|Polar vortex|Polar easterlies}}
The '''Polar cell''' is a simple system with strong convection drivers. Though cool and dry relative to equatorial air, the air masses at the [[60th parallel (disambiguation)|60th parallel]] are still sufficiently warm and moist to undergo [[convection]] and drive a [[thermal loop]]. At the 60th parallel, the air rises to the tropopause (about 8&amp;nbsp;km at this latitude) and moves poleward. As it does so, the upper level air mass deviates toward the east.   When the air reaches the polar areas, it has cooled and is considerably denser than the underlying air. It descends, creating a cold, dry high-pressure area. At the polar surface level, the mass of air is driven toward the 60th parallel, replacing the air that rose there, and the polar circulation cell is complete. As the air at the surface moves toward the equator, it deviates toward the west. Again, the deviations of the air masses are the result of the [[Coriolis effect]]. The air flows at the surface are called the polar easterlies.

The outflow of air mass from the cell creates [[harmonic]] waves in the atmosphere known as [[Rossby wave]]s. These ultra-long waves determine the path of the polar [[jet stream]], which travels within the transitional zone between the [[tropopause]] and the [[Ferrel cell]]. By acting as a heat sink, the polar cell moves the abundant heat from the equator toward the polar regions.

The Hadley cell and the polar cell are similar in that they are thermally direct; in other words, they exist as a direct consequence of surface temperatures. Their thermal characteristics drive the weather in their domain. The sheer volume of energy that the Hadley cell transports, and the depth of the heat sink that is the polar cell, ensures that the effects of transient weather phenomena do not only have negligible effect on the system as a whole, but — except under unusual circumstances — do not form. The endless chain of passing highs and lows which is part of everyday life for mid-latitude dwellers, at latitudes between 30 and 60° latitude, is unknown above the 60th and below the 30th parallels. There are some notable exceptions to this rule. In Europe, unstable weather extends to at least the [[70th parallel north]].

The polar cell, terrain and [[Katabatic winds]] in Antarctica, can create very cold conditions at the surface, for instance [[lowest temperature recorded on Earth|the lowest temperature recorded on Earth]]: −89.2&amp;nbsp;°C at [[Vostok Station]] in Antarctica, measured 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/momu/International_Antarctic_Weather_Forecasting_Handbook/2.1_The%20physical%20environment%20of%20the%20Antarctic.php|title=The physical environment of the Antarctic|publisher=British Antarctic Survey (BAS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoveringantarctica.org.uk/alevel_2_2.html |title=Regional climate variation and weather |publisher=RGS-IBG in partnership with BAS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306052337/http://www.discoveringantarctica.org.uk/alevel_2_2.html |archivedate=2015-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/oymyakon-the-coldest-town/|title=Welcome to the Coldest Town on Earth|publisher=Scientific American|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Longitudinal circulation features==
[[Image:Diurnal wind change in coastal area.png|thumb|400px|Diurnal wind change in local coastal area, also applies on the continental scale.]]

While the Hadley, Ferrel, and polar cells (whose axes are oriented along parallels or latitudes) are the major features of global heat transport, they do not act alone. Temperature differences also drive a set of circulation cells, whose axes of circulation are longitudinally oriented. This atmospheric motion is known as '''zonal overturning circulation'''.

Latitudinal circulation is a result of the highest solar radiation per unit area (solar intensity) falling on the tropics.  The solar intensity decreases as the latitude increases, reaching essentially zero at the poles. Longitudinal circulation, however, is a result of the heat capacity of water, its absorptivity, and its mixing. Water absorbs more heat than does the land, but its temperature does not rise as greatly as does the land. As a result, temperature variations on land are greater than on water. 

The Hadley, Ferrel, and polar cells operate at the largest scale of thousands of kilometers ([[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic scale]]). The latitudinal circulation can also act on this scale of oceans and continents, and this effect is seasonal or even [[decade|decadal]].  Warm air rises over the equatorial, continental, and western Pacific Ocean regions. When it reaches the tropopause, it cools and subsides in a region of relatively cooler water mass.

The Pacific Ocean cell plays a particularly important role in Earth's weather.  This entirely ocean-based cell comes about as the result of a marked difference in the surface temperatures of the western and eastern Pacific.  Under ordinary circumstances, the western Pacific waters are warm, and the eastern waters are cool. The process begins when strong convective activity over equatorial [[East Asia]] and subsiding cool air off [[South America]]'s west coast creates a wind pattern which pushes Pacific water westward and piles it up in the western Pacific. (Water levels in the western Pacific are about 60&amp;nbsp;cm higher than in the eastern Pacific.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The daily (diurnal) longitudinal effects are at the [[Mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]] (a horizontal range of 5 to several hundred kilometres).  During the day, air warmed by the relatively hotter land rises, and as it does so it draws a cool breeze from the sea that replaces the risen air. At night, the relatively warmer water and cooler land reverses the process, and a breeze from the land, of air cooled by the land, is carried offshore by night.

=== Walker circulation ===
{{unreferenced section|date = November 2017}}
{{Main|Walker circulation}}
The Pacific cell is of such importance that it has been named the '''Walker circulation''' after [[Sir Gilbert Walker]], an early-20th-century director of British observatories in [[India]], who sought a means of predicting when the [[monsoon]] winds of India would fail. While he was never successful in doing so, his work led him to the discovery of a link between the periodic pressure variations in the [[Indian Ocean]], and those between the eastern and western Pacific, which he termed the "[[Southern Oscillation]]".

The movement of air in the Walker circulation affects the loops on either side. Under normal circumstances, the weather behaves as expected. But every few years, the winters become unusually warm or unusually cold, or the frequency of [[hurricane]]s increases or decreases, and the pattern sets in for an indeterminate period. 

The Walker Cell plays a key role in this and in the [[El Niño]] phenomenon. If convective activity slows in the Western Pacific for some reason (this reason is not currently known), the climates of areas adjacent to the Western Pacific are affected. First, the upper-level westerly winds fail. This cuts off the source of returning, cool air that would normally subside at about 30° south latitude,{{according to whom|date = November 2017}} and therefore the air returning as surface easterlies ceases. There are two consequences. Warm water ceases to surge into the eastern Pacific from the west (it was "piled" by past easterly winds) since there is no longer a surface wind to push it into the area of the west Pacific. This and the corresponding effects of the Southern Oscillation result in long-term unseasonable temperatures and precipitation patterns in North and South America, Australia, and Southeast Africa, and the disruption of ocean currents.

Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, fast-blowing upper level Westerlies of the Hadley cell form, which would ordinarily be blocked by the Walker circulation and unable to reach such intensities. These winds disrupt the tops of nascent hurricanes and greatly diminish the number which are able to reach full strength.

==== El Niño – Southern Oscillation ====
{{Main|El Niño-Southern Oscillation}}

''El Niño'' and ''La Niña'' are opposite surface temperature anomalies of the Southern Pacific, which heavily influence the weather on a large scale. In the case of El Niño, warm surface water approaches the coasts of South America which results in blocking the upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water. This has serious impacts on the fish populations.

In the La Niña case, the convective cell over the western Pacific strengthens inordinately, resulting in colder than normal winters in North America and a more robust cyclone season in [[South-East Asia]] and [[Eastern Australia]]. There is also an increased upwelling of deep cold ocean waters and more intense uprising of surface air near South America, resulting in increasing numbers of drought occurrences, although fishermen reap benefits from the more nutrient-filled eastern Pacific waters.

'''Biomuseo''' is a museum focused on the natural history of Panama, whose isthmus was formed very recently in geologic time, with major impact on the ecology of the Western Hemisphere.  Located on the Amador Causeway in [[Panama City]], [[Panama]], it was designed by renowned architect [[Frank Gehry]]. This is Gehry's first design for Latin America. The design was conceived in 1999 and the museum opened in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/arts/artsspecial/biomuseo-showcases-panamas-ecological-diversity.html|title=Biomuseo Showcases Panama's Ecological Diversity|first=Judith H.|last=Dobrzynski|date=23 October 2014|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Biomuseo highlights Panama's natural and cultural history, emphasizing the role of humans in the XXI century. Its galleries tell the story of how the rise of the isthmus of Panama changed the world.

== Location ==
'''Biomuseo''' is located in Amador, also known as [[Causeway Islands|Causeway]], at the south entrance of the [[Panama Canal]]. You can get there taking a taxi or using the bus.

== The building and its galleries ==
With 4,000 square meters, the '''Biomuseo''' has 8 galleries for its permanent exhibits, designed in sequence by Bruce Mau Design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brucemaudesign.com/|title=Home - Bruce Mau Design|website=www.brucemaudesign.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides the main spaces the museum also has a public atrium, a space for temporary exhibits, a gift store, a coffee shop and exterior exhibits in a botanical garden designed by [[Edwina von Gal]].

On October 2, 2014 the Biomuseo opened its doors to the public with 5 of its 8 galleries. This first part of the story tells the importance of Panama and its natural and cultural evolution.

'''Gallery of Biodiversity''':

What is biodiversity? Why should we care? What is happening to it today? The first gallery is an introduction to Panama's amazing natural heritage.

'''Panamarama''':

We are surrounded by an endless number of living beings and communities. A three-level projection space with 10 screens envelops the visitor in a display of sight and sound featuring Panama's natural wonders.

'''Building the Bridge''':

Panama emerged from the sea 3 million years ago. Earth's inner forces that formed the Isthmus of Panama take the form of three 14 meter high rock formations, allowing for a tangible encounter with the geological world.

'''Worlds Collide''':

When the Isthmus closed an extraordinary exchange of species occurred between North and South America. A stampede of animal sculptures of all eras, shapes and sizes tell the story of this unique and ongoing natural event.

'''The Human Path''':

In a space partially open to the outdoors 16 columns provide information about the relations between human activity and the natural scenarios of Panama throughout time.

The Biomuseo is expected to open its last 3 galleries by 2018.

'''Oceans Divided''':

When Panama emerged, two very different oceans formed, changing life in the planet. Two large semi-circular aquariums will show how the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea evolved once they were separated by the isthmus.

'''The Living Web''':

Living beings need each other and interact in complex and invisible ways. A large sculpture, part plant, animal, insect and microorganism will give the visitor the experience in a dimension where all creatures have the same importance.

'''Panama is the Museum''':

The most amazing experience awaits the visitor outside of the museum. Screens will offer information about the relationship between the biodiversity in Panama and the world.

== Social effect ==
The Gehry design is expected to attract tourists and help grow Panama's cultural attractions. The museum may have a similar effect as Gehry's Guggenheim design had for [[Bilbao]], which rejuvenated and placed the city on the map as an important architectural destination.

'''Boninite''' is a  [[mafic]] [[extrusive]] [[Rock (geology)|rock]] high in both [[magnesium]] and [[silica]], thought to be usually formed in [[fore-arc]] environments, typically during the early stages of [[subduction]]. The rock is named for its occurrence in the [[Bonin Islands|Izu-Bonin]] [[Island arc|arc]] south of [[Japan]]. It is characterized by extreme depletion in incompatible trace elements that are not fluid mobile (e.g., the heavy [[rare-earth elements]] plus Nb, Ta, Hf) but variable enrichment in the fluid mobile elements (e.g., Rb, Ba, K). They are found almost exclusively in the fore-arc of [[Magma|primitive]] [[island arc]]s (that is, closer to the [[ocean trench]]) and in [[ophiolite]] complexes thought to represent former fore-arc settings or at least formed above a subduction zone. 

Boninite is considered to be a ''primitive'' [[andesite]] derived from melting of [[metasomatism|metasomatised]] [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. 

Similar [[Archean]] [[intrusion (geology)|intrusive rocks]], called [[sanukitoid]]s, have been reported in the rocks of several early [[craton]]s.

== Petrology ==
Boninite typically consists of [[phenocryst]]s of [[pyroxene]]s and [[olivine]] in a crystallite-rich glassy [[matrix (geology)|matrix]].

== Geochemistry ==
Boninite is defined by
* high magnesium content ([[MgO]] = 8–15%)
* low [[titanium]] ([[Titanium dioxide|TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] &lt; 0.5%)
* [[silica]] content is 57–60%
* high Mg/(Mg + [[Iron|Fe]]) (0.55–0.83)
* Mantle-normal [[compatibility (geochemistry)|compatible]] elements [[Nickel|Ni]] = 70–450 parts per million, [[Chromium|Cr]] = 200–1800 ppm
* [[barium|Ba]], [[strontium|Sr]], L[[Rare-earth element|REE]] enrichments compared to [[Tholeiitic magma series|tholeiite]]
* Characteristic Ti/[[Zirconium|Zr]] ratios (23–63) and [[Lanthanum|La]]/[[Ytterbium|Yb]] ratios (0.6–4.7)

== Genesis ==
Most boninite [[magma]] is formed by second stage melting in [[forearc]]s via [[mineral hydration|hydration]] of previously depleted [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] within the mantle wedge above a [[subduction|subducted slab]], causing further melting of the already depleted [[peridotite]]. A forearc environment is ideal for boninite genesis, but other tectonic environments, such as [[backarc]]s, might be able to form boninite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Encarnación|first=John|last2=Mukasa|first2=Samuel B|last3=Evans|first3=Cynthia A|date=1999-04-01|title=Subduction components and the generation of arc-like melts in the Zambales ophiolite, Philippines: Pb, Sr and Nd isotopic constraints|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254198001909|journal=Chemical Geology|volume=156|issue=1–4|pages=343–357|doi=10.1016/S0009-2541(98)00190-9|bibcode=1999ChGeo.156..343E}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The content of titanium (an incompatible element within melting of peridotite) is extremely low because previous melting events had removed most of the incompatible elements from the residual mantle source. The first stage melting typically forms island arc [[tholeiite basalt|basalt]]. The second melting event is partly made possible by hydrous fluids being added to the shallow hot depleted mantle, leading the enrichment in large ion lithophile elements in the boninite.  

Boninite attains its high magnesium and very low titanium content via high degrees of partial melting within the [[mantle convection|convecting]] mantle wedge. The high degrees of partial melting are caused by the high water content of the mantle. With the addition of slab-derived volatiles, and incompatible elements derived from the release of low-volume partial melts of the subducted slab, the depleted mantle in the mantle wedge undergoes melting.

Evidence for variable enrichment or depletion of incompatible elements suggests that boninites are derived from refractory peridotite which has been metasomatically enriched in [[LREE]], strontium, barium, and [[alkali]]s. Enrichment in Ba, Sr and alkalis may result from a component derived from subducted oceanic crust. This is envisaged as contamination from the underlying subducted slab, either as a sedimentary source or as melts derived from the dehydrating slab.

Boninites can be derived from the peridotite residue of earlier arc tholeiite generation which is metasomatically enriched in LREE before boninite [[volcano|volcanism]], or arc tholeiites and boninites can be derived from a variably depleted peridotite source which has been variably metasomatised in LREE. 

Areas of fertile peridotite would yield tholeiites, and refractory areas would yield boninites.

'''Bucktail State Park Natural Area''' is a {{convert|16433|acre|adj=on}} [[List of Pennsylvania state parks|Pennsylvania state park]] in [[Cameron County, Pennsylvania|Cameron]] and [[Clinton County, Pennsylvania|Clinton]] Counties in [[Pennsylvania]] in the United States. The park follows [[Pennsylvania Route 120]] for {{convert|75|mi}} between [[Emporium, Pennsylvania|Emporium]] (in Cameron County, which contains {{convert|3239|acre}} of the park) and [[Lock Haven, Pennsylvania|Lock Haven]] (in Clinton County, which contains the other {{convert|11800|acre}}). Bucktail State Park Natural Area park runs along [[Sinnemahoning Creek]] and the [[West Branch Susquehanna River]] and also passes through [[Renovo, Pennsylvania|Renovo]] (in Clinton County). The park is named for the Civil War [[Pennsylvania Bucktails Regiment]] and is primarily dedicated to wildlife viewing, especially [[elk]].

==Course==
[[Image:West Branch Bend.jpg|thumb|left|The [[West Branch Susquehanna River]] as seen in Bucktail State Park Natural Area]]
The course of Bucktail State Park Natural Area is as follows: leaving the city of Lock Haven, Pennsylvania Route 120 and the West Branch Susquehanna River pass through the following municipalities in Clinton County heading west (in order): [[Allison Township, Clinton County, Pennsylvania|Allison]], [[Woodward Township, Clinton County, Pennsylvania|Woodward]], [[Bald Eagle Township, Clinton County, Pennsylvania|Bald Eagle]], [[Colebrook Township, Clinton County, Pennsylvania|Colebrook]], [[Grugan Township, Clinton County, Pennsylvania|Grugan]], and [[Chapman Township, Clinton County, Pennsylvania|Chapman]] townships, the boroughs of [[Renovo, Pennsylvania|Renovo]] and [[South Renovo, Pennsylvania|South Renovo]], and [[Noyes Township, Clinton County, Pennsylvania|Noyes Township]]. Next Pennsylvania 120 leaves the West Branch Susquehanna River and follows Sinnemahoning Creek west through [[East Keating Township, Clinton County, Pennsylvania|East Keating Township]], then crosses into Cameron County. There Pennsylvania Route 120 and Sinnemahoning Creek pass west through [[Gibson Township, Cameron County, Pennsylvania|Gibson Township]] and enter the borough of [[Driftwood, Pennsylvania|Driftwood]], where Route 120 follows the Driftwood Branch of Sinnemahoning Creek north through Gibson, [[Lumber Township, Pennsylvania|Lumber]], [[Portage Township, Cameron County, Pennsylvania|Portage]], and [[Shippen Township, Cameron County, Pennsylvania|Shippen]] townships, finally reaching the borough of Emporium and the western end of Bucktail State Park.&lt;ref name="cammap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clintmap"/&gt;

==History==
Pennsylvania Route 120 follows an old [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Trail]], the [[Sinnemahoning Path]]. This trail was used by Native Americans to cross the eastern [[continental divide]] (specifically the [[Allegheny Front]]) between the [[Susquehanna River]] (which drains into the [[Chesapeake Bay]]) and the [[Allegheny River]] (which forms the [[Ohio River]] with the [[Monongahela River]] at [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] and eventually drains into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] via the [[Mississippi River]]). American Pioneers also used the trail to make their way west and it was also known as the Bucktail Trail. As the technology of road building advanced, what was once a Native American Trail became the two lane highway known today as Pennsylvania Route 120.

Pennsylvania Route 120 was officially designated as Bucktail State Park in 1933 by an act of the Pennsylvania Legislature. The Act says:&lt;ref name="bspna"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/bucktail/index.htm 
| title = Bucktail State Park

{{cquote|That the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania hereby dedicates to the public, for use as a park and pleasure ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people, all that area of land extending in length from the western [[city]] line of [[Lock Haven, Pennsylvania|Lock Haven]], in [[Clinton County, Pennsylvania|Clinton County]], to the eastern [[borough]] line of [[Emporium, Pennsylvania|Emporium]], in [[Cameron County, Pennsylvania|The County of Cameron]], and along the course of the [[West Branch Susquehanna River|western branch of the Susquehanna River]], and its [[tributary]], [[Sinnemahoning Creek]], in Clinton and Cameron counties, an estimated distance of {{convert|75|mi|km}}, and in width from mountain rim to mountain rim across the valley.

The said park shall be called and known as the "Bucktail State Park", in commemoration of the [[Bucktail Regiment]] which embarked from [[Driftwood, Pennsylvania|Driftwood]], in Cameron County, in April, 1861, upon [[rafts]] of their own construction to hasten their arrival at the imperiled [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|State Capitol]].&lt;ref name="bspna"/&gt;}}

[[Image:Pennsylvania Route 120, Clinton County.JPG|thumb|left|Pennsylvania Route 120 in Clinton County]]
Although the park covers {{convert|21039|acre}}, much of the land within the park boundaries is actually in private hands. The rest of the land in the valleys is owned by the Bureau of State Parks and the Bureau of [[Forestry]] as part of [[Elk State Forest]] and [[Sproul State Forest]].&lt;ref name="bspna"/&gt;

==Wildlife watching==
Bucktail State Park Natural Area is in the West Branch and Sinnemahoning Valleys. River valleys are ideal gathering points for wildlife as the valleys tend to be warmer and wetter than the surrounding mountains. Animals are drawn to the warm and wet valley. The river valley is a natural passageway for plants and animals. The valley is home to [[river birch]] and [[American sycamore|sycamore]] trees. [[Osprey]], a wide variety of [[duck]], [[white-tailed deer]], [[bald eagles]], [[otter]], [[merganser]], [[mink]] and [[American black bear|black bear]] can all be seen living in the boundaries of Bucktail State Park Natural Area.&lt;ref name="bspna"/&gt;
 
[[Elk]] can be seen in the early morning and late afternoon hours in the northern portions of the park. Special elk viewing playforms have been built in [[Sinnemahoning State Park]] and near the small village of [[Benezette, Pennsylvania|Bennezette]].&lt;ref name="bspna"/&gt;

The '''Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) boundary''', formerly known as the '''Cretaceous–Tertiary (K-T) boundary''',{{efn|This former designation has as a part of it a term, '[[Tertiary]]' (abbreviated as '''T'''), that is now discouraged as a formal geochronological unit by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Gradstein |editor1-first=Felix M. |editor2-last=Ogg |editor2-first=James G. |editor3-last=Smith |editor3-first=Alan G. |year=2004 |title=A geologic time scale 2004 |location=Cambridge, UK |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-78142-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} is a [[Geology|geological]] [[Stratigraphy|signature]], usually a thin [[stratum|band]] of rock. ''K'', the first letter of the German word ''Kreide'' (chalk), is the traditional abbreviation for the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] and ''Pg'' is the abbreviation for the [[Paleogene]] Period.

The K–Pg boundary marks the end of the Cretaceous Period, the last period of the [[Mesozoic]] [[Era#Geological era|Era]], and marks the beginning of the Paleogene Period, the first period of the [[Cenozoic]] Era. Its age is usually estimated at around 66 Ma (million [[year]]s ago),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2013-01.pdf|title=International Chronostratigraphic Chart|publisher=International Commission on Stratigraphy|year=2012|format=pdf|accessdate=2013-12-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717121504/http://stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2013-01.pdf|archivedate=2013-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[radiometric dating]] yielding a more specific age of 66.043 ± 0.011 Ma.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Time Scales of Critical Events Around the Cretaceous-Paleogene Boundary|author1=Renne |date = 2013|journal = Science|doi = 10.1126/science.1230492|pmid = 23393261|access-date = |display-authors=etal |volume=339 |pages=684–7|bibcode=2013Sci...339..684R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The K–Pg boundary is associated with the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]], a [[Extinction event|mass extinction]] which destroyed a majority of the world's Mesozoic species, including all [[dinosaur]]s except for [[bird]]s.&lt;ref name="Fortey"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fortey, R|title=Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth|publisher=Vintage|year=1999|pages=238–260|isbn=978-0-375-70261-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong evidence exists that the extinction coincided with a large meteorite impact at the [[Chicxulub crater]] and the generally accepted scientific theory is that this impact triggered the extinction event.

In 1980, a team of researchers consisting of [[Nobel Prize]]-winning physicist [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]], his son, geologist [[Walter Alvarez]], and chemists [[Frank Asaro]] and [[Helen Vaughn Michel|Helen Michel]] discovered that [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] layers found all over the world at the K–Pg boundary contain a [[concentration]] of [[iridium]] many times greater than normal (30 times the average crustal content in Italy and 160 times at [[Stevns Municipality|Stevns]] on the Danish island of Zealand).&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt; Iridium is extremely rare in the [[Crust (geology)|earth's crust]] because it is a [[Goldschmidt classification#Siderophile elements|siderophile]] element, and therefore most of it sank with [[iron]] into the [[Structure of the Earth#Core|earth's core]] during [[planetary differentiation]]. As iridium remains abundant in most asteroids and comets, the Alvarez team suggested that an [[asteroid]] struck the earth at the time of the K–Pg boundary.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction|author1=Alvarez, LW |author2=Alvarez, W |author3=Asaro, F |author4=Michel, HV  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1980|journal=Science|volume=208|issue=4448|pages=1095–1108|doi=10.1126/science.208.4448.1095|pmid=17783054|bibcode=1980Sci...208.1095A}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were other earlier speculations on the possibility of an [[impact event]], but no evidence had been uncovered at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=De Laubenfels, MW|title=Dinosaur Extinctions: One More Hypothesis|journal=Journal of Paleontology|volume=30|issue=1|pages=207–218|year=1956|url=http://www.norwebster.com/astrohit/|accessdate=2007-05-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928121425/http://www.norwebster.com/astrohit/|archivedate=2007-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence for the Alvarez impact theory is supported by [[Chondrite|chondritic]] [[meteorite]]s and asteroids which have an iridium concentration of ~455 parts per billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=W. F. McDonough |author2=S.-s. Sun |title=The composition of the Earth|journal=Chemical Geology|volume=120|issue=3–4|pages=223–253|year=1995|doi=10.1016/0009-2541(94)00140-4|bibcode=1995ChGeo.120..223M}}&lt;/ref&gt; much higher than ~0.3 parts per billion typical of the Earth's crust.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt; [[Chromium]] isotopic anomalies found in Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary sediments are similar to those of an asteroid or a comet composed of [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s. [[Shocked quartz]] granules and [[tektite]] glass spherules, indicative of an impact event, are also common in the K–Pg boundary, especially in deposits from around the Caribbean. All of these constituents are embedded in a layer of clay, which the Alvarez team interpreted as the debris spread all over the world by the impact.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt;

Using estimates of the total amount of iridium in the K–Pg layer, and assuming that the asteroid contained the normal percentage of iridium found in [[chondrites]], the Alvarez team went on to calculate the size of the asteroid. The answer was about {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} in diameter, about the size of Manhattan.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt; Such a large impact would have had approximately the energy of 100 trillion&amp;nbsp;tons of [[TNT]], or about 2 million times greater than the most powerful [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear bomb]] ever [[Tsar Bomba|tested]].

One of the consequences of such an impact is a dust cloud which would block [[sunlight]] and inhibit photosynthesis for a few years. This would account for the extinction of [[plant]]s and [[phytoplankton]] and of [[organism]]s dependent on them (including [[Predation|predatory animals]] as well as [[herbivore]]s). However, small creatures whose food chains were based on [[detritus]] might have still had a reasonable chance of survival. Vast amounts of [[sulfuric acid]] [[aerosol]]s were ejected into the [[stratosphere]] as a result of the impact, leading to a 10–20% reduction in sunlight reaching the Earth's surface. It would have taken at least ten years for those aerosols to dissipate.&lt;ref name=Pope/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ocampo, Adriana |author2=Vajda, Vivi |author3=Buffetaut, Eric |year=2006 |chapter=Unravelling the Cretaceous–Paleogene (KT) Turnover, Evidence from Flora, Fauna and Geology |title=Biological Processes Associated with Impact Events |editor1=Cockell, Charles |editor2=Gilmour, Iain |editor3=Koeberl, Christian |publisher=Springer |pp=197–219 |isbn=978-3-540-25735-6 |chapter-url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/vw75014157p2p278/ |url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b135965 |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global [[firestorm]]s may have resulted as incendiary fragments from the blast fell back to Earth. Analyses of [[fluid inclusions]] in ancient [[amber]] suggest that the [[oxygen]] content of the atmosphere was very high (30–35%) during the late Cretaceous. This high {{chem|O|2|link=oxygen}} level would have supported intense combustion. The level of atmospheric {{chem|O|2|}} plummeted in the early Paleogene Period. If widespread fires occurred, they would have increased the {{chem|C|O|2|link=carbon dioxide}} content of the atmosphere and caused a temporary [[greenhouse effect]] once the dust cloud settled, and this would have exterminated the most vulnerable survivors of the "long winter".&lt;ref name=Pope&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pope, K.O. |author2=Baines, K.H. |author3=Ocampo, A.C. |author4=Ivanov, B.A.  |last-author-amp=yes |year=1997 |title=Energy, volatile production, and climatic effects of the Chicxulub Cretaceous/Tertiary impact |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=102 |issue=E9 |pp=21645–64 |doi=10.1029/97JE01743|pmid=11541145|bibcode=1997JGR...10221645P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact may also have produced [[acid rain]], depending on what type of rock the asteroid struck. However, recent research suggests this effect was relatively minor. [[Buffer solution|Chemical buffers]] would have limited the changes, and the survival of animals vulnerable to [[acid rain]] effects (such as [[frog]]s) indicates that this was not a major contributor to extinction. Impact theories can only explain very rapid extinctions, since the dust clouds and possible sulphuric aerosols would wash out of the atmosphere in a fairly short time—possibly under ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kring, DA|year=2003|title=Environmental consequences of impact cratering events as a function of ambient conditions on Earth|journal=Astrobiology|volume=3|issue=1|pages=133–152|pmid=12809133|doi=10.1089/153110703321632471|bibcode = 2003AsBio...3..133K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Chicxulub crater}}

When it was originally proposed, one issue with the "[[Alvarez hypothesis]]" (as it came to be known) had been that no documented crater matched the event. This was not a lethal blow to the theory; while the crater resulting from the impact would have been larger than {{convert|250|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter, Earth's geological processes hide or destroy craters over time.&lt;ref name="Keller"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Keller, G, Adatte, T, Stinnesbeck, W, Rebolledo-Vieyra, Fucugauchi, JU, Kramar,U, &amp; Stüben, D|year=2004|title=Chicxulub impact predates the K-T boundary mass extinction|journal=PNAS|volume=101|pages=3753–3758|doi=10.1073/pnas.0400396101|pmid=15004276|issue=11|pmc=374316 |bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.3753K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicxulub crater ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|tʃ|iː|k|ʃ|ᵿ|l|uː|b}}; {{IPA-myn|tʃʼikʃuluɓ|lang}}) is an [[impact crater]] buried underneath the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="eid"&gt;{{Cite Earth Impact DB | name = Chicxulub | accessdate = December 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its center is located near the town of [[Chicxulub, Yucatán|Chicxulub]], after which the crater is named.&lt;ref name=penfield /&gt; It was formed by a large [[asteroid]] or [[comet]] about {{convert|10|to|15|km|abbr=off}} in diameter,&lt;ref name="science" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39922998|title=Dinosaur asteroid hit 'worst possible place'|first=Jonathan|last=Amos|date=May 15, 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Chicxulub impactor]], striking the Earth. The date of the impact coincides precisely with the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary), slightly less than 66 million years ago,&lt;ref name=RenneDeino2013/&gt; and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide [[Impact winter|climate disruption]] from the event was the cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a [[mass extinction]] in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth suddenly became extinct, including all non-[[bird|avian]] [[dinosaur]]s. 

The crater is estimated to be over {{convert|150|km|abbr=off}} in diameter&lt;ref name=eid/&gt; and {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} in depth, well into the [[continental crust]] of the region of about {{convert|10|–|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} depth. It makes the feature the second of the [[List of impact craters on Earth#Confirmed impact craters listed by size|largest confirmed impact structures on Earth]], and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research.&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/science/chicxulub-crater-dinosaur-extinction.html|author=St. Fleur, Nicholas|publisher=The New York Times|title=Drilling Into the Chicxulub Crater, Ground Zero of the Dinosaur Extinction|date=17 November 2016|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, [[geophysics|geophysicists]] who had been looking for [[petroleum]] in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes [[shocked quartz]],&lt;ref name="Becker2002"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Luann | last1=Becker | url=http://www.miracosta.edu/home/kmeldahl/articles/blows.pdf | title=Repeated Blows | accessdate=January 28, 2016 | journal=Scientific American | year=2002 | volume=286 | issue=3 | pages=76–83| bibcode=2002SciAm.286c..76B | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0302-76 | pmid=11857903 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[gravity anomaly]], and [[tektite]]s in surrounding areas.

In 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the [[peak ring]] of the impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain [[rock core]] samples from the impact itself. The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact and its effects.

The shape and location of the crater indicate further causes of devastation in addition to the dust cloud. The asteroid landed right on the coast and would have caused gigantic [[tsunami]]s, for which evidence has been found all around the coast of the Caribbean and eastern United States—marine sand in locations which were then inland, and vegetation debris and terrestrial rocks in marine sediments dated to the time of the impact.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The asteroid landed in a bed of [[anhydrite]] ({{chem|Ca|S|O|4}}) or [[gypsum]] (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)), which would have ejected large quantities of [[sulfur trioxide]] {{chem|S|O|3}} that combined with water to produce a [[sulfuric acid]] [[aerosol]]. This would have further reduced the sunlight reaching the Earth's surface and then over several days, precipitated planet-wide as [[acid rain]], killing vegetation, plankton and organisms which build shells from [[calcium carbonate]] ([[coccolithophorids]] and [[molluscs]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/43960-asteroid-extinction-sulfur-ocean-acidification.html ''Dinosaur-Killing Asteroid Triggered Lethal Acid Rain,'' Livescience, March 09, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deccan Traps===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event]] --&gt;
{{main|Deccan Traps}}

Before 2000, arguments that the [[Deccan Traps]] [[flood basalt]]s caused the extinction were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68&amp;nbsp;Ma and lasted for over 2 million years. However, there is evidence that two thirds of the Deccan Traps were created within 1 million years about 65.5&amp;nbsp;Ma, so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly a period of thousands of years, but still a longer period than what would be expected from a single impact event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hofman, C, Féraud, G &amp; Courtillot, V|year=2000|title=40Ar/39Ar dating of mineral separates and whole rocks from the Western Ghats lava pile: further constraints on duration and age of the Deccan traps|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=180|pages=13–27|doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(00)00159-X|bibcode=2000E&amp;PSL.180...13H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duncan"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rapid eruption of the Deccan flood basalts at the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary|author1=Duncan, RA  |author2=Pyle, DG|year=1988|journal=Nature|volume=333|issue=6176|pages=841–843|doi=10.1038/333841a0|bibcode = 1988Natur.333..841D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deccan Traps could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulphuric aerosols into the air which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions which would have increased the [[greenhouse effect]] when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Duncan"/&gt;

In the years when the Deccan Traps theory was linked to a slower extinction, Luis Alvarez (who died in 1988) replied that [[Paleontology|paleontologists]] were being misled by [[Signor–Lipps effect|sparse data]]. While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in [[sea level]] and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alvarez, W|title=T. rex and the Crater of Doom|year=1997|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-01630-6|pages=130–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple impact event===
Several other craters also appear to have been formed about the time of the K–Pg boundary. This suggests the possibility of nearly simultaneous multiple impacts, perhaps from a fragmented asteroidal object, similar to the [[Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9|Shoemaker–Levy 9]] cometary impact with [[Jupiter]]. Among these are the [[Boltysh crater]], a {{Convert|24|km||abbr=on}} diameter impact crater in [[Ukraine]] {{nowrap|(65.17 ± 0.64&amp;nbsp;Ma);}} and the [[Silverpit crater]], a {{Convert|20|km||abbr=on}} diameter impact crater in the [[North Sea]] {{nowrap|(60–65&amp;nbsp;Ma).}} Any other craters that might have formed in the [[Tethys Ocean]] would have been obscured by erosion and tectonic events such as the relentless northward drift of Africa and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mullen, L|date= October 13, 2004|title= Debating the Dinosaur Extinction| url= http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1243.html|work=[[Astrobiology Magazine]]|accessdate=2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mullen, L| date= October 20, 2004 | title=Multiple impacts|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1253.html|work=[[Astrobiology Magazine]]|accessdate=2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullen Shiva"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mullen, L|date=November 3, 2004|title=Shiva:  Another K–T impact?|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1281.html|work=[[Astrobiology Magazine]]|accessdate=2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very large structure in the sea floor off the west coast of India has recently been interpreted as a crater by some researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Chatterjee, S |author2=Guven, N |author3=Yoshinobu, A |author4=Donofrio, R  |last-author-amp=yes |year=2006|title=Shiva structure: a possible K-Pg boundary impact crater on the western shelf of India|journal=Special Publications of the Museum of Texas Tech University|issue=50|url=http://www.nsrl.ttu.edu/publications/specpubs/sps/SP50.pdf|format=PDF |accessdate=2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The potential [[Shiva crater]], {{convert|450|-|600|km|abbr=on}} in diameter, would substantially exceed Chicxulub in size and has been estimated to be about 66&amp;nbsp;mya, an age consistent with the K–Pg boundary. An impact at this site could have been the triggering event for the nearby Deccan Traps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Shiva Crater:  Implications for Deccan Volcanism, India-Seychelles rifting, dinosaur extinction, and petroleum entrapment at the KT Boundary|url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2003AM/finalprogram/abstract_58126.htm|author1=Chatterjee, S |author2=Guven, N |author3=Yoshinobu, A |author4=Donofrio, R  |last-author-amp=yes |year=2003|journal=Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|volume=35|issue=6|pages=168|accessdate=2007-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this feature has not yet been accepted by the geologic community as an impact crater and may just be a sinkhole depression caused by salt withdrawal.&lt;ref name="Mullen Shiva"/&gt;

===Maastrichtian marine regression===
Clear evidence exists that sea levels fell in the final stage of the Cretaceous by more than at any other time in the [[Mesozoic]] era. In some [[Maastrichtian]] [[Stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] rock layers from various parts of the world, the later ones are terrestrial; earlier ones represent shorelines and the earliest represent seabeds. These layers do not show the tilting and distortion associated with [[Orogeny|mountain building]]; therefore, the likeliest explanation is a [[Marine regression|regression]], that is, a buildout of sediment, but not necessarily a drop in sea level. No direct evidence exists for the cause of the regression, but the explanation which is currently accepted as the most likely is that the [[plate tectonics|mid-ocean ridges]] became less active and therefore sank under their own weight as sediment from uplifted orogenic belts filled in structural basins.&lt;ref name="MacLeod"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=MacLeod, N. |author2=Rawson, P.F. |author3=Forey, P.L. |author4=Banner, F.T. |display-authors=2 |year=1997 |title=The Cretaceous–Tertiary biotic transition |journal=Journal of the Geological Society |volume=154 |issue=2 |pp=265–292 |issn=0016-7649 |doi=10.1144/gsjgs.154.2.0265 |url=http://jgs.geoscienceworld.org/content/154/2/265 |url-access=subscription |bibcode=1997JGSoc.154..265M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liangquan |first1=Li |last2=Keller |first2=Gerta |year=1998 |title=Abrupt deep-sea warming at the end of the Cretaceous |journal=Geology |volume=26 |issue=11 |pp=995–8 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1998)026&lt;0995:ADSWAT&gt;2.3.CO;2 |url=http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/26/11/995 |url-access=subscription |accessdate=1 May 2016 |bibcode=1998Geo....26..995L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A severe regression would have greatly reduced the [[continental shelf]] area, which is the most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been enough to cause a ''marine'' mass extinction. However, research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of [[ammonite]] extinction. The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's [[albedo]] and therefore increasing global temperatures.&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Marshall, C. R.  |author2=Ward, PD|year=1996|title=Sudden and Gradual Molluscan Extinctions in the Latest Cretaceous of Western European Tethys|journal=Science|volume=274|issue=5291|pages=1360–1363|doi=10.1126/science.274.5291.1360|pmid=8910273|bibcode = 1996Sci...274.1360M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine regression also resulted in the reduction in area of [[epeiric sea]]s, such as the [[Western Interior Seaway]] of North America. The reduction of these seas greatly altered habitats, removing [[coastal plain]]s that ten million years before had been host to diverse communities such as are found in rocks of the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]]. Another consequence was an expansion of [[freshwater]] environments, since continental runoff now had longer distances to travel before reaching oceans. While this change was favorable to [[freshwater]] [[vertebrates]], those that prefer [[ocean|marine]] environments, such as [[shark]]s, suffered.&lt;ref name=AF04&gt;{{cite book |last=Archibald |first=J. David |author2=Fastovsky, David E. |editor=Weishampel, David B. |editor2=Dodson, Peter |editor3=Osmólska, Halszka |title=The Dinosauria |edition=2nd |year=2004|publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=0-520-24209-2 |pages=672–684 |chapter=Dinosaur Extinction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supernova hypothesis===
Another discredited cause for the K–Pg extinction event is cosmic radiation from a nearby [[supernova]] explosion. An [[iridium anomaly]] at the boundary is consistent with this hypothesis. However, analysis of the boundary layer sediments failed to find {{chem|244|Pu}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Could a Nearby Supernova Explosion have Caused a Mass Extinction?|author1=Ellis, J  |author2=Schramm, DN|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=1995|volume=92|pages=235–238|pmid=11607506|doi=10.1073/pnas.92.1.235|issue=1|pmc=42852|bibcode = 1995PNAS...92..235E |arxiv=hep-ph/9303206}}&lt;/ref&gt; a supernova byproduct which is the longest-lived [[plutonium]] isotope, with a [[half-life]] of 81 million years.

===Multiple causes===
It is possible that more than one of these hypotheses may be a partial solution to the mystery, and that more than one of these events may have occurred. Both the Deccan Traps and the Chicxulub impact may have been important contributors. For example, the most recent dating of the Deccan Traps supports the idea that rapid eruption rates in the Deccan Traps may have been triggered by large seismic waves radiated by the impact.

{{Greek myth (sea)}}
In [[Greek mythology]], '''Dynamene''' {{IPAc-en|d|ᵻ|ˈ|n|æ|m|ᵻ|ˌ|n|iː|,_|d|aɪ|-}} ({{lang-grc|Δυναμένη}}) was a [[Nereid]] or sea-[[nymph]], one of the 50 daughters of [[Nereus]] and [[Doris (mythology)|Doris]]. Her name, a participle, means "she who can, the capable one." She, along with her sister [[Pherusa]], was associated with the might and power of great ocean swells.  She is mentioned in [[Hesiod]]'s [[Theogony]].

==Popular culture==
Dynamene is also the name of the beautiful widow in [[Christopher Fry]]'s 1946 comedy ''A Phoenix Too Frequent''.  After the premature death of her husband Virilius, Dynamene along with her maid Doto proposes to starve herself to death and follow him to [[Hades]].  They are rudely interrupted from their purpose by the handsome Roman soldier Tegeus who is meant to be guarding six dead bodies outside.  With Tegeus' charm and adoration Dynamene is able to save herself from an untimely fate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11953">The '''Earth–ionosphere waveguide'''&lt;ref&gt;Spies, Kenneth P. and James R. Wait, ''Mode calculations for VLF propagation in the earth-ionosphere waveguide'' (July 1961). U.S. National Bureau of Standards. QC100 .U5753 no.114 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the phenomenon in which certain [[Radio propagation|radio waves can propagate]] in the space between the ground and the boundary of the [[ionosphere]].
Because the ionosphere contains [[charged particles]], it can behave as a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]].  The earth operates as a [[ground plane]], and the resulting cavity behaves as a large [[waveguide]].

[[Extremely low frequency]] (ELF) (&lt; 3&amp;nbsp;kHz) and [[very low frequency]] (VLF) 
(3–30&amp;nbsp;kHz) signals can propagate efficiently in this waveguide.  For instance, lightning strikes launch a signal called [[radio atmospherics]], which can travel many thousands of miles, because they are confined between the Earth and the ionosphere.
The round-the-world nature of the waveguide produces [[resonance]]s, like a cavity, which are at ~7&amp;nbsp;Hz.

[[Radio propagation]] within the [[ionosphere]]  depends on frequency, [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]], time of day, season, [[Earth's magnetic field]], and solar activity. At  vertical incidence, waves with frequencies larger than the  electron plasma frequency (f&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;)
of the F-layer maximum

(1) {{pad|4em}} f&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 9&amp;nbsp;(N&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kHz

(N&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; in cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; is the electron density) can propagate through the ionosphere nearly undisturbed. Waves with frequencies smaller than f&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; are reflected within the ionospheric D-, E-, and F-layers.&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;Davies, K., "Ionospheric Radio", Peregrinus Ltd, London, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rawer, K., "Wave Propagation in the Ionosphere", Kluwer Publ., Dordrecht, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; f&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;  is of the order of 8–15&amp;nbsp;MHz during day time conditions. For oblique incidence, the [[critical frequency]] becomes larger.

Very low frequencies (VLF: 3–30&amp;nbsp;kHz), and extremely low frequencies (ELF: &lt;3 &amp;nbsp;kHz) are reflected at the [[ionospheric]] D- and lower E-layer. An exception is [[whistler (radio)|whistler]] propagation of [[lightning]] signals along the geomagnetic field 
lines.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;&lt;ref name=RAH1965&gt;{{cite book|title=Whistlers and Related Ionospheric Phenomena|author=Robert A. Helliwell|publisher=Dover Publications, Inc|year=2006|isbn=978-0-486-44572-4}} Originally published by Stanford University Press, Stanford, California (1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

The wavelengths of  VLF waves (10–100&amp;nbsp;km) are already comparable with the height of the ionospheric D-layer (about 70&amp;nbsp;km during the day, and 90 &amp;nbsp;km during the night). Therefore, ray theory is only  applicable for propagation over short distances, while mode theory must be used for larger distances. The region between Earth's surface and the ionospheric D-layer behaves thus like a waveguide for VLF- and ELF-waves.

In the presence of the ionospheric plasma and the [[geomagnetic field]], [[electromagnetic waves]] exist for frequencies which are larger than the [[gyrofrequency]] of the ions (about 1&amp;nbsp;Hz).  Waves with frequencies smaller than the gyrofrequency are called hydromagnetic waves. The geomagnetic pulsations with periods of seconds to minutes as well as [[Alfvén waves]] belong to that type of waves.

==Transfer function==
The prototype of a short vertical rod  antenna is a vertical electric [[Hertz]] dipole in which electric alternating currents of frequency f flow. Its radiation of electromagnetic waves within the Earth-ionospheric waveguide can be described by a transfer function T(ρ,ω):

(2) {{pad|4em}} E&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;(ρ,ω) = T(ρ,ω) E&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;(ρ,ω)

where E&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; is the vertical component of the electric field  at the receiver in a distance ρ from the transmitter, E&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the electric field of a Hertzian dipole in free space, and ω = 2πf the [[angular frequency]]. In free space, it is T = 1. Evidently, the Earth–ionosphere waveguide is dispersive because the transfer function depends on frequency. This means that phase- and [[group velocity]] of the waves are frequency dependent.

==Ray theory==
In the VLF range, the transfer function  is the sum of a ground wave which arrives directly at the receiver and multihop sky waves reflected at the ionospheric D-layer (Figure 1).
 
For the real Earth's surface, the  ground wave becomes dissipated and depends of the orography along the ray path.&lt;ref name="Wait"&gt;Wait, J.R., Electromagnetic Waves in   Stratified Media, McMillan, New York, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; For VLF waves at shorter distances, this effect is, however, of minor importance, and the reflection factor of the Earth is R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 1, in a first approximation.

At shorter distances, only the first hop sky wave is of importance. The D-layer can be simulated by a magnetic wall (R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = -1) with a fixed boundary at a virtual  height h, which means a phase jump of 180° at the reflection point.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wait"/&gt; In reality, the electron density of the D-layer increases with altitude, and the wave is bounded as shown in Figure 2.

The sum of ground wave and first hop wave displays an interference pattern with interference minima if the difference between the ray paths of ground and first sky wave is half a wavelength (or a phase difference of 180°). The last interference minimum on the ground (z = 0) between the ground wave and the first sky wave is at a horizontal  distance of

(3) {{pad|4em}}ρ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 2 f h&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/c

with c the velocity of light. In the example of Figure 3, this is at about  500&amp;nbsp;km distance.

==Wave mode theory==
The theory of ray propagation of VLF waves breaks down at larger distances because in the sum of these waves successive multihop sky waves are involved, and the sum diverges. In addition, it becomes necessary to take into account the spherical Earth.  Mode theory 
which is the sum of eigen-modes in the Earth–ionosphere waveguide is valid in this range of distances.&lt;ref name="Wait"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Budden, K.G., "The Propagation of Radiowaves", Cambridge, University Press, Cambridge, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; The wave modes have fixed vertical structures of their vertical electric field components with maximum amplitudes at the bottom and zero amplitudes at the top of the waveguide. 
In the case of the fundamental first mode, it is a quarter wavelength.  With decreasing frequency, the eigenvalue becomes imaginary at the [[cutoff frequency]], where the mode changes to an evanescent wave. For the first mode, this happens at&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;

(4) {{pad|4em}} f&lt;sub&gt;co&lt;/sub&gt; = c/(4h) ≈ 1&amp;nbsp;kHz
 
below which that mode will not propagate (Figure 4).

The attenuation of the modes increases with wavenumber n. Therefore, essentially only the first two modes are involved in  the wave propagation The first interference minimum between these two modes is at the same distance as that of the last interference minimum of ray  theory (eq.&amp;nbsp;3) indicating the equivalence of both theories&lt;ref name="Volland"&gt;Volland, H., "Atmospheric Electrodynamics", Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;
As seen in Figure 3, the spacing between the mode interference minima is constant and about 1000&amp;nbsp;km in this example. The first mode becomes dominant at distances greater than about 1500&amp;nbsp;km, because the second mode is more strongly attenuated than the first mode.

In the range of ELF waves, only mode theory is appropriate. The fundamental mode is the zeroth mode (Figure 4). The D-layer becomes here an electric wall (R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 1). Its vertical structure is simply a vertical electric field constant with altitude.

In particular, a resonance zeroth mode  exists for waves which are an integral part of the Earth's circumference and has the frequency

(5) {{pad|4em}} f&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = mc/(2aπ)  {{pad|2em}} ( m = 1, 2, ...)

with the Earth's radius. The first resonance peaks are at 7.5, 15,  and 22,5&amp;nbsp;Hz. These are the [[Schumann resonances]]. The spectral signals from lightning are amplified at those frequencies.&lt;ref name="Wait"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Nick 2002 "&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nickolaenko A. P. |author2=M. Hayakawa | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht-Boston-London | year=2002|title= Resonances in the Earth–ionosphere cavity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waveguide characteristics==
The above discussion merely illustrates a simple picture of mode and ray theory. More detailed treatments require a large computer program. In particular, it is difficult to 
solve the problem of the horizontal and vertical inhomogeneities of the waveguide. The effect of the Earth's curvature is, that near the antipode the field strength slightly increases.&lt;ref name="Wait"/&gt; Due to the influence of the Earth' magnetic field, the medium becomes anisotropic so that the ionospheric reflection factor in reality is a matrix. This means that a vertically polarized incident wave after reflection at the ionospheric D-layer converses to a vertically and a horizontally polarized wave. Moreover, the geomagnetic field gives rise to a nonreciprocity of VLF waves.  Waves propagating from east to west are more strongly attenuated than vice versa. There appears a phase slipping near the distance of the deep interference minimum of eq.&amp;nbsp;(3). During the times of sunrise and/or sunset, there is sometimes a phase gain or loss of 360° because of the irreversible behavior of the first sky wave.

The dispersion characteristics of the Earth-ionospheric waveguide can be used for locating thunderstorm activity by measurements of the difference of the group time delay of lightning signals ([[sferics]]) at adjacent frequencies up to distances of 10000&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="Volland"/&gt; The Schumann resonances allow to determine the global lightning activity.&lt;ref name=" Heckman "&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Heckman S. J. |author2=E. Williams | title= Total global lightning inferred from Schumann resonance measurements | journal= J. Geophys.

Arithmetically the EROEI can be defined as:
: &lt;math&gt;  EROEI = \frac{\hbox{Energy Delivered}}{\hbox{Energy Required to Deliver that Energy}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hall CA 2013" /&gt;

When the EROEI of a source of energy is less than or equal to one, that energy source becomes a net "energy sink", and can no longer be used as a source of energy, but depending on the system might be useful for energy storage (for example a battery). A related measure '''Energy Store On Energy Invested (ESOEI)''' is used to analyse storage systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energystoragereport.info/eroi-energy-return-on-investment-energy-storage/|title=Why energy storage is a dead-end industry - Energy Storage Report|date=15 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=c3e&gt;http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2013/ee/c3ee41973h&lt;/ref&gt;

To be considered viable as a prominent fuel or energy source a fuel or energy must have an EROEI ratio of at least 3:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Non-manmade energy inputs ==
The natural or primary energy sources are not included  in the calculation of energy invested, only the human-applied sources.
For example, in the case of biofuels the [[solar insolation]] driving [[photosynthesis]] is not included, and the energy used in the stellar synthesis of [[fissile]] elements is not included for [[nuclear fission]].  The energy returned includes only human usable energy and not wastes such as [[waste heat]].

Nevertheless, heat of any form can be counted where it is actually used for heating. However the use of waste heat in [[district heating]] and [[water desalination]] in [[cogeneration]] plants is rare, and in practice it is often excluded in EROEI analysis of energy sources.

== Relationship to net energy gain ==
EROEI and ''[[Net energy gain|Net energy (gain)]]'' measure the [[Energy quality|same quality of an energy source]] or sink in numerically different ways. Net energy describes the amounts, while EROEI measures the ratio or efficiency of the process.  They are related simply by

: &lt;math&gt; \hbox{GrossEnergyYield}  \div \hbox{EnergyExpended}  =  EROEI &lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;(\hbox{NetEnergy} \div \hbox{EnergyExpended} ) + 1 =  EROEI &lt;/math&gt;

For example, given a process with an EROEI of 5, expending 1 unit of energy yields a net energy gain of 4 units.  The break-even point happens with an EROEI of 1 or a net energy gain of 0. The [[Payback period|time]] to reach this break-even point is called energy payback period (EPP) or [[Crystalline silicon#Energy payback time|energy payback time]] (EPBT).&lt;ref&gt;

== Low carbon power ==
===Photovoltaic===
The issue is still subject of numerous studies, and prompting academic argument. That's mainly because the "energy invested" critically depends on technology, methodology, and system boundary assumptions, resulting in a range from a maximum of 2000 kWh/m² of module area down to a minimum of 300 kWh/m² with a median value of 585 kWh/m² according to a meta-study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dale, M. | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = and Benson, S.M. | year = 2013 | title = ''Energy balance of the global photovoltaic (PV) industry -- is the PV industry a net electricity producer?''.

Regarding output, it obviously depends on the local insolation, not just the system itself, so assumptions have to be made.

Some studies (see below) include in their analysis that photovoltaic produce electricity, while the invested energy may be lower grade [[primary energy]].

A 2015 review in [[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]] assessed the energy payback time and EROI of solar photovoltaics. In this study, which uses an insolation of 1700/kWh/m²/yr and a system lifetime of 30 years, mean harmonized EROIs between 8.7 and 34.2 were found. Mean harmonized energy payback time varied from 1.0 to 4.1 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhandari | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2015 | title = ''Energy payback time (EPBT) and energy return on energy invested (EROI) of solar photovoltaic systems: A systematic review and meta-analysis''. In | url = | journal = [[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]] | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 133–141 | doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2015.02.057 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raugei, Fullana-i-Palmer and Fthenakis found EROEI in the range of 5.9 to 11.8 and 19 to 39 for the major commercial PV types in South European installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Raugei M., Fullana-i-Palmer P., Fthenakis V., The energy return on energy investment (EROI) of photovoltaics: Methodology and comparisons with fossil fuel life cycles.

&lt;/ref&gt;
The low range assumes that primary energy and electricity are of the same quality, whereas the high range (19-39) is calculated by converting the electricity output of PV to primary energy as recommended by the IEA PVPS Task 12 LCA Methodology Guidelines they contributed to write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/ |title=Fthenakis V., R. Frischknecht,  M. Raugei,  H. C. Kim, E. Alsema,  M. Held and M. de Wild-Scholten, 2011, Methodology Guidelines on Life Cycle Assessment of Photovoltaic Electricity, 2nd edition, International Energy Agency, Report IEA-PVPS T12-03:2011, November 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Fthenakis determined the EROEI to be as high as 60 for the least energy consuming thin-film PV technology installations in the U.S. Southwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clca.columbia.edu/7B_SolarToday%20June12_c.pdf |title=Fthenakis V., PV Energy ROI Tracks Efficiency Gains, Solar Today, American Solar Energy Society, 26(4), 24-26, 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind turbines===
The EROI of [[wind turbine]]s depends on invested energy in the turbine, produced energy and life span of a turbine. In the scientific literature EROIs normally vary between 20 and 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zimmermann | first1 =  | year = 2013 | title = Parameterized tool for site specific LCAs of wind energy converters | url = | journal = The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 49–60 | doi = 10.1007/s11367-012-0467-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

High per-capita energy use has been considered desirable as it is associated with a high standard of living based on energy-intensive machines. A society will generally exploit the highest available EROEI energy sources first, as these provide the most energy for the least effort. This is an example of [[David Ricardo]]'s best-first principle. Then progressively lower quality ores or energy resources are used as the higher-quality ones are either exhausted or in use, for example, wind turbines positioned in the windiest areas.

In regard to fossil fuels, when oil was originally discovered, it took on average one barrel of oil to find, extract, and process about 100 barrels of oil. The ratio, for discovery of fossil fuels in the United States, has declined steadily over the last century from about 1000:1 in 1919 to only 5:1 in the 2010s.&lt;ref name="Hall CA 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Although many qualities of an energy source matter (for example oil is energy-dense and transportable, while wind is variable), when the EROEI of the main sources of energy for an economy fall that energy becomes more difficult to obtain and its [[relative price]] may increase.

Since the invention of agriculture, humans have increasingly used exogenous sources of energy to multiply human muscle-power.
Some historians have attributed this largely to more easily exploited (i.e. higher EROEI) energy sources, which is related to the concept of [[Energy Slave|energy slaves]].  [[Thomas Homer-Dixon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Homer-Dixon |first=Thomas  |authorlink=Thomas Homer-Dixon |title=The Upside of Down; Catastrophe, Creativity and the Renewal of Civilisation |year=2007 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=978-1-59726-630-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rvk6tsE4UDcC}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that a falling EROEI in the Later Roman Empire was one of the reasons for the collapse of the Western Empire in the fifth century CE.  In "The Upside of Down" he suggests that EROEI analysis provides a basis for the analysis of the rise and fall of civilisations.  Looking at the maximum extent of the [[Roman Empire]], (60 million) and its technological base the agrarian base of Rome was about 1:12 per hectare for wheat and 1:27 for alfalfa (giving a 1:2.7 production for oxen).  One can then use this to calculate the population of the Roman Empire required at its height, on the basis of about 2,500–3,000 [[calories]] per day per person.  It comes out roughly equal to the area of food production at its height.  But [[Environmental degradation|ecological damage]] ([[deforestation]], soil fertility loss particularly in southern Spain, southern Italy, Sicily and especially north Africa) saw a collapse in the system beginning in the 2nd century, as EROEI began to fall.  It bottomed in 1084 when Rome's population, which had peaked under [[Trajan]] at 1.5 million, was only 15,000.  Evidence also fits the cycle of [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n and Cambodian collapse too. [[Joseph Tainter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tainter |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Tainter |title=The Collapse of Complex Societies |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location= |year=1990 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M4H-02d9oE0C&amp;printsec=frontcover |isbn=052138673X}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that diminishing returns of the EROEI is a chief cause of the collapse of complex societies, which has been suggested as caused by [[peak wood]] in early societies.  Falling EROEI due to depletion of high quality fossil fuel resources also poses a difficult challenge for industrial economies, and could potentially lead to declining economic output and challenge the concept (which is very recent when considered from a historical perspective) of perpetual economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morgan |first=Tim |date=2013 |title=Life After Growth |location=Petersfield, UK|publisher=Harriman House |isbn=9780857193391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Garrett links EROEI and [[GDP deflator|inflation]] directly, based on a [[Thermodynamics#System models|thermodynamic]] analysis of historical [[world energy consumption]] (Watts) and accumulated global [[wealth]] (US dollars). This economic growth model indicates that global EROEI is the [[Involution (mathematics)|inverse]] of global inflation over a given time interval. Because the model aggregates supply chains globally, local EROEI is outside its scope.&lt;ref name="Garrett 2012" &gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.5194/esd-3-1-2012| title = No way out?

J.| bibcode = 2012ESD.....3....1G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oil sands ==
Because much of the energy required for producing oil from oil sands (bitumen) comes from low value fractions separated out by the upgrading process, there are two ways to calculate EROEI, the higher value given by considering only the external energy inputs and the lower by considering all energy inputs, including self generated.  See: [[Oil sands#Input energy]]&lt;ref&gt;Brandt 2013&lt;/ref&gt; "utilized detailed energy production and consumption data reported by oil sands producers from 1970 to 2010 to examine trends in historical energy returns from oil sands extraction. " They argued that by 2010, NERs (net energy returns) from oil sands mining and in situ operations had become significantly more energy efficient since 1970 although the NER remained significantly less efficient than conventional oil production. NERs from the oil sands, grew from "1.0 GJ/GJ in 1970 (entirely from the Suncor mining operation) to 2.95 GJ/GJ in 1990 and then to 5.23 GJ/GJ in 2010." &lt;ref name="Brandt2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brandt | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Englander | first2 = J. | last3 = Bharadwaj | first3 = S. | title = The energy efficiency of oil sands extraction: Energy return ratios from 1970 to 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.energy.2013.03.080 | journal = Energy | volume = 55 | pages = 693 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }} "Current oil sands operations have mine mouth NERs (net energy returns) of about 6 GJ output per GJ of energy consumed and point of use energy returns of about 3 GJ/GJ."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of EROEI==
EROEI is calculated by dividing the energy output by the energy input. However, researchers disagree on how to determine energy input accurately and therefore arrive at different numbers for the same source of energy.&lt;ref&gt;Mason Inman. [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/eroi-behind-numbers-energy-return-investment/ Behind the Numbers on Energy Return on Investment]. ''Scientific American'', April 1, 2013. [https://web.archive.org/web/20171223202459/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/eroi-behind-numbers-energy-return-investment/ Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the form of energy of the input can be completely different from the output.  For example, energy in the form of coal could be used in the production of ethanol. This might have an EROEI of less than one, but could still be desirable due to the benefits of liquid fuels (assuming the latters are not used in the processes of extraction and transformation).

How deep should the probing in the supply chain of the tools being used to generate energy go? For example, if steel is being used to drill for oil or construct a nuclear power plant, should the energy input of the steel be taken into account? Should the energy input into building the factory being used to construct the steel be taken into account and amortized? Should the energy input of the roads which are used to ferry the goods be taken into account? What about the energy used to cook the steelworkers' breakfasts? These are complex questions evading simple answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Does a Change in Price of Fuel Affect GDP Growth? An Examination of the US Data from 1950–2013 |first1=Michael |last1=Richards |first2= Charles  |last2=Hall |year=2014 |journal=Energies |volume=7 |pages=6558–6570 |doi=10.3390/en7106558 |url=http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/7/10/6558/htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A full accounting would require considerations of [[opportunity costs]] and comparing total energy expenditures in the presence and absence of this economic activity.

However, when comparing two energy sources a standard practice for the supply chain energy input can be adopted. For example, consider the steel, but don't consider the energy invested in factories deeper than the first level in the supply chain.

Richards and Watt propose an ''Energy Yield Ratio'' for photovoltaic systems as an alternative to EROEI (which they refer to as ''Energy Return Factor''). The difference is that it uses the design lifetime of the system, which is known in advance, rather than the actual lifetime. This also means that it can be adapted to multi-component systems where the components have different lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Permanently dispelling a myth of photovoltaics via the adoption of a new net energy indicator |first1=B.S. |last1=Richards |first2= M.E. |last2=Watt |year=2006 |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2004.09.015 |url=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/sustainable/refs/solar/Myth.pdf |format=PDF |volume=11 |pages=162–172}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue with EROI that many studies attempt to tackle is that the energy returned can be in different forms, and these forms can have different utility. For example, electricity can be converted more efficiently than thermal energy into motion, due to electricity's lower entropy.

==Additional EROEI Calculations==
There are three prominent expanded EROEI calculations, they are point of use, extended and societal. Point of Use EROEI expands the calculation to include the cost of refining and transporting the fuel during the refining process. Since this expands the bounds of the calculation to include more production process EROEI will decrease.&lt;ref name="Hall CA 2013"/&gt; Extended EROEI includes point of use expansions as well as including the cost of creating the infrastructure needed for transportation of the energy or fuel once refined.&lt;ref&gt;Hall CA, Lambert JG, Balogh SB. 2013. EROEI of different fuels and the implications for society. Energy Policy. 141–52&lt;/ref&gt; Societal EROI is a sum of all the EROEIs of all the fuels used in a society or nation. A societal EROI has never been calculated and researchers believe it may currently be impossible to know all variables necessary to complete the calculation, but attempted estimates have been made for some nations. Calculations done by summing all of the EROEIs for domestically produced and imported fuels and comparing the result to the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), a tool often used to understand well-being in a society.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert JG, Hall CA, Balogh S, Gupta A, Arnold M. 2014. Energy, EROI and quality of life. Energy Policy.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this calculation, the amount of energy a society has available to them increases the quality of life for the people living in that country and countries with less energy available also have a harder time satisfying citizens’ basic needs.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert JG, Hall CA, Balogh S, Gupta A, Arnold M. 2014. Energy, EROI and quality of life. Energy Policy. 153–67 &amp; Arvesen A, Hertwich EG. 2014. More caution is needed when using life cycle assessment to determine energy return on investment (EROI). Energy Policy. 1–6&lt;/ref&gt; This is to say that societal EROI and overall quality of life are very closely linked.

==ESOEI==
ESOEI (or ESOI&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) is used when EROEI is below 1. "ESOI&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the ratio of electrical energy stored over the lifetime of a storage device to the amount of embodied electrical energy required to build the device."&lt;ref name=c3e/&gt;

==EROEI under rapid growth==
A related recent concern is [[energy cannibalism]] where energy technologies can have a limited growth rate if climate neutrality is demanded. Many energy technologies are capable of replacing significant volumes of [[fossil fuels]] and concomitant [[Green house gases#Anthropogenic greenhouse gases|green house gas emissions]]. Unfortunately, neither the enormous scale of the current fossil fuel energy system nor the necessary growth rate of these technologies is well understood within the limits imposed by the [[net energy]] produced for a growing industry. This technical limitation is known as [[energy cannibalism]] and refers to an effect where rapid growth of an entire energy producing or energy efficiency industry creates a need for energy that uses (or cannibalizes) the energy of existing power plants or production plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climate2008.net/?a1=pap&amp;cat=1&amp;e=61 |title=Limitations of Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Technologies Set by Rapid Growth and Energy Cannibalism |author=Pearce, J.M. |publisher=Klima |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817071517/http://www.climate2008.net/?a1=pap&amp;cat=1&amp;e=61 |archivedate=2009-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{visible anchor|solar breeder}} overcomes some of these problems.  A solar breeder is a photovoltaic panel manufacturing plant which can be made energy-independent by using energy derived from its own roof using its own panels. Such a plant becomes not only energy self-sufficient but a major supplier of new energy, hence the name solar breeder. Research on the concept was conducted by Centre for Photovoltaic Engineering, University of New South Wales, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azimuthproject.org/azimuth/show/Solar+breeder |title=The Azimuth Project: Solar Breeder |accessdate=2011-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |bibcode=1978pvse.conf..825L |title=The solar breeder |work=Proceedings, Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conference, Luxembourg, September 27–30, 1977 |first=Joseph |last=Lindmayer |publisher=D. Reidel Publishing |location=Dordrecht |year=1978 |pages=825–835 |isbn=9027708894 |oclc=222058767}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reported investigation establishes certain mathematical relationships for the solar breeder which clearly indicate that a vast amount of net energy is available from such a plant for the indefinite future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Solar Breeder |first=Joseph |last=Lindmayer |year=1977 |publisher=NASA |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23885550_Solar_breeder_Energy_payback_time_for_silicon_photovoltaic_systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solar module processing plant at [[Frederick, Maryland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The BP Solarex Facility Tour in Frederick, MD |url=http://scodpub.wordpress.com/2010/03/29/2003-bp-solarex-tour/ |publisher=Sustainable Cooperative for Organic Development|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was originally planned as such a solar breeder. In 2009 the [[Sahara Solar Breeder Project]] was proposed by the ''Science Council of Japan'' as a cooperation between [[Japan]] and [[Algeria]] with the highly ambitious goal of creating hundreds of GW of capacity within 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically breeders of any kind can be developed. In practice, nuclear [[breeder reactor]]s are the only large scale breeders that have been constructed as of 2014, with the 600 [[MWe]] [[BN-600]] and 800 MWe [[BN-800 reactor]], the two largest in operation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10228">'''Ethical naturalism''' (also called '''moral naturalism''' or '''naturalistic cognitivistic definism''')&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garner|Rosen|1967|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] view which claims that:

# Ethical [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s express [[proposition]]s.
# Some such propositions are true.
# Those propositions are made true by objective features of the world, independent of human opinion.
# These moral features of the world ''are'' [[reductionism|reducible]] to some set of non-moral features

==Overview==
It is important to distinguish the versions of ethical naturalism which have received the most sustained philosophical interest, for example, [[Cornell realism]], from the position that "the way things are is always the way they ought to be", which few ethical naturalists hold. Ethical naturalism does, however, reject the [[fact-value distinction]]: it suggests that inquiry into the natural world can increase our moral knowledge in just the same way it increases our scientific knowledge. Indeed, proponents of ethical naturalism have argued that humanity needs to invest in the [[science of morality]], a broad and loosely defined field that uses evidence from biology, primatology, anthropology, psychology, neuroscience, and other areas to classify and describe moral behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Science of Morality|url=https://www.edge.org/event/the-new-science-of-morality|website=edge.org|publisher=Edge Foundation, Inc.|accessdate=Oct 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Greg|title=The Roots of Morality|url=http://people.stern.nyu.edu/jhaidt/articles/miller.2008.roots-of-morality.science.pdf|accessdate=October 27, 2017|agency=Science Magazine|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|date=9 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical naturalism encompasses any reduction of ethical properties, such as 'goodness', to non-ethical properties; there are many different examples of such reductions, and thus many different varieties of ethical naturalism. [[Hedonism]], for example, is the view that goodness is ultimately just [[pleasure]].

==Criticisms==
Ethical naturalism has been criticized most prominently by [[ethical non-naturalist]] [[G. E. Moore]], who formulated the [[open-question argument]]. Garner and Rosen say that a common definition of "natural property" is one "which can be discovered by sense observation or experience, experiment, or through any of the available means of science." They also say that a good definition of "natural property" is problematic but that "it is only in criticism of naturalism, or in an attempt to distinguish between naturalistic and nonnaturalistic definist theories, that such a concept is needed."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garner|Rosen|1967|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[R. M. Hare]] also criticised ethical naturalism because of its fallacious definition of the terms 'good' or 'right' explaining how value-terms being part of our prescriptive moral language are not reducible to descriptive terms: "Value-terms have a special function in language, that of commending; and so they plainly cannot be defined in terms of other words which themselves do not perform this function".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hare|M.R.|1964|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moral relativism===
When it comes to the moral questions that we might ask, it can be difficult to argue that there is not necessarily some level of [[Moral relativism|meta-ethical relativism]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} – and failure to address this matter is criticized as [[ethnocentrism]]. [[File:The punishment of Bessus by Andre Castaigne (1898-1899).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Could torture under certain conditions be "wrong" for a species?]]

As a broad example of relativism, we would no doubt see very different moral systems in an alien race that can only survive by occasionally ingesting one another. As a narrow example, there would be further specific moral opinions for each individual of that species.

Some forms of [[moral realism]] are compatible with some degree of meta-ethical relativism. This argument rests on the assumption that one can have a "moral" discussion on various scales; that is, what is "good" for: a certain part of your being (leaving open the possibility of conflicting motives), you as a single individual, your family, your society, your species, your type of species. For example, a [[moral universalism|moral universalist]] (and certainly an [[Moral absolutism|absolutist]]) might argue that, just as one can discuss what is 'good and evil' at an individual's level, so too can one make certain "moral" propositions with truth values relative at the level of the species. In other words, the moral relativist need not deem ''all'' moral propositions as necessarily subjective. The answer to "''is free speech normally good for human societies?''" is relative in a sense, but the moral realist would argue that an individual can be incorrect in this matter. This may be the philosophical equivalent of the more pragmatic arguments made by some scientists.

===Moral nihilism===
[[Moral nihilism|Moral nihilists]] maintain that any talk of an objective morality is incoherent and better off using other terms. Proponents of [[Science of morality|moral science]] like Ronald A. Lindsay have counter-argued that their way of understanding "morality" as a practical enterprise is the way we ought to have understood it in the first place. He holds the position that the alternative seems to be the elaborate philosophical reduction of the word "moral" into a vacuous, useless term.&lt;ref name=Ron&gt;[http://www.centerforinquiry.net/centerstage/episodes/episode_24_bioethics_and_public_policy_part_1 Center Stage | Episode 24 – Bioethics and Public Policy, Part 1]. Center for Inquiry (2010-04-12). Retrieved on 2011-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsay adds that it is important to reclaim the specific word "Morality" because of the connotations it holds with many individuals.

==Morality as a science==

{{Main|Science of morality}}

Author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] has argued that we overestimate the relevance of many arguments against the science of morality, arguments he believes scientists happily and rightly disregard in other domains of science like physics. For example, scientists may find themselves attempting to argue against philosophical [[Skepticism|skeptics]], when Harris says they should be practically asking – as they would in any other domain – "why would we listen to a [[solipsism|solipsist]] in the first place?" This, Harris contends, is part of what it means to practice a science of morality.

Physicist [[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]] believes that conceiving of morality as a science could be a case of [[scientific imperialism]] and insists that what is "good for conscious creatures" is not an adequate working definition of "moral".&lt;ref name="blogs.discovermagazine.com"&gt;[http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/03/29/sam-harris-responds/ Sam Harris Responds | Cosmic Variance | Discover Magazine]. Blogs.discovermagazine.com. Retrieved on 2011-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition, Vice President at the [[Center for Inquiry]], John Shook, claims that this working definition is more than adequate for science at present, and that disagreement should not immobilize the scientific study of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/sam_harris_vs._the_philosophers_on_morality/ Sam Harris vs. The Philosophers on Morality]. Center for Inquiry (2010-05-14). Retrieved on 2011-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the collective ''The End of Christianity'', Richard Carrier's chapter "Moral Facts Naturally Exist (and Science Could Find Them)" sets out to propose a form of [[moral realism]] centered on human satisfaction.{{Explain|date=June 2018|reason=What Carrier says and why Carrier contribution is worth mention VS other philosophers }}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=W. Loftus (ed.) |first1=John |title=The end of Christianity |date=2011 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, N.Y. |isbn=9781616144135 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=kXbaUE8cT64C&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Shishapangma.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Sam Harris argues that there are societally optimal "moral peaks" to discover.]]
In modern times, many thinkers discussing the [[fact–value distinction]] and the [[is–ought problem]] have settled on the idea that one cannot derive ''ought'' from ''is''. Conversely, Harris maintains that the fact-value distinction is a confusion, proposing that values are really a certain kind of fact. Specifically, Harris suggests that values amount to empirical statements about "the flourishing of conscious creatures in a society". He argues that there are objective answers to moral questions, even if some are difficult or impossible to possess in practice. In this way, he says, science can tell us what to value. Harris adds that we do not demand absolute certainty from predictions in physics so we should not demand that of a science studying morality (see ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'').

The '''Explorer Ridge''' is a [[mid-ocean ridge]], a [[Divergent boundary|divergent]] [[plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] boundary located about {{convert|241|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of [[Vancouver Island]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. It lies at the northern extremity of the Pacific spreading axis. To its east is the [[Explorer Plate]], which together with the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] and the [[Gorda Plate]] to its south, is what remains of the once-vast [[Farallon Plate]] which has been largely [[subduction|subducted]] under the [[North American Plate]]. The Explorer Ridge consists of one major segment, the Southern Explorer Ridge, and several smaller segments. It runs northward from the [[Sovanco Fracture Zone]] to the [[Queen Charlotte Triple Junction]], a point where it meets the [[Queen Charlotte Fault]] and the northern [[Cascadia subduction zone]].

==Geology==
This divergent boundary first formed about 5-7 million years ago when the northern end of the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] broke off along the [[Nootka Fault]] to form the [[Explorer Plate]]. This apparently had some important ramifications for regional geologic evolution. When this change was completed, [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade Arc]] volcanism from [[Northern California]] to southwestern British Columbia returned and the present-day [[Cascade Range]] and [[Olympic Mountains]] started to form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/geo_history_wa/Cascade%20Episode.htm The Cascade Episode] Retrieved on 2008-06-10&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[oceanic crust]] is moving away from the Explorer Ridge to either side. On the eastern side the eastward moving Explorer Plate is being subducted under the [[North American Plate]]. The belt of [[volcano]]es along the [[Pacific Ranges]] are the direct results of this collision. The western side of the Explorer Ridge is associated with the northwest trending [[Pacific Plate]] which has formed the [[Queen Charlotte Fault]], an active [[transform fault]] along the coast of British Columbia and southeast [[Alaska]].

The Explorer Ridge is also [[seismology|seismically]] active. Most seismicity recorded in this area occurred on or near the Explorer Transform Fault Zone. The relatively shallow depth of the Southern Explorer Ridge (up to 1800 m) in comparison with most other segments of the northeast Pacific spreading centers suggests that there has been considerable volcanic activity along this segment in the past 100,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/02fire/background/plan/plan.html NOAA Ocean Explorer: Submarine Ring of Fire] Retrieved on 2008-06-16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable features along the ridge==
The Explorer Ridge includes a deep [[rift valley]] which runs along the axis of the ridge along nearly its entire length. This rift marks the actual boundary between adjacent tectonic plates, where [[magma]] from the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] reaches the seafloor, erupting as [[lava]] and producing new crustal material for the plates.

Before 2002 Explorer Ridge was the least explored of the northeast Pacific spreading centers, even though it was known to have robust hydrothermal activity and is [[seismology|seismically]] active.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/vents/explorer_site.html Vents Program: Explorer Ridge] Retrieved on 2008-06-10&lt;/ref&gt; Along the Southern Explorer Ridge lies a large [[hydrothermal vent]] area called [[Magic Mountain (hydrothermal vent)|Magic Mountain]]. It is an unusual hydrothermal site, with its off-axis location and relatively long-lived activity. The source of the hydrothermal fluid that fuels Magic Mountain probably rises along fault systems associated with a recent episode of rifting that, in turn, followed a massive outpouring of lava. These vents are forming [[seafloor massive sulfide deposits]] on the ocean floor. Many strange deep-water creatures have been found here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/02fire/logs/jul29/jul29.html NOAA Ocean Explorer: Submarine Ring of Fire] Retrieved on 2008-06-10&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fast oil recovery (FOR)''' is a term comprising various innovative systems which can be built into a new [[ship]] or integrated into an old ship, thus facilitating efficient and safe removal of an [[oil spill]] from a wrecked vessel. The drastic consequences resulting from an oil spill, especially damages to [[marine life]], has resulted in an increased demand for ships more prepared to respond to a possible oil accident. There are about 50 million ships in North America, and c. 1% [[oil leak|leak oil]] into the waters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fastoilrecovery.com/oil_recovery.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Ships that do not leak oil into the ship's [[bilge water]] have installed Fast Oil Recovery Systems (FORS), with the goal of eliminating all oil-contaminated bilge water. Their systems remove 99.9% of the oil in a vessel's [[bilge]], saving thousands of dollars. Such systems are used instead of [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]] pads and [[Filter (chemistry)|filters]] due to the latter being messier, more expensive, and requiring high maintenance. Many companies like JLMD&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jlmdsystem.com/en/Accueil.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and Blue Water&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bwesglobal.com/oilrecovery.htm&lt;/ref&gt; have started making these systems to help the environment.

Research has shown that during wreckages, [[ship grounding|groundings]], and other [[crisis]] situations, the oil, trapped in the ship, requires complex procedures and technologies for recovery. Ship-owners, shipping authorities, [[Marine salvage|salvage]] companies, and others can experience difficulties reaching the tanks to pump out the remaining [[pollutant]]s onboard. The weaknesses of current procedures and the lack of equipment on board of the ship is often apparent in such endeavors.

'''Fibrils''' (from the [[Latin]] ''fibra''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=fibril|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are structural biological materials found in nearly all living organisms. Not to be confused with [[fibers]] or [[protein filament|filament]]s, fibrils tend to have diameters ranging from 10-100&amp;nbsp;nanometers (whereas fibers are micro to milli-scale structures and filaments have diameters approximately 10-50 nanometers in size). Fibrils are not usually found alone but rather are parts of greater hierarchical structures commonly found in biological systems. Due to the prevalence of fibrils in biological systems, their study is of great importance in the fields of [[microbiology]], [[biomechanics]], and [[materials science]].

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Structure and mechanics==

'''Fibrils''' are composed of linear [[biopolymers]], and are characterized by rod-like structures with high length to diameter ratios. Oftentimes, they spontaneously arrange into helical structures. In [[biomechanics]] problems, fibrils can be characterized as classical beams with a roughly circular cross-sectional area on the nanometer scale. As such, simple [[beam bending]] equations can be applied to calculate flexural strength of fibrils under ultra-low loading conditions. Like most biopolymers, stress-strain relationships of fibrils tend to show a characteristic toe-heel region before a linear, [[Hooke's Law|elastic region]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847798939661|title=Fibrillar Structure and Mechanical Properties of Collagen |language=en|access-date=2017-03-31|doi=10.1006/jsbi.1998.3966|volume=122|journal=Journal of Structural Biology|pages=119–122 | last1 = Fratzl | first1 = Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike biopolymers, Fibrils do not behave like homogeneous materials, as yield strength has been shown to vary with volume, indicating structural dependencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shen|first=Zhilei L.|last2=Dodge|first2=Mohammad Reza|last3=Kahn|first3=Harold|last4=Ballarini|first4=Roberto|last5=Eppell|first5=Steven J.|date=2008-10-15|title=Stress-Strain Experiments on Individual Collagen Fibrils|journal=Biophysical Journal|volume=95|issue=8|pages=3956–3963|doi=10.1529/biophysj.107.124602|issn=0006-3495|pmc=2553131|pmid=18641067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in structure between fibrils of different origin is typically determined by x-ray diffraction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM) can be used to observe specific details on larger fibril species such as the characteristic 67&amp;nbsp;nm bands in collagen, but often is not fine enough to determine the full structure.

[[Hydrate|Hydration]] has been shown to produce a noticeable effect in the mechanical properties of fibrillar materials. The presence of water has been shown to decrease the stiffness of collagen fibrils, as well as increase their rate of stress relaxation and strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002192909290223N|title=Water content alters viscoelastic behaviour of the normal adolescent rabbit medial collateral ligament |language=en|access-date=2017-03-31|doi=10.1016/0021-9290(92)90223-N|volume=25|journal=Journal of Biomechanics|pages=831–837 | last1 = Chimich | first1 = D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From a biological standpoint, water content acts as a toughening mechanism for fibril structures, allowing for higher energy absorption and greater straining capabilities.

==Fibrillogenesis==
{{Main article|Fibrillogenesis}}
[[Fibrillogenesis]] is the expansion of fine fibrils which is common in [[collagen]] fibers of [[connective tissue]]. The definite mechanisms of fibrillogenesis are still unknown, although many hypotheses resulting from basic research help discover many possible mechanisms. In early experiments, collagen I could be distilled from tissues and recombined into fibrils with controlling the solutions. Later studies help understand the composition and structure of binding sites on the collagen monomers. Collagen is synthesized as a soluble precursor, procollagen, which supports collagen self-assembly. Since collagen fibrils have almost 50 binding components in vivo, the definite requirement to generate fibrillogenesis in vivo is still cryptic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kadler|first=Karl E|last2=Hill|first2=Adele|last3=Canty-Laird|first3=Elizabeth G|date=2017-05-02|title=Collagen fibrillogenesis: fibronectin, integrins, and minor collagens as organizers and nucleators|journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology|volume=20|issue=5–24|pages=495–501|doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2008.06.008|issn=0955-0674|pmc=2577133|pmid=18640274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With acidic or saline solution, collagen can be extracted from tissues and rearrange into fibril by changing temperature or pH value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gross|first=J.|last2=Kirk|first2=D.|date=1958-08-01|title=The heat precipitation of collagen from neutral salt solutions: some rate-regulating factors|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=233|issue=2|pages=355–360|issn=0021-9258|pmid=13563501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments discovered attractive force between collagen monomers which helps the rearrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prockop|first=D. J.|last2=Fertala|first2=A.|date=1998-06-19|title=Inhibition of the self-assembly of collagen I into fibrils with synthetic peptides. Demonstration that assembly is driven by specific binding sites on the monomers|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=273|issue=25|pages=15598–15604|issn=0021-9258|pmid=9624151|doi=10.1074/jbc.273.25.15598}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collagen serves as a precursor, procollagen, in synthesizing reaction, which identifies self-polymerization of collagen.

===Natural processes===

There are over 30 collagens in nature that are similar in chemical composition but differ in terms of crystal structure. By far, [[collagen I]] and II are the most abundant. They initiatively form fibrils in vitro, while fibronectin, fibronectin-binding, collagen-binding integrins and collagen V are essential for collagen I forming and collagen XI for collagen II forming. Therefore, cellular mechanisms play key role in the protein self-assembly process.

==In animals==

===Collagen===
{{Main article|Collagen}}
[[File:Collagen biosynthesis (en).png|thumb|319x319px|Structure of Collagen I fibrils]]
[[Collagen]] is the major structural protein outside cells in many connective tissues of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kadler|first=Karl E|last2=Hill|first2=Adele|last3=Canty-Laird|first3=Elizabeth G|date=2017-03-31|title=Collagen fibrillogenesis: fibronectin, integrins, and minor collagens as organizers and nucleators|journal=Current Opinion in Cell Biology|volume=20|issue=5–24|pages=495–501|doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2008.06.008|issn=0955-0674|pmc=2577133|pmid=18640274}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the primary component of connective tissue, it has the largest amount among protein in mammals, occupying 25% to 35% of the all protein content in body.

The fibrils in collagen are packed in a crimp structure. The stress/strain curve of collagen, such as tendon, can be subdivided into several regions. The region of small strains,"toe"region, corresponds to the removal of a macroscopic crimp, uncrimping, &amp;nbsp;in the collagen fibrils, visible in light microscope. At larger strains, "heel" and "linear" region, there's no further structural change visible.

[[Tropocollagen]] is the molecular component fiber, consisting of three left handed polypeptide chains (red, green, blue) coiled around each other, forming a right-handed triple helix.

===[[Actin]] and [[myosin]]===

Muscles contract and stretch via the steerable sliding/grasping of the [[myosin]] interacting with [[actin]] fibers. Actin consists of two polypeptides in a helix and myosin has a small heart-shaped structure, cross-bridge. The bind and unbind processes of cross-bridge attaching on actin filament help relative movement of these collagens and hence the whole muscle.

=== [[Elastin]] and [[keratin]] ===

[[Elastin]] is a fibrous protein common in various soft tissues, like skin, blood vessels and lung tissue. Each monomer connects with each other, forming a 3D network, with ability to endure over 200% strain before deformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gosilin|first=J.M.|last2=Aaron|first2=B.B|date=1981|title=Elastin as a Random-network elastomer, a mechanical and optical analysis of single elastin fibers|url=|journal=Biopolymers|volume=20|pages=1247–1260|doi=10.1002/bip.1981.360200611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Keratin]] is a structural protein mainly found in hair, nails, hooves, horns, quills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biology in Materials Science|last=Meyers|first=M. A.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basically keratin is formed by polypeptide chains, which coil into α-helices with sulfur cross-links or bond into β-sheets linked by hydrogen bonding. β-keratin, which is tougher than α-conformation, is more common in birds and reptiles.

===[[Resilin]] and [[spider silk]]===

[[Resilin]] is an elastomeric insect protein, consisting of both α-helices and β-sheets structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weis-Fough|first=T|date=1961|title=Molecular interpretation of the elasticity of resilin, a rubber-like protein|url=|journal=J. Mol. Biol.|volume=3|pages=648–667|doi=10.1016/s0022-2836(61)80028-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most resilient protein in nature. It has a low stiffness ~0.6MPa but a high energy restoring percentage ~98%, and efficiently helps flying insects to flap wings or fleas to jump.

[[Spider silk]] fibril is composed of stiff crystallized β-sheets structure, responsible for strength, and amorphous matrix surrounding, improving toughness and elongation ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denny|first=M. W.|last2=Gosline|first2=J.M|date=1986|title=The Structure and Properties of Spider Silk|url=|journal=Endeavor|volume=10|pages=37–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has exceptionally high tensile strength and ductility, with respectively low density, compared to other natural fibril. Its feature varies from different kinds of spider for different utility.

==In plants==
===Cellulose===
{{Main article| Cellulose}}
[[File:Cellulose spacefilling model.jpg|thumb|Space fill model of cellulose, prior to winding into fibrils]]
The primary cell wall derives its notable tensile strength from cellulose molecules, or long-chains of glucose residues stabilized by [[hydrogen bonding]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alberts|first=Bruce|date=2002|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell, 4th edition|url=|journal= Garland Science|volume=4|pages=1–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cellulose chains are observed to align in overlapping parallel arrays, with the similar polarity forming a cellulose microfibril. In plants, these cellulose microfibrils arrange themselves into layers, formally known as [[lamellae (disambiguation)|lamellae]], and are stabilized in the cell wall by surface, long cross-linking [[glycan molecules]]. Glycan molecules increase the complexity of the potential networks plant-based cellulose can configure itself into. Coextensive in the primary cell wall to both cellulose microfibrils and complementary glycan networks, is [[pectin]] which is a polysaccharide that contains many negatively charged galacturonic acid units.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Additionally,  cellulose microfibrils also contribute to the shape of the plant via controlled-cell expansion. The stereoscopic arrangement of microfibrils in the cell wall create systems of [[turgor pressure]] which ultimately leads to cellular growth and expansion.  Cellulose microfibrils are unique matrix macromolecules, in that they are assembled by cellulose synthase enzymes located on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is believed that the plant can “anticipate their future morphology by controlling the orientation of microfibrils” by a mechanism where cellulose microfibrils are arranged atop a cortical array of microtubules.

===Amylose===
{{Main article| Amylose}}
Stirring of a given sample of amylose  is said to form [[fibrillar crystals]] which are said to precipitate out of the mother liquor. These long fibrils can be imaged using electron microscopy revealing transverse striations resembling a [[shish-kebab]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Amylose fibrils are categorized with having one of two morphologies: ones with small rodlike fibrils and others with lath-shaped crystals.

===Wood=== 
The fibrillar structure of wood is said to play a significant role in both the mechanical stability and ability of wood to possess channels to transport minerals and water. Sprucewood (Picea abies), among others, are reported to possess cellulose fibrils with a normalized diameter of 2.5&amp;nbsp;nm. There is also a reported link between the age of the wood and the spiral angle of the fibrils with respect to the longitudinal direction.

==Biomimicry and fibrils==
=== Self-cleaning properties ===

In order to mimic the strong adhesion, easy detachment, and self-cleaning properties of a [[gecko toe pad]], a fibrillar-based adhesive can be created. These performance features stem from the underlying hierarchical structure which consists of a million microfibrils called [[setae]] which further consists of billions of nano-sized branches called [[spatulae (biology)|spatulae]].

Mimicking this phenomenon involves four distinct design steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hu,
|first=Shihao|date=2012|title=Rational Design and Nanofabrication of Gecko-Inspired Fibrillar Adhesives|url=|journal= Nano Micro Small|volume=8|pages=2464–2468|doi=10.1002/smll.201200413}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Making a vertically aligned micro-/nano- fibrillar arrays 
# Creating various tip shapes 
# Including ansiotropic geometry 
# Building hierarchy.

=== A mature bone matrix ===

In order to mimic a mature bone matrix, self-assembled fibrils can be used to align a given mineral matrix. This is accomplished using a self-assembling molecule with a hydrophobic alkyl tail and a hydrophilic oligopeptide head. These molecules form micellar structures in situ, and disulfide bridges at low pH, leading to the formation and crystallization of 200 kDa polymeric nanofibrils.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} The mineral matrix ultimately interacts with the synthetic fibril via a phosphoserine residue which results in mineral nucleation and growth.

The '''Gzhelian''' is an [[age (geology)|age]] in the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]] [[geologic timescale]] or a [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] in the [[stratigraphic column]]. It is the youngest stage of the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]], the youngest [[system (stratigraphy)|subsystem]] of the [[Carboniferous]]. The Gzhelian lasted from {{Period start|Gzhelian}} to {{Period start|Asselian}} [[Megaannum|Ma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Gradstein, F.M.; Ogg, J.G. &amp; Smith, A.G.}}; '''2004''': ''A Geologic Time Scale 2004'', [[Cambridge University]] Press&lt;/ref&gt; It follows the [[Kasimovian]] age/stage and is followed by the [[Asselian]] age/stage, the oldest subdivision of the [[Permian]] system.

The Gzhelian is more or less coeval with the [[Stephanian (stage)|Stephanian]] stage of the regional stratigraphy of Europe.

==Name and definition==
The Gzhelian is named after the [[Russia]]n village of [[Gzhel (selo), Moscow Oblast|Gzhel]] ({{lang-ru|Гжель}}), nearby [[Ramensky District|Ramenskoye]], not far from [[Moscow]]. The name and [[Type locality (geology)|type locality]] were defined by Sergei Nikitin (1850–1909) in 1890.

The base of the Gzhelian is at the first appearance of the [[Fusulinida]] [[genus|genera]] ''[[Daixina]]'', ''[[Jigulites]]'' and ''[[Rugosofusulina]]'', or at the first appearance of the [[conodont]] ''Streptognathodus zethus''. The top of the stage (the base of the Permian system) is at the first appearance of the conodont ''[[Streptognathodus]] isolatus'' within the ''Streptognathus "wabaunsensis"'' chronocline.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Davydov, V.I.; Glenister, B.F.; Spinosa, C.; Ritter, S.M.; Chernykh, V.V.; Wardlaw, B.R. &amp; Snyder, W.S.}}; '''1998''': ''Proposal of Aidaralash as Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for base of the Permian System'', Episodes '''21'''(1): pp 11-18, {{cite web |url=http://www.episodes.org/backissues/211/11-18-vladimir.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928122140/http://www.episodes.org/backissues/211/11-18-vladimir.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Six meters higher in the reference profile, the Fusulinida species ''[[Sphaeroschwagerina]] vulgaris aktjubensis'' appears.

At the moment (2008), a [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point|golden spike]] for the Gzhelian stage is yet lacking. A candidate is a section along the Ussolka river (a [[tributary]] of the [[Belaya River (Kama)|Belaya]] river) at the edge of the hamlet of Krasnoussolsky, about 120 kilometres south-east of [[Ufa]] and 60 kilometres north-east of [[Sterlitamak]] (in [[Bashkortostan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Chernykh, V.V.; Chuvashov, B.I.; Davydov, V.I.; Schmitz, M. &amp; Snyder, W.S.}}; '''2006''': ''Usolka section (southern Urals, Russia): a potential candidate for GSSP to define the base of the Gzhelian Stage in the global chronostratigraphic scale'' Geologija '''49'''(2): pp 205–217, {{cite web |url=http://www.geo-zs.si/publikacije_arhiv/Clanki/Geologija_49_2/205-218_chernykh.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214152438/http://www.geo-zs.si/publikacije_arhiv/Clanki/Geologija_49_2/205-218_chernykh.pdf |archivedate=2007-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biozones==
The Gzhelian stage is subdivided into five [[biozone]]s, based on the conodont genus ''[[Streptognathodus]]'':
* ''Streptognathodus wabaunsensis'' and ''Streptognathodus bellus'' Zone
* ''Streptognathodus simplex'' Zone
* ''Streptognathodus virgilicus'' Zone
* ''Streptognathodus vitali'' Zone
* ''Streptognathodus simulator'' Zone

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11744">[[File:Helium flash.svg|thumbnail|right|Fusion of helium in the core of low mass stars.]]
A '''helium flash''' is a very brief [[thermal runaway]] [[nuclear fusion]] of large quantities of [[helium]] into [[carbon]] through the [[triple-alpha process]] in the core of low mass [[star]]s (between 0.8 [[solar mass]]es ({{Solar mass|link=yes}}) and 2.0 {{Solar mass}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://astro.uni-bonn.de/~nlanger/siu_web/ssescript/new/chapter9.pdf Chapter 9: Post-main sequence evolution through helium burning]&lt;/ref&gt;) during their [[red giant]] phase (the [[Sun]] is predicted to experience a flash 1.2 billion years after it leaves the [[main sequence]]). A much rarer runaway helium fusion process can also occur on the surface of [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accreting]] [[white dwarf]] stars.

Low mass stars do not produce enough [[gravity|gravitational]] pressure to initiate normal helium fusion. As the hydrogen in the core is exhausted, some of the helium left behind is instead compacted into [[degenerate matter]], supported against [[gravitational collapse]] by [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] pressure rather than [[ideal gas law|thermal pressure]]. This increases the density and temperature of the core until it reaches approximately 100 million [[kelvin]], which is hot enough to cause helium fusion (or "helium burning") in the core.

However, a fundamental quality of degenerate matter is that changes in temperature do not produce a change of volume of the matter until the thermal pressure becomes so very high that it exceeds degeneracy pressure. In main sequence stars, [[hydrostatic equilibrium|thermal expansion]] regulates the core temperature, but in degenerate cores this does not occur. Helium fusion increases the temperature, which increases the fusion rate, which further increases the temperature in a runaway reaction. This produces a flash of very intense helium fusion that lasts only a few minutes, but briefly emits energy at a rate comparable to the entire [[Milky Way]] galaxy.

In the case of normal low mass stars, the vast energy release causes much of the core to come out of degeneracy, allowing it to thermally expand, however, consuming as much energy as the total energy released by the helium flash, and any left-over energy is absorbed into the star's upper layers. Thus the helium flash is mostly undetectable to observation, and is described solely by astrophysical models. After the core's expansion and cooling, the star's surface rapidly cools and contracts in as little as 10,000 years until it is roughly 2% of its former radius and luminosity. It is estimated that the electron-degenerate helium core weighs about 40% of the star mass and that 6% of the core is converted into carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~infocom/The%20Website/end.html |title= The End Of The Sun |first= David |last= Taylor |website= North Western }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Red giants==
[[File:White Dwarf Resurrection.jpg|thumb|[[Sakurai's Object]] is a [[white dwarf]] undergoing a helium flash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White Dwarf Resurrection|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1531a/|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the [[red giant]] phase of [[stellar evolution]] in stars with less than 2.0 {{Solar mass}} the [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen ceases in the core as it is depleted, leaving a helium-rich core. While fusion of hydrogen continues in the star’s shell causing a continuation of the accumulation of helium ash in the core, making the core denser, the temperature still is unable to reach the level required for helium fusion, as happens in more massive stars. Thus the thermal pressure from fusion is no longer sufficient to counter the gravitational collapse and create the [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] found in most stars. This causes the star to start contracting and increasing in temperature until it eventually becomes compressed enough for the helium core to become [[degenerate matter]]. This degeneracy pressure is finally sufficient to stop further collapse of the most central material but the rest of the core continues to contract and the temperature continues to rise until it reaches a point ({{val|p=≈|1|e=8|ul=K}}) at which the helium can ignite and start to fuse.&lt;ref name=Hansen2004&gt;{{cite book|title=Stellar Interiors - Physical Principles, Structure, and Evolution|last=Hansen|first=Carl J.|last2=Kawaler|first2=Steven D.|last3=Trimble|first3=Virginia|isbn=978-0387200897 |date=2004|edition=2|publisher=Springer|pages=62–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seeds2012&gt;{{cite book|title=Foundations of Astronomy|last=Seeds|first=Michael A.|last2=Backman|first2=Dana E.|pages=249–51|date=2012|edition=12|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=978-1133103769}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Karttunen2007&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamental Astronomy|isbn=978-3540341437|edition=5|page=249|editor-first=Hannu|editor-last=Karttunen|editor2-first=Pekka|editor2-last=Kröger|editor3-first=Heikki|editor3-last=Oja|editor4-first=Markku|editor4-last=Poutanen|editor5-first=Karl Johan|editor5-last=Donner|publisher=Springer|date=2007-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The explosive nature of the helium flash arises from its taking place in degenerate matter. Once the temperature reaches 100 million–200 million [[kelvin]] and helium fusion begins using the [[triple-alpha process]], the temperature rapidly increases, further raising the helium fusion rate and, because degenerate matter is a good [[Thermal conduction|conductor of heat]], widening the reaction region.

However, since degeneracy pressure (which is purely a function of density) is dominating thermal pressure (proportional to the product of density and temperature), the total pressure is only weakly dependent on temperature.  Thus, the dramatic increase in temperature only causes a slight increase in pressure, so there is no stabilizing cooling expansion of the core.

This runaway reaction quickly climbs to about 100 billion times the star's normal energy production (for a few seconds) until the temperature increases to the point that thermal pressure again becomes dominant, eliminating the degeneracy. The core can then expand and cool down and a stable burning of helium will continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 317| pages = 724–732| last = Deupree| first = R. G.|author2=R. K. Wallace| title = The core helium flash and surface abundance anomalies| journal = Astrophysical Journal| date = 1987|bibcode = 1987ApJ...317..724D| doi = 10.1086/165319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A star with mass greater than about 2.25 {{Solar mass}} starts to burn helium without its core becoming degenerate, and so does not exhibit this type of helium flash. In a very low-mass star (less than about 0.5 {{Solar mass}}), the core is never hot enough to ignite helium. The degenerate helium core will keep on contracting, and finally becomes a [[White dwarf#Stars with very low mass|helium white dwarf]].

The helium flash is not directly observable on the surface by electromagnetic radiation. The flash occurs in the core deep inside the star, and the net effect will be that all released energy is absorbed by the entire core, leaving the degenerate state to become nondegenerate. Earlier computations indicated that a nondisruptive mass loss would be possible in some cases,&lt;ref name="Deupree1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Deupree|first1= R.

==Binary white dwarfs==

When hydrogen gas is accreted onto a ''white dwarf'' from a binary companion star, the hydrogen can fuse to form helium for a narrow range of accretion rates, but most systems develop a layer of hydrogen over the degenerate white dwarf interior. This hydrogen can build up to form a shell near the surface of the star. When the mass of hydrogen becomes sufficiently large, runaway fusion causes a [[nova]]. In a few binary systems where the hydrogen fuses on the surface, the mass of helium built up can burn in an unstable helium flash. In certain binary systems the companion star may have lost most of its hydrogen and donate helium-rich material to the compact star. Note that similar flashes occur on [[X-ray burster|neutron stars]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

=={{Anchor|shell helium flash}}Shell helium flash==

'''Shell helium flashes''' are a somewhat analogous but much less violent, nonrunaway helium ignition event, taking place in the absence of degenerate matter. They occur periodically in [[asymptotic giant branch]] stars in a shell outside the core. This is late in the life of a star in its giant phase. The star has burnt most of the helium available in the core, which is now composed of carbon and oxygen. Helium fusion continues in a thin shell around this core, but then turns off as helium becomes depleted. This allows hydrogen fusion to start in a layer above the helium layer. After enough additional helium accumulates, helium fusion is reignited, leading to a thermal pulse which eventually causes the star to expand and brighten temporarily (the pulse in luminosity is delayed because it takes a number of years for the energy from restarted helium fusion to reach the surface&lt;ref name = "Wood"/&gt;). Such pulses may last a few hundred years, and are thought to occur periodically every 10,000 to 100,000 years.&lt;ref name = "Wood"&gt;{{Cite journal

After the flash, helium fusion continues at an exponentially decaying rate for about 40% of the cycle as the helium shell is consumed.&lt;ref name = "Wood"/&gt; Thermal pulses may cause a star to shed circumstellar shells of gas and dust.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

{{Ancient Greek religion}}

In [[Ancient Greek religion]], '''Hestia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛ|s|t|i|ə|,_|ˈ|h|ɛ|s|tʃ|ə}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἑστία}}, "hearth" or "fireside") is a virgin [[goddess]] of the [[hearth]], [[ancient Greek architecture|architecture]], and the right ordering of domesticity, the family, the home, and the state. In [[Greek mythology]], she is a daughter of [[Cronus|Kronos]] and [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]].&lt;ref name="Graves"&gt;{{cite book|last=Graves|first=Robert|title=Greek Gods and Heroes|chapter=The Palace of Olympus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hestia received the first offering at every sacrifice in the household. In the public domain, the hearth of the ''[[prytaneum]]'' functioned as her official sanctuary. With the establishment of a new colony, flame from Hestia's public hearth in the mother city would be carried to the new [[Colonies in antiquity|settlement]]. Her Roman equivalent is [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]];&lt;ref name=Lar&gt;Hughes, James. (1995). ''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', p.&amp;nbsp;215. Larousse/[[The Book People]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] equates the [[Scythian religion|Scythian]] [[Tabiti]] with her.

== Origins and cults ==
Hestia's name means "hearth, fireplace, altar",&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 471.&lt;/ref&gt; stemming from the same root as the English verbal form ''[[:wikt:was|was]]'' ([[Proto-Indo-European|PIE]] ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h₂wes-|*h₂wes-]]'' "to live, dwell, pass the night"&lt;ref&gt;Calvert Watkins, "wes-", in: ''The American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots''. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Boston 1985 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080626081035/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE579.html web archive]).&lt;/ref&gt;). It thus refers to the ''[[oikos]]'', the household, house, or family. "An early form of the temple is the hearth house; the early temples at [[Dreros]] and [[Prinias]] on Crete are of this type as indeed is the temple of [[Apollo]] at [[Delphi]] which always had its inner ''hestia''".&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, p.&amp;nbsp;61.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mycenaean great hall (''[[megaron]]''), like [[Homer]]'s hall of [[Odysseus]] at [[Ithaca]], had a central hearth. Likewise, the hearth of the later Greek ''[[prytaneum]]'' was the community and government's ritual and secular focus.

Hestia's name and functions show the hearth's importance in the social, religious, and political life of ancient Greece. It was essential for warmth, food preparation, and the completion of sacrificial offerings to deities; in the latter, Hestia was the "customary recipient of a preliminary, usually cheap, sacrifice".  She was also offered the first and last libations of wine at feasts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0138%3Ahymn%3D29:Perseus Homeric Hymn&amp;nbsp;29, tr. Evelyn-White, Hugh G.]&lt;/ref&gt; Her own sacrificial animal was a domestic pig.&lt;ref&gt;Bremmer, Jan. N., in Ogden, D. (Ed). (2010). ''A Companion to Greek Religion'', Wiley-Blackwell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yOQtHNJJU9UC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=%22+customary+recipient+of+a+preliminary,+usually+cheap,+sacrifice%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hd5eMvPrAG&amp;sig=iUdQ31aBlBEPUYOy9AmfEPdy0IE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CCt8T4__KsSG8gPEhYiaDQ&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%20customary%20recipient%20of%20a%20preliminary%2C%20usually%20cheap%2C%20sacrifice%22&amp;f=false Google Books preview, p. 134], {{ISBN|978-1-4443-3417-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The accidental or negligent extinction of a domestic hearth-fire represented a failure of domestic and religious care for the family; failure to maintain Hestia's public fire in her temple or shrine was a breach of duty to the broad community. A hearth fire might be deliberately, ritually extinguished at need, and its lighting or relighting should be accompanied by rituals of completion, purification and renewal, comparable with the rituals and connotations of an [[eternal flame]] and of [[sanctuary lamp]]s. At the level of the ''[[polis]]'', the hearths of Greek [[Colonies in antiquity|colonies]] and their mother cities were allied and sanctified through Hestia's cult. Hestia's nearest Roman equivalent, [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], had similar functions as a divine personification of Rome's "public", domestic, and colonial hearths, and bound Romans together within a form of extended family. The similarity of names between Hestia and Vesta is, however, misleading: "The relationship ''hestia-histie-Vesta'' cannot be explained in terms of [[Indo-European studies|Indo-European]] linguistics; borrowings from a third language must also be involved," according to [[Walter Burkert]].&lt;ref&gt;Burkert,  p. 415, 3.3.1 n.&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Responsibility for Hestia's domestic cult usually fell to the leading woman of the household, sometimes to a man. Hestia's rites at the hearths of public buildings were usually led by holders of civil office; [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] testifies that the ''[[prytaneum]]'' of a Greek state or community was sacred to Hestia, who was served by the most powerful state officials.&lt;ref&gt;Kajava, p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of her priesthoods is extremely rare. Most stems from the early Roman Imperial era, when [[Sparta]] offers several examples of women with the priestly title "Hestia"; [[Chalcis]] offers one, a daughter of the local elite. Existing civic cults to Hestia probably served as stock for the grafting of Greek [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)#Greek|ruler-cult]] to the Roman emperor, the Imperial family and Rome itself. In Athens, a small seating section at the [[Theatre of Dionysus]] was reserved for priesthoods of "Hestia on the [[Acropolis]], [[Livia]], and [[Julia the Elder|Julia]]", and of "Hestia Romaion" ("Roman Hestia", thus "The Roman Hearth" or Vesta). A priest at [[Delos]] served "Hestia the Athenian [[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|Demos]]" (the people or state) "and [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]]". An eminent citizen of [[Caria]]n [[Stratonicea (Caria)|Stratoniceia]] described himself as a priest of Hestia and several other deities, as well as holding several civic offices. Hestia's political and civic functions are further evidenced by her very numerous privately funded dedications at civic sites, and the administrative rather than religious titles used by the lay-officials involved in her civic cults.&lt;ref&gt;Kajava, pp.&amp;nbsp;1, 3, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temples===
Every private and public hearth or ''[[prytaneum]]'' was regarded as a sanctuary of the goddess, and a portion of the sacrifices, to whatever divinity they were offered, belonged to her. A statue of her reportedly existed in the Athenian Prytaneum: 
:"Hard by is the Prytaneon (Prytaneum) [the town-hall of Athens] . . . and figures are placed of the goddesses [[Eirene (goddess)|Eirene]] and Hestia."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 1. 18. 3 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.) &lt;/ref&gt;
There was however very few temples dedicated to Hestia. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] mention only two, in [[Ermioni]] and in [[Sparta]]: 
:"[At Hermione in Argolis :] Passing into the sanctuary of Hestia, we see no image, but only an altar, and they sacrifice to Hestia upon it.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 35. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [...] The Lakedaimonians (Lacedaemonians) also have a sanctuary of Hestia [at Sparta]."&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 3. 11. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

== Myths and attributes ==
[[File:Hestia - Wellesley College - DSC09634.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Statue of Hestia ([[Wellesley College]], [[Massachusetts]], USA)]]

Hestia is a goddess of the first Olympian generation. She was the eldest daughter of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] and [[Cronus]], and sister to [[Zeus]], [[Poseidon]], [[Demeter]], [[Hera]], and [[Hades]]. Immediately after their birth, Cronus swallowed all his children (Hestia was the first who was swallowed) except the last and youngest, Zeus, who forced Cronus to disgorge his siblings and led them in a war against their father and the other Titans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:453-491 453&amp;nbsp;ff.]&lt;/ref&gt; As "first to be devoured .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. and the last to be yielded up again", Hestia was thus both the eldest and youngest daughter; this mythic inversion is found in the [[Homeric Hymns|Homeric hymn]] to [[Aphrodite]] (700&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;Kereny, p.&amp;nbsp;91&lt;/ref&gt; Hestia rejects the marriage suits of Poseidon and Apollo, and swears herself to perpetual virginity. She thus rejects Aphrodite's values and becomes, to some extent, her chaste, domestic complementary, or antithesis. Aphrodite could not bend or ensnare her heart.&lt;ref name="Homeric Hymns, To Aphrodite"/&gt;

Zeus assigns Hestia a duty to feed and maintain the fires of the Olympian hearth with the fatty, combustible portions of animal sacrifices to the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Kajava, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Wherever food was cooked, or an offering was burnt, she thus had her share of honour; also, in all the temples of the gods she has a share of honour. "Among all mortals she was chief of the goddesses".&lt;ref name="Homeric Hymns, To Aphrodite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/HomericHymns3.html |title=Homeric Hymns, To Aphrodite}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hestia's Olympian status is equivocal. At Athens "in Plato's time," notes Kenneth Dorter&lt;ref&gt;Dorter, K. (1971). Imagery and Philosophy in Plato's Phaedrus. ''Journal of the History of Philosophy'', ''9''&amp;nbsp;(3), 279–288 (July 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; "there was a discrepancy in the list of the [[Twelve Olympians|twelve chief gods]], as to whether Hestia or [[Dionysus]] was included with the other eleven. The altar to them at the agora, for example, included Hestia, but the east frieze of the Parthenon had Dionysus instead." Hestia's omission from some lists of the Twelve Olympians is sometimes taken as illustration of her passive, non-confrontational nature – by giving her Olympian seat to the more forceful Dionysus she prevents heavenly conflict – but no ancient source or myth describes such a surrender or removal.&lt;ref&gt;Kereny, p.&amp;nbsp;92: "there is no story of Hestia's ever having taken a husband or ever having been removed from her fixed abode."&lt;/ref&gt; "Since the hearth is immovable Hestia is unable to take part even in the procession of the gods, let alone the other antics of the Olympians", Burkert remarks.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, p.&amp;nbsp;170.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mythographic status as firstborn of Rhea and Cronus seems to justify the tradition in which a small offering is made to Hestia before any sacrifice ("Hestia comes first").

Not so for every Greek in every generation, however: in ''Odyssey''&amp;nbsp;''14'', 432–436, the loyal swineherd [[Eumaeus]] begin the feast for his master Odysseus by plucking tufts from a boar's head and throwing them into the fire with a prayer addressed to all the powers, then carved the meat into seven equal portions: "one he set aside, lifting up a prayer to the forest [[nymph]]s and [[Hermes]], [[Maia]]'s son."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fagles' translation&lt;/ref&gt;

The ambiguities in Hestia's mythology are matched by her indeterminate attributes, character, and iconography. She is identified with the hearth as a physical object, and the abstractions of community and domesticity, but portrayals of her are rare and seldom secure.&lt;ref&gt;Kajava, p.&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt; In classical Greek art, she is occasionally depicted as a woman, simply and modestly cloaked in a head veil. She is sometimes shown with a staff in hand or by a large fire. She sat on a plain wooden throne with a white woolen cushion and did not trouble to choose an emblem for herself.&lt;ref name="Graves"/&gt;

Homeric Hymn&amp;nbsp;24, ''To Hestia'', is a brief invocation of five lines:
{{quote|Hestia, you who tend the holy house of the lord Apollo, the Far-shooter at goodly [[Delphi|Pytho]], with soft oil dripping ever from your locks, come now into this house, come, having one mind with Zeus the all-wise: draw near, and withal bestow grace upon my song.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0138%3ahymn%3d24 ''Hymn&amp;nbsp;24 to Hestia''].&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Homeric Hymn 29, ''To Hestia'', is another invocation for the goddess and to Hermes:
{{quote|Hestia, in the  high dwellings of all, both deathless gods and men who walk on earth, you  have gained an everlasting abode and highest honour: glorious is your portion  and your right. For without you mortals hold no banquet, -- where one does  not duly pour sweet wine in offering to Hestia both first and last. And you,  slayer of Argus, Son of Zeus and Maia, messenger of the blessed gods, bearer  of the golden rod, giver of good, be favourable and help us, you and Hestia,  the worshipful and dear. Come and dwell in this glorious house in friendship  together; for you two, well knowing the noble actions of men, aid on their  wisdom and their strength. Hail, Daughter of Cronos, and you also, Hermes,  bearer of the golden rod! Now I will remember you and another song also.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn]] 29, ''To Hestia'' {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is also an [[Orphic Hymn]] dedicated to Hestia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hellenicgods.org/orphic-hymn-to-hestia THE ORPHIC HYMN TO HESTIA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hestia Tapestry==
{{main|Hestia Tapestry}}
The Hestia Tapestry is a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[tapestry]], made in Egypt during the 6th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;AD. It is a late representation of the goddess, whom it identifies in [[Greek language|Greek]] as ''Hestia Polyolbos''; ({{lang-el|Ἑστία Πολύολβος}} "Hestia full of Blessings"). Its history and symbolism are discussed in Friedlander (1945).&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, Paul. (1945). ''Documents of Dying Paganism''. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:070421 Parc des Buttes Chaumont 002.jpg|thumb|The [[Parc des Buttes Chaumont]] is a picturesque landscape garden opened by [[Napoleon III]] in 1867.]] 
[[File:Expérience du globe aérostatique de MM Charles et Robert au Jardin des Thuileries le 1er décembre 1783 (2).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The first flight of a hydrogen balloon took place from the Tuileries garden on December 1, 1783.]]
[[File:Berges de la Seine 1.JPG|thumb|A "floating garden" of the [[Promenade des Berges de la Seine]] (2013), a 2.3 kilometer long park along the left bank of Seine in the 7th arrondissement.]]

Paris today has more than 421 municipal parks and gardens, covering more than three thousand hectares and containing more than 250,000 trees.&lt;ref name="Jarrassé, Dominique 2007"&gt;Jarrassé, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens''&lt;/ref&gt;{{vn|date=February 2018}} Two of Paris's oldest and most famous gardens are the [[Tuileries Garden]], created in 1564 for the [[Tuileries Palace]], and redone by [[André Le Nôtre]] in 1664;{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=125}}{{Full citation needed|date=April 2018}} and the [[Luxembourg Garden]], belonging to a château built for [[Marie de' Medici]] in 1612, which today houses the French Senate.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=208}}{{Full citation needed|date=April 2018}} The [[Jardin des Plantes]] was the first botanical garden in Paris, created in 1626 by [[Louis XIII]]'s doctor [[Guy de La Brosse]] for the cultivation of medicinal plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Le Jardin de Plantes |url=http://www.mnhn.fr/museum/foffice/tous/tous/guidePratique/lieuxVisiter/LieuxAVisiter/FLieuAVisiter.xsp?AE_ID=214&amp;INFO_ID=21&amp;LIEU_ID=158&amp;MAN_ID=273&amp;SITE_ID=10&amp;i=1&amp;idx=6&amp;nav=liste |publisher=Muséum national d’histoire naturelle |accessdate=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1853 and 1870, the Emperor [[Napoleon III]] and the city's first director of parks and gardens, [[Jean-Charles Alphand]], created the [[Bois de Boulogne]], the [[Bois de Vincennes]], [[Parc Montsouris]] and the [[Parc des Buttes Chaumont]], located at the four points of the compass around the city, as well as many smaller parks, squares and gardens in the neighborhoods of the city.&lt;ref name="Jarrassé, Dominique 2007"/&gt; One hundred sixty-six new parks have been created since 1977, most notably the [[Parc de la Villette]] (1987–1991) and [[Parc André Citroën]] (1992).&lt;ref name="Jarrassé, Dominique 2007"/&gt;

Some of the most notable recent gardens of Paris are not city parks, but parks belonging to museums, including the gardens of the [[Rodin Museum]] and the [[Musée du quai Branly]].

==From Roman times through the Middle Ages==
[[File:Palais de la Cite.jpg|thumb|right|The enclosed garden of the Palais de la Cité is visible in this illustration from the ''Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry'' (1410). The old garden is now the [[Place Dauphine]].]]
Gardens existed in Paris in Roman times and the Middle Ages, either to produce fruits, vegetables and medicinal herbs; for the meditation of monks; or for the pleasure of the nobility; but no trace remains of the original gardens of the Roman town of [[Lutetia]].

The royal palace on the [[Île de la Cité]] had a walled garden located at the southern point of the palace, near where the statue of Henry IV on the Pont Neuf is today. The garden disappeared when the [[Place Dauphine]] was built in the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Meunier, Florian, ''Le Paris du Moyen Âge'', pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;

The monasteries on the left bank had extensive gardens and orchards from the Middle Ages until the French Revolution. The [[Jardin des Plantes]] was built on land that originally belonged to the [[Abbey of St. Victor, Paris|Abbey of Saint Victor]]. and a large part of the Luxembourg Garden today belonged to the neighboring Monastery of the Chartreux. A small modern recreation of a Medieval garden is found today next to the [[Cluny Museum]], the former residence of Abbot of the [[Abbey of Cluny]].

==Renaissance Gardens and Gardens a la Française (1564-1700)==
In 1495, King [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] and his nobles imported the Renaissance garden style from Italy after their unsuccessful [[Italian War of 1494–1498]].{{sfn|Wenzler|2003|p=12}} The new [[French Renaissance garden]] was characterized by symmetrical and geometric planting beds or [[parterre]]s; plants in pots; paths of gravel and sand; terraces; stairways and ramps; moving water in the form of canals, [[Waterfall|cascades]] and monumental fountains, and extensive use of artificial [[grotto]]es, [[labyrinth]]s and statues of mythological figures. They also featured a long axis perpendicular to the palace, with bodies of water and a view of the whole garden, They were designed to illustrate the Renaissance ideals of measure and proportion, and to remind viewers of the virtues of [[Ancient Rome]].{{sfn|Wenzler|2003|p=13}} The French kings imported not only the ideas, but also Italian gardeners, landscape architects, and fountain-makers to create their gardens. The first examples in France were far from Paris, where there was more space for big gardens; the gardens of the royal [[Château d'Amboise]] (1496), the [[Château de Blois]] (c. 1500), [[Château de Fontainebleau]] (1528), and the [[Château de Chenonceau]] (1521), with additions by [[Catherine de' Medici]] in 1560.

In the mid-17th century, under [[Louis XIV]], the [[French formal garden]], or ''Jardin a la française'', gradually replaced the Renaissance style garden; it was more formal and geometric, and symbolized the dominance of the King over nature. The most famous example was the [[gardens of Versailles]], made by [[André Le Nôtre]] beginning in 1661. Le Nôtre remade the Tuileries Gardens in the new style beginning in 1664.

===Jardins des Tuileries (1564)===

[[File:Monet-Tuileries-Marmottan.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Jardin des Tuileries]] painted by [[Claude Monet]] (1876)]]
The first royal garden of the [[Renaissance]] in Paris was the [[Jardin des Tuileries]], created for [[Catherine de' Medici]] in 1564 to the west of her new [[Tuileries Palace]]. It was inspired by the gardens of her native [[Florence]], particularly the [[Boboli Gardens]], and made by a Florentine gardener, Bernard de Carnesecchi. The garden was laid out along the Seine, and divided into squares of fruit trees and vegetable gardens divided by perpendicular alleys and by boxwood hedges and rows of cypress trees. Like Boboli, it featured a [[grotto]], with [[faience]] "monsters" designed by [[Bernard Palissy]], whom Catherine had assigned to discover the secret of Chinese porcelain.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrassé, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], the old garden was rebuilt, following a design of [[Claude Mollet]], with the participation of Pierre Le Nôtre, the father of the famous garden architect. A long terrace was built on the north side, looking down at the garden, and a circular basin was constructed, along with an octagonal basin on the central axis.

In 1664 he garden was remade again by [[André Le Nôtre]] in the style of the classic [[French formal garden]], with parterres bordered with low shrubs and bodies of water organized along a wide central axis. He added the ''Grand Carré'' around the circular basin at the east end of the garden, and the horseshoe-shaped ramp at the west end, leading to a view of the entire garden.

In 1667, [[Charles Perrault]], the author of [[Sleeping Beauty]] and other famous fairy tales, proposed to [[Louis XIV]] that the garden be opened at times to public. His proposal was accepted, and the public (with the exception of soldiers in uniform, servants and beggars) were allowed on certain days to promenade in the park.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrassé, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cours-la-Reine (Cours-Albert-I) (1616)===
[[File:Cours-la-Reine 2.JPG|thumb|right|The Cours-la-Reine (1616)]]
The [[Cours-la-Reine]] (part of which today is named Cours-Albert-I after the King of Belgium during the First World War) was created by [[Marie de' Medici]], who, like Catherine de' Medici, was nostalgic for her native [[Florence]] It was a long promenade (1.5 kilometers) along the Seine originally planted in with four long rows of elm trees. Built before the Champs Elysees, it was a popular promenade for the nobility, on foot or on horseback.

===Place Royale (now Place des Vosges) (1605–1612)===
Place Royale (renamed [[Place des Vosges]] in 1800) is a residential square and public park ordered by [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] and built between 1605 and 1612. In his ordinance, the King called for "a place to promenade for the residents of Paris who are closely pressed together in their houses."&lt;ref&gt;Jarrassé, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'' p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The square was 108 meters long on each side, and lined with houses of the same height and in the same style. The center of the square was empty until 1639, when it was filled with a statue on horseback of [[Louis XIII]]. The square was divided in flower beds and lawns by diagonal alleys. The statue was destroyed during the [[French Revolution]], then replaced with a new statue in 1822 during the Restoration. Four fountains were added in 1840.

===Place Dauphine (1607) and Square du Vert-Galant (1884) ===
[[File:Square du Vert-Galant 001.jpg|thumb|right|The Square du Vert-Galant at the Île de la Cité, takes its name from Henry IV, famous for his romantic affairs.]]
[[Place Dauphine]] was the second planned residential square, after the Place-Royale, built by order of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]. It was located on the southern point of the Île de la Cité, on the site of the garden of the old royal palace. It was named for the future King Louis XIII, and was built in the shape of triangle, with the point touching the [[Pont Neuf]], which had been finished in 1606. A statue of Henry IV on horseback was placed on the bridge at the entrance to the square in 1614, at the suggestion of his widow, [[Marie de' Medici]]. The original statue was destroyed during the French Revolution, but was replaced by a new statue in 1821.

The construction of the bridge joined two small islands to the Île de la Cité; one of these islands had been the site where the last Grand Master of the [[Knights Templar]], [[Jacques DeMolay]] had been burned at the stake in 1314. The point of the island below the bridge and the statue of Henry IV was turned into a public park in 1884, dedicated to ''Vert-Galant'', the "gallant green", the nickname of Henry IV, famous for his numerous romantic affairs.

===Jardin des Plantes (1626)===
[[File:Jardin du roi 1636.png|thumb|right|the [[Jardin des Plantes]] in 1636, when it was the ''Jardin royal des herbs medicinales'']]
The [[Jardin des Plantes]], originally called the ''Jardin royal des herbes médicinales'', was opened in 1626, under the supervision of [[Guy de La Brosse]], the physician of King Louis XIII. Its original purpose was to provide medicines for the court. It was built on land purchased from the neighboring [[Abbey of Saint Victor, Paris|Abbey of Saint Victor]]. A labyrinth and belvedere from 1840 can still be seen in the northwest section of the garden. In 1640, it became the first Paris garden to open to the public.

In the eighteenth century, under the French natural scientist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], who directed it from 1739 to 1788, the garden was doubled in size by an exchange of land with the Abbey, extending down to the banks of the Seine, and was greatly expanded with the addition of trees and plants brought by French explorers from around the world. One can see today a ''[[Robinia]]'' tree planted in 1636, and a [[sophora]] from 1747.

In 1793, after the Revolution, the royal garden became the National Museum of Natural History, and a zoo was added. with animals brought from the Palace of Versailles. The garden was expanded again, and a school of botany founded. The first greenhouse was built in 1833 by [[Charles Rohault de Fleury]], a pioneer in the use of iron in architecture. The first of the large greenhouses seen today was built by [[Jules André]] in 1879; the greenhouse of cactuses by Victor Blavette in 1910; and the tropical greenhouse, 55 meters long, by René Berger in 1937. The alpine garden was added in 1931, and the rose garden and the ''Jardin des vivaces'' were added in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrassé, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', pp. 59–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jardin du Luxembourg (1630)===
[[File:Palais du Luxembourg on 1652 Gomboust map - Geographicus.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Luxembourg Garden]] in 1652]]
[[File:Luxembourg Gardens, the Medici fountains, Paris, France-LCCN2001698553.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Medici Fountain]] in the Luxembourg Garden]]
The [[Jardin du Luxembourg]] was created by [[Marie de' Medici]], the widow of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] between 1612 and 1630. It was placed behind the [[Luxembourg Palace]], an imitation of the [[Pitti Palace]] in her native [[Florence]]. She began by planting two thousand elm trees, and commissioned a Florentine gardener, [[Tommaso Francini]], to build the terraces and parterres, and the circular basin the center. The [[Medici Fountain]] was probably also the work of Francini, though it is sometimes attributed to [[Salomon de Brosse]], the architect of the palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dominique Massounie |author2=Béatrice de Andia |author3=Daniel Rabreau |title=Paris et ses fontaines, de la Renaissance à nos jours |trans-title=Paris and its fountains, from the Renaissance to the present day |editor1=Dominique Massounie |editor2=Pauline Prevost-Marcilhacy |editor3=Daniel Rabreau |publisher=Délegation à l'action artistique de la Ville de Paris |location=Paris |date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Marie de' Medici's death, the garden was largely neglected. The last royal owner was the Count de Provence, the future King [[Louis XVII]]I, who sold the eastern part of the garden for building lots.

After the French Revolution, the government of the [[French Directory]] nationalized the large ''pépiniére'', or nursery, of the neighboring monastery of Chartreux, and attached it to the garden. In 1862, during the Second Empire, [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]] replanted and restored the gardens, but also took a portion of the nursery in order to make room for two new streets, Rue Auguste Comte and Place André Honnorat. The Medici fountain was moved back to make room for the Rue de Medicis, and the present long basin and the statuary were added to the fountain.

During the reign of [[Louis-Philippe]], who was fond of heroes of French history, the garden was decorated with the statues of the Queens of France and French women saints. During the [[French Third Republic]], the government added the statues of writers, painters, composers, mythical figures, and a miniature of the Statue of Liberty by [[Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi]]. bringing the number of statues to more than seventy.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrassé, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', pp. 65–70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jardin du Palais-Royal (1629) ===
[[File:Palais-Royal on the map of Turgot 1739 - Kyoto U.jpg|thumb|left|Gardens of the Palais Royal in 1739]]
[[File:Vue du jardin du palais royal, avec le nouveau cirque.jpg|thumb|right|View of the Palais-Royal gardens in 1807, showing the circus, or riding hall.]]
The garden of the [[Palais-Royal]] was built by [[Cardinal Richelieu]], after he bought the hôtel d'Angennes in 1623 and turned it into his own residence, the Palais-Cardinal. When he died he left it to [[Louis XIV]], who had played in the gardens as a child, and in 1643 it became the Palais-Royal. The garden, designed by [[Claude Desgots]], featured two rows of elm trees, elaborate parterres and ornamental flower beds, statues, fountains and two basins, and a grove of trees at one end. It became the property of Monsieur, the brother of Louis XIV, in 1692, and thereafter belonged to members of Orleans branch of the dynasty. After the death of Louis XIV, it became the residence of the Regent, [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], whose dissolute lifestyle provoked many scandals. The gardens became a popular meeting place for writers, and also a place frequented by prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionnaire Historique de Paris'', pp. 532–533.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fire destroyed much of the Palais in 1773, and the owner, [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], decided to turn it into a profit-making establishment. He built an arcade of shops and cafés encircling the garden, with residences above, with a wooden gallery for promenading around the garden. A circus was established in the center for horseback riding. Since it was private property, he police were not permitted access. In the years before and after the Revolution, the garden and surrounding buildings became the meeting place for revolutionaries, for political debate, gambling and higher-class prostitution. The Theatre-Francaise, the future [[Comédie-Française]], was established there in 1787. During the Revolution, the garden and arcade was nationalized, and the heads of those guillotined were on several occasions carried on pikes by a crowd around the garden, in front of the diners in the cafes. The owner of the garden, though he supported the Revolution and changed his name to Philippe-Egalité, was guillotined in 1793.

After the Restoration, the new Duke of Orleans, Louis-Philippe recovered his property, and returned it to respectability. He expelled the gambling salons and prostitutes, and had the garden and arcade rebuilt into roughly the way they look today. The Palais-Royale was burned by the Communards in May 1871, along with the Tuileries Palace and other symbols of royalty, and were rebuilt. During the 20th century, the residences overlooking the garden were the home of many French celebrities, including [[André Malraux]], [[Jean Cocteau]] and [[Colette]]. and Two works of modern sculpture were added in 1986; an arrangement of columns, by [[Daniel Buren]], and a fountain-sculpture of steel balls, by [[Pol Bury]].&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionnaire Historique de Paris'', p. 534&lt;/ref&gt;

==English gardens and follies (1700–1800)==
[[File:PalaisDeL'Elysée.jpg|thumb|right|Gardens of the [[Élysée Palace]], the residence of the President of France (1722) were the largest private gardens in Paris before the Revolution.]]
Beginning in the mid-18th century, the [[French landscape garden]] began to replace the more formal and geometric ''jardin a la français''. The new style originated in England in the early 18th century as the [[English landscape garden]] or Anglo-Chinese garden. It was inspired by the idealized romantic landscapes and the paintings of [[Hubert Robert]], [[Claude Lorrain]] and [[Nicolas Poussin]], European ideas about [[Chinese garden]]s, and the philosophy of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].{{sfn|Baltrušaitis|1978}}{{Full citation needed|date=April 2018}}{{sfn|Wenzler|2003|p=27}} The earliest example of the style in France was the [[French landscape garden#The Moulin Joli .281754-1772.29|''Moulin Joli'']] (1754–1772), along the Seine between [[Colombes]] and [[Argenteuil]]. the most famous was the ''Jardin de la Reine'' of [[Marie Antoinette]] in the [[gardens of Versailles]] (1774–1779).

In the late 18th century the Paris town houses of the French aristocracy, both on the right bank and left bank, usually had gardens in the English style. The largest private gardens in Paris were (and still are) those of the [[Élysée Palace]] (1722), now the residence of the President of France. and of the [[Hôtel Matignon]] (1725), the official residence of the Prime Minister of France (neither is open to the public).

The [[folly]] was a specific kind of Paris park that appeared in the end of the eighteenth century. Privately owned but open to the public, they were designed for both amusement and instruction, filled with architectural models from different parts of the world and different centuries. Most of the early Paris follies had a short life and were divided into building lots: the most famous follies were the Follies of Bouexière (1760), Boutin (1766), Beaujon (1773) and [[Folie Saint James]] (1777–1780). The one survivor, much transformed, is the Parc Monceau.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrassé, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parc Monceau (1778) ===
[[File:Carmontelle - Parc Monceau 1.jpg|thumb|left|An illustration by [[Louis Carrogis Carmontelle]] of the follies he created for [[Parc Monceau]].]]
[[File:Parc Monceau 20060812 03.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Egyptian pyramid in [[Parc Monceau]], the garden of "all times and places" (1778).]]
[[Parc Monceau]] was established by [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Phillippe d'Orléans, Duke of Chartres]], a cousin of King [[Louis XVI]], wealthy, and active in court politics and society. In 1769 he had begun purchasing the land where the park is located. In 1778, he decided to create a public park, and employed the writer and painter [[Louis Carrogis Carmontelle]] to design the gardens. In 1778, when the garden opened, Carmontelle was accused of imitating the English garden. In his book of images of the garden published in 1779, he responded: "It is not at all an English garden that we made at Monceau... we reunited in one single garden all times and all places. It is a simple fantasy, the desire to have an extraordinary garden, a pure amusement, and not a desire to imitate a nation, which, in making "natural" gardens, runs a roller over all the lawns and ruins nature."&lt;ref&gt;cited in Jarrassé, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; The park contained dozens of ''fabriques'', or constructions, including an Egyptian pyramid, antique sculptures, a Gothic ruin, a Tatar tent, a Dutch windmill, a [[minaret]], a Roman temple, and an enchanted grotto,. Visitors to the garden were instructed to follow a certain path, from site to site. The experience was enhanced by park employees in exotic costumes, and camels and other rare animals.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrassé, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1781, most of the ''fabriques'' were removed, and Parc Monceau was remade into a more traditional English landscape garden. During the reign of [[Napoleon III]], the park became the property of the city of Paris, and was made into a public park. Sections of the park were sold for the construction of large new townhouses to help finance the construction of the park. The park was surrounded by a monumental ornamental iron gate and fence and planted with a wide variety of exotic trees, shrubs and flowers. During the [[French Third Republic]], the park was filled with statues of composers and writers. An arcade of the old [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]], burned by the [[Paris Commune]] in 1871, was installed in the garden to provide a picturesque ruin. A few traces of the original folly, including the Egyptian pyramid, can still be seen.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrassé, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', pp. 78–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Parc de Bagatelle]] (1778–1787)===
[[File:Bagatelle Blaikie.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the garden by Thomas Blaikie]]
[[File:Paris Bagatelle 01.jpg|thumb|right|Gardens and chateau of the [[Parc de Bagatelle]] (1778–87)]]
[[File:Paris Bagatelle Roseraie.jpg|thumb|right|The rose garden of Bagatelle]]
The [[Parc de Bagatelle]] was created by the Count of Artois, the future King [[Charles X of France]], on a section of the [[Bois de Boulogne]] that he had purchased in 1777. He made a wager with his sister-in-law, [[Marie Antoinette]], that he could build a château where she could be entertained in less than three months. Construction of the little château began on 21 September and was finished on 26 November. The chateau was the work of the architect [[François-Joseph Bélanger]], while the garden was made by the Scottish landscape designer [[Thomas Blaikie (gardener)|Thomas Blaikie]]. The garden was built at the same time as the Parc Monceau, and, like that garden, it was filled with ''fabriques'' and follies, including a hill made of rocks crowned by a "Pavilion of Philosophers" that was half-Gothic and half-Chinese; an obelisk, a bridge surmounted by a pagoda, Gothic ruins, a tatar tent and a spiral labyrinth. All the follies gradually disappeared, and the park became a more traditional English garden. The pavilion on top of the pile of rocks was replaced by a more traditional structure. During the Second Empire, the Pavilion of Eugénie in the rose garden was added, in honor of the frequent visits to the garden of the Empress of Napoleon III.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrassé, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the French Revolution, the garden was nationalized and made into a restaurant and a place for balls and festivals. After the restoration of the monarchy, it was returned to Count of Artois, whose family sold it in 1835 to [[Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford]], an English aristocrat who had settled in Paris. He and his heir, [[Sir Richard Wallace, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Wallace]] purchased additional land and enlarged the garden from 16 to 24 hectares and reconstructed it, adding new terraces, lawns, the picturesque pond with lily-pads, and many trees, including a giant [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|sequoia]], planted in 1845, that now is more than 45 meters high.

In 1905 the heirs of Richard Wallace ceded the park to the City of Paris, which made extensive additions, including an enlarged rose garden, which became the site of the [[Concours international de roses nouvelles de Bagatelle]], the international competition of new roses, in 1907.

===Garden of the Rodin Museum (1755)===
[[File:Gardens of Musée Rodin 2007.jpg|thumb|left|The gardens of the [[Musée Rodin]], a modern reinterpretation of an 18th-century formal residential garden]]
[[File:RODIN Museum - garden, Paris (1).jpg|thumb|right|Gardens of the [[Musée Rodin]] (1755).]]
The [[Musée Rodin]] was originally constructed between 1728 and 1731 as a townhouse for Abraham Peyrenc, a wealthy Paris wig-maker. The second owner, the Duchess of Maine, created a long green for lawn-bowling, two covered alleys, and a grove of trees to the left of the entrance. The house and garden were purchased 1755 by [[Louis Antoine de Gontaut]], the Duke of Biron and a ''Marechal'' of the royal army. He enlarged the garden to the south. Following the design of architect Pierre-François Aubert and gardener Dominique Moisy, the garden became a model of a classic French formal garden; The lawn was divided by a long north-south perspective and made into four sections of flowerbeds around an eighteen-meter basin. The east side of the garden was filled with trees, and they added an orangerie, a Dutch tulip garden, and a vegetable garden at the end. The Duke frequently held elaborate festivities and garden parties there, and often opened the garden to the public.

The Duke died in 1788, on the eve of the Revolution. After the Revolution the house and garden became the property of the Papal legate, then of the Russian Ambassador, and then, in 1820, of a religious order, the Dames du Sacré-Coeur-du-Jésus, and served as a boarding school until 1904. During that time the basin was filled in, garden largely let to grow wild, an orchard of fruit trees was added. The Dames also built a neo-gothic chapel in 1875, which, after the order was dissolved in 1904, became a residence where writers and artists could rent space. The sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]] became one of the tenants in 1908. The house and garden were purchased by the French State in 1911. Part of the garden was taken to build the neighboring Lycée Victor Duruy, but Rodin remained as tenant and placed works of his sculpture along the main path. After his death in 1917, it became a museum devoted to his work, which opened in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrassé, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', pp. 87–91&lt;/ref&gt;

The basin was restored in 1927, but otherwise the garden remained much as it had been under the religious order. Beginning in 1993, the garden was redesigned by landscape designer Jacques Sgard both as an open-air gallery to display the works of Rodin, but also to recapture the appearance of an 18th-century formal French residential garden.&lt;ref&gt;Racine, Michel, ''Guide des jardins en France'', p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parks and gardens of Napoleon III (1852–1870)==

[[File:Henri Evenepoel - Promenade du dimanche au Bois de Boulogne.JPG|thumb|right|Sunday promenade in the [[Bois de Boulogne]], by [[Henri Evenepoel]] (1890s)]]
[[Napoleon III]] became the first elected President of France by an overwhelming vote in 1848. When he could not run for re-election, he organized a coup d'état in December 1851 and had himself declared Emperor of the French in December 1852. One of his first priorities as Emperor was to build new parks and gardens for Paris, particularly in the neighborhoods far from the center, where the few public parks of the city were all located.

Napoleon III named [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]] his new prefect of the Seine in 1853, and commissioned him to build his new parks. Haussmann assembled a remarkable team: [[Jean-Charles Alphand]], the city's first Director of the new Service of Promenades and Plantations; [[Jean-Pierre Barillet-Deschamps]], the city's first gardener-in-chief; [[Eugène Belgrand]], a hydraulic engineer who rebuilt the city's sewers and water supply, and provided the water needed for the parks; and [[Gabriel Davioud]], the city's chief architect, who designed chalets, temples, grottos, follies, fences, gates, lodges, lampposts and other park architecture.&lt;ref name="Moncan, Patrice p. 21-29"&gt;De Moncan, Patrice, ''Les Jardins du Baron Haussmann'', pp. 21–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of seventeen years, Napoleon III, Haussmann and Alphand created 1,835 hectares of new parks and gardens, and planted more than six hundred thousand trees, the greatest expansion of Paris green space before or since.&lt;ref name="Moncan, Patrice p. 21-29"/&gt; They built four major parks in the north, south, east and west of the city, replanted and renovated the historic parks, and added dozens of small squares and gardens, so that no one lived more than ten minutes from a park or square. In addition, they planted tens of thousands of trees along the new boulevards that Haussmann created, reaching out from the center to the outer neighborhoods. The parks of Paris, particularly the Tuileries gardens and the new Bois de Boulogne, provided entertainment and relaxation for all classes of Parisians during the Second Empire.

===The [[Bois de Boulogne]] (1852–1858)===
[[File:Grande cascade Boulogne (1).jpg|thumb|left|The artificial grand cascade and grotto of the [[Bois de Boulogne]]]]
[[File:Kiosque de l'Empereur Bois de Boulogne Paris 16e 001.jpg|thumb|right|The kiosk of the Emperor, on the island in the lower lake in the Bois de Boulogne, is the only monument in Paris named for [[Napoleon III]].]]
The Bois de Boulogne was a scrubby forest to the west of the city, where the German, Russian and British occupation armies had camped after Napoleon's defeat and had cut down most of the older trees.

In 1852 Napoleon III had land transferred from the list of Imperial property to the city of Paris, and bought the plots of private land within the park. He had lived long years in exile in London, and had frequently visited London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], with its serpentine lake and winding paths. It became the model for his first major new park. Thousands of workers began digging artificial lakes and brought boulders from the Forest of Fontainebleau to build an artificial cascade. Belgrand, the hydraulic engineer, built a special conduit from the Ourq canal, dug artesian wells, and laid 66 kilometers of pipes to provide water for the future lakes, lawns and flowerbeds. Alphand laid out 95 kilometers of new roads, riding trails and paths winding through the park. The gardeners seeded 273 hectares of lawn and planted 420,000 trees.&lt;ref&gt;De Moncan, Patrice, ''Les Jardins d'Haussmann'', pp. 57–60&lt;/ref&gt;

The park was also intended to provide recreation for the Parisians; besides the roads for carriages and paths for horses and walking, Davioud built twenty-four chalets and pavilions around the park, which served as restaurants, cafes, theaters, and places of entertainment. Twenty hectares were set aside for a garden and zoo, the ''Jardin d'Acclimatation''. In 1857 one corner of the park became the site of the [[Hippodrome de Longchamp]], the city's most important horse racing track. During the winter, the lake became a popular destination for ice-skating. From its opening, the park was full of Parisians of all classes.&lt;ref&gt;De Moncan, Patrice, ''Les Jardins d'Haussmann'', pp. 60–65&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Bois de Vincennes (1860–1865)===
[[File:Bois de Vincennes 20060816 16.jpg|thumb|right|The Temple of Love on Lac Daumesnil in the [[Bois de Vincennes]] (1865)]]
[[File:Expo 1931 Reuilly.jpg|thumb|left|Fountains in the Bois de Vincennes during the 1931 Colonial Exposition]]
The [[Bois de Vincennes]] was originally a royal hunting preserve and the site of an important royal residence, the [[Château de Vincennes]], still existing. After Louis XIV moved the royal residence to Versailles, the chateau was neglected. Under [[Louis XV]], the chateau was redesigned, and walking paths were created in the forest. During the French Revolution, the center of the park was turned into a military training ground, with firing ranges for artillery and muskets. During the Restoration, [[Louis-Philippe]] took 170 acres of the forest and built barracks and military offices.

In 1860 Napoleon III ceded a large part of the forest to the city of Paris and Alphand began to turn it into a place for relaxation and recreation for the working-class population of eastern Paris. Much of the land in the center of the park was retained by the military, so Haussmann was obliged to buy additional private land around the perimeter of the park, making the Bois de Vincennes much more expensive to build; the Bois de Vincennes cost 12 million francs, while the Bois de Boulogne cost 3.46 million francs. Covering 995 hectares, it was slightly larger than the [[Bois de Boulogne]], making it the largest park in the city. As he had done in the Bois de Boulogne, Alphand designed and dug twenty-five hectares of lakes, rivers, waterfalls and grottos. The city's chief gardener, Barillet-Deschamps, planted three hundred hectares of lawns and one hundred forty-eight hectares of flower beds. The hydraulic engineer Belgrand built a water channel from the [[Marne River]], and pumps to hoist the water up thirty-five meters to a lake in the park, which served to water the park and to fill the lakes, streams and cascades. Davioud decorated the new park with fantasy temples, cafes kiosks and chalets. The park was completed with the addition of a racetrack, the [[Hippodrome de Vincennes]], in 1863, a public firing range for pistols, rifles, and archery; and the Imperial farm, with orchards, fields, sheep and cows, so the urban residents of Paris could see a real farm at work&lt;ref&gt;De Moncan, Patrice, ''Les Jardins d'Haussmann'', pp. 75–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bois de Vincennes was the site of the cycling events of the [[1900 Olympics]], in a forty-thousand seat stadium built especially for that event. The Park was also the site of two large Colonial Expositions, in 1907 and 1931, celebrating the peoples and products France's empire. Several vestiges of the exhibits remain, including the old pavilion of French [[Cameroon]], which was converted into a Buddhist temple and Institute in 1977. The Paris zoo was built for the 1931 exposition, and moved in 1934 to its present location in the east of the park, next to a sixty-five meter high man-made mountain, inhabited by alpine goats.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrassé, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', pp. 119–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parc des Buttes Chaumont (1864–1867)===

[[File:Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, 22 April 2007.jpg|thumb|right|The lawns of the Parc des Buttes Chaumont on a sunny day]] 
The [[Parc des Buttes Chaumont]], twenty-seven hectares in size in the north of the city, was an unpromising site for a garden; The soil was very poor, and the land bare of vegetation; its original name was "Chauvre-mont" or "bald hill." In medieval times, it was close the site of the gibbet, where the corpses of excited criminals were displayed. From 1789 it served as a sewage dump, and much of the site had been used as a stone quarry

Alphand began to build in 1864. Two years and one thousand workers were required simply to terrace the site and to bring in two hundred thousand square meters of topsoil. A small railroad line was built to carry the earth. Gunpowder was used to blast the rock, and to sculpt the 50-meter-high central promontory. A two hectare lake was dug at the foot of the promontory. Alphand laid out five kilometers of paths and roads, and Belgrand installed pumps and pipes to hoist water from the Ourq canal to supply the cascades and lake and water the new gardens. Davioud designed a grotto, using the tunnels of the old stone quarry; a circular temple, based on the [[Temple of Vesta, Tivoli]], to crown the promontory, as well as four bridges to span the lake. The park opened in April 1, 1867, the opening day of the Paris Universal Exposition.&lt;ref&gt;De Moncan, Patrice, ''Les Jardins d'Haussmann'', pp. 101–107&lt;/ref&gt;

An urban legend says that bodies of Communards killing during the suppression of the 1871 [[Paris Commune]] are entombed inside the old stone quarries in the Promentory. In fact 754 bodies were placed there briefly for a short time after the fighting ended, but were buried in the city cemeteries soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;du Camp, Maxime, ''Les Convulsions de Paris'', Hachette, (1881), p. 303.

===Parc Montsouris (1865–1878)===
[[File:Palais du bardo Paris.jpg|thumb|left|The Palais de Bardo was a landmark of Parc Montsouris until burned down in 1991]]
[[File:Parc Montsouris lake - Paris.JPG|thumb|right|The lake of [[Parc Montsouris]]]]
[[Parc Montsouris]] was the last of the four large parks created by [[Napoleon III]] at the four cardinal points of the compass around Paris. It was precisely south of the exact center of Paris- a monument in the park placed by Napoleon I indicated the [[prime meridian]] which French maps used until 1911, instead of Greenwich, as the zero degree of longitude. Napoleon III decreed to construction of the park in 1865, but purchasing the land took time, and work did not begin until 1867. Work was also delayed because several hundred corpses that had been placed in the [[catacombs of Paris]], part of which lay under the park, had to be moved. The park was inaugurated in 1869, but was not actually finished until 1878, under Alphand, who continued his work as the Director of Public Works of Paris under the [[French Third Republic]].

Parc Montsouris, 15.5 hectares in area, had all the elements of a classical Second Empire garden in a smaller space; a lake, a cascade, winding paths, a cafe, a [[guignol]] theater, lawns and flower beds. It also had a remarkable folly: the Palais de Bardo, a reduced-scale replica of the summer residence of the beys of [[Tunis]], which had originally been part of the [[International Exposition (1867)|Paris Universal Exposition of 1867]]. Made of wood and stucco, it was installed in the center of the park, where it served as a weather station, but gradually suffered from vandalism and neglect. It burned down in 1991, and was not replaced.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrassé, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', pp. 129–132&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gardens of the Belle Epoque and the Universal Expositions (1871–1914)==
[[File:Paris Bois Boulogne Serres Auteuil.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Serres d'Auteuil]] (1898), next to the Bois de Boulogne, provide trees, shrubs and flowers for all the parks of Paris]]
Napoleon III was captured by the Germans during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870 and the Second Empire was replaced by the [[French Third Republic]]. The new government named Jean-Charles Alphand the Director of Public Works of Paris, and he continued the work he had begun under the Emperor and Haussmann. He finished Parc Montsouris and several smaller squares, including square Boucicault (now Square Maurice-Gardette) and square d'Anvers (1877). Much of Alphand's abundant energy was devoted to the building of the universal expositions of 1878 and 1889, each of which included extensive gardens. He was in charge of building the Paris Exposition of 1889, including the construction of the [[Eiffel Tower]]. It was his last great project before his death in 1891.&lt;ref name="Moncan, Patrice pp. 142–143"&gt;De Moncan, Patrice, ''Les Jardins d'Haussmann'', pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of new squares and gardens was carried during the Third Republic by one of Alphand's protégés, the architect Jean Camille Formigé. While he did not undertake any new large parks on the scale of those of Alphand, he built a series of new squares in the Paris neighborhoods; square Ferdinand Brunot; square Frédéric Lemaître; square Adolphe Chérioux; square du Vert-Galant; square des Epinettes, and the square des Arènes de Lutèce. His most impressive accomplishment was the [[Serres d'Auteuil]] (1898), an ensemble of greenhouses which provided flowers, trees and shrubs for all of the parks of Paris.&lt;ref name="Moncan, Patrice pp. 142–143"/&gt;

===Jardins du Trocadéro (1878–1937)===
[[File:SOLparkParis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|At the Exposition of 1878, the gardens of the Trocadero displayed the full-size head of the [[Statue of Liberty]], before the statue was completed and shipped to New York.]]
[[File:Paris Exposition Trocadero Palace and Park, Paris, France, 1900.jpg|thumb|right|The Trocadero Palace and gardens at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900.]]
The Trocadero had originally been the site of a country house of [[Catherine de' Medici]], then of a monastery, destroyed during the [[French Revolution]]. [[Napoleon]] had projected to build a palace for his son there; King Louis XVIII planned to build a monument there to the [[Battle of Trocadero]] in 1823. Under Napoleon III, Alphand had built a basin, paths radiating outwards, a large lawn, and a stairway descending from the hill down the edge of the river.&lt;ref name="Jarrassè, Dominique pp. 164–165"&gt;Jarrassè, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', pp. 164–165.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the site was chosen in 1876 for the part of the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris Universal Exposition of 1878]], the architects [[Gabriel Davioud]] and Jules Bordais were chosen to construct the Palais de Trocadero, a massive temporary structure in a vaguely Moorish style, with large rotunda flanked by two towers, with curving wings on either side. The gardens, designed by Alphand, occupied the slope from the Palace on the top of the hill down to the Seine. The center of the garden was occupied by a long series of cascades ending in a large basin at the bottom at the bottom of the hill. The cascade was lined with statues of animals and of female figures representing the five continents (the statues now decorate the square next to the Musée D'Orsay). The largest piece of statuary in the garden was the head of the [[Statue of Liberty]], made before the rest of the statue, and displayed in order to raise funds for its completion.

When the Exposition was finished, the gardens were redesigned into an [[English landscape garden]]; groves of trees were planted, winding paths laid out, and a stream and grotto were constructed. The gardens remained in place for the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Paris Universal Exposition of 1889]]. For the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris International Exposition of 1937]] the palace was replaced by a modernist structure and the fountains were rebuilt, but the picturesque gardens on the hillsidewere left as they were. (See parks and gardens of the 1930s below).&lt;ref name="Jarrassè, Dominique pp. 164–165"/&gt;

===Champ-de-Mars (1908–1927)===
[[File:Vue officielle a vol d'oiseau de l'exposition universelle de 1867.jpg|thumb|left|The gardens surrounding the huge exposition hall of the 1867 Paris Universal Exposition, held on the Champ-de-Mars.]]
[[File:Champ de Mars from the Eiffel Tower - July 2006 edit.jpg|thumb|right|The Champ-de-Mars gardens (1908–1927) seen from the Eiffel Tower]]
The [[Champ de Mars]], 24.5 hectares in area, was created in 1765 as a parade ground and training field for the neighboring [[École Militaire]]. During the [[French Revolution]] it was the site of large patriotic festivals, including the [[Festival of the Supreme Being]] conducted by [[Robespierre]] in 1794. It was surrounded by a moat and not open to the public until 1860, when Napoleon III filled in the moat and planted trees along the borders, but it still remained the property of the Army. It was the site of the [[International Exposition (1867)|1867 Paris Universal Exposition]], which featured a large domed pavilion in the center, surrounded a garden, which itself surrounded by a large oval-shaped gallery. The rest of the Champ de Mars was occupied by exposition halls and extensive landscape gardens, designed by Alphand.

The Champ-de-Mars served again as the main site of the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris Universal Exposition of 1878]]. A gigantic palace of glass and iron 725 meters long occupied he center of the park, surrounded by gardens designed by Alphand. For the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Paris Universal Exposition of 1889]], celebrating the centenary of the French Revolution, Alphand placed the [[Eiffel Tower]] in the center, near the monumental Gallery of Machines. The Exposition included a Palace of Fine Arts and a Palace of Liberal Arts. The space around the Eiffel tower and between the galleries and palaces was filled by a large landscape garden, which extended along the axis between the Eiffel Tower and the Seine, and ended at the river at a colossal fountain with a group of allegorical figures, called ''The City of Paris Illuminates the World with her Torch''. The fountain was lit at night by electric lights shining up from the water through plates of colored glass.

In 1889, the Champ-de-Mars was formally transferred from the French army to the City of Paris. It was used once more for the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris Universal Exposition of 1900]], and, then, beginning in 1909 until 1927, it was developed into a public park. It was an unusual site; it was the only large park in Paris not enclosed with a fence, and it was crossed by three major boulevards. The huge Gallery of Machines, which occupied much of the site, was demolished in 1909. The park architect was Jean Camille Formigé (1849–1926), a protégé of Alphand. He used the long central axis from the Eiffel Tower to [[École Militaire]] to create a formal and symmetrical park in the French style. The long central axis was lined with paths and rows of trees; a basin with fountains was placed in the center; playgrounds were built along the sides. The original gardens from the 1889 exhibition, around the Eiffel Tower, were preserved in their original form and can still be seen. Like other French formal gardens, it was best seen from above, in this case from the top of the Eiffel Tower.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrassé, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', pp. 166–168&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parks and gardens of the early 20th century==
[[File:Portique monumental Jules-Félix Coutan 001.JPG|thumb|right|The monumental gateway of the pavilion of the Sèvres porcelain factory at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900 is found in Square Laurent-Prache, on the south side of the church of Saint-Germain-des-Pres.]]

Several small parks were created between 1901 and the beginning of World War II. '''Square Laurent-Prache''' was created in 1901 on the north side of the Church of Saint-Germain-des-Pres, on the site of the old Abbey of Saint-Germain, which was destroyed during the French Revolution in 1790. The wall of the church next to the park is decorated with gothic arcades taken from the destroyed Chapel of the Virgin. The centerpiece of the park today is a bronze head made by [[Pablo Picasso]] in 1959, in homage to the poet [[Apollinaire]].
[[File:Paris - Square René Viviani - robinier - 1601.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The oldest tree in Paris, an acacia planted in 1601, found in [[Square René-Viviani]]]]
'''Square Félix-Desruelles''' was built in the same year along the south wall of the church. The little square is dominated by a colorful enameled gateway of the Pavilion of the Sèvres porcelain factory from the Paris Universal Exposition of 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrassé, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', pp. 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Square René-Viviani]]''', created in 1928, is located next to the church of [[Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre]], across the Seine from the Cathedral of Notre-Dame-de-Paris. Its most famous feature is the oldest living tree in Paris, a ''robinier'', a variety of [[acacia]], which was planted there in 1601 by the botanist Jean Robin. The park also contains a medieval well and fragments of gothic architecture from Notre-Dame Cathedral, taken out during its 19th-century restoration.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrassé, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gardens of Sacré-Cœur (1924–1929)===
[[File:Sacre Coeur 1.JPG|thumb|right|The gardens below the [[Basilica of Sacré-Cœur]]]] 
The building of [[Basilica of Sacré-Cœur]] at the top of Montmartre was first proposed after the 1870 defeat of France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], It was also the place where the [[Paris Commune]] began in March 1871 with the killing of two French generals by mutinous soldiers of the Paris National Guard. Jean-Charles Alphand's plan called for a park that would descend eighty meters from the parvis in front of the church to the street at the bottom of the hill. The architect [[Jean-Camille Formigé]] designed a park with a dramatic and unobstructed approach to the church from the bottom of the hill; he designed two terraces, connected by stairways and by curving horseshoe-shaped ramps, lined by trees. Formigés plan also called for a cascade and fountains parallel to the stairways, but these were never built. The work on the church began in the 1880s, but proceeded very slowly, because of the difficulty of anchoring the church to the hillside, site of a former quarry. The Basilica was not dedicated until 1919. Formigé died in 1926, and the work on the gardens was finished by Léopold Béviére, and dedicated in 1929. The original name of the park was Square Willette, but in 2004, under the socialist government of Mayor Bernard Delenoye, it was renamed Square [[Louise Michel]], after the anarchist and revolutionary who had played an active role in the Paris Commune.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrassé, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parks and gardens of the 1930s==
[[File:Buffet deau.jpg|right|thumb|The buffet-d'eau of the [[Parc de la Butte-du-Chapeau-Rouge]] (1938)]]
The 1930s saw an important change in the style of Paris gardens. From 1852 until the end of the 1920s, almost all Paris gardens had been designed by [[Jean-Charles Alphand]] (1817–1891) and his protégé, Jean Camille Formigé, and they all had a similar picturesque style. Beginning in the 1930s, each Paris garden had a different designer, and the styles were varied. They tended to be more regular and more geometric, more like the classical [[French formal garden]], and made greater use of sculpture, particularly the work of the modernist sculptors of the period. The gardens also tended to be smaller, and were placed in the outer neighborhoods, near the edge of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrassé, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', pp. 182–187&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the new parks were built on land which had been the old fortified zone around the city, a wide strip where no building was allowed, created between 1840 and 1845 by [[Adolphe Thiers]]. The land was finally turned over to the city in 1919, and supporters of green space urged that it be turned into a belt of parkland around the city, but instead the government of the Third Republic chose to use much of the land for public housing and industrial sites. Instead of a circular belt of green space, they built a series of small squares, including '''square du Serment du Koufra''' (1930) in the 14th arrondissement; '''square du Docteur-Calmette''' (1932) in the 15th arrondissement; and '''square Marcel-Sembat''' (1931) in the 18th arrondissement.

The most important landscape architects of the period were [[Léon Azéma]], a classically trained artist who won the prestigious Prix de Rome, who designed a dozen squares, including the [[Parc de la Butte-du-Chapeau-Rouge]]; and Roger Lardat, who designed series of squares and also redesigned parts of the [[Bois de Vincennes]] and the gardens of the Trocadero.

Other notable Paris parks, gardens and squares of the 1930s are those of the [[Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris]] (1921–1939); '''Parc Kellerman''' (1939–1950); '''Square Saint-Lambert''' (1933); '''Square Séverine''' (1933–1934); '''Square Sarah Berhardt''' and '''Square Réjane''' (1936); '''Parc Choisy''' (1937); '''Square René-Le-Gall''' (1938); and '''Square Barye''' (1938).

===New Jardins du Trocadéro (1937)===
[[File:Paris 75016 Fontaines du Trocadéro 20090815.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Palais de Chaillot]], and gardens and fountains built for the 1937 Exposition.]]
The major Paris architectural and landscape project of the 1930s was the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]] in 1937, on the hill of Chaillot. The old Palace of Trocadero, which had been used in two previous exhibits, was demolished and replaced by a large terrace with a panoramic view of the Seine and Eiffel Tower, and by the modernist white [[Palais de Chaillot]], with two wings which enveloped the top of the hill. The picturesque landscape gardens on the slopes of the hills, built by Jean-Charles Alphand for the 1878 exposition were preserved, The 21 hectares of new gardens were designed by [[Léon Azéma]] and the architects Carlu and Boileau. The central element of the garden became a series of cascades, lined with statues, and a long basin containing rows of fountains and two powerful water cannon. The basins, fountains and dramatic lighting at night were designed by [[Roger-Henri Expert]], who also designed the interior decoration on the famous French ocean liner ''Normandie''. Many of the statues from the exposition, by the leading French sculptors of the time, were kept in place after the Exposition, or found new homes in the other new city parks of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrassé, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', pp. 201–202&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parc de la Butte-du-Chapeau-Rouge (1939)===
[[File:Paris parc chapeau rouge7.jpg|thumb|right|The Square de la Butte-du-Chapeau-Rouge, (1939), in the 19th arrondissement]] 
The [[Parc de la Butte-du-Chapeau-Rouge]], originally known as the Square de la Butte-du-Chapeau-Rouge, in the 19th arrondissement, is one of a series of squares built in the old fortified zone which surrounded the city since the reign of Louis-Philippe. It was designed by [[Léon Azéma]], and was similar to his plan for the gardens of the Trocadero two years earlier. The broad lawns and winding paths took advantage of the steep slope and served as a showcase for sculpture.

The main architectural features are the ''buffet d'eau'', or cascading fountain, at the lower entrance, crowned by a statue of Eve by sculptor Raymond Couvènges (1938) and a classical portico with sculpture serving as the entrance to a playground. At the high end of the park, Two belvederes, reached by winding paths, offer panoramic views of the city.

===Parc Kellermann (1939–1950)===
[[File:Paris 13e - parc Kellermann 4.jpg|thumb|right|Parc Kellermann (1939–1950), in the 13th arrondissement]]
Parc Kellermann was built at the same time as the Square de la Butte-du-Chapeau-Rouge, at the southern end of the city, at the edge of the 13th arrondissement. It was slightly larger than Chapeau-Rouge, (5.55 hectares compared with 4.68) which entitled it to be called a park rather than a square. It originally served as a site for several of the several smaller pavilions of the 1937 Exposition. The park was designed by the architect [[Jacques Gréber]], who was architect-in-chief of the 1937 exposition, and who also had a notable career in the United States, where he designed the [[Benjamin Franklin Parkway]] in [[Philadelphia]].

The site of the park had two different levels; much of the park was built in the old bed and banks of the [[Bièvre (river)|Biévre]] river, now covered over. Gréber merged two different styles; the lower part of the park is picturesque, with a lake, stream, false rocks, groves of trees, winding paths and the other characteristic features of a park of the time of [[Napoléon III]]. The upper part, bordered by boulevard Kellermann, is a 1930s combination of classicism and modernism, with a cement portico, two brick ''excedres'' decorated with bas-relief sculptures in the 1930s style; a large parterre and basin; and long tree-lined alleys. The upper part of the park today offers exceptional views of the city, but also suffers from the noise of the neighboring highway that circles Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrassé, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', pp. 193–195&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parks and gardens of the late 20th century (1940–1980) ==
Following the German occupation of Paris in 1940, the priority shifted from making parks to making playing fields and other sports facilities, following the ideology of Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]] and [[Vichy France]] regime. In 1939, Paris had twenty hectares of sports fields; In 1941 the Paris government published a plan to build an additional two hundred hectares of sports facilities and playing fields, mostly using the vacant land in the old fortified zone on the edge of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrasse, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emphasis given to playgrounds and sports fields continued in the years after the War. The priorities of the successive French governments were the repair of the infrastructure destroyed by the War and building public housing. A number of squares were created, though most of the space was usually devoted to playgrounds rather than gardens. The new parks and squares included Squares Docteurs-Dejerine (1958), Emmanuel-Fleury (1973) and Leon Frapie (1973) in the 20th arrondissement; Squares Emile-Cohl and Georges-Melies (1959) in the 12th arrondissement; the squares around the porte de Champerret in the 17th arrondissement; and the square de la Porte-de-Plaine (1948-1952) in the 15th arrondissement.

'''Square Andre-Ullmann''' (1947), in the 17th arrondissement, is one of the typical postwar gardens; symmetrical and austere, it occupies a triangular space, with a pavilion with a rotunda in one corner, two alleys of plane trees, a central green, and bushes and shrubs carved into geometric shapes.
[[File:Paris square emmanuel fleury2.jpg|thumb|right|Square Emmanuel-Fleury, a picturesque landscape garden in the 20th arrondissement]]
'''Square Emmanuel Fleury''' (1973) in the 20th arrondissement, with an area of 2.34 hectares, is larger than most of the postwar gardens, and, while it has sports fields, including a course for roller sports, it is more in the picturesque Napeoleon III style than the other postwar gardens, with rich flower beds, winding paths, groves of trees and kiosks.

'''Square Sainte-Odile''' (1976), in the 17th arrondissement, by landscape architect Jean Camand, was one of the first of a new model of gardens which appeared in the 1980s and 1990s; occupying a small space (1.13 hectare), it was divided into different spaces, each with a different style and theme, often radically different; next to a church, it includes a landscape garden in one section; a playground in another, a picturesque butte with a pavilion; a central basin with an abstract sculpture; and a monument to the harpist Lily Laskine.

===Parc floral de Paris (1969)===
[[File:Devant un pavillon japonais du Parc Floral.jpg|thumb|right|The garden of the Japanese pavilion in the Parc Floral de Paris]]
The largest new garden created in Paris in the second part of the 20th century was the Parc floral de Paris, covering 31 hectares, which was built within the [[Bois de Vincennes]] in 1969. In 1959 and 1964 that park had been the site of a large international flower show, the Floralies internationales, and the two events had been so popular that the city decided to make a permanent site for flower exhibitions. Land was ceded to the city from military installations within the park, and the new gardens were created under the direction of landscape architect Daniel Collin. The new park was an ensemble of different flower gardens with different themes; a valley of flowers; a garden of contemporary sculptures; a water garden; and a children's garden, as well as pavilions for indoor displays and exhibits of exotic flowers, Japanese [[bonsai]] and other botanical attractions. A Garden of the Four Seasons was added in 1979, with flowers in bloom from early spring until the end of autumn. The park also featured an outdoor theater for musical events, and small lakes and fountains.

===Jardin Tino-Rossi (1975–1980)===
[[File:Paris 5e Jardin Tino Rossi 001.JPG|thumb|right|The Jardin Tino-Rossi combines a promenade along the Seine and an open-air museum of late 20th century sculpture]]
In the 19th century, the site of the Jardin Tino-Rossi, on the quai Saint-Bernard in the 5th arrondissement, had been the place where wine barrels were unloaded from barges for sale at the nearby Halle aux vins. In 1975, government of President [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] decided to make the quai into a promenade, featuring rows of plantane trees planted along the quai in the 19th century, and a series of small garden amphitheaters by the edge of the water. In 1980, a more ambitious element was added; an outdoor sculpture garden featuring over fifty works by late 20th-century sculptors, including [[Alexander Calder]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], and [[Jean Arp]]. While the promenade is generally considered a success, the works of sculpture have suffered over time from degradation and vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrasse, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parks of the Mitterrand era (1981–1995)==
During the fourteen-year presidency of [[François Mitterrand]], coinciding with the bicentennial of the French Revolution, Paris saw an explosion of major public works projects, including the [[Opéra Bastille]], the Louvre pyramid and underground courtyard, and the new national library. The Mitterrand projects included opening one hundred and fifty new parks, squares and gardens, a larger number than those constructed under Napoleon III, though the total area of the new parks was much smaller. Unlike the Second Empire, when all the new gardens followed the same basic plan and picturesque style, the Mitterrand-era gardens were built by different architects and landscape architects, and offered a wide variety of styles and designs, from miniature recreations of natural wilderness to high-tech. Many of the new parks and gardens, such as La Villette, were built on former industrial sites, and a majority were built in the outer neighborhoods of the city, where the population was most dense. Most all of the new parks featured works of contemporary art and sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrasse, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', pp. 220–221.&lt;/ref&gt;

The landscape architect [[Bernard Tschumi]], who designed the gardens of the Parc de la Villette, tried to explain the philosophy of the new parks in a book entitled ''The Parks of the 21st Century'' (1987) : "The conditions of the modern city have made invalid the historic prototype of a park as an image of nature. The park can no longer be conceived as a model of a utopian world in miniature, protected from vulgar reality. Rather than a place of escape, the contemporary park should be seen as an environment defined by the preoccupations of the inhabitants of the city, of their recreation needs and the pleasures defined by the working conditions and cultural aspirations of contemporary urban society."&lt;ref&gt;cited in Jarrasse, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parc Georges-Brassens (1984) ===
[[File:Paris parc georges brassens5.jpg|thumb|right|The centerpiece of Parc Georges-Brassens is the belfry of the old auction market of the abattoirs of Vaugirard.]]
[[Parc Georges-Brassens]] (15th arrondissement), occupying 7.4 hectares, is located on the site of the former Vaugirard slaughterhouse and horse market from 1894–1897, which were demolished between 1969 and 1979. The design, by architects Ghiulamila and Milliex and landscape architect Daniel Collin, preserved picturesque elements of the original market, including the belfry of the old auction market of the abattoirs of Vaugirard, and the covered horse market, which now serves on weekends as the site of an antiquarian book market. Modern sculptures of horses stand at the entrance to the garden. Corners of the park are occupied by a pre-school and day care center, and a theater. The landscape garden in the center of the park, in the picturesque tradition of Alphand and the Second Empire, has a lake, winding paths, flowerbeds, a rose garden and a garden of aromatic plants. The slope of the park also has a dry cascade of artificial stones, for children to climb.

===Parc de Belleville (1988)===
[[File:P1010851 Paris XX Parc de Belleville reductwk.JPG|thumb|right|The Parc de Belleville, in the 20th arrondissement, has a panoramic from the highest park in Paris, and encourages visitors to sit on the grass.]]
The [[Parc de Belleville]], in the 20th arrondissement, was another early Mitterrand-era park. It was designed by architect Francois Debulois and landscape architect Paul Brichet, and built on a steeply-sloping site that covered 4.5 hectares, on the hill of Belleville, the highest point in the city. The park was located not far from the [[Parc des Buttes Chaumont]], and shared some of the same picturesque elements as that Second-Empire park, including a terrace and belvedere at the top of the park with a panoramic view of the city, winding paths along the hillsides, abundant flowerbeds and groves of trees, and a series of cascades from the top of the hill down to a semi-circular basin, then under Rue Julian Lacroix to a circular basin in another garden in the jardin de Pali-Kao, a miniature park of three thousand square meters opened in 1989. Visitors to the park are invited to sit on the abundant lawns of the park, a practice long discouraged in Paris parks. Like Buttes-Chaumont, the Parc de Belleville originally had a grotto, built into the side of the old stone quarries, but it had to be closed because of vandalism and security concerns.

===Parc de la Villette (1987–1991)===
[[File:Parc de la Villette, Paris 2010.jpg|thumb|right|Parc de la Villette, like a high-tech amusement park, has ten different thematic gardens and playgrounds]]
The [[Parc de la Villette]] was formerly the main slaughterhouse of the city, located in the 19th arrondissement at the intersection of the Canal de l'Ourq and the Canal Saint-Denis. One structure remains from the old site, the Grande Halle, built in 1867 by Jules de Merindol, a student of Baltard, who had built the famous glass and iron structures of [[Les Halles]]. In 1982, and international competition selected landscape architect [[Bernard Tschumi]] to design the park. The final design was composed of ten thematic gardens, which Tschumi described as a "cinematic promenade" of different sights and styles.&lt;ref&gt;Jarresse, Dominique, ''Grammaire des jardins Parisiens'', pp. 242–246.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parc de la Villette is more in the category of a high-tech amusement park, like Disneyland or Tivoli Gardens, than a traditional park. Twenty hectares of the fifty-five hectare site are devoted to buildings and structures, including the Cite des Sciences et de l'industrie, the Cite de la Musique, the Zenith performance hall, a full-sized submarine, and the central landmark, the mirror-surfaced Geode, a [[geodesic dome]]. The ten thematic gardens include playgrounds and small peaceful sanctuaries; they include a garden of mirrors, a garden of shadows, a garden of islands, a garden of bamboos, a garden of dunes, and several thematic playgrounds, including one with a slide in the form of a dragon. The gardens also feature works of sculpture by noted artists and sculptors, including [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Daniel Buren]].

===Parc André Citroën (1992)===
[[File:Parc-André-Citroën-Vue-Ensemble-Esplanade.jpg|thumb|right|[[Parc André Citroën]] (1992), on the site of an old automobile factory, offers high-tech greenhouses, broad lawns and a variety of small thematic gardens.]]
[[Parc André Citroën]], located on the Seine in the 15th arrondissement, was the site of the Citroën automobile factory from 1915 until the 1970s. The plan for the new park was developed by landscape architects [[Gilles Clément]] and Alain Provost, along with architects Patrick Berger, Jean-François Jodry, and Jean-Pierre Viguier. Like most of the Mitterrand-era parks, it combined two very different styles of parks, a recreation park and a picturesque floral park; the centerpiece of the 24-hectare park is a large lawn, 273 by 85 meters, dedicated to recreation, sports and relaxation. The natural and pure garden aspect of the park is expressed by two very large greenhouses in the southeast overlooking the park, one an orangerie and the other displaying plants of the Mediterranean. There are also series of six small "serial gardens," each associated with a different metal, planet, state of water, and a sense; and the "Garden of movement", a meadow of different grasses blown by the wind. A canal frames one side of the large lawn, while the serial gardens, each in its own alcove, enclose the other side.&lt;ref&gt;Racine, Michel, ''Guide des jardins en France'', pp. 184–185.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promenade plantée (1993)===
[[File:PromenadePlantee.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Promenade plantée]], built on an abandoned railway viaduct ten meters above the city, stretches 4.7 kilometers from [[Place de la Bastille]] to the edge of the city.]]
The [[Promenade plantée]], in the 12th arrondissement, is the most original of Paris parks. The creation of landscape architect Jacques Vergely and architect Philippe Mathieux, it was built ten meters above the street on the abandoned viaduct of the Vincennes railway, which had been built under [[Napoleon III]] in 1859. The park extends 4.7 kilometers, from the site of the former Bastille station of the railroad line, close to [[Place de la Bastille]], to [[Verneuil-l'Étang]], at the peripheric highway at the outer edge of the city. The park offers a variety of different landscapes, from bamboo forest to picturesque flower garden, as well as fine views of the city. It is accessed by a number of stairways along its route, and is sometimes enclosed. Preference is given to people strolling, though joggers are allowed, if they do not impede the promenaders. Because of the narrow width of the promenade, bicycles are not permitted.

The Promenade plantée has inspired similar parks in other cities; the [[High Line]] in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City, opened in 2009, and the three-mile [[Bloomingdale Trail]] in Chicago.

===Jardin Atlantique (1994)===
[[File:Jardin Atlantique Room of Undulating Grasses.JPG|thumb|right|The "Room of undulating grasses" in the [[Jardin Atlantique]], on the roof of the Gare Montparnasse railway station.]]
The [[Jardin Atlantique]] in the 15th arrondissement, like the Promenade plantée, has a highly unusual site, perched on twelve concrete pillars seventeen meters above street level, atop the roof over the [[Gare Montparnasse]] railway station, which connects Paris with the west of France. It was designed by landscape architects Michael Pena and François Brun, and was reportedly the most expensive park built in Paris.&lt;ref name="Rancine, Michel p. 186"&gt;Rancine, Michel, ''Guide des jardins en France/ Nord '' p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; Like the other Mitterrand-era parks, it has a central lawn, surrounded by thematic gardens and sprinkled with modern sculpture and fountains. It also has thirty openings, which provide ventilation and light for the train tracks and platforms below, and the announcements of train arrivals and departures can be heard in the park above. The design of park has a vague resemblance to the deck of an ocean liner, in keeping with the connection of the train station to the Atlantic seaports of Cherbourg and Le Havre.

Because of the weight limitations and limited depth of soil, it has a high proportion of concrete and other structural materials compared to the amount of greenery. Nonetheless, the park has five hundred trees, planted in cubic stone boxes. The thematic gardens include a garden of varied moving in the wind; a garden of aquatic plants; a garden of coastal plants, a garden of blue and mauve colored flowers; and the "hall of silence", a meditation garden.&lt;ref name="Rancine, Michel p. 186"/&gt;

===Parc de Bercy (1994–1997)===
[[Image:Parc Bercy.JPG|thumb|right|the ''Jardin romantique'' of Parc de Bercy in the autumn]]
[[File:Jardin Bercy.JPG|thumb|right|Parterres in the Parc de Bercy]]
The site of the [[Parc de Bercy]], alongside the Seine in the 12th arrondissement, was at the edge of the city limits until the time of [[Napoleon III]]. It was the site of the wine depot where barrels wine and spirits were unloaded from barges and taxed before they were delivered to the city. Under the Mitterrand program, the new park was intended as the east-Paris equivalent of the [[Tuileries Garden]], alongside the Seine in the center of the city. The site already had a wide avenues lined by two hundred century-old chestnut and plantain trees, which, along with several old buildings from the wine depot, were integrated into the new park. Though the park was far from the center of the city, it was next to the new Palais Omnisports indoor sports facility and the Cinematheque (originally the American Center, designed by [[Frank Gehry]]) and linked by a new bridge to the new National Library across the Seine. On the river side, the park was bordered by a high terrace, which blocked the noise of the highway along the river and gave view over both the Seine and the park. The park also has an amphitheater, on the site where a neolithic village was discovered.

The landscaping of the new park was designed by architects Bernard Huet, Madeleine Ferrand, Jean-Pierre Feuges and landscape architects Ian la Caisne and Philippe Raguin. Their design created three separate gardens with different themes, connected by footbridges over the streets that divide them. The western park, near at the Palais Omnisports, called ''Les Prairies'', features broad lawns under trees; this part of the park is also used for informal sports, soccer skateboarding and rollerblading. The center park is called ''Les Parterres'', and is devoted to serious gardening. It includes an aromatic garden, a rose garden, and a vegetable garden where school groups come to learn about agriculture and gardening. The garden on the east is called ''Le Jardin romantique'', and it has a water theme; it includes a canal, fishponds, cascades, and a pool with water lilies.&lt;ref&gt;Racine, Michel, ''Guide des jardins en France'', p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paris parks and gardens of the 21st century==
Following the late 20th century tradition of French Presidents constructing new museums and parks to mark their period in office, President [[Jacques Chirac]] launched the [[Musée du quai Branly]], devoted to the arts of the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania.

In 1991, the banks of the Seine were declared a UNESCO cultural heritage site, and efforts began to make the highways and industrial space that remained along the river into a long promenade. Beginning in 2000, sections of the highways were closed on Sundays for promenades and jogging, and an artificial "beach" with sand and deck chairs was installed in summer. In 2008, during the administration of Mayor [[Bertrand Delanoë]] (2001-2014), the city of Paris began to transform portions of the highways built along the left and right banks of the Seine into parks and recreation areas. In 2013, a 2.3 kilometer section of the left-bank highway between the Pont d'Alma and the Musée d'Orsay opened as a permanent promenade, the [[Promenade des Berges de la Seine]].

===Gardens of the Musée du quai Branly (2006)===
[[File:Le musée du quai Branly, Paris 2011.jpg|thumb|right|The gardens of the [[Musée du quai Branly]] (2006) are designed to be the exact opposite of a French formal garden; a celebration of nature.]]
The site of the [[Musée du quai Branly]], on the left bank of the Seine, facing the Palais de Chaillot, and just a hundred meters from the EIffel Tower, had been occupied by the buildings of the Ministry of Reconstruction and Urbanism. An international competition led to selection of architect [[Jean Nouvel]] to design the new museum. The original proposal for the museum had called for a garden occupying 7,500 square meters of the 25,000 square meter site. Nouvel increased the gardens to 17,500 square meters, and made a series of different gardens an integral part of the museum. The largest section, the "garden of movement", between the [[Rue de l'Université (Paris)|rue de l'Université]] and the quai Branly, is a composition of small gardens created by landscape architect [[Gilles Clément]], designed to appear wild and to be the opposite of a French classical garden. The other notable feature of the garden is the ''Mur vegetale'' or "wall of vegetation", designed by [[Patrick Blanc]]; a composition of 15,000 plants of 150 different species which cover 800 square meters of the exterior facades of the museum and 150 square meters of the interior walls. The "wall" is renewed and trimmed each year.&lt;ref&gt;Moireau, Fabrice, ''Les jardins du musee du quai Branly'', pp. 2–9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promenade des Berges de la Seine (2013)===
[[File:Berges de la Seine 1.JPG|thumb|right|One of the floating gardens along the [[Promenade des Berges de la Seine]] in the 7th arrondissement]]
In the 19th century and early 20th century, the paved quay of the Left Bank of the Seine between the [[Pont de l'Alma]] and the [[Musée d'Orsay]] had been used for several international expositions, for boat docks and storage depots, and for cafes and floating swimming pool. Between 1961 and 1967, highways were built along both banks of the river to relieve traffic congestion in the center of the city. In 1991, the banks of the river were classified as UNESCO cultural heritage site, and efforts began to turn the highways into parks and promenades. Beginning in 2008, a 2.3 kilometer section of the highway was permanently closed and made into the [[Promenade des Berges de la Seine]], which was dedicated on June 19, 2013. The promenade includes five floating "islands", a total of 1800 square meters in size, placed atop barges, with trees, bushes, flowers and deck chairs. The former highway is lined with spaces for concerts and classes; outdoor exhibit space; playgrounds; a climbing wall; a discothèque under a bridge; and tipis and furnished containers which can be hired for lunches, celebrations or meetings. There are boat docks and several outdoor cafes along the promenade. All the facilities of the park are portable, and can be removed within 24 hours if the waters of the Seine rise too high. The promenade was designed by architect [[Franklin Azzi]], and the islands were created by Jean-Christophe Chobet.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Moniteur'', June 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[File:Kamina Tranmitter.jpg|thumb|Kamina transmitter]]
'''Kamina Funkstation''' was a [[shortwave radio]] transmitter in the German-occupied colony of [[Togoland]] (now [[Togo]]) in [[West Africa]].

The wireless station was built by ''[[Telefunken]]'' near the village of [[Kamina (Togo)|Kamina]], in [[Togoland]], where the nearest large settlement was [[Atakpamé]]. ''Telefunken'', on behalf of the German government from 1911 to 1914.  The station was designed as a node and switching point for other German colonial radio stations. Shortly after the beginning of [[World War I]] Togoland was invaded by British and French forces from the neighbouring colonies of [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (Ghana) and [[French Dahomey]] (Benin). The station was destroyed by the operators to prevent it from coming under British and French control.

This is a list of  plants in the [[genus]] ''[[Melaleuca]]''. In 2013, [[Lyndley Craven]] published a monograph of the genus with a description of 290 species, including about 40 sometimes known as callistemons.&lt;ref name="Craven" /&gt; A new species (''[[Melaleuca lophocoracorum]]'') was described in a 2013 paper.&lt;ref name="Ford"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Andrew J.|last2=Craven|first2=Lyndley A.|last3=Brophy|first3=Joe|title=A new species of Melaleuca (Myrtaceae) from north-east Queensland.|journal=Telopea|date=8 November 2013|volume=15|pages=185–189|doi=10.7751/telopea2013021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craven's inclusion of callistemons in ''Melaleuca'' is not accepted by the [[National Herbarium of New South Wales]] or by the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne]] but is accepted by the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]].

This is an incomplete list of more recent recorded major earthquakes that have occurred within the boundaries of [[Indonesia]]—as indicated by the geology of the region, and the volcanic activity—much large numbers of earthquakes of smaller magnitude occur very regularly due to the meeting of major tectonic plates in the region. Based on the records of the [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]], Indonesia has had more than 150 earthquakes with magnitude &gt; 7 in the period 1901–2017.

This is a list of the most [[topographic isolation|topographically isolated]] [[mountain]]s of [[Switzerland]]. This list only includes summits with an isolation of at least {{convert|10.0|km|mi|}}, regardless of their [[elevation]] or [[topographical prominence]] (drop). For a general list of mountains, with height and prominence ranking, see [[List of mountains of Switzerland]].

The list includes all eight [[ultra-prominent peak]]s of Switzerland as well as several [[List of Swiss cantons by elevation|canton high points]].

The '''Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate''' (MEF) was launched on March 28, 2009. The MEF is intended to facilitate a candid dialogue among major [[developed country|developed]] and [[developing country|developing economies]], help generate the political leadership necessary to achieve a successful outcome at the December UN climate change conference in [[Copenhagen]], and advance the exploration of concrete initiatives and joint ventures that increase the supply of [[sustainable energy|clean energy]] while cutting [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.majoreconomiesforum.org/about/descriptionpurpose.html MEF Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 17 major economies are: [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[China]], the [[European Union]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], [[South Africa]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. [[Denmark]], in its capacity as the President of the December 2009 Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the United Nations have also participated in this dialogue along with Observers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.majoreconomiesforum.org/images/stories/documents/the%20major%20economies%20forum%20april%202010.pdf MEF Fact sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first preparatory meeting of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate met April 27–28, 2009, in Washington, DC, attended by Leaders’ representatives and other officials from seventeen major economies, as well as the United Nations and Denmark.  Participants welcomed President [[Barack Obama|Obama’s]] initiative in convening the Major Economies Forum.  Discussion was open and candid. Participants agreed that the Forum is not an alternative to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UN Framework Convention]] process, but could inform and complement and make a major contribution to success in the UN negotiations in Copenhagen, as well as implementation of the [[Bali Roadmap]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.majoreconomiesforum.org/past-meetings/the-first-leaders-representatives-meeting.html The First Leaders' Representatives Meeting Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second preparatory meeting of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate was convened in [[Paris]], May 25–26, 2009, to inform and complement and make a contribution to success in the UN negotiations in Copenhagen, as well as implementation of the Bali Roadmap. Participants built on the initial discussions in Washington in April, reiterating that climate change demands immediate action by all major economies.  They agreed on the importance of leadership by the major economies, including that their level of ambition should reflect science and that their robust national actions should contribute to credible long-term emissions reductions. They also shared the view that the transformation to a [[low-carbon economy]] can be an opportunity for growth and sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.majoreconomiesforum.org/past-meetings/the-second-leaders-representatives-meeting.html The Second Leaders' Representatives Meeting Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

The third preparatory meeting of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate met in Jiutepec, Mexico, June 22–23, 2009.  Participants agreed on the need for a strong political message in support of action on climate change including for a successful outcome in Copenhagen and at the upcoming Leaders’ Meeting in Italy, building on the outcome from the Leaders’ Meeting in Hokkaido Toyako, Japan, in July 2008. Participants continued active discussions on key elements that Leaders might focus on in their discussions including mitigation, financing, technology, and adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.majoreconomiesforum.org/past-meetings/the-third-leaders-representatives-meeting.html The Third Leaders' Representatives Meeting Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Secretary Kerry Delivers Remarks at the Major Economies Forum (29764598612).jpg|thumb|Meeting in September 2016]]
The First Leaders Meeting took place on July 9, 2009 in L'Aquila, Italy.  The MEF Leaders discussed the vision for future cooperation on climate change, and released a Declaration Of The Leaders The Major Economies Forum On Energy And Climate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.majoreconomiesforum.org/past-meetings/the-first-leaders-meeting.html The First Leaders Meeting Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth meeting at the Leaders’ representative level of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate met in Washington, DC, September 17–18, 2009.  Participants agreed that the Forum continues to provide a useful opportunity to discuss key issues, explore new ideas, and identify points of shared understandings, as a contribution to the preparations for the Copenhagen Climate Conference in December 2009. There was wide interest in focusing on matters where discussions could help advance toward a convergence of views in Copenhagen. Participants continued their robust exchange of views on adaptation, mitigation, measuring, reporting, and verification, and technology at the session.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.majoreconomiesforum.org/past-meetings/the-fourth-leaders-representatives-meeting.html The Fourth Leaders' Representatives Meeting Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth meeting at the Leaders’ representative level of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate met in London, United Kingdom, October 18–19, 2009.  To contribute to success at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, countries focused on finding convergence among their views on finance, technology, mitigation pathways, how to reflect mitigation commitments and actions, and means to improve transparency and accountability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.majoreconomiesforum.org/past-meetings/the-fifth-leaders-representatives-meeting.html The Fifth Leaders' Representatives Meeting Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sixth Meeting at the Leaders’ representative level of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate met in Washington, DC, April 19, 2010.  Participants agreed that smaller, informal discussions such as the Major Economies Forum contributed to success in Copenhagen and can facilitate and enrich the discussions under the UNFCCC, the multilateral forum for negotiating climate change.  Parties also highlighted the importance of discussions being representative and transparent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.majoreconomiesforum.org/past-meetings/the-sixth-leaders-representatives-meeting.html The Sixth Leaders' Representatives Meeting Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
The Leaders of the 17 MEF partners agreed that moving to a clean energy economy provides an opportunity to promote continued economic growth and sustainable development as part of a vigorous response to the danger posed by climate change. They identified an urgent need for deployment of clean energy technologies at the lowest possible cost, and established the Global Partnership to drive transformational progress.  As an initial step, they requested a suite of Technology Action Plans, which now span ten climate-related technologies that together address more than 80% of the energy sector carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reduction potential identified by the IEA. MEF partners agreed to lead the work to develop the Technology Action Plans.  These technologies include:

• Advanced Vehicles (Canada) 
• [[Bioenergy]] (Brazil and Italy) 
• [[carbon capture and storage|Carbon Capture]], Use &amp; Storage (Australia and United Kingdom) 
• [[efficient energy use|Energy Efficiency]] – Buildings Sector (United States) 
• Energy Efficiency – Industrial Sector (United States) 
• High-Efficiency, Low-Emissions (HELE) Coal (India and Japan) 
• [[Marine Energy]] (France) 
• [[Smart Grid]] (Italy and Korea) 
• [[Solar Energy]] (Germany and Spain) 
• [[Wind Energy]] (Denmark, Germany, and Spain)

Each of the Technology Action Plans contains a wealth of detail for countries to consider, including the (1) mitigation potential of the technology, (2) barriers and best practice strategies to overcome them, and (3) a menu of specific potential individual and collective country actions to move towards best practice policies as appropriate to their respective national circumstance and priorities. Such actions can help to reduce market barriers and realize the full potential of clean energy technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.majoreconomiesforum.org/images/stories/documents/mef%20global%20partnership%20factsheet_april2010.pdf The Global Partnership Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maskelynite''' is a [[glass]]y [[phase (matter)|phase]] found in some [[meteorite]]s and meteorite [[impact crater]]s.  Typical samples are similar in composition to [[plagioclase]] [[feldspar]], and revert to that mineral when melted and recrystallized.  It was named after [[British people|British]] [[geology|geologist]] [[Nevil Story Maskelyne|M.H.N. Story-Maskelyne]].

The [[Dhofar 378 meteorite]] is 47% maskelynite by volume.

==History==
The phase was first identified in the [[Shergotty meteorite]] by [[Gustav Tschermak von Seysenegg|G. Tschermak]] (1872) as an isotropic glass of an unknown origin with
near [[labradorite]] composition.&lt;ref name=Chen99&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar phases were found in [[chondrites]] and [[Mars meteorite|Martian (SNC) meteorite]]s.  In 1963, D. J. Milton and P. S. de Carli produced a maskelynite-like glass by subjecting [[gabbro]] to an [[explosive]] [[shock wave]].&lt;ref name=MiCa63&gt;{{cite journal

 | url = http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM52/AM52_244.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
At first, maskelynite was believed to result from solid-state transformation of plagioclase into [[diaplectic glass]] by a relatively low-pressure [[shock wave]] (250 to 300 [[kilobar]]s) and low-temperature (350 [[Celsius|°C]]), as in Milton and de Carli's experiment.&lt;ref name=MiCa63/&gt;  Since 1997 this hypothesis has been challenged, and now it is believed that the glass is formed by the [[quenching]] of dense mineral melts produced by higher-pressure shock waves.&lt;ref name=Chen99/&gt;

[[File:Archean Greenstone Pillow Lava in Michigan USA 3.jpg|thumb|Metavolcanic rock from Michigan, USA.]]
In [[geology]], '''metavolcanic rock''' is a type of [[metamorphic rock]]. Such a rock was first produced by a [[volcano]], either as [[lava]] or [[tephra]]. Then, the rock was buried underneath subsequent rock and was subjected to high pressures and temperatures, causing the rock to [[recrystallization (geology)|recrystallize]]. Metavolcanic rock is commonly found in [[greenstone belt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mrdata.usgs.gov/geology/state/sgmc-lith.php?text=metavolcanic+rock|title=Geologic units containing Metavolcanic rock|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metavolcanic rock can contain the [[mineral]]s [[quartz]], [[feldspar]], [[amphibole]], [[pyroxene]]. Less common minerals can include [[biotite]], [[garnet]], [[actinolite]], [[epidote]], [[chalcedony]], [[prehnite]], and [[wodginite]].

'''''Montia fontana''''', commonly known as '''blinks''' or '''water blinks''', '''water chickweed''' or '''annual water miner's lettuce''', is a herbaceous annual plant of the genus ''[[Montia]]''. It is a common plant that can be found in wet environments around the globe, from the [[tropics]] to the [[Arctic]]. It is quite variable in morphology, taking a variety of forms. It is sometimes [[aquatic plant|aquatic]].

Montia fontana is divided into four subspecies, subsp. fontana, subsp. amporitana, subsp. chondrosperma and subsp. variabilis&lt;ref&gt;Moore, D. M. 1963. The subspecies of Montia fontana L. Bot. Not. 116: 16-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walters, S. M. 1953. Montia fontana L. Watsonia 3: 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nature''''' is a British [[multidisciplinary]] [[scientific journal]], first published on 4 November 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Huxley | first1 = T.

Research scientists are the primary audience for the journal, but summaries and accompanying articles are intended to make many of the most important papers understandable to scientists in other fields and the educated public. Towards the front of each issue are [[editorial]]s, news and feature articles on issues of general interest to scientists, including current affairs, science funding, business, scientific ethics and research breakthroughs. There are also sections on books, arts, and short science fiction stories. The remainder of the journal consists mostly of research papers (articles or letters), which are often dense and highly technical. Because of strict limits on the length of papers, often the printed text is actually a summary of the work in question with many details relegated to accompanying ''supplementary material'' on the journal's website.

There are many fields of [[research]] in which important new advances and original research are published as either articles or letters in ''Nature.'' The papers that have been published in this journal are internationally acclaimed for maintaining high research standards. Fewer than 8% of submitted papers are accepted for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/authors/get_published/index.html |title=Getting published in Nature : For authors and referees : Nature |website=nature.com |language=en |access-date=2017-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Background===
The enormous progress in science and mathematics during the 19th century was recorded in journals written mostly in German or French, as well as in English. Britain underwent enormous technological and industrial changes and advances particularly in the latter half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schroeder |first1=Robert |first2= Gretta E.|last2= Siegel | doi = 10.1353/scp.2006.0006 | year = 2006 | title = A Cooperative Publishing Model for Sustainable Scholarship| journal = Journal of Scholarly Publishing | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 86–98 (88)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In English the most respected scientific journals of this time were the refereed journals of the [[Royal Society]], which had published many of the great works from [[Isaac Newton]], [[Michael Faraday]] through to early works from [[Charles Darwin]]. In addition, during this period, the number of popular science periodicals doubled from the 1850s to the 1860s.&lt;ref name="Bar3"&gt;{{Cite journal 
| last1 = Barton | first1 = R. 
| title = Just before Nature: The purposes of science and the purposes of popularization in some english popular science journals of the 1860s 
| journal = Annals of Science 
| volume = 55

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the editors of these popular science magazines, the publications were designed to serve as "organs of science", in essence, a means of connecting the public to the scientific world.&lt;ref name="Bar3"/&gt;

''Nature'', first created in 1869, was not the first magazine of its kind in Britain. One journal to precede ''Nature'' was ''[[Recreative Science: A Record and Remembrancer of Intellectual Observation]]'', which, created in 1859, began as a [[natural history]] magazine and progressed to include more physical observational science and technical subjects and less natural history.&lt;ref name="Bar7"&gt;[[#Barton|Barton]], "Just Before Nature," p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The journal's name changed from its original title to ''Intellectual Observer: A Review of Natural History, Microscopic Research, and Recreative Science'' and then later to the ''Student and Intellectual Observer of Science, Literature, and Art''.&lt;ref name="Bar6"&gt;[[#Barton|Barton]], "Just Before Nature," p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Recreative Science'' had attempted to include more physical sciences such as [[astronomy]] and [[archaeology]], the ''Intellectual Observer'' broadened itself further to include literature and art as well.&lt;ref name="Bar6"/&gt; Similar to ''Recreative Science'' was the scientific journal ''[[Popular Science Review]]'', created in 1862,&lt;ref name="Bar13"&gt;[[#Barton|Barton]], "Just Before Nature," p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; which covered different fields of science by creating subsections titled "Scientific Summary" or "Quarterly Retrospect", with book reviews and commentary on the latest scientific works and publications.&lt;ref name="Bar13"/&gt; Two other journals produced in England prior to the development of ''Nature'' were the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Science]]'' and ''[[Scientific Opinion]]'', established in 1864 and 1868, respectively.&lt;ref name="Bar6"/&gt; The journal most closely related to ''Nature'' in its editorship and format was ''The Reader'', created in 1864; the publication mixed science with literature and art in an attempt to reach an audience outside of the scientific community, similar to ''Popular Science Review''.&lt;ref name="Bar6"/&gt;

These similar journals all ultimately failed. The ''Popular Science Review'' survived longest, lasting 20 years and ending its publication in 1881; ''Recreative Science'' ceased publication as the ''Student and Intellectual Observer'' in 1871. The ''Quarterly Journal'', after undergoing a number of editorial changes, ceased publication in 1885. ''The Reader'' terminated in 1867, and finally, ''Scientific Opinion'' lasted a mere 2 years, until June 1870.&lt;ref name="Bar7"/&gt;

===Creation ===
[[File:Nature cover, November 4, 1869.jpg|thumb|right|upright|First title page, 4 November 1869]]
Not long after the conclusion of ''The Reader'', a former editor, [[Norman Lockyer]], decided to create a new scientific journal titled ''Nature'',&lt;ref name="B248"&gt;[[#Browne|Browne]], ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'', p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; taking its name from a line by [[William Wordsworth]]: "To the solid ground of nature trusts the Mind that builds for aye".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/145/ww698.html Poem: "A Volant Tribe of Bards on earth are found"]. Bartleby.com. Retrieved on 2013-06-20.&lt;/ref&gt; First owned and published by [[Alexander Macmillan (publisher)|Alexander Macmillan]], ''Nature'' was similar to its predecessors in its attempt to "provide cultivated readers with an accessible forum for reading about advances in scientific knowledge."&lt;ref name="B248"/&gt; Janet Browne has proposed that "far more than any other science journal of the period, ''Nature'' was conceived, born, and raised to serve polemic purpose."&lt;ref name="B248"/&gt; Many of the early editions of ''Nature'' consisted of articles written by members of a group that called itself the [[X Club]], a group of scientists known for having liberal, progressive, and somewhat controversial scientific beliefs relative to the time period.&lt;ref name="B248"/&gt; Initiated by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], the group consisted of such important scientists as [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[John Tyndall]], along with another five scientists and mathematicians; these scientists were all avid supporters of Darwin's theory of evolution as [[common descent]], a theory which, during the latter half of the 19th century, received a great deal of criticism among more conservative groups of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Browne|Browne]], ''Charles Darwin: The Power of Place'', p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps it was in part its scientific liberality that made ''Nature'' a longer-lasting success than its predecessors. [[John Maddox]], editor of ''Nature'' from 1966 to 1973 as well as from 1980 to 1995, suggested at a celebratory dinner for the journal's centennial edition that perhaps it was the journalistic qualities of Nature that drew readers in; "journalism" Maddox states, "is a way of creating a sense of community among people who would otherwise be isolated from each other. This is what Lockyer's journal did from the start."&lt;ref name="Dinner"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1970|title=The 'Nature' Centenary Dinner|jstor=530861|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London|volume= 25|issue=1|doi=10.1098/rsnr.1970.0002 |pages=9–15(13)|author1=Maddox, John  |author2=Macmillan, Harold  |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Maddox mentions that the financial backing of the journal in its first years by the Macmillan family also allowed the journal to flourish and develop more freely than scientific journals before it.&lt;ref name="Dinner"/&gt;
 
====Editors====
[[Norman Lockyer]], the founder of ''Nature'', was a professor at [[Imperial College]]. He was succeeded as editor in 1919 by [[Sir Richard Gregory, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Gregory]].&lt;ref name="NPG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://npg.nature.com/npg/servlet/Content?data=xml/02_history.xml&amp;style=xml/02_history.xsl |title=Nature Publishing Group: History |website=nature.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115084545/http://npg.nature.com/npg/servlet/Content?data=xml%2F02_history.xml&amp;style=xml%2F02_history.xsl |archivedate=15 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory helped to establish ''Nature'' in the international scientific community. His obituary by the Royal Society stated: "Gregory was always very interested in the international contacts of science, and in the columns of ''Nature'' he always gave generous space to accounts of the activities of the International Scientific Unions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Richard Arman Gregory, 1864–1952|journal= Obituary Notices of Fellows of the Royal Society|volume= 8|issue=22|pages=410–417 (413)|year=1953|doi=10.1098/rsbm.1953.0007 |author=Stratton, F. J. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the years 1945 to 1973, editorship of ''Nature'' changed three times, first in 1945 to A. J. V. Gale and [[L. J. F. Brimble]] (who in 1958 became the sole editor), then to [[John Maddox]] in 1965, and finally to [[David 'Dai' Davies|David Davies]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="NPG"/&gt; In 1980, Maddox returned as editor and retained his position until 1995. [[Philip Campbell (scientist)|Philip Campbell]] has since become Editor-in-chief of all ''Nature'' publications.&lt;ref name="NPG"/&gt;

====Expansion and development====
In 1970, ''Nature'' first opened its Washington office; other branches opened in New York in 1985, Tokyo and Munich in 1987, Paris in 1989, San Francisco in 2001, Boston in 2004, and Hong Kong in 2005. In 1971, under [[John Maddox]]'s editorship, the journal split into ''Nature Physical Sciences'' (published on Mondays), ''Nature New Biology'' (published on Wednesdays) and ''Nature'' (published on Fridays). In 1974, Maddox was no longer editor, and the journals were merged into ''Nature''.&lt;ref&gt;

 |language=en
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1980s, the journal underwent a great deal of expansion, launching over ten new journals. These new journals comprise the Nature Publishing Group, which was created in 1999 and includes ''Nature'', Nature Publishing Group Journals, Stockton Press Specialist Journals and Macmillan Reference (renamed NPG Reference).

In 1996, ''Nature'' created its own website&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nature.com/npg_/company_info/timeline2.html|title = Branching out (1970–1999)|date = |accessdate = 2014-11-13|website = nature.com|publisher = Nature Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1999 Nature Publishing Group began its series of ''Nature Reviews''.&lt;ref name="NPG" /&gt; Some articles and papers are available for free on the Nature website. Others require the purchase of premium access to the site. ''Nature'' claims an online readership of about 3 million unique readers per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/news/announcement-a-new-ipad-app-for-nature-readers-1.12002 | title=Announcement: A new iPad app for Nature readers | work=Nature | date=12 December 2012 | accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 October 2008, ''Nature'' endorsed an American presidential candidate for the first time when it supported [[Barack Obama]] during his campaign in [[United States presidential election, 2008|America's 2008 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/4551149a |title=America's choice |year=2008 |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7217 |page=1149 |bibcode=2008Natur.455Q1149. |pmid=18971969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Angliss |url=http://www.scholarsandrogues.com/2008/10/31/nature-endorses-obama/ |title=Weekly science journal ''Nature'' endorses a presidential candidate: Barack Obama (updated) |website=Scholars &amp; Rogues |date=31 October 2008 |access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, an [[Nature Arabic Edition|Arabic edition]] of the magazine was launched in partnership with [[King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology]]. As of the time it was released, it had about 10,000 subscribers.&lt;ref name=NatureME&gt;{{cite web |last= Yahia |first= Mohammed |title= Nature Arabic Edition launches |quote= The first issue of ''Nature Arabic Edition'', an Arabic translation of ''Nature'', has been released.

On 2 December 2014, ''Nature'' announced that it would allow its subscribers and a group of selected media outlets to share links allowing free, "read-only" access to content from its journals. These articles are presented using the [[digital rights management]] system [[ReadCube]] (which is funded by the Macmillan subsidiary Digital Science), and does not allow readers to download, copy, print, or otherwise distribute the content. While it does, to an extent, provide free online access to articles, it is not a true [[open access]] scheme due to its restrictions on re-use and distribution.&lt;ref name=wired-naturefreeview&gt;{{cite web|title=Nature journal subscribers can now share article links globally|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-12/02/nature-publishing|website=Wired.co.uk|accessdate=3 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202182430/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-12/02/nature-publishing|archivedate=2 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-npgreadonly&gt;{{cite news|title=Science journal ''Nature'' to make archives available online|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/02/nature-archives-free|accessdate=3 December 2014|work=The Guardian|date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January 2015, details of a proposed merger with Springer Science+Business Media were announced.&lt;ref&gt;Schuetze, Arno (15 January 2015). [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/15/publishing-ma-idUSF9N0TV00F20150115 "Nature magazine publisher to merge with Springer Science"]. [[Reuters]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 it came under the umbrella of Springer Nature, by the merger of [[Springer Science+Business Media]] and [[Holtzbrinck Publishing Group]]'s [[Nature Publishing Group]], [[Palgrave Macmillan]], and [[Macmillan Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.springer.com/gp/about-springer/media/press-releases/corporate/springer-nature-created-following-merger-completion/256626 |title=Springer Nature created following merger completion |date=6 May 2015 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication in Nature==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2011}}

Being published in ''Nature'' or any ''Nature'' publication is very prestigious. In particular, empirical papers are often highly cited, which can lead to promotions, grant funding, and attention from the mainstream media. Because of these [[positive feedback]] effects, competition among scientists to publish in high-level journals like ''Nature'' and its closest competitor, ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', can be very fierce. ''Nature''{{'}}s [[impact factor]], a measure of how many citations a journal generates in other works, was 38.138 in 2015 (as measured by [[Institute for Scientific Information|Thomson ISI]]), among the highest of any science journal.

As with most other professional scientific journals, papers undergo an initial screening by the editor, followed by [[peer review]] (in which other scientists, chosen by the editor for expertise with the subject matter but who have no connection to the research under review, will read and critique articles), before publication. In the case of ''Nature'', they are only sent for review if it is decided that they deal with a topical subject and are sufficiently ground-breaking in that particular field. As a consequence, the majority of submitted papers are rejected without review.

According to ''Nature''{{'}}s original [[mission statement]]:
{{quote|It is intended, FIRST, to place before the general public the grand results of Scientific Work and Scientific Discovery; and to urge the claims of Science to a more general recognition in Education and in Daily Life; and, SECONDLY, to aid Scientific men themselves, by giving early information of all advances made in any branch of Natural knowledge throughout the world, and by affording them an opportunity of discussing the various Scientific questions which arise from time to time.&lt;ref name=nature1869&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/npg_/company_info/mission.html |title=Nature's mission statement |accessdate=11 September 2008 |work= nature.com|date=11 November 1869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This was revised in 2000 to:
{{quote|First, to serve scientists through prompt publication of significant advances in any branch of science, and to provide a forum for the reporting and discussion of news and issues concerning science. Second, to ensure that the results of science are rapidly disseminated to the public throughout the world, in a fashion that conveys their significance for knowledge, culture and daily life.&lt;ref name=nature2000&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/about/index.html |title=Nature's mission statement |website=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Controversies===
In 2017, Nature published an editorial entitled "Removing Statues of Historical figures risks whitewashing history: Science must acknowledge mistakes as it marks its past". The article commented on the placement and maintenance of statues honouring scientists with known unethical, abusive and torturous histories. Specifically, the editorial called on examples of [[J. Marion Sims]], the 'Father of gynecology' who experimented on African American female slaves who were unable to give informed consent, and [[Thomas Parran Jr.]] who oversaw the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]].  The editorial as written made the case that removing such statues, and erasing names, runs the risk of "whitewashing history", and stated “Instead of removing painful reminders, perhaps these should be supplemented”. The article caused a large outcry and was quickly modified by Nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Science must acknowledge its past mistakes and crimes |date=4 September 2017 |url=https://www.nature.com/news/science-must-acknowledge-its-past-mistakes-and-crimes-1.22557?sf111543858=1&amp;WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews |website=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article was largely seen as offensive, inappropriate, and by many, racist. Nature acknowledged that the article as originally written was "offensive and poorly worded" and published selected letters of response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Readers respond to Nature’s Editorial on historical monuments |date=8 September 2017 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/readers-respond-to-nature-s-editorial-on-historical-monuments-1.22584 |website=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial came just weeks after hundreds of white supremacists marched in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] in the [[Unite the Right Rally|Unite the Right rally]] to oppose the removal of [[Robert Edward Lee Sculpture|a statue of Robert E. Lee]], setting off violence in the streets and killing a young woman. When Nature posted a link to the editorial on [[Twitter]], the thread quickly exploded with criticisms. In response, several scientists called for a boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Schulson |first=Michael |title=History Lessons for ‘Nature’|date=17 September 2017 |newspaper=Undark Magazine |url=https://undark.org/article/nature-journal-j-marion-sims/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September 2017, the editorial was updated and edited by Philip Campbell, the editor of the journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Campbell |first=Philip |title=Statues: An Editorial Response|date= 18 September 2017 |newspaper=Nature |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/549334c.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Paul Lauterbur]] and [[Peter Mansfield]] won a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for research initially rejected by ''Nature'' and published only after Lauterbur appealed the rejection, ''Nature'' acknowledged more of its own missteps in rejecting papers in an editorial titled, "Coping with Peer Rejection":
{{quote|[T]here are unarguable ''faux pas'' in our history. These include the rejection of [[Čherenkov radiation|Cherenkov radiation]], [[Hideki Yukawa]]'s [[meson]], work on [[photosynthesis]] by [[Johann Deisenhofer]], [[Robert Huber]] and [[Hartmut Michel]], and the initial rejection (but eventual acceptance) of [[Stephen Hawking]]'s [[Hawking radiation|black-hole radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6959/full/425645a.html |journal=Nature |date=16 October 2003 |title=Coping with peer rejection |volume=425 |page=645 |doi=10.1038/425645a |pmid=14562060 |issue=6959 |bibcode=2003Natur.425..645.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From 2000 to 2001, a series of five fraudulent papers by [[Schön scandal|Jan Hendrik Schön]] was published in ''Nature''. The papers, about [[semiconductors]], were revealed to contain falsified data and other scientific fraud. In 2003, ''Nature'' retracted the papers. The Schön scandal was not limited to ''Nature''; other prominent journals, such as ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and ''[[Physical Review]]'', also retracted papers by Schön.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v422/n6927/index.html |journal=Nature |date=6 March 2003 |title=Retractions' realities |volume=422 |issue=6927 |page=1 |doi=10.1038/422001a |pmid=12621394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1988, after nearly a year of guided scrutiny from its editors, ''Nature'' published a controversial and seemingly anomalous paper detailing Dr. [[Jacques Benveniste]] and his team's work studying human [[Basophil granulocyte|basophil]] [[degranulation]] in the presence of extremely dilute [[antibody]] serum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vet-servis.ru/downloads/nature333-30-1988.pdf |title=vet-servis.ru |publisher=Vet-servis.ru |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, their paper concluded that less than a single molecule of antibody could trigger an immune response in human basophils, defying the physical [[law of mass action]]. The paper excited substantial media attention in Paris, chiefly because their research sought funding from [[homeopathic]] medicine companies. Public inquiry prompted ''Nature'' to mandate an extensive, stringent and scientifically questionable experimental [[replication (statistics)|replication]] in Benveniste's lab, through which his team's results were categorically refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Before publishing one of its most famous discoveries, [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]]'s 1953 [[Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid|paper]] on the [[structure of DNA]], ''Nature'' did not send the paper out for peer review. [[John Maddox]], ''Nature''{{'}}s editor, stated: "the Watson and Crick paper was not peer-reviewed by ''Nature'' ... the paper could not have been refereed: its correctness is self-evident. No referee working in the field ... could have kept his mouth shut once he saw the structure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maddox |first1=J. |doi=10.1038/426119b |title=How genius can smooth the road to publication |journal=Nature |volume=426 |issue=6963 |page=119 |year=2003|bibcode=2003Natur.426..119M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier error occurred when [[Enrico Fermi]] submitted his breakthrough paper on the weak [[Fermi's interaction|interaction theory]] of [[beta decay]]. ''Nature'' turned down the paper because it was considered too remote from reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rhodes, Richard |title=The Making of the Atomic Bomb|publisher= Touchstone|location= New York|date= 1986|isbn= 0-671-44133-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermi's paper was published by ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'' in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fermi |first1=E. |title=Versuch einer Theorie der β-Strahlen.

==Science fiction==
In 1999 ''Nature'' began publishing [[science fiction]] [[short stories]]. The brief "[[vignette (literature)|vignettes]]" are printed in a series called "Futures". The stories appeared in 1999 and 2000, again in 2005 and 2006, and have appeared weekly since July 2007.&lt;ref name="futures"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/focus/arts/futures/ | title=Futures | work=Nature | accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sister publication ''[[Nature Physics]]'' also printed stories in 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref name="FuturesPhysics"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nature.com/nphys/archive/categ_fut_012008.html |title=Futures Archive |work= [[Nature Physics]] |accessdate= 2014-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ''Nature'' was awarded the [[European Science Fiction Society]]'s Best Publisher award for the "Futures" series.&lt;ref name="ESFSAward"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.esfs.info/esfs-awards-2000.html#2005 |title= The ESFS Awards, Eurocon 2005: Glasgow – Scotland |author= [[European Science Fiction Society]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; One hundred of the ''Nature'' stories between 1999 and 2006 were published as the collection ''Futures from Nature'' in 2008.&lt;ref name="FuturesCollection"&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.tor-forge.com/futuresfromnature |title= Futures from Nature: 100 Speculative fictions from the pages of the leading science journal |editor= Henry Gee |publisher= [[Tor Books]] |date= 2008 |location= New York City |isbn= 0-7653-1805-9 |quote= With stories from: [[Arthur C.

''Nature'' is edited and published in the United Kingdom by a division of the international [[scientific publishing]] company [[Springer Nature]] that publishes [[academic journal]]s, [[magazine]]s, online databases, and services in science and medicine. ''Nature'' has offices in London, New York City, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., [[Boston]], Tokyo, Hong Kong, Paris, [[Munich]], and [[Basingstoke]]. Nature Publishing Group also publishes other specialized journals including ''[[Nature Neuroscience]]'', ''[[Nature Biotechnology]],'' ''[[Nature Methods]]'', the ''[[Nature Clinical Practice]]'' series of journals, ''[[Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology]]'', ''[[Nature Chemistry]]'', and the ''Nature Reviews'' series of journals.

Since 2005, each issue of ''Nature'' has been accompanied by a ''[[Nature Podcast]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nature.com/nature/podcast/archive.html | work = Nature |title = Archive: Nature Podcast |accessdate = 2014-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring highlights from the issue and interviews with the articles' authors and the journalists covering the research. It is presented by Kerri Smith, and features interviews with scientists on the latest research, as well as news reports from Nature's editors and journalists. The Nature Podcast was founded – and the first 100 episodes were produced and presented – by clinician and virologist [[Chris Smith, The Naked Scientist|Chris Smith]] of Cambridge and ''[[The Naked Scientists]]''.

In 2007, Nature Publishing Group began publishing ''Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics'', the official journal of the American Society of Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics and ''Molecular Therapy'', the American Society of Gene Therapy's official journal, as well as the ''International Society for Microbial Ecology (ISME) Journal''. Nature Publishing Group launched ''Nature Photonics'' in 2007 and ''Nature Geoscience'' in 2008. ''Nature Chemistry'' published its first issue in April 2009.

Nature Publishing Group actively supports the self-archiving process and in 2002 was one of the first publishers to allow authors to post their contributions on their personal websites, by requesting an exclusive licence to publish, rather than requiring authors to transfer copyright. In December 2007, Nature Publishing Group introduced the Creative Commons attribution-non commercial-share alike unported licence for those articles in Nature journals that are publishing the primary sequence of an organism's genome for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1864.html |title=Interview with Timo Hannay, director of web publishing for Nature Publishing Group |work=Jon Udell's Interviews with Innovators |date=2007-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a collection of articles from ''Nature'' was edited by John S. Partington under the title ''H. G. Wells in Nature, 1893–1946: A Reception Reader'' and published by Peter Lang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Partington, John S. |year=2008 |title=H. G.

The '''nuvistor''' is a type of [[vacuum tube]] announced by [[RCA]] in 1959.  Most nuvistors are basically [[thimble]]-shaped, but somewhat smaller than a thimble, and much smaller than conventional tubes of the day, almost approaching the compactness of early discrete transistor casings.  [[Triode]]s and a few [[tetrode]]s were made. The tube is made entirely of metal and ceramic. Making nuvistors requires special equipment, since there is no intubation to pump gases out of the envelope. Instead, the entire structure is assembled, inserted into its metal envelope, sealed and processed in a large vacuum chamber with simple robotic devices.

Nuvistors are among the highest performing small signal receiving tubes.  They feature excellent VHF and UHF performance plus low noise figures, and were widely used throughout the 1960s in [[television set]]s (beginning with RCA's "New Vista" line of color sets in 1961 with the CTC-11 chassis), radio and high-fidelity equipment primarily in RF sections, and oscilloscopes.  They competed with the [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] revolution, and along with GE's [[Compactron]], probably held it at bay for a few years.  RCA discontinued their use in television tuners for its product line in late 1971.  One famous application was in the [[Ampex]] MR-70, a costly studio tape recorder whose entire electronics section was based on nuvistors. Another limited application of this very small tube was in studio-grade microphones from that era, the AKG/Norelco C12a, which employed the 7586, being a good example. It was also later found that, with minor circuit modification, the nuvistor made a sufficient replacement for the obsolete Telefunken VF14 tube, used in the famed Neumann [[U 47]] studio [[microphone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telefunken-elektroakustik.com/products/show_product.php?item=12 Telefunken: TELEFUNKEN U47M (EF14)]&lt;/ref&gt;. Tektronix also used nuvistors in several of its high end oscilloscopes of the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;http://w140.com/tekwiki/wiki/Nuvistor TekWiki Nuvistor article&lt;/ref&gt;, before replacing them later with [[JFET]] transistors.

==Types==
* 7586 - First one released, medium mu triode
* 7587 - Sharp cutoff tetrode
* 8056 - triode for low plate voltages
* 8058 - triode, with plate cap &amp; grid on shell, for UHF performance
* 7895 - 7586 with higher mu
* 2CW4 - Same as type 6CW4, but with a 2.1 volt / 450 milliampere heater.  Used in television receivers with series heater strings
* 6CW4 - high mu triode, most common one in consumer electronics
* 6DS4 - remote cutoff 6CW4
* 6DV4 - medium mu, intended as UHF oscillator, shell sometimes gold plated
* 8393 - medium mu, used in Tektronix scopes (12.6 volt filament)
* 13CW4 - same as 6CW4, but with 12.6 Volt / 230 milliampere heater

The '''Orapa Power Station''' is a [[Peaking power plant|Peak load power generation plant]] located in the mining town of [[Orapa]] in northeastern [[Botswana]] in the [[Central District (Botswana)|Central District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&amp;aid=587&amp;dir=2011/October/Monday10/|title=Mmegi Online :: Orapa power plant to be finally launched|work=Mmegi Online|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is built within the [[Debswana|Debswana Diamond Company Ltd]] [[Orapa diamond mine]] [[lease|fenced leased area]] and is operated by the [[Botswana Power Corporation]].


==Background==
The plant construction was initiated when [[Botswana]] started experiencing electricity supply challenges from year '''2007''' when demand for electricity in the [[country]] started exceeding the county's electricity generation capacity leading to forced periodic nation wide [[Rolling_blackout|load shedding]] excises by the [[Botswana Power Corporation]]. The plant was a short term response to the mining industry electricity requirements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&amp;aid=5796&amp;dir=2010/October/Friday22 Developers of Orapa's 90MW push for 60 % cost reduction]&lt;/ref&gt; prior to the development of Mmamabula and Morupule B power stations.

The plant site is located next to an [[electrical substation]] through which it connects to the [[Electrical grid|national grid]] and was designed to use either [[natural gas]] or [[Diesel_fuel|diesel]] as [[fuel]]. It was commissioned using [[Diesel_fuel|diesel]] with a planned conversion to [[natural gas]] once construction of a [[Pipeline transport|gas pipeline]] from nearby [[Coalbed methane|gas fields]] was complete and commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundaystandard.info/kalahari-energy-convert-diesel-orapa-power-plant-cbm-operation Kalahari Energy to convert diesel Orapa Power Plant to CBM operation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
The plant consists of two 45MW [[GE LM6000]] Sprint [[Simple_cycle_combustion_turbine|Simple Cycle]] [[gas turbines]] fueled using [[Diesel_fuel|diesel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaystandard.info/bpc-gets-orapa-90mw-power-station|title=BPC gets Orapa 90MW Power Station {{!}} Sunday Standard|website=www.sundaystandard.info|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy produced is transferred to the [[Electrical grid|national grid]] via the interconnected Orapa Substation by use of two short [[Electric power transmission|132kV overhead power lines]].

Born in New York City, Paul Brooks received in 1931 his bachelor's degree from Harvard University, where he was the editor of the [[Harvard Lampoon]].&lt;ref name=WaldenOrg/&gt; Soon after graduation, he became an employee at the publishing company [[Houghton Mifflin]] in Boston and remained with the company for 40 years. He was editor-in-chief of Houghton Mifflin's General Book Department from 1943 until his retirement in 1969. He wrote ''Two Park Street: A Publishing Memoir'', containing anecdotes about his experiences editing the works of [[Rachel Carson]], [[Roger Tory Peterson]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]], and [[James Agee]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of ''Two Park Street'' by Paul Brooks|website=Publishers Weekly|date=1 December 1986|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-395-37774-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Brooks suggested the title ''Silent Spring'' for Rachel Carson's famous book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=And No Birds Sing: Rhetorical Analyses of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring|editor=Waddell, Craig|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HzvI1hotILUC&amp;pg=PR15|year=2000|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|pages=xv–xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his career as an editor, Brooks was also a prolific author of books and articles. He won the 1965 [[John Burroughs Medal]] for his 1964 book ''Roadless Area''.

Captain '''Peter James Bethune''' (born 4 April 1965) is a New Zealand ship's [[Sea captain|captain]] with 500 ton master licence, [[Publishing|published]] [[author]], producer of ''The Operatives'' [[Television program|TV Show]], and [[Public speaking|public speaker]].  He is the founder of ''Earthrace Conservation'' . He works assisting countries in [[Asia]], [[Central America]] and [[Africa]] with [[Fishery|fisheries]] [[enforcement]] and [[anti-poaching]]. He is the holder of the [[world record]] for [[Circumnavigation|circumnavigating]] the globe in his powerboat ''Earthrace'', a [[Wave-piercing hull|wavepiercing]] [[trimaran]] powered with [[biofuel]]s.
''Earthrace'' was renamed the ''[[Ady Gil]]'' in 2009 and Captain Bethune sailed it in [[Antarctica]] for [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]]&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; to disrupt [[Japan]]ese [[whaling]] activities. The vessel was involved in a [[collision]] with a Japanese whaling vessel. He subsequently boarded the whaling vessel the ''Shonan Maru 2'' and presented the [[Sea captain|Captain]] with an invoice for the ''Ady Gil''. Captain Bethune was taken back to Japan and charged with a number of offenses related to his [[anti-whaling]] activities and received a [[suspended sentence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/10534373|title=Whaling activist Bethune given suspended sentence|date=2010-07-07|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-08-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Captain. Bethune started ''Earthrace Conservation'' that works on [[Conservation biology|conservation]] and [[Environmental policy|environmental]] campaigns. His team consists of former [[military]] personnel, and they are involved in [[Fishery|fisheries]] [[enforcement]], [[anti-poaching]], and stopping [[wildlife smuggling]].  Many of the missions have been filmed and made into the TV Series ''The Operatives'' that has now aired in around 90 countries.  More recently his work has involved training government teams on [[coast]]al and offshore [[surveillance]], [[Fishery|fisheries]] [[enforcement]], and [[maritime security]].

Captain Bethune is currently developing ''Earthrace-2'', a 60m [[trimaran]] for [[Conservation biology|conservation]] work, fisheries enforcement and [[Scientific method|scientific research]].

==Personal life and early career==
Captain Bethune grew up in Hamilton West, [[New Zealand]] as one of five children. He completed a [[Master of Business Administration]] at the [[Macquarie Graduate School of Management]], [[Bachelor of Science]] at the [[University of Waikato]], and a [[Bachelor of Engineering]] at the [[University of Auckland]].&lt;ref name="NZ Herald 2006-04-08"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/personalities/news/article.cfm?c_id=72&amp;objectid=10376534&amp;pnum=0|title=Mad sailor Peter Bethune not a nutcase|last=Hewitson|first=Michele|date=8 April 2006|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has two daughters with his wife, Sharyn, his high school sweetheart,&lt;ref name="NZ Herald 2010-02-20"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/eloise-gibson/news/article.cfm?a_id=366&amp;objectid=10627312&amp;pnum=0|title=Love him or hate him, he's effective, says activist's wife|last=Gibson |first=Eloise|date=20 February 2010|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; from whom he [[divorce]]d in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Home Alone|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/features/3725222/Home-alone|accessdate=25 May 2010|newspaper=Sunday Star Times|date=23 May 2010|author=Wall, Tony|author2=Coldicott, Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began his career as an [[Hydrocarbon exploration|oil exploration]] [[engineer]] for [[Schlumberger]] Wireline Services{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} and worked in the [[North Sea]] and [[Libya]].&lt;ref name="NZ Herald 2004-07-31"/&gt; In 1997, he co-founded CamSensor Technologies.&lt;ref name="NZ Herald 2004-07-31"/&gt; The company manufactures automated camera systems for controlling robots used in complex tasks such as cutting up and grading meat carcasses.&lt;ref name="NZ Herald 2004-07-31"/&gt; He later moved to [[Sydney]] to establish a subsidiary there.&lt;ref name="NZ Herald 2004-07-31"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3581473|title=Green speedster aims for record|last=Collins|first=Simon|date=31 July 2004|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His entry into conservation started when he wrote a 20,000-word paper titled "Alternative Fuels for Road Transport" while pursuing his [[Master of Business Administration]] degree from [[Macquarie University]] in 2004&lt;ref name="NZ Herald 2004-07-31"/&gt;  He concluded that hydrogen as a fuel was a dead-end, but that [[biofuel]]s such as [[biodiesel]] and [[Ethanol fuel|ethanol]] could become mainstream in use.  He also predicted the battery electric vehicle could eventually replace the combustion engine in terms of road transport.&lt;ref name="NZ Herald 2004-07-31" /&gt; For leisure, Captain Bethune enjoys [[camping]], [[Scuba diving|scuba]], [[freediving]], [[kayaking]], and [[CrossFit|crossfit]].  He told a reporter for ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'': "I've come from a very unusual background to be a [[conservation movement|conservationist]]."&lt;ref name="NZ Herald 2006-04-08"/&gt;

Based on his research at [[Macquarie Graduate School of Management]], Captain Bethune set out to prove that hydrocarbon fuels could be replaced by sustainable [[bio-fuels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.powerboat-world.com/Earthrace---New-Record-Round-the-World-in-60-days/45820/arc|author=Kothe, Rob|title=Earthrace - New Record Round the World in 60 days|publisher=PowerboatWorld.com|date=27 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had ''Earthrace'' designed by [[LOMOcean Design]] and built in order to break the world record for a [[circumnavigation]] of the globe by a powerboat in hopes that it would call attention to the viability of [[biodiesel]] as an alternative fuel. He mortgaged his New Zealand home and financed the building in the hopes of recouping the expenses from sponsorship. He declined a $4&amp;nbsp;million sponsorship from a company that would have required them to use regular diesel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://galvestondailynews.com/story.lasso?ewcd=58e7dcb0ac291c6a|title=Crew hopes biodiesel boat will break record|last=McDonald|first=Sara|date=18 December 2006|work=[[The Galveston County Daily News]]|accessdate=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first attempt began in Barbados on 10 March 2007. He encountered significant delays due to issues with the propellers and other mechanical problems.&lt;ref name="NZ Herald 2007-06-03"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/environment/news/article.cfm?c_id=39&amp;objectid=10443330|title=Earthrace highlights green cause|last=Griffin|first=Peter|date=3 June 2007|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of 19 March, while around {{Convert|22|km|mi|0}} offshore from [[Guatemala]], ''Earthrace'' collided with a local fishing boat.&lt;ref name="Collision"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10429738|accessdate=6 January 2010|title=Earthrace chief in court over tragedy|newspaper=[[New Zealand Herald]]|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]|date=20 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew was absolved of any responsibility after a 10-day investigation during which they were held in custody under armed guard in the [[military]] compound in [[Puerto Quetzal]]. The delays prevented them from completing the circumnavigation in record time using their original start location.  ''The'' crew took ''Earthrace'' to [[San Diego]] where they made repairs.  They then restarted their record attempt, leaving [[San Diego]] on 7 April 2007.  Once they rounded [[Aceh]] in [[Indonesia]] and started crossing the [[Indian Ocean]] the vessel encountered significant bad weather in the first [[Monsoon of South Asia|monsoon]] of the season. The [[Monsoon of South Asia|monsoon]] remained with them all the way to [[Salalah]] in [[Oman]].  The vessel passed through the [[Suez Canal]], then when getting close to  [[Spain]], crew discovered a structural failure around the depth [[transducer]].  Bethune said the "failure was a result of the constant pounding in crossing the [[Indian Ocean|Indian Ocean".]] Crew made temporary repairs and headed out to cross the Atlantic, however the repairs failed and Earthrace limped back to port in [[Málaga]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.intrepidmagazine.co.nz/articles/6/earthrace/|title=Intrepid Adventure New Zealand - Earthrace: The man and the machine|publisher=Intrepidmagazine.co.nz|accessdate=27 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526215710/http://www.intrepidmagazine.co.nz/articles/6/earthrace/|archivedate=26 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bethune decided to abandon the attempt.
Captain Bethune returned to [[New Zealand]] to recover from what he said was "a brutal ordeal".  After meeting with some of his original sponsors, he assembled a new team. The vessel was repaired and departed from [[Sagunto, Spain]], in another record attempt on 1 March 2008.  The second record attempt also suffered a large number of setbacks.  The auto-pilot system failed in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] crossing. This was repaired in [[Puerto Rico]].  There was a general strike in [[Panama Canal]]  causing 3 days in delays waiting to transit the [[canal]].  In the leg between [[Hawaii]] and  [[Marshall Islands]], there was a problem with the [[Common-rail injection|common rail injection]] system, which was repaired in [[Majuro]].  The crew then had their biggest setback in Palau, when ''Earthrace'' hit a submerged log a few nautical miles offshore. The vessel limped back into [[Palau]] with extensive damage. A list of problems included a bent [[Drive shaft|driveshaft]], [[propeller]] damage, smashed P-Bracket, smashed engine mounts, broken [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]], [[rudder]] damage, and a 5 meter gouge down the [[Port and starboard|starboard]] side of the composite hull. Crew determined it would be almost impossible to repair the vessel quickly in [[Palau]]. They  made temporary repairs and ran on one engine to [[Singapore]]. On arrival, the initial assessment was repairs would take at least 2 weeks, which would make the record almost impossible to get.  Marine salvage company [http://www.posh.com.sg/ Posh Semco] offered to help with haul-out, and the vessel was pulled from the water.  Crew worked around the clock for 3 days. ''Earthrace'' was put back into the water with what Captain Bethune described as "the ugliest composite repair" he'd ever seen.  Crew continued on their voyage towards their finish line in [[Spain]].
&lt;ref name="NZ Herald 2006-04-08" /&gt; Captain Bethune finished at the Spanish port of [[Sagunto]] on 27 June. The journey was completed in 60 days, 23 hours and 49 minutes, beating the former record by over two weeks.&lt;ref name="Popular Mechanics 2007-06"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.popularmechanics.co.za/content/outside/singlepage.asp?fid=871&amp;pno=1|title=Earthrace!|date=June 2007|journal=[[Popular Mechanics]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|accessdate=6 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122011707/http://www.popularmechanics.co.za/content/outside/singlepage.asp?fid=871&amp;pno=1|archivedate=22 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/06/27/earthrace-biodiesel.html|author=Irene Klotz|title=Biofuel Boat Sets Round-the-World Record|publisher=Discovery News|date=27 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010134054/http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/06/27/earthrace-biodiesel.html|archivedate=10 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Bethune later confessed the reason they missed the record on the first attempt was his leadership was poor.  He said the real difference in the second successful attempt was he did a better job in making decisions and running the team.  He also claimed his team had been outstanding in Singapore.  They had achieved a small [[miracle]] in getting ''Earthrace'' repaired so quickly, in very challenging circumstances.

==Earthrace Promotional Tour==

When ''Earthrace'' was first launched in 2006, Captain Bethune took her on a promotional tour around [[New Zealand]].  The vessel was given a Maori blessing in [[Raglan, New Zealand|Raglan]] before she left to cross the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]].  Over the next three years, the team took the boat to 186 cities around the world, opening the boat to [[school]] groups, [[public]], media, and sponsors. Through this time, over 250,000 people walked aboard the vessel.  Captain Bethune used the tour to promote awareness of alternative fuels such as biodiesel.&lt;ref name="Dominion Post 2009-04-17"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/wellington/2340570/Afloat-on-a-stylish-green-prison|title=Afloat on a stylish green prison|date=17 April 2009|work=The Dominion Post|accessdate=11 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[publicity stunt]], Bethune underwent [[liposuction]] surgery in order to convert body fat into fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Technology/Earthrace-Launches-World-Record-Attempt/Article/20071231297421?lpos=Technology_Article_Related_Content_Region_1&amp;lid=ARTICLE_1297421_Earthrace_Launches_World_Record_Attempt|title=Earthrace Launches World Record Attempt|date=18 December 2007|accessdate=12 April 2010|publisher=Sky News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A cosmetic surgeon removed around 50ml of fat from his back.  The surgeon provided a further 10 liters of human fat from 2 other patients.  Bethune converted this into 7 liters of biodiesel in his kitchen at home.  Bethune ran the fuel in his vessel, claiming the 7 liters of fuel ran the boat for an estimated 8 nautical miles.&lt;ref name="NZ Herald 2006-04-08" /&gt;

==Captain of Ady Gil==
[[File:Ady Gil 2.jpg|thumb|right|''Ady Gil'', [[Hobart]], [[Australia]], 16 December 2009.]]

After touring ports around the globe, the ''Earthrace'' was put on sale for $3&amp;nbsp;million and Captain Bethune considered using it to interfere with [[Japanese whaling]] in the [[Southern Ocean]] if a buyer could not be found.&lt;ref name="Dominion Post 2009-04-17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC 2009-06-09"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2009/06/29/2611146.htm|title=Stealth boat to take on Japanese whalers|last=Brown|first=Bill|date=9 June 2009|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood production-house owner Ady Gil purchased the boat and ''Earthrace'' was renamed after him on 17 October 2009.&lt;ref name="CMSwhale"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://features.csmonitor.com/globalnews/2009/10/29/south-park-puts-spotlight-on-paul-watson-and-his-whale-wars/|title=South Park puts spotlight on Paul Watson and his "Whale Wars"|last=Murphy|first=Dan|date=29 October 2009|publisher=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|accessdate=3 November 2009|quote=...on Oct.&amp;nbsp;17 (2009) the organisation formally unveiled it's new weapon: The Ady Gil.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gil leased the ship to [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] for $1 / year to pursue [[Japan]]ese [[Whaling|whalers]] in Antarctica.

One of the things I've learned on ''Earthrace'' is stand up for stuff you believe in. Year after year the Japanese go down there and nothing seems to change... If they want to go amping things up a bit, then bring it on."&lt;ref name="ABC 2009-06-09"/&gt; His wife later told the press that he first became alarmed by the state of the oceans when skippering the vessel during the record attempts.&lt;ref name="NZ Herald 2010-02-20"/&gt;

On 6 January 2010 the ''Ady Gil'' was involved in a collision with the Japanese whaling vessel {{MV|Shōnan Maru 2}} in the Southern Ocean when the ''Shonan Maru No 2'' hit it, and the ''Ady Gil'' was subsequently abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/172123/activists-urge-australia-to-charge-japanese-whalers|title=Activists urge Australia to charge Japanese whalers|publisher=Bangkok Post|date=19 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation into the collision by the [[Australian Maritime Safety Authority]] (AMSA)  was inconclusive in assigning blame for the collision. AMSA was unable to verify claims made by Sea Shepherd, while the Japanese government declined to participate with the investigation saying any information it had might be needed for an inquiry by its own authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/inquiry-into-ady-gil-crash-inconclusive-20100508-ukx4.html|title=Inquiry into Ady Gil crash inconclusive|publisher=News.smh.com.au|date=8 May 2010|accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However [[Maritime New Zealand]] investigators released a report that the ''Ady Gil'' was the stand on vessel and had right of way.  The ''Shonan Maru No 2'' was the port side vessel, and the overtaking vessel, and under both circumstances, had an obligation to keep well clear of the Ady Gil.  The report did conclude however that the captains of both the ''Ady Gil'' and the whaler, the ''Shonan Maru No 2'', "were partly responsible for either contributing  to, or failing to respond to the 'close quarters' situation that led to the [[collision]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/adygil/#media&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest, trial, and conviction==

On 15 February 2010 in the middle of the night, Captain Bethune attempted to board the ''Shōnan Maru 2'' from a jet ski.  On his first attempt he fell into the water, and was recovered by his Engineer, Larry Routledge a few minutes later.  On his second attempt, Captain Bethune managed to climb between the anti-boarding spikes and onto the side of the hull, where he then cut through the protective netting and clambered aboard. The purpose of the boarding was to conduct a [[citizen's arrest]] on her captain, Hiroyuki Komiya, alleging attempted murder, and to present a claim for $3 million for the ramming of his vessel. Captain Bethune was not successful in arresting Komiya, nor did he receive any compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/whale-watch/tokyos-angry-reception-for-antiwhaling-activist-20100312-q46s.html|title=Tokyo's angry reception for anti-whaling activist|author=Robin Powell|date=13 March 2010|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/04/02/2863179.htm?section=justin|title=Brown wants Australia to retaliate in whaling furore|author=Willacy, Mark|date=2 April 2010|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Bethune was successful however in getting taken to Japan to face charges, which he hoped would increase public awareness of Japanese whaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Vendetta|series=[[Whale Wars]]|network=[[Animal Planet]]|season=3|number=12|airdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's [[Institute of Cetacean Research]] issued a statement calling it a publicity stunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/protester-boards-japanese-whaling-vessel-20100215-o11t.html|title=Protester boards Japanese whaling vessel|last=Alexander|first=Cathy|date=15 February 2010|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was detained by the ship's crew and taken to [[Tokyo]], where he was arrested by the [[Japanese Coast Guard]] on 12 March on charges of trespassing.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Japan indicts anti-whaling activist|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/04/02/japan.activist.indicted/index.html|work=|publisher=CNN|date=3 April 2010|accessdate=3 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Japan charges New Zealand whaling activist Pete Bethune |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8600458.stm|work=|publisher=BBC|date=3 April 2010|accessdate=3 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Japanese Coast Guard Arrests Anti-Whaling Skipper|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/world/asia/13whale.html| work=The New York Times|date=12 March 2010|accessdate=12 March 2010 | first1=Martin | last1=Fackler | first2=Mark | last2=McDonald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Lateline|series=[[Lateline]]|credits=[[Leigh Sales]]|network=[[ABC1]]|airdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July, Pete Bethune was convicted of disruption of business, destruction of property, boarding a vessel without due cause, assault and possession of a knife without due cause&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/07/peter-bethune-sea-shepherd-sentence|title=Sea Shepherd man sentenced for whaler assault|last=McCurry|first=Justin|date=7 July 2010|work=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and given a two-year suspended sentence.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_3632066"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/bethune-gets-suspended-sentence-3632066 |title=Japan deports Kiwi whaling protester |date=7 July 2010 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100703a6.html Bethune writing book about activism]", ''-[[Japan Times]]'', 3 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bethune was deported to New Zealand on 9 July.. Bethune held a press conference upon returning to New Zealand. He told reporters: "My trial in Japan represents a miscarriage in justice. Not because I stood before that court, but because the captain of the ''Shōnan Maru 2'' did not."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bethune calls Japanese trial miscarriage of justice; blasts NZ gov't|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/crime/view/bethune-calls-japanese-trial-miscarriage-of-justice-blasts-nz-govt|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Japan Today|date=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also called the New Zealand Government a "lap dog"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bethune slams Govt as 'lap dog'|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Bethune-slams-Govt-as-lap-dog/tabid/1160/articleID/165392/Default.aspx#top|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=3 News|date=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for what he considered a lack of backbone in standing up to Japan over whaling.

==Disassociation from Sea Shepherd==
Captain Bethune disassociated himself from Sea Shepherd by posting an open letter on his Facebook page on 4 October 2010, condemning the organization and its leader Paul Watson as "dishonest" and "morally bankrupt". According to his letter, he was directed by Paul Watson to sink the ''Ady Gil'' deliberately for PR purposes after the collision with the Japanese whaling ship. He insists that the senior members of Sea Shepherd regularly lie and conspire over the serious matters, detailing many cases in his letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Bethune-quits-Sea-Shepherd-over-lies/tabid/1160/articleID/180068/Default.aspx|author=Speedy, Juliet|title=Bethune quits Sea Shepherd over lies|publisher=3 News|date=6 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation|last=Bethune|first=Pete|title=My alleged suing of Sea Shepherd for $500,000|date=22 November 2011|url=https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150465988955867|accessdate=23 March 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Based largely on testimony from Captain Bethune and former Sea Shepherd Bob Barker Captain, Chuck Swift, Ady Gil successfully sued Sea Shepherd for the deliberate abandonment of his vessel in Antarctica.  In siding will Mr. Gil, the arbitrator awarded him compensatory damages of $500,000 plus interest from January 8, 2010 forward.

In characterizing testimony for the suit, the arbitrator was particularly harsh on Paul Watson; finding the Sea Shepherd founder in some instances to "be highly evasive, internally contradictory, or at odds with his own prior written statements, and in certain areas simply lacking the basic indicia of genuineness that instinctively inspires confidence and trust."&lt;ref name="ecorazzi.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Judge-rules sea shepherd wrongfully sank whale wars vessel|url=http://www.ecorazzi.com/2015/09/25/judge-rules-sea-shepherd-wrongfully-sank-whale-wars-vessel/|website=Ecorazzi|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for Gil, the arbitrator stated his "testimony appeared genuine in intent if somewhat fuzzy in detail, and perhaps colored in hindsight by strong emotions of betrayal on the part of those in whom he had placed a perhaps naïve degree of trust."&lt;ref name="ecorazzi.com"/&gt;

==Earthrace Conservation==
Captain Bethune founded his own [[Conservation biology|conservation]] organization in 2011, Earthrace Conservation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthraceconservation.org/ Earthrace Conservation Homepage].&lt;/ref&gt; and he assists government agencies with [[Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing|Illegal Fishing]], [[Wildlife]] [[Poaching]] and other [[Environmental crime|Environmental Crimes]].  It has [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] or [[Charitable organization|charity]] status in [[New Zealand]], [[United States|USA]] and [[United Kingdom|UK]].  He also has a Television Show "[[The Operatives]]" that follows his team's work.  Captain Bethune employs former military personnel that undertake the missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earthraceconservation.org/about-earthrace-conservation/|title=About Earthrace Conservation and how it works, so you can be involved, donate, sponsor.|website=earthraceconservation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2013, Captain Bethune was running fisheries patrols in the [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]] region of [[Costa Rica]].  His team had been flying a Skylark [[military]] [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|drone]] at night over the surrounding waters when they detected a vessel the ''Amelita'', allegedly fishing inside a [[Marine protected area|Marine Protected Areas]].  Bethune launched his patrol boat from shore and approached the ''Amelita''.  The team covertly filmed the ''Amelita'' engaged in ''shrimp trawling,'' following her for 7 hours.  On daybreak, crew of the ''Amelita'' pulled in their trawl nets.  Bethune boarded the vessel, filmed the catch, and interviewed the Captain, who claimed to be the President of the Commercial Fisherman's Association in [[Puntarenas]]. Bethune handed the evidence over to a local NGO and [[Costa Rica]]n [[Authority|authorities]] who [[Prosecutor|prosecuted]] the [[Captain]].  Bethune traveled back to Costs Rica in 2015 to provide additional evidence in the [[court case]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earthraceconservation.org/the-curse-of-illegal-fishing-mission-pirata/|title=THE CURSE OF ILLEGAL FISHING - MISSION PIRATA - Earthrace Conservation|website=earthraceconservation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another fishery patrol mission in [[Costa Rica]], Bethune and a crew of 4 took their 7.7m ''Sealegs'' vessel 300 nautical miles offshore to [[Cocos Island]]. The voyage was expected to take just 24 hours, but due to mechanical issues, fuel problems and bad weather, ended up at 72 hours.  Bethune later claimed "5 broken men arrived on Cocos Island".  Several days later on night patrols near the island, Bethune was able to film 7 boats allegedly involved in [[shark finning]] activities inside the [[Cocos Island]] [[Marine protected area|Marine Protected Area]].  Evidence of the [[Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing|illegal]] [[fishing]] was handed over to Authorities who prosecuted Captains of the 7 vessels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2017, Captain Bethune was in the [[Philippines]] training local [[Fishery|fisheries]] [[enforcement]] teams consisting of personnel from [[Navy]] [[special forces]], [[Ministry of Fisheries]] (BFAR) and local [[police]] ([[Bantay Dagat|bantay dagat]]).  While on patrols at night on 26 May, they came across a [[Seine fishing|Danish Seine]] [[Trawler (fishing)|trawler]] the "Dan Israel R", allegedly fishing inside [[Municipality|municipal]] waters.  Danish Seine is a form of destructive [[bottom trawling]] [[Ban (law)|banned]] in the [[Philippines]].  Crew of the ''Dan Israel R'' were arrested and the vessel escorted into the BFAR impound facility in [[Cavite]].  The vessel was one of 23 in a so-called Alphabet fleet.  Owners of the vessel subsequently made a cash offer of 2 million pesos to settle the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earthraceconservation.org/earthrace-helps-capture-pirate-fishing-vessel/|title=Earthrace helps capture Pirate Fishing Vessel - Earthrace Conservation|website=earthraceconservation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Operatives==
In 2011 Captain Bethune formed a team of military veterans and specialist civilians to catch and prosecute environmental criminals.  This led to the development of ''The Operatives'' TV Series, which so far has run for two seasons and aired in over 90 countries.  Units represented in the team included former US Navy [[SEAL Team Six|SEAL Team 6]] and [[SEAL Team 2|2]], [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance|US Marine Recon]], [[United States Army Rangers|US Army Ranger]], [[1st Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment|French 1er]] regiment ([[Special Air Service|SAS]]) and New Zealand [[Paratrooper]].  Each episode involves Captain Bethune and his team examining some form of environmental criminal activity working alongside existing law enforcement units. 18 episodes have been filmed dealing with issues such as [[shark finning]], [[illegal logging]], [[marine protected area]], [[illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing|IUU FIshing,]] [[wildlife smuggling]], [[blast fishing]], [[cyanide fishing]], [[seal hunting]] and [[wildlife]] [[poaching]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3990638/The Operatives] ''Internet Movie Database''. Accessed 21 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, Captain Bethune and Jack Waldron, a former [[New Zealand]] [[Paratrooper]], entered a [[De Beers|De Beers Diamond]] Mine near [[Lüderitz|Luderitz]] in [[Namibia]].  They were dropped a mile offshore at night by a [[Zodiac Nautic|zodiac]], and swam ashore into the mine area.  Over the next four days, Captain Bethune and Waldon avoided security patrols while trying to film the government sanctioned seal clubbing.  On the final day, Captain Bethune is hiding in a [[Ghillie suit|gillie suit]] about 50 meters from where a group of seal clubbers have assembled.  He films the clubbing of around 500 baby seals.  The two men by now are out of food and water, and bad weather prevents them from being picked up by zodiac.  They end up hiking out of the diamond mine at night.  The video has since been used by various [[animal rights]] and [[Conservation biology|conservation]] groups including [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earthraceconservation.org/clubbings-no-adventure-say-80000-seals/|title=Clubbing's No Adventure Say 80,000 Seals - Earthrace Conservation|website=earthraceconservation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also used in the first episode of ''The Operatives'' TV Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Pete Bethune|title=Death in the Diamond Mine - Captain's VLOG 01|date=2014-08-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ufHbeyUPk&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Captain Bethune presented a 200,000 strong petition to Jake Jacobs, Secretary of the Namibian National Assembly, asking the government to abandon the seal clubbing industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.energy100fm.com/?q=content/seal-hunting-activists-handover-petition-na|title=Seal Hunting Activists Hand Over Petitioon|last=Berthune|first=Pete|date=23 Sep 2015|website=100 Energy FM|archive-url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pete_Bethune&amp;action=edit|archive-date=23 Sep 2015|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Captain Bethune assembled his team in [[Costa Rica]] and they ran several missions targeting [[Illegal mining|illegal]] [[gold mining]] in the [[Corcovado National Park]], training and working alongside the [[government]] [[Ministry of Environment, Energy and Telecommunications|MINAE]] forces.  Rangers claimed the gold miners were destructive by killing and [[eating]] [[endangered wildlife]], causing extensive [[erosion]] along creek and river beds, and using [[cyanide]] [[poison]] to separate [[gold]] from the [[silt]].  Jack Waldron gathers aerial intelligence by flying a [[Powered paragliding|paramotor]] over the jungle, locating multiple areas of interest. The full team is inserted into the jungle by rappelling from a Bell UH1H helicopter.  The campaign led to a number of successful prosecutions and 2 illegal gold mining operations were closed down.  There were 2 cases of gunshots being fired at the Rangers by fleeing gold miners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Pete Bethune|title=Jungle Gold Robbers - Captain's VLOG 03|date=2014-08-31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkUrCg1lpsg&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1222">A '''semi-synchronous orbit''' is an [[orbit]] with a [[orbital period|period]] equal to half the average [[rotational period]] of the body being orbited, and in the same direction as that body's rotation.

For [[Earth]], a semi-synchronous orbit is considered a [[medium Earth orbit]], with a period of just under 12 hours. For circular Earth orbits, the [[altitude]] is approximately {{convert|20200|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | title = NASA Technical Standard 8719.14 (draft) | publisher = NASA Orbital Debris Program Office | date = 8 Aug 2006 | url = http://www.orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/references.html/ | format = PDF | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060823194932/http://www.orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/references.html | archivedate = 2006-08-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalog of Earth Satellite Orbits|date=6 Sep 2012 | url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/OrbitsCatalog/page2.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shola.jpg|thumb|500x500px|Sholas in southern [[western ghats]]. These are the [[Montane grasslands and shrublands|tropical and sub-tropical
 montane forest]].]]

'''Sholas''' are the local name for patches of stunted [[Montane grasslands and shrublands|tropical montane forest]] found in valleys amid rolling grassland in the higher montane regions of [[South India]]. These patches of shola forest are found mainly in the valleys and are usually separated from one another by undulating [[montane grassland]]. The shola and grassland together form the shola-grassland complex or mosaic. The word 'Shola' is probably derived from the [[Tamil language]] word c&lt;small&gt;Õ&lt;/small&gt;lai (சோலை) meaning [[Grove (nature)|grove]].&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;{{citation |url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/romadict.pl?query=சோலை&amp;searchhws=yes&amp;table=fabricius |title= J. P. Fabricius's Tamil and English dictionary. 4th ed., rev. and enl.|author=Fabricius, Johann Philipp|publisher=Evangelical Lutheran Mission Pub. House |year=1972 |page=457 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shola-forest and grassland complex has been described as a climatic [[climax vegetation]] with forest regeneration and expansion restricted by climatic conditions such as frost or soil characteristics while others have suggested that it may have anthropogenic origins in the burning and removal of forests by early herders and shifting agriculturists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Phytogeography of the South Indian Hill Stations| author=Meher-Homji VM| journal= Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club| volume=94| issue=4| year=1997| pages= 230–242| doi=10.2307/2483901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and origin==
[[File:Brahmagirishola.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Shola forest interspersed in valleys among high altitude grasslands on the [[Brahmagiri (hill)|Brahmagiri Hills]]]]

Shola forests are found in the higher altitude hill regions of the Nilgiris, Palni hills, Anamalai hills, Megamalai,Agasthyamalai, Kerala High Ranges [[Idukki district]], the [[Western Ghats]] and associated ranges in the states of [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]. Although generally said to occur above 2000 meters above sea level, shola forests can be found at 1600 meters elevation in many hill ranges (e.g. [[Biligiriranga Hills]]).

The origin of the shola forest and grassland complex has been the subject of scientific debate. Some early researchers suggested that the floristic composition represents a stable final state or climax vegetation. This stability being maintained by climatic conditions such as frost which allow the grass to grow but kill off any forest seedlings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ranganathan, C. R. |year= 1938| title= Studies in the ecology of the shola grass-land vegetation of the Nilgiri Plateau| journal= Indian Forester |volume= 64|pages=523–541}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have suggested that the grassland may have been created and maintained by early pastoralists and point out that fire has a major role in the maintenance of the grassland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Bor, N. L. |year=1938|title= The vegetation of the Nilgiris| journal= Indian Forester
|volume=64|pages=600–609}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence for both and several features of the forest trees and the grasslands have been considered and debated. Pollen analysis from bogs in the Nilgiris suggest that the complex of grassland and forest existed 35,000 years ago, long before human impact began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal= Géographie physique et Quaternaire| year= 1997| volume= 51| issue= 3|pages=415–426| title=Etude palynologique d'un nouveau sondage dans les marai de Sandynallah (Massif des Nilgiri, Sud-ouest de L'Inde)|author1=Sutra, J-P |author2=R Bonnefille |author3=M.

==Fauna==
Due to their isolation,  altitude and evergreen character, shola forests are home to many [[threatened]] and [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] [[species]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Some of the species found here have close relatives only in the distant evergreen forests of [[Northeast India]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Some others are found nowhere else in the world.
[[File:Shola flower.jpg|thumb|''[[Exacum]] bicolor'', a shola grassland plant]]
The [[Western Ghats]] are one of the globally recognized [[biodiversity hotspot]]s. Among the many larger animals inhabiting a shola-grassland mosaic are [[tiger]]s and [[leopard]]s, [[Asian elephant|elephant]]s and [[gaur]]. The endangered [[Nilgiri tahr]] (an Asian goat-antelope) is endemic to the shola-grassland, and its range is now restricted to a 400-km stretch of shola-grassland mosaic, from the [[Nilgiri Hills]] to the [[Agasthyamalai Hills]].&lt;ref&gt;Misra &amp; Johnsingh 1998&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laughingthrush]]es, [[Nilgiri woodpigeon]]s, [[Shortwing (bird)|shortwing]]s, and some of the endemic flycatchers (black-and-orange and Nilgiri verditer) are some of the 300+ species of birds that inhabit this area. The area shows high endemicity and is rivalled only by the forests in northeast India; 35 percent of the plants, 42 percent of the [[fish]]es, 48 percent of the [[reptile]]s, and 75 percent of the [[amphibian]]s that live in these rain forests are endemic species.&lt;ref&gt;Govt. of India 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- govt of india cannot can be a reliable source, need scientific journal citations - also a lot of comments related to W Ghats rather than sholas --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Flora ==
At least 25 types of trees are present in the major sholas of the [[Nilgiri Hills]].&lt;ref name="Premalatha S. 2009"&gt;Premalatha S., Sanil R. &amp; Franklin Charles Jose. 2009. Shola trees in the upper Nilgiris of Western Ghats. ''Journal of Basic &amp; Applied Biology'' 3(3&amp;4),97-102.&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant trees in this type of forest are ''[[Michelia#Michelia species|Michelia niligarica]]'', ''[[Bischofia javanica]]'' (bishop wood), ''Calophyllum tomentosa'', ''[[Cedrela toona]]'' (Indian mahogany), ''[[Eugenia]]'' (myrtle) spp., ''[[Ficus glomerata]]'' (atti or cluster fig tree or gular fig tree) and ''[[Mallotus (plant)|Mallotus]]'' spp. Shola forests have an upper storey of small trees, generally ''Pygeum gardneri'', ''[[Schefflera]] racemosa'', ''[[Linociera]] ramiflora'', ''[[Syzygium]]'' spp., ''[[Rhododendron#Species|Rhododendron nilgiricum]]'', ''[[Mahonia]] nepalensis'', ''[[Elaeocarpus]] recurvatus'', ''[[Ilex]] denticulata'', ''[[Michelia]] nilagirica'', ''[[Actinodaphne]] bourdellonii'', and ''[[Litsea]] wightiana''. Below the upper story is a low understory and a dense shrub layer. There is a thick concentration of mosses growing on the understory and many ferns in the sunlit narrow transition to grassland.

Shola forests are interspersed with [[montane grassland]]s, characterized by frost- and fire-resistant [[grass]] species like ''Chrysopogon zeylanicus'', ''Cymbopogon flexuosus'', ''Arundinella ciliata'', ''Arundinella mesophylla'', ''Arundinella tuberculata'', ''Themeda tremula'', and ''Sehima nervosum''.

==Threats==
Invasive [[Introduced species]] are a serious threat to this high altitude ecosystem. Some, like [[Acacia mearnsii]] and [[Eucalyptus globulus]] are the consequence of commercial plantation and afforestation drives. Other threatening invasives include [[Lantana camara]] and [[Ageratina adenophora]].&lt;ref name="  "&gt;

'''Silicone foam''' is a [[synthetic rubber]] product used in [[gasket]]ing, sheets and [[firestop]]s. It is available in solid, cured form as well as in individual liquid components for field installations.

==Uses==
*[[Gasket]]s
*Sheets
*High temperature tubes for [[autoclave]]s
*[[Firestop]]s
*[[Surfactant]]s

==Vulcanisation==
When the constituent components of silicone foam are mixed together, they evolve [[hydrogen]] gas, which causes bubbles to form within the rubber, as it changes from liquid to solid. This results in an outward pressure. Temperature and humidity can influence the rate of expansion.

A '''spill pallet''' is a [[Bunding|bunded]] secondary containment item that is designed to hold containers of [[oil]] and [[fuel]]s, typically in either a {{convert|205|L|impgal USgal|adj=on}} [[drum]] or in an [[intermediate bulk container]]. It is called a 'secondary containment item' because it is designed to catch the leaks and spill of the container's contents which rest upon it.

The spill pallets can come in a variety of sizes to accommodate multiple containers.

==UK Legislation==
In the UK, a container of oil or fuel cannot be stored outside unless it is bundled in a secondary containment item (Oil Storage Regulations 2001). This means that if the container of oil leaks, it will be contained within the [[Bunding|bund]]. The secondary containment item must be able to hold 110% of the largest container above.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/oil/default.aspx For further information on Legislation and Regulations]&lt;/ref&gt;

If a person were to store 4 x 205-litre drums on the sump pallet, the sump pallet must be able to hold {{convert|225.5|L|impgal USgal}} of oil.

Although there are no laws in the UK stating that a sump pallet must hold 110% of the largest container upon it, it is still considered good practice to do so.

==Materials==
Sump pallets can be made in a variety of materials, but due to the nature of the oils or chemicals which will be stored upon it, they are typically made from either [[Stabilizers for polymers|UV stabilised]] [[polyethylene]], or [[steel]] that is [[galvanised]] for further protection from harsher chemicals. Also available in stainless and mild steels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dolphinmea.com/spill-pallets-uae.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Superconductivity''' is a phenomenon of exactly zero [[Electrical resistance and conductance|electrical resistance]] and expulsion of [[magnetic field|magnetic flux fields]] occurring in certain materials, called '''superconductors''', when [[:wikt:cooling|cooled]] below a characteristic [[Phase transition|critical temperature]]. It was discovered by Dutch physicist [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] on April&amp;nbsp;8, 1911, in [[Leiden]]. Like [[ferromagnetism]] and [[atomic spectral line]]s, superconductivity is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] phenomenon. It is characterized by the [[Meissner effect]], the complete ejection of [[magnetic field|magnetic field lines]] from the interior of the superconductor during its transitions into the superconducting state. The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the [[Idealization (science philosophy)|idealization]] of ''[[perfect conductor|perfect conductivity]]'' in [[classical physics]].

The electrical resistance of a metallic [[electrical conductor|conductor]] decreases gradually as temperature is lowered. In ordinary conductors, such as [[copper]] or [[silver]], this decrease is limited by impurities and other defects. Even near [[absolute zero]], a real sample of a normal conductor shows some resistance. In a superconductor, the resistance drops abruptly to zero when the material is cooled below its critical temperature. An [[electric current]] through a loop of [[superconducting wire]] can persist indefinitely with no power source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The cheaply-available coolant [[liquid nitrogen]] boils at 77&amp;nbsp;K, and thus superconduction at higher temperatures than this facilitates many experiments and applications that are less practical at lower temperatures.

== Classification ==
{{Main|Superconductor classification}}
There are many criteria by which superconductors are classified. The most common are:

=== Response to a magnetic field ===
A superconductor can be ''[[Type I superconductor|Type&amp;nbsp;I]]'', meaning it has a single [[critical field]], above which all superconductivity is lost and below which the magnetic field is completely expelled from the superconductor; or ''[[Type II superconductor|Type&amp;nbsp;II]]'', meaning it has two critical fields, between which it allows partial penetration of the magnetic field through isolated points. These points are called [[Quantum vortex|vortices]]. Furthermore, in multicomponent superconductors it is possible to have combination of the two behaviours. In that case the superconductor is of [[Type-1.5 superconductor|Type-1.5]].

=== By theory of operation ===
It is ''[[conventional superconductor|conventional]]'' if it can be explained by the [[BCS theory]] or its derivatives, or ''[[unconventional superconductor|unconventional]]'', otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibney|first=Elizabeth|author-link=Elizabeth Gibney|date=5 March 2018|title=Surprise graphene discovery could unlock secrets of superconductivity|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02773-w|department=News|journal=Nature|volume=555|issue=7695|pages=151&amp;ndash;2|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-02773-w|pmid=29517044|quote=Superconductors come broadly in two types: conventional, in which the activity can be explained by the mainstream theory of superconductivity, and unconventional, where it can’t.|via=|bibcode=2018Natur.555..151G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By critical temperature ===
A superconductor is generally considered ''[[high-temperature superconductivity|high-temperature]]'' if it reaches a superconducting state when cooled using [[liquid nitrogen]] – that is, at only ''T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 77&amp;nbsp;K) – or ''low-temperature'' if more aggressive cooling techniques are required to reach its critical temperature.

=== By material ===
Superconductor material classes include [[chemical element]]s (e.g. [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[lead]]), [[alloy]]s (such as [[niobium-titanium]], [[germanium-niobium]], and [[niobium nitride]]), [[ceramic]]s ([[YBCO]] and [[magnesium diboride]]), [[Iron-based superconductor|superconducting pnictides]] (like fluorine-doped LaOFeAs) or [[organic superconductor]]s ([[fullerene]]s and [[carbon nanotube]]s; though perhaps these examples should be included among the chemical elements, as they are composed entirely of [[carbon]]).

== Elementary properties of superconductors ==
{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}&lt;!--many paragraphs have no citations--&gt;
Most of the physical properties of superconductors vary from material to material, such as the [[heat capacity]] and the critical temperature, critical field, and critical current density at which superconductivity is destroyed.

On the other hand, there is a class of properties that are independent of the underlying material. For instance, all superconductors have ''exactly'' zero resistivity to low applied currents when there is no magnetic field present or if the applied field does not exceed a critical value. The existence of these "universal" properties implies that superconductivity is a [[phase (matter)|thermodynamic phase]], and thus possesses certain distinguishing properties which are largely independent of microscopic details.

=== Zero electrical DC resistance ===
[[File:CERN-cables-p1030764.jpg|thumb|Electric cables for accelerators at [[CERN]]. Both the massive and slim cables are rated for 12,500 [[amperes|A]]. ''Top:'' regular cables for [[LEP]]; ''bottom:'' superconductor-based cables for the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]]]]
[[File:Cross section of preform superconductor cable.jpg|thumb|Cross section of a preform superconductor rod from abandoned [[Superconducting Super Collider|Texas Superconducting Super Collider (SSC)]].]]
The simplest method to measure the [[electrical resistance]] of a sample of some material is to place it in an [[electrical circuit]] in series with a [[current source]] ''I'' and measure the resulting [[voltage]] ''V'' across the sample. The resistance of the sample is given by [[Ohm's law]] as ''R&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;V&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;I''. If the voltage is zero, this means that the resistance is zero.

Superconductors are also able to maintain a current with no applied voltage whatsoever, a property exploited in [[Superconducting magnet|superconducting electromagnets]] such as those found in [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] machines. Experiments have demonstrated that currents in superconducting coils can persist for years without any measurable degradation. Experimental evidence points to a current lifetime of at least 100,000 years.

In a normal conductor, an electric current may be visualized as a fluid of [[electron]]s moving across a heavy [[ion]]ic lattice. The electrons are constantly colliding with the ions in the lattice, and during each collision some of the [[energy]] carried by the current is absorbed by the lattice and converted into [[heat]], which is essentially the vibrational [[kinetic energy]] of the lattice ions. As a result, the energy carried by the current is constantly being dissipated. This is the phenomenon of electrical resistance and [[Joule heating]].

The situation is different in a superconductor. In a conventional superconductor, the electronic fluid cannot be resolved into individual electrons. Instead, it consists of bound ''pairs'' of electrons known as [[Cooper pair]]s. This pairing is caused by an attractive force between electrons from the exchange of [[phonon]]s. Due to [[quantum mechanics]], the [[energy spectrum]] of this Cooper pair fluid possesses an ''[[energy gap]]'', meaning there is a minimum amount of energy Δ''E'' that must be supplied in order to excite the fluid. Therefore, if Δ''E'' is larger than the [[thermal energy]] of the lattice, given by ''kT'', where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]] and ''T'' is the [[temperature]], the fluid will not be scattered by the lattice. The Cooper pair fluid is thus a [[superfluid]], meaning it can flow without energy dissipation.

In a class of superconductors known as [[type II superconductor]]s, including all known [[high-temperature superconductor]]s, an extremely low but nonzero resistivity appears at temperatures not too far below the nominal superconducting transition when an electric current is applied in conjunction with a strong magnetic field, which may be caused by the electric current. This is due to the motion of [[Abrikosov vortex|magnetic vortices]] in the electronic superfluid, which dissipates some of the energy carried by the current. If the current is sufficiently small, the vortices are stationary, and the resistivity vanishes. The resistance due to this effect is tiny compared with that of non-superconducting materials, but must be taken into account in sensitive experiments. However, as the temperature decreases far enough below the nominal superconducting transition, these vortices can become frozen into a disordered but stationary phase known as a "vortex glass". Below this vortex glass transition temperature, the resistance of the material becomes truly zero.

===  Phase transition {{anchor|Superconducting phase transition}} ===
[[File:Cvandrhovst.png|thumb|400px|Behavior of heat capacity (c&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, blue) and resistivity (ρ, green) at the superconducting phase transition]]

In superconducting materials, the characteristics of superconductivity appear when the [[temperature]] ''T'' is lowered below a critical temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. The value of this critical temperature varies from material to material. Conventional superconductors usually have critical temperatures ranging from around 20&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] to less than 1&amp;nbsp;K. Solid [[mercury (element)|mercury]], for example, has a critical temperature of 4.2&amp;nbsp;K. As of 2015, the highest critical temperature found for a conventional superconductor is 203K for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, although high pressures of approximately 90 gigapascals were required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drozdov|first1=A|last2=Eremets|first2=M|last3=Troyan|first3=I|last4=Ksenofontov|first4=V|title=Conventional superconductivity at 203 kelvin at high pressures in the sulfur hydride system|journal=Nature|date=17 August 2015|volume=525|issue=2–3|pages=73–76|doi=10.1038/nature14964|pmid=11369082|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14964|arxiv=1506.08190|bibcode=2015Natur.525...73D}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cuprate superconductor]]s can have much higher critical temperatures: [[YBCO|YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]], one of the first cuprate superconductors to be discovered, has a critical temperature of 92&amp;nbsp;K, and mercury-based cuprates have been found with critical temperatures in excess of 130&amp;nbsp;K. The explanation for these high critical temperatures remains unknown. Electron pairing due to [[phonon]] exchanges explains superconductivity in conventional superconductors, but it does not explain superconductivity in the newer superconductors that have a very high critical temperature.

Similarly, at a fixed temperature below the critical temperature, superconducting materials cease to superconduct when an external [[magnetic field]] is applied which is greater than the ''critical magnetic field''. This is because the [[Gibbs free energy]] of the superconducting phase increases quadratically with the magnetic field while the free energy of the normal phase is roughly independent of the magnetic field. If the material superconducts in the absence of a field, then the superconducting phase free energy is lower than that of the normal phase and so for some finite value of the magnetic field (proportional to the square root of the difference of the free energies at zero magnetic field) the two free energies will be equal and a phase transition to the normal phase will occur. More generally, a higher temperature and a stronger magnetic field lead to a smaller fraction of electrons that are superconducting and consequently to a longer [[London penetration depth]] of external magnetic fields and currents. The penetration depth becomes infinite at the phase transition.

The onset of superconductivity is accompanied by abrupt changes in various physical properties, which is the hallmark of a [[phase transition]]. For example, the electronic [[heat capacity]] is proportional to the temperature in the normal (non-superconducting) regime. At the superconducting transition, it suffers a discontinuous jump and thereafter ceases to be linear. At low temperatures, it varies instead as ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−α/''T''&lt;/sup&gt; for some constant, α. This exponential behavior is one of the pieces of evidence for the existence of the [[energy gap]].

The [[Second-order transition|order]] of the superconducting phase transition was long a matter of debate. Experiments indicate that the transition is second-order, meaning there is no [[latent heat]]. However, in the presence of an external magnetic field there is latent heat, because the superconducting phase has a lower entropy below the critical temperature than the normal phase. It has been experimentally demonstrated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Calculations in the 1970s suggested that it may actually be weakly first-order due to the effect of long-range fluctuations in the electromagnetic field. In the 1980s it was shown theoretically with the help of a [[disorder field|disorder field theory]], in which the [[vortex line]]s of the superconductor play a major role, that the transition is of second order within the [[Type II superconductor|type II]] regime and of first order (i.e., [[latent heat]]) within the [[Type I superconductor|type I]] regime, and that the two regions are separated by a [[tricritical point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Meissner effect ===
{{Main|Meissner effect}}
When a superconductor is placed in a weak external [[magnetic field]] '''H''', and cooled below its transition temperature, the magnetic field is ejected. The Meissner effect does not cause the field to be completely ejected but instead the field penetrates the superconductor but only to a very small distance, characterized by a parameter&amp;nbsp;''λ'', called the [[London penetration depth]], decaying exponentially to zero within the bulk of the material. The [[Meissner effect]] is a defining characteristic of superconductivity. For most superconductors, the London penetration depth is on the order of 100&amp;nbsp;nm.

The Meissner effect is sometimes confused with the kind of [[diamagnetism]] one would expect in a perfect electrical conductor: according to [[Lenz's law]], when a ''changing'' magnetic field is applied to a conductor, it will induce an electric current in the conductor that creates an opposing magnetic field. In a perfect conductor, an arbitrarily large current can be induced, and the resulting magnetic field exactly cancels the applied field.

The Meissner effect is distinct from this—it is the spontaneous expulsion which occurs during transition to superconductivity. Suppose we have a material in its normal state, containing a constant internal magnetic field. When the material is cooled below the critical temperature, we would observe the abrupt expulsion of the internal magnetic field, which we would not expect based on Lenz's law.

The Meissner effect was given a phenomenological explanation by the brothers [[Fritz London|Fritz]] and [[Heinz London]], who showed that the electromagnetic [[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] in a superconductor is minimized provided

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla^2\mathbf{H} = \lambda^{-2} \mathbf{H}\, &lt;/math&gt;

where '''H''' is the magnetic field and λ is the [[London penetration depth]].

This equation, which is known as the [[London equation]], predicts that the magnetic field in a superconductor [[exponential decay|decays exponentially]] from whatever value it possesses at the surface.

A superconductor with little or no magnetic field within it is said to be in the Meissner state. The Meissner state breaks down when the applied magnetic field is too large. Superconductors can be divided into two classes according to how this breakdown occurs. In [[Type I superconductor]]s, superconductivity is abruptly destroyed when the strength of the applied field rises above a critical value ''H&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''. Depending on the geometry of the sample, one may obtain an intermediate state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In [[Type II superconductor]]s, raising the applied field past a critical value ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''c''1&lt;/sub&gt; leads to a mixed state (also known as the vortex state) in which an increasing amount of [[magnetic flux]] penetrates the material, but there remains no resistance to the flow of electric current as long as the current is not too large. At a second critical field strength ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''c''2&lt;/sub&gt;, superconductivity is destroyed. The mixed state is actually caused by vortices in the electronic superfluid, sometimes called [[fluxon]]s because the flux carried by these vortices is [[quantum|quantized]]. Most pure [[chemical element|elemental]] superconductors, except [[niobium]] and [[carbon nanotube]]s, are Type&amp;nbsp;I, while almost all impure and compound superconductors are Type&amp;nbsp;II.

=== London moment ===
Conversely, a spinning superconductor generates a magnetic field, precisely aligned with the spin axis. The effect, the [[London moment]], was put to good use in [[Gravity Probe B|Gravity Probe&amp;nbsp;B]]. This experiment measured the magnetic fields of four superconducting gyroscopes to determine their spin axes. This was critical to the experiment since it is one of the few ways to accurately determine the spin axis of an otherwise featureless sphere.

{{Main|History of superconductivity}}

Superconductivity was discovered on April 8, 1911 by [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]], who was studying the resistance of solid [[mercury (element)|mercury]] at [[cryogenic]] temperatures using the recently produced [[liquid helium]] as a [[refrigerant]]. At the temperature of 4.2&amp;nbsp;K, he observed that the resistance abruptly disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same experiment, he also observed the [[superfluid]] transition of helium at 2.2&amp;nbsp;K, without recognizing its significance. The precise date and circumstances of the discovery were only reconstructed a century later, when Onnes's notebook was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =   Dirk vanDelft &amp; Peter Kes | date = September 2010 | journal = Physics Today | url = http://ilorentz.org/history/cold/DelftKes_HKO_PT.pdf | title = The Discovery of Superconductivity | doi=10.1063/1.3490499 | volume=63 | issue = 9 | pages=38–43|bibcode = 2010PhT....63i..38V }}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent decades, superconductivity was observed in several other materials. In 1913, [[lead]] was found to superconduct at 7&amp;nbsp;K, and in 1941 [[niobium nitride]] was found to superconduct at 16&amp;nbsp;K.

Great efforts have been devoted to finding out how and why superconductivity works; the important step occurred in 1933, when [[Walter Meissner|Meissner]] and [[Robert Ochsenfeld|Ochsenfeld]] discovered that superconductors expelled applied magnetic fields, a phenomenon which has come to be known as the [[Meissner effect]].&lt;ref name=MeissnerOchsenfeld&gt;{{cite journal

=== London theory ===
The first phenomenological theory of superconductivity was [[London equations|London theory]]. It was put forward by the brothers Fritz and Heinz London in 1935, shortly after the discovery that magnetic fields are expelled from superconductors. A major triumph of the equations of this theory is their ability to explain the [[Meissner effect]],&lt;ref name=MeissnerOchsenfeld /&gt; wherein a material exponentially expels all internal magnetic fields as it crosses the superconducting threshold. By using the London equation, one can obtain the dependence of the magnetic field inside the superconductor on the distance to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title = The London equations
|publisher = The Open University
|accessdate  = 2011-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two London equations:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{j}_s}{\partial t} = \frac{n_s e^2}{m}\mathbf{E}, \qquad \mathbf{\nabla}\times\mathbf{j}_s =-\frac{n_s e^2}{m}\mathbf{B}. &lt;/math&gt;
The first equation follows from [[Newton's second law]] for superconducting electrons.

=== Conventional theories (1950s) ===
During the 1950s, theoretical [[condensed matter physics|condensed matter]] physicists arrived at an understanding of "conventional" superconductivity, through a pair of remarkable and important theories: the phenomenological [[Ginzburg-Landau theory]] (1950) and the microscopic [[BCS theory]] (1957).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1950, the [[Phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenological]] [[Ginzburg-Landau theory]] of superconductivity was devised by [[Lev Davidovich Landau|Landau]] and [[Vitalij Lazarevics Ginzburg|Ginzburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory, which combined Landau's theory of second-order [[phase transition]]s with a [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger]]-like wave equation, had great success in explaining the macroscopic properties of superconductors. In particular, [[Alexei Alexeevich Abrikosov|Abrikosov]] showed that Ginzburg-Landau theory predicts the division of superconductors into the two categories now referred to as Type&amp;nbsp;I and Type&amp;nbsp;II. Abrikosov and Ginzburg were awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize for their work (Landau had received the 1962 Nobel Prize for other work, and died in 1968). The four-dimensional extension of the Ginzburg-Landau theory, the [[Coleman-Weinberg potential|Coleman-Weinberg model]], is important in [[quantum field theory]] and [[cosmology]].

Also in 1950, Maxwell and Reynolds ''et al.'' found that the critical temperature of a superconductor depends on the [[isotope|isotopic mass]] of the constituent [[chemical element|element]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The complete microscopic theory of superconductivity was finally proposed in 1957 by [[John Bardeen|Bardeen]], [[Leon Neil Cooper|Cooper]] and [[John Robert Schrieffer|Schrieffer]].&lt;ref name=BardeenCooperSchrieffer /&gt; This BCS theory explained the superconducting current as a [[superfluid]] of [[Cooper pair]]s, pairs of electrons interacting through the exchange of phonons. For this work, the authors were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1972.

The BCS theory was set on a firmer footing in 1958, when [[N. N. Bogolyubov]] showed that the BCS wavefunction, which had originally been derived from a variational argument, could be obtained using a canonical transformation of the electronic [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Generalizations of BCS theory for conventional superconductors form the basis for understanding of the phenomenon of [[superfluidity]], because they fall into the [[lambda transition]] universality class. The extent to which such generalizations can be applied to [[unconventional superconductor]]s is still controversial.

=== Further history ===
The first practical application of superconductivity was developed in 1954 with [[Dudley Allen Buck]]'s invention of the [[cryotron]].&lt;ref name=mit-memo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buck|first1=Dudley A.|title=The Cryotron – A Superconductive Computer Component|url=http://dome.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.3/40618/MC665_r15_M-3843.pdf|publisher=Lincoln Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two superconductors with greatly different values of critical magnetic field are combined to produce a fast, simple switch for computer elements.

Soon after discovering superconductivity in 1911, Kamerlingh Onnes attempted to make an electromagnet with superconducting windings but found that relatively low magnetic fields destroyed superconductivity in the materials he investigated. Much later, in 1955, G.B. Yntema &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Despite being brittle and difficult to fabricate, niobium-tin has since proved extremely useful in supermagnets generating magnetic fields as high as 20 tesla. In 1962 T.G. Berlincourt and R.R.

Promptly thereafter, commercial production of niobium-titanium supermagnet wire commenced at Westinghouse Electric Corporation and at Wah Chang Corporation. Although niobium-titanium boasts less-impressive superconducting properties than those of niobium-tin, niobium-titanium has, nevertheless, become the most widely used “workhorse” supermagnet material, in large measure a consequence of its very-high ductility and ease of fabrication. However, both niobium-tin and niobium-titanium find wide application in MRI medical imagers, bending and focusing magnets for enormous high-energy-particle accelerators, and a host of other applications. Conectus, a European superconductivity consortium, estimated that in 2014, global economic activity for which superconductivity was indispensable amounted to about five billion euros, with MRI systems accounting for about 80% of that total.

In 1962, [[Brian David Josephson|Josephson]] made the important theoretical prediction that a supercurrent can flow between two pieces of superconductor separated by a thin layer of insulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

It is used in the most accurate available measurements of the [[magnetic flux quantum]] ''Φ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''h''/(2''e''), where ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]]. Coupled with the [[quantum Hall effect|quantum Hall resistivity]], this leads to a precise measurement of the Planck constant. Josephson was awarded the Nobel Prize for this work in 1973.

In 2008, it was proposed that the same mechanism that produces superconductivity could produce a [[superinsulator]] state in some materials, with almost infinite [[electrical resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Until 1986, physicists had believed that BCS theory forbade superconductivity at temperatures above about 30&amp;nbsp;K. In that year, [[Johannes Georg Bednorz|Bednorz]] and [[K. Alex Müller|Müller]] discovered superconductivity in a [[lanthanum]]-based cuprate [[Perovskite (structure)|perovskite]] material, which had a transition temperature of 35&amp;nbsp;K (Nobel Prize in Physics, 1987).&lt;ref name=Bednorz /&gt; It was soon found that replacing the lanthanum with [[yttrium]] (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;making [[YBCO]]) raised the critical temperature to 92&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref name="wu" /&gt;

This temperature jump is particularly significant, since it allows [[liquid nitrogen]] as a refrigerant, replacing [[liquid helium]].&lt;ref name="wu"&gt;{{cite journal

This can be important commercially because liquid nitrogen can be produced relatively cheaply, even on-site. Also, the higher temperatures help avoid some of the problems that arise at liquid helium temperatures, such as the formation of plugs of frozen air that can block cryogenic lines and cause unanticipated and potentially hazardous pressure buildup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2008, holographic superconductivity, which uses holographic duality or [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] theory, was proposed by Gubser, Hartnoll, Herzog, and Horowitz, as a possible explanation of high-temperature superconductivity in certain materials.&lt;ref&gt;Holographic Duality in Condensed Matter Physics;Jan Zaanen, Yan Liu, Ya Sun K.Schalm; 2015, Cambridge University Press,Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Superconducting magnet]]s are some of the most powerful [[electromagnet]]s known. They are used in [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]/[[NMR]] machines, [[mass spectrometer]]s, the beam-steering magnets used in [[particle accelerator]]s and plasma confining magnets in some [[tokamaks]]. They can also be used for magnetic separation, where weakly magnetic particles are extracted from a background of less or non-magnetic particles, as in the [[pigment]] industries.

In the 1950s and 1960s, superconductors were used to build experimental digital computers using [[cryotron]] switches. More recently, superconductors have been used to make [[digital circuit]]s based on [[rapid single flux quantum]] technology and [[RF and microwave filter]]s for [[mobile phone]] base stations.

Superconductors are used to build [[Josephson junction]]s which are the building blocks of [[SQUID]]s (superconducting quantum interference devices), the most sensitive [[magnetometer]]s known. SQUIDs are used in [[scanning SQUID microscope]]s and [[magnetoencephalography]]. Series of Josephson devices are used to realize the [[International System of Units|SI]] [[volt]]. Depending on the particular mode of operation, a [[superconductor-insulator-superconductor]] Josephson junction can be used as a photon [[detector]] or as a [[Electronic mixer|mixer]]. The large resistance change at the transition from the normal- to the superconducting state is used to build thermometers in cryogenic [[calorimeter|micro-calorimeter]] photon [[detector]]s. The same effect is used in ultrasensitive [[bolometer]]s made from superconducting materials.

Other early markets are arising where the relative efficiency, size and weight advantages of devices based on [[high-temperature superconductivity]] outweigh the additional costs involved. For example, in [[wind turbine]]s the lower weight and volume of superconducting generators could lead to savings in construction and tower costs, offsetting the higher costs for the generator and lowering the total LCOE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Islam | year = 2014 | title = A review of offshore wind turbine nacelle: Technical challenges, and research and developmental trends. | url = | journal = [[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]] | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 161–176 | doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2014.01.085 |display-authors=etal| hdl = 10453/33256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Promising future applications include high-performance [[smart grid]], [[electric power transmission]], [[transformer]]s, [[SMES|power storage devices]], [[electric motor]]s (e.g. for vehicle propulsion, as in [[vactrain]]s or [[maglev train]]s), [[magnetic levitation device]]s, [[fault current limiter]]s, enhancing spintronic devices with superconducting materials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Linder|first1=Jacob|last2=Robinson|first2=Jason W.

However, superconductivity is sensitive to moving magnetic fields so applications that use [[alternating current]] (e.g. transformers) will be more difficult to develop than those that rely upon [[direct current]]. Compared to traditional power lines superconducting transmission lines are more efficient and require only a fraction of the space, which would not only lead to a better environmental performance but could also improve public acceptance for expansion of the electric grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomas | year = 2016 | title = Superconducting transmission lines – Sustainable electric energy transfer with higher public acceptance? | url = | journal = [[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]] | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 59–72 | doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2015.10.041 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Ronald Garnett''' [[Order of Australia|OAM]] (1 January 1915&amp;nbsp;–22 September 2006) was an English and [[Australia]]n [[Head teacher|headmaster]], [[horticulture|horticulturist]], [[ornithology|ornithologist]] and [[author]]. Before the Second World War, he played [[first-class cricket|first-class]] [[cricket]] for [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/3/3563/3563.html | title = Tommy Garnett |publisher = www.cricketarchive.com | accessdate = 2010-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Garnett was born at [[Marple, Greater Manchester|Marple]], [[Cheshire]] and educated at [[Charterhouse School]] at [[Godalming]], [[Surrey]], and studied classics at [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]].  He began his teaching career at [[Westminster School]], [[London]], and then returned to Charterhouse to teach classics.  During the [[World War II|Second World War]] he served in the [[RAF Regiment]] in [[India]] and [[Burma]].  Following the war he returned to teaching and in 1952 was appointed Master of [[Marlborough College]].

==Cricket career==
As a cricketer, Garnett was a right-handed middle-order batsman. He did not play first-class cricket for [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]], but appeared in a single match for Somerset against Cambridge in 1935. In 1939, he played in the last four matches before cricket was abandoned for the Second World War, and in the final game, he made his highest score, an innings of 75 in the match against [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]] at [[County Ground, Taunton|Taunton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/17/17202.html | title = Scorecard: Somerset v Northamptonshire | date = 1939-08-30 |publisher = www.cricketarchive.com | accessdate = 2010-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, he played in one [[Minor Counties]] match for [[Wiltshire County Cricket Club|Wiltshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/91/91048.html | title = Scorecard: Wiltshire v Surrey Second XI| date = 1953-08-03 |publisher = www.cricketarchive.com | accessdate = 2010-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In 1961, at the age of 46, Garnett was appointed Headmaster of [[Geelong Grammar School]] in [[Victoria, Australia]] and he and his family made what was to be a permanent move to Australia. He was the headmaster when [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] spent two terms at Geelong Grammar School.&lt;ref name=cowling&gt;Cowling (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Garnett was a keen amateur ornithologist and joined the [[Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union]] (RAOU) in 1964.  In 1974, upon his retirement from Geelong Grammar, he became Secretary of the RAOU and served in that position until 1980.  As Secretary he bore the brunt of the administrative load of a body undergoing major change as it evolved from what had become largely a birdwatching club into a scientific conservation organisation undertaking ventures such as the [[Atlas of Australian Birds]] project.&lt;ref name=cowling/&gt;

From 1980 Garnett devoted himself to developing the Garden of St Erth at [[Blackwood, Victoria]], emphasizing the use of Australian native plants in horticulture. The Garden was one of Australia's first private gardens opened to the public in the modern era.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;Latreille, A., 'Garnett, Thomas Ronald', in R. Aitken and M. Looker (eds), ''Oxford Companion to Australian Gardens'', South Melbourne, Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1980 to 1997 he also wrote a regular column for ''[[The Age]]'', published in [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]]. In 1984 Garnett contributed to the government's project to rejuvenate Victoria's country botanic gardens, and in the early 1990s successfully advocated the establishment of an independent board for the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne]].&lt;ref name="Ref-1"/&gt; In 1996 he was awarded the Medal of the [[Order of Australia]] (OAM) for contributions to horticulture.&lt;ref name=cowling/&gt;

'''William Carpenter''' (25 February 1830 – 1 September 1896) was an English [[Printer (publishing)|printer]] and author, and a proponent of the [[flat Earth]] theory, active in England and the United States in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=Herringshaw&gt;Thomas William Herringshaw: ''Herringshaw's Encyclopedia of American Biography of the Nineteenth Century'', Chicago, Ill.: American Publisher's Association, 1905, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Carpenter immigrated to the United States and continued his advocacy of the Flat Earth movement.

==Life==
Carpenter was born on 25 February 1830 in [[Greenwich]], Kent, England and he was baptised on 30 April 1830 at Maize Hill, formerly known as Bethel – Independent in Greenwich. He was the eldest son of Samuel Carpenter and Lucy Moss. He married Annie Gillett January/March 1853 and they eventually had six children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=England, Births and Christenings, 1538–1975 |url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/NPCT-S44  |publisher=Familysearch.org |accessdate= 3 October 2012}} This entry cites reference: Family History Library (FHL) microfilm 0596908 (RG4 1663), 0596909 (RG4 1369).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greenwich, Carpenter became a [[Printer (publishing)|printer]] and [[stenographer]] by profession. In 1879, he moved from England to [[Baltimore]], Maryland, where he continued his work as a printer.  The 1880 US federal census shows him and his wife Annie with six children aged 11–25 years whose occupations included [[milliner]], architect, professor of music, and florist.&lt;ref&gt;''Tenth Census of the United States, 1880'', "Part of 5th Precinct of 2nd Ward in the City of Baltimore," S.D. 1, E.D. 67, p. 9, ll. 16–23, enumerated 3 June 1880. NARA microfilm publication T9, Records of the Bureau of the Census, Record Group 29.  National Archives, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

After arriving in Baltimore, Carpenter taught classes in [[shorthand]]. He published two books on the subject and became known as "Professor Carpenter." Carpenter had other eclectic beliefs per his Baltimore Sun obituary. "For many years Mr. Carpenter had also been a vegetarian, a believer in the power of [[Animal magnetism|mesmerism]] and a [[spiritualist]]. Upon each of these questions he wrote pamphlets. He thought that the eating of meat was responsible for many of the ills that humanity is heir to."&lt;ref name=Herringshaw/&gt;

Carpenter died on Tuesday 1 September 1896 at 1316 North Central Avenue, his home, in Baltimore. Per his obit in the Baltimore Sun, his death was the result "... to a stroke of [[apoplexy]] on Sunday." In the year before his death he had "... a number of slighter strokes ..."&lt;ref name=Herringshaw/&gt;&lt;ref name=Appleton&gt;''Appleton's Annual Cyclopaedia and Register of Important Events'', New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1897, Third Series, Vol. I, p. 549.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocate of the flat Earth theory==
{{Main|Flat Earth|Flat Earth Society}}
Carpenter was a passionate advocate of the [[flat Earth]] theory, which holds that the earth is not a globe, but a flat square which revolves on a central axis with the sun stationary over the centre.&lt;ref name=Herringshaw/&gt;

Carpenter, a printer originally from [[Greenwich]], England, published ''Theoretical Astronomy Examined and Exposed – Proving the Earth not a Globe'' in eight parts from 1864 under the name ''Common Sense''. He later emigrated to [[Baltimore]] where he published ''A hundred proofs the Earth is not a Globe'' in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=William |last=Carpenter |title=One hundred proofs that the earth is not a globe, (Baltimore: The author, 1885) |url=http://www.geocities.com/lclane2/hundreda.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308062134/http://www.geocities.com/lclane2/hundreda.html |archivedate=8 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpenter argued that:
*"There are rivers that flow for hundreds of miles towards the level of the sea without falling more than a few feet — notably, the Nile, which, in a thousand miles, falls but a foot. A level expanse of this extent is quite incompatible with the idea of the Earth's convexity. It is, therefore, a reasonable proof that Earth is not a globe."
*"If the Earth were a globe, a small model globe would be the very best – because the truest – thing for the navigator to take to sea with him. But such a thing as that is not known: with such a toy as a guide, the mariner would wreck his ship, of a certainty!, This is a proof that Earth is not a globe."

Carpenter was a proponent of English writer [[Samuel Rowbotham]] (1816–1885), who produced a pamphlet, with Carpenter's assistance, called ''Zetetic Astronomy'' in 1849 arguing for a flat Earth and published results of many experiments that tested the curvatures of water over a long drainage ditch, followed by another called ''The inconsistency of Modern Astronomy and its Opposition to the Scripture''. Rowbotham also produced studies, mostly printed by Carpenter, that purported to show the effects of ships disappearing below the horizon could be explained by the laws of perspective in relation to the human eye.&lt;ref&gt;

==Principal works==
Some of Carpenter's works found commercial publishers, but many were printed, bound, and sold by himself, at times under the pen-name "Common Sense."&lt;ref name=Herringshaw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=17760.0 |title=Resources: Flat Earth Literature |publisher=Theflatearthsociety.org |accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christine |last=Garwood |title=Flat Earth: The History of an Infamous Idea |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2007 |page= 404 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An incomplete list includes:
