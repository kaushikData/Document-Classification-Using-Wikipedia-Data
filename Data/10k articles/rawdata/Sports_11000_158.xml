On January 7, 2008, the final play of the game was named the Pontiac Game Changing performance of the year.

==Background==
Millsaps brought a 5-0 conference mark into the game, Trinity a 3-1 conference record, essentially turning the regular season contest into a play-in game with the [[Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference]]'s automatic [[NCAA Division III National Football Championship|playoff]] bid on the line. A Millsaps win would secure the playoff berth for the Majors; a Trinity victory would give them control of their own destiny–if they could win their remaining conference games Millsaps would be unable to overtake them.

Coming into the game, Trinity was ranked #19 in the country, while Millsaps was ranked #24 according to the [http://www.d3football.com D3football.com] poll, despite the Majors one game lead in the conference standings. The previous year, Millsaps had ended Trinity's streak of 13 straight SCAC titles with a 34-12&lt;ref name=pagetwo&gt;[http://espn.go.com/espn/page2/story/_/id/7147361/mississippi-miracle-trinity-executes-15-lateral-play-beat-millsaps-2007-fantastic-finish "Page 2 revisits Trinity-Millsaps miracle"], Doug Williams, ESPN.com, Oct. 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; upset over the Tigers on the same field to clinch the 2006 SCAC crown.

==Game summary==

[[Image:TrinityMillsaps.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Trinity's players take the field]]

Trinity got the ball to start the game and used four plays, culminating in a 25-yard run by Chris Baer, to score a touchdown. Millsaps was unable to get a first down and they punted back to Trinity. On the punt, Trinity's Caleb Urban fumbled the ball and Eric McCarty of the Majors recovered at the Trinity 40-yard line. The Tigers defense prevented the Majors from reaching the end zone so the Majors attempted a [[field goal (football)|field goal]], which was no good. The Tigers punted on their next possession and then Majors [[quarterback]] [[Juan Joseph]]'s pass was intercepted by Lee Patterson at the Trinity 4-yard line. The Tigers also ended their drive when Blake Barmore's pass was intercepted by Ray Kline. Millsaps took over at the Trinity 20-yard line and four&amp;nbsp;plays later scored a touchdown on a 12-yard pass from Joseph to Louis Conley. A punt by each team left Trinity with the ball and the score was tied at 7 at the end of the first quarter.&lt;ref name="play by play"/&gt;

In the second quarter, Trinity held the Majors scoreless and made a field goal to take a 10–7 lead into halftime. The third quarter brought a field goal by the Tigers and a touchdown by the Majors. The score was 14–13 Millsaps coming into the final quarter.&lt;ref name="play by play"/&gt;

Millsaps widened their lead with a 9-play 44-yard touchdown scoring drive that used 3:03 of game time. That gave them a 21–13 lead. The Tigers trimmed the lead to 21&amp;ndash;16 with a 22-yard field goal by Peter Licalzi. The Majors answered with their own field goal to make it 24–16. Trinity drove to the Millsaps 13-yard line. On fourth down, Blake Barmore completed a pass to Riley Curry for 13 yards for a touchdown, making it 24–22. The Tigers tried to tie the game with a [[two-point conversion]] but Blake Barmore's pass attempt failed and Trinity had to kick the ball to Millsaps.&lt;ref name="play by play"/&gt;

Leading 24–22, Millsaps got the ball at the Trinity 43-yard line with 2:03 left in the game. They ran four straight rushing plays but were unable to run out the clock. On fourth-and-two with eight seconds left, Millsaps backup quarterback Burt Pereira ran to his left in an attempt to run out the clock; however, he went down with two seconds left, which gave Trinity possession of the ball and one final play in which to score.&lt;ref name="play by play"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.trinity.edu/departments/athletics/Football/Statistics/mc-tu.htm |title=Trinity University vs Millsaps College (Oct 27, 2007) |work=Trinity.edu |publisher=Trinity University |date=October 28, 2007 |accessdate=2007-10-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130024406/http://www.trinity.edu/departments/athletics/Football/Statistics/mc-tu.htm |archivedate=2007-11-30 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final play==

[[Image:Riley Curry 9.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Trinity WR Riley Curry pursued by LB Shawn Gillenwater of Millsaps.]]

The Tigers had time for only one snap so there was no time to move into field goal range. They needed to score a touchdown in one play, working from their own 40-yard line. Believing that 60 yards was too far away to complete a [[Hail Mary pass]], Trinity coach Steve Mohr called for a 10-15 yard underneath route.&lt;ref name=pagetwo/&gt;  The play they ran involved seven players and 15 [[lateral pass|laterals]]. The players who touched the ball for Trinity were (in order, number of touches in parentheses):

*&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;13 Blake Barmore, [[Quarterback]] (2)
*&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;80 Shawn Thompson, [[Wide Receiver]] (3)
*&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;7 Riley Curry, [[Wide Receiver]] (4)
*&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;50 Josh Hooten, [[American football positions#Offense|Offensive Lineman]] (2)
*&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;3 Michael Tomlin, [[Wide Receiver]] (2)
*&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;68 Stephen Arnold, [[American football positions#Offense|Offensive Lineman]] (1)
*&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;25 Brandon Maddux, [[Wide Receiver]] (3)

Here is the sequence of the play, broken down for every time the ball changed hands:

*'''The Pass (Barmore-Thompson)'''
**With the ball spotted just inside the Tigers' own 40-yard line, Trinity [[Quarterback]] Blake Barmore (#13) took the snap out of a 5-wide shotgun set, stepped up in the pocket and completed a [[forward pass|pass]] over the middle to Tigers' [[Wide Receiver]] Shawn Thompson (#80) at Millsaps' 49-yard line.
*'''Lateral #1 (Thompson-Curry)'''
**Thompson (#80) cut back to his right and reached the Majors' 44, then turned around and, just as he was hit by two Millsaps defenders, tossed the ball to Wide Receiver Riley Curry (#7) who was just a few feet away, on the Majors' 47.
*'''Lateral #2 (Curry-Hooten)'''
**Curry (#7) advanced to the Millsaps 43-yard line, near the Trinity sideline. Staving off a would-be tackle by Millsaps safety Ray Kline (#1) with his left arm, Curry leapt and tossed the ball backwards with his right. It was caught by offensive lineman Josh Hooten (#50).
*'''Lateral #3 (Hooten-Tomlin)'''
**Without looking, Hooten (#50) immediately flipped the ball over his head to Wide Receiver Michael Tomlin (#3), who caught it around the Millsaps 47.
*'''Lateral #4 (Tomlin-Arnold)'''
**Tomlin (#3) started to his left, but had to pitch the ball immediately. Just before being hit hard by Millsaps defensive lineman Casey Younger (#90), he made an underhanded toss to Tigers offensive lineman Stephen Arnold (#68), who was right behind him.
*'''Lateral #5 (Arnold-Thompson)'''
**Arnold (#68) immediately turned around and pitched the ball to Thompson (#80), who caught the ball in stride around Trinity's 48.
*'''Lateral #6 (Thompson-Maddux)'''
**Thompson (#80) sprinted left, back towards the middle of the field, but was not able to make any forward progress. He made a quick pitch to wide receiver Brandon Maddux (#25), who was sprinting back to the right, just before being hit by Millsaps linebacker Ronnie Wheat (#14).
*'''Lateral #7 (Maddux-Curry)'''
**Maddux (#25) avoided a would-be tackle by Millsaps defensive lineman Cedric Lawrence (#13), ran right, back towards the Trinity sideline, and was able to turn up and advance to the Majors' 43. With Millsaps linebacker Shawn Gillenwater (#50) closing in, Maddux turned around and passed the ball back to Curry (#7) who was waiting back at the Tigers' 48-yard line.
*'''Lateral #8 (Curry-Maddux)'''
**Curry (#7) was quickly pinned against the Trinity sideline near midfield, by Millsaps defenders Younger (#90), Gillenwater (#50), and defensive lineman Denarold Anderson (#62). He jumped and threw the ball ''back'' to Maddux (#25), who had worked his way back near the Trinity 45-yard line, just before being forced out of bounds.
*'''Lateral #9 (Maddux-Barmore)'''
**Maddux (#25) caught the ball around Trinity's own 45, near the Tigers' sideline. With Gillenwater (#50) and Millsaps defensive back Michael Sims (#35) closing quickly, Maddux turned and passed the ball laterally across the field to Barmore (#13), who caught it in stride at Trinity's 42.
*'''Lateral #10 (Barmore-Thompson II)'''
**Barmore (#13) took the pass and sprinted all the way down near the Major's 30, then flipped the ball back to Shawn Thompson (#80), before being tackled by Kline (#1)
*'''Lateral #11 (Thompson-Curry II)'''
**Thompson (#80) caught the ball around the Majors' 35, on the numbers near the Millsaps sideline. He made it inside the Majors' 30, turned and threw a pass to his right before being brought down by Millsaps defensive back Jonathan Brooks (#31).
*'''Lateral #12 (Curry-Tomlin)'''
**Curry (#7) caught the ball in stride at the Majors' 36. He started to his left, then turned and retreated behind the Millsaps 40 and back to his right to avoid Millsaps linebacker Wheat (#14). He then cut up inside the Millsaps 40 to avoid Anderson (#62) and pitched the ball back towards midfield just as he was hit by Sims (#35).
*'''Lateral #13 (Tomlin-Hooten)'''
**Michael Tomlin (#3) caught the pitch at the Majors' 41-yard line in the middle of the field with no defenders near him. He raced back to the right side of the field, near the Majors' 30, where he flipped the ball back over his head with one hand before being brought down by Kline (#1).
*'''Lateral #14 (Hooten-Maddux)'''
**Josh Hooten (#50) caught the ball and immediately pitched it to Maddux (#25) who was waiting on the Majors' 31, near the Trinity sideline.
*'''Lateral #15, Fumble, Score (Maddux-Curry II)'''
**With Millsaps lineman Younger (#90) closing in, Maddux (#25) attempted a backwards pass that was nearly batted down by Younger (#90), but bounced off the turf near the Majors' 35 and into the hands of Curry (#7), who took the ball in stride in the middle of the field, picked up a block, and raced past the last Millsaps defender for the score and the win.&lt;ref name="Trinity Lateralpalooza"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=forde_pat&amp;id=3086283&amp;sportCat=ncf | title=Trinity's Lateralpalooza rocks Division III and beyond | author=Forde, Pat | work=ESPN.com | publisher=The Disney Company | date=October 30, 2007|accessdate=2007-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NCAA statistical guidelines state that the yardage on a play with multiple laterals goes to the ball carrier who had the ball the longest, or the player scoring a touchdown. This is done to simplify things for the official scorer, as opposed to having to record each independent lateral. As a result, the play-by-play record of the game officially records the play as "Blake Barmore pass complete to Shawn Thompson for 16 yards to the MSPS44, Riley Curry for 44 yards to the MSPS0, 1ST DOWN TRINITY, TOUCHDOWN, clock 00:00."&lt;ref name="play by play"/&gt;

In the video, it is clear that several Millsaps defenders stopped playing before the play was over. On the thirteenth lateral, Tomlin was taken down but tossed a no-look pitch over his shoulder to Hooten just before his knee hit the ground. Many Millsaps fans believed the play to be over and fireworks were shot off from behind the endzone in celebration. Maddux's final lateral hit the ground and bounced into Curry's hands. It appeared as though two defenders near Curry believed the play was over at that point, and Curry scampered into the endzone untouched.  Millsaps safety Michael Sims, the closest player to Curry when Curry caught the last lateral, later admitted that he turned around and started walking away, believing the game to be over.&lt;ref name=pagetwo/&gt;

The play took more than a minute of real-time to conclude and analysts have said it is the longest or possibly the longest play in college football history. ESPN said the play took 62 seconds and reports may be the longest play in [[History of American football|college football history]].&lt;ref name="Trinity Lateralpalooza"/&gt;  The ''Frederick News Post'' said the play took 63 seconds and they also stated "it might very well be the longest play in college history."&lt;ref name="Frederick"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fredericknewspost.com/sections/news/online_exclusives_display.htm?StoryID=67086 |title=Kurt Miller: No gimmicks needed - Unlike the NFL, college football is special |author=Miller, Kurt |work=FrederickNewsPost.com |publisher=Frederick News Post |date=November 1, 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102160545/http://www.fredericknewspost.com/sections/news/online_exclusives_display.htm?StoryID=67086 |archivedate=November 2, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  NBC said "If this wasn't the most memorable game-ending play in college football history, it likely was the longest play -- by a multiple of two -- in the game's history."&lt;ref name="upon further review"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcsports.com/portal/site/nbcsports/menuitem.6f806e473b4cb158fb00ec22493c2d04/?vgnextoid=46f6c3bd7cbe5110VgnVCM10000075c1d240RCRD&amp;cpsextcurrchannel=1 |title=Upon Further Review -- 10/29/08 |author=Walters, John |work=NBCSports.com |publisher=NBC |date=October 29, 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113143359/http://www.nbcsports.com/portal/site/nbcsports/menuitem.6f806e473b4cb158fb00ec22493c2d04/?vgnextoid=46f6c3bd7cbe5110VgnVCM10000075c1d240RCRD&amp;cpsextcurrchannel=1 |archivedate=November 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  SouthernCollegeSports.com called it the longest play and commented "Perhaps the most amazing thing about this longest play ever is the fact that not a single flag was thrown for a rules infraction."&lt;ref name="southerncollegesports"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://southerncollegesports.com/fb_07_david_103107.html | title=At last, the end finally pays off | work=SoutherCollegeSports.com | date=October 31, 2007|accessdate=2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast==
The announcing crew for the game consisted of a five-person team with only one video camera. Jonathan Wiener, a Trinity sophomore English major from Jackson, Mississippi, had the play-by-play. Justin Thompson, (brother of Shawn Thompson, one of the play participants) of New Braunfels, Texas, was the color analyst. Bill Swint of New Braunfels, Texas, ran the video camera assisted by Butch Maddux of China Spring, Texas. The video and audio feeds were mixed and uploaded live to a streaming videocast server by Bob Edwards of Dallas, Texas. The game was broadcast live on the internet but was not otherwise televised. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', "Wiener kept his cool through the frenzy and described most of the details precisely as they occurred. The replay of the video with Wiener’s description has been shown on national television and has become a hit on the Internet."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/30/sports/ncaafootball/30trinity.html?ref=ncaafootball | title=Student Announcer Ensures Laterals Are Heard Round the World | author=LaPoint, Joe | work=NYTimes.com | publisher=The New York Times | date=October 30, 2007 | accessdate=2007-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Curry scored the touchdown, Wiener shouted, "Curry scores! The game is over! The Tigers lateraled it and kept lateraling!! And the game is over! The Tigers win! The Tigers win!"&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

==Analysis==
With the win, the Trinity Tigers remained in contention for the [[Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference]] (SCAC) championship as well as an automatic berth into the NCAA Division III playoffs. Millsaps would have secured a spot in the playoffs had they won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gtT78AR2dROG4bofyMvRrPpJKhPQD8SJ0HO00 |title=Trinity Wins: 15&amp;nbsp;Laterals on Last Play |author=Hawkins, Stephen |work=AP.Google.com |publisher=Associated Press |date=October 29, 2007 |accessdate=2007-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031074244/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gtT78AR2dROG4bofyMvRrPpJKhPQD8SJ0HO00 |archivedate=October 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trinity won the championship for 2007, receiving a playoff berth but was ultimately eliminated in the first round by the [[University of Mary Hardin-Baylor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinity.edu/departments/athletics/Football/game_summaries/TU-NCAA1.htm Athletics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119165448/http://www.trinity.edu/departments/athletics/Football/game_summaries/TU-NCAA1.htm |date=January 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESPN reported, "In the digital age, even D-III games can go global in a flash. And so a slice of fame normally reserved for the semiprofessionals at the big-dollar Division I programs was bestowed upon the Tigers. That night they gathered in the lobby of their hotel near the Millsaps campus to watch, in disbelief, as they made ''[[SportsCenter]]''."&lt;ref name="Trinity Lateralpalooza"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4415">'''BodyAttack''' is a commercial group-fitness [[aerobics]] program including some sports-derived movements, aimed primarily at developing [[cardiovascular fitness]]. The program is created and distributed by [[Les Mills International]], with music and movements varied every few months.&lt;ref&gt;Shipside, S. (2012). ''Gym Fitness: Secrets of Fitness and Health Success.'' Oxford, UK: Infinite Ideas&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK it is offered at around 1,300 health and fitness facilities, approximately one fifth of such facilities in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Felstead, A., Fuller, A., Jewson, N., Kakavelakis, K. &amp; Unwin, L. (2007). Grooving to the same tunes? Learning, training and productive systems in the aerobics studio. ''Work Employment &amp; Society, 21,'' 189-208&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a standardized class that is either 55 minutes or 45 minutes in length, led by an [[Fitness professional|instructor]] who leads participants through various exercises to a contemporary music soundtrack. Like [[BodyPump]] and other Les Mills programs, the movements, exercises and music are standardized for all instructors, with the company releasing a new program every three months.&lt;ref name="Anonymous"&gt;Anonymous (2004). BodyAttack. ''Ultra-Fit Magazine, 14 (7)'', 102-103&lt;/ref&gt; As with most [[aerobics]] classes, the aim is to develop numerous domains of [[physical fitness]], particularly [[cardiovascular fitness]] and [[Endurance|stamina]].

==The structure==
The structure of a BodyAttack class never changes, although various tracks may be sidelined to shorten the workout to either a 45 or 30 minute workout.

There are two blocks of work, which both have one cardio peak each. '''Block One''' starting with a warm up, and peaks with a plyometrics track, '''Block Two''' starts with a circular running track and peaks with a power track. You will be reaching near maximum heart rates during these two peak tracks, especially during the power track.

==The format==
{{advert|date=October 2017}}
BodyAttack originally had a track list consisting of 12 tracks, but shortened it to 11 in 2004 with BodyAttack 46. Instead of completely erasing one track, the Upper Body Conditioning and Lower Body Conditioning tracks merged into one track combining them both.
* Track 1, Warmup. The focus is on getting the entire body warmed up.
* Track 2, Mixed Impact. This track focuses on getting your legs ready for jumping and getting the heart rate up.
* Track 3, Aerobics. This track uses big, aerobic movements such as jumping jacks and single knees.
* Track 4, Plyometrics. First cardio peak of the class with big, explosive movements such as plyometric lunges, jump squats, burpees and skaters.
* Track 5, Athletic Strength. A combination of conditioning and strength moves such as pushups, tricep pushups, squats and lunges to condition the entire body.
* Track 6, Running. With a focus on athletic movements to improve running motion, participants also run around the room to bring the heart rate back up.
* Track 7, Agility. This track is designed for speed and agility work. Typical moves include ladder runs, side bounces and forward sprints. 
* Track 8, Interval. This track uses big movements, such as kicks, side flicks and running to get the heart rate up and then lighter moves to bring the pulse back down for each interval.
* Track 9, Power. The second cardio peak, often including high knees, burpees, jumping jacks and other plyometric moves.
* Track 10, Core. This track targets the entire core (abs, back and posterior muscles,) frequently utilizing crunches and variations on planks and hovers.
* Track 11, Cooldown. A track to relax and do a lighter stretch.

==Research==

Few published studies have investigated the BodyAttack program scientifically. One study investigated the energy expenditure and oxygen consumption of three male and three female participants (mostly instructors) during a typical 55-minute BodyAttack class, undertaken in a controlled laboratory setting.  Average energy expenditure was 660kcal for the male participants and 602kcal for the female participants.&lt;ref&gt;Lythe, J. &amp; Pfitzinger, P. (2000). ''Caloric Expenditure and Aerobic Demand of BodyStep, BodyAttack, BodyCombat and RPM.'' Downloaded June 2012 from [http://www.holmesplace.pt/fotos/editor2/bc0203caloricexpenditure.pdf Holmes Place]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bodybuilding.com''' is an American online retailer based in [[Boise, Idaho]], specializing in [[dietary supplement]]s, [[Dietary supplement|sports supplement]]s, and [[bodybuilding supplement]]s. It is one of the Internet's most-trafficked health and fitness websites, with over 1 million daily visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bodybuilding.com achievements|url=http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bbcomcareer.htm|website=www.bodybuilding.com|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from its commercial responsibilities, Bodybuilding.com publishes daily editorial content, training plans, and streams live broadcasts of major [[bodybuilding]] competitions. It also operates its own fitness-themed social network, BodySpace, with over 2.7 million active members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bodybuilding.com achievements|url=http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bbcomcareer.htm|website=www.bodybuilding.com|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the website has led to a number of proprietary sports nutrition products and accessories being developed and sold under its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bodybuilding.com products|url=http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/bodybuilding.htm|website=www.bodybuilding.com|accessdate=12 November 2015}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, the CEO and founder Ryan DeLuca stepped down from his role, announcing he would be succeeded on an interim basis by Liberty Media CFO Chris Shean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/business/article40650900.html|title=Bodybuilding.com founder DeLuca steps down|last=|first=|date=5 October 2015|website=Idaho Statesman|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bodybuilding.com grew out of wholesale-creatine.com, an online storefront created by teenage web marketer and amateur bodybuilder Ryan DeLuca in 1997, to capitalize on the rising popularity of [[creatine supplement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeLuca|first1=Ryan|title=Ask a guy who started Bodybuilding.com anything, part I|url=http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=7224141&amp;p=128278351#post128278351|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="titleCatching Up with the 2006 30 Under 30 Alumni, Leading Your Company Article - Inc.

While teenbodybuilding.com flourished with articles and writings by some of the most successful teen bodybuilders of the time like [[Layne Norton]], Anthony Church, and others, it was eventually merged into the primary domain name, bodybuilding.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeLuca|first1=Ryan|title=Ask a guy who started Bodybuilding.com anything, part III|url=http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=7224141&amp;p=128280951#post128280951|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Church|first1=Anthony|title=About Fitness Expert Anthony Church|url=http://anthonychurchfitness.com/about|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of rapid growth, a majority stake in Bodybuilding.com was acquired in July 2006 by Milestone Partners for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milestone Completes Sale of Bodybuilding.com|url=http://www.milestonepartners.com/News/Milestone-News/2008/Milestone-Completes-Sale-of-Bodybuilding-com|website=Milestone Partners|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, [[Inc. Magazine]] ranked DeLuca number five on its list "30 Under 30: America's Coolest Entrepreneurs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bodybuilding.com CEO ranked number five in America's Coolest Young Entrepreneurs!|url=http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/pr43.htm|website=Bodybuilding.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2008, [[Liberty Media Corporation]] acquired a controlling stake in Bodybuilding.com for more than $100 million.&lt;ref name="Liberty Media buying Bodybuilding.com stake: report"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUSN0737720520080107 |title=Liberty Media buying Bodybuilding.com stake: report |accessdate=2008-01-10 |format= |work=Reuters | first=Ritsuko | last=Ando | date=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeLuca stayed on as the company's CEO.

As of 2014, Bodybuilding.com is a nine-time honoree on the Inc. 5000 ranking of America's fastest-growing companies, with a reported revenue in 2013 of $420 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Startup Grind: Ryan DeLuca, CEO of Bodybuilding.com|url=http://startupgrind.com/event/startup-grind-boise-hosted-ryan-deluca-bodybuilding-com/|website=Startup Grind|accessdate=17 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012092903/http://startupgrind.com/event/startup-grind-boise-hosted-ryan-deluca-bodybuilding-com/#|archive-date=2014-10-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has 785 employees working at 4 locations, including distribution centers in [[North Las Vegas, NV]]; [[New Berlin, WI]]; [[Shiremanstown, PA]]; and [[Bedfordshire]], U.K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bodybuilding.com achievements|url=http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bbcomcareer.htm|website=www.bodybuilding.com|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corporate headquarters is also located in Boise, along with the company's customer service [[call center]].

In 2013, the company donated the equipment for Boise's first outdoor gym, located in [[Ann Morrison Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boise's first outdoor gym opens Thursday in Ann Morrison Park|url=http://www.ktvb.com/story/news/2014/07/01/11894085/|accessdate=17 November 2014|agency=KTVB News Channel 7 Boise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misidentified drugs===
In 2007, an FDA agent purchased several dietary supplements from the company which were determined to contain anabolic steroids. In May 2012, Bodybuilding.com was fined $7 million, and as part of the settlement, CEO DeLuca and his brother Jeremy were both fined $600,000 for selling misbranded drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Bill|title=Bodybuilding.com agrees to pay $7 million fine for violating Food and Drugs act|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/2012/05/09/2109572/bodybuildingcom-agrees-to-pay.html|publisher=Idaho Statesman|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/CriminalInvestigations/ucm305494.htm|title=US FDA Criminal Investigations- May 22, 2012: Bodybuilding.com, LLC, Ryan Deluca, and Jeremy DeLuca Plead Guilty in Federal Court to Violating FDCA|accessdate =2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ryan Deluca Steps Down ===

In 2015, [[Liberty Interactive]] spun off Bodybuilding.com and its stake in [[Expedia, Inc.|Expedia]] into a new company, Liberty Expedia Holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Liberty Interactive to spin off CommerceHub, Liberty Expedia| work = Reuters| accessdate = 2017-09-24| date = 2015-11-12| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-liberty-interactive-divestiture/liberty-interactive-to-spin-off-commercehub-liberty-expedia-idUSKCN0T11GF20151112}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016 after a massive layoff,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ktvb.com/news/local/bodybuildingcom-lays-off-about-90-in-boise/361027780|title=Bodybuilding.com lays off about 90 in Boise|last=TEGNA|newspaper=KTVB|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bodybuilding.com reorganized to form 4 different companies/brands.

'''Buccaneer Arena''' is a 3,408-seat multi-purpose arena in [[Urbandale, Iowa]] that is currently home to the [[Des Moines Buccaneers]] [[ice hockey]] team in the [[United States Hockey League]]. Before the Bucs began playing here in 1980, the [[International Hockey League (1945-2001)|International Hockey League]]'s [[Des Moines Oak Leafs]] and [[Des Moines Capitols]] franchise played here.

==Building history==
The arena opened on November 12, 1961&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Leafs Hand Metros 10-1 Loss in Debut| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=F4ZRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8xAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6955,1637990&amp;dq=en| newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel| date=November 13, 1963| accessdate=November 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the Des Moines Ice Arena. It was later renamed the Metro Ice Sports Arena before becoming Buccaneer Arena in mid-2004.  On September 22, 2005, Buccaneer Arena was renamed 95-KGGO Arena after [[Citadel Broadcasting]], owners of [[radio station]] [[KGGO]], purchased the [[naming rights]] to the arena. It is nicknamed the "Madhouse on Hickman" for its location on Hickman Road.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stadiumjourney.com/stadiums/buccaneer-arena-s1498/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the arena changed its name back to Buccaneer Arena.

==Tenants==
The arena serves as home ice for the Des Moines Buccaneers' ten championship seasons in the 1990s: Anderson Cup regular season champs in 1994, '95, '98, '99; Clark Cup playoff champs in 1992, '95, '99, '06; and Gold Cup Junior-A champs in '92, '95, '98.  In 2007, the arena hosted the [[College Hockey America]] championship tournament.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uscho.com/2006/07/03/cha-heads-to-iowa-for-2007-tournament/&lt;/ref&gt;  The arena has also hosted mixed martial arts.&lt;ref&gt;http://mmajunkie.com/2016/01/victory-fc-48-heads-to-iowa-on-feb-19-with-jackson-vs-moreno-title-fight&lt;/ref&gt;

The game of '''[[cricket]]''' has inspired much '''poetry''', most of which romanticises the sport and its culture.

==Poems==

===At Lord's===
[[Francis Thompson]] wrote the following poem, ''At Lord's'':

: It is little I  repair to the matches of the Southron folk,
:: Though my own red roses there may blow;
: It is little I  repair to the matches of the Southron folk,
:: Though the red roses crest the caps, I know.
: For the field is full of shades as I near a shadowy coast,
: And a ghostly batsman plays to the bowling of a ghost,
: And I look through my tears on a soundless-clapping host
:: As the run stealers flicker to and fro,
::: To and fro:
:: O my [[A. N. Hornby|Hornby]] and my [[Dick Barlow|Barlow]] long ago !

: It's [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Glo'ster]] coming North, the irresistible,
:: The Shire of the [[W. G. Grace|Graces]], long ago!
: It's Gloucestershire up North, the irresistible,
:: And new-risen [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] the foe!
: A Shire so young that has scarce impressed its traces,
: Ah, how shall it stand before all-resistless Graces ?
: O, little red rose, their bats are as maces
:: To beat thee down, this summer long ago !

: This day of seventy-eight they are come up north against thee
:: This day of seventy-eight long ago!
: The [[W. G. Grace|champion of the centuries]], he cometh up against thee,
:: With his brethren, every one a famous foe!
: The [[E. M. Grace|long-whiskered Doctor]], that laugheth the rules to scorn,
: While the bowler, pitched against him, bans the day he was born;
: And [[Fred Grace|G.F.]] with his science makes the fairest length forlorn;
:: They are come from the West  to work thee woe!

: It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk,
:: Though my own red roses there may blow;
: It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk,
:: Though the red roses crest the caps, I know.
: For the field is full of shades as I near a shadowy coast,
: And a ghostly batsman plays to the bowling of a ghost,
: And I look through my tears on a soundless-clapping host
:: As the run stealers flicker to and fro,
::: To and fro:
:: O my Hornby and my Barlow long ago !

Not long before his death and long after he had watched Hornby and Barlow bat at [[Old Trafford]], Thompson was invited to watch Lancashire play Middlesex at Lord's. As the day of the match grew closer, Thompson became increasingly nostalgic. At the end, he did not go for the match, but sat at home and wrote ''At Lord's''. The original match in 1878 ended in a draw, with Gloucestershire needing 111 to win with five wickets in hand, Grace 58* [https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/2/2222.html]

The first stanza of the poem has contributed the titles of at least three books on cricket:

*'''[[G. D. Martineau]]'s''' ''The field is full of shades'' [https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0007K7X26]
*'''[[Eric Midwinter]]'s''' history of Lancashire cricket ''Red roses crest the caps'' [http://dogbert.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=179781914]
*'''R. H. Young's''' ''Field Full of Shades''. A personal history of Claverham ([[Yatton]]) Cricket Club.

The first stanza is also quoted in full by Count Bronowsky in [[Paul Scott (novelist)|Paul Scott's]] Raj Quartet novel, [[The Day of the Scorpion]].

===''Punch'' on William Scotton===
The satirical magazine ''Punch'' printed the following poem following a particularly slow and boring innings by [[William Scotton]]. It mimicked [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s famous [https://web.archive.org/web/20041205012625/http://tennysonpoetry.home.att.net/bbb.htm "Break, break, break"].

:Block, block, block
::At the foot of thy wicket, O Scotton!
:And I would that my tongue would utter
::My boredom. You ''won't'' put the pot on!
:Oh, nice for the bowler, my boy,
::That each ball like a barndoor you play!
:Oh, nice for yourself, I suppose,
::That you stick at the wicket all day!

:And the clock's slow hands go on,
::And you still keep up your sticks; 
:But oh! for the lift of a smiting hand,
::And the sound of a swipe for six!
:Block, block, block,
::At the foot of thy wicket, ah do!
:But one hour of [[W. G. Grace|Grace]] or [[Walter Read]]
::Were worth a week of you!

===Alfred Mynn===
When [[Alfred Mynn]] died in 1861, [[William Jeffrey Prowse]] penned a poem in his memory. The first six stanzas compare Mynn with his contemporaries and the poem closes with these lines:

:With his tall and stately presence, with his nobly moulded form,
:His broad hand was ever open, his brave heart was ever warm;
:All were proud of him, all loved him. As the changing seasons pass,
:As our champion lies a-sleeping underneath the Kentish grass,
:Proudly, sadly will we name him – to forget him were a sin.
:Lightly lie the turf upon thee, kind and manly Alfred Mynn !

===Les Murray===
The Australian poet [[Les Murray (poet)|Les Murray]] wrote ''The Aboriginal Cricketer'':

:Good-looking young man
:in your [[Crimea]]n shirt
:with your willow shield
:up, as if to face spears,

:you're inside their men's Law,
:one church they do obey;
:they'll remember you were here.
:Keep fending off their casts.

:Don't come out of character.
:Like you they suspect
:idiosyncrasy of witchcraft.
:Above all, don't get out

:too easily, and have to leave here
:where all missiles are just leather
:and come from one direction.
:Keep it noble. Keep it light.

===Others===
One of the most famous pieces of nostalgic rose-tinted poems is [[Vitai Lampada]] by Sir [[Henry Newbolt]].

:There's a breathless hush in the Close tonight –
:Ten to make and the match to win –
:A bumping pitch and a blinding light,
:An hour to play and the last man in.
:And it's not for the sake of the ribboned coat,
:Or the selfish hope of a season's fame,
:But his Captain's hand on his shoulder smote –
:'Play up ! play up ! and play the game !'
 
:The sand of the Desert is sodden red –
:Red with the wreck of a square that broke; –
:The Gatling's jammed and the Colonel's dead,
:And the regiment's blind with dust and smoke.
:The river of death has brimmed its banks,
:And England's far, and Honour a name,
:But the voice of a schoolboy rallies the ranks:
:'Play up ! play up ! and play the game !'
 
:This is the world that year by year,
:While in her place the school is set,
:Every one of her sons must hear,
:And none that hears it dare forget.
:This they all with joyful mind
:Bear through life like a torch in flame,
:And falling fling to the host behind –
:'Play up ! play up ! and play the game !'

The very short "''A Cricket Poem''" by [[Harold Pinter]] encapsulates the mood and nostalgia common to lovers of cricket:

:I saw Len Hutton in his prime,
:Another time,
:another time.

[[Andrew Lang]]'s cricketing parody of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s "[[Brahma (poem)|Brahma]]" is memorable:

:If the wild bowler thinks he bowls,
:Or if the batsman thinks he's bowled,
:They know not, poor misguided souls,
:They too shall perish unconsoled.
:I am the batsman and the bat,
:I am the bowler and the ball,
:The umpire, the pavilion cat,
:The roller, pitch, and stumps, and all.

[[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]]'s song "[[When an Old Cricketer Leaves the Crease]]" (1975) is perhaps the best-known cricket lyric in contemporary popular music:

:When an old cricketer leaves the crease, you never know whether he's gone,
:If sometimes you're catching a fleeting glimpse, of a twelfth man at silly mid-on.
:And it could be [[Geoff Boycott|Geoff]], and it could be [[John Snow (cricketer)|John]],
:With a new ball sting in his tail.
:And it could be me, and it could be thee,
:And it could be the sting in the ale.........sting in the ale.

:(partial)

Roy Harper also penned a poem for English cricketer [[Graeme Fowler|Graeme Fowler's]] benefit event. ''[[Three Hundred Words]]''.

:I remember Pat Tetley,
:and romping in grass
:- that was tall –
:at the back of the [[Cricket pitch|cricket field]],
:trying to catch glimpses
:of [[panties|knickers]] and [[Buttocks|ass]],
:whilst over the fence
:the crowd yelled, ooh-ed and roared,
:as [[Sonny Ramadhin|Ramadhin]], [[Everton Weekes|Weekes]] and [[Frank Worrell]] all scored...
:
:(partial)

Australian poet Damian Balassone often employs cricket themes, such as in the poem 'Strange Dismissal' which appears in [[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]:

:It sounds silly   
:but it’s harsh  
:to be caught Lillee   
:bowled Marsh,  
::but that’s what happened to me    
::the over prior to tea.

==Miscellaneous verses and songs==

===The Surrey Poet on Jack Hobbs===

[[Albert Craig (rhymester)|Albert Craig]], better known as ''The Surrey Poet'' was a popular figure at [[The Oval]] at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, hawking his rapidly improvised verses to the crowd. Of [[Jack Hobbs]]' [[County Championship]] debut he wrote:

:Joy reigned in the Pavilion,
:And gladness 'mongst his clan
:While thousands breathed good wishes round the ring;
:Admirers dubbed the youngster
:As Surrey's coming man;
:In Jack Hobbs' play they saw the genuine ring.
:'Twas well worth going to see
:Illustrious [[Tom Hayward|Hayward]]'s smile,
:While [[Razor Smith]] and [[Walter Lees]]
:Cheered with the rank and file.

===Victory Calypso===

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06P0RdZyjT4 Lord Beginner sings Victory Calypso]

At Lord's in 1950, West Indies defeated England in England for the first time. Egbert Moore, who sang under the pseudonym [[Lord Beginner]], popularized the most famous of cricketing calypsos to celebrate the occasion. He was accompanied by Calypso Rhythm Kings, 'supervision' by Denis Preston. It was recorded on the 'Melodisc' (1133) label (MEL 20). The song was originally composed by [[Lord Kitchener (calypsonian)|Lord Kitchener]].

''The Victory Calypso'' also immortalised the spin bowling pair of [[Sonny Ramadhin]] and [[Alf Valentine]]. The calypso begins thus:

:Cricket lovely Cricket,
:At Lord's where I saw it;
:Cricket lovely Cricket,
:At Lord's where I saw it;
:Yardley tried his best
:But Goddard won the Test.
:They gave the crowd plenty fun;
:Second Test and West Indies won.

Chorus:  With those two little pals of mine
::Ramadhin and Valentine.

===The Ashes ([[MCC tour of Australia in 1954–55|Australia vs MCC 1954-55]])===
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ieaxt-ukFzs Lord Kitchener sings The Ashes (Australia vs MCC 1955)]

Tyson taught them a lesson that can't be forgotten,&lt;br /&gt;
Tyson taught them a lesson that can't be forgotten,&lt;br /&gt;
We began quietly, but we came back with victory,&lt;br /&gt;
Good captaincy from [[Len Hutton]], but the honours must go to [[Frank Tyson|Typhoon Tyson]].

Australia's tragedy, it began at Sydney,&lt;br /&gt;
Magnificent Tyson, had their batsmen beaten,&lt;br /&gt;
He went on to give us, a victory for Christmas,&lt;br /&gt;
Good captaincy from Len Hutton, but the honours must go to Typhoon Tyson.

More shocks for Australia, the Melbourne disaster,&lt;br /&gt;
As [[Les Favell|Favell]] got going, his wicket went tumbling,&lt;br /&gt;
We got them out cheaply, and score second victory,&lt;br /&gt;
Good captaincy from Len Hutton, but the honours must go to Typhoon Tyson.

The bowling was so good, it remind them of [[Harold Larwood|Larwood]],&lt;br /&gt;
Magnificent Tyson finished with seven for twenty-seven,&lt;br /&gt;
They had no excuses, we regained [[the Ashes]],&lt;br /&gt;
Good captaincy from Len Hutton, but the honours must go to Typhoon Tyson.

===Gavaskar Calypso===

Lord Relator (born Willard Harris) wrote the 'Gavaskar Calypso' to celebrate [[Sunil Gavaskar|Gavaskar]]’s first Test series, [[Indian cricket team in West Indies in 1970–71|in West Indies in 1970–71]]. This was voted at No. 68 at a 'Calypso of the Century' poll (''Victory Calypso'' didn't feature in the list). [https://web.archive.org/web/20050410031741/http://www.djtonytempo.com/SURVEY/survey2.htm]

The most famous part of the ''Gavaskar Calypso'' is the one that describes how he batted like a wall :

:It was Gavaskar
:The real master
:Just like a wall
:We couldn't out Gavaskar at all
:Not at all
:You know the West Indies couldn't out Gavaskar at all.

===[[A E Housman]]===
Cricket features, albeit briefly, in this late-Victorian poet's most famous collection of somewhat gloomy poems, "[[A Shropshire Lad]]", published in 1896 and never out-of-print since then.  Poem XVII reads:

:Twice a week the winter thorough
:Here stood I to keep the goal:
:Football then was fighting sorrow
:For the young man’s soul.

:Now in Maytime to the wicket
:Out I march with bat and pad:
:See the son of grief at cricket
:Trying to be glad.

:Try I will; no harm in trying:
:Wonder ’tis how little mirth
:Keeps the bones of man from lying
:On the bed of earth.

===10cc "Dreadlock Holiday"===

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5xm3F-s6xE 10CC sing Dreadlock Holiday with lyrics]

"[[Dreadlock Holiday]]" is probably the most well-known pop song to mention cricket. [[10cc]]'s hit single reached number 1 in the UK in 1978. However, the song has only a tenuous connection with cricket, mentioning it in the chorus, "I don't like cricket, oh no, I love it"

===Duckworth Lewis Method===

The group [[The Duckworth Lewis Method]] have released two [[concept album]]s about cricket.

==History==
In January 2013, Anthem Media's subsidiary Fight Media was granted approval from the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) to launch a television channel called "The League – Fantasy Sports TV," described as "a national, English-language specialty Category B service devoted to fantasy sports, allowing viewers to act as owners and assume all the responsibilities associated with operating real sports franchises, and allowing viewers to create, monitor, trade and discuss players on their teams with others also playing fantasy sports."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2013/2013-7.htm Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2013-7] CRTC 2013-01-09&lt;/ref&gt; 

In February 2013, Anthem acquired two fantasy sports analysis websites—RotoExperts and [[SportsGrid]]—to bolster content for the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediaite.com/online/sportsgrid-com-to-be-acquired-by-rotoexperts-new-site-to-become-the-ultimate-sports-fantasy-destination/|title=SportsGrid.com To Be Acquired By RotoExperts, New Site To Become ‘The Ultimate Sports &amp; Fantasy Destination’|website=Mediaite.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, Anthem CEO [[Leonard Asper]] told the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' that the channel was expected to launch that September. He defended the network's concept by noting that "people thought 'How can there be an entire channel devoted to golf?' But now the [[Golf Channel]] is in 82 million homes", and that advertisers "leapt out of their chairs" when they learned that the network could appeal to both the traditional "[[baby boomer]]" demographic associated with fantasy sports, and the young male demographic that had also increasingly shown interest in fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2013/03/11/fantasy_sports_can_new_tv_network_find_an_audience_among_poolies.html|title=Fantasy Sports: Can new TV network find an audience among poolies?|last=Campbell|first=Morgan|date=2013-03-11|work=The Toronto Star|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-CA|issn=0319-0781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, it was reported that the channel, now named FNTSY Sports Network, was expected to launch in Canada and the United States in March 2014.&lt;ref name="Anthem Media CEO Asper Eyeing Launches in U.S. and Canada"&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/distribution/fantasy-sports-network-looks-become-reality-march/146994 Fantasy Sports Network Looks To Become a Reality In March] Multichannel.com 2013-12-03&lt;/ref&gt; On January 14, 2014, Anthem Media announced the launch date for the channel as March 4, 2014..&lt;ref name="Official launch press release"&gt;[http://rotoexperts.com/61381/press-release-worlds-first-fantasy-sports-tv-network-set-to-launch/ World’s First Fantasy Sports TV Network Set to Launch] RotoExperts.com 2014-01-14&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was initially expected to launch only in the U.S. on that date with the Canadian launch limited to only an [[mobile app|app]] and streaming online channel&lt;ref&gt;[https://cartt.ca/article/fantasy-sports-network-targets-march-launch Fantasy Sports Network targets March launch] Cartt.ca 2014-01-14&lt;/ref&gt; until January 29, 2014 when Anthem Media announced it will launch in Canada the same day as the U.S. through a carriage agreement with [[Manitoba Telecom Services|MTS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rotoexperts.com/62139/fantasy-sports-network-to-launch-on-mts-ultimate-tv-on-march-4-2014/ Fantasy Sports Network to Launch on MTS Ultimate TV on March 4, 2014] RotoExperts.com 2014-01-29&lt;/ref&gt; Three months after the channel's expected launch in the U.S., the channel officially launched in the U.S. on [[Cablevision]]'s Optimum TV service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/news/distribution/fight-network-fntsy-gain-first-us-berths-cablevision/375414 Fight Network, FNTSY Gain First US Berths With Cablevision] Multichannel News 06-26-2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a 20% interest in the channel was sold to a group of various unnamed investors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2016/2016-40.htm Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2016-40] CRTC 02 05 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fifth Down Game''' was a [[college football]] game that included a play that the crew officiating the game permitted to occur in error. That play enabled the [[1990 Colorado Buffaloes football team|Colorado Buffaloes]] to defeat the [[1990 Missouri Tigers football team|Missouri Tigers]] by scoring a touchdown on the last play of their game on October 6, 1990. The ensuing controversy cast doubt on Colorado's claim to [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]]-A's 1990 [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|national championship]], which it shares with the [[1990 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]]. It has been called one of the top memorable moments and blunders in college football history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/2002-11-19-memorable-moments_x.htm | title=College football's best of the last 20 years | publisher=USA Today | date=2002-11-19 | accessdate=2006-11-21 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201090031/http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/2002-11-19-memorable-moments_x.htm | archive-date=2005-12-01 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nd.edu/~tmandell/finishestable.html | title=HEART STOPPERS AND HAIL MARYS | author=Ted Mandell | publisher=Hardwood Press | format=Book/CD | date=2005-09-25 | accessdate=2006-11-21 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123094839/http://www.nd.edu/~tmandell/finishestable.html | archive-date=2006-11-23 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In [[American football]], a team is allowed four attempts or "[[Down (football)|downs]]" to move the ball {{convert|10|yd|m|2|sp=us}} towards the [[goal line (American football)|goal line]]. If the offense moves ten yards in four attempts or fewer, it gains a "first down," which restarts the process. If, after four attempts, the offense has neither scored nor gained ten yards, the other team is given possession of the ball. Under normal circumstances (for example, excluding penalties that can involve replaying a down), no team is supposed to be allowed five attempts. In this game, due to an officiating error, Colorado was given a fifth consecutive down, which they used to score the game-winning [[touchdown]] as time expired.

==Game recap==
The game pitted the Colorado Buffaloes (CU) against their [[Big Eight Conference]] rival, the Missouri Tigers (MU), and was played on October 6, 1990 in front of a crowd of 46,856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=3850&amp;SPID=255&amp;DB_OEM_ID=600&amp;ATCLID=291606 | title=No. 12 Colorado 33, Missouri 31 | publisher=CUBuffs.com | date=1990-10-06 | accessdate=2006-11-21 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606160809/http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=3850&amp;SPID=255&amp;DB_OEM_ID=600&amp;ATCLID=291606 | archive-date=2011-06-06 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was played at [[Faurot Field]], Missouri's home stadium in [[Columbia, Missouri]]. Colorado's starting [[quarterback]], [[Darian Hagan]], was injured and backup quarterback Charles Johnson,{{efn|name=two Charles Johnsons}} who had some playing time the previous week and season, played the game. However, Colorado was still heavily favored to win.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegefootball.rivals.com/content.asp?SID=1144&amp;CID=550162 |title=Johnson: Fifth Down was an Honest Mistake |author=Steve Megargee |publisher=Scout.com |date=2006-06-06 |accessdate=2006-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613162821/http://collegefootball.rivals.com/content.asp?SID=1144&amp;CID=550162 |archivedate=2006-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado was ranked #12 by the Associated Press in the nation while Missouri was unranked (i.e. below the top 25).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.appollarchive.com/football/ap/seasons.cfm?seasonid=1990&amp;appollid=674 |title=10/2/1990 AP Football Poll - AP Poll Archive - Historical College Football and Basketball Polls and Rankings&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2008-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002004621/http://www.appollarchive.com/football/ap/seasons.cfm?seasonid=1990&amp;appollid=674 |archive-date=2011-10-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado's record coming into the game was 3–1–1 (three wins, one loss, one tie) with wins over #12 [[1990 Washington Huskies football team|Washington]] and #20 [[1990 Texas Longhorns football team|Texas]] and unranked [[1990 Stanford Cardinal football team|Stanford]]; their loss to the #21 ranked [[1990 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]] team and the tie to #8 [[1990 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="CUSched"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cubuffs.com/SportSelect.dbml?SPSID=3850&amp;SPID=255&amp;DB_OEM_ID=600&amp;Q_SEASON=1990 | title=Football - 1990 Schedule/Results | publisher=CUBuffs.com | year=1990 | accessdate=2006-11-21 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831222953/http://www.cubuffs.com/SportSelect.dbml?SPSID=3850&amp;SPID=255&amp;DB_OEM_ID=600&amp;Q_SEASON=1990 | archive-date=2009-08-31 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Missouri was 2–2 (two wins, two losses) coming into the game with wins over #21 [[1990 Arizona State Sun Devils football team|Arizona State]] and unranked {{cfb link|year=1990|team=Utah State Aggies|title=Utah State}} and losses to unranked [[1990 TCU Horned Frogs football team|TCU]] and [[1990 Indiana Hoosiers football team|Indiana]].&lt;ref name="MUSched"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mutigers.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/fb-year-by-year-scores.html | title=FB Year By Year Scores | accessdate=2006-11-21 | publisher=CSTV.com | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214140543/http://mutigers.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/fb-year-by-year-scores.html | archive-date=2006-12-14 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lead in this game changed several times, and several big plays kept the momentum swinging. With less than three minutes to go, Colorado took possession of the ball deep in its own territory trailing 31–27. Johnson led the team on a last-ditch drive. With about 40 seconds to go, he completed a pass to Colorado [[tight end]] Jon Boman who fell down just yards short of the goal line. Boman slipped due to the poor conditions of the field, which saw the Buffaloes slip on the turf repeatedly throughout the game.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCSlip"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_n1_v221/ai_19006779 |title=Where have you gone, Ted Williams? - dubious sports feats |date=1997-01-06 |accessdate=2007-01-10 |publisher=Sporting News, The (via findarticles.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427032413/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_n1_v221/ai_19006779 |archivedate=2006-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This play gave the Buffaloes a first down, but it led to immediate confusion because the Buffs were running a [[hurry-up offense]].

On first down, Johnson [[Glossary of American football#S|spiked]] the ball to stop the clock. On the next play, with the down marker accurately indicating second down, a power run into the line by [[Eric Bieniemy]] was stopped just short of the goal line. Colorado then called its third and final timeout. During the timeout, the chain crew failed to flip the down marker to note that it was now third down. On the next play, with the down marker showing second down when it was really third down, the Buffaloes made the same call and Bieniemy was again stopped short of the end zone. Johnson then spiked the ball (thinking it was third down when it was really fourth) to stop the clock with two seconds left. He later claimed that he had no idea the officials had made a mistake, and believed he was spiking the ball on third down.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; On the following play – fourth down according to the marker, but "fifth down" in reality – Johnson kept the ball himself scored touchdown.

By this time, referee J. C. Louderback and his officiating crew had realized their mistake, and conferred for nearly 20 minutes to decide their course of action. During the delay, radio and television announcers also noticed that Colorado had scored with the help of an additional play. Louderback was shown on the phone. After a lengthy consultation, the referees announced their decision: the touchdown counted, giving Colorado a 33-31 lead. They also decided that the Buffs would have to attempt the extra point. The rules do not require the extra point try if time has expired and the result will not affect the outcome of the game. However, since Colorado only led by two, Missouri could have potentially blocked the try and returned it for two points to tie the game, the try was required. Not wanting to take this chance, Johnson took the snap and went to a knee, allowing the Buffaloes to go home with a controversial win.&lt;ref name="OT"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/2006-08-24-overtime_x.htm | title=Overtime system still excites coaches | publisher=USAToday.com | author=Kelly Whiteside | date=2006-08-24 | accessdate=2006-11-21 | archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5lWmbTL3G?url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/2006-08-24-overtime_x.htm | archive-date=2009-11-24 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somewhat overshadowed by the "5th down" was the fact that replays seemed to show Johnson had actually been stopped short of the goal line on his touchdown run.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espn.com/blog/ncfnation/post/_/id/117195/five-things-you-should-know-on-the-25th-anniversary-of-the-fifth-down-game&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Colorado football coach [[Bill McCartney]], a former Missouri Tigers player, did little to soothe the controversy. Asked whether he would consider [[wikt:forfeit|forfeiting]] the game, McCartney declared that he had considered it but decided against it because "the field was lousy." He complained about Missouri's notorious [[Omniturf]] [[artificial turf]] surface, which he said had caused repeated slips and falls during the game.&lt;ref name="McCSlip" /&gt;

Missouri chancellor [[Haskell Monroe]] appealed to the Big Eight, arguing that since Colorado's game-winning touchdown had come on a play that should have never been run, Missouri should be declared the winner 31-27. However, he was rebuffed by Big Eight commissioner Carl James, who said in a statement that "the allowance of the fifth down to Colorado is not a post-game correctable error," and therefore Colorado's win would stand.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3D71338F93AA35753C1A966958260|title=College Football; Colorado Victory Stands - New York Times|accessdate=2007-08-07|work=The New York Times|date=1990-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112103927/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3D71338F93AA35753C1A966958260|archive-date=2007-11-12|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some closure came in the summer of 1998—four years after McCartney retired as the Buffs' head coach—when he admitted to making mistakes and being saddened by the Fifth Down fiasco. McCartney made the remarks at a [[Promise Keepers]] gathering at the site of the controversy in Columbia, Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/news/1998/06/20/mccartney_fifthdown/ | title=McCartney 'remorseful' about fifth-down play | author=AP | publisher=CNN.com | date=1998-06-20 | accessdate=2006-11-21 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604150408/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/news/1998/06/20/mccartney_fifthdown/ | archive-date=2011-06-04 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Colorado was allowed to keep the win, Louderback and his entire crew were suspended indefinitely following the contest.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt;

==National championship==
{{See also|College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS}}
Prior to the creation of the [[Bowl Coalition]] in 1992, no mechanism existed to arrange postseason bowl matchups to better determine a champion; conference bowl contracts would often yield the top four to six teams in the country playing in entirely separate bowls.  In the early 1990s, two polls were regarded as authoritative: A poll of sportswriters conducted by the [[Associated Press]] (AP) called the [[AP Poll]], and a poll of college football coaches conducted by the [[American Football Coaches Association]] called the [[Coaches Poll]]. These polls were conducted weekly during the football season, and the final polls (in January, after all [[bowl game]]s) determined the championship.

Because 1990 was a year in which no single college football team was dominant, the Fifth Down controversy played a role in determining the Division I-A national champion for the 1990 season. Most pollsters dropped Colorado's ranking to 14th, apparently feeling that its win over Missouri was not legitimate. However, most of the top teams lost in subsequent weeks, while the Buffaloes won their remaining games, including a 27-12 victory in Lincoln over #3 [[1990 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] to give them the Big Eight title, and a squeaker over #5 [[1990 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]]. The [[1991 Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] victory over Notre Dame was considered very controversial as well, due to a [[Penalty (American football)#Clipping|clipping]] call on Notre Dame on a [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] return touchdown late in the game by [[Raghib Ismail]] when Colorado held a 10-9 lead, which would be the final score after Notre Dame was assessed the penalty. A blocked [[extra point]] by Colorado turned out to be the winning margin.

Colorado finished the 1990 season with a record of 11–1–1,&lt;ref name="CUSched" /&gt; while the [[1990 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets']] record was 11–0–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://graphics.fansonly.com/photos/schools/geot/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/06-mg-scores.pdf | title=2006 Georgia Tech Media Guide | publisher=RAMBLINWRECK.com | accessdate=2007-01-02 | year=2006 | format=PDF | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927183353/http://graphics.fansonly.com/photos/schools/geot/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/06-mg-scores.pdf | archive-date=2007-09-27 | dead-url=no | df= }}, page 188&lt;/ref&gt; No Division I-A team had an unblemished record, and only Georgia Tech finished without a loss.&lt;ref name="OT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NCAA football rules permitted ties in 1990. Subsequent rule changes in 1996 introduced overtime play, so that all games since then are victories for one team or the other.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the conclusion of the [[1990 NCAA Division I-A football season|1990 season]] in January 1991, the AP Poll voted Colorado national champions. The Coaches Poll voted the championship to Georgia Tech. Both universities therefore claim the 1990 championship. Observers favoring Colorado for the national championship noted that they had played a more difficult schedule than Georgia Tech. Those favoring Georgia Tech not only pointed out that the Yellow Jackets were the only undefeated team in the nation, but also pointed to the tainted victory in the "Fifth Down" game. With a loss at Missouri, Colorado record would have been 10–2–1, and the Buffaloes may not have been as strongly considered for the national title with that record. Colorado was also less convincing in its bowl game, needing a controversial clipping call to defeat Notre Dame by 1 point while Georgia Tech was not challenged in its bowl win.  No team had ever been voted National Champion in either the Associated Press Poll or the Coaches' Poll following a season in which they lost or tied more than two games total (eventually occurred following the [[2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2007 season]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.collegefootballpoll.com/champions_national.html | title=NCAA College Football National Champions | publisher=CollegeFootballPoll.com | accessdate=2007-02-24 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708175404/http://www.collegefootballpoll.com/champions_national.html | archivedate=2011-07-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Missouri ended the 1990 season with a record of 4-7. The Tigers had not had a winning season since 1983, and would not have another winning season until 1997 under [[Larry Smith (football coach)|Larry Smith]]. They would not return to consistent contender status until the middle of the 2000s under [[Gary Pinkel]]. The surface at Faurot Field was changed to natural grass in 1995, and in 2003 to [[FieldTurf]], a rubber-infilled artificial turf that closely simulates grass.

The Colorado-Missouri series went dormant after the Buffaloes left the Big 12 for the [[Pac-12 Conference]] on July 1, 2011. The Tigers departed the Big 12 on July 1, 2012 to join the [[Southeastern Conference]].

==Precedents==
Similar events had occurred in college football prior to Colorado's Fifth Down. Until 1990, the phrase "Fifth Down Game" described the [[Fifth Down Game (1940)|Dartmouth-Cornell game]] of 1940, which is the first occurrence of a fifth down in college football.

During a 1968 [[National Football League]] game between the [[Chicago Bears]] and [[Los Angeles Rams]], the Rams were victimized when they ''lost'' a down. The Rams were penalized for holding during a last-minute drive.  The officiating crew not only assessed the 15-yard penalty, but also advanced the down marker from first to second. Holding does not carry a loss of down under the rules.  Nobody in the press box or on the field noticed, and the Rams turned the ball over on downs, their last possession in a 17-16 loss.

In [[1972 college football season|1972]], the [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]] was the beneficiary of a "fifth down" in its game against [[Tulane Green Wave football|Tulane]]. Officials mistakenly called the Miami offense back on the field for another down after it had turned the ball over on downs. Miami scored a touchdown on the next play to win the game, 24–21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/14/sports/view-of-sport-fifth-down-or-not-it-s-over-when-it-s-over.html|title=Fifth Down or Not, It's Over When It's Over|last=Nelson|first=David M.|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-10-14|date=1990-10-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819090934/http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/14/sports/view-of-sport-fifth-down-or-not-it-s-over-when-it-s-over.html|archive-date=2014-08-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifth downs have occurred at least one other time as well, without changing the outcome of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-tYKqYHibB0C&amp;pg=PA191&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;dq=OSU+wisconsin+5th+down&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xS9bJKTU72&amp;sig=z1CkZM2cnjIr_eY_Qi6Tn4HG9kQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=z1TBSsvdLYKwswOrruDKAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#v=onepage&amp;q=fifth%20down&amp;f=false | title=The Official Ohio State Football Encyclopedia | author=Jack Park | publisher=N.p.: Sports Publishing LLC |page=191 | accessdate=2009-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Two players named Charles Johnson played in this game for Colorado. One of these, the backup quarterback in the 1990 season, played the entire 1990 Fifth Down game as a substitute for Darian Hagan. However, this player never played in the NFL.

The other [[Charles Johnson (wide receiver, born 1972)|Charles Johnson]] was a wide receiver in the 1990 season.

It appeared that Johnson never actually made it into the end zone before the play was called dead by the referee. A series of photos shown in the ''Columbia Daily Tribune'' on October 7, 1990 showed Johnson was on his back with the ball well short of the goal line on the 5th down play and then lifted the ball over the goal line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matter|first1=Dave|title=Fifth Down Is A Play That Will Live In Infamy|url=http://www.columbiatribune.com/sports/mu_football/fifth-down-is-a-play-that-will-live-in-infamy/article_1e26bb97-96a9-5be8-b658-e51dedd73f89.html|work=Columbia Tribune|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans at the goal line also said he was tackled short of the goal line and the ball didn't cross the goal line until after the play was blown dead.

{{Figure skating at the 1920 Summer Olympics}}

The '''[[single skating|women's individual skating]]''' event held as part of the [[figure skating at the 1920 Summer Olympics]]. It was the second appearance of the event and the sport, which had previously been held in 1908.

Six skaters from four nations competed. Despite receiving no first place votes from the judges in the women's singles, [[Magda Julin]] of Sweden captured the gold on the strength of three second-place ordinals. She was three months pregnant at the time.

[[Theresa Weld]] caused a minor controversy by performing jumps such as [[salchow jump|salchows]] and [[loop jump|loops]], the only woman in the event to do any jumps beyond modest hops. She was told that such jumps were not considered suitable for a lady's program and that some judges marked down as a result.&lt;ref&gt;"The Olympics: 1920, 1924, and 1928", ''Skating'' magazine, December 1959&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|right|Freelines1.jpg|180|Freelines2.jpg|180|&lt;center&gt;Detail of the Freeline skates.&lt;/center&gt;}}
'''Freeline skates''' are a pair of skates designed to give the feeling of [[skateboarding]], [[snowboarding]], [[surfing]], and [[inline skates]] all in one.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} They consist of two separate metal or wooden plates with two wheels attached by a form of “truck” designed specifically for the skates.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} The technique used to skate with Freelines is unique to the skates, and is a challenging wave-like motion.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The individual skates, when ridden together, produce speed, agility, and natural self-propulsion, enabling uphill motion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

== History ==
Freeline skates were developed in 2003 in San Francisco, California when Ryan Farrelly was attempting to design a better way for downhill skating. His prototype for the skates was a row of four wheels in the center of a wooden board. After test runs and adaptations, Farrelly realized he could simply stand on each set of wheels and not bother with a board. The skates combine elements of both skateboarding and in-line skating, and can be ridden on flat land as well as downhill or uphill. Out of this idea, Freeline skates were born.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.surfshot.com/Product+News/Freeline+Skates-152367.html&lt;/ref&gt; There are also other companies that exist to support the skating community. Since Freeline Sports went bankrupt and shut down in 2015, rider Mattie Tyce helped to set up JMKRide, who sell a similar skate. Professional skaters in Japan call the sport free skates and in Taiwan prefer drift skates after Freeline skates departure from the scene, in order to pull the identity away from the brand. The term sideskating was also attempted to be popularized. The popularity of the original Freeline Skates brand style though, has left most people still calling it freeline skating. &lt;ref&gt;http://freelineskatingz.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;http://ameblo.jp/fls-shiga/entry-12052503210.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gtank.com.tw/&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Skurfing_(sport)#Street_Skurfing|Street Skurfing]])

== Models ==
There are currently three different models of Freeline skates:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freelineskates.com/store/c-1-skates.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
* Freeline OG - the original model, made out of reinforced aluminum.
* Freeline Pro - a hybrid model consisting of the traditional "S-frame"-style truck and a redesigned wood deck. Freeline Pro is actually supported by two C-shaped steel rods arranged into an S-shape outer skin.
* Freeline Cruiser/GROM - a newer, light-weight model designed for beginners, which supports a set of training wheels (Cruiser has 72mm and GROM 65mm wheels).

'''Hanover Insurance Park at Fitton Field''' is a baseball stadium in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. Primarily used for [[College of the Holy Cross]] sporting events, the baseball stadium also served as the home field for the [[Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball|Can-Am League]] [[Worcester Tornadoes]], and the current home of the [[Futures Collegiate Baseball League]] [[Worcester Bravehearts]]. The stadium is named after [[James Fitton (priest)|Reverend James Fitton]], who donated land to the [[Archdiocese of Boston]] to found the college.&lt;ref name="GoHolyCross" /&gt;

The baseball stadium lacks any outfield bleachers due to [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 290]] and the football field being adjacent to it.

The Holy Cross baseball team began playing at what was known as Fitton Field in 1905. Previously, they had played at both [[Worcester Agricultural Fairgrounds|Worcester Driving Park Grounds]] and the [[Worcester Oval]].&lt;ref name="GoHolyCross" /&gt; The field became baseball-only following the 1924 renovation of the football field. The stadium was upgraded in 2005 when the Worcester Tornadoes made it their home, they changed the name, and upgraded the seating and lighting of the stadium, which has a capacity of approximately 3,000 spectators.

[[Lou Gehrig]] played a game at Fitton Field in 1922 as a sophomore for [[Columbia University]]. [[Babe Ruth]] played at Fitton Field for the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] in a 1935 exhibition game against Holy Cross.&lt;ref name="Bravehearts"&gt;{{cite web |title=Worcester Bravehearts: Hanover Insurance Park |url=http://www.worcesterbravehearts.com/schedule/hanover-insurance-park/ |website=WorcesterBravehearts.com |publisher=Worcester Bravehearts |accessdate=August 18, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1939 exhibition game between Holy Cross and the [[Boston Red Sox]], [[Ted Williams]] hit his first [[home run]] in a Red Sox uniform.&lt;ref name="williamsfirst"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mallaghan |first=Brianne |title=Holy Cross Celebrates Fitton Field's 100th Anniversary |url=http://goholycross.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/041905aaa.html |website=GoHolyCross.com |publisher=College of the Holy Cross |accessdate=July 7, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623212834/http://goholycross.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/041905aaa.html |archivedate=June 23, 2015 |date=April 19, 2005 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Fitton Field hosted the [[100 Inning Game]] benefit for [[Curt Schilling|Curt Schilling's]] charity, Curt's Pitch for [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]].&lt;ref name="Bravehearts" /&gt;

The '''history of [[collegiate wrestling]]''' can be traced to the many indigenous styles of [[folk wrestling]] found in [[Europe]], particularly in [[Great Britain]]. Those folk wrestling styles soon gained popularity in what would become the [[United States]], and by the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] those styles, especially [[freestyle wrestling]], emerged in gymnasiums and athletic clubs throughout the country. From then on, tournaments were sponsored and a professional circuit of wrestlers helped promote wrestling and kickboxing in the United States and throughout the world. 

By the end of the 19th century, the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] was sponsoring competitions in freestyle wrestlkand by the start of the 20th century, colleges and universities were competing in dual meets and tournaments, and such events spread to [[high school]]s and lower age levels. During the 20th century, collegiate wrestling evolved into a distinctly [[United States|American]] sport which was soon regulated by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)]].

== Wrestling in the American early colonial era ==
[[File:Burns Half-nelson.jpg|thumb|225px|A 1913 publication by [[Farmer Burns]] illustrated basic wrestling techniques around the time that [[collegiate wrestling]] in the [[United States]] was becoming widespread. The [[Nelson hold#Half nelson|half nelson]] is pictured here.]]
The roots of [[collegiate wrestling]] can be traced back almost as far as the earliest moments in [[History of the United States|United States history]]. There were already wrestling styles among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] varying from tribe and nation by the 15th and 16th centuries, when the first [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] settled. The [[English people|English]] and [[French people|French]] who settled on the North American continent sought out wrestling as a popular pastime. Soon, there were local champions in every settlement, with contests between them on a regional level. The colonists in what would become the [[United States]] started out with something more akin to [[Greco-Roman wrestling]], but soon found that style too restrictive in favor of a style which a greater allowance of holds.&lt;ref name=DellingerBobWrestling&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In the backcountry of [[Virginia]] and the [[Carolinas]], wrestling contests were among the favorite athletic events of [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] colonists. The brutality of the matches was so great that the Assembly of Virginia had to legislate against illegal holds by prohibiting "maiming 'by gouging, plunking or putting out an eye, biting, kicking or stomping upon'" an opponent. In the backcountry, these rules and laws were largely ignored.&lt;ref&gt;''Sports in the Western World'' by William J. Baker, p. 96 (Totowa, NJ: Rowman and Littlefield, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Irish people|Irish]] were known for their "collar-and-elbow" style, in which wrestlers at the start of the match would grasp each other by the collar with one hand and by the elbow with the other. From this position, wrestlers sought to achieve a fall. If no fall occurred, the wrestlers would continue grappling both standing on their feet and on the ground until a fall was made. Irish [[immigrants]] later brought this style to the [[United States]] where it soon became widespread. There was also what became known as "catch-as-catch-can" wrestling, which had a particular following in [[Great Britain]] and the variant developed in [[Lancashire]] had a particular effect on future [[freestyle wrestling]] in particular.&lt;ref name=PoliakoffFreestyle1190&gt;"Wrestling, Freestyle" by Michael B. Poliakoff from ''Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present'', Vol. 3, p. 1190, eds. David Levinson and Karen Christensen (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; In catch-as-catch-can wrestling, both contestants started out standing and then a wrestler sought to hold his opponent's shoulder to the ground (known as a fall). If no fall was scored, both wrestlers continued grappling on the ground, and almost all holds and techniques were allowable. A [[Scotland|Scottish]] variant of Lancashire wrestling also became popular, that began with both wrestlers standing chest to chest, grasping each other with locked arms around the body, and if no fall was made, with a match continuing on the ground.&lt;ref name="PoliakoffFreestyle1190" /&gt;

== Wrestling in the 18th- and 19th-century United States ==
By the 18th century, wrestling soon became recognized as a legitimate spectator sport, despite its roughness. It was the major physical contact sport among men of all classes, as [[boxing]] did not catch on until the 19th century.&lt;ref name="DellingerBobWrestling" /&gt; Among those who were well known for their wrestling techniques were several [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]]. [[George Washington]] was known to have had a wrestling championship in [[Virginia]] in the collar-and-elbow style that was county-wide and possibly colony-wide. At the age of 47, before he became President, Washington was still able to defeat seven challengers from the Massachusetts Volunteers. [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Zachary Taylor]], who favored wrestling as an army sport during his days in the Illinois Volunteers, were also well known for their wrestling.&lt;ref name="DellingerBobWrestling" /&gt; [[Abraham Lincoln]], as a 21-year-old in 1830, was the wrestling champion of his county in [[Illinois]]. At this time, where working at a store in [[Lincoln's New Salem|New Salem, Illinois]], Lincoln had a famous bout with Jack Armstrong, also a county wrestling champion. Lincoln won decisively when, after losing his temper when Armstrong began fouling him, he slammed Armstrong to the ground and knocked him out. Two years later, while serving as a captain in the Illinois Volunteers during the [[Black Hawk War]], Lincoln lost his only recorded match to a soldier in another unit by fall. Wrestling was also practiced by [[Andrew Johnson]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], [[Chester A. Arthur]], and [[Theodore Roosevelt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; who always had an inclination to anything that involved physical exercise and did regular wrestling workouts throughout his service as [[Governor of New York]].&lt;ref name="DellingerBobWrestling" /&gt; [[William Howard Taft]] who was the heaviest of the Presidents at his "best weight" of 225&amp;nbsp;lb wrestled collar-and-elbow and was also the [[intramural]] [[heavyweight]] wrestling champion at [[Yale University]]. [[Calvin Coolidge]] was described as a "tolerable good" wrestler by his father until around age 14 when he took to "duding around and daydreaming about being a big-city lawyer."&lt;ref name="DellingerBobWrestling" /&gt; 

Wrestlers such as Abraham Lincoln did not settle for the collar-and-elbow as much as in a free-for-all style of wrestling that was widespread on the frontier.&lt;ref name="DellingerBobWrestling" /&gt; Since "catch-as-catch-can" wrestling was very similar, it gained great popularity in fairs and festivals in the United States during the 19th century.&lt;ref name="PoliakoffFreestyle1190" /&gt; The collar-and-elbow style was also refined by later Irish immigrants, and gained great ground because of the success of [[George William Flagg]] from [[Vermont]], the wrestling champion of the [[Army of the Potomac]]. After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], [[freestyle wrestling]] began to emerge as a distinct sport, and soon spread rapidly in the United States. Professional wrestling also emerged in the late 19th century (not like the "sports-entertainment" seen today). At the time of the first New York Athletic Club tournament in 1878 professional championship wrestling matches "offered purses of up to $1,000."&lt;ref name="PoliakoffFreestyle1190" /&gt; By the 1880s, American wrestling became organized, with matches often being conducted alongside [[gymnastic]] meets and [[boxing]] tournaments in athletic clubs. The first national competition took place in 1887, with L. Chenowith of the Pastime Athletic Club winning the only weight class at 134&amp;nbsp;lb. The next year the [[Amateur Athletic Union|Amateur Athletic Union (AAU)]] sanctioned its first national tournament, and soon became recognized as the governing body of American wrestling.&lt;ref name="DellingerBobWrestling" /&gt; The first college student-athlete to win a national championship was [[Winchester Osgood]], a football player at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], who won the 1895 National AAU Championship at the heavyweight division (then for wrestlers over 158&amp;nbsp;lb). Wrestling before the 20th century was dominated largely by independent athletic clubs and not by educational institutions. Prominent athletic clubs with wrestling teams included the National Turnverein of [[Newark, New Jersey]], the Schuylkill Navy Athletic Club, St. George's Athletic Club, the Chicago Central YMCA, the Olympic Club of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], as well as various athletic clubs associated with ethnic groups such as the Chicago Hebrew Association. The National Turnverein produced [[George Mehnert|George Nicholas Mehnert]], who won six national AAU championships between 1902 and 1908 and lost only one of more than 100 matches to [[George Dole]], then a student at [[Yale University]]. Mehnert was also a gold medalist at the Olympics of 1904 and 1908.&lt;ref name="DellingerBobWrestling" /&gt; Despite wrestling not yet being regulated by [[college]]s and [[university|universities]], hundreds of participants attended wrestling tournaments. The growth of cities, industrialization, and the closing of the frontier provided the necessary avenue for sports such as wrestling to increase in popularity.&lt;ref name="PoliakoffFreestyle1190" /&gt;

==The 20th Century: American wrestling becomes "Collegiate"==
[[File:Oldschoolwrestling1993-1994.jpg|thumb|275px|left|A [[high school]] wrestling match from around the 1993-94 school year.]]
In 1903, the first intercollegiate dual meet took place between [[Yale Bulldogs|Yale University]] and [[Columbia Lions|Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;"1903-1927" by Jairus K. Hammond ''The History of Collegiate Wrestling'', p. 1,(Stillwater OK: National Wrestling Hall of Fame, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Yale News'' February 27, 1903, p. 3 (New Haven CT: 1903).&lt;/ref&gt; Under the leadership of wrestling coaches [[Charles Mayser]] at [[Iowa State Cyclones wrestling|Iowa State University]], [[William "Billy" Sheridan]] from [[Lehigh Mountain Hawks|Lehigh University]], [[Raymond G. Clapp|Dr. Raymond G. Clapp]] from the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers wrestling|University of Nebraska]], and [[Hugo M. Otopalik]] at Iowa State University, collegiate wrestling began to gain ground in varsity athletics.&lt;ref name="DellingerBobWrestling" /&gt; The [[Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association]] held its first tournament in 1905, which soon sparked many more wrestling tournaments for both [[college]] and [[university]] students and [[high school]] students. The Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association remained under student leadership for over 30 years.&lt;ref name=PoliakoffFreestyle1191&gt;"Wrestling, Freestyle" by Michael B. Poliakoff from ''Encyclopedia of World Sport: From Ancient Times to the Present'', Vol. 3, p. 1191, eds. David Levinson and Karen Christensen (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, Inc., 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Clark Gallagher]], a [[College football|football]] and [[track and field]] athlete at Oklahoma A&amp;M College (now [[Oklahoma State University–Stillwater]]), launched wrestling as an official varsity sport just before [[World War I]] and with [[Oklahoma State Cowboys wrestling|his team]] launched a dynasty, with undefeated matches from 1921-1931. When Oklahoma A&amp;M hosted the national AAU championship in 1925, Gallagher's varsity team won the team championship. Also, his junior varsity teams and unattached entries placed second. The two groups won almost all of the medals at that championship.&lt;ref name="DellingerBobWrestling" /&gt; 

In 1927, Clapp published the rules for collegiate wrestling, and the next year, the first [[NCAA Wrestling Team Championship]] took place on March 30 to March 31 on the campus of [[Iowa State University|Iowa State College]]. 40 wrestlers from 16 colleges participated, and it was among the first national championships sponspored by the [[NCAA]], the second national championship after outdoor [[track and field]] in 1921 (and the third postseason NCAA meet after both outdoor track and field and [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] in 1924).&lt;ref&gt;''NCAA: The Voice of College Sports: A Diamond Anniversary History, 1906-1981'' by Jack Falla, pp. 171, 179, 180, 194-195, 199-200 (Mission, KS: National Collegiate Athletic Association, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oklahoma State University]] won that first championship, which was an unofficial one, and later won the first official championship in 1929. Oklahoma State would win 27 of the first 45 Wrestling Team Championships in the Division I category, including seven straight between 1937 and 1946. In 1953, [[Penn State Nittany Lions wrestling|Penn State University]] became the first team outside of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] to be awarded the national championship. One of the prominent champions during that period was [[Myron Roderick]] who won three straight individual championship as a wrestler at Oklahoma State (from 1954 to 1956. Later as a coach, Roderick would lead his teams to seven championships between 1958 and 1968.&lt;ref name=NCAADiamondAnniversaryHistory195&gt;''NCAA: The Voice of College Sports: A Diamond Anniversary History, 1906-1981'' by Jack Falla, p. 195 (Mission, KS: National Collegiate Athletic Association, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules of collegiate wrestling developed by Raymond G. Clapp, which were eventually adopted by the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association, marked a sharp contrast to the freestyle wrestling rules of the [[United World Wrestling|International Amateur Wrestling Federation]] (IAWF; now known as United World Wrestling) and the [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]].&lt;ref name="PoliakoffFreestyle1191" /&gt; From then on, collegiate wrestling emerged as a distinctly American sport. Yet American collegiate wrestlers made smooth transitions in the international styles, being able to win Olympic medals in freestyle wrestling at various games.&lt;ref name="DellingerBobWrestling" /&gt; College and high school wrestling grew especially after the standardization of the NCAA wrestling rules, which applied early on to both collegiate and scholastic wrestling (with high school modifications). More colleges, universities, and junior colleges began offering dual meets and tournaments, including championships and having organized wrestling seasons. There were breaks in wrestling seasons because of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], but in the high schools especially, state association wrestling championships sprung up in different regions throughout the 1930s and 1940s. As amateur wrestling grew after World War II, various collegiate athletic conferences also increased the number and quality of their wrestling competition. The pattern soon developed in which more wrestlers would make the progression of wrestling in high school, being recruited by college coaches, and then entering collegiate competition.

For most of the 20th century, collegiate wrestling was the most popular form of [[amateur wrestling]] in the country, especially in the [[Midwest]] and the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]].&lt;ref name="DellingerBobWrestling" /&gt; Wrestling matches in the United States were early on particularly long, particularly among those in the [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman style]]. The matches most often took place in rings that were 20 feet square and set apart by three ropes. Some schools, such as Oklahoma State University, even had the wrestling rings raised on a platform, much like that of a boxing ring.&lt;ref name=PalmerRevRewindMajorChanges&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rules of the AAU called for the referee to determine a winner after 15 minutes of wrestling if no fall occurred, the matches of the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association were finished by falls, even if it meant an hour or more of wrestling. By 1911, collegiate wrestling rules allowed the referee to determine a win in the absence of a fall after 15 minutes. The time limits have steadily decreased over the years of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="PoliakoffFreestyle1191" /&gt; Yet for more than forty years into the 20th century, freestyle and its American counterpart collegiate wrestling did not have a scoring system. The introduction of a point system by Oklahoma A&amp;M&lt;!--Didn't become Oklahoma State until 1957.--&gt; wrestling coach Art Griffith that gained acceptance in 1941 influenced the international styles as well. The following year, collegiate wrestling would mandatorily take place on open mats laid flat on the gymnasium floor; the rings and ropes were now illegal. This further made collegiate wrestling distinct from its professional counterpart, which would soon become more entertainment than sport.&lt;ref name="PalmerRevRewindMajorChanges" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The 1960s and 1970s saw major developments in collegiate wrestling, with the emergence of the United States Wrestling Federation (USWF) (later called the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) and now known as [[USA Wrestling|USA Wrestling (USAW)]]). The USWF, with its membership of coaches, educators, and officials, became recognized eventually as the official governing body of American wrestling and as the official representative to the [[United States Olympic Committee]], in place of the [[Amateur Athletic Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, the [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] wrestling team championship was established in 1963. [[Western State Colorado Mountaineers|Western State (Colorado)]] won the first team championship in that division. The [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] wrestling team championship was established in 1974 with [[Wilkes University]] winning the first team championship.&lt;ref name="NCAADiamondAnniversaryHistory195" /&gt;[[File:Wrestling falconfrenzy056.jpg|thumb|right|275px|In the 20th century, collegiate wrestling became the most popular form of [[amateur wrestling]] in the [[United States]].]] Collegiate wrestlers in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s as usual made strides in the international styles, but were more well known for their scholastic and collegiate wrestling achievements. These wrestlers include [[Dan Gable]], who won the Olympic gold medal in 1972 and was the Olympic freestyle coach in 1984, but was more famous for his 15 team championships as coach at the [[Iowa Hawkeyes wrestling|University of Iowa]]. [[John Smith (wrestler)|John Smith]] also won gold medals at the [[Goodwill Games]] against a Soviet in Moscow and at the [[Wrestling at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] in 1988 and 1992. He is best known however for his two [[NCAA]] championships and his 90 straight victories for [[Oklahoma State Cowboys wrestling|Oklahoma State University]], where he later became a championship-winning coach.&lt;ref name="DellingerBobWrestling" /&gt; Ed and Lou Banach together won five individual [[NCAA]] championships for Iowa and were able to win gold medals at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]]. [[Wade Schalles]] of [[Clarion Golden Eagles wrestling|Clarion University]] earned a record of 821 victories, with 530 falls, which earned him a place in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as amateur wrestling's "all-time winning and pinning leader."&lt;ref name="DellingerBobWrestling" /&gt; Other high-achieving collegiate wrestlers who have had national, international, and [[Olympic wrestling]] championship careers include [[Robin Reed]], [[Kenny Monday]], [[Cael Sanderson]], [[Temoer Terry]], [[Bruce Baumgartner]], and [[Kurt Angle]] (who would also become a major star in [[professional wrestling]]).

Today, on the collegiate level, several universities are known for regularly having competitive wrestling teams. The [[Iowa Hawkeyes]] ([[University of Iowa]]) [[Iowa Hawkeyes wrestling|wrestling team]], the [[Oklahoma State Cowboys]] ([[Oklahoma State University]]) [[Oklahoma State Cowboys wrestling|wrestling team]], the [[Iowa State Cyclones]] ([[Iowa State University]]) [[Iowa State Cyclones wrestling|wrestling team]], and the [[Oklahoma Sooners]] ([[University of Oklahoma]]) [[Oklahoma Sooners wrestling|wrestling team]] are four of the most storied and honored programs in the country and have won the majority of NCAA wrestling team championships. Other wrestling programs that were or are at the top include the wrestling teams of the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers]] ([[University of Minnesota]]), [[Ohio State Buckeyes]] ([[Ohio State University]]), the [[Oregon State Beavers]] ([[Oregon State University]]), the [[Lehigh Mountain Hawks]] ([[Lehigh University]]), the [[Penn State Nittany Lions]] ([[Pennsylvania State University]]), the [[Pittsburgh Panthers wrestling|Pittsburgh Panthers]] ([[University of Pittsburgh]]), the now-defunct [[Omaha Mavericks]] ([[University of Nebraska Omaha]]), the [[Northwestern Wildcats]] ([[Northwestern University]]), the [[Northern Iowa Panthers]] ([[University of Northern Iowa]]), [[Augsburg College]], and [[Wartburg College]]. Collegiate wrestling teams compete for the [[NCAA Wrestling Team Championship|NCAA wrestling]] championship each year. The NCAA awards individual championships in the 10 weight classes, as well as a team title. The [[Dan Gable]] International Wrestling Institute and Museum is located in [[Waterloo, Iowa]]. The Oklahoma State campus in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma|Stillwater]], [[Oklahoma]] is host to the [[National Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum]]. Today, the various state high school associations also host annual wrestling championships for individuals and for teams.

'''Iloilo Sports Complex''', also known as the '''Iloilo Sports Center''' is a multi-use [[sports complex]] in [[La Paz, Iloilo City|La Paz]], [[Iloilo City]], [[Philippines]] and is the venue of athletic events in [[Iloilo]] province and [[Western Visayas]] and occasionally hosts large gatherings such as concerts. Its main stadium has a seating capacity of 7,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kaya FC moves to Iloilo|url=http://visayandailystar.com/2018/February/08/sportnews2.htm|accessdate=14 February 2018|work=The Visayan Daily Star|date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An indoor [[gym]]nasium is located 200 meters away from the main site.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The athletics track underwent repair in 2014 which costed {{Philippine peso|100 thousand}} though it had to be rehabilitated again due to the number of sporting events hosted by the venue.

'''John "Little Joey" Ring''' (1758 at Darenth, [[Kent]] – 25 October 1800 at Bridge, Kent) was an English [[cricket]]er who played for [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]].

Joey Ring was one of Kent’s best batsmen in the late 18th century and was employed by [[Sir Horatio Mann]] at Bourne as a huntsman. He originally came from the Dartford area.

He was noted for his play to leg and was a good single-wicket player.

Ring is believed to have been a cricketing fatality. It seems that his nose was broken in the summer of 1800 by a practice ball bowled by his brother George. Ring became ill and was bedridden for several weeks before dying on 25 October, evidently of a fever that developed as a result of his accident.

Joey Ring made 90 known first-class appearances from 1782 until 1796 when he seems to have withdrawn from major matches.

The '''Kenya National Sevens Circuit''' (NSC) is a series of [[Rugby union sevens|seven-a-side]] competitions that take place in various towns and cities in the major [[Rugby union|rugby]] playing parts of [[Kenya|the country]] after the end of the regular 15-a-side season.  Kenya has a long history of seven-a-side tournaments dating back to the earliest days of rugby in the [[Kenya Colony|colony]]; with the growing popularity of Sevens resulting from the disproportionate success of the [[Kenya national rugby sevens team|national team]] on the [[IRB Sevens World Series|world stage]], it was decided that several of the more prestigious tournaments should be gathered into a single competition.  In addition, at the same time, a Schools Sevens Championship was introduced to ensure a consistent conveyor-belt of the nation's best talent.

Previously the tournaments took place at the end of the regular season in November and December (Kenya straddles the [[Equator]] but the country has always aligned with the [[Southern Hemisphere]] rugby season) but as of 2010, following a complete restructure of the rugby calendar throughout [[East Africa]], the tournaments now occur in August and September.

| &lt;small&gt; The tournament is named after former Kenya Harlequin Chairman, Alex Christie (also Vice President of [[Wasps RFC|Wasps FC]] in [[London]] and President of the [[Rugby Football Union of East Africa|RFUEA]]) and is regarded as the longest running sevens tournament in Kenya, having been played every year since 1962. &lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt; [[Kisumu]] is regarded by many Kenyans as home because many people in Nairobi either left Kisumu to find work in the capital or are descended from people who did.  ''Dala'' means ''home'' in the [[Luo language|Luo]] language that is spoken on the eastern shores of [[Lake Victoria]].&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt; The [[Driftwood Beach Club]], [[Malindi]], donated the trophy (appropriately, a piece of [[driftwood]] shaped by the winds, waves and currents of the [[Indian Ocean]]) and asked that their sevens tournament from the early 1970s be revived.&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt; Named for of former Mwamba player George Mwangi Kabeberi who died in 1986.&lt;/small&gt;
| &lt;small&gt; Named after Peter Walter Prinsloo, a rugby player from South Africa who - after moving to [[Nakuru]] - reignited interest in the game in the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Rift Valley]] during the 1980s.&lt;/small&gt;

The first seven-a-side competition in Kenya was the 1937 RAF Sevens.  The cup for this annual competition was presented by [[No. 223 Squadron RAF|223 Squadron]], [[Royal Air Force]] and the competition was open to all clubs in East Africa (i.e. within [[Kenya Colony]], [[Uganda Protectorate]] and [[Tanganyika Territory]]) and any other combination of players who wished to enter a team.  The tournament was usually played over the [[August Bank Holiday]] weekend and was a very popular addition to the Kenya rugby and Nairobi social calendars.&lt;ref name="Rugby in EA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=M |author2=Cohen, E.J.  |title=Rugby Football in East Africa 1909-1959|year=1960 |publisher=Rugby Football Union of East Africa |isbn= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidentally [[No. 223 Squadron RAF|223 Squadron]] (The squadron was based at RAF Eastleigh - now [[Moi Air Base]] - [[Nairobi]]) were the first RAF squadron to field a rugby team in East Africa, though they were far from the first military team as [[Royal Navy]] vessels had been playing against the colonists since, at the latest, 1922.  The "Royal Air Force (Kenya) RFC" first fielded a team in 1937 captained by a [[Corporal]] Clarke with [[Pilot Officer]] Roden as vice-captain and the team owed a lot to the behind-the-scenes work of [[Squadron Leader]] Pitcairn-Hill.  In about 1955 the team changed its name to "United Services Eastleigh RFC" when captained by [[Flight Lieutenant]] Frielich with [[Corporal]] Freeman as vice-captain, with the administrative assistance of [[Squadron Leader]] Warren and [[Flight Officer]] Goodwin.  Players of note during the club's early years include a three-quarter called Mickelthwaite, a fly-half called Cahou and another three-quarter, Tony Hale, all three of whom were on the cusp of selection for [[Kenya national rugby union team|Kenya]] and/or [[East Africa national rugby union team|East Africa]].&lt;ref name="Rugby in EA" /&gt;

The first Nakuru sevens were held in approximately 1949, usually being held fairly early in the season, attracting entrants from West Kenya and Central Province.  The original cup was lost within a few years of the start of the tournament so early winners are uncertain.  A replacement cup was kindly presented by Mr. HO Salt and was known as the ''Salt Cup''.&lt;ref name="Rugby in EA" /&gt;

The first Nile Sevens were held in 1950 and were held annually for at least the next ten years.  The winner is presented with a mounted silver rugby ball known as the ''Krell Trophy'' which was presented in 1951 for this purpose by Mr. Cecil Krell who had done valuable work for rugby union in East Africa in both [[Dar es Salaam]] and [[Mombasa]].&lt;ref name="Rugby in EA" /&gt;

Teams for the Nile Sevens could be entered by clubs or by any combination of players, hence the unfamiliar team names for some of the winners.&lt;ref name="Rugby in EA" /&gt;

The Jones Cup was named after MJU ''Stompie'' Jones, a former Eldoret player whose representative playing career spanned an astonishing 20 years.  He played for [[Kenya national rugby union team|Kenya]] against the touring Combined South African Universities team in 1930 and against the [[University of Stellenbosch]] in 1935 and finally for [[East Africa national rugby union team|East Africa]] against the [[University of Cape Town]] in 1949/50.&lt;ref name="Rugby in EA" /&gt;

Ironically, having been named for someone who had demonstrated unparalleled longevity, the Jones Cup was to have a remarkably short tenure as a seven-a-side trophy.  In 1954, after just two years, it was redesignated as the trophy for the winner of the West Kenya zone of the [[Enterprise Cup]].&lt;ref name="Rugby in EA" /&gt;

The '''Olympic torch relay''' is the ceremonial relaying of the [[Olympic flame]] from [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], Greece, to the site of an [[Olympic Games]]. It was first performed at the 1936 Berlin Games,&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, Chris. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7330949.stm "The Olympic torch's shadowy past"], ''[[BBC News]]'', 2008-03-05. Retrieved on 2009-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt; and has taken place prior to every Games since.

Although in the past some Olympic organizing committees organized torch relays which encompassed multiple countries, the International Olympic Committee now restricts international relays due to the protests during the [[2008 Summer Olympics torch relay]], in which the relay was met with protests at several international sites on its way to [[Beijing]], [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/28/sports/othersports/28torch.html |title=I.O.C.

Two secondary relays carried the flame from Olympic Stadium in Berlin to the off-site aquatic venues: Grunau (for the rowing course), and Kiel (yachting).  The cauldron in Kiel sat in an old Hanseatic galley in the bay. Kiel would also be the yachting site of the 1972 Munich Olympics.

'''Moss Lane Cricket Ground''' was a [[cricket]] ground in [[Moss Side]], [[Manchester]], [[Lancashire]]. The first recorded match on the ground was in 1864, when [[Manchester Cricket Club]] played [[Sheffield Cricket Club]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/617_misc.html Other matches played on Moss Lane]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1844, the ground held its inaugural [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match when Manchester played [[Sheffield Cricket Club]] who were called Yorkshire on that occasion. From 1844 to 1846, the ground played host to four first-class matches, the last of which saw Manchester play Sheffield.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/617_f.html First-Class Matches played on Moss Lane]&lt;/ref&gt;

The final recorded match on the ground came in 1847 when Manchester Slow Bowlers played Manchester Fast Bowlers. The ground was later developed, with St Mary's Church covering the site today.

'''''Night Game''''' is a 1989 [[crime drama]] filmed in [[Galveston]] and [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. It stars [[Roy Scheider]] as a detective who must solve a series of murders. Released on September 15, 1989 by Epic Productions, the film was written by Spencer Eastman and directed by [[Peter Masterson]].

==Plot==
A number of young women are found dead on or around the beaches of Galveston and the one thing they all have in common is that they were murdered when [[Houston Astros]] ace pitcher Silvio Baretto (an [[Amalgamation (fiction)|amalgamation]] of real-life pitchers [[Bob Knepper]] and [[Juan Agosto]]) pitches and wins a night game at the [[Astrodome]]. Additionally, each victim had her throat slashed by some sort of knife or hook.

Scheider plays former minor league baseball player turned Galveston homicide detective Mike Seaver. Seaver is a staunch [[Astros]] fan and is the only person on the case who begins to realize the coincidence of the deaths coming after Sil Barretto's night game wins in the Dome.

After 95 minutes of sleuthing, Seaver ultimately realizes that the murderer is a disgruntled former Astros pitcher named Floyd Epps. Epps had lost his pitching hand in a [[minor league]] bus accident and now wears a hook. He personally, if illogically, blames Sil Baretto for his misfortune and decides that his murders on the same night as Baretto's wins will steal the headlines from his former teammate.

The penultimate scene features Seaver shooting and killing Epps at a [[Balinese Room|Galveston beach front restaurant]]. Epps has been attempting to murder Seaver's fiancee, Roxy, but the swings of his hook prove to be as wild as his mental state, and he fails. The final scene of the film features Sil Barretto walking off the mound before the start of a game in the Astrodome to lead the entire stadium in a standing ovation for the newly married Seaver and Roxy who are standing behind the dugout.

==Critical reception==
Upon its release, ''Night Game'' was neither a critical nor a box office success. ''[[The New York Times]]'' review of the movie on September 16, 1989 read, "Maybe Roy Scheider should go back to chasing sharks. His career has taken a long, slow dive from his days as the harassed police chief in ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' and the tortured Broadway director in ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]''. In fact, it seems to have hit bottom in ''Night Game''." The review further stated, "It's hard to see what could have been done to liven up ''Night Game'', short of having someone run into the Galveston Police Department yelling 'Shark!' Too bad no one does."

==Notes==
The movie was filmed entirely in Galveston and Houston and features such landmarks as the [[Galveston Seawall]], Galveston Cotton Exchange (which is seen as the fictional Galveston Police headquarters), the San Luis Hotel, the [[Balinese Room]] (where Epps is killed), [[Galveston County Daily News]] compound (including some of the police station scenes depicting the detective office space), the former Broadway Theater, and the [[Gulf Freeway]]. The poster for the movie features a shot of [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] in [[Detroit]] during the 1984 [[World Series]] instead of the Houston Astrodome. Roy Scheider portrayed a Detroit player in a prior baseball film, ''[[Tiger Town]]''.

==Behind the scenes==
The movie was covered in the July 1989 Houston Astros program on pages 58 and 59. An author is not listed.

''"[[Glenn Davis (baseball player)|Glenn Davis]] has proven repeatedly that he has a flair for the dramatic. With his consistent game-winning RBIs, one might say he almost performs on cue. And in August, he will prove it again, not only to Astros fans, but across America, when he belts a homer in the upcoming movie, ''Night Game''. Parts of the movie were filmed in the Astrodome last year and director Peter Masterson says Davis proved to be the man he needed for a tricky plot twist. 'We needed an Astro to hit a home run and Davis was the one that hit it, so he got in the movie,' laughed Masterson in a call from his New York home."''

''"Night Game" was the first movie in years to be filmed in the Astrodome, joining "[[Brewster McCloud]]", a peculiar 1971 [[Robert Altman]] film largely shot in the stadium, "[[The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training]]", and "Murder at the World Series", an ABC-TV movie of the week that featured the Astros in a World Series before they had even won a division championship. This newest movie is also a murder mystery. Roy Scheider plays a Galveston detective who is cheering for the Astros in the midst of a tight pennant race. But one problem, he is assigned to track down a serial killer. And Scheider is discovering that the murders take place on the same night that Houston wins games.''

''"Night Game" was originally scripted to be set in San Francisco, but Masterson, a Houston native, who has also made "[[The Trip to Bountiful]]" and wrote "[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]", decided to bring the movie to Texas. 'It seemed more interesting to bring it to Houston. A lot of movies are made in San Francisco and not as many in Houston or Galveston,' the director said. 'I think it worked out better; it's a different kind of locale.' Critical to the movie was the availability of the Dome, he said. Filming during the games was limited to capturing crowd reaction, wide-angle shots of the teams and the occasional player at bat. [[Dodgers]] outfielder [[Mike Marshall (outfielder)|Mike Marshall]] was, like Davis, expected to hit a homer, Masterson said. But the director found that dingers in the Dome aren't all that common. 'We tried our best, but he didn't cooperate,' Masterson smiled, admitting that he had to resort to footage of a Marshall single and 'we cut real quick after the crack of the bat to crowd shots.'''

''Much more Dome footage will involve players no one is familiar with though. Masterson said former Astro Norm Miller, now a team executive, arranged for squads of amateur players to imitate the pros. 'After games ended, we got the field. We simulated some on-the-field stuff and got the close ups we needed,' Masterson recalled. 'We worked until dawn every night. As soon as it got too light, we'd have to quit.' In addition to present and past Astro stars, Houstonians will also recognize one more local figure in the movie. Bob Allen, the sports director at KTRK-TV Channel 13 plays the Astros' play-by-play broadcaster. Masterson said the anchorman 'did a really good job.'''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3090">[[File:SI_Yankees_vs_Cyclones_08-27-17_2nd_Inning_14.jpg|thumb|A player waits to bat in the on-deck circle]]
In [[baseball]], '''on deck''' refers to being next in line to [[batting (baseball)|bat]]. In a professional game, the batter who is on deck traditionally waits in a location in the [[foul territory]] called the '''on deck circle'''.

Being ''on deck'' only guarantees the batter will get a chance to bat in the inning if there are fewer than two outs, and the number of outs plus the number of [[baserunner]]s adds up to fewer than three because a double or triple play could occur. Additionally, the [[manager (baseball)|manager]] reserves the right to pull the on-deck hitter for a [[pinch hitter|substitute]] at his discretion.

The player next in line to bat behind the on deck batter is referred to as being ''in-the-hole''.

==Significance in save situations==
A [[relief pitcher]] who comes in to pitch when his team is ahead can earn a [[save (baseball)|save]] if the tying run is either on base, at bat, or on deck, and he then finishes the game without giving up the lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/documents/0/4/0/224919040/2017_Official_Baseball_Rules_dbt69t59.pdf|title=Official Baseball Rules 2017 Edition|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On-deck circles==
There are two '''on-deck circles''' in the field, one for each team, either circle can be used by either team, positioned in foul ground between home plate and the respective teams' benches. The on-deck circle is where the next scheduled batter, or "on-deck" batter, warms up while waiting for the current batter to finish his turn. The on-deck circle is either an area composed of bare dirt; a plain circle painted onto artificial turf; or often, especially at the professional level, made from artificial material, with a team or league logo painted onto it.

According to Major League Baseball rules, there are two on-deck circles (one near each team's [[Dugout_(baseball)|dugout]]). Each circle is 5 feet in diameter, and the centers of the circles are 74 feet apart. A straight line drawn between the centers of the two on-deck circles should pass 10 feet behind home plate.

[[File:On-deck-circle-diagram.png|thumb|Diagram of on-deck circles (shown in pink)]]

==Origin==
Both on-deck and in-the-hole were originally naval aircraft carrier terms{{fact|date=September 2018}}.  In-the-hole is the designated spot where the pilot would wait before going "on the flight deck". For safety and to avoid confusion this "hole" was below the level of the flight deck. On older carriers, it may have been an actual pit or just a designated off-the-flight-deck spot the pilot would await. So the sequence of a pilot was to be "in-the-hole" until the plane was boarded on the flight deck ("on-deck"). Then the plane taxied to the catapult where it was launched.

'''Riddell Sports Group''' is an American company specializing in [[sporting goods|sports equipment]] for [[American football]]. It was headquartered in [[Rosemont, Illinois]];&lt;ref name="Easton-Bell Sports"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastonbellsports.com/about-us/#hover_content_ril|title=About Us- Worldwide Locations-Rosemont, IL|publisher=Easton-Bell Sports|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620195502/http://www.eastonbellsports.com/about-us/#hover_content_ril|archivedate=2014-06-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2017 the company relocated to a new facility in adjacent [[Des Plaines, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ecker |first=Danny |url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20170315/BLOGS04/170319934/riddell-moving-headquarters |title=Riddell moving headquarters |publisher=Crain's Chicago Business |date=2017-03-15 |accessdate=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.morganharbour.com/portfolio/riddell-inc&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was started by John Tate Riddell. Riddell first invented the removable cleat and then went on to invent the first ever plastic suspension helmet in 1939. In 2008, Dan Arment was appointed president of Riddell. Arment previously worked as executive vice-president and general manager of mass-market business for [[BRG Sports]], Riddell's parent company, which is owned by private equity firm [[Fenway Partners]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/article.pl?portal_id=35&amp;page_id=1755 People on the Move]&lt;/ref&gt;  Fenway acquired the company in 2003 from [[Lincolnshire Management]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E4DF153DF93BA35754C0A9659C8B63 FENWAY PARTNERS BUYS SPORTS APPAREL MANUFACTURER].

The newer design was released in response to a study on concussions.  The design is becoming more popular in the [[NFL]] and [[NCAA]], being used by notables such as [[Peyton Manning]], [[Dwight Freeney]], [[Casey Hampton]], and [[Brady Quinn]], as well as having been used by [[Eli Manning]] during the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]].
[[File:RiddellPads.jpg|thumb|left|Shoulder pads]]
Riddell is also known for its Revolution IQ HITS helmet (Head Impact Telemetry System). The sensors inside the helmet called MX Encoders store data from each impact and can be transferred to a laptop to be reviewed by coaching staff or physicians. The helmets cost about $999 and are already being used by NCAA football teams.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2007/12/18/riddell-starts-shipping-concussion-monitoring-football-helmets/ Riddell starts shipping concussion-monitoring football helmets]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other helmet styles produced by Riddell include the Revolution Speed and the Revolution IQ. Brad Herrin The company also produces a youth line of helmets including the Revolution Speed Youth, Revolution IQ Youth, Revolution Youth, Revolution Little Pro, Attack, VSR-4, VSR2-Y and Little Pro.

Riddell is currently being sued by multiple NFL players. More than 125 former NFL players are now suing the league and helmet-maker Riddell for not disclosing and, in some instances, allegedly hiding the risks of repeated head injuries. There are "at least three" personal injury cases   pending in California and one more in Pennsylvania. According to the AP, the cases represent the "first examples of former players joining together to file concussion-related lawsuits against the NFL." Lawyer Thomas Girardi represents dozens of the players in two of the complaints. He says the goal is to enact "necessary changes" to protect future generations of players, as well as "set[ting] up a medical process so [the plaintiffs] can have medical attention for this injury as long as they need it," in addition to financial compensation. The NFL is taking the position that players knew the risks when they made football their career and that there was "no misconduct or liability" on the league's part. The question of [http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2010/07/nfl-unveils-scary-new-concussion-poster/23590/ what the NFL knew and when they knew it] regarding concussion is likely to be the sticking point. Players intend to show there was "a history of literature showing that multiple blows to the head can cause long-term damage" that got buried by the NFL and that the league also "fraudulently concealed the long-term effects of concussions," including the increased risk of dementia. The players appear to have allies in Washington. Yesterday{{When|date=October 2013}}, a Senate subcommittee held hearings on misleading safety claims made by sports equipment companies. One thing is certain: it's going to be a long slog for both sides, without a clear endgame. For example, the players are seeking judgments "in the millions of dollars," though no specific numbers have been listed in the court documents. The consensus from lawyers on both sides is that the lawsuits could take years to be sorted out. Nobody associated with the players, the league, or Riddell was even "willing to guess how long it could be" during discussions with the AP.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

A '''rugby shirt''' is a [[shirt]] worn by players of [[rugby union]] or [[rugby league]]. It usually has short sleeves, though long sleeves are common as well.

Rugby shirts have a buttoned opening at the top, in a similar style to [[polo shirt]]s but with a stiffer collar. Modern rugby shirts often have a very small collar so as to provide less material for a potential tackler to latch onto (even though such an action is illegal in a game). Due to the nature of the game, the fabric is generally strong, and traditionally rugby shirts have rubber buttons so that they would, if pulled on in a game, come undone rather than pop off.

A traditional design of rugby shirt consists of five or six horizontal stripes or "hoops" in alternating colours. [[Rugby league]] shirts often have a large 'V' around the neck as part of their design. [[Football]] shirts by contrast, traditionally generally have vertical stripes. Rugby shirts, like most sport shirts, will usually have a number on the back, though shirts not meant for competitive play will usually forgo this. Logos and labels of sponsorship are now common, and generally appear on the abdominal area of the shirt. 

==Materials==
Rugby shirts were traditionally made out of cotton, but as synthetic fabrics became cheaper they have become incorporated into rugby shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rugby15.co.uk/rugbyshirts.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928045333/http://www.rugby15.co.uk/rugbyshirts.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2007-09-28 | title=History of rugby shirts | publisher=Rugby15 | date=2007-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most common materials are a mix between cotton and polyester (many of these shirts are meant for supporter use, though they can be used in a rugby game), and pure polyester (these shirts are generally designed for game use).

The reason for the preference of polyester in a game situation is twofold: firstly, polyester is harder to get hold of in a tackle situation, as it is inherently more 'slippery' than cotton or a cotton-blend. In addition, the increasing use of skin tight shirts further enhances this effect, as there is no loose material for a tackler to get a grip of.
The other benefit of man-made fibre over cotton is that it absorbs less water and mud. As rugby is a sport played mainly in winter and/or bad weather, a cotton rugby kit can weigh around {{convert|6|to|8|lb|kg|abbr=on}} when wet. This extra weight has to be carried by the player, in addition to running in wet, heavy ground. 

The gaining popularity of [[rugby 7s]] has made more of a demand for lighter, more breathable jerseys as well. Rugby 7s is a faster, more wide open game in which players compete 7 versus 7 as opposed to 15 versus 15.

The rugby shirt has, in numerous cultures, become a popular fashion item, with many clothing manufacturers producing rugby styles shirts, with the distinctive collar and hooped or squared design, which do not represent an actual club.

'''Shibe Park''', known later as '''Connie Mack Stadium''', was a [[baseball park]] located in [[Philadelphia]]. It was the home of the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] of the [[American League]] (AL) and the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] of the [[National League]] (NL). When it opened April 12, 1909, it became baseball's first [[reinforced concrete|steel-and-concrete]] stadium.&lt;ref&gt;Suehsdorf, A. D. (1978). ''The Great American Baseball Scrapbook''. New York: Random House. {{ISBN|0-394-50253-1}}. p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; In different eras it was home to [[$100,000 infield|"The $100,000 Infield"]], [[Whiz Kids (baseball)|"The Whiz Kids"]], and [[1964 Philadelphia Phillies season|"The 1964 Phold"]]. The venue's two home teams won both the first and last games at the stadium: the Athletics beat the [[Boston Red Sox]] 8–1 on opening day 1909, while the Phillies beat the [[Montreal Expos]] 2–1 on October 1, 1970, in the park's final contest.

Shibe Park stood on the block bounded by Lehigh Avenue, 20th Street, Somerset Street and 21st Street. It was five blocks west, corner-to-corner, from the [[Baker Bowl]], the Phillies' home from 1887 to 1938. The stadium hosted eight [[World Series]] and two [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Games]], in [[1943 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1943]] and [[1952 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1952]], with the latter game holding the distinction of being the only All-Star contest shortened by rain (to five innings). In May 1939, it was the site of the first night game played in the American League.

Phillies Hall-of-Fame centerfielder and longtime broadcaster [[Richie Ashburn]] remembered Shibe Park: "It looked like a ballpark. It smelled like a ballpark. It had a feeling and a heartbeat, a personality that was all baseball."&lt;ref&gt;Leventhal, Josh (2006). ''Take Me Out to the Ballpark''. New York: Black Dog and Leventhal Publishers. {{ISBN|978-1-57912-513-4}}. p. 48. On another, less charitable occasion, Ashburn said the difference between [[Veterans Stadium]] and Shibe Park was "like the difference between chicken salad and chicken shit." [[Bruce Kuklick|Kuklick, Bruce]] (1991). ''To Every Thing a Season: Shibe Park and Urban Philadelphia''. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-04788-X}}. p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1907: Design and construction===
In the early years of the 20th century, baseball was popular enough in Philadelphia that Philadelphia Athletics president [[Ben Shibe]] found his team regularly turning away customers from their cramped [[Columbia Park]] ballpark even though it was just a few years old. When as many as 28,000 showed up to fill the 9,500 wooden bleacher seats, Shibe and partner [[Connie Mack]] decided the A's needed a new place to play.&lt;ref name=kuk18&gt;Kuklick, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

He searched for a site for his new park and found one on Lehigh Avenue between 20th and 21st Streets, five blocks west of [[Baker Bowl]], straddling the neighborhoods known as [[Swampoodle (Philadelphia)|Swampoodle]] and Goosetown. It was still primitive at the time, an area of "high clay bluffs, rain-washed gullies, quagmires, open fields, even ponds"&lt;ref name=kuk22&gt;Kuklick, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; where chickens pecked and pigs rooted. Although a grid of streets was planned for the area, few actually existed. The area was already served by public transportation: trolleys ran up and down Broad Street and back and forth along Lehigh, and both the [[Pennsylvania railroad|Pennsylvania]] and the [[Reading Railroad|Reading]] railroads had major stations nearby. The area had "underachieved" thus far due to the presence of the city's Hospital for Contagious Diseases (the "smallpox hospital") a block west on Lehigh, but Shibe's privileged connections in town brought him word that the city would be closing the facility.&lt;ref name=jordan43&gt;Jordan, David M. (1999). ''The Athletics of Philadelphia: Connie Mack's White Elephants.'' Jefferson, North Carolina: MacFarland &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-7864-0620-8}}. p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Without the hospital, the area's stigma would eventually dissipate, but at the time, the land was still a bargain.

Shibe quietly assembled title to his square block of land early in 1907, picking up parcels "through a complicated series of acquisitions, preventing price inflation by masking his intentions,"&lt;ref name=jordan43/&gt; even using [[straw buyers]] to keep his name out of the dealings.&lt;ref name=kuk24&gt;Kuklick, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; He spent a total of $67,500 (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|67500|1908}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) on seven land packages totaling 5.75&amp;nbsp;acres,&lt;ref name=kuk24/&gt; and in February 1908, he arranged to have two projected streets running through his block dropped from the city plan.&lt;ref name=jordan43/&gt;

For the design and its execution, Shibe hired William Steele and Sons.&lt;ref&gt;Karsch, Carl G. (19990). "Five Generations of Builders." ''Carpenter's Hall'' [http://www.ushistory.org/carpentershall/history/steele.htm website]&lt;/ref&gt; Their engineering staff had worked with the new technology of [[reinforced concrete|steel-reinforced concrete]], and designed and built the city's first [[skyscraper]], the Witherspoon Building at Walnut and Juniper Streets. The Steele design for the Shibe [[façade]] was in the ornate [[French Renaissance architecture|French Renaissance]] style, including [[arch]]es, [[vaulting (architecture)|vaultings]], and [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[pilaster]]s. The grandstand walls were to be of red brick and [[terra cotta]] and featured elaborate decorative [[frieze]]s with baseball motifs, while [[cartouche (design)|cartouches]] framed the Athletics' "A" logo at regular intervals above the entrances. The souvenir program on Opening Day called it "a fetching combination of color."&lt;ref name=kuk28&gt;Kuklick, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gable]]d [[dormer]] windows on the upper deck's copper-trimmed green-slate [[mansard roof]] looked out over the streets below.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 43 and Kuklick, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Presiding over all were terra cotta busts of Shibe and Mack above the main entrances on Lehigh and 21st.&lt;ref name=kuk28/&gt;
[[File:ShibeParkOpenProgram1909.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Messrs. Shibe and Mack are top-billed on 1909 A's yearbook]]

The signature feature of the exterior design was the octangular tower on the southwest corner. The upper floors would accommodate the A's offices, those of Shibe's sons Jack and Tom, who ran the day-to-day business aspects of the team,&lt;ref&gt;Although Ben was president of the club, he was more involved in the Shibe sporting goods operation than in running the team, Kuklick, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and the domed [[cupola]] on the very top were to house the office of [[Connie Mack]], manager of the team's baseball operations. On the ground floor was a main entrance lobby. [[Bobby Shantz]], pitcher for the A's in their last years at Shibe, wrote that the corner tower entrance "looked almost like a church."&lt;ref name=jordan43/&gt; Shibe was proud of the [[egalitarianism]] of the design; he said it was "for the masses as well as the classes."&lt;ref name=kuk26&gt;Kuklick, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1908, design in hand, the Shibes and the Steeles broke ground. With the resources of the Steele firm, construction was speedy, efficient and completed in time to open the 1909 season.&lt;ref&gt;One of the most daunting aspects of the project was the grading of the rolling land at the site: it took 40 men working with 50 horse teams over two months to remove the 15,000 wagonloads of dirt necessary to flatten the block. Westcott, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was excited about its new ballpark – the ''[[Philadelphia Public Ledger]]'' called it "a palace for fans, the most beautiful and capacious baseball structure in the world."&lt;ref&gt;''Philadelphia Public Ledger'', April 12, 1909&lt;/ref&gt; American League president [[Ban Johnson]] pronounced that "Shibe Park is the greatest place of its character in the world."&lt;ref name=wes1st&gt;Westcott, Rich (1996). ''Philadelphia's Old Ballparks''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press. {{ISBN|1-56639-454-6}}. p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times, baseball author David M. Jordan wrote that it was "a splendid forerunner of others like it&amp;nbsp;... Ben Shibe and the Steeles initiated 'the golden age of ballparks'."&lt;ref name=jordan44/&gt;

The original 1909 configuration was a double-deck grandstand in the southwest corner of the block, with open pavilion seating extending to the foul poles. The outfield was a large rectangle, surrounded by a 12-foot brick wall that bordered the streets. The deepest part of center field was a square corner 515&amp;nbsp;feet from home plate. It was 378 to the left field foul marker, and 340 to right field. The slight upslope of the land from south to north was reflected in a small "terrace" that ran across left and center field.&lt;ref&gt;Kuklick, pp.&amp;nbsp;26–28&lt;/ref&gt;  The upper deck was built of wood mounted on steel girders, while the lower deck was built of concrete and steel.&lt;ref name="Lowry"/&gt; The only link with the Columbia Park was the transplanted sod, rolled out at the new venue. The 1909 seating capacity certainly was an upgrade from Columbia Park: 11,000 in the double deck and 12,000 in the two pavilions, for a total of 23,000. Overflow crowds were accommodated by roping off the left field area in front of the wall. Some 500 tons of steel went into the construction.&lt;ref name=wes106&gt;Westcott, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

===April 1909: "Play ball!"===
On Monday, April 12, 1909, the Opening Day proceedings walked a fine line between festival and chaos. More than 30,000 fans showed up and got in; another 15,000 showed up and were turned away. Nervous officials closed the gates hours before game time, turning the outsiders into a "howling mob of thousands"&lt;ref name=led041309&gt;''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia Public Ledger]]'', April 13, 1909&lt;/ref&gt; whose pressure forced open one of the gates. Hundreds poured in without paying admission, and an estimated 7,000 standing-room only spectators saw that first game ringing the outfield up to seven-deep, held back by a rope stretched between the left field seats and the right field bleacher.&lt;ref&gt;Sparks, Barry, (2005). ''Frank "Home Run" Baker: Hall of Famer and World Series Hero''. Jefferson, North Carolina: MacFarland &amp; Company. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-2381-1}}. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Another 6,000 more looked in from various rooftops around the block. "It seemed as if all of Philadelphia was there", wrote the ''Public Ledger''.&lt;ref name=led041309/&gt; Mayor [[John E. Reyburn]] called the new facility a "pride to the city"&lt;ref name=jordan44&gt;Jordan, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; and threw out the first ball. The A's beat the [[Boston Red Sox]] that day, 8–1.

The Athletics and their new stadium were a hit: the A's won pennants – and brought World Series to town – in 1910 and 1911, and by 1913, when they would win another, Shibe initiated the first of the expansions of seating capacity that would continue right on through the 1950s. He called again upon the Steele company and added a new unroofed bleacher section across left field, taking advantage of the site's rectangular, rather than square, shape,&lt;ref name=kuk26 /&gt; and also added roof structures to cover the open pavilions down the first base and third base lines.

After Ben Shibe's death in 1922, sons Tom and Jack represented the Shibe interest in the team&lt;ref&gt;Tom and Jack Shibe had two siblings who held stock but did not participate in team management. Kuklick, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1925 they replaced the 1913 open left field bleachers with a double-deck that extended from the foul pole to the center field corner. This construction covered the "terrace" except in the deepest part of center field which still had a slight upslope. Where the upper deck of the main stands abutted the upper deck of the bleachers, there was a slight overhang. Whether this ever affected play is unknown. They also extended the upper deck out over the pavilions. These expansions resulted in another 10,000 seats.&lt;ref name=wes112&gt;Westcott, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, the brothers installed a [[mezzanine]] that added 750 pricey box seats and the following year they raised the original grandstand roof and installed a press box underneath it, along with 3,500 more seats.&lt;ref name=wes112 /&gt;

For the 1923 season, Connie Mack had moved the infield back an estimated 21&amp;nbsp;feet. This was a choice of speed over power, as moving the plate back increased left field and right field dimensions by 15&amp;nbsp;feet each. Home runs dropped about 50% for the next three seasons.&lt;ref name=Lowry&gt;{{cite book |title=Green Cathedrals|last=Lowry|first=Philip|year=2006|publisher=Walker &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-8027-1608-8|page=177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Afo5vtVTz4wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=green%20cathedrals&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shibe brothers moved it back to its original position, resulting in field dimensions of 331&amp;nbsp;feet to right field, 334 to left, and 468 to the square corner in center.

In 1936, A's President Tom Shibe died, and Connie Mack succeeded in gaining control of the team by buying out Tom Shibe's share from his widow. The move made the Mack family the controlling partner in 1937, though various Shibe family members still had "considerable holdings" in the team.&lt;ref name=wes112/&gt;

More renovation – and a round of controversy – came after the 1938 season when Mack sought to install light towers for night play, which local residents were against. They objected in general to the light, noise and traffic that [[night game]]s would bring to the neighborhood, and objected specifically to the danger of home run balls hitting them as they sat on their porches and to the ability of fans in the upper decks to peer into their bedrooms at night.&lt;ref name=wes114&gt;Westcott, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; The matter went to court, and Mack hired a young Philadelphia lawyer to plead his case. The presentation of young [[Richardson Dilworth]], future mayor of the city, carried the day: the A's won the case and the light towers went up in time for the 1939 season.&lt;ref&gt;The neighbors' reluctance was not unfounded. Author Rich Westcott interviewed 20th Street residents of the time who reported the lights were so bright, even pulling down the windowshades did not make for a dark room. The light was indeed prodigious: there were two 147-foot freestanding light towers and six towers perched on the pavilion roofs, totaling 780 lamps of 1,500 watts each–1.2 million watts, or two billion candlepower, "enough to light a highway between Philadelphia and Cleveland." Westcott, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; The first night game in the AL was at Shibe Park on May 16, 1939: the [[Cleveland Indians|Indians]] beat the A's, 8–3.&lt;ref name=wes153&gt;Westcott, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Shibe Park grandstand 1913.jpg|thumb|right|The stadium's third World Series in 1913 coincided with Shibe's first major upgrade and expansion: more seats, more roofs]]

In 1941, Mack installed a new, larger scoreboard in deep right-center field, replacing the small board that had been in the same general area,&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Post'', April 12, 1941, cited in Kuklick, p. 217n130&lt;/ref&gt; and about the same time an imposing sign went up on the left field fence with the fan-friendly message: "Warning: Persons throwing bottles or other missiles will be arrested and prosecuted." A few years later, he would further add a tunnel between the visitors' clubhouse and their dugout to avoid confrontations with belligerent hometown fans, who were often not afraid to pick a fight.&lt;ref name=kuk100&gt;Kuklick, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the Macks wanted to expand the seating capacity again, in a park that was running out of room to expand into. In 1949, they proposed erecting the ultimate spite fence: a new double-deck seating section in right field that would boost the park's capacity to 50,000.&lt;ref name=wes114 /&gt; The problem was that the home plate-to-right field axis was the shorter dimension of the Shibe block rectangle, and since the new stand could not intrude into the play area, its [[fascia]] would have to be in the plane of the existing right field fence while its hindquarters would have to protrude out back, dangling some 15 feet above the west sidewalk of North 20th Street and forming a covered [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] walkway. The $2.5-million proposal galvanized the 20th Street neighbors against the A's again, and this time the legal team could not overcome the zoning issues.&lt;ref name=wes114/&gt;

The Macks did spend $300,000 on renovations in 1949 and managed to shoehorn 2,500 more box seats in;&lt;ref name=wes114/&gt; the old lower deck pavilion seating was reconstructed to turn the more distant seats toward the diamond instead of facing the outfield.&lt;ref name="west115"&gt;Westcott, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the high corners that were a noticeable feature of the ballpark during its final two decades, the corners being just far enough away from the foul lines to accommodate the bullpens. They also added an "annunciator" on the upper deck beyond third base that flashed the at-bat number; ball-strike-out count; hit or error; and score.&lt;ref name=kuk100/&gt;

===1935: The "spite fence"===
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Shibe Park rooftop bleachers 1913.jpg|image2=Shibe Park Rooftop Bleachers 2011.JPG|width=215|caption2=Across 20th Street from Shibe: above, in 1913 with rooftop bleachers; below, 2011}}
At the park's beginning, homeowners on both Somerset Street and 20th Street had a great view of the proceedings within, thanks to the low outfield fences. While this changed for the people on Somerset in 1913 when Shibe added the left field bleacher section and blocked the view from that direction,&lt;ref name=kuk73&gt;Kuklick, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; it was still a clear shot in from 20th Street over the low, 12-foot wall in right. The view from the roofs, the bedroom bay windows, and even the porch roofs on 20th was as good as from some of the seats inside the park: [[Pathé News]], [[Universal Newsreel]] and [[Movietone News|Fox Movietone News]] even set up cameras at 2739 North 20th as part of their World Series coverage.&lt;ref name=kuk74&gt;Kuklick, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers involved in this cottage industry were considerable: a rooftop bleacher could hold up to 80 people, with 18 more in the bay window of the front bedroom and more even on the porch roof.&lt;ref name=wes113&gt;Westcott, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="baseball 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rooney|first=John|title=Bleachers In the Bedroom: the Swampoodle Irish and Connie Mack|year=2012|publisher=Zip Publishing/The Educational Publisher|isbn=978-1622490066}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers on the block could number up to several thousand for important games.&lt;ref name=wes113/&gt; Housewives served up refreshments for sale and children scurried to the hot dog vendors on the street, bought dogs for a nickel, and brought them back to sell for a dime.&lt;ref name=kuk74/&gt; With so much money on the line, the business got organized and formalized very quickly; homeowners were soon squeezed for bribes by city amusement tax collectors, and city police collected commissions for collaring and herding fans from the sidewalk into particular homes.&lt;ref name=kuk73/&gt; By 1929, the extra income from the rooftop bleachers actually caused real estate values to climb on the 2700 block of N. 20th Street.&lt;ref name=kuk74/&gt;

As long as the A's were winning games and filling the park, the 20th Street entrepreneurs were annoying, but little more, to Mack and the Shibes, but that changed in the early 1930s.&lt;ref name=kuk74/&gt; Starting in 1932, Mack's sell-off of his Second Dynasty stars, combined with general [[Great Depression]] hard times, sent attendance plummeting. 20th Streeters, accustomed to the income but now suffering from the tough economy like everyone else, sent reps to the lines – such as they were – at the park box office to offer discount seats and poach customers from the ball club.&lt;ref name=kuk75&gt;Kuklick, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last straw for Jack Shibe. In the winter of 1934–35, he ordered the fence raised to 34 feet.&lt;ref&gt;Westcott, Rich (2012).

Baker Bowl (upper right) was one of the last of the rickety wooden parks, while concrete-and-steel Shibe Park (foreground) set the bar for those to come. Looking east along Lehigh Avenue, 1929]]

It also frustrated many Philadelphia players, both offensively and defensively. Among them, A's and Phillies outfielder [[Elmer Valo]] and Phillies right fielder [[Johnny Callison]], both lefthanded batters, complained that the high right-field fence cost them many home runs.&lt;ref name=wes124&gt;Westcott, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; It dogged them when they played the field, too: its rippling corrugations made caroms unpredictable, with some balls dropping straight down, others bounding all the way back to second base and some bouncing radically to one side or another, sometimes into the bullpen. It was "one of the hardest" walls to play in the majors.&lt;ref&gt;Kuklick, pp.&amp;nbsp;75–76&lt;/ref&gt;

===1938–1954: New tenant, new name, new owner===
For several years, the National League Phillies had been trying to escape their dilapidated home, [[Baker Bowl]], and move to Shibe Park as tenants of the A's.  However, it took them until mid-season 1938 before they were able to get out of their lease and move the five blocks west on Lehigh to Shibe Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Phillies Set to Close Deal for Use of Shibe Park|newspaper=New York Times|date=1938-06-26|url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB071EF939581A7A93C4AB178DD85F4C8385F9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phillies' arrangement with Connie Mack was simple: they would pay 10 cents a head "rent" for the fans they drew and would hire and pay their own stadium staff on game days.&lt;ref name=kuk90&gt;Kuklick, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; While moving to Shibe likely saved the Phillies from extinction, having two teams play in the park complicated the scheduling enormously.  Any impact of the extra income from the Phillies was blunted by the fact that the crowded baseball schedule virtually precluded any other events throughout the summer – so the new tenant's income actually affected the A's bottom line very little.&lt;ref name=kuk90/&gt; The Phillies' tenure at Shibe Park began with a split doubleheader against [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston]] on July 4 that year, and they finished the season last in the league, 24½ games behind the seventh place [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and 43 games back overall.&lt;ref name=kuk90/&gt;
[[File:ConnieMackIn1938.jpg|thumb|upright|Mack was already 75 years old in 1938 when the Phils arrived, yet his creaky tenure still had twelve more difficult years to go]]

21st and Lehigh was one of the gloomiest addresses in baseball in the late 1930s and early 1940s. At the time, both Philadelphia teams were in the midst of long stretches of futility. The Phillies had notched only one winning season since 1918, while the A's had not had a winning season since 1933. Both teams finished last in their respective leagues in 1938, 1940, 1941, 1942 and 1945.&lt;ref name=kuk91&gt;Kuklick, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Making things worse was that Phillies owner [[Gerald Nugent]] was mired in debt to both Mack and the [[National League]], and other NL owners were grumbling about the dismal "gates" that their Philly trips earned them.&lt;ref name=kuk92&gt;Kuklick, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 Nugent agreed in principle to sell the Phillies to [[Bill Veeck]], only to have that sale derailed by [[Commissioner of Major League Baseball|Commissioner]] [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]]'s objections to Veeck's plans to stock the Phillies with [[Negro League]] stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.sabr.org/journals/files/SABR-Baseball_Research_Journal-35.pdf Revisiting Bill Veeck and the 1943 Phillies], ''The National Pastime'', 2006 issue, page 109. Retrieved 2012-05-12.&lt;/ref&gt;   The league took over the franchise and sold it to lumber baron [[William B. Cox|William Cox]], who paid off Mack and put money down on future rent.&lt;ref name=kuk92&gt;Kuklick, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; While the flamboyant Cox did pour money into the team in an effort to turn it around, he also abraded fans, his own players, fellow owners and Landis. The uproar did not last long, though: when Cox was found to be betting on Phillies games, Landis banned him for life in short order.

Cox then sold the Phillies to [[DuPont]] vice president [[R. R. M. Carpenter]], who gave the club presidency to his son, [[R. R. M. Carpenter, Jr.|Bob, Jr.]] – a wealthy 28-year-old Delawarean whose mother was a [[Du Pont family|DuPont]] and who himself was part-owner with Connie Mack of the [[Wilmington Blue Rocks (1940–1952)|Wilmington Blue Rocks]] minor league team.&lt;ref name=kuk92/&gt; The genial young millionaire admitted at his first press conference that he was short on experience, but added, "But I'm not worried. I think we can all have a good time."&lt;ref&gt;''Philadelphia Evening Bulletin'', November 23, 1943&lt;/ref&gt; Carpenter slowly pulled the team out of its "dime store" way of doing business&lt;ref name=kuk93&gt;Kuklick, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; and invested major funds in the farm system, hired marketing consultants and investigated strategies for selling more tickets. He upgraded his staff with professional administrators who modernized operations&lt;ref name=kuk93/&gt; at the same time he was spending time in Mr. Mack's plush tower office getting guidance from The Grand Old Man of Baseball.&lt;ref name=kuk94&gt;Kuklick, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The result was an upsurge in attendance, including the city's first million-fan season in 1946, and the 1950 "Whiz Kids" team, who brought the NL pennant to Philadelphia for the first time in 35 years.

But as the Phillies improved the quality of baseball life in Philadelphia, there was a simultaneous decline in the fortunes of the A's – in the team, in the owner, and in the ballpark. Mack had alienated many fans in 1915 and again in 1932 when he sold off his pennant-winning teams for cash, and his clashes with his neighbors over the spite fence, the night games and the 20th Street overhang sparked ill-will between the team and its most important asset: its fan base.&lt;ref name=kuk94/&gt; The Phillies began to outdraw the A's, whose bottom-feeder status in the American League contributed to the vicious circle of bad teams and empty seats.

There was also a precipitous decline in the boss himself. 1950 marked Mack's 50th year in Philadelphia and his 87th birthday, and for the better part of a decade it had been obvious he was going senile.&lt;ref name=kuk114&gt;Kuklick, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;  He would spend most games asleep in the dugout, leaving game strategy in the hands of his coaches.  Whenever he was awake, he often made strange calls that the players and coaches usually disregarded.&lt;ref name=Dignity&gt;Warrington, Robert D. [http://sabr.org/research/departure-without-dignity-athletics-leave-philadelphia Departure Without Dignity: The Athletics Leave Philadelphia]. [[Society for American Baseball Research]], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He would also call for players from decades earlier to pinch-hit; in the 1940s it was not uncommon for him to yell "[[Home Run Baker|Baker]]!" or "[[Jimmie Foxx|Foxx]]!" – sluggers he had sold off decades before.&lt;ref name=kuk115&gt;Kuklick, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Most ominous of all, the crowds at Shibe Park were so small that the other AL teams could not even begin to cover their travel expenses, leading the other owners to complain that the gates at Shibe Park were too small to justify the trip.&lt;ref name=kuk119&gt;Kuklick, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this, the A's managed to awaken from their slumber and tally three straight winning seasons from 1947 to 1949.  This led to hopes that the A's would give "The Grand Old Man of Baseball" the perfect 50th anniversary present – a pennant.  However, the 1950 season was an unmitigated disaster.  By May 26, they were 11-21, their season all but finished.  On that date, Mack's sons [[Roy Mack|Roy]] and [[Earle Mack|Earle]] gently pushed their father into announcing his retirement at the end of the season.&lt;ref name=Dignity/&gt;

The power vacuum in the wake of "Mr. Baseball's" exit only worsened the problems, however. Roy and Earle Mack, "undistinguished men living in the shadow of their father,"&lt;ref name=kuk113&gt;Kuklick, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; were products of Mack's first marriage; their half-brother Connie, Jr. – 20 years their junior – came from his second. As the family factions squared off to battle for control of the A's, Junior and his mother joined forces with remnants of the Shibe family, who still owned 40% of the stock, while Roy and Earle shelved their years of squabbles to present a united front against what they derisively called "the Shibe faction."&lt;ref name=kuk113/&gt; To raise cash for the coming internecine struggle, Roy and Earle made all the wrong decisions: they remortgaged the ballpark at a time when their cashflow was uncertain, and they jeopardized that flow even more by leasing the park concessions to an outside food service corporation.&lt;ref name=kuk116&gt;Kuklick, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Shibe Park 1954 concession prices.jpg|thumb|upright|In 1954 at Shibe Park, a dollar bought a hot dog, a soda, a pack of cigarettes, popcorn, and a megaphone, with a dime change]]

In short order, the brothers had acquired huge excess debt and lost their best income sources to repay it.  They managed to buy out Junior, the second Mrs. Mack and the remaining Shibes late in 1950.  However, they made what was one of the worst of several bad business decisions by mortgaging the team and pledging Shibe Park as collateral – thus saddling the A's with hefty mortgage payments that could have been spent on improving the team and the park.&lt;ref name=Dignity/&gt;  The business the brothers had gained control of was a doomed enterprise. And the moment they got control of it, they resumed battling each other.&lt;ref&gt;Much of the brothers' discord made the newspapers. In one famous episode, Earle separated from his wife and moved into a small suite he kept at the ballpark; when Roy heard about it, he had the water shut off in the place so Earle could not bathe or use the toilet. Kuklick, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite undeniable signs of deterioration, it would be a few more years before the operation collapsed entirely. In the meantime, the Macks tried to capitalize on the remaining vestiges of affection in the city for their father, who turned 90 years old in December 1952. They opened the nostalgic Elephant Room, filled with memorabilia from the old glory days, under the first base grandstand.&lt;ref name=kuk118&gt;Kuklick, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; They renamed the park Connie Mack Stadium in February 1953&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=This Week in Philly Sports History: That's 'Connie Mack' to You|author=Chuck Darrow|newspaper=Philadelphia Daily News|date=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the opening of the 1953 season, hanging a new metal plate over the old ''SHIBE PARK'' inscription, which was "still written in stone" beneath.&lt;ref name=kuk129&gt;Kuklick, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Many old-timers refused to acknowledge the change.&lt;ref name=kuk129/&gt;

The Macks' bad business decisions finally caught up with them in 1954. While Roy had hoped to keep the team, Earle wanted out, and the meager attendance figures were hard to argue with. The A's business plan required attendance of 550,000 to break even.&lt;ref name=kuk120&gt;Kuklick, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in 1954 they drew just 305,000.&lt;ref name=kuk119 /&gt; An embarrassing "Save the A's" committee formed to help, and it published the daily figure of turnout needed to stay out of the red, but the turnstile count remained flat while the published number grew each day&lt;ref name=kuk122&gt;Kuklick, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; and the committee collapsed in the stretch run. Even Mayor [[Joseph S. Clark, Jr.|Joe Clark]] hurt the effort: he admitted he was a Phillies fan.&lt;ref name=kuk120/&gt; The A's finished 1954 dead last in the majors, 60 games out of first;&lt;ref&gt;Retrosheet: [http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1954/Y_1954.htm 1954 Final Standings]&lt;/ref&gt; their final game at Shibe drew only 1,715 fans.&lt;ref&gt;Retrosheet: [http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1954/B09190PHA1954.htm Yankees at Athletic 9/19/54 boxscore] [http://www.philadelphiaathletics.org/history/sept191954.htm Photo: mid-9th at the last-ever Phila.

In early August, Chicago businessman [[Arnold Johnson (industrialist)|Arnold Johnson]] stepped forward with a complicated $3.375 million plan to buy the Athletics and move them to Kansas City. He owned [[Municipal Stadium (Kansas City)|Blues Stadium]], home to the [[New York Yankees]]' top minor-league affiliate, but intended to sell it to the city for upgrading to major league standards. Roy, Earle and Connie Mack, Sr. would get about $1.5 million, plus Johnson would pay off the remaining mortgage and assume the $400,000–$800,000 debt to the concessionaires.&lt;ref name=kuk123&gt;Kuklick, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Very little of Johnson's own cash would be involved: the deal depended on real estate and the eagerness of the Kansas City town fathers to take on debt to snag a major league franchise.&lt;ref name=kuk124&gt;Kuklick, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

The fly in the ointment was Connie Mack Stadium. The plan assumed a $1.5 million cash infusion from Bob Carpenter to buy the old ballpark, and he was anything but enthusiastic about it. "We need that ballpark as much as we need a hole in the head", he said.&lt;ref name="west115" /&gt; Carpenter estimated that modernizing the place would cost a million dollars, and even at that it would be impossible to enlarge the seating capacity.&lt;ref name=kuk124/&gt; He also recognized the growing parking problem, as well as the declining affluence of the neighborhood.&lt;ref name=kuk131&gt;Kuklick, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; He tried to pass on the purchase, reminding Johnson that he had a lease until 1957. Johnson responded by threatening to raise the "rent" to 20 cents a head, and to bill the Phillies for stadium upkeep the A's had always paid for.&lt;ref name=kuk124/&gt; When Carpenter did not show signs of giving in, Johnson said he would call the entire deal off. Carpenter knew he did not have much choice, since no other facility in the Delaware Valley was suitable even for temporary use.  Reluctantly, he formed the 21st and Lehigh Realty Company to buy the park for $1.7 million, and collected rent from the Phillies just as the A's had previously—though this effectively resulted in Carpenter transferring money from one pocket to another.&lt;ref name=kuk138&gt;Kuklick, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

The deal was done and the A's were gone. In early 1955, two trucks backed up to the stadium and packed the artifacts from the Elephant Room for removal to Kansas City. Carpenter graciously encouraged Mr. Mack to continue using his opulent tower office in the stadium that now bore his name, which he did almost daily until his death some 13 months later.&lt;ref name=kuk126&gt;Kuklick, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

===1955–1970: Carpenter, Phillies and decline===
When the stadium opened for the 1955 season, Carpenter's first, advertising billboards first appeared on the walls and roofs of the outfield: Formost dairy, [[Peanut Chews|Goldenberg's Peanut Chews]], [[Philco]], [[Cadillac]], [[Alpo (pet food)|Alpo]], [[Coca-Cola]] and Mertz Tours signs became familiar sights to stadiumgoers and to fans watching on television.&lt;ref name=wes122&gt;Westcott, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; A new straight-across fence covered the square corner in center field and most of the remaining "terrace", reducing the distance to a still-formidable 447&amp;nbsp;feet.&lt;ref name=wes116&gt;Westcott, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Distance markers also appeared on the walls for the first time. In addition to the foul poles (334 and 331) and the center field area (447), a 400 marker was posted just to the center field side of the scoreboard, and a 405 marker in the corresponding area of deep left center field. A few years later, wooden fencing covered the rough bricks along the right field wall, and eventually the 331 sign was changed to read 329, although that change had no impact on the actual home run distance.&lt;ref name=low178&gt;Lowry, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Bob Carpenter replaced the old 1941 scoreboard in right-center field with a new, much larger board, constructed for Connie Mack Stadium. A prominent feature of the new board was the [[P. Ballantine and Sons Brewing Company|Ballantine Beer]] advertisement across the top and the [[Longines]] clock perched above it. The board's superficial resemblance to the similarly-adorned board in [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] gave rise to the urban legend that the board was acquired second-hand from the Yankees.&lt;ref&gt;Kuklick writes: "There is no confirmation to the story that the scoreboard was the old Yankee Stadium one." Kuklick, p. 217n130; see also Berkun, Todd (2011). ''A Tale of Two Scoreboards'' at [http://placesnomore.wordpress.com/2011/06/10/twoscoreboards/ ''Long Island &amp; NYC Places That Are No More'', June 10, 2011], on the urban legend of the Yankee Stadium sign.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the boards differed in many details, and the Yankee Stadium board remained until 1959 when it was replaced, a few years after Connie Mack Stadium's new board had made its appearance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|title=Green Cathedrals |last=Lowry|first=Philip|year=2006|publisher=Walker &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-8027-1608-8|page=178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Afo5vtVTz4wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=green%20cathedrals&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The big scoreboard extended well above the top of the right field fence, topping out at 75&amp;nbsp;feet including the clock. The entire board was in play except for the clock that topped the board: Balls that hit the clock were home runs. [[Dick Allen]] was the only player to ever hit a home run over the Ballantine Beer sign and scoreboard.&lt;ref name="Lowry"/&gt; The scoreboard was used through the final year at the ballpark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Joe Sixpack: Phillies have Yanks to thank for Ballantine sign|author=Joe Sixpack|newspaper=Philadelphia Daily News|date=2009-10-28|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/66793932.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1956, a new [[Plexiglas]] barrier replaced the old backstop screen, an experiment also conducted at Cincinnati's [[Crosley Field]] around that same time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ballparks.com/baseball/american/shibep.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the death of Mr. Mack in February 1956, a Mack Memorial Committee raised funds and commissioned sculptor Harry Rosin to create a statue of "Mr. Baseball". On April 16, 1957, it was unveiled across Lehigh Avenue in Reyburn Park – named after the mayor who threw out the first ball at Shibe back in 1909 – as part of the Opening Day ceremonies for the 1957 season. Commissioner [[Ford Frick]], AL president [[Will Harridge]] and [[Leo Durocher]] all attended, as did many former A's players; the ceremony was emceed by sportscaster [[Bill Campbell (sportscaster)|Bill Campbell]]. Shortly after, Philadelphia City Council removed Reyburn's name from the park and replaced it with Mack's.&lt;ref&gt;Warrington, Bob. "Connie Mack Statue." [http://www.philadelphiaathletics.org/history/conniemackstatue.htm Philadelphia Athletics Historical Society] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429130614/http://www.philadelphiaathletics.org/history/conniemackstatue.htm |date=April 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was later moved to [[Veterans Stadium]] in 1971, and ultimately to [[Citizens Bank Park]] in [[2004 in baseball|2004]].

For the 1960 season, additional box seats in front of the original grandstand reduced the plate-to-screen distance by about 10&amp;nbsp;feet.&lt;ref name=low178/&gt; With a couple of years of life left in the park, a curving inner fence across center field reduced the distance from 447 to 410.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sporting News'', March 1, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; The final seating capacity of the ballpark, as recorded in the 1970 ''[[Sporting News|Sporting News Baseball Guide]]'', was 33,608.

Carpenter's reluctance about Connie Mack Stadium soon proved justified.  He found it impossible to find a way to make the park profitable. His first thought was to extend the length of his income season by adding a football team.  In 1959, he sought to buy an [[American Football League]] franchise, but the negotiations failed.&lt;ref name=kuk138 /&gt; Additionally, the neighborhood rapidly went to seed;&lt;ref name=kuk131 /&gt; the phrase "Watch your car, mister?" became a catch phrase to game attendees.&lt;ref name=kuk134&gt;Kuklick, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the parking problem became the very crux of the issue in the 1950s and 1960s: whereas most people had formerly come to the park on public transportation, after the war, the automobile became the standard mode of transport.&lt;ref name=kuk131/&gt; There was a 500-car lot, later expanded to 850 cars, across 21st Street, but it was not nearly enough. Carpenter tried to buy the whole block in 1959 for a multi-level garage, but the deal fell through.&lt;ref name=kuk133&gt;Kuklick, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; The team maintained special "Phillies Express" buses to shuttle fans from transportation hubs in Camden and the [[69th Street Terminal]] in [[Upper Darby]], but the service never really caught on.&lt;ref name=kuk134 /&gt; Carpenter also investigated land tracts first in West Philadelphia, then in the [[Torresdale]] section of the city, as well as nearby suburban [[Cheltenham, Pennsylvania|Cheltenham]] and farther-flung Camden, across the river in New Jersey. But there were prohibitive problems with every one of those proposed sites.&lt;ref&gt;Kuklick, pp.&amp;nbsp;136–139&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpenter finally gave up and in 1961 sold the stadium for $600,000 to a group of New York real estate investors, losing over a million dollars after his 7-year ownership; he secured a 3-year lease and an option to stay through 1967 while he pursued his Torresdale stadium plan.&lt;ref name=kuk138/&gt; The New York buyers quickly flipped the property to another New York consortium who, assuming the Phillies would be gone by 1967, began planning the demolition of the stadium and construction of a bowling alley and discount store on the site.&lt;ref name=kuk139&gt;Kuklick, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Then in May 1964, [[Jerry Wolman]], who had just bought the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in February, brought the stadium ownership back to town, paying $757,000 for it as part of a larger real estate deal.&lt;ref name=kuk141/&gt; Wolman's motivations for the purchase are in dispute&lt;ref name=kuk141/&gt; – all the mortgage shuffling did not slow the decay out at the park – but he claimed he wanted to help the Phillies; the move also put him at the very center of the emerging fight over a new stadium in Philadelphia, which would likely affect his Eagles.&lt;ref name=kuk141/&gt;

Wolman, the city, and even Carpenter were all exploring plans to solve the town's stadium problem. The plan that came closest to fruition was a complicated 1964 package that called for a new stadium with parking for 7,000 cars to be built "on stilts" over the vast railroad yards near [[30th Street Station]]. This plan had considerable backing from city politicians and businessmen,&lt;ref name=kuk141&gt;Kuklick, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; but it too eventually unraveled when federal urban renewal funds did not come through and extended wrangling between Wolman and everyone else involved brought it down.&lt;ref&gt;Kuklick, pp.&amp;nbsp;141–143&lt;/ref&gt;  Wolman then tried to sell the park to the city for the nominal price of 50 cents, but Mayor [[James Hugh Joseph Tate|James Tate]] balked at using city money to pay for major renovations.&lt;ref&gt;Kuklick, p 142&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually the city would build [[Veterans Stadium]] in South Philadelphia and the Phillies would leave Connie Mack Stadium.

The final game at Connie Mack Stadium was played on October 1, 1970, with the Phillies defeating the [[Montreal Expos]] 2–1 in 10 innings. The occasion was marred by souvenir hunters literally dismantling the stadium even while the game was still in progress. A special post-game ceremony – including a helicopter removal of home plate and delivery of it at The Vet – was cancelled in the mayhem.&lt;ref&gt;See Philadelphia ''Evening Bulletin'' photograph of ransacking in progress, courtesy of Temple University Libraries. http://digital.library.temple.edu/u?/p15037coll3,282 Accessed 12/22/09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baseball at the park==
{{details|topic=the Athletics|History of the Oakland Athletics}}
{{details|topic=the Phillies|History of the Philadelphia Phillies}}
Over its 62 seasons of operation, Shibe Park was home to some of the best teams of their eras – and to some of the worst: the A's and the Phillies won eight of their leagues' pennants, bringing eight World Series to 21st and Lehigh. The two clubs also finished dead last in their leagues a combined 30 times – 18 by the A's, 12 by the Phillies.&lt;ref&gt;Retrosheet: [http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/O/FR_OAK.htm Athletics season stats] and [http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/P/FR_PHI.htm Phillies seasons stats]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' proclaimed on its cover: "The 1929 Philadelphia A's, not the '27 Yankees, may have been the greatest baseball club ever assembled."&lt;ref&gt;[[William Nack|Nack, William]] (1996). "The Team That Time Forgot." ''Sports Illustrated'', August 19, 1996, front cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over their first six seasons in the park, the A's dominated the American League. They won four pennants those six years and were famed for their [[$100,000 infield|$100,000 Infield]], said by statistician [[Bill James]] to be the greatest infield of all time.&lt;ref&gt;James, Bill (2001). ''The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. {{ISBN|0-684-80697-5}}. pp. 548–550&lt;/ref&gt; Baseball historians since have dubbed the 1910–1914 A's clubs "The First Dynasty"; it was "the sport's first championship dynasty ever."&lt;ref&gt;Kashatus, William T. (2002). ''The Philadelphia Athletics.'' Portsmouth, New Hampshire: Arcadia Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7385-1133-1}}. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1914 team lost the World Series in four games,&lt;ref&gt;Retrosheet: [http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1914/YPS_1914.htm 1914 World Series]&lt;/ref&gt; Connie Mack sold off his top stars. If there was any doubt the dynasty had ended, A's teams finished last in the AL the next seven years in a row.&lt;ref name=aseas&gt;Retrosheet: [http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/O/FR_OAK.htm Athletics season stats]&lt;/ref&gt; The fire sale and subsequent cellar seasons earned Mack and the A's tremendous acrimony among Philadelphia fans.&lt;ref&gt;Kuklick, pp.&amp;nbsp;50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

Mack launched a rebuilding program in the mid-1920s, and his effort became "The Second Dynasty",&lt;ref name=kuk52&gt;Kuklick, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; which culminated in back-to-back-to-back AL pennants in 1929, 1930 and 1931.&lt;ref name=aseas/&gt; It was an ill-timed hegemony, though: the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] triggered the [[Great Depression]], and hard times caused baseball attendance to plummet, winners or no.&lt;ref name=kuk62&gt;Kuklick, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; By October 1932, the second great sell-off, of The Second Dynasty, was underway; by 1935, the stars were gone and the franchise had picked up $545,000 cash for itself.&lt;ref name=kuk62/&gt; The A's had won the last of their pennants (and would not go to the postseason again until 1971, when they were in [[Oakland]]), and goodwill with the fan base was in short supply indeed.

The highs and lows of the A's were matched by those of the Phillies – except for most of the highs.&lt;ref name=phlsea&gt;Retrosheet: [http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/P/FR_PHI.htm Phillies season stats]&lt;/ref&gt;  As mentioned above, their first decade at Shibe saw the end of one of the longest streaks of futility in major league history – only one winning season from 1918 to 1948.  Their 1950 [[Whiz Kids (baseball)|Whiz Kids]] team did win a pennant – the first for a Philadelphia team in 19 years.  The [[1964 Philadelphia Phillies season|1964 Phillies]] came close to doing it {{nowrap|again – until}} the infamous "[[Phold]]". On the other side of the spectrum, the [[1961 Philadelphia Phillies season|1961 team]] managed to set an enduring record, though: their {{nowrap|23-losses-in-a-row}} mark (from July 29–August 20) has yet to be bested.&lt;ref&gt;Retrosheet: [http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1961/VPHI01961.htm Phillies 1961 game log]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memorable games===
In the very first game at Shibe Park, catcher [[Doc Powers]] of the Philadelphia Athletics is said by some to have suffered internal injuries after crashing into a wall to catch a foul pop-up. Powers did die two weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;Sources vary widely about Powers's death. Leventhal (p. 49), Jordan and others say he was injured during the game, while Kuklick and others say he completed the game, was stricken with an infection afterward, and died after two weeks in the hospital. Jeff Merron suggests he died on the field. Retrosheet.org and others show him going 1-for-4, which suggests he completed the game. Retrosheet: [http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/P/Ppowem102.htm Doc Powers's page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Athletics participated in seven [[World Series]] during their tenure at the stadium: [[1910 World Series|1910]], [[1911 World Series|1911]], [[1913 World Series|1913]], [[1914 World Series|1914]], [[1929 World Series|1929]], [[1930 World Series|1930]] and [[1931 World Series|1931]], winning the Fall Classic in 1910, 1911, 1913, 1929, and 1930. The hometown fans got to witness the A's clinch world titles at Shibe Park in 1911, 1929 and 1930.&lt;ref name=wes136&gt;Westcott, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

The Phillies participated in one World Series during their tenure at the stadium, in [[1950 World Series|1950]]. They were swept by the [[New York Yankees]].&lt;ref&gt;Retrosheet: [http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1950/YPS_1950.htm 1950 World Series games]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1943 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1943 All-Star Game]] was the first of two that would be held at Shibe Park. The 1943 game was hosted by the Athletics, and the 1952 game by the Phillies. The 1943 game was the second of three wartime All-Star Games that would be played at night. The American Leaguers won the game, 5–3.&lt;ref&gt;Retrosheet: [http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1943/YAS_1943.htm 1943 All-Star Game]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1951 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1951 All-Star Game]] had originally been awarded to the Phillies. However, the city of [[Detroit]] was celebrating the 250th anniversary of its founding in 1701 and requested to host the year's All-Star Game. The 1951 game was moved to [[Briggs Stadium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Midsummer Classic: The Complete History of Baseball's All-Star Game|last=Vincent|first=David|author2=Lyle Spatz |author3=David W. Smith |year=2001|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|isbn=0-8032-9273-2|page=111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6IqPLQE4HekC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=%22National+League+Park%22+philadelphia&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Phillies then hosted the [[1952 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1952 Game]]. The home city was well represented on the All-Star teams. Phillies pitcher [[Curt Simmons]] started the game for the Nationals in front of the home crowd; Phillies shortstop [[Granny Hamner]] started and batted eighth; and A's pitcher [[Bobby Shantz]] pitched the fifth inning for the Americans and struck out [[Whitey Lockman]], [[Jackie Robinson]] and [[Stan Musial]] in succession. It had rained all day, starting early in the morning and keeping both teams from pre-game warm ups. Rain delayed the first pitch by 20 minutes and eventually caused the game to be called after the fifth inning. The National Leaguers emerged with a then-rare All-Star victory for the Senior Circuit, 3-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1952 All-Star Game|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/asgbox/yr1952as.shtml|publisher=Baseball-Almanac.com|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1923, the A's had the misfortune of being [[no-hitter|no-hit]] twice in just four days, at home in Shibe Park. On the 4th, Yankees hurler [[Sam Jones (baseball)|Sam Jones]] was just one walk away from a [[perfect game]] when he no-hit the A's; four days later on the 7th, it was Boston's [[Howard Ehmke]] who was likewise a lone BB away from perfection.&lt;ref name=wes152&gt;Westcott, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

In Game 4 of the 1929 World Series, the A's, down 8–0 to the [[Chicago Cubs]], scored ten runs in the 7th inning to win. It was the highest score in a single inning and the biggest comeback in World Series history.&lt;ref name=lev49&gt;Leventhal, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Retrosheet:[http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1929/B10120PHA1929.htm 1929 World Series Game 4 boxscore]&lt;/ref&gt; The game on May 16, 1939 was the first night game played in the American League. The [[Cleveland Indians]] beat the A's 8–3 in front of 15,000+ nocturnal fans.&lt;ref name=lev49 /&gt;

On September 28, 1941, the last day of the season, the Boston Red Sox played a doubleheader at Shibe Park. The day before, Boston manager [[Joe Cronin]] gave left fielder [[Ted Williams]] the option of sitting out the final two games, because his .3995 average would round up to .400.&lt;ref name=wes147&gt;Westcott, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Williams walked the streets of Philadelphia that night, pondering; he decided the stat would be cheapened if he did sit out, so he played and went 6-for-8. His .406 average for 1941 was the last .400-plus average in the major leagues.&lt;ref name=wes148&gt;Westcott, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:JohnFranklinHomeRunBaker1914.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Home Run Baker|Frank "Home Run" Baker]] hit the first home run at Shibe Park, on May 29, 1909]]

Over the years, four A's pitchers tossed no-hitters in Shibe Park: [[Chief Bender]] in 1910, [[Bullet Joe Bush]] in 1916, [[Dick Fowler (baseball)|Dick Fowler]] in 1945 and [[Bill McCahan]] in 1947.&lt;ref name=wes102&gt;Westcott, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home runs===
The ballpark was the site of some notable home run feats. On May 29, 1909, [[Home Run Baker|Frank "Home Run" Baker]] used his 52-ounce bat to hit the first home run in Shibe Park: 340&amp;nbsp;feet over the right field fence, off Boston's RHP [[Frank Arellanes]], who had previously served him up a grand slam pitch in Boston on April 24.&lt;ref name=sparks28&gt;Sparks, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Montreal Expos]] catcher [[John Bateman (baseball)|John Bateman]] hit the last home run there on September 29, 1970, in the antepenultimate game played at the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;Retrosheet: [http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1970/B09290PHI1970.htm Phillies vs. Expos 9/29/70 boxscore]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:JimmieFoxxTimeCover29July29.jpg|thumb|upright|left|"Double-X's" prowess with the stick was national news the summer of 1929]]

[[Babe Ruth]], who got his first hit as a Yankee at Shibe Park on April 14, 1920,&lt;ref name=wes148 /&gt; hit a blast to deep left-center on September 9, 1921, that cleared the then-single bleacher stand, went across the street, and hit a tree over 500&amp;nbsp;feet away. On May 21, 1930, Ruth hit one to right field over the 12-foot wall that landed in Opal Street, the alley behind the second row of houses, again over 500&amp;nbsp;feet distant and said to be the longest ever home run hit at Shibe Park.&lt;ref&gt;Wagenheim, Kal (2001). ''Babe Ruth: His Life and Legend''. Olmstead Press. {{ISBN|978-1-58754-114-8}}. p. 225. This colossal blast was the second of three homers Ruth would hit that day.&lt;/ref&gt; The longest strike ever hit there is said to be Ted Williams's prodigious foul ball blast that cleared the high roof at the right field line, passed over 20th, over Opal, over Garnet, and came down on 19th Street.&lt;ref name=kuk109&gt;Kuklick, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 1932, [[Lou Gehrig]] hit four homers in one game.&lt;ref&gt;Retrosheet: [http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1932/B06030PHA1932.htm Yanks vs. A's 6/3/32 boxscore]&lt;/ref&gt; He hit two to the left field bleachers, two over the right field wall, and had a shot at a fifth homer with a deep fly to center, but center fielder [[Al Simmons]] snared it on a running catch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travel-watch.com/Lou%20Gehrig.htm Travel-watch.com]&lt;/ref&gt; A's slugger [[Jimmie Foxx]] was also known for tape-measure blasts, especially during 1932 when he hit 58 home runs and challenged Ruth's season record of 60.&lt;ref&gt;Retrosheet: [http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1932/Jfoxxj1010081932.htm Jimmie Foxx 1932 batting splits]&lt;/ref&gt; Foxx was the all-time home run hitter at Shibe Park, with 195 round-trippers between 1927 and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Foxx hit 182 regular-season home runs at Shibe Park as an Athletic, 9 as a visitor with the Red Sox, three in his one-year hitch with the Phillies, plus his HR in Game 4 of the 1931 World Series. Retrosheet: [http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/F/Pfoxxj101.htm Jimmie Foxx]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 24, 1936, New York Yankees second baseman [[Tony Lazzeri]] hit two grand slams – one in the second off [[George Turbeville]], one in the fifth off [[Herman Fink]] – and a solo shot in the seventh off [[Woody Upchurch]], setting a single game RBI record of 11 (he also hit a 2-RBI triple). The Yanks prevailed, 25–2.&lt;ref&gt;Leventhal, p. 49, and Retrosheet: [http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1936/B05240PHA1936.htm A's vs. Yanks 5/24/36 boxscore]&lt;/ref&gt; Yankee sluggers set the record for home runs hit in a doubleheader when they visited Shibe Park on June 28, 1939. [[Tommy Henrich]], [[Bill Dickey]], [[George Selkirk]] and [[Frankie Crosetti]] hit one each and [[Joe Gordon]], [[Babe Dahlgren]] and [[Joe DiMaggio]] all hit three. Total: 13 round-trippers. The Yanks won both ends, 23–2 and 10–0.&lt;ref&gt;Leventhal, p. 49, and Retrosheet: [http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1939/B06281PHA1939.htm A's vs. Yanks 6/28/39 boxscore]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 1949, the Phillies hit five home runs in the 8th inning: [[Del Ennis]], [[Willie Jones (baseball)|Willie Jones]] and [[Schoolboy Rowe]] each smacked one and [[Andy Seminick]] hit two off [[Cincinnati Reds]] pitchers [[Ken Raffensberger]], [[Jess Dobernic]] and [[Kent Peterson]] in a 12–3 win.&lt;ref&gt;Leventhal p. 49, and Retrosheet: [http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1949/B06020PHI1949.htm Phillies vs. Reds 6/2/49 boxscore]&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, [[Dick Allen]] hit some booming drives over the roof of the double-decked bleachers, in the general direction of the 1921 Ruthian shot. He also cleared the big scoreboard in right-center field. Despite his hitting prowess, Allen was unpopular with the fans, and fellow long-ball hitter [[Willie Stargell]] of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] joked that the reason Allen was booed at home was that he hit his long drives clear out of the stadium: "When he hits a homer, there's no souvenir."&lt;ref&gt;''Baseball Digest'', January 1975&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MuleHassGoudeycard.jpg|left|thumb|[[Mule Haas]]'s inside-the-park homer helped the A's win the 1929 World Series]]

The single most famous home run hit at Shibe Park may be the one that stayed inside the park, in Game 4 of the [[1929 World Series]] vs. the [[Chicago Cubs]]. [[Mule Haas]] of the A's hit a deep fly to center field which [[Hack Wilson]] of the Cubs lost in the sun. It landed behind him and rolled toward the center field corner, nearly 470 feet from home plate. As Wilson tried to chase down the ball, Haas circled the bases.

Shibe Park hosted its first [[Negro league baseball|Negro League]] games in 1919 when the [[Hilldale Club]] and [[Bacharach Giants]] played home games at the ballpark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sport and the Color Line: Black Athletes and Race Relations in Twentieth-century America|last=Miller|first=Patrick B.|author2=David Kenneth Wiggins |year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-94611-5|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8n0PJets0wC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=%22Columbia+Park%22+%22Philadelphia+Giants%22&amp;client=firefox-a|accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games between white major league teams and Negro League teams were not uncommon. The Bacharach Giants hosted an exhibition game at Shibe Park against [[John McGraw]]'s [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] on October 6, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The 1919 World Series: what really happened?|last=Cook|first=William A.|year=2001|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-1069-8|page=58|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GJCe4HDcW-kC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=%22shibe+park%22+Negro+League&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA58,M1|accessdate=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shibe Park was a neutral site venue for [[Negro League World Series]] games. The [[Cleveland Buckeyes]] defeated the [[Homestead Grays]], 5-0, on September 20, 1945, to win game four and sweep the Series, four games to zero. Cleveland's [[Frank Carswell]] defeated Homestead's [[Ray Brown (Negro leagues pitcher)|Ray Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1945 Negro World Series|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/1945_Negro_World_Series|publisher=[[BR Bullpen]]|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Negro League [[Philadelphia Stars (baseball)|Philadelphia Stars]] played home games at Shibe Park in the 1940s. The team's usual home field, [[Penmar Park|at 44th and Parkside]] seated approximately 6,000 fans; the Stars were able to draw between 10,000 and 12,000 to Shibe Park. They often played double-headers on Monday nights which was a travel day for the major league clubs.

Former Stars player [[Gene Benson]] would later recall the team playing about twenty games per season at Shibe Park. The Stars would dress in the A's locker room.&lt;ref name=wes186&gt;Westcott, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; The Stars drew their largest crowd on June 21, 1943 when they beat the [[Kansas City Monarchs]] in front of 24,165.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Philadelphia Stars Win|date=1943-06-22|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1943/06/22/archives/philadelphia-stars-win.html|pages=23, 55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional football==
Shibe Park hosted the [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]] against the [[Chicago Bears]] on December 5, 1925 and the Yellow Jackets against the Bears on December 4, 1926. It also served as the site of two [[American Football League (1926)|AFL]] games in 1926, the [[Philadelphia Quakers (AFL)|Philadelphia Quakers]] against the [[Los Angeles Wildcats]] on November 20, 1926 and the Quakers against the [[New York Yankees (NFL)|New York Yankees]] on November 27, 1926. The stadium hosted the December 12, 1925, [[Pottsville Maroons]]&amp;ndash;[[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] All-Stars game. The Maroons' NFL franchise was suspended as a result of the team's participation in that contest, costing Pottsville the [[1925 NFL Championship controversy|1925 NFL championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philadelphia's Pro Football Stadiums|url=http://home.comcast.net/~ghostsofthegridiron/stadiums.htm|accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Football League]]'s [[Philadelphia Eagles]] moved to Shibe Park in [[1940 Philadelphia Eagles season|1940]] and played their home games at the stadium through 1957.

&lt;blockquote&gt;To accommodate football at Shibe Park during the winter, management set up stands in right field, parallel to Twentieth Street. Some twenty feet high, these "east stands" had twenty-two rows of seats. The goalposts stood along the first base line and in left field. The uncovered east stands enlarged capacity of Shibe Park to over thirty-nine thousand, but the Eagles rarely drew more than twenty-five to thirty thousand.&lt;ref name=kuk86&gt;Kuklick, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Eagles played the [[1948 NFL Championship Game]] in a blizzard; the home team defeated the [[Chicago Cardinals (NFL, 1920–59)|Chicago Cardinals]] 7–0, the only score being a [[Steve Van Buren]] touchdown. The Eagles left Connie Mack Stadium after the [[1957 Philadelphia Eagles season|1957 season]] for [[Franklin Field]]. Franklin Field would seat over 60,000 for the Eagles whereas Connie Mack had a capacity of 39,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Eagles Encyclopedia|last=Didinger|first=Ray|author2=Robert S.

==Boxing, politics, soccer, religion==
[[File:LeonardVsKilbrane1917.jpg|thumb|left|Shibe Park hosted a championship bout when Leonard beat challenger Kilbane, 1917]]
Shibe scion Jack briefly tried his hand as a boxing promoter in the early 1910s, shortly after his father built Shibe Park,&lt;ref name=kuk83&gt;Kuklick, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; and although he did not pursue the career, he did make the acquaintance of other promoters in the Philadelphia boxing world, including Bob Gunnis and Herman "Muggsy" Taylor. Gunnis and Taylor became among the first promoters to book a bout into a major league baseball stadium when they brought [[Johnny Dundee]] vs. [[George Chaney]] to Shibe Park in July 1917, and although the fight itself was unremarkable, the concept propelled Gunnis and Taylor to the forefront of their trade.&lt;ref name=kuk83/&gt; Over the next forty years, perhaps a hundred boxing cards took place at Shibe,&lt;ref name=kuk89&gt;Kuklick, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; some of them big-time pairings and even championship bouts.&lt;ref name=kuk84&gt;Kuklick, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benny Leonard]] retained his championship against challenger [[Johnny Kilbane]] in 1917, and 1928's [[Benny Bass]] vs. Harry Blitman was said by sportswriters to be the best [[featherweight]] bout in the city's history.&lt;ref name=kuk85&gt;Kuklick, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, [[Gil Turner]], [[Ike Williams (boxer)|Ike Williams]], [[Charley Fusari]] and many other top fighters fought important bouts at Shibe Park.&lt;ref name=kuk85/&gt; At first, groundskeepers set the ring up over the pitcher's mound, but soon this changed to the area over home plate with the baseball backstops dismantled; spectators sat in the main grandstand for the fight. Even before the installation of the light towers in 1939, staging night boxing was easy because of the vastly smaller area that needed to be lit –portable searchlights did the trick.&lt;ref name=kuk85/&gt;

In October 1948, the [[United States men's national soccer team|US national soccer team]] played three international friendlies against the [[Israel national football team|Israel national team]]. The first game was played at the [[Polo Grounds]] and the last at [[Ebbets Field]]. In the middle match on October 17, the US beat Israel at Shibe Park, shutting them out 4–0 before 30,000 fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/year/1948.html|title=The Year in American Soccer – 1948|accessdate=2009-05-08|work=sover.net|publisher=Dave Litterer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The events were not always sports-related: the 30-some-thousand seats were a good venue for political rallies. In [[United States presidential election, 1940|1940]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate [[Wendell Willkie]] came to Shibe for a speech and rally. [[United States presidential election, 1944|Four years later]], the man who beat Willkie, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], made one of his few 1944 public appearances at 21st and Lehigh; he won again. In [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948]], third-party [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive]] candidate [[Henry A. Wallace]] made his nomination acceptance speech there.&lt;ref name=kuk82&gt;Kuklick, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoters tried jazz concerts in 1959, but the place was deemed "not intimate enough" for jazz.&lt;ref name=kuk210&gt;Kuklick, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; The rodeo came in 1962, but hooves proved too destructive of the turf.&lt;ref name=kuk210/&gt; The [[Ringling Brothers]] circus set up shop at Shibe in 1955 when they were denied occupancy at all their regular Philadelphia venues, and evangelist [[Billy Graham]] had many successful crusades there. The stadium management's favorite visitors were the [[Jehovah's Witness]]es, "because the Witnesses left the park immaculate."&lt;ref name=kuk82/&gt;

==Through the turnstiles==
[[File:ShibeDemoLastDay1976.jpg|thumb|left|The signature corner tower was the last to go: final day of demolition, July 13, 1976]]
The Shibe Park turnstiles registered some 47 million&lt;ref name=wes101&gt;Westcott, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; clicks over 62 seasons of baseball. The Phillies were first to break the million mark for a season in 1946 with a team that was a "harbinger of the Whiz Kids."&lt;ref name=kuk94 /&gt; The star-crossed [[1964 Philadelphia Phillies season|1964 Phillies]] drew the highest single-season attendance with 1,425,891 in that infamous year; the Athletics' best-attended season was 1948, when they drew 945,076 fans.&lt;ref name=wes120&gt;Westcott, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest single-day baseball crowd came on May 11, 1947, when [[Jackie Robinson]] made his Philadelphia debut; the Phillies beat the Brooklyn Dodgers in both ends of their doubleheader that day as 41,660 looked on. The Athletics' best single-day turnout was also for a doubleheader, with the [[Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]], on August 3, 1931, as the Second Dynasty team was closing in on its third AL pennant in a row; they swept both games before a crowd of 38,800-plus.&lt;ref name=wes119&gt;Westcott, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Low-ebb seasons were the Phillies' 1940 turnout of 207,177 and the Athletics' turnout of 146,223 in 1915,&lt;ref name=wes120/&gt; the year after Connie Mack sold off the stars from his 1914 pennant-winning team.&lt;ref&gt;The A's figure of 146,223 was for 74 home dates, meaning the average attendance was under 2,000 per game.

==Last years==
In March 1971, bankrupt Jerry Wolman – who had had to sell the Eagles in 1969 – agreed in principle to sell the Connie Mack Stadium property to Louis Graboyes and S. Solis Tollin.&lt;ref name=GettysburgTimes&gt;{{cite news |title=62-Year-Old Shibe Park Is Sold For $1,000,000|newspaper=Gettysburg Times |date=1971-03-13|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uoUlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1vIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5103,4353002&amp;dq=shibe+park&amp;hl=en|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without any permanent tenants for the stadium, Wolman had found himself unable to meet mortgage payments on it.&lt;ref name=kuk185&gt;Kuklick, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; The sale to Graboyes and Tollin, however, was never closed.

On August 20, 1971, the Connie Mack statue was re-dedicated at Veterans Stadium. That same day, while an evangelical revival group was setting up its tent, two stepbrothers, aged 9 and 12, sneaked into the park and started a small fire&lt;ref name=kuk183&gt;Kuklick, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; that grew into a 5-alarmer, burning through much of the original upper deck, collapsing the roof and leaving twisted steel supports visible from the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fire Razes Connie Mack Stadium|newspaper=Palm Beach Post-Times|date=1971-08-21|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UKM1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KbcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2456,1944000&amp;dq=shibe+park&amp;hl=en|page=B5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, the collapse of the overbloated roof restored much of the balanced grandeur of the original design. The park remained that way for four years, slowly deteriorating and becoming increasingly hazardous. Squatters took up revolving residence, and trash and debris accumulated; small trees took root and flourished, while the once-manicured emerald turf became unruly knee-high stalks.&lt;ref name=kuk184&gt;Kuklick, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1975, Philadelphia Common Pleas Court Judge Ned Hirsh ordered what remained of the stadium razed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=End Is Near at Stadium|newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle|date=1975-10-25|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8qYSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=z_gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6127,2697207&amp;dq=shibe+park&amp;hl=en|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corner tower and its domed cupola, Connie Mack's original office, was the last segment of the ballpark demolished, on July 13, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Kuklick, p. 225n186b&lt;/ref&gt; The demolition on July 13, 1976 was the same day as the 47th MLB All-Star Game played at Veterans Stadium in South Philly.

Although Wolman was in default on the mortgage and there were many liens against the property – the most recent being the $100,000+ demolition tab from Geppert Brothers – he continued to own it until 1981, when he sold it to Deliverance Evangelistic Church, a nondenominational evangelical Christian congregation.&lt;ref&gt;Kuklick, pp. 185–189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Vision|url=http://www.decministry.org/ourvision.asp|publisher=Deliverance Evangelistic Church|accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the church began constructing a 5,100-seat sanctuary on the site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Looking Up Church Rises In Famed Stadium's Place|author=Michael D.

==Contemporary culture==
Shibe Park's rooftop bleachers became one of the inspirations for a special seating area in [[Citizens Bank Park]] when it opened in [[2004 Philadelphia Phillies season|2004]]. Of their "Rooftop Bleacher Seats", the Phillies announced, "The Phillies are bringing back rooftop bleacher seats, a Shibe Park phenomenon of the 1920s when residents of 20th Street built bleacher seats on top of their roofs. The seats are located on top of the buildings along [[Ashburn Alley]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Not your typical ballpark: Family-fun features that make Citizens Bank Park world-class|url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/phi/ballpark/not_your_typical_ballpar.jsp|work=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shibe Park was one of 10 historic ballparks celebrated on the [[United States Postal Service|USPS]] 34-cent Commemorative issue stamps, "Baseball's Legendary Playing Fields", released June 27, 2001. The reverse of the Shibe Park stamp reads, "The first Major League Baseball concrete-and-steel stadium, Philadelphia's Shibe Park featured a 34-foot-high right field wall, as well as a façade with stately columns and a French Renaissance cupola."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baseball's Legendary Playing Fields Return To Glory On New Postage Stamps |url=http://www.usps.com/news/2001/philatelic/sr01_045.htm |publisher=[[United States Postal Service]] |date=2001-06-05 |accessdate=2009-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606073547/http://www.usps.com/news/2001/philatelic/sr01_045.htm |archivedate=June 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the Philadelphia Brewing Co. released an ale named "Fleur de Lehigh", which features Shibe Park on the label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Select Brews |url=http://www.philadelphiabrewing.com/pig.html |publisher=Philadelphia Brewing Co. |accessdate=2009-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425005622/http://philadelphiabrewing.com/pig.html |archivedate=April 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''Shooting the gap''' is a term used in [[American football]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportingcharts.com/dictionary/nfl/shooting-the-gap.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  To "shoot the [[Gap (American  football)|gap]]," a [[defensive team|defensive lineman]] will exploit the space between the [[offensive team|offensive linemen]] during a [[pass rush]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=rj41fl3yuxEC&amp;pg=PA50&lt;/ref&gt;  The defensive lineman is usually one of the defensive tackles.  The gaps are given different letters depending on their distance from the [[center (football)|center]].  The gaps between the center and the guard are known as the "A gaps", and the gaps between the guard and the tackle are known as the "B gaps". Shooting the gap requires the defensive lineman to turn his shoulders and get past the offensive line into the backfield by any means possible, usually by diving through the gap.  The play is often used during a blitz, as the defense will try to rush past the offensive line in order to get to the [[quarterback]] and cause a [[quarterback sack]].

'''Solent Arena''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|oʊ|l|ən|t}} {{respell|SOH|lənt}}) is an [[indoor arena]], in [[Fareham]], [[Hampshire]]. It is located alongside [[River Wallington]] by the [[M27 motorway]].

==History==
The Solent Arena project was launched by Salmiakki CIC, a non-profit community sports organisation, in July 2012 with a view to build a purpose-built arena for non-mainstream and disabled sports on the English south coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/business/local-business/rink-is-aimed-at-encouraging-more-people-to-try-sport-1-4881190 |title=Rink is aimed at encouraging more people to try sport |publisher=Portsmouth News |accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Location search included a wide area along the M27 corridor from [[Portsmouth]] to [[Southampton]]. The [[Fareham (borough)|Fareham Borough Council]] was keen to attract the stadium into the borough due to the documented shortfall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/sports-rink-would-be-one-of-five-of-its-kind-in-the-uk-1-4702618 |title=Sports rink would be one of five of its kind in the UK |publisher=Portsmouth News |accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in indoor sports provision in the area and agreed to finance the project with a 50% capital cost contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/life/specialist-rink-will-bring-cinderella-sports-to-the-fore-1-4930501 |title=Specialist rink will bring Cinderella sports to the fore |publisher=Portsmouth News |accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/10280835.Fareham_rollerskate_rink_to_open/ |title=Fareham rollerskate rink to open |publisher=Southern Daily Echo |accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inline hockey]] was first played in the building in July 2013 by members of the Fareham Wildcats Roller Hockey Club, although the building was still unfinished.

==Sporting events==
The main tenant of Solent Arena is the British Rink Hockey Association, Britain's oldest inline hockey league founded in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brha.co |title=British Rink Hockey Association |publisher=BRHA |accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; BRHA team training and game slots take up approximately half of the arena's operational hours.

The arena is also home to Lemon Hockey tournaments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lemonhockey.wix.com/the-championships |title=The Championships |publisher=Lemon Hockey |accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there was a Guinness Book of World Records attempt at the longest inline hockey game in the world on 26–27 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solent-arena.co.uk/worlds-longest-inline-hockey-game/ |title=World's Longest Inline Hockey Game |publisher=Solent Arena |accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to inline hockey, the arena is home to [[floorball]], [[box lacrosse]] and [[roller derby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solent-arena.co.uk/ |title=Solent Arena |publisher=Solent Arena |accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
Solent Arena is well served by the major road and rail networks. The [[M27 motorway]] passes just a few hundred metres from the arena, and is the main traffic [[Arterial road|artery]] into and out of the arena. It provides easy access to both [[Portsmouth]] and [[Southampton]], and from there to [[London]] via the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3]] and [[A3 road|A3(M)]].

The [[A27 road|A27]] was the original route along the south coast before the building of the M27, and runs from [[Brighton]] to [[Southampton]], passing through between the arena and Fareham Town Centre. The [[A32 road|A32]] gives access to [[Gosport]] and [[Wickham, Hampshire|Wickham]], and then through the picturesque [[River Meon|Meon Valley]] to [[Alton, Hampshire|Alton]].

[[Fareham railway station]] is on the [[West Coastway Line]], with regular services to [[Portsmouth]], [[Southampton]], [[Cardiff]] and [[London]].

Bus transport is provided by [[First Hampshire &amp; Dorset]], which runs nearly all bus routes in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstgroup.com/ukbus/hampshire/about_us/md_message/ |title=First Group Bus Services |publisher=FirstGroup plc |accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two bus stops within a couple of minutes walk from the arena on Broadcut and North Wallington.

The onsite parking facility is partly shared with the Fareham Industrial Estate, essentially being the open air surface parking surrounding the eastern flank of Solent Arena. There is disabled parking available onsite, at the main car park nearest to the arena entrance. Car parking at the arena is free of charge to arena visitors.

'''Sports engineering''' is a fast growing field of engineering which encompasses the design and production of [[sports equipment]] and [[sports venue|facilities]], performance measurement and athletic feedback systems, and the study of [[kinematics]], [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] and [[biomechanics]] as they pertain to sport.  The field overlaps other fields of science and engineering, including [[physics]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], and [[materials science]], and many practitioners hold degrees in those fields rather than in sports engineering specifically.
While sports engineering is not a well known field among pre-college students, professional societies are working to change that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportsengineering.org/|title=International Sports Engineering Association|website=International Sports Engineering Association|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=High Tech Hot Shots: Careers in Sports Engineering |author=Celeste Baine |publisher=National Society of Professional Engineers |year=2004 |isbn=9780915409235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study programs in sports engineering and technology at either the undergraduate or graduate level are now offered at a number of universities.

A sports engineering congress is biannually held, hosted by the [http://sportsengineering.org/ International Sports Engineering Association], termed 'The Engineering of Sport'. This conference brings world leading researchers, sports professionals and industry organizations together to celebrate the profession, showcasing new innovations in both research, and industry. The [http://www.isea2018.com.au/ next congress] will be hosted in March 26–29 in Brisbane, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=ISEA|title=The Engineering of Sport|url=http://www.isea2018.com.au/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10587">The '''Tampa 2''' is an [[American football]] defensive scheme popularized by (and thus named after) the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] [[National Football League]] (NFL) team in the mid-1990s–early 2000s. The Tampa 2 is typically employed out of a [[4–3 defense|4–3 defensive alignment]], which consists of four [[Defensive lineman|linemen]], three [[linebacker]]s, two [[Defensive back|cornerbacks]], and two [[Defensive back|safeties]]. The defense is similar to a [[Cover 2]] defense, except the [[middle linebacker]] drops into a deep middle coverage for a [[Cover 3]] when he reads a pass play.&lt;ref name="footballtimes"&gt;{{cite news|first=Mohammed|last=Alo|title=Tampa 2 Defense|url=http://www.footballtimes.org/Article.asp?ID=167|work=The Football Times|date=2006-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term rose to popularity due to the installation and effective execution of this defensive scheme by then-head coach [[Tony Dungy]] and [[defensive coordinator]] [[Monte Kiffin]], and the style helped the Buccaneers win [[Super Bowl XXXVII]].

The roots of the Tampa 2 system actually are in the [[Steel Curtain]] days of Pittsburgh football.&lt;ref name="Jaws"&gt;Jaworski, Ron, Cosell, Greg, and Plaut, David ''The Games that Changed the Game'', Ballantine, 2010, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; "My philosophy is really out of the 1975 Pittsburgh Steelers playbook," said Dungy (who played for the Steelers early in his career) during media interviews while at [[Super Bowl XLI]]. "That is why I have to laugh when I hear 'Tampa 2'. [[Chuck Noll]] and [[Bud Carson]]—that is where it came from, I changed very little."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.steelers.com/article/73586/ Official site of the Pittsburgh Steelers - Article&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209171311/http://news.steelers.com/article/73586/ |date=2007-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lovie Smith]] mentions having played the system in junior high school during the 1970s, though Carson introduced the idea of moving the middle linebacker into coverage. Carson's system became especially effective with the Steelers' addition of aggressive and athletic middle linebacker [[Jack Lambert (American football)|Jack Lambert]].&lt;ref name="Jaws" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Layden, Tim. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1114104/ "Two Tough"]. 27 Nov 2006. [[Sports Illustrated]]. retrieved July 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Dungy became head coach of the [[Indianapolis Colts]] and [[Lovie Smith]] (linebackers coach in Tampa from 1996–2000) became head coach of the [[Chicago Bears]], they installed the Tampa 2 in their respective teams. During the [[2005 NFL season]], the Buccaneers, still under defensive coordinator Kiffin, ranked first in the league in fewest total yards allowed, Smith's Bears ranked number two, and Dungy's Colts ranked eleventh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Smith|authorlink=|title='Simple' scheme nets big gains for trio of defenses|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2271514|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2005-12-28|accessdate=2006-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006, the [[Buffalo Bills]], [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[Kansas City Chiefs]], and [[Detroit Lions]] had also adopted the defense. In college football, [[Gene Chizik]] is among the coaches that successfully implemented the Tampa 2.

The scheme is known for its simple format, speed, and the aggressive mentality of its players. Tampa 2 teams are known as gang tacklers with tremendous team speed, and practice to always run to the ball. It also requires a hard hitting secondary to cause turnovers.

==Tampa 2 description==
{{Quote|Typically, the [Tampa 2] players don't have the prototypical size of other NFL defenders. Instead, stress is put on speed, smarts and flawless tackling. [...] A quick defensive line is a must, but the middle linebacker position is the straw that stirs the drink.|source=Bryan Mullen, ''[[The Tennessean]]''&lt;ref name="Mullen" /&gt;}}

The personnel used in the Tampa 2 are specific in position and required abilities. All positions in this defense place a premium on speed, and often the result is that they are all undersized by league standards. The defensive linemen in this scheme have to be quick and agile enough to create pressure on the quarterback without the aid of a [[Blitz (American football)|blitz]] from either the [[linebackers]] or the secondary, with the defensive tackle in the nose position having above-average tackling skills to help stop runs.  [[Warren Sapp]] is often cited as the primary example of a defensive lineman who flourished in this scheme;  indeed, he is now reckoned as the prototype three-technique defensive tackle.&lt;ref name=AllDecade&gt;{{cite news | title= A beast on D-line, Warren Sapp became NFL legend in the '00s | url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2010-01-21-all-decade-d-tackles-warren-sapp_N.htm | accessdate=November 20, 2011 | date=January 24, 2010 | work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three linebackers, two cornerbacks and two safeties are responsible for covering the middle of the field. The outside linebackers' general zone is between the cornerbacks, covering the area of the field from the line of scrimmage to 10 yards back. The middle linebacker must have better-than-average speed, and additional skills to be able to read the play and either maintain his central position to help the outside linebackers cover short passes, drop behind the linebackers in coverage and protect the zone of the field behind the outside linebackers from 11-20 yards out, or run up to the line of scrimmage to help assist in stopping the runs. "It takes a special linebacker to do that, a guy with speed," wrote Pete Prisco, senior NFL writer for ''[[CBSSports.com]]''.&lt;ref name="Mullen"&gt;{{cite news|first=Bryan|last=Mullen|title=Kiffin's dad enjoys sterling reputation|url=http://tennessean.com/article/20081225/SPORTS0601/812250337/1002/SPORTS|work=The Tennessean|date=2008-12-15}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cornerbacks protect the sidelines of the field from the line of scrimmage to anywhere between 15–20 yards out. According to Prisco, they "don't have to be great man-to-man cover players, but they have to be guys who can tackle."&lt;ref name="Mullen" /&gt; Dungy always expected his linebackers and cornerbacks to be above-average tacklers, as they are usually the primary tacklers in the defense.

The two safeties are responsible for covering their respective halves of the field from 20 yards out and more. The safeties in the system are expected to be above-average cover men with the ability to break up passes, but each safety also is expected to have additional specific skills. The strong safeties, while not expected to be great tacklers, are expected to be hard hitters. The hard hitting strong safety protects the middle of the field from being exploited by small, fast receivers, and running backs on [[wheel route]]. The free safety will be called upon to do one of two things in certain situations: either blitz the quarterback, requiring him to have the skills necessary to beat a blocking halfback or fullback, or to assume the coverage zone left by a blitzing cornerback.

The Tampa 2 is particularly effective against teams who are playing from behind, because it limits big plays. It forces offenses to be patient and to settle for short gains and time-consuming drives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This may be due to the nature of the "bend-but-don't-break" 2-deep zone coverage scheme and responsibilities safeties play in the Tampa 2.

When executed properly, the Tampa 2 defense is difficult to beat, a reason for its longevity, having seen no fundamental changes since first introduced in 1996. Teams that have been successful against this defense have managed to run the ball up the middle past the defensive tackles, or throw passes in the seams between the outside linebackers and the cornerbacks (often the most effective receiver against a Tampa 2 defense is a [[tight end]], since they often line up against this seam).

Other tactics that have shown to be effective on occasion are misdirection plays that take advantage of the defensive speed and rely on the defense 'over-running' the play (such as the middle linebacker rushing to the line of scrimmage on a play-action pass), or overloading the safeties by having multiple receivers running deep routes, creating more targets in a zone than defenders. Recently, some teams have also been able to exploit the seam between the cornerbacks and the safeties, when the quarterback can throw a pass to a receiver in that seam faster than the safety can rush up to close it and cover the receiver. A recent trend is for teams to send a receiver up the middle, creating a mismatch against the linebacker in coverage. The popularity of the Tampa 2 means that offenses are now finding it effective to exploit the deep middle, where the safeties have to cover the most ground.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Howard. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/21/AR2006122101553.html Williams: Offenses Have Uncovered the Cover 2]. 22 Dec 2006. ''[[The Washington Post]]''. retrieved June 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Run defense==
To defend running plays, the Tampa 2 is a single gap defense where each player is responsible for covering his own gap. The assigned gap changes with game conditions and personnel.

Typically this style of defense utilizes smaller but faster linemen and linebackers with above average speed. Also, the defensive backs must be above average hitters.

The key theme in stopping the run is directing traffic to the weak-side linebacker. It is therefore necessary to have a skilled tackler at the WLB position (e.g., [[Derrick Brooks]], [[Lance Briggs]], [[Sean Lee]]).

The '''11th Boat Race''' took place on the [[River Thames]] on 3 April 1852.  Typically held annually, the event is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].  Former Cambridge cox [[Thomas Selby Egan]] coached Oxford, the first time that either crew had been trained by a member of the opposing university.  The race was won by Oxford, their first Boat Race victory at Easter, who triumphed over Cambridge by nine lengths.

==Background==
[[The Boat Race]] is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] competition between the [[University of Oxford]] (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues")&lt;ref name=blues&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/06/theobserver | work = [[The Observer]] | title = Dark Blues aim to punch above their weight | date = 6 April 2003 | accessdate = 1 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Cambridge]] (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues").&lt;ref name=blues/&gt;  The race was first held in 1829, and since 1845 has taken place on the {{convert|4.2|mi|km|adj=on}} [[The Championship Course|Championship Course]] on the [[River Thames]] in southwest London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/10719622/University-Boat-Race-2014-spectators-guide.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 3 June 2014 | date = 25 March 2014 |title = University Boat Race 2014: spectators' guide | first = Oliver |last =Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/the-course | title = The Course| accessdate = 7 November 2014 | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having defeated Cambridge, who were disqualified, in the [[The Boat Race 1849 (December)|previous race]] held in December 1849.  Cambridge led overall with seven wins to Oxford's three.&lt;ref name=results&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/results| publisher= The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Boat Race – Results| accessdate = 26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The universities were unable to agree on a date for race in both 1850 and 1851.&lt;ref&gt;MacMichael, pp. 168&amp;ndash;171&lt;/ref&gt;  The challenge to race from Cambridge was received by Oxford in December 1851 and was finally accepted that a race be conducted around Easter the following year.&lt;ref&gt;MacMichael, pp. 176&amp;ndash;178&lt;/ref&gt;  Oxford were coached by the former Cambridge [[Coxswain|cox]] [[Thomas Selby Egan]], who had represented the Light Blues in the [[The Boat Race 1836|1836]], [[The Boat Race 1839|1839]] and [[The Boat Race 1840|1840 races]], in protest at the use of [[Waterman (occupation)|watermen]] as Boat Race coaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Rowing in England: A Social History: the Amateur Debate | first = Eric |last = Halladay | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ee8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA46 | pages = 45&amp;ndash;46 | publisher = [[Manchester University Press]] | date = 18 October 1990 | isbn = 978-0719026058}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Oxford had prevented their use since 1841 but Cambridge would not do so until 1873 and were coached by the Thames waterman and world champion sculler [[Robert Coombes|Bob Coombes]].&lt;ref name=pastresults&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.theboatrace.org/article/introduction/pastresults/1830-1855| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090105235722/http://www.theboatrace.org/article/introduction/pastresults/1830-1855 | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | archivedate=5 January 2009 |accessdate= 7 November 2014 |title = 1830&amp;ndash;1855}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the first time a crew was coached by a member of the other university.&lt;ref name=mac181&gt;MacMichael, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crews==
Three members of the Oxford crew had participated in the previous meeting of the universities in December 1849, Houghton, [[Joseph William Chitty]] and the cox, Cotton.  None of the Cambridge crew had Boat Race experience.&lt;ref name=mac182/&gt;  The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 11&amp;nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 8.5&amp;nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (73.5&amp;nbsp;kg), {{convert|2|lb|kg|1}} per rower more than their opponents.&lt;ref name=mac182/&gt;

Cambridge won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start on the Surrey side of the river, handing the Middlesex station to Oxford.&lt;ref name=mac181/&gt;  The race started under Searle's command at 1.45pm with Oxford taking a slight lead.  On the approach to [[Hammersmith Bridge]] the gap was closing and Oxford passed through the central arch.&lt;ref&gt;MacMichael, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;  Cambridge, following Coombe's advice, opted to shoot the bridge towards the Surrey side and in doing so "lost the stream" and allowed Oxford to extend their lead.&lt;ref name=pastresults/&gt;  By [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]] the lead was around four lengths,&lt;ref&gt;MacMichael, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; and Oxford kept increasing their margin, winning by nine lengths in a time of 21 minutes 36 seconds.  It was their second consecutive victory and took the overall record to 7&amp;ndash;4 in favour of Cambridge.&lt;ref name=results/&gt;

In sports that use a clock, '''untimed play''' is play in which the clock does not tick. In some cases, untimed play can occur at the end of a game following the expiration of the clock, and may even be when a score occurs that decides the outcome of the game.

==Gridiron football==
In [[gridiron football]], untimed play occurs in the following situations:
* [[Extra point]]s following touchdowns are attempted without the clock ticking (except in [[arena football]], which uses a continuously running clock except in the [[One-minute warning|last minute of a half]])
* If the clock expires while a play is in progress, the play continues untimed until the [[dead ball|ball is dead]]
* If, at the end of a quarter or a half, a defensive foul occurs, the offense is entitled to an untimed down
* Specifically in [[Canadian football]], if the clock expires while the ball is dead, play continues with one untimed down. (This is in contrast to [[American football]], where if the ball is dead and time expires, the half or game immediately ends.)
* In leagues that use the [[Kansas playoff]] for [[overtime (sport)|overtime]] (including Canadian, [[college football|college]] and most [[high school football]]), all overtime play is untimed.
* In the [[NFL]], [[field goal]] attempts—unless they land in the field of play—are limited to five seconds.  Should such a field goal attempt take longer than five seconds to complete, the excess will be untimed.&lt;ref name="nfl-field-goals"&gt;{{cite web|last=[[NFL.com]]|title=2017 NFL Rulebook:  NFL Football Operations|url=http://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/2017-nfl-rulebook|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also in the [[NFL]], [[Kickoff (gridiron football)|kickoffs]] and [[safety (gridiron football score)|safety kicks]] are untimed unless, and until, the receiving team attempts to return the kick.&lt;ref name="nfl-field-goals"/&gt;

All untimed downs are subject to the [[play clock]] and must commence before it expires, or else a [[delay of game]] penalty is levied.

==Basketball==
In [[basketball]], untimed play occurs in the following situations:
* [[Free throw]]s are shot without the clock ticking, though in the [[NBA]], there is a 10-second clock to shoot a free throw or else it is forfeited.
* At the end of the game, the buzzer automatically ends the game. However, if a player has released the ball from his hands before the buzzer sounds and the ball makes it through the basket, [[Buzzer beater|the score counts]].
* When the ball is put in play by being inbounded, the play is untimed until touched by a player on the court.  The player on the court closest to the ball will sometimes take advantage of this by delaying touching the ball for as long as possible by high-bouncing or rolling the ball down the court towards their teammate, buying his or her team a bit more time to shoot before the shot clock or game clock expires.
* In [[3x3 (basketball)|3x3]], a formalized version of the 3-on-3 halfcourt game, overtime is untimed. The game ends by rule once either team scores 2&amp;nbsp;points in overtime, with shots from behind the "three-point" arc worth 2&amp;nbsp;points and all other shots (whether field goals or free throws) worth 1&amp;nbsp;point.
* [[The Basketball Tournament]], an annual offseason event in the U.S., uses the Elam Ending, an untimed end-of-game procedure, in all games. In the TBT implementation, the game clock proceeds normally until the first dead ball with 4:00 or less remaining in the fourth quarter. At that point, a "target score" is set by adding 7&amp;nbsp;points to the score of the leading team. The game then resumes, with the shot clock fully operational but the game clock shut off. The first team to reach or exceed the target score wins the game.

==Ice Hockey==
In [[ice hockey|hockey]], [[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shots]] (fairly rare) and [[Overtime (ice hockey)#Shootout|shootouts]] (similar to a penalty shot but more common—taken after regulation time and [[Overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]] end in a tie) are untimed.

'''Viejas Arena at Aztec Bowl''' (formerly named '''Cox Arena'''), located on the [[San Diego State University|San Diego State University (SDSU)]] campus in [[San Diego]], [[California]], is the home of the [[San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball]] and women's [[basketball]] teams.

[[Image:Cox Arena interior 2006-02-08.JPG|left|thumb]]
Viejas Arena was built on the site of the old [[Aztec Bowl (stadium)|Aztec Bowl]] football stadium (a [[Works Progress Administration]] project) on the SDSU campus, and the university (or its affiliated corporation) still owns the arena.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt; It was originally named Cox Arena after [[Cox Communications]], which owns one of the local [[cable television]] systems in the greater San Diego regional area, and which [[naming rights|paid fees]] to become the arena's corporate sponsor.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt; The arena was renamed to Viejas Arena under a 10-year naming rights agreement announced March 17, 2009.  The naming rights agreement with the [[Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians]] went into effect July 1 and will pay the university about $6 million over the next 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbs8.com/Global/story.asp?S=10023979&amp;nav=menu1607_2_2&lt;/ref&gt; On October 29, 2015, the basketball court was named Steve Fisher Court after men's basketball head coach [[Steve Fisher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/aztecs/sdut-viejas-steve-fisher-court-sdsu-2015oct29-story.html|title=Viejas floor named Steve Fisher Court|last=Union-Tribune|first=San Diego|newspaper=sandiegouniontribune.com|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viejas Arena hosted the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|men's NCAA basketball tournament]] first and second rounds in 2001, 2006, 2014, and 2018.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt; In the 2006 tourney, the first-round games were delayed and the building evacuated due to a bomb-sniffing dog picking up scents of a potentially dangerous substance.

Viejas Arena has also hosted [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]]'s [[Bash at the Beach (1998)|Bash at the Beach]] in 1998 and some episodes of WCW Monday Nitro. In 2007, the arena was the home of the [[San Diego Shockwave]] [[indoor American football|indoor football]] team for one season.&lt;ref name="football"&gt;[http://www.worldstadiums.com/north_america/countries/united_states/california.shtml Stadiums in the United States] at worldstadiums.com, URL accessed November 24, 2009.

Viejas Arena is also used as a large concert venue where major acts perform,&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt; including [[Britney Spears]], [[Blink-182]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[A Day To Remember]], [[Linkin Park]], [[Metallica]], [[Van Halen]], [[Green Day]], [[Gorillaz]], [[Rise Against]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[Daniel Taylor (countertenor)|Daniel Taylor]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[One Direction]], [[Fleetwood Mac]], and [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]].  The arena is often used as an alternative to the much larger [[Valley View Casino Center]] (the former Sports Arena) across town. The arena was also the host of filming [[Megadeth]]'s live DVD ''[[Blood in the Water: Live in San Diego]]''. Lady Gaga performed at Viejas Arena on her [[artRAVE: The ARTPOP Ball Tour]], on June 2, 2014.

The arena hosted [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|TNA Wrestling]]'s [[TNA Bound For Glory|Bound For Glory]] 2013 pay-per-view event on October 20, 2013.

The World Tinbath Championships take place annually in [[Castletown, Isle of Man|Castletown]] Harbour on the [[Isle of Man]]. In 2007 the 36th competition took place on Saturday 21 July.

The event is organised by The Castletown Ale Drinkers Society and sponsored by local breweries, with support from the Isle of Man Department of Tourism. It raises money for local charities. Each year there are over 100 competitors and teams from the Isle of Man and elsewhere.

Although the event is run as a fun day, the competition is fierce and [http://www.castletown.org.im/tinbaths/cads_tinbath_rules2007.html strict rules] are in place to ensure a fair and safe event.

Categories are: Men's Race, Ladies' Race, Snake Race (teams), the Rope Slide and a Flying Competition in which entrants attempt to fly over the harbour with varying degrees of failure in homemade flying machines.
