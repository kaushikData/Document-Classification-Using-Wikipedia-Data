A violent incident occurred between the [[Sant Nirankari Mission]] and traditional [[Sikh]]s on 13 April 1978 at [[Amritsar]], [[Punjab, India]]. Sixteen people&amp;mdash;thirteen traditional Sikhs and three Nirankari followers&amp;mdash;were killed in the ensuing violence. Clashes occurred when some [[Akhand Kirtani Jatha]] and [[Damdami Taksal]] members led by [[Bhai Fauja Singh|Fauja Singh]] protested against and tried to stop a convention of Sant Nirankari Mission followers. Fauja attempted to behead the Nirankari chief but was killed by his bodyguard. This incident is considered to be a starting point in the events leading to [[Operation Blue Star]] and the [[Punjab insurgency|1980s insurgency in Punjab]].

==Background==
[[Nirankari]], a movement within [[Sikhism]], started in the 19th century. Their belief in a living guru as opposed to the scriptural guru [[Guru Granth Sahib]] resulted in their difference with traditional Sikhs.&lt;ref name=mm&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marty|first1=Martin E.|last2=Appleby|first2=R.

==Incident==
On 13 April 1978, the day to celebrate the birth of [[Khalsa]], a peaceful [[Sant Nirankari Mission|Sant Nirankari]] convention headed by their leader [[Gurbachan Singh]] was organized in Amritsar, with permission from the Akali state government. The practices of "Sant Nirankaris" sect of Nirankaris was considered as heretics by the orthodox Sikhism expounded by Bhindranwale.&lt;ref name="Cynthia_Taksal78"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mahmood |first1=Cynthia Keppley |title=Fighting for Faith and Nation: Dialogues with Sikh Militants |date=1996 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=9780812215922 |page=78 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=FqvTRUrwt2UC |accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Golden Temple premises,&lt;ref name="Guha_IndiaGandhi"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Guha |first1=Ramachandra |title=India After Gandhi: The History of the World's Largest Democracy |date=2008 |publisher=Macmillan |location=[https://scroll.in/article/732426/the-bhindranwale-cult-how-politics-allowed-an-obscure-preacher-to-challenge-indian-democracy Excerpts] |isbn=9780330396110 |edition=illustrated, reprint |url=https://books.google.co.in/books/about/India_After_Gandhi.html?id=29lXtwoeA44C |accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bhindranwale delivered an angry sermon in which he declared that he would not allow this convention and would ''go there and cut them to pieces.''&lt;ref name="satp prophet"/&gt; A procession of about two hundred Sikhs led by [[Bhindranwale]] and Fauja Singh of the [[Akhand Kirtani Jatha]] left the Golden Temple, heading towards the Nirankari Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Mark|last1=Tully|first2=Satish|last2=Jacob|title=Amritsar: Mrs. Gandhi's Last Battle|date=1985|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fauja attempted to behead Nirankari chief [[Gurbachan Singh]] with his sword but was shot dead by Gurbachan's bodyguard, while Bhindranwale escaped.&lt;ref name="satp prophet"/&gt; In the [[1978 Sikh-Nirankari clash|ensuing violence]], several people were killed: two of Bhindranwale's followers, eleven members of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha and three Nirankaris.&lt;ref name="satp prophet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/publication/nightsoffalsehood/falsehood4.htm|title=Punjab: The Knights of Falsehood -- Psalms of Terror|website=Satp.org|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event brought Bhindranwale to limelight in the media.&lt;ref name="IT_Rise"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mitra |first1=Chandan |title=Bhindranwale's rise from a small-time priest was meteoric |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/india-today-35th-anniversary/story/20111226-india-today-newsmake-of-1980s-jarnail-singh-bhindranwale-750018-2011-12-15 |accessdate=6 July 2018 |work=India Today 35th anniversary |publisher=India Today |date=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
A criminal case was filed against sixty two Nirankaris charged with the murder of 13 Sikhs by the Akali led government in Punjab. The case was heard in the neighbouring [[Haryana]] state, and all the accused were acquitted,&lt;ref name="Cynthia_Taksal79"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mahmood |first1=Cynthia Keppley |title=Fighting for Faith and Nation: Dialogues with Sikh Militants |date=1996 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=9780812215922 |page=79 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=FqvTRUrwt2UC |accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis that they acted in [[self-defence]].  The Punjab government Chief Minister [[Prakash Singh Badal]] decided not to appeal the decision.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Keppley Mahmood, Fighting for Faith and Nation: Dialogues with Sikh Militants, Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1996, pp. 58–60; Gopal Singh, A History of the Sikh People, New Delhi, World Book Center, 1988, p. 739.&lt;/ref&gt; The case of Nirankaris received widespread support in the media and the orthodox Sikhs claimed this to be a conspiracy to defame the Sikh religion.&lt;ref name="Cynthia_Taksal79"/&gt;  Bhindranwale increased his rhetoric against the perceived enemies of Sikhs. A letter of authority was issued by [[Akal Takht]] to ostracize the Sant Nirankaris. A sentiment was created to justify extra judicial killings of the perceived enemies of Sikhism.&lt;ref&gt;Singh (1999), pp. 365–66.&lt;/ref&gt; The chief proponents of this attitude were the [[Babbar Khalsa]] founded by the widow, Bibi Amarjit Kaur of the [[Akhand Kirtani Jatha]], whose husband Fauja Singh had been at the head of the march in Amritsar; the Damdami Taksal led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale who had also been in Amritsar on the day of the outrage; the Dal Khalsa, formed with the object of demanding a sovereign Sikh state; and the [[All India Sikh Students Federation]], which was banned by the government.&lt;ref name="Cynthia_Taksal79"/&gt;

In the subsequent years following this event, several murders took place in Punjab and the surrounding areas allegedly by Bhindranwale's group and the new Babbar Khalsa.&lt;ref name="Cynthia_Taksal79"/&gt; The Babbar Khalsa activists took up residence in the Golden Temple, where they would retreat to, after committing "acts of punishment" on people against the orthodox Sikh tenets. Police did not entered The temple complex to avoid hurting the sentiments of Sikhs.&lt;ref name="Cynthia_Taksal79"/&gt;

[[Image:Anonymous Abbess Eufemia Szaniawska.jpg|thumb|''Eufemia Szaniawska, Abbess of the Benedictine Monastery in [[Nesvizh|Nieśwież]] with a [[crosier]]'', c. 1768, [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]]]

{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar|expanded=titles}}

In Christianity, an '''abbess''' ([[Latin]] ''abbatissa'', [[Grammatical gender|feminine form]] of ''abbas,'' [[abbot]]) is the female [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]] of a community of [[nun]]s, which is often an [[abbey]].&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

==Description==
In the [[Catholic Church]] (both the [[Latin Church]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]]), [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] abbeys, the mode of election, position, rights, and authority of an abbess correspond generally with those of an [[abbot]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abbess|volume=1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She must be at least 40 years old and have been a nun for 10 years.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age requirement in the Catholic Church has evolved over time, ranging from 30 to 60. The requirement of 10 years as a nun is only 8 in Catholicism. In the rare case of there not being a nun with the qualifications, the requirements may be lowered to 30 years of age and 5 of those in an "upright manner", as determined by the superior.&lt;ref name=ce/&gt; A woman who is of illegitimate birth, is not a virgin, has undergone non-salutory public penance, is a widow, or is blind or deaf, is typically disqualified for the position, saving by permission of the Holy See.&lt;ref name=ce/&gt; The office is elective, the choice being by the secret votes of the nuns belonging to the community.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Like an abbot, after being confirmed in her office by the [[Holy See]], an abbess is solemnly admitted to her office by a formal blessing, conferred by the bishop in whose territory the monastery is located, or by an abbot or another [[bishop]] with appropriate permission. Unlike the abbot, the abbess receives only the ring, the [[crosier]], and a copy of the rule of the order. She does not receive a [[mitre]] as part of the ceremony.&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;&lt;ref name=Colliers&gt;{{harvnb|Henneberry|1997|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abbess also traditionally adds a [[pectoral cross]] to the outside of her habit as a symbol of office, though she continues to wear a modified form of her religious habit or dress, as she is unordained—females cannot be ordained—and so does not vest or use choir dress in the liturgy.&lt;ref name=ce&gt;{{harvnb|Oestreich|1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; An abbess serves for life, except in [[Italy]] and some adjacent islands.&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

===Roles and responsibilities===
[[File:Maria Theresia Isabella Austria 1816 1867 portrait.jpg|upright|thumb|Princess [[Maria Theresa of Austria (1816–1867)|Maria Theresia Isabella of Austria]], a noble abbess with her [[crosier]].]]
Abbesses are, like abbots, major superiors according to [[canon law]], the equivalents of abbots or bishops (the ordained male members of the church hierarchy who have, by right of their own office, executive jurisdiction over a building, diocesan territory, or a communal or non-communal group of persons—juridical entities under church law). They receive the vows of the nuns of the abbey; they may admit candidates to their order's novitiate; they may send them to study; and they may send them to do pastoral or missionary, or to work or assist—to the extent allowed by canon and civil law—in the administration and ministry of a parish or diocese (these activities could be inside or outside the community's territory). They have full authority in its administration. 

However, there are significant limitations. They may not administer the [[sacraments]], whose celebration is reserved to bishops, [[priest]]s, [[deacon]]s (clerics), namely, those in [[Holy Orders]]. They may make provision for an ordained cleric to help train and to admit some of their members, if needed, as altar servers, [[Extraordinary minister of Holy Communion|extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion]], or lectors—all ministries which are now open to the unordained. They may not serve as a witness to a marriage except by special rescript. They may not administer Penance (Reconciliation), Anointing of the Sick ([[Extreme Unction]]), or function as an ordained celebrant or concelebrant of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] (by virtue of their office and their training and institution, they may act, if the need arises, as altar servers, lectors, ushers, porters, or extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion, and if need be, the Host).&lt;ref name=ce/&gt; They may preside over the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] which they are obliged to say with their community, speak on Scripture to their community, and give certain types of blessings not reserved to the clergy. On the other hand, they may not ordinarily preach a [[sermon]] or [[homily]], nor read the Gospel during Mass. As they do not receive episcopal ordination in the Catholic, Orthodox and Oriental Churches, they do not possess the ability to ordain others, nor do they exercise the authority they do possess under canon law over any territories outside of their monastery and its territory (though non-cloistered, non-contemplative female religious members who are based in a convent or monastery but who participate in external affairs may assist as needed by the diocesan bishop and local secular clergy and laity, in certain pastoral ministries and administrative and non-administrative functions not requiring ordained ministry or status as a male cleric in those churches or programs).&lt;ref name=ce/&gt; There are exigent circumstances, where due to Apostolical privilege, certain Abbesses have been granted rights and responsibilities above the normal, such as the Abbess of the [[Cistercian Monastery]] of the [[Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas]] near [[Burgos]], [[Spain]]. Also granted exceptional rights was the Abbess of the Cistercian order in [[Conversano]] [[Italy]]. She was granted the ability to appoint her own vicar-general, select and approve the confessors, along with the practice of receiving the public homage of her clergy. This practice continued until some of the duties were modified due to an appeal by the clergy to Rome. Finally in 1750, the public homage was abolished.&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

===History===
Historically, in some [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic]] monasteries, abbesses presided over joint-houses of monks and nuns,&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; the most famous example being Saint [[Brigid of Kildare|Brigid of Kildare's]] leadership in the founding of the monastery at [[Kildare]] in [[Ireland]]. This custom accompanied Celtic monastic missions to [[France]], [[Spain]], and even to [[Rome]] itself. In 1115, Robert, the founder of [[Fontevraud Abbey]] near [[Chinon]] and [[Saumur]], France, committed the government of the whole order, men as well as women, to a female superior.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches, the title of abbess (German ''Äbtissin'') has in some cases (e.g. {{Interlanguage link multi|Itzehoe Convent|de|3=Kloster Itzehoe}}) survived to designate the heads of abbeys which since the [[Protestant Reformation]] have continued as monasteries or convents (German ''[[Stift]]e'').&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; These positions continued, merely changing from Catholic to Lutheran. The first to make this change was the [[Quedlinburg Abbey|Abbey of Quedlinburg]], whose last Catholic Abbess died in 1514.&lt;ref name=ce/&gt; These are collegiate foundations, which provide a home and an income for unmarried ladies, generally of noble birth, called canonesses (German ''Kanonissinen'') or more usually ''Stiftsdamen'' or ''Kapitularinnen''. The office of abbess is of considerable social dignity, and in the past, was sometimes filled by princesses of the reigning houses.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Until the dissolution of [[Holy Roman Empire]] and [[German Mediatisation|mediatisation]] of smaller imperial fiefs by Napoleon, the evangelical Abbess of [[Quedlinburg Abbey|Quedlinburg]] was also per officio the head of that ''[[reichsunmittelbar]]'' state. The last such ruling abbess was [[Sofia Albertina, Princess of Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rambler|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hradčany]] of [[Prague]] is a Catholic institute whose mistress is titled an Abbess. It was founded in 1755 by the [[Empress Maria Theresa]], and traditionally was responsible for the coronation of the [[Queen of Bohemia]]. The Abbess is required to be an Austrian Archduchess.&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]] abbesses were known to attempt usurpation of the spiritual power forbidden them. Attempts were made to bless, give penance, make the sign of the cross on the foreheads of men, even administer the sacrament. The pope has categorized these forays into the forbidden as "unheard of, most indecorous, and highly preposterous," adding that "these Abbesses had evidently overrated theor spiritual powers a trifle."&lt;ref name=ce/&gt; The Roman Catholic Church has around 200 abbesses at present.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; The oldest women's abbey in Germany being [[St. Marienthal Abbey]] of [[Cistercian nuns]], near [[Ostritz]], established during the early 13th-century.

On September 10, 2018, the priory of Our Lady of Ephesus in Gower, MO was elevated to an Abbey and the prioress, Mother Cecilia Snell, OSB, was consecrated as the first abbess.  The Benedictines of Mary Queen of Apostles are a traditional order of Benedictines nuns whose monastery is in the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1414">The '''American Jewish Press Association''' ('''AJPA''') is an organization of [[Jewish]] newspapers, magazines, journalists, and affiliated organizations in [[North America]]. It was established in 1944 and is based in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. Back then the Jewish Press was referred to as 'Anglo-Jewish press' and some publishers and editors were not comfortable with this tag. This organization was the brainchild of Gabriel Cohen, editor and publisher of the National Jewish Post &amp; Opinion. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ajpa.org/?page=BriefHistoryAJPA|title=AJPA Official Website|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rockower Awards==

The AJPA gives the annual '''[[Simon Rockower Award|Rockower Awards]]'''. "Billed by some as the 'Jewish Pulitzers," the Rockower Awards were started in 1980 to provide incentive to Jewish media to improve their publications and to promote quality Jewish journalism." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajpa.org/?page=RockowerAwards]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Balwant Singh Nandgarh''' is a Sikh politician and [[Jathedar]] of [[Takht Sri Damdama Sahib]], one of five seats of temporal authority of [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref name=toi1&gt;{{cite news|title=Nandgarh sacking: SGPC too has been flouting Akal Takht directives for 15 years|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/Nandgarh-sacking-SGPC-too-has-been-flouting-Akal-Takht-directives-for-15-years/articleshow/45941050.cms|accessdate=21 Jan 2015|work=Times of India|date=19 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balwant Singh was a farmer in [[Nandgarh]], [[Bathinda]], [[Punjab, India]]. In 1997, he became a member of [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] (SGPC). According to [[Gurcharan Singh Tohra]], Nandgarh was given ticket to contest elections for SGPC because he was the only applicant to introduce himself as "[[Khalsa]]". In 2003, he was made the Jathedar of Takht Sri Damdama Sahib. In 2007, [[Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh]], head of [[Dera Sacha Sauda]] had appeared in an advertisement dressed up as [[Guru Gobind Singh]], 10th [[Sikh guru]]. This resulted in a widespread clashes between Dera followers and Sikhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No more screenings of 'Messenger of God' in Punjab|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-no-more-screenings-of-messenger-of-god-in-punjab-2053400|accessdate=26 January 2015|work=DNA India|date=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nandgarh formed a Sikh group called [[Ek Noor Khalsa Fauj]] to stop the religious gathering of Dera Sacha Sauda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Punjab withdraws security of Takht Damdama Sahib head|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bathinda/punjab-goverment-withdraws-security-of-takht-damdama-sahib-head/article1-1297744.aspx|accessdate=26 January 2015|work=Hindustan Times|date=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nanakshahi calendar==
Nandgarh has supported the 2003 version of [[Nanakshahi calendar]], a [[solar calendar]] created by Pal Singh Purewal to determine the dates for various [[Sikhism|Sikh]] events. In 2003, this calendar was adopted by SGPC, replacing the [[Lunar calendar|lunar]] [[Bikrami calendar]]. However, the Nanakshahi calendar created some confusion, as the dates of some festivals such as [[Holi]] and [[Diwali]], and birthdays of [[Guru Nanak]] and [[Guru Gobind Singh]] differed from the corresponding dates in the Bikrami calendar. In 2009, SGPC amended the calendar and fixed the dates of these festivals according to the Bikirami calendar. In 2014–15, according to the amended Nanakshahi calendar, [[Guru Gobind Singh]]'s birthday fell on 28 December 2014, which overlaps with the martyrdom day of his younger sons.&lt;ref name=ie1&gt;{{cite news|title=3 dates create confusion over Guru Gobind Singh’s birth anniversary|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/3-dates-create-confusion-over-guru-gobind-singhs-birth-anniversary/|accessdate=21 January 2014|work=Indian Express|date=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To resolve this, SGPC announced 7 January 2015 as the new date for celebrating Guru Gobind Singh's birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Calendar conflict born amid three dates for Gurpurb|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/calendar-conflict-born-amid-three-dates-for-gurpurb/9186.html|accessdate=21 January 2015|work=The Tribune|date=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, SGPC backtracked and re-announced 28 December 2014 as the date for the event. As per the 2003 Nanakshahi calendar, the date of this event was 5 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Akal Takht does U-turn on Gurpurb date|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/akal-takht-does-u-turn-on-gurpurb-date/article1-1289821.aspx|accessdate=21 January 2015|work=Hindustan Times|date=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nandgarh asked people to celebrate the event on 5 January. He was supported by various other Sikh organizations which demanded that the 2003 Nanakshahi calendar should be re-implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Calendar row: Nandgarh stands firm, SAD draws flak|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/calendar-row-nandgarh-stands-firm-sad-draws-flak/19879.html|accessdate=21 January 2015|work=The Tribune|date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nandgarh's support was seen as going against the SGPC and the ruling party of Punjab [[Shiromani Akali Dal]]. In 2011, the Nanakshahi calendar had been released by Ek Noor Khalsa Fauj under the patronage of Nandgarh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parkash|first1=Chandar|title=Khalsa Fauj, SAD (A) to release original version of Nanakshahi calendar|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2011/20110413/punjab.htm#6|accessdate=26 January 2015|work=The Tribune|date=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 17 January 2015, Nandgarh was removed from the office of Jathedar by the SGPC.&lt;ref name=toi1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ਸਥਾਪਤੀ ਨੂੰ ਰਾਸ ਨਹੀਂ ਆਇਆ ਹਲ ਵਾਹਕ ਜਥੇਦਾਰ|url=http://sikhsangharsh.com/?p=21440|accessdate=21 January 2015|publisher=Sikh Sangharsh|date=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to SGPC president [[Avtar Singh Makkar]], Nandgarh had violated the [[Sikh Rehat Maryada]] (religious code of conducts) and disobeyed certain decisions made by SGPC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SGPC removes Takht Sri Damdama Sahib Jathedar|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/sgpc-removes-takht-sri-damdama-sahib-jathedar-115011700520_1.html|accessdate=21 January 2015|work=Business Standard|date=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Sikh organizations such as [[Dal Khalsa (International)|Dal Khalsa]], [[Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar)]], and [[Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee]] criticized the manner in which Nandgarh was removed from his post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Experts question legality of Nandgarh's removal|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/experts-question-legality-of-nandgarh-s-removal/31494.html|accessdate=26 January 2015|work=The Tribune|date=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6037">[[Image:Biruta.JPG|thumb|right|Imaginary artistic depiction of Birutė from the 19th century]]
[[Image:Bronza statuo de Birutė en Palanga.jpg|thumb|A bronze sculpture of Birutė near her presumed grave]]
'''Birutė''' (died 1382) was the second wife of [[Kęstutis]], [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Grand Duke of Lithuania]], and mother of [[Vytautas the Great]]. There is very little known about Birutė's life, but after her death a strong cult developed among [[Lithuanians]], especially in [[Samogitia]]. 

==Life==
===Marriage===
Probably she was born near [[Palanga]] to a [[Samogitia]]n or [[Curonians|Curonian]] magnate family. The story of her marriage to Kęstutis became a romantic legend in [[Lithuania]]. Chronicles mention that Birutė was a priestess ({{lang-lt|vaidilutė}}) and served the [[Lithuanian mythology|Pagan gods]] by guarding the sacred fire. When Kęstutis heard of her beauty, he visited the shire and asked her to marry him. She refused because she had promised the gods to guard her virginity until her death. Kęstutis then took her by force to [[Old Trakai|Trakai]] and threw a big wedding. She and Kęstutis had three sons and three daughters. [[Vytautas the Great|Vytautas]], their first son, was born around 1350. This suggests that the marriage took place in 1349 or a bit earlier.

Historian S.C. Rowell suggests that a marriage to a pagan duchess rather than to an Orthodox duchess from Slavic lands helped to win pagan Lithuanian support after Kęstutis and his brother [[Algirdas]] deposed [[Jaunutis]] in 1345.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=S. C. |last=Rowell |title=Pious Princesses or Daughters of Belial: Pagan Lithuanian Dynastic Diplomacy, 1279–1423 |pages=12 | date=Spring 1994 |journal=Medieval Prosopography | volume=15 |issn=0198-9405 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
The circumstances surrounding Birutė's death are not entirely clear. Between 1381 and 1382 her husband Kęstutis waged a war against his nephew [[Jogaila]] who became the Grand Duke of Lithuania and signed a treaty with the [[Teutonic Knights]] against Kęstutis. Her husband was arrested and transported to the castle at [[Kreva]]. A week later Kęstutis was dead and some chronicles hint that he was murdered. In spite of the circumstances being unclear, one chronicle written by the Teutonic Knights briefly mentioned that Birutė was, for reasons of safety, moved to [[Brest, Belarus]], where she was drowned in fall of 1382 (likely in response to Vytautas escape from Kreva). However, there are no other sources that confirm or refute this claim. Thirty-five years later, a Samogitian delegation to the [[Council of Constance]] denied her murder, and another legend claimed that Birutė returned to the shrine where she had served earlier in Palanga, and resumed serving the gods until her death there circa 1389.

Legend has it that she was buried in Palanga at the bottom of the hill named in her honor.

==Worship==
[[Image:Palanga Birutes kalnas.jpg|250px|thumb|left|A grotto at the bottom of Birutė Hill, designed by [[Édouard André]]]]
A cult around Birutė developed and remained strong long after her death. She was considered to be a goddess or the pagan equivalent of a saint by the local people. In 1989 archaeologists found evidence of a pagan sanctuary and observatory, which had existed on the top of [[Birutė Hill]] in the late 14th or early 15th century. It was likely built in Birutė's honor. There are many accounts of people praying to Birutė, asking her to bestow good health or fortune upon them. To discourage people from worshiping pagan gods and Birutė's grave, a chapel for [[Saint George]] was built on the top of the hill in 1506. In 1869 the chapel was re-built and survives to this day. It is a popular destination for tourists.

Birutė Hill is the highest dune at the seaside resort of Palanga on the [[Baltic Sea]]shore, and now a part of the [[Palanga Botanical Garden]]. Archaeological research shows that there was a village at the bottom of the hill in the 10th century. In the 13th century, when the Teutonic Knights and [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Livonian Order]] invaded, the villagers built a defense system with a tower. After an initial defeat, the system was rebuilt and made even stronger; it now had two towers and a wall surrounded the top of the hill. However, when this was burned in the second half of the 14th century, a pagan shrine and observatory was built in its place instead.

The '''[[Bishop]] of [[Glasgow]] and [[Galloway]]''' is the [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Scottish Episcopal]] [[Diocese of Glasgow and Galloway]].

== Brief history ==

When the dioceses of Glasgow and Galloway were combined in 1837, Michael Russell, the then [[incumbent]] of [[Leith]] became the first bishop of the combined [[Episcopal see|see]]. Initially there were only three or four congregations in the south west of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;A Short History of the Episcopal Church in Scotland  (2nd Edition) 1974 - F. Goldie pp 115-117&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the establishment of St Mary's Church in Great Western Road as the cathedral of the diocese, the bishops were also incumbents of individual congregations - Michael Russell at Leith; Walter Trower at St Mary's Church in Glasgow; and William Wilson at Ayr.

The episcopate of William Harrison was specially notable for the exceptional expansion of the church in the south west of Scotland.

Bishop Reid was translated to the [[Diocese of Saint Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane]]. His successor, Bishop Darbyshire, was also translated becoming the Archbishop of Cape Town in the Church of the Province of Southern Africa (now the [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa]]).

Bishop Rawcliffe was already a bishop when he came to the diocese having previously been consecrated at the first Bishop of the New Hebrides in the [[Church of the Province of Melanesia]] between 1974 and 1980.

== Bishops of the united diocese ==

[[File:Castle of Burgos and the church of Santa María La Blanca.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Back facade of the Castle of Burgos and the church of Santa María La Blanca before the French Napoleonic invasion.]]
The '''Castle of Burgos''' was a castle and [[alcázar]], located in the city of [[Burgos]],&lt;ref&gt;Very detailed aerial view: [http://wikimapia.org/#lat=42.342769&amp;lon=-3.707408&amp;z=19&amp;l=3&amp;m=h&amp;v=2].
[[Wikimapia]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the hill of San Miguel to 75 m above the city and to 981 meters above the sea. This hill was the subject of archaeological surveys by General Centeno in the years 1925 and 1926 trying to find [[Napoleon|Napoleonic military files]] when the [[France|French]] in their retreat blew up the fortress. According to this general the origin of the castle attributes to the [[Visigoths]], and its oldest parts, to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].

As was increasing importance of the defensive emplacement, it gave way to a castle and more complex defensive elements.

During the French occupation, the June 15, 1813, the French army decided to leave the Castle of Burgos, and they destroyed it with explosives. The explosion resulted in the almost total destruction of all the castle grounds.  At present remains its ruins.

==History==

===Prehistoric archaeological site===
In the mid-1980s it conducted a complex archaeological study in which it was established that the signs of oldest human populations both in the hills del Depósito, de San Miguel and del Castillo, form an ensembles of the first order. So have appeared traces of prehistoric human groups both [[Beaker culture]], and the [[Iron Age|first Iron Age]] with attribution Soto de Medinilla. In the hill of the castle was located the oldest town on record in the city of Burgos dated around 2000 B.C..

===Foundation and Medieval ages===
In the early 860 AD the Muslim historian Ibn Idhari mentions that an expedition defeated to "Gundisalvo" Lord of Burdgia.

Oliver Copons believes that the great fortress was already built back in 865 when [[Al-Andalus|Muslims]] amounted to the Castilian plateau led by Al-Mondzir obliterating. Twenty years later the [[List of Asturian monarchs|Asturian monarch]] [[Alfonso III of Asturias|Alfonso III]] gives order to Count [[Diego Rodríguez Porcelos]] to repopulate and re-fortifying Burgos because had credited his military virtues in the Battle of Briviesca and in defend [[Pancorbo]].

The growing importance of the city requires a great fortress, whose perimeter is well documented. Medieval travelers unanimously tell the feeling of strength and security that offered. Probably during the reign of [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] occurs the first great transformation, participating experts builders to the [[Mudéjar]] taste of the time. The [[List of Castilian monarchs|Castilian king]] [[Henry IV of Castile|Henry IV]] makes the second reform, mainly for beautification, in order to transform it into palace: halls, chambers and chapel.

{{Quote|"The kings of Castile, having that fortress, has title to the kingdom, and can be with good confidence called kings of it, because it is head of Castile and chamber of the kings."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hernando del Pulgar]], '' [[Crónica de los Reyes Católicos]] '', 1481-1490&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Disputes with the city=== 
Never were good friends the city and the castle, but it endured for centuries, until the June 13 of 1813 succumbed the fortress during the [[Peninsular War|Napoleonic wars]] after a bitter resistance in the second assault by the Anglo-Portuguese troops of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]].

[[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand the Catholic]] [[Siege of Burgos (1475)|sieged]] it in the war against [[Joanna la Beltraneja]]. The siege is initiated in August 1474 and lasts until January 1476. During this period were fought some of the fiercest fighting in its history, being one of the goals off the water to the besieged, that the minelayers worked with the dual purpose of intercepting the well and blow the walls, as noted by Luciano Serrano.&lt;ref&gt;in his work ''Los Reyes Católicos y la ciudad de Burgos desde 1541 hasta 1492''  ([[Spanish National Research Council]] - 1943&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Famous prisoners === 
The Castle of Burgos was used as prison of State, being occupied by the kings  [[García II of Galicia]] and [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]] and by Tomás de Gournay, murderer of the king [[Edward II of England]].

In 1277, as referred the ''Annals of the reign of Alfonso X'', was executed in the castle of Burgos the infante [[Frederick of Castile]], son of [[Ferdinand III of Castile]], by order of his brother [[Alfonso X of Castile]], who ordered to execute at one time to [[Simón Ruiz of Cameros]], [[lord of Cameros]] and son in law of infante Frederick of Castile. The version provided by the ''Annals of the reign of Alfonso X'', after of the ''Chronicle of Alfonso X'' of the execution of infante Fadrique, is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Manuel González Jiménez  | publisher= Editorial Ariel S. A. | other = | title = Alfonso X el Sabio | url = | edition =1st | date = October 2004 | location = Barcelona | id = | isbn = 84-344-6758-5 | pages = 317 | chapter = XI| quote =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote |''"It was a thousand and three hundred and sixteen years, the Infante Don Sancho, son of King Alfonso and heir, prisonered to Don Ximón Ruiz of Cameros in Logroño by order of the king his father. Is in this year king Alfonso prisonered to Don Frederick, his brother, in Burgos, and sending him get into the castle and put in a chest that was filled with sharp irons and died there."'' (written in [[Medieval Spanish]]).}}

Later, after spending several years in an unworthy place, the remains of the infante [[Frederick of Castile]] were transferred in 1282, by order of his nephew [[Sancho IV of Castile]] to the missing [[Convento de la Santísima Trinidad (Burgos)|Convento de la Santísima Trinidad]] in Burgos, which was demolished in the 19th century.

===Gunpowder factory===
During the [[Early modern period|Early Modern Age]] and because both the evolution of military techniques, as the remoteness of the war zones, loses its former defensive function. In its enclosure was settled the first training school for gunners that have been in Spain, reaching produce twenty quintals of [[gunpowder]] daily in 1542. This was about secondary activities.

===Royal Alcázar===
The known as palace of [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X]] was inhabited by [[John II of Castile]] and also by his father [[Henry III of Castile]].

===Destruction===
A fire in 1739 resulted in the destruction of the interior, some ceilings and coffered. During the [[Peninsular War|War of Independence]] the city regained its strategic position and the [[France|French]] proceeded to an ephemeral conditioning which was a very significant transformation of the enclosure.

With the Napoleonic invasion the French soldiers set out in it their imperial battery. Between September and October 1812 the castle was the star center of the [[Siege of Burgos]] led by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], which had its base of operations in a palace located in [[Villatoro, Burgos|Villatoro]]. With the withdrawal of the French in 1813, the castle is witnessing of the last preparations that the contingent made before their final departure. There works to disappear any war or documentary material that could be useful to the enemy; the chosen procedure is explote the fortress. They make it blow up without allowing time for the evacuation of the last soldiers. More than two hundred French soldiers died in the blast, that shakes the entire population.

With the explosion, the [[Iglesia de Santa María La Blanca (Burgos)|Church of Santa María La Blanca]] was destroyed, it lost much of the windows of the [[Burgos Cathedral|cathedral]] and occurred damage on the chest of the crossing tower and in the [[San Esteban, Burgos|church of San Esteban]] while that in the chopera del Carmen are located many bodies of French soldiers.

===Semaphore line=== 
[[File:Burgos ca 1870 J. Laurent.jpg|thumb|right|Semaphore tower on the ruins of the Castle of Burgos in 1870. Photography of [[Jean Laurent (photographer)|J. Laurent]].]]
The Castle of Burgos played a key role in the communication system with the [[semaphore line]] devised in Spain in the 19th century. In the province of Burgos still are preserved remains, in various states of preservation, of the many towers that were built to communicate the center of the peninsula with the north. The Castle of Burgos was the position 27 of the [[Line of Castile]] that connected [[Madrid]] with [[Irun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://telegrafiaoptica.wikispaces.com/Burgos|title=Telegrafía Óptica - Burgos|website=telegrafiaoptica.wikispaces.com|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent times===
It was used sporadically during the [[Carlist Wars]] and also used along the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War of 1936]], settling there the antiaircraft defense of the city.

Between the years 1955 and 1958 were tried to reconstruct the blocks but regardless of the real planes.

In the last archaeological campaign (1985) was discovered the deep well and its spiral stairs. A A team of speleologists topographed the interior of the well (also known as Cueva del Moro). They descended to 61 meters noting the great constructive ashlar and its various ramifications. A great piece of engineering. Subsequently, appeared a cistern under the main courtyard.

A digital reconstruction has been made on the basis of one of the engravings of the work "Civitatis Orbi Terrarum" of 1576.

==Current status==
[[File:Castillo de burgos exteriores.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of the Castle of Burgos in 2008.]]
Today is a playground with streets dedicated to poets. The remains of the fortress, in state of ruins, has allowed its qualification as a museum, opened in 2003, or interpretation center, and it can also visit the well and the underground tunnels, known as ''Cueva del Moro''.

===Gates===
[[File:Castillo burgos puerta.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the Burgos Castle. South gate.]]
Recent archaeological excavations have uncovered the remains of the ''South Gate''. This is a broken wall, open to a vain flanked by two towers of semicircular plant. The front gate is open in the northwestern front, it has a vaulted passageway.

===Well===
As part of the underground complex, the well has galleries of more than 300 m in length. Data from the 12th and 13th centuries, although the first reports date from 1475, during the siege of the troops of [[Isabella I of Castile]], episode of the [[war of the Castilian Succession]] to the [[Crown of Castile|throne]], being defended by supporters of [[Joanna la Beltraneja]].  Factory work of ashlar in limestone, consisting of a vertical hollow cylinder reaches a depth of 61.50 m. To access are constructed 6 spindles or vertical cylinder of 1.40 m internal diameter .

{{Quote|"For that this Castle was safer and it not could take by thirst, made its founder near its entrance, on the inside, a so deep well, which for down to the birth of water has around a snail shaped stone staircase and three hundred and thirty five steps with its skylights in places that give light, although low, ''and is so artfully done that looks like work of enchantment''.&lt;ref&gt;[[José Barrio Villamor]], ''Historia de Burgos'' manuscript 1638&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other elements===
Bailey, remains of the Tower of Homage, anthropomorphic tombs, several rooms and floors.

[[Image:CharnelHouse.JPG|thumb|Contents of a [[Greek Orthodox]] charnel house showing disarticulated human skeletal remains]]
[[Image:Charnel house of AMIDADERA-temple (Nachi-Katsuura, Wakayama).jpg|thumb|Charnel house of Amidadera temple ([[Nachikatsuura, Wakayama]], [[Japan]])]]
A '''charnel house''' is a [[vault (architecture)|vault]] or building where human skeletal remains are stored. They are often built near [[Church architecture|churches]] for depositing bones that are unearthed while digging [[grave (burial)|grave]]s. The term can also be used more generally as a description of a place filled with [[death]] and destruction.

== Africa, Europe, and Asia ==
In countries where ground suitable for burial was scarce, corpses would be interred for approximately five years following death, thereby allowing decomposition to occur. After this, the remains would be exhumed and moved to an [[ossuary]] or charnel house, thereby allowing the original burial place to be reused. In modern times, the use of charnel houses is a characteristic of cultures living in rocky or arid places, such as the [[Cyclades]] archipelago and other Greek islands in the [[Aegean Sea]].

=== Monastery of the Transfiguration (Saint Catherine's), Mt. Sinai ===
[[File:Ossuary Sinai.jpg|thumb|left|Charnel House at Saint Catherine's Monastery, Mount Sinai]]
[[File:Beinhaus in Évora.JPG|thumb|Charnel house in [[Évora]]]]
[[File:Beinhaus Évora.JPG|thumb|Skulls in a charnel house]]

[[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai]] is famous for having a working charnel house. Saint Catherine's was founded by [[Justinian]] in the early 6th century, on the site of an older monastery founded about 313 AD and named for [[Helena of Constantinople]]. The monastery comprises the whole [[Eastern Orthodox Church organization|Autonomous Church]] of Sinai, under the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem|Patriarchate of Jerusalem]]. The site lies at the foot of Mount Sinai where Christians believe [[Moses]] received the Ten Commandments.&lt;ref&gt;Holy Bible NIV: Exodus 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Sinai is an inhospitable place, the brethren of St. Catherine's have struggled to eke out a subsistence-level existence. The difficulty in establishing a large cemetery in the rocky ground notwithstanding, relics are also gathered for temporal and spiritual reasons: a reminder to the monks of their impending death and fate in the hereafter. The Archbishop of Saint Catherine's is commonly the [[Abbot]] as well. After death, he is afforded the dignity of a special niche within the "Skull-House".

== North America ==
A charnel house is also a structure commonly seen in some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] societies of the Eastern United States. Major examples are the [[Hopewell culture]]s and [[Mississippian culture]]s. These houses were used specifically for [[mortuary]] services and, although they required many more resources to build and maintain than a [[crypt]], they were widely used. They offered privacy and shelter as well as enough workspace for mortuary proceedings. These proceedings included [[cremation]] (in the included crematorium) as well as defleshing of the body before the cremation. Once the houses had served their purpose, they were burned to the ground and covered by earth, creating a sort of burial [[mound]]. Anthropologist William F. Romain in ''Mysteries of the Hopewell'' notes that these charnel houses were built in the form of a square, and their diagonals could be aligned to the direction of maximum and minimum moon-sets both north and south.

== England ==
Charnel houses do not appear to have been common in England. The earliest reference found to a charnel house was in the parish of [[St Mary-at-Hill]] in London, during the sixteenth century. Few other charnel houses are attested in the seventeenth century, usually within overcrowded urban contexts.&lt;ref&gt;cf. N.J.G. Pounds, ''A History of the English Parish'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sikh practices}}
'''Dasvand''' ({{Lang-pa|ਦਸਵੰਧ}}) literally means "a tenth part" and refers the act of donating ten percent of one's harvest, both financial and in the form of time and service such as [[Selfless service|seva]] to the [[Gurdwara]] and anywhere else. It falls into [[Guru Nanak Dev]]'s concept of [[Vand Chhako]]. This was done during the time of [[Guru Arjan Dev]] and many [[Sikh]]s still do it up to this day. The concept of dasvandh was implicit in [[Guru Nanak]]'s own line:  "ghali khai kichhu hathhu dei, Nanak rahu pachhanahi sei—He alone, O Nanak, knoweth the way who eats out of what he earneth by his honest labour and yet shareth part of it with others" (GG, 1245).  The idea of sharing and giving was nourished by the institutions of [[Sangat (term)|sangat]] (holy assembly) and [[Langar (Sikhism)|langar]] (community kitchen) the [[Guru]] had established.  

In the time of [[Guru Amar Das]],  a formal structure for channelizing Sikh religion  was evolved in order to show directions to the Sikhs by preaching them the teachings of The Holy Guru .  He set up 22 [[Manji (Sikhism)|manjis]] or districts in different parts of the country. Each of these manjis was placed under the charge of a pious Sikh (both male and female) who, besides preaching [[Guru Nanak]]’s word, looked after the [[Sangat (term)|sangat]]s within his/her jurisdiction and transmitted the disciple's offerings to the [[Guru]].  As the excavation of the sacred tank at [[Amritsar]], and the erection of the central shrine, [[Harimander]], began under [[Guru Ram Das]] resulting in a large amount of expenditure, the Sikhs were encouraged to set aside a minimum of ten per cent (dasvandh) of their income for the common cause and the concept of Guru Ki Golak "Guru's treasury" was coined. [[Masand]]s, i.e. ministers and the tithe-collectors, were appointed to collect "kar bhet" (sewa offerings) and dasvandh from the Sikhs in the area they were assigned to, and pass these on to the Guru nanak

The custom of dasvandh is found in documents called rahitnamas, manuals of Sikh conduct, written during the lifetime of [[Guru Gobind Singh]] or soon after.  For example, [[Bhai Nand Lal]]’s Tankhahnama records these words of [[Gobind Singh]]:  "Hear ye Nand Lal, one who does not give dasvandh and, telling lies, misappropriates it, is not at all to be trusted."  The tradition has been kept alive by chosen Sikhs who to this day scrupulously fulfil this injunction.  The institution itself serves as a means for the individual to practice personal piety as well as to participate in the ongoing history of the community, the Guru [[Panth]] ("Guru's path").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="90124">{{short description|Cooperation between Christian denominations}}
[[File:Ecumenism symbol.jpg|thumb|A common symbol of ecumenism symbolises the Christian Church as a [[Christian cross|cross]] depicted as the [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] on a boat at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Logo|url=https://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/logo|publisher=World Council of Chuches|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
{{Christianity|related}}
The term "'''ecumenism'''" refers to efforts by [[Christian]]s of different Church traditions to develop closer relationships and better understandings. The term is also often used to refer to efforts towards the visible and organic unity of different [[Christian denominations]] in some form.

The adjective ''ecumenical'' can also be applied to any interdenominational initiative that encourages greater cooperation among Christians and their [[Christian Church|churches]], whether or not the specific aim of that effort is full, visible unity.

The terms ''ecumenism'' and ''ecumenical'' come from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|οἰκουμένη}} (''[[oikoumene]]''), which means "the whole inhabited world", and was historically used with specific reference to the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|ecumenical}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecumenical vision comprises both the search for the visible unity of the Church (Ephesians 4:3) and the "whole inhabited earth" (Matthew 24:14) as the concern of all Christians.

In Christianity the qualification ''ecumenical'' is originally (and still) used in terms such as "[[ecumenical council]]" and "[[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch]]" in the meaning of pertaining to the totality of the larger Church (such as the [[Catholic Church]] or the [[Orthodox Church]]) rather than being restricted to one of its constituent local churches or [[diocese]]s. Used in this original sense, the term carries no connotation of re-uniting the historically separated Christian denominations, but presumes a unity of local congregations in a worldwide communion.

==Purpose and goal of ecumenism==

Historically, the word was originally used in the context of large [[ecumenical council]]s that were organized under the auspices of [[Roman Emperor]]s to clarify matters of [[Christian theology]] and doctrine. These "Ecumenical Councils" brought together bishops from around the inhabited world (that is, οἰκουμένη) as they knew it at the time. There were a total of seven ecumenical councils accepted by both Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism held before the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]]. Thus, the modern meaning of the world ''ecumenical'' and ''ecumenism'' derives from this pre-modern sense of Christian unity, and the impulse to recreate this unity again.

There are a variety of different expectations of what that Christian unity looks like, how it is brought about, what ecumenical methods ought to be engaged, and what both short- and long-term objectives of the ecumenical movement should be. Ecumenism and [[nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational]] or post denominational movements are not necessarily the same thing.

==Historic divisions in Christianity==
===Christian denominations today===
If ecumenism is the quest for Christian unity, it must be understood what the divisions are which must be overcome.

Christianity has not been a monolithic faith since the [[Christianity in the 1st century|first century]] or [[Apostolic Age]], if ever, and today there exist a large variety of groups that share a common history and tradition within and without [[mainstream]] Christianity. Christianity is the largest religion in the world (making up approximately one-third of the population) and the various divisions have commonalities and differences in tradition, [[theology]], [[ecclesiology|church government]], doctrine, and language.

The world's 2.2 billion Christians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christians Analysis (2011-12-19). 'Global Christianity'. |publisher=Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life|accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; are visibly divided into different [[Communion (Christian)|communions]] or [[Christian denomination|denominations]], groupings of Christians and their churches that are in [[full communion]] with one another, but to some degree exclusive of other Christians.

The exact number of these denominations is disputed, based on differing definitions used. The largest number often quoted is "approximately 45,000" from the Center for the Study of Global Christianity at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Christianity 2015: Religious Diversity and Personal Contact|url=http://www.gordonconwell.edu/ockenga/research/documents/1IBMR2015.pdf|publisher=Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary|journal = International Bulletin of Missionary Research|volume = 39|issue = 1|pages = 28-29|date = January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''World Christian Encyclopedia'' lists "approximately 33,000" in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barett|first1=David B.|title=World Christian Encyclopedia: A Comparative Survey of Churches and Religions in the Modern World |date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, at the same time, the [[World Council of Churches]] counts only 348 member churches, representing more than half a billion members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WCC Member Churches |url=https://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches|website=World Council of Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, with the [[Catholic Church]]'s 1.25 billion Christians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Mission Day: Catholic Church Statistics 2015|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/vatican-world-mission-day-catholic-church-statis-5|publisher=Official Vatican News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that 349 churches/denominations already account for nearly 80% of the world's Christian population.

One problem with the larger numbers is that single denominations can be counted multiple times. For example, the Catholic Church is a single church, or communion, comprising 24 distinct [[sui iuris|self-governing]] [[particular church]]es in [[full communion]] with the [[pope|bishop of Rome]] (the largest being the [[Latin Church]], commonly called "Roman Catholic"). Further, the Catholic Church presence in each country is counted as a different denomination—though this is in no way an [[ecclesiology|ecclesiologically]] accurate definition. This can result in the one Catholic Church being counted as 242 distinct denominations, as in the ''World Christian Encyclopedia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Facts and Stats on '33,000. Denominations'|url=http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/a106.htm#Catholics|website=Evangelical Catholic Apologetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, single nondenominational congregations or megachurches without denominational affiliation are effectively counted each as its own denomination, resulting in cases where entire "denominations" may account for only a handful of people. Other denominations may be very small remnants of once larger churches. The United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing ([[Shakers]]) have only two full members, for example, yet are a distinct denomination.

Most current divisions are the result of historical [[schism]]s—a break in the [[full communion]] between previously united Churches, bishops, or communities. Some historical schisms proved temporary and were eventually healed, others have hardened into the denominations of today. However individual denominations are counted, it is generally acknowledged that they fall into the following major "families" of churches:
* The [[Catholic Church]];
* [[Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostal]] churches;
* [[Mainline Protestant]], [[Old Catholic]], and [[Anglican Communion]] churches; 
* The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Churches]], and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]];
* independent or marginally Christian groups and sects ([[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormons]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Unitarian Universalist]]s, [[Christadelphian]]s, etc.)

In the United States, the Historic racial/ethnic churches are sometimes counted as a distinct family of churches, though they may otherwise fit into any one of the previous categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organizational Plan|url=http://christianchurchestogether.org/organizational-plan/|publisher=Christian Churches Together in the U.S.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these families are in themselves a single communion, such as the [[Catholic Church]]. Other families are a very general movement with no universal governing authority. Protestantism, for example, includes such diverse groups as [[Adventism|Adventists]], [[Anabaptists]], [[Baptists]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], [[Evangelical Christianity|Evangelicals]], [[Holiness movement|Holiness churches]], [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Moravian Church|Moravians]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], and [[Reformed churches]]. Many of these have, as a result of ecumenical dialogue, established full or partial communion agreements.

Moreover, the classic distinction between [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]] and [[Charismatic Christianity|Charismatics]] is that the former are entire denominations (such as the [[Assembly of God]]) or include most [[nondenominational]] churches, whereas the latter are Spirit-filled Christians in already existing Catholic or mainline Protestant churches. Moreover, some Evangelical churches are also Pentecostal, though certainly not all. So there is some overlap.

===Ancient apostolic churches===
{{Further information|Christology#Post-Apostolic controversies}}

The oldest lasting [[schism]] in Christianity resulted from fifth-century disagreements on [[Christology]], heightened by philosophical, linguistic, cultural, and political differences.

The first significant, lasting split in historic Christianity, the so-called [[Nestorian Schism]], came from the [[Church of the East]], consisting largely of Eastern Syriac churches outside the Roman Empire, who left full communion after 431 in response to misunderstandings and personality conflicts at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]]. After fifteen centuries of estrangement, the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] entered into an ecumenical dialogue in the 1980s, resulting in agreement on the very issue that split them asunder, in the [[Common Christological Declaration between the Catholic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East|1994 Common Christological Declaration]], which identifies the origin of the schism as largely linguistic, due to problems of translating very delicate and precise terminology from Latin to [[Aramaic]] and vice versa.

As part of the ongoing Christological controversy, following the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, the next large split came with the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac]] and [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] churches dividing themselves. The churches dissented from Chalcedon becoming today's Oriental Orthodox Churches. These also include the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], and the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]] in India. In modern times, there have also been moves towards healing this division, with common Christological statements being made between [[Pope John Paul II]] and Syriac patriarch [[Ignatius Zakka I Iwas]], as well as between representatives of both Oriental Orthodoxy and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, J. (1911). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10489b.htm Monophysites and Monophysitism.] in The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved June 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Schism===
{{Further information|East–West Schism}}

Although the Christian world as a whole did not experience any major church divisions for centuries afterward, the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]], predominantly Greek-speaking and [[Western Christianity|Western]], predominantly Latin-speaking cultural divisions drifted toward division and isolation culminating in the mutual excommunication of [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Michael I Cerularius]] and the legate of then-deceased [[Pope of Rome]] [[Leo IX]] in 1054, in what is known as the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]]. The canonical separation was sealed by the Latin [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|sacking of Constantinople]] (1204) during the [[Fourth Crusade]] and through the poor reception of the [[Council of Florence]] (1449) among the Orthodox Eastern Churches.

The political and theological reasons for the schism are complex and multifaceted. Aside from the natural rivalry between the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]] or Byzantine Empire and the [[Franks|Franco-Latin]] [[Holy Roman Empire]], one major controversy was the inclusion and acceptance in the West in general – and in the diocese of Rome in particular – of the [[Filioque clause]] ("and the Son") into the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed]], which the East viewed as a violation of ecclesiastical procedure at best, an abuse of [[primacy of the Bishop of Rome|papal authority]] as only an [[Ecumenical Council]] could amend what had been defined by a previous council, and a heresy at worst, inasfar as the Filioque implies that the essential divinity of the Holy Spirit is derived not from the Father alone as ''arche'' (singular head and source), but from the [[perichoresis|perichoretic]] union between the Father and the Son. That the hypostasis or persona of the Spirit either is or is produced by the mutual, preeternal love between God and His Word is an explanation which Eastern Christian detractors have alleged is rooted in the medieval [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] appropriation of [[Plotinus|Plotinian]] [[Neoplatonism]]. (See Augustine of Hippo, ''[[On the Trinity|De Trinitate]]'')

Both West and East agreed that the patriarch of Rome was owed a "primacy of honour" by the other patriarchs (those of [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]], [[Constantinople]] and [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]), but the West also contended that this primacy extended to jurisdiction, a position rejected by the Eastern patriarchs. Various attempts at dialogue between the two groups would occur, but it was only in the 1960s, under Pope [[Paul VI]] and [[Patriarch Athenagoras]], that significant steps began to be made to mend the relationship between the two. In 1965, the excommunications were 'committed to oblivion'.

The resulting division remains, however, giving us the "[[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]" and the "[[Orthodox Catholic Church|Orthodox Church]]", both of which are globally distributed bodies and no longer restricted geographically or culturally to the "West" or "East", respectively. (There exists both Eastern Rite Roman Catholicism and Western Rite Orthodoxy, for example.) There is an ongoing and fruitful [[Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue between the Catholic Church and the Oriental Orthodox Churches|Catholic-Orthodox dialogue]].

===Western schisms and reformations===
{{main article|Protestant Reformation|Catholic Reformation}}
In Western Christianity, there were a handful of geographically isolated movements that preceded in the spirit of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The [[Cathars]] were a very strong movement in medieval southwestern France, but did not survive into modern times, largely as as result of the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. In northern Italy and southeastern France, [[Peter Waldo]] founded the [[Waldensians]] in the 12th century, which remains the largest non-Catholic church in Italy and is in full communion with the Italian Methodist Church. In [[Bohemia]], a movement in the early 15th century by [[Jan Hus]] called the [[Hussite]]s called for reform of Catholic teaching and still exists to this day, known as the [[Moravian Church]]. Though generally counted among [[Protestant]] churches, groups such as the Waldensians and Moravians pre-exist Protestantism proper.

The Protestant Reformation began, symbolically, with the posting of [[Martin Luther]]'s "[[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]]" in [[Saxony]] on October 31, 1517, written as a set of grievances to reform the Western Church. [[Martin Luther (resources)|Luther's writings]], combined with the work of Swiss theologian [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and French theologian and politician [[John Calvin]], sought to reform existing problems in doctrine and practice. Due to the reactions of ecclesiastical office holders at the time of the reformers, the Roman Catholic Church separated from them, instigating a rift in [[Western Christianity]]. This schism gives us the [[Mainline Protestant]] Churches, including especially the [[Lutheran]] and [[Reformed]] traditions.

In [[England]], [[Henry VIII of England]] declared himself to be supreme head of the [[Church of England]] with the [[Act of Supremacy]] in 1531, repressing both Lutheran reformers and those loyal to the pope. [[Thomas Cranmer]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] introduced the [[English Reformation]] in a form compromising between the Calvinists and Lutherans. This schism brings us today's [[Anglican Communion]].

The [[Radical Reformation]], also mid-sixteenth century, moved beyond both [[Anglican]] and [[Protestant]] reformations, emphasizing the invisible, spiritual reality of the Church, apart from any visible ecclesial manifestation. A significant group of Radical reformers were the [[Anabaptists]], people such as [[Menno Simons]] and [[Jakob Ammann]], whose movements resulted in today's communities of [[Mennonites]], [[Amish]], [[Hutterites]], and Brethren churches, and to some extent, the [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]] Communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ic.org/directory/bruderhof/|title=Bruderhof – Fellowship for Intentional Community|work=Fellowship for Intentional Community|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further reform movements within Anglicanism during the 16th through 18th centuries, with influence from the Radical Reformation, produced the [[Puritans]] and [[English Dissenters|Separatists]], giving us today's [[Baptists]], [[Congregationalists]], [[Quakers]], and eventually [[Unitarian Universalism]].

The [[Wesleyan]] and [[Methodist]] churches grew out of a revival within Anglicanism, especially in England and the [[thirteen colonies|American colonies]], under the leadership of the brothers [[John Wesley]] and [[Charles Wesley]], both priests in the Church of England. This movement also produced the [[Holiness movement]] churches.

The [[Old Catholic Church]] split from the Catholic Church in the 1870s because of the promulgation of the [[dogma]] of [[Papal Infallibility]] as promoted by the [[First Vatican Council]] of 1869–1870. The term "Old Catholic" was first used in 1853 to describe the members of the See of Utrecht who were not under Papal authority. The Old Catholic movement grew in America but has not maintained ties with Utrecht, although talks are under way between some independent Old Catholic bishops and Utrecht.

The [[Evangelical]] movement takes form as the result of spiritual renewal efforts in the anglophone world in the 18th century. According to religion scholar, social activist, and politician [[Randall Balmer]], Evangelicalism resulted "from the confluence of Pietism, Presbyterianism, and the vestiges of Puritanism. Evangelicalism picked up the peculiar characteristics from each strain – warmhearted spirituality from the Pietists (for instance), doctrinal precisionism from the Presbyterians, and individualistic introspection from the Puritans".{{Sfn | Balmer| 2004 |pp=vii–viii}} Historian [[Mark Noll]] adds to this list [[High Church]] Anglicanism, which contributed to Evangelicalism a legacy of "rigorous spirituality and innovative organization".{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | p=45}}

[[Pentecostalism]] is likewise born out of this context, and traditionally traces its origins to the 1 January 1901 outpouring of the spirit in Topeka, Kansas, at the [[Bethel Bible School]]. Subsequent charismatic revivals in [[1904–1905 Welsh Revival|Wales]] in 1904 and the  [[Azusa Street Revival]] in 1906 are held as the beginnings of the Pentecostal movement. For a Spirit-believing Christian, it is not coincidence that these started just a few hours after [[Pope Leo XIII]] lead a prayer ''Veni Spiritus Sanctus'' during his ''[[urbi et orbi]]'' message, consecrating the 20th century to the Holy Spirit and through this prayer to the reunion of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Quickness of the Spirit|url=http://www.ccr.org.uk/about-ccr/goodnews-articles/a-quickness-of-the-spirit/|website=Catholic Charismatic Renewal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern ecumenical movement==
One understanding of the ecumenical movement is that it came from the Roman Catholic Church's attempts to reconcile with Christians who had become separated over theological issues.&lt;ref name="Howard C. Kee 1998"&gt;Howard C. Kee et al., ''Christianity: a Social and Cultural History'', 2nd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ.: Prentice Hall, 1998), 379–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Others see the [[1910 World Missionary Conference]] as the birthplace of the ecumenical movement.&lt;ref&gt;Latourette, Kenneth Scott. "Ecumenical Bearings of the Missionary Movement and the International Missionary Council." In "A History of the Ecumenical Movement 1517–1948", edited by Ruth Rouse and Stephen Charles Neill, 353–73, 401–02. Geneva: World Council of Churches, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; Others yet point to the 1920 encyclical of the Eastern Orthodox [[Ecumenical Patriarch]] Germanos of Constantinople "To the Churches of Christ Everywhere" that suggested a "fellowship of churches" similar to the League of Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Grdzelidze, Tamara. "Ecumenism, Orthodoxy and" In "The Encyclopedia of Eastern Orthodox Christianity", edited by John Anthony McGuckin, 208–15. Wiley Blackwell, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nathan Söderblom]], [[Archbishop of Uppsala]], the head of the [[Church of Sweden|Lutheran church in Sweden]], is known as the architect of the ecumenical movement of the twentieth century. During the First World War, he called on all Christian leaders to work for peace and justice. His leadership of the Christian "[[Life and Work (conference)|Life and Work]]" movement in the 1920s has led him to be recognised as one of the principal founders of the ecumenical movement. His was instrumental in chairing the [[World Conference of Life and Work]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] in 1925. At the Stockholm Conference in 1925,  the culminating event in Söderblom's ecumenical work, the Anglican, Protestant, and Orthodox Christians were all present and participating, with the exception of the [[Catholic Church]], which was a much regretted absence. He was a close friend of the English ecumenist [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]].   In 1930 was one of the [[List of Nobel laureates|recipients]] of the [[Nobel Prize]], [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate, for the:''Cooperation between Christian Church Communities Brings Peace'' and the first clergyman to receive this prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1930/soderblom-bio.html|title=Nathan Söderblom, Nobel Prize Winner |publisher=/www.nobelprize.org|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1930/soderblom-facts.html|title=nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1930/soderblom-facts|publisher=www.nobelprize.org|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]], which had brought much devastation to many people, the church became a source of hope to those in need. In 1948 the first meeting of the [[World Council of Churches]] took place. Despite the fact that the meeting had been postponed due to World War II, the council took place in Amsterdam with the theme of "Man’s Disorder and God’s Design".&lt;ref name="Howard C. Kee 1998" /&gt; The focus of the church and the council following the gathering was on the damage created by the Second World War. The council and the movement went forward to continue the efforts of unifying the church globally around the idea of helping all those in need, whether it be a physical, emotional, or spiritual need. The movement led to an understanding amongst the churches that, despite difference, they could join together to be an element of great change in the world. To be an agent of hope and peace amongst the chaos and destruction that humans seem to create. More importantly the council and the movement lead to not only ecumenism but to the forming of councils amongst the denominations that connected churches across continental lines.&lt;ref name="Howard C. Kee 1998" /&gt;

Today, the [[World Council of Churches]] sees its role as sharing "the legacy of the one ecumenical movement and the responsibility to keep it alive" and acting "as a trustee for the inner coherence of the movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/about-us/achievements|title=The WCC and the ecumenical movement|publisher=oikoumene.org|accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three approaches to Christian unity==
For some [[Protestants]], spiritual unity, and often unity on the church's teachings on central issues, suffices. According to [[Lutheran]] theologian [[Edmund Schlink]], most important in Christian ecumenism is that people focus primarily on [[Jesus Christ|Christ]], not on separate church organizations. In Schlink's book ''Ökumenische Dogmatik'' (1983), he says Christians who see the risen Christ at work in the lives of various Christians or in diverse churches realize that the unity of Christ's church has never been lost,&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Schlink]], ''Ökumenische Dogmatik'' (1983), pp. 694–701; also his "Report," ''Dialog'' 1963, 2:4, 328.&lt;/ref&gt; but has instead been distorted and obscured by different historical experiences and by spiritual myopia.

Both are overcome in renewed faith in Christ. Included in that is responding to his admonition (John 17; Philippians 2) to be one in him and love one another as a witness to the world. The result of mutual recognition would be a discernible worldwide fellowship, organized in a historically new way.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Schlink]], ''Ökumenische Dogmatik'' (1983), pp. 707–08; also Skibbe, ''A Quiet Reformer'' 1999, 122–24; Schlink, ''The Vision of the Pope'' 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a significant part of the Christian world, one of the highest goals to be sought is the reconciliation of the various denominations by overcoming the historical divisions within Christianity. Even where there is broad agreement upon this goal, approaches to ecumenism vary. Generally, Protestants see fulfillment of the goal of ecumenism as consisting in general agreements on teachings about central issues of faith, with mutual pastoral accountability between the diverse churches regarding the teachings of salvation.

For Catholics and Orthodox on the other hand, the true unity of [[Christendom]] is treated in accordance with their more sacramental understanding of the [[Body of Christ]]; this ecclesiastical matter for them is closely linked to key theological issues (e.g. regarding the [[Eucharist]] and the [[historical Episcopate]]), and requires full dogmatic assent to the [[Holy Tradition|pastoral authority of the Church]] for [[full communion]] to be considered viable and valid. Thus, there are different answers even to the ''[[ecclesiology|question of the church]]'', which finally is the goal of the ecumenist movement itself. However, the desire of unity is expressed by many denominations, generally that all who profess faith in Christ in sincerity, would be more fully cooperative and supportive of one another.

For the Catholic and Orthodox churches, the process of approaching one another can be described as formally split in two successive stages: the "dialogue of love" and the "dialogue of truth".&lt;ref&gt;“A Church in Dialogue: Towards the Restoration of Unity Among Christians” (The Episcopal Commission for Christian Unity, Religious Relations with the Jews,
and Interfaith Dialogue of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, 2014), 9, 11. Online at http://www.cccb.ca/site/images/stories/pdf/A_Church_in_Dialogue_long_version_EN.PDF.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of acts belonging to the former include the mutual revocation in 1965 of the [[anathema]]s of 1054 (see below [[#Contemporary developments|Contemporary developments]]), returning the relics of [[Sabbas the Sanctified]] (a common saint) to [[Mar Saba]] in the same year, and the first visit of a Pope to an Orthodox country in a millennium ([[Pope]] [[John Paul II]] accepting the invitation of the [[Patriarch]] of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], [[Teoctist]], in 1999), among others. The later one, involving effective theological engagement on matters of dogma, is only just commencing.

Christian ecumenism can be described in terms of the three largest divisions of Christianity: Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant. While this underemphasizes the complexity of these divisions, it is a useful model.

===Catholicism===
{{Main article|Catholic Church and ecumenism}}
[[File:Te Deum Ecuménico 2009.jpg|thumb|''Te Deum Ecuménico 2009'' in the [[Santiago Metropolitan Cathedral]], Chile. An ecumenical gathering of clergy from different denominations.]]
The [[Catholic Church]] has always considered it a duty of the highest rank to seek full unity with estranged communions of fellow-Christians and, at the same time, to reject what it sees as a false union that would mean being unfaithful to or glossing over the teaching of sacred scripture and tradition.

Before the [[Second Vatican Council]], the main stress was laid on this second aspect, as exemplified in canon 1258 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law:
# It is illicit for the faithful to assist at or participate in any way in non-Catholic religious functions.
# For a serious reason requiring, in case of doubt, the Bishop's approval, passive or merely material presence at non-Catholic funerals, weddings and similar occasions because of holding a civil office or as a courtesy can be tolerated, provided there is no danger of perversion or scandal.

The 1983 [[Canon law (Catholic Church)#Codification|Code of Canon Law]] has no corresponding canon. It absolutely forbids Catholic priests to concelebrate the Eucharist with members of communities which are not in full communion (canon 908), but allows, in certain circumstances and under certain conditions, other sharing in the sacraments. The ''Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms on Ecumenism'', 102&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adoremus.org/EcumenismNorms.html Directory For The Application Of Principles And Norms On Ecumenism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; states: "Christians may be encouraged to share in spiritual activities and resources, i.e., to share that spiritual heritage they have in common in a manner and to a degree appropriate to their present divided state."

[[Pope John XXIII]], who convoked the council that brought this change of emphasis about, said that the council's aim was to seek renewal of the church itself, which would serve, for those separated from the See of Rome, as a "gentle invitation to seek and find that unity for which Jesus Christ prayed so ardently to his heavenly Father".&lt;ref&gt;Encyclical [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_xxiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_j-xxiii_enc_29061959_ad-petri_en.html ''Ad Petri cathedram'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Some elements of the Catholic perspective on ecumenism are illustrated in the following quotations from the council's decree on ecumenism, ''[[Unitatis Redintegratio]]'' of 21 November 1964, and [[Pope John Paul II]]'s encyclical, ''[[Ut Unum Sint]]'' of 25 May 1995.

{{quote|Every renewal of the Church is essentially grounded in an increase of fidelity to her own calling. Undoubtedly this is the basis of the movement toward unity … There can be no ecumenism worthy of the name without a change of heart. For it is from renewal of the inner life of our minds, from self-denial and an unstinted love that desires of unity take their rise and develop in a mature way. We should therefore pray to the Holy Spirit for the grace to be genuinely self-denying, humble. gentle in the service of others, and to have an attitude of brotherly generosity towards them. … The words of St. John hold good about sins against unity: "If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us". So we humbly beg pardon of God and of our separated brethren, just as we forgive them that trespass against us.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html ''Unitatis Redintegratio''] 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Christians cannot underestimate the burden of long-standing misgivings inherited from the past, and of mutual misunderstandings and prejudices. Complacency, indifference and insufficient knowledge of one another often make this situation worse. Consequently, the commitment to ecumenism must be based upon the conversion of hearts and upon prayer, which will also lead to the necessary purification of past memories. With the grace of the Holy Spirit, the Lord's disciples, inspired by love, by the power of the truth and by a sincere desire for mutual forgiveness and reconciliation, are called to re-examine together their painful past and the hurt which that past regrettably continues to provoke even today.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclical ''Ut unum sint'', 2[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25051995_ut-unum-sint_en.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|In ecumenical dialogue, Catholic theologians standing fast by the teaching of the Church and investigating the divine mysteries with the separated brethren must proceed with love for the truth, with charity, and with humility. When comparing doctrines with one another, they should remember that in Catholic doctrine there exists a "hierarchy" of truths, since they vary in their relation to the fundamental Christian faith. Thus the way will be opened by which through fraternal rivalry all will be stirred to a deeper understanding and a clearer presentation of the unfathomable riches of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Unitatis Redintegratio]]'', 11[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|The unity willed by God can be attained only by the adherence of all to the content of revealed faith in its entirety. In matters of faith, compromise is in contradiction with God who is Truth. In the Body of Christ, "the way, and the truth, and the life" (Jn 14:6), who could consider legitimate a reconciliation brought about at the expense of the truth?...Even so, doctrine needs to be presented in a way that makes it understandable to those for whom God himself intends it.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclical ''Ut unum sint'', 18–19[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25051995_ut-unum-sint_en.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|When the obstacles to perfect ecclesiastical communion have been gradually overcome, all Christians will at last, in a common celebration of the Eucharist, be gathered into the one and only Church in that unity which Christ bestowed on his Church from the beginning. We believe that this unity subsists in the Catholic Church as something she can never lose, and we hope that it will continue to increase until the end of time.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Unitatis Redintegratio]]'', 4[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While some Eastern Orthodox churches commonly baptize converts from the Catholic Church, thereby refusing to recognize the baptism that the converts have previously received, the Catholic Church has always accepted the validity of all the sacraments administered by the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches.

The Catholic Church likewise has very seldom applied the terms "[[heterodoxy|heterodox]]" or "[[heresy|heretic]]" to the Eastern Orthodox churches or its members, though there are clear differences in doctrine, notably about the authority of the Pope, Purgatory, and the [[filioque]] clause. More often, the term "separated" or "[[Schism|schismatic]]" has been applied to the state of the Eastern Orthodox churches.

===Orthodoxy===
[[File:Consecration of The Right Reverend Weller.jpg|350px|thumb|The consecration of [[Reginald Heber Weller|The Rt. Rev Weller]] as an Anglican bishop at the [[St. Paul's Cathedral, Fond du Lac|Cathedral of St. Paul the Apostle]] in the [[Episcopal Diocese of Fond du Lac|Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Fond du Lac]], with the Rt. Rev. Anthony Kozlowski of the [[Polish National Catholic Church]] and the [[Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow]] (along with his chaplains [[John Kochurov|Fr. John Kochurov]], and Fr. Sebastian Dabovich) of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] present]]
The [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches are two distinct bodies of local churches. The churches within each body share [[full communion]], although there is not official communion between the two bodies. Both consider themselves to be the original church, from which the [[Western Christianity|West]] was divided in the 5th and 11th centuries, respectively (after the 3rd and 7th [[Ecumenical council]]s).

Many theologians of the Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxies engage in theological dialogue with each other and with some of the Western churches, though short of full communion. The Eastern Orthodox have participated in the ecumenical movement, with students active in the [[World Student Christian Federation]] since the late 19th century. Most Eastern Orthodox&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/church-families/orthodox-churches-eastern|title=Orthodox churches (Eastern)|publisher=oikoumene.org|accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all Oriental Orthodox churches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/church-families/orthodox-churches-oriental|title=Orthodox churches (Oriental)|publisher=oikoumene.org|accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; are members of the [[World Council of Churches]]. [[Kallistos of Diokleia]], a bishop of the Eastern Orthodox Church has stated that ecumenism "is important for Orthodoxy: it has helped to force the various Orthodox Churches out of their comparative isolation, making them meet one another and enter into a living contact with non-Orthodox Christians."&lt;ref name="Diokleia_1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ware|first=Kallistos |title=The Orthodox Church|date=28 April 1993|publisher=Penguin Adult|isbn=978-0-14-014656-1|page=322}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the relationship between the Eastern Orthodox Church and the [[Anglican Communion]] has been congenial, with the Patriarch of Constantinople in 1922 recognising Anglican [[Holy orders|orders]] as valid. He wrote: "That the orthodox theologians who have scientifically examined the question have almost unanimously come to the same conclusions and have declared themselves as accepting the validity of Anglican Orders."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgbmxd/patriarc.htm The Ecumenical Patriarch on Anglican Orders&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020125091106/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgbmxd/patriarc.htm |date=January 25, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, some Eastern Orthodox bishops have assisted in the ordination of Anglican bishops; for example, in 1870, the Most Reverend Alexander Lycurgus, the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Syra and Tinos, was one of the bishops who consecrated [[Henry Mackenzie (bishop)|Henry MacKenzie]] as the [[Anglican Bishop of Nottingham|Suffragan Bishop of Nottingham]].&lt;ref name="Redmile2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Redmile|first=Robert David|title=The Apostolic Succession and the Catholic Episcopate in the Christian Episcopal Church of Canada |date=1 September 2006|isbn=978-1-60034-517-3|page=239|quote=In 1870, the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Syra and Tinos, the Most Reverend Alexander Lycurgus, paid a visit to the British Isles.

Archbishop Lycurgus agreed to assist, and on 2 February 1870, he joined in the laying on of hands with the Bishop of London at the consecration of Bishop MacKenzie. Thus the Apostolic Succession in the Greek Orthodox Church was passed on to the Bishops of the Anglican Communion, and through them to the Christian Episcopal Churches in the United States of America and the Dominion of Canada.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published source|date=September 2017}} From 1910–1911, the era before [[World War I]], [[Raphael of Brooklyn]], an Eastern Orthodox bishop, "sanctioned an interchange of ministrations with the [[Anglicanism|Episcopalians]] in places where members of one or the other communion are without clergy of their own".&lt;ref name="Herbermann1912"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herbermann|first=Charles|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference on the Constitution, Doctrine, Discipline, and History of the Catholic Church|accessdate=15 April 2014|year=1912|publisher=Robert Appleton|page=149|quote=This A.E.O.C.U. is particularly active in the United States, where the existence side by side of Westerns and Easterns offers special facilities for mutual intercourse.

Furthermore, when an Orthodox Layman is dying, if he confesses his sins, and professes that he is dying in the full communion of the Orthodox Faith, as expressed in the Orthodox version of the Nicene Creed, and the other requirements of the said Church, and desires the Blessed Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, at the hands of an Episcopal Clergyman, permission is hereby given to administer to him this Blessed Sacrament, and to be buried according to the Rites and Ceremonies of the Episcopal Church.

===Anglicanism and Protestantism===
{{Refimprove|date=December 2015}}

====Anglicanism====
{{main article|Anglican Communion and ecumenism}}

The members of the [[Anglican Communion]] have generally embraced the Ecumenical Movement, actively participating in such organizations as the [[World Council of Churches]] and the [[National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA]]. Most provinces holding membership in the Anglican Communion have special departments devoted to ecumenical relations; however, the influence of [[Liberal Christianity]] has in recent years caused tension within the communion, causing some to question the direction ecumenism has taken them.

Each member church of the Anglican Communion makes its own decisions with regard to [[intercommunion]]. The 1958 [[Lambeth Conference]] recommended "that where between two Churches not of the same denominational or confessional family, there is unrestricted ''[[full communion|communio in sacris]]'', including mutual recognition and acceptance of ministries, the appropriate term to use is '[[full communion]]', and that where varying degrees of relation other than 'full communion' are established by agreement between two such churches the appropriate term is '[[intercommunion]]'."

Full communion has been established between Provinces of the Anglican Communion and these Churches:
*[[Old Catholic Church]]es of Europe
*[[Philippine Independent Church]]
*[[Mar Thoma Syrian Church of Malabar]]
*[[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]
*[[Moravian Church]] in America, Northern and Southern Provinces

Full communion has been established between the Anglican Churches of Europe ([[Church of England|England]], [[Church in Wales|Wales]], [[Episcopal Church of Scotland|Scotland]], [[Church of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Spanish Reformed Episcopal Church|Spain]], [[Lusitanian Catholic Apostolic Evangelical Church|Portugal]] and [[Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe|Gibraltar in Europe]]) and the Lutheran Churches of Northern Europe ([[Church of Norway|Norway]], [[Church of Sweden|Sweden]], [[Church of Denmark|Denmark]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland|Finland]], [[Church of Iceland|Iceland]], [[Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church|Estonia]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Lithuania|Lithuania]], [[Lutheran Church in Great Britain|Great Britain]] and the [[Latvian Evangelical Lutheran Church Abroad]]) with the [[Porvoo Communion]]. 

The [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] is currently engaged in dialogue with the following religious bodies:
*[[Churches Uniting in Christ]] (CUIC)
*[[Eastern Orthodox Church]]
*[[Roman Catholic Church]]
*[[Presbyterian Church USA]]
*[[United Methodist Church]]
*[[Reformed Episcopal Church]] and the [[Anglican Province of America]]

Worldwide, an estimated forty million Anglicans belong to churches that do not participate in the Anglican Communion {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}, a particular organization limited to one province per country. In these Anglican churches, there is strong opposition to the ecumenical movement and to membership in such bodies as the World and National Councils of Churches. Most of these churches are associated with the [[Continuing Anglican movement]] or the movement for [[Anglican realignment]]. While ecumenicalism in general is opposed, certain Anglican church bodies that are not members of the Anglican Communion—the [[Free Church of England]] and the [[Church of England in South Africa]], for example—have fostered close and cooperative relations with other evangelical (if non-Anglican) churches, on an individual basis.

====Protestantism====
Nicolaus Ludwig, Count von [[Zinzendorf]], (1700–1760) the renewer of the [[Unitas Fratrum]] / [[Moravian Church]] in the 18th century, was the first person to use the word "ecumenical" in this sense. His pioneering efforts to unite all Christians, regardless of denominational labels, into a "Church of God in the Spirit"—notably among [[Germany|German]] immigrants in [[Pennsylvania]]—were misunderstood by his contemporaries and 200 years before the world was ready for them.

The contemporary ecumenical movement for Protestants is often said to have started with the 1910 [[Edinburgh Missionary Conference]]. However this conference would not have been possible without the pioneering ecumenical work of the Christian youth movements: the [[Young Men's Christian Association]] (founded 1844), the [[Young Women's Christian Association]] (founded 1855), the [[World Student Christian Federation]] (founded 1895), and the Federal Council of Churches (founded 1908), predecessor to today's [[National Council of Churches USA]].

Led by [[Methodist]] layman [[John R. Mott]] (former YMCA staff and in 1910 the General Secretary of WSCF), the World Mission conference marked the largest Protestant gathering to that time, with the express purposes of working across denominational lines for the sake of [[Mission (Christian)|world missions]]. After the [[First World War]] further developments were the "Faith and Order" movement led by [[Charles Henry Brent]], and the "[[Life and Work (conference)|Life and Work]]" movement led by [[Nathan Soderblom]]. In the 1930s, the tradition of an annual [[World Communion Sunday]] to celebrate ecumenical ties was established in the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|Presbyterian Church]] and was subsequently adopted by several other denominations.

Eventually, formal organizations were formed, including the [[World Council of Churches]] in 1948, the [[National Council of Churches]] in the United States in 1950, and [[Churches Uniting in Christ]] in 2002. These groups are moderate to liberal, theologically speaking, as Protestants are generally more liberal and less traditional than Anglicans, Orthodox, and Roman Catholics.

Protestants are now involved in a variety of ecumenical groups, working in some cases toward organic denominational unity and in other cases for cooperative purposes alone. Because of the wide spectrum of Protestant denominations and perspectives, full cooperation has been difficult at times. [[Edmund Schlink]]'s ''Ökumenische Dogmatik'' (1983, 1997) proposes a way through these problems to mutual recognition and renewed church unity.

In 1999, the representatives of [[Lutheran World Federation]] and [[Roman Catholic Church]] signed the [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]], resolving the conflict over the nature of [[Justification (theology)|Justification]] which was at the root of the [[Protestant Reformation]], although some conservative Lutherans did not agree to this resolution. On July 18, 2006, delegates to the [[World Methodist Council|World Methodist Conference]] voted unanimously to adopt the Joint Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/site/c.gjJTJbMUIuE/b.1863123/k.FF49/World_Methodists_approve_further_ecumenical_dialogue.htm|title=News Archives|publisher=UMC.org|date=July 20, 2006|accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0604186.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20060725190303/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0604186.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 25, 2006 |title=CNS Story: Methodists adopt Catholic-Lutheran declaration on justification |publisher=Catholicnews.com |date=July 24, 2006 |accessdate=10 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary developments==
[[File:Taizé prayer.JPG|thumb|250px|Ecumenical worship service at the [[monastery]] of [[Taizé]].]]

===Catholic–Orthodox dialogue===
The mutual [[anathema]]s (excommunications) of 1054, marking the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] between Western (Catholic) and Eastern (Orthodox) branches of Christianity, a process spanning several centuries, were revoked in 1965 by Pope Paul VI and the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]]. The Roman Catholic Church does not regard Orthodox Christians as excommunicated, since they personally have no responsibility for the separation of their churches. In fact, Catholic rules admit the Orthodox to communion and the other sacraments in situations where the individuals are in danger of death or no Orthodox churches exist to serve the needs of their faithful. However, Orthodox churches still generally regard Roman Catholics as excluded from the sacraments and some may even not regard Catholic sacraments such as baptism and ordination as valid.

In November 2006, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] traveled to Istanbul at the invitation of [[Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople]] and participated in the feast day services of St. Andrew the First Apostle, the patron saint of the Church of Constantinople. The Ecumenical Patriarch and Pope Benedict had another historic meeting in Ravenna, Italy in 2007.  The [[Declaration of Ravenna]] marked a significant rapprochement between the Roman Catholic and Orthodox positions. The declaration recognized the bishop of Rome as the Protos, or first among equals of the Patriarchs.  This acceptance and the entire agreement was hotly contested by the Russian Orthodox Church. The signing of the declaration highlighted the pre-existing tensions between the Patriarch of Constantinople and the Moscow Patriarchate.  Besides their theological concerns, the Russian Orthodox have continuing concerns over the question of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] that operate in what they regard as Orthodox territory.  This question has been exacerbated by disputes over churches and other property that the Communist authorities once assigned to the Orthodox Church but whose restoration these Churches have obtained from the present authorities.

A major obstacle to improved relations between the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches has been the insertion of the Latin term [[filioque]] into the [[Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed]] in the 8th and 11th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P17.HTM#XTCatechism |title= Cathecism of the Catholic Church, 247 |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This obstacle has now been effectively resolved. The Roman Catholic Church now recognizes that the Creed, as confessed at the [[First Council of Constantinople]], did not add "and the Son", when it spoke of the Holy Spirit as proceeding from the Father. When quoting the [[Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed]], as in the 6 August 2000 document ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'', it does not include ''filioque''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20000806_dominus-iesus_en.html |title=Dominus Iesus |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2013-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411015820/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20000806_dominus-iesus_en.html |archivedate=2013-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It views as complementary the Eastern-tradition expression "who proceeds from the Father" (profession of which it sees as affirming that he comes from the Father through the Son) and the Western-tradition expression "who proceeds from the Father and the Son", with the Eastern tradition expressing firstly the Father's character as first origin of the Spirit, and the Western tradition giving expression firstly to the consubstantial communion between Father and Son; and it believes that, provided this legitimate complementarity does not become rigid, it does not affect the identity of faith in the reality of the same mystery confessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/TREATBR.HTM |title=Article 1 of the Treaty of Brest |publisher=Ewtn.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing dialogues at both international and national level continues between the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches.  A particularly close relationship has grown up between Pope Francis and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew.  Both church leaders have in particular emphasized their common concern for refugees and persecuted Christians in the Middle East.  The 2016 [[Pan-Orthodox Council]] that was held in Crete aroused great expectations for advances in Church unity. Unfortunately, not all Orthodox churches participated and, as a result, the Russian Patriarch refused to recognize the council as a truly ecumenical gathering.  A major milestone in the growing rapprochement between the Catholic and Orthodox churches was the 12 February 2016 meeting held in Havana, Cuba between Patriarch Kirill and Pope Francis. The two church leaders issued a [[Joint Declaration of Pope Francis and Patriarch Kirill]] at the conclusion of their discussions.

===Issues within Protestantism===
Contemporary developments in mainline Protestant churches have dealt a serious blow to ecumenism. The decision by the U.S. [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] to ordain [[Gene Robinson]], an openly gay, non-celibate priest who advocates same-sex blessings, as bishop led the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] to suspend its cooperation with the Episcopal Church. Likewise, when the [[Church of Sweden]] decided to bless same-sex marriages, the Russian Patriarchate severed all relations with the Church, noting that "Approving the shameful practice of same-sex marriages is a serious blow to the entire system of European spiritual and moral values influenced by Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.pravda.ru/%20main/18/90/359/16696_gay.html Russian Orthodox Church condemns Lutheran gay weddings] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606075539/http://english.pravda.ru/%20main/18/90/359/16696_gay.html |date=2011-06-06 }} ''Pravda,'' 30 December 2005. Accessed 24 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop [[Hilarion Alfeyev]] commented that the inter-Christian community is "bursting at the seams". He sees the great dividing line—or "abyss"—not so much between old churches and church families as between "traditionalists" and "liberals", the latter now dominating Protestantism, and predicted that other Northern Protestant Churches will follow suit and this means that the "ecumenical ship" will sink, for with the liberalism that is materializing in European Protestant churches, there is no longer anything to talk about.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.synod.com/synod/en/documents/enart_interviewrocor.html Bishop Hilarion Alfeyev: Will the Ecumenical Ship Sink?] The Official Website of the Synod of Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia. Accessed 24 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations such as the [[World Council of Churches]], the [[National Council of Churches USA]], [[Churches Uniting in Christ]], [[Pentecostal Charismatic Peace Fellowship]] and [[Christian Churches Together]] continue to encourage ecumenical cooperation among Protestants, Eastern Orthodox, and, at times, Roman Catholics. There are universities such as the [[University of Bonn]] in Germany that offer degree courses in "Ecumenical Studies" in which theologians of various denominations teach their respective traditions and, at the same time, seek for common ground between these traditions.

The Global Christian Forum (GCF) was founded in 1998 following the proposal of the then General Secretary of the WCC, Rev. Konrad Raiser, that a new, independent space should be created where participants could meet on an equal basis to foster mutual respect and to explore and address together common concerns. The GCF brought in two advantages: historic freshness and [[postmodern Christianity|postmodern approach]].&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, "Unity in the Body", ''Journal of Contemporary Christian'', Vol. 3, No. 1 {{ISSN|2231-5233}} (Bangalore: CFCC, August 2011), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by the ecumenical movement, the "scandal of separation" and local developments, a number of [[United and uniting churches]] have formed; there are also a range of mutual recognition strategies being practiced where formal union is not feasible. An increasing trend has been the sharing of church buildings by two or more denominations, either holding separate services or a single service with elements of all traditions.

==Opposition to ecumenism==
===Opposition from some Protestants===
There are some members of the [[United Methodist Church]] who oppose ecumenical efforts which are "not grounded in the doctrines of the Church" due to concerns over theological compromise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.episcopalchurch.org/documents/abrahampaper.pdf|title=United Methodist Evangelicals and Ecumenism|year=2012|publisher=Southern Methodist University|accessdate=11 November 2012|author=William J. Abraham|author-link=William J. Abraham}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an article published in ''Catalyst Online: Contemporary Evangelical Perspectives for United Methodist Seminarians'' stated that false ecumenism might result in the "blurring of theological and confessional differences in the interests of unity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalystresources.org/issues/303balmer.html |publisher=Catalyst Online: Contemporary Evangelical Perspectives for United Methodist Seminarians |year=1998 |title=The Future of American Protestantism |accessdate=11 November 2012 |author=Randall Balmer |author-link=Randall Balmer |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415002847/http://catalystresources.org/issues/303balmer.html |archivedate=April 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) bars its clergy from worshiping with other faiths, contending "that church fellowship or merger between church bodies in doctrinal disagreement with one another is not in keeping with what the Bible teaches about church fellowship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.episcopalchurch.org/documents/abrahampaper.pdf|title=A Brief Statement of the Doctrinal Position of the Missouri Synod|year=2009|publisher=Concordia Publishing House|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with this position, a Connecticut LCMS pastor was asked to apologize by the president of the denomination, and did so, for participating in an interfaith prayer vigil for the 26 children and adults [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|killed at a Newtown elementary school]]; and a LCMS pastor in New York was suspended for praying at an interfaith vigil in 2001, twelve days after the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/pastor-apologizes-role-prayer-vigil-connecticut-massacre-021918940.html |title=Pastor apologizes for role in prayer vigil after Connecticut massacre |publisher=Reuters |year=2013 |accessdate=7 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208120345/http://news.yahoo.com/pastor-apologizes-role-prayer-vigil-connecticut-massacre-021918940.html |archivedate=February 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another conservative Lutheran body, the [[American Association of Lutheran Churches]], is strongly opposed to ecumenical (more accurately, [[interfaith dialogue|interfaith]]) dialogue with non-Christian religions and with denominations it identifies as cults.

When the [[Manhattan Declaration: A Call of Christian Conscience|Manhattan Declaration]] was released, many prominent [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] figures – particularly of the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] Reformed tradition – opposed it, including [[John F. MacArthur]], [[D. James Kennedy]], [[Alistair Begg]], [[R. C. Sproul]], and [[Arminianism|Arminian]] Protestant teacher and televangelist [[John Ankerberg]].

===Opposition from some Orthodox Christians===

Practically, "the whole of Eastern Orthodoxy holds membership in the [[World Council of Churches]]."&lt;ref name="Fey2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fey|first=Harold C.|title=A History of the Ecumenical Movement, Volume 2: 1948–1968|date=1 December 2009|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-60608-910-1|page=304|quote=With the exception of the Orthodox Church of Albania the whole of Eastern Orthodoxy holds membership in the World Council of Churches.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germanus V of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch Germanus V of Constantinople]]'s 1920 letter "'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded League of Nations" was an inspiration for the founding of the World Council of Churches; as such "Constantinople, along with several of the other Orthodox Churches, was represented at the Faith and Order Conferences at Lausanne in 1927 and at Edinburgh in 1937. The Ecumenical Patriarchate also participated in the first Assembly of the WCC at Amsterdam in 1948, and has been a consistent supporter of the work of the WCC ever since."&lt;ref name="Ware1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ware|first=Kallistos|title=The Orthodox Church|date=29 April 1993|publisher=Penguin Adult|isbn=978-0-14-014656-1|page=322|quote=From the beginning of the twentieth century the Ecumenical Patriarchate has shown a special concern for Christian reconciliation. At his accession in 1902, Patriarch Joachim III sent an encyclical letter to all the autocephalous Orthodox Churches, asking in particular for their opinion on relations with other Christian bodies. In January 1920 the Ecumenical Patriarchate followed this up with a bold and prophetic letter addressed 'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded League of Nations. Many of the ideas in this letter anticipate subsequent developments in the WCC. Constantinople, along with several of the other Orthodox Churches, was represented at the Faith and Order Conferences at Lausanne in 1927 and at Edinburgh in 1937. The Ecumenical Patriarchate also participated in the first Assembly of the WCC at Amsterdam in 1948, and has been a consistent supporter of the work of the WCC ever since.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many Orthodox Christians are vehemently opposed to ecumenism with other Christian denominations. They view ecumenism, as well as interfaith dialog, as being potentially pernicious to Orthodox Church Tradition; a "weakening" of Orthodoxy itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecumenism Awareness Introduction|accessdate=2008-12-30|url=http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/ecumenism/|author=Patrick Barnes|publisher=Orthodox Christian Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Eastern Orthodox world, the monastic community of [[Mount Athos]], arguably the most important center of Orthodox spirituality, has voiced its concerns regarding the ecumenist movement and opposition to the participation of the Orthodox Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorandum on the Participation of the Orthodox Church in the World Council of Churches|date=2007-02-18|accessdate=2008-11-01|url=http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/ecumenism/memorandum-on-the-participation-of-the-orthodox-church-in-the-world-council-of-churches.aspx|author=The Theological Committee of the Sacred Community of Mount Athos|publisher=orthodoxinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They regard modern ecumenism as compromising essential doctrinal stands in order to accommodate other Christians, and object to the emphasis on dialogue leading to intercommunion rather than conversion on the part of participants in ecumenical initiatives. [[Greek Old Calendarists]] also claim that the teachings of the [[Seven Ecumenical Councils]] forbid changing the church calendar through abandonment of the [[Julian calendar]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The Inter-Orthodox Theological Conference entitled "Ecumenism: Origins, Expectations, Disenchantment",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/ecumenism/thess_conclusions.aspx|title=Conclusions of the Inter-Orthodox Theological Conference "Ecumenism: Origins Expectations Disenchantment"|publisher=orthodox.info|accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized in September 2004 by the [[Aristotelian University of Thessaloniki]] has drawn negative conclusions on ecumenism.

===Political parties===
{{Christian Democracy sidebar}}
[[Christian democracy]] is a centrist political ideology inspired by [[Catholic social teaching]] and [[Neo-Calvinist]] theology.&lt;ref name="Monsma2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Monsma|first=Stephen V.|title=Pluralism and Freedom: Faith-based Organizations in a Democractic Society|year=2012|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|language=English|isbn=9781442214309|page=13|quote=This is the Christian Democratic tradition and the structural pluralist concepts that underlie it. The Roman Catholic social teaching of subsidiarity and its related concepts, as well as the parallel neo-Calvinist concept of sphere sovereignty, play major roles in structural pluralist thought.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian democratic political parties came to prominence after [[World War II]] after Roman Catholics and Protestants worked together to help rebuild war-torn Europe.&lt;ref name="Witte1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Witte|first=John|title=Christianity and Democracy in Global Context|year=1993|publisher=Westview Press|language=English |isbn=9780813318431|page=9|quote=Concurrent with this missionary movement in Africa, both Protestant and Catholic political activists helped to restore democracy to war-torn Europe and extend it overseas. Protestant political activism emerged principally in England, the Lowlands, and Scandinavia under the inspiration of both social gospel movements and neo-Calvinism. Catholic political activism emerged principally in Italy, France, and Spain under the inspiration of both Rerum Novarum and its early progeny and of neo-Thomism. Both formed political parties, which now fall under the general aegis of the Christian Democratic Party movement. Both Protestant and Catholic parties inveighed against the reductionist extremes and social failures of liberal democracies and social democracies. Liberal democracies, they believed, had sacrificed the community for the individual; social democracies had sacrificed the individual for the community. Both parties returned to a traditional Christian teaching of "social pluralism" or "subsidiarity," which stressed the dependence and participation of the individual in family, church, school, business, and other associations. Both parties stressed the responsibility of the state to respect and protect the "individual in community."}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its inception, Christian Democracy fosters an "ecumenical unity achieved on the religious level against the [[state atheism|atheism]] of the government in the Communist countries".&lt;ref name="Dussel1981"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dussel|first=Enrique|title=A History of the Church in Latin America|year=1981|publisher=Wm.

==Ecumenical symbols==
===Ecumenical symbol===
The ecumenical symbol pre-dates the [[World Council of Churches]] (WCC), formed in 1948, but is incorporated into the official logo of the WCC and many other ecumenical organizations.

{{quotation|The church is portrayed as a boat afloat on the sea of the world with the mast in the form of a cross. These early Christian symbols of the church embody faith and unity and carry the message of the ecumenical movement.... The symbol of the boat has its origins in the gospel story of the calling of the disciples by Jesus and the stilling of the storm on Lake Galilee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ecumenical Symbol|url=https://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/logo|website=World Council of Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Christian flag===
{{Main article|Christian Flag}}
[[File:Christian flag.svg|right|thumb|The Christian flag]]

Though originating in the Wesleyan tradition, and most popular among mainline and evangelical Protestant churches, the "Christian Flag"  stands for no creed or denomination, but for Christianity. With regard to the [[Christian symbolism]] of the flag:

{{quotation|The ground is white, representing peace, purity and innocence. In the upper corner is a blue square, the color of the unclouded sky, emblematic of heaven, the home of the Christian; also a symbol of faith and trust. in the center of the blue is the cross, the ensign and chosen symbol of Christianity: the cross is red, typical of Christ's blood.&lt;ref name=CA1909&gt;{{cite journal|date=7 January 1909|title=Christian Flag|journal=[[The Christian Advocate]]|publisher=T. Carlton &amp; J. Porter|location=New York|volume=84|quote=Within recent years (1897) a flag has been designed which shall stand as an emblem around which all Christian nations and various denominations may rally in allegiance and devotion. This banner is called the Christian flag. It was originated by Charles C. Overton of Brooklyn, N.Y., whose first thought of it came to him while addressing a Sunday school at a rally day service. The flag is most symbolic. The ground is white, representing peace, purity and innocence. In the upper corner is a blue square, the color of the unclouded sky, emblematic of heave, the home of the Christian; also a symbol of faith and trust. in the center of the blue is the cross, the ensign and chosen symbol of Christianity: the cross is red, typical of Christ's blood. The use of the national flag in Christian churches has become almost universal throughout the world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An ecumenical Christian organization, the [[Federal Council of Churches]] (now succeeded by the [[National Council of Churches]] and [[Christian Churches Together]]), adopted the flag on 23 January 1942.&lt;ref name=CA2014&gt;{{cite journal|year=1942|title=Resolution|journal=Federal Council Bulletin|publisher=Religious Publicity Service of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America|volume=25-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eugene B. Borowitz''' (February 20, 1924 – January 22, 2016) was an American leader and philosopher in [[Reform Judaism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Daniel F. Moore|title=Jesus, an Emerging Jewish Mosaic: Jewish Perspectives, Post-Holocaust|date=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=0567105946}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 January 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; known largely for his work on Jewish [[theology]] and [[Jewish ethics]]. He also edited a Jewish journal, ''Sh'ma'', and taught at the [[Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion]].

He was awarded the [[Maurice N. Eisendrath Bearer of Light Award]] by the [[Union for Reform Judaism]] (2005), selected as a Scholar of Distinction for a retrospective on his work by the [[Jewish Publication Society]] (2002) and given the [[Jewish Cultural Achievement]] medal for scholarship by the [[National Foundation for Jewish Culture]]. He received the [[National Jewish Book Award]] (1974) for ''The Mask Jews Wear''. ''Jewish Spiritual Journeys: Essays in Honor of Eugene B. Borowitz on his 70th Birthday'' was published in his honor in 1997.

As is apparent from a bibliography of his works, Borowitz was a prolific author.

During the [[Korean War]], he served as a [[chaplain]] for the [[U.S. Navy]]. Borowitz held degrees from [[Ohio State University]], [[Columbia University]] and [[Hebrew Union College|HUC-JIR]].

== Early life ==
Borowitz grew up in [[Columbus, Ohio]], and attended [[Ohio State University]]. After graduation, he went to [[Hebrew Union College]] in [[Cincinnati]], where he was ordained as a Rabbi in 1948 and received his D.H.L. in 1950.

== Career ==
Borowitz became the founding rabbi of the [[Community Synagogue]] in [[Port Washington, New York]], while at the same time pursuing a PhD. in religion from the joint program sponsored by [[Columbia University]] and [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]]. In 1957, he was appointed as director of the Religious Education Department of the [[Union of American Hebrew Congregations]]. Because of this, he switched to Columbia's doctoral program in education and received the Ed.D. in 1958. From 1962 until his death, he was a faculty member at the New York campus of [[Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion]], where he became the Sigmund L. Falk Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Education and Jewish Religious Thought. He was elected as the first Jewish president of the [[American Theological Society]] in 1981 and served until 1982 &lt;ref name="amtheosox-presidents"&gt;"[http://www.amtheosoc.org/presidents American Theological Society List of Presidents]" ''American Theological Society List of Presidents'' American Theological Society Retrieved 2016-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="HUC-directory"&gt;"[http://huc.edu/directory/eugene-b-borowitz Eugene B. Borowitz, Rabbi, D.H.L., Ed.D.]" ''Directory'', Hebrew Union College. Retrieved 2016-01-23.&lt;/ref&gt; He celebrated his hundredth semester with the college in 2012.

Borowitz is best known for his development of "covenant theology," a term he first introduced in a 1961 article in ''Commentary''.&lt;ref&gt;Borowitz, Eugene B. (July 1961). "[https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/crisis-theology-the-jewish-community/ Crisis Theology and the Jewish Community]." ''Commentary'', 32(1), p. 36-42. Online version retrieved 2016-01-31.&lt;/ref&gt; His work concerned itself with the dilemma of the postmodern Jew: committed to individual autonomy, but nevertheless involved with God, Torah and Israel. His interest in redefining covenant led him to significant work in normative ethics, some of which was collected in his book ''Exploring Jewish Ethics'' (264), and his teaching on the subject led to the volume, ''Reform Jewish Ethics and the Halakhah'' (298). Borowitz's work in covenant theology found its mature expression in his 1991 book, ''Renewing the Covenant'' (273).

One of Borowitz's most significant accomplishments was his founding of ''[http://www.shma.com/ Sh'ma, a Journal of Jewish Responsibility]'' in 1970. He was its publisher and editor for twenty-three years, and he served as Senior Editor from 1993 to 1997. ''Sh'ma'' provided a forum where voices from all segments of the Jewish community could be heard on a wide range of controversial topics. Borowitz wrote numerous short book reviews for ''Sh'ma''.

== Personal life ==
Borowitz died January 22, 2016 at the age of 91 at his home in Stamford, Connecticut.&lt;ref name=Forward-Obit-2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Rabbi Eugene Borowitz, 'Larger-Than-Life' Reform Leader and Teacher, Dies at 91|url=http://forward.com/news/obituaries/331456/rabbi-eugene-borowitz-larger-than-life-reform-leader-and-teacher-dies-at-91/|work=[[Jewish Forward]]|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-Obit-2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berger|first1=Joseph|title=Rabbi Eugene B.

[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special agent|Special Agent]] '''Fox William Mulder''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ʌ|l|d|ər}}) is a fictional character in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] science fiction-[[supernatural fiction|supernatural]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]'', played by [[David Duchovny]]. Mulder's peers consider his (often correct) theories on [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] activity as spooky and far-fetched. With his FBI partner [[Dana Scully]], he works in the [[X-File]]s office, which is concerned with cases with particularly mysterious or possibly paranormal circumstances that were left unsolved and shelved by the FBI. Mulder was a main character for the first [[The X-Files (season 7)|seven seasons]], but was limited to a [[recurring character]] for the following two seasons. He returns as a main character for the [[The X-Files (season 10)|tenth]] and [[The X-Files (season 11)|eleventh]] seasons.

Mulder made his first appearance in the [[The X-Files (season 1)|first season]] [[Pilot (The X-Files)|pilot episode]], broadcast in 1993. Mulder believes in extraterrestrial [[unidentified flying objects]] (UFOs) and a [[conspiracy theory|government conspiracy]] to hide or deny the truth of their existence. Mulder considers the X-Files and the truth behind the supposed conspiracy so important that he has made them the main focus of his life.

==Character arc==

Mulder was born on October 13, 1961 in [[Chilmark, Massachusetts]]. The mysterious disappearance of Mulder's [[Samantha Mulder|sister]] and his ensuing search for her became the consuming drive of his life.&lt;ref name="Dreamland"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Dreamland (The X-Files) | title=Dreamland | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Kim Manners]] &amp; [[Michael Watkins]] (directors); [[Vince Gilligan]], John Shiban &amp; [[Frank Spotnitz]] (writers) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 6 | number = 4 &amp; 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, Mulder graduated with first class honours from [[University of Oxford]] with a Bachelor of Science degree in [[psychology]]. He then graduated with honors from the [[FBI Academy|Quantico FBI Training Academy]] in 1984.&lt;ref name="Kill_Switch"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Kill Switch (The X-Files) | title=Kill Switch | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files | credits = [[William Gibson]], [[Tom Maddox]] (writers) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 5 | number = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulder joined the FBI on October 24, 1984.&lt;ref name="Unusual_Suspects"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Unusual Suspects (The X-Files) | title=Unusual Suspects | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Kim Manners]] (director); [[Vince Gilligan]] (writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 5 | number = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On graduating from the Academy, Mulder began his work in the [[Behavioral Science Unit]] ([[Offender profiling|psychological profiling]]) under Agent Bill Patterson, with whom he had a testy relationship.&lt;ref name="Grotesque"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink= Grotesque (The X-Files)| title=Grotesque | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Kim Manners]] (director); [[Howard Gordon]] (writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 3 | number = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the FBI assigned Mulder to the [[National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime|Violent Crimes Unit]].&lt;ref name="Kill_Switch"/&gt; Around this time, Mulder first came across the [[X-File]]s, an obscure FBI section dealing with cases relating to the paranormal; he pored over these cases in his spare time, becoming obsessed with them.&lt;ref name="Pilot"/&gt; In 1991, Mulder re-opened the X-Files with [[Special agent]] [[Diana Fowley]], but Fowley left shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="The_End"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=The End (The X-Files) | title=The End | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[R. W. Goodwin]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 5 | number = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulder investigated the X-Files by himself until March 1992, when [[Dana Scully]], an instructor at the FBI Academy's Forensic Science Research and Training Center, was partnered with him for the purpose of applying [[scientific reasoning]] to Mulder's work and theories.&lt;ref name="Pilot"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=The X-Files (pilot episode) | title=Pilot | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Robert Mandel]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 1 | number = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mulder's ultimate goal was to uncover what he believed to be a [[conspiracy (political)|government conspiracy]] to hide the truth about alien life, and to find out what had happened to his sister.&lt;ref name="Pilot"/&gt; His quest and belief in the existence of aliens was, for most of the series, the driving force of the plot, or [[Story arc|mytharc]]. However, during a period of time after Scully's cancer went into remission (season 5), Mulder was convinced by [[List of minor The X-Files characters#Michael Kritschgau|Michael Kritschgau]] that aliens did not in fact exist, and that the government conspirators had merely concocted that threat as a smokescreen, to justify military activities and toy with him.&lt;ref name="Gethsemane"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink= Gethsemane (The X-Files) | title= Gethsemane | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[R.

During the [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh season]], Mulder eventually discovers the truth about his sister. Samantha was abducted (either by the alien colonists or the government conspirators), and various tests were performed on her. She was then returned to [[The Smoking Man]] to live out her life under his supervision, all the while undergoing additional tests. She was unable to bear the testing any longer so she ran away from her home and was eventually admitted to a nearby hospital, where she disappeared from her locked room. It is revealed that Samantha was taken by "spiritual intervention", with the help of beings called "[[Walk-in]]s". Mulder is briefly reunited with Samantha's spirit.&lt;ref name="Closure"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Closure (The X-Files) | title=Closure | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Kim Manners]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] &amp; [[Frank Spotnitz]] (writers) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 7 | number = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mulder was also abducted by the aliens himself in 2000, and returned to Earth, almost dead, a few months later.&lt;ref name="Requiem"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Requiem (The X-Files) | title=Requiem | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Kim Manners]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 7 | number = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been infected by an [[Black oil (The X-Files)|alien virus]] (for the second time), but Scully found a way to rescue him.&lt;ref name="Deadalive"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Deadalive | title=Deadalive | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Tony Wharmby]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] &amp; [[Frank Spotnitz]] (writers) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 8  | number = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Mulder returned home to his apartment, an application was submitted to the FBI for his reinstatement to the X-Files but this was declined by [[Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|Deputy Director]] [[Alvin Kersh]], who had been promoted in charge of the X-Files shortly after Mulder had been abducted. He returned to work for a brief period of time,&lt;ref name="Three_Words"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Three Words (The X-Files) | title=Three Words | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Tony Wharmby]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] &amp; [[Frank Spotnitz]] (writers) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 8  | number = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was eventually fired for failure to follow orders not to investigate any X-Files.&lt;ref name="Vienen"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Vienen | title=Vienen | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =Rod Hardy (director); [[Steven Maeda]] (writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 8  | number = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Scully gave birth to [[List of minor The X-Files characters#Baby William|William]], Mulder went into hiding in [[New Mexico]] after Kersh said his life was in danger.&lt;ref name="Existence"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Existence (The X-Files) | title=Existence | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Kim Manners]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 8 | number = 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After about a year in hiding, Mulder obtains crucial information from [[Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center|a secret facility]] about the date of the planned alien colonization effort, but is caught and put on trial for the murder of [[List of The X-Files characters#Knowle Rohrer|Knowle Rohrer]]. Despite a defense organized by [[Walter Skinner]] with numerous witnesses, the judges sentence Mulder to [[death penalty|death]]. With help from several people, including a reformed Kersh and the ghost of [[Alex Krycek]], Mulder breaks out of prison and escapes with Scully. As of the [[The Truth (The X-Files)|series finale]], Mulder and Scully were on the run.&lt;ref name="The_Truth"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=The Truth (The X-Files) | title=The Truth | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Kim Manners]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 9  | number = 19 &amp; 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six years after the events of the ninth season, Fox Mulder's fugitive status is clear. Scully mentions that he is wanted by the FBI and dialogue also shows that the FBI does not really want to find him and is simply happy to have him "out of their hair". He is called to assist with the investigation of a missing FBI agent. In exchange for his help, all charges against him are dropped.&lt;ref name="I_Want_to_Believe"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=The X-Files: I Want to Believe | title=I Want to Believe | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] &amp; [[Frank Spotnitz]] (writers) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season =  | number = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven years later, Mulder returns to the FBI when the X-Files is re-opened, in order to look into a government conspiracy, when it transpires they have been using alien technology. Along with Scully, they investigate several cases together like they had done originally. Six weeks after their return to the X-Files, Mulder confronts an alive Smoking Man to try and prevent him carrying out a plan to depopulate the United States using a virus applied to smallpox vaccines. In a vision of Scully's, Mulder falls sick to the disease, but refuses the Smoking Man's help and his proposal to join his elite. Mulder is saved by Agent Miller and they regroup with Scully, however, she says Mulder needs a blood transfusion and only their son can give it to them. At that moment, an unidentified flying object hovers over the trio, which is where [[The X-Files (season 10)|season ten]] ends. The beginning of [[The X-Files (season 11)|season eleven]] reveals this vision came from Scully's son, William. Over the course of season eleven, Scully and Mulder search for William. Skinner learns from the Smoking Man, that the Smoking Man, who is Mulder's father, also artificially impregnated Scully, and thus is William's father as well. In the third episode of the eleventh season, "[[Plus One (The X-Files)|Plus One]]", Scully and Mulder are intimate again. In the season 11 finale, "[[My Struggle IV]]", she reveals to Mulder that she is pregnant with his child.

Despite his aloofness and cynical sense of humor, Mulder displays unbridled enthusiasm and interest when it comes to the paranormal, especially because of his personal involvement after his [[Samantha Mulder|sister's abduction]].&lt;ref name="Pilot"/&gt; [[Walter Skinner]] and other FBI officials have become concerned by his unprofessional behavior. This only proves true as Mulder makes a habit of letting his personal feelings cloud his judgment; his emotional attachment to UFO cases becomes more severe throughout the series, because of [[Dana Scully]]'s eventual abduction and resultant cancer as well as his sister's abduction.&lt;ref name="Closure"/&gt; Mulder can lose his temper when Scully is involved; on multiple occasions, he has become violent in his grief and unreserved in threatening physical force.&lt;ref name="Emily"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Emily (The X-Files) | title=Emily | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Kim Manners]] (director); [[Vince Gilligan]], John Shiban &amp; [[Frank Spotnitz]] (writers) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 5  | number = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulder's overprotectiveness of Scully stems not only from his obvious devotion and love for her, but also a long-harbored guilt; Mulder has admitted feeling indirectly responsible for the ordeals and tragedies Scully had gone through because of their investigations.

In the episode "[[Drive (The X-Files)|Drive]]", Mulder facetiously apologizes on behalf of the "international Jewish conspiracy" in response to the abusive and [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] tirades of a suspect, to which Mulder appears to take offense; the suspect also guesses Mulder's ethnicity is Jewish based on [[Mulder|his last name]].&lt;ref name="Drive"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Drive (The X-Files) | title=Drive | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]] (director); [[Vince Gilligan]] (writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 6  | number = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, in the episode "Kaddish", Mulder is unable to identify a [[Talmud]]ic book, states that he does not know [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and quips that Jesus returned from the dead.&lt;ref name="Kaddish"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Kaddish (The X-Files) | title=Kaddish | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Kim Manners]] (director); [[Howard Gordon]] (writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 4  | number = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Mulder, as his father before him,&lt;ref name="The_Blessing_Way"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=The Blessing Way (The X-Files) | title=The Blessing Way | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[R.W.

[[David Duchovny]] suggested Mulder is [[Jew]]ish when interviewed during production of the second season.&lt;ref&gt;''"The Truth Is Out There: The Official Guide to the X-Files Vol. 1"'', by Brian Lowry, Chris Carter. Harper Paperbacks, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode "The Field Where I Died", Mulder went into a hypnotic trance and recalls a past life, where he is in a concentration camp during the Holocaust, and another where he was a Confederate soldier killed in the [[Battle of Chattanooga (disambiguation)|Battle of Chattanooga]].

Mulder is almost never seen sleeping in a bed. The bedroom in his apartment (which appeared as late as the [[The X-Files (season 6)|sixth season]] of the show's run) is apparently used for storage and is filled floor to ceiling with junk, including a couple of boxes of [[Porn|pornographic magazines]].&lt;ref name="Dreamland"/&gt; Instead, Mulder sleeps on his couch, often falling asleep to a blaring television. Mulder can seem to go through manic periods when worried or working on a case, contributing to or exacerbating his [[insomnia|insomniac tendencies]].&lt;ref name="Tooms"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Tooms | title=Tooms | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[David Nutter]] (director); [[Glen Morgan]] &amp; [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]] (writers) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 1 | number = 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since "[[Dreamland (The X-Files)|Dreamland II]]" where a "man in black" body-swaps with Mulder and takes over his life, Mulder gets his bedroom renovated and equipped with a waterbed.&lt;ref name="Dreamland"/&gt; In "[[Monday (The X-Files)|Monday]]" he finds himself soaked through when his waterbed (which he can't remember getting because [[Morris Fletcher]] got it in [[Dreamland (The X-Files)|Dreamland]]) is leaking.&lt;ref name="Monday"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Monday (The X-Files) | title=Monday | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Kim Manners]] (director); [[Vince Gilligan]] &amp; John Shiban (writers) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 6 | number = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mulder had a rather strained relationship with his parents [[List of The X-Files characters#Bill Mulder|Bill]] and [[List of The X-Files characters#Teena Mulder|Teena Mulder]], not least thanks to [[X-File|the X-Files]]. Initially, he had no idea his father was involved in the conspiracy and [[Samantha Mulder|Samantha]]'s disappearance. Bill, who became disenchanted with the [[Shadow government (conspiracy)|shadow government]] and his own role in the conspiracy, eventually approached Fox about his past deeds, but was shot and killed by [[Alex Krycek]] – working as an assassin for the [[Syndicate (The X-Files)|Syndicate]] – before he could reveal any great amount of information.&lt;ref name="Anasazi"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Anasazi (The X-Files) | title=Anasazi | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[R.W. Goodwin]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 2 | number = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few years, Mulder got into several conflicts with his mother while trying to discover the extent of her own knowledge of his father's precise involvement. Teena dies of an apparent suicide, when the stress of Samantha's abduction finally becomes too painful.&lt;ref name="Sein_Und_Zeit"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Sein Und Zeit (The X-Files) | title=Sein Und Zeit | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[R.W. Goodwin]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] &amp; [[Frank Spotnitz]] (writers) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 7 | number = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last years of his work on the X-Files, Mulder was even forced to doubt that Bill was his true father. He is led to consider the possibility that his mother had had an affair with the [[Smoking Man]], a connection which may have resulted in the birth of either [[Samantha Mulder|Samantha]] or Mulder himself.&lt;ref name="Talitha_Cumi"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Talitha Cumi (The X-Files) | title=Talitha Cumi | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[R.W.

In the [[The X-Files (season 9)|ninth season]], "[[William (The X-Files)|William]]" explains that Spender and Mulder have very similar [[DNA]], providing strong evidence that they do have the same father.&lt;ref name="William"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=William (The X-Files) | title=William | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[David Duchovny]] (director); [[David Duchovny]], [[Frank Spotnitz]] &amp; [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (writers) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 9 | number = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Two_Fathers"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Two Fathers | title=Two Fathers | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Kim Manners]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] &amp; [[Frank Spotnitz]] (writers) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 6 | number = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his studies at [[Oxford University|Oxford]], around the year of 1983, he was dating Phoebe Green; future investigator of [[Metropolitan Police Service]] (season 1, episode 11, [[Fire (The X-Files)|''Fire'']]). When he started his work on ''The X-Files'', around 1991, he was close with his current partner; [[Diana Fowley]] (season 5, episode 20, [[The End (The X-Files)|''The End'']]). None of those remained longterm and stable.

Mulder's closest friend was [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special agent|partner]] [[Dana Scully]], who was assigned to "debunk [his] work" by the conspirators and the FBI brass. But against their intentions, her loyalties quickly became affixed to Mulder's quest and Mulder himself, a connection which seemed to pull Mulder's work out of obscurity, as Scully's scientific bent afforded them a certain amount of credibility.&lt;ref name="Pilot"/&gt; Their intense professional and personal relationship continued to strengthen through the years. While the relationship was platonic for the greater part of the series, there are clues that it developed into a romantic one by the [[List of The X-Files episodes|last few seasons]].&lt;ref name="Existence"/&gt; Mulder and Scully almost always called each other by their surnames – Mulder purportedly hated his first name, but Scully had no such aversion.&lt;ref name="Tooms"/&gt; At the fourth episode of season seven the romantic undertones were confirmed when the two shared a kiss.&lt;ref name="Existence"/&gt; In the [[The Truth (The X-Files)|series finale]], the very last scene depicted Mulder and Scully after running away together, in bed together, contemplating what the future held. In the season 11 finale Scully revealed to be pregnant with his unborn child.

Mulder's greatest nemesis was [[The Smoking Man]], who, despite his obvious ill-intent, seemed to hold Mulder in special regard. Though he mocked Mulder to his face for his foolishness and the futility of his quest, in "[[Two Fathers]]", he told his son [[Jeffrey Spender]], "You pale to Fox Mulder."&lt;ref name="Two_Fathers"/&gt; Mulder also developed an intense enmity for [[Alex Krycek]], a double agent who briefly worked with Mulder in the FBI as an infiltrator,&lt;ref name="Sleepless"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Sleepless (The X-Files) | title=Sleepless | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]] (director); [[Howard Gordon]] (writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 2 | number = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who continued to serve as a recurring adversary, acting as an assassin for the Syndicate in the murders of [[List of minor The X-Files characters#Bill Mulder|Bill Mulder]] and [[List of minor The X-Files characters#Melissa_Scully|Melissa Scully]].&lt;ref name="The_Blessing_Way"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anasazi"/&gt;

===Appearance===

Duchovny portrays Mulder as a series regular for the first seven seasons of the show. Duchovny left the show following the [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh-season finale]] "Requiem", wherein he was abducted by aliens. Although he makes a handful of cameos in the first part of season eight—most notably in the episodes "Within", "Without", "The Gift", and "Per Manum"—Mulder is returned by the aliens and the latter part of the season deals with his death, subsequent resurrection, and his departure from the FBI. After the conclusion of the eighth season, Duchovny left the show, and only appeared in four ninth-season episodes: "Trust No 1", "Jump the Shark", "William", and "The Truth". Duchovny's appearances in "Trust No 1" and "Jump the Shark" were via archival footage, and he only made a small cameo in the third. However, his appearance in "The Truth", the program's series finale, was substantial, and Duchovny was once again listed in the credits as starring.

== Conceptual history ==
[[File:David Duchovny Golden Globe 2009 afterparty.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Duchovny portrayed Mulder, the [[main character]] in the first seven seasons and the tenth season, as well as a [[recurring character]] in the eighth and ninth seasons.]]
[[David Duchovny]] had worked in Los Angeles three years prior to ''[[The X-Files]]''. At first he wanted to base his acting career around films, but in 1993 his [[Talent manager|manager]] Melanie Green gave him a script of the "[[The X-Files (pilot episode)|pilot episode]]" of ''The X-Files''. Green and Duchovny were both convinced it was a good script, so Duchovny auditioned for the lead.&lt;ref name="Youtube"&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKpscCCG-nA |title=Inside the actor's studio – David Duchovny (part 1) |work=Youtube |date= |accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Duchovny was [[audition]]ing for the part of Fox Mulder, he made a "terrific" audition, but talked rather slowly. [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] thought that he was a "good judge of character", and thought that Duchovny wasn't too "bright". So he talked to Duchovny and asked him if he could "please" imagine himself as an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI agent]] for the "future" weeks. The casting director of the show was very positive about him, while according to Carter, Duchovny turned out to be one of the best-read people he knew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Carter, Chris |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/xfiles/interviews/carter/clip0.shtml |title=Casting Mulder |work=BBC News |date= |accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After getting the role, Duchovny thought the show wouldn't last for long or that it wouldn't make as much impact as it did.&lt;ref name="Youtube"/&gt;

Carter has said that he named Mulder after his mother's maiden name. His first name, Fox, was actually not a tribute to the Fox network which aired ''The X-Files'', as often assumed - Carter said he had a childhood friend named Fox.&lt;ref name="naming"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Truth is Out There: The Official Guide to the X-Files |first=Brian |last=Lowry |publisher=Harper Prism |year=1995 |isbn=0-06-105330-9 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Duchovny got the [[Script (recorded media)|script]] many of his characteristics were "fully formed".&lt;ref name="Youtube"/&gt; Executive producer [[Frank Spotnitz]] called portraying actor Duchovny "amazingly smart". He further stated that Duchovny was behind some of the main characteristic ideas behind Mulder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Spotnitz, Frank |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/xfiles/interviews/spotnitz/page6.shtml |title=Amazingly Smart |work=BBC News |date= |accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh season]] Duchovny was in negotiations with the [[Fox network]], saying he wanted more money (while not saying how much) and an improved work schedule, among other issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Germain, David |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000428&amp;slug=4017840 |title=Scully, Mulder go Hollywood in Duchovny's 'X-Files' tale |work=The Associated Press |date=April 28, 2000 |accessdate=July 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After settling his contract dispute, portraying actor Duchovny quit full-time participation in the show after the [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh season]].&lt;ref name=bbcnews&gt;{{cite news |author=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1337685.stm |title=Duchovny quits X-Files |work=BBC News |date=May 18, 2001 |accessdate=July 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contributed to uncertainties over the likelihood of an [[The X-Files (season 8)|eighth season]].&lt;ref name=salon&gt;{{cite web |author=Spencer, Russ |url=http://archive.salon.com/people/feature/2000/04/28/chriscarter/print.html |title=A close encounter with Chris Carter |work=Salon |date=April 28, 2000 |accessdate=July 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819153630/http://archive.salon.com/people/feature/2000/04/28/chriscarter/print.html |archivedate=August 19, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter and most fans felt the show was at its natural endpoint with Duchovny's departure, but it was decided Mulder would be [[alien abduction|abducted]] at the end of the seventh season, leaving things open for the actor's return in 12 episodes the following year.&lt;ref name=space&gt;{{cite web |author=Elber, Lynn |url=http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/tv/xfiles_duchovny_000518_wg.html |title=Fox Mulder 'Ready to Get Back to Work' |work=Associated Press / Space |date=May 18, 2000 |accessdate=July 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duchovny's character Mulder was replaced by [[John Doggett|John Jay Doggett]] (portrayed by [[Robert Patrick]]). In [[The X-Files (season 9)|season nine]], Duchovny wasn't available for shooting, so he only appeared in three episodes with small [[Cameo appearance|cameo]]s, the first being an archive footage only in "[[Trust No 1]]", a [[Cameo appearance|brief cameo]] in "[[William (The X-Files)|William]]", which he also directed and appeared full-time in the [[series finale]], "[[The Truth (The X-Files)|The Truth]]".&lt;ref name="Characterprofile"&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]], [[Robert Patrick|Patrick, Robert]], [[Frank Spotnitz|Spotnitz, Frank]] and [[Annabeth Gish|Gish, Annabeth]] |date=2002 |title=The Truth Behind Season 9 |medium= DVD |publisher=[[Fox Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the show ended, Carter and [[Frank Spotnitz]] started to talk about a movie sequel. Duchovny stated in an interview that very same year that it always had been a "desire" to come back to the [[media franchise|franchise]], saying it was a "natural" stage of development for the franchise to go to the cinema. When talking about Mulder in ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]]'', Duchovny said that he wanted to play him a "little different". He continued saying that Mulder had "lost every battle" saying he was "beaten down by life [...]. He's the same guy, but he is older Mulder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.thedeadbolt.com/news/104566/davidduchovny_interview.php |title=David Duchovny Wants To Believe |work=The Deadbolt |date=May 22, 2002 |accessdate=July 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mulder had a brief cameo on ''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV Series)|The Lone Gunmen]]'', an ''X-Files'' spin-off featuring [[The Lone Gunmen|the characters of the same name]]. He appeared on the episode "All About Yves". In the ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'' episode "[[Lamentation (Millennium)|Lamentation]]", the main character, Frank Black, visits the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, and Mulder and [[Dana Scully]] are briefly seen descending a stairway.

Animated versions of Mulder appeared on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Eek! the Cat]]'' (both series which have been featured in episodes of The X-Files), in the episodes "[[The Springfield Files]]" and "Eek Space-9", respectively. Both featured the voice acting of Duchovny. Duchovny appeared as Mulder on the sketch show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' with [[Molly Shannon]] as Scully, when he hosted an episode. Joining him was co-star [[Nicholas Lea]], who would appear as [[Alex Krycek]] in a sketch that spoofed ''The X-Files''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otGIynpyN2M&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=7F292F2DB9BA8A05&amp;playnext=1&amp;playnext_from=PL&amp;index=59 |title=David Duchovny on Saturday Night Live |work=Youtube |date= |accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francesc Eiximenis''', [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]] ({{IPA-ca|fɾənˈsɛsk əʃiˈmɛnis|lang}}) was a [[Franciscan]] [[Catalan people|Catalan]] writer who lived in the 14th-century [[Crown of Aragon]]. He was possibly one of the more successful medieval Catalan writers, since his works were widely read, copied, published and translated. Therefore, it can be said that both in the literary and in the political sphere he had a lot of influence. Among his readers were numbered important people of his time, such as the kings of the Crown of Aragon [[Peter IV of Aragon|Peter IV]], [[John I of Aragon|John I]] and [[Martin of Aragon|Martin I]], the queen [[Maria de Luna]] (wife of Martin I), and the [[Pope]] of [[Avignon]] [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]].

==Life==
Francesc Eiximenis was born around 1330, possibly in [[Girona]]. When he was very young, he became a [[Franciscan]] and his education began in the Franciscan schools of [[Catalonia]]. Later, he attended the most important universities of Europe: the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Paris]]. The University of Oxford influenced him notably, since the Franciscans had there an important school. Thus, several English Franciscans (and British authors in general) are the thinkers who most influenced Eiximenis, such as [[Robert Grosseteste]] (whom Eiximenis calls ''Linconiensis'', since he was [[bishop of Lincoln]]), [[John of Wales]], [[Richard Kilvington]], [[Alexander of Hales]], [[Richard of Middleton]], [[Thomas Bradwardine]], [[William of Ockham]], [[John Duns Scotus]].

In 1371 there was an attempt to bring him to the [[University of Lleida]] as a teacher. But he lacked the title of Doctor in Theology (''magister in sacra pagina''), and so this attempt did not go further. Eiximenis acquired this title in 1374 at the [[University of Toulouse]], with the financial help and support from the king [[Peter IV of Aragon|Peter IV]].

Eiximenis subsequently returned to Catalonia, where he was considered very intellectual. He was on good terms with the Court of the Crown Of Aragon and with the ruling social class of [[Barcelona]] and [[València]]. Most of his works were written in Valencia, where he stayed from 1382 to 1408. There he was consultant of the ''jurats'' (the city representatives) and of the ''Consell'' (ruling organ of the city).

In Valencia Eiximenis' activity, besides his literary tasks, was tireless. 1391 was a very difficult year for the city and kingdom of Valencia, since there were many social problems. Then Eiximenis organized a kind of "praying army" in some monasteries and convents around Valencia. In 1392 he and other people received the assignment of checking the Jewish books that were stolen during the 1391 [[pogrom]]. At te end of 1397 he was member of a commission that should advise king Martin I about the [[Western Schism]]. In 1397 and 1398 he undertook the organization of two crusades of Valencians and Majorcans against the Muslim pirates of North Africa. In 1399 Eiximenis was also president of a commission that sought to unify all the schools of Valencia. The Consell (ruling organ of Valencia) rejected that in 1400, but this attempt was anyway a clear first step towards the [[University of Valencia]], that was founded officially in 1499. The last years of Eiximenis in Valencia (1404–1408) were devoted to the foundation and endowment of the Franciscan convent of Sant Esperit (in [[Gilet, Valencia|Gilet]], near [[Sagunto]]). This convent was founded by the queen Maria de Luna.

In 1408 Eiximenis took part in the [[Council of Perpignan]]. There the Pope of Avignon Benedict XIII appointed him first [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]] and later apostolic administrator (interim bishop) of the diocese of Elna (ancient name of the diocese of Perpignan).

Eiximenis died in [[Perpignan]] possibly 23 April 1409.

==Works==

===In Catalan===
Eiximenis wrote the following works in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]: 
* ''[[Tractat d'usura]]'' (Treaty about Usury). Short treatise about usury according to the Canon Law. This matter was much debated in the Middle Ages by many scholars.
* ''[[Lo Crestià]]'' (The Christian). According to [[Curt Wittlin]] the name should be ''Lo Cristià''.&lt;ref&gt;Wittlin, Curt. "Era Cristià ''Lo Crestià'' de Francesc Eiximenis? Història d'un error de Paleografia". ''Caplletra'', 48. Spring 2010. 163-77. {{ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a huge project of [[Summa Theologica]] written in popular language. The original project consisted of 13 books, but only four were written:
** ''Primer del Crestià'' (First of the Christian). It deals with the fundamentals of Christianity.
** ''Segon del Crestià'' (Second of the Christian). It deals with the temptation.
** ''Terç del Crestià'' (Third of the Christian). It deals with the different kinds of sins and its remedies.
** ''Dotzè del Crestià'' (Twelfth of the Christian). It deals with government and politics in general. Nevertheless, the content is encyclopedical.
* ''[[Regiment de la cosa pública]]'' (Government of the Republic). It was a gift from Eiximenis to the ''jurats'' (representatives of the city) of Valencia, when he went to Valencia in 1383. It gives advice for good government. This work shows the influence of [[John of Wales]]' ''Communiloquium'', according to [[Albert Hauf]].&lt;ref&gt;Hauf, Albert. “Eiximenis, Joan de Salisbury i Fr. Joan de Gal.les, OFM”. ''Miscel·lània Sanchis Guarner'', I. Quaderns de Filologia. Universitat de València. 1984. 167-174. {{ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was also included as the third part of the ''Dotzè del Crestià''.
* ''[[Llibre dels àngels]]'' (Book of Angels). It is a very complete treatise about [[angelology]] but with several political thoughts. This book was dedicated to the Valencian knight Pere d'Artés.
* ''[[Llibre de les dones]]'' (Book of Women). It begins as just a book about women's education; but four-fifths of this work deal about theology and the fundamentals of Catholic morality. The book was dedicated to the countess of [[Prades, Baix Camp|Prades]], Sanxa Ximenes d'Arenós.
* ''[[Vida de Jesucrist]]'' (Life of Jesus Christ). It is a biography of Jesus Christ with theological thoughts and also contemplative content. This work was very influenced by [[Pseudo-Bonaventure]]'s ''[[Meditations on the Life of Christ]]'' and also by the vehement Franciscan [[Ubertino da Casale]] according to [[Albert Hauf]].&lt;ref&gt;Hauf, Albert. «La huella de Ubertino de Casale en el preerasmismo hispánico: el caso de fray Francesc Eiximenis», ''Actes del X Congrés Internacional de l’Associació Hispànica de Literatura Medieval'' [Associació Hispànica de Literatura Medieval / IIFV, Universitat d’Alacant, 16/20 September 2003]. Alacant. IIFV. 2005. 93-135. {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book was also dedicated to the Valencian knight Pere d'Artés.
* ''[[Scala Dei (Eiximenis)|Scala Dei]]'' or ''Tractat de contemplació'' (Stairs towards God or Treatise about Contemplation). It is a short treatise about moral and theology. This book was dedicated to the queen [[Maria de Luna]].
* Two autograph [[Letter (message)|letters]] in Catalan (from 15 July 1392 and 12 March 1396). The first (15 July 1392) was addressed to King Martin I (who at the time was only prince), and is of interest since Eiximenis gives him advice in the letter about the good government of [[Sicily]].

===In Latin===
Eiximenis wrote the following works in [[Latin language|Latin]]: 
* ''[[De Triplici Statu Mundi]]'' (About the three states of the world). It is a short eschatological treatise. There are doubts however, that Eiximenis is the author of this work.
* ''[[Allegationes]]'' (Statements). In Valencia there was a conflict between the Church and the State, and several important people were asked to express their opinion about that. This is the part that concerns Eiximenis. Here Eiximenis has a very strong theocratic point of view.
* A short part of his ''[[Summa Theologica (Eiximenis)|Summa Theologica]]''. This extract is very short, and deals with some theological matters.
* ''[[Ars Praedicandi Populo]]'' (Manual for the preaching to the people). It is a very interesting manual about preaching.
* A [[homily|sermon]] (or a part of it).
* ''[[Pastorale (Eiximenis)|Pastorale]]'' (Pastoral). It deals with advice for priests and bishops, and it follows the classical [[Saint Gregory]]'s ''Pastorale''. This book was dedicated to [[Hug de Llupià]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Valencia in Spain|bishop of Valencia]].
* ''[[Psalterium alias Laudatorium|Psalterium alias Laudatorium Papae Benedicto XIII dedicatum]]'' (Psalter or Doxology Dedicated to Pope Benedict XIII). It is a very beautiful collection of 344 prayers. As the title shows, this book was dedicated to the Avignon pope Benedict XIII.

Two other books have been attributed to Eiximenis: the ''[[Cercapou]]'', and the ''[[Doctrina compendiosa]]''. The ''Doctrina Compendiosa'' shows however a very strong influence from Eiximenis' political theories. there was also an adaptation of ''Llibre de las Dones'' in Spanish, which was called ''Carro de las Donas''.&lt;ref&gt;There is [http://weblioteca.uv.es/cgi/view7.pl?sesion=2018052612062117888&amp;source=uv_im_b13720740&amp;div=1 this digital edition] (Valladolid, Juan de Villaquigrán, 1542). {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eiximenis' works had much success in his time, as evidenced by more than 200 [[manuscript]]s of his works that have survived. Another example was the ''Psaltiri devotíssim'' &lt;ref&gt;There is [http://mdc.cbuc.cat/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/incunableBC&amp;CISOPTR=18587&amp;REC=10 this digital edition] (Girona, Diego de Gumiel, 1495) {{ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Translation into Catalan of 100 out of the 344 prayers of the ''Psalterium alias Laudatorium''). The [[incunabulum]] edition of this book had 2000 copies, i.e. more than double both editions of the [[Tirant lo Blanc]] (Valencia 1490 and Barcelona 1497). It was the biggest incunabulum edition of the whole medieval [[Catalan literature]].

There were also a lot of translations during the 15th and 16th centuries. The ''Llibre de les Dones'' was translated into Spanish. One of the Spanish translations was used for the education of the four daughters of the [[Catholic Monarchs]]. The ''Llibre dels Àngels'' had great international success and was translated into several languages: [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[French language|French]] and even [[Flemish language|Flemish]] (it was possibly the only book from the medieval Catalan literature that was translated into that language). And the ''Vida de Jesucrist'' was translated into Spanish and French.

There are finally two other examples that show the international spreading of Eiximenis' works. First of all, the French translation of the ''Llibre dels Àngels'' was the first book that in 1478 was printed in [[Geneva]]. Secondly, the Spanish translation of the ''Vida de Jesucrist'' was the first book that was printed in [[Granada]] in 1496 after the conquest of the city by the Catholic Monarchs.

Unfortunately we have few modern editions of Eiximenis' works. Most of the modern editions of his works have been prepared by [[Curt Wittlin]] and by [[Albert Hauf]].

[[File:Terc Crestia.jpg|thumb|Beginning of the ''Terç del Crestià'' in the manuscript 1792 from the National Library of Madrid. This manuscript has the chapters 1-523 from this book (which has 1060 chapters in total).]]

'''MV  ''Freewinds''''' is a [[cruise ship]] operated by [[International Shipping Partners]] and owned by San Donato Properties, which is a company affiliated with the [[Church of Scientology]]. It was built in 1968 by [[Wärtsilä]] [[Crichton-Vulcan|Turku Shipyard]] in [[Turku]], [[Finland]] for [[Wallenius Lines]] as '''MS ''Bohème''''' for service with [[Commodore Cruise Line]]. It was the first cruise ship built in Finland. Its ownership passed to a Church of Scientology-controlled company in 1985.&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt;

==Concept and construction==
The ship that eventually became known as the ''Freewinds'' was originally ordered by the Sweden-based [[Lion Ferry]] as the second in a pair of two [[ropax|car/passenger]] [[ferry|ferries]] for use on their new [[Bremerhaven]] (West Germany)–[[Harwich]] (United Kingdom) service, with provisions made for cruise service during the [[northern hemisphere]] winter season. The ships shared the same design as {{MS|Finnhansa|1966|2}} and {{MS|Finnpartner|1966|2}}, that were under construction for [[Finnlines]] at [[Wärtsilä]] [[Hietalahti shipyard|Helsinki Shipyard]] at the time.&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/finnhansa_1966.htm |title=M/S ''Finnhansa'' (1966) |accessdate=2008-04-12 |last=Asklander |first=Micke |work=Fakta om Fartyg |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/finnpartner_1966.htm |title=M/S ''Finnpartner'' (1966) |accessdate=2008-04-12 |last=Asklander |first=Micke |work=Fakta om Fartyg |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ships ordered by Lion Ferry were built at Wärtsilä's [[Crichton-Vulcan|Turku Shipyard]], and the first of them, {{MS|Prins Hamlet||2}}, was delivered to her owners on 14 May 1966.&lt;ref name=FoFHamlet&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/prins_hamlet_1966.htm |title=M/S ''Prins Hamlet'' (1966) |accessdate=2008-04-12 |last=Asklander |first=Micke |work=Fakta om Fartyg |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the passenger demand on the Bremerhaven–Harwich route proved to be insufficient for two ships, and Lion Ferry cancelled the order for a second ship, which was to be named "Prins Albert".&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt;

Meanwhile, the newly founded [[Commodore Cruise Line]] was looking for ships to operate on cruises around the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref name=Simplon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simplonpc.co.uk/CommodoreCruiseLine.html |title=Commodore Cruise Line |accessdate=2008-04-12 |last=Boyle |first=Ian |work=Simplon Postcards |language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An agreement was reached where the build contract of the half-complete ship was sold to the Sweden-based [[Wallenius Lines]], who would have the ship completed as a [[cruise ship]], and following completion she would be chartered to Commodore Cruise Lines.&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt; Following their tradition of naming ships after operas, Wallenius decided to name the ship ''Bohème'', after [[La bohème]].&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Simplon /&gt; Cabins were added in place of the car decks on the ship (although bow or stern doors were never fitted on her), and her superstructure was redesigned to better accommodate the need for sundeck space in the warmer climates.&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt; The ''Bohème'' was delivered to [[Wallenius Bremen]], Wallenius Lines' West Germany-based subsidiary, on 12 November 1968. She was registered in West Germany, with Bremerhaven as her home port.&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt;

==Service history==

===1968&amp;ndash;1981: Wallenius Lines ownership===
Following delivery the ''Bohème'' sailed to [[Stockholm]], the location of [[Wallenius Lines]]' headquarters, for a presentation to invited guests. On departing Stockholm for [[Miami]] she carried her first paying passengers on board. Her maiden voyage was cut short however, as she hit an underwater cliff outside [[Dalarö]] in the [[Stockholm Archipelago]]. The cliff breached the ship's hull and fuel tanks. Lifeboats were used to evacuate all passengers from the listing ship, and three days later she was refloated and towed to the [[Finnboda]] shipyard in [[Nacka]] for week-long repairs. After the repairs she again left for Miami, this time without passengers.&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt;&lt;ref name=FoFsv /&gt;

On 7 December 1968 the ''Bohème'' left on her first cruise from Miami to [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]]. During her first year in service the ship had notable problems with her air conditioning due to the shipyard's inexperience with building ships for the warm Caribbean climate. As a result, she returned to Europe in 1980, sailing to the [[Blohm + Voss]] shipyard in [[Hamburg]], West Germany where the air conditioning system was rebuilt, an additional [[screw compressor]] as well as two freshwater generators were installed. Following the rebuild the ''Bohème'' re-entered service with an itinerary of Miami–[[San Felipe de Puerto Plata|Puerto Plata]]–[[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]]–[[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]–[[Cap-Haïtien]]–Miami. She followed the same itinerary around the year, becoming the first ship to offer around-the-year seven-night cruises from Miami. She was also the first cruise ship to call at Puerto Plata and the first to offer regular sailings to Cap Haitien.&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt;

===1981&amp;ndash;1986: Rederi Ab Sally ownership===
In March 1981 Commodore Cruise Line, as well as the ''Bohème'', were sold to the Finland-based [[Rederi Ab Sally]].&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Simplon /&gt; The new owners re-registered the ''Bohème'' to [[Panama]], which resulted in most of the German officers resigning due to worsened working conditions. The resigned officers were replaced with [[Scandinavia]]ns.&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt; The following year the German deck and engine crews were replaced by [[Filipino people|Filipinos]]. Originally the new crew members were meant for {{MS|Navarino||2}}, a former [[ocean liner]] (ex Gripsholm 1957) Sally had purchased for conversion into service with Commodore Cruise Line. However, after the ''Navarino'' was severely damaged due to capsizing of the drydock, the conversion plans were abandoned.&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/gripsholm_1957.htm |title=M/S ''Gripsholm'' (1957) |accessdate=2008-04-12 |last=Asklander |first=Micke |work=Fakta om Fartyg |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegreatoceanliners.com/gripsholm2.html |title=''Gripsholm'' (II)/''Navarino''/''Regent Sea'' |accessdate=2008-04-12 |last=Othfors |first=Daniel |work=The Great Ocean Liners |language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew already hired for the ''Navarino'' was transferred to the ''Bohème''.&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt;

Between November 1982 and August 1983 the ''Bohème'' was chartered to the [[Brazilia]]-based [[Saitecin Cruises]] for cruises around South America. She also made one cruise from Miami under this charter.&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt;&lt;ref name=FoFsv /&gt; Following this charter the ship again returned to West Germany to be rebuilt, this time in [[Bremerhaven]], where two new diesel generators were installed and much of the interior decorations replaced.  While in Bremerhaven she also received a new external livery. On returning to service in 1984 the ''Bohème'' was placed on a new Miami–[[Port-au-Prince]]–[[Port Antonio]]–[[Grand Cayman]]–[[Coromuel]]–Miami itinerary. The schedule proved to be too tight to maintain, especially in poor weather conditions.&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt; With engine problems causing further problems, this itinerary only lasted until November 1984, when the ship was chartered to [[SeaEscape]] for their Miami–[[Freeport, Bahamas|Freeport]] ferry service.&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt;&lt;ref name=FoFsv /&gt;

In February 1985 the ''Bohème'' returned to Commodore Cruise Line service. Her port of departure was changed to [[Saint Petersburg, Florida]] to better cater to the needs of Commodore's main clientele, the retired people living on Florida's west coast. The ship's new seven-day itinerary was Saint Petersburg–[[Key West]]–[[Port Antonio]]–[[Cozumel]]–Saint Petersburg. The new route proved to be short-lived, as the ''Bohème'' was sold to [[San Donato Properties Corporation]] in September 1986 for [[United States dollar|US$]]10 million ({{Inflation|index=US|value=10000000|start_year=1986|r=-3|fmt=eq}}), to be converted for use with the [[Church of Scientology]].&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt;&lt;ref name=FoFsv /&gt;

===1986 onwards: Scientology acquisition and ownership===
In 1984, the Church of Scientology's parent body, the [[Church of Scientology International]] (CSI), decided to obtain a ship on which to deliver high-level Scientology courses. According to a statement by the Church,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
CSI believed that an ocean-going vessel would be the most appropriate facility for ministering New OT VIII because this advanced level of religious service requires a completely safe, aesthetic and distraction-free environment and because [[L. Ron Hubbard]], the religion's founder, had researched and ministered the first [[OT level]]s aboard a ship in the late 1960s. A ship therefore would have particular religious significance to Scientologists.&lt;ref name="fst1023"&gt;[http://www.xenufrance.net/fst-to-irs-1023.pdf Flag Ship Trust ''Application for Recognition of Exemption''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229075733/http://www.xenufrance.net/fst-to-irs-1023.pdf |date=2008-02-29 }}, IRS Form 1023, August 18, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An entity called the [[Flag Ship Trust]] (FST) was formed in December 1985 with the aid of a $5 million donation from the [[International Association of Scientologists]]. In September 1986, the Flag Ship Trust purchased ''Bohème'', renamed her ''Freewinds'' and refitted her to enable its use for Scientology purposes. The vessel was put into service in June 1988.

The ownership and management of the vessel was organized through a complicated web of Scientology-run corporations and entities, most of which are owned by the Flag Ship Trust. It is owned by San Donato Properties, a Panamanian corporation of which FST is the sole shareholder. Another FST-owned Panamanian corporation, [[Transcorp Services]], owns the mortgage on the ''Freewinds''. [[FSS Organization]] was a [[Netherlands Antilles]] corporation responsible for paying certain taxes on the vessel to the Netherlands Antilles authorities. Scientology courses are delivered aboard the vessel by the [[Flag Ship Service Organization]] (FSSO), in effect a floating branch of the Church of Scientology. [[Majestic Cruise Lines]] is a Panamanian corporation which operates the ''Freewinds'', receiving payment from FSSO for the use of the ship. [[MCL Services]] is a corporation in the Netherlands Antilles that provides shore support and liaison services for Majestic Cruise Lines and FSSO from the home port of the ''Freewinds''', [[Curaçao]].

Following the Church of Scientology's [[tax exemption]] agreement with the [[U.S. Internal Revenue Service]] in 1993, these arrangements were simplified. The responsibilities of the Majestic Cruise Lines were to be transferred to FSSO, with Majestic itself being dissolved, and FSS Organization being dissolved as it was no longer required for tax reporting purposes in the Netherlands Antilles.&lt;ref name="fst1023" /&gt; However, the Majestic company remains in existence and is still actively billing visitors to the ''Freewinds''.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Letkeman, [http://www.carolineletkeman.org/refund/docs/inv-1999-03-11-majestic-cruise-lines.html Flag Ship Service Organization invoice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825194747/http://www.carolineletkeman.org/refund/docs/inv-1999-03-11-majestic-cruise-lines.html |date=2006-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Freewinds'' is the fifth ship to be owned by the Church of Scientology. The other four have been the  {{HMS|Royal Scotsman||2}} (later the ''Apollo''), the ''[[Enchanter (ship)|Enchanter]]'' (later the ''Diana''), the ''[[Avon River (ship)|Avon River]]'' (later the ''Athena''), and the ''[[Nekambi]]'', all of which have been scrapped, apparently.&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell Miller|Miller, R.]] (1987): [[Bare-faced Messiah]], Michael Joseph books, London. 380 pages [http://www.apologeticsindex.org/Bare%20Faced%20Messiah.pdf Full text]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the nameplate of the ''Diana'' has been preserved and is on display aboard the ''Freewinds''. The church also operated two [[World War II]] surplus ships during the late 1960s through the early 1970s. These were the ''Bolivar'', a subchaser, and the T.S.M.Y. ''Excalibur''. Both of these vessels were docked at [[San Pedro, California]], and they were used for training new Sea Org members.

==Scientology use==
The ''Freewinds'' is the exclusive training center for [[OT VIII]] ([[Operating Thetan]] Level 8), the [[Scientology beliefs and practices|highest level of Scientology]] and the last of the published OT levels. Members of the Church of Scientology who have reached the highest levels must receive their training on the ''Freewinds'', as the Church does not deliver this service anywhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{http://www.freewinds.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the OT VIII training, the ''Freewinds'' is used for delivering lower-level classes, auditing services, and recreational activities for Scientologists. The ship hosts a "Freewinds Maiden Voyage" each June as an "OT Summit" for high-ranking Scientologists at which Scientology accomplishments and plans for the future are publicly celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;"THE FREEWINDS MAIDEN VOYAGE XVII - THE LANDMARK CRUISE FROM WHICH NOTHING WILL EVER BE THE SAME AGAIN", ''Impact'' magazine no. 111, Oct 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant portion of the ship is given over to its use as a religious retreat for [[Scientology|Scientologists]]. As well as various course rooms and a library of L. Ron Hubbard books, the ''Freewinds'' has areas given over to the [[Religious Technology Center]], [[Sea Org]] and [[International Association of Scientologists]]. As is common practice in other Scientology organizations, the ship also has an "LRH Office" symbolically set aside for L. Ron Hubbard's use (Hubbard died in January 1986, approximately nine months before the vessel was purchased).

Valeska Paris, a former Scientology staff member on the ship, has alleged that she was held on the ship against her will and forced into manual labor for 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/11/valeska_paris_scientology_freewinds.php |title=Village Voice - Scientology Held Woman Aboard the Freewinds for 12 Years Against Her Will: Aussie TV |accessdate=2011-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201214921/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/11/valeska_paris_scientology_freewinds.php |archivedate=2011-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other uses ===
The ''Freewinds'' often hosts local functions in the ports it frequents, such as [[jazz]] concerts and movie performances in Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao. These events are usually free but often support island charities through entrance fees or suggested donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonaireinsider.com/index.php/bonaireinsider/comments/freewinds_plans_benefit_concert_to_support_bonaire_animal_shelter/|title=The Bonaire Insider - InfoBonaire|website=www.bonaireinsider.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Local artists are often showcased.  It also caters to different international conferences and events. The ship's leisure facilities include a restaurant, lounge, cabaret, swimming pool, movie theater and beauty salon.

==Environmental issues==
In April 2008, the ''Freewinds'' was shut down after [[Carcinogen|cancer-causing]] [[Riebeckite#Crocidolite (fibrous riebeckite)|blue asbestos]] was discovered by government health inspectors&lt;ref name=lloyd&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nelson|first1=Rainbow|archivedate=9 June 2008|title=Asbestos scare seals off Scientology cruiseship|url=http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/news/asbestos-scare-seals-off-scientology-cruiseship/1210066179954.htm|work=Lloyd's List|publisher=Informa plc|date=7 May 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609193955/http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/news/asbestos-scare-seals-off-scientology-cruiseship/1210066179954.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; during maintenance by the Curaçao Drydock Company.&lt;ref name="dailyherald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gray"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2008/04/scientology-freewinds-asbestos-tom-cruise.php|title=Scandal on the Lido Deck: Scientology Cruise Ship Exposing Passengers to Asbestos?|work=Radar Online|publisher=[[Radar (magazine)|Radar Magazine]]|date=2008-04-30|accessdate=2008-04-30|last=Gray|first=Tyler|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501090155/http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2008/04/scientology-freewinds-asbestos-tom-cruise.php|archivedate=2008-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue asbestos is the most dangerous form of asbestos, and the ship is reported to be "extensively contaminated".&lt;ref name="insurancenewsnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insurancenewsnet.com/article.asp?n=1&amp;neID=200805023600.3_33bc000d60868fe7|title=Curacao Dry dock Company: Scientology's Cruise Ship Sealed Due To Asbestos Danger|work=Insurance News Net|publisher=insurancenewsnet.com|accessdate=2008-05-02|last=M2 PressWIRE}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to InsuranceNewsNet, "Decontamination, if it is even possible, is likely to cost tens of millions of dollars and would result in the ship being in dry dock for many months."&lt;ref name="insurancenewsnet" /&gt;

The Church of Scientology denied that there is an asbestos problem, commenting in May 2008 that "there is not now and never has been a situation of asbestos exposure on the Freewinds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff writer|title=Cruise and Holmes in asbestos warning|work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]|date=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karin Pouw]], spokesperson for the Church of Scientology, told ''[[Radar Magazine]]'' that the air quality on the ship was regularly tested and "always meets or exceeds US standards".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2008/05/freewinds-asbestos-scientology-tom-cruise.php Cancer on the Lido Deck?

To remove material from the ship, Nordica brought in 240 Polish workers, who lived on the ''Freewinds'' for a month and a half. When workers told Nordica there was blue asbestos on the ship, they stopped renovations and workers returned to Poland. Witold Maliński stated that Nordica was looking to demand compensation on behalf of its workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/kat,1342,title,Polscy-stoczniowcy-pozwa-Kosciol-Scjentologow,wid,10444891,wiadomosc.html |title=Polscy stoczniowcy pozwą Kościół Scjentologów? |accessdate=2008-10-13 |last=Rusak |first=Paweł |date=2008-10-09 |publisher=[[Wirtualna Polska]] |language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Freewinds logo.jpg|thumb|Logo on the side of the ''Freewinds'', incorporating the [[Operating Thetan|OT]], [[Dianetics]], Scientology and Majestic Cruise Lines logos (centre, left, right and above, respectively).]]

===Exterior design===
The exterior design of the ''Bohème/Freewinds'' is very similar to the ''Finnhansa'' class ships built as ferries. She has a moderately raked and slightly rounded bow, rounded forward superstructure, terraced rear superstructure and two slim side-by-side funnels. She differs from her sisters with the superstructure expanding further on promenade deck (on the other ships it only extends as far as the [[bridge (ship)|bridge]]), swimming pool added to the rear of promenade deck, and the observation lounge missing from the topmost deck; this was replaced by an open sunbathing area.

As built the ''Bohème'' was painted in [[Wallenius Lines]] livery, with an all-white hull and superstructure, yellow radar mast and yellow funnels with a wide horizontal green stripe painted on them and the letters OW (for [[Olof Wallenius]]) painted on the stripe. The ship only kept this livery until her first visit to [[Miami]], where she was repainted in the [[Commodore Cruise Line]] livery, with white funnels and radar mast. A dark blue decorative stripe was later painted on the hull. During the 1983 refit the livery of the ''Bohème'' was more radically altered, when blue stripes were painted along the windows on main and promenade decks, as well as the bridge windows. The funnels were re-painted with a spray-shaped design in blue, red and yellow.&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Simplon /&gt;

Following acquisition by the [[Church of Scientology]] the ship's external appearance was changed slightly from the final Commodore livery; the ''Freewinds'' received dark blue funnels with the [[Majestic Cruise Lines]] logo on them, while an intricate combination of Scientology-related symbols was painted on both sides of the hull (pictured on the right). Additionally three decorative ribands were painted on the side of the hull towards the rear.

===Interior design===
Members of the Wallenius family were heavily involved in the interior design of the ''Bohème''. [[Margareta Wallenius]] in particular dedicated her interest to the interiors of the ship, having her say in the materials used and works of art brought in from promising artists in Paris. Reflecting the company tradition of naming ships after operas, all public rooms on board were originally named  after themes related to [[Puccini]]'s ''[[La bohème]]'', the opera that had given its name to the ship itself.&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt;

Compared to her sisters built for [[ferry]] service, cabins were built on the planned car-deck on the B- and C-decks on the ''Bohème''.&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt; The car decks had in fact been originally planned to accommodate temporary cabin modules during the winter when [[Lion Ferry]], the company that had originally ordered the ''Bohème'', planned to use her for cruising to the [[Canary Isles]].&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt;&lt;ref name=FoFHamlet /&gt; Additionally a small gymnasium and cinema were added in place of cargo hold on D-deck. All stairways and public rooms were panelled in light [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] woods, while the deluxe cabins received dark oak panelings.  During the 1983 refit much of the original panelling was replaced either by colourful paintings or mirrors to give an increased sense of space. Similarly much of the upholstery and carpets were changed into cheerier colours.&lt;ref name=FoFen /&gt;

'''Gavaevodata''' (''{{transl|ae|gav-aēvō.dātā}}'') is the [[Avestan language]] name of the primordial bovine of [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] cosmogony and cosmology, one&lt;!-- see footnotes --&gt; of [[Ahura Mazda]]'s six&lt;!-- see footnotes --&gt; primordial material creations and  the mythological progenitor of all beneficent animal life.

The primordial beast is killed in the creation myth, but from its marrow, organs and ''cithra''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name="cithra"&gt;The precise meaning of this word in this context is unknown. It is traditionally translated as "seed", which in the sense of "prototype" carries the connotation of a particular physical form or appearance. But the word can also mean "seed" in the sense of a "race, stock", which Gavaevodata &amp;ndash; as the primordial animal &amp;ndash; is the apical ancestor of.&lt;/ref&gt; the world is repopulated with animal life. The soul of the primordial bovine &amp;ndash; ''geush urvan'' &amp;ndash; returned to the world as the soul of livestock. Although ''geush urvan'' is an aspect of the primordial bovine in Zoroastrian tradition, and may also be that in the Younger Avesta, the relationship between the two is unclear in the oldest texts.

==In scripture==
Although Avestan ''gav-'' "cow" is grammatically feminine, the word is also used as a singular for the collective "cattle". In English language translations Gavaevodata is often referred to in gender-neutral terms as "primordial ox". Other translations refer to Gavaevodata as a [[bull]] (''cf.'' {{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=139}}). The ''-aevo.data'' of the name literally means "created as one" or "solely created" or "uniquely created".

Gavaevodata is only alluded to in the surviving texts of the [[Avesta]], referred to by name in only two hymns. In other instances, for example in ''Yasht''&amp;nbsp;13.85, the primordial beast is mentioned among the six&lt;!-- see  footnote --&gt; material creations, but not by name. Elsewhere, such as in the Gathic Avestan ''[[Yasna Haptanghaiti]]'', prayers are offered on behalf of the soul of the cow (''geush urvan'', ''Y.''&amp;nbsp;35), or worship is offered to "the cow's soul, and to her created body" (''Y''.&amp;nbsp;39), but in neither case is Gavaevodata mentioned by name, nor is it clear (unlike in Zoroastrian tradition) whether the soul of the cow is the soul of Gavaevodata.

This is also the case for ''The Cow's Lament'' in ''Yasna''&amp;nbsp;29, which – as a ''Gatha'' – is attributed to Zoroaster himself, and is thus the subject of a great deal of interpretation. In this allegorical text, the soul of the cow (''geush urvan'') despairs over the wretched condition to which the forces of deceit (''[[druj]]'') have subjected her (see myth, [[#In tradition|below]]), and over her lack of protection from an adequate herdsman. The divinities hold council, and decide that Zoroaster is the only one who can alleviate her condition. At first she laments even more, holding Zoroaster to be incompetent, but finally accepts his assistance.

At least two levels of meaning have been inferred from this text ({{harvnb|Malandra|2001|p=577}}): The maltreated creature symbolizes the plight of Zoroaster's community, and the soul of the primordial beast is a metaphor for the message that Zoroaster has received from Mazda. In verse&amp;nbsp;3 of the litany to the moon (''Mah Niyayesh''&amp;nbsp;3), Gavaevodata is invoked as (or together with) the "bovine of many species" in the care of the moon [[Mah]], specifically ''måŋha- gaociθra-'' "the moon that keeps in it the ''cithra''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name="cithra" /&gt; of cattle," which is a stock epithet of ''Mah'' (''Yasht''&amp;nbsp;7.3, 7.5, 7.6, ''GBd''&amp;nbsp;VIe.2-3, VII.5-6 etc.)

In the 30&amp;nbsp;hymns to the divinities of the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] month, Gavaevodata is again invoked in the verses nominally dedicated to the &lt;!-- caps --&gt;Moon. In both ''Siroza''&amp;nbsp;1.12 and 2.12, Mah is again referred to as "the &lt;!-- caps --&gt;Moon containing the ''cithra'' of cattle," and Gavaevodata is again referred to as (or in the company of) the "Bovine of many species."

==In tradition==
The mythology of the "uniquely created bovine" that is only alluded to in the extant Avesta appears fully developed in the 9th-11th century Middle Persian texts of Zoroastrian tradition. In these texts, Avestan Gavaevodata appears as [[Middle Persian]] ''gaw i ew-dad'' or ''ewazdad'' or ''ewagdad,'' and retains the same literal meaning as the Avestan language form.

As also for all other Zoroastrian cosmological beliefs, the primary source of information on the primordial ox is the ''[[Bundahishn]]'', a 9th-century text.  In this text, the primordial ox is a [[hermaphrodite]], having both milk (''Ibd''&amp;nbsp;43.15) and semen (''Ibd''&amp;nbsp;94.4). It is "white, bright like the moon, and three measured poles in height" (''Gbd''&amp;nbsp;Ia.12). The uniquely created ox lived its life on the river Veh. Daiti (''Gbd''&amp;nbsp;Ia.12), and on the opposite bank lived Gayomart/d (Avestan ''Gayo maretan''), the mythical first human.

Gawi ewdad's role in the creation myth runs as follows: During the first three-thousand year period, [[Ahura Mazda]]'s (''Ormuzd'') fashioned the bovine as His fourth or fifth&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The primordial bovine is either the fifth or the fourth creation, depending on which enumeration is followed. The number of material creations varies as well, and is either six or seven, subject to whether fire is included as the seventh and last of the material creations. The Greater ''Bundahishn'' has Gawi ewdad as the fifth of seven creations.&lt;/ref&gt; of six&lt;!-- see footnote --&gt; primordial material creations. At the beginning of the second three-thousand year period, [[Angra Mainyu]] (''Ahriman'') attacked the world, and the Creator responded by placing the primordial plant, bovine, and human in the respective heavenly spheres of the stars, moon and sun (''IBd''&amp;nbsp;7). But Ahriman assaulted the sky and Ormuzd fed the bovine "medicinal ''mang''" (''mang bēšaz''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Middle Persian ''mang'' refers to either henbane (e.g. ''[[Hyoscyamus niger]]'') or datura (''[[Datura stramonium]]'') or hemp (e.g. ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'').&lt;!-- i.e. not hashish, which is what NP bang refers to--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) to lessen its suffering (''GBd''&amp;nbsp;IV.20). The bull immediately became feeble, and then died.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;{{cite book |author=Henning |title=Zoroaster: Politician or witch doctor? |page=32}} suggests that the author meant a euthanasiac was administered. For contra, see {{harvnb|Boyce|1975|p=231, n. 11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

But as it lay dying its ''chihr''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name="cithra" /&gt; was rescued and carried to "the moon station."&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The "moon station" being referred to is the station of the moon known in Middle Persian as  ''pesh Parwez'' "before (in front of) Parwez," with Parwez being the Middle Persian equivalent of Avestan ''paoiryaeinyas'', the [[Pleiades]].&lt;!-- An allusion in  ''Dadestan-i Denig''&amp;nbsp;37.46 suggests that (the nebulae of) the Pleiades were once mythologically identified as the ''chihr'' of the primordial bovine. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the care of the moon, the ''chihr''&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name="cithra" /&gt; of the beast was purified and became the male and female pairs of the animals "of many species." After the ox's death, fifty-five kinds of grain and twelve kinds of medicinal plants grew from its marrow (''Ibd'' 10). In another passage  (''Ibd'' 93.11, ''cf'' an equivalent passage in  ''Zadspram''), the ''Bundahishn'' speaks of sesame, lentils, leeks, grapes, mustard and marjoram issuing from various other parts of its body. For example, lentils from the liver and mustard from the lungs&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;For the reconstruction of the Avestan word for mustard (identified in Zoroastrian tradition with healthy lungs), and its homophonic similarity to the Middle Persian word for lungs, see {{citation |last=Henning |first=Walter Bruno |title=A grain of mustard |journal=Annali dell' Istituto Orientale di Napoli |series=Sezione Linguistica |volume=6 |year=1965 |pages=29–31}} (''Selected Papers&amp;nbsp;II'', pp.&amp;nbsp;597-599).&lt;/ref&gt; (''Ibd'' 14.1, ''Gbd'' XIII.2&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;In several translations (e.g. the Anklesaria or West ''Bundahishn''s) of Middle Persian texts, Middle Persian ''sipandan'' "mustard" is mis-translated as "(wild) rue."

Goshorun (from Avestan ''[[geush urvan]]''), the soul of the primordial bovine, escaped to the star, moon, and sun stations where she lamented the destruction of the world. She was not placated until Ormuzd shows her the ''[[fravashi]]'' of the yet-unborn [[Zoroaster]] (whose  protection she would receive). Contented with the promise of protection, Goshorun then agreed to be "created back to the world in livestock." (''Gbd''&amp;nbsp;IVa.2ff,  ''Ibd'''&amp;nbsp;46.3ff., ''[[Denkard]]''&amp;nbsp;p.9).

The '''Gyeyul''' ({{Ko-hhrm|hanja=戒律宗|hangul=계율종|rr=Gyeyuljong}}) school is the [[Korea]]n name applied to a branch of [[Buddhism]] that specializes in the study of monastic discipline, or [[Vinaya]]. The Gyeyul school derives directly from the Indian ''Vinaya School''. .&lt;ref&gt;The Buddhist Religion:
a historical introduction. Richard H. Robinson, Willard L. Johnson, Sandra Ann Wawrytko. Wadsworth Pub. Co., 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

When Buddhism first came to [[Baekje]] in 384, it was introduced by a [[Serindia]]n monk named [[Marananta]], Buddhism was quickly embraced but largely unknown.  So, a Korean monk named Gyeomik (겸익, 謙益) was sent to India to bring back more information.  He is said to have traveled to India via the southern seas, studied Sanskrit and then came back to Baekje accompanied by another Indian monk, Paedalta (Vedatta?) and with many texts on the [[Vinaya]] and [[Abhidharma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buswell|first=Robert E.|title=Tracing Back the Radiance: Chinul's Korean Way of Zen|year=1991|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0824814274|pages=5, 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Gyeomik translated these texts into Korean along with help from his disciples Tamuk and Hyerin and thus founded the Vinaya School in Korea.

'''Hans Christian Ørsted''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɜːr|s|t|ɛ|d}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/oersted "Oersted"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-da|hans kʁæsdjan ˈɶɐ̯sdɛð|lang}}; often rendered '''Oersted''' in English; 14 August 1777{{spaced ndash}}9 March 1851) was a Danish [[physics|physicist]] and [[chemistry|chemist]] who discovered that [[electric current]]s create [[magnetic field]]s, which was the first connection found between [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]]. [[Oersted's law]] and the [[oersted]] (Oe) are named after him.

A leader of the [[Danish Golden Age]], Ørsted was a close friend of [[Hans Christian Andersen]] and the brother of politician and jurist [[Anders Sandøe Ørsted]], who served as [[Prime Minister of Denmark]] from 1853 to 1854.

==Early life and studies==
[[File:Hans Christian Ørsted som ung.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The young H. C. Ørsted]]
Ørsted was born in [[Rudkøbing]] in 1777. As a young boy he developed an interest in science while working for his father, who owned a pharmacy.&lt;ref name="compilation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/oersted.htm|title=Hans Christian Ørsted |publisher=Hebrew University of Jerusalem |accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his brother [[Anders Sandøe Ørsted|Anders]] received most of their early education through self-study at home, going to Copenhagen in 1793 to take entrance exams for the [[University of Copenhagen]], where both brothers excelled academically. By 1796 Ørsted had been awarded honors for his papers in both [[aesthetics]] and [[physics]]. He earned his doctorate in 1799 for a dissertation based on the works of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] entitled ''The Architectonics of Natural Metaphysics''.

In 1800, [[Alessandro Volta]] reported his invention of the [[voltaic pile]], which inspired Ørsted to investigate the nature of electricity and to conduct his first electrical experiments. In 1801 Ørsted received a travel [[scholarship]] and public grant which enabled him to spend three years traveling across Europe. He toured science headquarters throughout the continent, including in Berlin and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbi.ku.dk/hhh/hco/oersted/uddannelsen/ Inspiration fra Europa - planer i København] Niels Bohr Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany Ørsted met [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter]], a physicist who believed there was a connection between [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]]. This idea made sense to Ørsted as he subscribed to Kantian thought regarding the unity of nature.&lt;ref name="compilation"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian, R.M. &amp; Cohen, R.S. (2007). Hans Christian Ørsted and the Romantic Legacy in Science, ''Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science'', Vol. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Ørsted's conversations with Ritter drew him into the study of physics. He became a professor at the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1806 and continued research on electric currents and acoustics. Under his guidance the university developed a comprehensive physics and chemistry program and established new laboratories.

Ørsted welcomed [[William Christopher Zeise]] to his family home in autumn 1806. He granted Zeise a position as his lecturing assistant and took the young chemist under his tutelage. In 1812 Ørsted again visited Germany and France after publishing ''Videnskaben om Naturens Almindelige Love'' and ''Første Indledning til den Almindelige Naturlære'' (1811).

Ørsted was the first modern thinker to explicitly describe and name the [[thought experiment]]. He used the Latin-German term ''Gedankenexperiment'' circa 1812 and the German term ''Gedankenversuch'' in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Witt-Hansen, J., "H.C. Ørsted, Immanuel Kant and the Thought Experiment", Danish Yearbook of Philosophy, Vol.13, (1976), pp. 48–65.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Electromagnetism==
[[File:17. Естердов експеримент.ogv|thumb|280px|A compass needle with a wire, showing the effect Ørsted discovered. Demonstrated by Prof. Oliver Zajkov, Physics Institute at the [[Ss. Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje]], Macedonia.]]
On 21 April 1820, during a lecture, Ørsted noticed a [[compass]] needle deflected from magnetic north when an electric current from a battery was switched on and off, confirming a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Christian Ørsted (1997). Karen Jelved, Andrew D. Jackson, and Ole Knudsen, translators from Danish to English. ''Selected Scientific Works of Hans Christian Ørsted'', {{ISBN|0-691-04334-5}}, pp.421-445&lt;/ref&gt;

His initial interpretation was that magnetic effects radiate from all sides of a wire carrying an electric current, as do light and heat. Three months later he began more intensive investigations and soon thereafter published his findings, showing that an electric current produces a circular magnetic field as it flows through a wire.&lt;ref&gt;Martins, Roberto de Andrade, "[http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Volta%20and%20the%20History%20of%20Electricity/V&amp;H%20Sect3/V&amp;H%20245-265.pdf Resistance to the discovery of [[electromagnetism]]: Ørsted and the symmetry of the magnetic field]", in: Fabio Bevilacqua &amp; Enrico Giannetto (eds.), ''Volta and the History of Electricity'', Pavia / Milano, Università degli Studi di Pavia / Editore Ulrico Hoepli, 2003, pp. 245-265. (Collana di Storia della Scienza) {{ISBN|88-203-3284-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his discovery, the [[Royal Society of London]] awarded Ørsted the [[Copley Medal]] in 1820 and the French Academy granted him 3,000 [[French francs|francs]].

Ørsted's findings stirred much research into electrodynamics throughout the scientific community, influencing French physicist [[André-Marie Ampère]]'s developments of a single mathematical formula to represent the magnetic forces between current-carrying conductors. Ørsted's work also represented a major step toward a unified concept of energy.

==Later years==
[[File:Assistens Kirkegård - Hans Christian Ørsted.jpg|thumb|left|Gravestone]]
Ørsted was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1822 and a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1849.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter O|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterO.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He founded Selskabet for Naturlærens Udbredelse (SNU), a society to disseminate knowledge of the natural sciences, in 1824. He was also the founder of predecessor organizations which eventually became the [[Danish Meteorological Institute]] and the [[European Patent Organisation|Danish Patent and Trademark Office]].
In 1829, Ørsted founded [[Den Polytekniske Læreanstalt]] ('College of Advanced Technology') which was later renamed the [[Technical University of Denmark]] (DTU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtu.dk/English/About_DTU/History_of_DTU.aspx|title=History of DTU|publisher=Technical University of Denmark|accessdate=2009-08-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902070101/http://www.dtu.dk/English/About_DTU/History_of_DTU.aspx|archivedate=2009-09-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1825, Ørsted made a significant contribution to [[chemistry]] by producing [[aluminium]] for the first time. While an aluminium-iron alloy had previously been developed by [[Humphry Davy]], Ørsted was the first to isolate the element via a reduction of [[aluminium chloride]].

Ørsted died in Copenhagen in 1851, aged 73, and was buried in the [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Cemetery]].

==Legacy==
The [[CGS|centimetre-gram-second system (CGS)]] [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[Electromagnetic induction|magnetic induction]] ([[oersted]]) is named for his contributions to the field of electromagnetism.

===Toponomy===
The [[Ørstedsparken|Ørsted Park]] in Copenhagen was named after Ørsted in 1879. The streets [[H.C. Ørsteds Vej]] in [[Frederiksberg]] and H. C. Ørsteds Allé in [[Galten, Denmark|Galten]] are also named after him.

The buildings that are home to the [[University of Copenhagen Department of Chemistry|Department of Chemistry]] and the [[University of Copenhagen Institute for Mathematical Sciences|Institute for Mathematical Sciences]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]]'s [[North Campus (University of Copenhagen)|North Campus]] are named the ''[[Hans Christian Ørsted Institute|H.C. Ørsted Institute]]'', after him. A dormitory named H. C. Ørsted Kollegiet is located in [[Odense]].

The [[Ørsted (satellite)|first Danish satellite]], launched 1999, was named after Ørsted.

===Monuments and memorials===
[[File:Statue of Hans Christian Øersted, Øerstedsparken, Copenhagen.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Statue of Ørsted in [[Ørstedsparken]], in Copenhagen.]]
A [[The Physicist Hans Christian Ørsted|statue of Hans Christian Ørsted]] was installed in the Ørsted Park in 1880. A commemorative plaque is located above the gate on the building in [[Studiestræde]] where he lived and worked. The 100 [[Danish krone|danske kroner]] note issued from 1950 to 1970 carried an engraving of Ørsted.

===Awards and lectures===
Two medals are awarded in Ørsted's name: the [[Oersted Medal]] for notable contributions in the teaching of physics in America, awarded by [[American Association of Physics Teachers]], along with the [[H. C. Ørsted Medal]] for Danish scientists, awarded by the Danish ''Selskabet for Naturlærens Udbredelse'' (Society for the Dissemination of Natural Science), founded by Ørsted. 

The H.C. Ørsted Lectureship is awarded to two prominent researchers annually.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Writings==
Ørsted was a published writer and poet. His poetry series ''Luftskibet'' ("The Airship") was inspired by the balloon flights of fellow physicist and stage magician [[Étienne-Gaspard Robert]].&lt;ref name="NationalMuseet"&gt;National Museum of Denmark.

The '''''I Ching''''' ({{zh |t = 易經 |s = 易经 |p = Yìjīng }}; {{small|Mandarin pronunciation:}} {{IPAc-cmn|AUD|YiJing.ogg|yi|4|-|j|ing|1}}),&lt;ref name="random"&gt;{{citation |contribution-url = http://dictionary.com/browse/i-ching |contribution=I Ching |title = [[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]] }}.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''''Classic of Changes''''' or '''''Book of Changes''''', is an ancient Chinese [[divination]] text and the oldest of the [[Chinese classics]]. Possessing a history of more than two and a half millennia of commentary and interpretation, the ''I Ching'' is an [[I Ching's influence|influential text]] read throughout the world, providing inspiration to the worlds of religion, psychoanalysis, literature, and art. Originally a divination manual in the [[Western Zhou]] period (1000{{ndash}}750{{sbc}}), over the course of the [[Warring States period]] and early imperial period (500{{ndash}}200{{sbc}}) it was transformed into a [[Religious cosmology|cosmological]] text with a series of philosophical commentaries known as the "[[Ten Wings]]".{{sfnp|Kern|2010|p=17}} After becoming part of the [[Five Classics]] in the 2nd century BC, the ''I Ching'' was the subject of scholarly commentary and the basis for divination practice for centuries across the Far East, and eventually took on an influential role in Western understanding of Eastern thought.

The ''I Ching'' uses a type of divination called [[cleromancy]], which produces apparently random numbers. Six numbers between 6 and 9 are turned into a [[#Hexagrams|hexagram]], which can then be looked up in the ''I Ching'' book, arranged in an order known as the [[King Wen sequence]]. The interpretation of the readings found in the ''I Ching'' is a matter of centuries of debate, and many commentators have used the book symbolically, often to provide guidance for moral decision making as informed by [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]]. The hexagrams themselves have often acquired cosmological significance and paralleled with many other traditional names for the processes of change such as [[yin and yang]] and [[Wu Xing]].

==The divination text: ''Zhou yi''==
The core of the ''I Ching'' is a [[Western Zhou]] divination text called the ''Changes of Zhou'' (周易 ''Zhōu yì'').{{Sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=2012|1p=22|2a1=Nelson|2y=2011|2p=377|3a1=Hon|3y=2005|3p=2|4a1=Shaughnessy|4y=1983|4p=105|5a1=Raphals|5y=2013|5p=337|6a1=Nylan|6y=2001|6p=220|7a1=Redmond|7a2=Hon|7y=2014|7p=37|8a1=Rutt|8y=1996|8p=26}} Various modern scholars suggest dates ranging between the 10th and 4th centuries BC for the assembly of the text in approximately its current form.{{sfnp|Nylan|2001|p=218}} Based on a comparison of the language of the ''Zhou yi'' with dated [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|bronze inscriptions]], the American sinologist [[Edward L. Shaughnessy|Edward Shaughnessy]] dated its compilation in its current form to the early decades of the reign of [[King Xuan of Zhou]], in the last quarter of the 9th century BC.{{Sfnm|1a1=Shaughnessy|1y=1983|1p=219|2a1=Rutt|2y=1996|2pp=32–33|3a1=Smith|3y=2012|3p=22|4a1=Knechtges|4y=2014|4p=1885}} A copy of the text in the Shanghai Museum corpus of [[bamboo and wooden slips]] (recovered in 1994) shows that the ''Zhou yi'' was used throughout all levels of Chinese society in its current form by 300 BC, but still contained small variations as late as the [[Warring States period]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Shaughnessy|1y=2014|1p=282|2a1=Smith|2y=2012|2p=22}} It is possible that other divination systems existed at this time; the ''[[Rites of Zhou]]'' name two other such systems, the ''Lianshan'' and the ''[[Guizang]]''.{{Sfnm|1a1=Rutt|1y=1996|1p=26-7|2a1=Redmond|2a2=Hon|2y=2014|2pp=106–9|3a1=Shchutskii|3y=1979|3p=98}}

===Name and origins===
The name ''Zhou yi'' literally means the "changes" ({{zh||c=易|p=Yì}}) of the [[Zhou dynasty]].  The "changes" involved have been interpreted as the transformations of hexagrams, of their lines, or of the numbers obtained from the divination.{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=1877}} [[Feng Youlan]] proposed that the word for "changes" originally meant "easy", as in a form of divination easier than the [[oracle bone]]s, but there is little evidence for this. There is also an ancient [[folk etymology]] that sees the character for "changes" as containing the sun and moon, the cycle of the day. Modern Sinologists believe the character to be derived either from an image of the sun emerging from clouds, or from the content of a vessel being changed into another.{{sfnm|1a1=Shaughnessy|1y=1983|1p=106|2a1=Schuessler|2y=2007|2p=566|3a1=Nylan|3y=2001|3pp=229–230}}

The ''Zhou yi'' was traditionally ascribed to the Zhou cultural heroes [[King Wen of Zhou]] and the [[Duke of Zhou]], and was also associated with the legendary world ruler [[Fu Xi]].{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|1999|p=295}}  According to the canonical ''Great Commentary'', Fu Xi observed the patterns of the world and created the [[bagua|eight trigrams]] ({{zh|c=八卦|p=bāguà}}), "in order to become thoroughly conversant with the numinous and bright and to classify the myriad things." The ''Zhou yi'' itself does not contain this legend and indeed says nothing about its own origins.{{sfnp|Redmond|Hon|2014|pp=54–5}} The ''Rites of Zhou'', however, also claims that the hexagrams of the ''Zhou yi'' were derived from an initial set of eight trigrams.{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|2014|p=144}} During the Han dynasty there were various opinions about the historical relationship between the trigrams and the hexagrams.{{sfnp|Nielsen|2003|p=7}} Eventually, a consensus formed around 2nd century AD scholar [[Ma Rong (Han dynasty)|Ma Rong]]'s attribution of the text to the joint work of Fu Xi, King Wen of Zhou, the Duke of Zhou, and [[Confucius]], but this traditional attribution is no longer generally accepted.{{sfnm|1a1=Nielsen|1y=2003|1p=249|2a1=Shchutskii|2y=1979|2p=133}}

=== Structure ===
[[File:Shang dynasty inscribed tortoise plastron.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|alt=A turtle shell inscribed with primitive Chinese characters|Oracle turtle shell featuring the ancient form ([[File:貞-oracle-alt.svg|15px]]) of ''zhēn'' (貞) "to divine"]]

The basic unit of the ''Zhou yi'' is the [[Hexagram (I Ching)|hexagram]] (卦 ''guà''), a figure composed of six stacked horizontal lines (爻 ''yáo''). Each line is either broken or unbroken. The received text of the ''Zhou yi'' contains all 64 possible hexagrams, along with the hexagram's name (卦名 ''guàmíng''), a short hexagram statement (彖 ''tuàn''),{{NoteTag|The word ''tuan'' (彖) refers to a four-legged animal similar to a pig. This is believed to be a gloss for "decision," ''duan'' (斷). The modern word for a hexagram statement is ''guàcí'' (卦辭). {{harvp|Knechtges|2014|pp=1881}} }} and six line statements (爻辭 ''yáocí'').{{NoteTag|Referred to as ''yao'' (繇) in the ''Zuo zhuan''. {{harvp|Nielsen|2003|pp=24, 290}} }} The statements were used to determine the results of divination, but the reasons for having two different methods of reading the hexagram are not known, and it is not known why hexagram statements would be read over line statements or vice versa.{{sfnp|Rutt|1996|pp=122–5}}

The book opens with the first hexagram statement, ''yuán hēng lì zhēn'' (元亨利貞). These four words, translated traditionally by [[James Legge]] as "originating and penetrating, advantageous and firm," are often repeated in the hexagram statements and were already considered an important part of ''I Ching'' interpretation in the 6th century BC. Edward Shaughnessy describes this statement as affirming an "initial receipt" of an offering, "beneficial" for further "divining".{{sfnm|1a1=Rutt|1y=1996|1pp=126, 187–8|2a1=Shchutskii|2y=1979|2pp=65–6|3a1=Shaughnessy|3y=2014|3pp=30–35|4a1=Redmond|4a2=Hon|4y=2014|4p=128}}
The word ''zhēn'' (貞, ancient form [[File:貞-oracle-alt.svg|15px]]) was also used for the verb "divine" in the [[oracle bone]]s of the late [[Shang dynasty]], which preceded the Zhou.  It also carried meanings of being or making upright or correct, and was defined by the Eastern Han scholar [[Zheng Xuan]] as "to enquire into the correctness" of a proposed activity.{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|2014|pp=2–3}}

The names of the hexagrams are usually words that appear in their respective line statements, but in five cases (2, 9, 26, 61, and 63) an unrelated character of unclear purpose appears. The hexagram names could have been chosen arbitrarily from the line statements,{{Sfnm|1a1=Rutt|1y=1996|1p=118|2a1=Shaughnessy|2y=1983|2p=123}} but it is also possible that the line statements were derived from the hexagram names.{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=1879}} The line statements, which make up most of the book, are exceedingly cryptic. Each line begins with a word indicating the line number, "base, 2, 3, 4, 5, top", and either the number 6 for a broken line, or the number 9 for a whole line. Hexagrams 1 and 2 have an extra line statement, named ''yong''.{{sfnp|Rutt|1996|pp=129–30}} Following the line number, the line statements may make oracular or prognostic statements.{{sfnp|Rutt|1996|p=131}} Some line statements also contain poetry or references to historical events.{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|pp=1880–1}}

===Usage===
{{main|I Ching divination}}
[[File:Yarrow stalks for I Ching.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A bundle of thin sticks|Fifty yarrow ''Achillea millefolium'' subsp. ''m. var. millefolium'' stalks, used for I Ching divination.]]
Archaeological evidence shows that Zhou dynasty divination was grounded in [[cleromancy]], the production of seemingly random numbers to determine divine intent.{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|2014|p=14}} The ''Zhou yi'' provided a guide to cleromancy that used the stalks of the [[Achillea millefolium|yarrow plant]], but it is not known how the yarrow stalks became numbers, or how specific lines were chosen from the line readings.{{sfnp|Smith|2012|p=39}} In the hexagrams, broken lines were used as shorthand for the numbers 6 (六) and 8 (八), and solid lines were shorthand for values of 7 (七) and 9 (九). The ''Great Commentary'' contains a late classic description of a process where various numerological operations are performed on a bundle of 50 stalks, leaving remainders of 6 to 9.{{sfnp|Smith|2008|p=27}} Like the ''Zhou yi'' itself, yarrow stalk divination dates to the Western Zhou period, although its modern form is a reconstruction.{{sfnp|Raphals|2013|p=129}}

The ancient narratives ''[[Zuo Zhuan|Zuo zhuan]]'' and ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]'' contain the oldest descriptions of divination using the ''Zhou yi''. The two histories describe more than twenty successful divinations conducted by professional soothsayers for royal families between 671 BC and 487 BC. The method of divination is not explained, and none of the stories employ predetermined commentaries, patterns, or interpretations. Only the hexagrams and line statements are used.{{sfnp|Rutt|1996|p=173}} By the 4th century BC, the authority of the ''Zhou yi'' was also cited for rhetorical purposes, without relation to any stated divination.{{Sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=2012|1p=43|2a1=Raphals|2y=2013|2p=336}} The ''Zuo zhuan'' does not contain records of private individuals, but [[Qin dynasty]] records found at [[Shuihudi Qin bamboo texts|Shuihudi]] show that the hexagrams were privately consulted to answer questions such as business, health, children, and determining lucky days.{{sfnp|Raphals|2013|pp=203–212}}

The most common form of divination with the ''I Ching'' in use today is a reconstruction of the method described in these histories, in the 300 BC ''Great Commentary'', and later in the ''[[Huainanzi]]'' and the ''[[Lunheng]]''. From the ''Great Commentary'''s description, the Neo-Confucian [[Zhu Xi]] reconstructed a method of yarrow stalk divination that is still used throughout the Far East. In the modern period, [[Gao Heng (scholar)|Gao Heng]] attempted his own reconstruction, which varies from Zhu Xi in places.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=2008|1p=27|2a1=Raphals|2y=2013|2p=167}} [[I Ching divination#Coins|Another divination method]], employing coins, became widely used in the Tang dynasty and is still used today. In the modern period, alternative methods such as specialized [[dice]] and [[cartomancy]] have also appeared.{{sfnp|Redmond|Hon|2014|pp=257}}

In the ''Zuo zhuan'' stories, individual lines of hexagrams are denoted by using the genitive particle ''zhi'', followed by the name of another hexagram where that specific line had another form. In later attempts to reconstruct ancient divination methods, the word ''zhi'' was interpreted as a verb meaning "moving to", an apparent indication that hexagrams could be transformed into other hexagrams. However, there are no instances of "changeable lines" in the ''Zuo zhuan''. In all 12 out of 12 line statements quoted, the original hexagrams are used to produce the oracle.{{Sfnm|1a1=Shaughnessy|1y=1983|1p=97|2a1=Rutt|2y=1996|2p=154-5|3a1=Smith|3y=2008|3p=26}}

==The classic: ''I Ching''==
In 136 BC, [[Emperor Wu of Han]] named the ''Zhou yi'' "the first among the classics", dubbing it the ''Classic of Changes'' or ''I Ching''. Emperor Wu's placement of the ''I Ching'' among the [[Four Books and Five Classics|Five Classics]] was informed by a broad span of cultural influences that included [[Confucianism]], [[Daoism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], [[yin and yang|yin-yang cosmology]], and [[Wu Xing]] physical theory.{{sfnp|Smith|2008|p=31-2}} While the ''Zhou yi'' does not contain any cosmological analogies, the ''I Ching'' was read as a microcosm of the universe that offered complex, symbolic correspondences.{{sfnp|Raphals|2013|p=337}} The official edition of the text was literally set in stone, as one of the [[Xiping Stone Classics]].{{sfnm|1a1=Nielsen|1y=2003|1pp=48–51|2a1=Knechtges|2y=2014|2p=1889}} The canonized ''I Ching'' became the standard text for over two thousand years, until alternate versions of the ''Zhou yi'' and related texts were discovered in the 20th century.{{sfnm|1a1=Shaughnessy|1y=2014|1loc=passim|2a1=Smith|2y=2008|2pp=48–50}}

=== Ten Wings ===
{{Main|Ten Wings}}

Part of the canonization of the ''Zhou yi'' bound it to a set of ten commentaries called the [[Ten Wings]]. The Ten Wings are of a much later provenance than the ''Zhou yi'', and are the production of a different society. The ''Zhou yi'' was written in Early [[Old Chinese]], while the Ten Wings were written in a predecessor to [[Middle Chinese]].{{sfnp|Rutt|1996|p=39}} The specific origins of the Ten Wings are still a complete mystery to academics.{{Sfnm|1a1=Shaughnessy|1y=2014|1p=284|2a1=Smith|2y=2008|2pp=31–48}} Regardless of their historical relation to the text, the philosophical depth of the Ten Wings made the ''I Ching'' a perfect fit to Han period Confucian scholarship.{{sfnp|Smith|2012|p=48}} The inclusion of the Ten Wings reflects a widespread recognition in ancient China, found in the ''Zuo zhuan'' and other pre-Han texts, that the ''I Ching'' was a rich moral and symbolic document useful for more than professional divination.{{sfnp|Nylan|2001|p=229}}

Arguably the most important of the Ten Wings is the ''Great Commentary'' (''Dazhuan'') or ''Xi ci'', which dates to roughly 300 BC.{{NoteTag|The received text was rearranged by [[Zhu Xi]]. {{harv|Nielsen|2003|p=258}} }} The ''Great Commentary'' describes the ''I Ching'' as a microcosm of the universe and a symbolic description of the processes of change. By partaking in the spiritual experience of the ''I Ching'', the ''Great Commentary'' states, the individual can understand the deeper patterns of the universe.{{sfnp|Smith|2008|p=27}} Among other subjects, it explains how the eight trigrams proceeded from the eternal oneness of the universe through three [[power of two|bifurcations]].{{sfnp|Nielsen|2003|p=260}} The other Wings provide different perspectives on essentially the same viewpoint, giving ancient, cosmic authority to the ''I Ching''.{{sfnp|Smith|2008|p=48}} For example, the ''Wenyan'' provides a moral interpretation that parallels the first two hexagrams, 乾 (qián) and 坤 (kūn), with [[Tian|Heaven]] and Earth,{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=1882}} and the ''Shuogua'' attributes to the symbolic function of the hexagrams the ability to understand self, world, and destiny.{{sfnp|Redmond|Hon|2014|pp=151–2}} Throughout the Ten Wings, there are passages that seem to purposefully increase the ambiguity of the base text, pointing to a recognition of multiple layers of symbolism.{{sfnp|Nylan|2001|p=221}}

The ''Great Commentary'' associates knowledge of the ''I Ching'' with the ability to "delight in Heaven and understand fate;" the sage who reads it will see cosmological patterns and not despair in mere material difficulties.{{sfnp|Nylan|2001|pp=248–9}} The Japanese word for "metaphysics", ''keijijōgaku'' (形而上学; [[pinyin]]: ''xíng ér shàng xué'') is derived from a statement found in the ''Great Commentary'' that "what is above form [''xíng ér shàng''] is called [[Tao|Dao]]; what is under form is called a tool".{{sfnp|Yuasa|2008|p=51}} The word has also been borrowed into Korean and re-borrowed back into Chinese.

The Ten Wings were traditionally attributed to [[Confucius]], possibly based on a misreading of the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''.{{sfnp|Peterson|1982|p=73}} Although it rested on historically shaky grounds, the association of the ''I Ching'' with Confucius gave weight to the text and was taken as an article of faith throughout the Han and Tang dynasties.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=2008|1p=27|2a1=Nielsen|2y=2003|2pp=138, 211}} The ''I Ching'' was not included in the [[burning of books and burying of scholars|burning of the Confucian classics]], and textual evidence strongly suggests that Confucius did not consider the ''Zhou yi'' a "classic". An ancient commentary on the ''Zhou yi'' found at Mawangdui portrays Confucius as endorsing it as a source of wisdom first and an imperfect divination text second.{{Sfnm|1a1=Shchutskii|1y=1979|1p=213|2a1=Smith|2y=2012|2p=46}}

==Hexagrams==
{{main|Hexagram (I Ching)|List of hexagrams of the I Ching}}

In the canonical ''I Ching'', the hexagrams are arranged in an order dubbed the [[King Wen sequence]] after King Wen of Zhou, who founded the Zhou dynasty and supposedly reformed the method of interpretation. The sequence generally pairs hexagrams with their upside-down equivalents, although in eight cases hexagrams are paired with their inversion.{{sfnp|Smith|2008|p=37}} Another order, found at [[Mawangdui]] in 1973, arranges the hexagrams into eight groups sharing the same upper trigram. But the oldest known manuscript, found in 1987 and now held by the Shanghai Library, was almost certainly arranged in the King Wen sequence, and it has even been proposed that a pottery paddle from the Western Zhou period contains four hexagrams in the King Wen sequence.{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|2014|pp=52–3, 16-7}} Whichever of these arrangements is older, it is not evident that the order of the hexagrams was of interest to the original authors of the ''Zhou yi''. The assignment of numbers, binary or decimal, to specific hexagrams is a modern invention.{{sfnp|Rutt|1996|pp=114–8}}

==Interpretation and influence==
{{see also|I Ching's influence}}
The Sinologist Michael Nylan describes the ''I Ching'' as the best-known Chinese book in the world.{{sfnp|Nylan|2001|pp=204–6}} In East Asia, it is a foundational text for the Confucian and Daoist philosophical traditions, while in the West, it attracted the attention of Enlightenment intellectuals and prominent literary and cultural figures.

===Eastern Han and Six Dynasties===
During the [[Han dynasty|Eastern Han]], ''I Ching'' interpretation divided into two schools, originating in a dispute over minor differences between different editions of the received text.{{Sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=2008|1p=58|2a1=Nylan|2y=2001|2p=45|3a1=Redmond|3a2=Hon|3y=2014|3p=159}} The first school, known as New Text criticism, was more egalitarian and eclectic, and sought to find symbolic and numerological parallels between the natural world and the hexagrams. Their commentaries provided the basis of the [[School of Naturalists|School of Images and Numbers]]. The other school, Old Text criticism, was more scholarly and hierarchical, and focused on the moral content of the text, providing the basis for the School of Meanings and Principles.{{sfnp|Smith|2012|p=76-8}} The New Text scholars distributed alternate versions of the text and freely integrated non-canonical commentaries into their work, as well as propagating alternate systems of divination such as the ''[[Taixuanjing]]''.{{Sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=2008|1pp=76–9|2a1=Knechtges|2y=2014|2p=1889}} Most of this early commentary, such as the image and number work of [[Jing Fang]], [[Yu Fan]] and [[Xun Shuang]], is no longer extant.{{sfnp|Smith|2008|pp=57, 67, 84–6}} Only short fragments survive, from a Tang dynasty text called ''Zhou yi jijie''.{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=1891}}

With the fall of the Han, ''I Ching'' scholarship was no longer organized into systematic schools. The most influential writer of this period was [[Wang Bi]], who discarded the numerology of Han commentators and integrated the philosophy of the Ten Wings directly into the central text of the ''I Ching'', creating such a persuasive narrative that Han commentators were no longer considered significant. A century later [[Han Kangbo]] added commentaries on the Ten Wings to Wang Bi's book, creating a text called the ''Zhouyi zhu''. The principal rival interpretation was a practical text on divination by the soothsayer [[Guan Lu]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=2008|1pp=89–90, 98|2a1=Hon|2y=2005|2pp=29–30|3a1=Knechtges|3y=2014|3p=1890}}

===Tang and Song dynasties===
At the beginning of the [[Tang dynasty]], [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] ordered [[Kong Yingda]] to create a canonical edition of the ''I Ching''. Choosing the 3rd-century  ''Zhouyi zhu'' as the official commentary, he added to it a subcommentary drawing out the subtler levels of Wang Bi's explanations. The resulting work, the ''Zhouyi zhengi'', became the standard edition of the ''I Ching'' through the [[Song dynasty]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Hon|1y=2005|1pp=29–33|2a1=Knechtges|2y=2014|2p=1891}}

By the 11th century, the ''I Ching'' was being read as a work of intricate philosophy, as a jumping-off point for examining great metaphysical questions and ethical issues.{{sfnp|Hon|2005|p=144}} [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]], patriarch of the Neo-Confucian [[Cheng-Zhu school|Cheng–Zhu school]], read the ''I Ching'' as a guide to moral perfection. He described the text as a way to for ministers to form honest political factions, root out corruption, and solve problems in government.{{Sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=2008|1p=128|2a1=Redmond|2a2=Hon|2y=2014|2p=177}}

The contemporary scholar [[Shao Yong]] rearranged the hexagrams in a format that resembles modern [[binary number]]s, although he did not intend his arrangement to be used mathematically.{{sfnp|Redmond|Hon|2014|p=227}} This arrangement, sometimes called the [[Bagua#Fu Xi "Earlier Heaven"|binary sequence]], later inspired Leibnitz.

===Neo-Confucian===
The 12th century Neo-Confucian [[Zhu Xi]], cofounder of the Cheng–Zhu school, rejected both of the Han dynasty lines of commentary on the ''I Ching'', proposing that the text was a work of divination, not philosophy. However, he still considered it useful for understanding the moral practices of the ancients, called "rectification of the mind" in the ''[[Great Learning]]''. Zhu Xi's reconstruction of [[I Ching divination|I Ching yarrow stalk divination]], based in part on the ''Great Commentary'' account, became the standard form and is still in use today.{{sfnm|1a1=Adler|1y=2002|1pp=v-xi|2a1=Smith|2y=2008|2p=229}}

As China entered the early modern period, the ''I Ching'' took on renewed relevance in both Confucian and Daoist study. The [[Kangxi Emperor]] was especially fond of the ''I Ching'' and ordered new interpretations of it.{{sfnp|Smith|2008|p=177}} [[Qing dynasty]] scholars focused more intently on understanding pre-classical grammar, assisting the development of new philological approaches in the modern period.{{sfnp|Nielsen|2003|p=xvi}}

===Korean and Japanese===
In 1557, the Korean Neo-Confucian [[Yi Hwang]] produced one of the most influential ''I Ching'' studies of the early modern era, claiming that the spirit was a [[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|principle (''li'')]] and not a material force (''[[qi]]''). Hwang accused the Neo-Confucian school of having misread Zhu Xi. His critique proved influential not only in Korea but also in Japan.{{sfnp|Ng|2000b|pp=55–6}} Other than this contribution, the ''I Ching'' was not central to the development of Korean Confucianism, and by the 19th century, ''I Ching'' studies were integrated into the ''[[silhak]]'' reform movement.{{sfnp|Ng|2000b|p=65}}

In medieval Japan, secret teachings on the ''I Ching'' were publicized by [[Rinzai Zen]] master [[Kokan Shiren]] and the Shintoist [[Yoshida Kanetomo]].{{sfnp|Ng|2000a|p=7, 15}} ''I Ching'' studies in Japan took on new importance in the [[Edo period]], during which over 1,000 books were published on the subject by over 400 authors. The majority of these books were serious works of philology, reconstructing ancient usages and commentaries for practical purposes. A sizable minority focused on numerology, symbolism, and divination.{{sfnp|Ng|2000a|pp=22–25}} During this time, over 150 editions of earlier Chinese commentaries were reprinted in Japan, including several texts that had become lost in China.{{sfnp|Ng|2000a|pp=28–9}} In the early Edo period, writers such as [[Itō Jinsai]], [[Kumazawa Banzan]], and [[Toju Nakae|Nakae Toju]] ranked the ''I Ching'' the greatest of the Confucian classics.{{sfnp|Ng|2000a|pp=38–9}} Many writers attempted to use the ''I Ching'' to explain [[rangaku|Western science in a Japanese framework]]. One writer, Shizuki Tadao, even attempted to employ [[Newtonian mechanics]] and the [[Copernican principle]] within an ''I Ching'' cosmology.{{sfnp|Ng|2000a|pp=143–5}} This line of argument was later taken up in China by the Qing scholar and official [[Zhang Zhidong]].{{sfnp|Smith|2008|p=197}}

===Early European===
[[File:Diagram of I Ching hexagrams owned by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, 1701.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A circular diagram of I Ching hexagrams|A diagram of ''I Ching'' hexagrams sent to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] from [[Joachim Bouvet]]. The Arabic numerals were added by Leibniz.]]
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], who was corresponding with [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuits in China]], wrote the first European commentary on the ''I Ching'' in 1703, arguing that it proved the universality of [[binary number]]s and [[theism]], since the broken lines, the "0" or "nothingness", cannot become solid lines, the "1" or "oneness", without the intervention of [[God]].{{sfnm|1a1=Nelson|1y=2011|1p=379|2a1=Smith|2y=2008|2p=204}} This was criticized by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], who proclaimed that binary system and [[Chinese characters]] were "empty forms" that could not articulate spoken words with the clarity of the Western [[alphabet]].{{sfnp|Nelson|2011|p=381}} In their discussion, ''I Ching'' hexagrams and Chinese characters were conflated into a single foreign idea, sparking a dialogue on Western philosophical questions such as universality and the nature of communication. In the 20th century, [[Jacques Derrida]] identified Hegel's argument as [[logocentrism|logocentric]], but accepted without question Hegel's premise that the Chinese language cannot express philosophical ideas.{{sfnp|Nelson|2011|p=383}}

===Modern===
After the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911, the ''I Ching'' was no longer part of mainstream Chinese political philosophy, but it maintained cultural influence as China's most ancient text. Borrowing back from Leibniz, Chinese writers offered parallels between the ''I Ching'' and subjects such as [[linear algebra]] and [[logic in computer science]], aiming to demonstrate that ancient Chinese cosmology had anticipated Western discoveries.{{sfnp|Smith|2008|p=205}} The Sinologist [[Joseph Needham]] took the opposite stance, arguing that the ''I Ching'' had actually impeded scientific development by incorporating all physical knowledge into its metaphysics.{{sfnp|Redmond|Hon|2014|p=231}} The psychologist [[Carl Jung]] took interest in the possible universal nature of the imagery of the ''I Ching'', and he introduced an influential German translation by [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]] by discussing his theories of [[archetype]]s and [[synchronicity]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=2008|1p=212|2a1=Redmond|2a2=Hon|2y=2014|2pp=205–214}} Jung wrote, "Even to the most biased eye, it is obvious that this book represents one long admonition to careful scrutiny of one's own character, attitude, and motives."{{sfnp|Smith|2012|pp=11, 198}} The book had a notable impact on the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]] and on 20th century cultural figures such as [[Philip K. Dick]], [[John Cage]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], and [[Hermann Hesse]].{{sfnp|Smith|2012|pp=11, 198}}

The modern period also brought a new level of skepticism and rigor to ''I Ching'' scholarship. [[Li Jingchi]] spent several decades producing a new interpretation of the text, which was published posthumously in 1978. [[Gao Heng (scholar)|Gao Heng]], an expert in pre-Qin China, reinvestigated its use as a Zhou dynasty oracle. Edward Shaughnessy proposed a new dating for the various strata of the text.{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|pp=1884–5}} New archaeological discoveries have enabled a deeper level of insight into how the text was used in the centuries before the Qin dynasty. Proponents of newly reconstructed Western Zhou readings, which often differ greatly from traditional readings of the text, are sometimes called the "modernist school."{{sfnm|1a1=Redmond|1a2=Hon|1y=2014|1p=122ff|2a1=Shaughnessy|2y=2014|2loc=passim}}

==Translations==
{{Taoism condensed}}
The ''I Ching'' has been translated into Western languages dozens of times. The most influential edition is the 1923 German translation of [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]], later translated to English by Cary Baynes.{{sfnm|1a1=Shaughnessy|1y=2014|1p=1|2a1=Redmond|2a2=Hon|2y=2014|2p=239}} The earliest complete published ''I Ching'' translation in a Western language was a Latin translation done in the 1730s by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionary [[Jean-Baptiste Régis]] that was published in Germany in the 1830s.{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|1993|p=225}} Although Thomas McClatchie and [[James Legge]] had both translated the text in the 19th century, the text gained significant traction during the counterculture of the 1960s, with the translations of Wilhelm and [[John Blofeld]] attracting particular interest.{{sfnp|Smith|2012|pp=198–9}} [[Richard Rutt]]'s 1996 translation incorporated much of the new archaeological and philological discoveries of the 20th century. Gregory Whincup's 1986 translation also attempts to reconstruct Zhou period readings.{{sfnp|Redmond|Hon|2014|pp=241–3}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13696">[[Image:Pharaoh.svg|thumb|200px|[[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[pharaoh]]s were worshipped as god-kings]]
An '''imperial cult''' is a form of [[state religion]] in which an [[emperor]] or a [[dynasty]] of emperors (or rulers of another title) are [[worship]]ped as [[demigod]]s or [[deities]]. "[[Cult (religious practice)|Cult]]" here is used to mean "worship", not in the modern pejorative sense. The cult may be one of [[cult of personality|personality]] in the case of a newly arisen [[Euhemerus]] figure, or one of national identity (e.g., [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Pharaoh]] or [[Empire of Japan]]) or supranational identity in the case of a [[multi-ethnic]] state (e.g., [[History of China#Imperial China|Imperial China]], [[Roman Empire]]). A ''divine king'' is a [[monarch]] who is held in a special [[religious]] significance by his subjects, and serves as both head of state and a deity or head religious figure. This system of government combines [[theocracy]] with an [[absolute monarchy]].

==Historical imperial cults==
{{Further|List of people who have been considered deities}}

===Ancient Egypt===
{{Main|Pharaoh}}
The [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[pharaoh]]s were, throughout ancient Egyptian history, believed to be incarnations of the [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] [[Horus]]; thereby derived by being the son of [[Osiris]], the afterlife deity, and [[Isis]], goddess of marriage.

The [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] based its own legitimacy in the eyes of its Greek subjects on their association with, and incorporation into, the imperial [[Ptolemaic cult of Alexander the Great|cult of Alexander the Great]].

===Imperial China===
{{see also|Son of Heaven|Chinese sovereign|Religion in China}}
In [[History of China#Imperial China|Imperial China]], the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] was considered the [[Son of Heaven]]. The [[Kinship|scion]] and representative of heaven on earth, he was the ruler of [[all under heaven]], the bearer of the [[Mandate of Heaven]], his commands considered sacred edicts. A number of legendary figures preceding the proper imperial era of China also hold the honorific title of emperor, such as the [[Yellow Emperor]] and the [[Jade Emperor]].

===Ancient Rome===
{{Main|Imperial cult (ancient Rome)}}
[[File:Augusto come giove, 00-50 dc circa.JPG|thumb|upright|Augustus as [[Jove]], holding scepter and orb (first half of 1st century AD).&lt;ref&gt;Imperial cult in Roman Britain-Google docs&lt;/ref&gt; The Imperial cult of ancient Rome identified [[Roman emperor|emperors]] and some members of their families with the [[Divine right of kings|divinely sanctioned]] authority (''[[auctoritas]]'') of the [[Roman State]]. The official offer of ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#cultus|cultus]]'' to a living emperor acknowledged his office and rule as divinely approved and constitutional: his Principate should therefore demonstrate [[pietas|pious respect]] for traditional Republican deities and [[mos maiorum|mores]] {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}]]

Even before the rise of the Caesars, there are traces of a "regal spirituality" in Roman society. In earliest Roman times the king was a spiritual and [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] figure and ranked higher than the ''[[Flamen|flamines]]'' (priestly order), while later on in history only a shadow of the primordial condition was left with the sacrificial ''[[Rex Sacrorum|rex sacrorum]]'' linked closely to the [[plebeian]] orders.

King [[Numitor]] corresponds to the regal-sacred principle in early Roman history. [[Romulus]], the legendary [[Founding of Rome|founder of Rome]], was heroized into [[Quirinus]], the "undefeated god", with whom the later Caesars identified and of whom they considered themselves incarnations.

[[Varro]] spoke of the initiatory mystery and power of Roman regality (''adytum et initia regis''), inaccessible to the exoteric communality.

In [[Plutarch]]'s ''Phyrro'', 19.5, the Greek ambassador declared amid the Roman Senate he felt instead like being in the midst of "a whole assembly of Kings".

As the [[Roman Empire]] developed the Imperial cult gradually developed more formally and constituted the worship of the [[Roman emperor]] as a god. This practice began at the start of the Empire under [[Augustus]], and became a prominent element of [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]].

The cult spread over the whole Empire within a few decades, more strongly in the east than in the west. Emperor [[Diocletian]] further reinforced it when he demanded the ''[[proskynesis]]'' and adopted the adjective ''sacrum'' for all things pertaining to the imperial person.

The [[deification]] of emperors was gradually abandoned after the emperor [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine I]] started supporting [[Christianity]]. However, the concept of the imperial person as "sacred" carried over, in a Christianized form, into the [[Byzantine Empire]].

===Ancient and Imperial Japan===
{{main|State Shinto}}
[[Image:Hirohito in dress uniform.jpg|thumb|100px|Emperor [[Hirohito]] was the last divine Emperor of Japan.]]
In [[ancient Japan]], it was customary for every clan to claim descendancy from gods (''[[ujigami]]'') and the royal family or clan tended to define their ancestor as the dominant or most important ''[[kami]]'' of the time.  Later in history, this was considered common practice by noble families, and the head members of the family, including that of the imperial family, were not seen to be divine. Rather than establish sovereignty by the manner of claimed godhood over the nation however, the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] and the imperial family stood as the bond between the heavens and the earth by claims of descending from the goddess [[Amaterasu]], instead dealing in affairs related with the gods than any major secular political event, with few cases scattered about history. It was not until the [[Meiji period]] and the [[Meiji Restoration|establishment]] of the [[Empire of Japan|Empire]], that the Emperor began to be venerated along with a growing sense of [[Japanese nationalism|nationalism]].

* [[Arahitogami]] – the concept of ''a god who is a human being'' applied to the [[Hirohito|Emperor Shōwa]] (Emperor Hirohito as he was known in the [[Western World]]), until the [[End of World War II in Asia|end]] of [[World War II]].
* [[Humanity Declaration|Ningen-sengen]] – the declaration with which the Emperor Shōwa, on New Year's Day 1946, (formally) declined claims of divinity, keeping with traditional family values as expressed in the Shinto religion.

===Ancient Southeast Asia===
[[Devaraja]] is the [[Hindu]]-[[Buddhist]] [[cult]] of [[divine|deified]] [[Royal family|royalty]] in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="God and King"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.easternbookcorporation.com/moreinfo.php?txt_searchstring=7306 |title=God and King: The Devaraja Cult in South Asian Art &amp; Architecture |author=Sengupta, Arputha Rani (Ed.) |year=2005 |work= |publisher= |isbn= 8189233262|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is simply described as Southeast Asian concept of [[divine king]]. The concept viewed the [[monarch]] (king) as the living god, the [[incarnation]] of the supreme god, often attributed to [[Shiva]] or [[Vishnu]], on earth. The concept is closely related to [[India]]n concept of [[Chakravartin]] (universal monarch). In politics, it is viewed as the divine justification of a king's rule. The concept gained its elaborate manifestations in ancient [[Java]] and [[Cambodia]], where monuments such as [[Prambanan]] and [[Angkor Wat]] were erected to celebrate the king's divine rule on earth.

In the [[Medang]] kingdom, it was customary to erect a ''[[candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' (temple) to honor the soul of a deceased king. The image inside the [[garbhagriha]] (inner sanctum) of the temple often portrayed the king as a god, since the soul was thought to be united with the god referred to, in [[svarga]]loka. It is suggested that the cult was the fusion of Hinduism with native [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] [[ancestor worship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Drs. R. Soekmono,| title= ''Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia 2'', 2nd ed. | publisher = Penerbit Kanisius | date= 1973, 5th reprint edition in 1988 | location =Yogyakarta| page =83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Java, the tradition of the divine king extended to the [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]], Singhasari and [[Majapahit]] kingdoms in the 15th century. The tradition of public reverence to the [[King of Cambodia]] and [[King of Thailand]] is the continuation of this ancient devaraja cult. The [[Susuhunan]] of [[Surakarta]] and Sultan of [[Yogyakarta]]  are the direct descendants of the [[Mataram Sultanate]] founded in the late 17th century, and was said to be the continuation of the Ancient 8th century [[Mataram kingdom]].

===Tibet===
Tibetan Buddhism uses the [[tulku]] system, an ancient way of finding the reincarnation of a previous deceased lama: they are usually young boys, sometimes of wealthy and influential families and sometimes of peasant families like the current [[14th Dalai Lama]], that are found and enthroned as the reincarnation of an enlightened person that has already deceased. Every tulku is still called on the title of [[Rinpoche]] and is given as much respect as his previous reincarnation. Complying with each and every wish of a child or adult tulku is not unusual. Tulkus lead responsible lives because of their status as a bodhisattva. While many tulkus are monks, some tulkus choose to lead lay lives with families of their own.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

'''Kamadhenu''' ({{lang-sa|कामधेनु}}, {{IPA-sa|kaːməˈd̪ʱeːnʊ|}}, {{IAST|Kāmadhenu}}), also known as '''Surabhi''' ({{lang|sa|सुरभि}}, {{IAST|Surabhī}}), is a divine bovine-goddess described in [[Hinduism]] as the mother of all cows. She is a miraculous "cow of plenty" who provides her owner whatever he desires and is often portrayed as the mother of other cattle.In iconography, she is generally depicted as a white cow with a female head and breasts, the wings of a bird, and the tail of a [[peafowl]] or as a white cow containing various deities within her body. [[Cattle in religion#In Hinduism|All cows are venerated]] in [[Hinduism]] as the earthly embodiment of the Kamadhenu. As such, Kamadhenu is not worshipped independently as a goddess, and temples are not dedicated to her honor alone; rather, she is honored by the veneration of cows in general throughout the observant Hindu population.

Hindu scriptures provide diverse accounts of the birth of Kamadhenu. While some narrate that she emerged from [[Samudra manthan|the churning of the cosmic ocean]], others describe her as the daughter of the creator god [[Daksha]], and as the wife of the sage [[Kashyapa]]. Still other scriptures narrate that Kamadhenu was in the possession of either [[Jamadagni]] or [[Vashista]] (both ancient sages), and that kings who tried to steal her from the sage ultimately faced dire consequences for their actions. Kamadhenu plays the important role of providing milk and milk products to be used in her sage-master's oblations; she is also capable of producing fierce warriors to protect him. In addition to dwelling in the sage's hermitage, she is also described as dwelling in [[Goloka]] - the realm of the cows - and [[Patala]], the netherworld.

==Etymology==
Kamadhenu is often addressed by the proper name ''Surabhi'' or ''Shurbhi'', which is also used as a synonym for an ordinary cow.&lt;ref name = "kamadhenu"/&gt; Professor Jacobi considers the name Surabhi—"the fragrant one"—to have originated from the peculiar smell of cows.&lt;ref name="hastings"/&gt; According to the [[Monier Monier-Williams|Monier Williams]] Sanskrit–English Dictionary (1899), Surabhi means fragrant, charming, pleasing, as well as cow and earth. It can specifically refer to the divine cow Kamadhenu, the mother of cattle who is also sometimes described as a ''[[Matrika]]'' ("mother") goddess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw1235-suravIthI.jpg|title=Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary|last=Monier-Williams|first = Monier|year=2008|page=1232|origyear = 1899|publisher=[[University of Cologne|Universität zu Köln]]|authorlink =Monier Monier-Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other proper names attributed to Kamadhenu are ''Sabala'' ("the spotted one") and ''Kapila'' ("the red one").&lt;ref name="Yves"/&gt;

The epithets "Kamadhenu", "Kamaduh" (कामदुह्) and "Kamaduha" (कामदुहा) literally mean the cow "from whom all that is desired is drawn"—"the cow of plenty".&lt;ref name="Yves"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0272-kAmakalikA.jpg|title=Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary|last=Monier-Williams|first = Monier|year=2008|page=272|origyear = 1899|publisher=[[University of Cologne|Universität zu Köln]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Devi Bhagavata Purana]]'', in the context of the birth of [[Bhishma]], the cow [[Nandini]] is given the epithet Kamadhenu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/db/bk02ch03.htm|title=The S'rîmad Devî Bhâgawatam: Book 2: Chapter 3|first=Swami Vijñanananda|date=1921–22|publisher=Sacred texts archive|accessdate=13 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other instances, Nandini is described as the cow-daughter of Surabhi-Kamadhenu. The scholar [[Vettam Mani]] considers Nandini and Surabhi to be synonyms of Kamadhenu.&lt;ref name = "kamadhenu"/&gt;

==Iconography and symbolism==
[[File:Sacred cow2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|In a poster condemning the consumption of beef, the sacred cow Kamadhenu is depicted as containing various deities within her body.]]

According to Indologist [[Madeleine Biardeau]], Kamadhenu or Kamaduh is the generic name of [[Cattle in religion#In Hinduism|the sacred cow]], who is regarded as the source of all prosperity in Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Yves"&gt;{{cite book|last=Biardeau|first=Madeleine |authorlink=Madeleine Biardeau|editor=Yves Bonnefoy|title=Asian mythologies|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-06456-7|page=99|chapter=Kamadhenu: The Religious Cow, Symbol of Prosperity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamadhenu is regarded as a form of [[Devi]] (the Hindu Divine Mother)&lt;ref name = "dattatreya"/&gt; and is closely related to the fertile Mother Earth ([[Prithvi]]), who is often described as a cow in Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="Yves"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "dattatreya"/&gt; The sacred cow denotes "purity and non-erotic fertility, ... sacrificing and motherly nature, [and] sustenance of human life".&lt;ref name = "dattatreya"/&gt;

Frederick M. Smith describes Kamadhenu as a "popular and enduring image in Indian art".&lt;ref name = "smith"/&gt; All the gods are believed to reside in the body of Kamadhenu—the generic cow. Her four legs are the scriptural [[Vedas]]; her horns are the triune gods [[Brahma]] (tip), [[Vishnu]] (middle) and [[Shiva]] (base); her eyes are the sun and moon gods, her shoulders the fire-god [[Agni]] and the wind-god [[Vayu]] and her legs the [[Himalayas]]. Kamadhenu is often depicted in this form in poster art.&lt;ref name = "smith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Frederick M.|title=The self possessed: Deity and spirit possession in South Asian literature and civilization |year=2006|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-13748-5|pages=404, pp. 402–3 (Plates 5 and 6 for the two representations of Kamadhenu)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="venu"&gt;{{cite book|first= R. Venugopalam|title=Rituals and Culture of India|year=2003|publisher=B. Jain Publishers|isbn=978-81-8056-373-7|pages=119–120|chapter=Animal Deities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another representation of Kamadhenu shows her with the body of a white [[Zebu]] cow, crowned woman's head, colourful eagle wings and a peacock's tail. According to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], this form is influenced by the iconography of the Islamic [[Buraq]], who is portrayed with a horse's body, wings, and a woman's face. Contemporary poster art also portrays Kamadhenu in this form.&lt;ref name = "smith"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/88274.html?mulR=7702|title=Kamadhenu, The Wish-Granting Cow|year=2010|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art|accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cow, identified with Kamadhenu, is often depicted accompanying the god [[Dattatreya]]. In relation to the deity's iconography, she denotes the Brahminical aspect and [[Vaishnava]] connection of the deity contrasting with the accompanying dogs—symbolizing a non-Brahminical aspect. She also symbolizes the ''[[Panchatattva|Panch Bhuta]]'' (the five classical elements) in the icon. Dattatreya is sometimes depicted holding the divine cow in one of his hands.&lt;ref name = "dattatreya"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rigopoulos|first=Antonio |title=Dattātreya: the immortal guru, yogin, and avatāra|year=1998|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-3695-0|pages=231, 233, 243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth and children==
[[File:Samudramanthan.jpg|thumb|Kamadhenu (left, 2nd from top) depicted in a scene of the Churning of the Cosmic Ocean]]

The ''[[Mahabharata]]'' ([[Adi Parva]] book) records that Kamadhenu-Surabhi rose from the churning of the cosmic ocean (''[[Samudra manthan]]'') by the gods and demons to acquire ''[[Amrita]]'' (ambrosia, elixir of life).&lt;ref name = "kamadhenu"/&gt; As such, she is regarded the offspring of the gods and demons, created when they churned the cosmic milk ocean and then given to the [[Saptarishi]], the seven great seers.&lt;ref name = "smith"/&gt; She was ordered by the creator-god [[Brahma]] to give milk, and supply it and ''[[ghee]]'' ("clarified butter") for ritual fire-sacrifices.&lt;ref name="venu"/&gt;

The ''[[Anushasana Parva]]'' book of the epic narrates that Surabhi was born from the belch of "the creator" (''[[Prajapati]]'') [[Daksha]] after he drank the ''Amrita'' that rose from the Samudra manthan. Further, Surabhi gave birth to many golden cows called ''Kapila cows'', who were called the mothers of the world.&lt;ref name="hastings"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ganguli|first=Kisari Mohan |title=The Mahabharata: Book 13: Anusasana Parva|chapter-url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m13/m13b042.htm|date=1883–1896|publisher=Sacred texts archive|chapter=SECTION LXXVII}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Satapatha Brahmana]]'' also tells a similar tale: ''Prajapati'' created Surabhi from his breath.&lt;ref name="hastings"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobi|first=H.|editor=[[James Hastings]]|title=Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediaofr04hastuoft#page/226/mode/2up/search/Surabhi|volume=4|date=1908–1927|pages=225–6|chapter=Cow (Hindu)|title-link=Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Udyoga Parva]]'' Book of the ''Mahabharata'' narrates that the creator-god [[Brahma]] drank so much ''Amrita'' that he vomited some of it, from which emerged Surabhi.&lt;ref name = "kamadhenu"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Udyoga"/&gt;

According to the ''[[Ramayana]]'', Surabhi is the daughter of sage [[Kashyapa]] and his wife [[Krodhavasha]], the daughter of [[Daksha]]. Her daughters Rohini and Gandharvi are the mothers of cattle and horses respectively. Still, it is Surabhi who is described as the mother of all cows in the text.&lt;ref name = "sharma"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=Ramashraya |title=Socio-Political Study of the Valmiki Ramayana|year=1971|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ|page=220|isbn=978-81-208-0078-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "sharma"/&gt; However, in the ''[[Puranas]]'', such as ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' and ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', Surabhi is described as the daughter of Daksha and the wife of Kashyapa, as well as the mother of cows and buffaloes.&lt;ref name = "kamadhenu"&gt;Mani pp. 379–81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srimadbhagavatam.org/canto6/chapter6.html|title=Bhagavata Purana: Canto 6: Chapter 6: The Progeny of the Daughters of Daksha|last=Aadhar|first=Anand|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Matsya Purana]]'' notes two conflicting descriptions of Surabhi. In one chapter, it describes Surabhi as the consort of [[Brahma]] and their union produced the cow Yogishvari,She is then described as the mother of cows and quadrupeds. In another instance, she is described as a daughter of Daksha, wife of Kashyapa and the mother of cows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=A Taluqdar of Oudh|title=The Matsya Puranam|series=The Sacred books of the Hindus|volume=2|year=2008|publisher=Cosmo Publications for Genesis Publishing Pvt Ltd.|isbn=978-81-307-0533-0|pages=52, 137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Harivamsa]]'', an appendix of the ''Mahabharata'', calls Surabhi the mother of [[Amrita]] (ambrosia), [[Brahmin]]s, cows and Rudras.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kamadhenu.jpg|thumb|left|Kamadhenu pictured with her calf]]

The ''[[Devi Bhagavata Purana]]'' narrates that [[Krishna]] and his lover [[Radha]] were enjoying dalliance, when they thirsted for milk. So, Krishna created a cow called Surabhi and a calf called Manoratha from the left side of his body, and milked the cow. When drinking the milk, the milk pot fell on the ground and broke, spilling the milk, which became the [[Kshirasagara]], the cosmic milk ocean. Numerous cows then emerged from the pores of Surabhi's skin and were presented to the cowherd-companions (Gopas) of Krishna by him. Then Krishna worshipped Surabhi and decreed that she—a cow, the giver of milk and prosperity—be worshipped at [[Diwali]] on [[Bali Pratipada]] day.&lt;ref name = "kamadhenu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/db/bk09ch49.htm|title=The S'rîmad Devî Bhâgawatam: On the anecdote of Surabhi|first=Swami Vijñanananda|date=1921–22|publisher=Sacred texts archive|accessdate=13 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various other scriptural references describe Surabhi as the mother of the Rudras including [[Nirrti]] (Kashyapa being the father), the cow [[Nandini]] and even the serpent-people [[nāga]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Daniélou|first=Alain |title=The histories of gods India|year=1991|publisher=Inner Traditions International|isbn=978-0-89281-354-4|pages=102, 127, 308, 320}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mahabharata'' also makes a passing reference to Surabhi as the mother of Nandini (literally "daughter") in the context of the birth of [[Bhishma]], an incarnation of a ''Vasu'' deity. Nandini, like her mother, is a "cow of plenty" or ''Kamadhenu'', and resides with sage Vashista. Nandini is stolen by the divine [[Vasus]] and thus cursed by the sage to be born on the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Buitenen|first=J. A. |title=The Mahabharata: The book of the beginning|volume=1|year=1975|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-84663-7|pages=220–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Raghuvamsa]]'' of [[Kalidasa]] mentions that king [[Dilīpa|Dilip]]—an ancestor of god [[Rama]]—once passed by Kamadhenu-Surabhi, but failed to pay respects to her, thus incurring the wrath of the divine cow, who cursed the king to go childless. So, since Kamadhenu had gone to Patala, the guru of Dilip, Vasistha advised the king to serve Nandini, Kamadhenu's daughter who was in the hermitage. The king and his wife propitiated Nandini, who neutralized her mother's curse and blessed the king to have a son, who was named [[Raghu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kale|first=M. R.|title=The Raghuvamsa of Kalidasa: Cantos I – V|year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ|isbn=978-81-208-0861-4|pages=xv, xvi, 1–27|chapter=Cantos I and II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Ramayana'', Surabhi is described to be distressed by the treatment of her sons—the oxen—in fields. Her tears are considered a bad omen for the gods by [[Indra]], the god-king of heaven.&lt;ref name = "sharma"/&gt; The ''[[Vana Parva]]'' book of the ''Mahbharata'' also narrates a similar instance: Surabhi cries about the plight of her son—a bullock, who is overworked and beaten by his peasant-master. Indra, moved by Surabhi's tears, rains to stop the ploughing of the tormented bullock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Buitenen|first=J. A. |title=The Mahabharata: Book 2: The Book of Assembly; Book 3: The Book of the Forest|volume=2|year=1975|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-84664-4|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wealth and protector of the Brahmin==
In Hindu Religion, Kamadhenu is often associated with the [[Brahmin]] ("priest class" including sages), whose wealth she symbolizes. Cow's milk and its derivatives such as [[ghee]] (clarified butter) are integral parts of Vedic fire sacrifices, which are conducted by Brahmin priests; thus the ancient Kamadhenu is sometimes also referred to the ''Homadhenu''—the cow from whom oblations are drawn. Moreover, the cow also offers the Brahmin—who is prohibited to fight—protection against abusive kings who try to harm them. As a goddess, she becomes a warrior, creating armies to protect her master and herself.&lt;ref name="Yves"/&gt;

===Jamadagni's cow===
[[File:Parashurama killing Kartavirya Arjuna.jpg|thumb|left|Parshurama slaying Kartavirya Arjuna as Kamadhenu and her calf flee]]

A legend narrates that the sacrificial cow Kamadhenu resided with sage [[Jamadagni]]. The earliest version of the legend, which appears in the epic [[Mahabharata]], narrates that the thousand-armed ''[[Haihaya]]'' king, [[Kartavirya Arjuna]], destroyed Jamadagni's hermitage and captured the calf of Kamadhenu. To retrieve the calf, Jamadagni's son [[Parashurama]] slew the king, whose sons in turn killed Jamadagni. Parashurama then destroyed the ''[[kshatriya]]'' ("warrior") race 21 times and his father is resurrected by divine grace.&lt;ref name="vyas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Donaldson |first=Thomas Eugene|editor= Vyas, R. T.|title=Studies in Jaina art and iconography and allied subjects|year=1995|publisher=The Director, Oriental Institute on behalf of  Registar, MS, University of Baroda|isbn=978-81-7017-316-8|pages=163–7|chapter=The Cult of Parasurama and its Popularity in Orrisa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar accounts of the abduction of the celestial cow or her calf, the killing of Jamadagni by Kartavirya Arjuna, and the revenge of Parashurama resulting in the death of Kartavirya Arjuna, exist in other texts. The ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' mentions that the king abducted Kamadhenu as well as her calf and Parashurama defeated the king and returned the kine to his father.&lt;ref name="vyas"/&gt; The ''[[Padma Purana]]'' mentions that when Kartavirya Arjuna tried to capture her, Kamadhenu, by her own power, defeated him and his army and flew off to heaven; the enraged king then killed Jamadagni.&lt;ref name="vyas"/&gt;

In the ''[[Brahmanda Purana]]'', Kamadhenu creates a great city by her power to accommodate Kartavirya Arjuna's army, when they visit Jamadagni's hermitage. On returning to his kingdom, Kartavirya Arjuna's minister, Chandragupta, persuades him to capture the divine cow. The minister returns to the hermitage and tries to convince the sage to give away the cow, but to no avail, so he tries to snatch Kamadhenu with force. In the ensuing fight, the sage is killed, but Kamadhenu escapes to the sky and Chandragupta takes her calf with him instead.&lt;ref name="vyas"/&gt; The Brahmanda Purana narrates this Kamadhenu Sushila was given to Jamadagni by the Kamadhenu-Surabhi, who governs in [[Goloka]].&lt;ref name = "kamadhenu"/&gt;

The ''[[Brahma Vaivarta Purana]]'' narrates that the celestial cow – called Kapila here – produces various weapons and an army to aid Jamadagni defeat the king's army, who had come to seize her. When the king himself challenged Jamadagni for battle, Kapila instructed her master in martial arts. Jamadagni led the army created by Kapila and defeated the king and his army several times; each time sparing the life of the king. Finally, with the aid of a divine spear granted to him by the god [[Dattatreya]], the king killed Jamadagni.&lt;ref name="vyas"/&gt;

===Vashista's cow===

The ''[[Ramayana]]'' presents a similar account about Kamadhenu, however, here the sage is [[Vashista]] and the king is [[Vishwamitra]]. Once, king Vishwamitra with his army arrived at the hermitage of sage Vashista. The sage welcomed him and offered a huge banquet – to the army – that was produced by Sabala – as Kamadhenu is called in the text. The astonished king asked the sage to part with Sabala and instead offered thousand of ordinary cows, elephants, horses and jewels in return. However, the sage refused to part with Sabala, who was necessary for the performance of the sacred rituals and charity by the sage. Agitated, Vishwamitra seized Sabala by force, but she returned to her master, fighting the king's men. She hinted Vashista to order her to destroy the king's army and the sage followed her wish. Intensely, she produced [[Pahlava]] warriors, who were slain by Vishwamita's army. So she produced warriors of [[Shakya|Shaka]]-[[Yavana]] lineage. From her mouth, emerged the [[Kambojas|Kambhoja]]s, from her [[udder]] [[Barvara]]s, from her hind Yavanas and Shakas, and from pores on her skin, [[Harita]]s, [[Kirata]]s and other foreign warriors. Together, the army of Sabala killed Vishwamitra's army and all his sons. This event led to a great rivalry between Vashista and Vishwamitra, who renounced his kingdom and became a great sage to defeat Vashista.&lt;ref name="ramayana"&gt;{{cite book|first=Swami Venkatesananda|title=The concise Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki|year=1988|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-88706-862-1|pages=31–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abodes==
Kamadhenu-Surabhi's residence varies depending on different scriptures. The ''Anushasana Parva'' of the ''Mahabharata'' tells how she was given the ownership of [[Goloka]], the cow-heaven located above the three worlds (heaven, earth and netherworld): the daughter of Daksha, Surabhi went to [[Mount Kailash]] and worshipped Brahma for 10,000 years. The pleased god conferred goddess-hood on the cow and decreed that all people would worship her and her children – cows. He also gave her a world called Goloka, while her daughters would reside on earth among humans.&lt;ref name = "kamadhenu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hastings"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ganguli|first=Kisari Mohan |title=The Mahabharata: Book 13: Anusasana Parva|chapter-url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m13/m13b048.htm|date=1883–1896|publisher=Sacred texts archive|chapter= SECTION LXXXIII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one instance in the ''Ramayana'', Surabhi is described to live in the city of [[Varuna]] – the Lord of oceans – which is situated below the earth in [[Patala]] (the netherworld).

Apart from Goloka and Patala, Kamadhenu is also described as residing in the hermitages of the sages Jamadagni and Vashista. Scholar Mani explains the contradicting stories of Kamadhenu's birth and presence in the processions of many gods and sages by stating that while there could be more than one Kamadhenu, all of them are incarnations of the original Kamadhenu, the mother of cows.&lt;ref name = "kamadhenu"/&gt;

[[File:Kamadhenu parijata.jpg|thumb|Kamadhenu with a sage]]
The ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', a discourse by the god Krishna in the ''Mahabharata'', twice refers to Kamadhenu as ''Kamadhuk''. In verse 3.10, Krishna makes a reference to Kamadhuk while conveying that for doing one's duty, one would get the milk of one's desires. In verse 10.28, when Krishna declares to the source of the universe, he proclaims that among cows, he is Kamadhuk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Radhakrishan|first=S.|authorlink=Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|title=The Bhagavadgita|year=1977|publisher=Blackie &amp; Son (India) Ltd.|pages=135, 264|chapter=Verses 3.10, 10.28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Anushasana Parva'' of the ''Mahabharata'', the god [[Shiva]] is described as having cast a curse on Surabhi. This curse is interpreted as a reference to the following legend:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ganguli|first=Kisari Mohan |title=The Mahabharata: Book 13: Anusasana Parva|chapter-url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m13/m13a017.htm|date=1883–1896|publisher=Sacred texts archive|chapter=SECTION XVII}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once, when the gods Brahma and Vishnu were fighting over who was superior, a fiery pillar—[[linga]] (symbol of Shiva)—emerged before them. It was that decided whoever found the end of this pillar was superior. Brahma flew to the skies to try to find the top of the pillar, but failed. So Brahma forced Surabhi (in some versions, Surabhi instead suggested that Brahma should lie) to falsely testify to Vishnu that Brahma had seen the top of the linga; Shiva punished Surabhi by putting a curse on her so that her bovine offspring would have to eat unholy substances. This tale appears in the ''[[Skanda Purana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jha |first=D. N.|title=The Myth of the Holy Cow|year=2004|publisher=Verso Books|isbn=978-1-85984-424-3|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worship==
Some temples and houses have images of Kamadhenu, which are worshipped.&lt;ref name = "monier"/&gt; However, she has never had a worship cult dedicated to her and does not have any temples where she is worshipped as the chief deity.&lt;ref name = "monier"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first= David Gordon|title=Kiss of the yoginī: "Tantric Sex" in its South Asian contexts|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2003|page = 54|isbn=978-0-226-89483-6|chapter = Surabhi, The Mother of Cows}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Monier-Williams]]'s words: "It is rather the living animal [the cow] which is the perpetual object of adoration".&lt;ref name = "monier"&gt;{{cite book|last=Monier-Williams|first=Monier|authorlink=Monier Monier-Williams|title=Brahmanism and Hinduism:Religious Thought and Life in India|url=https://archive.org/stream/brahmanismhindu00moniuoft#page/n337/mode/2up|year=1887|publisher=London Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cows are often fed outside temples and worshipped regularly on all Fridays and on special occasions.

'''Kuragala'''  ({{lang-si|'''කූරගල''' }}) is a pre-historic archaeological site with ruins of ancient Buddhist [[Architecture of ancient Sri Lanka#Cave temples|Cave temple]] complex, dating back to the 2nd century BC, in [[Balangoda]], [[Sri Lanka]]. The temple complex is located on the Balangoda - [[Kaltota]] road (B38) approximately {{convert|24|km|mi|abbr=on}} distance from the [[Balangoda]] town. The site has been formally recognised by the [[Government of Sri Lanka|Government]] as an [[List of Archaeological Protected Monuments in Sri Lanka|archaeological reserve in Sri Lanka]]. Kuragala is considered as the oldest archaeological site found in the Intermediate Zone.&lt;ref name="isl2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=103652| title=Kuragala recognised the oldest archaeological site in Intermediate Zone| quote=|newspaper=[[The Island (Sri Lanka)]]|publisher=[[Upali Newspapers]] |last= |first=| date= 20 May 2014 | accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Pre-historic evidences===
According to the archaeological evidences found, Kuragala area had been used by humans belonging to the [[Prehistory of Sri Lanka|pre-historic period]].&lt;ref name="isl"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=133966| title=PM promises to conserve Kuragala site without allowing it to become communal issue| quote=|newspaper=[[The Island (Sri Lanka)]]|publisher=[[Upali Newspapers]] |last= |first=| date= 22 October 2015 | accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the excavations, archaeologists found stone tools, fossilized bone fragments and remains of a human skeleton which is believed to be aged more than 8,000 years.&lt;ref name="gnp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.lk/article/487247/Govt--to-conduct-archaeological-fact-finding-mission-in-Kuragala| title=Govt. to conduct archaeological fact-finding mission in Kuragala| quote=|newspaper=[[Daily FT]]|publisher=[[Wijeya Newspapers]] |last= |first=| date= 23 October 2015 | accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations further revealed that the humans lived in Kuragala may had close links with the coastal areas as it found the remnants of [[seashell]]s and [[Bivalve shell|shells of clams]].&lt;ref name="gnp"/&gt; Recent studies done in the Kuragala Kaltota Diyawinna area have revealed that beside the hunting, they had also engaged in agricultural activities as well.&lt;ref name="nf"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://newsfirst.lk/english/2014/04/startling-new-evidence-pre-historic-man-found-kuragala-video/29786| title=Startling new evidence on pre-historic man found in Kuragala (Video)| quote=|publisher=[[News First]] |last= |first=| date=10 April 2014 | accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist monastery===
[[Image:Kuragala Ancient Buddhist Monastery 1.jpg|thumb|left|Kuragala inscription (No. 1). Written in early Brahmin scripts and old [[Sinhala language]], it is belonged to the 2-1 centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;JRASCB XXXII:167; ASCAR 1961-62:82; Paranavitana 1970:774-776&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The extensive investigations, carried out by the [[Department of Archaeology (Sri Lanka)|archaeological department]] at the Kuragala, uncovered evidences that the caves at the site were using as a Buddhist monastery during the period between 3rd century BC and first century AD.&lt;ref name="gnp"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.news.lk/news/sri-lanka/item/6952-don-t-create-religious-issues-based-on-kuragala-dg-of-archaeology| title='Don't create religious issues based on Kuragala' - DG of Archaeology| quote=|publisher=The Official Government News Portal of Sri Lanka |last= |first=| date= | accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sl1"/&gt; An archaeological report on Kuragala area, published by C.H. Collins in 1932, documents about the two cave shelters and 2nd century BC [[Brahmi script#Sri Lankan inscriptions|Brahmi inscriptions]] as well as about the carved stone lintels, stairways and platforms, located at the foot of the Kuragala brae (Budugala area). From eye copies, C. H Collins published his interpretations of Kuragala inscriptions in ''JRASCB, XXXII, 1932''. These inscriptions were reread, and republished in ''Inscriptions of Ceylon Vol. I'' by the archaeological department.&lt;ref name="nat"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nation.lk/epaper/sunday/2013/08/04/files/assets/basic-html/page10.html| title=What Paranavitana said to McGilvray: ‘Do your homework son’| quote=|newspaper=[[The Nation (Sri Lanka)]]|publisher=Rivira Media Corporation (Pvt) Ltd |last= |first=| date=4 August 2013 | accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researches done by Sri Lankan archaeologists and epigraphers have established that, inscribed cave shelters were made for Buddhist monks by donors as religious donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Islam, Sufism and Everyday Politics of Belonging in South Asia (edited by Deepra Dandekar and Torsten Tschacher)|quote=However, research by Sri Lankan archaeologists and epigraphers establishes that such inscribed caveshelters were intended by their donors as religious gifts to support the monkhood in Sri Lanka, providing shelter during the annual rainy season (vassa) retreat as prescribed in Theravada Buddhist tradition (Paranavitana 1970; Dias 2001: 14–18)|first=Dennis B. |last= McGilvray|date=2016 |isbn=9781317435969|publisher =Taylor &amp; Francis|page=67|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caves provide shelter to them during the annual rainy season retreat as prescribed in [[Theravada]] Buddhist tradition. Existence of dripledged caves in a site indicate that they were inhabited by [[Bhikkhu]]s during the past period and epigraphs further reveal the names of donors who donate the prepared caves to them. 

At the summit of the Kuragala is a brick built [[Stupa]] which is now an archaeologically protected monument. The Stupa is considered belongs to the tradition of ''Akasa Chaithya'' which type of Stupa were built since 7th century CE to serve as communication beacons giving directions.&lt;ref name="tn2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nation.lk/online/2015/06/06/i-had-no-intention-of-resolving-any-conflict-at-kuragala.html| title=“I had no intention of resolving any conflict at Kuragala” Prof. Raj Somadeva says| quote=|newspaper=[[The Nation (Sri Lanka)]]|publisher=Rivira Media Corporation (Pvt) Ltd |last= |first=| date=6 June 2015| accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present Stupa has been restored on the location where the residue of ancient Stupa was identified. However some allege that the Stupa at Kuragala is a modern construction, built using local bricks and [[Kankesanthurai]] cement, and the construction was stopped half as Jailani trustees obtain a cabinet order.{{sfn |Ahmad, Reifeld |2004| p=287}}

===Muslim shrine===
It was lead to tensions after Muslims started to claim the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lankaweb.com/news/items/2016/08/23/icc-destroying-shrines-is-a-war-crime-sinhala-buddhists-must-showcase-the-war-crimes-committed-by-ltte-tna-muslim-fundamentalists/|title=LankaWeb – ICC: Destroying shrines is a war crime – Sinhala Buddhists must showcase the war crimes committed by LTTE-TNA &amp; Muslim fundamentalists|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the end of 19th century the site was claimed to be occupied by the Muslim people and said to be maintained as a [[Sufism|Sufi shrine]] named Daftar Jailani rock cave mosque by Muslims. According to the alleged local Muslim's believes a Sufi saint called [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani|Sheikh Muhiyadeen Abdul Qadir Jilani]] (d. 1166 CE, buried in [[Baghdad]]) have stayed in this place for 12 years after paying his respects to [[Adam's Peak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2013/06/02/kuragala-buddhist-sacred-site-or-sufi-shrine/|title=Kuragala: Buddhist Sacred Site Or Sufi Shrine? {{!}} The Sunday Leader|website=www.thesundayleader.lk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sl1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2015/05/31/kuragala-controversy-deepens/| title=Kuragala Controversy Deepens| quote=|newspaper=[[The Sunday Leader]]|publisher=[[Leader Publications]] |last= |first=| date=31 May 2015| accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the shrine itself preserves no physical trace of the saint&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Islam, Sufism and Everyday Politics of Belonging in South Asia (edited by Deepra Dandekar and Torsten Tschacher)|quote=The shrine itself preserves no physical trace of the saint; it is instead a hermitage site where his annual kandoori death anniversary festival (Tamil, kantūri, equivalent of ‘urs) is celebrated|first=Dennis B. |last= McGilvray|date=2016 |isbn=9781317435969|publisher =Taylor &amp; Francis|page=63|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, an inscription written in Arabic language has been said to be found in the site which has not yet accepted to be historical by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lankaweb.com/news/items/2013/04/10/kuragala-buddhist-heritage-and-archaeological-sites-must-be-reinstated/|title=LankaWeb – Kuragala Buddhist Heritage and Archaeological Sites Must be Reinstated|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a self-published book by the late chief trustee of Jailani, M.L.M.

The '''''Narada Bhakti Sutra''''' ([[IAST]]: {{IAST|Nārada Bhakti Sūtra}}) is a well known [[sutra]] venerated within the traditions of [[Hinduism]],  reportedly spoken by the famous [[rishi|sage]], [[Narada]]. The text details the process of devotion ([[Bhakti]]), or [[Bhakti yoga]] and is thus of particular importance to many of the [[Bhakti movements]] within Hinduism.  It has received particular attention among the [[Vaishnava]] traditions.

[[Sanskrit]] scriptures often appear in variant editions which may show differences in organization and verse numbering. For example in the translation by [[Swami Prabhavananda]] there are eighty-four verses arranged in nine chapters,&lt;ref&gt;Swami Prabhavananda.  ''Narada's Way of Divine Love (Narada Bhakti Sutras)''. (Sri Ramakrishna Math: Madras). Provides Sanskrit text translated into English with a commentary by Swami Prabhavananda. {{ISBN|81-7120-506-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in the [[Bhaktivedanta Book Trust]] translation by [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] and his disciple Satsvarupa dasa the eighty-four verses are organised into five chapters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://naradabhaktisutra.com/en1 ''Narada Bhakti Sutra'' Online (complete)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628012651/http://naradabhaktisutra.com/en1 |date=June 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As organized by Swami Prabhavananda, the text covers the following subjects:

*Chapter 1 (verses 1-6) provides a definition of bhakti.
*Chapter 2 (verses 7-14) stresses the importance of renunciation and self-surrender.
*Chapter 3 (verses 15-24) provides exemplars of divine love.
*Chapter 4 (verses 25-33) endorses bhakti as the highest goal of human life.
*Chapter 5 (verses 34-42) provides suggestions on how to practice divine love.
*Chapter 6 (verses 43-50) explains the importance of seeking holy company.
*Chapter 7 (verses 51-57) discusses the difference between preparatory and supreme devotion.
*Chapter 8 (verses 58-73) covers the forms of divine love.
*Chapter 9 (verses 74-84) recommends the practice of ethical virtues and worship of God.

In the translation by [[Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] the chapters break at similar points, but with the first four chapters arranged into double the amount of verses:

*Chapter 1 (verses 1-14) The Value of Devotion
*Chapter 2 (verses 15-33) Defining Bhakti
*Chapter 3 (verses 34-50) The Means of Achievement
*Chapter 4 (verses 51-73) Pure and Mixed Devotion
*Chapter 5 (verses 74-84) Attaining Perfection

==Key Concepts==
Within the text Narada explains the perfectional stage of pure devotion; the process to achieve this state; gives quotations from other Vedic personalities on the subject matter; things to avoid when developing bhakti; and finally explains the nature of selfless love and the different forms of attachment to the Supreme person.

===Pure devotion===
[[File:The sage Narada offering respect to Vishnu on Garuda.jpg|thumb|Sage Narada offering respect to Vishnu on [[Garuda]]. ]]
Firstly bhakti itself is defined as being "the most elevated, pure love for God"&lt;ref&gt;[http://naradabhaktisutra.com/2/en1 NBS Verse 2]&lt;/ref&gt; which is [[eternity|eternal]] by nature and through following which one obtains perfect peace and immortality (release from [[samsara]]). The symptoms of such devotion are that one no longer has any selfish desires, nor is affected by the dualities of loss or gain for himself being fully content with (and experiencing [[Religious ecstasy|ecstasy]] through) the process of bhakti itself. Narada describes that lust is absent in those who execute bhakti purely because they naturally have no personal desires to fulfill.

The aspirant bhakta is encouraged to renounce "social customs" and "religious rituals" and to focus purely on service to God with exclusive dedication, being indifferent to whatever may stand in the way of such service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://naradabhaktisutra.com/9/en1 NBS Verse 9]&lt;/ref&gt; Activities of social custom and religious rituals that are favorable to devotional service are still promoted but devotional activities are given as "the only means for reaching the perfection of life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://naradabhaktisutra.com/12/en1 NBS Verse 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

The text then goes on to quote [[Vyasa]], [[Garga]] and [[Sandilya]] in terms of their opinions on what is ''bhakti'', giving the opinion that all three are correct but declaring in conclusion that "bhakti consists of offering one's every act to the Supreme Lord and feeling extreme distress in forgetting Him".&lt;ref&gt;[http://naradabhaktisutra.com/19/en1 NBS Verse 19]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gopi]]s (cowherd women) of [[Vrindavan]] are given as an example of devotees who display this form of pure bhakti, but warning is also given about 'false devotion' that imitates this perfectional stage. Narada follows this warning by stating, "Furthermore, the Lord dislikes the proud but is pleased with the humble".&lt;ref&gt;[http://naradabhaktisutra.com/27/en1 NBS Verse 27]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bhakti begets bhakti===
An important point is made in verse 30 in regard to  the relationship between bhakti and knowledge: "But the son of [[Brahma]] [Narada] says that bhakti is its own fruit".&lt;ref&gt;[http://naradabhaktisutra.com/30/en1 NBS Verse 30]&lt;/ref&gt; In his commentary, A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada further describes in regard to  this verse that "bhakti is not dependent on anything else for nourishment"&lt;ref&gt;[http://naradabhaktisutra.com/30/en1 NBS Verse 30 purport]&lt;/ref&gt; being complete in itself, without dependence on the paths of either knowledge or renunciation.

===Obtaining bhakti===
The methods initially described for obtaining bhakti are as follows:

*Giving up worldly pleasures and the close company of others who indulge in such activities
*Worshipping the Supreme Lord ceaselesly
*Hearing and speaking about the Lord's special qualities and activities

However, following these three, the text gives the "grace of great souls" or "a small drop of the Lord's grace"&lt;ref&gt;[http://naradabhaktisutra.com/38/en1 NBS Verse 38]&lt;/ref&gt; as the most important factors in developing true devotion. Saying that such association is so rare and precious that it can only be obtained through the grace of God Himself, thus the instruction is given in verse 42: "Strive, strive only for the association of pure devotees".&lt;ref&gt;[http://naradabhaktisutra.com/42/en1 NBS verse 42]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Items to avoid===
Alongside the acceptance of positive practices in the cultivation bhakti, the text also describes items which should be avoided by the aspiring bhakta. Intimate dealings with others who are against the path of bhakti or who indulge in sinful habits is described as potentially dangerous for one attempting to purify their consciousness: "Material association is the cause of lust, anger, confusion, forgetfulness, loss of intelligence, and total calamity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://naradabhaktisutra.com/44/en1 NBS verse 44]&lt;/ref&gt; It further explains that only one who abandons such material association, serves the sages and becomes selfless in their dealings, renouncing desires for profit or gain, can cross beyond the [[Maya (illusion)|ocean of illusion]]. Even the [[Vedas]] are given as an object to renounce for one for wants to obtain pure and uninterrupted love for God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://naradabhaktisutra.com/49/en1 NBS verse 49]&lt;/ref&gt; In later chapters however an instruction is also given that respect should be shown for all scriptures which promote bhakti (devotion) and an aspirant bhakta should endeavour to follow the instructions of such texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://naradabhaktisutra.com/76/en1 NBS Verse 76]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The nature of pure love===
The text states that the true nature of pure love of God is beyond description, but this does not restrict God from revealing it to those who are qualified. Once this pure love is obtained it says that a person "looks only at the Lord, hears only about Him, speaks only of Him, and thinks only of Him".&lt;ref&gt;[http://naradabhaktisutra.com/55/en1 NBS verse 55]&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary forms of this love are given as stepping stones which bring one to the perfectional stage, with each stage nearer to perfection being better than those preceding it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://naradabhaktisutra.com/57/en1 NBS verse 57]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also stated that perfection is attained much more easily by bhakti than by any other process. The reason is that "bhakti does not depend on any other authority for its validity, being itself the standard of authority. Furthermore, bhakti is the embodiment of peace and supreme ecstasy.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://naradabhaktisutra.com/60/en1 NBS verse 60]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultimate attachment===
In conclusion the sutra gives an instruction to "patiently endure" &lt;ref&gt;[http://naradabhaktisutra.com/77/en1 NBS Verse 77]&lt;/ref&gt; until the perfectional stage of bhakti becomes manifest, whilst cultivating qualities such as [[ahimsa|nonviolence]], [[honesty]], [[cleanliness]], [[compassion]] and [[faith]]. Again it is said that the Lord "reveals Himself to His devotees"&lt;ref&gt;[http://naradabhaktisutra.com/80/en1 NBS Verse 80]&lt;/ref&gt; and that bhakti is the most precious of all possessions.

Next a list of forms of attachment is given, through which a devotee should attain a loving feeling towards God, including :

* attachment to the Lord's qualities
* attachment to His beauty,
* attachment to worshiping Him,
* attachment to remembering Him,
* attachment to serving Him,
* attachment to dealing with Him as a friend,
* attachment to surrendering one's self completely to Him,
* attachment to being absorbed in thoughts of Him,

Finally a number of devotional figures from [[Puranic]] scriptures are quoted as being agreement with the truth of the process given, including:  the [[Four Kumaras]], [[Vyasa]], [[Śuka]], [[Sandilya]], [[Garga]], [[Vishnu]], [[Kaundinya]], [[Sesha]], [[Uddhava]], [[Aruni]], [[Bali]], [[Hanuman]] and [[Vibhishana]].
 
The last verse of the text gives the message that:  "Anyone who trusts these instructions spoken by Narada and is convinced by them will be blessed with devotion and attain the most dear Lord. Yes, he will attain the most dear Lord." &lt;ref&gt;[http://naradabhaktisutra.com/84/en1 NBS verse 84]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neasden''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|iː|z|d|ən}} is an suburban area in northwest [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. It forms part of the [[London Borough of Brent]].

==History==
The area was recorded as ''Neasdun'' in AD 939 and the name is derived from the [[Old English]] ''nēos'' = 'nose' and ''dūn'' = 'hill'. It means 'the nose-shaped hill' referring to a well-defined landmark of this area. In 1750, it was known as ''Needsden'' and the present spelling appeared at a later date.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brent-heritage.co.uk/neasden.htm|title=Neasden, area in the London Borough of Brent|website=www.brent-heritage.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neasden was a countryside hamlet on the western end of the [[Dollis Hill]] ridge. The land was owned by [[St. Paul's Cathedral]]. In medieval times, the village consisted only of several small buildings around the green near the site of the present Neasden roundabout.

In the 15th–17th century the Roberts family were the major landowners in the area. Thomas Roberts erected Neasden House (on the site of the modern Clifford Court) in the reign of Henry VIII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://212.85.23.227/Heritage.nsf/24878f4b00d4f0f68025663c006c7944/8c28e2ce1fbd853280256b2100378344/$FILE/Neasden.PDF|title=Wayback Machine|website=web.archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1651 Sir [[William Roberts (parliamentarian)|William Roberts]] bought confiscated church lands. After the Restoration the estates were returned to the ownership of the Church but were leased out to the Roberts family. Sir William improved Neasden House and by 1664 it was one of the largest houses in the Willesden parish.

During the 18th century the Nicoll family replaced the Roberts as the dominant family in Neasden. In the 19th century these farmers and moneyers at the Royal Mint wholly owned Neasden House and much of the land in the area.

Neasden was no more than a ‘retired hamlet’ when enclosure was completed in 1823. At this time there were six cottages, four larger houses or farms, a public house and a [[forge|smithy]], grouped around the green. The dwellings include The Grove, which had been bought by a London solicitor named James Hall, and its former outbuilding, which Hall had converted into a house that became known as The Grange.&lt;ref name="Hidden London"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hidden-london.com/neasden.html|title=Neasden - Hidden London|website=www.hidden-london.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:London Temple.jpg|thumb|Neasden Temple]]
The [[Brent Reservoir|Welsh Harp reservoir]] was completed in 1835 and breached in 1841 with fatalities. It had a dramatic effect on the landscape as the damming of the [[River Brent]] put many fields and meadows underwater.

In the early 1850s, Neasden had a population of about 110. In the Victorian times the horse was the main form of transport, and as London grew, the demand for horses in the capital soared in the second half of the 19th century. Neasden farms concentrated on rearing and providing horses for the city. Town work was exhausting and unhealthy for the horses, and in 1886 the [[RSPCA]] formed a committee to set up the Home of Rest for Horses with grounds in Sudbury and Neasden, where for a small fee town horses were allowed to graze in the open for a few weeks.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

The urbanisation of Neasden began with the arrival of the railway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brent.gov.uk/planning.nsf/0/ac3a63699612b4c980256bb40055d4e4!OpenDocument|title=Planning and building control - Brent Council|website=www.brent.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first railway running through Neasden&amp;nbsp;— Hendon-Acton and Bedford&amp;nbsp;— St. Pancras was opened for goods traffic in October 1868, with passenger services following soon. In 1875, Dudding Hill, the first station in the area, was opened, and the [[Metropolitan Railway]] was extended through Neasden shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infotransport.co.uk/trains/station/199 Neasden Station&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neasden tube station|Neasden station]] was opened on Neasden Lane in 1880. New housing, initially for railway workers, was  built in the village (particularly around Village Way) with all the streets named after Metropolitan Railway stations in Buckinghamshire.

In 1883, an Anglican mission chapel, St Saviour's, was set up in the village. Its priest, the Reverend James Mills, became an important and popular figure in late 19th century Neasden. In 1885 Mills took over St Andrew's, Kingsbury and became vicar of a new parish, Neasden-cum-Kingsbury, created because of the area's rising population.

Before Mill's arrival, the only sporting facilities in Neasden had been two packs of foxhounds, both of which had disbanded by 1857. Mills became founder president of Neasden Cricket Club and encouraged musical societies. In 1893 a golf club was founded at Neasden House, however only 10% of its members came from Neasden.

In the 1890s change led to a conscious effort to create a village atmosphere. At this time, the Spotted Dog became a social centre for local people. By 1891 Neasden had a population of 930, half of whom lived in the village. Despite the presence of the village in the west, it was the London end that grew fastest.

In 1893 the [[Great Central Railway]] got permission to join up its main line from [[Nottingham]] with the Metropolitan. Trains ran on or alongside the Metropolitan track to a terminus at [[Marylebone]] (this is now the modern day [[Chiltern Main Line]]). The Great Central set up a depot south of the line at Neasden and built houses for its workers (Gresham and Woodheyes roads). The Great Central village was a "singularly isolated and self-contained community" with its own school and single shop, Branch No. 1 of the North West London [[Co-operative Society]]. It is now part of a conservation area. There was considerable sporting rivalry between the two railway estates and a football match was played every [[Good Friday]]. By the 1930s the two railways employed over 1000 men.

[[Neasden Hospital]] was built in 1894 and closed in 1986.

Apart from the railways, Neasden was dominated by agriculture until just before the [[World War I|First World War]]. In 1911, Neasden's population had swelled to 2,074. By 1913, light industry at Church End had spread up Neasden Lane as far as the station.

In the 1920s, the building of the [[A406 road|North Circular Road]], a main arterial route round London, brought another wave of development; it opened in 1922–23. The 1924–25 British Empire Exhibition led to road improvements and the introduction of new bus services. Together with the North Circular Road, it paved the way for a new residential suburb at Neasden. In 1930 Neasden House was part demolished. The last farm in Neasden (covering The Rise, Elm Way and Vicarage Way) was built over in 1935. The Ritz cinema opened in 1935 and Neasden Shopping Parade was opened in 1936, and was considered the most up-to-date in the area. All of Neasden's older houses were demolished during this period, except for The Grange, and the Spotted Dog was rebuilt in mock-Tudor style. Industries sprung up in the south of the area, and by 1949, Neasden's population was over 13,000.

The [[Post Office Research Station]] was located nearby in [[Dollis Hill]]. There the [[Colossus computer|Colossus]] computers, among the world's first, were built in 1943-1944 and underneath it the [[Paddock (war rooms)|Paddock]] wartime cabinet rooms were constructed in 1939.

Neasden Power Station, which was built to provide power for the Metropolitan Railway, was closed and demolished in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ltmcollection.org/photos/themes/theme_sub.html?IXtoptheme=Power+stations&amp;IXrefine=Neasden|title=404 - Page not found - London Transport Museum|first=altcom|last=Support|website=www.ltmcollection.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-war history of Neasden is one of steady decline; local traffic congestion problems necessitated the building of an underpass on the North Circular Road that effectively cut Neasden in half and had a disastrous effect on the shopping centre by making pedestrian access to it difficult. The decline in industry through the 1970s also contributed to the area's decline. But nonetheless Neasden has survived, largely due to a succession of vibrant immigrant communities keeping the local economy afloat. Neasden Depot continues to be the main storage and maintenance depot for the [[London Underground]]'s [[Metropolitan line]] (and is also used by trains of the [[Jubilee line]]); it is London Underground's largest depot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metronetrail.com/default.asp?sID=1086172287703|title=Metronet Rail - Having Outstanding Brand|website=Metronet Rail}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such it is a major local employer.

==Recent history==
The Grange Tavern (previously called The Old Spotted Dog) on Neasden Lane was closed in the 1990s and demolished to make way for a block of flats, bringing to an end the inn that had stood there for around two centuries. Another old pub, The Pantiles which stood on the North Circular Road was converted to another McDonald's restaurant. The Swedish furniture retailer, [[IKEA]] opened its second UK outlet in Neasden in 1988.

On 14 July 1993 in an [[MI5]] anti-terrorist operation, a [[Provisional IRA]] man was arrested in his car on Crest Road carrying a 20 lb bomb. It came just over a year after the [[1992 Staples Corner bombing|Staples Corner bombing]] just over 500 yards away, which devastated the junction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bufvc.ac.uk/tvandradio/lbc/index.php/segment/0004000337014|title=IRA bombers foiled by MI5 · British Universities Film &amp; Video Council|website=bufvc.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Neasden became the home of the biggest Hindu temple outside India: the [[Neasden Temple]].

In 2004, the Shopping Centre area was partially redeveloped  by the council in an effort to reverse its fortunes. The Grange, which had housed a museum about the people of Brent was closed by the council in 2005.

The 2004 redevelopment proved to be unpopular with local businesses as it changed the layouts of parking, thus forcing customers and local trade to pass by due to the parking restrictions of the redevelopment.

==Neasden in popular culture==

==="The loneliest village in London"===
Neasden was once nicknamed ‘the loneliest village in London’.&lt;ref name="Hidden London"/&gt;

===Private Eye===
Neasden has achieved considerable notoriety thanks to the British [[satire|satirical]] magazine, ''[[Private Eye]]''. Since early in its history (when the magazine was actually printed in Neasden) the magazine has used Neasden as an exemplar of the suburban environment in pieces parodying current events, personalities, and [[social mores]] (for example, the [[University of Neasden]]). Spoof sports reports in the magazine usually feature the perennially unsuccessful football team, [[Neasden F.C.]] with their manager, "ashen-faced" Ron Knee and their only two supporters, Sid and Doris Bonkers.

===Metro-land===
Neasden was one of the locations in the TV documentary [[Metro-land (TV)]]. In it, Sir [[John Betjeman]] described Neasden as "home of the gnome and the average citizen" (the former a reference to the preponderance of gnome statuettes in suburban front-gardens, but possibly also a nod in the direction of the Eye’s fictional proprietor, Lord Gnome). Background music was provided by [[Willie Rushton|William Rushton]]’s recording of Neasden (1972) ("Neasden/You won’t be sorry that you breezed in").

===BBC Radiophonic Workshop===
In a celebrated spoof of the [[Early Music]] phenomenon which grew enormously in the late 1960s, Neasden was selected by [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]] composer [[David Cain (composer)|David Cain]] as the home of a fictional ensemble dedicated to [[historically-informed performance]]s on authentic musical instruments from an indeterminate number of centuries ago. It was thus that in 1968, listeners to [[BBC Radio 3]] were given a recital by the Schola Polyphonica Neasdeniensis whose members performed on the equally fictional Shagbut, Minikin and Flemish Clackett.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20011105130132/http://www.hnewbury.uklinux.net/music.htm Music matters - Hugh Newbury]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athletico Neasden===
[[Athletico Neasden]] was an amateur football team of mostly Jewish players, which played in the [[Maccabi (sports)|Maccabi]] (Southern) Football League in the 1970s and 1980s and was named after the place, though it did not actually play in the area. The team eventually merged with North West Warriors to form North West Neasden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tffc.co.uk/NewFiles/ripmsflclubs.html|title=Temple Fortune Football Club|website=www.tffc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also&amp;nbsp;— Son of Neasden and Neasden Academicals).

===Literature===
David Sutherland’s children’s novel 'A Black Hole in Neasden' reveals a gateway to another planet in a Neasden back garden. Diana Evans's 2006 novel, ''26a'', details the experiences of twin girls of Nigerian and British descent growing up in Neasden.

===Victorian Order medals===
[[Willie Hamilton]] reported in 'My Queen and I' that the Victorian order medals were made on a production line in Neasden from used railway lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-457-1/dissemination/pdf/vol02/vol02_12/02_12_311_313.pdf|title=Article on The Grange, Neasden|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dread Broadcasting Corporation===
A pirate radio station, [[Dread Broadcasting Corporation]], credited as Britain's first black music radio station,&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/bhm05/years/1980.shtml|title=BBC - 1Xtra - Black History Month - 1980|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; was broadcast from a Neasden garden between 1981 - 1984.

===Dangermouse===
In the episode "Planet of the Machines", Dangermouse and Penfold arrive back in Neasden from the planet in the Baron's space time machine

==BBC Your News==
[[Konnie Huq]] and [[Matt Cooke (journalist)|Matt Cooke]] from [[BBC TV]] present the ''[[Your News]]'' programme from Neasden:[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7641888.stm  ''news.bbc.co.uk'']  (originally broadcast on 27 September 2008).

The '''Northwest District''' is one of the [[Districts of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod|35 districts]] of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS), and encompasses the states of [[Alaska]], [[Idaho]], [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]; one Idaho [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregation]] is in the [[Montana District (LCMS)|Montana District]]. The Northwest District includes approximately 267 congregations and missions, subdivided into 25 [[circuit (LCMS)|circuits]], as well as 93 [[Lutheran school|preschools]], 31 [[Lutheran school|elementary schools]] and 4 [[Lutheran school|high schools]]
. [[Baptism|Baptized]] membership in district congregations is approximately 65,461.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcms.org/page.aspx?pid=456&amp;reid=dpR3uRzuZajbpSW/Rfwcqg==&amp;bbsys=0&amp;bbrt=0|title=Districts Profile Display - The Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod|website=lcms.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northwest District was formed as the Oregon and Washington District in 1899 when the California and Oregon District was divided, also creating the [[California-Nevada-Hawaii District (LCMS)|California and Nevada District]]; the name was changed to the Northwest District in 1948. District offices are located in [[Portland, Oregon]].  The Rev. Paul Linnemann became the district president in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reporter.lcms.org/pages/rpage.asp?NavID=15349|title=Reporter - LCMS News &amp; Information|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Delegates from each congregation meet in convention every three years to elect the district president, vice presidents, circuit counselors, a board of directors, and other officers.  The 62nd Regular Convention was held June 18–20, 2009, in Portland with the theme "The Spirit Gives Live"(2 Cor 3:6).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nowlcms.org/Resources/Conv2009/2009-Pre-NewsletterFINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The 63rd Regular Convention will be held June 21–23, 2012, in Portland with the theme "Walking Toward Oneness" (Eph 4:11-13).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowlcms.org/Events/DistConv2012.aspx|title=Main page|website=www.nowlcms.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ritual Activity==
It is usually observed for 12 days, and during that time the devotee subsists on a diet of milk alone. [http://vedabase.net/sb/8/16/en1]

==In Hindu Mythology==
A notable event is that of [[Wise old man|Sage]] [[Kashyap]] who asked his wife, [[Aditi]], to use this method to please [[Lord Narayana]] so that a solution could be found for her son who was defeated by the [[Asura]]s. This [[penance]] finally resulted in the [[Vamana]] [[Avatar]] sending [[Mahabali]] to the netherworld. [http://vedabase.net/sb/8/16/en1]

Each '''Piri''' is a [[Sikh]] missionary seat, founded by 3rd Sikh [[Guru Amar Das]] ji and significantly expanded by 7th Sikh [[Guru Har Rai]], for teaching [[Sikh]] religion to women, training and maintaining saint-soldiers . A similar [[Sikh Manji|Manji]] system is for the spread of [[Sikhism]] among men.

==Meaning of ''Piri''==
A ''Piri'' is a very small wooden cot (taken as the ''seat of authority'' in this context) from which the [[Sikh]] ''Piri''s (female Sikh preachers, holders of seat of religious authority) would teach [[Sikhism]] to other women. The word [[Sikh Manji|Manji]] also means a wooden cot, similarly used to denote ''seat of sikh religious authority'' for preaching [[Sikhism]] to men.

==Founding of Pirii system by Guru Amar Das==
[[Guru Amar Das]] started the ''Piri'' and [[Sikh Manji|Manji]] systems by appointing 94 men as ''Manji'' and 52 women as [[Piri]]s for the spread of [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref name="Piri system at Sikh Wiki"&gt;[http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Piri_System Piri system]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Masand system==
[[Sikh Gurus]] had [[Masand]] system of Sikh representatives who taught and spread the teachings of the Sikh Gurus and also collect monetary offering to maintain armed legion of saint-soldier. Over time, this system became corrupted.

==Spread of Piri system by Guru Har Rai Ji==
[[Guru Har Rai]] Ji faced some serious difficulties during the period of his guruship. The corrupt [[Masand]]s, Dhir Mal and [[Mina (Sikhism)|Minas]] always tried to preclude the advancement of the Sikh religion.

Earlier, ''Piri'' system was founded by [[Guru Amar Das]] ji. To reform the corrupted [[Masand]] system, [[Guru Har Rai]] Ji expanded the Piri system by establishing additional Female Sikh 'missionary' seats called ''Piri''s after the small cot (''manji'') used by the Guru's representatives. He also tried to improve the old corrupt [[Masand]] system and appointed pious and committed personalities, such as Suthre Shah, Sahiba, Sangtia, Mian Sahib, Bhagat Bhagwan, Bhagat Mal and Jeet Mal Bhagat (also known as Bairagi), as the heads of Manjis.&lt;ref name="Piri system at Sikh Wiki" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3650">{{Other uses|Qalandar (disambiguation)}}
{{Sufism|Ideas}}{{Islam}}{{Sunni Islam}}
In Pakistan, '''qalandar''' is used as a title for some Sufi saints.&lt;ref&gt;Baldick, Julian (2000) ''Mystical Islam: an introduction to Sufism'' Tauris Parke Paperbacks, London, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nYOh6T-sw9IC&amp;pg=PA66 p. 66], {{ISBN|1-86064-631-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some famous hassan qalandar [[Lal Shahbaz Qalandar]], [[Bu Ali Shah Qalandar]] and [[Shams Ali Qalandar]], [[Ghulam Farid, ]] and  Syed Mehmood Ul Hasan Shah Khaki Qalandar Mastwaar currently in Chakwal Pakistan .&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel, Annemarie (1980) ''Islam in the Indian subcontinent'' E.J. Brill, Leiden, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CoceAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA34 page 34], {{ISBN|90-04-06117-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A Qalandar is a person who has excelled in seeing things and advances stage by stage into the Being. He even rises above the Administrative System and witnesses the core of Oneness in detail and after enjoying the Unity of the Being returns without losing his grades and then reaches back into his humanly status, so much so that his rise and fall becomes one and the same thing for him.. He witnesses part in the whole and sees the whole in the part and, then, after detaching himself from all this, plunges into a state of ecstasy.

The status of a qalandar is even higher than the loved ones because duality remains there even in that state, i.e. one is the loved one and the other is the loving. In qalanderiyat there is no duality.&lt;ref&gt;From {{cite book |author=Khwaja Shamsuddin Azeemi |title=Tazkira Qalandar Baba Aulia |others=Compiled by Ramsha Ahmed Azeemi |publisher=Khwaja Shamsuddin Azeemi Research Society |language=ur |url=http://ksars.org/pdfview.php?pdf=ksars.org/Mobile_Books/Roman%20Urdu/Tazkira%20Qalandar%20baba%20auliya%20roman%20urdu.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Qalandar'' is a title given to a saint who is at a very high level of spirituality. They are different from other saints and have very strong feelings of love for God's creation. Qalandars, among the saints, are those persons who may enjoy freedom from the ties and bounds of time and space. It is claimed that all living things are given in their charge and command, every part of the universe may be at their disposal but these holy people are far above temptation, greed or lust. When people request them they feel duty-bound to listen and rectify the cause of miseries of people because they have been appointed by God for this very purpose.

Qalandars have always spread the message of love and humanity, they are always in the state of ecstasy and their actions are with the will of God. They are ''Wali Allah''. Among contemporary people who hold the title of qalandar are [[Shams Ali Qalandar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teachings of sufism/tasawuf by Shams Ali Qalandar|url=http://shamsaliqalandar.blogspot.com/|website=Shams Ali Qalandar}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Punjab, Pakistan, [[Shahbaz Qalander]], [[Nathar Vali]], and [[Baba Fakruddin]]. And currently Mastwaar Qalandar Syed Mehmood ul Hasan Shah Khaki in Makhdoom Pur, Chakwal, Punjab, Pakistan.

He mentions that "In the last 2000-3000 years, different religious traditions, including Buddhism, Jainism, flourished here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/south/india-is-a-model-for-religious-harmony-dalai-lama-297094 |title=India is a model for religious harmony: Dalai Lama |publisher=NDTV.com |date=2012-11-25 |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical Tradition==
The ancient Indian scripture [[Rigveda]] endeavors plurality of religious thought with its mention "''ekaM sadvipraa bahudhaa vadanti ''" ([[Sanskrit]]: ''एकं सद्विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति'')– meaning wise people explain the same truth in different manners.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rigveda]] 1.64.46&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ashoka]] (304–232 BCE), in his 12th edict stated:&lt;ref&gt;Edicts of Ashoka, Trans. Ven. Dhammika,  http://www.livius.org/sh-si/shahbazgarhi/shahbazgarhi2.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The beloved of the gods, king Piyadasi, honors both ascetics and the householders of all religions, and he honors them with gifts and honors of various kinds. . Whoever praises his own religion, due to excessive devotion, and condemns others with the thought "Let me glorify my own religion," only harms his own religion. Therefore contact between religions is good. One should listen to and respect the doctrines professed by others. The beloved of the gods, king Piyadasi, desires that all should be well-learned in the good doctrines of other religions. "&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Kharavela]] (193 BCE – after 170 BCE) was the third and greatest emperor of the Mahameghavahana dynasty of Kaḷinga (present-day Odisha). The main source of information about Khārabeḷa is his famous seventeen line rock-cut Hātigumphā inscription in a cave in the Udayagiri hills near Bhubaneswar, Odisha.The inscription states that the Emperor Kharavela had a liberal religious spirit. Kharavela describes himself as:&lt;ref&gt;Agrawal, Sadananda (2000): Śrī Khāravela, Sri Digambar Jain Samaj, Cuttack, Orissa&lt;/ref&gt;
“ सव पासंड पूजको सवदेवायतन संकार कारको ” ([[Prakrit language]], [[Devanagari script]])
Translation: The worshiper of all religious orders, the restorer of shrines of all gods.

The [[Grahapati Kokkala inscription]] dated to 1000-1001 CE equates&lt;ref&gt;Khajuraho, Kanhiayalal Agrawal, The McMillan Company of India, 1980, p. 141-146&lt;/ref&gt; 
in Verse 3 equates Shiva with Parama Brahma, Buddha, Vaman and Jina.

===Dharmasthala Temple===
{{Main|Dharmasthala Temple}}
Dharmasthala Temple is a great example of religious harmony in India, as the priests of the temple are Shivalli Brahmins, who are Vaishnava, and the administration is run by a [[Jain Bunt]] family.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dharmasthala Temple]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efforts==
The late 19th century and early 20th century Indian [[guru]] and [[yogi]] [[Sai Baba of Shirdi]] preached religious harmony through his teaching. To practise and promote it he combined the celebration of the Hindu festival of [[Rama Navami]] with a Muslim [[Urs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zAfRoIQV97MC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=religious+harmony+sai+baba&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Od6-UeqTHsamrQfSj4CoDg&amp;ved=0CEMQuwUwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=religious%20harmony%20sai%20baba&amp;f=false | title=Islam Means Peace: Understanding the Muslim Principle of Nonviolence Today | publisher=ABC-CLIO | author=Pal, Amitabh | year=2011 | page=71 | isbn=0313382913 |accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o6pPD-gz7IQC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=religious+harmony+sai+baba&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Od6-UeqTHsamrQfSj4CoDg&amp;ved=0CFcQuwUwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=religious%20harmony%20sai%20baba&amp;f=false | title=Spiritual Masters: Sai Baba | publisher=Indus Source | author=Desai, Sonavi | year=2003 | page=52 | isbn=8187967641 |accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lokmanya Tilak]] Organised the programmes like [[Ganesh Chaturthi]] and Shivjayanti to preach Religious Harmony among the people.

'''Sabbatai Zevi''' ({{Lang-he-n|שַׁבְּתַי צְבִי}}, other spellings include '''Shabbetai Ẓevi''', '''Shabbeṯāy Ṣeḇī''', '''Shabsai Tzvi''', and ''Sabetay Sevi'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]) (August 1, 1626 – c. September 17, 1676&lt;ref&gt;Scholem, ''Sabbatai Sevi: The Mystical Messiah: 1626–1676'', pp. 103–106 has a whole discussion of the historical probabilities that he was really born on the 9th of Av, which according to Jewish tradition is the date of the destruction of both Temples and is also the date 'prescribed' in some traditions for the birth of the Messiah.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic ordained rabbi]], though of [[Romaniote Jews|Romaniote origin]]&lt;ref&gt;Scholem, ''op. cit.'', p. 111, mentions, among other evidence of Sabbatai's early rabbinic training and ''smicha'' by Rabbi Joseph Eskapha of his native town of Smyrna: "According to the testimony of Leib b. Ozer, the notary of the notary of the Ashkenazi community of Amesterdam ..., Sabbatai was eighteen years old when he was ordained a ''hakham''." Scholem also writes, in the previous sentence: "Thomas Coenen, the Protestant minister serving the Dutch congregation in Smyrna, tells us ... that he received the title ''hakham'', the Sephardi honorific for a rabbi, when still an adolescent."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldish, M. Jewish Questions: Responsa on Sephardic Life in the Early Modern Period, esp. p. Introduction XXXI, 2008 (The author describes him as a Romaniote Jew)&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Kabbalah|kabbalist]], active throughout the [[Ottoman Empire]], who claimed to be the long-awaited [[Jewish Messiah]]. He was the founder of the [[Sabbateans|Sabbatean]] movement.

In February 1666, upon arriving in [[Constantinople]], Sabbatai was imprisoned on the order of the [[grand vizier]] [[Ahmed Köprülü]]; in September of that same year, after being moved from different prisons around the capital to [[Adrianople]] (the imperial court's seat) for judgement on accusations of fomenting [[sedition]], Sabbatai was given by Köprülü, in the name of the [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] [[Mehmed IV]], the choice of either facing death by some type of ordeal, or of converting to [[Islam]]. Sabbatai seems to have chosen the latter by donning from then on a Turkish [[turban]]. He was then also rewarded by the heads of the Ottoman state with a generous pension for his compliance with their political and religious plans.&lt;ref&gt;Scholem, ''op cit.'', pp. 678–681; Scholem, Gershom. "Shabbetai Zevi." Encyclopaedia Judaica, pp. 348–350&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his followers also converted to Islam—about 300 families who were known as the [[Dönmeh]] (converts).&lt;ref name="tnr.com"&gt;[http://www.tnr.com/book/review/the-other-secret-jews Adam Kirsch, "The Other Secret Jews", review of Marc David Baer, ''The Dönme: Jewish Converts, Muslim Revolutionaries, and Secular Turks''], ''The New Republic'', 15 Feb 2010, accessed 20 Feb 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He was later banished twice by the Ottoman authorities who were tired of his schemes and discovered him singing [[psalms]] with the Jews.&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt; He later died in isolation.&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Sabbatai Zevi was born in [[İzmir|Smyrna]], [[Ottoman Empire]] (İzmir in present-day Turkey), supposedly on  [[Tisha B'Av]] (the 9th of Av), 1626, the holy day of mourning. His name literally meant the planet [[Saturn]], and in Jewish tradition "The reign of Sabbatai" (The highest planet) was often linked to the advent of the [[Messiah]].&lt;ref&gt;The mixed multitude:Jacob Frank and the Frankist movement, Pawel Maciejko, University of Pennsylvania Press, Mar 8, 2011, Page 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Zevi's family were [[Romaniotes]] from [[Patras]] in present-day [[Greece]]; his father, Mordecai, was a [[poultry]] dealer in the [[Morea]]. During the war between [[Turkey]] and [[Venice]], Smyrna became the center of [[Levant]]ine trade. Mordecai became the Smyrna agent of an English trading house and managed to achieve some wealth in this role.&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=SHABBETHAI ẒEBI B. MORDECAI|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=531&amp;letter=S|author=[[Kaufmann Kohler]] &amp; [[Henry Malter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the prevailing Jewish custom of the time, Sabbatai's father had him study the [[Talmud]]. He attended a ''[[yeshiva]]'' under the rabbi of [[Smyrna]], [[Joseph Escapa]]. Studies in ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) did not appeal to him, but apparently Zevi did attain proficiency in the Talmud. On the other hand, he was fascinated by [[mysticism]] and the [[Kabbalah]], as influenced by [[Isaac Luria]]. He found the practical kabbalah – with its [[ascetic]]ism, through which its devotees claimed to be able to communicate with God and the [[angel]]s, to [[prediction|predict the future]] and to perform all sorts of [[miracle]]s, especially appealing.&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

==Personal history==

===Influence of English millenarianism===
During the first half of the 17th century, [[millenarianism|millenarian]] ideas of the approach of the [[Messiah|Messianic]] time were popular. They included ideas of the [[Redemption (religious)|redemption]] of the Jews and their return to the [[land of Israel]], with independent sovereignty. The [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] year was identified by Christian authors as 1666 and millenarianism was widespread in England. This belief was so prevalent that [[Manasseh ben Israel]], in his letter to [[Oliver Cromwell]] and the [[Rump Parliament]], appealed to it as a reason to readmit Jews into [[England]], saying, "[T]he opinions of many Christians and mine do concur herein, that we both believe that the restoring time of our Nation into their native country is very near at hand."&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=531&amp;letter=S#1742, "SHABBETHAI ẒEBI B. MORDECAI", by Kaufmann Kohler and Henry Malter], ''Jewish Encyclopedia'' (refers to Grätz, "Gesch." x., note 3, pp. xxix. et seq.), accessed 9 Apr 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Besides being involved in other commercial activities, Sabbatai's father was the agent for an English trading house in Smyrna and must have had some business contact with English people. Sabbatai could have learned something about these Western millenarian expectations at his father's house.&lt;ref&gt;This theory was originally suggested by [[Heinrich Graetz|Graetz]]; [[Gershom Scholem]] argued forcefully against it in his major work on Sabbatai quoted throughout this entry.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims of messiahship===
Apart from this general Messianic theory, there was another computation, based on an interpreted passage in the ''[[Zohar]]'' (a famous Jewish mystical text), and particularly popular among the Jews, according to which the year 1648 was to be the year of [[Israelite|Israel's]] redemption by their long-awaited [[Jewish Messiah]].&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

At age 22 in 1648, Sabbatai started declaring to his followers in Smyrna that he was the true Messianic redeemer. In order to prove this claim he started to pronounce the [[Tetragrammaton]], an act which Judaism emphatically prohibited to all but the Jewish [[Kohen Gadol|high priest]] in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] on the [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]]. For scholars acquainted with [[Rabbinic literature|rabbinical]], and kabbalistic literature, the act was highly symbolic. He revealed his Messiahship early on to [[Isaac Silveyra]] and [[Moses Pinheiro]], the latter a brother-in-law of the Italian rabbi and [[Kabbalah|kabbalist]] [[Joseph Ergas]].&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

However, at this point he was still relatively young to be thought of as an  accepted and established rabbinic authority; and his influence in the local community was not widespread. Even though Sabbatai had led the pious life of a mystic in Smyrna for several years, the older and more established rabbinic leadership was still suspicious of his activities. The local college of rabbis, headed by his teacher, [[Joseph Escapa]], kept a watchful eye on him. When his Messianic pretensions became too bold, they put him and his followers under ''[[Herem (censure)|cherem]]'', a type of [[excommunication]] in [[Judaism]].&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

About the year 1651 (according to others, 1654), the rabbis banished Sabbatai and his disciples from Smyrna. It is not certain where he went from there. By 1658, he was in [[Constantinople]], where he met a preacher, [[Abraham Yachini]] (a disciple of [[Joseph di Trani]]), who confirmed Sabbatai's messianic mission. [[Abraham Yachini|Yachini]] is said to have forged a manuscript in archaic characters which, he alleged, bore testimony to Sabbatai's Messiahship.&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt; It was entitled "The Great Wisdom of Solomon", and began:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I, Abraham, was confined in a cave for forty years, and I wondered greatly that the time of miracles did not arrive. Then was heard a voice proclaiming, 'A son will be born in the Hebrew year 5386 &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;the year 1626 CE&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to Mordecai Zevi; and he will be called Shabbethai. He will humble the great dragon; ... he, the true Messiah, will sit upon My throne."&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In Salonica, Cairo, and Jerusalem===
[[File:20121020 exterior of Yeni Mosque Thessaloniki Greece.jpg|thumb|''[[New Mosque (Thessaloniki)|New Mosque]]'', built by Donmeh community of [[Salonica]] during the Ottoman period.]]

With this document, Sabbatai chose [[Salonica]], at that time a center of kabbalists, for his base. He proclaimed himself the Messiah or "anointed one," gaining many adherents. He put on all sorts of mystical events — e.g., the celebration of his marriage as the "One Without End" (the ''[[Ein Sof]]'') with the [[Torah]], preparing a solemn festival to which he invited his friends. The rabbis of Salonica, headed by Rabbi Hiyya Abraham Di Boton, banished him from the city. The sources differ widely as to the route he took after this expulsion, with [[Alexandria]], [[Athens]], [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], [[Jerusalem]], and Smyrna mentioned as temporary centers. After wandering, he settled in [[Cairo]], where he resided for about two years (1660–1662).&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

[[Raphael Joseph Halabi]] ("of [[Aleppo]]") was a wealthy and influential Jew who held the high position of mint-master and [[Tax farming|tax-farmer]] in Cairo under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] government. He led an [[ascetic]] life, which included fasting, bathing in cold water, and [[scourging]] his body at night. He used his great wealth for charity, supporting  poor Talmudists and Kabbalists, fifty of whom reportedly dined at his table regularly. Sabbatai befriended Raphael Joseph, who became a supporter and promoter of his Messianic claims.&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

About 1663 Sabbatai moved on to Jerusalem. Here he resumed his former ascetic practice of frequent fasting and other penances. Many saw this as proof of his extraordinary [[piety]]. He was said to have a good voice, and sang [[psalms]] all night long, or at times [[Spanish language|Spanish]] love-songs, to which he gave mystical interpretations. He attracted crowds of listeners. At other times he prayed and cried at the graves of pious men and women. He distributed [[confectionary|sweetmeats]] to children on the streets. Gradually he gathered a circle of adherents.&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

The important community of Jerusalem at the time was also in need of money to keep up with the heavy taxes imposed on it by the Ottoman government. The community was coming up short of funds to pay these levies, and these arrears could have dire consequences. Sabbatai, known as the favorite of the rich and powerful Raphael Joseph Halabi in the Turkish government center in Cairo, was chosen as the community envoy to appeal to Halabi for money and support. His success in getting the funds to pay off the Turks raised his prestige. His followers  dated his public career from this journey to Cairo.&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

===Marriage to Sarah===
Another event helped spread Sabbatai's fame in the Jewish world of the time in the course of his second stay in Cairo. During the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|Chmielnicki massacres]] in [[Poland]], a Jewish orphan girl named Sarah, about six years old, was found by Christians and sent to a [[convent]] for care. After ten years, she escaped (through a miracle she claimed), and made her way to [[Amsterdam]]. Some years later she went to [[Livorno]] where, according to reports, she led a life of [[prostitution]]. She also conceived the notion that she was to become the bride of the Messiah, who was soon to appear.&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

When the report of Sarah's adventures reached Cairo, Sabbatai claimed that such a consort had been promised to him in a dream because he, as the Messiah, was bound to fall in love with an unchaste woman. He reportedly sent messengers to Livorno to bring Sarah to him, and they were married at Halabi's house. Her beauty and eccentricity reportedly helped him gain new followers. Through her a new romantic and licentious element entered Sabbatai's career. Even the overturning of her past scandalous life was seen by Sabbatai's followers as additional confirmation of his messiahship, following the biblical story of the prophet [[Hosea]], who had also been commanded to take a "wife of whoredom" as the first symbolic act of his calling.&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

===Nathan of Gaza===
{{Main article|Nathan of Gaza}}

With Halabi's financial and political backing, a charming wife, and many additional followers, Sabbatai triumphantly returned to [[Jerusalem]]. Passing through the city of [[Gaza City|Gaza]], which at the time had an important Jewish community, he met Nathan Benjamin Levi, known since as [[Nathan of Gaza]] (נתן עזתי ''Nathan 'Azzati''). Nathan became very active in Sabbatai's subsequent Messianic career, serving as Sabbatai's right-hand man and declaring himself to be the risen [[Elijah]], who, it was predicted, would proclaim the arrival of the Messiah. In 1665, Nathan announced that the Messianic age would begin the following year with the conquest of the world  without bloodshed. The Messiah would lead the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] back to the [[Holy Land]], "riding on a lion with a seven-headed dragon in its jaws".&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

The rabbis of Jerusalem viewed Sabbatai's movement with great suspicion, and threatened its followers with [[excommunication]]. Acknowledging that Jerusalem would not be the best place to enact his plans, Sabbatai left for his native city, Smyrna.  Nathan  proclaimed that henceforth Gaza, and not Jerusalem, would be the sacred city. On his way from Jerusalem to Smyrna, Sabbatai was greeted enthusiastically in [[Aleppo]]. In Smyrna, which he reached in the autumn of 1665, the greatest homage was paid to him. After some hesitation, he publicly declared himself to be the expected Messiah during the [[Rosh Hashanah|Jewish New Year]] in 1665; his declaration was made in the [[synagogue]], with the blowing of [[Shofar|horns]], and shouts of "Long live our King, our Messiah!"&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

His followers began to refer to him with the title AMIRAH, a [[Hebrew]] acronym for the phrase "Our Lord and King, his Majesty be exalted" (''Adoneinu Malkeinu Yarum Hodo'').

===Proclaimed messiah===
[[Image:Shabbatai2.jpg|thumb|left|"Sabbatai Zevi enthroned" (image from the Amsterdam/Jewish publication ''Tikkun'', Amsterdam, 1666).]]

Assisted by his wife, Sabbatai became the leader of the community. He used his power to crush the opposition. He deposed the existing rabbi of Smyrna, [[Aaron Lapapa]], and appointed [[Chaim Benveniste]] in his place. His popularity grew, as people of all faiths repeated his story. His fame extended far and wide.  [[Italy]], [[Germany]], and the [[Netherlands]] had centers of his Messianic movement. The Jews of [[Hamburg]] and [[Amsterdam]] learned of the events in Smyrna from trustworthy Christians. [[Henry Oldenburg]], a distinguished German savant who became the first secretary of the Royal Society, wrote to [[Baruch Spinoza]] (''Spinozae Epistolae'' No 33): "All the world here is talking of a rumour of the return of the Israelites ... to their own country. ... Should the news be confirmed, it may bring about a revolution in all things."&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

Sabbatai's followers included many prominent rabbis, such as  [[Isaac Aboab da Fonseca]], [[Moses Raphael de Aguilar]], [[Moses Galante (the Younger)|Moses Galante]], [[Moses Zacuto]], and the above-mentioned Hayyim Benveniste. [[Benjamin Musaphia|Dionysius Musaphia]], an adherent of Spinoza, likewise became a follower. People spread fantastic reports, which were widely believed. For example, it was said, "In the north of [[Scotland]] a ship had appeared with silken sails and ropes, manned by sailors who spoke [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. The flag bore the inscription 'The Twelve Tribes of Israel'."&lt;ref name="Lukach1914"&gt;{{cite book|last= Lukach|first=Harry Charles|title=The City of Dancing Dervishes and Other Sketches and Studies from the Near East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IglFAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA189|year=1914|publisher=Macmillan and Company|location=London|pages=189–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish community of [[Avignon]], [[France]] prepared to emigrate to the new kingdom in the spring of 1666.&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

The readiness of the Jews to believe the messianic claims of Sabbatai Zevi may largely be explained by the desperate state of European Jewry in the mid-17th century. The bloody pogroms of [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] had wiped out around 100,000 Jews in Eastern Europe,&lt;ref&gt;Sources estimating 100,000 Jews killed:

&lt;/ref&gt; about one third of Europe's Jewish population at the time and destroyed many centers of Jewish learning and communal life. There is no doubt that for most of the Jews of Europe there could not have been a more propitious moment for the messiah to deliver salvation than the moment  Sabbetai Zevi made his appearance.

===Spread of his influence===
{{Main article|Sabbateans}}
Probably with his consent, Sabbatai's adherents planned to abolish many of the [[613 mitzvot|ritualistic observances]] because, according to a minority opinion in the Talmud, in the Messianic time there would no longer be holy obligations.  The fast of the [[Tenth of Tevet]] became a day of feasting and rejoicing.&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt; [[Samuel Primo]], who became Sabbatai's  secretary when the latter went to Smyrna, directed in the name of the Messiah the following circular to all of the Jews:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The first-begotten Son of God, Shabbethai Tebi, Messiah and Redeemer of the people of Israel, to all the sons of Israel, Peace! Since ye have been deemed worthy to behold the great day and the fulfilment of God's word by the Prophets, your lament and sorrow must be changed into joy, and your fasting into merriment; for ye shall weep no more. Rejoice with song and melody, and change the day formerly spent in sadness and sorrow into a day of jubilee, because I have appeared."&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Primo's message was considered blasphemous, as Sabbatai wanted to celebrate his birthday rather than the holy day. There was outrage and dissension in the communities; many of the leaders who had regarded the movement sympathetically were shocked at such radical innovations. [[Solomon Algazi]], a prominent Talmudist of Smyrna, and other members of the rabbinate who opposed the abolition of the fast, narrowly escaped death at the hands of Sabbatai's followers.&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

===In Constantinople===
At the beginning of the year 1666, Sabbatai left Izmir for Constantinople (İstanbul in present-day Turkey).  He may have been forced to flee by city officials. Nathan Ghazzati had prophesied that, once in Constantinople, Sabbatai would place the [[sultan]]'s crown on his own head. The [[grand vizier]], [[Ahmed Köprülü]], ordered Sabbatai's immediate arrest upon his arrival and had him imprisoned, maybe to avoid any doubts among local and foreign observers of the imperial court as to the power still wielded by the Turkish Sultanate and by the Sultan himself.&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

Sabbatai's imprisonment discouraged neither him nor his followers at this  stage. He was treated well in prison, perhaps because of bribes paid. This seems to have strengthened belief within his immediate circle of followers. Fabulous reports concerning the miraculous deeds "the Messiah" was performing in the Turkish capital were spread by Ghazzati, [[Abraham Yachini]], and Primo among the Jews of Smyrna and in many other communities, and the messianic expectations in the Jewish diasporas continued to rise.&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

===At Abydos (''Migdal Oz'')===
After two months' imprisonment in Constantinople, Sabbatai was moved to the state prison at [[Abydos, Hellespont|Abydos]]. Some of his friends were allowed to accompany him. As a result, the Sabbataians called the fortress ''Migdal Oz'' (Tower [of] Strength). As Sabbatai had arrived on the day preceding [[Passover]], he slew a [[Korban Pesach|paschal lamb]] for himself and his followers. He ate it with its fat, a violation of Jewish Law. It is said that he pronounced over it the benediction: "Blessed be God who hath restored again that which was forbidden."&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

The immense sums sent to him by his rich followers, the charms of the queenly Sarah, and the cooperation shown by the Turkish officials and others enabled Sabbatai to display royal splendor in the prison castle of Abydos. Accounts of his life there were exaggerated and spread among Jews in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]]. In some parts of Europe, Jews began to unroof their houses and prepare for a new "exodus". In almost every synagogue, Sabbatai's initials were posted, and prayers for him were inserted in the following form: "Bless our Lord and King, the holy and righteous Sabbatai Zevi, the Messiah of the God of Jacob." In [[Hamburg]], the council introduced the custom of praying for Sabbatai not only on [[Shabbat|Saturday]] (the Jewish Sabbath), but also on Monday and Thursday. Unbelievers were compelled to remain in the synagogue and join in the prayer with a loud ''[[Amen]]''. Sabbatai's picture was printed together with that of [[King David]] in most of the prayer-books, along with his kabbalistic formulas and penances.&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

These and similar innovations caused great commotion in some communities. In [[Moravia]] excitement reached such a pitch that the government had to intervene, while at [[Salé|Sale]], Morocco, the [[emir]] ordered a [[persecution]] of the Jews. During this period  Sabbatai declared the fasts of the [[Seventeenth of Tammuz]] and the [[Ninth of Av]] (his birthday) would henceforth be feast-days. He contemplated converting the [[Day of Atonement]] to one of celebration.&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

===Nehemiah ha-Kohen===
[[File:Shabbatai 3.jpg|thumb|Sabbatai Zevi as a prisoner in Abydos.]]

While Sabbatai was in the Abydos prison an incident occurred which ultimately led to  Sabbatai's  downfall. Two prominent Polish Talmudists from [[Lwów]], [[Lesser Poland]], who were among Sabbatai's visitors in Abydos, informed him that in their native country a prophet, [[Nehemiah ha-Kohen]], had announced the coming of the Messiah. Sabbatai ordered the prophet to appear before him. (See ''Jew. Encyc.'' ix. 212a, s.v. Nehemiah ha-Kohen). Nehemiah obeyed, reaching Abydos after a journey of three months at the beginning of September, 1666. The meeting between the two ended in mutual dissatisfaction. Some Sabbataians are said to have contemplated the secret murder of the rival.&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

===Conversion to Islam===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Sabbateans]] --&gt;
Nehemiah, however, escaped to Constantinople, where he pretended to embrace [[Islam]] to get an audience with the [[kaymakam]]. He told him of Sabbatai's ambitions. The kaymakam informed the [[sultan]], [[Mehmed IV]]. Sabbatai was taken from Abydos to [[Adrianople]],&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt; where the sultan's vizier gave him three choices; subject himself to a trial of his divinity in the form of a volley of arrows (in which should the archers miss, his divinity would be proven); be impaled; or he could convert to Islam.&lt;ref name="Hitchens2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|title=God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm9VdHv0OWEC&amp;pg=PT123|year=2011|publisher=Atlantic Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-85789-715-2|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the following day (September 16, 1666) Zevi came before the sultan, cast off his Jewish garb and put a Turkish [[turban]] on his head. Thus his conversion to Islam was accomplished. The sultan was much pleased, and rewarded Sabbatai by conferring on him the title (Mahmed) ''[[Effendi]]'', and appointing him as his doorkeeper with a generous salary. Sarah and approximately 300 families among Sabbatai's followers also converted to Islam. These new Muslims thereafter were known as [[dönmeh]] (converts).&lt;ref name="tnr.com"/&gt; The sultan's officials ordered Sabbatai to take an additional wife to demonstrate his conversion. Some days after his conversion he wrote to Smyrna: "God has made me an Ishmaelite; He commanded, and it was done. The ninth day of my regeneration."&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

===Disillusion===
[[Image:Shabbatai4.jpg|thumb|left|Former followers of Sabbatai do penance for their support of him.]]

Sabbatai's conversion devastated his followers. Muslims and Christians alike ridiculed his followers after the event. In spite of Sabbatai's [[apostasy]], many of his adherents still clung tenaciously to their belief in him, claiming that his conversion was a part of the Messianic scheme. Prophets such as Ghazzati and Primo, who were interested in maintaining the movement, encouraged such belief. In many communities, the [[Seventeenth of Tammuz]] and the [[Tisha B'Av|Ninth of Av]] were still observed as feast-days in spite of bans and excommunications by the rabbis.&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt;

At times Sabbatai assumed the role of a pious Muslim and reviled Judaism; at others he associated with Jews as one of their own faith. In March, 1668, he announced that he had been filled with the "[[Holy Spirit]]" at [[Passover]], and had received a "revelation." He, or one of his followers, published a mystical work claiming Sabbatai was the true Messiah in spite of his conversion, whose goal was to bring thousands of Muslims to Judaism. He told the sultan, however, that he was trying to convert Jews to Islam. The sultan permitted Sabbatai to associate with other Jews and preach in their synagogues. He succeeded in bringing over a number of Muslims to his kabbalistic views.&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt; Whether through his efforts or their willingness to follow in his latest steps, about 300 families of [[Sephardic Jews]] converted to Islam, becoming known as the ''[[Dönmeh]]'' (also spelled ''Dönme''), convert.&lt;ref name="tnr.com"/&gt; Some of the followers adhered to a combination of their former Jewish practices as well as Islam.

Gradually the Turks tired of Sabbatai's schemes. They ended his doorkeeper's salary and banished him to Constantinople. When he was discovered singing [[psalms]] with Jews, the grand vizier ordered his banishment to Dulcigno (today called [[Ulcinj]]), a small town in present-day [[Montenegro]].&lt;ref name="KohlerMalter1905"/&gt; In August 1676, he wrote to the [[Judaism in Albania|Jewish Community in Berat, Albania]], requesting religious books,&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt; but he died shortly after in isolation, according to some accounts on September 17, 1676, the High Holy Day of [[Yom Kippur]]. His tomb was believed for a long time to have been in [[Berat]], at a ''[[Khanqah|tekke]]'' built in the yard of the "Sultan Mosque" ({{lang-sq|Xhamia e Mbretit}}), where a tomb stood until 1967. Recently, scholars support the theory that he was buried in Dulcigno.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} His biographer [[Gershom Scholem]] mentions that his tomb was visited by Dönme [[pilgrimage|pilgrims]] from Salonika until the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Elsie"&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6inIiCF_930C&amp;pg=PA411&amp;dq=gershom+scholem++Historical+Dictionary+of+Albania&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAGoVChMI-KSclLntyAIVgUEmCh17UgGN#v=onepage&amp;q=gershom%20scholem%20%20Historical%20Dictionary%20of%20Albania&amp;f=false| author=Robert Elsie|page=411|title=Historical Dictionary of Albania| publisher=Scarecrow Press | year= 2010| isbn=9780810861886  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"By the 1680s, the Dönme had congregated in [[Salonica]], the cosmopolitan and majority-Jewish city in Ottoman Greece. For the next 250 years, they would lead an independent communal life — intermarrying, doing business together, maintaining their own shrines, and handing down their secret traditions." By the 19th century, the ''Dönmeh'' had become prominent in the tobacco and textile trades. They established progressive schools and some members became politically active. Some joined the [[Committee of Union and Progress|Committee on Union and Progress]] (CUP), the revolutionary party known as the [[Young Turks]]. With independence, in the 1910s, [[Greece]] expelled the Muslims from its territory, including the ''Dönmeh''. Most migrated to Turkey, where by mid-century they were becoming highly assimilated.&lt;ref name="tnr.com"/&gt;

===Last years===
At the beginning of 1673, the sultan had Zevi exiled to [[Ulcinj]] (''Dulcigno'', {{lang-tr|Ulkum}}).{{sfn|Halperin|2007|p=13}} His wife died there in 1674, after which Zevi married the daughter of rabbi Joseph Filosoff of Thessaloniki.{{sfn|Halperin|2007|p=13}} He died on 17 September 1676.{{sfn|Halperin|2007|p=13}} Upon his death, his widow, brother and children by his first wife moved to Thessaloniki.{{sfn|Halperin|2007|p=13}}

==Modern followers==
{{Main article|Sabbateans|Dönmeh}}
Although rather little is known about them, various groups called [[Dönmeh]] (Turkish for "[[religious conversion|convert]]") continue to follow Sabbatai Zevi today, mostly in [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="Hitchens2011p124"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|title=God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm9VdHv0OWEC&amp;pg=PT124|year=2011|publisher=Atlantic Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-85789-715-2|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the numbers vary. Many sources claim that there are fewer than 100,000 and some of them claim there are several hundred thousand in Turkey.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}  They have been described as presenting themselves as Muslim in public whilst practising their own forms of messianic/mystical Jewish beliefs in private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/Default.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=91139&amp;NewsCatID=386|title=INTERVIEW: Cengiz Şişman on the Dönmes’ 350-year ‘burden of silence’ – BOOKS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dönme eventually split into three sects, each with quite different beliefs, as Ottoman Jewish scholars Abraham Danon, and Joseph Néhama had pointed out in French-language Jewish studies journal articles over 100 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Danon, "Sur Sabbatai Cevi et sa secte," Revue des études Juives 37 (1898): 103-110; Joseph Néhama, "Sabbataï Sevi et les Sabbatéens de Salonique," Revue des Écoles de l'Alliance Israélite 3 (1902): 289-323&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s a new comprehensive study on the history of the sects was also published in French by Abraham Galanté.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Galanté, Nouveaux documents sur Sabbetaï Sevi: Organisation et us et coutumes de ses adeptes (Istanbul : Fratelli Haim, 1935)&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Professor Cengiz Şişman, has published a new study called ''The Burden of Silence''.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Turkish-Jewrys-secret-medieval-messianics-survive-456030|title=Turkish Jewry’s secret medieval messianics survive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a review of his views published in the Israeli newspaper Jerusalem Post, the branch known as Karakaş follow Sufi-influenced practices, while the Kapancıs have not been influenced by Islam at all, and are now completely secular.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"/&gt;

{{Usul al-fiqh}}

'''''Taghut''''' ([[Arabic language|ar]]. طاغوت, ṭāġūt, [[plural|pl]]. ṭawāġīt) is an [[Islamic terminology]] denoting a focus of  worship other than [[Allah]]. In traditional [[Islamic theology|theology]], the term often connotes [[Idolatry|idols]], [[Satan]] and [[jinn]].
The term is also applied to earthly tyrannical power, as implied in [[surah]] [[An-Nisa]] verse 60.&lt;ref name="Jo"&gt;Momen, Moojan. (1995). "Țāghūt". In John L. Esposito. ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern [[Islamic philosopher]] [[Abul A'la Maududi]] defines ''taghut'' in his [[tafsir|Qur'anic commentary]] as a creature who not only rebels against God but transgresses his will.&lt;ref&gt;Mawdudi, 1988, vol.1, pp.199-200&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these associations, the term may refer to any person or group accused of being anti-Islamic and an agent of Western [[cultural imperialism]]. The term was introduced to modern political discourse since the usage surrounding [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]] during the [[1979 Iranian Revolution]], through accusations made both by and against Khomeini.&lt;ref name="Jo" /&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[Arabic language|Arabic word]] ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ṭāġūt}}'' is derived from the [[triliteral|three-letter Arabic verbal root]] of {{lang|ar|ط-غ-ت}} ''[[Teth|T]]-[[Ghayn|G]]-[[Taw|T]]'' which means to "cross the limits, overstep boundaries," or "to rebel."&lt;ref&gt;Understanding the Islamic Scripture 2007 Mustansir Mir p.55&lt;/ref&gt; From this, ''Taghut'' denotes one who exceeds their limits. This notion is associated with the three stages of disbelief in the Islamic context. The first stage of error is ''[[Fasiq|fisq]]'' (i.e. disobeying God without denying that one should obey Him), the second is ''[[kafir|kufr]]'', (i.e. rejection of the very idea that one should obey God).&lt;ref&gt;Arabic Dictionary of Islamic Terms&lt;/ref&gt; The last stage would be not only to rebel against God but also impose their rebellion against the will of God upon others. Those who reach this stage are considered as ''taghut''.&lt;ref&gt;The Pure Islam project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/jihaad/0010pdf.pdf SunnahOnline. PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Qur'an==
The term ''taghut'' occurs eight times in the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name="Jo" /&gt;

{{quote|"Do you not see how those given a share of the Scripture, [evidently] now believe in idols and evil powers? (Taghut) They say of the disbelievers, 'They are more rightly guided than the believers."| Qur'an, Sura 4 (An-Nisa), ayat 51&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|7|51|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This is taken to refer to an actual event in which a group of disbelieving Meccans went to two eminent Jewish figures for counsel on the truth of Muhammad's teachings and were told that the pagans were more rightly guided than Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;See Abdel Haleem Oxford Translation p.87 notes&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"Do you [Prophet] not see those who claim to believe in what has been sent down to you, and in what was sent down before you, yet still want to turn to unjust tyrants for judgement, although they have been ordered to reject them? Satan wants to lead them far astray."| Qur'an, Sura 4 (An-Nisa), [[Ayah|ayat]] 60&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|60|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The Arabic ''taghut'' is variously interpreted to refer to idols, a specific tyrant, an oracle, or an opponent of the Prophet.&lt;ref&gt;See Abdel Haleem Oxford Translation of the Qur'an p.89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abdel Haleem Oxford Translation p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The believers fight for God's cause, while those who reject faith fight for an unjust cause. Fight the allies of Satan: Satan's strategies are truly weak."|Qur'an, Sura 4 (An-Nisa), [[Ayah|ayat]] 76&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|76|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Again, this term ''taghut'' has been used here.

{{quote|"There is no compulsion in religion: true guidance has become distinct from error, so whoever rejects (taghut) false gods and believes in God has grasped the firmest hand-hold, one that will never break. God is all hearing, all knowing."| Qur'an, Sura 2 (Al-Baqarah), [[Ayah|ayat]] 256&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|7|256|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''The Book of Zombie''''' is a 2010 American independent horror film written by [[Erik Van Sant]] and directed by [[Scott Kragelund]], [[Paul Cranefield]] and [[Erik Van Sant]].  Brian Ibsen, Larisa Peters, Andrew Loviska, Paul Cantu, Bill Johns, Adrienne MacIain, Andy Evans, Adam Gehrke, and Elissa Dowling star as survivors of a Mormon-themed zombie attack.

==Plot==
On Halloween in a small, sleepy town in Utah, David Driscoll and Jenny King, who are involved in a relationship gone cold, try to settle down for a romantic evening, but they are visited by two [[Mormon]] missionaries, who seem to suffer from a small affliction. David shrugs them off with a few bad jokes and tries to resume his evening plans when the Mormons ring again – this time, as blood-thirsty [[Zombie (fictional)|zombies]], along with several others who begin to overrun their neighborhood. After escaping their door-callers when one of them recoils from a soda thrown in his face, David decides to see an acquaintance, a convenience shop and bar owner named Harry Linderman, who owns a double-barrel shotgun. They reach the shop, only to meet a youth named Darwin Nedry and his substance-sniffing friend Charlie Cooper, who tell them that Linderman left with his gun after a phone call reached him from his medieval-themed bar, ''The Drunken Dragon''.

Not knowing how to retrieve their little daughter Charlotte, who is staying out of the house this night, without a weapon, David and Jenny decide to stay in the store for the time being. Soon, however, an armed, gritty hunter named Boothe Gardener stages a dramatic entrance into the store and stays for the night as well, following his own close brush with the zombified Mormon population in which his friend Charlie was killed. Owing to the incident at his house door, David concludes that the zombies are vulnerable to things which are taboo to Mormons, including caffeine. When a zombie breaks into the store, Gardener is mortally wounded after he tries to fight it off using non-caffeinated soda. Darwin destroys the zombie with caffeinated soda.

Forced to evacuate the store, David and company make for the ''Drunken Dragon'' but draw dozens of zombies. In the nick of time, they are led inside by armor-clad bartender Piper McKenzie, who tells them that Linderman was zombified during a zombie riot in the bar and is now kept locked up in a side room because she cannot bring herself to finish him. After discovering that Darwin keeps several explosive prank devices in his backpack, David devises a plan to reach Piper's car and get to his daughter by letting Linderman out, strapping the explosives and their scant soda supplies onto his back and using him as an involuntary suicide bomber to take out the zombies encroaching on the bar. The plan quickly goes awry when Linderman bites Darwin just after he is released, dooming him, before the youngster blasts his head with his own shotgun. Faced with no other choice, Darwin assumes the role of the bomber as a last heroic act, but he turns before he can light the fuse. Piper lights the explosives with a crossbow and fire arrow, but the blast proves too weak to take out all the zombies; before the door can be re-barricaded, the undead break into the bar and devour Piper alive, while Charlie faints.

Retreating into the main taproom, David and Jenny fight and destroy the undead, but by retreating too far, Jenny is caught by a zombie breaking through a window and mortally wounded. After promising Jenny that he will find their daughter, David hugs her until she dies, decapitates her to prevent reanimation, and then kills the remaining zombies in a berserk rage. As morning dawns, David staggers off, filled with revenge, to finish the undead, with an unsure Charlie in tow.

The film ends in some institution where a file labelled ''The Utah Project'' containing information about mutation warfare is presented to a group of boardroom-type people, followed by a file detailing an upcoming project ominously named ''The Vatican Solution''. As the file courier exits the boardroom, the camera backtracks his path to the reception of an office building, where a receptionist answers a phone call with the words, "Thank you for calling [[Church of Scientology]]. How may we help you?"

==Production==
The majority of the production was shot during the summer of 2007 and finished in 2009.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}  The filmmakers did not single out Mormonism for any particular reason. The concept came from a joke during a brainstorming session, and one of the producers decided to develop it. Major influences include [[George A. Romero]], [[Troma Entertainment]], and [[Edgar Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bycommonconsent.com/2008/02/04/interview-the-book-of-zombie/|title=Interview: The Book of Zombie — UPDATED|last=Evans|first=Steve|work=[[By Common Consent]]|date=2008-02-04|accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Henshaw''' (1873–1938) was the fifth [[Bishop of Salford]], a [[Roman Catholic]] diocese in the north-west of [[England]].

==Early life and education==
He was born on 2 February 1873 in [[Miles Platting]] in [[Manchester]], the son of Thomas Henshaw, a Manchester coal merchant, and his wife Ann Billington. He was educated at the Salford Catholic Grammar School, the [[English College, Lisbon]], and at [[St Cuthbert's College, Ushaw|St Cuthbert's College]], Ushaw, where he taught French for three years as a Minor Professor.

==Early career==
He was ordained priest on 18 October 1899. Following ordination,  Henshaw was sent to the [[Institut Catholique, Paris]], where he specialised for three years in [[Dogmatic Theology]]. He then spent a year at [[Bonn University]], before taking the chair in Dogmatic Theology at [[Ushaw College]].

In 1905, Henshaw returned to his native [[Diocese of Salford|Salford Diocese]], serving for the next six years at [[St Bede's College, Manchester|St Bede's College]] as Professor and Vice-Rector. In 1912, he was appointed curate at St Alban, Blackburn until 1913, when he became Rector at the Holy Saviour, [[Nelson, Lancashire|Nelson]]. In 1916, he moved to St Mary, Heaton Norris, and in 1920 took charge of St Gabriel, Castleton. In mid-1925 he was appointed parish priest at St Anne, [[Blackburn]], where he completed the work building the new Byzantine church started by the previous priest, Fr William Shine, who had died suddenly earlier that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic-hierarchy|bishop|bhens|Bishop Thomas Henshaw|21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As Bishop of Salford==
Bishop [[Louis Charles Casartelli]] had died in January 1925, but it would be almost a year before a replacement was appointed. That replacement was Henshaw, consecrated Bishop on 21 December 1925 at [[Salford Cathedral]] by [[Archbishop Keating]]. He was taken as a "pastorally minded and pragmatic parish priest with financial acumen and quiet scholarship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salforddiocese.org.uk/history/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502013908/http://www.salforddiocese.org.uk/history/index.html |archivedate=2009-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education was Henshaw's forte, even if the vision of Catholic education in Westminster and in Salford occasionally clashed. Particular problems of physically defective "blacklisted" schools and of the beginning of [[slum clearance]] in inner urban areas, taxed the mind and pocket of the Catholic community. The 1936 Education Act separated schools into Junior and Senior Schools and ended, at least in theory, the all-age parish elementary school.

The lay organisations continued to develop, with newcomers such as the [[Legion of Mary]] and the [[Young Christian Workers]]. Henshaw's attitude to the continual shortage of priests was simple: pray and the Lord will provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salforddiocese.org.uk/history/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502013908/http://www.salforddiocese.org.uk/history/index.html |archivedate=2009-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926 the diocese also hosted the National Catholic Congress in Manchester. In 1927 he acquired the [[Wardley Hall]] Estate in [[Worsley]] as the official residence of the Bishop of Salford

He died on 23 September 1938, aged 65.

{{Campaignbox Taiping Rebellion}}
The '''Tianjing Incident'''&lt;ref&gt;Steven Platt refers to it as the '''Eastern King’s coup'''&lt;/ref&gt; ({{zh|t=天京事變|p=Tiānjīng Shìbiàn}}) occurred during the late [[Qing Dynasty]] from September 2 to October 1856. This was a major political internal conflict within the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] which took place in its capital city [[Nanjing|Tianjing]]. A few key leaders of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] were killed; the East King [[Yang Xiuqing]], the North King [[Wei Changhui]] and the Yan King [[Qin Rigang]]. More than 27,000 other soldiers and civilians perished in the conflict as well. The Tianjing Incident was said to be one of the factors which led to the eventual failure of the Taiping Rebellion, as well as the turning point in its fate.

==Historical background==
In 1851, the Taiping Rebellion's leader [[Hong Xiuquan]] conferred the title of 'King' on five of his most loyal followers and placed them under the jurisdiction of the East King [[Yang Xiuqing]]. After the deaths of the South King [[Feng Yunshan]] and the West King [[Xiao Chaogui]], most of the power of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom fell into the hands of Yang Xiuqing.

In the early years of the Taiping Rebellion, the real power of the military was in the hands of the Military Advisor (軍師) and the leader Heavenly King [[Hong Xiuquan]] did not actually wield any power in his hands and was merely a puppet leader.{{cn|date=August 2018}} The real power of the military was actually in the hands of the East King [[Yang Xiuqing]], who gained more power following the deaths of the South and West Kings. Hong Xiuquan declared in 1848 that the spirit of the 'Holy Father' (天父) would possess Yang Xiuqing and give him orders through Yang. This had allowed Yang to become even more influential and placed him in a position higher than Hong, as Yang often gave orders to Hong, who was supposed to be his superior, in the name of the 'Holy Father'. When this happened, Hong had no choice but to follow the orders of the 'Holy Father', which were actually Yang's orders.

After the Taiping Army captured [[Nanjing]] and established its capital city there, renaming it to Tianjing, Yang Xiuqing's relationships with the other Kings gradually worsened. The North King [[Wei Changhui]] was flogged on Yang Xiuqing's orders once, as his subordinate had offended Yang. Later, Wei's relative had a dispute over property with Yang's relative, which angered Yang. Yang Xiuqing called Wei Changhui to decide the punishment for Wei's relative together, and Wei replied that his relative should be torn into five parts. Once, the Yi King [[Shi Dakai]]'s father-in-law [[Huang Yukun]] offended Yang Xiuqing and was ordered to be flogged 300 times, and his nobility title removed and demoted. In the same incident, the Yan Prince [[Qin Rigang]] and another high-ranking official [[Chen Chengrong]] were also flogged on Yang Xiuqing's orders. Even the Heavenly King was not spared from being flogged, as Yang often pretended that the 'Holy Father' had possessed him and used the name of the 'Holy Father' to punish Hong Xiuquan. Yang Xiuqing monopolised the power of the kingdom and became increasingly influential, making him feared and hated by the others, but none dared to oppose him.

==Events==
On 20 June 1856, the Taiping Army defeated the Qing army led by [[Xiang Rong]] and lifted the three-year-long siege on Tianjing. Xiang Rong died on 9 August and news of his death reached Tianjing. The East King [[Yang Xiuqing]] saw that the Kingdom was functioning well and began to make his plans to seize power.

Shortly afterwards, Yang Xiuqing pretended to be possessed by the 'Holy Father' and summoned the Heavenly King [[Hong Xiuquan]] to his residence. Yang said to Hong, "You and the East King are both my sons. The East King has made significant contributions, so why is he still being hailed as *'Long Live for Nine Thousand Years' instead of 'Long Live for Ten Thousand Years'?" Hong Xiuquan replied, "The East King has indeed made significant contributions by conquering an empire, so he should be hailed as 'Long Live for Ten Thousand Years'." The 'Holy Father'-possessed Yang Xiuqing asked again, "Should the East King's son be hailed as 'Long Live for a Thousand Years'?" Hong Xiuquan replied, "Since the East King is hailed as 'Long Live for Ten Thousand Years', his son and his descendants should also be hailed as 'Long Live for Ten Thousand Years' as well." The 'Holy Father'-possessed Yang Xiuqing said happily, "I'm returning to heaven."

Shortly before seeking a title commiserate with Hong Xiuquan's, Yang dispatched Wei Changhui, Shi Dakai, and [[Qin Rigang]] to separate provinces.&lt;ref name=s237&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 237 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Hong, viewing Yang's request as treasonous, alerted the three generals to return at once.&lt;ref name=s237/&gt;  Wei returned to Nanjing with three thousand troops on September 1, 1856 and found that Qin Rigang had already arrived.&lt;ref name=s242 /&gt; In consultation with Hong Xiuquan and his allies, the two generals decided not to wait for Shi Dakai's arrival.&lt;ref name=s242&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 242 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, they and their troops immediately stormed Yang's palace and slew him before he could escape.&lt;ref name=s242 /&gt;  They then slaughtered his family and followers within the palace, despite having agreed with Hong that only Yang was to die.&lt;ref name=s242 /&gt; At this point, six thousand of Yang's followers remained in Nanjing.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 242-43 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Hong and his generals agreed to set a trap for those men.&lt;ref name=s243&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 243 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Hong pretended to arrest Wei and Qin Rigang for their actions and invited Yang's followers to watch as the two were beaten.&lt;ref name=s243 /&gt; Once the majority of Yang's followers were inside, the beatings ceased and Yang's followers were imprisoned inside the halls from which they were watching the beatings.&lt;ref name=s243 /&gt;  The next morning, they were all systemically slaughtered.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 243-44 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  Killings of Yang's followers continued for three additional months.&lt;ref name=s244&gt;Jonathan D. Spence, God's Chinese Son 244 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Shi Dakai finally reached Nanjing in October and blamed Wei Changhui for the excessive bloodshed.&lt;ref name=s244 /&gt;  Wei in turn suggested that Shi may be a traitor&lt;ref name=s244 /&gt;  Having been warned that he could be assassinated next, Shi fled Nanjing, leaving the same day he arrived.&lt;ref name=s244 /&gt;  That night, Wei and Qin Rigang stormed Shi's mansion and slaughtered his family and retinue.&lt;ref name=s244 /&gt;  Shi then consolidated an army of 100,000 and demanded the heads of Wei and Qin.&lt;ref name=s244 /&gt;  Wei directed Qin to block Shi's advance and began plotting to imprison Hong Xiquan.&lt;ref name=s244 /&gt;  Hong Xiuquan was able to preempt those plans, however, and had his bodyguards kill Wei.&lt;ref name=s244 /&gt;  Qin was lured back and killed shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=s244 /&gt;

Later, [[Hong Xiuquan]] granted the deceased [[Yang Xiuqing]] amnesty and acquitted Yang of his crimes of harbouring the intention of usurping the throne. Yang Xiuqing's death was later marked as 'The East King ascends to Heaven'.

==Impacts==
{{no references|section|date=August 2018}}
After the Tianjing Incident, the leaders of the rebellion gradually lost popular support from the people, and the rebellion started to decline. The military's morale was greatly shaken and they started losing battles against the Qing armies. The turn of tide caused the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's territories to become gradually reduced and it fell towards the losing end.

After the deaths of the East King [[Yang Xiuqing]] and the North King [[Wei Changhui]], the Yi King [[Shi Dakai]] was put in command of the Taiping Army and wielded control over the entire military. [[Hong Xiuquan]] was irate over Shi Dakai's popularity and feared that he might attempt to seize power again as Yang and Wei did, hence he appointed his brothers as Kings in order to weaken Shi Dakai's influence and prevent Shi from consolidating too much power. As Hong Xiuquan worked to undermine him, Shi Dakai realized that Hong's suspicions would not be dispelled, and that if he stayed he would face either murder or risk another civil war, Shi Dakai left Tianjing in 1857 with his army, which caused the Kingdom to be in greater peril.

In the early years of the Taiping Rebellion, the power of the military was in the hands of the Military Advisor (軍師), but after the Tianjing Incident and Shi Dakai's departure, the position of Military Advisor was not succeeded by anyone and only existed in name. Also, the government of the Kingdom gradually became more and more corrupt, which accounted for its decline and eventual collapse.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

'''Unga-Chuck''' of the Nsswe Neppe, is a [[mythological]] character from the Meskwaki-Sauk&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.native-languages.org/meskwaki-sauk.htm Native Languages]&lt;/ref&gt; tribal folklore.  The tale comes from the [[Sac and Fox Nation|Fox and Sac tribes]] in what is now central [[Iowa]].

The Asikiwaki (or Sauk or Sac) tribe and the Meskwaki (or Fox) tribe. The Meskwaki and Asikiwaki Indians were related to each other and spoke the same language, but they were politically independent. However, the Fox tribe was nearly destroyed in a war with the French, and the surviving Fox Indians fled to the Sauk villages for protection. The two tribes merged into a single tribe called the Sac and Fox. Most Sac and Fox people still live together today. The version below was collected by John Tobin in his book ''With No Intention''.&lt;ref&gt;Laurance Press Company Cedar Rapids 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Story of Unga Chuck ==
Unga-Chuck's story takes place on [[Cedar River (Iowa River)|Cedar River]] in Iowa. Unga Chuck lived in a clearing by the banks of the river. The exact setting is referred to as the meeting of The Three Waters. He was the grandson of Chief Poweshiek and the son of Magor. He was considered the pride of the village. Life goes well for him until Magor his father does not return from a hunt. Unga Chuck then goes on to live with his grandfather and learns to become a great leader in his village.

The village lived very peaceful and happy lives with Unga Chuck marrying his sweetheart Lees-wa Later Unga-Chuck one day sees  visions that upsets him. The first being three trees silhouetted like people on the horizon. The two trees were to one side of a tree that stood alone. Then Unga-Chuck saw three suns setting (possibly explained today as [[sundog]]s). The visions were strange and troubling to the tribe. However, since good fortune followed the signs were soon forgotten.

A few years later an evil man in the village named Napatog started to hate Unga-Chuck becoming jealous of his skills and the fact that Unga_Chuck would be the next chief of the village. Napatog plans to murder Unga-Chuck, then he would become the next chief.

Napatog waits until Unga-Chuck takes a morning walk in the foggy valley to carry out his plan of murder. He shots and kills Unga-Chuk with an arrow. The day turns bright and sunny except where the body of Unga-Chuck lies. The villagers soon began to worry about this mystery fog. The village soon discovers what has happened and rise up to drive Napatog away. The village is rewarded with a beautiful sunset that lets them know that Unga-Chuck has made it safely to his final resting place. Unga-Chuck's death brings peace to the village and he removes all evils from the tribes.

The story finishes with a red rose growing in Nesswe Neppe as proof that the blood spilled by Unga-Chuck nourished and made the ground of this land fertile and good.

It is said that on the anniversary of Unga-Chuck's death when the fog is lifting from the valley he can be heard still calling for his beloved Lees-Wa.

'''Votan'''{{Pronunciation-needed}} is a [[legend]]ary or [[mythology|mythological]] figure mentioned in early European accounts of the [[Maya civilization]].

==Origins of the Votan story==
The story of Votan in Mexico dates back to at least the late 17th century. It was first published in ''Constituciones diocesanas del obispado de Chiappa'' (1702) by [[Francisco Núñez de la Vega]], Bishop of [[Chiapas]]. According to [[Francisco Javier Clavijero]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
F. Núñez de la Vega, bishop of Chiapa, says, in the preface to his ''Synodal Constitutions'', that in the visit which he made to his diocese towards the end of the last century [i.e. the late 1600s], he found many ancient calendars of the Chiapanese, and an old manuscript in the language of that country, made by the Indians themselves, in which it was said, according to their ancient tradition, that a certain person named ''Votan'' was present at that great building, which was made by order of his uncle, in order to mount up to heaven; that then every people was given its language, and that Votan himself was charged by God to make the division of the lands of [[Anahuac (Aztec)|Anahuac]].  The prelate adds afterwards, that there was in his time in Teopixca a great settlement of that diocese, a family of the surname of Votan, who were the reputed descendants of that ancient populator.  We are not here endeavoring to give the antiquity to the populator of America on the faith of the Chiapanese, but merely to shew that the Americans conceived themselves the descendants of Noah.&lt;ref name="Clavigero 1787, p. 204"&gt;Clavigero 1787, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his account, Bishop Núñez de Vega also states that Votan belonged to the royal lineage of "Cham" (probably "chan" or snake) and that he established a kingdom called "Na Chan" (Snake House) on the [[Usumacinta River]] that eventually extended across [[Chiapas]] and [[Soconusco]] to the Pacific Coast.&lt;ref name="Megged 1996, p. 26"&gt;Megged 1996, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional information can be found in a 1786 publication by [[Antonio del Río]]&lt;ref&gt;Rio [1786] (1822)&lt;/ref&gt; that cites the same sources as Clavigero and speculates at length on Votan's identity and travels to the Old World.

At a time when the origins of [[Pre-Columbian]] cultures were poorly understood, these clerics associated Votan with the Biblical stories of the [[Tower of Babel]] and [[Noah]], speculating that he had come to Mexico from the [[Old World]]. This tradition has been perpetuated by additional fantastic speculations that have been sharply critiqued by subsequent scholarship. This includes the association of Votan with [[Palenque]] by Ramon de Ordoñez y Aguilar, a priest who had lived near the site and wrote one of the earliest descriptions of the ruins in 1773. Ordoñez apparently incorporated some of the information that had been collected earlier by Bishop Núñez de la Vega into a document called the ''Probanza de Votan''. "This strange work contained some fragments from Ximénez and a confused account of Votan, culture hero of the [[Tzeltal people]], who, according to Ordoñez, had built Palenque. Fantastic details described Votan's four trips back to the Middle East."&lt;ref&gt;Mace 1973, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal]] are an ethnic group that occupies the region that includes Teopisca, Chiapas, about 113&amp;nbsp;km southeast of Palenque. In the late 17th century, two hundred Tzeltal families "of Votan's ancestry" are said to have been living in Comitlan.&lt;ref name="Megged 1996, p. 26"/&gt;

Assertion of a relationship between Votan and Odin is found in the work of the distinguished geographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]], who wrote in ''Vues des Cordillères'' (1810):
&lt;blockquote&gt;We have fixed the special attention of our readers upon this Votan, or Wodan, an American who appears in the same family with the Wods or Odins of the Goths and of the people of Celtic origins.  Since, according to the learned researches of [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]], Odin and Buddha are probably the same person, it is curious to see the names of ''Bondvar'', ''Wodansdag'', and ''Votan'' designating in India, Scandinavia, and in Mexico the day of a brief period.&lt;ref&gt;Humboldt 1810, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''Histoire des nations civilisées du Mexique et de l'Amérique Centrale'' (1857), [[Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]] claimed Votan was an ancient [[Phoenicia]]n ''legislateur'' who had migrated from the Middle East to the Maya area, defeated a race called the Quiname, built the city of [[Palenque]], and established an empire called [[Xibalba]] that was postulated by Brasseur de Bourbourg to have once covered all of Mexico and part of the United States. Subsequent [[Mayanist]] scholarship has found little support for Phoenician contact with ancient Mesoamerica, and identifies Xibalba as a mythical place rather than a political entity.

==Influence on Mormonism==
Extensive analysis of the story of Votan appeared as commentary on the work of Antonio del Río by Paul Felix Cabrera in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Río [1786] (1822).&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the LDS church{{who|date=November 2010}} have claimed that Cabrera's work had a strong influence on [[Joseph Smith]] and [[Oliver Cowdery]], founders of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}  Smith reported having a vision in 1823 that eventually led him to the claimed discovery of [[golden plates]] that documented a group of ancient Israelites journey to the Americas, 960 years of their descendants history and their dealings with the god of the Israelites.  These plates are the [[origin of the Book of Mormon]].

==Similarity to Wotan==
The similarity between the names Votan and [[Wōden|Wotan]] has also been the source of much confusion. Chapter IV of ''[[Atlantis: The Antediluvian World]]'' (1882) by [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]], titled "The God Odin, Woden, or Wotan", repeats Clavigero's reference in the context of speculation about [[Atlantis]] and (following Brasseur de Bourbourg) also suggests that Votan built Palenque. Donnelly quotes Clavigero as saying that Votan "conducted seven families from Valum-Votan to this continent, and assigned lands to them",&lt;ref&gt;Donnelly 1882, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; and implies that "Valum-Votan" may have been a reference to [[Atlantis]].&lt;ref&gt;Donnelly 1882, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Votan was further associated with the Atlantis legend by [[Lewis Spence]] in ''Atlantis in America'' (1925), who identifies Votan as "a local name for Quetzalcoatl" and provides a synopsis of the account by Núñez de la Vega.&lt;ref&gt;Spence 1925, pp. 55-56&lt;/ref&gt; Votan has also been cited in the literature of [[Neo-Nazism]] and [[white supremacy]] that associates him with [[Quetzalcoatl]] and [[Kukulcan]] and asserts that he was a bearded, White European who came to Mexico in [[Pre-Columbian]] times. These interpretations are also considered to be problematic by recent Mayanist scholarship.

==Pacal Votan==
Associations of Votan with Palenque have led [[New Age]] spiritual leader [[José Argüelles]] to identify [[Pacal the Great]] as “Pacal Votan” and to identify himself as an emanation of “Valum Votan”. However, no mention of Votan has been found in the inscriptions of Palenque despite considerable progress in the decipherment of the extensive [[Maya script|Maya inscriptions]] known for the site.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in a comprehensive compilation of the epigraphic knowledge concerning Palenque's inscriptions, ''A Concordance to the Inscriptions of Palenque'' (Ringle and Smith-Stark 1996), there is no mention or index entry for ''votan''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more critical evaluation suggests that Votan was a [[culture hero]] of the [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal]] whose story may be based on that of a ruler who lived in the vicinity of Teopisca, Chiapas during the [[Postclassic]] period. He was referred to as "Lord of the Horizontal Wooden Drum" and "jaguar god of darkness" (''ak'bal''),&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1970, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; and his name was one of twenty day names in the Tzeltal calendar.&lt;ref name="Clavigero 1787, p. 204" /&gt; Ritual objects associated with Votan were removed from a sanctuary and burned in the main square of Huehuetlán by Bishop Núñez de la Vega in 1691.&lt;ref&gt;Spence 1925, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Megged 1996, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Votan Zapata==
Votan is often described as the "heart" of indigenous people in Chiapas. The qualities of both culture hero and deep sentiment are expressed in the persona of Votan Zapata, a legendary manifestation of the spirit of [[Emiliano Zapata]] honored by members of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (EZLN). "Guardian and heart of the people is Votan-Zapata who is also the guardian and heart of the word. He, the man, the star with the five points who represents humanity, he. Today that we have spoken and listened, he is happy, the heart of Votan-Zapata is happy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Subcomandante Marcos]] 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Way of the Taiping''', also known as the '''Way of the Great Peace''', was a [[China|Chinese]] [[Taoist]] movement founded by [[Zhang Jue]] during the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]]. Its adherents all around China participated in the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] of 184, with the rebellion being suppressed within the same year by the Eastern Han government. The religious movement was greatly reduced and died soon afterwards. The Way of the Taiping was one of the two largest movements within early [[Taoism]], with the other being the [[Way of the Five Pecks of Rice]]. During the reign of [[Emperor Ling of Han]], the movement was recorded to have been popular in eight Provinces: [[Qing Province]], [[Xu Province]], [[You Province]], [[Ji Province]], [[Jing Province]], [[Yang Province]], [[Yan Province]], and [[Yuzhou (ancient China)|Yu Province]].&lt;ref name="劉學銚2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=劉學銚|title=中國文化史講稿|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FTe9rljMYtoC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=27 March 2014|year=2005|publisher=知書房出版集團|language=zh-tw|isbn=978-986-7640-65-9|pages=63–|quote=太平道。東漢順帝時(西元 126 〜 144 年) ,有于吉自稱獲得神仙書《太平經》(又稱《太平青領書》) ,共一百七十卷,交其徒弟宮崇,宮崇將此書獻於漢順帝,順帝目爲妖妄不經,僅收藏之,《太平經》並非一人一時之作,內容極爲龐雜...東漢漢靈帝之時宦官、外戚專權，政治黑暗，人民生活痛苦，大平道乘時大為流行於青、徐、幽、冀、荊、揚、兗、豫八州。此為早期道教之兩大派別。}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="王新龙2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=王新龙|title=大汉王朝4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tuAoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT176|date=25 November 2013|publisher=Green Apple Data Center|pages=176–|id=GGKEY:Q09W4ABH0SS}}&lt;/ref&gt;。

==Origins==
The Way of the Taiping originated in the reign of [[Emperor Shun of Han]] of the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] (126-144). A [[Fangshi]] named ''[[Gan Ji]]'' (Some later histories referred to him as '''Yu Ji''') claimed that he received a divine book called the ''[[Taiping Qingling Shu]]'' (太平清領書) from a pond in [[Quyang County]], and thereafter started to build elaborate temples and established rituals like the burning of incense and the reading of [[Taoist]] manuscripts. He also treated the people's ([[Baixing]]) illnesses with burnt [[Fulu]] mixed with water, and he became very popular amongst them. According to the ''[[Book of Later Han]]'', during the reign of [[Emperor Shun of Han|Emperor Shun]] ({{reign}} 125–144), [[Gong Chong]] (宮崇), one of Gan Ji's disciples, submitted the ''[[Taiping Qingling Shu]]'' (太平清領書) to the emperor, but did not receive substantial attention. Gong Chong's disciple [[Xiang Kai]] tried the same, but his efforts also faltered. Later on, the book fell into the hands of [[Zhang Jue]], who established the '''Way of the Taiping'''.&lt;ref&gt;窪德忠：《道教史》，頁82-84。&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later Developments==
[[Zhang Jue]] from Julu [[Commandery (China)|Commandery]], having obtained the ''[[Taiping Qingling Shu]]'', declared himself "Great Teacher" (大賢良師), preached to his disciples and treated peoples' illnesses. He quickly became popular, as he sent his eight disciples around the country, using the "Kind Way" (善道) to preach to the commoners, and within ten years had followers numbering 100,000, across eight Provinces: [[Qing Province]], [[Xu Province]], [[You Province]], [[Ji Province]], [[Jing Province]], [[Yang Province]], [[Yan Province]], and [[Yuzhou (ancient China)|Yu Province]].&lt;ref&gt;窪德忠：《道教史》，頁84-85。&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang Jue split his followers into 36 "Fang"s (directions), with the bigger Fang having over 10,000 each, while the smaller Fangs having 7,000 people. He and his brothers gave themselves titles: [[Zhang Bao (Yellow Turban)|Zhang Bao]] was the "General of Land" (地公將軍), [[Zhang Liang (Yellow Turban)|Zhang Liang]] was the "General of the People" (人公將軍); and Zhang Jue was the "General of Heaven" (天公將軍). The Way of the Taiping acted like a military organisation thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;窪德忠：《道教史》，頁85。&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preachings==
Zhang Jue held a nine-section cane, and often proclaimed that people were sick and suffering because they had sinned. For them to recover, the patients must first reflect on their mistakes, and when they finally show contrition, he would make them drink the [[Fulu]]-water mixture. He praised those who recovered as having great faith, and for those who did not as having not enough.&lt;ref&gt;窪德忠：《道教史》，頁84；秋月觀瑛：〈道教史〉，頁31。&lt;/ref&gt; The Way of the Taiping worshiped the colour yellow, and followers wore yellow clothes with yellow headbands, and they worshiped the [[Yellow Emperor]], [[Laozi]] and [[Chinese theology#Taiyi|Taiyi]] (太一), who was the greatest God in the pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;唐長孺：〈《太平經》與太平道〉，頁140-141。&lt;/ref&gt; Taiyi is an anthropomorphism of the [[North Star]].

==Uprising==
Zhang Jue proposed the slogan of "Cangtian (heaven, blue sky) is dead, the Huangtian (yellow sky) has been established, the age is at Jiazi (184AD), [[tianxia]] experiences great fortune" (蒼天已死，黃天當立，歲在甲子（184年），天下大吉), and theorised that of [[Zou Yan]]'s cycle of five elements ([[Wu Xing]]), the Earth (Yellow) element was to replace the Han Dynasty's Fire element.&lt;ref&gt;唐長孺：〈《太平經》與太平道〉，頁141。&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang Jue's followers wrote the slogan in the capital and [[yamen]] walls of the provinces and prefectures, and planned for the leader of the large Fangs [[Ma Yuanyi]] to lead the tens of thousands of followers from [[Jing Province]] and [[Yang Province]] to rise up on the 5th of March 184AD. Ma went around the capital and nearby cities to prepare for the rebellion, and had officials within the Palace walls as spies.&lt;ref&gt;窪德忠：《道教史》，頁85-86。&lt;/ref&gt; But the central government caught wind of the conspiracy, and Ma was torn asunder by chariots for treason. [[Emperor Ling of Han]] ordered the arrest of Zhang Jue and his followers, and this prompted Zhang to initiate the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] in February, with the scale of the rebellion shocking the court. New followers flocked from all over the country to join the Way of the Taiping.&lt;ref&gt;窪德忠：《道教史》，頁85-86；秋月觀瑛：〈道教史〉，頁33。&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defeat==
Within the same year of the uprising, Zhang Jue passed away from an illness, Zhang Bao was killed, and Zhang Liang fell in battle. The [[Yellow Turban Army]] still resisted in various locales for the next ten years, and many joined [[Cao Cao]]'s army later on.&lt;ref&gt;窪德忠：《道教史》，頁86。&lt;/ref&gt; The Way of the Taiping survived in a different form, even after the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]], in the worship of the [[Taiping Di Jun]](太平帝君).

'''Yanta''' is a [[village]] situated in [[Rashaya District]], [[Beqaa Governorate]], [[Lebanon]], {{convert|79|km|mi}} from [[Beirut]]. It is located close to the [[Syrian]] border north of [[Kfar Qouq]].&lt;ref name="Furaiḥa1972"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anīs Furaiḥa|title=dictionary of the name of towns and villages in Lebanon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aiUeNAAACAAJ|accessdate=17 March 2011|year=1972|publisher=Maktabat Lubnān}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village sits about {{convert|1540|m|ft}} above sea level. The name is variously claimed to mean "God sows" or "God the sower" in [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], "white dove" in [[Syraic]] and "elevation" in [[Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tourism.leb961.com/brochures/rachaya.pdf Qada' (Caza) Rachaya - Promenade Tourist Brochure, published by The Lebanese Ministry of Tourism]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that a special type of yellow [[marl]] (lake sediments) has been noticed in Yanta and the surrounding area dated to the [[Oxfordian (stage)|Oxfordian]].&lt;ref name="HombergBachmann2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.

There are ruins of an impressively sized and positioned [[Roman temple]] in the area that is presumed to have been built on the site of a forerunning Semitic temple.&lt;ref name="Mannheim2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ivan Mannheim|title=Syria &amp; Lebanon handbook: the travel guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t9LHVdWLc7gC&amp;pg=PA603|accessdate=24 April 2011|date=1 July 2001|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-900949-90-3|pages=603–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor1969"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Taylor|title=The Roman temples of Lebanon: a pictorial guide, pp. 22, 127, 130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XXchNqgyNdkC|accessdate=24 April 2011|year=1969|publisher=Argonaut}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruins lie on either side of the road and are sparse but retain some upright stones. Around the site are remnants of ancient habitation and tombs.
