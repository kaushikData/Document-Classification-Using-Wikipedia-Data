'''Albert Thys''' (28 November 1849 &amp;ndash; 10 February 1915) was a Belgian businessman who was active in the [[Congo Free State]]. He gave his name of Thysville to the station of Sona Qongo, currently [[Mbanza-Ngungu]] in [[Bas-Congo]].

Born in [[Dalhem]], Thys graduated at the École de guerre, before entering into the service of king [[Leopold II of Belgium]] in 1876, as secretary of the colonial businesses. After the return of [[Henry Morton Stanley]], the king sent Thys to [[England]] to propose a new expedition to Central Africa on behalf of the [[Association Internationale Africaine]]. Thys was actively involved in the organisation of the first expeditions which would lead to the constitution of the Congo Free State.

After arriving in Congo in 1887 he promoted the [[Matadi-Kinshasa Railway|Matadi-Léopoldville Railway]], which was built from 1890 to 1898. He imposed a route by the south, deviating from the [[Congo river]]. He was one of the principal craftsmen of the development and the economic development of the Congo Free State and [[Belgian Congo]]. Notably he created the {{illm|Compagnie du Congo pour le Commerce et l'Industrie|nl}} (27 December 1886) and many of its subsidiary companies: the [[Compagnie du Chemin de Fer du Congo]] (CCFC), the ''Compagnie des Magasins généraux'', the ''Société anonyme Belge pour le Commerce du Haut-Congo'', the ''Compagnie des¨Produits'', the ''[[Compagnie du Katanga]]''.

He died in [[Brussels]], aged 66, in 1915.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3993">'''Aldo Garzanti''' (1883 in [[Forlì]] - 1961 in [[San Pellegrino Terme]]) was an Italian entrepreneur and publisher.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/aldo-garzanti_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/|title=Garzanti, Aldo|publisher=[[Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani]] - Volume 52|year=1999|accessdate=9 December 2013|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in Forlì, his father was a schoolteacher and follower of Garibaldi. He was educated in his native city where G. Mazzatinti introduced him to librarianship. He then studied at the Faculty of Letters in the [[University of Bologna]], graduating in 1907.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

Immediately after graduating, he joined a group of intellectuals associated with the journal ''La Romagna nella storia, nella letteratura e nelle arti'', becoming its editor in 1911. He took a special interest in the social and economic history of the region, publishing accounts of developments from the 16th to the 18th centuries. At the same time, he took up teaching, first at the high school in [[Rimini]], then at [[Alatri]] (1909) and [[Chieri]] (1912). During the [[First World War]], he enlisted in the artillery until April 1919 when he was discharged with the rank of captain.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

==Business career==

Immediately after the war he moved to Milan where he gave up teaching in favour of a business career, becoming the Italian agent for American chemicals producers including [[Dupont de Nemours]] and founding his own company, Dott. Aldo Garzanti Coloranti et Prodotti Chimici, a distribution outlet supplying the textile and leather industries. As a result of his success, in 1921 he was able to open his own manufacturing company, SADAF, which produced dyes and chemicals for soaking and tanning hides and leathers. In 1932, he widened his interests, opening MIRET specializing in lace and silk. The following year he created a model agricultural enterprise in [[Suvignano]], [[Tuscany]] but above all, in 1936, he acquired the Treves publishing company which was in difficulty. Created in 1861 by [[Emilio Treves]], Fratelli Treves Editori had been a leading publisher not only in [[Lombardy]] but throughout Italy. After changing its name to Casa Editrice Garzanti, he received support from [[Benito Mussolini]] which brought him lucrative commissions from the library authorities, making it one of the top publishing companies in Italy.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garzantilibri.it/default.php?page=casaed|title=Garzanti Libri s.p.a.|publisher=Garzanti Libri|accessdate=11 December 2013 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company suffered during the [[Second World War]] when the old Treves printing plant was bombed but Garzanti was successful in rebuilding modern facilities within a year, winning the Roncoroni prize for rapid redevelopment. In 1952, suffering from poor health, he retired as managing director of the company but remained chairman of the board.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

==Later life==
In later life, Garzanti devoted his efforts mainly to philanthropic activities, contributing to the restoration of the castle Rocca Caterina Sforza in Forlì and assisting artists through the Fondazione Livio e Maria Garzanti. In 1954, he financed the Italian expedition which successfully climbed [[K2]]. He died in 1961 at the age of 78.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

==Family==

In 1920, Garzanti married Maria Ravasi who gave birth to their son Livio in 1921. Livio later took over the family publishing business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/cultura/11_giugno_20/torno-novanta-anni-livio-garzanti_94474866-9b25-11e0-b9a7-5cbc176a671d.shtml|title=La crisi italiana è culturale|publisher=Corriere della Sera|accessdate=11 December 2013 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andreas Fugger''' (1394, [[Augsburg]] - 1457, Augsburg), known as "der Reiche", was a German businessman. He was the oldest son of Hans Fugger and Elisabeth Gfattermann, making him the elder brother of [[Jakob Fugger the Elder]]. He was the founder of the Fugger vom Reh branch of the [[Fugger]] family. His wife was Barbara Stammler vom Ast (1415/20-1476), a daughter of a rich salesman from Augsburg. Andreas was a very successful and able businessman, so he was called "Andreas der Reiche". He was the first member of the Fugger family who became a businessman. All the other family members were craftsmen at this time. Andreas Fugger and his wife had four sons, Jakob (about 1430-1505), Lukas the Elder (1439-1512), Matthäus (1442-1489/92) and Hans the Elder (1443-1501). They were the founders of the four main lines of the "Fugger vom Reh". The only existent line today is represented by the descendants of Matthäus Fugger. The current patriarch is Markus Fugger von dem Rech (born 1970).

He became the president of the [[Movement for Democratic Change – Ncube|Movement for Democratic Change]] (MDC) in February 2006.&lt;ref name="outsider"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4756424.stm Zimbabwe's 'outsider' faction leader] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305142059/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4756424.stm |date=5 March 2016 }} BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; He has worked as the managing director and CEO of Africa Technology and Business Institute since September 2003.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; Under a [[2008 Zimbabwean political negotiations|September 2008 power-sharing agreement]], Mutambara served in the government as one of two Deputy Prime Ministers from 2009 to 2013.

==Early activism==
Mutambara was president of the Student Representative Council of the University of Zimbabwe in 1988 and 1989. He led anti-government protests at the [[University of Zimbabwe]] which led to his arrest and imprisonment. He was later educated on a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] in 1991, at [[Merton College, Oxford]] in the United Kingdom where he obtained a DPhil in [[Robotics]] and Mechatronics, and in the United States where he spent time as a visiting Fellow&lt;ref&gt;MLK Visiting Professors welcomed",{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2000/mlk-1213.html |title=MLK 1213 |accessdate=2008-08-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104043130/http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2000/mlk-1213.html |archivedate=4 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the same field, including both [[California Institute of Technology]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[FAMU - FSU College of Engineering|Florida A &amp; M University – Florida State University College of Engineering]]. He also worked as a lecturer on Business Strategy and as a consultant for [[McKinsey &amp; Company]].&lt;ref name="outsider"/&gt;

Mutambara criticised government ministers for abusing Zimbabwe's [[land reform in Zimbabwe|land reform program]], engaging in: "monopolistic politics of domination, corruption, and petty bourgeois accumulation."&lt;ref name="monopolism"&gt;Bond, Patrick. ''Uneven Zimbabwe: A Study of Finance, Development, and Underdevelopment'', 1998. Page 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutambara, a self-professed admirer of [[Che Guevara]], has also expressed his intention to visit [[Cuba]] to learn more about its "successful resistance" to [[Cuban embargo|American sanctions]].&lt;ref name="AllAfrica" /&gt; Mutambara added: "We have a lot to learn from Cuba which started [[Cuban Revolution|its revolution]] in 1959, we will continue with our solidarity, continue with the struggle and strengthen our co-operation."&lt;ref name="AllAfrica"&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200908210020.html Zimbabwe: Build on Revolution Legacy, Country Told] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011005116/http://allafrica.com/stories/200908210020.html |date=11 October 2012 }} ''All Africa'', 21 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly output==
From March of 2002 to September of 2003, Mutambara was a professor of [[Operations Management]] at the [[University of South Africa]]'s School of Business Leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Who is Who in Mutare? |publisher=Samanyika &amp; Sons |location=Mutare, Zimbabwe |url=https://sites.google.com/site/cityofmutare/famouspeoplefrommutare?tmpl=%2Fsystem%2Fapp%2Ftemplates%2Fprint%2F&amp;showPrintDialog=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004025845/https://sites.google.com/site/cityofmutare/famouspeoplefrommutare |archive-date=4 October 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutambara has authored at least two books.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Arthur-G.-O.-Mutambara/e/B001KIB98I/ref=sr_tc_2_0 Amazon UK, Books by Arthur G.

Durrant-Whyte|Professor Hugh F. Durrant-Whyte]]. According to [[Scopus]] as of 2013 his [[h-index]] was a modest 4.

==Movement for Democratic Change==
In 2005 the MDC split into two factions following a dispute over whether or not to participate in the March 2005 senatorial election. While MDC leader [[Morgan Tsvangirai]], Mutambara, and others opposed participation, [[Welshman Ncube]] and [[Gibson Sibanda]] led a faction that favoured participation.&lt;ref name="outsider"/&gt; Those supporting the senate elections won narrowly against the leader Morgan Tsvangirai's vote. Tsvangirai later overruled and overturned the decision of the plebiscite citing two absent members had sent in postal votes that canceled the slender margin.&lt;ref name="smaller faction"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Zimbabwe Opposition: Mugabe's Price Cuts Mask Deeper Economic Problems |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-07-15-voa21.cfm |date=15 July 2007 |publisher=''[[VOA News]]'' |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913210005/http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2007-07/2007-07-15-voa21.cfm |archivedate=13 September 2008 |access-date=31 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006 at a Congress of the breakaway faction Movement for Democratic Change, Mutambara was elected as president of the party. Commenting on the election, Mutambara said, "My position was that the MDC should have boycotted those Senate elections. I guess then that makes me the anti-Senate leader of the pro-Senate MDC faction. How ridiculous can we get? That debate is now in the past, let us move on and unite our people."&lt;ref name="outsider"/&gt;

The choice of Mutambara as leader was said to have been inspired by the fact that he is a [[Shona people|Shona]] whereas Sibanda and Ncube are both [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]], but realised that only a Shona candidate could win an election across the whole of Zimbabwe. Mutambara is not a member of the House of Assembly. 

The faction led by Tsvangirai described Mutambara's election as a nullity. In his MDC faction presidential acceptance speech,&lt;ref name="acceptance"&gt;[http://amadlandawonye.wikispaces.com/MDC,+Presidential+acceptance+speech,+A+Mutambara MDC faction presidential acceptance speech]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427135734/http://amadlandawonye.wikispaces.com/MDC%2C%2BPresidential%2Bacceptance%2Bspeech%2C%2BA%2BMutambara |date=27 April 2012 }} Communist University of Johannesburg&lt;/ref&gt; Mutambara stated, "We believe that our views on land reform in Zimbabwe are different from those of Western governments. Our approach is not driven by the interests of [[Whites in Zimbabwe|white]] farmers, but by those of all Zimbabweans, white and black. While we put the failure of the land reform program squarely on the [[ZANU–PF]] government, we also acknowledge the complicity of some Western governments which reneged on agreements, and the inertia of white farmers in seeking pre-emptive solutions." However, [[David Karimanzira]], a leading member of the ZANU–PF, alleged that Mutambara was promoted by the West after Western governments decided not to continue backing [[Morgan Tsvangirai]] because the Zimbabwean people had allegedly rejected his party manifesto. He once called the [[African Union]] a "club of dictators".&lt;ref name="au"&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200706111569.html Zimbabwe: Era of Puppet Politics Over] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013115628/http://allafrica.com/stories/200706111569.html |date=13 October 2012 }} AllAfrica&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutambara was arrested by the Zimbabwe police on 19 May 2006 while leading a march in support of his faction's candidate on the eve of the Budiriro by-election. He was also arrested on 11 March together with other MDC leaders from the other faction. He was released without charge two days later, only to be re-arrested on 18 March at Harare Airport en route to South Africa, where his family is still based, and where he is also a leading consultant. He was also released without charge after three days in custody.

===2008 presidential election===
After Mutambara and Tsvangirai failed to unite on a single MDC candidate for the [[Zimbabwean presidential election, 2008|March 2008 presidential election]], Mutambara said on 15 February that he would not run for president and that his faction would instead back [[Simba Makoni]].&lt;ref&gt;Fikile Mapala, [http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/electoral155.17759.html "Mutambara withdraws from race, backs Makoni"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801030954/http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/electoral155.17759.html |date=1 August 2013 }}, newzimbabwe.com, 15 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutambara instead ran in the [[Zimbabwean parliamentary election, 2008|concurrent parliamentary election]] for a seat from the Zengeza East constituency, but he was placed third, with 1,322 votes, according to official results, behind the candidate of the Tsvangirai faction, who won 7,570 votes, and the ZANU–PF candidate, who won 3,042 votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sokwanele.com/election2008/constituency Results page for Zengeza East] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404060118/http://www.sokwanele.com/election2008/constituency |date=4 April 2008 }} at sokwanele.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tsvangirai faction won 99 seats in the parliamentary election and the Mutambara faction won 10, compared with 97 for ZANU–PF.&lt;ref name=Photo&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200804030001.html "Zanu-PF, MDC-T in photo finish"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002222742/http://allafrica.com/stories/200804030001.html |date=2 October 2012 }}, ''The Herald'' (allAfrica.com), 3 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 April 2008, Mutambara and Tsvangirai announced that their factions were reuniting, thus enabling the MDC to have a clear parliamentary majority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7371823.stm "Opposition reunites in Zimbabwe"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414214358/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7371823.stm |date=14 April 2009 }}, BBC News, 28 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June 2008, Mutambara was arrested at his home in Harare. According to his lawyer, the arrest was due to an article he wrote in ''The Standard'' in April, which allegedly included "falsehoods" and "contempt of court". In this article, he blamed Mugabe for the state of the economy and accused the security forces of committing abuses.&lt;ref&gt;Godfrey Marawanyika, [http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=3045&amp;art_id=nw20080601170729234C285235 "Top Zim opposition figure arrested"] {{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, Sapa-AFP (''IOL''), 1 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 June, Mutambara was released on a bail of 20 million [[Zimbabwean dollar]]s but he did not go to jail, with the next court date being set for 17 June. After the hearing on 3 June, he described his own suffering as minor compared to that of the people, saying that Mugabe's "human rights violations" would fail and vowing, "We will triumph over evil."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=84&amp;art_id=nw20080603132919207C311676 "Top Zim opposition figure freed"] {{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, AFP (''IOL''), 3 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===SADC facilitated power-sharing agreement ===
On 15 September 2008, the leaders of the 14-member [[Southern African Development Community]] witnessed the signing of a power-sharing agreement between the two MDC factions and ZANU-PF. Under the deal, Mugabe remained president, Tsvangirai became prime minister,&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/09/15/zimbabwe.powershare/?iref=mpstoryview edition.cnn.com, Rivals sign Zimbabwe power-share deal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232421/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/africa/09/15/zimbabwe.powershare/?iref=mpstoryview |date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the MDC controlled the police, ZANU-PF controlled the Army, and Mutambara became deputy prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article4756995.ece timesonline.co.uk, Power-sharing deal signed in Zimbabwe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718194732/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article4756995.ece |date=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26715920/ www.msnbc.msn, Zimbabwe power-sharing deal signed] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024163219/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26715920/|date=24 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BAMTech Media''' is a technology subsidiary of [[The Walt Disney Company]] located in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first1=Brooks |last1= BARNES |first2= John |last2=KOBLIN |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/business/media/bamtech-disney-streaming.html |title=Disney’s Big Bet on Streaming Relies on Little-Known Tech Company |work=The New York Times |date=2017-10-08 |accessdate=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 2015 as a spin-off of [[MLB Advanced Media]]—the [[digital media]] arm of [[Major League Baseball]], focused on providing [[streaming video]] technology, particularly for [[over-the-top content]] (OTT) services. The company's major clients include [[ESPN]] (for its [[WatchESPN]] service), the NHL, [[HBO]] (for its [[HBO Now]] service), the [[PGA Tour]], [[Riot Games]] (for ''[[League of Legends]]'' [[e-sports]]), [[PlayStation Vue]], [[WWE Network]]&lt;ref name="variety-disneymaj"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/digital/news/hbo-cto-otto-berkes-resigns-as-network-enlists-mlb-to-build-ott-platform-1201375255/|title=HBO CTO Otto Berkes Resigns After Network Enlists MLB to Build OTT Platform|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=December 9, 2014|work=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|access-date=August 9, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TheBlaze]].

It was majority owned by MLB Advanced Media (which is, in turn, a consortium of MLB's [[List of Major League Baseball principal owners|principal team owners]]), with minority stakes held by the [[National Hockey League]] and other investors. Disney acquired a minority stake in the company in August 2016 for $1 billion, and the following year, announced its intent to increase its stake to a 75% controlling stake for $1.58 billion. The deal was approved by regulators in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.fiercecable.com/online-video/disney-gets-ok-from-ftc-for-1-58-billion-bamtech-buy|title=Disney gets OK from FTC for $1.58B BAMTech buy|last=Munson|first=Ben|date=September 20, 2017|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|accessdate= September 20, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/feds-ok-disneys-bamtech-buy/168773|title=Feds OK Disney's BAMTech Buy|last=Eggerton|first=John|date=September 20, 2017|newspaper=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|accessdate= September 20, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the acquisition of BAMTech by Disney, the company began to develop two subscription streaming services aligned with Disney properties: the sports-oriented service [[ESPN+]], and the upcoming entertainment service [[Disney+]].

==History==
===BAMTech Media===
BAMTech was founded in February 2015 through [[MLB Advanced Media]], spinning-out its streaming technology business into a separate company with outside investors. The formation of the company was approved by MLB Advanced Media's board of directors on August 13, 2015.&lt;ref name="Ben Popper"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/4/9090897/mlb-bam-live-streaming-internet-tv-nhl-hbo-now-espn|title=The Change Up: How baseball’s tech team built the future of television|author=Ben Popper|publisher=Vox Media|work=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the plan, MLB-specific properties (such as MLB.com) would remain under league control.&lt;ref name=verge-mlbamspinoff&gt;{{cite web|title=MLB considers spinning off its powerful streaming business|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/23/8092439/mlb-considers-mlbam-spinoff|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, [[The Walt Disney Company]] acquired a 1/3 stake in the company for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Rains |url=https://www.sporttechie.com/disney-prepares-to-adapt-to-cord-cutters-with-new-mlbam-deal/ |title=Disney Prepares To Adapt To Cord Cutters With New MLBAM Deal |publisher=Sporttechie.com |date=2016-07-01 |accessdate=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 2016, BAMTech announced a partnership with [[Discovery Communications]] to form a European joint venture known as BAMTech Europe. Its first client is [[Eurosport]], the pan-European rightsholder of the [[Olympic Games]] beginning [[2018 Winter Olympics|2018]].&lt;ref name="thr-bameurope"&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery, MLB's Streaming Business Partner to Launch BAMTech Europe|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/discovery-mlbs-streaming-business-partner-launch-bamtech-europe-942862|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|accessdate=November 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, [[Riot Games]] announced a deal with BAMTech for the company to distribute and monetize broadcasts of [[League of Legends Championship Series|professional competitions]] in its multiplayer video game ''[[League of Legends]]'' through 2023. BAMTech will pay Riot at least $50 million per-year, and split advertising revenue.&lt;ref name="polygon-bamtechaol"&gt;{{cite web|title=League of Legends’ maker inks rich broadcast contract, with an eye on premium content|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/12/18/13998614/league-of-legends-premium-tv-service-mlb|website=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-lolmlb"&gt;{{cite web|title=‘League of Legends’ E-Sports Contests Lure Newest Fan: Major League Baseball|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/league-of-legends-e-sports-contests-lure-newest-fan-major-league-baseball-1481889603|website=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[News Corp]]|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{USBankruptcy}}
A '''Proof of claim in bankruptcy''', in [[United States]] [[bankruptcy]] [[law]], is a document filed with the Court so as to register a claim against the [[assets]] of the bankruptcy estate.  The claim sets out the amount that is owed to the creditor as of the date of the bankruptcy filing and, if relevant, any priority status. Although a document called a Claim in Bankruptcy is used in proceedings in both Canada and the United States, in the United States, the document is properly termed a '''Proof of Claim'''. The form is different although they share many similar aspects.

Upon receipt of a claim, the Trustee in bankruptcy must notify the claimant (or creditor) whether the estate will object to the claim or whether it will, as is the default case, allow the claim.  

Some of the reasons a creditor's claim may be objected to are that:

* the claim is not [[liquidated]], such as a claim for damages for pain and suffering that is not the result of a judgment debt. This assertion is not fatal as the claim may be liquidated in Bankruptcy Court;
* the claim omits appropriate set-offs to which the bankrupt entity ("the debtor") is entitled [[by operation of law]];
* the amount of the claim is in dispute, such as a bill for defective goods, in which case the matter may be litigated in Bankruptcy Court;
* the creditor is claiming a higher priority than they are entitled to, such as an ordinary creditor claiming priority to estate assets.

If a claim is objected to, the [[bankruptcy court]] may set a hearing and, if necessary, conduct a trial, in order to resolve the dispute.

There is usually a deadline (termed the '''Bar Date''') for filing claims to allow the trustee to determine the distribution of any funds obtained from the [[liquidation]] of the estate.  Claims are paid out first to administrative creditors, then to priority unsecured creditors according to their statutory priority, and finally to the non-priority unsecured creditors, with all claims paid ''[[wikt:pro rata|pro rata]]'' with other members of the class.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2369">Dr. '''Jan Constant Janssen''' (18 September 1895 in [[Belgium]], [[Vlimmeren]] &amp;ndash; 15 April 1970 in [[Antwerp]]) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] physician and businessman. He was the third child (out of four) of Adriaan Victor Janssen (1854&amp;ndash;1942) and Anna Catharina Eelen (1855&amp;ndash;1929). He went to high school in [[Hoogstraten]] and studied medicine at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] and the [[University of Ghent]]. On 16 April 1925, he married Margriet Fleerackers ([[Turnhout]], 5 January 1897-[[Vosselaar]], 23 September 1973), together they had four children. Their oldest son, [[Paul Janssen]], would become one of the most successful scientists in pharmaceutics.

==Career==
He started his career as a family physician in [[Turnhout]], but in addition he was interested in business too. In 1921, he met Ladislas Richter in [[Vienna]], who was the son of Gedeon Richter, who owned a pharmaceutical factory in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. In 1933, he acquired the right to distribute the pharmaceutical products of [[Gedeon Richter Ltd.|Richter]], the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] pharmaceutical company, for Belgium, [[the Netherlands]] and [[Belgian Congo]]. On 23 October 1934, he founded the ''N.V. Produkten Richter'' in [[Turnhout]]. In 1937 Constant Janssen acquired an old factory building in the ''Statiestraat 78'' in [[Turnhout]] for his growing company, which he expanded during [[World War II]] into a four-storey building. In 1938 he closed his practice as a family physician and concentrated his effort of the expansion of his pharmaceutical business. His wife managed the production, quality control, and the administration of the company.

Still a medical student, his son Paul Janssen helped with the development of [[Perdolan]]. After [[World War II]], the brandname of the products was changed into ''Eupharma'', and later the company would evolve into [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]].

{{Financial risk types}}
'''Country risk''' refers to the risk of investing or lending in a country, arising from possible changes in the business environment that may adversely affect operating profits or the value of assets in the country. For example, financial factors such as currency controls, devaluation or regulatory changes, or stability factors such as mass riots, civil war and other potential events contribute to companies' operational risks. This term is also sometimes referred to as [[political risk]]; however, country risk is a more general term that generally refers only to risks affecting all companies operating within or involved with a particular country. 

Political risk analysis providers and credit rating agencies use different methodologies to assess and rate countries' comparative [[Peren-Clement Index|risk exposure]]. Credit rating agencies tend to use quantitative econometric models and focus on financial analysis, whereas political risk providers tend to use qualitative methods, focusing on political analysis. However, there is no consensus on methodology in assessing credit and political risks.

== Honours ==

The City of Toronto, on February 28, 2017, the final day of Black History Month, announced the naming of a street in a new Scarborough sub-division in honour of Mr. Denham Jolly, a Black pioneer in Canada’s radio broadcasting industry.
"Jolly Way" will commemorate  the exceptional contributions to Canada of Denham Jolly.
Jolly Way is located near the southwest corner of Midland Avenue and Ellesmere Avenue, in a residential neighbourhood under development  by the Goldman Group.
"It is most appropriate that approval to name a street after Mr. Jolly has come through today, the last day of Black History Month 2017," said Councillor Michael Thompson, Chair of Toronto’s Economic Development Committee.
"Mr. Jolly has been instrumental in giving voice to the culture, achievements, challenges and aspirations of Toronto’s Black and Caribbean communities when few channels for such messages were available," Thompson added.

The '''Downtown Grand Las Vegas''', formerly the '''Lady Luck Hotel &amp; Casino''', is a [[hotel]] and [[casino]] in [[Downtown Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], owned by the CIM Group and operated by Fifth Street Gaming. The Downtown Grand is the centerpiece of '''Downtown3rd''', a new neighborhood and entertainment district under development in downtown Las Vegas.

==Facility==
Set on {{convert|6.27|acre}} at 3rd Street and East Ogden Avenue, the Downtown Grand has two hotel towers: to the east, the 18-story Casino Tower built in 1985 with 295 rooms, and to the west, the 25-story Grand Tower with 334 rooms.  The East Tower is connected to the ground level casino.  The property is served by a four-level parking garage and features several restaurants and entertainment venues along 3rd Street.  These establishments include Freedom Beat, Triple George Grill, Sidebar, and [[Hogs and Heifers|Hogs and Heifers Saloon]].

==History==
===Lady Luck (1964–2006)===
* In 2000 the Lady Luck was acquired by [[Isle of Capri Casinos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On June, 2002 it was purchased by Steadfast AMX who turned two floors into timeshares. 
* On May 13, 2005 it was purchased by the Henry Brent Company for $24 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate  = Dec 10, 2008 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 16, 2005 plans were announced for a major renovation and expansion of the property to begin early in 2006.

===Closing and renovations (2006–13)===
On February 11, 2006 the hotel and casino, but not the timeshares, closed for remodeling; the property was expected to be closed for nine to twelve months but financing collapsed. 

On June 12, 2007 the casino was purchased by the CIM Group for over $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url         = http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/jul/02/city-mulls-downtown-land-sale-cut-rate/#axzz2WFufC6u1

| author      = Las Vegas Sun
| date        = July 2, 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lady Luck construction Oct 2012.jpg|thumbnail|left|Workers tearing down portions of the casino for renovation in October 2012.]]In July 2008 the city was investigating rezoning the nearby land containing the transit center to unrestricted gaming. With the transit center relocated, the land would be available for development.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} Mayor [[Oscar Goodman]] applauded the attempt to re-invigorate the plans to renovate the Lady Luck: "For the past several years I have seen a rotting corpse. The Lady Luck structure has been a blight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Spillman |first=Benjamin |title=Land-value raise may lift Lady Luck |url=http://www.lvrj.com/business/22854419.html |work=Las Vegas Review-Journal |date=July 3, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709081203/http://www.lvrj.com/business/22854419.html |archivedate=July 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2009, Goodman once again said in a council meeting that "The Lady Luck is a disaster," and then called the skeletal structure a "carcass". Las Vegas city leaders wanted CIM Group to raze the unfinished structure at Fourth Street and Stewart Avenue and do a better job of keeping sidewalks and landscaping clean near the site. CIM had until late December 2009 to begin a $100 million renovation of the Lady Luck; otherwise, it would potentially lose an offer from the city which would hand over land around the proposed nearby [[Mob Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Spillman |first=Benjamin |title=Mayor calls Lady Luck casino 'carcass' |url=http://www.lvrj.com/business/49971782.html |work=Las Vegas Review-Journal |date=July 5, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708051927/http://www.lvrj.com/business/49971782.html |archivedate=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 23, 2009, some demolition work started on a 4-story concrete building adjacent to the main resort. This work was completed in accordance with the city's request for CIM Group to raze the condemned structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Demolition begins at downtown's Lady Luck |url=http://www.lvrj.com/news/breaking_news/51507217.html |work=Las Vegas Review-Journal |date=July 23, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725221921/http://www.lvrj.com/news/breaking_news/51507217.html |archivedate=July 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2010, CIM Group made an agreement with city officials to have the renovations completed by December 31, 2011. There was the potential that the hotel/casino would reopen in 2012, five years after its originally scheduled reopening in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Downtown hopes for upturn,  New casino owners bring money, optimism to help area rebound |url=https://nl.newsbank.com |website=Las Vegas Business Press |accessdate=December 1, 2018 |date=March 30, 2010 |subscription=yes|via=NewsLibrary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DICCPP Logo.png|right|thumb|220px]]
'''Durban Industry Climate Change Partnership Project''' (DICCPP) is a project aimed at facilitating industry response to climate change in the [[eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality|eThekwini]] Municipality ([[Durban]]), [[South Africa]][http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/energy/climate]. The project is being implemented through a partnership between the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO), the Durban Investment Promotion Agency (DIPA),&lt;ref name="DIPA"&gt;Durban Investment Promotion Agency, http://www.dipa.co.za/&lt;/ref&gt; the eThekwini Municipality and the Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI).&lt;ref name="DCCI"&gt;Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry, http://www.durbanchamber.co.za/&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the project is to sensitise industry in Durban to the risks and opportunities associated with [[climate change]] by creating a platform through which learning and communication between industry and government can take place.&lt;ref name="UNIDO"&gt;Unido South Africa, UNIDO Website, http://www.unido.org/index.php?id=1000128&lt;/ref&gt; The project aims to establish a sustained partnership between the various industries organisations in Durban and the eThekwini Municipality. The partnership is seen as fundamental to responding to climate change and effectively contributing towards climate change mitigation and adaptation within the Durban metropolitan area.&lt;ref name="Durban Portal"&gt;Climate Change, Durban Portal Website, http://durbanportal.net/ClimateChange/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core areas==
The partnership covers three core areas. These are: industry specific interventions; institutional support and; outreach.&lt;ref name="Durban Portal" /&gt; Specific actions within these core areas assist the partnership in fulfilling its assigned purpose.

===Industry specific interventions===
As part of the first core area, industry specific interventions, engagement with three main existing structures within Durban's industries is seen as critical to the success of the project. These existing industry structures or groupings are: the Durban Automotive Cluster; the Durban Chemical Cluster (DCC) and; the eThekwini Maritime and Logistics Cluster (EMLC).&lt;ref name="Durban Portal" /&gt;

These industries are brought together and a process of learning, through the conducting of a number of forums by the DICCPP is realised. These forums&lt;ref name="DAC"&gt;Durban Automotive Cluster Website, http://www.dbnautocluster.org.za/dac/index/news/id/41&lt;/ref&gt; designed specifically for the local industry cover issues such as [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) assessments (which include carbon footprint calculations, life cycle and supply chain analysis and emission target development); financial implications or opportunities (which include information on carbon taxes, the carbon market, funding streams and investment opportunities); new technologies in renewable energy; waste management and finally; climate change response strategies.,&lt;ref name="Durban Portal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DCC"&gt;Durban Chemical Cluster Website, http://www.durbanchemicalscluster.org.za/dcc/tmp/DCC%20Newsletter%20(November%202009).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional support===
The second core area of the DICCPP is providing an institutional support mechanism for actively driving and monitoring industry climate change response activities in Durban. In this regard, the DICCPP is working closely with the eThekwini Energy Office to develop a climate change mitigation competency in the municipal structure.&lt;ref name="Durban Energy Office"&gt;Durban Energy Office,  http://www.durban.gov.za/durban/government/energy/saving&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outreach===
The third core area of the DICCPP is called outreach and this is seen as an important part of the project in that it seeks to creates an awareness about climate change issues.&lt;ref name="Durban Portal" /&gt; A 'carbon footprint video' is being developed within the eThekwini communications department and serves to assist industry to quantify their [[carbon footprint]]. The DICCPP is also working with the Imagine Durban team running an Electricity Saving Competition within business in the city.&lt;ref name="Imagine Durban"&gt;Imagine Durban, http://www.imaginedurban.org/index.php/BusinessElectricity.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy==
The project's ultimate strategy is to establish a forum for industry to meet regularly to discuss climate change mitigation and adaptation activities.&lt;ref name="UNIDO" /&gt; In doing so, this will facilitate investment and technology transfer between Durban and a similar project in China (also implemented by UNIDO).&lt;ref name="UNIDO" /&gt; Once this has been established, it is envisaged that regular meetings with the government and other stakeholders will take place.

The '''Eicher Polaris Multix''' (or '''Multix''') was a [[personal utility vehicle]] manufactured by [[Eicher Motors]] and Polaris India (the Indian arm of [[Polaris Industries]]). The vehicle was announced in June 2015, and the first vehicle was delivered on 26 August 2015. Multix is promoted by its manufacturer as "India's first personal utility vehicle", able to be used as a [[people carrier]], a [[Commercial vehicle|cargo carrier]] and also a [[power generators|power generator]].&lt;ref name=oncars/&gt;&lt;ref name="Multix personal utility vehicle launched"&gt;{{cite news|title=Multix personal utility vehicle launched|work=[[The Hindu]]|last=Balachandar|first=G.|accessdate=8 October 2015|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/multix-personal-utility-vehicle-launched/article7520477.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Multix model comparisons"&gt;{{cite news|title=Multix model comparisons|publisher=carewale.com|accessdate=8 October 2015|url=http://www.carwale.com/comparecars/eicherpolaris-multix-vs-eicherpolaris-multix/?car1=4113&amp;car2=4112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="About Multix"&gt;{{cite news|title=About Multix|publisher=Official website|accessdate=8 October 2015|url=http://www.multix.in/aboutus1.html#eicher1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In July 2012, [[Eicher Motors]] and [[Polaris Industries]] formed a 50:50 [[joint venture]] (JV) to manufacture vehicles in [[India]].&lt;ref name="Eicher-Polaris start delivery of Multix"&gt;{{cite news|title=Eicher-Polaris start delivery of Multix|publisher=[[The Economic Times]]|accessdate=8 October 2015|url=http://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/passenger-vehicle/uv/eicher-polaris-starts-delivery-of-multix-gets-its-first-owner/48691388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cardekho/&gt; This [[Joint venture|JV]] was formed with an initial investment of {{INRConvert|350|c|1|no|to=USD|year=2012}} and the new company was named "Eicher Polaris Pvt. Ltd." Thereafter, [[Eicher Motors]] and [[Polaris Industries]] combined their [[research and development]] facilities in their new [[manufacturing plant]] in [[Kukas]], [[Jaipur]], [[Rajasthan]], India.&lt;ref name="Eicher-Polaris start delivery of Multix"/&gt;

In May 2018, Eicher and Polaris announced they were closing down the Indian-joint venture, and discontinuing the Multix.&lt;ref&gt;https://auto.ndtv.com/news/eicher-motors-closes-down-jv-with-polaris-multix-to-be-discontinued-1822655&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The Multix was designed with the aim of being used for both family and business purposes, and has been called a "3-in-1" vehicle.&lt;ref name=oncars&gt;{{cite news|title=Eicher Polaris launches Multix, first Personal Vehicle in India|url=http://www.oncars.in/car-news/eicher-polaris-launches-multix-first-personal-vehicle-in-india/8098|accessdate=8 October 2015|work=On Cars India|date=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its cargo capacity is 400 litres.&lt;ref name=gopalan/&gt; Multix also generates 3 [[kilowatts]] of [[electricity]] and can thus be used as a [[power generators|power generator]] as well.&lt;ref name="Eicher-Polaris start delivery of Multix"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gopalan/&gt;

===Variants===
The Multix has two variants, the AX+ and the MX. With the exception of doors (and the overall weight of the vehicle), both the variants are identical. AX+ has open doorways, whilst MX has doors. The [[curb weight]] of the MX is 100&amp;nbsp;kg more than that of AX+.&lt;ref name="Multix model comparisons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Specification: AX+"&gt;{{cite news|title=Specification: AX+|publisher=Official website|accessdate=8 October 2015|url=http://www.multix.in/AX1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Specification: MX"&gt;{{cite news|title=Specification: MX|publisher=Official website|accessdate=8 October 2015|url=http://www.multix.in/MX.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
As of October 2015, 30 JV dealerships had been set up to sell Multix models, in [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]].&lt;ref name=gopalan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gopalan|first1=Murali|title=It's one step at a time for Multix|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/specials/auto-focus/its-one-step-at-a-time-for-multix/article7712620.ece|accessdate=8 October 2015|work=[[The Hindu]] Business Line|date=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eicher-Polaris JV"/&gt; Eicher Polaris Pvt. Ltd plans to have dealerships throughout India by mid-2017.&lt;ref name=gopalan/&gt;

Four colors were available as of June 2015.&lt;ref name=cardekho/&gt;

The first Multix vehicle was sold in August 2015, to [[Ganesh Narayan Choudhary]].&lt;ref name="Eicher-Polaris start delivery of Multix"/&gt; The company expects to sell 60,000 vehicles per year.&lt;ref name=gopalan/&gt;

===Financing===
Eicher Polaris Pvt. Ltd has contracted with Cholamandalam Investment, and as of August 2015 was in negotiations with a number of other financial institutions, to provide financing to customers wanting to buy a Multix AX+ or MX.&lt;ref name="Eicher-Polaris JV"&gt;{{cite news|title=Eicher-Polaris JV|work=[[The Hindu]]|last=Balachandar|first=G.|accessdate=8 October 2015|url=http://www.thehindu.com/business/eicher-polaris-jv-in-talks-to-tie-up-financing-for-multix/article7512934.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
As a new entrant in the Indian automotive market, the Eicher Motors-Polaris India partnership is expected to face challenges in establishing its brand.&lt;ref name="Eicher-Polaris JV"/&gt; G. Balachandar of ''[[The Hindu]]'' referred to the Multix as able to convert from "a small car with space for family of 5 [to] a small truck with storage space" and said the innovative vehicle would "create its own segment of buyers."&lt;ref name="Eicher-Polaris JV"/&gt; Another article in ''The Hindu''{{'}}s "Business Line" praised the Multix's "smooth ride" and ability to "handl[e] rough terrain", and suggested it could "replace other mobility options" such as trucks, tractors and traditional automobiles.&lt;ref name=gopalan/&gt; Santanu Choudhury, blogging for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', noted that the Multix was both small enough to give buyers the maneuverability needed for narrow or congested streets, and equipped to handle adverse road conditions including severe ruts and minor flooding.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news|last1=Choudhury|first1=Santanu|title=Meet the Multix, India's Newest Pickup Truck With Extra Charge|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2015/06/22/meet-the-multix-indias-newest-pickup-truck-with-extra-charge/|accessdate=8 October 2015|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' (blog)|date=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also praised the possibilities opened up by the Multix's power generation capability, suggesting it could be used "to light up homes, power tools or even run a DJ console."&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6031">'''Fiscal pedaling''' (from Brazilian Portuguese ''pedalada fiscal'', or simply ''pedaladas'') is a governmental [[creative accounting]] technique involving the use of state-owned banks to front funds required for paying general government obligations without officially declaring a loan, thus hiding these transfers from public scrutiny&lt;ref name="ft-512"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/58401072-167d-11e6-b8d5-4c1fcdbe169f |title=What is Brazil’s president Dilma Rousseff accused of? |last1=Leahy |first1=Joe |date=2016-05-12 |website=FT |publisher=Financial Times |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2017-06-09 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-420"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/20/world/americas/dilma-rousseff-impeachment-brazil.html |title=Brazil Impeachment Debate Hinges on a Thorny Legal Question |last1=Jacobs |first1=Andrew |date=2016-04-20 |website=NY Times |publisher=New York Times |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2017-06-09 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and delaying repayment from the [[Treasury]] to these banks.&lt;ref name="pi-901"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2041905816666148 |title=Country Focus: Brazil |last1=Doctor |first1=Mahrukh |date=September 1, 2016 |journal=Political Insight  |publisher= |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=32–35 |doi=10.1177/2041905816666148 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2017-06-09 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As such it is a kind of "overdraft"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.world.tax/articles/fiscal-pedaling-brazilian-artificial-accounts.php |title=Fiscal Pedaling - Brazilian Artificial Accounts |last1=Quintanilha |first1=Gabriel |date=2016-04-18 |website=world.tax |publisher= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2017-06-09 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; implying a positive balance sheet that does not really exist.&lt;ref name="pi-901" /&gt;  Sometimes the term '''fiscal backpedaling''' is used.&lt;ref name="ab"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/en/politica/noticia/2016-03/law-scholar-says-fiscal-backpedaling-ground-impeach-rousseff |title=Law scholar says fiscal backpedaling is ground to impeach Rousseff |last1=Nascimento |first1=Luciano  |date=2016-03-31 |website=Agencia Brasil |publisher= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2017-06-09 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term gained popularity with the [[Brazilian general election, 2014|Brazilian Presidential election of 2014]], in which President [[Dilma Rousseff|Rousseff]] was reelected. She was later accused of fiscal pedaling during the campaign, for allowing this delay in repayment to government-owned banks by the {{Interlanguage link multi|Tesouro Nacional|pt}} (Brazilian [[Treasury]]) which is also the entity which oversees these banks. Her opponents argued that this amounted to undeclared loans by these banks to the Treasury, which is prohibited by the [[Brazilian Constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/LCP/Lcp101.htm |title=Lei Complementar nº 101, de 4 de Maio de 2000 |trans-title= Supplementary Law n.101 of 4 May 2000 |publisher = Presidência da República do Brasil |date = 4 May 2000 |accessdate= |language=pt |quote=Art. 36: Credit operations are forbidden between a state financial institution and the Federal entity which oversees it in the capacity of loan beneficiary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a violation of the {{ill |Fiscal Responsibility Law|pt |Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal}}.&lt;ref name="pi-901" /&gt;  This led to the [[impeachment of Dilma Rousseff]] beginning in 2015 on multiple charges including fiscal pedaling, and her subsequent removal from office a year later.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}.

One possible motivation for fiscal pedaling is political advantage, in that it permits a government to conceal the true extent of its fiscal obligations during a political campaign. President Rousseff's government was accused of using these accounting techniques during the bitterly fought [[Brazilian general election, 2014|campaign of 2014]], with the funding thus obtained allegedly used to support programs for the poor, credits to farmers, and subsidies for low-income housing.&lt;ref name="ft-512" /&gt; Supporters claimed this was standard practice in Brazil and had been engaged in by previous Presidents, and that the opposition to her was purely political.&lt;ref name="nyt-420" /&gt;

'''Guy Degrenne''' (August 3, 1925 in Tinchebray (Orne) – November 7, 2006) was a French businessman who specialised in [[cutlery]] and [[Household silver|silver]]ware. He has founded the Guy Degrenne group, since 1987 a subsidiary of holding 'Table de France'.&lt;ref&gt;From {{cite journal|title=La nouvelle stratégie de Guy Degrenne, marque symbole|journal=Entreprendre|date=8 April 2015|url=http://www.entreprendre.fr/la-nouvelle--strategie-de-guy-degrenne-marque-symbole|accessdate=14 April 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Guy Degrenne attended college St Joseph in [[Caen]], then studied at [[ESSEC Business School]], and took up his father's steel factory (at [[Sourdeval]]) in 1948.

Guy Degrenne first has war-left steel parts collected, and turns them in [[stainless steel]] dishes, with instant commercial success. By 1958, Guy Degrenne sets up a tableware business, then by 1963 ushers in the luxury tableware business, in copying the standards of Parisian goldsmiths.

In 1967, part of the production is moved to a new factory in [[Vire]] (Calvados). His business then employs about 600 workers.
In 1978, Degrenne meets national recognition with [http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xa0v2k_guy-degrenne-1986_shortfilms a popular advert] reminiscent of his school years : a headmaster catches young Degrenne drawing dishes in his notebooks margin, and then warns him against ill-success (''Ce n'est pas comme cela que vous réussirez dans la vie'').

After earning his bachelors, he continued his [[education]] at the [[University of Strathclyde]] in [[Scotland]], earning an [[MBA]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;[http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/NanyangAlumniAwards/winners/mrinderjitsingh.htm Nanyang Alumni Achievement Award Recipient (2006)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301053840/http://www2.ntu.edu.sg/NanyangAlumniAwards/Winners/MrInderjitSingh.htm |date=1 March 2010 }} [[Nanyang Technological Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Corporate life ==
He began his career with [[Texas Instruments]], beginning as an [[engineer]] in 1985 and spent 13 years ascending the corporate ladder before becoming [[Chief operating officer|Director of Operations]] of the Singapore plant from 1996 to 1998.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;&lt;ref name="three"&gt;[http://www.sst.edu.sg/template02.dwt.php?page=52#J22 SST  / Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship / COUNCIL MEMBERS] - [[School of Science and Technology, Singapore]]&lt;/ref&gt; After his stint with Texas Instruments, Singh began a career of [[entrepreneurship]], in which he started six businesses&lt;ref name="six"&gt;[http://www.asiaone.com/Business/SME%2BCentral/Prime%2BMovers/Story/A1Story20070625-15396.html Marathon man of SMEs] New Straits Times - 25 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; after leaving the corporate arena.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/DK27Ae02.html Singapore embarks on entrepreneurship] Asia Times Online - 27 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the United Test and Assembly Center (UTAC), a semiconductor firm, in 1998 which became a Unicorn valued at US$2b in 2001. The venture was mostly funded by [[Taiwan]]ese friends of his due to what he terms "a dearth of willing investors and a general disbelief that he would be able to achieve his dream of creating a homegrown multinational firm.".&lt;ref name="five"&gt;[http://business.asiaone.com/print/Business/SME%2BCentral/Prime%2BMovers/Story/A1Story20070519-3337.html New entrepreneurship landscape ] The Business Times - 19 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; . He raised a record of US$138m, all at one go, at the seeds stage in 1998. Inderjit left UTAC in 2001. The firm was listed on the [[Singapore Stock Exchange]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;

Around the same time he started UTAC, he started, Tri-Star, which he started with his brothers as trading and services firm, in which much of his and his family's savings were used to fund the company. Today Tri Star is present in 38 countries in Africa as a distributor of Consumer Electronic products. Inderjit subsequently also set-up semiconductor engineering firm Infiniti Solutions in 2001. Infiniti at its peak had operations in the Silicon Valley, USA, in Austin Texas, a factory in Philippines and with the HQ in Singapore.  More recently, he founded Solstar International, a Singapore-based consumer electronics products company, of which he is currently the CEO. Solstar is a Singapore based Consumer Electronics brand selling in 25 countries in Africa and other developing countries around Asia. In 2009, Inderjit, helped start Urah Transdermal,a Singapore based Life-Science Research and product Company that has Developed and patented technologies for the delivery of active molecules through the skin barriers to biological targets.  

He is a Co-President of the World Entrepreneurship Forum, a global organisation on entrepreneurship development. He has also been actively driving the transformation of the entrepreneurship landscape and helping to shape policies to better support start-ups, small and medium businesses in Singapore and has been a board member of Spring Singapore (Enterprise Singapore today) and Vice-Chairman of the Action Community for Entrepreneurship (ACE). He was also a board member of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) for 8 years where he also Chaired the Audit committee of URA. 

Inderjit is currently a member of the Board of Trustees of the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and also is the Chairman of the board of NTUitive, the Innovation company of NTU. He is also the Chairman of the Alumni and Development committee, a board committee of NTU. He is also a member of the International Advisory Panel of EMLyon, a premier business school in France.  

He is the author of the popular book, “The Art and Science of Entrepreneurship”, which captures his entrepreneurial experiences.  

He received the Nanyang Distinguished Alumni award in 2011 from NTU and was awarded the Public Service Medal (Pingat Bakti Masyarakat) in 2016 by the government of Singapore as part of its annual National Day awards. He received the Strathclyde Alumni Distinguished Entrepreneur Award in 2013 [https://www.strath.ac.uk/sen/celebratingsuccess/sade/mrinderjitsingh/] 

== Political Life ==
He became an active grassroots leader in 1984. He became a Member of Parliament for the [[Kebun Bahru|Kebun Baru]] ward in the Ang Mo Kio GRC, in the Prime Minister's team, since the 1996 General Elections, and stepped down in 2015. As a Member of Parliament Inderjit held various positions. He was a Deputy Government Whip for a number of years and also the Chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee of the Ministries of Finance and Trade and Industry.

{{Contract law}}
In [[contract]] [[law]], an '''integration clause''', '''merger clause''',  (sometimes, particularly in the [[United Kingdom]], referred to as an '''entire agreement clause''') &lt;ref&gt;Bates, M., [https://united-kingdom.taylorwessing.com/synapse/commercial_agreementclause.html Entire Agreement Clauses], accessed 16 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt; is a clause in a written contract which declares that contract to be the complete and final agreement between the parties. It is often placed at or towards the end of the contract. Any pre-contractual material which the parties wish to be incorporated into the contract need to be assembled with it or explicitly referred to in the contractual documentation. 

==Effect== 
A contract that has such a clause may be deemed an '''integrated contract''', and any previous negotiations in which the parties to the contract had considered different terms will be deemed superseded by the final writing. However, many modern cases have found merger clauses to be only a [[rebuttable presumption]].

In the [[United States]], the existence of such a term is normally not conclusive proof that no varied or additional conditions exist with respect to the performance of the contract beyond those that are in the writing but instead is simply evidence of that fact.

==Sample clause==
"This Agreement, along with any exhibits, appendices, addenda, schedules, and amendments hereto, encompasses the entire agreement of the parties, and supersedes all previous understandings and agreements between the parties, whether oral or written. The parties hereby acknowledge and represent, by affixing their hands and [[Seal (contract law)|seal]]s hereto, that said parties have not relied on any representation, assertion, guarantee, warranty, collateral contract or other assurance, except those set out in this Agreement, made by or on behalf of any other party or any other person or entity whatsoever, prior to the execution of this Agreement. The parties hereby waive all rights and remedies, at law or in equity, arising or which may arise as the result of a party’s reliance on such representation, assertion, guarantee, warranty, collateral contract or other assurance, provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed as a restriction or limitation of said party’s right to remedies associated with the gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud of any person or party taking place prior to, or contemporaneously with, the execution of this Agreement."{{cn|date=January 2018}}

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3655">The '''International Annealed Copper Standard''' ('''IACS''') is a [[Standard (metrology)|standard]] established in 1914 by the United States Department of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |series=Circular of the Bureau of Standards No.31 |title=Copper Wire Tables, |date=October 1, 1914 |edition=3d |publisher=United States Department of Commerce |url=https://archive.org/details/copperwiretables31unituoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an empirically derived standard value for the [[electrical conductivity]] of commercially available [[copper]].

Sometime around 1913 several copper samples from 14 important refiners and wire manufacturers were analyzed by the [[U.S. Bureau of Standards]]. The average [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of the samples was determined to be 0.15292 [[Ohm|Ω]] for copper wires with a mass of 1 [[gram]] of uniform [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]] and 1 [[meter]] in length at 20&amp;nbsp;°C. In the United States this is usually written as "0.15292 ohm (meter, gram) at 20&amp;nbsp;°C".

Germany proposed a slight modification of this value to "0.15328 ohm (meter, gram) at 20&amp;nbsp;°C", this being equivalent to a conductivity of exactly {{val|58|e=6|u=[[Siemens (unit)|S]]|up=m}} at 20&amp;nbsp;°C. The German modification was adopted by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] in 1913 and subsequently published by the [[United States Department of Commerce]] on October 1, 1914 as the International Annealed Copper Standard (IACS).

The standard is most often used as a comparative property in the specification of the conductivity of other metals. For example, the conductivity of a particular grade of [[titanium]] may be specified as 1.2&amp;nbsp;% IACS, meaning that its electrical conductivity is 1.2&amp;nbsp;% of the copper specified as the IACS standard.&lt;ref&gt;
{{ cite web 
| title = Resistivity and Conductivity Units Converter 
| url=http://www.zappitec.com/en/calculator/
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard can be found at https://archive.org/stream/copperwiretables31unituoft#page/n0/mode/1up.

== Quality of aluminum alloys ==

[[Heat treatment]] will alter several properties of an alloy, many of which are important to a design engineer. A measurement of the electric conductivity of [[aluminum alloys]] can be used to verify that a heat treatment process has been done correctly.
For example a component made of "7075" alloy which was correctly treated with the process "T73" to gain resistance to [[stress corrosion cracking]] will fall in the range of 38.0 to 43.0&amp;nbsp;%&amp;nbsp;IACS.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The acceptance criteria for electrical conductivity of finished or semi-finished parts of wrought aluminum alloys are contained in [[SAE International]] specification AMS2658 Hardness and Conductivity Inspection of Wrought Aluminum Alloy Parts. Here the values are given in reference to the IACS.

A method for measuring electrical conductivity is described in [[ASTM International]] specification ASTM E 1004 Electromagnetic (Eddy-Current) Measurements of Electrical Conductivity. Electrical conductivity meters with direct readout in %IACS are commercially available&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''José Carlos Semenzato'''(born in [[Cafelândia (São Paulo)|Cafelândia]], [[São Paulo]], in 23rd, March 1968) is a Brazilian entrepreneur. He is the current president of '''[https://www.smzto.com.br/ SMZTO Holding de Franquias Setoriais]''', a franchise holding that he founded in 2010 and has ten affiliated companies: [[Casa X]], [https://www.unitedidiomas.com/ United Idiomas], [https://www.partmedsaude.com.br/ PartMed], [http://www.odontocompany.com/ OdontoCompany], [https://www.lentrecotedeparis.com.br/ L’Entrecôte de Paris], [https://www.espacolaser.com.br/ Espaçolaser], [http://www.joyjuice.com.br/ Joy Juice], [https://www.smzto.com.br/ Casa X], [Embelleze|Instituto Embelleze] and [https://www.guacamolecompany.com.br/ Gua.Co].

== Biography ==
Son of a bricklayer and a housewife, '''Semenzato''' started working at the age of 13. At the time, he sold, in the suburb of [[Lins, São Paulo|Lins]] (a city in the hinterland of the state of São Paulo), snacks produced by his mother. At 16 years old, he became a manager in a copy company. After this experience, he worked in a construction company learning how to program computers. At 18, he started teaching computing to high school students at '''Instituto Americano de Lins'''. At 23 years old, '''Semenzato''' founded his own computing school: [[Microlins]].

In ''1994'', he owned 17 '''Microlins''' schools and, after that, he decided to start expanding through franchising. 

In ''2010'', Microlins had 700 schools in 500 Brazilian cities and was sold to [[Grupo Multi Holding|Grupo Multi]] in a transaction of R$ 110 million.
 
In ''2012'', '''Semenzato''' partned with the Brazilian TV host [[Xuxa|Xuxa Meneghel]] to found [[Casa X]], a franchise company for parties and social events. In 2015, the entrepreneur and Meneghel became partners in Espaçolaser, a franchise company specialized in laser hair removal. 
LifeUSA, an English school franchise, was founded in 2016 in partnership with the Brazilian tennis player [[Gustavo Kuerten]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://endeavor.org.br/autor/jose-carlos-semenzato/|title=José Carlos Semenzato|website=Endeavor|accessdate=28 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228145946/https://endeavor.org.br/autor/jose-carlos-semenzato/|archivedate=28 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uygur and Kulinski are no longer affiliated with the group. The organization formed as a result of the [[2016 United States presidential election]] and has a stated goal of reforming the [[Democratic party (United States)|Democratic Party]] by running "a unified campaign to replace every corporate-backed member of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and rebuild the Democratic Party from scratch" starting in the [[United States elections, 2018|2018 congressional midterm elections]].&lt;ref name="platform"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://justicedemocrats.com/platform/ |title=Platform |publisher=Justice Democrats |access-date=January 25, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mic.com article"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mic.com/articles/166390/cenk-ugyur-bernie-sanders-staffers-team-up-to-take-over-the-democratic-party|title=Cenk Uygur, Bernie Sanders staffers team up to take over the Democratic Party|last=McKay|first=Tom|date=January 23, 2017|newspaper=Mic|access-date=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Democrats describes its views as being held by most Americans, but deemed "politically impossible" by the current political establishment because of systemic [[political corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://billmoyers.com/story/progressives-new-silent-majority/|title=Progressives Are the New Silent Majority – BillMoyers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/election-2016/5-radical-bernie-sanders-ideas-many-americans-strongly-support|title=5 'Radical' Bernie Sanders Ideas Many Americans Strongly Support|first=Sophia|last=Tesfaye|date=5 July 2015|publisher=|via=AlterNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; They comment that as all campaigns need donations and that candidates who hold policies viewed as unfavorable by corporate interests and wealthy individuals will be denied funding by corporations. Therefore the system actually ends up forcing politicians to change their policies to suit the current business environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2015/07/30/politicians-admitting-obvious-fact-money-affects-vote/|title="Yes, We're Corrupt": A List of Politicians Admitting That Money Controls Politics|first=Jon SchwarzJon|last=Schwarz2015-07-30T16:23:50+00:00|website=The Intercept}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://represent.us/action/theproblem-3/|title=One graph shows how the rich control American politics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 election, 26 of the 79 candidates endorsed by Justice Democrats won their respective primary elections. Seven of these candidates won in the general election: [[Raúl Grijalva]], [[Ro Khanna]], [[Ayanna Pressley]], [[Rashida Tlaib]], [[Ilhan Omar]], [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]], and [[Pramila Jayapal]]. Districts won ranged from D+13 to D+34 on the [[Cook Partisan Voting Index|Cook PVI]], meaning solid Democrat. No swing districts were won.

==History==
After the 2016 presidential election resulted in a victory for [[Donald Trump]], many progressives pointed to the perceived loyalty of politicians to large donors as a major contributing factor to Clinton's loss to Trump.  These critics contend that a campaign finance model more similar to that of [[Bernie Sanders]], whose 2016 presidential campaign was funded by small individual donations, will increase public trust in politicians and accountability to constituents.

On January 23, 2017, Cenk Uygur and Kyle Kulinski founded Justice Democrats with ten others, including former staffers from the Sanders campaign such as its Director of Organizing Technology, Saikat Chakrabarti, and [[MoveOn.org]] fundraiser [[Zack Exley]].&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;{{cite news |first1=David |last1= Weigel |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/01/23/progressives-launch-justice-democrats-to-counter-primary-corporate-legislators/ |title=Progressives launch 'Justice Democrats' to counter party's 'corporate' legislators |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Scott Hough |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/3914377/justice-democrats-cenk-uygur-the-young-turks-progressives-launch-party-takeover/ |title=Justice Democrats: Cenk Uygur, The Young Turks, Progressives Launch Party Takeover |website=[[Inquisitr]] |date=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McKay"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mic.com/articles/166390/cenk-ugyur-bernie-sanders-staffers-team-up-to-take-over-the-democratic-party#.GsQGoCrOw |title=Cenk Uygur, Bernie Sanders staffers team up to take over the Democratic Party |author=Tom McKay |date=January 23, 2017 |website=Mic.com |access-date=January 25, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the organization, they seek to create a left-wing populist movement to support alternative Democratic candidates beginning with the 2018 mid-term elections, in order to either defeat the incumbent Democrats or cause them to become accountable to their constituents. They require their candidates to take a pledge to refuse financial contributions from billionaires and corporations.&lt;ref name="platform"/&gt;  In addition, they hope to rebuild the Democratic Party on a national level and to defeat President Trump if he runs for re-election in 2020.

Justice Democrats announced in March 2017 they had teamed up with [[Brand New Congress]], a PAC established by former Sanders campaign supporters, to further their goals.&lt;ref name=McKay/&gt;

As of March 20, 2017, Justice Democrats have reported they have received 8,300 nominations and raised $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Alex |last1=Seitz-Wald |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/democrats-vs-trump/democrats-beware-sanders-movement-turns-midterms-n735301/ |title=Democrats Beware: Sanders 'Movement' Turns to Midterms |website=[[NBCNews]] |date=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative [[Ro Khanna]] of [[California's 17th congressional district]] announced on May 9, 2017, that he had become a Justice Democrat, and the first sitting member of Congress to join the organization.&lt;ref name="LA Times: Khanna joins JD" /&gt; On November 1, 2017, Justice Democrats announced on social media that fellow progressive group [[AllOfUs]] had merged with the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/justicedems/status/925751071687004161|title=Justice Democrats candidates|website=[[Twitter]]|language=en|date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Justice Democrats Merge With AllOfUs.org|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNfmcL3-ZHE|website=YouTube|accessdate=2 November 2017|date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uygur resignation===
On December 22, 2017, it was announced that Uygur had resigned from his position at the organization, following the revelation of previously deleted but archived controversial blog posts he had written when he was a Republican almost two decades earlier that were featured in a report by ''[[TheWrap]]'' that were reported to have been posted in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Uygur apologized the day prior and revealed that he deleted the "ugly" posts over a decade ago because he no longer stood by those principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=389018184872261&amp;id=243510442756370|title=Justice Democrats|website=[[Facebook]]|language=en|access-date=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Kulinski announced that he had stepped down from the organization as he disagreed with the opinions of the Justice Democrats staff members that pressed for Uygur's dismissal over the blog posts. He said his decision came as a result of a personal dilemma as he saw the posts in question upon re-reading them as being satirical due to them dealing with Uygur complaining about his inability to attract women. Kulinski noted that the decision to ask for Uygur's resignation came from the Justice Democrats staff, not the candidates, and as such he asked his supporters to continue backing the organization's candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Secular Talk|title=Statement On Cenk Uygur &amp; Justice Democrats|date=December 23, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kczCNvJYlxk|website=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology and political issues==
According to Justice Democrats, their highest priority is to effectively eliminate the role of money and conflicts of interests in politics, and the group's only litmus test is that candidates decline to accept money from PACs. They wish to pass a constitutional amendment to "put an end to Washington corruption and bring about election reform".&lt;ref name="platform"/&gt; They support the idea of [[publicly funded elections]], banning Super PACs as well as banning private donations to politicians and campaigns. In addition, they advocate the reinstatement of provisions of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] and a ban on [[gerrymandering]] for partisan gain. As a core policy, any candidate running with Justice Democrats must pledge to refuse any donations from billionaires or corporations. They plan to call a constitutional convention.

In addition, their platform encourages many [[Progressivism|progressive]] priorities,&lt;ref name="platform" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.justicedemocrats.com/platform Platform]. Justice Democrats.

==Life and career==
Raised in [[Kuala Lumpur]], the capital of Malaysia, Chan attended the Sri Cempaka school before pursuing a degree in international business from [[Curtin University of Technology]] in Perth, Australia.&lt;ref name=KOSMO/&gt; He began his working life in the corporate world before taking up photography. After two years as an executive assistant in the corporate sector, Chan became burnt out and decided to take up an [[apprenticeship]] at a photography studio&lt;ref name=options /&gt; under the mentorship of TS Lim of Studio 88.&lt;ref name=pmoney&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tan|first=Celine|title=Never Give Up|journal=Personal Money|date=September 2011|pages=54–56|publisher=The Edge|location=Malaysia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kid Chan and Mahatir.jpg|thumb|left|Chan with [[Mahathir Mohamad|Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad]], former Prime Minister of Malaysia]]
In 2000, through a [[management buyout]], he took over a company called Portrait One. The company was later rebranded as Kid Chan Studio.&lt;ref name=options&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toyad|first=Jacqueline|title=Picture perfect|journal=Options|date=29 May 2005|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18607">'''Levitt &amp; Sons''' was a real estate development company founded by Abraham Levitt and later managed by his son [[William Levitt]]. The company is most famous for having built the town of [[Levittown, New York]]. The company's designs and building practices revolutionized the home building industry and altered the north eastern  landscape of the United States with massive suburban communities.

Levitt &amp; Sons was America's biggest home builder by 1951,&lt;ref name="1951trenton"&gt;{{cite web | title = 1951: American dream houses, all in a row | first = Jon | last = Blackwell | work = The Trentonian | url = http://www.capitalcentury.com/1951.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and William Levitt was named one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century.&lt;ref name = "Time100"/&gt; Historian [[Kenneth T. Jackson]] wrote of Levitt &amp; Sons, "The family that had the greatest impact on postwar housing in the United States was Abraham Levitt and his sons, William and Alfred, who ultimately built more than 140,000 houses and turned a cottage industry into a major manufacturing process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://geography.about.com/od/urbaneconomicgeography/a/levittown.htm | title = Levittown - History and Overview of Levittown | publisher = Geography.about.com | date = 2013-07-14 | accessdate = 2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding and early years==
Abraham Levitt founded a [[Real estate developer|real-estate development]] company near the start of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=lhs&gt;[http://www.levittownhistoricalsociety.org/history.htm Levittown Historical Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220063637/http://www.levittownhistoricalsociety.org/history.htm |date=2008-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tac&gt;Garvin, Alexander (2001) ''American Cities: What Works, What Doesn't'' New York: McGraw Hill, p.397.&lt;/ref&gt; His son William became company president at the age of 22, handling the advertising, sales, and financing.  Alfred Levitt, still a teenager, became vice president of design and drafted plans for the first Levitt house, a six bedroom, two bathroom Tudor style home that sold for over $14,000 in 1929 (roughly ${{Inflation|US|14000|1929|r=-3|fmt=c}} today). The Levitts sold 600 of these upper middle-class homes, part of the Strathmore project, in four years during the Great Depression.

William earned a reputation as the person to see for high-end, custom homes on [[Long Island]]'s [[Gold Coast, Long Island|North Shore]], called the Gold Coast. Prior to [[World War II]], Levitt &amp; Sons built mostly upscale housing on and around [[Long Island|Long Island, New York]]. During the 1930s, they built the North Strathmore community at [[Manhasset, New York]], on the former [[Horatio Gates Onderdonk House|Onderdonk farm]].&lt;ref name="nrhpinv_ny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=4613|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Horatio Gates Onderdonk House|date=February 1980|accessdate=2010-10-30|author=Austin N. O'Brien|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016232133/http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=4613|archivedate=2012-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North Strathmore homes sold for $9,100 to $18,500. The Levitts built another 1,200 homes in Manhasset, [[Great Neck, New York|Great Neck]], and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Radio stars, prominent journalists, surgeons, business people, and lawyers bought the upscale Levitt houses.&lt;ref name="biography.yourdictionary.com"&gt;[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/william-levitt "William Levitt Facts"] ''Your Dictionary'' website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction of Levittown, New York ==
After [[World War II]], America's post-war prosperity and [[baby boom]] had created a crisis of affordable housing,&lt;ref name=1951trenton /&gt; especially for returning veterans. Levitt &amp; Sons chose an area known as Island Trees near [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead, Long Island]], as the site for a huge building project for housing these veterans. The company named it [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]]. 

The community was planned to have 6,000 low-priced homes, making it much larger than any other U.S. development. The company bought {{convert|1000|acres|ha}} of potato farms on Long Island. On July 1, 1947, Levitt &amp; Sons broke ground on the $50 million (${{Inflation|US|50|1947|r=0|fmt=c}} million today) development of Levittown, which ultimately included 17,000 homes on 7.3 square miles of land. Alfred created the mass production techniques and designed the homes and the layout of the development, with its curving streets. Abraham directed the landscaping, whose focus was two trees to each front yard, all planted exactly the same distance apart. William was the financier and promoter, who persuaded lawmakers to rewrite the laws that made Levittown possible. The houses, which were in the [[Cape Cod (house)|Cape Cod]] and [[ranch house]] styles, sat on a seventh-acre (0.06 ha) lot. They had {{convert|750|sqft}} with two bedrooms, a living room with a television and a kitchen with modern appliances, an unfinished second floor and no garage.&lt;ref name=triumph&gt;{{cite triumph|pages=173-77}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Levitt's innovation in creating this planned community was to build the houses in the manner of an [[assembly line]].&lt;ref name = "Time100"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989781-1,00.html | title= Suburban Legend William Levitt | first = Richard | last = Lacayo | date = December 7, 1998 | newspaper = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In normal assembly lines, the workers stay stationary and the product moves down the line; in Levitt's homebuilding assembly line, the product—the houses—stayed in place and specialized workers moved from house to house.  The [[assembly line]] construction method allowed Levittown to be constructed more efficiently than other development at the time, with teams of specialized workers following each other from house to house to complete incremental steps in the construction.&lt;ref name = "Time100" /&gt; Levitt also reduced costs by freezing out union labor &amp;ndash; a move which provoked picket lines &amp;ndash; enabling him to use the latest technology, such as spray painting.  He also cut out middlemen and purchased many items, including lumber and televisions, directly from manufacturers, as well as constructing his own factory to produce nails.  The building of every house was reduced to 26 steps, and sub-contractors were responsible for each step.&lt;ref name=triumph /&gt; 

During the project, Levitt &amp; Sons emphasized speed, efficiency, and cost-effective construction; these methods led to a production rate of 30 houses a day by July 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.history.wisc.edu/hist102/readings/Jackson_BabyBoom.pdf |title=The Baby Boom and the Age of the Subdivision |year=1985 |last=Jackson |first=Kenneth T. |accessdate=January 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720114703/http://us.history.wisc.edu/hist102/readings/Jackson_BabyBoom.pdf |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mass production of thousands of houses at virtually the same time allowed the company to sell them for as little as $8,000 each ($65,000 in 2009 dollars), which, with the [[G.I. Bill]] and Federal housing subsidies, reduced the up-front cost of a house to many buyers to around $400.&lt;ref name= triumph /&gt; 

Levitt &amp; Sons was the cover story in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine for July 3, 1950. William Levitt was pictured on the cover, with the tag line "For Sale: a new way of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff | url = http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,1101500703,00.html | title = House Builder Levitt: For Sale: a new way of life | date = July 3, 1950 | newspaper = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discriminatory practices===
As well as a symbol of the American Dream, Levittown would also become a symbol of racial segregation, due to Clause 25 of the standard lease agreement signed by the first residents of Levittown, who had an option to buy their homes. This "[[Restrictive covenant|restrictive covenant]]" stated in capital letters and bold type that the house could not "be used or occupied by any person other than members of the Caucasian race."&lt;ref name=nyt50&gt;Lambert, Bruce (December 28, 1997) [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/28/nyregion/at-50-levittown-contends-with-its-legacy-of-bias.html "At 50, Levittown Contends With Its Legacy of Bias"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Such discriminatory housing standards were consistent with government policies of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Gotham, Kevin Fox (Summer 2000) "Racialization and the State: The Housing Act of 1934 and the Creation of the Federal Housing Administration," ''Sociological Perspectives,'' 43/2 p.309&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Housing Administration]] allowed developers to justify segregation within public housing. The FHA only offered mortgages to non-mixed developments which discouraged developers from creating racially integrated housing.&lt;ref&gt;Kushner, David (2009) ''Levittown: Two Families, One Tycoon, and the Fight for Civil Rights in America’s Legendary Suburb''. New York: Walker &amp; Company. p.43&lt;/ref&gt; Before the sale of Levittown homes began, the sales agents were aware that no applications from black families would be accepted. As a result, American veterans who wished to purchase a home in Levittown were unable to do so if they were black.&lt;ref name="Kushner 2009, p. 44"&gt;Kushner 2009, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt50 /&gt;

William Levitt attempted to justify their decision to only sell homes to white families by saying that it was in the best interest for business.&lt;ref name="Kushner 2009, p. 44"/&gt; He claimed their actions were not discriminatory but intended to maintain the value of their properties. The company explained that it was not possible to reduce racial segregation while they were attempting to reduce the housing shortage. Levvitt said "As a Jew, I have no room in my heart for racial prejudice. But the plain fact is that most whites prefer not to live in mixed communities. This attitude may be wrong morally, and someday it may change. I hope it will."&lt;ref&gt;"When the Niggers Moved into Levittown: a review of David Kushner's ''Levittown: Two Families, One Tycoon, and the Fight for Civil Rights in America's Legendary Suburb''" ''[[Journal of Blacks in Higher Education]]'' 63 (Spring 2009): 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; The Levitts explained that they would open up applications to blacks after they had sold as many homes to white people as possible.&lt;ref name="Kushner 2009, p. 44"/&gt; They believed that potential white buyers would not want to buy a house in Levittown if they were aware that they would have black neighbors.

Though the Levitts were Jewish, they did not wish to sell homes to Jewish families either; despite this, by 1960, although it was still a completely "white" suburb,&lt;ref&gt;Gotham 2000, p.309&lt;/ref&gt; the population of Levittown was roughly a third Jewish, with the remainder about a third Roman Catholic, and a third Protestant.&lt;ref name=patch&gt;Manton, Paul (May 9, 2013) [https://patch.com/new-york/levittown-ny/the-ecclesiastical-history-of-the-levittown-people "The Ecclesiastical History of the Levittown People "] ''[[Patch.com|Levittown Patch]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

An opposition group was formed, the Committee to End Discrimination in Levittown, to protest the restricted sale of Levittown homes, and to push for an integrated community. In 1948 a ruling in another case by the [[United States Supreme Court]] declared that property deeds stipulating racial segregation were "unenforceable as law and contrary to public policy".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Michael E. (2004) "The Slaughter of Cities: Urban Renewal as Ethnic Cleansing". South Bend, Indiana: St. Augustine's Press. p.188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt50 /&gt; Only well after the 1954 racial integration decisions, including ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', was Levittown racially integrated, and even as late as the 1990 census only a tiny fraction of the community was non-white, a stigma that still exists until this day.&lt;ref&gt;Hales, Peter Bacon (September 2016) "Levittown's Palimpsest: Colored Skin" in [http://websupport1.citytech.cuny.edu/Faculty/pcatapano/US2/US%20Documents/Levittown%20Documents%20of%20an%20Ideal%20American%20Suburb.pdf "Levittown: Documents of an Ideal American Suburb"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt50 /&gt;

==Other Levittown projects==
The Levitts went on to plan and build another community of more than 17,000 homes in [[Levittown, Pennsylvania]], which saw its first residents in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why build Levittown? |url=http://www.levittowners.com/why.htm |website=www.levittowners.com |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Willingboro, New Jersey]], was built as a Levittown in 1958, and bears several Levittown-specific street names such as Levitt Parkway.

Discord in the Levitt family caused a split in 1954. Alfred left the company, and William took full control of Levitt &amp; Sons. During the late 1950s, Levitt and Sons developed the community known as "Belair at Bowie," in [[Bowie, Maryland|Bowie]], [[Maryland]]. In 1957 they acquired the historic [[Belair Mansion (Bowie, Maryland)|Belair Mansion]] and estate, home of Maryland's [[Governor of Maryland|colonial Governor]] [[Samuel Ogle]] and his [[Belair Stable]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Baltz  | first = Shirley Vlasak  | title = A Chronicle of Belair  | publisher =Bowie Heritage Committee   | year = 1984  | location = Bowie, Maryland  | pages = 84–88  | lccn = 85165028}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 the community was [[annexation#Subnational annexation|annex]]ed by Bowie.

The company went public in 1960. Through the 1960s, the Levitts constructed houses in six [[Eastern United States|Eastern]] states.&lt;ref name=LevittCommunities/&gt;

In 1961, the company started development in [[Aberdeen, New Jersey]] (formerly Matawan Township), known as "[[Strathmore, New Jersey|Strathmore]] at Matawan."&lt;ref name=LevittCommunities&gt;{{cite web | url = http://levittownbeyond.com/LevittCommunities.html | title = Levitt Communities | publisher = LevittownBeyond.com | accessdate = 3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://levittownbeyond.com/StrathmoreMatawan.html | title = Strathmore at Matawan | publisher = LevittownBeyond.com | first = Kevin | last = Sylvester | date = 2004 | accessdate = 3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Strathmore name had originally been used by Levitt &amp; Sons in its upper middle class developments on Long Island in the 1930s. [[Levittown, Puerto Rico]], built in the 1960s, was a Levitt project.&lt;ref name=0,9171,898440,00/&gt; In 1966, Levitt &amp; Sons built a development in [[Somerset, New Jersey]], and in 1966–72, it built another development in [[Greenbriar, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=LevittCommunities/&gt;  In 1967, the company developed Montpelier, near [[Laurel, Maryland]].

Levitt &amp; Sons even went international. The company built a large development near Paris at [[Lésigny, Seine-et-Marne|Lésigny]] in [[Seine-et-Marne]], and at [[Mennecy]] in [[Essonne]], France.&lt;ref name=0,9171,898440,00&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898440,00.html|title=France: A Lesson from Levitt|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 10, 1965|quote=New European housing often looks elegant from the outside, but much of it is backward in kitchen equipment, bathroom layout, floor plans, heating, plumbing and lighting—the innards that make the shell truly livable. The gap yawns nowhere wider than in France, where 51 years of [[rent control]] have helped create a gargantuan housing shortage. Thus it is not surprising that the French have enthusiastically greeted an invasion by Long Island's William J. Levitt, the U.S.'s biggest homebuilder (fiscal 1965 sales: $60 million). More than 60,000 Frenchmen have poured out of Paris to gape at Levitt's recently opened American-style subdivision in suburban [[Le Mesnil-Saint-Denis]] (pop. 2,000).
|accessdate=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1960s, Levitt &amp; Sons had built more than 140,000 houses.

==Under ITT==
Levitt &amp; Sons was sold to [[International Telephone and Telegraph|ITT]] in 1964 for a reported $90 million (${{Inflation|US|90|1967|r=-1|fmt=c}} million today). The company continued to build housing developments as an ITT subsidiary, under a variety of names that usually included "Levitt".&lt;ref name=LevittCommunities/&gt; Development in [[Florida]] started two years later.

In the United States, Levitt houses were built in the states of [[Arizona]], [[California]], Florida, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Illinois]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]], [[Nevada]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Oregon]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], as well as in [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name=LevittCommunities/&gt; Around the world, Levitt houses were built in [[Canada]], [[France]], and [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=LevittCommunities/&gt;

==Later years==
Starrett Housing Corporation purchased ITT's Levitt subsidiary in 1979.&lt;ref name=LevittCommunities/&gt; Houses continued to be built in Florida, Illinois, New York, and Virginia.&lt;ref name=LevittCommunities/&gt; A completely separate company called Levitt Homes Corp. operated in Puerto Rico during the 1980s.&lt;ref name=LevittCommunities/&gt;

The '''Living Legends of Aviation''' is an award honoring achievements in the aerospace industry, bestowed by the 97 current title holders and owned and produced by the Kiddie Hawk Air Academy, a non-profit [[501(c)(3)]].&lt;ref&gt;https://kiddiehawk.org/pages/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;  The Living Legends have all made significant contributions to many areas of aviation including: innovators, record breakers, astronauts, aviation entrepreneurs, industry leaders and celebrity pilots.

The 16th Living Legends of Aviation Awards, honoring the best in aviation for 2018, will be presented on January 18, 2019, at [[the Beverly Hilton]] Hotel in [[Beverly Hills, California]], where they have been held annually since 2007.

== History ==
Jerry Lips, publisher of ''Airport Journals'', came up with the idea of the Living Legends of Aviation at the time of the death of [[Michael Chowdry]] (founder of [[Atlas Air]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://airportjournals.com/read-my-lips-41//&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Airport Journals'' had been collecting and publishing biographies of various aviation personalities and Jerry regretted not having captured Chowdry's history. He began to compile a list of individuals that had made major contributions in the field of aviation, and had those people suggest more names until 70 were collected. These were the biographies that were to be recorded while the individuals were still "living". The list has grown over the years to its present number of 110.  As Legends pass on, they are replaced by new inductees, selected by their fellow Legends.

Jerry Lips founded the Living Legends of Aviation in 2003 with the charter of celebrating the second century of aerospace. In 2008, Kiddie Hawk Air Academy acquired the rights to the organization and annual awards show from previous owner ''Airport Journals''.

== Event ==
Beginning in 2003, an awards show has been organized each year to bring together the Living Legend members for a variety of events.  The awards are presented at a prestigious live ceremony, most commonly in mid January following the relevant calendar year.  

In 2003, the first Living Legends of Aviation Awards were presented at a banquet dinner hosted by ''Airport Journals'' at the [[Centennial Airport]] in [[Englewood, Colorado]]. To avoid any weather related issues, in 2006 the venue was moved to Southern California and held at the [[Hyatt Regency Century Plaza]] hotel in [[Los Angeles]]. Since 2007 the Awards have been presented at [[The Beverly Hilton]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=AOPA Pilot|title=Harrison Ford honors AOPA|first=Steve|last=Schapiro|page=27|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the inaugural Living Legends of Aviation - Europe event was held on July 26, 2018 at the [[Scalaria]] resort in [[Salzkammergut, Austria]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:magnusthorsteinsson.jpg|right|thumb|Magnús Þorsteinsson]] --&gt;
'''Magnús Þorsteinsson''' is a businessman and was [[chairman]] of now defunct [[Avion Group]]. He was a high-profile investor and [[entrepreneur]] with interests in [[aviation]] and [[financial services]].

==Beverage businessman in Saint Petersburg==
Magnús began his investments in [[St. Petersburg]] together with [[Björgólfur Guðmundsson]] and [[Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson]].

The Icelandic businessmen, together with Russian partners, founded a [[bottling company]] ''Baltic Bottling Plant'', which was sold to Pepsi. They moved to brewing and founded a [[brewing company]] ''Bravo International'' OOO in August 1996 which became ''Bravo International'' JSC in December 1997.&lt;ref name="vladimir"/&gt; ''Bravo Brewery'' became a success on the premium beer [[Botchkarov]].

Danish journalists noted that the ''Committee on External Economic Relations'' in the Mayor's office was responsible for foreigners in Saint Petersburg. The committee's chairman was [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref name="vladimir"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsru.com/finance/21oct2008/iceland_print.html |title=Россия желает спасать Исландию из-за давних офшорных связей чиновников и бизнесменов |date=2008-10-21 |publisher=The New Times }}. Another copy: {{cite news|url=http://www.rususa.com/news/news.asp-nid-37073-catid-8 |title=Зачем Россия спасает Исландию |date=2008-10-21 |publisher=Rususa |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715215806/http://www.rususa.com/news/news.asp-nid-37073-catid-8 |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}. An automatic translation: {{Cite web|url=http://eyjan.is/blog/2008/10/20/umfjollun-um-tengsl-islendinga-og-russa-ur-russnesku-dagbladi |title=Discussion of the relationship between Iceland and Russia from the Russian newspaper. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 an article in The Guardian wondered where the Icelandic money comes from and noted that in the 1990s these Icelandic businessmen "were not only ploughing money into the country but doing it in the city regarded as the [[Russian mafia]] capital. That investment was being made in the drinks sector, seen by the mafia as the industry of choice."&lt;ref name="vikinginvasion"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/jun/16/marksspencer | title=Next-generation Viking invasion - They've got the cash to buy big UK groups like M&amp;S. But where does it come from? | publisher=The Guardian | date=2005-06-16 | location=London | first=Ian | last=Griffiths}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitors in the Saint Petersburg brewing market faced problems. Ilya Weismann, deputy director of a competing beverage company ''Baltic'', was assassinated on 10 January 2000. Then ''Baltic'' director general Aslanbek Chochiev was assassinated. One competing Saint Petersburg brewery burned to the ground.&lt;ref name="vladimir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vikinginvasion"/&gt;

Bravo Brewery became the fastest growing brewery in Russia. [[Heineken]] bought the brewery for $400m in 2002.&lt;ref name="vladimir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whoisbjorgolfsson"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.invgr.com/bjorgolfur_thor_bjorgolfsson.htm | title=Who is Thor Bjorgolfsson, Iceland's lone billionaire? | publisher=Invest in Greece | date=2006-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consul of Russia==
In 2000, Saint Petersburg opened an honorary consulate in Iceland. [[Thor Bjorgolfsson]] was appointed [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] and Magnus Thorsteinsson was appointed Honorary Vice-Consul.&lt;ref name="vladimir"/&gt; The opening ceremony was held on 10 March 2000.&lt;ref name="vladimir"/&gt;

==New businesses==
Magnús acquired 51% of stocks in [[Air Atlanta Icelandic]] in 2002 and a majority share in [[Landsbanki]] with other controversial business partners, [[Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson]] and [[Björgólfur Guðmundsson]]. Magnús lost most of his fortune in the [[2008 financial crisis]] due to the high leverage in his investments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5232">&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Theory and Practice of Change Management |last=Hayes |first=John |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-137-27534-9 |location=London |page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of corporate diagnosis is a process that involves the three steps of publicly entering a human system, collecting valid data about experiences, and feeding back to the system toward promoting corporate performance (Zarei et al., 2014). 
The effective diagnosis of [[organizational culture]], and structural and operational strengths and weaknesses are fundamental to any successful organizational development intervention. As Beckhard&lt;ref&gt;Organizational Development: strategies and models - Beckhard 1969&lt;/ref&gt; said in the preface to his seminal work:&lt;blockquote&gt;
... in our rapidly changing environment, new organization forms must be developed; more effective goal-setting and planning processes must be learned, and practiced teams of independent people must spend real time improving their methods of working, decision-making and communicating. Competing or conflicting groups must move towards a collaborative way of work. In order for these changes to occur and be maintained, ''a planned'', managed change effort is necessary - a program of ''organizational development''.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This was written in 1969 and while much has been learnt it is just as true today.

Since the beginnings of organizational development as a profession, diagnosis has moved from the purely behavioral towards a strategic and holistic business diagnostic approach, and from looking at human interventions in isolation to exploring the interactions of people in the context in which they operate. As organizations are more collaborative in nature, the traditional silo approach to diagnostics is becoming increasingly rare. Organizational development and in particular the diagnostic phase of activities is spreading from the occupational psychologists towards mainstream business. This is important for OD practitioners as the role is increasingly holistic.

==The organizational diagnosis models==
The following models have been introduced for organizational diagnosis:

# Force Field Analysis (1951) 
# Leavitt’s model (1965) 
# Likert system analysis (1967) 
# Weisbord’s six-box model; (1976) defined by focusing on one major output, exploring the extent to which consumers of the output are satisfied with it, and tracing the reasons for any dissatisfaction. 
# Congruence model for organization analysis (1977) 
# Mckinsey 7s framework (1981-1982) 
# Tichy’s technical political cultural (TPC) framework (1983) 
# High-performance programming (1984) 
# Diagnosing individual and group behavior (1987) 
# Burke–Litwin model of organizational performance and change (1992) 
All models are based on open system (Open System Theory, OST): From the General System Theory defined by Von Bertalaffy (a system complex of interacting elements), Katz and Kahn (1978) apply the concept of Open System Theory (OST), looking at the relationship between the organizations and the environment in which they are involved. This focus reflects on the organization's ability to adapt to changes in environment conditions (with or without the need for information processing). (Boulding, 1956; Katz and Kahn, 1978)
# Falletta’s organizational intelligence model (2008) 
# Semantic Network Analysis (2014) (by Zarei, Chaghouee and Ghapanchi)

==The consulting process==
The organizational diagnostic phase is often integrated within an overall OD process, commonly called 'a consulting process'. An example of such a process is:

Entry  → '''Diagnosis''' → Action Planning → Implementation → Termination&lt;ref&gt;Management Consulting - Kubr&lt;/ref&gt;

As the second phase in the consulting cycle, it is also the first fully operational phase of the consulting process or cycle.  The purpose of the diagnosis is to examine the problem faced by the organization in detail, to identify factors and forces that are causing the problem and to prepare the collected information to decide how to implement possible solutions to the identified problems.

The diagnosis of the problem is a separate phase from the solutions themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10820">'''Overwork''' is the expression used to define the cause of  working too hard, too much, or too long. It can be also related to the act of working beyond one's strength or capacity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Overwork|url = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/overwork|access-date = 2015-05-09|journal = The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing physical and/or mental distress in the process.

Compulsory, mandatory, or forced [[overtime]] is usually defined as hours worked in excess of forty hours per week “that the employer makes compulsory with the threat of job loss or the threat of other reprisals such as demotion or assignment to unattractive tasks or work shifts."&lt;ref name="lung"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Overwork and overtime|url = https://mckinneylaw.iu.edu/ilr/pdf/vol39p51.pdf|website = mckinneylaw.iu.edu|accessdate = 2015-05-26|ref = lung|last = Lung|first = Shirley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Voluntary overwork ==
Voluntary overtime is work which the employer may ask the worker to do but which the worker is not required to work unless he agrees at the time to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EAT decision concerning holiday pay and overtime|url = http://www.birketts.co.uk/resources/legal-updates/1564/eat-decision-concerning-holiday-pay-and-overtime/|website = www.birketts.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compulsory overwork ==
Compulsory overwork is that where the individual has no choice but to work more than their capacity. In other words, compulsory overwork is the lack of control that workers exercise over the boundary between work time and private time.&lt;ref name=lung/&gt;

== Consequences ==
Forced overtime, heavy workloads, and frenetic work paces give rise to debilitating repetitive stress injuries, on-the-job accidents, over-exposure to toxic substances, and other dangerous work conditions.&lt;ref name=lung/&gt; Nevertheless, some studies are beginning to show the costs of compulsory overwork. Reg Williams and Patricia Strasser, professors of nursing at the [[University of Michigan]], estimated in the journal of the American Association of Occupational Health Nurses that the total cost of depression at work was as high as $44 billion. They pointed out that healthcare workers have focused much attention on the workplace risk factors for heart disease, cancer, [[obesity]], and other illnesses, but little emphasis on the risk factors for depression, stress, negative changes in personal life, and difficulties in interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Take Back Your Time: Fighting Overwork and Time Poverty in America|url = https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=dKziyTBAvzIC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=%22compulsory+overwork%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wdlDcLIZUj&amp;sig=5HD4-8xdcFhAUeP8DyV-X2qcwAo&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Rq9NVeP_GZKF8gXa5oGwBA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22compulsory%20overwork%22&amp;f=false|publisher = Berrett-Koehler Publishers|date = 2003-09-03|access-date = 2015-05-09|isbn = 9781609943974|language = en|first = John de|last = Graaf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual average work hours for Americans have risen from 1,679 in 1973 to 1,878 in 2000. This represents an increase of 199 hours—or approximately five additional weeks of work per year. This total work effort represents an average of nine weeks more than European workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Take Back Your Time: Fighting Overwork and Time Poverty in America|url = http://www.hofstra.edu/pdf/academics/colleges/hclas/cld/cld_rlr_f04_takeback.pdf|website = www.hofstra.edu|accessdate = 2015-05-09|last = de Graaf|first = John|publisher = Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is within this logic of working more to gain more that workers are living a very hectic and tiring time to provide their families. The result in reality is an excess that does not often translate into high salaries. There are categories of workers where the work and the environments are unhealthy turning the most vulnerable workers and sentenced to fatigue and even living less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stress at Work - A report prepared for The Work Foundation’s Principal Partners|url = http://www.theworkfoundation.com/downloadpublication/report/69_69_stress_at_work.pdf|website = www.theworkfoundation.com|accessdate = 2015-06-08|last = Blaug|first = Ricardo|last2 = Kenyon|first2 = Amy|last3 = Lekhi|first3 = Rohit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotional effects ===

The emotional impacts of overwork can vary, depending on the amount of work, levels of pressure and competition in the work space. Employees who worry about not getting work finished and keeping up a fast pace can feel like they are drowning in their workload, a feeling that manifests itself in [[chronic stress]] and [[anxiety]], which can hebetate the spirit and create tension in personal and work relationships. The behavior continues even if the worker becomes aware that it is personally harmful — even harmful to the quality of the work. The stress that goes along with working too much has been shown to lead to [[substance abuse]], [[sleep disorder]]s, anxiety and ultimately to physical problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/09/22/cb.overworked.vs.challenged/|title=Overworked or challenged at your job? - CNN.com|first=By Kaitlin Madden,|last=CareerBuilder.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical effects ===

One of the key indicators that an individual is being overworked, and not merely challenged, is if work-related stress begins to take a toll on their physical health and general lifestyle. It is easy to distinguish different types of physical symptoms, such as getting sick frequently due to a weakened [[immune system]], depression and [[insomnia]]. All these symptoms can cause more fatigue-related errors at work and affect their personal lives.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Overworked or challenged at your job? - CNN.com|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/09/22/cb.overworked.vs.challenged/|accessdate = 2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Mayo Clinic]], other physical symptoms may include headache, neck pain, lower back pain, depression, changes to appetite and chronic fatigue.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==By country==
=== United States ===
Compulsory overtime and overwork present a growing "convergence" between workers regardless of their occupation, income, education, race, gender, or citizenship. For example, in the United States, immigrants and other low-wage workers toil excessive hours in traditional [[sweatshops]], such as garment factories, restaurants and other industry sectors. At the same time, exposés of "white-collar" and "electronic" sweatshops debunk the glamour of high-tech employment revealing large numbers of higher-paid skilled workers who work upwards of seventy to ninety hours a week under increasingly autocratic conditions.&lt;ref name=lung/&gt;

With the steep rise in annual work hours for individuals and families, more than half of American workers report feeling overworked, overwhelmed by the amount of work they have to do, and/or lacking in time to reflect upon the work they are doing. Overwork is attributable to several trends. First, the climb in annual family work hours since 1979 has coincided with an era of stagnant and falling wages. Annual family work hours have swelled primarily because unprecedented numbers of women have entered the full-time workforce, and those who were already in the workforce have taken on increased hours of work to boost family incomes. Without the increased work hours of women, lower-and middle-income families would have seen their incomes fall or at best remain stagnant. African American and Latino families, whose average hours of work grew faster than white families throughout the 1980s and 1990s, would have been especially hard hit.&lt;ref name=lung/&gt;

Many immigrant workers are faced with the stark choice of complying with required overtime, increased workloads, and frenetic work paces, or being fired. Workers are pressured to compete with one another for longer hours to keep their jobs and avoid being replaced by workers who are more compliant with employer demands. [[Undocumented immigrant]] workers are particularly susceptible to demands for excessive hours. The threat of deportation, along with the criminalization of their work status, creates a climate of vulnerability that unscrupulous employers use to cheapen labor and extract more work.&lt;ref name=lung/&gt;

=== Japan ===
The problem of overwork in Japan has become so acute that the term ''[[karōshi]]'', literally means ‘death by overwork’ was coined a few years ago. The government estimates that 200 people die from ''karōshi'' every year because of heart attacks or [[cerebral hemorrhage]]s due to long hours spent at the work place. However, ''karōshi'' does not include deaths from mental depression or suicides. If this was the case, the number of work related deaths would dramatically increase. Data compiled by the Japanese government shows that 22 percent of the public work more than 49 hours a week, compared to 11 percent of French and Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ‘Death by overwork’: Workaholic Japanese to be forced to take vacation time|url = http://rt.com/news/229943-japan-work-holiday-compulsory/|accessdate = 2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workers typically used less than half of their leave allowance in a year, according to a survey by the labour ministry which found that in 2013 employees took only nine of their 18.5 days average entitlement. A separate poll showed that one in every six workers took no paid holidays at all in 2013. In early discussions, employer groups proposed limiting the number of compulsory paid holidays to three days, while unions called for eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Japan court orders $580k damages for overwork suicide|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-05/japan-worker-family-awarded-damages-for-overwork-suicide/5869926|website = ABC News|accessdate = 2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Japanese government finally decided to do something about the endemic culture of overwork, which has been blamed not just on a growing number of deaths, but also the country's critically low [[birth rate]] and declining productivity. Although Japan is notorious for hard work, it's equally known for inefficiency and bureaucracy. Workers sit around in the name of [[team spirit]], despite questionable performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Japan is literally working itself to death|url = http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/the-country-working-itself-to-death/story-fnkgbb6w-1227252245840|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Per Wimmer''' (born 1968) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] philanthropist, space advocate, entrepreneur, financier and author.

Wimmer owns and administers his own international corporate financial advisory firm, Wimmer Financial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimmerfinancial.com|title=Home|first=Super|last=User|website=www.wimmerfinancial.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he founded on the 50th anniversary of Sputnik day, October 4, 2007. Wimmer Financial specializes in global corporate finance, shares trading, real estate and natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimmerfinancial.com/ |title=Wimmer Financial LLP |publisher=Wimmerfinancial.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wimmer is a founding astronaut with Sir [[Richard Branson]]'s [[Virgin Galactic]]; held a ticket to be the first astronaut onboard the XCOR [[Lynx (spacecraft)|Lynx rocketplane]] ([[XCOR|now canceled]]) and holds a trip to space reservation with Space Adventures. He expects to be the first Danish citizen to enter space on board [[SpaceShipTwo]]. However LA-based René Gross Kærskov is also claiming to become the first Danish citizen in space with Virgin Galactic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rumfartforfolket.com/Dansk_Spacerace.html |title=First Dane in Space? |language=Danish |publisher=Rumfartforfolket.com |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Wimmer published the book "Wall Street", about the bubbles in the financial markets, with anecdotes from his career in the world of global finance. In June 2014 he published his second book "The Green Bubble" in Sweden for the think tank [[Timbro]], which argues there is a bubble within the renewable energy sector. The book has also been published at one of Denmark's largest publishing houses, [[Gyldendal]].

On Oct 6, 2008, Wimmer participated in a [[Tandem skydiving|tandem skydive]] 17.8 miles away&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Far is it Between Syangboche Airport, Namche, Eastern Region, Nepal and Mount Everest|url = http://www.freemaptools.com/how-far-is-it-between-syangboche-airport_-namche,-eastern-region,-nepal-and-mount-everest.htm|website = www.freemaptools.com|accessdate = 2015-09-16|first = Free Map|last = Tools}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Mount Everest]] with Ralph Mitchell as tandem master.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explorehimalaya.com/pdf/everest%20skydive%20report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; After six days of trekking, Wimmer &amp; Mitchell flew in a [[Pilatus PC-6 Porter|Pilatus Porter]] airplane to an altitude of 29,500 feet (ca. 9&amp;nbsp;km), just above [[Syangboche Airport]], free-falling for one minute before opening the parachute and landing at the Drop Zone at 12,350 feet (ca. 4&amp;nbsp;km).

Wimmer bought a ticket to the Russian submersible [[MIR (submersible)|Mir 1]], in connection with the centennial of the construction and sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]. Mir 1 was supposed to dive to 3.8&amp;nbsp;km depth to Titanic in July 2012, however the dive never took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Titanic Dive Expedition 2012 19 December 2010 |url=http://www.luxuryandmoretravel.com/2010/12/titanic-dive-expedition/ |title=Titanic Dive Expedition 2012 |publisher=Luxuryandmoretravel.com |date=2010-12-19 |accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metroxpress.dk/nyheder/per-wimmer-indimellem-far-man-jo-skre-ideer/KOblbs!g60K7FxQTG1eg/ |title=Per Wimmer: "Indimellem får man jo skøre ideer" |publisher= Metroxpress.dk |language=Danish |date= 2012-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, '''positive action''' 
are measures which are targeted at protected groups in order to enable or encourage members of those groups to overcome or minimise disadvantage; or to meet the different needs of the
protected group; or to enable or encourage persons in protected groups to participate in an activity. In the United Kingdom in the [[Equality Act 2010]] ss 158-159, the term is used in the context of employment to allow selection of a candidate from an "under-represented" group, so long as he or she is no less than equally qualified compared to another potential candidate that is not from the under-represented group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5183">A '''Referee in Bankruptcy''' or '''Bankruptcy Referee''' was a federal official with quasi-judicial powers, appointed by a [[United States district court]] to administer [[bankruptcy]] proceedings, prior to 1979. The office was first created by the [[Bankruptcy Act of 1898]], and was abolished by the [[Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978]], which created separate [[United States bankruptcy court]]s with permanently assigned [[judge]]s.&lt;ref name=fjc&gt;{{cite web|title=Bankruptcy Referees|url=http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/admin_03_03.html|work=fjc.gov|publisher=Federal Judicial Center|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The Bankruptcy Act of 1898&lt;ref&gt;Act of July 1, 1898, Ch. 541, 30 Stat. 544.&lt;/ref&gt; established the position of bankruptcy referee "to assist in expeditiously transacting the bankruptcy business". The act specified that referees were to be appointed by the district court for a term of two years, although they could be removed from office or have their jurisdiction over a particular case revoked at any time. The courts could appoint the referees in such numbers "as may be necessary". The fees paid by petitioners in bankruptcy proceedings were used to compensate the referees.&lt;ref name="fjc"/&gt;

All three earlier, short-lived acts providing for bankruptcy jurisdiction in the federal courts had made provision for the appointment of officers to assist in the administration of bankruptcy cases. The act of 1800&lt;ref&gt;2 Stat. 19, repealed in 1803.&lt;/ref&gt; authorized district judges to appoint commissioners with various powers to declare a person a bankrupt, to take possession of a bankrupt's estate, and to assign the bankrupt's property. The next bankruptcy act, in 1841&lt;ref&gt;5 Stat. 440, repealed in 1843.&lt;/ref&gt; provided for the appointment of commissioners to receive proof of debts and carry out other administrative duties related to bankruptcy cases. The Act that governed federal bankruptcy from 1867 to 1878&lt;ref&gt;14 Stat. 517.&lt;/ref&gt; instructed district judges to appoint '''registers in bankruptcy''', who would be nominated by the Chief Justice and assist the judges in a wide range of tasks related to bankruptcy proceedings.&lt;ref name="fjc"/&gt;

Bankruptcy referees appointed under the Act of 1898 performed a wide range of judicial and administrative functions during the early part of the twentieth century, including the following: the consideration and adjudication of bankruptcy petitions submitted to the district courts; the examination of property schedules and lists of creditors filed by bankrupts; the administering of oaths and depositions to witnesses in bankruptcy proceedings; the maintenance of the records in such proceedings and the transmission of such records to the clerk of court; and the distribution of the property of bankrupts in cases where the district court judge was absent. Referees' decisions on substantive matters were subject to review by the district court.&lt;ref name="fjc"/&gt;

Such duties made each referee a combination of special master and estate administrator until the late 1930s, when Congress transferred many of their administrative functions to bankruptcy trustees or clerks of court and increased the referees' judicial functions. The [[Chandler Act]] of 1938&lt;ref&gt;52 Stat. 840.&lt;/ref&gt; granted referees the authority to adjudicate petitions referred to them, to administer oaths and examine witnesses, and to act for the judge in certain instances.&lt;ref name="fjc"/&gt;

In 1946, Congress provided a fixed salary for referees, increased their tenure from two to six years, and limited the circumstances under which they could be removed from office to incompetence, misconduct, or neglect of duty. In 1973 the Supreme Court acknowledged the increasingly judicial nature of the referees' work when it prescribed a set of bankruptcy rules that employed the term "bankruptcy judge" interchangeably with "referee".

In the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 95-598, 92 Stat. 2549, 2657 (Nov. 6, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Congress enacted the current U.S. Bankruptcy Code,&lt;ref&gt;Title 11 of the United States Code.&lt;/ref&gt; abolished the office of bankruptcy referee and established bankruptcy judgeships to serve separate bankruptcy courts in each judicial district. While these judges assumed the referees' judicial duties, the remaining administrative functions in most districts were transferred to trustees whose offices were placed under the supervision of the Department of Justice.&lt;ref name="fjc"/&gt;

'''Ronan O'Rahilly''' (born 21 May 1940) is an [[Irish people|Irish]] businessman best known for the creation of the offshore radio station, [[Radio Caroline]], and as the man who convinced [[George Lazenby]] to give up the role of British Agent [[James Bond]] after only one film.

==Biography==
===Background===
O'Rahilly's parents owned the private port of [[Greenore]] in [[Carlingford Lough]], [[County Louth]]. His grandfather Michael O'Rahilly ([[The O'Rahilly]]) was an important figure in the quest for the independence of [[Ireland]], a leader in the [[Easter Rising]], who died in the fighting in Dublin in April 1916. 

===London club scene===
Prior to his involvement with Radio Caroline, O'Rahilly ran the Scene club in London's [[Soho]] district and managed a number of pop music artists, including [[Georgie Fame]] and [[Alexis Korner]]. He recorded a Georgie Fame record on his own independent label, unheard of at the time. He took the record to the BBC to try to get it played. He discovered that the record industry was dominated by EMI and Decca. He then tried to get it played on [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] and again found that the shows were 'owned' by [[major label]]s EMI, Decca, Pye and Philips. They were essentially '[[payola]]' shows, and featured only music from the paying label. He said "I have recorded the guy, so I can't get it played, so we have to start a radio station."

===Radio Caroline===
He therefore set about creating the [[pirate radio]] station [[Radio Caroline]], which broadcast from a ship, the MV ''Caroline'' anchored in [[international waters]] off the coast of [[Essex]], eastern [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Ship that Rocked the World" by [[Tom Lodge]], Paperback: 164 pages, Publisher: Umi Foundation (July 1, 2003), Language: English, {{ISBN|0-9695938-5-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-9695938-5-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A2939411 | work = BH2G2 | title = The Offshore Radio Revolution in Britain 1964 – 2004| date = 2004-08-31 | accessdate = 2007-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/09/27/bvradio127.xml&amp;page=1 | work = Daily Telegraph | title = The day we woke up to pop music on Radio 1| date = 2007-09-27 | author = Imogen Carter | accessdate = 2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the idea of Radio Caroline was based partly on a plan by Australian music publisher Allan Crawford (who had spent almost two years planning the launch of [[Radio Atlanta]]) and also on [[Radio Veronica]] which had been broadcasting off the Netherlands since 1960. Radio Caroline was largely funded by financier John Sheffield (great uncle of [[Samantha Cameron]]) and [[Carl Ross]] (creator of the Ross fishery frozen food business and grandfather of [[David Ross (businessman)|David Ross]], the co-founder of [[Carphone Warehouse]]) and publisher [[Jocelyn Stevens]].

===Film industry===
He later became involved in the production of a number of films, including as executive producer on the [[Marianne Faithfull]] film, ''[[Girl on a Motorcycle]]'' and ''[[Two Virgins]]'' featuring [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]].

O'Rahilly became manager of the Australian model-turned-actor [[George Lazenby]], who played James Bond in one film. During production of the 1969 [[James Bond]] movie ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', O'Rahilly talked Lazenby into refusing a seven-movie Bond contract on grounds that the James Bond character was out of touch with the times, and would not successfully continue into the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Masheter, Philip George Lazenby Interview ''The Making of On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' ''Movie Collector Magazine'' Vol Two Issue Two&lt;/ref&gt; Of this advice, [[Roger Moore]] said in his autobiography, ''My Word Is My Bond'', "George took some bad advice ... I knew George then and have met him many times since. He admits he made a mistake". O'Rahilly also appeared in Lazenby's film ''[[Universal Soldier (1971 film)|Universal Soldier]]'' where both men were credited as executive producers. 

In the 1970s O'Rahilly, noticing that people "found it easier to talk about hate than love", developed the [[philosophy]] of "Loving Awareness", which has been heavily promoted on Caroline ever since. In 1976 an album of songs based on the concept was recorded by the Loving Awareness Band, a group assembled by O'Rahilly for the purpose.

===Later life===

On Monday 3 December 2007, O'Rahilly was inducted as a Fellow of the [[Radio Academy]]. O'Rahilly was inducted into the Hall Of Fame at the PPI Radio Awards, held at the Lyrath Hotel, [[Kilkenny]], Ireland on 12 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/kneesflashes/happenings/octnovdec07/octnovdec0701.html Radio Academy Honours Offshore Pioneers] Radio London – Current Happenings Q4 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Radio Academy [http://www.radioacademy.org/about/fellows/ "Fellows"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024171034/http://www.radioacademy.org/about/fellows/ |date=2014-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, O'Rahilly was reported to be suffering from [[vascular dementia]] and to have returned to live in [[County Louth]], Ireland, in sight of the port of [[Greenore]] where Radio Caroline was "born" 50 years ago.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.offshoreechos.com/Main%20page.html  Offshore Echoes] &lt;/ref&gt;

{{The Salvation Army}}
'''Samuel Booth''' (1775–1842), the father of [[William Booth]], was born in [[Belper]], [[Amber Valley]], [[Derbyshire]], [[England]].  He was tall and often wore clothes that made him look like a [[Quaker]]; knee-breeches, drab-cloth suits, and cut-away coats.  He married [[Sarah Lockitt]] in 1797.  At that time, he was a nail-maker.  The [[industrial revolution]] made his job redundant, therefore he tried to set up some building companies and became an architect.  This provided him with sufficient funds to buy a house at [[Colston Bassett]].  Samuel and Sarah had a son named William, but he was not the William Booth who founded [[The Salvation Army]].  Sarah died in 1819 and William died five years later.

When Samuel Booth went to [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]] to drink the water in hopes that it would cure his rheumatism, he met [[Mary Moss]].  He proposed, but she declined.  He soon renewed his proposal and pursued her until she agreed, although he was sixteen years her senior.  They married and had five children: Henry, Ann, William, Emma, and Mary.  Henry died at the age of three.  This William became the founder of The Salvation Army.  Emma was an invalid from birth and she died without ever marrying at the age of forty.  Mary eventually became Mary Newell, and she lived until she was 69.

As Samuel was forced into bankruptcy by successive trade recessions, he moved to [[Nottingham]].  William was eventually to say of him:

:"My father was a Grab, a Get. He had been born in poverty. He determined to grow rich; and he did. He grew very rich, because he lived without God and simply worked for money; and when he lost it all, his heart broke with it, and he died miserably."

Samuel Booth was not a religious man, and although he had little interest in his children, he insisted that they attend church regularly.

Samuel began to lose more money and he was forced to move into a house on [[Sneinton]] Road in a poorer neighbourhood, but he eventually moved back to Nottingham.  It was there that he died.  He was baptised on his deathbed, after which he committed his wife and children to God.  Those who surrounded him, including his son William, sang ''[[Rock of Ages (Christian hymn)|Rock of Ages]]'' as he died.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5350">The '''Second Street Cable Railway''' was the first [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] system to open in [[Los Angeles]].{{sfn|Swett|1951|p=9}}  Opened in 1885, it ran from Second and Spring Streets to First Street and Belmont Avenue.  The completed railway was 6,940 feet long, just over a mile and a quarter, with a power house constructed in the middle, at Boylston Street.{{sfn|Post|1989|p=51}} It was a single track system, with sidings where a down-hill car could coast past an up-hill car. The route included the steepest gradient on any street railway in North America, a 27.7 degree hill along Second Street between Bunker Hill Avenue and Hope Street on [[Bunker Hill, Los Angeles, California|Bunker Hill]]. The line opened to Texas Street on Oct 8, 1885.{{sfn|Swett|1951|p=9}}

The railway was created to encourage sales of property west of downtown Los Angeles, property in the area known as Crown Hill.  Henry Witmer, E.A. Hall, and Jesse Yarnell, owners of the property, organized the Los Angeles Improvement Company to subdivide the property into 1400 lots and build the cable railway to connect it to downtown.{{sfn|Post|1989|p=51}} Other backers included downtown businessmen such as Isaac W. Lord and [[John Edward Hollenbeck|John Hollenbeck]], who owned property near the terminus of the line at Second and Spring Streets.{{sfn|Post|1989|p=51}}

A beer garden resort, called City Park, was developed at the northeast corner of First and Lakeshore in order to draw more passengers to the line.{{sfn|Swett|1951|p=9}}

In January, 1888, James McLaughlin paid $130,000 for the line and the beer garden, something which turned out to be a most unfortunate decision.{{sfn|Post|1989|p=54}} 

By the spring of 1888 demand for lots had fallen off, but by then the Improvement Company had sold all but 52 of its lots.  In addition, Hollenbeck had expanded his Hollenbeck Hotel at Second and Spring, Witmer and some associates had built the California Bank at the corner of Second and Fort Street (Broadway), and the city had built a new [[Los Angeles City Hall|City Hall]] on Fort Street just south of Second Street.{{sfn|Post|1989|p=54}}

The system was chronically plagued with damage to its cables and pulleys due to flooding. It had to be closed down for several days in the winter of 1888 because a replacement for a broken cable could not be delivered to the cable house through the muddy streets. 

In March, 1889, an agreement was made with McLaughlin’s Cahuenga Valley Railroad (built in conjunction with Ivar Weid), which served the new Colegrove area, located just south of Hollywood.  The cable railway would exchange transfers at First and Belmont so that its patrons could travel from downtown all the way to Colegrove.{{sfn|Swett|1951|p=9}}{{sfn|Post|1989|p=54}}

But in late summer, 1889, the Cahuenga Valley Railroad was prevented from operating within the Los Angeles city limits. On October 13, McLaughlin suspended cable operations ”indefinitely”.  He applied for a permit to extend the road to Alvarado, but the council denied the permit.{{sfn|Post|1989|p=57}} On December 24 of that year another flood caused further damage to the line, and it was abandoned in 1890. With its demise, the Second Street Cable Railway had the distinction of being the first cable railway in the United States to go out of business.{{sfn|Post|1989|p=57}}

==Education==
Altschul graduated ''summa cum laude''&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E6D9133EF934A25757C0A962958260 Weddings; Caroline James, Stephen Altschul - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Harvard University]], where he was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in [[mathematics]] and has a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in the same field from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="altschulphd"&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Stephen Frank|last=Altschul |title=Aspects of Biological Sequence Comparison |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |date=1987 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/303525377/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
His research interest is centered on sequence alignment algorithms, statistics of sequence comparison and measurement of sequence similarity.&lt;ref name="microsoft"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dblp"/&gt;

==Background==
He is the son of Stephanie Rosemary (née Wagner) and [[Arthur Altschul]], a former partner at [[Goldman Sachs]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E3DA1138F932A15750C0A9649C8B63 Death notice of Arthur Goodhart Altschul]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1956/03/18/archives/trota-announced-of-miss-wagner-to-be-wed-in-may.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, he married Caroline Kershaw James, the daughter of Caroline James-Pritz of [[Cincinnati]] and Harry Keithan James of [[Dayton, Ohio]]. The Rev. Luther D. Miller Jr. performed the ceremony at St. David's Episcopal Church in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/17/style/weddings-caroline-james-stephen-altschul.html New York Times: "Weddings; Caroline James, Stephen Altschul"] April 17, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

His half-sister is journalist [[Serena Altschul]] known for her tenure at [[MTV]]. On his father's side, he is a member of the [[Lehman family]].

He has two sons, James and William Altschul. William Altschul is a college Ultimate player at Washington University in St. Louis. &lt;ref&gt;https://play.usaultimate.org/teams/events/Eventteam/?TeamId=x%2f0V5EX9wIVnzxDyk7NGO5XjowKF%2boMV0pElxx1dgY8%3d&lt;/ref&gt;

==From mathematics to bioinformatics==
During his undergraduate years, Dr. Altschul developed an interest in biology. As a result, he started reading books about DNA. One of the books which he read was "The Double Helix" by Watson. Furthermore, he had also taken a course on Evolutionary Biology. Dr. Altschul had also spent two summers working in laboratories at Rockfeller University where he helped to write computer codes for an X-ray crystallography project.

Due to his interest, Dr. Altschul had considered trying to apply to graduate school in biology. He instead decided to apply to programs in applied mathematics, with the hope of finding some applications of mathematics to biology to work on.

==Notable appointments/positions held==
Upon graduation, Dr. Stephen Frank Altschul worked in the Mathematics Research Branch of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases as an IRTA postdoctoral fellowship. From 1990 to present, he has worked in the NCBI Computational Biology Branch, holding the position of senior investigator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3380">'''Stuart Huggett''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]]-born [[Fiji]]an [[architect]], businessman, and civil servant, who served as Chairman of the [[Public Service Commission (Fiji)|Public Service Commission]] from 2004 to 2006, when he was removed from office on 6 December 2006 by the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Military]] [[military junta|junta]] which had [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|seized power]] the previous day.

In addition, Huggett is a Director of [[Architects Pacific Limited]],&lt;ref name="architectspacific"&gt;[http://www.architectspacific.com/ Architects Pacific]&lt;/ref&gt; which is based in [[Suva]] and in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] and the Honorary [[Consul]] for [[Spain]].

Huggett was born in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[England]].  He graduated from the [[Royal Western England College of Architecture]], now the [[University of Bristol]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bris.ac.uk Bristol University]&lt;/ref&gt; After his marriage, he spent a year in [[Zaria]], Nigeria, during the [[Nigerian civil war]] in the late 1960s.

He founded Architects Pacific Limited&lt;ref name="architectspacific" /&gt; in 1971, which specialized in residential, commercial and tourist resort design and masterplanning. He also organised the Fiji [[Muroroa]] Protest in 1995.

==2006 coup d'état==
On 6 December 2006 Stuart Huggett, as Chairman of the PSC, called together a meeting of the CEOs of the various governmental ministries, including [[Nainendra Nand]], the [[Solicitor-General of Fiji]]. Military forces broke up the meeting and detained Huggett and Nand, and there were unconfirmed reports that the two had been assaulted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfmf.mil.fj/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207013622/http://www.rfmf.mil.fj/ |date=December 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A veiled statement by [[Australia]]'s [[Foreign Minister of Australia|Foreign Minister]], [[Alexander Downer]], on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC television]]'s 7:30 report gave some credence to the rumours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/ ABC: The 7.30 Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chairman and Solicitor General were served notice of dismissal by the Military Commander, [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama]], on 7 December 2006. However the elected Government of Fiji gave no such notice to any governmental officials.

Announcing the appointment of [[Hector Hatch]] as Huggett's successor on 4 January 2007, Commodore Bainimarama said that Huggett had been uncooperative with the Military authorities, and also claimed that he was under investigation for allegations that a company he was connected with had tendered for a [[Fijian dollar|F$40 million]] government contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=54608|publisher=Fiji Times online|title=New boss for PSC|date=4 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Huggett is married to Gillian Margaret Illife,  with whom he has three daughters, Catherine, Alexandra and Amitia and a son, James.

'''''The Empire of Business''''' is a collection of essays written by [[Scottish-American]] industrialist [[Andrew Carnegie]] which were published in book form in 1902.

The book shares his shrewd outlook on the economic situation in America at the turn of the 20th century; Carnegie discusses the rewards of hard work, integrity, frugality and other prudent qualities such as the "bugaboo of trusts" that he believes every person should possess if they wish to achieve success in their lifetime. Topics include the state of the oil and steel industries within the United States and the best uses of tariffs.

The essays that form the book have been gathered from a number of well received publications from the era, these include the ''[[New York Evening Post]]'', the ''[[New York Journal]]'' and ''[[Macmillan's Magazine]]''. ''The Empire of Business'' provides the reader with an insight into one of history’s most notable entrepreneurs. Andrew Carnegie is also often described as the most prominent philanthropist in history.
